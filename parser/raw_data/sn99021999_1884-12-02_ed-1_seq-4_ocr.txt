IT was Chicago and not Ifoatrico that

CAMPAIGN scandals have scarcely ceased
to plague the press of thin country before

that was offered to him was n dog , which
-was sent to him by express , but ho re
fused to accept it , probably because It
was a "yallor dog. " The Boston demo

very likely politely refuse It , if ho wishes
to retain the rcepcct of the people , and
maintain the dignity of the position to
which ho has boon olovatod.
Tup. authorities of Denver are to bo
congratulated upon having driven from
that city the notorious bunko man , Dr.

They are now temporarily in Omaha , and
nay they are going to Now Orleans. Wo
would suggest to Marshal Cumlngs that
it would bo a good thine ; to order them
to resume their journey to tho' Orescent

the winter hero. Several confidence
gumos have boon played in and around
Omaha during the past few days , and it
is not unlikely that this gang ia doing the
work.
Tvrn.NTV thousand bushola of corn were

CHARLES FIIAMOM ADAMS ia something -
thing of a landgrabbor himself. It ap-
oaro that ho and his associates have
entered largo tracts of land In Wyo
ming upon which they have expended
$000,000 in irrigation , and they have
aisignod the entries to ether parties to
provo up. Thia action has raised quito
an important question concerning 'tho
dexert land entry law , and the Wyoming
.cat'lemon'a association haa sent its at-
'tornoy to Washington to obtain from the
.secretary of the interior a ruling on tbo
matter. Carl Schurz , when secretary of
'tho interior , hold that an assignment of
that kind , placing an entry In the hands
of on assignee , violated the contract , BO
that the entry could not bo proved up.
This haa been generally understood to bo
the pcmtion of the department over alnce.
It is now intimated that Secretary
Teller will reverse the decision of Schurz ,
BO that hereafter an aasignuo can
provo up a desert land entry. Public
lands which require irrigation to make
them produce crops come under the cl&s-
uiQcitlou of desert Undo. Adama and
bis auciclatea will therefore acquire poa-
of tbo lands in question. Secre
tary Teller'a decision will no doubt be the
cause of much of the eo-oallod desert

TUG PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Arthur's message to congress
Is an rible , dignified and practical state
document , and will bo read with a great
deal of intercit. All Important matters
nro treated in a very intelligent manner ,
and it is evident that the president has
given to the various subjcc's his closest
attention nnd most careful study. Ills
congratulations to the country upon iho
patience nnd love of order nnd of law
displayed by the paoplo while the prcii-
dontlal Issue was In doubt are eminently
proper and timely , and in this connection
bo calls the attention of congress to the
necessity of providing a moro satisfactory
method of counting the electoral vote ,
Among the recommendations embodied
in the moisago Is the extension of the
icopo of the neutrality lawa , BO as to
cover acts of hostilities committed in this
country against a friendly power. This
is evidently aimed at the dynamiters ,
and may not bo very warmly received by
the enemies of England , oven If they do
not endorse dynamite warfare. They will
atguo that the Unltod States ought not
to take any stops in ouch legislation for
the benefit of England until England haa
evinced some reciprocal spirit , and makes
a request for mutual' legislation. The
inference might bo that the United
States has become the headquarters of
conspirators against foreign government
which is by co means the fact. The
nearest approach to anything of that kind
is O'Donovan lloasa and hisfewcsso
olatoa , who simply amuse thorns 2ves by
inventing scaroa that have no foundation
in fact.
The prraidont'a recommendation , coin'
ciding with that of the secretary of the
treasury , that the coinage of silver should
bo immediately suspended , is based upon
the fact that there is now in the treasury
5180,000,000 in nilvor , and only ? 10-
000,000 in circulation. To force thia
overproduction of silver Into circulation
ho recommends the mthdraual
from circulation of thoouo nnd two dollar
notes. Whether this proportion to
unload the cumbersome oilvor Trill
meet with popular approval remains to
bo soon , as there cooma to bo an abund
ance in circulation aud moro than
enough for all practical purpoaoa of trade.
As a rule people prefer smill bills OB
they nro more convenient to handle ,
President Arthur dwells at considera
ble length upon the subject of our foreign
trade , and makes several recommenda
tions as to the best methods , in lib
opinion , to relieve the depression under
which our industries are languishing.
After tuggcsting that a commission bo
appointed , .ho rocommonda n series
of treaties with the countries of America
so us to afford an opportunity for an un
hampered movement of trado. Ho ad -
vacates the free admission
of such articles of mer
chandise from these countries na nro not
produced in the Unltod States , and that
products from our country bo treated iti
tlko manner by the treaty nations * also ,
the construction and maintenance of a
steam carrying marine under the flag of
the United States , and the establishment
of a consular service on n salaried footing ,
and the rollnqulshmont of consular fees
not only as respects vessels under the
national flag , but as respects the vessels
of the treaty nations , carrying
joods entitled to the benefits of
the treaties. Another suggestion ,
which is very practical In Itn nature , is to
establish a uniform currency basis for the a
countries of America that might enter
Into the proposed trade treaties , ao that
the coin products of our mines may nlr-
culato on equal terms throughout the entire -
tire combination. This of course would
have to bo brought about by n monetary
union.
The president urgoi the restora
tion of the navy to its former
efficiency , not only as a matter of
national pride , but as a security
against trouble- with foreign countries ,
which may. como at any time. In the
Bamo connection ho recommends the de
fense of our seaports by appropriate
works , ana for that purpose ho suggests
an appropriation , BO that operations can
bo begun lit nn early day. The surplus
in the treasury could not bo used for a
bettor purpose.
In rog rd to the voxittouu Morifnon
problem , President Arthur expresses
himself rather emphatically. IIo believes
that if the polygamous practices cf thu
Mormons can bo suppressed , it cm only
bo done by the most radical legislation ,
consistent with the roatralnta of the con tlre
stitution , and ho rooommonda that con- regress

General Passenger Agent.
This la certainly a discrimination
against Omaha , Fremont and Norfolk.
Mr. Buchanan , acting nndor directions ,
Insists that all business for his lines shall
go by the tray of Missouri Valley , and
not by way of Oaiaha. A passenger hav
ing a ticket to points on his system , by
wny of Omaha or Fremont , would find
that ticket dishonored. Ho must go by
the Missouri Valley route in order to
o Mr. Buchanan's lines the longest
haul possible. Should any business orlg-
nato at O-naha it may como via Blair ,
says Mr. Buchanan's circular. This is Indeed -
deed very kind , but nevertheless it is
what wo call forcing things a little , and
wo presume that the simo policy la to bo
pursued with regard to freights.
Jt certainly It a very cheeky
proposition. The Idea of competing
for the trade of Omaha by the way of
Blair la asking a little too mnoh. The
trouble with nearly all railroads ia that
they ore working for the longest haul , no
matter hovr they get it. It novr becomes
question whether Omaha is to allow herself -
self to bo made the victim of the long
haul. She has enough business to-day to
bring those long haul roads to timo. If
our merchants would patroubj only those
roads th t are at all friendly to our inter
oa Is and treat ns fairly , they can soon put
an end to such unjust discrimination a
is balng carried ou by the Chicago &
Northwestern and the Sioux City & Pa
cific roads. The discrimination iu the
paasongor business dooj not hurt us half
ao much as the diacrimlnation against us a
in cattle , hogj and grain. The trade that
rightfully belongs to Omaha is buing < ! !
Tortod to Sioux City , Chicago , Kansas '
City , St. Joe and olaowhoro.7o are bo-
n
cut elf on the smith au7oll as on the
north , autl nil bocunso ol the desire
to got the longest haul possible.
Vn order to compel our paoplo to give
them the long haul , curtain roads like
these mentioned nbovo , maintain ex
travagant local ratoj In Nebraska , and
offjr inducements in thoahapo of reduced
rates for the long haul. This of course
forces our people to ship tholr grain , cattle
tlo and hoes to Chicago , and for the sumo
reason they are compelled to buy their
lumber and ether hoivy supplies in that Is
city instead ol in Omaha. It will be us
soon that everything possible is being
done < in favor of Chicago aud against
Omaha , all on account of the long haul.
stands to reason that this policy
the part of certain railroads
inflicting a serious drawback
upon our wholatalo trade , nud is a great I
obstacle in the w y of our building up a
cattle aud grain market hero. It seems
us that tbo remedy , te n great extent ,
in Iho hands of our pooplo. A direct
railroad line from Omaha to Norfolk and
the Eikhorn Valley , owned and opor-
ntod in the interest of Omaha , would
oompol the ether roads to give this city
gooi a show ai they do Sioux City , BO
. Joo. and Kanias City. Another
remedy , or as wo have already in
intimated , is to patronize only these
roids thitt are iuclinod to give Omaha are

POSTAL AFFAIRS.
Postmaster-General Uatton's annnl
report presents some interciling facts and
figurus. It shovres that the expenditures
were n little over three million dollars in
excess of receipts , the decrease in receipts
being attributed tn the rodus'.lnn of pos
tage from three to two cents , which took
effect October 1 , 1883. Mr. Ilatton says
that although the change was in actual
operation only during three-quarters of
the fiecal year , its effect waifelt upon the
revenues for the entire year. The ordi
nary postal revenue for the year ended
Juno 00 , 1884 , was 82,278,438 leas than
that of the preceding year. That the
lees of revenue was not greater is a
matter of surprise as well as cougratula-
tlon , as the estimate on which the change
was based contemplated a loss for the
first year of abont 98,000,000. Whllo
there was a reduction in the postage rate ,
there was a great inoroaao in the number
of letters sent , and a decrease in the
number of postal card * . Out of the 11-
24G,5JG letters and parcels sent through
the registered mails during the year ,
8,003,338 were domestic letters , and the
ascertained losses footed up only 51G , or
ono in every 21,705. This is a smaller
loss than In any previous year , and is
very crcditobla to the efficiency aud
honesty of the registry department.
'Iho postmaster general urges further
reduction of letter postogo to ono cent , as
the postal service is now virtually self'
sustaining , and that the unit of weight in
rating loiters and sealed packages of
flrat class matter bo changed from ouo-
half ounce to ono ounce. This recom
mendation will certainly meet with uni
versal approval aa fho people want as
cheap postage as possible. Another good
recommendation 13 * that of a special ton
ccnti'ontngo stampwhich when affixcdto a
letter , in addition to the proper postage
charge , should insure for It as speedy a
delivery as poaslblo after ils reception at
any letter-carrier cflico. This ouhido
distribution could bo effected by employ
ing messenger boys , at a email salary and
in such numbers as the circumstances
should warrant. The postmaster-general
foch satisfied that such an effort to ao-
cumodato the public would still further
commend the free delivery service to ito
patrono in the largo cities where It h iu
operation. Mr. Datton'u report shows
that during the year the fast mail service
has been extended and materially im
proved on the trunk lines. The post-
offino department is evidently in a very
flourishing condition , nnd its operation
under Mr. flatten haa proved very satis
factory.

quiries ai t ? the cause of the disease

tially :
"I am convinced that it is caused by
ovor-fcodlng. There may bo smut in tno
corn , but the effect of that can bo easily
overcome by the simplest method. When
I turn my cattle into cornfields
I never leave them there moro
than two hours , and going and coming
from there I give them nil the spring
water they will drink and plenty of salt.
This will overcome the effect of smut and
aid them in digesting what they have
eaten. Moat farmers neglect this entire
ly , nnd turn their cattle from grass land
into cornfields where the rich and juicy
stalks nnd dropped corn tempt them to
gorge themselves , and brice in that condi
tion it is next to impossible to prevent
death. I have soon in the stomachs of
cattle killed by overeating the stalks nnd
corn as dry an when they were taken from
the fluid. Plenty of pure water and salt
aud lluiitii g their time in to two hours a

disease which is now causing co much loss

There Is a law against throwing dead bo
