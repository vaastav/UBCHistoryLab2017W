COAL ORDERS
Most Extensive Shutdown of
Industry in History Faces
Nation if Coal Strike is Not
Settled Soon.
FACTORIES MAY CLOSE
(By Associated Press)
CHICAGO. Dec 2. Restrictions on
the use of coal already put into effect
by regional coal committees where he
pinch of necessity had been felt, to
day were extended throughout the
nation under an order of the federal
fuel administrator. The most exten
sive shutdown of Industry In history
'was in prospect and domestic consum
ers were preparing to endure priva
tion and discoiufort as the strike of
bituminous coal miners entered its
second month.
Only in Kansas where volunteers
worked in the strip pits under protec-
'3 lion of state and federal troops, and
the New River fields of West Vir
ginia, was there prospect today of in
creased production In the former 7
pits were worked and in West Vir
ginia operators said normal produc
tion was la sight by the end of the
week.
Throughout the remainder of the
eowitry, however, miners apparently
remained steadfast in their determina
tion not to return to work under the
14 per cent Wage increase ordered by
the federal government and acceded
to by the operators
In Wyoming new labor troubles
threatened to decrease the email
amount of coal being brought out. Ex
cept for brief shut-downs at the be
ginning of the strike and twice since,
the mines in that state generally had
maintained operation.
Members of the railroad broth er-
Tioods in Kansas today were expected
to act on a resolution adopted last
night to request authority to refuse to
handle coal mined by non-union work'
ere.
Fuel Further Curtailed.
Under the sweeping order of Fuel
Administrator Garfield, limiting deliv
ery of fuel or power only to essential
consumers In the first five classes of
the war priorities list, curtailment of
production was in prospect in factor
les turning out boots and shoes, brass
j. and- b roaze manufactures,' clothing.
machinery, except where . specifically
, exempted, iron and steel, jewelry,
marble and stone products, musical
instruments, paper goods, newsprint
excepted, rubber goods, cigars, wag
ons and carriages, wood manufactur-
ers, sheet and metal productions,
leather goods, mattresses, paints and
Varnishes, photographic supplies and
miscellaneous non-essentials.
Theatres, motion picture shows and
all other places of amusement faced
complete shutdown. Churches and
schools also were included in the
category although efforts were being
made to postpone closing schools as
long as possible.
Bakeries, except those producing
only bread, also fen under the ban.
as did confectioners and certain pack
ing plants.
In some, of these industries, how
ever, an immediate shutdown might be
forstalled if the regional coal com
mittees allow them to operate until
their present supply of coal was ex
hausted. Many operators today toped work
3n the mines would soon be resumed
runder inducement of the- increased
"wage scale and the government and
rpublio appeal. On the other hand,
-John I Lewis, acting president of the
miners, declared the government must
redeem "Its pledge to the miners of
-a SI per cent increase.' Lewis said
that the situation was unchanged as
Jar as the miners were concerned. He
would not predict the next move to
end the tie up.
No Suffering Yet.
Despite low temperatures that have
spread over the west for the last few
days but little actual suffering be
cause of the fuel shortage today had
been reported. In Nebraska where
near zero weather prevailed, Kilgore
had been without coal 10 days. West
ern Kansas, also without coal several
days, today were to obtain an emerg
ency supply, the first taken from the
strip pita of that state.
Suspension of all traffic on the St.
Louis and San Francisco railroad lines
out of Oklahoma City today was said
to bo a matter of hours unless coal
vas supplied. All railroad traffic
illicit be tied up at Oklahoma City
by the end of the week, railroad of
ffrials there said.
In, Indiana, state officials express
ed the hope that enough coal could be
mined immediately to furnish state
institutions with coal.
INDIANAPOLIS. Dec. 2. State offi
cials today were hopeful of early re
iiimption of operation of mines in In
diana which furnish state institutions
with coal. This hope resulted from
a conversation held by Governor James
P. Goodrich last night with Edward
Stewart of Terre Haute, president of
District No. 11. United Mine Workers,
who, the governor said, agreed to go
to Evansville today and discuss with
miners the advisability of resuming
work to supply the state institutions
with fuel.
SPRINGFIELD. Ill, Dec. 2. The
miners have not utilized the full
strength of their organization, Frank
Farrington, president of the Illionis
miners, said today, in a statement in
which he declared that "there is a
likelihood that should the bituminous
miners find themselves hard pressea
in this case.that the anthracite miners
may decide to come to their aid."

here today, 18 countries being repre
sented. Baron Deachamps, Belgian
member of the Hague court of arbitra

preme guarantee of peace, for which
humanity .longs.

Henry Clay Frick, Master of
Coke Industry, Dead in N. Y.
(Ey Associated Press)
NEW YORK, Dec. 2. Henry Clay
Frick died here today. Mr. Frick suf
fered an attack of ptomaine poison
ing early In November. He had near
ly recovered from this when compli
cations developed. He was 69 years
old. His fortune is estimated at
$200,000,000.
The career of Henry Clay Frick has
formed one of the most fascinating
chapters in the romance of industry in
the United States. At 10, a boy on a
farm in a family of only ordinary
means, he was at 60, a man of so
many millions that his fortune, like
those of Carnegie and Rockefeller,
was largely a matter of guess-work
even to himself. It has been said he
was worth more than $100,000,000, per
haps as much as $200,000,000.
Mr. Frick built up the greatest coke
business in the world, and acquired
such vast Interests in steel that be
was also one of the principal mag
nates in that industry, and In round
ing out his career he became known
as one of the world's greatest collect
ors of master paintings.
Mr. Frick was born December 19,
1849, at West Overton, Pa. His fath
er attempted farming, but did not
make a remarkable success of it and
as a result young Henry Clay Frick
was practically adopted into the Over
holt family when he was about 12
years old. He received a good basic
schooling, but there was nothing in
his boyhood to indicate the remark
able ability which characterized his
later life, except hia eagerness to get
into business. For a time he was
bookkeeper in his grandfather's dis
tillery, and from this position he went
to Morgan and Company, coke dealers,
and at about 21 years of age he ap
peared in Pittsburgh as their agent.
The coke industry was in its in
fancy. The iron masters of Pittsburgh

Young Frick had an opportunity to

SOUTH DAKOTA G.O.P.
FAVORS GEN. WOOD
PIERRE, S. D., Dec. 2 A three
ring political arena was thrown open
here today to receive the hats of the
various office seekers, from candidates
for president of the United States to
minor state positions.
Three state conventions, held simul
taneously in the capital city brought
not only one of the greatest gather
ings of South Dakota politicians in
history to Pierre, but also attracted
a number of national political leaders.
The fact that each convention was to
nominate candidates for United States
senator, congress and state office, was
overshadowed by the fact that the Re
publican and Democratic conventions
might endorse candidates for pres
ident. Despite the fact that some of the
minor candidates of the Republican
party had made sharp fights for other
candidates it was considered certain
that the Republican majority was
ready to indorse Major-fJeneral Leon
ard Wood for the presidential nomin
ation. Leaders of the state organi
zation formally announced that Wood
was their choice. The Democrats af
ter a conference, decided to indorse
President Wilson for a third term if
he decided to become a candidate.
Further indorsement by
the Demo-
crats would be contingent on the at-1
titude of the president, it was under
stood.
The non-partisan league, which has j
a party status in South Dakota, also
neia a siaie convention itaay. i

ji t .i
groups attending the other conven
tions and may not nominate a full
slate. It was reported before the dele

Fresh Eggs 82 Cents; Ask
60 Cents for Stored Eggs
Fresh eggs on the retail markets of
Richmond advanced from SO to 82
cents a dozen, Tuesday morning. The
price paid the farmer remained at 75
cents a dozen. Storage eggs, which
do not find a ready market, in Rich
mond, are 60 cents, or 22 cents cheap
er than the fresh.
Richmond dealers say there is only
the usual shortage of fresh eggs but
unanimously say there is an unusual
ly heavy demand. The high prices are
being paid with hardly any complaint.
One dealer thinks that the price of
eggs has about reached its limit and
that dollar-a-dozen eggs will not be
popular if prices go that high.

PRESIDENT
DENOUNCES
RADICALISM
Right of Government to Pro
tect People, Above the
Right of Any Class, Says
Reference to Coal Strike.
ASKS ANlARLY PEACE
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 General
recommendations on legislation to
combat the cost of living, labor un
rest, radicalism, and a readjustment
of the nation to peace time basis. were
the features of President Wilson's an
nual message to congress delivered
today.
The peace treaty, the president told
congress, will be discussed in a sepa
rate message later, as will the railroad
question.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice of
addressing congress in person, his
message was read today by the clerks.
Asks Budget System
The president's principle recom
mendations were:
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem with simplification of the income
and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system
if necessary to meet changed world
conditions, and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States is "the greatest capitalist In
the world".
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, particular
ly in the way of government farms as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the
war. to keep the United States inde
pendent of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, in recognition of ihe farm
ers' part in the war.
Measures which "will remove the
causes of political restlessness in our
body politic".
Unrest is Superficial.
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the
unrest "are superficial rather than
deep seated," and that they "arise
from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and -permanent
peace, permitting -return to normal
conditions; from the transfusion of
radical theories from seething Euro
pean centers, pending such delay;
from heartless profitering resulting
from the increase of the cost of living,
and lastly from the machinations of
passionate and malovalent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear."
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who by
violent methods would abrogate our
time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the
cost of living. Among them were ex
tension of the food control law to
peace times for the emergency; reg
ulation for transportation of foods and
inter;mte commerce; a cold storage
law Modeled after the law in New
Jersey; a law requiring marks to
show the lengths of time foods are
kept in storage and a law to secure
"competitive selling and prevent un
consciousable profits" by federal li
cense of corporations selling foods in
interstate commerce.
Asks Democratic Industry.
A long portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tions and rights of labor. "A definite
