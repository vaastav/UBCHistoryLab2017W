WHEAT GOES DOWN
ON FOREIGN NEWS
Reduced Figures in Europe Has
Effect: Com Stiffens on
Gar Scarcity.
CHICAGO. Dec. 9. With favorable
conditions attending the harvest In the
Argentine, and with cargoes from there
being freely ofTered In Europe at reduced
figures, the wheat market here yielded,
and at the close was easy. Sc to 8c be
low last night- Corn finished unchanged
to ?c higher; oats a shade to 5i?Ic. up.
apd hog products at an advance of 22
'2Ec to a half-dollar flat.
Wheat finished within a shade of bot
tom prices. During- most of the session,
however. stubbornness cropped out
whenever the market approached 96c for
the May option. At that point there
were resting orders to buy and no break
below occurred until the last quarter of
an hour, when the price went to 942c.
Do weather in the winter wheat belt
of the United States acted more or less
as counterpoise to the news from Ar
gentine. In consequence cash wheat was
nrmly held here and elsewhere, although
the demand could not be classed -as any
thing but poor. May fluctuated between
952c and 96J96c. with the close at 958
fgogc, a loss of ?c compared with twenty-four
hours previous.
Complaint of car scarcity tightened up
prices for corn. May ranged from 473c
to 472c and closed exactly tho same as
last night. 478c asked. Cash corn was
easy. Xo. 2 yellow finished at 5151Jc.
Shorts in oats were Influenced by the
strength of corn and turned buyers. May
had as high and as low levels 34S,348c
and 34c. with the finished at 34345c
a net gain of a shade.
There was a lively trade In provisions.
Pork closed 40c to 50c higher: ard. 15c

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON, Dec. 9: The Commercial Bul
letin will say of the wool market tomor
row: There, has been' no change in the sit
uation. Demand is moderate and trans
fers limited to small quantities. French
worsted spinners are the best custom
ers. Strictly staple wools are tempor
arily neglected. There js no immediate
prospect of a change for the better un
til the goods situation Improves. The
heavy weight season is expected to de
velop sufficient activity to force a larger
demand for wool. Values steady and ab
solutely no pressure to unload desirable

FISH HAS ADVANCED
S0ME1STII PIE
Advance of Two Cents Per
Pound on Salmon and
Halibut.
Fish are reported to be hisher on the
wholesale markets, and at least one re- '
tall dealer had raised the price 2c on
salmon and halibut. Meat 'markets re
main the'sam.
Xew honey was very attractive Friday.
It was t'Un honey, and was selling for
from 15c to 20c a pound. Oranges and
lemons are Improving In quality and are
settlnc a little cheaper than they were
a wek ago.
There are some excellent dried raisins
on the local market of the London layer
variety, which will take the place of
grapes, which are rapidly going off tho
market. There have been no carload
shipments of grapes for some time atid
will be no more this season.
Hay will probably go up a.s soon as
snow sets In. although It is not expected
that tills rise will bo very great. It is
likely that corn will be cheaper as soon
as the Nebraska crop Is all In. It Is just
beginning to come on the market now,
and the price will stay where It is for
several weeks.
The prlc of dairy products has not
changed and will not change, in all proba
bility, for a month yet. Bad weather will
raise the price of feed, but moEt of the
dairies have such a supply on hand that
they will not bo affected at once.
The market generally is dull and will
remain this way for about two weeks
yet, and perhaps until after the holidays..

Local Securities
John C. Cutler. Jr.. in his weekly let
ter on business conditions, says:
"With the advance of the winter sea
Eon throughout the country, there seems
to bo a healthier tone to business. Trade
during November was not altogether sat
isfactory, but there appears to be some
improvement noted lately.
"President Taft's encouraging message
was given to the public Then the sec
retary of agriculture shows that this
year's farm products broke all records,
as he estimated that the value of the
products of the farm produced in 1910
amount to the enormous sum of ?S.926.-
000. 000. So, If confidence Is restored, the
outlook for business conditions should be
come brighter.
"Locally, the approaching holidays ha v I
stimulated business In many lines. But ;
cold weather, with rain or snow, would
be welcome. Still, the days are pleas
ant, so that people can get around and
do their Christmas buying early before
the rush begins.
"The last statements of tho private,
state and national banks of our city and
state show that the banks are strong
financially and have strong reserves
Rates for money are higher than last
year, but it monev remains easy in the
east it will relax here.
"The sugar factories of Utah and Idaho
have had a fair run. Secretary of Agri
culture Wilson, speaking about the heel
sugar production In the country in 1910,
said that It 'will about equal that of 1909.
say 512.000 short tons. Its factory value
js reckoned at $51,000,000. and the fac
tory value of cane sugar at S2S. 000.000.
an amount which has been exceeded in
four years.
" 'If prospects are realized, the entire
sucar crop of factory production, beet
and cane combined, will be S59.O00 short
tons, or a production that has been ex - ;
ceeded in only one year. 1909. In fac
tory value ihe two sugar crops wll equal
about $79,000,000; and If to this be added
tho value of molasses, syrup, bcetpulp
and sorghum and maple products, the
combined value is about $97,000,000.'
"There have been a few sales of local
securities in the week, with tho market
inclined to be rather quiet."
