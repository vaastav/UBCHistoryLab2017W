We havo no time now to synorticate
this document. It is straisrht-lorward,
manly,and statesmanlike firm, patriot­
ic, and wise, and commends itfcli to the
judumcut and good conscionee of all
citizens. We shall be able hereafter to
present some of its more important fea­
tures.
THE last session of the 42d Congress
began on Monday. Tho President
message, together with the report* of
the heads of Departments, was received
in tho Senate. Several bills were
introduced, and a resolution upon the
death of Horace Greeley was consider­
ed.
In tho House, several new members
were sworn in Mr. Hanks tendered
resignation of the Chairmanship of
ths Committee of Foreign Affairs, but
it was not accepted. Speaker Blaiue
tailed Mr. Cox, of New York, to the
Chair, sad offered a resolutioo demand­
ing an investigation of the Oakes Ames
Credit Mobilier charges. Mr. Cox then
eulogised the life and services of Hor­
ace Greeley, after,which the President's
Message was read and the House ad­
journed.
Horace Greeley.
The public mind has been, in soaie
degree, prepared for the announcement
of the death of this eminent man. Ilis
very sudden and acute illness mentioned
a week ago, was quite generally accept­
ed as a rarning that it wculd prove fa­
tal. lit' is dead: aud thus ends iu a
tragedy, what begun as a farce—the
campaign of 1872
M. Greeley was ic one sense a great
man. Intellectually, he had few equals
and no superiors. We do not mean by
this, that he possessed as much accu­
rate scholarshipas some men nor that he
had that power by which the deep and
hidden mysteries of nature are solved
and utilised for the benefit of mankind.
His mind was of a different type. His
capability to analyze was most wonder­
ful, and elosely allied to it was his pow­
er of critieism. In critical analysis,
-whether of the character of men, or of
the nature of events, he stood without
peer.
His career as a journalist, running
through a period of more than thirty
years, abundantly corroborates this as­
sertion. Surrounded, as he always was,
by the greatest men in America, he
-was never of them, the least conspicu­
ous. He lather moved like a God
among the monuments of human am­
bition, leveling their crests, strengthen­
ing their bases, and shading eaeh down
into harmony -with the great mass of
mankind, making them to subsorve the
interests and to promote the reforms
necessary, in a great republic, without,
at the same time, usurping the only
prerogative of the people—the right of
self-government.
Not especially original—having but
little of the creative, Mr. Greeley sig­
nalized himself by a masterly discuss­
ion of the opinions of others. His
great controversial powers, and his am­
ple opportunity for their use, have led
liim to an extreme in their manifesta­
tion. This will to some extent account
for the lack of mental balance which
has frequently characterized him,up­
on occasions of great national signifi­
cance.
This peculiarity grew upon him as
domestic sorrows accumulated, aud the
infirmities of age increased, until he
became unconsciously its victim. It
was at this period in hi* life, that he
became*a candidate for the Presidency.
Not a year sooner would his own judg­
ment have permitted him to accept a
position so diametrically opposed to all
that he had previously advocated. The
fate of Webster, and of Clay was for­
gotten he plucked upon himself the
malady—which to them proved so fa­
tal—iu the insane belief, that it would
effect in him, a complete rejuvenation.
Vaiu hope. The crisis which proved
it, was succeeded by a moment of sani­
ty, in which In cried out, The coun­
try is gone, the Tribune is gone, and I
am gone." This was consciousness re­
asserting its sway, for the moment,
only to be dethroned forever. It
helps to prove also, that Mr. Greeley's
iniud was a grand duality. Each qual­
ity was a pair of extremes: a host in
himself, no man was moro susceptible
to influences than he: of a tempera­
ment naturally devotional, he was, nev­
ertheless, frequently profane posses­
sed of great kindness of heart, he was
sometimes terribly censorious and cru­
el having a lively sympathy with the
suffering and the needy .he presents the
anomaly of permitting one of his own
kindred to go down to the grave, de­
pendent upon the cold charity of stran­
gers. He was a paradox in everything,
and yet, more paradoxical than all,
himself waa his only complete illustra­
tion. As a study for mankind, his life
is most valuable. As a model, it
is chiefly valuable for its great indus­
try, and the effect of this, even, is some­
what modified by his many and strange
eccentricities. His career must be sha­
ded down from its wide extremes,and im­
pressions be taken from the golden mean
which meanders the current of bis tor­
tuous experience.
Two men named Moppin and Cham­
bers, were brought before a Tennessee
court the other day chargcd with mur­
dering a father and son in Coffee coun­
ty during the war. Tliey adduccd

by order of Gen. Milroy, commanding

charged.
Of a miserly man who died of soft
ening of the brain, a local apcr said
Qis head* pave away, but his hand
never did. His brain softened, but his
heart couldn't."

A TOTAL LOSS OF S2SOO
The Family «f Mr. Williams
Resided over the Store.
At one o'clock yesterday morning,
Mrs. Braden Lincoln, a watcher with
Mrs. Williams, who was sick, underta­
king to go below, fell and broke a lamp
filled with kerosene. The flames imme­
diately enveloped her and ignited the
combustibles with which the building
was filled. Mr. Williams rushed below
to save Mrs. Lincoln, but his efforts
were in vain—she perished in ihe flimes
and her body was almost entirely con­
sumed,
Not until he was terribly burned,did
Mr. Williams relinquish the hope of
saving Mrs L. He escaped through a
window, and naked—except his night
apparel—and literally roasted from his
feel to his thighs, leaving the soles of
his feet npon the frozen ground, he be­
gan to prepare for the escape of his
family. No ladder being at hand, dry
goods boxes were piled in front of the
store, and the sick and helpless—one
being an infant only twenty hours old—
were passed down over them.
Mrs. Williams maintained a remark­
able tranquility, and strange to say is
comparative comfortable. While it is
hoped that Mr* Williams will survive,
it is by DO means certain that he will
not soon yield to the overpowering in­
fluence of his fearful injuries, and in
any event, he will be hopelessly crip­
pled, and sadly disfigured, Mrs. Lin­
coln was about forty years of age, and
leaves a husband who is nearly frantic
over the terrible calamity.
The oitisens rendered every possible as­
sistance and performed prodigies.
About $500, belonging to the P. 0., and a
box of stamps being accessible, were saved.
11
r. Williams has lost everything. No mem­
ber of the tail having sufficient clothing left
to cover nakedness.
His tttal loss it not less than $2,500. The
sympathies of the people are fully aroused.
His neighbors hare alreadv raised $375, and
Austin will contribute most liberally.
Mr. Williams being clerk of the Sohool Dis­
trict, had the record* in his office, and they
were consumed.
The Are was kept from spreading only by
tearing down the office of the lion. John IT.
Wyckoff. This was effected through efficient
action of the railroad men at the station, who
were provided with long ropes and iron hooks.
With these thebuilding.was speedily demol­
ished and removed.. All his books, records,
papers and other valuables were saved. The
Coleman store took fire several times, but by
hereto efforts was sav*d.
The calamity is a horrible one, and appeals
to the benevolent impulses of every eitisea of
the eounfy.
Mr. Williams is very widely known and
universally esteemed. Mrs. Lincoln was an
amiablt and lovely woman, passionately devo­
ted to her husband. She waa likewise in active
sympathy with all the sick and n*edy among
her acquaintance.
The case evokes the liveliest feelings, and
easts a gloom over the entire community.
Laraa.—Hon. John T. Williams died of his
injuries, in great agony, at ft minutes before
10 o'eloek, a. to day The funeral services
will take place ea Sabbath next, at 2 o'clock
P, M. It is expected that a special train will
run from Austin for the accommodation of the
many friends who will desire to attend.
A FREIGHT Train, from St. Paul,
night before last,broke a rail near Med
ford, and went-off the track. The Engi­
neer was slightly injured and twelve
cars were smashed.
Another Freight, from McGregor,
fell through a bridge near Chester, and
was badly dauiag:d, although no per­
son was injured. The passenger trains
from each way were six hours late.
TIIK burial of Mr. Greeley yesterday

DKATII IN A THRESHING MACHINE.
—On Wednesday morning, the 27th
ult.., Jaines Pratt, an old and highly
respected citizen of the town of El moro,
while at work around a threshing ma
chine, aecidontly got his left hand
entangled in the gearing in such a man­
ner as to tear off the greater portion of
it. Mr. Pratt was a hale and vigorous
man. and a fatal result was not antici­
pated. A physician was called who
:idtnitiistercd anodynes to allay the pain.
The patient,however, sank into a lethar­
gic state as is supposed from nervous
rostration, and died about nino o'clock
tho evening.
Nenraful Death eftheCireat Ed­
itor, Horace Vreelry.
NFAV YORK, Nov. 30.—Mr. Greeley
i« dead. The mournful news creates a
profound sorrow throughout the city
mingled with almost a pall at its sud­
denness. There has been so much mys­
tery'and ooncealment regarding the first
appearance and progress of his illness
that the following complete review of
his last daya' illness will be read with
the deepest interest:
When the Hon. Horace Greeley first
learned the precarious condition of his
wile's health he was preparing to start
on his terrible speech making tour
through the New England States. Du
ring this absence Mr. Greeley never
slept over four hours at a time.—
Through the day he would often dose
in the car and "catch snatches of sleep,
but when awakened, either by the stop
of the train or to make a speech, his
haggard aad care-worn expression of
countenance was always more express'
ion of fatigue than any remarks he was
ever he-ird to uinke.
Meanwhile Mrs. Greeley's health hat!
been rapidly declining,and she had re
moved from Chappaqua to this city
Mr. Johuson, of No. 323 West Fifty
seventh street, had placed a suite of
rooms at her disposal, and those the in­
valid occupied with her eldest daughter,
Miss Ida, while Mr. Greeley had reoma
in the same house. It was there,while
passing sleepless nights at the bedside
of his dying wife, that Horace Greeley
first began to show signs of great men­
tal depression.
Ou one occasion when the opposition
press was criticisiug his great Pitts­
burgh speech, he said, If they make
the issue that I am the rebel candidate
I am bound to be defeated."
This consideration seemed to weigh
on his mind, and often he would clasp
his hands to his head and cry out,
Oh Oh!" as though suffering
from intense pain. He was advised to
continue his wood chopping matinees,
and though severely chafed by the ac­
counts of them published iu the New
York Times, he still pursued his open
air exercise. On one occasion,at Chap
paqua, he was accompanied by Mr.
Johnson and his son. Mr. Johnson,Jr.,
chopped down the lower limb of a hem­
lock tree, which narrowly missed the
fathci's head. What do you mean,"
cried out Mr. Johnson, Sr., "Do you
want to kill me, Willie
I wish somebody would kill me,"
responded Mr. Greeley in a voice of ex­
treme sadness.
At length on the morning of Octo­
ber 30th, Mrs. Greeley died. When
he was iuformed of his wife's death, he
wrung his hands and cried like a
child aud said: Oh why did you
not let me sit up with her. Why did
you send me off to bed My poor wife!
my poor wife!"
Two daya afterward Mrs. Greoley
waa buried. The remains were followed
to the grave by a large concourse of
people, all of whom 'noticed Mr. Gree­
ley's grief. He returned after the fu­
neral to the residence of Mr. Johnson,
and instead of interesting himself about
his daughters and the future gave way
wholly to dejection. It was then he
showed the first positive evidence of
mental derangement.
It was noticcd about this time that
he would tell his private business to
every one with whom he came in con­
tact. and to each one he told a different
story of his troubles and the infidelity
of his supposed friends. He would at
times denounce the Democratic party
whom he would accuse of coming out
for the Administration. Then he would
violently criticise the course pursued by
the opposition newspapers, aud espe­
cially by the mismanagement of the
Tribune, and his fatal mistake in allow­
ing his name to be used as a candidate
for the Presidency.
Mr. Alvin J. Johnson was hb most
intimate friend. One evening while
holding his hand Mr. Greeley said to
him:
"Alvin -Johnson do you know
made a terrible mistake about Mr. Da­
na He was right about On to Rich­
mond Yes I am satisfied now that
he was right about it."
Often after that, when he was unable
to sleep, and while his disease was yet
in its iocipiency, Mr. Greeley would
take Mr. Johnson to his room,and with
hands clasped he would impart to hiui
the most intimate secrets of his past
One morning he said to Mr. Johnson,
as the latter was leaving the house,
Meet me at the Tribune office at 2
o'eloek this afternoon, I have a private
communication to make to you."
Mr. Johnson waa there at tbe ap­
pointed hour, but Mr. Greeley declined
saying anything, but said
Meet me at Sam Sinclair's at six
to-night, 1 want to sec you."
Mr. Johnson was there at the tirno
and found Mr. Greeley asleep. Mr.
Sinclair and George Ripley were in an­
other room. Mr. Greeley slept for some
time but when he at length awoke his
mind seemed gone. Mr. Sinclair be
ged him to stay there and go to bed
He quietly assented, and then, turning
to Mr. Johnson, said
Alvin Johnson, take me home with
you, won't you!"
Mr liipley also begged Mr. John­
son to do so,but although it was early in
the evening, it was miduight before
they reached 57th street.
Some days before that Dr. Edward
Rayard, the late Mrs. Greeley's medi­
cal attendant, noticed that Mr. Greeley
had a restless, feverish appearanee. He
is a hoincepathist, but kiudly prescribed
for his old friend, as he correctly ima­
gined Ire needed an anodyne. On re­
turning home the night above mention­
ed, Mr. Johnson mixed one of the pow­
ders and gave it to Mr. Greeley. The
latter, in taking it, spilt half'of it over
his shirt front, and *.vhen reminded that
he had done so, he Baid, Oh, never
mind it—it's just as good outside as
in." The following morning Mr. Gree­
ley waa more restless and haggard in
appearanee than ever. Mr. Johnson
sent for his family physician, Dr. Krac
kowizer, chief surgeon of the German
hospital. Dr. Krackowizer recognized
the case as a serions one, and at once
resorted to the most energetic treat­
ment. At first it seemed as though the
malady woujjl yield to the treatment,
and at times the patient became gentle
in disposition, perfectly rational and in
apparently good health. It was during
this period that he wrote his card resu­
ming the editorship of the Tribune,
published on Nov. 7.
Mr. Greeloy never again visited the
Tribune editorial room. To a friend
whom he met three days later, he said
in a hopeless tone of voice:
I do not go to the Tribune office
any more. I havo no business thero,
but I want a thousand dollars. I must
have a thousand dollars, if you can get
it for nie*"
After a long pause, as if he had sud­
denly forgotten what he wns talking
about, he said, 1 am ruined." When
bis mind was called to the thousand
dollars, Mr. Greeley told his friend that
he might leave tho money with the
cashier of the Tribune, and it might
reach bim, but he did not go to the
Tribune office any more.
I don't eare for politics, and would
not go cn the cars to Washington to be
President." What I do feel," con­
tinued Mr. Greeley, is tho loss of tny
wife, who has been uiy companion for
nearly forty years. 1 have watched by
her bedside night and day, and now I
am completely prostrated from anxiety
and want of sleep, but am obliged to
come back to the Tribune, where my
services are needed
After conversing further with Mr.
Greeley, who promised to dine with his
visitor at his home, Col. Allen took his
leave and has mt seen him since.
The Sun reporter asked the Colonel
whether the vile rumors that Mr. Gree­
ley l.ad spent most of his money on the
election were true. The Colonel scout­
ed the idea as preposterous.
On the 13th of November, RufusT.
Andrews was requested to meet Gree­
ley at the house of a mutual friend,aud
wan shocked to find Mr. Greeley so
changed and bearing evident symptoms
of iiisauity. The uiedieal treatment
Mr. Greeley was receiving proved inef­
fectual. Medicine becamo of no avail,
and reason gave way.
On Nov. 20th Dr. Rrown, superin­
tendent of the Klo'tmingdale Asylum,
and Dr. Geo. C. CItoat*, proprietor of
a private asylum in Westchester coun­
ty, were called to meet Dr. Krocker
for consultation. A careful examina­
tion of the patieut waa made and they
unanimously pronounced him suffering
from acute mania, and entirely insane.
The ahock was a severe one to the
friends who were intrusted with the se­
cret but after due deliberation they
became sufficiently rcconc.lcd to the
fact to consent to remove Mr. Greeley
to Dr. Choate's residence, near Pleas
antville, Wcstehcster county. The
house is pleasantly situated about one
mile and a half from the town, on a
hill half a mile from a road to the near­
est house It is comfortably furnished,
has handsome grounds surrounding,and
though known to the neighbors as a
private lunatic asylum, it has the ap­
pearance of the cuuntry seat of some
wealthy gentleman,and there Mr. Gree­
ley was conveyed last Thursday week.
When he was brought down stairs in
Mr. Johnson's house, in front of which
Mr. Stewart was waiting with a close
carriage. Mr. Johnson handed him
his traditional white hat aud coat.
It was deemed best that Mr. Greeley
should remaiu over uight at the resi­
dence of Mr. John R. Stewart,of Tar
r«lown.
Mr. Greeley seemed to know that he
was on the way to an asylum. At first
ic told Mr. Stewart that he would not
leave his house. It was only after Mr.
and Mrs. Stewart promised to call and
see him every day that he consented to
go. Before leaving Mr Stewart's res­
idence he walked through the grounds.
Suddenly stopping and gazing intently
at two small shrubs, he said
We must put the cedar in the
ground, for it will freeze hard before
Tuesday."
Mr. Stewart became alarmed and
then endeavored to. place hiui iti a close
age for removal to Dr. Choate's
residence. Mr. Greeley cried bitterly,
and for a long time refused to go. He
repeatedly said to Mr Stewart:
Dou't let tbem take me away. I
want to stay here with you."
It was only when urged by Auntie
Lawson aud Mrs. Stewart that he con­
sented to go with Mr. Stewart in the
carriage. The day after his arrival at
Dr. Choate's, the disease de/eloped it­
self hourly in all its intensity. The
horrors of acute mania wero hourly
witnessed, and he was violent in his ac­
tion. The most skillful treatment at
the hands of experienced physicians
proved of no avail and the patient grad
ually sank into a state of unconscious­
ness.
The inflammation af the brain made
the stouiach sympathise with it to such
an extent that Mr. Greeley refused and
was really unable to take food in any
form. He gradually became worse and
failed to recognize his own relatives
and tbe few intimate friends who visit­
ed him.
At one time he tore the watch, presented to
him by,the employees of tbe Tribune, apart,
and again he threw a kerosene lamp on the
floor, setting tbe floor on fire, and narrowly
escaping being burnt to death. As his strength
left hiin he becamc more quiet but did uot
show any signx of consciousness until about
an hour before bis doath.
Mr. Greeley passed a very restless night
Thursday—he raved -incoherently all night,
threw bia arms wildly about, and rolled aud
tossed about from one side of the bed to the
other. At eight a.m. yesterday he remained
unconscious, his extremities gradually became
cold and he waa motionless in his bed* Dr.
Cboate, Miss Ida Greeley, Mr*. John R.Stew
art and Aunty Lawson were in constant at­
tendance, but Ur. Greeley did not recognise
them.
During tbe afternoon he appeared to be
praying. Onoc he said in a loud,strong voice:
I know that my redeemor lirctlr" An hour
later he repeated several times, I died before
I was born," and at precisely four o'eloek he
alarmed those about bim by saying in his nat­
ural voice: "IT is DOME." Those were Itis
last words. He then agaiu relapsed into a
state of unconsciousness. His respiration be­
came weaker, his extremities colder, and bis
face bore the unmistakable imprint of death,
and he was pulseless at the wriat, and thus re­
mained until six p. in.
The room in which Mr. Greeley died wns a
large one on the northwest corner of tbe first
floor of Dr. Choate's house.. It was a bright
one. neatly carpeted, but devoid of chairs or
pictures, ornaments, wash-basin, or any small
articles of furniture. All these had been re­
moved when Mr. Greeley first manifested evi­
dences of violence. Bi fore they wer» remov­
ed,however,he on one occasion broke his watch
to piecos, and at another time threw a kero­
sene lamp on the floor. The burning oil ig­
nited the carpet, and had it uot been that an
alarm was immeuiately given, the house might
have been destroyed by fire.
The disease first developed itself violently
two weeks ago to-niabt, at a meeting of tbe
trustees of the Tiibune, held at the residence
of Mr. Samuel Sinclair. The next day Dr.
Krackowiser was called in by Alvin J. John­
son. Then came the consultation and the
unanimous vcrdictof the doctors was that
acute mania had set in. The seal placed upon
Dr. Choate's lips in relation to the aetual con­
dition and treatment of his patient and the
development of the disease, deprives history
of an important cbapter in the life of Horace
Greeley. Nervous exoiteuicnt, disappointed
hopes and loss of deep,doubtless produced tho
fatal disordsr, while a terrible mental strain,
proving too great for his weakened physical
system, hastened tho result. His funeral will
probably take place on Tuesday from Dr. Cha­
pin's church.
OBSCENE PUBLIOATONS.—We are
pleased to note that the polieo authorities
of New York eityare taking activesteps
for the aupprcssion of obscene and oth­
er disreputable publications in that city.
During the years of corrupt rule there,
this branch of infamy has flourished to
a grievous extent. Scores of the vilest
miscreants have been engaged in the
publications, or sale of obscene books,
papers, pictures, ctc., and these abomi­
nable publications are openly advertised
in all the sporting papers, and by hun­
dreds of otherwise reputable newspa­
pers in various parts of the country.
The postal laws of the country are
deemed adequate for the virtual sup­
pression of this heinous occupation,pro
iding the postal authorities can have
the co-opcration of municipal and State
officers. Rut this cannot be accom­
plished without the activo co-opcaation
of the press. A simultaneous move­
ment on their part will suppess this in
quity in one month's time.

Alcohol, has at last been summoned

FRANKFORD, Minn., Dec. 2, 1872.
Editor Tmnncript.1
SIR 'The leather here during last
month was so cold and stormy that it
occasional considerable dissatisfaction
among the Frankfordians The most
violent snow storm of the month occu:
red about night fall on tho 2Gth ult.,
accoutfanied by a wind sufficiently
brisk to keep the flakes moving, and to
render pedestrian ism difficult aud dan­
gerous. The fates having decreed that
the storm should take place while the
writer hereof was away from his dorni
cil, it came down upon him like an
avalanche of icebergs, artd resulted in
hie getting lost on a wide prairie. Do­
ing somewhat -reverential he did not
"bid the Storm King stay his haud," but
struck out in search of more comfortable
quarters, and soon succceded in finding
a good Samaritan who had enough pity
to take bim in for the night.
YANKEE.
Drlaklai la Boston.
The. Boston Utrohl, which is not
claimed auywhere as an advocate of
tempcrancer furnishes the following fig­
ures
These seventy-and-six persons who
are addicted to the .use of intoxicating
drinks, made customers enough to sup­
port in tip-top shape one first-class li­
quor-selling establishment. On an av­
erage, it is perfectly safe to say that
these people will pay out thirty cents
per day for intoxicants Indeed, that
is a very low average but at that fig­
ure they would expend during the day
922 80, or for the week $159.60, and
for the. year $8,209.10. Now it is safe
to say at least seventy per cent, of this
amount, or about $6,000. is clear profit,
which is certainly enough to support
one establishment in good shape. Rut
this is not all the strain that is made
npon the financial resources of these
people. Take this number of habitu­
al drinkers, and have them of the same
rank and position in society as those
who are arraigned this morning, and
they will pay at least thrse fines a year,
or $21. each, for court expenses—$8,
000 a year to be charged to the rum
account of these seventy-six persons.
Multiply this by 22,000 people that are
arraigned during the year for drunken­
ness, and the figures will show that their
rum account for the year will amount
to $1,125,000, and if any one will take
the trouble to figure in the incidental
expenses of these people while out on a
drunk, it will bo very easy to at least
double this aggregate, without saying a
word about the very worst feature of
all, that of the suffering and shame
within tbe home eirclo."
