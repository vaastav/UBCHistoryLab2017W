THE MESSAGE
IN CONGRESS
The Presidents Words Are
Strongly Approved
DHOSUAL ATTENTION BY MMBERS
Admittedly an Able Stato Paper
and Characteristic of Its Author
Committoes to Suggest How to
Honor McKinloys Memory The
Houso Adjourns Until Friday
Sonato to Moot at Noon Today
In the Senate and House of Representa
tives yesterday the first annual message
of President Roosevelt to Congress was
read The docrment was somewhat long
hut was far from tedious On the con
trary there was interest In every line
and members of both houses listened with
unusual attention during the more than
two hours occupied In Its reading
But few messages have been written
with such choice diction such force of ex
pression and pointed epigrams as was that
which President Roosevelt communicated
to the national legislative body yesterday
This was the universal sentiment of all
who listened to the reading of the docu
ment
A Mnenhlccnl Hulocy
Particularly beautiful was the eloquent
tribute which the President raid to the
life character and public works of his
distinguished predecessor stirring was
the narration of the elects and circum
stances attending his tragic death and
scathing was the denunciation of that
hated doctrine which prompted his as
sassination It was a magnificent eulogy
couched In the language of a scholar and
an crator and was particularly touching
and sympathetic
Approiul of the Message
It was generally agreed that the cntlro
message was characteristic of the writer
strikingly pointed lucid and sound in
doctrine and argument Members of both
parties Democvats and Republicans
united In endorsing it as a fctrong and able
Etate paper although with scmo of the
policies advocated the minority party will
no doubt take Issue
In both houses the reading was fol
lowed closely nearly all of the members
remaining in their scats until the con
clusion of the reading This constituted
almost the entire business transacted in
Congress yesterday
To Honor llxe Late President
When the reading was finished resolu
tions were offered in both chambers for
the appointment of suitable committees
to consider that portion of the message
referring to the death of the lats Presi
dent McKInley and report what token of
respect and affection It may seem proper
for Congress to take to express the deep
sensibility of the nation over the unhappy
event In the Senate the resolution was
offered by Senator Torakcr senior Sen
ator from the State of which the late
President was a citizen and in the House
by Representative Grosvcnor the senior
member from Ohio and his long time per
sonal friend Then both bouses ndjourned
as a further mark of respect to the de
ceased the Senate until today and the
House until Friday
FciTcr Spectators Present
The crowd of spectators in the galleries
was smaller by far yesterday than on the
opening day and the ladles who were nu
merous en Monday were few on ycistcr
day There was too a scarcity of flow
ers although several members were hon
ored with floral tributes
THE DAY IN THE HODSE
flcrabers Show Great Interest In the
Message
The floor of the House usually a scene
ef turmoil life and activity was as quiet
end orderly yesterday as a church ajdf
toriutr during services while tho message
of the President was being read Nearly
till of the members were In their respec
tive seats and there was little or no mov
ing about
The noisy hum of conversation which
usually pervade3 the ball even when im
portant legislative business Is being
transacted was stilled and the voice of
the reading clerk resounded clearly and
distinctly through the spacious chamber
Members gave the strictest heed and at
tention to the reading and particularly to
that portion the sort of preface to the
messagp In which thi President narrated
the tragic death of his predecessor and
denounced the doctrine which was the
sponsor for that sad event
Attention Inld by All
The members listened reverently as if
to an eloquent funeral oration Kven
when the routine affairs of government
and the statement of the Soing3 of the
departments and the advocacy of sieciflc
legislation was being read a vast majori
ty of the representatives remained in
their scats and did not withdraw until the
tdjournment was taken
Thero was but little business preceding
the reception cf the message Immediately
eftcr prayer by the chaplain Representa
tives Woods of California and Cooper of
Texas who were absent on the opening
day were summoned before the tar of the
House and the prescribed oath was ad
ministered to them by the Speaker
Itulcs Committee Named

Messrs Dalzell of Pennsylvania Gros
vcnor of Ohio Republicans and Messrs

THE CABINET WELL PLEASED
Insulnr Case Decisions Discussed at
the Meeting
Gratification at the decisions in the in
sular cases handed down by tho Supreme
Court ou Monday was expressed by the
President and all members of the Cabinet
at the meeting jestcrday It was agreed
that the decision In the fourteen diamond
rings case undoubtedly left the situation
up to Congress for legislative action with
the result that their enactments would
be sustained by the Supreme Court The
decision by no means found the members
of tho Cabinet unprepared
Attorney General Knox gave a clear in
terpretation of the case to the members
of the Cabinet Secretary Root and Sec
retary Gage took an active part in the
discussion which followed
The field for legislation as It now lies
was discussed from varicu3 viewpoints It
is probable that tho President may send
to Congress a special mesage on the
subject
Secretary Gage stated that he estimated
the amount of duties which would neces
sarily bo refunded on account of the de
cision at less than 1000000
Secretary Wilson who Is In Chicago
was the only absentee from the meeting
BOX TRAVELERS
FEARFUL VOYAGE
BATTLED WITH RATS IN THE DARK
rorccd His Way Out of HIn Ciuc to
Get Air Trip Lndcrtnkeil in
uu Effort o Get Work
In America
NEW YORK Dec 3 Johann Deck the
German housepainter who locked himself
up in a box and sailed for this country as
freifeht in the hold of tho Hamburg-American
liner Palatia whence he was rescued
yesterday afternoon after having spent
sixteen dajs In and out of his box below
hatches recovered sufficiently this after
nocn to tell something of his trip
Becks story was gathered In fragments
as he Is still In suih a weak condition that
he cannot speak above a whicper and can
ray but a couple of words at a time He
is almost entirely deaf and all questions
that were put to him today had to be
Fhoutcd in his ear His two weeks and
two daysln the hold of the liner have re
duced him to a shadow There is every
rfason to believe however that ho will
get well although It will be a long time
before he Is able to leave the hospital
JVot n Profession Traveler
Beck says that he Is not a fugitive
from Justice that he is not a professional
box traveler and that he did not per
form the feat on a wager He Is a painter
by trade and having met with reverses
decided to come here and try his fortune
He did not have enough money to pay
his passage and so hit upon the box
scheme
When Beck decided to come over here
ho spent what little money he had In fil
ing up the box with straw and burlap and
putting in a supply of food He then
went to the ofHce of the American Ex
press Company and told the clerk that
there was a box he wanted to send to
America on the Palatia Then he went
home got In the box and awaited the
expressmans coming
He was almost stifled in the box and
the only way that he could get sudden
air was to raise the box cuter a trifle
For five davs Beck remained In the box
Then he realized that he would uic unless
he got cut He finally found a weak spot
in the side of the box and succeeded In
forcing two of the boards After that It
was a comparatively easy matter o get
out
Buttled With Until
Beck rays that he had more air when
he got cut of the box but that he had not
been out a day before the rats discovered
him and gathered around in the dark He
tried to drive them aay but they al
ways came back again and finally they
attacked him running all over him and
biting at his hands and face He finally
got back In his box to avoid them
Beck has not a very clear recollection
of all that happened during the lat week
In the bold For days he savs he would
lie on the fait bags only men inn when the
rats attack became so fierce that ho could
not stand it He had no water and bis
coffee failed to quench his thirst

ENGLISH EYES
London Press Comments on
tlic Message
IMPRESSED BY ITS CONSERVATISM
Roforonces to Reciprocity Viowod
as a Step Backward Document
Said to Mark Beginning of a Pe
riod of Heroic Legislation
LONDON Dec 3 President Roosevelts
message to the American Congress is the
subject of conspicuous editorials in a ma
jority of the newspapers The comments
are generally appreciative aud the docu
ment by Its construction equally with
Its contents is regarded as remarkable
bearing the Impress oj Mr Roosevelts
strong personality
Tho Standard Is Impressed by the
cautiousness as well as the breadth of
the Presidents views It says there is
nothing in the message that is revolu
tionary nothing to alarm property own
ers or to disturb the Innate American re
spect for tho sanctity of individual rights
and nothing that need in tho smallest de
gree excite anxiety or apprehension
abroad
Protection the ICeynute
The language regarding trusts is mod
erate and reasonable In the reference
to commercial policy protection is the
Keynote of the Presidents doctrine Mr
Roosevelts references to foreign affairs
show an excellent spirit Thero is little
to which exception can bo taken
His lmguage In reference to the Mon
roe Dctrlne although scrupulously
guarded is uncompromising In directness
He does not Interpret the doctrine as
some of its more fanatical advocates do
jet It must be admitted that he carries
the principle far enough
A cw Ipoeh of Legislation
The Telegraph views the message as
the opening of an epoch of heroic legisla
tion It predicts that the United State
within twenty years will be the second
naval and mercantile power of the world
Her mercantile development it says will
provide Great Britain with the greatest
trade question with which she has ever
had to grapple
It adds that the references to trusts and
reciprocity contain nothing calculated to
increase the European dread of danger
On the contrary tho President sajs
much which should help to diminish that
infinitely exaggerated panic
The Telegraph says it does no doubt
that a law compelling trusts to be con
ducted as suggested by the message would
impair and might profoundly injuro
Americas competitive power
Question of Reciprocity
The references to reciprocity do not
promise adequate cxccuticn of Mr Mc
Klnleys far slgbted views It is difficult
to sec how the United States hope to gain
important facilities in foreign markets
without offering more important conces
sions in their own than tho menage sug
gests
The Chronicle remarks upon the
great tenderness shown to protectionist
susceptibilities Regarding reciprocity
and treatment of trusts the message Is
cautious and tentative Tho President
seems so deeply Impressed by Americas
commercial prosperity as to be afraid of
altering any of Its conditions
The Chronicle approves the proposals
for dealing with the dangers of trusts
and sas that the regulations to protect
the public from gigantic frauds are far
too Ineffective both In Great Britain and
America It adds that the whole tenor
of the message is most conservative In
the matter of home affairs and reform it
rcvcal3 an Invincible determination to
gain and hold first place in international
enterprise
A Model Proj rnmme
While the anti anarchist proposals con
tained in the message are generally ap
proved by Implication the Morning Post
alone devotes special attention to them
It warmly commends President Roose
velts refusal to listen to the cant against
antl anarchlst legislation It thinks the
message Is a model of a practical business
ptogramme and say3 that the declaration
concerning trusts clears the air which
has long been overcharged with Ignorant
declamation
The paper Is impressed by the conserv
atism of the message which it declares
docs not contain the smallest challenge to
the political machine It sas in conclu
sion that Mr Roosevelt goes out of his
way to conciliate the protectionists
His panegyric on the wisdom of protec
tion as a policy Is somewhat retrogressive
in comparison with the last words of Mr
McKInlcy

RICHMOND Va Dec3 A story which
passes tho bound3 of romance was re
vealed here this aftornocnj by Judge Ber
rynian Green of Danville a member of
the Constitutional Convention
During the civil war1 ttte directors of
a bank at Danville Va turned the pro
ceeds into gold and each took 43000 After
tho conflict was over all tho money was
returned with tho exception of a sum en
trusted to a director named Waddill He
stated that the money hed been forcibly
taken from him by a Federal soldier
Suit at Law Followed
His story was not believed and suit was
brought to recover tho money Judge
G cen was Waddills counsel and tho
caso was decided in his favor The com
munity however regarded Waddill nnd
his wife with suspicion until their deatns
some years ago Shortly after the re
organization of the bank all its assets
were purchased by the Jate Mayor W I
Suthcrlln of Danville whose daughter
the wife of Col Francis L SmitJ a mem
ber of the Const tutional Convention from
Danville fell heir to hl3 possessions
Now cornea the strange part of the
story Today as Judge Green the only

him with a letter It proved to be from
a man in Ohio whose name Is withheld
who acknowledged that ho hod during the

of a Provious Address Annual
Election of Officers Hold
Tho annual ircetlng of the District of
Columbia Society Sons of the Revolution
at the Hotel Barton last night was en
livened by the attempted Injection of a
pro Boer speech in the course of the even
ings proceedings
Archibald Hopkin3 President of tho
District Society was in the chair and
after the reading of the annual rcpo a of
the officers the Rev Dr Alexander
Mackay Smlth was introduced as the
speaker of the evening
A Pntrlotlc AJdreis
Dr Mackay Smlth spoke of the events
of approximately a century ago He re
ferred particularly to the purchase of
Louisiana the invention of the steamboat
and the abolition of the payment of tribu
tary tolls by America to the Barbary
States as the three great events in tho
early part of the last century which con
tributed so much to the advancement of
this country The sale of tho Louisiana
territory to America by France was not
made he said with any feeling of friend
liness but was forced by Napoleon In the
hope that America would become a dan
gerous rival to England his enemy His
remarks were of patriotic tenor and were
greeted with applause
An Ohjection Interposed
When he had concluded Charles F Bea
man arose and rlaiming tho atentlon of
the chair announced that he felt called
upon to protest agnlnst some of the state
ments Just made As Dr Mackay Smlth
spoke at the request of the committee ou
speakers of which Charles II Campbell
is chairman tho last named gentleman
and several other members objected to
what they deemed a discourtesy to the
spcikcr of tho evening
If we are not Imbued with tho sars
spirit for liberty as were our ancestors
exejaimed Mr Heaman then let us aban
don our society and
Sir Cnmphcll Protests
At this point Mr Campbell addressed
thechalr and declared that Mr Bcamans
language was objectionable and should not
be permllicd
The presiding officer ruled that Mr Bja
man was out of order a3 he was not an
invite 1 speaker but Lad held the licor only
by unanimous consent of the m cling
The nominating committee on officers had
rr turned to the hall Just as Dr Mackay
Smith began his address and when their
report was declared to be the subject prop
erly before the meetiDg Mr Bearnan took
his scat and tho Incident closed
The Uucomiuernhle lioers
Before arousing the protests which put
an end to his remarks Mr Bearcan said
his ancestors had fought at the battle of
Icxlngton and that the same spirit
which was there Is behind the brave men
who are now struggling for liberty in
Africa From Information which he has
Mr Bearnan stated that he could assure
the audience that the war In Africa would
never be finished It was Just about this
time that ho suggested that under cer
tain conditions the society had better be
abandoned
Mr Campbell stated after the meeting
that as chairman of tho committee on
speakers he felt that It would have been
a great Injustice to the speaker of the
evening to allow Mr Beaman to en
ter any protest against anything which
the former bad said As a matter of fact
Mr Beamans remarkB did not appear to
be in answer to any proposition advanced
ty the Rev Dr Mackay Smlth
A Successful Mectinc

considered by the members of tho society
to have been the most successful held in
voars The reports of the different
officers show the organizations to be grow
ing in membership and to be In a very
healthy financial condition On President

ful silver cup which was presented to the

zation cf the latter body

erous applause by the members Ho re
ferred to the Increase of membership

tary and said It would be further in
creased if the older members would emu

Analyst Testifies for Mrs
Bonines Defence
D8 SCHAEFFER CONTRADICTED
Evidoncoa of Kod Corpu3clo3 Dis
covered on Lining of Collar by
Test Expert Dr RuQn Found
Garment Torn Whon Examined
When Criminal Cotirt No 1 was opened
yesterday morning an air of gloom per
vaded the chamber Without the sullen
greyness of the November skies and the
steady downpour of rain so darkened the
interior that the ga3 was lighted The
flickering yellow glare shone or the faces
of an audience that filled every seat and
occupied all the available standing room
despite the storm of the day
Mrs Bonine came In aecompinled by
her husbani two boys three Isters and
her husbands steadfast friend Mr Dtr
Witt She woro a black Gslnsborough
hat a pink flowered waist with a short
walking skirt and held a rain coat over
one of bcr arm3 Her face vva3 covered
with a dotted veil She seemed to be in
good spirits making constant suggestions
to her lawyers and conversing with her
husband and children
Sirs Honlne More Animated
Dull desparlng sorrow saddens every
line of Mr Bonines face Through most
of the day he sat with his eyes closed as
If oblivious to his surroundings Tha
fact that her defence Is cow in progrea
seems to have animated Mrs Bonine with
more interest in the proceedings and she
hang3 on every word uttered by the wit
nesses in her behalf
The testimony offered by Dr Scbacffer
last Saturday to the effect that not only
did he fail to discover any blood stains
on the wrapper worn by Mrs Bonine the
night of the tragedy but asserting posi
tively it had never been washetLsvas flat
ly contradicted by the last witness called
in Mrs Bonines defence yesterday even
ing Dr Sterling Ruffln
Dr Ruffln is a graduate of the Colum
bian University of this city and has prac
ticed medicine here for nearly ten years
During that period he has given much
study to the different methods of testing
for the presence of blood spots particu
larly In connection with a course In medi
cal jurisprudence which he conducted in
Columbian University Dr RufUn has a
strong face and speaks with a decided
Southern accent
The Wrapper Badly Torn
He testified that he first examined the
wrapper In the presence of Dr Schacffe
at the latters oQce and made his ob
servations In conjunction with Dr James
Carroll He found the Ieeves of the
wrapper very much torn and there were
large rents in other portions of It indi
cating a tear by putting ha hand through
It He first examined It with a hand lens
the property of Dr Scbaeller and was
then permitted to take samples from the
gown which evidenced discoloration He
exhibited two cf these specimens cut
from the velvet of the trimmings
I discovered positive traces of red
Mcod corpuscles on the duck lining I
arrived at this conclusion after employ
ing four tests used by analysis for such
investigation ho said
What were those tests doctor en
quired Mr Douglass
Several Tests Employed
I used the Guyac and Haeman crystal
tests which are chemical in their nature
as well as the microscopic and spectro
scopic tests
Dr Schaeffer testified that he used only
the microscopic test which he consid
ered the only conclusive one and ex
pressly disclaimed that the Ouyae test
was authoritative The spvtroacopic lest
of which Dr Schaeffer made no mention
in his testimony represents tha furthest
development of the mlcoscoplc method
of investigation
The Condition of the Wrapper
In connection with the torn condition of
the wrapper thero lurks somewhere a
mystery The defence of course intend
to provo through Dr Raffins statements
that the present condition of the gar
ment was the result of a struggle On
the other hand tho Government has been
gravitating toward a theory without cast
ing any reflections that the wr pper has
been tampered with since it went out of
the possession of Mrs Bonine
Deteetive Carl Flather summoned to
the stand yesterday evening by the de
fence stated that Lieutenant Moore tied
the wrapper in a parcel and instructed
him to deliver it to Dr Schaeffer which
he did Flather was unable to say wheth
er the wTapper was torn or not when he
received It
Considerable time was consumed yes
terday by counsel on both sides in de
bating the right of the defence to Intro
duce in evidence a piece of velvet cut
from the collar of the wrapper which had
been experimented on by Achllle E Burk
lin who is connected with a local dyeing
establishment Mr Burklia stated that
he had eradicated a discoloration from
the goods by the simple use of a spengo
and ordinary water The discoloration
was presumably a bloodstain
The Prosecutions Objeetlun
Mr Gould objected to this evidence S3
irrelevant upon the ground that the wlt
ress lone cvDerience made him
ncient In matters of this nature and that
there could be no fair comparison between
his woik ana that of an Inexperienced
person such as the defendant Mr Ful
ton contended tbat the witness method
was such a idmple one that t c2li be
known to alrOSi anyone
We value this testimony particularly
he argued because it will show the ab
solute unreliability of Dr Schaaffers
Justice Anderson thought It wa not fair
to Br Schaeffer to admit the dyers state
ment because the doctor bad not used
such n test Mr Douglas protested
strongly against the Judges tuling Ha
said-
Your honor we aro confronted by a
two fold proposition Dr Schaeffer posi
tively said that the wrapper had not been
washed Dor could he discover blood staln3
on It I think we should be allowed to
disprove this by the witness
Mr Gould could not remember Dr
Schaeffer so testifying and the record
wa3 sent for The record showed that t
had given testimony to that effect and
further Dr SchaeBr had said that tho
velvet collar could not havo been cleaned
without destroying tho nap and he had
discovered no such result
The court refused to admit the testi
mony but Burklra was allowed to show
