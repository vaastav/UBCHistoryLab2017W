Mr. Iloar'a Promotion?Ilia Kncceaaor In tbe
Cabinet.
The nomination of Mr. Iloar to the Supreme Court
or the United Stales to-ilay by the President created
little surprise. The matter for some time has been
rumored and stated on various authorities. This
promotion or Mr. Hoar creates a vacancy in the
Cabinet. It is understood that the appointment will
be given to Pennsylvania. Two names are men
tioned in this connection, Renjamin Harris Urewster
and William strong. It is understood hai the Presi
dent sent ror Judge Strong several days since, and tho
gentleman came here in obeuiencc to the summons.
There are various rumors as to the object oi Judge
Strong's visit. Tho prevailing impression is that it
had something to do with tne succession to the scat
of Judge Grler on the Supreme bench. I can state,
though this was a subject or consideration, the name
or Mr. Strong stands more prominently than any
other for the Attorney Generalship. I understand
upon equally good authority that Mr. Strong's name
will be sent In as Attorney General as soon
as tbe nomination or Mr. Hoar is con
firmed. Mr. Strong is a native or Connecti
cut, was educated at I'lainfleld Academy
and Yale College. Arter teaching school ror a few
years he was admitted to the bar In Philadelphia In
1832. About a year after he began tho practice ol
his profession at Reading, Berks county. Pa. He
wus olccted to the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Congress
irom the Iicrks district. Upon retiring from Con
gress he resumed his profession in Reading until
1857, when he was elected Judge of the Supreme
Conrt of Pennsylvania tor fifteen years and removed
to Philadelphia. In the beginning of the war Ju<lxc
Strong became an ardent republican, and ever since
has been a prominent member or the Union League
of Philadelphia. The Judge is sixty years of age,
tall and slender. He bears the appearance or a
much younger man.
Mr. MrKenan's Jmlirmhli..
There are no grounds Tor the statements, as far as
Pennsylvania is concerned, that the confirmation or
Judge McKenan for the Third circuit, is In doubt.
Neither senator Cameron nor Scott will raise any
objection.
Decline of American Commerce?Address of
New York Shipbuilder)* to the Consres
atonal Committee*? No Bonntics Needed tor
Encouragement of Ameriran Mechanics.
A delegation of New York gentlemen, interested
tn the various branches of shlpouiiding, arrived
here this morning for the purpose of presenting
their views on the causes of the declinj of Amerl
Commerce and the remfcdy therefot to the Congres
sional committee which was appointed to investi
gate that subject during the last session. Tlie New
> ork delegation consisted of the following gentle
men:?Messrs. D. D. Westervelt, L. H. Boole, Wil
liam Fonlkes, T. F. Rowland, Joshua Youags, John
K. Hoffmlre, William Rowland, Robert A. Russell,
Thomas Stack and David A. TalT. On
their arrival here they were received by
Congressman Harvey C. Calkin, or New York city,
who Introduced them to the prominent members of
the House and contrived a special meeting of the
committee on the causes of the decline in American
commerce, so as to enable the delegation to present
their views without unnecessary delay. The meet
ing took place shortly after one o'clock, Congress
man Lynch, of Maine, presiding. Mr. T. F. Rowland
opened the proceedings by a few remarks, ex
plaining I he object of the delegation, ana then intro
duced Mr. D. I). Westervelt, who read the following
jpper;?
New York, Dec. 14, iHf.o.
lion. John Lynch. Chairman of the Special Con
gressional Committee on Navigation Interests:?
Sin?The undersigned, a committee appointed by
the New York Association for tiie Restoration of
American Shipping Interests, resf>ectfully beg leave
to call your attention to the following lacts, with the
view or setting forth the past and present condition
of American commerce and for the purpose of im
pressing upon Congress, through the action of your
committee, the absolute necessity 01 some action
being immediately tuicen to prevent the total de
nt ruction oi American international commerce, and
also to set foith the principle that the true pulley of
our government la to foster and encourage Ameri
can shipbuilding, as we beiieve that a
nation's prosperity Is reiiected iu the pros
perity oi Us commercial marine. As evidence of
the condition of our coniinorce during t lie last ililrty
two vears we respectfully call your attention to the
accompanying exhibit (A), which is a true copy of
the record at the New "i ork Custom Hyuw, U ^'Ui
be observed that during the year l93i tnore entered
the port or New York 407,090 ions of shipping, the
Jnindiwork or American craftsmen, and only about
one-third of that amount of tonnage of loroigti
build. The American builders sustained their pres
tige for twenty years thereafter, and specimens of
their workmanship wore seen and reflected In
every port and carried our emblem on every sea. In
1448 the English commenced the substitution of iron
for wood in the art of shipbuilding, and
since, by a chain ot circumstances, fortunate
to them, but disastrous to us, the record vbows for
lstw that nearly two tons ol foreign tonnage to one
of American wits recorded at the port of New York.
Many of these vessels, notwithstanding they appear
under foreign llag, are productions ol our American
ship yards, having changed tiiolr record for protec
tion during our iaie Internal struggle. I'revious to
l*t)s tue port of New York sustained not less than
twenty prominent ship yards, employing, with tue
collateral trades, such as Joiners, spariuakers, sall
luakers, Ac. Not less than -O.oou skilled mccliaulcs
umi i.ooo young men as apprentices learning the
various trades, To-day those yards have either
ceased to exist or are laying dormant, not
l,ooo skilled mechanics linding employment or
loo apprentices have encouragement to learn toe
art. it is m the Interest or tue country at large,
which in time or war must have ships to sustain us
dignity und mechanics to build them, that we appeal
to your honorable committee to recommend to Con
gress some potent measures lor the relief of our
profession we would respectrully and most
earnestly recommend that some action be immedi
ately taken by onr government to roster and encour
age the art or shipbuilding, and in consideration of
tne fact tnat all governments gain power and re
spect by the proiiciency of their seamen and
mechanics, we believe it would be eminently
lit and proper that ?congress should legis
late to allow to the American shipbuilder
*n equivalent on stll American material
used by him In the construction of the finished ship,
equal to the amount of duty which the government
would receive should such raw material be of foreign
production. Regarding tne proposition to abrogate
the Lnlted States registry laws and allow foreign
built ships to register on equal rooting with Ameri
can productions we most respectfully desire to
protest. Nearly everv native American, and we
believe the great majority of our adopted citizens
Mil possessed ol a certain amount of pride, and re
Joire tn tha growth and success of oor naval and
mercantile marine, and though at Um present
Urn* the people at large maj appear
to be Indifferent and lukewarm upon Uie
subject, it is our opinion that could a
fnli expression be obtained it woald be found to be
their unanimous deem that tbe principle inaugu
rated by the tounders of our iastnutiuun in regard
to our registry laws sbtuid t>* unduturbed. and that
nil vessels partakum n its hMMfltt kIiouu! be con
structed on American territory.
After tbe reading of thm paper several members
of tiie House committee asked a v*>of questions
as to the proper reined) for the evils existing. Mr.
R&wlaml stated that .akiug tbe duty off foreign
Iron, although it would tveutualir help the shipbuild
ing interest, would not fully meet the emergency.
He thougbtit would take years for the Pennsylvania
ironmonger to produce%e material at the price for
which English iron woutl sell in the United States;
consequently the American mills would be discour
aged and close up. He declared that we must have
American plate to build American ships. The neces
sity of having every piau aud bar rolled to specified
oraer and the time required for importation forbid
the use of foreign materitl. As to tbe inquiry, made
by a member of the Congressional committee,
whether the Mew York leicgatton did not ask for
what practically would amount to a bounty on
American shipbuilding, Mr. Rowland said he should
have to object to the use ot such a word. Neither he
nor his colleagues would wk for any bounty. They
preferred to givo full consideration tor what they
asked. They would, in exchange for the relief ac
corded by government, give a full equivalent tn
exchanging the prosperity of tbe country by edu
cating mechanics and others to become efficient
shipbuilders and sailora, wtlie at the same time de
ve'oping tne manuiacture if American iron. They
only asked the general g>vernmeut to do for the
shipbuilders what States did lor educational pur
poses. States expended money in teaching their
youth, so the general government should be liberal
in providing for the education of mechanics, such us
were required for shipbuilding, which formed one of
the strongest elements 01 the prosperity of a great
nation. Without scnools and schoolmasters no edu
cation could be had for the people. Without edu
cated mechanics thorp could be no prosperous con
dition of our shipplug interests.
Mr. D. 1). Westerveit observed that the skill and
mechanical ability of Americans have by no means
deteriorated, as certain people were in the
habit of saving; in fact, little progress
had been made tn the speed and etllciencv
of ocean steamers since the failure of the
Collins line. "It should bo remembored," he said
"that years ago the Collins steamship Baltic had
made a run across the Atiauttc in eight days and
twenty-two hours, which was within a few hours of
the best time since mad-) bv tne fastest
foreign-built steamships. If American mechan
ics were now given the same opportunity
enjoyed by foreign mechanics to show their skill,
no doubt in a short time a uew class of American
steamers would appear which would accomplish the
run to Europe in seven da?s.
Messrs. Win. Foulker and L. H. Boole followed with
appropriate remarks and mado a very marked 1m
presBion upon the committee. Messrs. Westerveit,
Foulkes, T. F. Rowland and Thomas Stack left here
lor New York to-night. The balance of the delega
tion remain here till to-morrow.

man of the Senate Finance Committee, and Mr.

The Franking Privilege.
The Douse Post Office Committee at their meeting
to-day appointed Motors, iiill. Fitch and Adams a
sub-committee to take into consideration the various
bills, papers and petitions which have been laid
before the House on the subject of abolishing the
franking privilege. This sub-committee is to make
a report to the general committee, alter which it
will decide upon bringing iu a bill. The indications
are that the committee will not report a bill abolish
ing the franking r.rivilege entirely, but only sus
pending it during the recess of Congress. The chair
man of the committee, General Farnsworth, Is In
favor of abolishing the (ranking privilege entirely,
but the majority of the committee are Against it.
The committee determined to vimt New York and
Boston during the holiday recess and examine the
work on the now Post Office buildings in those cities.
The Postal Convention Witli (treat Britain.
Postmaster General Creswell received a cable
telegram on tho nth instant, from the Postmaster
General at Loadou, announcing liie execution by
the British Post Office, on thatdav, of the new Postal
Convention, to come into operation on the 1st of
January next. The articles of the Convention were
draftel and executed at Washington on the ;id mat.,
and forwarded in the mall despatch from New York
on Saturday, the 4th lust., by the Inman steamship
City of Brussels, which made the quickest trans
atlantic passage on record. Only ten days inter
vened between the execution of the convention at
Washington and London.
*F)ie Tax on Alnlt Liquors.

United States Brewer's Congress, visited thlB city
to-day in company with James J. Lewis, ex-commls
sloner of internal revenue, and had satisfactory in
terviews with Commissioner Delano and Special
Commissioner Wells, relative to certain proposed

dealers in malt liquors. Tho changes desired are
embodied In a memorial frotn the Executive Com
mittee of the Brewer's Congress held at Newark,
N. J., on the 9th of June last, which will be laid be
fore Congress after the holiday recess.
The Use of Stand Ciuln.
The committee of internal revenue officials, to
whom was referrod the subject of a change in the
recent order of Commissioner Delano concer nlng
the use of stand casks, have, upon consultation, de
cided that no reasons exist why any alteration or
modification of the Commissioner's order should lie
made, and therefore decline to make such a recom
mendation. The committee consisted of First Deputy
Commissioner Douglas, Third Deputy (iiven and So
licitor Smith.
lleport of the C'onarmlonal Librarian.
The report of A. R. Spoirord, Librarian of Con
gress, was submitted to the senate this morning,
showing the condition of tho library for the year
ending December l, 1809. At that date there were
185,227 volumes on hand, exclusive of pamphlets
and periodicals unbound; 26,936 volumes belong to
the law department: 11,282 volumes were added
during the year, as follows:?From purchases, 6,1st)
volumes; from copyright, 1,831; from deposit by the
Smithsonian Institute, 1,879; from presentation,
724; from exchanges, 048. Mr. SpofTord calls the
attention jf the coinipittoe to the expediency of
opettfng Hie library To the public during the evening
hours as well as In the daytime.
Movements of the Land Jobbers.
The case of Dlack Bob's band of the {Shawnee In
dians is again being agitated. For some years these
Indians have lived upon their reservation, holding
their lauds In common, though it was their option
whether they would so continue or hold in severaltjr.
Their reservation, lying in the vicinity of Kansas
Cltv, became very valuable, and a pack of vultures in
the shapo of speculators stood by carefully eying the
tempting bait. It appears without any preliminary
notification these Indians were one day
much surptlsed to And a number of patents
for certain tracts of lands, in severalty, sent to them
without any request on their part. The Indians ex
pressed thoir disapprobation, and a number of set
tlers, with the permission of the Indian, who had
established themselves on the lands and were natu
rally somewhat disturbed, were alarmed and dis
satisfied. The speculators. It appears, are aiming
at the acquisition of the lands, which will not only
dispossess the Indiana, bQt as well the settlers, who
have already made some valuable improvements.
The case was brought a short time since to the
attention ot the Secretary of the interior, Mr. Cox,
who, it appears, did not bother himself to Investigate,
but turned the matter over to the Commlasloner of
Indian Affairs, who, in tarn, It la understood, handed
the case over to a young lawyer. The whole affair
has an exceedingly twisted appearance. The papers
In the case have been called for by Senator Ross, of
Kansas, and all proceedings will be suspended until
Congress can act in the matter, senator Rosa Is in
favor of the settlers, but it would be difficult to
locate Pomeroy anywhere, as it Is stated by those who
profess to kuov tn?t He has been on bout aide*. If
the President would turn his attention to these
transactions in Indian lands, wnlch In nine case*
oat of ten are nothing abort of downright swindles,
be would do mocti to correct the abuses and difficul
ties In the management or the Indians.

The Board of Manager* of the National Asylum for
Disabled Volunteer Soldiers mot at the office of the
Surgeon General In tills city to-day. There were

William Kelt nap, Secretary of War: Jay Cook,
Major General J. D. Martlndale, Judge Hugh
u Bond, Brigadier General John 8. Cavender,
Lewis B. Gunekel, Dr. E. B. Walcott and Governor
Frederick Smith. Tbe annual reports were read
and showed thit nearly four thousand disabled sol
diers and sailors werto supported and aided by the
managers during the past year, as follows:?At the
Central Asylum, near Dayton, Ohio, 1,037; at the
Eastern Branch, near Augusta, Me., 036: at the
Northwestern liranoh, near Milwaukee. Wis., 426;
at the Pennsylvania Branch, near Philadelphia, 419;
at the New York Branch, near Rochester, 170; at
the New Jersey Soldiers' Home, 323; at other local
asylums, 102; by outdoor relief given to those too
sick to be taken to the asylums and having families,
169. Many Interesting details were reported. Of
ine whole numoer so eared for 112 died during the
year?nearly one-hair of consumption?and 661
having been restored to health or prepared In the
asylum schools and workshops to support themselves
were honorably discharged. One hundred and
eighty-two belonged to the regular army, 44 to the
navy and all the rest to the volunteer servioe. Their
disability:?Loss of both arms, 9; loss of both legs,
8; loss of one arm, 321; loss of one leg, 420; blind,
177; Insane, 62; disabled by other wounds, 1,064;
treated in hospital, 1,348. It is gratifying to note that
of 67 forms of disease treated in the hospitals thert
was not a single case or epidemic or malarious
disease, showing the healtbfulness of the locations
selected for these asylums. Of the whole 1,304
receive pensions; 1,193 are native born, and 774 are
married with wives or minor children living. The
largest numoer from any State (026) came from
New York; Pennsylvania has 377, Massachu
setts 140, and about tbe proportionate nnmbers
lroin all the other Northern states. The regular
asylums are now completed, and all men
at the temporary homes will be at once transferred.
The Board adopted unanimously a resolution of
thanks to tbe trustees of the Philadelphia Soldiers'
Home for valuable aid given in caring for over l,ooo
men temporarily while the buildings of the National
Asylum were being constructed. Much other busi
ness was done. The Board will probably be In ses
sion for several days.

PERSONAL EM'LANATION by senator-brownrow.
Mr. Bkownlow (rep.), of Teuti., having been
awarded thirty minutes within which to make a
personal explanation, forwarded to the Clerk a
communication. winch was read, explana
tory of recent events in Tennessee and
Ills connection therewith. In consequence of
the tierce conflict between the Senator
and the Stokes taotion the republican party in Ten
nessee had become temporarily divided, Mr. Hrown
low, among otner republicans, supporting uovernor
Neuter, lie denied the imputation which his ene
mies bad made, that under any circumstances he
was ever favorable to tne election oi Andrew John
sou to the United States nenate, and cited various in
stances in which his constant opposition to Johnson
and Udclity to party had been shown by Ills acts.
Mr. Cooper, an old line whig, who had been elected
to the Senate, would yield a hearty support to Presi
dent urant and his administration.
During the reading or the paper the Chair remarked
that parliamentary usage and law required him tu
rule ont of order rsmarks which were aimed spe
cially and personally at members of the other Houim,
and tf objection was made by any member of the
senate to a further reading of the paper he would
be obliged to enforce the rules.
on motion of Mr. Sherman the communication
was proceeded with, no objection to It being made.
The paper further recited the anthor's defiance of
those w ho had attempted to arraign him for an al
leged betrayal or his party, and expressed the be
lief thai those who nad already cast lets for hia
political estate* in expectation of his death, wonfd
be sorely disappointed. The oruiciplM ?wiucb U&d
faided him In his administration of the affair* of
ennctwce would be faithfully adhered to during ihe
Senatorial term for which tie bad beeu elected.
TBI BFAMISU UUNBOATH AT NRW YORK.
Mr. Cakpkntbr. (rep.) of win., moved to take up
tbe resolution previously offered by dim declaring
that tu the opinion of the Senate tbe thirty gunboats
contracted for tu tbe United Mate* by or in behalf of
tbe government of Spain, to be employed against
the revolted district or Cuba. should not be allowed
to depart from tlie lulled States during the continu
ance ol tbat reiielilon.
Mr. humnek thought the discussion of the reaolu
tion would be premature, inasmuch at the Senate
had no mfomiuiiou concerning tlie gunboats, except
that from oewspaiier*. lie understood mat in n
few days official information tone*rnlng Cuba would
be received, upon which tbe tH-natf could act more
intelligibly.
The motion won agreed to.
? HKMAIikS UY Mil CAItPKNTF.R.
Mr. Caki-kstkk addressed the senate in support
of the resolution, lie *aul he bad waited in vuln Tor
Home other Senators, better qualified than himself to
move in the matter, lie old not propose that
tbe United States should either violate the law
of nations nor shirk a manifest duty (or fear
of consequences. Spain insisted, and the Presi
dent of tbe United State* reiterated, that the
condition ot affairs in i uba did not amount to a
state of war. The Information called lor on this
point bad not yet been received, but the emergency
was ot a character to preelude another postpone
ment of action on the subject. To determine
whether the oondilioa Of aitairs in Cuba Involved a
state of war, two processes were necessary; first, an
ascertainment ot the tacts of the case; atid, second,
an application of the law of nations to the facts
ascertained. Spam had her diplomatic representa
tives at Washington but Cuba hud no facilities for
presenting tbe lacts as they existed. In declurmg
that war did not exist there, our 1'resldeut may have
allowed his recollections on our recent great con
flict, in winch a million 01 men were assembled by
one single order, too great an influence in determin
ing the legal status of affairs In Cuba In a legul
sense, where the laws cannot be enforced by civil
officers and only by military authority within a State,
war does exist. The exactions Imposed upon Curia
by the mother country were most oppressive. For
forty years scarcely one native Cuban had held an
oitice in that government lor the protection of hie
and liberty. Tbe Cuban had no resource but to the
long sufferance uud forbearing charity ot a Spaniard,
since l??2 tbe island had been virtually under mar
tial law. To remedy this oppression the people of
2uba had resorted to revolution. They had an army,
a flag, bad iought battles, and vwro carrying on a
regular wariare. The new constitution of Cuba
liberates ail slaves, and this was another reason
why our own free republic should sympathize eilect
lveiy with a people struggling to found a like tree
government.
Tuo speaker claimed that under tbe constitution
Congress was empowered with the supervision of
all executive power except the pardoning power.
The President was the otgan lor communicating to
loreign nations the will ol this nation; but as to
what was the will ol the uatiou Cougress was the
only autboratative exponent. To Cougress exclu
sively belonged the rigut to regulate this power in
tlie United States. The true policy of neutrality was
to pursue Such a course as would prevent any ad
vantage being taken by one of the belligerents over
the other. It our government should declare that
Cuba and Spam both might buy gunbjau* in the
United States, uud knew tbat Cuba could
not bo beneilted by such permission and
that Spain would be, tlicu such permission
would be dishonest and would add insult
to injury. Congress had already expressly deter
mined the policy of the country to be neutrality,
with the recognition of belligerent rights from tlie
inception ot any actual revolution; and the history
ot our legislation lurnlshed abundant evidence or
this. The acts of Cougress ot I7u4 and 1818 on the
subject expressly declared this policy, aud under
litem it wm a violation ol statute law to permit me
utting out of vessels by Spalu or any foreign Power
against her subjects. our government should now
libel tliuxe gunboats, on the ground that they had
been lltted out by a foreign Power lor service against
the revolutionary subjects of that rower, by that
course an opportunity would be afforded the {rieud*
and representatives or the repubito or Cuba
to produce the necessary information anil
prove tlielr assertions of the condition or
affairs on that island. Spam denied these
representations. Cuba offered to Drove them; and
should we deny to Cuba uie opportunity ol making
tuts prool r Cuba could to-morrow make terms wltu
France or England which would insure her inde
pendence, but her position so near the United States
prevented this stop so long as our government
might seem willing to help her. The speaker re
ferred to the presence of the Spanish war vepsel
Pizarro in the harbor of New York, which has
brought oillcers and men to man the Spanish gun
boats and to escuft tut'in to Cuba; aud also men
tioned tue case of the Hornet, which was seized at
sea Of Uje U tilled States authorities, taken Into an
American port and libelled. It Cuba violated our
neutrality laws by fitting out in this country
vessels for service against Spain, so, then,
w,ih Spaiu equally guilty in fitting out
hero vessels Tor service against Cuba.
i'lie speaker concluded as loliows:? We are solemn
ly bound by the laws of nations, properly con
sidered, expressly pledged by our own declarations
upon tins subject, to stand entirely neutral between
.ipaiu and Cuba: hut us the law had been admin
istered it had b"cii a suteld to Spain and a sword to
Cuba. Liberty in Culm is in the helplessness o; in

the oar of iuuiartiai history, before which all gov
ernments must staud. 'i'uere is a Cod, aud there is a
Crvat ltook, in which the deeds of nations are writ
ten; and there is a retribution /or every nation
which, knowing its duly, does it /lot.
The .speaker added that lie had been informed
that eighteen of the gunboats reierred to were ex
pected to leave the United Stales on Friday, and
urged the necessity of prompt action.
M ? Summer, referring to the reniark that eighteen
of the gunboats would soon leave, read a telegram
which he had received irom a responsible party con -
nected with the government. The telegram, dated
at New York, stated that the vessels had been
delivered to me representatives of the Spanish navy,
hud their oilicers and crews on board, with the Hag
of Spain from tlielr mastheads, and were completely
the properly of tue Spanish government; aud that
unless something unforeseen occurred t hey would be
at sea. if not already gone, by to-morrow (Wednes
day) uioruing. The speaker said tuere were eight
other boats still uiitlmshed on the stocks, and to
these the resolution of the Senator of Wisconsin
would apply, lie was not disposed now to consider
the grave question presented by that Senator, but
lie mentioned the suxge?tlon that either that
Senator or the administration aud hinisell had mis
apprehended the statute upon which the senator
from Wisconsin aeeuied to rely. The Senator's posi
tion was, that uuder tue statute on the subject. Spam
could noL purchase ships In the United States to
cruise against her revolted subjects, Hut the
language of Hie statute, he thought, was entirely in
applicable to the case. The statute had been
amended for a specific purpose, and it was ouiy
through that amendment which further extended
the law that it was now claimed that the
building of these vessels was prohibited by
statute. The statute in question prohibited
under certain penalties any person froin titling
out or arming auv ship or vessel with the intent that
such ship or vessel shall be employod in the service
or any lorclgn prince of State or of auv colony, dis
trict or people to cruise or commit hostilities against
the subjects or property of any loreign prince of any
coiouv. district or people with whom tho United
States are at peace. .v.c. The words of any colony,
prince or people were introduced into the act subse
quently, and were intended solely to meet the case
ol' the revolted spauisu colonies, in regard to which
there was no question whatever us to llteir belliger
ence. The practical question lere was whether
those words, introduced lor a speciUc purpose, could
be extended so as to apply to insurgents who had
not yet achieved a corporate existence, who had no
cities porn or prize courts. We should seek the
truth from the facts as they arc round to exist.
Mi. OAMrornut inquired whether the most lavora
ble opportunity ol ascertaining the truth was not
tbrough the medium or libelling the gunboats.
Mr. Scxnkh replied?The better way, in his
opinion, of ascertaining the facis. was to send to
Ooba, to our authorized agents ami direct them to
report ou the tacts, lie understood that reports from
these source* bail been received by I he Department
of Mate, and would be coiumuuicaied to the senate,
aud thai taey were explicit ou the point that the in
surrection had not yet reached that common of

Mr. Howard, (rep.) of Mich., expressed a desire to
hbftf Irora the SOTifttor from Ma-tsachusei s any in
formation in his possession concerning the amount
Si rallir&r? lWce jictuaiiy in the tield in Cuba or the
amount available.' ? , . ' , ?
Mr. m-m.nkk said the inquiry in some degree
a confession that the seuate was in the dark In this
matter and needed the information wnic.i should ne
produced before taking definite action in the premi
ses. He understood that on tue side of the insur
gents the force had been greatly diminished. RUd lie
bad been told they wore little more than guerrillas
and thai the war was but little more than a guer
rilla contest. ,
Mr. Howard?Have they auy government f
Mr. Si'mnkr?I understand ihey have the govern
ment that is in a camp. The Senator knows what
that is. Hut this suggests, again, tno necessity ol
reliable information.
Mr. HowAiti??I desire to Unowiwhothcr they aie
actually exercising an legislative function*?
Mr. hcmnkr? 1 uunk they have no legislative
authorities aud I must cotifesy I await wim much
anxlet/ their action on the subject or slavery itself.
Tnere fiavc beeu reports that there has been a de
cree abolishing slavery, which was issued for foreigu
consumption. 1 state that as a report. I do not
pretend to vouch for It Mr. Sumner added, that
betore taking auy decisive ?tep by way or recog
nition tho 1 tilted States government should bo
Iniorrned of the exact leeling ol the Cubans concern
ing slavery, lie also looked lor an assurauce irom
Spain. Why did not Spain abolish slavery in Cuba r
She ougnt to do 1U
Mr. Morton, (rep) of ind., inquired whether
Spain had not recently affirmed the existence of
slavery In her possessions, especially in Porto Kico f
Mr. St'MNBH replied that he was not prepated to
inform the Senator on that point; but if his voice
could reach her ne would plead with Spain to move
quickly in the abolition oi aiaverr where it couid bo
done away with. Referring to the case of the Hor
net, which vessel was captured by the 1 nited States,
be said that it was very dissimilar irom that of the
Hpanlsh gunboats. A traitor might levy war against
the king: but the king, lu proceeding against the
trsltor, did not levy war, but simply proceeded in
ton exercise of his proper fuuctions to establish
bis authority. In tuo spirit of that illustration ne
VII (Uf?osM to believe thai tna failed btatei were
perfectly justtflawe under the eta tote in arresting
tue Hornet, but would not be J on tilled in arresting
the Spanish gunboats.
Mr. Carpkntek Inquired whether the condition of
neutrality did not necessarily depend upou the (act
that war wan prog reusing between two parties r If
it r>e a violation of our neutrality act to Interfere in
behalf of one of these parties and Ot out vessels for
them In the l ulled States, was it not equally a viola
tion to help the other, or was our pretence of neu
trality a sliam ?
Mr. si'MNEit replied that he did not regard It as a
question of neutrality. Until the belligerence of
imne people was recognized they were nor of them
selves a power nor a people. Therefore tbere could
be no neutrality ou the part 01 our iroverninent be
tween Spain and ber revolted subjects until the in
surgent# came up to the level oi an independent
people.
mi: BIGOT HOUR I.Aw.
The floor having been awarded to Mr. Morrill,,
(rep.) of Vt., he moved to take up the bill relative to
the hours of labor for the government workmen.
Mr. carpenter's resolution was then laid over,
and
on motion of Mr. Mokrii.l the senate took up the
joint resolution to regulate the hours of laiHir lor
government laborer*, workmen and mechanics.
The ulll provides that the joint resolution reduc
ing the hours of labor o( government laborers, ap
proved June 26, 11)08, shall not create a reduction of
wages.
Mr. Morrill moved an amendment repealing the
former act whicu declared eluut hours to oe a day's
labor.
Mr. Morrill considered the provisions and effects
of the Kuiht Hour law lu a loug speech, contending
that the law panned at the last session of Congress
merely prescribed the number of hours which Btionul
constitute a day's work without repealing the e.vst
ins laws on the subject of compensation. The
Attorney Ueneral has given his opinion as to the
construction of tills law, but the other departments
overrule that opinion and execute the law as they
like, it is clear that the Eight Hour law is offensive
to all workingmcn not in the employment of the
government, and thai it is without profit to the men
employed ami will lead to the abandonment of the
industrial establishments hitherto maintained at the
national cost.
Mr. Wilson, (rep.) of Maa9.. said that the con
struction put upou the act or 1HB8, fixing the hours
or labor, by the departments of the government put
Congress lu a false position. Hie President, how
ever, had relieved Congress by the construction lie
hail given the law. lie desired that the law might
have a lair chance to be tested practically.

CONSIDERATION OK THE CENSUS BILL.
The House then weut into Committee of the
Whole, Mr. Iiawes In the chair, on the census BUI.
The amendments pending jesterday for tho collec
tion 01 statistics of United suites bonds he id by cor
porations and individuals were rejected.
\ arlous propositions were made as to railroad and
other statistics, but the amendment offered jester
day by Mr. Garfield, from tne Census Committee,
w as adopted, with out slight alteration. Various
propositions were also made and discussed I11 rela
lion to the details in the schedules of inquiries.
Mr. JKM'kKS (rep.) of It- I., moved to strike out
the agricultural schedule from the bill and leave the
superintendent of tne Census to lrame the schedule,
which would naturally vary according to locations.
He argued that that was the practical way of doing
it, Cougress simply indicating what suojcct it
required in lor mat loll upon.

BOARD OF EDUCATION.
The Custodians of the Metropolitan Juvenile
Intelligence in Council.
The Venerable Economists Granting
Holidays?Records of the Paat
for Waste Paper.
The Hoard of Commissioners of Common Schools
met in staled session last evening in the ball corner
of Grand and Kim streets, with the gentlemanly
president, Mr. R. L. l.arrlmore, fn his full areas suit,
in the chair and all the members in their places, ex
cept the rubicund, chronic absentee and one other
commissioner who was absent on a'count of sick
ness. The Board, as at present composed, is almost
as venerable In appearance as the Chamber
of Commerce and nearly as ??long winded,"
so that those who attend as spectators
have frequent opportunities of being enter
tained, amused or bored hall to death with lengthy
reports or captious speeches, which fully Illustrate
the "difference 'twlxt tweedledum and tweedle
dee." In order to save time the minntes of the
Hoard, in accordance with a resolution adopted
some time since, are printed and forwarded to the
members ol the Board. The labor of oavlng the
minutes read is thus dispensed witn, and the vener
able members of this economical council, after the
opening of the meeting, spend a few moments In
silent (and, it Is to be hoped, pious) meditation, for
the purpose of calling to mind their sins of omission
and commission and making tlrm resolutions to do
bet tor in the future. In the lobby was the usual gather
ing of effeminate and handsome looking voung men
who spend their dais in "teaching tue young idea
how to shoot," and. among them, mirabile dirtu,
were several representatives of liic feminine gender
of the human species.
The proceedings of the board last night were not
particularly interesting, except in one or two
instauces. A number of communications of the
usual style were presented and referred to the appro,
priato committees. One communication, however,
was somewhat different from the common run, ami
was transmitted to the Hoard by au individual
signing himself C. H. Farntuus. m winch it
was siateu that the communicator na I a method of
imparting musical instruction which he claimed was
uiucu superior to that BOW IB OH. In is idea will,
no doubt l>e very interesting to UristoA" and the
others who are sallstied with the "good old way."
There Is scarcely any ho e tor ?ir. l'arutiaui, as the
matter was relerreu to the Committee on Course of
.Studies, ut the Head 01 winch la a remarkable and
exceedingly erudite child of tadtOBi who. no doabt,
has an eminent regard lor Beeuiovon and gentlemen
of that ilk. and who will, in ali probability, look
upon any innovation on ilieir style witn as much
horror as ne does the idea o. not having the children
oi tne city taught tiie lingo ol his "vaterland."
Resolutions were adopted authorizing tne dosing
ol the evening schools on curlstmas Eve and tno
closing of a I the schools on Monday. January 3,
18?o. Mus will give teachers and pupils time to pre
pare cleau stockings to be hung up on Christinas
Eve. and give the misses aud masters an opportuuitjr
to honor duly ttie Institution at ' lady's day," which
mustneoessanly be postponed from Sunday, Janu
ary 2. The Hoard old not say to eacti individual at
tending the schools when tne resolutions were
adopted, but the members, no doubt, meant
to say to eacn ami every one who could profit by
the extra holidays, ".sts/effce."
A gross report was made by the Committee on
Teachers in regard to the action of the local Board of
Trustees of the First ward in removing Hugh L?uify,
principal of Grammar School No. 2W, ror neglect of
duty. It appeared that during the past year Mr.
Duffy had performed but thirty-seven days' service,
and thai, aitnougn notified by the Hoard that he
must be more atteutive, there was no evidence of
improvement. Tue committee, therefore, reported
in favor oi sustaining the actiou of the local Board,
and i tie report was adopted by an unanimous vote.
The Committee on Furniture, Jtc., reported on the
request of the local board oi tuo First ward in regard
to lurnishlng the addition lately built to Grammar
School No. lit); in favor of directing the {superinten
dent oi Huildlngs to ruruish tue school as lar as pos
stolc with nuch old lurnlture as he might have and
to obtain only such new luruiture as was absolutely
necessary. Has report was unanimously adopted.
Commissioner Bkli., from the Finance committee,
reported mat there were balances on hand iroin
several appropriations, aud recommended their
transfer to other accounts. The total amount ol the
several unexpended balances was $1,825; and the
report of tue committee m relation thereto was
adopted.
The Trustees of the Nineteenth ward were author
ized to establish a uew primary school In the ward,
aomewnere between Fortieth aud FUneth streets
and First aud ihlrd avenues, 'litis was done in con
sequence ol tne fact that the schools ol the ward
were so densely crowded that there was no more
room. This action, of course, necessitates the .eas
ing of premises, as the Hoard has decided to erect
no more new school buildings, owners oi premises
suitable lor a primary scnool wituin tue limits pre
scribed will, no doubt. Increase the rent on such
premises, so tuat should the Hoard engage any of
them they will uot cost much more in tue end than
a new building would.
I commissioner Wood announced that the number
of manuals and directories issued by the Board for
1869 was, he thought, a great deal too large; that for
furnishing the members of the Board and the local
I boards and principals of the schools with copies,
about 350 cjpius would suffice, and he, therefore,
offered a resolution to the effect that for 1870 but 6oo
copies of the "Manual" be Issued, and or the direc
tories a similar number. The matter was referred
to the Committee on Supplies, wtio may probably
report favorably on Mr. Wood's resolution. Should
they do so, it will be lound necessary, no doubt, ere
the close ol the year, to deny the request ol many of
those who may ask lor copies of the "Manual" as a
matter of right or courtesy.
Commissioner Wood had been rummaging through
the rooms m the building used by the Board, having
appointed Himself, apparently, a "smelling" com
mittee ol one. and came across a large number of
old copies ol records, manual^, reports and other
printed documents oi the Board oi Education for
years past. He moved, therefore, that live copies of
the documents of each year be collected, aud that
the remainder be sold by the Committee on Supplies,
either at public auction or by private sale, for waste
paper.
Commissioner Smyth thought Ave copies were not
quite enongh to be aaved.
Commissioner Wool) thought the Committee on
Supplies could regulate trial matter. The resolution
was adopted, here is a glorious opportunity for
the Historical hoo*ety, Astor Library, Cooper Imui
tuie and other similar institutions to get a tine sup
ply or books to make a show on me shelves ami
furnish entertaining and Instructive reading matter
which they should not neglect.
ike committee on Bylaws presented a voluminous
report of amendments to the bylaws, mainly in ac
cordance with resolutions adopted from time to
time during some months past. The report was so
very long that the energetic cleric (Mr. lluchman)
while reading it was obliged to "take water" several
times. lie managed to get through it safely, how
ever, and resumed ills seat quite exhaiiUed. The
report was adopted, and tue bytaws as amended in
in accordance with the report were adopted as a
whole.
The Hoard, after disposing of some usual routine
matters, adjourned to meet accordlug to resolution

"1IIE OLD
Inauguration of a Mew Club Room?The New

The Old Guard, composed of the veteran members
of the now defunct Light Guard and City Guard,
last night inaugurated Its new club room at No. 907
Broadway. The room, which Is quite large, is very
handsomely titled up, and the furniture, which
Includes a tine grand piano, is of a very
elegant and substantial character. About
sixty members assembled to celebrate the
occasion, and a business meeting was organ

W. McLean presiding and Mr. J. B. Wheelock
acting as secretary. The Committee on Uniforms
presented a report, whtcn stated tnat a uniform had
been agreed upon. A sued men suit was exhiolted,

souk' routine business the meeting adjourned, and
immediately after the adjournment a very excellent
collation was spread. After the repast had been
fully discussed Genera! ilatlleld was called to the
chair and au taiormal meeting organized to cele
brate by speccli and song tne opening of the club
room. Mr. D. llcnrluues was the first gentle
man called upon to speak, and he con
gratulated his brother members on the step
which the Guard had taken, an0 announced that
t he room would t>e kept open every night, in order
that the "guards" might have a headquarters where
they could meet and enjoy social intercourse. Major
MC.Murray followed in a very humorous and enjoy
atue speech. In tne course of which he recited seve
ral interesting anecdotes as to the doings of the two
corps under Captains McArdle and Vincent, uttaer
speeches were made by Messrs. A. flertriqaes, Alien,
