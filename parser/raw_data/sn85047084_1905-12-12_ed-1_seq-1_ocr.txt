GOVERNOR'S
HARBOR
WORK
Lieut. Slattcry's Task
in Hawaiian
Waters.
A copy of the annual report upon the
improvement of Pearl and Honolulu
harbors, Hawaii, in the charge of J. R.
Slattery, First Lieutenant, Corps of
Engineers, II. S. A., has been received
from the author. The report gives
much valuable information concerning
the commercial aspect of the harbor of
Honolulu.
The first portion of the report con
tains an extract from the annual re
port of the Chief of Engineers to the
Secretary of "War, as follows:
Office of the Chief of Engineers,
United States Army,
Washington, Sept. 29, 1905.
IMPROVEMENT OP HARBORS

IN
This district was in the charge of
First Lieut. J. R. Slattery, Corps of
Engineers. Division engineer, Col. W.
H. Heuer, Corps of Engineers.
1. Pearl Harbor. This work was in
the charge of Col. W. H. Heuer, Corps
of Engineers, until April 14, 1905. This
harbor is 8 miles west of Honolulu.
Before improvement there was a bar at
its entrance with a low-water depth of
10 feet on its crest and a coral reef
either side. A full description of
channel 200 feet wide and 30 feet deep
at mean low water, at an estimated
cost of $100,000. Congress approved
this propect by appropriating $100,000
generally 31 feet) in depth at low
water entirely across the bar from deep
water in the ocean to deep water
Work on the Kohala ditch continues to make progress that fairly assures
a flowing of the fructifying waters at the time "nominated in the bond." It
is hoped that the first section of fourteen miles from Honokane west will be
rjompleted by the first of July next, so that water will be delivered in time
for planting. An additional six miles will be built to windward as far as
"Waimanu.
considering that constructive operations were not begun till April 10 this
jear, the progress has been most rapid. Indeed it adds laurels to the credit
of the Territory of Hawaii for vigorous activity. Nine of the fourteen miles
i;nder construction are in rock tunnel, of which the following are the data of
progress: April, 1461 feet; May, 5100 feet; June, 8715 feet; July, 7267 feet;
August, 5195 feet; September, 3547; October, 3307; November, 2978 feet.
About 8000 feet more remain to be completed before all the borings will
be finished, which will be in about four months. For the remarkable progress
made much of the credit is due to the Japanese. The labor is being entirely
performed by this nationality, who exhibit especial proficiency for rock ex
cavating work.
About ten miles of the fourteen will be lined with concrete and cement
plaster through porous strata to obviate the loss of water from seepage. This
work is now under way and being pushed as fast as the tunneling is completed.
The Concrete Construction Co. of Honolulu has the contract for making forty
cubic yards of sand a day for this purpose. This material is distributed

As yet there is no commercial activ
ity in the harbor. Inside the bar the
channel is so crooked and the turns so
sharp that it is not safe for the navi
gation of large vessels. No estimate
for remedying this 'defect has yet been
authorized by Congress. The rriean
range of tides at the entrance is about
14 inches.
The work, so far as authorized and
appropriated for, has been completed
in accordance with the project. The
head of. navigation is at the head of
each loch forming the harbor. No fur

are required.

2. Honolulu Harbor, Hawaii. This
harbor is situated on the south coast
of the island of Oahu. It is formed by
a coral reef, a narrow channel through
the reef affording access to the harbor.
The entrance channel and harbor prop
er were dredged from time to time by
the monarchical, republican and Terri
torial governments of Hawaii prior to
July 1, 1904. On this date there exist
ed an entrance channel having a depth
of about 35 feet and a minimum width
of about 200 feet at mean low water.
The harbor proper (that portion com
mencing at the lighthouse and extend
ing to the mouth of the Nuuanu river)
had a general width of 800 feet. The
water for about 200 feet immediately
along the wharves had a depth of from
30 to 32 feet. Elsewhere there was
only about 27 feet at low water. The
bend at the lightouse point was so
sharp as to be somewhat difficult tor
large vessels to get around. The sha!
low water in the harbor made It im
possible for the largest vessels call-
ins at th nort to enter the narDor
when at all heavily laden. The nar
rowness of the harbor made turning
difficult for all ships.
The river and harbor act of March
3, 1905, provides as follows:
Improving harbor at Honolulu,
Hawaii: In accordance with the
report and surveys made by the
land department of the government
of the Sandwich Islands prior to
annexation and the further report
of Lieutenant Slattery, two hun
dred thousand dollars: Provided,
That a contract or contracts may
be entered into for such materials
and work as may be necessary to
prosecute said work, to be paid
for as appropriations may from
time to time be made by law, not
to exceed In the aggregate two hun
dred thousand dollars In excess of
the amount herein appropriated.
The amounts herein appropriated
and authorized may be expended
upon sections one. two, and three,
it being the intention to provide
first for the completion of section
one. and the Secretary of War is
authorized and directed to cause a
resurvey of said harbor to be made.
California.
! The inception of the project is due to Col. Sam. Parker and J. T. Me
Crosson, though it did not assume a substantial status till the Hind estate and
Mrs. Samuel .Parker lent their financial assistance.
It is estimated the ditch will cost when completed about $750,000, and the
Hawaiian government, under the terms of the franchise, will have the privi
lege of acquiring it at this figure.
The whole constructive part of the enterprise is in charge of M. M.
O'Shaugbnessy, C. E., who executed the Makaweli and Koolau aqueducts in
rrevious years in a successful manner.
The Kohala ditch bids fair to add greatly to the material progress of the
big Island of Hawaii,, though the tourist and kamaaina will regret the disap
pearance of the many picturesque waterfalls now ornamenting the bluffs be
tween Waimanu and Kohala. In future the streams that make these beautiful
objects will be intercepted by this work and their contents led out to the
farm lands, where they will create new beauties of landscape besidesjnereasing
the prosperity of the Islands to a degree at present difficult to calculate.
SCHWEITZER TALKS ABOUT
HIS MANILA BREWERY PLAN
Louis Schweitzer, secretary of the Honolulu Brewing & Malting Company,
which manufactures Primo beer, returned from a tour of the Orient yesterday
on the Korea, accompanied by Mrs. Schweitzer.
Mr. Schweitzer's mission in the Far East was to investigate the field and
ascertain whether there was room for another brewery. Associated with Sena
tor Hocking, of the Honolulu brewery, and two San Francisco capitalists,
Mr. Schweitzer was armed with authority to make a thorough investigation of
the prospects, and the choice now practically lies between Shanghai and Manila.
While in the latter city Mr. Schweitzer came in contact with the San
Miguel Brewing Companv, which claimed to have a monopoly in the business
brewing beer, in Manila at least, and that company made public statements
to that effect, quoting old Spanish laws to back up its contention.
This did not scare Mr. Schweitzer off and he obtained a ruling from the
Attorney-General of the Philippines, which indicated that if Mr. Schweitzer
wanted to go ahead and establish a new brewery there was nothing in the
franchise granted the San Miguel people to prevent a competitor from entering
the field.
Shanghai was looked, upon as a promising field for a brewery.
"Shanghai is certainly the Paris of the Far East," said Mr. Schweitzer,
"and everything is on the move. There is business everywhere. The streets
are lined with rickshaws and other vehicles and crowds of people are moving
up and down and the stores are busy places.
"I saw Lorrin Andrews and he told me he was doing well. In fact he
said he had made $750 a day or two after getting there and that was mare
money than he had made in Honolulu for some time. He does not intend to
come back to Honolulu.
"Can we ship Primo beer to the Orient? Well, there are a lot of agents
Ihere who would like to get our beer but the steamship companies won't make
us a rate. Therefore, we can not enter the market.
"As to whether we will build a brewery over there, either at Shanghai or
Manila, I can not state just now. I have not yet made my report."

BUS! TIM
He Is Preparing Matter
for Information
of Congress.
It's "from early morn till dewy eve"
with Governor Carter's work these
days. For his grinding toil the pres
ent session of Congress is the occasion.
President Roosevelt in his message
having dedicated a big gun to Hawaii,
the Governor has gone into the ammu
nition factory to rush forward a sup
ply of cartridges.
"I do not know whether I shall be
able to get away," the Governor said
yesterday respecting an invitation he
had received from Admiral Goodrich
to accompany him, a week from today,
in the cruiser Chicago for a trip to
Hilo and a visit to the Volcano.
"A good many letters have to be .got
off, for which data must be prepared.
Yes," the Governor assented, "for the
information of Congress and promo
tion of legislation the Territory badly
needs.
"One matter needing attention is that
of personal property in the custody of
the Territory. An opinion of the At
torney General's Department holds that
we can not sell the old tug Eleu. The
boat is of no use to the Territory or
to the United States, and there a-re
old animals and road machinery to
uling applies.
ust be legislation on that
question. It involves a waste of prop
erty that might be sold to either party's
advantage, but at present is of no
benefit either to the United States
Government or to the Territory. We
ought to get authority to sell any such
property.
"I must write to Delegate Kuhio and
give him data in aid of his measure
to secure an appropriation for payment
of the expenses of our sessions of the
Legislature. He has asked for it. It
would.be a mighty good thing. The
Federal Government, I understand,
pays f'fte legislative expenses of every
other Territory. This is not so im
portant, however, as other matters be
fore us."
With regard to the Governor's busy
days, it may be mentioned that he was
rung up on business at 7:15 yesterday
morning. From that time until 5 in
the afternoon he did not have a mo
ment he could call his own. Even as
for luncheon he tasted none and it is
doubtful if he so much as took thought
to cinch up his waistcoat band for
reduction of the gnawing vacuum.
His sole relief from grind at the
executive desk was an excursion he
took with Supervisor Jack Lucas to
the outlet of the storm water drain
age system. This was to investigate
a damming of the outflow by the fill-ing-in
of the marine park site at Ka
kaako with harbor dredgings. The
matter has beer, brought to the atten
tion of the Board of Supervisors by
petitions and Mr. Lucas, as chairman
of the road committee, solicited the
Governor's influence to secure an ex
tension of the system through the fill-
ed-in tract by the Federal authori
ties.
Governor Carter was not prepared to
give out his views on the matter yes
terday evening, but said he was goin:
to send a letter to the Board of Su
pervisors relative thereto.
All the time the Governor was at his
office, between morning and evening,
there were people in the outer room
awaiting their turns for interviews.

Final Crisis Approaches in Russia
Cossacks and Artillery Unable to
Protect Life or Property.
(Associated Press Cablegrams.)
ST. PETERSBURG, December 12. The situation is ominous
with reaction and coercion facing each other.
It is understood that the government is against universal suf
frage and favors permitting the franchise to be exercised only by
rent payers, merchants and the educated classes.
The capital resembles a military camp. Artillery are conspic
uous in the streets. The patrols have been doubled.
Workingmen's meetings have been dispersed while loyalist
meetings are undisturbed.
It is now the popular belief that the government has chosen
Trepoff and Ignatieff to execute a program of repression and that
the entire Cossack strength of the empire will be mobilized for the
purpose.
Churches have been desecrated, landlords have been murdered
and their property pillaged.
