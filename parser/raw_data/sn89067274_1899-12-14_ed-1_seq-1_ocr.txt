In writing on "Evening Entertain
ments For tb Family" for tb LiM
Stock Indicator, V. V. BwarUendruber,
of Rowsna, Mo., .ay.: "
The evening antertalnment for

ture, but the parent, should tee tbat It
1. from a good standpoint, something
that will develop th mind of th
ohlldren, Children who are going to
school should study their school les
son five evening In tb week, and
Saturday evening tbey should comult
their Bunday tobool leeson. Tba old
er ohlldren should take part with
their parent In reading agricultural
paper. Ou should read wbila tb
other, listen, and every time be get
through with senteno he sbould
top and give a chance for a abort
discussion. I thick it 1 very neces
sary for the farmer to cultivate Ma
mind, and alto th minds ol his sons,
oa farm theories, and seek th bnt
methods of farming, and mak th
surroundings a they should be ln a
genuine, pleasant farm bona. It I
pitiful that many farmer, do not get
any farm paper at all, but get front
three to aix, and maybe more, politi
cal piper., wbicb a farmer ha vary
little use for, and will read nothing
else. Some will devote the long win
ter evening to playing cards, wbioh,
in my estimation, I nothing bnt kilt

Improved better than to devote It to
playing cards I not worth living.
Above all let ns not forget our re
ligious practice, as that oomes In It
tarn, too.
Under lb head of "Aftermath," be
continue!:
I will aay that 1 have no nae foe
politic, in tne special Farmers' insu
late edition. There is not enough In
it for farmer., and it would not bring
our minds any closer together. I do
not think the Aftermath shonld be
topped, as wa are not alway posi
tive in our statements. As certain
experienoei may work very well nn
der our condition!, and might not do
at all nnder different oircumstai nce,
it it necessary to have the Aftermath
open for later discussion. Tb editor
Is careful that everything (hail be
discussed from reasonable stand
point or not at all, which is as it
should be. In short, tb Aftermath la
to separate the cream from tha milk.
In dlsouseing tbe farm hand question,
Mr. G, T. Doyle speaks of th farmer
often making from 950 to 1100 par
month. I am convlnoed, however,
that fully nine-tenth, do not exceed
(40 per month, and at tha same Urn
have from (3,000 to (9,000 Invested,
while th Ideal farm hand hasn't a
dollar at stake.
