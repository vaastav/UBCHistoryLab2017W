A BURIED OSTV Of. DC 4 THAN
PO.WPEII.
The, Kue del IJou? ' Sondes
gives an apcount oi some remark
able discoveries which have been
recently made in the two islands
of the Greek Archipelago, called
respectively Satitorin andTbera-
sia. These two islands, with
third, form a sort of circular bay.
Tbeir coast present a series of
cliff), sometimes reaching to a
height or 1,300 feet. On tbe top
of these cliffs lies a baud of pum
ice stone or brilliant whiteness.
From the summit the land slopes
away gently to luo open sea, and
is everywhere covered with a coat
ing of tula or. pozznolana, at
times more than 100 feet deep.
Here and there upon the slopes
aro' scattered populous villages.
There is, however, no soil but a
light friable pumice, tbe dust of
wuicu is raised and carried in ed
dies by. every . strong wind. This
pumice, when doily mixed with
lime, produces a bard cement.
wtilcu has the aualitv of prest re
sistance to the action of tbe
weather or of sea-water. It has
for some time been exported, and
tho works at thdSucz Canal have
lately increased demand for it ,' In
quarrying, the tula has been, quite
out. through., and boneath have
been found remains of buildings
erected by the primitive dwellers
in ueutannaV't' 'n t sn ,.:o i
The'first discoveries -Wero' Made
at Therasla.' Orr the Southern
faco of this Island, between .the
two capes" in hleh it terminates,
ore vast open quarries. The works!
are at the ;edga-of the oliu",y.and
tbe material ta hurled down: some
500 feet to tlie base, whenoe it is
directed by chute Into boata. Tbe
Workmen have" been accustomed
not to cut down to the bottom of
the stratum, since belo w n certain
level they found that the pozzuo
laua was mixed with blocks of
stone, which,: besides ' making, it
more dillluult to work, reduced its
valuei These blocks lay in regu
lar lines, and were the crests or
walls. There can be no doubt
that the buildings were raised t:
dwell in, and that tho pumico
which covered them had not stir
red tsiiicu it first fell from the
volcano.
The principal building uncover
ed contains six rooms of various
siz,s, tho largest being about 20
feet by 17 feet, the smallest a little
more than eihtfectsqua e. Ouu
of the walls is carried out so as to
include a sort of court about 20
feet long, with a single entrance.
A smaller buildjng of one cham
ber has been opened clone to thin,
and the crests of several walls in
the neighborhood bear witness to
the existence of houses still hur
led. The masonry is quite differ

zuolana nor lime. . The walls are
composed of irregular blocks of
unhewn lava, laid one above an
other 'without order, tbe interstice
being filled up with a reddish ool;
ored volcanio ash. Among the
walls are laid in every direction
long branches of olive wood, now
for tho moit part so decayed that
they crumble at the first tone h.
The object of these was to make
the walls less riid, and so lo-s
subject to disturbance from earth
quakes. Some pieces of roughly

a room, as if crulied uadcr the
weight of tho roof when it broke
in. Much oi his iiropertv had es -
ceed destruction, and nijoeU of
; various kinds were there; vessels
oi lava ann carmen ware, grain,
straw, bones ol' animals, tools of'
(lint aud of lava. There s.a no!
trace of mcUils, not even a nail in I
a .
the wood work of the roof. The
pottery is of several kinds. Large
yellowish jars, holding sometimes
as much as twenty g:illon, are
most common. Thoy contained
barley, pease, anise, dec., nud are
such as were usually employed in
Greece for storiug grain. Bailey
was found also piled up against
the walls. A smaller kind' of jars
of a light color ornamented with a
red pattern present peculiarities
which distinguish them from nil
Greek, Etruscan, or Kgyptian pot
tery. There is yet another kind,
made of a fine light yellow earth,
and adorned with spots and curv
ed lines, or even with garlands of
leaves. The execution of these
shows great skill and taste on the
part of the workmen.
Other rougher vessels bare
been found, and some Urge
troughs of lava, wbioh seemed to
have been used for feeding ani
mals. They , were flxed iu the
ground, some in the court, others
in a room, where were also sbmc
sheep bones. ' Another lava ves
sel was probably an oil press.
Similar presses are still used in
some Islands of the Archipelago.
Some hand mills of lava were
turned up,, consisting of two lu m
ispherical blocks about eighlcon
inches across; the .ilat sides arc
worn as with use. In the thou
sands of years during which these
have been hid, the Islanders have
so far improved on this that they
now put a wooden handle to the.
npper stone. . There is another
and more curious instance of the
preservation of primitive methods
of manufacture. Some dishes of
lava were found pierced iu the
centre. A faint groove running
on each side from the hole to the
edge oi the disk looked like the
mark of a r.ord by which U hud
been suspended. M. Foquo could
imagine no use for these till he
learned that similar disks of stone
are employed by the weavers for
stretching their work upon the
frame. With the disks were
found some weights of lava, us
well as a flint lancchead, and a
aort of small saw, also of flint.
These resemble the usual flint
tools known to arebwoiogists.
