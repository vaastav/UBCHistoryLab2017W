A NEW DEGREE.
Past Masters of the Native Sons
of the Golden West.
A meeting of the Past President's
Association of the Native Sons of the
Golden West was held last Saturday
night in San Francisco. The following
were elected temporary officers to serve
until the last Saturday in January,
when another meeting will be held, at
which permanent officers will be
chosen: President, J. A. Steinbach;
Financial Secretary, Adolph Eberhart;
Recording Secretary, Pascal Maussang;
Treasurer. W. D. Shea.
There was a large attendance at the
meeting, and the report of the commit
tee previously appointed was received.
It is believed that this association may
lead to the establishment of a higher
degree of the order of Native Sons,
such as the Past Master's degree of
Masonry.
It was decided that the regular busi
ness meetings should be held at month
ly intervals, and that quarterly meet
ings should be held for social purposes.
There will be several hundred Presi
dents and Past Presidents in the State
eligible to membership.

AMUSEMENTS.
At the Clunie Opera-house this even
ing- the dialect comedy, "Yon Yonson,"
a well-known play, with Arthur Don
aldson, a native of Sweden, in
the title role. The comedy is a
three-act piece with a coherent plot.
The story of the play is well told, and
the scenic effects are all that can be
desired. The great "log jam" at the end j
of the second act is one of the best j
pieces of mechanicSV stage work that
is presented in these times. This year
it has been the aim of the managers,
say they, to better the performance in
every way. They have engaged the
Lumbermen's Quartet as an aid. The
title role in the hands of Arthur Don
oldson is well sustained. He has been
known as one of the best comic bari
tone singers in the nnmntry. During the j
action of the play Mr. Donaldson will
sing a number of Swedish folk songs
in their original language. His singing
of these songs should be a pleasing
feature of the performance. The com
pany includes Annie Mack Berlein,
Beatrice Norman, E. J. Mack, Clinton
Maynard, Sidney Craven. Harry Hub
bard, E. Guy Spangler, Grace Hazard
and Daisy Grogan. A novelty intro
duced this season is the introduction of
refined specialties during the progress
of each act. "Yon Yonson" as now
rendered is a comedy-drama with a
strong heart interest and beautiful love j
story, and is highly spoken of by the J
press of San Francisco, where it had a j
fortnight's run.
The inclement condition of the wea- [
ther considered, there was a good audi- I
ence at the Clunie last night when Miss
Eugenic Blair presented the dramitiza
tion of Mrs. Burnett's novel "A Lady of j
Quality." The play is a strong one ,
throughout. It is, if history has not
belied the times, a fair extract from
the record of the frivolities, licentious- j
ness and debauchery of a certain order i
of the English aristocracy in the middle j
of the seventeenth century. The audi- !
ence failed to find in the play that vein j
of immodest suggestion which some |
critics have referred to as best elimin
ated. What these prudes would have ]
expurgated is the essential and vital
meaning of the drama. It is the story
of a dashing, free-souled and innocent
country girl, brought up by her father j
to boyish games and sports, and in
male attire. When she comes to love
she discards the garb for that of her I
sex and charms and bewitches more j
as a lovely woman than as the dis
guised girl. A cold-blooded rake to I
win a pot-house bet lays seige to her j
heart and wins to indiscretion, though
she has meanwhile seen the man whom
she can truly love. To triumph over
her the roue visits her home to an
nounce that he breaks their engage
ment and has selected another woman
for his wife. Suspecting his purposes,
she is first with renunciation and
humiliates the rascal by announcing
her own engagement to an aged Earl,
to whom she is later married and with
in two years is a widow. The rake
thereupon resolves to triumph over her, j
and just as she is on the eve of wed- j
ding the man of her womanhood's true
TSE EECORD-TjyiOy, SACRAMENTO; WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 13, 1899,
love, the polished villain appears and
dares her to do so. His own fortunes
being at low ebb, and having been re
jected by his selection, he renews his
suit for two purposes, to repair his
purse with her fortune, and to triumph
over her. While humiliating her with
the threat to reveal the truth to her
affianced, he boasts that his conquest
was but to win a bet. In her anger
and frenzy she strikes him with a load
ed riding whip and kills him, but with
out criminal intention. She conceals
and disposes of the man's body. But
the tragedy by unfortunate accident
becomes known to her sister. As the
heroine, telling this trusted one, how it
came about, her affianced overhears the
confession and discloses himself. There
upon she avows the deed anew, declares
that she gave the blow because it was
provoked and because she was frenzied,
i and appeals to him, "Was it Murder?"
j The reply is "No; had I been there I
would have delivered the blow." And
the play ends with the unhappy woman j
received to the arms of her affianced.
Such, in brief, is the plot of the play.
How nearly it runs with the story of
the book we do not pretend to say. But
jit is a strong drama, well acted, su
perbly mounted and staged and robed
with great richness. Miss Blair and
Mr. Bramwell are the central figures
of the tragedy. All others are little
more than mere accessories, the frame
work as it were upon which j
j the workings of the plot by
] the two leaders ts hung. Mr.
Bramwell is an accomplished, all
around and a finished actor, judging by
the care, feeling and spirit with which
he enacts the role of the brutal rake,
whose fine raiment and blue blood do j
not conceal the rascal or relieve his !
diabolical arts of their infamy. Miss |
Blair is a stately, handsome and grace- \
ful actress, whose heroine commansis j
the sympathy of the auditor, inspires j
his respect and wins for her the ver- j
! d ; ct cf not guilty. The shadings she j
gives the character are as delicate as
ever painter laid on canvas. There is j
exquisite care not to over-color or draw j
too strongly, or step over the bounds i
of naturalness. However, it may have
been regarded in the seventeenth cen
tury, when accountability for the tak
ing of human life was not perhaps as
strict as in this later period, yet even j
under the laws of that time Clorinda
would have been held guilty of man
slaughter, though it may well be !
doubted if a verdict of guilty could j
have been then secured any more than
in this day, in which, when the test
is applied, men are not less chivalrous
than in the more courtly times.
Joseph Eisendrath, manager of the
Banner-Brand Opera Company, is in
the city negotiating with Manager
Ficks for the appearance of that com
pany here at any early day.
Friday night at the Clunie we are
to have once more, after a lapse of
many yeans, the splendid spectacular
war drama by Bronson Howard, en
titled "Shenandoah." There are forty
two people in the company, a hand of
trained horses, and two carloads of
special scenery. This time the piece
will have the added effect of cavalry,
whereas before there was only artillery
and infantry and a single mounted offi
cer. But now the artillery effects are
quadrupled and a troop of cavalry used,
and the whole piece has been intensi
fied. It has been running two weeks in
San Francisco, and every night large
numbers have been turned from the
doors of the theater, unable to gain ad
mission, such is the attractiveness of
the spectacle, and so realistic are the
war effects introduced. Withal, a
charming story of love, pathos and
humor runs through the play, sustain
ing the interest at greatest possible
hight from the rising of the curtain un
til its final fall. It is the same com
pany to appear here that revived the
play under the Jacob Litt management
in New York in IS9B at the Broadway-
Theater, where the piece had a phe
nomenal run to crowded houses. It is
said that it was a common thing there
for old soldiers to rise in their seats
and cheer the scenes with wild enthusi
asm. General Miles witnessed the pro
duction in Chicago and pronounced it
the finest stage war spectacle of all
the many- he had seen, and in many
respects a historical picture. In the
play Sheridan appears at the head of
his cavalry; the battle of Cedar Creek
is depicted; there is an artillery duel;
a charge of cavalry by highly trained
horses and examples of signaling by
torch and by flags.
Robert Elliott, who plays Colonel
Kerchival West, was born in Belfast,
Ireland. At the age of 9 years he ran
away from home and entered the Brit
ish navy. He served with distinction
under Sir Charles Beresford at the
bombardment of Alexandria, and mad-;
his debut as an amateur actor on board
H. M. S. Victoria. He attracted the
attention of W T ilson Barrett, the noted
English actor, and made his profession
al debut in his company, playing Spid
er in "The Silver King" at the Princess
Theater, London. The artillery attach
ment of the "Shenandoah" company
will parade from 11 a. m. to
1 p. m., on the 15th, under command of
Sergeant James Warren, formerly a
member of Roosevelt's Rough Riders.
Whose Robe Is It?
Officers Douglas and Michael Fisher
yesterday afternoon arrested a man
named F. Winder for petit larceny. He
had a buggy robe on his bed, which he
confessed having stolen from a buggy
on the street, but no loss of a robe has
been reported at the police station, and
the officers are anxious to have the
owner claim it, so as to complete the
case against W T inder.

FEDERATION OF LABOR.
Annual Report of the Executive
Council Read.
DETROIT, Dec, 12.—At to-day's ses
sion of the American Federation of La
bor Convention the Executive Council
of the federation reported its doings
for the year.
The report stated that the brewery
workers still retained some of the sta
tionary engineers in their unions, not
withstanding the Executive Council had
declared that the two should be sep
arated. A similar state of affairs ex
isted between the brewers and coopers.
Controversies between local unions of
shoemakers and their national organ -
! ization were reported to be in process
iof amicable adjustment.
The council had been unable to ad
just the difficulties between the factious
jof the Painters' Association.
The bricklayers had approved a prop
osition for affiliation with the federa
tion.
The council reported adversely on the
request of the bartenders to form a
separate union, instead of ueing afflli
i ated with the waiters and restaurant
employes.
The report said that the typograph
ical and printing machine machinists'
unions are still at variance, the former
having decreed that the latter must
be members of their organization,
which action the machinists refused to
indorse.
The council expressed disapproval ot
the sending out of boycott circulars b>
any local or national union without
having first referred the matter to the
federation.
On recommendation of the Resolu
tions Committee, the Executive Council
was empowered to take action in in
vestigating the Idaho labor-military
troubles.
A flood of resolutions were intro
duced, covering nearly every subject of
interest to labor interests.
During the afternoon the delegates
had a half-hour diversion listening to
Miss Susan, B. Anthony, who made an
appeal to the federation to join in a
petition to Congress to refer to the
State Legislatures for indorsement a
proposed sixteenth constitutional
amendment providing for enfranchise
ment of woman.
CABINET MEETING.
Almost Wholly Devoted to Discus
sion of Porto Rico.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 12.—The Cab
inet meeting to-day was almost wholly
devoted to a discussion of the political
and financial conditions in Porto Rico.
The matter was brought up by Secre
tary Root, who stated that a com
munication had been received from the
Governor General of the island inclos- j
ing petitions describing the situation, '
and asking- for action by Congress
which would determine their political
status and relation to the United States.
While the island itself has no public
debt, yet the planters as a rule, it is
said, are heavily involved. No money
is coming into the country for invest
ment, and altog-ether the situation is
not calculated to foster trade or com
merce.
The Secretary of War shares the
views of the Governor General and peo
ple, and is extremely desirous that Con
gress shall take early action to secure
the islanders a stable form of Govern
ment. It is understood that the Secre
tary of War and President McKinley
and all the members of the Cabinet are
in favor of giving the Porto Ricans a
form of Government similar to that
given to Louisiana at the time of the
purchase of that Territory from th?
French in 1803. It authorized the
President of the United States to ap
point a Governor for the Territory, and
at the same time authorized him to
appoint a number of citizens of the
country who were empowered to leg
islate for the Territory. The Governor
had the veto power, and his acts in
turn were subject to review by the
President of the United States.
It is not altogether improbable that
the President within the next few weeks
will send a message to Congress re
viewing the situation in Porto Rico,
and asking that measures may be taken
to bring about a more satisfactory state
of affairs in the island.
A Disabled Steamer Reaches Port.
DULUTH (Minn.), Dec. 12.—The
steamer Dixon, which plies between
here and Port Arthur, Ont., and along
the north shore, reached port to-day
after a night spent adrift and dis
abled. Her wheel was disabled, and
she held into the wind by the aid of a
jib. A tug rescued her after midnight
off Two Harbors. Five passengers took
a small boat during the night and ar
rived at Two Harbors more dead than
alive from cold and exhaustion.
A Steamer Ashore.
SANDUSKY (O.), Dec. 12.—The
steamer Point Abina, coal laden, went
ashore on Ballast Island Reef to-day
and probably will be a total wreck.
The crew is still on board, but It is
believed all will be able to reach shore.
An Architect Commits Suicide.
NEW YORK, Dec 12.—Stephen P.
Anderson, a wealthy architect and
builder, committed suicide to-day by
shooting himself. There Is no known
cause for the act. He was 42 years
old. j
