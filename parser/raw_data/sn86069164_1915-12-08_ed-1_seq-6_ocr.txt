THE CLIHAX4IADIS6NIAN, WEDNESDAY, DEC. 8, 1915
"Sd&mdM- PRESIDENT
They widened Rt the 6lght; then the
smiles brimmed over, and her whole
face broke up Into glee. How .w'd
she feel strange or afraid in a place
where big, grownup men though they
were such signs of expectancy were
so openly displayed? She slipped from
the protecting arm and rs.n close to the
hearth, clapping her hands in delight.
"Oh, you're all ready for Santa
Claus!" she cried. "My, how he'll have
to work there's such a 'normous lot!
But he'll fill 'em all." She threw out
this balm In eager haste. "He's truly
coming. He said so. If I'd gone home
with him his house would have crack
ed to to smlther-eens, so I stayed."
I A deafening roar of laughter greeted
her words and sent her, unerringly as
a homing bird, back to her first friend,
who still knelt on the floor. But, rest
ing against him, her fears vanished
almost Instantly, and, as she glanced
around with renewed confidence,, her
pretty silvery laugh tinkled out to Join
their rougher merriment The men
pressed closer, one of them, the oldest,
acting as spokesman. He was the man
whose chimney had never seen any
Christmas stockings banging before it,
the baby's sock being too tiny in that
faraway year, but he seemed to know
better than any of them how to ask
just the right questions that would set
free the little tongue. Betty climbed
gladly up on his knee, and from her
new perch poured forth an account of
her wonderful adventures.
It was the fault of her companions,
surely, and not her own that the things
that were so real and true to her were
like myths out of fairyland to them
because they had traveled farther
down the stream of time. Much of
what she said was unintelligible to
their dull, grownup minds. But if each
word had been of gold tbey could not
have waited for it more eagerly, and
when she stopped In her recital of that
marvelous Journey to laugh at some
remembrance of Santa Claus" fooling
they looked at One another, smiling in
perfectest sympathy. Perhaps, after
all, they understood. Who shall say?
There was no interruption except when
bid Jerome hazarded some remark that
helped on the tale, and the only person
to move was a tall, gaunt man, who
bent mysteriously over the fire and
made something that am el led like like
the most delicious thing in all the
world. You have to lide for hours
through the snow and feel the keen air
y in your face and
be as hungry as
a bear into the
bargain to know
Just what that Is.
By some re
markable law of
coincidence the
story and the
cooking came to
an end at one
and the same mo
ment. Nothing
could have been
more timely. Bet
ty's whole atten
tion was quickly
transferred to
the tin plate
which was placed
before her, and
her evident ap
preciation of the
good things of
life was so keen
that the lookers

had learned that their rougher ways
frightened her, laughed gently among
themselves. Well, they understood that
too! While she was busy over her sup
per, to the utter forgetting of her sur
roundings, several of the men went
outside to see If they could find any
traces of the recreant Santa Claus.
They returned, after a hasty search,
bringing in the barrel and bags suf
ficient proof that Terry, despite all
convictions, wise head shakings and
gloomy forebodings, had not failed
them. He had kept his word. But the
mystery deepened. Who was the little
maid? Aside from her name, which
was an unfamiliar one to them, they
had not been able to learn anything
definite about her. The excited little
brain only seemed to live over the Im
mediate past, iu which Santa Claus
had figured so importantly, the fact
that she was his sweetheart apparent
ly outweighing every other considera
tion. "Terry O'Connor hain't a chick nor
child an never hed," old Jerome de
clared stoutly, as somebody ventured
this solution of the difficulty, "nor
there ain't any kin b'longln' to him.
Guess I orter to know I've knowed
him 'nintlmut these thirty years"
"Losh, man," interrupted Sandy,
"then he Just luveegled the bairn awa',
makiu' oot he was Santa Claus! The
e-normlty of it!"
"Oh, Terry must olluz be Jokin'. It's
his way," Jerome returned tolerantly.
wun nis arm around the small form
and the little golden head resting on
his breast he was knowing one of the
rare, happy moments of his life. There
could be scant condemnation from him
under the circumstances.
Betty, who had been alternately
blinking at the fire and smiling con
tentedly to herself for some time, now
interrupted any dispute that might
have arisen concerning ber absent
friend by giving utterance to a series
of baby yawns. The discussion came
to a speedy close, such signs needing
no Interpretation to her hearers.
"Don't ye want to go to sleep, deary?"
the old man asked.
She signified her willinguess without
delay, though first her stocking must
be hung up among the others. lie pro

When this "sure as sure" knowledge
had been mastered he striped off the

swinging slightly to and fro in tfie
breath of the fire, but it died away on
the instant, for the child bad slipped
to the floor and knelt there by the old
man's knee, her face hidden In her
chubby hands. Perhaps in the intense
stillness she missed the voice that gen
erally guided hers, for there was a mo
ment of hesitation on her part. Then
she began to pray aloud, halting over
the words:
"Jesus, tender shepherd, hear me; '
Bless thy little Iamb tonight;
In the darkness be thou near me.
Keep me safe till morning light.
Let my sina be all forgiven,
Blesa the friends I love so well.
Take me when I die to heaven.
There forever with thee to dwell."
She paused a moment. "And please.
God, take care of muwer and uncle
and faraway daddy and make Betty
a good girl f rever and ever. Amen."
It was very still all around, and
usually when she finished ber prayers
a soft cheek was laid against her own,
while a soft voice echoed "Amen," and
that meant "My heart wants it to be
exactly so!" Now, however, no one
spoke. Betty glanced wonderingly
about as she rose to her feet, a trifle
dazed and even frightened, but such
grave, quiet, kind faces looked back at
her that swiftly she dropped to her
knees again, with another petition,
"God bless everybody an' most speshil
ly Santa Claus."
"Amen," said old Jerome In the
pause that followed.
A bed had been hastily constructed
In the warmest corner out of the best
materials the camp afforded, and thith
er Jerome carried the child. She nes
tled down drowsily while he tucked
the covering about her. But his was
an alien touch, and through the room
there suddenly sounded a low, walling
cry:
"Muwer oh, muwer"
"There, honey! There, blossom"
the man's voice broke, the hand that
soothed was clumsy and old, and It
trembled. "There, honey"
The men sat breathless waiting,
dreading to hear the cry again, but mo
ment after moment passed, and it did
not come. There was one little sob;
then the dream fairy stooped with her
comfort.
How quiet the room was! And this
was Christmas . eve the time when
each man was to do a stunt for the
amusement of bis fellows and the glo
ry of himself. Generally on this occa
sion the lord of misrule held high car
nivalthe flowing bowl was like a per
petual fountain, and laughter, shout
lug and horseplay abounded on every
side. There was rum In plenty since
.ierry nad not failed them, but no ef-
rort was made to secure it. Desire of
that kind was dead, it seemed. They
were content to sit there listening to
the soft rise and fall of the child's
breath; the land of dreams into which
she had slipped open to them also.
And though it was so different"" from
those other Christmas eves it was far
from being dull. Into each heart there
had crept a soft glow, which did not
come from the blaring logs and which
uo grog, no matter how skillfully
blended, could have given, for once
again the presence of one of God's lit
tle ones, made holy a humble place.
Shawe was the first to bring the still
ness to an end. They, had been sit
ting quiet, nobody could tell how long,
ivben be got to his feet. Noiselessly
s he moved he broke the spell, and
eyes that had grown misty looked at
him, some with resentment, others
with curiosity and others again with
reproach. Old Jerome's gaze held the
latter quality. Nobody knew much
about Shawe. anyway. He was not
one of them. He had come to the
camp some weeks before and would be
gone in a day or so up to Merle this
time, and then He was a wanderer
some outcast, perhaps, from a better
life gone by. Nobody knew him. Thej
had no quarrels with him. He was 8
good enough fellow, only not of them.
They watched him. therefore, almost
coldly, yet noting with Jealous satis-,
faction that he stepped warily as he
passed from the room. Then they fell
to thinking again with a difference.
He came back after a short absence
with a soft, dark mink's skin in his
hand a bit of fur that a woman's fin
gers could fashion into a cap to covet
a child's golden hair and went to the
small stocking, cramming the gift fai
down to keep that other company. A
breath of approval fairly twinkled
around the room. The grave faces
melted iuto smiling delight, and Just
as the circles widen in a pool of water
when a stone U thrown in. spreading
faxtfcer'-ajid farther t$ tlae whole sur-
race is disturbed, so every one present
came within the influence of Shawe's
action. As If by one accord the men
hurriedly left their places, making
scarcely any noise, yet Jostling against
one another in their eagerness to play
at being Santa Claus, each man seek
lng out his kit and returning with
what would be the likeliest thing to
please a little child,
A bright red handkerchief, an orange
one, a third as many colored as Jo
seph's coat, an old habitant sash
worth Its weight in gold to a connois
seur, a scarfpln set with a cairngorm
the size of a man's thumbnail this
from Sandy! a (you mustn't laugh)
pair of brand new suspenders and big
and little coins that spelled liquor or
tobacco to the givers and cow bought
wnat pieasea tnem infinitely more.
Of course one stocking couldn't begin
to hold the gifts, though . they were
massed Into a dizzy pyramid at the
top, so its mate was pressed Into serv
ice and crowded likewise. There was
a distressing similarity In the presents
when you came to think of It, espe
cially wbere handkerchiefs were con
cerned. Still, no man withheld his
giving because another's choice was
necessarily the same. He added his
contribution proudly, as If It were the
only one of its kind; Frenchy. who

really beautiful little frame which his
deft fingers had made In the long even
ings, and the cook, when no one was
looking, slipped In his prayer book,

night would have laughed at his having-

they called Kid he was something of
a dandy added a ring of massive pro
portions. It wasn't gold, but he pre
tended it was and liked to wear It
when he went to dances to make the
girls think he was a fine, op and com
ing man. And- Jerome poor old
Jerome!
It was a very meager kit that he
rummaged through again and again
one that he himself had packed, and
when a man has to take care of him
self he doesn't put in any useless
traps, any what you'd call gewgaws,
not when he Is old, that Is. So he
could find nothing there, and a search
through his pockets revealed the same
depressing poverty. He had nothing
nothing but a certain battered snuff
box that had been his companion for
so many years that It would be easier
to Imagine him without his head than
without the box. He was evidently
of that opinion, for he Btowed it down
In his pocket with an air of great final
ity. But nevertheless, polished to an
almost glittering show of youth and
filled with coins, it very fitly crowned
the motley collection.
It had taken some time to play San
ta Claus, for each man had to wait
his turn to stow nway his gift. There
were no deputies allowed on this occa
sion, .and " the

and they knew the blessedness of
peace and good will. Happy? There

FOLLOWING is the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate and
bouse at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the 'Congress Since I
last - had the - privilege - of -addressing
you on the state of the Onion the war
of nations on the other side of the sea;
which bad then only begun to disclose
its portentous proportions; has extend-,
ed Its threatening and sinister scop
until it baa swept - within Its flame
some portion of every quarter of the
globe, not 'excepting oar' own hemi
sphere, baa altered the whole face of
International affairs, and now presents
a prospect of reorganization and re
construction - such aa statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before. .
We have stood apart, Btudiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do
so. Not only did we bave no part or
Interest in the policies which seem to
have brought the conflict on; It was
necessary. If a universal catastrophe
was to. be avoided, that a limit should
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great fam
ily of nations should keep the process
es of peace alive, if only to prevent
collective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the in
dustries by which iu populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self-governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, If possi
ble, the balance of economic loss and
confusion la the other, if they could
do nothing more. In the day of read
justment and recuperation we earnest
ly hope and believe that tbey can be
of Infinite service.
In this neutrality, to which tbey
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from the politics of Europe, but
also by a clear perception of interna
tional duty, the states of America have
become conscious of a new and more
vital community of interest and moral
partnership In affairs, more clearly
conscious of the many common sympa
thies and Interests and duties which
bid them stand together. -.
There was a time In the early days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to independ
ence In Central and South America
when the government of the United
States looked upon Itself as In some
sort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any . en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water;
felt It its duty to play tbe part even
without Invitation from them, and 1
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and disin
terested' ' enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and tbe unmolested
self government of ber independent
peoples. But it was always difficult to
maintain such a role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect
and without provoking serious mis
conceptions of our motives, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come tbe altered circumstances of the
new day in whose light we now stand,
when there Is no claim of guardian
ship or thought of wards, but Instead
a full and honorable association as of
partners between ourselves and our
neighbors In tbe Interest of all Amer
ica, north and south. Our concern for
the Independence and prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
Is not altered. We retain unabated the
spirit that has Inspired us throughout
the whole life of our government and
which was so frankly put Into words
by President Monroe. , We still mean
always to -make a -common -cause of
national Independence and of political
liberty In America. , But that purpose
is now better understood so far as it
concerns ourselves. It is known not to
be a selfish purpose. It is known to
have In It no tbongbt of taking advan
tage of any government in this hemi
sphere or playing its political fortunes
for our own benefit. All the govern
ments of America stand, so far as we
are concerned, upon a footing of genu
ine equality and unquestioned Inde
pendence. We bave been put to the test In the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test.: Whether we have benefited Mex
ico by the course we have pursued re
mains to be Been. Ber fortunes are In
her own bands. " But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan
tage of her In her distress and under
take' to impose upon her an order and
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often a fierce and Intractable
thing, to which no bounds can be, set
ana to whloh no hounds 'or a few
men's choosing ought ever to be set.
Every American' who has-drunk at
the true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of rights,- which in the great
days la which bur government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed as the creed-of free men. That doc
trine is. That; government Is or ought
to be instituted for tbe common bene
fit, protection and security of tbe people.-
nation or community;" that "of
all the various modes aod forms of
government, that Is the best which Is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness and safety and Is
most effectually secured' against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any governmeut shall be found
Inadequate or contrary to -these pur
poses a majority of the community,
hath an indubitable. Inalienable and
indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish It in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We bave unhesitatingly op
pHed that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of tbe troubled republic.

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
'. -
Economie Adjustments Inevitable With
in the Next Generation.
The moral la that tbe states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their grow
ing sense of-- community of interest,
alike In matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and hi tbe political his
tory of tbe world. ' It presents them as
In a very deep and true sense a unit
In world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common Ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics or a world of hos
tile rivalries; united In spirit and par
pose, they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny. - -
This Is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire in It. It Is the
embodiment, tbe effectual embodiment,
of tbe spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service. I
A very notable body of men recently
met in the city of Washington, at the
Invitation and as tbe guests of this
government, whose deliberations are"
likely to be looked back to as marking
a memorable turning point In the his
tory of America. They were repre
sentative spokesmen of the several In
dependent states of this hemisphere
and were assembled to discuss the
financial and commercial relations of
the republics of the two continents
which nature and political fortune
have so Intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend to your perusal
tbe reports of their proceedings and of
the actions of their committee ST" Toil
will get from them. I think, a fresh
conception of the ease nnd Intelligence
and advantage with which Americans
of both continents may draw together
In practical co-operntlon and of what
the material foundation! of this hope
ful partnership of Interest must consist--of
how we should build them and
of how necessary it is that we should
basten their building.
There is, I venture to point out. an
especial significance Just now attach-1
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together iu bonds or hon
orable partnership and mutual advan
tage because of tbe economic readjust
ments which the world must inevitably
witness within the next generation. '
when peace shall have at last resumed .
Its' healthful tasks. In tbe perform- j
ance of these tasks I believe the Amer- !
leas to be destined to play tbelr parts
together. I am interested to fix your ,
attention on this prospect now because
unless you take it within your view
and permit the full significance of it to
command your thought I cannot find -the
right light in which to set forth ,
tbe particular matter that lies at the j
very front of my whole thought as I
address you today. . I mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom we
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive that their passion is for peace,
their genius best displayed hi the prac
tice of the arts of peace. -- Great democ
racies are not belligerent. Tbey do not
seek or desire war. Tbelr thought is
-of Individual liberty and of tbe free
labor that supports life and the un
cen sored thought that quickens it.
Conquest and dominion are not In our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and tbe undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right and
liberty, we resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security in prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that. We demand It
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty and
free national development to tbe inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these diflicult paths of independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on thia side the sea and have
deemed It os important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
doaiiuatiou 03 that we ourselves should
be; bave set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
fol'tieal freemen.

means of asserting tbe rights of a peo

as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta

SUGGESTS BROAD ,PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It Is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting Is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves Immediately avail
able and immediately effective. And
tbe government must be their servant
In this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
arm of their government which tbey
will not allow to direct them, tbey may
properly use to serve them and make
their Independence secure, and not
their own Independence merely, but
the rights also of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put In Jeopardy. Tbey
must be fitted to play tbe great role
In the world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which tbey are quali
Bed by principle and by chastened am
bltlon to piny.
It Is wib these Ideals In mind that
the plans of the department of war for
more adequate national defense were
conceived which will be laid before
you, and which I urge you to sanctiod
and put Into effect as soon as tbey can
be properly scrutinized and discussed.
Tbey seem to me the essential first
steps, and they seem to me for the
present sufficient
Tbey contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of tbe regular army
from Its present strength of 5,023 offi
cers and 102.9S5 enlisted men of all
services to a strength of 7,138 officers
and 134,707 enlisted men. or 141,843
all told, all services, rank and file, by
tbe addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four
regiments of field artillery and four
aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently speak. 792 non
commissioned officers for service in
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, the hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are- the additions necessary to render
the army adequate for Its present du
ties, duties which it has to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but also In the Philippines.
In the Hawaiian Islands, at the Isth
mus and In Porto Rico.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part of its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing tbe army
by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi
zens, raised In increments of 133.000 a
year throughout a period of three,
years. This it Is proposed to do by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of the country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
Ing for short periods throughout three
years and to come to tbe colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough period of three years. This
force of 400.000 men would be pro
vided with personal accouterments as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to be supplied
at any time. Tbey would be assem
bled for training at stated Intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units of the regular army.
Their period of annual training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
the year.
It would depend upon the patriotic
feeling of tbe younger men of the
country whether they responded to
such a call to service or not It
would depend upon the patriotic spirit
of the employers of the country wbeth
er they made It possible for the young
er men In their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not I for
one do not doubt the patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of those
who give them employment those for
whose benefit . and protection they
would In fact enlist I would look
forward to the success of such aa ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense eeems to roe to be ab
solutely Imperative now. We cannot
do less.
COMPREHENSIVE FLAM
FR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It aa Cur First end
Chief Line of Defense.
Tbo j-ro-am wtic'a ""i3 t i'ljM be
fore you by the secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of tbe time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out but It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only Implicit held In tbe minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed in tbe debates of tbe two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that It will be to tbe advantage
of tbe country for tbe congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting tbe
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense; we have always
seen It to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on tbe seas.
Year by year we have been' creating a
navy which now ranks very high In
deed among the navies of tbe maritime
nations. We should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
we have begun and how soon.
The program to be laid before you
contemplates the construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten Scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines,
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It Is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines,
twenty-five coast submarines, two gun
boats and one hospital ship; tbe second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; tbe third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines; the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni
tion ship and on. fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de
stroyers, two fleet submarines. Dtten
coast submarines, one gunboat' one am
munition ship and one repair ship.
The secretary of the navy is asking
also for tbe immediate addition to the
personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors.
2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma
rines. This increase would be suffi
cient to care for-the ships which are
to be completed within the fiscal year
1917 and also for- the number of men
which must be put in training to man
tbe ships which will be completed
early in 1918. It Is also necessary that
the number of midshipmen at the Na
val academy at Annapolis should be
Increased by at least 300 in order that
the force of officers should be more
rapidly added to. and authority Is ask
ed to appoint, for- engineering duties
only, approved graduates. of engineer
ing colleges, and for service In tbe avi
ation corps a certain number of men
taken from civil life.
COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE
FINE MERCHANT MARINE.
United 8tatea Should Be Its Own Car
rier on the Seas.
- If this full program should be carried
out we should have built or building In
1921, according to the estimates of sur
vival and standards .of classification
followed by the general board of the
department, an effective navy consist
ing of 27 battleships of the first line, C
battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the
second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13
scout cruisers, S first class cruisers. 3
second class cruisers. 10 third class
cruisers, 108 destroyers, IS fleet sub
marines, 157 coast submarines, 6 mon
itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, 13
fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to
torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special
types and two ammunition ships. This
would be a navy fitted to our needs
and worthy of our traditions.
But armies and Instruments of war
are only part of what has to be con
sidered If we are to consider the su
preme matter of national self sufficien
cy and security In all Its aspects.
There are other great matters which
will be thrust upon our attention
whether we will or not There is, for
example,' a very pressing question of
trade and shipping involved in this
great problem of national adequacy.
It Is necessary for many weighty rea
sons of national efficiency and devel
opment that we should have n great
merchant marine. The great merchant
fleet we once used to make us rich,
that great body of sturdy sailors who
used to carry our flag into every sea.
and who were the pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by Inexcusable
neglect and Indifference and by a "hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of
so called economic protection. It Is
high time we repaired our mistake and
resumed our commercial Independence
on tbe seas.
For It is a question of independence.
If other nations go to war or seek to
hamper each other's commerce our
merchants, it seems, are at their mer
cy to do with as they please. We must
use their ships and use them as they
determine. We have not ships enoogh
of our own. We cannot handle our
own commerce on the seas. Our Inde
pendence Is provincial, and Is only on
land and within our own borders. We
are not likely to bo-permitted Dse
even the ships of other nations in ri
valry of their own trade and are with
out means to extend our commerce
even where tbe doors are wide open
and our goods desired. Such a situa
tion is not to be endured. It is of capi
tal importance not only that tbe Unit
ed States should be Its own carrier on
the seas and enjoy the economic lnde-

penaence wmcb only an dquat
merchant marine would give It, but
also that the American hemisphere as
a whole should enjoy a like Independ
ence and self sufficiency, if It ist net
to be drawn Into the taogie of Euro
pean affairs. Without such independ
ence the whole question of Our polit
ical unity and self determination is
very seriously clouded and complicated
Indeed.
Moreover, we can develop no true or
effective American policy without ships
of our own not ships of war, but
ships of peace, carrying goods and car
rying much more; creating friendships
and rendering Indispensable service te
all interests on this side the water.
They must move constantly back and
forth between the Americas. They are
the only shuttles that can weave the
delicate fabric of sympathy, compre
hension, confidence and mutual de
pendence in which we wish to clothe
our policy of America for Americana.
The- task of building up aar adequate
merchant marine -for America private
capital must ultimately undertake and
achieve, as it has undertaken and
achieved every other like task among
us In the past with admirable enter
prise. Intelligence and vigor, and It
seems to me a manifest dictate of wis
dom that we should promptly remove
every legal obstacle that may stand la
tbe way of this much to be desired re
vival of our old independence and
should facilitate In every possible way
the building, purchase and Americas
registration of ships.' But capital can
not accomplish this great task of a
sudden. It must embark upon It by
degrees, as the opportunities of trade
develop. Something must be done at
once, done to open routes and develop
opportunities where tbey are as yet
undeveloped, done to open the arteries
of trade where the currents have not
yet learned to run. especially bet wee a
the two American continents, wber
tbey are, singularly enough, yet to bo
created and qulckeaed. and it Is evi
dent that only the government can un
dertake such beginnings and asnia
tbe Initial financial risks. When tbe
risk has passed and private capital be
gins to find Its way In sufficient abun
dance into these new channels tbe gov
erniiMat may withdraw. But It can
not omit jrfn.- it should take.th
first steps, and take them at
once. Our goods must bwi piled up
at our ports and -stored upw.
tracks In freight cars which are daily
needed on tbe roads, must not be left
without means of transport to any for
eign quarter. We must not awall tbe
permission of foreign shipowners and
foreign governments to send them,

With a view to meeting' these press'
bag necessities of our commerce and

opportunity of linking tbe two Ameri

may never return again If we. miss It
now. proposals -will be made . to the
present congress for the purchase or
construction of ships to be owned sad

I recommend these proposals to you
for your 'prompt acceptance with th

posals were made has msde tbe ne
cessity for such action more and more
manifestly Imperative.' That need was
then 'foreseen.--It l-ior acutely -felt
and everywhere realized by those for

find no conveyance for their goods. 1
am not so much Interested In tbe par
ticulars of the program as I am la

great opportunity which awaits us If
we will but act In this emergency. In
this matter, aa In all others, a spirit of
common counsel should prevail, and
out of it should come an early solu

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY
IN THE PHILIPPINES.
Recommends Early Adoption of Meas
ures Giving Them Fuller Juetice.
There is another matter which seems
to me to be very Intimately associated
with the question of national safety
and preparation for defense. That Is
our policy toward the Philippines and
the people of Porto Rico. Our treat
ment of them and their attitude to
ward us are manifestly of tbe first con
sequence in . tbe development of our
duties In tbe world and In getting; a
free hand to perform those duties.:. We
must be free from every unnecessary
burden or embarrassment a ad there
Is no better way to be clear of em
barrassment than to fulfill our prom
ises and promote the Interests of those
dependent on us to the utmost . Bills
for theaIteration and reform of tbe
government of tbo Philippines and for
rendering fuller political Justice to tbe
people of Porto mco were submitted
to the Sixty-third congress. They will
be submitted also to you. I need not
particaiarize tbelr details. Too are
most of you already familiar with
them. But I do recommend them to
your early adoption with the sincere
conviction that there are few measures
you could . adopt which would ' more
serviceably clear the way for the great
policies by ' which we wish ' to make
good, now and always, our right to lead
In enterprises of peace and good will
and economic and political freedom.
The plans for the armed forces 'of
the nation which I have outlined and
for the general policy of adequate prep
aration for mobilization and defense
Involve, of course, very large addition

which will considerably exceed tbe es-
