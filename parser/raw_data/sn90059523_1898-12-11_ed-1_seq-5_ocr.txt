tention as chief of an important bureau of the
gcneial government, during the present ad
ministration, as it has been fittingly said
that officeholders seldom die and never re
sign, and It ls presumable that he is no ex
ception to the common run of persistent ap
pointed officials. The palliating answer of the
secretary to the many severe criticisms of the
public condemnatory of his administration of
the war department, as given ln his published
interviews, writings and sayings, in which he
repeatedly urges, in words to the effect, that
the public has but a faint conception of the
mighty duties that devolved upon him in
malting preparations for the conflict and ar
ranging for the movement of the troops, and
that the country wa3 wholly unprepared for
war in consequence of its coming on so un
expectedly, and that the officers and soldiers
are mainly to blame for the exposures, sick
ness and mortalities in camps, is a shallow
tissue of excuses to offer to an intelligent
public in answer to grave charges of misman
agement, and this frivolous method of dis
missing questions of deep interest to the peo
ple at large furnishes conspicuous evidence
of the weakness of the head of the military
affairs of the nation. The claim that the re
sults of the recent state elections is an in
dorsement of the conduct of the war shows
a lack of comprehension of public opinion,
from the fact that while the people ardently
favored and supported the war, they are prac
tically unanimous In condemning the faulty
manner in which it lias been managed. Con
sidering the heavy load of Algerian incompe
tency which the Republican party has to
shoulder, it is a subject of public surprise
thai the elections resulted as favorably to the
party as they did, and it is generally under
stood that the moderate success achieved was
wholly due to the steadfast patriotism of the
people to uphold the war and strengthen the
government in every possible way to insure
an early treaty of peace embodying satis
factory concessions to the I'nited States.
While it is essential that the war bureau
should at all times be in charge of a secretary
of marked ability, it. is especially desirable
at this critical period of the nation's history,
that the cabinet officer of this important de
partment of the executive should be a man
of eminent attainments, one who ls thor
oughly competent and in whose judgment
ana advice the people have implicit confi
dence. It would be extremely advantageous
If the nation had an able and popular states
man to advise and administer the affairs of
tbe military establishment, at this particular
time, when questions of vital importance to
i the welfare of the country are being consid
ered to devise the best and most practical
plans for the government of and also for the
development of the trade and resources of
the large and populous islands coming under
control of the I'nited Statfe*, and to de
c-id. upon the future size and distribution of
tho standing army, a size based on actual
needs instead of an off-hand proposal that the
regular army should number 100.(WO with
numerous titled, high-salaried officers, an
enumeration arrived at apparently for the
reason that an even one hundred Is a ready
I number of thousands to use in this connec
tion. It is probable that a regular army of
55,000, appropriately officered and largely re
; cruited from the residents of the Islands in
i alliance with the United States, will be ample,
if a favorable treaty with Spain is ral
and peace is preserved and the military affairs
of the nation are discreetly managed. Thia
would save to the government the expense of
maintaining 15,000 extra troops as against the
number proposed by the secretary of war. The
importance! of exercising rigid economy in the
public expenditures while the country Is re
covering from an expensive war seems to
have been lost sight of by those in authority
who are recommi adlng excessive appropria
tions Involving a constant increase of the
■ lie debt.
The impression is widespread in the minds
of the American people, that the country
stands in urgent need of a inoad-niinded -•■-•
--try of war, one whom the public respects
i nnd .an rely upon to adept practical and
Domical methods in conducting military oper
ations both at home and in the island coun
tries where detachments of troops are re
-1 quired, and who will select capable officers
for responsible positions, provide for the
j proper care of the troops, and make suitable
j arrangements, free from persona! favoritl
i for carrying out the measures which congr ss
i may adopt to meet the new conditions arising
from the war, and conduct ihe military estab
lishment of the nation, generally, in a manner
which, will give satisfaction to the people and
which in the estimation of the world at large
will be creditable to the republic.

THK ANNUAL ROW.
To The St. Paul Olobe:
There is an old pedagogical but marvel
ously pregnant saw which runs: "The suc
ci ssful t. a. lu-r needs not to demand the de
ference of his pupils, for, by the fore.' of
his character, he commands it." Of course
all saws must be taken with more or less
salt, and this one must be seasoned with a I
recognition of the indisputable fact that in
every school will be found the hard-headed
individuals upon whom very sharp and ex
plicit demands must be made. But when
there are regular head-end collisions between
a teacher or teachers and the whole school,
a class or other organized bedy of pupils, so
frequently that the event is spoken of as
the -annual row," there arises a suspicion
which grows into a conviction that some
thing is awry with the pedagogical en
gineers and conductors.
We have several high schools in this city,
but the 'annual row" ln the Central is giving
that institution an unenviab'.e notoriety, and
cannot fail to have a distracting and de
moralizing effect upon the spirit of the
school. Furthermore, such squabbles but add
to the chagrin with which citizens read the
derisive and critical paragraphs contained in
outside newspapers and magazines upon the
St. Paul public schools, owing to the late
learned (?) controversy upon the subject of
evolution. r»K.,„

$20,000,000 for What?
For what is the United States to pay twenty
millions to Spain? For Dewey's victory at
Manila? For bampson's off Santiago" For
bhafters in Cuba? Or is it proposed to giv.
the Spaniards these twenty millions for the
Philippine group? Why twenty million dol
lars or twenty cents? The Spaniards do not
possess the Philippines. If twenty millions
are to be paid to Spain for what she dee*
not possess, how many millions are tc be
paid to the Philippine insurgents for what
they do possess by right of conquest made
for freedom? The money given to Spain
as a compensation for her loss of the islands
must be either a charity or a purchase of a
fraudulent title. Xo one thinks it is a
charity. We do not want a defective title,
to sustain which will cost millions of money
and lives not to be estimated. If we are
THE ST. PAUL GLOBE SUNDAY DECEMBER 11, 1893.
to buy we must buy from the Filipino. Make
no mistake about that.—New York Press
(Rep.).
• • •
As Spain does not possess nor control the
Philippine islands, the most important of
which outside of Manila are now in the
hands of the insurgent natives, she can not
give us possession. What she is asked to
concede ls her title —ln other words, the
right of conquest without Spanish interfer
ence. We demand the right to subjugate un
molested a people who have for years fought
for their freedom and independence, and who
declare, through their leaders, their purpose
to continue the struggle. If the cession were
granted we should secure by treaty another
war, not of freedom, but of subjugation. We
offer to pay $20,000,000 to a beaten foe for this
worthless title to islands which it will cost
us $100,000,000 to conquer and $30,000,000 a year
to govern. This stipulation would endanger
the ratification of the treaty.—New York
World (.Dem.).
* • •
If the American people are to be com
pelled to buy and pay for something which
they don't want, it Is at least reasonable
to let them know just what they are buying.
There is no reason to suppose that the pub
lic works at Manila, lloilo and perhaps a
few other points on the islands are worth
anything like $20,300,000; and if it is not
these works that we arc buying, what is it?
The actual assets which Spain will turn
over to the United States for these $20,000,000
consist in an archipelago over which Spain
herself is only nominally sovereign, with a
population which Col. Higglnson describes as
"8.000,000 of the most unmanageable beings
on the face of the earth," and with the
privilege of subduing the people and making
ourselves masters of the country If we care
to spend the money and sacrifice the lives
necessary to reach this end. To pay this
$20,000,000 purchase money, American indus
try must submit to a continuance of the war
taxes; American labor, threatened by the in
corporation of millions of cheap hand-workers
into our population, must sweat under new
burdens. Is the bargain worth it?— Boston
Post (Ind. Dem.).
The President's Message.
Leaven It to Coiigrei»ei nnd God.
Pity the president had not said more or
written less in his message to congress!
True to his habit of throwing down the
reins, the president in this inspiring moment
of our history has nothing to suggest, takes
no initiative, strikes the keynote of no new
policy. He merely collates a dreary report
presenting numerous facts, and leaves the
rest to congress and to God. There are some
facts, however, which he does not give.
In the seven thousand words devoted to a
history of the war one searches in vain for
any expression of sympathy or regret for the
gallant soldiers left to suffer, and "many, alas!
to die of starvation and fever in hospital
and camp through official indifference or In
competence. On this subject, which so deep
ly moves the heart of the people, nothing is
said. There is no such word In the message
as Alger or "Algerism."—New York Herald.
Urumteaur Effort nt News Condensa
tion.
But instead of taking deep moral and
mental soundings in order to determine the
state of the Union, Mr. McKinley has chosen
the simpler and more brain-saving method
of reproducing some six columns of war his
tory, dating back to the local experiments
at Cuban autonomy. It is such matter as any
handy newspaper man might have easily
clipped Rnd iKiiled down from the Globe's
files.
Just six lines of good, square United States
English from Mr. McKinley on the subject
of imperialism would have been better ap
preciated by the American people than the
whole six columns of his war diary. But,
alas, not one word ls vouchsafed on a theme
which trenches upon the very foundation
principles of our national structure and
antecedents.
His effort is barely more than a condensa
tion of the department reports. .And what
is all the more remarkable is that, save
in a very few minor matters, not a single
suggestion or recommendation appears that
has not already shown up In the department
reports. It is difficult to get hold of any
thing In such a message. The president does
not even indulge in negations. From be
ginning to end it seems much like an
amateur effort at news condensation.—Boston
Globe.
Dlngleyism nn«l ImiicriaitNiii.
Those who have been awaiting President
McKinley's message to congress for informa
tion of an authoritative character as to
the purpose of the administration with re
gard to the Philippines will get little satis
faction from an examination of that docu
ment. That archipelago receives no mention
outside of the paragraphs devoted to ihe
account of Dewey's great naval victory and
the subsequent occupation by our army.
Outside the war, the mes-age has not
many salient points. The recommendation
of Immediate attention to the matter of
currency reform is somewhat surprising, when
we consider the demoralized condition of the
majority party in congress on this question.
So, too, is the announcement that we must
establish closely reciprocal trade with Cuba,
followed r.s it Is by recommendations look
ing to free trade with other countries. The
incompatibility of Dlngleyism with imperial
ism is beginning to appear.--Boston Post.
Disii ppoSntmenl—'li -n Idlty.
In declining to "discuss at this time the
government or the future of the new pos
sessions which will come to us as the result
of the war with Spain." President McKinley
renounces that leadership of public opinion
which our E'cat presidents have cherished
as the noblest of their privileges. "Such dis
cussions," says the president, "will be ap
propriate after the treaty of peace shall be
ratified." No. That will be too late. They
are appropriate now, in order that the peo
ple may form and express their opinions be
fore the senate takes up the consideration
of the treaty.
We think the American people expect, d a
full and frank expression of the president's
policy upon the most important of all the
questions he had to treat ln his annual mes
sage. They will be disappointed that he
has put them off. We shall be disappointed
if his ill-judged silence does not augment
the opposition to colonial expansion which
has already manifested Itself among the con
servative men of the nation.
We are quite at a loss to Interpret the
president's silence unless it proceeds from
sheer timidity and unreadiness of mind.
The newspapers, the clergy, the politicians
and the people are discussing this Philip
pine question. They all think it is appro
priate now. The president's position is not
only weak, but ridiculous.—New York Times.
Here, There, Everywhere.
We may be wrong, but we are under '.he
impression that the Imperialist organs that
undertake to shut up our friend, the Star-
Spangled Scotchman, by their favorite weapon
of abuse will very soon be calling for some
one to help let go of the job. Mr. Carnegie's
way of dealing with the subject has a touch
of the spirit with which one James G. Blame
over eight years ago called public attention
to the fact that a ej;rta+a tariff bill then
pending would not aid the United States in
the sale abroad of "a single barrel of flour or
pound of pork."—Pittsburg Dispatch.

Does any one who has familiarized himself
with the political career of Mr. McKinley have
expectation that he will push currency re
form? It may be granted that as to protec
tion Mr. McKinley has shown neither varia
bleness nor shadow of turning. This is not
his record on the currency. He pretends
currency reform. He is flrst of all a poli
tician. He is a trimmer. In his whole po
litical career as to the currency he has been
especially a trimmer.—Chicago Chronicle.

The latest Dewey story has to do with a
question put to the victpr of Manila bay by
Gen. Merritt. Said the latter:
"Admiral, how far, ln your opinion, does
your Jurisdiction extend on this island?"
Admiral Dewey took two short turns ou the
quarterdeck of the Olympia before answering.
Then he responded:
"General, my Jurisdiction extends from as
close to shore as I can move these flat irons,"
pointing to the American fleet, "to as far into
the island as I can throw a shell."—Boston

Bank ClearlaKM I.ardent Knows,
Swelled by heavy speculative transactions
at New York, large settlements on account
of former business and undeniably good trade
throughout most sections of the country,
November bank clearings, a3 foreshadowed
by earlier weekly reports to Uivdstreet's, ag
gregate the largest monthly total on record,
amounting, as they do, to $6,452,960,396—9.4
per cent larger than those of October, 8
per otnt in excess of January, IS9B, the heav
iest previous total, 20 per cent larger thn
in November one year ago, 41 per oent in
excess of those of November, 1890; 55 per cent
larger than in 1894, and 18.4 per cent heavier
than in the corresponding month of the
"boom" year of 1592. It is not entirely for
their large volume that the clearings report
ed this month are altogether notable. Swelled
by the heavy aggregate for November, the
total clearings for the eleven months' perl,;d
amount to $01,351.970,356—19.8 per cent larger
than those of the corresponding peri :d of

--000,000 smaller than the total clearings for the

previous yearly total on record, has furnished
a landmark or guide by which to reckon gains

TOPEKA, Kas., Dec. 10.—The trial
of John Collins, charged with the mur
der of his father, \\ hlch is one of the
most important as well as the most
sensational criminal actions ever heard
ln this state, has culminated, from a
dramatic standpoint, with the appear
ance on the stand of Miss Frances Bab
cock. For two years John Collins has
been in love with Miss Babcock and,
although she denied it on the witness
stand, it is current gossip hi Lawrence
that the couple was engaged and the
wedding day fixed when J. S. Collins,
father of the accused, was murdered
last May. So firmly convinced is Miss
Babcock that John Collins killed his
father that she and her widowed moth
er refused to have anything to do with
him.
When Miss Babcock entered the
coui t room and commenced telling how
John Cuilins had predicted his father's
death tears filled the accused's eyes
and simultaneously scores of women,
who had surged and crowded Into the
court room, began sobbing, and whis
pers were heard, "How cruel."
Collins caught the first glimpse of
Miss Babcock as she walked into the
court room, and his eyes followed her
till she ascended the witness stand.
When she began telling of telegrams
ar.d letters received the day of the
murder admonishing her to "tell noth
ing," he looked at the floor and was
unable to again look her ln the face.
She told how Collins had predicted the
murder of his father by some secret
enemy; how he had gone to Topeka t»
buy a glycerin bomb for a friend at
Topeka; he had dropped a loaded
revolve * t: om his pocket while out rid
ing with her a few days In-fore tho
murder; how she had reproached him
for carrying weapons, and how he baa
Impressed upon her that tiie weapon
would be needed for an important oc
casion. These were things he cautioned
her against telling in his telegram on
the morning of the tragedy.

Miss Babcock's testimony was the
most damaging given during the sen
sational trial. John Collins wrote her
that his love for her was the main
spring of all his actions. He had beg
ged her to marry him. She had put
him off, saying she would first go to
the seashore, and then if she did not
find a young Easterner she liked better
she would come home and marry him.
It. was shown by Miss Babcock that
John knew that his father's wealth
had dwindled to a point where he had
to enjoin the strictest economy on aH
members of the family; that he had
frequently remonstrated with John
about his extravagance; that he had
talked about dropping his life insui
ance, $6,000 of which was payable to
John, because he was unable to me«i
the premiums. And yet John planned
to spend the summer at the seashore.
Miss Babcock plainly showed in her
evidence that she no longer cared for
Collins, and this attitude assumed on
the stand not only caused Collins to

Below is given a form of protest against United States sovereignty over the
Philippines which is in circulation in Massachusetts and other Eastern states.
Readers of The Globe who may wish to sign it can cut this slip out, sign

To the President and the Congress of the United States:
The undersigned citizens of
PROTEST AGAINST ANY EXTENSION OF THE' SOVEREIGNTY OF*'THE ' TOTTED
STATES OVER THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS in any event, and over any other foreign
territory without the free consent of the people thereof, believing such action would be
dangerous to the Republic, wasteful of its resource,, in violation of constitutional prin
ciples, and fraught with moral and physical evils to our people.
Xame- Address.
break down in tears, but many To
peka women of the highest social cir
cles were prostrated with grief at what
they considered heartless and cruel ev
idence. Such scenes were never before
witnessed in a court room in Kansas.
Mrs. Babcock, mother of the young
society leader, also believes that John
Collins ls guilty of the crime of mur
dering his father.
More startling than all is the state
ment that mother and daughter, hope
he will be convicted because they are
in mortal fear of him. Miss Babcock
knows the Intensity of the love he bears
for her, and she believes It has unset
tled his mind. She believes that if
he ls acquitted and she still refuses to
see him he will do something terrible
to her. She thinks he would kill her
rather than see her marry another.
Several audible hisses were heard in
the court room when Miss Babcock was
testifying, but Judge Hazen quickly
silenced the enraged women by declar
ing that he would clear the room If
such conduct was repeated. People
from the country came into the city by
6 o'clock in the morning to get seats
or standing room for the day's pro
ceedings.
STATE'S CASE CLOSED.
Miss Babcock was the last important
witness for the prosecution, and the
state closed its case at noon today.
The defense will introduce its first evi
dence next Monday, and the case will
consume all the week. It will be claim
ed by the defense that J. S. Collins took
his own life because of financial trou
bles, which would soon have given him
great concern, and that rather than
face them he preferred to commit sui
cide.
James S. Collins, a prominent citizen
of Topeka, was mysteriously murdered
in his own home at 5 o'clock on th<^
morning of May 13, 1898. He died al
most Instantly from the effects of two
gunshot wounds, as he slept in his bed
at home. On June 9, 1898, John Henry
Collins, his son, was arrested, charged
with the crime of patricide.
The subsequent developments of the
murder, climaxing in the arrest of John
Collins, were followed with intense in
terest.
The state endeavored to show that
Collins employed Johnson Jordan and
Jesse Harper, notorious negro toughs,
to kill his father; that they failed to
carry out their contract and that he
committed the deed himself. It is
claimed that Collins wanted his father's
life insurance.
Both Jordan and Harper have confess
ed that Collins hired them to slaj his
father, and Collins' watch was found
in the possession of Harper's sweet
heart. Harper says the watch was
part of the price. A number of let
ters purporting to come from Collins
were found in Jordon's possession. They
were unsigned and had to do with the
plans for the murder.

NEW YORK, Dec. 10.-The Eventa.
Financier says: The statement of the
New York clearing: house banks ter
the week ending Dec. 10 indicates an
s^^iT. of, *4M0'm '* loans and
$7,2G2,2(K) in deposits. The Increase in
liabilities, however, as shown in the
latter item, makes but little change in
the total of the bank resema th!
increase amounting to aboul one-third
Of $1,000,000. It is evident ,hat loans
nave gone to swell banking credits
and incidentally, deposits, the gain iii
cash partly making up for the dis
crepancy between the two. The net
increase in cash, in fact, very nearly
supplied the added reserve require
ment, and the statement is favorable
irom a banking standpoint, in that
use has been found for all the money
week Came int° the lnstitutiun ***
As an exemplification of the theory
of banking operations outlined by the
secretary of the treasury, In his an
nual report, last week, the current ex
hibit of the banks is peculiarly to the
point. In detail, the statement pre
sents nothing that throws light on tho
current situation. Tbe expansion in
loans can be traced to three or four
of the larger banks, and grains in de
posits have been limited tor the most
part to about the same number. It is
evident that the loan increase has
been due to sterling investments and
collateral buying;, although there is a
steady absorption of commercial pa
per.
The actual position of the banks with
respect to cash changes Is at vai
with estimates based on the
operations. Currency from the Inl
is moving this way. as Is natural al
tins season. The amount will be in
creased largely as the banking period
approaches. On the other hand, the
banks are losing to the tieasury about
as much as they gain. The net me
, if $1,610,900 In cash this week,
therefore, was not expected. The
a .ining ability of the banks to extend
their operations in proportion to the
excess cash received is an argument
against lower rates, even if it does not
show firmness. The movement of rates
is a matter of interest. The movement
of gold from Europans points is de
pendent on fractional exchange quota
tions. For this matter, it Is impossi
ble to judge the future of the money
market, l'he only inference ls that
rates cannot be higher for more than
a very brief period, since such a move
ment Avould almost immediately de
feat itself through gold imports.
