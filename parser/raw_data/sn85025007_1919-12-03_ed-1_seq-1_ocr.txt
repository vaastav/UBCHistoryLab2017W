The affair was a most enjoyable

S^hafe, president of the class was
toastmaster of the evening and pre
sided with grace and dignity. The
festive board was decorated -with
Chrysanthemums, which together with
American flage lent color, while the

and 'beauty to the scene. The ban

M. P. Pitts, the firtft to address the
assembly spoke of .the life of the
founder of the class. Mr. J. R. N. Cur
tain, emphasizing the wonderful in
fluence of a good .man in a communi
ty; telling how amidst the busy c^res
cvf life he found time to serve in pub
lic affairs, when the call came to him;
was always unfailing in his church
affiliations, and a companion to the
boys of his class; closing 'with <thc
tribute'ktha.t though this founder be
dead he still liveth in the hearts of
those who loved him.
Clarence Winston gave a brief his
tory of the Class showing its growth
frcm five original members to its
present AttaiimiVent of nearly two hun
dred. S. W. Pitts also spoke in^his
usual happy style who was followed
by Mr. Rippey, field worker' for the
Y'. ,M. C. Am who spoke in the inr
terfcst of that organization arid paifl
a .high tribute to the influence of tire
Baraca Class upon other young men,
who were -inspired by them to or
ganizes! milar classes;
I The officers of the class were called
I uporrto speak and each in turn' prov?d
himself a a addition to the evening's
I entertainment, as well as a credit to
i the organization.
Carl L. Budwesky, one of the premi
[ nent members of .the bar of our city
I; spoke on "Good ?!tizenship'\Hi? .said
I in part: ? . , ? ' j
?"That the constitution of our-re
public has defined who v shall be citi
zens of these United States. The Con
stitution of our various States point's
out t?nes rights and S})rivil?$s. Thera
is a'_movement on foot, in this.das?
'to have the members take an active, in
terest in public affairs, and we hope
to arouse them to this end."
The members of this organization
have a larger .percentage of voters
than any other organiation in the
city. They' have .a tw;o-Md duty t"
preform; first through their represen
tatives to -help lay-out paths through
which we should w'atk, and also *?
obey the laws after they ai<e made.

in public affairs and takes ijo part
in the welfare, of home, locality an I
nation is a drone in the hive, ar.d

thf light to those who are not so we]]
jnformocK
Those who do not take advantage
of their opportunity to qualify before
Monday next will fail in their duty to
as much interest tnemselves in the?
proper making of the law, as in the
obedience of the* law. There are .those
whose main object as a citizen is to
eritize and condemn those in authority.
d8es nothin'g to upbuild and lends
nothing to the builder, such a one is a
destructive rather than a constructive
Citizen, alwavs directing attention' to
the beam in the others eye. No man,
| by condemning another makes that
man better, nor helps himself. A good
citizen will become fnformed, secure
right council, take an active interest
in placing men in authority who have
the fear of God and the "welfare of
man in their hearts. And 4his is a
duty of this class, individually and
collectively.
The Misses Howard charmingly en
tertained the guests with songs and
Miss Bowman beautifully rendered a
piano solo. The Rev. Mr. Wayts of
Del Ray spoke congratulating the !
class on their growth and strength
and enlivened the 6ccassibn with wit
and humor. A feature of the evening
was the presentation to the class of
a picture of their founder by the re
tiring president J. Sidney Mankin.
After an address by ?he pastor. Dr.
E. B. Jackson, the evefiing closed w:th
a benediction by the teacher, N. L.
Williamson.

Health Officer Foulks Says
y It Has No Food
Value
NAMES SUBSTITUTES
\
henorts Improvement, in Water and
Says Precautions no Longer Neces
sary When Used for Drinking'.
t
I have recently noticed largo- ad- '
| vertisements in some of our daily :
J papers, exploiting Saccharin as a 1
substitute for sugar. It is various
ly stated as being from MOO to ">00
times sweeter than sugar, as well as
very low in price.
This indeed, sounds very alhiring
?ynd would seem to be a very simple
solution to the problem of sugar
scarcity. Rut like all other get
sweet quick schemes, there is a very
weak point in t.
Let us stop for a moment and look
into this matter a little. Just wjiat
is "Saccharin?" It is a coal tar
product that . has for many years
past been used by physicans in cer
tain diseases where sugar is not
tolerated. According to our best
authorities, it has absolutely no
food vaue whatever. Many -states
prohibits its use by manufacture to
sweeten any form of food or drink.
The United States Deaprt-ment of
Agriculture, through the Bureau of
Chemistry, brands "Saccharin" as a
Harmful substance, and when used
in food or drink, as a menace to
health.
Sugar has actual food value in \v
self, and is required in one form or
another by the Iriman organism.
During the scarcity of sugar,
syrup or molasses can be used as a
substitute, with no loss of food
value. % .
I feel' if is m\ duty t-> warn our
citizens and call their attention to
this matter so they will knew the
truth and not be tempted to use a
harmful substance as a - substitute
for a necessary food.
1 am pleased to lie able to, state
that the quality~of our city water
has so greatly improved durir.r the
past month, that I no longer con
sider it necessary to take any spec
ial precautions when using it for
drinking purposes. This isNindeed
verv gratifying and 1 trust fhe
present good condition will long
continue.
As we make daily tests of the
water in our laboratory, we arc at
all times in a position to know just ;
what jts quality may be. It is a j
duty incumbent upon the Depart- |
ment of Health, to keep careful j
watch over the quality of water I
being served to our citizen-;, nnd we I
are tryir.ir to perform that dutv I

XAMPAIGN IX FULL SWING i
Baptists Receive Encouraging Reports
From 75 Million Campaign ?*
(S|Kcial to The Gazette)
quarters in Richmond show that the
DoVer Middle s District, Petersburg.
Portsmouth, Roanoke and Strasburg
Associations have gone beyond their
apportionments with a number ? of
chuifhesVyet to be counted. The Ac
comac, James River, New River and
Piedmont Associations have not lu-sr
heaj'd from, while a number of the
largest associations such' as the Po
tomac and Rappahannock only report
for a few of the churches. The total
amount pledged to date and officially
reported is five million four hundred
and ninety thousand one hundred and
sixty two dollars. Smithfield appor
tioned eighteen thousand has raised
twenty four thousand; Orange with
apportionment of thirteen thousand
has reported twenty thousand. It i-<
expected that the -reports Wednes
day will greatly s\Vel 1 the figures
given as that is the date given in thc
instructions for official reports.
Some the largest churches in Rich
mond and Roanoke are yet struggling
with the apportionments with promises
of going over the top. VA systematic
canvass is'going on in those churches.
A report from NashvlHe headquarter?
shows th U' New Mexico. Maryland,
Mississippi. Georgia And South Caro
lina have already gone beyond their
apportionn "ts, and the director gen
eral states that -far more than two
thirds of the seventy five millions
sought from the whole south havr
been subscribed by one third of the or
ganized -h urchps.
Prospects .bright for overwhelming
victory provided the workers do ml
step short.
Campaign headquarters sent ou-t
urgent appeal to association and
church organizers to press the battle
until every individual b:.--been can
vassed and every church taken over
the top. ArrangemOnts will be mark
to give'churches needing special help
next Sunday the best available taleivt
in Virginia. The managers are hear
ing from nvirviplaces :-<king that
workers be sent to winct up tno
pledges.

Appeals For Legislation to

URGES TAX REVISION
Treaty and Railroads^ Will be Dis
cussed at Later Dates. It is Sup
posed.
President Wilson in his message to
Congress yesterday renewed with all
his strength his appeal for a legisla
tive program to restore a peace-time
business status, revise the tax svstem
curl) unrest, reduce the cost ot* lving
and rectify labor and farming ^rfiuli
tions. ^ ?
The message dealt almost solely'
with the pressing domestic problems
confronting _the Government and the
nation.. Only passing reference was
made to the failure of the Senate tc\
ratify the treaty of peace with Ger
many. lie attributed much of the rest
lessness now rampant throughout the
country ro the disheartening delays
in arriving at peace and referred to
the League of Nations in his referen
ces to improving the condition of la
bor. Further than that he did not go
in any discussion j.?f peace issues.
Presumably this great question is
being reserved until another time, as
is tilfe question of returning the rail

Alexandria County, the.jnost densely

Reports / from the Baptist seven*vy- .
frt'e million campaign in the South
aret very encouraging hut the work
will be pressed vigorously during
the entire week. The latest report
is that two thirds of the entire
amount has been subscribed by one
third of the % organized churches.
Many of the churches in Virginia
have far exceeded their quota and
some have more than doubled the
amount asked for. The "sixty-two
churches of the Potomac Association
are gradually reporting and it is
believed here that all of them will
wgo hver the top." some by a very
wide margin. The Baptists of Alex
andria are naturally elated over the
splendid progress already made b'ut
only partial reports are at hand, and
the canvassers are still at work.
It is expected that many Baptists
living in this city, unaffiliated with
the local churches, will participate.
Interesting reports will be ghen out
at the' meeting tonight held in the
