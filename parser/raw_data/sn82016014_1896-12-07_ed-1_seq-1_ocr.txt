Shall Not Act at Present.
The first act in the Pama Fe receiv
ership case has been concluded. At P
o'clock t his morning- J mitre Foster
handed down a decision, concurred in
by Judev Thayt-i remar.ding the case
from the f..,J. ral court to the distri. t

in which it is stimulated that no inter
ference will be offered on the part of
the district court of Jeffers-.n county,
or the r;'Civer appointed by that court,
in the operation of The road until til11
rase is finally decided. This means
That .Judge Myers will withhold all
further action urtil the case is tried
arul decided before him. Should lie
decide that the alien land law was
valid and applied to the Santa Fe rail
way, the attorneys for the railway
company wili immediately appeal to
the supreme court of the state, and
this action will take all further pro
ceedings in the case out of the power
of the district court. No interference,
thereto e. will be offered in the opera
tior. of the road until the case is liaally
decided, even though it go as far as
the supreme court of th United State s.
The decision, of Judges Foster and
Thayer is haie d as a victory by Messrs.
Keeier and Hire. This feeling is partialis-
du- to the fact that the argu
ments on the other side were conduct
ed by some of the best legal tal-nt in
the west, among others the heads of
the legal departments of the Santa F
and Southern V.iifornia roads. "The
decision is undoubtedly a complete
victory," said Judge Ke-ler relay, "aod
siuipiiii. s tie rase to a treat -xt-nt. It
is a defeat to the railway company be
cause it could not wrest the ease from
the ( lute h-s of tne state court, as w as

The Santa Fe attorneys do ion take
at all the same view of the decision as
Judge Ko'dor. "We do not regard it
ns a defeat at all." said Judge ih.ri.on
this morning. "The case will now tr-
to trial on its merits. We were never
afraid of the law. What we were
afraid of was interference on the part
of the revive':-. The asre orient en
tered into by both s'des does away with
all anxiety on this score."
Tiie lenal department of the Santa
Fe has already tiled defenses to ail
points of law involved in the- ease .and
also a general denial that the 2i p. r
cent of the stock of the company is
held by aliens. The points of law in
volved in tiie case will be heard by
Judge Myers on Friday. It is expect
ed that a decision w ill be rea le d in
the cii-triet court the first of next vfk
at the lat-st. and if arpc.il'il to the
supreme court of state, the case will
come up for trial in January. The
Santa i-'e attorneys do ret anticipate
that the case will sro farther than the
state snpr. me court until a decision fa
vorable to the company is rendered.
1 bovver, the ra-p will be carried to
the l"i it -d States supreme court if ne

this case. 1 miaht say it is almost alarm

are not now conci rning ourselves.
The attorney general, with a fairness
commendable in an officer presenting to
tiie court a case of such importance to
the state, and to the rights of individ
uals and corporations, has set forth in
fuil in the amendments to the petition,
all the material facts touching this proceeding-.
In addition to the averments
necessary to bring" the case within the
provisions of the act of the legislature
that more than per centum of the
stock of the defendant is owned and
li 13 by non-resident aliens, etc.. he has
set forth and cited the act of conrrress of
March .!. Mt). granting lands to the
state of Kansas in trust for the Atchi
son. Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad
company, and imposing- certain duties
i and ooligations upon the railroad eom
I puny to the general government in the
j transportation of troops and property of
i the Fnite.l States, from which is quoted
! tne fcllowing paras-raph:
j "That said lands hereby granted to

i p.isa! of the legislature thereof for the
i purposes aforesaid., and no other: and
tne said railroads and branches shall be
and remain public highways for the use
of the government id' the b'nitod States,
free from toll or other (charges upon the
transportation of any property or
troops of the fnited States."
Tiie plaintiff further sets forth the ac
ceptance of these lands by the state in
tiust, and the acceptance of the pro
visions of the act. and its obligations,
by the railroad company .
It further alleges that the defendant
corporation, whose property is sought
to be forfeited in this proceeding.' is
part of a great system of railroads, for
merly owned and operated by the Atch
son. Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad com
pany, and now owned by the defendant
corporation, extending into and through
tin states of Kansas. Missouri, Iowa.
Ilhnois, Colorado, and the territories of
New Mexico and Oklahoma, said corpo
ration being engaged in interstate com
merce, in the transportation of the mails
of the L'nited States, and as a postal
and military route under various acts
of congress.
The plaintiff further proceeds to show
by apt averments that by virtue of cer
tain legal proceedings in this court, the
present defendant company has 'suc
ceeded to ail the rights, privileges and
immunities era ti ted to, and to all the
duties and obligations imposed upon its
pr -dc-esso!- in the possession and opera
tion of its railroad, and thereupon pravs
the court to grant judgment of forfeit
ure, or such relief under the act of the
l-trislature as the rights of ail partus
will warrant.
The case is removed by the defendant
to this court on tiie ground that it is a
civii action arising under the constitu
tion, lav s and treaties of the Fnited
States. This leads us to a brief exami
nation of tiie act of congress of March
as amended in lss, concerning
the jurisdiction of federal courts, the
rieht of removal of causes to such
courts, and of some of the decisions of
the courts touching these questions.
it is well known to the legal profes
sion that reel nt decisions of the su
preme court cd' the Fnited States have
laid down this rule:
"Tiie circuit court of the Fnited States
has no jurisdiction, either original or by
removal, from a state court, of a suit
as one "arising under the constitution,
laves or treaties of the Fnited States!
unless that appears by the plaintiff's
statement of ins own claim."

Washington. Fee. 7. President Cleve
land sent his last regular annual mes
sage to congress when it opened today.
The president says:
To Congress of the l'nited States:
As representative of the people in the
legislative branch of their government
you have asembled at a time when the
strength and excellence of our free in
stitutions and the fitness of our citizens
to enjoy popular rule have been again
made manifest. A political contest involving-
momentous consequences
fraught with feverish apprehension and
creating ag.gessi veness so intense as to
approach bitterness and passion, has
been wageci throughout our land and
determined by the decree of free and in
dependent suffrage, without disturbance
of our tranquility or the least sign of
weakness in our national structure.
When we consider these incidents and
contemplate the peaceful obedience and
m,tnly submission which have succeed
ed a heated ciash of political opinions
we discover abundant evidence of a de
termination on the part of our country
men to abide by every verdict of the
popular will and to be controlled at all
times by an abiding faith in the agen
cies established for the direction of the
affairs of their government. Thus our
people exhibit a patriotic disposition
which entitles them to demand of those
who undertake to make and execute
their laws such faithful and unselfish
service in their behalf as can only be
prompted by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which the ac
ceptance of public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional re
quirement, I herein submit to the con
gress certain information concerning:
national affairs, with the suggestion of
such legislation as in my judgment is
necessary and expedient. To secure
brevity and avoid tiresome narration. I
shall omit many details concerning
matters within federal Control, which
though by no means unimportant are
more profitably discused in departmen
tal reports. I shall also further curtail
this communication by omitting a min
ute recital of many minor incidents con
nected with our foreign relations which
have heretofore found a place in execu
tive messages, but are now contained in
a report of the secretary of state which
is herewith submitted.
TURKISH ATROCITIES.
The Armenian Question Has
the
Same Hideous Aspect
At the outset of a reference to the
more important matters, affecting our
relations with foreign powers, it would
afford me satisfaction if 1 could assure
the congress that the disturbed condi
tion in Asiatic Turkey had during" the
joist year assumed a less hideous and
Idoody aspect and that either as a con
sequence of the awakening cd' the Turk
ish government to the demands of hu
mane civilization or as the result of de
cisive action on the part of the great
nations having the right by treaty to
interfere for the protection of those ex
posed to the rage of mere bigotry and
crti.-l fanaticism, the shocking features
of the situation had been mitigated.
Instead, however, of welcoming a
softened disposition or protective inter
v. ntion. we have been alllieted by con
tinued and not infrequent reports of the
wanton destruction of homes and the
boo.y butchery of men. women and
children, made martyrs to their profes
sion of Christian faith. While none of
our citizens in Turkey have thus far
bo-n killed or wounded, though often in
the midst of dreadful scenes of danger,
their safety in the future is by no
means assured. Our government at
home and our minister at Constantino
ple have- left nothing undone to protect
our missionaries in Ottoman territory,
who constitute nearly all the individ
uals residing there who have a right to
claim our protection on the score of
America n citizenship.
Our efforts in this direction will not
be r-laxed but the deep feeling and
sympathy that have been aroused
among- our people ought not to so far
blind their vision and judgment as to
lead them to demand impossible things.
The outbreaks of blind fury which led
to murder and pillage in Turkey occur
suddenly and without notice, unci an at
tempt on our part to force such a hos
tile pros -nee there as might be effective
for prevention or protection would not
only be resisted by the ottoman gov-
rnm nt. but would be regarded as an
i nt erruption of their plans by the great.
Harems who ass-rt their exclusive right
to intervene in their own time and
method for the security of life and
property in Turkey.
Several naval vessels are stationed in
the Mediterranean as a measure of cau
tion and to furnish all people relief and
refuge in case of emergency. We have
made claims against the Turkish gov
irnment f..r the pillage and destruction
of missionary property at Harpoot and
Marash during uprisings a t I hose places.
Thus far the validity of these demands
has not been admitted though our min
ister althe.ngh prior to such outrages
an.l in nt ici pa t ion of danger, protec
tion was demandeid f r the persons and
property of our missionary citi.ens in
the localities mentioned, and notwith
standing that strong evidence exists of
atttial complicity by Turkish soldiers
in the work of d struction and robbery.
The facts as they now appear do rot
permit us to doubt the justice of these
claims, and nothing will be omitted to
bring about their prompt settlement. A
number of Armenian refugees having:
arrived at our ports an order has late
ly been obtained from the Turkish gov
ernment permitting the wives and chil
dren of such refugees to join them
there. It is hoped that hereafter no
obstacle will be interposed to prevent
the escape of all those who seek to
avoid the perils which threaten them
in Turkish dominions.
Our recently appointed consul to
Krzeroum is at his post and discharg
ing the duties of his office .though for
some unaccountable reason his formal
exequatur from the Sultan has not
been issued. I do not believe that
the present somber prospect in Tur
key will be long permitted to offend
the sight of Christendom. It so mars
the humane and enlightened civiliza
tion that belongs to the close of the
nineteenth century that it seems hard
ly possible that the earnest demand of
good people throughout the Christian
world for its corrective treatment will
remain unanswered.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
The Situation Hasn't Changed Since
His Last Annual Message.
The insurrection in Cuba still contin
ues with all its perplexities. It is diffi
cult to see that any progress has thus
far been made toward the pacification
of the island or that the situation of
affairs as depicted in my last annual
message has in the least improved. If
Spain still holds Havana and tile sea
ports and all considerable towns, the
insurgents still roam at will over at
least two-thirds of the inland country.
If the .determination of Spain to put
down the insurrection seems but to
strengthen with the lapse of time and
is evidenced by her unhesitating devo
tion of largely increased military and
naval forces to the task, there is much
reason to believe that the insurgents
have gained in point of numbers and
character and resources, and are none
the less inflexible in their resolve not
to succumb without practically secur
ing the great projects for which they
took up arms. If Spain has not yet
established her authority, neither have
the insurgents yet made good their title
to be regarded as an independent state.
Indeed, as the contest goes on, the pre
tense that civil government exists on
the island, except so far as Spain is
able to maintain it. has been practi
cally abandoned. Spain does keep on
foot such a government, more or less
imperfectly, in the large towns and
their immediate suburbs. F.ut. that
exception being made, the entire coun
try is either given over to anarchy or
is "subject to the military occupation of
one or the other party.
It is reported, indeed, on reliable au
thority, that at the demand of the commander-in-chief
of the insurgent army,
the putative government has now given
up all attempt to exercise its functions,
leaving that government confessedly
(what there is the best reason for sup
posing it always to have been in fact)
a government merely on paper.
Were the Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open or in
pitched battle .prompt and decisive re
sults might be looked for and the im
mense superiority of the Spanish forces
in numbers, discipline and equipment
could hardly fail to tell greatly to their
advantage. But they are called upon
to face a foe that shuns general en
gagements, that can choose and does
choose its own ground, that from the
nature of the country is visible or in
visible at pleasure and that rights only
from ambuscade and when all the ad
vantages of position and numbers are
on its side. In a country where ail
that is indispesable to life in the -eay
of food, clothing and shelter is so aily
obtainable, especially by those born and
bred on the soil, it is obvious that there
is hardly a limit to the time during
which hostilities of this sort may be
prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases
of protracted civil strife, the passions
of the combatants grow more and more
inflamed and excesses on both sides be
come more frequent and more deplor
able. They are also participated in by
bands of maurauders. who, now in the
the name of one party and now in the
name of the other as may best suit the
occasion, harry the country at will and
plunder its wretched inhabitants for
their own advantage. Such a condi
tion of things would inevitably entail
immense destruction of property even
if it were the poiicy of both parties
to prevent it as far as practicable. But
while such seemed to be the original
policy of the Spanish government it has
now "apparently abandoned it. and is
acting upon the same theory as the
insurgents, namely that the exigencies
of the conquest require the wholesale
annihilation of property, that it may
not prove of use and advantage to the
enemy.
It is to the same end that in pursu
ance of general orders. Spanish garri
sons are now being withdrawn from
plantations and the rural population re
quired to concentrate itself in the towns.
The sure result would seem to be that
the industrial value of the island is fast
diminishing and that unless there is a
speedy and radical change in existing
conditions, it will soon disappear alto
gether. That value consists very large
ly of course, in its capacity to produce
sugars, a capacity already much reduc
ed bv the interruption to tillage, which
lias taken place during the last two
years. It is reliably asserted that should
these interruptions continue during the
current year, and practically extend,
as is now threatened, to the entire sugar
producing territory of the island, so
much time and so much money will be
required to restore the land to its nor
mal productiveness that it is extremely
doubtful if capital can be even induced
to make the attempt.
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an
adjoining country, by nature one of the
most fertile and charming on the globe
would engage the serious attention of
the 'government and people of the Fni
ted States under any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have a concern with
it which is by no means of a wholly sen
timental or philanthropic character. It
lies so near to us as to be hardly sepa
rated from our territory.
AMKKICAN INTERESTS IN CFBA.
Our actual pecuniary interest in it is
second only to that of the people and
government of Spain. It is reasonably
estimated that at least from MO.OCHi.oOO
to SeO.cnu.OiH) of American capital are in
vested in plantations and in railroad
mining and other business enterprises
on the island. The volume of trade be
tween the l'nited States and Cuba which
in isv9 amounted to about lp34.Oim.iViO rose
in 1SU3 u about ?10:i.00a,0(:ii and in 1M4,
the year before the present insurrection
broke out. amounted to nearly $:nhe"0.oaO.
Resides this la rare pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, the Fnited States
finds itself inextricably involved in the
present contest in other ways vexatious
and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country
and indirectly promote the insurrection
through the press by public me-uir.gs,
by the purchase and shipment of arms,
by the raising of funds and by other
means which the spirit of our institu
tions and the tenor of our laws do not
permit to be made the subject of trim-

3Ir.Turner of Georgia to He the
Democratic Leader.
Washington, Dec. 7. The reassem
bling of congress today for the closing
session of the Fifty-fourth congress
was an occasion of unusual brilliancy
and interest. The opening day is al
ways a gala affair, marking: as it does
the official inauguration of the social
as well as the political season in Wash
ington, but today it was ay the more
interesting because of the long and
hard fought political battle that had
been waged during the recess.
The weather was perfectly clear and
fairly warm. The throngs who stream
ed up the hill to witness the opening
ceremonies formed an unorganized civic
pageant. (Jay equipages with a. rat
tle of chains drawn by prancing steeds
conveyed the diplomats, the fashiona
bles and the more prominent in official
life.
The official turnouts moved side by
side with one-horse ramshackied cabs
and other nondescript two wheelers
conveying- legislators and visitors. The
unnumbered thousands moved up Penn
sylvania avenue on foot or in street
cars.
The corridors and galleries were soon
thronged. there were demonstrations for
conspicuously prominent statesmen and
at last came the drop of the gavel and
the regular ceremonies attending the
opening of the session and the reception
of the president's annual communica
tion to congress.
THE HOUSE.
The Usual Buzz, Flowers and Familiar
Scenes of Opening Day.
Washington, Dec. 7. The house pre
sented an animated scene for an hour
before Speaker Reed appeared. The
galleries, to w hich the public were ad
mitted without cards, were crowded to
the doors before 11 o'clock, while the
halls were jammed with those unable
to gain entrance. The reserved gal
leries filled more slowly, but before 12
o'clock were brightened with the hand
some gowns of women. From the floor
below rose the indescribable buzz of
many voices as the members exchanged
greetings. with much handshaking
after the manner of college chums
meeting again after the long vacation.
Pages were scurrying about carry
ing to the seats of members ilowers
and iloral pieces from constituents or
admiring friends. Among the mem
bers thus honored were Messrs. Turner
of Ceorgia, Howard of Alabama.
Fletcher of Minnesota. Bromwell of
Ohio. Gibson of Tennessee. Bailey of
Texas, Lorimer of Illinois. Lacey of
Iowa. Loud of California, Livingston of
Georgia. Belknap of Illinois and Bur
ton of hio.
A black pall covered the conspicuous
desk of the late ex-Speaker Crisp, the
Democratic leader. On it were some
cut flowers. His portrait in the lobby
in the rear of the house was also
wreathed with calla lilies.
On the desk of Mercer of Nebraska,

roses, across which was written in
large letters: "Secretary," while on
that of Mr. Babcock of Wisconsin,
chairman of the committee, was a min
iature chair of roses and soft mosses.
There were many conspicuous person
ages both on the floor and in the .gal
lery. M. Paternotre, the French ambassa
dor, and several other diplomats with
their families were in the diplomatic
gallerv. It was notable, perhaps sig
nificant, that all the Ohio members
were the centers of little groups of
members. There were no demonstra
tions of any character. As the hands
of the clock pointed to 12. Speaker
Feed quietly entered the hall and as
cended the rostrum. He was attired
in a blade frock coat and looked
bronzed and vigorous.
The silver mace, the emblem of the
authority of the house was lifted to its
place on the green malachite pedestal
to the right of the rostrum and with a
sharp crack of the gavel, the speaker
called the house to order. The hum of
conversation instantly ceased and the
galleries became quiet. Rev. Cowder of
Michigan., the blind chaplain of the
house offered the invocation.
J. William Stokes then was sworn in
as a member from the seventh congres
sional district of South Carolina.
The credentials of Charles A. Boatner
from the Fifth district of Louisiana,
were read also. Both of these gentle
men received certificates of election to
this congress but their seats were con
tested and declared vacant by the
house at the last session. They were
then re-elec ted. The usual formal reso
lution for the appointment of a com
mittee to join a similar committee of
the senate to inform the president that
the house was ready to proceed to busi
ness and. another directing the clerk to
inform the senate that the house was
prepared to proceed were adopted. The
speaker appointed Mr. Cannon of Illi
nois. Mr. Payne of New York, and Mr.
Turnr of Georgia to constitute the
committee.
The selec tion of Mr. Turner was con
sidered a significant indication that the
Georgia member would succeed ex
Speaker Crisp as a member of the com
mittee on rules, as it was a formal rec
ognition of him as the leader on the
Democratic side. In order to await the
president's message, the house on mo
tion of Mr. Henderson of Iowa, took a
recess until 1:3d.
THE SENATE.
Senators Keet for an Hour's Session
and Then Adjourn.
Washington. T). C Dec. 7. The senate
chamber was a center of interest long
before the hour for assembling had ar
rived and bv 11 o'clock the public galler
ies were well tilled and crowds were at
the entrance ii iabh' to gain admittance.
Fir Juiian Pair.afo'e accompanied by
Mr. Bois of his staff and several mem
bers of the diplomatic corps were in the
gallery reserved for foreian representa
tives and with them were several ladies
bearing cards from Secretary Oiney.
ln the seats reserved for the vice presi
dent'?? family and friends, sat Mrs. Stev
enson and several ladies. Back of thern
in the seats reserved for the families of
senators were many of the wives anil
daughters of those prominent on the
floor. Tire gallery crowds found ease and
comfort in the new theater seats put in
since the last session closed although it
resulted in reducing the seating capacity
almost one-half. Tiie senators were rath
er late in arriving. Mr. Palmer. Demo
crat of Illinois, came about ll:3u and wa
a center of interest from the galleries,
owing to his prominence in the recent
campaign.
Mr. Tillman. Democrat. South Caro
lina, also came in for considerable atten
tion as he went to his desk and busied
himself with writing.
There was plenty of color to ereet the
senators, for the door of the chamber
looked like a conservatory with many
of the desks bearing superb floral decor
ations. The senate officials were quick to
note that the tributes stood "M to 1." six
teen being on the Republican side and
one on the Democratic side, although this
proportion was broken as many Demo
cratic tributes were brought in just as
the session opened. One for Mr. Walt
hall. Democrat. M ississippi, showed a
graceful floral crescent bearing the word
"Mississippi." Other offerings were to
Messrs Cullom, Allison. Proctor. Mantle
and Thurston and to Messrs Vest. Smith,
Blackburn, Pasco. Morgan and Voorhees.
The latter received a superb tribute of
pink and yellow roses.
The chaplain referred feelingly to the ill
ness of Mr. Allison and besought his
speedy restoral ion to health.
The roll call showed To senators present.
Mr. Cullom was the tirst to receive recog
nition and his resolution that the house
of representatives be notified that the
senate was in session and ready to pro
ceed with business was agreed to with
out comment. Mr. Hale followed with a
resolution that the daily hour for meeting
be 12 o'clock meridian, which was agreed
to.
Mr. Sherman made the customary mo
tion for a committee of senators and
members to wait upon the president and
upon its adoption the presiding officer
named Mr. Sherman and Mr. Smith
(Dem. N. J.,) as the senators of the com
mittee. Mr. Morrill. (Re.. Vt.t was the
first to suggest anything in the nature
of legislative business by presenting
petitions asking for the passage of the
l'.ingley bili. He yielded, however, to Mr.
Hoar's suggestion that all business lie
deferred as a matter of courtesy until
the president and house of representa
tives had been communicated with and
thereupon at 12:1") p. m., the senate took
a recess until 1 p. m.
Senate assembled at 1:30 p. m. Most
of the senators remined in their seats
while the reading of the president's
message proceeded and followed it with
much interest throughout its stage.
The Turkish minister Moustapha Bey,
accompanied by his secretary. Norighf
Enfendi and an attache entered the
gallery shortly before the clerk read
the president's words as to prospective
action to stop Turkish indignities which
shocked the civil world. They left the
gallery immediately after this portion
of the message was read.
DEATH UNWARNED.
Special Containing B. & O. Officials
Collida With Another Passenger
Train.
Cincinnati, Dec. 7. A disastrous wreck
occurred about 8 o'clock this morning
about three-quarters of a mile west of
Storrs station on the B. & O. S. W. rail
way in which two persons were killed
and a number of others injured. The
trains collided were No. 2, an accommo
dation coming in from Cochran, Ind.,
and a special made up of a passenger
coach and two private cars.
The special was carrying all the gen
eral officers of the B. & 0. S. W. who
were starting out to make a thorough
inspection of the road. The engineer
and conductor of the special had orders
to follow- 15 minutes behind a preceding
regular train and to keep out of the
way of train No. 22, which had the right
of way. The special stopped at Storrs
where it should have waited for No. 22,
but the engineer and conductor both
forgot the order concerning the train
and pulled out.
When three-quarters of a mile west of
Storrs the trains came together. There
was a fog which prevented seeing clear
ly so neither engineer suspected a col
lision until the shock came. Engineer
John Price and Fireman Homer Dixon
of the special were instantly killed.
General Traffic Manager George F.
Randolph was severely injured, collar
bone biciken; General Passenger Agent
J. M. Chessbrough was thrown through

brain. He was taken to the Grand ho
tel. None of the other injured are sup

TAKEN OUT AND I1UNO
By a Mob of One Hundred an I
Fifty Farmers.
Mob Batters in the Doors of i ha
Jail.
Lexngton, Mo., Dec. 7. At about 1
o'clock this morning a mob of Ray
county farmers broke into the county
jail here and secured Jesse Winner and
James Nelson, held for the murder or:
Mrs. Winner and her' two babies, an.t
lynched them.
The jail was not heavily guarded as
no warning had been sent by the au
thorities at Richmond to prepare for a.
mob. The mob was composed of Fe)
men. all unmasked. They were a very
orderly set of men, but clearly showed
that they meant business. So qui
tiy
did the lynchers approach the jail
tllM T
no one connected with it Knew now tne
mob crossed the river upon the bacics
of which the institution stood. Tie y
overpowered Jailer James Goode with
out any ado and demanded the keys r o
the cells of Nelson and Winner, tloociei
had hidden them and when th mot.
said to him "there is a way to make you
give them up," the jailer coolly re plied,
"you can't make a .lead man give tiic-tu
up. so shoot me if you want to."
The leaders said they were prepared
with plenty of tools to effect anentraaue
and displayed a quantity of dynamite,
sledges and chisels. Notwithstanding
Jailer Goode remained stubborn and the
mob went about to gain their end in an
other way. The other prisoners were
told not to make any break for their
liberty as they would be se erely dealt
with if they did. Then the doors were
battered down and the prisoners tied
and led out. One of the mob acted an
captain, directing the lynchers not to
shoot, as long as the jailer "behaved"
as they expressed it.
The demolition of the doors pr
but the work of a few minutes. Win

murderers, who cowed and slun!

begging piteously for mercy . None was
shown and the two men were led out
ir.i'o the open. Winnei, the husband
and father, came out trembling ith
fear and looked the lecture of distress.
Nelson stood up better than Winner
under the strain but said not a word.
As he had passed his cell inner toid
one of the other prisoners th.rt lie n..-s
guilty. The captain, w hen the river had
been reacheti, was asked where ho was
going to hang the culprits am! re .IFd
that they were going to Pay county,

crossed at about 2 o'clock and the men
were eoickly dispatchoii.
