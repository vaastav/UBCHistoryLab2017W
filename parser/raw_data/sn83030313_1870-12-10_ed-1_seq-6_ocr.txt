A Note About a Railroad Accident. ?
The Cincinnati Chronicle thinks the tenor of
Signor Brignoli's present life runs largely
towards damage suits against railroads, lie
has just recovered over seven thousand dol
lars for injuries received in an accident near
Loganaport, Ind. But ha has not yet got the
money ? only the judgment. Some *>f these
Western railroads make very fast runs, bnt
the scale of their payments for injuries "is
rather more moderato than crescendo.
?"ue Government has Biiddenly become
very vigilant in regard to Cuban violations of
the neutrality laws. What occasion* this freak
of virtue at this moment is unknown, unless it
may be the sailing of the steamer Ilornet on
Thursday for Nassau and a market. At any
rate, in addition to the arrest of General Jor
dan some days ago, we bare now to chronicle
the arrest of SeAor Ruez, the Minister of the
provisional government of free Cuba. If Cuba
should ever become a free and independent
little nation she is u#t likely to entertain any
very cordial sentiments toward* our glorious
and freedom-k'vinir republic.
Oil PftrtlM Hi PaMle Mn-Tk* Political
Hcrtaaa.
Taking the result of tho lata elections, the
political bearing of the President's Message
and the position of parties at the comm ence
ment of the present session of Congress as a
standpoint for looking at the prospect around
us, we may form some idea of the future. The
political situation was never more tame, flat
and devoid of excitement In this country.
Never was there such a lack of strong public
men, of leading and powerful minds, either to
arouse popular fervor on questions already up
or to create new stirring issues. It Is the same
with one party as with the other. The demo
crats aud republicans alike are without strong
loaders or popular issues.
A:i President Grant is the head and repre
sentative of the dominant republican party
and must bo the candidate of that party in
1872, his Message may be regarded as a sort
ot" platform on which the republicans will
stand. True, some new issues may be raised
between the present time and 1872, either
through the course of coming events or by the
party in Congress. But we Bee none at pre
sent. Well, what are the republicans going to
make the contest upon ? The Message of the
President to Congress is a highly respectable
State document, remarkably conservative and
peaceful, but tame and negative. The
negro Is used up as a political hobby.
The war issues have been exhausted.
Both the odium and the expected
beneflts of reconstructing the South have been
used nearly as far as they could bo by both
parties. Reconstruction is virtually finished,
and little more can be made out of it. The
negroes as well as the white people of the
South will henceforth range themselves with
political parties on questions affecting their
material interests. As to financial questions,
neither party has a comprehensive, well
defined policy. The rapid payment of the
debt, whioh Mr. Boutwell endeavors to make
so much of, through the burdensome taxes
wrung from the people, oannot make much
political capital for either the Secretary of the
Treasury personally or the administration.
And as to revenue measures, the republi
cans are divided according to the interests of
the sections of country they represent. It
is the same, in a measure, with the democrats,
though they are more united thaa the republi
cans on such measures.
On questions of foreigu policy or our r ela
tions with foreign countries neither the admin
istration party nor the opposition has any policy
to awaken the popuUr mind. The Alabama
claims, the fishery question and the navigation
of the St. Lawrence, which the President has
discussed pretty fully in his Message, might
bring up a popular issue ; but we rather think
General Grant will not force one, and that the
British government is so intent on maintaining
peace with this country that these matters will
be smoothed over or remain in a quiescent
state. The President's mind seems full of the
St. Domingo annexation scheme, for it is
dwelt on at great length in the Message ; but
there is not enough in that to make any political
capital. Indeed, the suspicion is generally
entertained that there is a job in the scheme,
and that the President, though not a party to
it, is misled by those having his confidence.
The annexation idea is always a popular one
with the American people, but in the case of
St. Domingo they say cui bono f or, what is to
come out of It ? The island is naturally very
rich, as most tropical countries are; but if
there be not the population, or you cannot get
the population there to develop this natural
richness, where is the value? The St. Do
mingo question cannot be made a popular oue.
: It is different with Cuba. That island has not
only as much natural wealth as St. Domingo,
or more, but has all the developed wealth ot a
prosperous country? most valuable and largo
productions, a large population, extensive
commerce, railroads, telegraphs, great cities,
splendid ports, and all the elements of a pro
gressive and civilized country, besides being
almost within gunshot of the United States.
Then there is the popular sympathy of the
American people with thalr neighbors strug
gling to shake off the yoke of European des
potism and to establish republican institutions. |
This would be a popular question for the re
sident and his party; but he chooses to ign oro
Cuba and the Cubans.
Neither one party nor the other has any
striking policy on the questions referred to,
and both are drifting along lazily on the slug
gish stream of used-up political questions.
Sometimes the want of stirring issues is com
pensated for in a measure by the towering
position and influence of great party states
men or leaders. A sort of hero worship may
sometimes serve party purpose?. Look at the
influence General Jackson and Henry Clay had
over the people. Such men can inspire en
thusiasm in the masses. But at present the
country has no such leaders. We are without
great men as well as great measures. The
most prominent figure among the group of our
leading public men is General Grant. His
glorious war record gave him that position and
made him President. Though be makes
a respectable and safe President, he does not
show as much ability in politics and states
manship as in the command of armies. He
fails to initiate a policy that would touch
the popular heart. Yet he stands like a
Goliath above the other prominent men and
Presidential aspirants of the republican party.
There are Colfax, Sumner, Boutwell, Butler
and others who aspire to be leaders and states
men, and who have their eyes fixed on the
White House ; but is there one of them that
merits this distinction ? Colfax is simply a
local, smooth politician, whose strength lies in
a fluent tongue. There is nothing great abont
him. Sumner is a man of one idea and a
theorist ? a mere rhetorician, and baa neither
the grasp of mind for a statesman nor the
qualities for the chief and leader of a party.
Boutwell is a respectable country lawyer and
local politician, who became a finance minister
by accident, who has had nothing to do but to
haul in the enormous revenue imposed by
Congress upon the people, and who has shown
no remarkable ability either in the Treasury or
in the House of Representatives. Butler has
more talent and vigor than any of them, but
ho is reckless, unscrupulous in political affairs,
and would l>e unreliable, if not dangerous, at
thy helm of Btate, So we might go on to
analyze the character and pretensions of other
so-called leiders of the renublican uartv. and
we should find none equal to the political
necessities of the time.
Nov, then, with regard to the opposition or
democratic party, what great measures or
great men do we find ia that ? Looking over
the whole field we see the withering blight of
the dead past ? bo fresh issues or new life ?
nothing to arouse public senthaent. There
has appeared to be lately, and particularly In
the late -elections, some returning life to this
once rigorous and powerful party, but its
comparative successes arise from a negative
and not a positive cause. The dissatisfaction
with the republican party and its growing
unpopularity helped the democrats, and not any
positive popularity ot their own. They have
not presented any policy or issue to stir the
popular ueart, and seoin to have none to offer.
Nor have they any towering leaders to arouse
the enthusiasm of the people or to organize
and consolidate the party. Governor Hoff
man, who will be, probably, the Presidential
candidate of Tammany, and who is already
nominated in different parts of the country, is
a safe, prudent, conservative and very respect
able man. For negative virtues, if we may
call thom so, no maa could bo more unex
ceptionable. But what is there in the
character, history or reputation of the Gov
ernor to arouse popular sentiment? Outside
of New York who knows anything about him?
His public career has been confined to this
State, and though he has made a good Gov
ernor, the people of other States or sections
know little concerning him. Pendleton, of
Ohio, is a brilliant man, but out of the ques
tion. His antecedents and political and
financial theories make him objectioaable to a
large number of the people. Hendricks, of
Indiana, has had a good deal of experience In
Congress and has proved a solid and safe public
servant, but there is nothing in him to awaken
the enthusiasm of the people. So on to the
end of the list of democratic leaders. With
sterility in policy and mediocrity in its leading
men what can the democratic party do?
General Grant, then, is the foremost man, and
the republicaas have the best chance with him
of holdiag power. But if by chance the
democrats should gain the next Presidential
election it will be throtfgh the mistakes and
unpopularity of the republicans, and not from
any positive morits of their own. What the
country really wants are live issues and strong
public men.
The Military Situation la Fraaee.
It were easy to reconcile the repart of
King William of the enormous losses sus
tained by the French near Orleans with the
statement from Tours that the Army of the
Loire has again started on an advance move
ment, if we accept the reports emanating from
French sources respecting the strength of that
army. Certainly any force comprising three
hundred thousand men may lose forty thousand
and yet continue on tho offensive if Its mcrale
remains unimpaired. Our war despatches
this morning are 6omewhat puzzling,
although they by no means contra
dict each other. King William confirms
the report published yesterday that sevanty
seven pieces of artillery, ten thousand
prisoners and four gunboats were taken by
the Prussians near Orleans. It is evideot
that this success, great as it is, was not
achieved without heavy loss to the victors.
The Duke of Mecklenburg telegraphs that the
Mecklenburgers alone lost thirty-two hundred
of their nnmber, and as tbey could not have
comprised more than a comparatively small
part of the German army we may saf?ly con
clude that the victory was dearly bought.
As regards the despatches from Tours, we
hesitate to place credence in them. Why Mon
targis, which is situated northeast of Orleans,
should be evacuated by the Germans, when it
forms so important a part of their communi
cating line with Paris, we are at a loss to con
jecture. Assuredly, while they remain in Or
leans they will hardly uncover the road that
leads directly to Fontainebleau. It must not
be imagined that the evacuation o T Montargis
would enable the French to get between Prince
Frederick Charles and the investing army be
fore Paris; for it would not. It would,
however, leave the road open to Fon
tainebleau and Ghampigny; hence we are
disinclined to credit the report in the
absence of any intimation that the Germans
are executing strategic movements and design
edly uncovered the place. In like manner the
statement that De Paladines' army is agaiu
advancing cannot be implicitly relied upon.
We think it true, however, as the despatches
state, that the army has been divided into
three corps. Such a division, if it be really
great in numbers, will result advantageously,
as it will enable the French to move upon
Paris in three parallel columns, and conse
quently increase their chances of success.
From Paris we have intelligence of the
reception by Trochu of Von Moltke's informa
tion of the defeat of De Paladines, coupled
with the offer of a safe conduct to a
committee of French officers to verify the
report. Trochu declined the offer, asserting
defiantly that if even the statement were true
France would continue the contest. Of course,
the reports from Paris concerning the military
situation are all favorable for the French.
Nor is it quite possible for us to deny
their truth. Whatever exaggerations may
be contained in all the French despatches it is
worthy of note that neither from Orleans nor
from Versailles have we received any news
which wonld indicate that the Army of the
Loire has been too badly beaten for imme
diate offensive operations or that Ducrot's
forces do not hold the line surrounding the
peninsula formed by the Maine, the possession
of which was the cause of the battle of the 2d.
Bven the otherwise full account of this battle,
which we publish this morning, fails to satisfy
us on this point Champigny, we are told, is
held partly by the French and partly by the
Germans. This is a very vague statement. It
seems to leave the French Btill on the left bank
of the Marne, but there is nothing certain upon
which to base a conclusion. In fact, it is certain
that nntil we get clearer accounts of the mili
tary situation than we have yet received it
will be impossible to arrive at any definite
oonclusion.

Mpeclal Advices frM Wilhelmskohe? -.Napa
leoa'a Hope* and Kemaiobraacoa.
By an ample telegram dated at Wilhelmshohe
oo the 5th last., and forwarded through the
Atlantic cable, we have a very important
special report from the castle prison of Bona
parte. The intelligence which it conveys ap
pears in our columns. It is quite interesting
and rather Important. The exiled dynast re
mains in that condition which the First Napo
leon termed, according to an English account,
the "gloom of his glory." He experiences the
sad realities of the present, seeks consolation
in his recollections of the past and is hopeful
of the future. Visitors of note come and go
with daily iucreasing frequency to and from
the castle. It is alleged, indeed, that the
chances of Napoleon's restoration to supreme
power la France are steadily improving. In
the meantime his Majesty is about to come
out with a pamphlet. We must Bay that, in
our opinion, this pamphleteer war system Is
unworthy of the great occasion, out of place in
an age of mitrailleuses, needle-guns and Chas
sepots. Under cover of an official authorship
Napoleon has a new book, however. Our
special correspondent telegraphs soma extracts
from the work. The sentences speak of the
past entirely ? of 1856 and 1866. They are
interesting, but tend to no result which is
likely to be useful to the royal cause. Indeed,
if they show any one point very distinctly it is
that Bonaparte was for years before his fall out
generalled in diplomacy by Prussia, particularly
by Bismarck, and that too without being aware
of the fact. England aided in this direction
by a sort of side wind, or secret counterblast,
the tortuous whirls of which were not, as is
evident on his own showing, understood by
the French Emperor. The issue of works
such as the one just now referred to by
Napoleon goes to prove that his mind, like
that of his great uncle, as it was described by
the English poet, is "extreme in all things" ?
"one moment of the mightiest ; and again on
little objects with like firmness fixed." y
Nt. Ilomlnao? Heaator Banner Preparing
far Battle.
Mr. Sumner has issued a formal dcelaration
of war against the President on the St. Do
mingo annexation question. General Grant
in bis annual Message has made this annexa
tion scheme a leading measure of his adminis
tration, and in support of it he has furnished
an argument whioh we considered overwhelm
ingly conclusive. Mr. Sumner, however, hav
ing an account to settle with the President in
reference to the reoall of Minister Motley from
England, meets the Message with a resolution
which is brimful of mischief. He calls for all
the correspondence and papers relating to this
project of annexation, all instructions to our
diplomatic agents, and all protocols on the
subject, and for all Dominican debts and
liabilities, all the provisions of the Dominican
constitution on the subject of selling the
national domain, all treaties tying up Domin
ica, ail communications on this annexation .
scheme from Hayti, all instructions to our
naval squadrons on the subject, and all
reports from our naval commanders con
cerned ; and also for any information tending
to show what European Power, if any, pro
poses to acquire jurisdiction of any part of
the island, and, if bo, what part ; and also the
poBitien of President Baez, the negotiator of
the treaty of annexation, and how far be has
been maintained in power by United States
vessels-of-war, and so on to the end of his
numerous requisitions.
Here Mr. Sumner's lino of attack upon this
Dominican scheme is pretty plainly indicated.
He intends to do his best to show that the pro
posed annexation is what they would call in
our police courts "a put-up job" between
President Grant and President Baez, of
Dominica ; that Baez, against the will of the
Dominican people, has been kept in power by
the United States Navy ; that the republic of
Dominica is overwhelmed in debts ; that she
is mixed up with heavy schemes with and
obligations to llayti in this annexation busi
ness ; that no European Power has any notion
of securing jurisdiction over the island or any
part of it, and that upon the port of the Presi
dent and all concerned the whole scheme is
little else than a monstrous scheme of specu
lation in real estate at the expense of the
United States Treasury. We have no doubt
that this exposition against the President is
what Mr. Sumner is driving at ; but will it
serve his purpose ? We think not.
The President, we are sure, will gladly
furnish all the information desired that he
possesses or can obtain, and, with all this and
all else that Mr. Sumner can secure, these
facts will stand out in bold relief, to wit
That the proposed foothold upon the
island of St. Domingo, Bimply as a naval
station, will be te us worth a hundred times
over all that we Bhall have to pay for it ; that
in securing it from the actual existing govern
ment of Dominica we shall secure a title
which will nowhere be disputed ; that the an
nexation of the Dominican republic two-thirds
will speedily be followed by the other third,
Hayti, thus securing us the whole of that
magnificent island of St. Domingo, of twenty
seven thousand square miles ; and that in
view of the seaports, the military position and
amazing fertility of the island in its tropical
products, including sugar and coffee, all these
objections of Mr. Sumner to General Grant's
scheme of annexation are paltry, pitiful and
contemptible. Let Mr. Sumner have his infor
mation and let us Bee what he can do with it
against these great facts and against the Presi
dent and the general public sentiment of the
country.
Success of the New Indian Poliot. ?
Western papers arc expressing their convic
tions that the new Indian policy inaugurated
by General Grant is no longer a doubt
ful experiment; that the honest manner
in which the Quaker agency system
is carried out is confirmed by the
docility of warlike tribes and the saving of a
million dollars to the national treasury. This
is a very good report for friend Broadbrioi.
Let him keep on in the same line, summer and
winter.
The Smalt.pox is alarming the good people

Ceegreee Trtirhy,
la the Senate yesterday Mr. Casseriy, of
California, effered a resolution of inquiry aa to
when and where federal troops have been used
to preserve the peace at State elections and for
other purposes designated in the new Congres
sional election law. This is the opening gnn
of a whole battery that is likely to be turned
against the law, which is so obnoxious to the
democracy, bnt which certainly cut down the
business of repeating to a very unprofitable
standard in this city last month. The de
mocracy do themselves great injury by oppos
ing it. It certainly secures a- fair
and just election, and no one can oppose It
who is willing that fair and just elections
should be held. Mr. Spencer, of Alabama,
has taken up the idea of General Logan, and
has presented in the Senate the proposition for
the abrogation of the offices of admiral and
vice admiral. As the nomination of Porter to
be admiral has just been presented In the
Senate, and was reported upon favorably yes
terday, the matter assumes more importance
than it doeB in the House. Mr. Drake again
stirred up the old question of rank and pay in
the navy, and succeeded very admirably in
muddling the question of precedence between
the line and staff even more than it has here
tofore been muddled. His bill was referred to
the Committee on Naval Affairs, and remains
yet to be acted upon. Several other matters
of no importance were brought up, and the
Senate, after an executive session, adjourned
until Monday. The House was not in session.
Qaeen Isabella Protest* Against the lloase
of Savoy.
From Geneva Queen Isabella protests
against the Duke of Aosta. Poor Isabella!
It is no use. The Pope, who is in similar trouble,
protests. But the Pope is also under the
necessity of yielding to the House of Savoy.
The House of Savoy, like the House of Hohen
zollern, is now in the zenith of its success.
The one family is being borne in triumph to
the imperial throne of Germany ? a throne
empty since 180G, but which as soon as occu
pied will recall the tradition of the holy
Roman empire. The Hohenzollern on the
throne of Charles V., Barbarossa, Otho the
Great and Charlemagne, will not be a pleasant
subject for the contemplation of the descen
dant of Rudolph of Hapsburg. Scarcely less
pleasant to the House of Austria can be the
spectacle presented by the House of Savoy.
Victor Emmanuel King of United Italy, his
daughter Queen of Portugal, his son King
elect of Spain, bis daughter wife of an ambi
tious Bonaparte, to what family are the Latin
races to look for unity, If not to the House of
Savoy ? A century since Prussia was small
and Sardinia was insignificant ; but to-day Prus
sia is Germany and Sardinia has changed her
name for Itaiy, and gives the hope of unity to
the Latin races. The Bourbons are in the
background, and Isabella is a despised Bour
bon. The fates are strong, but they are not
strong on the side of the exiled Queen. Isabellar
like her betters, must bow to the inevitable.
ftlaakfento from the Cable Companies.
The presidents of the three ocean cable
companies have issued a manifesto, which we
print in another column, announcing an ad
vance of rates on and after Monday next, in
consequence of the immense pressure of busi
ness resulting from the breakage of the two
damaged wires. The rates are declared to be,
for the time being, for a message not exceed
ing ten words, fifteen dollars, in gold, and one
dollar and a half for each additional word.
The press despatches will be transmitted at
half this price. The companies explain that
there is an accumulation of business now at
both ends of the line whieh cannot be got
through in less than two days. The present
advance in price is, of course, only temporary.
Ab soon as the broken cables are put in work
ing order the old rates will be resumed. Bnt
it is alleged that there is serious difficulty in
the way of restoring the cables at this season.
Nothing has been accomplished so far, and i t
may take some time before they are picked up
and repaired. The break," it appears, is only
a short distance from the coast of Newfound
land, and great difficnlty is experienced by
the steamers in operating on the fractnred
lines when the wind blows from any quarter
exoept directly off shore. Indeed, it is stated
that they cannot work at all except when the
wind is in this direction. This fact would
naturally delay the work very much and leave
it a good daal to the chancer of the elements.
We suppose, under these circura3ta nces, that
people will have to submit to the advance. It
may seem rapacious to put the prices of trans
atlantic despatches up so high ; but, as far as
the Herald is conoerned, we have no objec
tion to pay our share of the increased expense.
We are determined that the public shall have
the news in our columns, whatever it costs,
while a slender thread of communication re
mains between America and Europe.
Tim Patal Demonstration in Buffalo. ?
An immense procession of Catholics, German
and Irish, took place in Buffalo yesterday to
testify their approval of the Pope's protest
against the occupation of Rome by Italians.
Twenty-five thousand men were in line, and a
large body of French Catholics were to have
made an addition to tho number, but came to
the conclusion before tiie procession moved
that they would not march with Germans.
Bishop Kyan and other eminent priests deliv
ered impressive speeches to the multitude on
the occasion.
Tns Governorship of Alabama. ? Mr.
Smith, the radical Governor of Alabama, who
has been holding on to his office against the
clearly expressed election of Mr. Lyndsay to
succeed him, has finally consented to resist the
will of the people no longer, and has given up
the office without any further recourse to litiga
tion or aiy appeal whatever to arms. This
Smith, strong radical as he is, recently "went
back" on his colored friends, and denied ever
granting them any favors or ever countenanc
ing them at all. This was while the litigation
was pending, and was evidently intended as
a peace offering to his democratic opponents.
After such a record the verdict in regard to
his overthrow must be "served him right."
Archbishop Spalding delivered a very able

A cable telegram from Lendoa states that
the Patriarch Gregorlns has sammoaed ?
synod of the Greek Ohoroh to assemble Id
Constantinople. The Eastern Churches will,
it is said, be represented by the Patriarchs of
Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Cyprus,
Athens, Belgrade, Bucharest and St. Peters
burg. The Patriaroh Gregorlus is one of
the most learned, liberal, and at the same
time devotedly religious hierarchs ef the day;1
as has been already specially shown in the
pages of the Hbbald. The Church move?
ment which is about to be undertaken with
his sanction will, if carried out to complete,
ness, constitute one of the most important
events in the history of Christianity. The
?ery names of the Sees indicated recall the
memory of the footprints of the Great High
Priest and of the Apostles. These remem
brances will serve to restore religion to its
primitive simplicity and charity and fidth.
They bring light from the East, with consola
tion. The Synod of Constantinople is likely
to meet at a moat critical period of the affairs
of the Old World. The Church may be
enabled to fulfil its heavenly commission? to
carry peace where men seek to seize the
sword of war. In this respect it will oontrast
hopefully with the Ecumenical Council in
Rome ? a meeting which was coincident, to
say the least, with war, bloodshed, dethrone
ment, exile and death.
The Coal Monopoly.
The fact of the annual reduction of miners*
wages by the great coal corporations ef the
country and the consequent strikes of the
operators of the mines, whereby an excuse la
made for raising the price of coal, requires the
suggestion to Congress of a way for preventing
a recurrence of such events in the future. An
alteration in the present Tariff bill which will
take the duty off foreign coal would have the
desired effect ? a t least it would plaee the con
sumers of coal In a more safe condition than
they are at present, as English, Irish, Nova
Scetia and other coal could be brought into
this market and sold at suoh prices as would
keep the great monopolists of the Pennsylvania
coal regions in check, and their extortions
in prices would be consequently less fre
quent. Miners' strikes and consequent Buffer
ings will occur every winter until Congress
takes the matter in hand and abolishes the
duty on foreign coal. But we have little
faith that this desired object ean be brought
about in the face of the great rrealth and influ
ence that the coal monopolists can bring to
bear at the seat of government against so dis
astrous a blight to their schemes. We hope,
however, for a change.
Thirty thousand miners are now out of
employment in Pennsylvania, and the amount
of coal on hand by the various coal corpora
tions is inadequate for the supply of the coming
winter. What will be the result? An idiot
could almost guess. Prices will go up, and
by the 1st of February we would not be sur
prised to see it selling at fifteen dollars for a
short ton. We can imagine the suffering that
will then take place among the poor all over
the country, with coal advanced in price dur
ing the freezing months of January, February
and March. The only hope, then, is, that Con.
gress, by taking off the duty at once, will
upset the calculations of the coal monopolists
and give the consumers coal at a fair price.
The Murder Trials.
Oue murder trial was concluded yesterday
before Judge Bedford, in the Court of General
Sessions, and another ig still pending, both of
which recall horrible murders which, although
committed less than eight months ago, have
almost entirely escaped the public memory.
Both were attended with the most thrilling
adjuncts. George Nelson murdered his wife in
June last, while drunk, and the little daughter of
the murderer and his victim first discovered
the murder when she came into her parents'
room the next morniBg and found her father
Bleeping carelessly oa the lounge and her
mother lying stiff and cold in death on the
bed. This unfortunate little witness convicted
her father yesterday, and he was sent to State
Prison for four years for manslaughter. The
other case is an older one. It is that of
Cooney for the murder of O'Day one bright
Sabbath dawn in April last, when O'Day, a
big bully, had been out all night on a lark and
had been seeking for some one to kill up to the
moment that ho mot the prisoner. Sport, he
called it, and in seeking this sport be let his
lifeblood out on the sanded floor of a bar
room.
A Novel Situation? To seo an American
born citizen becoming a naturalized subject of
Great Britain for the purpose of carrying on
the iron ship building business. Why don't
Congress allow the trausfer of the American
flag to foreign built ships at once, and have no
more nonsense aboutlit? The vary fact of the
United States becoming again a great com
mercial Power would give an impetus to
American industry in our shipyards that would
in time and under proper enouragement and
legislation overcome foreign competition, and
leave the field, or rather the ocean, very
nearly all to oursoives.
Thk Haytikns either fear Yankee absorb*
tion, or are jealous of the good fortune in store
for their Dominican neighbors when the latter
take their place under the American fla$. The
Ilayticn Minister at Washington has prepared
a protest against the acquisition of St. Do
mingo by the United States ; but the grounds
of the protest have not yet been made public.
This movement, however, can have no effect
with the Senate. In "expanding the area of
freedom" our government does not feel called
upon to consult the wishes of parties not
immediately interested in the transaction.
A New Idea fuom Wyoming. ? We have
already learned a great deal from the new
Territory of Wyoming. It was Wyoming
which taught us that woman suffrage could bn
carried into effect very respectably, and that
the women voters could bo trusted to defeat
the women candidates. Now it gives us a
lesson in the jury system. A number of petit
jurors recently, whilo locked iu their room, at
t Rawlins, undertook to vary their deliberations
on the dry case under trial by the more fasci
nating diversion of "seven op." Whether
they intended t? arrive at a verdict by thiH
means, thus degrading territorial law to the
level of "ainf'ul cames." or whether they pro*
