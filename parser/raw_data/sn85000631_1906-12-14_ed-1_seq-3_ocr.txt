PORTO RICAN MESSAGE
I8LAND*3 AFFAIRS 8UBJECT OF
A 8PECIAL COMMUNICATION
FROM PRESIDENT.
COUNTRY IN PROSPEROUS CONDITION
FAVORS FULL CITIZENSHIP FOR
PEOPLE BUT NOT COMPLETE
SELF-GOVERNMENT.
Washington, Dec. 12.—President
Roosevelt has sent a special message
to congress treating exclusively ot
Porto Rican affairs. In opening he
speaks highly of the beauty and fertil
ity of the island, as noted in his recent
visit, and tells of the great progress
made under its present admirable
government. In the matter of educa
tion, he declares, the work of the in
sular government Is particularly note
worthy. After praising the excellent
character of the insular police and ol
the Porto Rican regiment, all of whom
|are natives, he continues:
"In traversing the island even the
most cursory survey leaves the be
'holder struck with the evident rapid
growth In the culture both of the sugar
cane and tobacco. The fruit industry
is also growing. Last year, was the
most prosperous year that the island
[has ever kqown before or since the
I American occupation. The total ol
exports and imports of the island was
$45,000,000 as against $18,000,000 in
1901. This is the largest in the isl
and's history. Prior to the American
occupation the greatest trade for any
one year was that of 1896, when it
reached nearly $23,000,000, Last year,
therefore, there was double the trade
that there was in the most prostt^tflus
year under the Spanish regime. There
were 210,273 tons of sugar exported
last year, of the value of $14,186,319
$3,555,163 tobacco and 28,290,322
pounds of coffee of the value of $3,
481,102. Unfortunately, what used to
be Porto Rico's prime crop—coffee
has not shared this prosperity. It has
never recovered from the disaster ot
the hurricane and, moreover, the ben
efit of throwing open our market to it
has not compensated for the loss in
flicted by the closing of the markets
to it abroad. I call your attention to
the accompanying memorial on this
subject by San Juan board of trade.
"There is a matter to which I wish
to call your especial attention, and
that is the desirability of conferring
full American citizenship upon the
I people of Porto Rico. I most earnestly
hope that this will be done. I can not
see how any harm can possibly result
from it and it seems to me a matter of
right and justice to the people ot
I Porto Rico. They are loyal, they are
glad to be under our flag, they are
making rapid progress along the path
iof orderly liberty. Surely we should
show our appreciation of them, our
irl
pride in what they have done and our I ""J™*!®?
fnr
pleasure extending recognition for
.what has thus been done by granting
them full American citizenship.
Opposes Complete Home Rule.
"Under the wise administration ot
the present governor and council
marked progress has been made in the
difficult matter of granting to the peo-,
ipal governments, the only power over
-them possessed by the insular govern-
ment being that of removing corrupt
or incompetent municipal officials. It
is not a power with which it would be
safe, for the sake of the island Itself,
to dispense at present. The lower
house is absolutely elective, while the
upper house is appointive. This
scheme is working well no injustice
of any kind results from it and great

orderly election. Any protest as to
electoral frahds is settled In the

safe to make any change in the pres
ient system. The elections this year
were absolutely orderly, unaccom

protest has been made against the
management of the elections, although
three contests ar? threatened where
the majorities were very small and

HIS CONDITION SERIOU8.
Biahop McCabe 8tricken With Apo
plexy on the Street.
New York, Dec. 12.—Bishop McCabe
of Philadelphia, of the Methodist Epis
copal church, was stricken with apo
plexy at Twenty-third street and Thir
teenth avenue. He was taken to New
fork hospital.
At the hospital it was said that the
bishop's condition was serious.
Bishop McCabe was walking along
Twenty-third street on the way to the
Pennsylvania railway ferry when he
Was stricken. He turned to a group
of men standing on the corner and
asked them to assist him just as he
fell. The men carried him to a near
by hotel and when it was seen that
his condition was serious a call was
sent for an ambulance. Bishop Mc
Cabe did not lose consciousness at any
time and while waiting for the am
bulance he drew from his pocket a
paper bearing his name and address,
SUCCEEDED IN FIRST ATTEMPT.
Captured Bank Robber Confesses to
Previous Holdup.
Great Bend, Kan., Dec. 12.—Joseph
S. Kearns, the former Chicago dry
goods clerk and newspaper man who
was captured here last Saturday after
robbing a Great Bend bank in broad
daylight, has confessed to having
robbed the Midland National bank at
Newton, Kan., on the afternoon of
Nov. 13, when he locked the clerks
and customers, six in all, in the bank
vault and escaped with $1,800.
Kearns confessed that he sent part
of the money secured in the Newton
robbery to his mother and sisters at
Ann Arbor, Mich. He spent some of
it in living at fashionable hotels in
Chicago and New York and lost sev
eral hundred dollars in a Chicago gam
blinghouse. He probably will be sur
rendered to the Newton officials for
prosecution.
SHIPWRECKED IN MIDLAKE
FORTY PERSONS SPEND THREE
DAYS ON ROCK WITHOUT
FOOD OR SHELTER.
Fort William, Ont., Dec. 12.—After
spending three days and nights on a
rock in the middle of Lake Superior
without food and shelter from the
zevo weather forty-one persons, the
survivors of the steamer Monarch,
reached Port Arthur on the tug Wha
len. One man, James Jakes of Point
Edward, a watchman, was drowned.
Most of the survivors are more or less
•seriously frozen about the hands and
feet, but none of them are in a dan
gerous condition.
The wreck occurred at 9 o'clock
last Thursday night. The compass
was frozen and a heavy sea was run
ning, with the night very dark, when
the Monarch struck the rock. One
hour later the stern was completely
under water. Charles H. Elton, a

r0Ck-
made the
vessel fast to
a tree and the crew came ashore on
The passen-
the line hand over hand
gers followed the crew.
On the rock no shelter could be
found except a wind break, made up
of brush. The survivors were without
food untii Sunday, when a bag qif
flour was washed ashore from'^he
cargo of 1,400 tons ot flour and wheat
may be a total loss. It is doubtful if
the ship itself can be saved.
