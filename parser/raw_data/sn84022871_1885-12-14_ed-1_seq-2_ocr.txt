We give below our Clubbing List which
embraces almost every periodical that
our patrons subscribe for. Should any
desire two or more of the periodicals
named, they can have the advantage of
the low rates. To ascertain the cost of
any particular paper, subtract 1.50

the single periodical.
It is related that after Mr. Hen
dricks bad failed of his election, in
his first candidacy for the vice-presidency,
a Senator, nodding towards
Mr. Wheeler, then in the chair of the
Senate, asked the ex-governor wheth
er he allowed himself to be envious,
he replied: "No, not envy. No
place has any attraction forme where
all the strain comes on the seat of
the trousers." Possibly something
like this occurred to some of the Sen
ators mentioned for the presidency
pro tern. The presidency pro tem
pore, however, is a somewhat more
desirable position than' the vice-presidency,
for it does not deprive a Sen
ator of his right to vote, nor abso
lutely of his right to take part in de
bate, though it greatly interferes
with the latter's privilege since the
presiding officer of the Senate is not
expected to leave the chair in order
to take part in discussions on the
floor, except for some special and ob
vious reason.

General Land Commissioner
Sparks devotes considerable criticism
to the management of the bureau
under his predecessors. Nearly
twenty pages of his report are given
up to the subject of fraudulent land
entries. Mr. Sparks makes it clear
that he has not himself discovered
any frauds by giving up the greater
part of - his twenty-pages -to- quo
tations from reports written by in
spectors previous to" the advent of
the democratic administration. He
urges legislation to make " the home
stead laws more effective, and the
necessity for preserving the forests.

King Kalakaua wants to sell the
United States the Sandwich Islands
for $14,500,000. Kalakaua would
feel safer as a protege of the United
States, governing under a republican
constitution, and the fourteen million
and odd would be ample compensa
tion for that obsolete bauble known
as a crown. It would be a good
bargain for Kalakaua, no doubt, and
perhaps good for this country.
Probably not one person in ten
ever reads a president's message.
But those who read Mr. Cleveland's,
with any care, must realize the fact
that our ship of State is a big con
cern, and that he who stands at the
helru and undertakes to guide its
course and to care wisely for the
multifarious interests concerned, has
no light task upon his hands. The
position of chief magistrate of this
republic, is not an enviable one.
The secretary of the treasury re
cently sent out invitations to a num
ber of the leading manufacturers of
the country to furnish to him their
views. upon tariff revision. The gen
eral tenor of the replies seems to be
against any further reduction of du
ties. The conclusion of one of the
leading thread manufacturing firms
is that "any reduction of the present
rate of duty on linen thread, would
entail the most serious results upon
linen thread manufacturing in the
United Mates, and the same no
doubt is true in some other indus
tries.
The caucuses of both parties were
held on Friday and Saturday, and in
both the proceedings were very har
monious. In the Senate republican
caucus, the first meeting was held on
Friday, when Senator Edmunds nom
inated Senator Logan of Illinois and
he received a unanimous nomination.
Mr. Edmunds in presenting Gen. Lo
gan's name, spoke briefly of the ap
propriateness of such an election in
asmuch as he was the nominee for
the same place in the late presiden
tial election, and came within a few
votes of being elected. Gen. Logan
declined the position on the ground
that it was not according to his taste
to serve in such capacity, preferring
his seat on the floor. The republic
an caucus then .adjourned to next
day, when Senator Sherman was
nominated, receiving all but four
votes for Edmunds. The caucus fur
ther considered and favored the pres
entation at once of a bill for the pres
idential succession and also one for
the counting of the electoral vote.
The democratic Senatorial caucus
nominated Senator Harris of Tennes
see, who is a popular man and will
be likely to be frequently called to
the chair by Senator Sherman.
The republican House caucus nom
inated Hon. Thomas B. Reed of
Maine for speaker, by a vote of 63
to 42 for Hiscox of New York and 3
for Ryan of Kansas. On motion of
Mr. Hiscox the nomination was made
unanimous. The democrats renom
inated Carlisle of Kentucky for
speaker and also John B. Clark of
Missouri for clerk. In the Senate
on Monday Senator Sherman was
elected president of the Senate. A
motion to substitute Mr. Harris fail
ed 24 to 29.
In the House, Speaker Carlisle had
179 votes to 138 for Reed. The
speaker was sworn into office by Hon.
W. D. Kelley of Pa., the oldest mem
ber of the House. An incident in
the House during roll call was that
Mr. Lymes of Colorado refused to
answer to his name till the clerk pro
nounced it according to his idea of
how it should be. Of 325 members
all but five answered to their names.
As the members met m the hall they
exchanged salutations and all were
in good humor. Both houses have
thus promptly organized. The death
of Vice President Hendricks was an
nounced in both Houses and tbey will
take further action on the same hereafter.
Mr. William H. Vanderbilt, the
two hundred millionaire railway king,
died on the . afternoon of Dec. 8th,
very suddenly, at his residence in
Fifth avenue. His end was dramat
ic in the extreme. He was engaged
in a pleasant conversation with Mr.
Robert Garrett, when without warn
ing, he dropped dead at his feet. His
death was caused by apoplexy. Mr.
Vanderbilt's last day was one of the
pleasantest and quietest of his life.
Up to the moment of his death it was
wholly given over to those domestic
pleasures of which he was especially
fond. He rose at 7 o'clock feeling
in excellent spirits. A great load
had been taken off his mind by the
satisfactory settlement of the West
Shore controversy, which he had fol
lowed with sucb close attention that
it weighed upon his mind, and ever
since his return from Buffalo, a month
ago, . he had felt greatly wearied at
night. But on Monday night he was
in a merry mood. He spent the ev
ening at home playing whist, one of
his favorite diversions. He spoke
of his excellent physical health be
fore breakfast, observing that he felt
better than for the last month, and
referring to the satisfaction with
which he regarded the West Shore
settlement. He took breakfast with
his. son-in-law, Mr. Twombly, and
his son George. Having given up
the idea of the drive, he went after
breakfast into the library, where he
read the morning papers until his
confidential secretary, Mr. Rossiter,
came in. Mr. Rossiter came m about
9 a. q. and stayed till 10. When
he went away Mr. Vanderbilt dressed
warmly for the street. At 10 :30 he
went to the studio of J. Q. A. Ward,
the sculptor, at No. 119 West Fifty
second street. Mr. Ward is model
ing a bust of Mr. Vanderbilt in
bronze which is to be given to the
College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Then he returned home. He saw his
son George as he went into the house,
and in answer to an inquiry as to
from; the department re
ports.
The report of the third assistant
postmaster-general for the last fiscal
year shows the estimated total cost
of the postal service to be $8,381,
571, in excess of the gross receipts.
A part of the decrease in postal rev
enues is attributed to the increase of
the unit of weight on sccond-elas3
matter from two to four ounces with
out a change in the rate of postage,
but a more potent factor was the
stagnation of business throughout
the country. The report, however,
states that taking into account the
business depression the results of re
duction of the rate on domestic let
ters are not such as to afford dis
couragement to the advocates of
that measure,

It is not surprising that Gen. Lo
gan should have declined to be shelv
ed in the presidency pro tern of tbe
Senate, during the important and ex
citing debates that are to come. It
would, perhaps, have been well
enough, if, like Senator Edmunds,
he had announced in advance his re
fusal to be a candidate for the place
But he probably considered their
cases not quite parallel. To Mr.
Edmunds, who has been repeatedly
honored by an election to the office,
the compliment of the caucus nomin-
tion could have little value. To Mr.
Logan, the unanimous preference of
liia peers, under the circumstancei, cruisers
lias given soaie uisuucuon, uiougu
lie did not care to accept the honor
thus tendered. With Edmunds and
Logan out of the field, the nomina
tion naturally and properly fell to
Mr. Sherman.

The report of the secretary of war
says the total expenditures of the
fiscal year were $45,850,999, of
which more than $13,000,000 were

The attention of congress is invited
to the defenseless condition of our
sea-coast and lake frontier. The
recognition by the . general govern
ment of the the value of an efficient
ratlitia has infused greater zeal in the
personnel of that force a fact
abundantly sbowa ia the reports of
inspections made by officers of the
permanent establishment at the re
quest of the governors of several
states. The secretary reports that
fifty-three of the one hundred thirty
nine points to which congress direct
ed his attention as subjects of river
and harbor improvements present no
valid grounds for public expenditure.
Legislation is recommended for the
more effectual punishment of at
tempts to possess and occupy lands
set apart for the Indians.

He suggests plans for the

claims that a few exceptions, the
large sums of . -money expended on
how be felt, replied that he was "in
first-class shape. I have enjoyed
the walk down to Ward's very much,"
he added. "It put my blood in cir
culation and freshened me up. It is
an elegant day." At 1 o'clock lun
cheon was announced. The meal
was scarcely finished before the card
of Robert Garrett, the president of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was
handed to Mr. Vanderbilt. He told
the footman to show Mr. Garrett into
the library, . and there in a few
minutes Mr. Vanderbilt joined him.
He drew the portieres and the
two railroad magnates were closeted
together. Robert Garrett is the last
man who saw Mi". Vanderbilt alive.
They talked about railroad affairs.
During the conversation Mr. Vander
bilt appeared to unusual advantage ;
his eyes were clear and bright, his
voice strong, and his articulation
distinct. He talked with a good deal
of vivacity and made a number of
shrewd suggestions. He was seated
in his own arm chair in a careless,
half-reclining position, and his visit
or sat on a sofa opposite. Suddenly
Mr. Garrett observed a hitch in Mr.
Vanderbilt's voice. It seemed to
grow thick and his words came with
difficulty. Mr. Garrett, was alarmed
to see a paipfu twitch in his host's
face. Another and a fainter one
passed, just the slightest spasm. Mr.
Vanderbilt half rose frprn his chair,
paused, . tottered, and then fell for
ward upon his side at the feet of his
astounded guest, with whom but a
moment before he had beeu engaged
in lively conversation. Before Mr.
Garrett could lean over him , and
place his hand upon his heart it had
ceased to beat. Within thirty
seconds of the time when the indis
tinct articulation was noticed he was
dead. A blood vessel in his brain
had broken, the physical catastrophe
known as apoplexy. , . Mr. Garrett's
presence of mind did not desert him.
He raised the dead mau's head and
placed it upon a low ottoman. Then
he pressed the button of an electric
bell. It was exactly twenty minutes
past 2 o'clock when Mr. Vanderbilt
fell to the floor ; twenty minutes lat
er Dr. McLane arrived. . He exam
ined the stricken man, and turning
to those around him, said : "He is
dead! He died as be fejl," . ; Mrs.
Vanderbilt had been told that he had
fainted. It was useless to conceal
the truth from her longer. She re
ceived it with every , token of the
most acute distress.
Mr. Vanderbilt was the son of
Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt,
who died some years ago worth $40,
000,000. . William H., the subject of
this sketch, was G5 years of age.
His estimated wealth is $200,000,000,
and he was pyobably th richest man
in the world. . His Income was said
to be $20 a minute. His funeral was
held on Friday last. His death made
no important changes in railroad
slocks.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The exceeding great length of the mes
sage (30,000 words) makes it impossible
to give it ia a weekly paper of this size.
It is a conservative and able paper, and
is well received by Congress and the coun
try.' Republicans may well be
pleased with it for it embodiss
almost everything that -: the party
is contending lor,' except it may be holi
est suffrage everywhere, and democrats
cannot well go back on it, though it is
opposed to many things that the party
practices, though it dare not publicly en
dorse. ! , , . . s
The principal subjects treated of by the
message are our foreign relations, reduc
tion of the revenue, ' the "Silver coinage,
condition of the navy and coast defences,
treatment of the Indians, and civil ser
vice. The other points discussed are in
structively discussed but are secondary
in importance. ; ,
Our government is at peace with, all
nations, and no difficult questions are
pending. The rejection of our appointee
to the Austrian mission is explained oil
grounds highly creditable to the Presi
dent. The President withholds his ap
proval of the Mcaraguan treaty and gives
strong reasons for it. The whole fishery
question between Great Britain and the
United States is proposed for submission
to an international commission. The
laws relating to citizenship and natural
ization are regarded as inadequate and
recommendations are made. :
On the question of reducing the reve
nues middle ground is taken. The Pres
ident seeks to steer clear of both free
trade and protection and succeeds very
well. He advises any reduction to be
made upon the imported necessaries" of
life. . What those are he does not specifi
cally name. .
The message argues the silver question
at length and forcibly, and the evils of
an enormous silver coinage both present
and prospective, are elearly pointed
out. The President recommends the sus
pension of the silver coinage act of Feb
ruary, 1878.
The Indian question is elaborately dis
cussed, advanced ground taken, and the
appointment of a new Indian Commission
of six persons is recommended.
The weak and shabby condition of our
navy is plainly set forth. A policy for
its reestablishment on an extensive scale
is outlined, indicating that the President
and Mr. Tiiden have counselled together
on the subject.
The message is very pronounced on
the Mormon question, and the views ex
pressed will meet with a warm endorse
ment from the country. The President
boldly recommends that the importation
of Mormons be forbidden.
The President reserves the discussion
of civil service for the close of his mess
age, and the views expressed are all that
can be desired. The President shows no
halting, but falls short of recommending
an extension of the system, although he
does recommend an increase of the sala
ries of the Commissioners.
The closing paragraphs relative to civ
il service are as follows
"The allurements of a number of of
fices and places exhibited to ' the voters
of the land and the promise of their be
stowal in recognition of partisan activi
ty, debauch the suffrage and rob political
action of its thoughtful and deliberative
character. The evil would increase with
the multiplication of offices consequent
upon our extension and the mania for of
fice holding, growing from its indulgence,
would pervade our population so gener
ally that patriotic purpose, the desire for
the public good, and solicitude for the
nation's welfare would be nearly banish
ed from the activity of our party inter-
the ground that he could serve his
constituents, better by remaining on
the floor and that the position was
not to his taste.
The session of the senate to-day
was brief. It merely organized and
then adjourned through respect to
the memory of Mr. Hendricks, whose
chair was heavily draped in black.
President Cleveland's message will
be sent to both branches of congress
during to-moi row's session. -It will
be read in both ends of the capitol
at the same time. The message has
been carefully guarded, and none of
it has been published before the time
intended, though much of its policy
has been indicated in advance. As
you will have read it, probably, be
fore this reaches you, it is useless
for me to forecast its contents. ... .
I will mention, however, that if
congress should not after a reason
able time, approve of the president's
recommendation to suspend the sil
ver coinage, it is probable the treas
ury will suspend it on its own au
thority, holding that the Bland act,
although it provides a permanent
fund to purchase bullion, yet pro
vides no fund for the expense of
coinage.
The annual report of Secretary
Whitney of the navy, will probably
attract more attention than that of
any other cabinet officer. In his
record of the year he treats thorough
ly and exhaustively the question of
reorganizing his department aud
placing it upon a business basis
which will guard it from the noto
rious scandals of the past.
The report of Indian commissioner
Atkins shows that there will be but
little change in the policy of the
government toward the Indian under
a democratic administration. The
red man is to be reclaimed as fast as
possible by the ordinary processes o
civilization, and is to; be made to
work like other people.
Commissioner Colman, the chief
of the farmers, gives a year's agri
cultural results. He tells the needs
and work of his department, what
Jthe various bureaus have done and
what they hope to do.
When congress gets fairly to work
the indications are that it will pass
the Hoar succession bill, which pro
vides for giving the presidential suc
cession to cabinet officers in the line
of their rank. There seems to be no
disposition to treat the matter from
a party stand point.
Senators and members of both
parties think this winter s session
will be one of the most interesting
since the war. It is sure to be a
long one, and will probably not end
before next August.
THE DECAY OF THE HILL TOWNS.
Those who have traveled through the
hill country of New England must often
have been struck by the eight of a white
church, standing almost alone upon a
summit of the great ridge. Once it -was
the meeting place of some flourishing vil
lage, but when the railroads came, mak
1113 their way through the rough forbid
d;ng country by following the watei
courses closely the villagers descended
into the valleys, built up towns along the
great highways of travel and left the old
church to mourn, over its lost glories and
to struggle along weakly until it too had
to succumb to the new order of things.
The clergy who built up these pillars of
orthodoxy were strong and earnest men,
and those who have succeeded them are
not leas so. Their live3 are marked by
self-sacrifice and severe work. Their la
bors are carried on under many difficul
ties and hardships, and it ia not surpris
ing that many suffer from rheumatism
and neuralgia. That many of them have
found a cure, however, for these diseases
may be seen from these letters. Rev.
A. S. Cooper, of Williston, Vt., says :
"Twelve hours' use of Athlophoros
r.reatly removed the pain from my sys
tem and rendered the muscles so supple
that I could get up and down with ease,
which I have not done for a long time.
1 called yesterday on a gentleman who
got a bottle from me and who I expec
ted would send for more through me,
bs.t I found he had got the start of me
and ordered for himself, having been
much benefited by it."
Henry L. Hall, editor of WUlimantia
(Ct.) Journal, who is well and favorably
known for miles around, says :
"Three doses of Athlophoros relieved
me from a very acute attack of inflamma
tory rheumatism in nine hours. I con
sider it an invaluable remedy in rheu
matic affections, and esteem it a pleasure
to recommend Athlophoros."
Mr. J. B. Webster, who is the carpenter
i'-'.r the Willimantic Linen Co., of Wilii
i .untie, Conn., and is well-known and
much respected in that neighborhood, says:
" For three months I suffered with
ir.il.immatory rheumatism, and failed to
receive any relief from any of the nnmer
"k.js remedies for that complaint until I took
Athlophoros, which entirely cured me."
Hev. S. Donaldson, of Lyndon, Vt.,
writes :
"The bottle of Athlophoros helped i:iy
v.ifa greatly. She had up to the time of
Uikii! ? it been a great sufferer from nen
id;ti:i and rheumatic difficulties, making
if almost impossible for her to walk with
uny ease. These difficulties have Km
about her more or less for fourteen years.
Since taking the medicine she has been
comparatively free from pain and is able
to walk better than before for several
years."
Rev. Charles E. Harris, formerly t.i"
?sew Haven, now of Brooklyn, says :
" Athlophoros acted like a charm, and l
have been quite free from any attack of
rheumatism from that time until the prv.'.- -ent.
I can, therefore, with all sincerity
testify to the valuable quality of Athlo
phoros a3 a rheumatic cure."
If vou cannot eet Athlophoros of your drue-
gist, we will send it express paid, on receipt ot

that you buy it from your druggist, but if he

ests and cause them to degenerate Into
selfish and disgraceful struggles for the
possession of office and public place. Civ
il service reform enforced by law came
none too soon to check theproRress of de
moralization. One of its effects, not
enough regarded, is the freedom it brings
to the political action of conservative
men, who, in fear of the confusion at
tending an arbitrary and sudden change
in all the public offices with a change of
party rule, cast their ballots against
such a chance."
The message ends with the following
eloquent passage :
"In conclusion, I commend to the wise
care and thoughtful attention of Congress
the needs, the welfare and the aspirations
of an intelligent and generous nation. To
subordinate these to the narrow advan
tages of partisanship or the accomplish
ment of selfish aims is to violate the peo
ple's trust and betray the people's inter
ests, but an individual sense of responsi

loved land.
Since the improved tone noticed a
week ago on fine grades the market has
been gradually gaining strength, and an
advance of J to 3 cents per pound may be
quoted on fine fresh Western creamery.
As the Northern creameries are all closed,
the Western make takes the lead, and it
may run UP Still higher before the winter
is over. All the fine fall stock is more
or less favorably affected, and will be
wanted at full prices. Summer stock has
not improved to any extent, and the dif
ference between that and fresh made is
very marked. The best Western cream
ery has been selling to the trade at 27
cents, aqd for new arrivals 28 to 29 cents
per pound will probably be obtained.
Special brands which are owned by
houses here are being jobbed out at 3Q to
32 cents. The Elgin market is reported
active at 32 cents per pouud, which would
make the grade here worth 33 or 34 cents,
but our trade has not come up to that
range yet. Second class creamery may
be quoted from 23 to 25 cents per pound,
in round lots, but it is not easy to sell at
over 24 cents. Fine fall dairy will com
mand 23 to 24 cents per pound, in lots,
but there is very little offering. Winter
made dairy is not desirable, and very lit
tie of it is worth 20 cents. Long dairies,
including the summer make, are hard to
sell at 15 to 18 cents. In fact, after pass
ing the fine grades there is very little de
maud, and buyers can make their own
prices on the bulk of the old stock.

The forty-qintl coqgres,3. met to
day noon. Long before that hour,the
streets leading to tbe capitol were
thronged with pedestrians ager to
wiluess the opening scenes. The
spectators' galleries of both. the sen
ate and house were packed an hour
before half of those who wished to
get in had arrived. Every iuch of
space was taken where people could
sit, or stand, or stoop or kneel, while
in . the corridors surrounding the gal
leries, was a writhing, struggling,
disappointed mass of humanity elbow
ing and tiptoeing to catch a glimpse
through the glass doors, of the scenes
on the floor of the senate and house.
The scenes were the old ones, that
are enacted here every two years,
there were over three hundred mem
bers, who pceupied the hour preced
ing noon in handshaking, exchang
ing congratulations and greeting,
and introducing the . new . members.
There were nearly 125 new faces.
The house and senate were called
to order at the same ujomeiit. The
organisation Df each had been set
tled by the caucuses held on Satur
day, and to-day the formality of re
electing the old officers of the house
was quickly accomplished by the
democratic majority. The republicans
honored Mr. Reed of Maiue, with a
complimentary vote for speaker.

and courtesy of the senators.
The comment now is that Senator

George McCluer, who recently died in
New York, was a diamond expert for
Tiffany. He had probably handled more
diamonds thanany other man of the present
day and kuew more about the traffic. He
could also tell who owned the most val
uable diamonds in New York, and proh-.
ably in America, for the Tiffauys did a na
tional business. ?
General Stephen Thomas, on his recent
yisit to Virginia, made tlje acquaintance
of a lady residing near the Winchester
battle-field, who told him that after that
battle seven of his men lay dead in her
dooryard ; that her house was filled with
his wounded men, aud that she held the
heads of several of the wounded when
they died; that she then sympathised
with the cause that was lost, but now re-
ioiced over the final result. She gave the
general and his friends a kindly reception,
and has written the general a letter
since his return home iu which she ex
presses her love for the Union and the
brave men who fought on that side. The
general thinks she (like the other Virgin
ians) is sincere in her expressions of loy

The Adams family, consisting of father,
mother and five children, were accident
ally poisoned recently, at Vinceunes,
Jnd., by taking morphine for quinine.
Mr. J. C. Adams has been afflicted lately
with neuralgic pains in the head and was
taking quinine and morphine. He had
provided a medicine chest in which the
drugs were kept and requested ope of his
daughters, aged 10, to bring some quin
ine capsules, of which they all partook.
Alter retiring, Mr. Adams aud family be
came deathly sick, aud at 4 o'clock the
next morning neighbors heard screaming
and crying from within the house. Upon
investigation it was found that the whole
family were poisoned. The mother, fath
er and a three-year-old girl are danger
ously ill, and it is not believed that Mr.
Adams will recover,
