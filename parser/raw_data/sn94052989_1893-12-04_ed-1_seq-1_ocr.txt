Young, has been satisfactory to me in this
fight and 1 will in no wise interfere with
his plans. lie is amply able to conduct
tbe affairs of the engineers in question."
"Will you seek an audience with Presi
dent Wilber?"
"No. The men who had a right to such
an audience have been refused. I will
certainly not attempt to see him. I will be
in the East for a short time and if be de
sires to see me be will bave to send word
to that effeer."
Arthur refused at this time to further
discuss the strike situation. Young has
left Bethlehem and will meet him here to
night.
The Lchigb Valley officials have issued
a notice. In which they offered a re
ward for the arrest and conviction of
tbe men who cut the freight train at White
haven. The issuance of sucb notice had
the effect of making Chairman Clark very
angry. Ho said the company shonld be
certain the train bad been so cut, before
its officials m de such a grave charge.
Chief Arthur will leave to-morrow morn
ing for Wilkesbarre. from which point the
strike will hereafter ba conducted. Chair

day.

Slightest Ceremony.

SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 4, 1893.
ROUTED THE REDS.
Police Disperse London
Anarchists.
THEIR MEETINGS BROKEN UP.
Some Very Lively Encounters in
Trafalgar Square.
SWEPT THROUGH THE STREETS.
Furious Mobs Finally Make a Rush
for Scotland Yard, but Are
Again Checked.
London, Dec. 3.— Anarchy to-day bade
a defiance to law, while the authorities
made an Imposing display of police. It
was Known for some time that the an
archists intended to bold a meeting in Tra
falgar square. Sir Henry Asquith, Home
Secretary of State, ordered Sir Edward
Bradford, Chief Commissioner of Police,
to prevent the meeting. The anarchists
announced their intention to hold the
meeting in spite of the authorities. The
anarchists had upon several previous Sun
days held meetings upou Trafalgar square,
and had been tolerated by the authorities
on the ground they were not dangerous
and that the mere fact of suppressing
them would call undue attention to the
class of people whose vaporings were only
dangerous when brought to public notice
by an attempt on the part of the authori
ties to prevent them, but the attention of
the House of Commons was called to the
fact that the anarchists at their last meet-
ing in Trafalgar square openly advocated
the policy of blood and dynamite, aud held
up for glorification tbe dynamite outrages
at Barcelona, Marseilles aid other places.
Tbe result was the Home Secretary did
not dare allow any further rope to the
Keds of London, and the police this after
noon mustered a strong force about Trafal
gar square, while reserves were stationed
in Regent street, Waterloo place, Charing
Cross road, Northumberland avenue and
on tbe embankment. Tbe anarchists be
gan to muster at 3 o'clock, and the display
of force caused many thousand* to flock to
the neighborhood.
Male and female anarchists mixed among
the people assembled about tiie square and
began bawking anarchistic literature,
wbicb found a ready sale among the
people. Copies of tbe "Commonweal, tbe
organ of the anarchists, London," found a
ready sale, its frontispice being an
illustration of labor, as Samson, pulling
down tbe pillars of church ana state. It
also contained an article headed "Bombs"
in whicb tbe writer welcomed tbe Bace
lona bomb outrage as a "great and good
act" Anarchist and socialist manifestos
were also distributed broadcast among the
crowds.
Gradually the number of socialists and
anarchists was so augmented that they
gained courage enough to push toward ti>e
center of me square. Finally a large and
excited crowd of anarchists and socialists
collected inside the square. Tbe police
compelled the Reds to move on. This
caused (be anarchists to wave hats and
hoot the police, while gome spectators
cheered and others hissed. Exactly at 3:10
o'clock a number of anarchists made a
rush for the steps at the foot of the Gordon
statue, and one immediately began to make
■ wild address to tliose who had rushed up
to tbe steps with him, but the anarchist
orator had hardly uttered the first sentence
before a number of policemen charged up
to the spot and dislodged the Red* from tbe
steps.
The attempt of the anarchists to hold
this meeting was followed by similar at
tempts, which resulted in a number of
lively brushes with the police. During
the dispersing of these anarchist groups,
a number of reds were pretty roughly
bandied by policemen, who threw them
from the steps. Eventually the anarchists
on the square became so demonstrative
that a further detachment of fifty police
men was sent to the square. Suddenly an
anarchist rushed through the lines of po
lice, scaled a monument and began to ad
dress the crowd around him. but had only
utteied a few words when a policeman
seized and threw him bodily into the
crowd. As the anarchist still tried to
speak, be was seized by two policemen
and hustled to the station, followed by a
shouting crowd.
Shortly before 3:30 o'clock a further de
tachment of mounted police was sum
moned to Trafalgar square, aud after
drawing up In lint> ebarged upon the mob,
scattering them in all directions, after
which the horsemen took up a position on
the south side, faring the square, and the
police on foot began to disperse the mob,
who made but slight resistance.
At 4:30 o'clock a large body of anarch
ists made a ruth down Parliament street,
with the intention of reaching Scotland
Yard. The headquarters of the police is
said to have D-e.n left with a small guard
of policemen, but the superintendent of a
division of policemen promptly dispatched
a strong force of mounted and foot police
to Scotland Yard, the horsemen reaching
the point before the anarchists, and with
the assistance of the police on foot the
mob was scattered. After much scuffling
In other parts of Trafalgar square, the
police had their hands full in keeping the
crowds in movement, and additional re
enforcements of mounted police were sent
for and mad* several charges down
Northumberland avenue patt the Victoria
Hotel and Grand Hotel. The mounted
DOlice also charged through Pall Mall,
driving the anarchists before them. The
police made a number of arrests, the pris
oners being followed to tbe station* by
angry and excited crowds of anarchists,
who loudly cursed Home Secretary Henry
Asquith.
IT CAUSED COMMENT.
Arrival of the Cruiser San Francisco
In Costa Rican Waters.
New York, Dec. 3.— A World special
from San Jose «ays: The arrival of thn
cruiser ban Francisco in Costa Rican
wa ers caused no little comment, and su
perinduces Hi c belief that the United States
is interested in the present political agita
tion here. Since the visit of the Rear
sarge in 1875 and the Atlanta last October
there have been no United States vessels
in the Atlantic ports of Cosu Rica, hence
the conclusion. Mr. Cleveland is more in
timately acquainted with affairs than ap-
Pearson the surface. Tbe political situa
tion is critical. The dictatorship of Senor
Rodriguez is likely to produce a revolution,
which, added to the already panicy condi
tion of finances, imperils tbe welfare of
not only the natives but of foreign resi
dents as well.
WILLIAM WAS ANGRY.
The Wurtemberg Government and
Officers Rebuked by the Emperor.
Loxdon, Dec. 3. — A Berlin dispatch to
the News says it Is reported from Stuttgart
that relations between Wurtemberg and
the empire have been strained since
last summer, when the Wurtemberg
Government, yielding to the urgings
of its Diet, abandoned its maneu
vers, owing to scarcity of fodder. Tbis
was taken amiss in military quarters at
Berlin, and it was believed that the Wur
tftnberg Government had in this matter
submitted to the dictation of Democrats in
the Diet.
It is also stated that Emperor William
during his last visit tn Stuttgart showed
displeasure at this action of the Wurtein
berg Government, and his comments on
the Wurtembcrg army corps were not flat
tering. He blamed tbe leadership. In
consequence the resignations of Comman
der-General Woelcker and the Wurtero
burg Minister of War are expected. Per
haps also thfl Premier may retire. It is an
open secret that Wurtemberg opposes tbe
wine tax.
ITALY'S NEW CABINET.
All Complete With the Exception of
Two Portfolios.
Rome. Dec. J.— The following ministry
has been formed : Canardelli, Premier and
Minister of the Interior; Baratieri, Foreign
Affairs; Fortls, Public Works; San Mar
sano, War; Racchi, Marine; Coccurtu,
Husbandry ; Kiseis, Posts and Telegraphs;
Vacchelli, Treasury; Callo, Education.
Bosselh was offered th«» Finance portfolio,
but is not yet decided. The Minister of
Justice has not yet l>een selected.
General San Marzano had an Interview
with King Humbert and consented to ac
cept the portfolio of War.
It is expected tbe Cabinet will be com
pleted to-morrow and Parliament con
voked December 7.
MESSAGES OF FRIENDSHIP.
Russia and France Still Exchanging
Compliments.
Paris, Dec. 3.— Marshal Canrobert has
received a telegraphic message of friend
ship from the admiral and sailors of the
Russian fleet of tbe Black Sea. The tele
cram was communicated to President
Carnot, who replied, thanking the noble
Ku«sian nation for its careful preservation
of the monument erected to Frenchmen
who fell at Maiakoff, and expressing per
sonal goud wishes to tbe Czar, to his
family and Russian natives and Russian
sailors.
A POLICY APPROVED.
The Dec'ara" ; on of the New
French Ministry.
Dupuy Will Be Opposed in His Can
didacy for Presidency of the
Chamber by Brisson.
Paris, Dec. 3.— The declaration of the
policy of the i ew Ministry, which will be
read by Premier Caslmir-Perier in the
Chamber of Deputies to-morrow, was ap
pioved at a Cabinet council held to-night.
The declaration Is said to be as emphatic
as that of the Dupuy Cabinet against tlie
income tax, a revision of the constitution
and the separation of church and state. A
peaceful foreign policy will be pursued.
Gaulois says Casimir-Perier is anxious
the public should koow he alone will he
responsible for tbe Ministry's declaration,
and that neither Carnot nor any of
Casimir-Perier's colleagues will have a
v ire therein. Dubost, the new Minister
of Justice, was a great friend of Gam
betta. M. Jonnart, Minister of Works,
has had no political experience and is an
ardent protectionist. M. Marty, Miuister
of Commerce, is also an intense protec
tionist. Dupuy, it is expected, will be
opposed in his candidacy for the presi
dency of the Chamber by Brisson, who
will be supported by all tbe radicals and
socialists. Dupuy's voters will be sup
porters of the Government; Brisson's will
be the Government's opponents.
.London. Dec. 3. — A Paris correspondent
of the Times says be is able to state that
previous to the Ministerial crisis France
and Great Britain arrived at an amicable
settlement of the Siamese question. The
settlement included the dispute about the
i.utTer state and the general lines of de
limitation.

inet, the diplomatic corps and the elete of

READY FOR WORK.
Measures to Come Before
Congress.
BILLS TO BE CONSIDERED.
The Hawaiian Question Will
Bob Up in Some Manner.
A RIO.HT OF WAY FOR TARIFF.
Beyond the Receipt of the Presi
dent's Message Very Little
Will Be Done To-Day.
Washington, Dec. 4.— The extra ses
sion disposed ol ail tbe preliminaries gen
erally necessary at the opening of long ses-
3u us, consequent ly there will be none of the
usual reasons why Congress may not begin
business promptly upon convening to
morrow. Between fifty and sixty bills and
resolutions are on tbe Senate calendar, so
it can begin legislating immediately after
the receipt of the President's message.
There a few bills of general importance,
such as Hili's Federal elections bill, the
bill reported by Voorbees on the increase
of circulating notes of national banks:
Morgan's concurrent resolution for tbe ap
pointment of a joint committee to consider
finanancial questions; Stewart's resolu
tions, first, fur a committee to inquire if
any Senators are stockholders in natioual
banks; second, relating to the independ
ence or co-ordinal departments of the Gov
ernment; Peffer's resolution concerning
interstate commerce and Palmer's regard
ing pensions to non-residents.
It is considered probable that none of
these will receive as much attention as tne
Hawaiian question, wnich is not now be
fore tbe Senate In any shape, but which Is
almost sure to ba brought before it io
some way before tbe close of tbe wees.
There will probably be very little busi
ness attempted to-morrow beyond the re
ceipt of the President's message, and prob
ably the Senate will adjourn Thursday un
til Monday of next week.
In tbe House as soon as tbe decks are
cleared the tariff bill will have tbe right
of way. Tbe extraordinary session showed
a purpose not only of eliminating the sil
ver question, but of advancing the tariff
problem four months on the road of solu
tion. Tne Wilson bill will be introduced
la tbe House tbe latter part of the week,
probably Thursday. The estimates of the
revenue to be derived from tbe tariff bill
are completed and will be submitted to
morrow, and will show the deficit in rev
enues will be increased to £60,000,000,
wnichfaust be raised from increased inter
nal revenue taxes or an income tax.
Although til one time last week it was
practically decided to impose a tax on the
incomes of corporations and legacies it is
now almost certain that a tax on incomes
of over £5000 will be recommended.
It m*y be the Hawaiian affair will cut
some fignre in the proceeding?. Resolu
tions calling for tbe papers in tbe case are
almost sure to be introduced, and might
come up in still another way if the news
from Hawaii expected by way of Auckland
December 7 should be of a sensational
nature.
Although tbe extra session succeeded in
getting tbe Chinese question out of the
way for six months at least, by extending
the period of registration that length of
time, it promises to bob up again. It is
broadly hinted ttiat the Cbineae do not in
tend to register now any more than botere
tbe extension of the law.
VOTING ON THE MEASURE.
Congressmen Express Their Opinion
on an Income Tax.
New York, Dec. 3.— The World baa
asked members of Congress, which meets
to-morrow, tbese three questions: "Do
you favor an income tux'. 1 If so, do you
favor a graduated tax? What do you favor
as the minimum of income to be taxed?"
One hundred and seventy-one represen
tatives received the threequeslions, and of
these seventy-one were in favor of an in
come lax in some form and sixty-two op
posed it ; five are against it, but may recon
sider, while thirty-three asked to be ex
cused from expressing an opinion.
Of tbe answers sent to the World seven
show very clearly that an Income tax
question has a geographic phrase. Those
representatives who come fn>tn the East
are opposed to an income tax by a large
majority, those coming from the South
favor it by an even larger majority, while
those from the Weft are more evenly di
vided, with the majority for an income
tax. Tbe following table shows this:

Of the seventy-one answers favoring the
income tax not many were specific as to
the minimum of income to tie taxed.
The drift of opinion, however, seems to
be for $5000 as the limit. Many insist
that U shall not be so low as to include the
income of most skilled laborers.
The in ii j rity of those who favor an in
come tax tavor the graduated income tax.
The poll of tha Senate was not so success
full as that of the Bouse. Of twenty-five
answers received six are in favor of an
income tax and eight are against it, while
eleven Senators decline to express an
opiuion.
HER DEATH IS MOURNED.
Demise of an Estimable and Char
itable Woman.
Sonoma, Dec. 3.— Mrs. Kobert C. John
son died of pneumonia at her house at
Bnena Vista Park at half-pnst 1 o'clock
this morning. Deceased was widely known
for her great charity and liberality. Flags
are flying at hailmast, and • feeling of
profound sorrow pervades the com
munity. Mrs. Johnson was worth several
million dollars, which she has left to rela
tives and charitable institutions. Her
remains will be taken to San Francisco to
morrow and interred in Oakland.
A HAWAIIAN SYMPOSIUM.
What Prominent Writers Say on the
Great Question.
New York, Dec. 3.— The "Hawaiian
situation" is the rnbjret of an important
symposium in the December number of
the North American Review. Eugene
Tyler Chamberlain contributes an article
entitled "The Invasion of Hawaii," in
which be maintains the broad principles
laid down in Daniel Webster's instruc
tions to the United States representative
at Honnlu'u in 1851 were a rule of conduct
ol the Government in its relation with the
Government of Hawaii up to January
16, 1893.
Hon. William M. Springer, In an article
entitled "Our Present Duty," contends
that the only honorable course open to the

tne throne, inasmuch as she was displaced
only by the superior force of American
troops.

D'.ea for annexation. The right solution of
the question is now before the American
people, he says, and will deeply affect the
moral standingnf the United Mates before
the world. The Hawaiian islands have

MELLO'S ESCAPE FROM RIO.
The Rebel Admiral Was Given tha
Location of Government Tor
pedoes by a Spy.
New York. Dec. 3.— A correspondent
of the World cables from Kio de Janeiro:
President Peixoto is surrounded by a crew
of traitors, who influence him to mako
mistakes on purpose to do him harm. It
is safe to say that such men as Lucena Sal
danha Dagaraa and others know ot most
of his resolutions, except, perhaps, mere
military measures, before they are in the
bands of agents to be executed.
In proof of this is the fact that when
his msnifesto was suppressed a World coi
respondent got it from Peixoto through
his bitter enemies. The correspondent
also got a copy of the manifesto, only
fourteen copies of which were printed in
Rio, it being copied for that purpose by
one of Peixoto'« greatest foes.
With a little English money and English
diplomecy they are attempting to accom
plish wnat a very little American sympa
thy and support could have easily averted.

of Coritiba is false. The whole State of
Parana is tranquil. The Aquidabau suc
ceeded in escapiug, owing to the fact that
a spy indicated to the rebel admiral the
location of the Government torpedoes.
Mello feared the arrival of President
Peixoto's squadron."
A HEAVY LOSS.
Destructive Fire Visits the Town of
Delano.
Delano, Dec. 3.— At au early hour this
morning flames were discovered issuing
from the store of F. E. Davis on Front
street. This and the adjoining structures
bfing frame, the fire spread with wonder
ful rapidity, and in a few minutes the
entire corner, including a number of busi
ness houses on two streets, was a mass of
flames. The light wind then blowing
assisted in carrying the embers up the
street, and for a time that portion as well
as residences for several blocks about were
thought to be doomed to destruction, and
household effects were hastily moved into
safe quarters; but fortunately the wind
shifted and the progress of the flames was
arrested and the fire kept within bounds.
The losprs are as follows:
F. E. Davis, eeneral merchandise stock
and building, $11,500, insjurance $7550; E.
R. Pauncelet, new Delano House, $8000,
no insurance; J. C. Heitzeg, harness-snop,
loss $1000 above insurance; J. R. With
row, cigar and variety stoic, $1000, no in
surance; D. S. Coverdale. building, grain
and hay, $1500, no insurance; J. C. Trmrv.
kins, chophou3e, $800, no insurance; H. L.
Waits, meatshop. $600. insurance $250.
G. L. Robertson, real-estate office fixtures,
and J. G. Hanseu, shoeshop, each without
insurance, have small losses.
Nothing has yet been learned as to the
origin of the fire. Owing to the fact that
buildings were considered unsafe few
companies would Imm policies on them.
