TBE M ARB OR OF JCEFVGE.
In connection with the establismentof a
Harbor of Refuge on this lake it has always
been maintained that by dredging the
marsh which extends from the river, back
ot tbe headlands and on to the lake, a nat
ural refuge would be secured that could
not be equaled by any artificial means.
This plan was based upon tbe supposed
tact of this marsh being an outlet and form
er bed of the river itselt, which, having be
come clogged with mud and sand, would
only require cleaning to secure a naviga
ble passage of water. But the survey
that has just been made shows this to be a
mistaken supposition. Tbe report to be
made by Colonel Blunt.and which will be
torwaruea to Washington, will contain
statements to the effect that no bed or out
let ever existed through tbe marsh that
tbe centre ot tbe marsh is higher than eith
er end that to dredge it would cost an im
mense sum owing to the fact that the bot
tom is Bhale and ctay and that even if
dredged the advantages secured as a Har
bor of Refuge would be inferior to those
gained bv tbe erection oi a breakwater.
But while tbe report will state these tacts
it will also state that Fairport is by tar
tbe most favorable location on the lake
for such a breakwater both to aeeommo
date tbe interests ot the shipping and in
pomirui CApeiise.
to secure tne uarDor ot He lucre is of
course to be desired. But tbe sooner the
fact is recognized and acted upon that it
can only be secured by persistent labor
ana influence tne better are the chances
ot success. Natural advantages are a
great help to such a project but amount to
nothing it left to themselves. Not only
should petitions be forwarded to the pres
ent Congress but the labor and influence
of some man should be secured to p!ace
tbe advantages of this harbor fai"iy before
tbe Committee. It would be au excellent
opportunity tor some of Mr. Garfield's
friends to induce that gentleman to carry
out some of tbe many promises be made
so treely during the last compaign.
"STACY'S TRIAL."
A new turn in the Ode of affair:
As tbe readers of the Journal are well
aware the case of the village ot Paines
ville vs. W. S. Stacy for alleged violation
ot the McConnellsville ordinance has been
a topic of local interest for some weeks
past. The trial lasted for over twenty
days nnd no labor or legal ability were
spared on either side to win for the one or
the other a victory. The final charge of
tbe Mayor was made on Thursday, and the
case given to tbe jury. Tbe first ballot in
the jury -room showed a division, and after
two days tbe jury still remained as at first
tbree tor acquittal and nine for convic
tion, f inaiiigtnat mere was no probabil
ity of their agreement tbe Mayor dis
charged lbetr on Saturday evening.
A motion was then made by tbe defense
that no further action could be had as tbe
court was one ot limited jurisdiction and
possessed no power except such as might
specifically be bestowed and the ordi
nance having made no explicit provision
lor sucn a staiooi anairs as tnen existed,
there was in reality no authority by which
tbe Court could proceed. The motion
was overruled, however and a new venire
issued and tbe case adjourned uutil
Thursday morning, at nine o'clock.
At that time tbe trial was not proceeded
witb, however, as tbe defense unexpec
tedly aeveiopea a new line i tactics.
Upon tbe opening of Court Mr. Stacy's
bondsman, D. Warner, Jr., appeared in
Court and announced that he bad tbe do
fendant in Court and desired to deliver
him up and be released from bis bail-bond
As no other bondsman was offered tbe
Court directed Marshal Tuttle to take the
defendant into his custody. But so soon
as this was done Sheriff Mosher, wbo had
been standing a few steps away, at once
advanced and claimed possession of tbe
prisoner by reason of a writ or habeas
corpus which lie held and which had been
issued from the Probate Court of the
County. An examination of the applies
tion for this writ shows that it was i sued
upon the affidavits of the defendant's
counsel. ami conversation with them shows
that the object of this move is to bring the
question of the jurisdiction and power i
the Mayor's Court hiifoie a higher Trilu .
nal. The case in the Probate Court is se
tor hearing on Wednesday next, and the
case before tbe Mayor adjourned until
that tune.

A disease of a character that has proved

out among horses in Akron, over seventy-

and from twenty to twenty-five died. The
Xfeocon describes tbe symptoms as follows:
a stagge ing gait ana loss ot appetite
seem to be the most prominent and preva
lent, accompanied witb a violent cough
and fever. Post mortem examinations
have shown that tbe lungs were partially
affected, these being black a:d rotten. A
great deal of inflammation was noticed
about the case of tbe heart, auu tbe con
dition of tbe liver evidenced a great deal
of bile in the blood. The mucous mem.
brane was also highly inflamed; in fact, a
shattered state of tbe system was mani
fested. Tbe loss ot appetite, a leading
veteiinary surgeon contends, is the first
dreaded note oi the disease, for, as the
animal refuses to take nourishment and
drink, it is most impossible, in many cases,
to entet a cure, ine iatai cases thus far
bave had a run of eight days, and as the
weather grows colder tbe fatality in
