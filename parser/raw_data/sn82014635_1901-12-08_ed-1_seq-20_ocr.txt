KANSAS AND OLD MEXICO. ' -
Recalling the recommendation of McKinley and' the later
endorsement of Roosevelt -touching a. reyjsion. of the tariff
law along reciprocity lines, the attention -of the Kansas
delegation in Congress is respectively direcied to the fact
of the contiguity of Mexico,' and Kansas, and to the in
creasing trade of this state in that country, .in spite of a
Mexican tariff -which seeks to he prohibitive. The Mexicau
people are liberal consumers of Kansas grains, meats and
also to some extent of our manufactured products. So
far as -wheat is concerned California -would no doubt com
pete "with Kansas in the Mexican markets. But -when it
comes to corn and hogs, the two things most desired by
Mexico, Kansas is more favorably located than any other
State producing these commodities. The other states
bordering on Mexico or having railroads reaching Mexico
dc not have corn, nor hogs, nor butter for export. A reci
procity treaty therefore between Mexico and this country
would unquestionably prove highly favorable to Kansas
and to her railways.

HIS TROUSERS AND OTHER THINGS.
Britania is just now very demonstrative In her affection
for your Uncle Samuel, pretending not to notice that the
short end of his trousers' legs are held down by Monroe
doctrine straps, and that his hat is made of pelagic seal
skins, and his tout ensemble, generally, the product of a
high protective tariff. King Edward, only the other day,
asked that the Star Spangled Eanner be played for his
delectation, which he encored."- All this is very nice, and in
view of the attitude of fe continental powers touching
England's African raid, quite assuring. Still back of this
ostentatious demonstration of love for America by Great
Britain, at this particular juncture, there is an ill-concealed
chagrin which is periodically evidenced by the English
press. The London Chronicle, in commenting on the
Roosevelt message does not take to its Monroe doctrine
leanings, indulging in the rather ungracious insinuations.
That paper goes on to say that "whether the European
nations are likely to respect this American prohibition
much longer, when the desirable colonizing grounds of the
world are being snapped up in a headlong race, must depend
ultimately uponthe ability of the United States to enforce
their prohibition."
The Chronicle and the balance of the world will wake
up some day to the fact that the United States of America
is the whole thing, and on both the continents of the
Western Hemisphere; that in this sentiment the people of
the United States are unanimous, which sentiment is back
ed by an army of non-enlisted soldiers that was never whip
ped, augmented by a navy that has sunk two national
fleets within the briefest period without the los3 of a ship.
The Monroe doctrine is not a political party doctrine, but
one of the entire people of the United States. The Demo
ciatic party stands as firmly by it as the Republican party.
The secretary of the late Democratic administration official
ly promulgated" this memorable sentence for the better in
formation of the world at large and more especially for
the benefit of England: "The United States government
is practically sovereign on the western continent, and hef
fiat is law." That declaration embodies all there is in the
Monroe doctrine. The fiat is that no European powers
will be permitted to interfere with the affairs and destinies
of the Republics and states of either North or South Amer
ica, nor to in any sense exploit either for territorial pos
session $r dominancy.
That .pari of the president's message in which he says:
'Ve do not guarantee any state against punishment, if it
mis-conducts itself, provided that punishment does not take
the form of acquisition of territory by any non-American
power," is highly gratifying to Secretary Hay and the
state department.
"Without doubt it was a hint intended for President Cas
tro of Venezuela, whose defiance, under the assumed pro
tection of the Monroe doctrine, of foreign powers, particu
larly of Germany and England, has become very offensive
of late. German papers have, semi-officially, intimated
that, were it not for this American principle, coercion
would long ago have been used to protect German interosts
In Venazuela.
THAT NEW REPUBLICAN PLANK.
The latest political fake to be honored by a public an
nouncement is one to the effect that the next national Re
publican platform will contain a plank favoring the gov
ernment ownership of railways.
If the Republican party next to its patriotism makes
ne claim of more importance than another it is that in
aiiding wealth to the nation it guarantees prosperity to the
people. Under federal management the railroads of this
country would fail, by hundreds of millions annually, to
ram the interest on the purchase price, even if the owners
y the railroads should be compelled or otherwise agree
to part with their property at half of its estimated valua
:.on. Or upon the other hand, if the owners should turn
the roads over for nothing, merely demanding that the
government should assume the outstanding Interest bearing
.'Migatiuns. the Republic would be assuming an enormous
urden for a century to come. The public ownership of
he railways of this country, as a temptation, as a source
A political corruption, could not be guessed, let alone es
timated. All that an ambitious man in the Presidential
. hair would have to do to become a monarch, would be to
sond to the nearest jeweler to make his crown. When the
Republican party, if it ever should, resolves upon putting
ibat socialistic plank in its platform, there will be left to its
rank and file only Populists, railway magnates, security
.-jobbers and intriguing politicians. The great body of its
irembership would desert the organization, volens nolens.
VU TING FANG WANTS TO TALK.
It goes without saying that when it comes to Chinese
immigration, we Americans are inconsistent, are not true
to the boast that this country is an asylum for all the
world's oppressed. The "sand lot" cry of "down with
Chinese cheap labor" has become a national policy. With as
good morals and as true logic we might exclude the Italian
or the laborers of any other European nation. It is not,
therefore, a question of principle, but one of policy.
Minister Wu Ting Fang appeals for fair treatment of
his country and his rare by the Tnited States. He says that
In woe!! be willing to meet any three American editors
favoring the Chinese Exclusion Act and debate with thew
the qui? ;:vn bton- an impartial tribunal. It would be
three apali.-t oh. but Minister Wu would take the rik
cf beins. nur to itrote Ins c-ae. Whether thuy beiieve
In the exclusion of the Chinese or not, the people of the
United States admire the representative of that Celestial
empire in this country.and commend him ;for. his loyalty to
his. race and able efforts to secure for his people what he
regards as fair, treatment by the great nation which claima
to be just in. its dealings with, all other nations. Wu Ting
Fang is in a position to-accomplish-more -for his people
than any rew nian","l6S6 informed n-the Situation, mlless
known to the citizens o'f-our republic, "whom China might
send here to take his place. That country will make a
great mistake if it recalls him.
AS TO KANSAS' MONUMENT FUND.
The memorial association having asked Governor Stan
ley to take charge of the contributions which Kansas peo
ple might desire to make, and he having agreed to do so,
and after he had written hundreds of letters to school
teachers and editors, Ryerson Ritchie of Cleveland, Ohio,
a member of the association, sneaks in with a scheme to
have the contributions forwarded directly to him This will,
if not headed off. wreck the effort for this state, or materi
ally cut short the fund that would otherwise be contributed
by the admirers of McKinley in the state. When the
governor was informed that Ritchie was addressing Kan
sas postmasters and others for the purpose of having
monies for the McKinley monument forwarded to him di
rect, he said: "Too many cooks spoil the broth," when
he made the discovery, "and too many heads to the Kansas
end of the monument project will kill it Either Ryerson
or I will have to quit, and I have written him so. I
guess he is drawing a salary for his services and he wants
to earn it."
Governor Stanley has been sending out letters to school
superintendents and others in order to interest the school
children in the movement He desired to have a special
McKinley program rendered in the schools on January 29,
the birthday of both McKinley and Kansas. He has re
ceived replies to some of these letters telling him of what
Ritchie has done.
THE LIGHT AND POVER OF PUBLICITY.
President Roosevelt holds that publicity is the surest
and most effacacious agency for righting the wrongs and
correcting the abuses of combined capital as exemplified
in the trust Publicity is the most powerful agency also
for public well-being in many other directions. Wrong
doing, of whatever stamp or character, cannot stand long
before the light of universal knowledge. And so, as
some contemporary puts it, the newspaper of toda yis the
greatest factor in civilization. Take away the newspaper
and you would take away the greatest preacher, teacher,
assistant to justice, deterrer of criminals, reformer of pub
lio and private life, patriot, statesman, that it has been
possible for the wit of man to devise. No other Institu
tion is, in anything like the same measure, such a dis
penser of sweetness and light and upholder of the hands
of justice. No other institution is, in anything like the
same degree, such a help to good men, such a hinderanco
to bad men. For the former the newspaper smooths teheir
way and makes their road level before them; to the latter
the newspaper is a lion In the path. The people of America
appreciate this to the full; there is no need of telling them
any further what they know already.
WE MUST HAVE MORE SHIPS.
All Republicans are agreed that something should be
done to build up the shipping interest in this country. Con
gressman Hemenway of Indiana, calls attention to the fact
that an engine company in Indianapolis sends a consider
able part of its product to South America, but must always
ship the same by way of Liverpool. A plow manufactory in
Illinois sells more plows in South America than does any
other manufactory in the world, but its plows all go across
the Atlantic Ocean to Liverpool and thence back over the
Atlantic to South America. Such conditions are humiliat
ing to Americans and are not in line with good business.
About the thinnest thing in the world next to hammered
sunbeams is the veneer of the average reformer. The pres
ident of the society for the prvntion of crulty to animals
in New York, has had the president of the society for the
prevention of cruelty to children arrested for putting burr
bits on his horses.

My friend smiled anil, lighted a fresh
cigarette. He puzzled me. Rumor had
led me to expect to nnd him after my i
long absence a disappointed It not sourea
man.' I had sought him here in the re
treat where he and his cold, uncongenial
wife lived, it was said, like a pair of her
mits. . I was ready to give m all the pity and
sympathy -which a bachelor of experience
can feel for the irremediable mistake of
a married friend.
"You are just the same. I went on,
"with that romantic un-English look, as
I called it, which you never -would ack
nowledge. You remember I dubbed you.
'The Troubadour."
He nodded and hummed a verse of the
little ofa obsolete song;.
She for the troubadour hopelessly wept;
JTnder the battlement softly he crept,
Singing "From Palestine hither I come.
Lady love, lady love, welcome me home."
"Oh, that she!" I exclaimed, "Does she
still hopelessly weep or did she welcome
you home?"
"Have vou been hearing tales about
me?" he asked: "Shall I tell you the
story of my wedded life?"
"If it does not pain you."
"Where shall I begin?" he asked.
"At the beginning. You are very young,
careless and Ithink heart-whole when I
went to the other end of the world."
"Do you know that I have been a mil
lionaire in the meantime?"
"I have heard something of it"
"The wealth of an ancient relative
poured in on me after his death. How
the golden wave came and wont is a story
by itself. For five gilded years I was
transfigured in the eyes of the world, and
it was during that period I met and fell
in love with my wife."
It was not I alone who thought her
supremely beautiful. The world had al
ready bestowed on her a queenship before
the June day when I first saw her at an
open-air fete, all in white, pale, cold, se
vere and sweet, like a goddess In marble.
"If it be the case that what everybody
says must be true, then true It was that
the cold, exquisite daughter, and her
haughty, hawk-like mother were adven
turesses playing a game for fortune,
beauty, against a slender purse and a
year or two of prime youth. Already
beauty had over and over again dared to
reject love, adoration and fortune consid
erable. "Their figure has not yet been
reached," -whispered a cynical friend;
"your million will do it.' By this time I
had proclaimed myself an open worshiper
and moth-like, was reeling round the
flame. I am bound to admit that all the
encouragement I received was from the
mother. The daughter remained Icy. I
persisted In my suit and In a short time
was the accepted lover of the woman who
held me In thrall."
"She accepted you willingly?"
"Tacitly so. The mother seized on me
with effusion. My affianced wife appeared
just to endure her new position with pa
tience, nothing more. The mother assur
ed me that her daughter had a most af
fectionate nature hidden under that chill
exterior. She loved me and she had nev
er loved any other man. I tried to be
lieve her even though my heart craved
for more tenderness. And so we wed."
He continued: "After a time when
the excitement of my first pride and hap
piness had subsided I began to feel reluc
tantly conscious that there was some
thing wanting in our life together. My
wife's behavior was perfect from every
point of view, but there was a wall of re
serve between us which nothing was ablo
to break through. "Wherever we went I
was aware that people said I had been
married without love for the sake of my
million. How was I to feel sure that the
verdict was not a true one? Had she giv
en her heart to some worthy fellow who
was millionless and rejected him even as
she had accepted me at her mother's
bidding?
"I resolved to take things as they came
and to make the best of the goods the
gods had provided for me. "We led a life
of amusement and pleasure. Our house
In London and our country house (not this
house, something much grander) were as
perfect as money could make them. My
wife went everywhere dressed and be
Jeweled as tho world expected to see her.
We entertained the smart crowd known
as society.
"As time went on her reserve, which
was my despair, communicated itself to
me, and the impassable barrier between
us was complete."
There was another silence while the
rising wind soughed though the wet trees.
"Do you apprehend the situation?"
"Perfectly," I said.
"Does all tills agree with what my
friends say about me in London?"
"I confess -I had heard that you had
unfortunately, married a cold and heart
less woman," I said.
We went on smoking In silence. At
last he said abruptly, "I have more to
tell."
"Hurt yourself no further, dear old
friend, I think I can imagine all the rest"
We smoked in silence for about a min
ute and then he continued:
"Some other time I may tell you of how
my unexpected fortune departed as sud
denly and surprisingly as it arrived. The
news of what appeared to be total ruin !

LITTLE WILLIE, THE BOER
The author of the subjoined little sketch
is a young Norwegian who, after a few
years' stay in the Transvaal, at the Out
break of the war was on a visit at his j
home in Christiania, Norway; but Immed
iately left the safe shelter of his parents
house to take up ".'arms for the Boers.
After much difficulty he succeeded la
reaching the scene of war, wher: he par
ticipated in many skirmishes and battles.
Ha was a member of a commando whieh
went over to Portuguese territory and Jafd
down its arms, and he is now held as a
prisoner of war at Alcoboca, Portugal.
Translator.
Little Willy was one of thoso brave j
Boers who found ueata in tne mmie
light at Broonikoorstspruit. He was only
14 years old, but as good a shot as any
grown up man. He was a dark-haired,
light-hearted lad, with handsome brown
eyes, an ever-smiling, well shaped mouth
and a sun-burnt, honest face. He never
wore a coat, and as he always went
around in knickerbockers he made the
stronger impression of being a mere boy.
His father had been killed by a shell In a
fight in the Orange Free State, and Utile
Willy had witnessed the tragedy, ins
mother had died several years before the
war broke out, and brothers and sisters
he had none. For these reasons, and On
account of hi3 light-heartcdness and
buoyant spirits, he was the favorite of the
whole camp.
He was practically well thought of by
us in the corps of scouts, and several
times followed us when patrolling outside
of Pretoria. Full of tricks ho was, wheth
er it was on the battlefield or in the
camp. He had a little fat Basuto pony
to which he was as much attached as to
his beloved rifle, and he was always busy
ing himself with these two treasures of
his. when off duty. Little Willy did not
belong to our corps, but when we had
been ordered out. it could not be helped
he had to go along, be it night or day.
He was trusted as much as anybody else
on outpost duty, little though he was.
Our captain often asked him on such oc
sions if he was not afraid of the English
men, but his constant answer was that
he had been afraid only once the day his
father was torn to pieces by a shell. One
weakness Little Willy had, nevertheless.
He was passionately fond of cigarettes
and he always tried to have some with
him when he wentto fight.
At last came the day that was to be
fateful for Little Willy. In the evening
Commandant Pinaar (he Is styled our j
general here in the prisoners camp in
Jortugal). had received orders to try to
take a small" English camp by surprise.
The order had come from General Botho
himself and Little Willy had learned
about it, although he had not been order
ed out. When, at night he heard us sad
dling our horses, he had smelled a rat,
and saddled his pony, too.
He rode that night between Lieut Dick
Hunt, an American, and myself. He spoke
all the time about the pleasure he felt
now that he was to have another scrap
with the Englishmen; and he had taken
extra ammunition along; for he had two
cartridge belts hanging across his should
ers and one around his waists; all well
stocked with Mauser cartridges. At dnwn
we were close upon the British outposts,
which were Immediately driven back, and
we took a position only 1,500 yards from
the British camp. Little Willy placed;
himself right behind me, a little higher
up back of the big boulder. The English
men, of course, at once marched out. and
presentb' we were In the middle of a ter
rible fusillado.
In the meantime. Little Willy was firing
to his heart's content and now and then
between the shots, -c was calling out any
thing but nice greeting to the English
men. After about an hour of hard fight
ing, one-half of our command was or
dered to take another position, while the
rest of us. who were then relatively few,
had to try to hold our rather hard-pressed
position until the men of Gen. V. VII
joen could come to our assistance. I did
not pay much attention to Little Willy
until he suddenly called out:
"Look out, there! The Englishmen are
close upon us."
Now commenced a furious battle, at a
distance of only 230 or 300 yards and twlco
they tried to take our position by assault,
but had to give up the attempt. The
bullets whistled past us. and the air was
full of dust and stone fragments.
During this furious fight, which only
lasted about twenty minutes. I all of a
sudden heard Willy call out my name,
but I could not pay any attention to him
because at that moment a Boer at. my side
received a bullet in the abdomen and I
had to tr to find cover for htm. A little
while therpafter we were relieved, and the
Englishmen retired. Now, I thought of
Willy, and I called his name. Receiving
no answer. I crept up to his position.
There he was. lying on his back behind
the boulder, while a big pool of blood un
der his head showed where he had bees,
shot. The bullet had gone through hia
head above the left oye and had removed
almost the back part of tho head, so th
wound might indicate that the English
men had used explosive or Dum-Dum bul
lets. I immediately called our captain and
lieutenant, who were close by and show
ed them where our little comrade lay.
And, though a strong and brave man. our
captain could not restrain his tears at j
sight of the handsome, chlidish face of 1
the valiant little defender. j
Willy must bavo died immediately and j
his last word must have bn when b
called roy name. His pale face was not
spotted by blood; there were onlr a fw !
drops where the bullet had entereu. wis

cartridges showed that he had fought for
his country to the last. We dtC a grave

FUN OF THE WORLD.
"I came mighty near being cheated out
of that election," said Senator Sorghum;
"mightj- near. It made me think of a
poker game I was once in."
"What kind of a game was thatr asked
the attache who has had bis salary rais

place. "Weil, all 1 cau, say about it is
that if the other fellows hadn't been too
busy stacking the cards and dealing off

The children of a certain family during
its prosperity were left in the nursery in
charge of servants. When the adversity
came the servants were discharged and
the parents lived with the littte ones. One
evening, when the father had returned
home after a day of anxiety and buslnes3
worry, his little girl clambered on bis
knee, and, twisting her arms around his
neck, said: .
"Papa, don't get rich again. Tou did
not come into the nursery when you were
rich, but now we can come around you
and get on your kneo and kiss you. Don't
get rich again, papa."

The twelve year old son of an Irishman
of Philadelphia was thought to bo ill with
smallpox, but after an examination the
doctor assured the father that Jamesle
had no symptoms of smallpox, but was
suffering from an attack of German meas
les. At that the old man grow very
wroth, and began to pour the vials, of his
wrath upon the head of Jamesle. "Kow
often have Ol told yez to kape aw. ,
from thlm Dooch children?" he demand
ed. "Soo phhwat yez get fer playin wid
thlm. Now, Ol s'pose, yez'll be taken
to th German hospital, an' It'll serve yez

Two young men sat through the first
act at a local theater, then adjourned to
a neighboring tavern for refreshment.
Tho acting was bad, and would have ex
cused the use of stimulants by any but
the players. When about to re-enter the
building only one could prod una his re
turn check.
"It's all right." said he of the check
airily. "Tou remember him; he's with
me.
"Yes," answered tho gatekeeper, more
doubtful than polito, "but he may havs
given his check to some other person.'
"But ho didn't," was the convincing re
ply. "He's a stranger here and hasn't
an enemy in tho city."
The experience of teachers with their
younger pupils especially, to whom in
structions must be conveyed "line upon
line" and In tho most literal sense, fur
nishes some amusing chapters. A teach
er had been reading to her young pupils
an account of a man "who had lived for
some years upon the frontier." When the
story was reproduced by the child to her
surprise it road that he had lived for
some years 'on his front ear!" Another
teacher read that a genteman "had occu
pied for some time a fine country seat."
TTpon asking the children what was meant
by a 'fine country seat," 'a dead silence
reigned till one little fellow said he
thought he knew and to the inquiry of
the teacher replied. "A milking stool!"

In a certain skirmish an officer got a
slight scratch on the leg. The wound was
a matter of great glory to him and he
nursed it through after days, growing
lamer with every fear that the memory
of his bravery might pass out of iniad.
One day. late in life, an he sat nursing
his leg and pondering the glorious past,
a young man visiting the family for the
llrst time approached and sympatheti
cally remarked:
"Lame, Colonel?"
"Yes, sir," after a pause and with in
expressible solemnity; "I am lama
'Been riding, sir?"
2Co' with rebuking sternness I have
not been riding."
"A slip down on the pavement?"
"No. sir," with actual ferocity.
"Perhaps, then, you have apraiaed your
ankle,sir?"
With a painful slowness, the old man
lifted his pet leg in both hands, set It
carefully down upon tho floor, rose slow
ly from his chair, and, looking down
upon the unfortunate youth with mingled
pity and wrath burst forth In the sublim
ity of rage:
'Go and read the history of your coun
