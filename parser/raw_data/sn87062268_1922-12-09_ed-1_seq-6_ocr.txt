New Orleans Cotton
NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 8. The
more important price movements in
cotton today were due to statistics
and they gave the market a very
steady undertone, but without, how
ever, arousing any very great buying
power. Ginning returns to the first
of December of 9,138,144 bales just
about met expectations on the long
side; mill takings for the week of
437,000 bales, against 383,000, this
week last year, were altogether larg
er than expected and sent the market
to its highest levels, 24.57 cents a
pound for January and to net gains
on the list of 15 to 23 points. Small
recessions occurred In the late ses
sion, under realizing on the long side,
and the market closed at net gains of
11 to 15 points, with the January pos
ition at 24.47.
Better cables than due helped to
cause a higher opening. During the
first call, the ginning figures were
(ne) of section seventeen (17). town
ship four (4) north of range thirty-two
(32) west, containing forty (40) acres
more or less, together with the tene
ments, hereditaments, and appurten
ances thereunto belonging, or pertain
ing, the whole free from all exemption
or right of homestead. Deed at cost
of purchaser.
F. R. ANDERSON.
Special Master
their effect was almost completely
offset by the efforts of traders on
the long side to take profits on the
hard spot they felt would be created.
First gains amounted to one to 14
points, near months being much
an extent that the market was forced
to declines under yesterday's close
of 18 to 20 points, January dropping
to 24.16.
For a while the market remained
depressed and trading became light
but the weekly statistics caused a new
period of activity and strength which
lasted until longs went to realizing
again in too large a way. The market
seemed to be steaedier in the after
noon by the decrease of 20,689 bales
for the week in the visible supply of
American cotton, the first decrease
since the crop movement became
heavy.
New York Cotton
NEW YOKK, Dec. 8. Slightly
larger ginning figures than expected
caused some liquidation at the open
ing of the cotton markettoday. The
offerings wrre absorbed on a compar
aively moderate decline, however,
and rallies followed which carried
prices into new" high ground for the
movement. January contracts sold up
from 24.51 to 24.87 and closed at 24.'78
with the general market closing
steady at a net advance of 10 to 15
po.ints.
