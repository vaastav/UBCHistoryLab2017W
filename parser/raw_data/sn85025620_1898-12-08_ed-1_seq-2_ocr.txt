As average-sized man weighs 140
pounds a woman 125 pounds. Curious­
ly enough, the mean weight and
height of lunaties are below those of
sane people. Another unexpected
thing in this respect is that a Ne­

of an Englishman.

ONE of the best signs of the times as
regards the success of the motor car­

A LONDON paper says that an an ad­
jutant in the Salvation Army has
achieved the remarkable feat of sing­

was called a "singing battle." He be­
gan with "I will follow Jesus," and
hymn after hymn followed swiftly.
When he reached the Doxology, after
singing eight extra hymns, he was two

stipulated time. When he finished he
shouted: "Bless the Lord I've broken

AN odd marriage custom obtains in
the island of Himla, opposite the is­
land of Rhodes. The Greeks, by whom
it is peopled, earn their living by the
sponge fisheries. No girl is allowed to
marry until she has brought up a cer­
tain number of sponges, which must
be taken from a certain depth. In
some of the other Greek islands it is
the men who must dive
for the sponges.
If there are several suitors
for the hand
of a maiden the father bestows her on
the man who can bring up the largest
number of sponges.
LAKE SUPEBIOR may lose its distinc­
tion of being the largest body of fresh
water on the globe. African explorers
begin to think Lake Victoria Nyanza
is larger. Superior covers 31,200 square
miles, and Nyanza has been credited
with about 30,000 but recent explora­
tions have discovered a hitherto un­
known bay on its southern side, which
so increases its known area as to make
it a question whether it is not larger
than Superior. Fuller explorations
and more careful surveys must be made,
however, before a decision is reached.
THE latest invention is a pipe line

with water, etc. The glass pipe does
not corrode, is impervious to the elec­
trolysis in underground conduits, and,
it is claimed, is less likely to break
than iron pipe. An Ohio company is
now putting in.
such a pipe line, and a
practical test of the system will soon
be possible for a distance of 100 miles
at least.
StTLPHUB is one of the most effica­
cious cures for diphtheria. All that is
needed is flour of sulphur and a quill,
and with these one celebrated physic
cian cured every patient without ex­
ception. He put a teaspoonful of flour
of sulphur into a wine glass of water,
and stirred it with his finger instead of
a spoon, the sulphur not readily amal­
gamating with water. When it was
well mixed the physician gave it as
gargle, and in ten minutes the patient
was out of danger. Sulphur kills every
species of fungus in a man, beast and
plant in a few minutes. Swallowing
the gargle will do no harm.

Washington, Dec. 5.—Following is the
text of President McKinley's annual
message read at the opening of the last
session of the Fifty-first congress:
To the Senate and House of Representa­
tives: Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our people
rejoice In a very satisfactory and steadily
increasing degree of prosperity evidenced
by the largest volume of business ever re­
corded. Manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abun­
dant returns, labor in the fields of industry
is better rewarded, revenue legislation
passed by the present congress has in­
creased the treasury's receipts to the
amount estimated by its authors, the
finances of the government have been suc­
cessfully administered and its credit ad­
vanced to the flrst rank, while its currency
has been maintained at the world's highest
standard. Military service under a com­
mon flag and for a righteous cause has
strengthened the national spirit and served
to cement more closely than ever the fra­
ternal bonds between every section of the
country. A review of the relation of the
United States to other powers, always ap­
propriate, is this year of primary impor­
tance in view of the momentous issues
which have arisen, demanding in one in­
stance the ultimate determination by arms
and involving far-reaching consequences
Which will require the earnest attention
of the congress.
SPAIN AND CUBA.
A Resume of the Conditions Which
Led Up to the War.
In my last annual message very full con­
sideration was given to the question of
the duty of the government of the United
States toward Spain and the Cuban In­
surrection as being by far the most im­
portant problem with which we were then
called upon to deal. The considerations
then advanced, and the exposition of the
views therein expressed, disclosed my
sense of the extreme gravity of the situ­
ation. Setting aside, as logically un­
founded or practically inadmissible, the
recognition of the Independence of Cuba,
neutral intervention to end the war by im­
posing a rational compromise between the
contestants, intervention in favor of one
or the other party, and forcible annexation
of the island, I concluded it was honestly
due to our friendly relations with Spain
that she should be given a reasonable
chance to realise her expectations of re­
form, to which she. had become irrevocably
committed. Within a few weeks previous­
ly she had announced comprehensive plans,
which it was confidently asserted would
be efficacious to remedy the evils so deep­
ly affecting our own country, so injurious
to the true interests of the mother country
as well as to those of Cuba, and so repug­
nant to the universal sentiment of hu­
manity.
The ensuing month brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of
Cuba. The autonomous administration set
up in the capital and some of the prin­
cipal cities appeared not to gain the favor
of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend
their influence to the large extent of ter­
ritory held by the insurgents while the
military arm, obviously unable to cope
with the still active rebellion, continued
many of the most objectionable and offen­
sive policies of the government that had
?orded
receded it. No tangible relief was af
the vast numbers of unhappy re
concentrados despite the reiterated pro­
fessions made in that regard -and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that
end. The proffered expedient of zones of
cultivation proved illusory indeed, no less
practical nor more delusive promises of
succor could well have been tendered to the
exhausted and destitute people, stripped of
all that made life and home dear and
herded in a strange region among unsym­
pathetic strangers hardly less necessitous
than themselves.
By the end of December the mortality
among them had frightfully increased.
Conservative estimates from Spanish
Bources placed the deaths among these dis­
tressed people at over 40 per cent, from the
time Gen. Weyler's decree of reconcentra­
tion was enforced. With the acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contribu­
tions raised In this country and distrib­
uted under the direction of the consul-gen­
eral and several consuls by noble and ear­
nest Individual effort through the organ­
ised agencies of the American Red Cross.
Thousands of lives were thus saved, but
many thousands more were inaccessible to
such forms of aid.
The war continued on the old footing
without comprehensive plan, developing
only the same spasmodic encounters, bar­
ren of strategic result, that had marked the
course of the earlier ten years' rebellion as
well as the present insurrection from Its
start. No alternative save physical ex­
haustion of either combatant and there­
withal the practical ruin of the Island lay
In sight, but how far distant no one could
ventuia to conjecture.
Destruction of the Maine.
At this juncture, on the 15th of Febru­
ary last, occurred the destruction of the
battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in
the harbor of Havana on a mission of in­
ternational courtesy and good will—a
catastrophe the suspicious nature and hor­
ror of which stirred the nation's heart pro­
foundly. It is a striking evidence of the
poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing
our national character that this shocking
blow, falling upon a generous people, al­
ready deeply touched by preceding events
in Cuba, did not move them to an instant,
desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the
existence of a condition of danger and dis­
order at our doors that made possible such
a deed by whomsoever wrought. Yet the
instinct of justice prevailed and the nation
anxiously awaited the result of the search­
ing Investigation at once set on foot. The
finding of the naval board of inquiry estab­
lished that the origin of the explosion was
external by a submarine mine, and only
i^whrough
lack of
Positive testimony
to fix the responsibility of Its authorship.
Action of Congress.
AH these things carried conviction to the
most thoughtful, even before the finding
of the naval court, that a crisis in our re­
lations with Spain toward Cuba was at
hand. So strong was this belief that it
needed but a brief executive sugges­
tion to the congress to receive imme­
diate answer to the duty of making Instant
provision for the possible and perhaps
speeduy probable
emergency of war,
and the
remarkable, almost unique, spectacle was
presented of a unanimous vote, of both
bouses on the 9th of March, appropriating
$60,000,000 for the national defenses and for
each and every purpose connected there­
with, to be expended at the discretion of
the president." That this act of provision
came none too soon was disclosed when the
application of the fund was undertaken.
Our forts were practically undefended. Our
navy seeded large provision for Increased
ammunition and supplies, and even num­
bers to cope with any sudden attack from
the navy of Spain, which comprised mod­
ern vessels of the highest type of conti­
nental' perfection. Our army also required
enlargement of men and munitions. The
detays of the hurried preparation for the
dreaded contin ..
clent, to say that the outbreak of the
war, wnen it did come, found onr nation not
unprepared to meet the conflict.
Efforts Continued.
Still animated by the hope of a peaceful
•olutiouand obeying the dictates of duty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about
ssss^ssis-i&stsssss^is
,/r-es
with the government of Spain, looking to
the immediate conclusion of a six months'
armistice in Cuba with a view to effect the
recognition of her people's right to inde­
pendence. Besides this, the instant revo­
cation of the order of reconcentration was
asked, so that the sufferers, returning to
thoir homes and aided by united American
and Spanish effort might be put in a way
to support themselves and, by orderly re­
sumption of the well-nigh destroyed pro­
ductive energies of the island, contribute
to the restoration of its tranquility and
well-being.
Negotiations continued for some little
time at Madrid, resulting in offers by the
Spanish government which could not but
be regarded as inadequate. It was pro­
posed to confide the preparation of peace
to the insular parliament, yet to be con­
vened under the autonomous decrees of
November, 1897. but without impairment In
any wise of the constitutional powers of
the Madrid government, which, to that
end, would grant an armistice, if solicited
by the Insurgents, for such time as the
general in chief might see lit to flx. How
and with what scope of discretionary
powers the Insular parliament was ex­
pected to set about the "preparation" of
peace did not appear. If it were to be by
negotiation with the Insurgents, the issue
seemed to rest on the one side with a body
chosen' by a fraction of the electors in the
districts under Spanish control, and on
the other with the insurgent population
holding the Interior country, unrepresented
In the so-called parliament, ana defiant
at the suggestion of suing for peace.
CONGRESS ASKED TO ACT.
Whole Question Submitted to Legis­
lators on April 11.
Grieved and disappointed at this barren
outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach
a practical solution, I felt it my duty to re­
mit the whole question to the congress.
In the message of April U, 1898,1 announced
that with this last, overture in the direc­
tion of immediate peace in Cuba, and its
disappointing reception by Spain, the ef
'fort of the executive was brought to an
end. I again reviewed the alternative
course of action which I had proposed,
concluding that the only one consonant
with international policy and compatible
with our firm-set historical traditions was
intervention as a neutral to stop the war
and check the hopeless sacrifice of life,
even though that resort involved "hostile
constraint upon both the parties to the
contest, as well to enforce a truce as to
b'uide the eventual settlement."
The grounds justifying that step were:
The interests of humanity the duty to
protect life and property of our citizens in
Cuba the right to check injury to our com­
merce and people through the devastation
of the island, and, most important, the need
of removing at once and forever the con­
stant menace and the burdens entailed
upon our government by the uncertainties
and perils of the situation caused by the
unendurable disturbance in Cuba. I said:
In view of all this, the congress was
asked to authorize and empower the pres­
ident to take measures to secure a full and
final termination of hostilities between Spain
and the people of Cuba, and to secure to the
island the establishment of a stable govern­
ment, capable of maintaining order and
observing its international obligations, in­
suring peace and tranquillity, and the se­
curity of its citizens as well as our own,
and for the accomplishment of those ends
to use the military and naval forces of the
United States as might be necessary, with
added authority to continue generous re­
lief to the starving people of Cuba.
Action of Congress Approved.
The response of the congress, after nine
days' of earnest deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save
as to the expediency of coupling the pro­
posed action with a formal recognition of
the republic of Cuba as the true and lawful
government of that island—a proposition
which failed of adoption—the congress,
after conference, on the 19th of April, by
a vote of 42 to 35 in the senate and 311 to 6
in the house of representatives, passed the
memorable joint resolution, declaring:
"First. That the people of the island of
Cuba are, and of right ought to be, free
and independent.
"Second. That it is the duty of the United
States to demand and the government of
the United States does hereby demand, the
government of Spain at once relinquish its
authority and government in the island of
Cuba and withdraw its land and naval
forces from Cuba and Cuban waters.
"Third. That the president of the United
States be, and he hereby is, directed and
empowered to use the entire land and naval
forces of the United States, and to call into
the actual service of the United States
the militia of the several states, to such
extent as may be necessary to carry these
resolutions Into effect.
"Fourth. That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to
exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island except for the pacification
thereof, and asserts its determination when
that is accomplished to leatfe the govern­
ment and control of the island to its peo­
ple."
Diplomatic Relations Ended.
This resolution was approved by the ex­
ecutive on the next day, April 20. A copy
was at once communicated to the Spanish
minister at this capital, who forthwith an­
nounced that his continuance in Washing­
ton had thereby become impossible, and
asked for his passports, which were given
him. He thereupon withdrew from
Washington, leaving the protection of
Spanish interests in the United States to
the French ambassador and the Austro
Hungarian minister. Simultaneously with
its communication to the Spanish minister
Gen. Woodford, the American minister at
Madrid, was telegraphed confirmation of
the text of the joint resolution and directed
to communicate it to the government of
Spain with the formal demand that it at
once relinquish its authority and govern­
ment in the island of Cuba and withdraw
its forces therefrom, coupling this demand
with announcements of the intentions of
this government as to the future of the is­
land, in conformity with the fourth clause
of the resolution, and giving Spain until
noon of April 23 to reply.
The demand, although, as above shown,
officially made known to the Spanish envoy
here, was not delivered at Madrid. After
the instruction reached Gen. Woodford on
the morning of April 21, but before he could
present 'it, the Spanish minister of state
notified him that upon the president's ap­
proval of the joint resolution the Madrid
government, regarding the act as "equiva­
lent to an evident declaration of war," had
ordered its minister In Washington to with­
draw, thereby breaking off diplomatic re­
lations between the two countries and ceas­
ing all official communication between
their respective representatives. Gen.
Woodford therupon demanded his pass­
ports and quitted Madrid the same day.
WAR IS DECLARED.
Spain and Other Countries Notified of
Beginning of Hostilities.
Spain having thus denied the demand of
the United States and initiated that com­
plete form of rupture of relations which
attends a state of war, the executive pow­
ers authorized by the resolution were at
once used by me to meet the enlarged con­
tingency of actual war between Spain and
the United States. On April 22 I pro­
claimed a blockade of the northern coast of
Cuba, including'ports on said coast be­
tween Cardenas and Bahla Honda and the
port of Cienfucgos on the south coast of
Cuba and on the 23d I called for volun­
teers to execute the purpose of the resolu­
tion. By my message of April 25, the con­
gress was informed of the situation and I
recommended formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war between the
United States and Spain. The congress
accordingly voted on the same day the
act approved April 25, 1898, declaring the
existence of such war, from and including
the 21st day of April, and reenacted the
provision of the resolution of April 20, di­
recting the president to use all the armed
forces of the nation to carry that act into
effect. Due notification of the existence of
war as aforesaid was given April 25 by
telegraph to all the governments witn
which tne United States maintain relations,
in order that their neutrality might be as­
sured during the war. The various gov­
ernments responded with proclamations of
neutrality, each after Its own methods.
It is not among the-least gratifying inci­
dents of the struggle that the obligations
of neutrality were Impartially discharged
by all, often under delicate and difficult
circumstances.
Response to Call for Volunteers.
Our country thus, after an interval of
half a century of peace with all nations,
found Itself engaged in deadly conflict with
a foreign enemy. Every nerve was strained
to meet the emergency. The response to
the initial call for 125,000 volunteers was
instant and complete, as was also the result
of the second call of May 25 for 75,000 ad­
ditional volunteers. The ranks of the reg­
ular army were increased to the limits
provided by the act of April 26. The enlisted
force of the navy on the loth of August,
when it reached its maximum, numbered
24,123 men and apprentices. One hundred
and three vessels were added to the navy
by purchase, one was presented to the
government, one leased, and the four-ves­
sels of the International Navigation com­
pany, the St. Paul St. Louis, New York and
Paris, were chartered. In addition to these
the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders
were turned over to the navy department
and became temporarily a part or the aux
iliary r.avy.
Strength of the IVavy.
The maximum effective fighting force of
the navy during the war, separated into
classes, was as follows: Fo.ur battleships
of the flrst class one jiattleship ofr the sec­
ond class, two. armOred cruisers,.six coast
defense monitors, -one armored ram, 12
protected cruisers,
cruisers, 18 gunboats, one dynamite
cruiser. 11 torpedo boats, 14 old vessels of
the old navy, Including monitors. Auxil­
iary navy: Auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted
yachts 27 converted tugs, 19 converted col­
liers, 15 revenue cutters, four lighthouse
tenders and 19 miscellaneous vessels.
Defense of the Coast.
Much alarm was felt along our entire
Atlantic seaboard lest some attack might
be made by the enemy. Every precaution
was taken to prevent possible injury to
our great cities lying along the coast.'
Temporary garrisons were provided, drawn
from the state militia infantry and light
batteries were drawn from the volunteer
force. About 12,000 troops were thus em­
ployed. The coast signal service was es­
tablished for observing the approach of an
enemy's ships to the coast of the United
States and the life-saving and lighthouse
services cooperated, which enabled the
navy department to nave all portions of the
Atlantic coast, from Maine to Texas, under
observation. The auxiliary navy was cre­
ated under the authority of congress, and
was officered and manned by the naval
militia of the several states. This organ­
isation patrolled the coast, and performed
the duty of a second arm of defense.
Planting of Mines.
Under the direction of the chief of engi­
neers submarine mines were placed at the
most exposed points. Before the outbreak
of the war permanent mining casemates
and cable galleries had been constructed
at all important harbors. Most of the tor­
pedo material was not to be found in the
market and had to be specially manufac­
tured. Under date of April 19 district offi­
cers were directed to take all preliminary
measures, short of the actual attaching bf
the loaded mines to the cables, and on
April 22 telegraphic orders were issued to
place the loaded mlneB in position. The
aggregate number of mines placed was
1,535 at the principal harbors from Maine
to California. Preparations were also made
for the planting of mines at certain other
harbors, but owing to the early destruction
of the Spanish fleet these mines were not
placed.
The Signal Corps.
The signal corps was promptly organized
and performed service of most difficult and
important character. Its operations dur­
ing the war covered the electrical connec­
tion of all coast fortifications, the estab­
lishment of telephonic and telegraphic facil­
ities for the camps at Manila, Santiago
and in Porto Rico. There were constructed
300 miles of line at ten great camps, thus
facilitating military movements from
those points in a manner heretofore un­
known in military administration. Field
telegraph lines were established and main­
tained under the enemy's fire at Manila
and later the Manila-Hong-Kong cable was
reopened. In Porto Rico cable communi­
cations were opened over a discontinued
route, and on land the headquarters of the
commanding officer was kept in tele­
graphic or telephonic communication with
the division commanders of four different
lines of operation. There was placed in
Cuban waters a completely outfitted cable
ship with war cables and cable gear suit­
able both for the destruction of communi­
cations belonging to the enemy and the
establishment of our own. Two ocean
cables were destroyed under the enemy's
batteries at Santiago. The day previous to
the landing of Gen. Shafter's corps at Cai
manera, within 20 miles of the landing
place, cable communications were estab­
lished and cable station opened, giving di­
rect communication with the government
at Washington. This service was invalu­
able to the executive in directing the opera­
tions of the army and navy.
With a total force of over 1,300, the loss
was, by disease in camp and field, officers
and men included, only five.
War Revenues.
The national defense under the $50,000,000
fund was expended in large part by the
army and navy and the objects for which
it was used are fully shown in the reports
of the several secretaries. It was a most
timely appropriation, enabling the govern­
ment to strengthen its defense and making
preparations greatly needed in case of war.
This fund being inadequate to the require­
ments of equipment and for the conduct of
the war, the patriotism of the congress pro­
vided the means in the war revenue act of
June 13, by authorizing a three per cent,
popular loan not to exceed $400,000,000 and
by levying additional imposts and taxes.
Of the authorized loan, $200,000,000 were of­
fered and promptly taken, the subscrip­
tions so far exceeding the call as to cover
it many times over, while, preference be­
ing given to the smaller bids, no single allot­
ment exceeded $5,000. This was a most en­
couraging and significant result, showing
the vast resources of the nation and the
determination of the people to uphold their
country's honor.
BRIEF HISTORY OF THE WAR.
Leading Engagements and Thrilling
Achievements Recounted.
It is not within the province of this mes­
sage to narrate the history of the ex­
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21, but a brief recital
of its more salient features is appropriate.
The first encounter of the war in point of
date took place April 27, when a detach­
ment of the blockading squadron made a
reconnoissance in force at Matanzas,
shelled the harbor forts and demolished
several new works in construction.
Dewey's Victory.
The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch In maritime war­
fare. The Pacific .fleet, under Commodore
George Dewey, had lain for some weeks at
Hong-Kong. Upon the colonial proclama­
tion of neutrality being issued and the
customary 24 hours' notice being given, it
repaired to Mirs bay, near Hong-Kong,
whence it proceeded to the Philippine Is­
lands under telegraphic orders to capture
or destroy the formidable Spanish fleet then
assembled at Manila. At daybreak on the
1st of May the American force entered Ma­
nila bay and after a few hours' engage­
ment effected the total destruction of the
Spanish fleet, consisting of ten warships
and a transport, besides capturing the
naval station and forts at Cavlte, thus an­
nihilating the Spanish power in the Pacific
ocean and completely controlling the Bay
of Manila, with the ability to take the city
at will. Not a life was lest on our ships,
the wounded only, numbering seven, while
not" a vessel was materially injured. For
this gallant achievement the congress, up­
on my recommendation, fitly bestowed up­
on theactors present permanent and sub­
stantial reward.
The effect of this remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon the
fortunes of the war was Instant. A pres­
tige of Invincibility thereby attached to
our arms, which continued throughout the
struggle. Reenforcements were hurried to
Manila under the command of Maj. Gen.
Merrltt, and flrmly established within sight
of the capital, which lay helpless before
our guns. On the seventh day of May the
government was advised officially of the
victory of Manila, and at once inquired of
the commander of our fleet what troops
would be required. The information was
received on tne. 15th of May, and the flrst
army expedition sailed May 25, and ar­
rived off Manila June 30. Other expeditions
soon followed, the total force consisting
of 641 officers and 15,058 men.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack powerful forces were as­
sembled at various points on our coast to
Invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at several
exposed points. On May 11, the cruiser
Wilmington and torpedo boat Winslow
were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence
the batteries at Cardenas, against Matan­
zas, Worth Bagley and four seamen fall­
ing. These grievous fatalities were strange­
ly enough among the very few which oc­
curred during our naval operations in this
extraordinary conflict.
Advance of Cervera's Fleet.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor. A
powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera,
which had assembled at the Cape Verde
islands before the outbreak of hostilities,
had crossed the ocean and by its erratic
movements in the Caribbean sea- delayed
our military operations while baffling the
pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were
felt lest the Oregon and Marietta then
nearing home after their long voyage from
San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might
be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet
but their fortunate arrival dispelled these
apprehensions and lent much needed reen­
forcements. Not until Admiral Cervera
took refuge in the harbor of Santiago de
Cuba about May 9 was it-practicable to
plan a systematic military attack upon the
Anjtlllean possessions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occurred on the
coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico In prepara­
tion for the larger event. On May 13 the
North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan
de Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodore
Schley's squadron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.
Neither attack had any material result. It
.was.evident, that well-ordered land opera­
tions Were Indispensable to achieve a de­
cisive advantage.
Hobson's Band of Heroes.
The next act In the war thrilled not alone
the hearts of our countrymen but the world
by. its exceptional heroism. On the night
of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven
devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow
outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the
collier Merrlmac in the channel,, under a
fierce fire from .the shore batteries, escap­
ing with their lives as by a miracle, but
falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It
is a most gratifying incident of the war
that the bravery of this little band of
heroes was cordially appreciated by the
Spaniards, who sent a flag of truce.to notify
Admiral Sampson of their safety and to
compliment them on their daring act. They
were .subsequently exchanged July 7.
Fall of Gnaatanamb.
By June .7 the (hitting of the lant Cuban
cable isolated the Island.'Thereafter the
-invasion was.vlgorOusfy prosecuted. On
June 10, under a heavy protecting. Are, a
three -unprotected Iandin^of 600 marines, from the Oregon,
"IT"
Marblehead and Yankee was effected in
Guantanamo bay, where it had been deter­
mined to establish a naval station. This
important and essential -port was taken
from the enemy after severe fighting by
the marines, who were the flrst organized
force of the United States to land In Cuba.
The position so won was held, despite des
lerate attempts to dislodge our forces. By
une 16 additional forces were landed and
strongly Intrenched. On June 22 the ad­
vance of the invading army under Maj.
Gen. Shatter landed at Baiqulrl, about 15
miles east of Santiago. This was accom­
plished under great difficulties, but with
marvelous dispatch.
THE SANTIAGO. CAMPAIGN.
Its Successful Issue Gave Us the En­
tire Eastern End of Cuba.
On June 23 the movement against San­
tiago was begun. On the 24th the first se­
rious engagement took plice, in which the
First and Tenth cavalry and the First
United States volunteer cavalry. Gen.
Young's brigade of Gen. Wheeler's division,
participated, losing heavily. By nightfall,
however, ground within five miles of San­
tiago was won. The advantage was stead­
ily increased. On July 1, a severe battle
took place, our forces gaining the out­
works of Santiago on the second El Caney
and San Juan were taken after a desperate
charge, and the investment of the city was
completed. The navy cooperated by shell­
ing the town and the coast forts.
Sinking of the Spanish fleet.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3,
occurred. the decisive naval combat of the
war. The Spanish fleet," attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the American
squadron under command of Commodore
Sampson. In less than three hours all the
Spanish ships were destroyed, the two
torpedo boats being sunk, and ihe Maria
Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya and
Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span­
ish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken
prisoners, while the enemy's loss was de­
plorably large, some 600 perishing. On
our side but one man was killed, on the
Brooklyn, and one man was seriously
wounded. Although our ships were re­
peatedly struck, not one was seriously in­
jured. Where all so conspicuously dis­
tinguished themselves, from the command­
ers to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms, each and all contribut­
ing toward the achievement of this as­
tounding victory, for which neither an­
cient nor modern history affords a parallel
in the completeness of the event and the
marvelous disproportion of casualties, it
would be invidious to single out any for
especial honor. Deserved promotion has
rewarded the more conspicuous actors—the
nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all
of those brave men who by their skill and
devotion in a few short hours crushed tlje
sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph
whose decisiveness and far-reaching con­
sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor
can we be unmindful of the achievements
of our builders, mechanics, and artisans
for their skill in the construction of our
warships.
With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's
effort upon the ocean virtually ceased. A
spasmodic effort toward the end of June,
to send her Mediterranean fleet under Ad­
miral Camara to relieve Manila was
abandoned, the expedition being recalled
after it had passed through the Suez
canal.
Capture of Santiago.
The capitulation of Santiago followed.
The city was closely besieged by land, while
the entrance of our ships into the harbor
cut off all relief on that side. After a truce
to allow of the removal of noncombatants
protracted negotiations continued from
July 3 until July 15, when, under menace
of immediate assault the preliminaries" of
surrender were agreed upon. Oh the 17th
Gen. Shafter occupied the city. The capitu­
lation embraced the entire eastern end of
Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers sur­
rendered was 22,000, all ot whom were sub­
sequently conveyed to Spain at the charge
of the United States.
Gratitude of the Nation.
The story of this successful campaign is
told in the report of the secretary of war
which will be laid before you. The Indi­
vidual valor of officers and soldiers wa%
never more strikingly shown than in the
several engagements leading to the sur­
render of Santiago, while the prompt move­
ments and successive victories won instant
and universal applause. To those who
gained this complete triumph, \thich estab­
lished the ascendency of the United States
upon land as the fight off Santiago had fixed
our supremacy on the seas, the earnest and
l&stlrig gratitude of the nation is unspar­
ingly due. Nor should we aloni remember
the gallantry of the living the'dead claim
our tears, and our losses by battle and dis­
ease must cldud any exultatloh at the re­
sult and teach us to weigh, the awful cost
of war, however rightful the cause or sig­
nal the victory.
MILES AT PORTO RICO.
A Brief History of the Expedition
to That Island.
With the fall of Santiago, the occupation
of Porto Rico became the next strategic
necessity. Gen. Miles had previously beer,
assigned to organize an expedition for that
purpose. Fortunately he was already at
Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th
of July, with reenforcements for .Gen.
Shafter's army. With these troops, consist­
ing of 3,415 Infantry and artillery, two com­
panies of engineers and one company of
the signal corps, Gen. Miles left Guantana­
mo on July 21, having nine transports con­
voyed by the fleet under Capt. Higginson,
With the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie,
Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, the two
latter carrying troops. The expedition
landed at Guanica July 25, which port was
fentered with little opposition. Here the
fleet was joined by tne Annapolis and the
Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphitrite
went to San Juan and joined the New Or­
leans, which was engaged In blockading
that port. The major general commanding
was subsequently reenforced by Gen.
Schwann's brigade of the Third army
corps, by Gen. Wilson, with a part of his
division, and also by Gen. Brooke, with a
part of his corps, numbering in all 16,973 of­
ficers and men. On July 27 he entered
Ponce, one of ,the most Important ports in
the Island, from which he thereafter di­
rected operations for the capture of the
island.
With the exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hermlguerez,
Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a force
landed at Cape San Juan, there was no se­
rious resistance. The campaign was prose­
cuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of
August much of the Island was in our pos
lesslonand the acquisition of the remainder
vas only a matter of a short time. At
nost of the points in the island our troops
vere enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta
ions of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for
lelivery from Spanish rule met our com­
manders at every stage. As a potent in­
fluence toward peace, the outcome of the
Porto Rican expedition was of great con­
sequence, and generous commendation is
due to those who participated in it.
Fall of Manila.
The last scene of the war was enacted at
Manila, its starting place. On August 15,
after a brief assault upon the works by the
land forces, in which tne squadron assisted,
the capital surrendered unconditionally,
ffhe casualties were comparatively few.
By this conquest of the Phillipplne islands,
virtually accomplished when the Spanish
apacity for resistance was destroyed by
Ldmiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of
lay, was formally sealed. To Gen. Mer
itt, his officers and men for their uncom
laining and devoted services for their gal
mtry in action, the nation is sincerely
fateful. Their long voyage was made
rith singular success, and the soldierly
bnduct of the men, most of whom were
nthout previous experience in the military
rvice, deserves unmeasured praise.
Our Losses..
The total casualties In killed and wounded
if the army during the war was as follows:
fficers killed, 23: enlisted men killed, 257
tal, 280 officers wounded, 113 enlisted
ten wounded, 1,464 total, 1,577. Of the
lavy: Killed, 17 wounded, $7 died as result
of wounds, 1 invalided from service, 6
total, 91. It will be observed that while our
navy was engaged in two great battles and
in numerous perilous undertakings in the
blockades and bombardment and more
than 50,000 of our troops were transported
to distant lands and engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skirmishes
in unfamiliar territory, we lost In both
arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and
wounded and In the entire campaign by
land and sea we did not lose a gun or a
flag or a transport or a ship, and with the
exception of the crew of the Merrlmac, not
soldier or sailor was taken prisoner.
Troops Return.
On August 7. 46 days from the date of the
landing of Gen. Shafter's army in Cuba,
md 21 days from the surrender of Santiago,
:he United States troops commenced em
arkation for home and our entire force
va? returned to the United States as early
is August 24. They were absent from the
Jnited States only two months.
Tribute to Patriotism.
It is fitting that I should bear testimony
the patriotism and devotion of that
irge portion of our army which, although
ager to be ordered to the post of greatest
xposure, fortunately was not required out
!de of the United States. They did their
•hole duty, and like their comrades at fhe
ront, have earned the gratitude of the
ation. In like manner, the officers and
ten, of the army and of the navy who re­
gained in their departments and stations
I the navy, performing most important
fities connected with the war. and whose
'quests for asignment in the field and at
la it was .compelled to. .refuse because
telr services were indispensable here, are
Intltled to the highest commendation. It
[s my regret that there seems to be no pro
"Islon for their suitable recognition.
Worlc of the Red Cross.
In this connection, it is a pleasure for
me to mention in terms of cordial appre­
ciation the timely and useful work of the
American National Red Cross, both in re­
lief measures preparatory to the campaign,
in sanitary assistance at several of the
camps of assemblage and later, under the
able and experienced leadership of the
president of the society. Miss Clara Bar­
ton, on the fields of battle and in the hos­
pitals at the front In Cuba.
PEACE OVERTURES.
Spain Talces Steps to Bring About
Close of the War.
The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's
fleet, followed by the capitulation of San­
tiago, having brought to the Spanish gov­
ernment a realising sense of the hopeless­
ness of continuing
a struggle now becoming
wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace
through the French ambassador, who with
the assent of his government, had acted as
the friendly representative of Spanish In­
terests during the war. On the 26th of July,
M. Cambon presented a communication
signed by the duke of Almodovar, the Span­
ish minister of state, inviting the United
States to state the terms upon which it
would be willing to make peace. On July
30, by a communication addressed to the
duke of Almodovar and handed to M. Cam­
bon, the terras of this government were an­
nounced, substantially as the protocol,
afterwards signed. On August 10, the Span­
ish reply, dated August 7, was handed by
M. Cambon to the secretary of state. It ac­
cepted unconditionally the terms Imposed
as to Cuba, -Porto Rico and an island of the
La drones group, but appeared to seek to
introduce inadmissible reservations In re­
gard to our demand as to the Philippines.
Conceiving that discussion on this point
cculd neither be practicable or profitable, I
directed that in order to avoid misunder­
standing the matter should be forthwith
closed by proposing the embodiment in a
formal protocol of the terms in which the
negotiations for peace were to be under­
taken. The vague and inexplicit sugges­
tions of the Spanish note could not be ac­
cepted, the only reply being to present as a
virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol em­
bodying the precise terms tendered to
Spain in our note of July 30, with added
stipulations of detail as to the appoint­
ment of commissioners to arrange for the
evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On
August 12 M. Cambon announced his re­
ceipt of full powers to sign the protocol
so submitted. Accordingly, on the after­
noon of August 12, M. Cambon, as the
plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secre­
tary of state, as the plenipotentiary of the
United States, signed a protocol, provid­
ing:
The Protocol.
"Article 1. Spain will relinquish all claim
of sovereignty over and title to Cuba.
"Article 2. Spain will cede the United
States the island of Porto Rico and other
islands now under Spanish sovereignty in
the West Indies, and also an island in the
Ladrones, to be selected by the United
States.
"Article 3. The United States will oc­
cupy and hold the city, bay and harbor of
Manila pending the conclusion of a treaty
of peace which shall determine the con­
trol, disposition and government of the
Philippines."
The fourth article provided for the ap­
pointment of joint commissions on the part
of the United States and Spain to meet in
Havana and San Juan, respectively, for
the purpose of arranging and carrying out
the details of the stipulated evacuation of
Cuba, Porto Rico and other Spanish Is­
lands in the West Indies.
The fifth article provided for the ap­
pointment of not more than five commis­
sioners on each side, to meet at Paris not
later than October 1, and to proceed to
the negotiations and conclusions of a
treaty of peace, subject to ratification ac­
cording to the respective constitutional
forms of the two countries.
The sixth and last article provided that
upon the signature of the protocol hos­
tilities between the two countries should be
suspended, and that notice to that effect
should be given as soon as possible by
each government to the commanders of its
military and naval forces.
Hostilities Suspended.
Immediately upon the conclusion of the
protocol I Issued a proclamation of August
12, suspending hostilities on the part of the
United States. The necessary orders to
that end were at once given by telegraph.
The blockade of the ports of Cuba and San
Juan de Porto Rico was in like manner
raised. On August 18 the muster out of
100,000 volunteers, or as near that number
as was found to be practicable, was or­
dered. On December 1 101,165 officers an!
men had been mustered out and discharged
from the service, 9,002 more will be mus­
tered out by the 10th of the month. Also
a corresponding number of generals and
general staff officers have been honorably
discharged from the service.
Peace Commission Named.
Pursuant to the fifth article of the
firotocol, I appointed William R. Day,
ately secretary of state Cushman K.
Davis, William P. Frye and George Gray,
senators of the United States, and White
law Reid to be the peace commissioners on
the part of the United States. Proceed­
ing in due season to Paris, they there met.
on the 1st of October five commissioners
similarly appointed on the part of Spain.
The negotiations have made hopeful prog­
ress, so that I trust soon to be able to
lay a definitive treaty of peace before the
senate, with a review of the steps leading
to its signature.
OUR NEW POSSESSIONS.
Discussion of Their Future Govern­
ment la Deferred.
I do not discuss at this time the govern­
ment or the future of the new possessions
which will come to us as the result of the
war with Spain. Such discussion will be ap­
propriate after the treaty of peace shall be
ratified. In the meantime and until the
congress has legislated otherwise, it will
be my duty to continue the military gov­
ernments which have existed since our oc­
cupation and guarantee the people se­
curity In life and property and encourage­
ment under a just and beneficent rule. As
soon, as we are in possession of Cuba and
have pacified the island,'It will be necessary
to give aid and direction to its people to form
a government for themselves. This should
be undertaken at the earliest moment con­
sistent with safety and assured success. It
is Important that our relations with these
people shall be of the most friendly char­
acter and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist In every proper way to build up the
waste places of the Island, encourage the
Industry of the people and assist them to
form a government which shall be free and
independent, thus realizing the best as­
pirations of the Cuban people. Spanish
rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent
and humane government, created by the
people of Cuba, capable of performing all
International obligations and which shall
encourage thrift. Industry and prosperity,
whatever may have been their will among
all of the inhabitants, whatever may have
been their relations in the past. Neither
ievcnge nor passion should have a place in
the new government. Until there is com­
plete tranquillity in the island and a stable
government inaugurated military occupa­
tion will be continued.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Aside from the War with Spain They
Are Very Cordial.
With the exception of the rupture with
Spain, the intercourse of the United States
with the great family of nations has been
marked with cordiality and the close of the
eventful year finds most of the issues that
necessarily arise In the complex relations
of sovereign states adjusted or presenting
no serious obstacle to ajust and honorable
solution by amicable agreement.
A long unsettled dispute as to the ex­
tended boundary between the Argentine
Republic and Chill, stretching along the
Andean crests from the southern border of
the Atacama desert to Magellan straits,
nearly a third of the length of the South
American continent, assumed an acute
stage in the early part of the year and af­
forded to this government occasion to ex­
press the hope that the resort to arbitra­
tion, already contemplated by existing con­
ventions between theparties, might prevail
despite the grave difficulties arising In its
application. I am happy to say that ar­
rangements to this end have been perfect­
ed, the questions of fact, upon which the
respective commissioners were unable to
agree, being in course of reference to her
Britannic majesty for determination. "A
residual difference touching the northern
boundary line across the Atacama desert,
for which existing treaties provided no
adequate adjustment, bids fair to be set­
tled In like manner by joint commission,
upon which the United States minister at
Buenos Ayrea has been invited to serve as
umpire in the last resort.
I have found occasion to approach the
Argentine government with a view to re­
moving differences of rate charges Im­
posed upon the cables of ar. American cor­
poration in the transmission between
Buenos Ayres and the cities of Uruguay
and Brazil of through messages passing
from and to the United States. Although
the matter la' complicated by exclusive con­
cessions by Uruguay and Brazil to foreign
companies, there Is strong hope that a good
understanding will be reached and that the
important channels of commercial commu­
nication between the United States and the
Atlantic -cities of South America may be
freed from an almost prohibitory discrim­
ination.
In this relation I may be permitted to ex­
press my sense of the fitness of an In­
ternational agreement whereby the inter­
change of messages over connecting cables
may be regulated on a fair basis of uni­
formity. The world has seen the postal
system developed from a congeries inde­
pendent and exclusive service into a wet*
ordered union, of which all countries found
the manifold benefits. It would be strange
were the nations not in time brought to
realize that modern civilization, which
owes so much of its progress to the anni­
hilation of space by the electric force, de­
mands that this all-important means of
communication, a heritage of all peoples,
to be administered and regulated in their
common behoof. A step in this direction
was taken when the international conven­
tion of 1884, for the protection of subma­
rine cables was signed, and the day is, I
trust, not far distant when this medium for
the transmission of thought from land to
•and may be brought within the domain
of International concert as completely as
is the material carriage of commerce and
correspondence upon the face of the waters
that divide them.
The claim of Thomas Jefferson Page
against Argentina, which has been pend­
ing many years, has been adjusted. The
sum awarded by the congress of Argen­
tina was 14,242.35.
Austria-Hungary.
The sympathy of the American people
has justly been offered to the ruler and
the people of Austria-Hungary by reason
of the affliction that has lately befailen
them in the assassination of the empress
queen of that historic realm.
On the 10th of September, 1897, a con­
flict took place at Lattimer, Pa., between
a body of striking miners and the sheriff
of Luzerne county and his deputies, in
which 22 miners were killed and 44 wounded,
of which 10 of the killed and 12 of the
wounded were Austrian and Hungarian
subjects. This deplorable event naturally
aroused the solicitude of the Austro-Hun
garian government, which, on the assump­
tion that the killing and wounding involved
the unjustifiable misuse of authority,
claimed reparation for the sufferers.
Apart from the searching investigation
and the peremptory action of the authori­
ties of Pennsylvania, the federal execu­
tive took appropriate steps to learn the
merits of the case in order to be in a po­
sition to meet the urgent complaint of a
friendly power. The sheriff and his dep­
uties, having been indicted for murder,
were tried and acquitted after protracted
proceedings and the hearing of hundreds
of witnesses, on the ground that the kill­
ing was In the line of their official duty to
uphold law and preserve public order in
the state. A representative of the de­
partment of justice attended the trials, re­
porting its course fully. With all the facts
In its possession, this government expects
to reach a harmonious understanding on
the subject with that of Austria-Hungary,
notwithstanding the renewed claim of the
latter, after learning the result of the trial,
for indemnity for Its injured subjects.
International Expositions.
Despite the brief time allotted for prep­
aration, the exhibits of this country at the
Universal exposition at Brussels in 1897,
enjoyed the singular distinction of a larger
proportion of awards, having regard to
the number and classes of articles entered,
than those of other countries. The worth
of such a result in making known our na­
tional capacity to supply the world's mar­
kets is obvious. Exhibitions of this inter­
national character are becoming more fre­
quent as the exchange of commercial coun­
tries grows more intimate and varied.
Hardly a year passes that this government
is not invited to national participation at
some Important foreign center, but often
on too short notice to permit of recourse
to congress for the power and means to do
so. My predecessors have suggested the
advisability of providing, by a general en­
actment and a standing appropriation, for
accepting such invitations and for repre­
sentation of this country by a commission.
This plan has my cordial approval.
Central American Affair*.
The year events In Central America de­
serve more than passing mention. A
menacing rupture between Costa Rica and
Nicaragua was happily composed by the
signature of a convention between the
parties with the concurrence of the Guata
malan representative as a mediator, the
act being negotiated and signed on board
the United States steamer Alert, then ly­
ing in Central American waters. It is be­
lieved that the good offices of our envoy
and commander of that vessel contributed
toward this gratifying outcome.
In my last annual message the situation
was presented with respect to the diplo­
matic representation of this government
in Central America, created by the asso­
ciation of Nicaragua, Honduras and Salva­
dor under the title of the Greater Republic
of Central America and the delegation of
their International functions to the diet
thereof. While the representative char­
acter of the diet was recognized by my
predecessor and has been confirmed during
my administration by receiving its ac­
credited envoy and granting exquators to
consuls commissioned under its authority,
that recognition was qualified by the dis­
tinct understanding that the responsibility
of each of the component sovereign re­
publics toward the United States remained
wholly unaffected. This proviso was need­
ful Inasmuch as the compact of the three
republics was at the outset an association
whereby certain representative functions
were delegated to a tripartite commission,
rather than a federation possessing cen­
tralized powers of government and admin­
istration. In this view of their relation and
tne relation of the United States to sev­
eral republics, a change in the representa­
tion of this country in Central America
was neither recommended by the executive
nor initiated by congress thus leaving one
of our envoys accredited as heretofore sep­
arately to two states of the greater re­
public, Nicaragua and Salvador, and to a
third state, Costa Itica, which was not a
party to the compact, while onr other en­
voy was similarly accredited to the union
stated as Honduras and a non-union stated
as Guatemala. The result has been tnat
the one has presented credentials only to
the president of Costa Rica, the other hav­
ing been received only by the government
of Guatemala.
Subsequently the three associated repub­
lics entered into negotiations for maicing
the steps forecast in the original compact.
A convention of their delegates framed for
them a federal constitution under the name
of the United States of Central America
and provided for a central federal govern­
ment and legislature. Upon ratification by
the constituent states the 1st of November
last was fixed for the new system to go
Into operation. Within a few weeks there­
after the plan was severely tested by revo­
lutionary movements arising, with a con­
sequent demand for unity of action on the
part of the military power of the federal
states to suppress them. Under this strain
the new union seems to have been weak­
ened through the withdrawal of its more
Important members. This government was
not officially advised of the installation of
the federation, and has maintained an at­
titude of friendly expectancy, white in no
wise relinquishing the position held from
the outset that the responsibilities of the
several states toward us remained unal­
tered by their tentative relations amorg
themselves.
NICARAGUA* CANAL.
Some Definite Action on the Sufrfeel
Is Urged.
The Nicaraugua canal commission, under
the championship of Rear Admiral John G.
Walker, appointed July 24, 1SS7. under the
authority of a provision in the sur.diy civil
act of June 4 of thai year has near­
ly completed its labors, and the results of
its exhaustive inquiry into the proper
route, the feasibility and the cost of con­
struction of an interoceanic canal by a Nic
araguan route will be laid before you. In
the performance of it3 task the commission
received all possible courtesy and ass'st
ance from the governments of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica, which thus testified their
appreciation of the importance of giving a
speedy and practical outcome to the great
project that has for so many years en­
grossed the attention of the respective
countries.
As the scope of recent inquiry embraced
the whole subject, with the aim of making
plans and surveys for a canal by the most
convenient route, it necessarily Included a
review of the results of previous surveys
and plans, and In particular those adopted
by the Maritime Canal company under It*
existing concessions from Nicaragua and
Costa Rica, so that to this extent those
grants necessarily held an essential part
in the deliberations and conclusions of tne
canal commission as they have held and
must needs hold in the discussion of the
matter by the congress. Under these cir­
cumstances and in view of overtures made
to the governments of Nicaragua and
Costa Rica by other parties for a new
canal concession predicted on tne as­
sumed approaching lapse of the contracts
of the Maritime Canal company with those
states, I have not hesitated to express my
conviction that considerations or expedi­
ency and international policy, as between
the several governments interested In the
construction and control of an inter
oceanic canal by this rorfte reqa&re the
maintenance of the status quo, until the
canal commission shall have reported and
the United States congress shall have had
the opportunity to pass Anally open the
whole matter during the present session,
without prejudice by reason of any change
in the existing conditions.
Nevertheless it appears that the govern­
ment of Nicaragua, as one of Its last sover­
eign acts (before merging its powers in
those of the newly-formed United States
of Central America, has granted an option­
al concession to another association, to be­
come effective on the expiration of the
present grant. It does not appear what
surveys have been made, or what route is
proposed under this contingent granted, so
that an examination of the feasibility of
its plans is necessarily not embraced in the
report of the canal commission. All these
circumstances suggest the urgency of
some definite action by the congress at
thi» session, if the labors of the past are to
be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans by a practical water­
way is to be realized. That the construc­
tion ot such a maritime highway f» aow

The United States has not been an in­
different spectator of the extraordinary
events transpiring hi the Chinese empireT
whereby portions, of its maritime prov­
inces are passing under the control ofvarf
ons European powers but the prospect
that the vast commerce which the energy
of our citizens and the necessity of our
staple prodactions for Chinese nses bag"
built up in those regions may not be preju­
diced through any exclusive treatment by
the new occunants has obviated the need
of our country becoming an actor in the
scene. Our position among nations, having
a large Pacific coast and a constantly ex­
panding direct trade with the farther
orient, gives ns the equitable claim to con­
sideration and friendly treatment in this
regard, and it will be my aim to subserve
our large interests in that quarter by all
means appropriate to the constant policy of
our government. The territories of Kiae
Chow, of Wei-Ha:-Wei, and of Port Arthur
and Talien Wan, leased to Germany, Great
Britain and Russia respectively for terms
of years, will, it is announced, be open to
international commerce during such alien
occupation: and if no discriminating treat­
ment of American citizens and their trade
be found to exist, or be hereafter developed,
the desire of this government would appear
to he realized.
In this relation, as showing the volume
and value of our exchanges with China and
the peculiarly favorable conditions which
exist for their expansion in the norma:
course of trade, I refer to the communica­
tion addressed to the speaker of the house
of representatives by tne secretary of the
treasury on the Mth of last June, with its
accompanying letter of the secretary of
state, recommending an appropriation for
a commission to study the commercial and
industrial conditions in the Chinese em­
pire and report as to the opportunities for
and obstacles to the enlargement of mar­
kets in China for the raw products and
manufactures of the United States. Ac­
tion was not taken thereon during the
late session. I cordially urge that the rec­
ommendation receive at your hands the
consideration which its importance and
timeliness merit.
THE PARIS EirmrmM.
At If We Will Occupy a Pnaiaral
Place Amwag the 9stiMa
There is now every prospect that the
participation of the United States in the
universal exposition to be held in Paris in
1900 will he on a scale commensurate with
the advanced position held by our products
ar.d indnstrles in the world's chief marts.
The preliminary report of Moses P. Handy,
who under the act approved July IS. 1S9T,
was appointed special commissioner, with
a view to securing all attainable informa­
tion necessary to a full and complete under­
standing by congress in regard to the par­
ticipation of this government in the Paris
exposition, was laid before you by my oes
sage of December 6. 1897. and showed the
large opportunities opened to make known
ur national progress in arts, science and
manufactures, as well as the urgent need
of immediate and adequate provision to
enable doe advantage thereof to be taken.
Mr. Handy's death soon afterwards ren­
dered it necessary for another to take np
and complete his unfinished work, and on
January last Mr. Thomas W. Crfdler,
third assistant secretary of state, was des­
ignated to fulfill that task. His report was
laid before you by my message of June 14,
1898, with the gratifying result of awaken­
ing renewed interest in the projected dis­
play. By a provision In the sundry enrtl
appropriation act of July 1. IS98. a sua* oaf
to exceed 9&MM9 was allotted for the or­
ganization of a commission to care for the
proper preparation and installation of
American exhibits, and for the display of
suitable exhibits by the several exec wise
departments, particularly by the depart­
ment of agriculture, the fish
and the Smiths

and the Smithsonian Institution, in t#

Pursuant to that enactment I appointed
Mr. Ferdinand W Peck, of Chicago, com­
missioner-general with an assistant com­
missioner-general and secretary. Mr. Peck
at once proceeded to Paris, where his suc­
cess in enlarging the scope and variety of
the United States exhbit has been most
gratifying. Notwithstanding the compar­
atively limited area of the exposition -ite
—iess than one-half of the world's fair at
Chicago—the space assigned to the United
States has been increased from the abso­
lute allotment of 1S7.M square feet re­
ported by Mr. Handy to some 2BZ.00Ssquare
feet, with corresponding augmentation of
the field for a truly characteristic represen­
tation of the various important branches
of our country's development. Mr. Peck's
report will be laid before yon. In my judg­
ment its recommendations will can for
your early consideration, especially as re­
gards an Increase of the appropriation to
at least 51.100.960 in ail. so that not o^y
may the assigned space be fully taken up
by the best possible exhibitor in every
class, hut the preparation and installa­
tion be on so perfect a scale as to rarfc
among the first in that unparalleled com­
petition of artistic and inventive produc­
tion and »hus counterbalance the disadvan­
tage with which we start, as compared with
other countries whose appropriations are
on a more generous scale and whose prep­
arations are in a state of much greater for­
wardness than our own.
Where our artisans have the adoritted
capacity to excel, where oor inventive
genius has initiated many of the grandest
discoveries of these later days of he cen­
tury and where the native resources of
our land are as limitless as they are vat
nable to supply the world's needs, it is our
province, as it should be oor earnest care,
to lead In the march of homsn progress*
and not rest content with any secondary
place. Moreover, if this be doe to our­
selves. it Is no less due to the great French
nation whose guests we become and which
has in many ways testified its wishes and
hope that oor participation ?hall befit the
place the two peoples have won In the Held
of universal development.
The commercial arrangement made with
France on May 28. 1898. ender the provi­
sions of section three of the tariff act «f
1897, went into effect on June 1. following.
It has relieved a portion of wr export
trade from serious embarrassment. FuP
ther negotiations are now pending under
section four of the same act. with a view
to the increase of trade between the two
countries to their mutnal advantage. Se
gotiations with other governments!, in part
Interrupted by the war with Spain, are in
progress under both sections of the tariff
act. I hope to be a We to announce some of
the results of these negotiation* during
the present .session of congress.

effort has been relaxed to twulwe the im­
perial government of the ffmi minhni in ur

tation, and it is trusted that the tillcient ad­
ministration of this measure by the depart­
ment of agriculture will be recognised as a
guarantee of the healthfutnens of the food
staples we send abroad to countries where
their use is large and necessary. I trans­
