Chicago, Dec. 16. Charging that
the Central Freight Association is a
combination in restraint of trade, the
Chicago Board of Trade will ask the
Interstate commerce commission to
compel the eastern railroads to make
what the board deems fair rat3 on
grain shipments from the Missouri
river via Chicago to the seaboard. It
is desired that the rates conform to
those on similar shipments via St
Louis. .
The board will set forth that the
Clover Leaf line recently reduced its
corn rate from St. Louis to Toledo
from seven cents1 to five cents, mat
ing the domestic rate from Omaha
and Kansas City via St. Louis. to the
sea board 18 c, while shipments by
the way of . Chicago cost 20. The
Board asserts it has repeatedly ap
pealed to the eastern railroads to
unite with the western lines in mak
ing a corresponding Chicago reduc
tion but that such requests have been
refused. Some of the smaller systems
it is added, would comply but for the
fact that they fear to make rates un
approved by the Central Freight As
sociation, which is alleged to be
dominated by the Pennsylvania and
New York Central two systems de
clared by the Board to be habitually
unfriendly to Chicago.

SEVEN CANDIDATES GIVEN SEC
OND AND THIRD DEGREES
NEW QUARTERS ARE SPLENDID
IN THEIR FURNISHINGS.
Amidst scenes of great festivity, the
Richmond Grove of Druids yesterday
dedicated their new quarters on Main
street between Fourth and Fifth. In
addition to the grand officers of the
lodge, fifty members of the Capital
Degree Team of Indianapolis, were
present yesterday afternoon when
seven Richmond men were initiatei
into the mysteries of the second and
third degrees of Druldlsm. The In
dianapolis degree team had charge
of the work, and although the local
team is reputed to be one of the lead
ing teams of the kind in Druids cir
cles, the Indianapolis team proved' by
far the best that had ever made it3
appearance in the local Druid's hall
in this city.
Saturday night a grand ball was
given in the Druid's hall, while yester
day morning the visiting delegates
were shown about the city. YesteV
day afternoon the work in the two ds
grees was given whilo last night's so
cial time amply held up the Richmond
men as entertainers of the highest
order.
The Druids now have one of the
most handsomely furnished halls
devoted solely to lodge purposes, in
the city.
The grand officers who were pres
ent at yesterday's initiation and festi
vites were. Grand Noble Arch, of In
diana; Col. Rucklehouse, of Indiana
polis; Grand Secretary, Charles Glider
of Indianapolis.
Adam Weber, the Grand Secretary
for the. state of Ohio, was also pres
ent. Other than the Indianapolis Grove
of Druids. . the -arious lodges sur
rounding Richmond did not send rep
resentatives in the meeting.

Uuless Judge Fox should still be
unable to attend court today, the
Kroma case will be resumed. The
jury was ordered to report at 9
o'clock this morning as were all wit
nesses. The delay, which was alto
gether unavoidable, has it is assert
ed, done the State no particular good.
Andy Lutz, the prosecuting witness,
told his story of the assault made up
on him by Kroma and L..S compan
ions, during the first -session of the
hearing and as this will be the most
important testimony the State
will !
present, the jury must therefore re
tain the impression made during the
several days delay. .Getting evidence
by "installments" Is not desired in
jury trials by attorneys. If Judge
Fox Is in attendance today the case
will be pushed as fast as possible.

Advertising Record.
The Palladium yesterday
carried the record amount of
advertising for any Richmond
newspaper so far this year. In
all 925 inches of paid advertis
ing were carried. This is one
inch over 42 columns, or six
pages. Of yesterday's twelve
page issue, therefore, six
pages were advertising and
six pages were straight news
matter and the serial story.
This great volumn of advertis
ing is a compliment to the Pal
ladium subscribers. It means
that the merchants of Rich
mond realize that the Palla
dium's circulation comprises
first class and discriminating
subscribers; those who read
the advertisements and take
advantage of the suggestions
and bargains they offer.

SUBJECTS. "T" T...
The series of three institutes to be
given by the farmers of Wayne
county, under the auspices of the
School of Agriculture of Purdue Uni
versity, have been arranged and the
programs have been prepared.
The first institute will be held at

church. The second institute will be
held at Williamsburg on January 4
and 5 in the Friends' church and the
third institute will take place at
Bethel on January 9, in the Christian
church. The arrangements this year
is considered superior to that of for
mer years, as three institutes in
three sections of the county will give
the farming classes opportunitv to
avail themselves of the opportunity
presented. The programs this year
are unusually attractive, embracing
a varied line of subjects, all of value
to the agriculturist. The programs

Rome, Dec. 16. As a result of the
intense feeling that has been created
by the controversy between the Vati

Rome throughout Sunday. Fortunat

although troops were held under

where the Socialists had arranged a

Paris, Dec. 16. So far as the city
of Paris, an in fact all of the larger
cities of France -was concerned. Sun
day passed comparatively quiet and
there were none of the riots that had
been anticipated as the result of put
ting into effect the new church laws.
Socialistic demonstrations and riot
rng are reported from various sec
tions of the province, but in but one
case were those serious. The excep
tion, was Perpigan, where an attack
was made on the Bishop of the -province
as he was being escorted from
the church to his residence. It was
necessary for the police to charge the
mob a number of times before it was
finally dispersed.
Divine services were held as usual
in Paris. Nearly all of tho churches
were bare of altars or ornaments and
the costly parapheualia had been re
moved. Plain clothes policemen
were very much in evidence in the
cougregations while cordons of uni
formed men were on duty outside
and closely scrutinized all who de
sired to enter.

HARD FOR "DOPE FIENDS"
DRUG STORE LEGISLATION.
Indiana Pharmacists Want to Knock
Out the Practice MaTIfe by Many
Druggists of Appeasing Appetite of
Fiends.
There are some druggists . in the
State, according to Prof. W. C. Stur
mel, professor of pharmacy at Pur
due, who cater to the trade of people
addicted to the drug habit. The leg
lslative committed of the Indiana
Pharmaceutical Association has draf
ted a bill for a law to make it more
difficult to carry on such business.
Under the proposed law, cocaine,
morphine, opium and other narcotics
will be sold only on the prescription
of a physician. "Would-be suicides, as
well as drug fiends., will be checked
by the operation of such a law, the
druggists believe.
The present laws are considered
deficient m many minor points. No
distinction is made between regis1
tered pharmacists and their assis
tants, as far as privileges are con
cerned, though the requirements for
registration are much higher for the
pharmacist. It is desired to have
the inforcement of the laws on this
subject placed in the hands of the
State Board of Pharmacy and to
raise the fees for registration and ex
amination in order that the boaid
may have funds for prosecution of of
fenders. Double the present fees will
be asked. '

these companies will be taken. De

that the representatives of both of
these companies would soon appear
before the Board. a-I inform that
body that formal application for
franchises would be presented to the

President Merrill, of the Board of
Works said that unless there was
some sign of action by the traction
companies, the Board would take the
initiative. Now the time has arrived
for plans to be outlined as to just
what this initiative action will be.
The Board will discuss the situation
at Its meeting this week and a pro
