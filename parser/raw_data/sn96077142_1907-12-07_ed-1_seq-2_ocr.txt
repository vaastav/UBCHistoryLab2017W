Washington. Dec. - s. eiioeni
1 Roosevelt's annual message to congress
la a voluminous document of nearly
0.000 words, by far the long-est mes
sage he has ever submitted to congress.
The opening- subject of the message Is
the financial condition of the country,
and for which the president lays much
Of the blame upon unscrupulous stock
peculators, and says:
"In any large body of men. however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and If the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with Impunity, their
sample Is a very evil thing for the
community.-Where these men are busi
ness men of great sagacity and of tern-
' perament both unscrupulous and reck-
less, and where the conditions are such
that they act without supervision or
control and at first without effective
pheck from public opinion, they delude
anany Innocent people into making In-
business that are really unsound.
iWben the misdeeds of these successful
ly dishonest men are discovered, suf
fering comes not only upon them, but
; upon the Innocent men whom they
have misled. It Is a painful awakening,
whenever It occurs; and, naturally,
when It doea occur those who suffer
ovre apt to forget that the longer It was
deferred the more painful it would be.
In the effort to punish the guilty It la
both wise and proper to endeavor so
far as possible to minimise the dis
tress of those who have been misled by
the guilty. Tet It Is not possible to
refrain because of such distress from
Striving to put an end to the misdeeds
ghat are the ultimate causes of the suf
fering, and. as a means to this end,
.where possible to punish those re
sponsible for them. There may be hon
est differences of opinion as to many
governmental policies; but surely there
can be no such differences as to the
steed of unflinching perseverance In the
war against successful dishonesty."
He quotes at length from his mes
sage of last year In which he advo
cated federal control of corporations
doing Interstate business, and believes
that In auch control would be found the
remedy for overcapitalization and
atock Boeculatlon which he believes
tiave brought about the present finan
cial conditions. He says:
"Our ateady aim should be by legis
lation, cautiously and carefully under
taken, but resolutely persevered In, to
assert the sovereignty of the national
government by affirmative action.
"This Is only in form an Innovation.
In substance It la merely a restoration;
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of Industrial activities has been
recognised' In the action of the law
making bodies; and all that I propose
la to meet the changed conditions In
uch manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only In this coun
try, but also In England before and
Inco this country became s separate
nation.
Federal Coatrol ef
Railroads la Favored.
'"No small part of the trouble that we
tiavo comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue of self-reliance,
of Independence In Initiative
and action. It Is wise to conserve this
Virtue and to provide for Its fullest ex
ere I He, compatible with aoelng that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this Is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
affective regulation Inevitably breeds.
Tho founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of Interstate commerce. There was
then practically no Interstate business
aave auch aa waa conducted by water,
and this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate In thorough
going and effective fashion. Condi
tions have now so wholly changed that
the Interstate commerce by water Is In
significant compared with the amount
that goes by land, and almost all big
business concerns are now engaged In
Interstate commerce. As a result, it
can be but. partially and Imperfectly
controlled or regulated by the action of
any one of the several states; such ac
tion Inevitably tending to be either too
drastic or else too lax. and In either
case Ineffective for purposes of Justice.
. Only the national government can In
thoroughgoing fashion exercise the
needed control. Thla doea not mean
that there should be any extension of
federal authority, for auch authority
already exlata under the constitution In
am pleat and moat far-reaching form;
. mil at uw mnn mat inflri inouia urn
an extension of federal activity. Thla
la not advocating centralisation. It Is
merely looking facta In the face, and
realising that centralisation In bualneaa
baa already coma and can not be avoid
ed or undone, and that the publlo at
large can only protect Itaetf from cer
tain evil effecta of thla bualneaa cen
tralisation by providing better methods
for the exercise or control through tho
authority already centralised . In the
national government by the constitu
tion Itself. There must be no halt In
tha healthy constructive course of ac
tion which thla nation has elected to
pursue, and has steadily pursued, dur
ing the last six years, as shown both In
the legislation of the congress and tha
administration of the law by the de
partment of Justice. The moat vital
need la In connection with the railroads.
Aa to these. In my Judgment there
should now be either a national incor
poration act or a law licensing railway
companies to engage In Interstate com
merce upon certain conditions. The law
should bo so framed aa to give to the
Interstste commerce commission power
to pasa upon the future Isaue of securi
ties, while ample means should be pro
vided to enable the commission, when
over In Ita Judgment It la necessary, to
make a physical valuation of any rail
road. " As I stated In my message to the
ongress a year ago, railroads should
bo given power to enter Into agree
ments, subject to these agreements be-

either to give to or to get from tho
railroads full Justice. The railroads
and all other great corporations will
do. well to recognise that this control
must come; the only question Is as to
what governmental body can most
wisely exercise It The courts will de
termine the limits within which tha
federal authority can exercise It, and
there will still remain ample work
within each state for the railway com-
I mission of that atate; and the national
Interstate commerce commission, will
work In harmony with the aeveral atate
commissions, each within Its own prov
ince, to achieve the desired and.

"Moreover, In my Judgment there "should
bo additional legislation looking to tho
proper control of the great business con
cerns engaged In Interstate bualneaa, this
control to be exercised for their own
benefit and prosperity no less than for
the .protection of Investors and of the
general public. As I have repeatedly
said In measages to congreaa and else
where, experience haa definitely shown
not merely the unwisdom but the futility
of endeavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern Industrial
conditions aro such that combination Is
not only necessary but Inevitable. It Is
so In the world of business Just aa It Is
so In the world of labor, and It Is aa Idle
to desire to put an end to . all corpora
tions, to all big combinations of capital,
as to desire to put an end to combina
tions of labor. ' Corporation and labor
union alike have come to stay. Each If
properly managed la a source of good
and not evil. Whenever In either there
Is evil, It should be promptly held to ac
count; but It should receive hearty en
couragement ao long as It Is properly
managed. It la profoundly Immoral to
put or keep on the statute books a law,
nominally In the Interest of publlo moral
ity, that really puts a premium upon
publlo Immorality, by undertaking to
forbid honest men from doing what must
be done under modern business condi
tions, so that the law Itself provides that
Its own infraction must be the condition
precedent upon business success. To aim
at the accomplishment of too much usu
ally means the accomplishment of too lit
tle, and often the doing of positive dam
age. "The antitrust taw ahould not be re
pealed; but it should be made both more
efficient and more In harmony with act
ual conditions. It should be so amended
as to forbid only the kind of combination
which does harm to the general public,
such amendment to be accompanied by,
or to be an Incident of, a grant of su
pervisory power to the government over
these big corporations engaged In Inter
state business. This should be accom
panied by provision for the compulsory
publication of accounts and the subjec
tion of books and papers to the Inspec
tion of the government officials. A be
ginning has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment of the
bureau of corporations.
"The antitrust law should not prohibit
combtnatlona that do no Injustice to the
public, still less those the existence of
which la on the whole of benefit to the
public. But even If thla feature of the
law were abolished, there would remain
aa an equally objectionable feature the
difficulty and delay now Incident to ita
enforcement. The government must now
submit to Irksome and repeated delays
before obtaining a final decision of the
courta upon proceedings Instituted, and
even a favorable decree may mean an
empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to
control these corporations by lawsuits
means to impose upon both the depart
ment of Justice and the courta an Im
possible burden; It Is not feasible to carry
on more than a limited number of such
suits. Such a law to be really effective
must of course be administered by an
executive body, and not merely by means
of lawsuits. The design should be to
prevent the abuses Incident to the crea
tion of unhealthy and Improper combina
tions. Instead of waiting until they are
In existence and then attempting to de
stroy them by civil or criminal proceed
ings. laveatlag Fublle Should
Be Amply Safeguarded.
"The congress ' has the power to charier
corporations to engage In Interstate and
foreign commerce, and a general law can
be enacted under the provisions of Which
existing corporations could take out fed
eral charters and new federal corpora
tions could be created. ' An essential pro
vision of such a law ahould be a method
of predetermining by some federal board
or commission whether the applicant for
a federal charter was an association or
combination within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity In all matters
affecting the public and complete protec
tion to the Investing public and the share
holders In the matter of Issuing corporate
securities. If an Incorporation law la not
deemed advisable, a license act for big
Interstate corporations might be enacted;
or a combination of tho two might be
tried. The supervision established might
bo analogous to that now exercised over
national banks. At least, the antitrust
act should be supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience haa shown have been of most
service In enabling monopolistic combina
tions to crush out competition. The real
owners of a corporation ahould be com
pelled to do business In their own name.
The right to hold stock In other corpora
tions ahould heareafter be denied to Inter
state corporations, unless on approval by
the proper government officials,' and a
prerequisite to such approval should be
the listing with the government of all
owners and stockholders, both by the
corporation owning auch stock and by
the corporations In which such stock Is
owned.
"To confer upon the national govern
ment. In connection with the amendment
I advocate In the antitrust law. power of
supervision over big business concerns
engaged In Interstate commerce, would
benefit them as It haa benefited the na
tional banks. In the recent bualneaa
crista It la noteworthy that the Institu
tions which failed were ' Instltutlona
which were not under the aupervlalon and
control of the national government.
Those which were under national con
trol stood the test.
"National control of the kind above ad
vocated would be to the benefit of every
well-managed railway. From the stand
point of the public there Is need for ad
ditional tracks, adltlonal terminals, and
Improvements In the -actual handling of
the railroads, and all thla aa rapidly aa
possible. Ample, aafe, and speedy trans
portation factlltlea are eyen more neces
sary than cheap transportation. There
fore, there la need for. the Investment of
money which will provide for all these
thlnga while at the same time securing aa
faa as Is possible better wages and
ahorter hours for their employes. There
fore, while there must be Just and rea
sonable regulation of rates, we should be
the first to protest against sny arbitrary
and unthinking movement to cut them
down without tho fullest and most care
ful consideration of all Interests con
cerned and of the actual -needs of the
situation. Only a special body of men
acting for tho national government un
der authority conferred upon It by the
congress Is competent to paaa Judgment
on auch a matter.
Greater Elasticity la
Carreaey la Urged.
The president quotes extensively from
his last message la dealing with tho di
rect subject of currency legislation, and
says: , .
'"I again urge on the congress tho need
of Immediate attention to this matter.
Wo need a greater elasticity In our cur
rency; provided, of course, that we recog
nise the even greater need of a aafe and
secure currency. - There must always be
tha most rigid examination by tho na
tional authorities. Provision should be
made for an emergency currency. Tho
emergency issue should. Of course, bo
made with an effective guaranty, and up
on conditions carefully prescribed by the
government. Such emergency Issue must
be based on adequate securities approved
by the government, and muat bo Issued
under a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being Issued when the demand
for It waa urgent, while securing Its re
tirement as the demand fell off. It Is
worth Investigating to determine whether
officers and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should bo sub
ject to the - same supervision' as banks;
legislation to thla effect ahould be en
acted for the District of Columbia and
the territories.
"Tet we must also remember that oven
the wlaeat legislation on the subject can
only accomplish a certain amount. - No
legislation can by any possibility guar
antee the bualneaa community against tha
results of speculative folly any more than
It can guarantee an Individual against the
results of his extravagance. When an In
dividual mortgages his house to buy an
automobile he Invites disaster; and when
wealthy men, or men who pose aa auch,
or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager
to become such. Indulge In reckless spec
ulationespecially If It Is aocompanled by
dishonesty they Jeopardise not only their
own future but the future of all their In
nocent fellow-cltlsens. for they expose
the whole business community to panic
and distress." '
He advises against any general tariff
legislation tola session of congress, and
aaya:
"In a country of such phenomenal
growth aa oura it is probably well that
every dozen years or so the' tariff laws
should be carefully acrutinlsed so as to
see that no excessive or Improper bene
fits are conferred thereby, that proper
revenue Is provided, and that our
foreign trade Is encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum
a tariff which will not only al
low for the collection of an ample rev
enue but which will at least make
good the difference In cost of production
here'and abroad; that Is, the difference In
the labor cost here and abroad, for the
well-being of the wage-worker must ever
be a cardinal point of American policy.
The question should be approached pure
ly from a business standpoint; both the
time and the manner of the change being
such as to arouse the minimum of agi
tation and disturbance in the business
world, and to give the least play for
selfish and factional motives. The sole
conatderatlon ahould be to Bee that the
sum total of changes represent the pub
lic good. Thla means that the subject
cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the
year preceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact experience has
conclusively shown that at such a time
It Is impossible to get men to treat It from
the standpoint of the public good. In my
Judgment the wise time to deal with the
matter is Immediately after such elec
tion." He asks for the repeal of tho tariff on
paper and . wood pulp.
He reviews and enlarges upon his pre
vious recommendations for the enact
ment of federal inheritance and Income
tax lawa.
Attention fa called to the prosecution of
wealthy offenders against the national
laws, and In this connection he asks that
the laws under which these prosecutions
are brought be strengthened and made
more definite.
The Use sad the
Abaae ef Injunctions.
"Instances of abuse In the granting of
Injunctions In labor disputes continue to
occur, and the resentment In the minds
of those who feel that their lights are
being Invaded and their liberty of action
and- of speech unwarrantably restrained
continues to grow. Much of the attack
on the use of the process of Injunction Is
wholly without warrant; but I am con
strained to express the belief that for
aome of It there la warrant. Thla ques
tion Is becoming more and more of prime
Importance, and unless the courts will
themselves deal with it In effective man
ner, it Is certain ultimately to demand
aome form of legislative action. It would
be most unfortunate for our social weir
fare If we should permit many honest
and law-abiding citizens to feel that
they had Just cause for regarding our
courts with hostility. I earnestly com
mend to the attention of the congress
this matter, so that some way may be
devised which will limit the abuse of In
junctions, and protect those rights which
from time to time it unwarrantably In
vades. Moreover, discontent Is often ex
pressed with the uae of the proceaa of
Injunction by the courts, not only In la
bor dtsputea, but where atate lawa are
concerned. . I refrain from discussion of
this question aa I am Informed that It
will soon receive the consideration of the
aupreme court."
Of other legislation In the Interest of
labor he favora federal Inspection of rail
roads; providing limited but definite com
pensation for accidents to all workmen
employed In any way by the government,
and says:
"The constitutionality of the employers'
liability act paaaed by the preceding con
greaa haa been carried before the courta.
In two Jurladlctlona the law haa been de
clared unconstitutional, and In three Juris
dictions Its constitutionality haa been af
firmed. The queatlon haa been carried to
tue aupreme -court, the case haa been
heard by that tribunal, and a decision Is
expected at an early date. In tho event
that the court should affirm the consti
tutionality of the act, I urge further leg
islation along the lines advocated In my
message to the preceding congreas. The
practice of putting the entire burden of
loas of life or limb upon the victim or
tne vlctlm'a family ia a form of aoclal In
justice In which the United States atanda
In unenviable prominence. In both our
federal and our atate legislation we have,
with fow exceptions., scarcely gone
farther than the repeal of the fellow
servant principle of the old law of liabil
ity, and In aome of our atatea even thla
alight modification of a complete out
grown principle haa not yet been se
cured." He favors the extension of the eight
hour law to all departmenta of tha gov
ernment, and to all work carried on by
the government. He urges legislation
for the compulsory Investigation of In
dustrial disputes, and says:
"The need for some provision for such
Investigation was forcibly Illustrated
during the past summer, A strike of
telegraph.- operators seriously Interfered
with . telegraphlo ' communication, . caus
ing great damage - to business Interests
and serious Inconvenience to the gen
eral public. Appeals were made to mo
from many parts of the country, from
olty councils, from boards of trade,
from chambers of commerce, and from
labor organisations, urging that steps
be taken . to terminate . tha strike.
Everything - that could with any , pro
priety be done by a representative of
the government was dona without avail,
and for weeks the public stood by and
suffered without recourse of any kind,
Had the machinery exlated and had
there been authority for compulaory
Investigation , of tho dispute, the publlo
would have been placed In possession
of the merits of tho controversy, and
public . onlnlon would , probably .. have
brought about prompt adjustment.
"It Is Idle to hold that without "good
lawa evils such aa child labor, aa tho
over-working of women, as the fail
ure to protect employes from loss of
Ufa or limb, can be affectively reached,
any more than tho evils of rebatea and
stock-watering oan bo reached without
good laws. To fall to stop these prac
tices by legislation means to foroa
honest men Into them, because other
wise the dishonest who surely will
take advantage of them will have
everything their own way. If the states
will correct these evils, well and good;
but tho nation must stand ready to aid
them.

"The conservation, of our national re
sources and their proper use constitute
the fundamental problem which under
Ilea almoat every other problem of our
national life. We muat maintain for
our civilisation the adequate material
basis without which that civilisation
cannot exist. We must show foresight,
wo must look ahead. Aa a nation we
not only enjoy a wonderful measure of
present prosperity but If this prosper
ity Is used aright It la an earnest of
future success such aa no other nation
will have. Tha reward of foresight fot
this nation ia great and easily foretold.
But there must be the look ahead,
there must be a realisation of tha fact
that to waste, to destroy, our natural
resources, to skin and exhaust tha land
Instead of using It so as to Increase Ita
usefulness, will result In undermining
In the days of our children the very
prosperity which we ought by right to
hand down to them amplified and devel
oped. For the last few yeara, through
several agencies, the government, has
been endeavoring to get our people to
look ahead and to substitute a planned
and orderly development of our re
sources In place of a haphasard striv
ing for Immediate profit. Our great
river systems should be developed as
national water highways; the Missis
sippi, with Its tributaries, standing first
In Importance, and the Columbia sec
ond, although there are many others of
Importance on the Pactflo and Atlantic
and the gulf alopes. The national gov
ernment should undertake this work,
and I hope a beginning will be made
In the present congress; and the great
est of all our rivers, the Mississippi,
should receive especial attention. From
the Oreat Lakes to tha mouth of the
Mississippi there should be a deep wa
terway, with deep waterwaya leading
from it to the east and the west. Such
a waterway would practically mean
the extension of our coast line Into the
very heart of our country. It would be
of Incalculable .benefit to our people. If
begun at once It can be carried through
In time appreciably to relieve the con
gestion of our great freight-carrying
lines of railroads. The work should be
systematically and continuously carried
forward In accordance with aome well
conceived plan. Tho main atreama
should be Improved to the highest
point of efficiency before the Improve
ment of tha branches la attempted; and
tha work should bo kept free from
every taint of recklessness or Jobbery."
Attention Is called to the work of ir
rigation and . reclamation of govern
ment lands. In the aame connection he
asks for a revision of the public land
lawa along tha lines proposed by the
publlo lands commission. Believes the
government should tncreaae Ita efforts
to conserve our forests and should In
crease by purchase the existing forest
preserves. On the subject of the natural
resources of the nation he says:
"In the eastern United States the
mineral fuels have already paased Into
the hands of large private owners, and
those of the west are rapidly following.
It is obvious that these fuels should be
conserved and not wasted, and It would
be well to protect the people against
unjust and extortionate prices, ao far
aa that can still be done. What haa
been accomplished In the great oil
fields of the Indian Territory by the
action of tho administration offers a
striking example of the good results
of such a policy. In my Judgment the
government should - have the right to
keep the fee of the coal, oil and gaa
fields In Its own possession and to lease
tho . rights to develop them under
proper regulations; or else, If the con
gress will not adopt thla method, the
coal deposits should be sold under llm-,
Itatlons, to conserve them as public
utilities, the right to mine coal being
separated from the title' to the soil.
The regulations ahould permit coal
lands to be worked In sufficient 'quan
tity by the several corporations. The
present limitations have been absurd,
excessive, and serve no useful purpose,
and often render It necessary . that
there should be either fraud or else
abandonment of the work of getting
out the coal."
Progress of the Work
Oa the Panama CaaaL
"Work on the Panama canal Is pro
ceeding In a highly satisfactory man
ner. In March the total excavation In
the Culebra Cut, where effort waa
chiefly concentrated, waa ,815,270 cublo
yards. In April this waa Increaaed to
619.611 cublo yarda. - There waa a con
siderable decrease In the output for
May and June owing partly to the ad
vent of the rainy season and partly to
temporary trouble with the ateam
shovel men over the question of wagea.
This trouble was settled satisfactorily
to all partlea and In July the total ex
cavation advanced materially and In
August the grand total from all points
In the canal prism by steam shovels
and dredges exceeded all previous
United States records, reaching 1,274,
404 cubic yarda In September this rec
ord was eclipsed and a total of 1.517,
411 cubic yarda waa removed. Of thla
amount 1,481.307 cubic yards were from
the canal prism and 14,105 cublo yards
were from accessory works. These re
sults were achieved In the rainy sea
son with a rainfall In August of 11.(1
Inches and In September of 11. tS Inchea.
Finally, In October, the record waa
again eclipsed, the total excavation be
ing 1.888.719 cublo yards; a truly ex
traordinary record, especially In view
of the heavy rainfall, which was 17.1
Inches. In fact, experience -during the
last two .rainy aeasons demonstrates
that the fains are a less serious ob
stacle to progress than has hitherto
been supposed. ,
"'Work on tho locks and dams at
Oatun, which began actively in March
last, has advanced ao far that It la
thought that masonry work on tho
locks can be begun within II montha.
"Last winter bids were requeated and
received for doing tho work of canal
construction by contract. Nona of them
waa found to be aatisfactory and all
were rejected. It la tho - unanimous
opinion of the present commission that
tho work can . bo done better, mora
cheaply, and more quickly by tho gov
eminent than by private contractors'.
Fully 10 per cent, of tho sntlro plant
needed for construction has been pur
chased or contracted for; machine
shops have been erected and equipped
for making all needed repairs to tho
plant: many thousands of employes
have been secured: an effective organi
sation haa been perfected; a recruiting
system Is In operation which la capable
of furnishing mora labor than can bo
used advantageously: employes aro
welt sheltered and well fed; salaries
paid are satisfactory, and tho work Is
not only going forward smoothly, but
It Is producing results far In advaneo
of the most sanguine anticipations.
Under these favorable conditions, a
change In the method of prosecuting
tha work would be unwise and unjusti
fiable, for It would Inevitably disorgan
ise existing conditions, check progress,
and Increaae the coat and lengthen tho
time of completing the canal.
President Roeoaaaavada
Postal gavtaga Banks.
."I commend to tho favorable consid
eration of the congress a postal aav
Ings bank system, as recommended by
tha postmaster general. The primary
object ia to encourage among our peo
ple economy and thrift and by the uss
of postal savings banks to give them
hn opportunity to huaband their re
aourcea, particularly those who have
not the factlltlea at hand for depositing
their money In aavings banks. Viewed,
however, from the experience of tha
past few weeks, It-is evident that the
advantages of such an Institution are
still more far-reaching. Timid depos
itors have withdrawn their savings for
the time being from national banks; In
dividuals have hoarded their cash and
tha workingmen their earnings; all
of which money haa been withdrawn
and kept In hiding or In the safe de
posit box to , tho detriment of pros
perity. Through the agency of the pos
tal savings banks such money would be
restored to the channels of trade, to
the mutual benefit of capital and labor.
"I further commend to the congress
tho conatderatlon tf tho poatmaater
general's recommendation for an ex
tension of the parcel post, especially on
tho rural routes. There are now S8,
III rural routes, aervlng nearly 15,000,
800 people who do not have the ad
vantages or the Inhabitanta of citlea In
obtaining their auppllea. These recom
mendations have been drawn up to
benefit the farmer and the country
storekeeper; otherwise, I should not
favor them, for I believe that it ia good
policy for our government to do every
thing possible to aid the small town
and the country district It Is desirable
that the country merchant should not
be crushed out.
"The fourth-class postmasters' con
vention haa passed a very strong reso
lution In favor of placing the fourth
class postmasters under the civil-service
law. The administration has - al
ready put Into effect the policy of re
fusing to remove any fourth-class post
masters save for reasons connected
with the good of the service; snd it Is
endeavoring ao far as possible to re
move them from the domain of partisan
politics. It would be a most desirable
thing to put the fourth-class postmas
ters In the classified service."
He renewa hla recommendations of
last year In regard to Alaaka; calls at
tention to the admission of Oklahoma
aa a atate; urges the importance of pro
viding shipping relief for Hawaii; asks

Corporation Contrlootlons
to Coaspalga Expenses. . .
"Under our form of government voting
la not merely a right but a duty, and,
moreover, a fundamental and necessary
duty If a man is to be a good citizen.
It la well to provide that corporations
shall not contribute to presidential or
national campaigns, and furthermore to
provide for the publication of both con
tributions and expenditures. There is
however, always danger In laws of this
kind, which from their very nature are
difficult of enforcement: the danger being
leat they be obeyed only by the honest?,
and disobeyed by the unscrupulous, so
as to act only as a penalty upon honest
men. Moreover, no auch law would ham
per an unscrupulous man of unlimited
meana from buying hla own way into of
fice. There la a very radical measure
which would, I believe, work a substan
tial Improvement In our system of con
ducting a campaign, although I am well
aware that It will take some time for
people to ao familiarise themselves with
such a proposal aa to be willing to con
alder Ita adoption. The need for collect
ing large campaign funda would vanish It
congresa provided an appropriation for
the proper and legitimate expenses of
each of the great national parties, an ap
propriation ample enough to meet the
necessity for thorough organisation and
machinery, which requires a large ex
penditure of money. Then the stipula
tion should be made that no party re
ceiving campaign funds from the treasury
should accept more than a fixed amount
from any Individual subscriber or donor;
and the necessary publicity for receipts
and expenditures could without difficulty
bo provided."
Waata Improvement la the
Oeeaa Mall Service.
' "I call your especial attention to the un
satisfactory condition of our foreign mall
service, which, because of the lack of
American steamship lines, la now largely
done through foreign lines, and which,
particularly ao far aa South and Central
America are concerned, la done In a man
ner which constitutes a aerloua barrier
to the extenatona of our commerce.
"The time has come, In my Judgment,
to aet to work seriously to make our
ocean mall service correspond more
closely with our recent commercial and
political development. A beginning was
made by the ocean mall act of March 3,
1891, but even at that time the act was
known to be Inadequate In various par
ticulars. Since that time events have
moved rapidly In our history. We have
acquired Hawaii, the Philippines, and
leaser Islands In the Pacific. We are
steadily prosecuting the great work of
uniting at the Isthmus the waters of the
Atlantlo and the Pacific. To a greater
extent than seemed probably even a
doaen years ago we may look to an
American future on the sea worthy of
the tradition of our past. As the first
step In that direction, and the atep moat
feasible at tho preaent time, I recommend
the extension of the ocean mall act of
189L That act haa stood for some yeara
free from successful criticism of Its prin
ciple snd purpose. It waa baaed on theo
ries of the obligations of a great marl
time nation, undisputed In our own land
and followed by other nattona alnce the
beginning of ateam navigation. Briefly
those theoriea are, that It la the duty, of
a first-class power ao far as practicable
to carry Ita ocean malls under Ita own
flag; that the fast ocean steamships and
their crews, required for such mall serv
ice, aro valuable auxiliaries to the sea
power of a nation. Furthermore, the
construction of such steamships ' Insures
tha maintenance In an efficient condition
of tho shipyards In which our battleships
muat bo built.
"Tho expenditure of publlo money for
tho performance of auch necessary func
tions of government la certainly war
ranted, nor la It necessary to dwell upon
tho Incidental benefits to our foreign
commerce, to the shipbuilding Industry,
and to ship owning-and . navigation which
will accompany tho discharge of these
urgent public duties, though they, too,
should have weight."
Asks lasreass Is Pay
for Army OtBeera sad Mats.
Tha president devotes much space to
tha affairs of tho army, and strongly
urges that bur regular military organi
sation be kept up to tho. hlgheat possible
atandard of efficiency, and aays:
"Tho medical corpa should bo much
greater than the needs of our regular
army la war, Tet at preaent It Is small
er than tho needs of the service demand
oven In peace. Tho Spanlah war oc
curred leaa than ten years ago. Tho
chief loss wo suffered In It wsa by dla
ease among tho regimenta which never
left tho country. At tho moment the
nation seemed deeply Impressed by this
fact; yet seemingly It has already been
forgotten, for not the slightest effort
has been made to prepare a medical
corps of sufficient sisa to prevent the
repetition of the same dleaater on a
much, larger scale If wo should ever bo
engag'ed In a ; serious conflict
"But the medical department la not the,
only department for which Increased pro
vision anouia do maue. vi
for the officers should be greatly in
creased; there Is no higher type of citlsen
than the American regular officer, and ho
should have a fair reward for hla ad
mirable work. There ahould bo a rela
tively even greater Increaae In tha pay for
the enlisted men. An especial provision
ahould be -made for establishing grades
equivalent to those of warrant officers In
the navy, which should be open to. tha
enlisted men who servo sufficiently long
and who do their work well. Inducements
ahould be offered aufflclent to encourage
really good men to make the army a life
occupation. The prime needa of our prea
ent army la to aecure and retain compe
tent noncommlasloned officers. This diffi
culty rests fundamentally on the ques
tion of pay. The noncommlaatoned officer
does not correspond with an unskilled la
borer; he corresponds to the best type of
skilled workman or to tho subordinate
official in civil Institutions. Wages have
vreatlv Increased in outside occupations
in the last 40 yeara and the pay of the
soldier, like the pay of the officers, ahould
be proportionately Increaaed. Tha first
aergeant or a company, n a guuu mn,
muat be one of auch executive and ad
ministrative ability, and such knowledge
of his trade, aa to be worth far more than
we at preaent pay him. The same la true
of the regimental sergeant major. These
men should be men who had fully re,
solved to make the army a life occupa
tion and they should be able to look for
ward to ample reward; while only men
properly qualified should be given a
chance to aecure these final rewards. The
Increase over the preaent pay need not
be great in the lower grades for the first
one or two enlistments, but the Increase
should be marked for the noncommis
sioned officers of the upper grades who
serve long enough to make it evident that
they Intend to stay permanently In the
army, while additional pay should be
given for high qualifications In target
practice.
"Among the officers there should be
severe examinations to weed out the
unfit up to the grade ot major. From
that position on appointments should
be solely by selection and it ahould be
understood that a man of merely av
erage capacity could never get beyond
the position of major, while every man
who serves in any grade a certain
length of time prior to promotion to
the next grade without getting the
promotion to the next grade should be
forthwith retired." .
President Sees Need of
Largely Iaereased Navy.
The president asks for a continuous
Increase In the navy, and asks present
congress for appropriations for four
new battleships, and saya:
"We need always to remember that
In time of war the navy Is not to be
used to defend harbors and sea-coast
cities; we should perfect our system of
coast fortifications. The only efficient
use for the navy is for offense. The
only way In which It can efficiently pro
tect our own coast against the possible
action of a foreign navy is by destroy
ing that foreign navy. For defense
against a hostile fleet which actually
attacks them, the coast cities must de
pend upon their forts, mlnea torpedoes,
submarines and torpedo boats and de
stroyers. All of these together are ef
ficient for defensive purposes, but they
In no way supply the place of a thor
oughly efficient navy capable of acting
on the offensive: for parrying never yet
won a fight. It can only be won by
hard tilling, and an aggressive sea-going
navy alone can do thla hard hitting
of the offensive type. But the forts
and the like are necessary so that the
navy may be footloose. In time of war
there Is sure to be demand, under pres
sure or fright, for the ships to be scat
tered so as to defend all kind of ports.
Under penalty of terrible disaster, this
demand must be refused. The ships
must be kept together, and their ob
jective made the enemies' fleet. If
fortifications are sufficiently strong, no
modern navy will venture to attack
them, so long as the foe haa In exist
ence a hostile navv of anything like
the same sise or efficiency. But unless
there exists such a navy then the forti
fications are powerless by themselves
to secure the victory. For of course
the mere deficiency meana that any
resolute enemy can at hla leisure com
bine all hla forcea upon one point with
the certainty that he can take It

"Until our battle fleet is much larger
than at present it should never be split
into detachments so far apart that they
could pot in event of emergency be
speedily united. Our coast line Is on
the Pacific Just as much as on the At
lantic. The Interests of California,
Oregon and Washington are as em
phatically the Interests Of the whole
union as those of Maine and New York,
of Louisiana and Texas. The battle
fleet should now and then be moved to
the Pacific, Just as at other times It
should be kept In the Atlantic. When
the Isthmian canal is built the transit
of the battle fleet from one ocean to
the other will be comparatively easy.
Until It Is built I earnestly hope that
the battle fleet will be thus shifted be
tween the two oceans every year or
two. The marksmanship on all our
ships has Improved phenomenally dur
ing the last five years. Until within
the last two or three years It was not
possible to train a battle fleet In squad
ron maneuvers under service conditions,
and It Is only during these last two or
three years that the training under
these conditions haa become really ef
fective. Another and most necessary
stride In advance ia now being taken,
'ihe battle fleet la about starting by
the Straits of Magellan to visit the
Pacific coast Sixteen battleahlpa are
going under the command of Rear Ad
miral Evana, while eight armored
crulaera and two other battleahlpa will
meet him at Ban Franciaco, whither
certain torpedo destroyers are also go
ing. No fleet of auch also haa ever
made auch a voyage, and It will be of
very great educational uae to all en
gaged In it The only way by which to
teach officers and men how to handle
the fleet so as to meet. every possible
strain sjnd emergency In time of war Is
to have them praotlce under similar
conditions In time of peace. Moreover,
the only way to find out our actual
needs Is to perform in time of peaco
whatever maneuvers might bo neces
sary In time of war. After war Is de
clared It la too late to find out tho
needs; that means to Invito disaster.
The trip to the Pacific will show what
aome of our needa are and wttl enable
ua to provide for them. The proper
place for an officer to learn his duty
Is at sea, and the only way In which a
navy can over bo made efficient is by
practice at sea. under, all .the condi
tions which would have to bo met If
war existed."

by tho aecond peaco conference at Tho
Hague; notes tho Improvement -of ad
fairs In Cuba, and the preparations be
