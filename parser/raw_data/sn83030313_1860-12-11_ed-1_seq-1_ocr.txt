W.*aniMK?, Dec. 10, 1S60.
A special Cabinet meeting was called by the President
this morniDg. ut whi< h Mr. Cobb, the Secretary of the
Treasury, rex gr? !, and tbe resignation wis accepted.
Tliis in no longer a rumor, but a positive fact, obtained
from the highest authority. Of course speculations are
plenty as to who will succeed Mr. Cobb. Mr. Alexander
H. Stephens, of Goorgia, is named as most likely to be the
man, but his friends spurn tho idea of bis mixing a the
complications of the present administration. Co'lector
Schell, of New York, some th nk will succeed Mr. CoMi.
Mr Cobb leaves here on Thursday evening, and takes
the steamer from Hultimore on Friday for Charleston,
8. C. , with th<> intention of visiting the secossion Conven
tion in that ^tate ai Columbia, on the 17th inst.
No successor to Secretary Cobb has yet been designated.
The names of several have been suggested, among them
Mr. Guthrie, of Kentucky, and Mr. Corning,
?f New York. It is barely jvonsiblo that
the President will arrange it without going outside of his
Cabinet, putting Mr. Holt in the Treasury, and allowing
Horation King, now (lrst|assistant, to perform tho duties
of Postmaster General.
Mr. llawkins, of Florida, to-day excused himself for
not serving on the Committee of Thirty-three, in an elabo
rate speech defending tbe South and the right of seces
sion. It is rumored that he will resigu his seat if the
Bouse refuses to excuse him. The galleries were
crowded and the House gave the utmost attention to
what he said.
This has been a busy day for speeches in both houses,
and the galleries have been tilled with a truly attentive
audience.
In the Senate, Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, delivered a
republican speech, and charging upon tbe democratic
party the cause of all the trouble now overwhelming the
country, .
Judge Donglas responded, and rebuke ) the -enst- >r for
his assigning such a reason for existing difficulties.
Senator Davis, of Mississippi, took ground that com
promises for the salvntion of the Union must now come
from the North, not the South, as the minds of the
southern people were now made up to demand and ob
tain (heir r nstituUooal rights or leave the I'n.on.
Senator Green, of Missouri, hoped the South would not
proceed rashly to extremiti s without exliaustvng all
means of reconciliation. The North hod not been call >d
upon to rxpn ss its mind on the subject of disunion since
the election of Lincoln. In the event of saturation lie
was with his Southern friends.
In the House, after Mr. Hawkins, of Florida, had
spt ken his hour, but not exhausted his subject , the young
and active Northwest took the arena, and Mr Vallandig
ham, of Ohio. aod Mr MoCleraanS, of Illinois, deliver-d
powerful npp. sis to the North for justice to tho *>uih
t.nd showing the injustice and partiality the ."p^aker ? x
hibited in tho construction of the committee ut thirty
three, iu it n-arly, if not entirely. Ignored the
cxw-t'-uce of one million six hundred th >??
sand d> mocrnw. Mr. Vallandighnm wai particul.i ly
hsppy and glowing u his remarks, defining tbe
position of the grtat West in the present crisis, aadclo 1
by d< claring that ph? would ever submit to plac ug th#
Mi. sisMjipi river in the hands of a foreign Power, if she
had to cleave her way to the Gulf of Mexioo with the
?word.
Mr Fickle*, of New York, followed, and declared that
If sepnrati n occurred the Imperial City would never nub
n il to becoming the appendant) of a Puritan government,
but would declare her own Independence, and become a
free city for commerce with the whole world. Mr H.
was severe upon the republican* of the State for tnfltct
ujk the oppressive measure* they had upon tho city -f
New York, referring particularly to the standing army >f
policemen, who patrolled the city night and day, ?< ij>
pre*Mng the outburst* of the iudigiiaat feelings of the p. >
pie at thi* crisis.
Bel ore the debate ended , Mr John Sherman, of tie
Committee of Way* and M'-na* , by general consent, int r
poeet the Treasury Note bill. authorizing the freeh Mr le
of ten million*. stating that unles tho bill wan pa*- d
there would be a deficit of fifteen to twenty million* ?<

Oen. Houston, of Alabama took ihe position that in t .'?

government wa* much impaired, and that coil.tlcmi ?
cnrlty. like tb< poblh lands, would facilitate the ojv i

Among the numerous plans suggested to cave the coun

the sentiment of the people as changed daring the past

Hull of lndep< udence, at Philadelphia , that the Conven
ticn unite in an alteration of the constitution on meeting
the mints of the country, restoring as far as possible the
leeling existing before the present troubles, by Bending
treth I'tpnsentatives to Washington.
The statement that the representatives from tho cot

Northern members, is without a shadow of foundation.

The Navy Department received dtopatche* this morning

of importance. He states tSt he fell in on the 18th of

of Boston. She had evidently been abaadoued but a short
time previous. All her boats were gone. The health of
the officers and crew of the squadron was good.
He intended to sail for Spezia in a few days.
The Department of State has under consideration the

The attempt of Mr Crawford, of Georgia, to pledge the
public laud* for the redemption of the no tee, was re
ceived as a plan to kill the Homestead bill ,n the Senate
0 was sustained by all of the secessionists; but, under
the exposition of Mr. Grow, showing that the faith 0f the
government was enough to secure the redemption or tho
notes, and that the public lands should not bo lookod to
as a source of revenue, quoting Andrew Jaduun to bus
tain him, the proposition of Mr. Crawford was voted
down two to one.

Afairt at the Capital ? Stagnation in Hutineu ? Heal Et
tat* ? About the Ksvenue, 4c.
The gloom which hangs over the whole Und seems
denser and darker n the federal city than elsewhere.
Men's faces wear a sombre and melancholy aspect, and
the place has lost Its usual air of pleasantness. Hotel
proprietors, sbopkeeperg, property owners, and those
numerous families who have been in the habit of deriving
advantage from the presence of Congress by keeping
boarders, renting furnished apartments, and In a variety
of ways, have reason to deplore the disastrous effects of
political agitation; and I think that if the suffrages of the
people of Washington were taken at this moment there
would be an almost unanimous verdict of condemnation
against politicians and seltlsh deuiagogm-s in ill sections
ot the country. The present condition of tilings here is bad,
very bad ; the prospect is deplorable. There are not half
the ordinary number of strut g1 "> in town, and those who
arc here either have no money to spend or ttnd it neces
sary to practise strict euutkomy. The consequence in
thai there is a general stagnation in business of every
kind, and the citizens of the District are therefore terri
bly down in the mouth. The population of Washington
is in the neighborly ' of 00,000, composed almost entirely
of persons dependent directly or indirectly on the fede
ral government; and as a consummation of the secession
movement would undoubtedly i suit in having the loca
tion of the capital of th<> rental; : g .States changed, that
prospect is naturally very alarn g to all who have their
hemes here or have an interesi in Washington property.
The crisis is the more to be > ,?retted at this time
mat much as considerable !> provenents In the
way of new builduigtt hi. bee i going on
since the adjournment of last s <>n. In the present
transition state of affairs prop< here is unsaleable.
< hie of the handsomest public ed. of which the city
can boast is that which Oorcorai ic wealthy banker,
has been erecting on Pennsylvania -me, directly oppo
site the War I>?partment, as in ? Institution. Tito
building, which cannot have c<^t le- 1 'iaO $50,000, is ap
proaching completion; but what ni' ? be the exasperu
tion of its founder when he reflects tt his generou- In
tend* ns ure in imminent n.-k of bein 'rustrated by in
sensate demagogues, puffed up with I idinate ideas of
their vast importance, and ready to s> . .ileo ever.Mhing
to tlieir own selfish ambition.
The excitement about the Capitol during the four days
of the sittings of Congri ss was commensurate with tlio
ttate of public feeling existing here. It uas not so much
the expectation of witnessing scenes of strife on the door
of either house that led to the galleries and the passages
leading to them being crowded day after day. as it was
the anxiety of the people to watch what was going for
waid, to witness the thioes of un expiring republic, or to
hail tne earliest gleam* of a brighter day.
There is but one sentiment arising the residents of the
District . and that. I need hardly say . is jii l vor of con
ciliation, hat tuou.x . and the perpetuity of the Union. It I
is not so, however, w.th the MgoarMr* here. All shades
of opinion ure retlei te<l by them, and wherever ; ou turn,
you hear unimated discussion* in regard ' seces
sion, disunion, the disposition of the Territories, the
reopeuing of the stove tin le and civil war. There
are i.o outward symbols of tii- ifiK'ttou to tbe
federal government displayed hero ? uo kiting
of l'almetto flags, or wearing of tb blue
cockade. 1 have seen but one cockade worn, a 1 that
was i.n inaoct i t looking riMHe, such as might pi tlie
fan< y of a child, pinned to a young man's hat. Th . ub
walked with bis bead down, avoiding lecognitl"' IS if
b< was ashamed el his lolly.
The l'n sident, m bis Me -age, intimate <1 h.s dele: . i i
tlon to collect the federal revenue at the [s>rt of Ch
ton . in spite of all obstacles that might prove '? i
dangerous experiment, li the Collector r?-igu. an l ??
CUsti ci llouto arrangements be br< ken up, with th< J
auihoritiiM refusing to permit any fi, ? I
Mates officials to collect revenue, an attempt ' >
enforce the turifl laws could not fail to provoke tr. - a
result - What, then, should be doner
Mi Bi.cliaiian says, and says truly, that he lias no rig) I
to recognise iny Mate action involving a rupture of ti )
federal I n ion or a nullification of federal laws. But f
tbe contingency to which I have alluded does occur, ai 1
if? as is not improbable ? tlie federal forts l>e taken poa
session eC by the Hiate autbarltie*, there is still a teg il
and rate remedy It is this . U t tbe I'res-.deiit issue a
pi i c'amation declaring tfiat . inasmuch i.s the revenues
cannot be peacefully collected a' Chart ?Mi, that port i
temporarily closed as a port of euiry. If be liave not the
power to do so, Congros can pas* a law authorizing the
l*rc> ilet.l, In aiiahvous cit cuaislaxicsa, to take that course
in regard Ui any port when- K<r any cause tue revenues
cannot 1m> collected This will be the l"ast offensive, an I,
and at tbe same time, th)- u?*t elective nnatw of sus
taining thi' laws and ignoring tlie action of those who
would nullify them and d ins >iV6 the I'nion Besides, it
will l>e bi t an act of s. It defence and of common JustK e

In ibis way a collision between the federal and State
authorities can t>e avuMh-d ? at least an laaue of arms? >
and tine will 1m. obtained tor m tiling peacefully and con
stitutionally all questions in debate. South Carolina w il

Of conrs<- it would meet with great oppt sit ion from tne
representatives of tle-'Stati - that conl4iiiplati>se<'NMM>ii;
but I think that the repr. seutativ. s of all th? other

under the constitution to secure myself, he who has
mittereii no wrong except an imaginary wrong; says the
?pirit is corrupt. If the committee on tho resolutions
goes in for military despotism, 1 go against it. Mr. l.m
coin can't invade a single State. H? can't prevent the
in van ion of a Stile lie can't take uwuy properly , but
he Can protect it. I my Holy would coerce no Statu. 1
deny nullification. If a Statu in ,n the I'nion her people
are subject to the I'nion and lawn. If nut of the I'niun
there wss no right to enforce.
Mr. I.ATU.4M then Bant ? It is not ray purpose to address
the Senate at thin time upon th<> pending resolution
1 rife to correct a false imprewon < pon the public
mind. I have Keen published in sovepi of the loading
journals of the country statements us to the attitude of i
California In the present crisis. It has been said, and is
believed by many, that in the event of the seces
sion of several States of tbo Union that CUliforma
would avail herself of the opportunity to declare her own
inde)? n<l> nce, and in conniption with otte r territory on
the laiilic f" mi a Pacific republic Mr. Presi
dent, there is not a word of truth m thw
Idea, and It ilo<s great injustice to the people
of that State. The I'uiou has no more loval subjects
than the people of California, and out of her hall million
population I believe there are not many for disunion
In any shape. California will remain in the Cnion
ax It Is and as it may be, and If, us It Heem.;
now to be conceded, the cotton States withdraw
from the I'nktn and are eventually followed by all the
Southern States, Oillfernia, I am certain, will stlil remain
with the great West and the N'orlh, with whom she n
unentitled. In addressing this body upon the lflth of
April last, I pot forward the Idea of a Pacific
republic upon u>e dissolution of the existing I'nion.
I am satisfied upon more mature reflection, to say
the least, I was prt mature; for whatever may be be my
own opinion of the right or wrong of the present agiti
ting question ? a question on which California has no
present or vital interest ? 1 feel it my bounden duty to
thus give not only my own opinion but, as one of her
representatives, to state what I believe to be the voice of
he r majority. There is but one thing which will or can
alienate the affections of tho people of the Pacific from
the I'nion as it is or us u may be and that is a failure
to give them a Pucitlc railroad and. lu.til it is completed,
overland mail facilil.es. Vpou this question they are
clamorous, urgent, unanimous, and since tho North an<l
greut West are thoroughly committed to the material
idea their legality cannot he questioned. I sliall, Mr.
President, at -ome future ila\ u ith the indulgence of the
Senate, submit a few reasons for this opinion, and also
allude to the present condition of the country, but not
until other Senators who rank me in age, exi?rience and
wisdom are heard.
A message wus here received from tho President
threu) h lr- pr.vate secretary. '
Mr. t RiTTvMiKM, (epp.) of Ky., then spoke for ten mi- |
nutes in favor of the I'nion in an inaudible anil feeble
Mr PrM.vKK, (rep.) of Mat-? , next obtained the lloor.

TCic motion to excuse Mr. Hawkins from service on tho
sclect Committee of Thirty three to take into rounder**
tion the perilous condition of the country, uom.og up,
Mr. ILiWkMH, (opp. ) of Fla. , further explained why b<j
did not wish to serve on the committee. He had been
guided by bin own ideas a* to what was appropriate on
thin occasion. The solution of the question, and the con
clusion being so Mini ile, lie a* :ed riilirely on bin own re
sponsibility. It was true that al ter lio had marked out bi?
course he asked the opinion of the great majority of tbo
extreme Southern members, and they, with one or two
exceptions, agreed with httn. By virtue of the powers ca
trusted to him. he might act on a oommittoe under cir
( umstances different from those now existing, but ha
could not no w dio so, us Florida has initiated measures for
a State Convention on the 3d of January, and will tak<]
such steps as will be compatible with her dignity and
honor ll was true that the population of Florida had
been retard) .1 by untoward circumstances. She w nu
merically wi ait , but for that nlie is not the less sovereign v
and is enl itled to all th^ rights and immunities of thti
other sovereign Stat< s Florida cannot be tor cod to re
main in the I tilou if she want ; to g<> out. Such an at
tempt would bo resisted by ten lion s the number of fede
ral troops marched against her. The Southern State*
are pledged to do it; Virginia stands pledged not to see a
sovereign state coerced if she thinks tno timn
has arrived when her honor arid safety require ber to go
out of the Union. Florida, he repeated, is determined
to sett it lor herself and in her own way the mode and
manner of redress, witlsiut trusting te Congressional
compi onuses, which have never l>een productive of puacu
and harmony. 'Ihe component parts of this committee
were peculiarly unfortunate and ill advised. If tho
Speak< r I, ad consulted his own judgment and the honest
dictates of his pure and manly heart, he (Mr. Hawkins)
believed th*- material of the committee would have been
very different No democratic member tror.i Uio North
west Is on the c? ninnttee. The interests of that section
have be<n singularly ignored. The material of the com
mitte is most incongruous ai d heterogeneous, and as it
sample of others, be did tiot believe that the. appointment
ni Mr. I>a vis. of Maryland, wan fair and appropriate.
Maryland, at the last session of her W'^islature, passed a
resolution denouncing thai gentleman more particularly
lor voting for Mr. I'euiriugton tor Speaker, and by that
vote constituting him the presiding officer of this House.
The people i l Maryland, as well as of the entire Sootb,
assumed this ground, iiainelj ? that every Southern man
who thus voted for S|i akrr was a traitor to that section,
and thai vote is ab-o regarded as in op|.o*itlori to slavery.
Mr. Ban. oh, (Am ) ol N Y., in explanation, said that
his vote for Mr Pennington was tiot given for the object
the gentleman attributed, namely, op|iosltioti to any sec
ts'ii, but as a rational vote lor a naiional tnau.
Mr. ILawki.ns ? 1 was "iM-aknig of Southern men.
