QUIET IN THR STOCK MAttKET.
llamore of a Syndicate Makes Quicksilver
Take a Jump,
With tho excoption of a further jump in
tho price of Quicksilver Common to 12, or
rumors that a powerful syndicate has practi
cally cornered that product, tho movo
lucnts in stocks up to a late hour
wero confined within a narrow range
of prices. The bulls lifted the market X to 1
por cent, soon after the opening, but they
met with more opposition than on yesterday
and tne bears soon wiped out tho improve
ment. The story about tho thoft of tho President's
message and its sale to certain Wall street
speculators who, it is alleged, entered into a
combination to break the market, caused
would-be buyers to hesitate, and this of
itself operated against an advance. As
money continues easy at K a 6 per cent.,
however, and exchange is gravitating to
wards tho gold Importing point, tho
work of depressing tho last is
found difficult. The posted rates
of sterling wore this morning loworod to
4.81K and 4.85if, owing to a light inquiry and
offerings of bills by the German nrbitrngo
bouses. A small further decline will bring
gold from Europe.
Tho biggest fight was in Union Pacific.
This stock has uy common consent been
mado the leader, although it is
not yet known what recommendations
will be made in tho report of tho Pacifio Hail
way Investigating Commission. Tho fact
that the Transcontinental roads have fixed
up their differences, and reports that tho
Union Pacifio and St. Paul have entered into
trnffla agreement makes these stocks special
favorites at the moment.
The new issue of bonds by the Manhattan
Elevated is telling on the stock which is
down to 07K regular and 68 seller 60.
. Tho commission houses say they are carry
Ing no largo linos of stocks, and heiico that
tho market is in no danger of any
great reaction. There is, however,
an indisposition to trade, and tho
changos are almost entirely due to manipula
tion by tho professionals. After the
President's message and Socretary Falrchlld's
annual report are digested a revival of busi
ness is looked for.

Firms Untvllllut; to Ittsk Lose at Tula
Heaspn by st Strike Decisive Action Mnr
He Tnken To-Nlaht-The Demands of the
3Ien In Clinrne of KnluUts of Labor,
According to the latest advices none of the
men employed by tho various livery firms
and corporations had struok for tho increase
of wages and the decrease of hours, the do
maud for which was reported exclusively in
tho evening edition of yesterday's Would.
Unless, howovor, tho demands are acceded
to, some stables aro likely to bo without
hands boforo nightfall, tho men say.
Ryerson &. Brown, who control tho Now
York Cab Company, are not members of tho
Association of Liverymen, and have arranged
satisfactorily with their mon.
Many of tho firms alleoted knowthat it will
not do under any cirotfmstanoes to have n
strike, for if one took placo they would lose
their customers, who would resort to the elo
vated railways, and many of whom would
never return to the cab jyetem. The elevated
railways have seriously aiTected the cab busi
ness, and the liverymen are loath to educato
any more of thoir old patrons into riding on
tho cam.
llradley fc Co. have settled matters satis
factorily with their mon, but have not
granted the short-hour rule.
" Liberty Dawn " is the name of the local
assombly of tho Knights of Labor to which
tho livery stablemen aro attached, and it is
within the jurisdiction of Dlstriot Assembly
49, whose Eiooutlvo Board is conducting the
negotiations between tho employoes and tho
employers,
Joseph Seaich thinks that the liverymen
will do with less hands if the demands aro
granted.
Quite a numbor of the leading livery firms
have yielded to the domonds, and it is thought
that no serious strike will ocour. Tho loss to
tho employers would bo particularly severo
just now in tho holiday season.
Tho "cabbies" will, it is said, meet on
Sunday next in Beckor's Hall, when tho
whole subjoct will bo discussed and noted
upon after reports havo been read' from tbe
tho committees from eaoh stable.
ATTEMPT TO WRECK A TRAIN.
Two Attempts Made to Derail the Amboy
Kxpress at Prince's Day.
It was reported this morning that a des
perato attempt was made on Bunday night by
malicious persons to wreck the Amboy ex
press train by placing ties across the
track at tho grade at Prince's Bay
Station. Wesley ltomor, who was walking
along tho track about ten minutes before the
8 o'clock train was duo at that point, noticed
the obstruction and removed it from the
track. He then proceeded on his walk.
William Butlor, also of Prince's Bay,
walkod along the track a fow mlnutos after
Mr. ltomor had removed tho obstruction,
and found that tho ties had again boen placed
on the track. He immediately realized
tho danger and set to work to
remove the ties. He had but just completed
this when tho train camo rushing along.
Had the train been derailed at this point, it
would havo resulted in a frightful disastes.
Tho railroad officials deny any knowlodgo
of the 'affair.

It Excellent.
At 1 o'clock a World reporter showed to
Mayor Hewitt a copy of the President's Mes
sago. " You have offered me the first ovidence I
have seen that the President has sent a mes
sage to Congress," said His Honor amiably.
He sat down and ran his eye rapidly over the
columns. He seized the salient points with
tho rapidity of a practised reader, and said :
" Mr. Cleveland has dono well to confine
himself to tho presentation of this all.im
portant subject of the surplus and the
tariff. So far as I can see, from this
superficial reading of the message, the
President seems to have affirmed my
own views on the tariff, whloh may bo found
in my speechos and writings. Of course, I
am in favor of his suggestions. Tho message
seems to mo to bo on excellent one,"

lb faa Comgnt. q IA CW(cl StutM I
You are confronted at the threshold of your leg
islative duties with a condition of the national
finances whioti Imperatively demands Immediate
and careful consideration.
The amount of muuey annually exacted, through
the operation of present laws, from the Industries
and necessities or the people, largely exceeds the
sum necessary to meet the sxpeuses of the Uovern-
mcm.
When we consider that the theory of our Institu
tions guaranteea to every citizen tbe full enjoyment
of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise,
wltn only such deduction aa may be hla share to
wards the careful snd economical raalntsnanoe of
the Government whioti protects him, It Is plain
that the exaction of more than thla Is lndefen.lblo
extortion and a culpable betrayal 01 American fair
ness and Justice. 1 hla wrong lnfllctid upon those
who bear Ihe burden of national tax
ation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood
of evil consequences, 'Ihe pablio Treasury, which
should only exlat as a conduit conveying tne peo
ple's tribute to Its legitimate objeoia ot expendi
ture, becomes a hoarding-place for money need
lessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use,
thus crippling our national enemies, suspending
our oiuntry's development, preventing investment
In productive enterprise, threatening dnanclal dis
turbance, and Inviting scbemea of public plunder.
This condition of our Treasury Is not ultugettier
newt and It has more than oner of late D00u au
milted 10 the people's representatives In tho Con
fress, who alone can apply a remedy. And yet
ho situation still continues, with aggravated Inci
dents, more than ever presaging financial convul
alon and wide-spread disaster.
ACT BEFORE DISASTER C01IES.
It will not do to negleot this situation because its
dsngera are not now palpably Imminent and ap
parent. They exist none the less certainly, aud
await tbe unfnrraten and unexpected occasion
when suddenly they win be precipitated upon us.
On tbe coin d.V of June, IbSS, the excest of
revenues over publlo expenditures after complying
with tho aunuai requirement of the Sinking Fund
act, wasllT,39,7S5.84; durlngtne year ended June
SO, 18, aucb excess amounted to M9,05,.J6.vo,
and during tne year ended Juno SO, ltST, It reached
tbe sum of i55,sT,Ml.M.
Tbe annual contributions to tbe sinking fund dur
ing the three years above aneilfied, amounting In
the aggregate to J18i,0M,Si0. M, and deducted from
the surplus assisted, were made by calling In for
that purpose outstanding three per cent, bonds of
the Uovernment. During the six months prior to
June so, lb7, tbo surplus revenue had growu so
large by repeated accumulations, and it waa feared
the wltndrawal of tb's great amu of moueyneedel
by the people would ao aSeU the tmstntsi of the
couutry ti at tho sum of STf.bOt, 100 of such surplus
was applied to the payment of thu principal and
Intertst of the thrcu per cent, bonds still outstand
ing, and which wero then payable at tho option of
Ihe Government. Ihe irccarloua condition of
financial affairs among the people still
needing relief, Immedla-ely after the soth day of
June, 1M7, tho reminder ot the 8 per cent, bonds
then outstanding, amounting with principal aud
interest to thu sum ot 118,817, 50o, were called in
and applied to the aluklng fund contribution for
the curreut fiscal year. Notwithstanding theKe
operations of the Treasury Department representa
tions of dlattess lu bulne.s circles not ony con
tinued, but Increase I, ami atiso uto peril ciued
at hand. In tune circumstances the contribution
to the slaking fund for Ihe mrrsut ilscal year
waa at once completed by the expenditure of til,
bM,25.65 in the purchase of (Soverumeut boud. not
yet iuebeailng s aud 4X percent. Intenst, ihe pre
mium paid thereon averaging about 24 perctui.
for the lorinn and 8 per lent, for the latler. In
addition to thia the lut rest accruing during the
current year u.on ouiaiaudlng bouded lndvie
hess if tne Uovernment n as 1 some extent antici
pated, and barks selected a dep i.ltorles of public
money were perml.led to some a bat Increase their
deposits. 4
While tbe expedients thus employed, to r leae
lo tbi people tne muuey lying Idle In t 0 Trea ury,
arvedio avert Immediate dan er, our surp us
revenues liaw c.nllnued to accumulate, the ex
ce.a for the present year amounting n tne 1st day
of Det-euiber 10 I3J,KJ,i01 IK. aud est malm to
reach the sum of $113,010,000 on the soth of
June next, at which elate it I. expected that thu
turn, ad'ied to prior accumulation., will swell the
surplus la the Treasury to SUO.iioO.OOu,
XOWBT CSKLESSLY SUBTKACTEO FKOM CHANNELS
or IHtVV.
There seems to be no aaaoranco that, with such
a withdrawal from use of the people's circulating
medium, our bualneas community may not in Ihe
near totuTa be subjected to the aamu distress
which waa quite iat ly producod from Ihe a .me
eauae. Ana while the functions or our Ntl nil
Treasury should be few sndslmple. and while lis bt at
condition nould be reached, 1 be. let e, by its eut re
disconnection with private boeluiaa Interests, yet
when, by a perveision of Its purposes, it idly holds
money uselessly subtracted from the channels of
trade, there seems to be reason lor Ihe claim that
somelegttlmate means should be devised by the
Government to restore lu sn emergency, without
waste or extravagance, such money to Its placo
amoni the people.
If auen an emergency arises there now exists no
elesr and undoubted executive power of relief.
Heretofore the redemption of I percent bonds,
which were payable at the option ot the Govern
ment, has afforded a means for the dlaburaement
of the excess of our revenues, bnt these bonds bsve
all been retired, and there are no bonds outstanding
the payment of which we havo tbo right to waist
aoixa ron the bviwlvh.
The rrctdmt it Jtight: Stop the tiurplui
and You hlojt the Jtaidtri,
?pon. Tho contribution to tho atnklng fund which
urulshes the occasion for expenditure In tho pur
chase of bonds has been already mods for the cur
rent year, so'lhat there Is no outlet In that direction.
In the preaent state of legislation the only pre
lcne of any existing executive power to restore,
at this time, any part of oar surplus revenues to
the people by Its expenditure, consists In the sup
position that ihe Secretary of the Treasury may
enter the market and purchase the bonds of the
noiernmentnotyctdueat a rate of premium to
be agreed upon. The only provision of law from
which such a power could bo derived Is found in
an appropriation bill passed a number ot ycara
ago; and it la subject to the suspicion that
It Tfs Intended as temporary and limited
In II application, Instead of conferring a
continuing disiretlun aud authority. Mo condition
oil lit to exist whlUi would Justify the grant of
power tn a alugte olTlclal, upon his Judument of lis
necessity, to withhold from or release to tho bual
noMsof the peoplo, In an unusual manner, money
held In the Treasury, and thus affect, at his will,
the flnmclal situation of the country; anil If It Is
deemed wlso to lodgo In tho Secretary of thoTreaa
ry the authority In the present Juncture to pur
chase bunds. It should ho plainly vested, and pro
vided as far as possible, wilh such checks and limi
tations aa will deflno this official's rtgnt aud dis
cretion, and at tho aauio time relieve him from
undue responsibility.
AT THE MKI1CT or BONDHOLDERS.
In considering tho question of purchasing bonds
as a means of restoring to circulation the surplus
money accumulating In the Trea.ury, It should be
boruu In mind that premiums muat of courao be
paid upon such purchase, that there may be a large
part of these bonds held aa Investments which can
not be purchase I at any price, and that combina
tions atnoug holders who are willing 10 sell msy
nnrenson.bly enhance tho cost ot such bonds to
the Uovernment.
I: has been suggested that the present bonded
debt might be refunded at a leas rate of Interest
and the dlfferenro between the old and new se
curity paid In cash, thus finding use for the sur
plus In the Treasury. The succcsa of this plan, it
is apparent, must depend upon the volition of lha
holders of me present bonds; snd It la not entirely
certain that the Inducement which must I offered
them would reault In moro financial benefit to
the Government than Ihe purchase of bonds, while
the latter proposition would reduce the principal
01 tho debt by actual payment, Instead of extend
ing It.
1 ho proposition to deposit the money held by the
Government In banks throughout ihe country for
use by the people is, It seems to me, exceedingly
oi'Jertlonable m principle, ua establishing too close
a relationship between the operations of the Uov
ernment Treasury aud the busluesa ot iho country,
and too cxtintlio a commingling of their money,
thus loitering un unnatural reliance In private
buslneai upon publlo funds. If this scheme should
b sdopted It should only be done ss a temporary
expedient to meet an urgent necessity. Legislative
nnd executive effort should generally be In the op
posite direction and should have a tendency to di
vorce, as much aud aa fast as can saiely tie done,
the Treasury Department from private enterprise.
Ol coarse, It Is not expected that unnecessary
and extravagant appropriations will be made for
the puipose of avoiding me accumulation of an ex
cess of revenue. Such expenditure, betide the de
moralization of all Jut conceptions of public duty
which II eutsl s, stimulates a nabit or reckless lui
provlilenco not In the lest consistent with the
mi.slon of our people or the high and beneficent
purposes of our Uovernment.
TUK SITUATION VIUIGUT WITH DANGER.
I have deemed It my duty to thus bring to the
knowledge ot my countrymen, us well ss to the at
tention of their repreientatlves charged with the
responsibility of legislative relief, the gravity ot
our financial situation. The Jailors ol the Con
gress heretofore to provide against the dangers
which it was quite evident the very nstureof me
difficulty must necesiarily produce caused a con
dition ot llu.ticlai distress uud spptehenslon since
your last udjournmeut which taxed to tbe utmost
nil the authority and expedients within executive
control, and these appear now to be exhausted.
If dlsksicr results I rum the continued Inaction of
Congieia, tho responsibility must rest where It
belongs.
Though tbe situation thus far considered Is
fraught vilth dauger which should be fully real
ized, and though It presents features of wrornr to
the people as ell as peril to the eouutry, It Is but
a result growing out of a perfectly palpable uud
apparent cause, constantly reproducing the same
uurmiug I'lrcuiustunuea a contested National
Treasury and a depleted monetary condition In tne
business of tne couutry. It neid hardly be stuled
that v hlle tbe present situation demands a remedy,
we can only be eaed from u like predicament la
the future by the removal of Ita cause.
Our scheme f taxation, by meant of which this
needless surplus Is taken from ihe peupla und put
Into the public Treasury, consists of a tariff or
duty levied upon importatlous from abroad and
Internal revenue tax, a levied upon the consump
tion of tobacco and spirituous mid malt liquors. It
must be conceded mat none of tho tiling, sun
jeeted o Internal revenue taxi Ion are, strictly
sieakiug, necessaries; there appears to be no Ju-.t
complaint of this taxatlou by the coosumira of
these articles, and there seems to be nothing so
we ab e to bear the burden without hardship to
any portion of the people.
