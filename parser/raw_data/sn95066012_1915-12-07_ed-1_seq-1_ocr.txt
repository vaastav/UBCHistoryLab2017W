And Won't Have Any More if I

RESENTS ATTITUDE OF ALLIES
Course of Entente Powers Practically
' an Accusation of
Treachery.
Athens, Dec. 6 Constantine I, kins
of the Greeks, received the corres
pondent of the Associated Tress at
Athens Saturday and gave him a nies
sage to America on the attitude which
Greece has assumed in the world war
and the reasons for the policy which
has been followed by the Greek ,gov
eminent.
"I am especially glad to talk for
America," said the king, "for America
will understand Greece's position. We
are both neutral and are together de
termined, if it is humanly possible,
not to court destruction by permitting
ourselves to be drawn into the fright
ful vortex of the present European
conflict. Both are trying by every hon
orable means to guard our sovereign
ty, protect our people and stand up
for our national interests without
sacrificing that neutrality which wo
recognize as our only salvation.
"America is protected from immed
iate danger by the distance which
separates her from the battlefield. We
too, thought that once. But the battle
field shifted and may shift again.
What is happening in Greece today
may happen In America, Holland or
any other country tomorrow, if the
precedent now sought to be establish
ed in the case of Greece is once fix
ed." "The fundamental cause of the en

in the "iiear"Kast;' Ortece's neutrality
has been 'stretched to the' utmost to
accommodate the entente powers, tor
whom we have always felt the keen
est sympathy and the keenest grati
tude. The Dardanelles operations
were directed from Greek islands, oc
cupied by allied troops. When Servia
was endangered by the combined
Austro-German and Bulgarian attack
the allied troops landed unopposed on
Greek soil, from which, with the sec

prosecuted, not only unmolested, but

any sort of neutrality, their fruitless
and too long delayed campaign to res

powers now demand, in a form which
is virtually au ultimatum, that the
Greek troops be withdrawn from Sal
onica ami that means all Macetlon
Ur leaving our population unprotect
ed against raids by Bulgarians and
Komitadjis or all tho horrors of war
which: lay Belgium waste, should the
allies be driven back within our
frontiers.
"Just suppose that the Germans
were in a position to demand that
your country concede tho use of
Boston or Seattle as the base of an
attack on Canada. What would you
say? And if all your military exper
ience and the advice of your general
staff told you that such a landing was
doomed to failure because made with
an Inadequate force and you realized
that the British troops in Canada
would pursue the retreating Germans
across New Kngland, destroying as
they went, you would accept the pros
pect without a strugle?"
"But had not your majesty German
assurance that the integrity of Greek
territory would be respected?" the
king was asked.
"Of course and entente assurances,
too."
"And similar assurances from Bul
garia? '
"Germany," said the king, "has giv
en , assurance for herself and her al
lies. But that does not prevent the
German-Bulgarian armies as a meas
ure of military necessity, from pursu
ing the retiring French and British
forces into Greece and turning Greece
into a second Poland. I have that as
surance also.
"That the Greek frontiers will be re
erected after the war does not re
build towns or compensate my people
for months, perhaps years, spent in
living in misery as fugitives from
their own land when their own
country is not at war and has nothing
to gain by risking devastation.
'Why, the entente powers treat me
as If I were the king of a central
African tribe, to whom the sufferings
of his own people were a matter of in
difference. I have been through three
wars. I know what war is. I dc not
want any more if it can be honorably
avoided. My people do not want any
more, and if they and i can help it,
wo shall not have any more."

HIGHER PRICED GASOLINE
Next Year $180,000,000 May Be Added
to Cost of Motoring.
Passengers and commercial cars
sold. in tho United States in the year
elided June last totaled more than
tyl.OOO. Close to 2,100,000 cars were
icensed in this couutry for 1915. Au
tomobile authorities figure each car
consumes 500 gallons of. gasoline a
ear. At that rate ,. automobiles in
use in this country are consuming
over 1,000,000,000 gailous annually. It
may amount to 1,500,000,000 gallons
iri 191C. ".'.'...,'.
In addition to use by automobiles
it is figured gasoline is now consum
ed at the rate of perhaps 500,000,000
gallons a year for other purposes.
ThiB would make total consumption
this year in excess of 1,500,000,000
gallons. Next year it may possibly
exceed 2,000,000,000. In 1910 con
sumption of gasoline by automobiles
was but 225,000.000 gallons, so that
the Increase in five years has been
over 300 per cent.
Even though prices rise no higher,
the cost of motoring In this country
In 1926 is apt to be about $280,000,000
njore for propulsion than this year, of
which $100,000,000 will represent en
hanced prices of gasoline, and $80,
Ofin.OOU the cost or consumption by
new cars.

PRESIDENT URGES
STERN ACTION IN
PLOT CASES
No Law Now to Punish Offenders
Igainst Neutrality
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS BEAD
Wants Army and Navy Enlarged and
Would Pay Cost by Increasing
Internal Revenue.
Washington. Dec. 7.-r-President
Wilson today read his message before
the: two houses of congress. ' The
message was short and was largely
devoted to the question of prepared
ness.
He urges the Increase of the stand
ing army to 141,843 men and by: the
addition of 52 companies of coast ar
tillery, 15 corupanieu of engineers,
ten regiments of infantry,-' four regi
ments of field artillery, and four tfero
squadron. These he urges as the first
step and said he 'will later advise In
crease of the militia.
The naval plan he outlines is an
addition during the next five years of
ten battleships, six battle crulseriS
ten scout cruisers, 50 destroyers,- fif
teen fleet submarines, 85 coaBt sub
marines, four gunboats, two ammuni
tion ships and one hospital ship.
He says that more money will bo
needed to pay the bills and would
raise this by Increase! taxes rather
than by selling bonds. He suggests
way of getting more . money: to
make the Increase tax apply to smal-
er incomes, a tax on gasolene, a tax
of 50 cents per horse-power on auto
mobiles. A stamp tax on bank
checks and a tax on pig iron and on
labricated iron and steel.
He says: "There are citizens of
the United Slates, 1 blush "to admit,
born under other flags, but welcomed
under our Kciterotis . naturalisation
laws to the full freedom and oppor
tunity of America, who have poured
the poison of disloyalty into the very
arteries of our national life; who
have sought to bring the authority
and good name of our government in
to contempt, to destroy our industries
wherever they have thought it effec
tive. to strike at thorn, and to debase
our politics to the uses of foreign
intrigue.
"Their number is not great, but it
is great enough to have brought dis
grace upon us and to have made It
neeet'sary that we should -promptly
make use of processes of law by
which Ave may be purged of their
corrupt distempers.
"A little while ago such a thing
would have seemed Incredible. Be
cause it was incredible we made no
pteparation for It. But the ugly and
incredible thing has actually come
about and we are without adequate
federal laws to deal with it. I urge
you to enact such laws at tho earliest
possible moment and feel that In do
iiif,' so 1 am urging you to do nothing
loss than save the honor and self
respect of the nation. Such creatures
of passion, disloyalty and anarchy
must be crushed out. They are not
many, but they areinfinitely malig
nant, and-the hand ' of our power
should close over them at once. They
have formed plots to destroy proper-1
ty, they have entered into conspirac
ies against the neutrality of the Gov
renment, they have sought to pry into
every confidential transaction of the
Government iu order to serve inter
ests alien to our own. It is possible
to deal with these things very effectu
ally. I need not suggest the terms in
which they may be dealt with.
"I wish that It could be said that
only a few men, misled by mistaken
sentiments of allegiance to the gov
ernments under which they were
born, had been guilty of disturbing
the self-possession and misrepresent
ing the temper and principles of the
country during these day of terrible
war, when it would seem that every
man who was truly American would
instinctively make it his duty and
his pride to keep the scales of judg
ment even and prove himself a par
tisan of no nation but his own. But
It. cannot. There are some men
among us, and many resident abroad
who. though born and I red in the
United States and calling themselves
Americans, have so forgotten them
selves and . their honor as citizens as
to put their passionate sympathy with
one or the other side in the great
Kuropean conflict above their regard
for the peace and dignity of the
United States. They also preach and
practice disloyalty. No laws, I sup
pose, cau reach corruptions of the
mind and heart; but I should not
speak of others without also speaking
of these and expresslnu the even

Nearly all of the members of the
Bennington county bar were present.
according to custom on opening day.
The calling of the docket showed
that attorneys had been busy during
the past few days completing adjust
ments of difficulties between their
clients and a number of cases were
announced to be settled and discon
tinued.
While it has been necessary to rush
the work on the changes that has
been made in tho court room the re
pairs were completed on time and
the improved appearance in the court
room Itself and in the retiring room
for the attorneys was the subject for
favorable comment.
One of -the interesting cases on the

forth the facts as to the objectionable
activities of Captain Boy-Ed, Naval
Tttache, and Captain Frana von Pa
pen, Military Attache of the German
Embassy which havo rendered them
persna non gratae and resulted in
the, request for their immediate re
call.
Nor will the American Government
disclose to tho German Government
the sources of the fnformatioa on
which was based ; the decision that
the two attaches could no longer be
considered acceptable to this Govern
ment Emphatic assurance, that this Gov
ernment had-taken this position in
the Boy-Ed and von Papen cases was
given in an informal but nonetheless
authoritative way tonight
According to the position taken by
the State Department it , is wholly
within the province of any Govern
ment to request the recall of a diplo
mat who may be considered persona
non grata. It is also held by the
United States Government that it is
not required under any rules of inter
national relations or practice to state
the reason for asking the . recall.
While it is true that the reasons for
requesting that diploonata be recalled
are sometimes stated, it is the posi
tion of the United States Govern
ment, at this time, that the stating of
reasons Is not required and very of
ten is not warranted.

'rompt action by the firemen saved
much of the stock and gooda as well
as the buildings adjoining.
Tho cause of the blaze is unknown.
Chief Harry B. Spear saya that when
he entered the store with a lantern
rawllng under the heavy . pall of
smoke which filled the apartment, he
found the flames burning vigorously
on a keg of cork sittings commonly
utilized to pack white grapes and In
which it Is believed the blaza started.
An alarm was sounded from Box 48
by Chief Brazil after a passerby noted
blaze flickering in the rear of the
store. The firemen were quick in re
sponding, all the companies being cal
led out, and the release was rung in
within 25 minutes.
The stock and fixtures were well
gutted and the largo pane of plate
glass in the south window smashed.
The proprietor, M. Betor, knew noth
ing of the blaze until ho was called
after the fire was out. The I-osa to
building and stock is estimated at
about $1000 mostly covered by insur
ance.
Neighboring merchants have noth
ing, but praise for the firemen this
morning for saving the surrounding
stores for the flames and water were
kept strictly within the candy store
and tho fire merely scorched the
apartment overhead. The peculiar
construction of tho buildings along
North atreet at this point gave loca
tion for a serious fire If prompt action
had not been forthcoming.
