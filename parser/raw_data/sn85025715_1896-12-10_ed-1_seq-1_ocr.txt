San Pedro, sheltered behind stone walls,
etc.. though the Spanish troops hud
been under (Ire of detachments of rebels
tor some time before coming up to the
main body.
DESPERATE FIGHTING.
Thie Spaniards charged with fixed bay?
onets, and desperate lighting at clnse
quarters ensued, lasting until night.
The Spaniards then retired to Punta
Brava, having exhausted their ammu?
nition and lost a number of men. Dur
Ip? the reconnolssance upwards of forty
dead rebels were found, among them two
bodies, which were undoubtedly those
of Antrinlo Maceo, the Insurgent leader,
and a son of General Maximo Gomez.
Upon the body of Maceo were found a
revolver and a drinking cup. and upon
his harkd a ring Inscribed "Antonio and
M-aria." His clothing was of a line tex?

AI." The man was a mulatto, with hair
and moustache slightly tinged with
gray.

In his coat wus found a small diary
containing a sketch of the operations
covering the period from Nov. 27 to Dec.

"Dec. 2?Left to explore t roch a, and
cm 4th passed It. joining forces with
Lieut. Vasquez on Mb: Colonels Acoasta
and Sartorlus on Cth, and Sanchez on

The other man was white, and was
not more than 18 or 20 years old. .lust
before he died he had scribbled with a
pencil on n bit or paper: ' I die, as I will
not * abandon the corpse of General
Maceo." His clothiriji bore the Initials

Madrid. Dec. 9.?The general opinion
here Is that the references to Cuba and
Spain contained In President Cleveland's
message to Congress show that It is the
Intention of the United Slates to con?
form more and more to the Monroe doc?
trine every time a case arises to which
the principle is applicable.
The Cabinet, aft^r debating the text
of the message to-day. will form some
definite Judgment, which, it is believed,
will result In a. modification of the re?
lations of Spain with the United States.
The Heraldo says the President's
message foreshadows the Intervention
of the United States In Cuba In March
next, but adds that Spnin will repel the
arrogance of the American Government.
Confirmed from Mn<lrl<l.
Madrid, Dec. 0.?The Government has
received oiliclal confirmation of the
death of the Cuban Insurgent leader,
Antonio Maceo. The details, as report?

those telegraphed to the Imparcial.
HOW THE FIGHT WAS "FIXED."

San Francisco, Doc. 9.?A large as?
semblage of ring followers and men
about-town crowded Judge Sanderson's
court-room this morning in expectation
of hearing sensational developments
regarding the manner In which the
Fltsslmmons-Sharkey prize fight was
"fixed," and they were not disappointed.
If credence Is to he placed In the story
told on the witness s and by "Austral

They claim thai Smith demanded $1.000
for his services as trainer and declined
to accept the $100 tendo od him. Allen,
who pr im.se I to corroborate SmfTh's tes?
timony to-morrow, was offered $2fio. but

Lynch into paying hint double Hut
amount.
TOM N II V It K !'. Y SCED.
FitS*N Lawyer I? Trying to Simplify
'I hinan.
San Francisco. Dec. 9.?Col. H. I. Ko?
walski, the b^nl representative of p.ob
Fltsslmmona has brought suit directly
against Tom sharkey to recover $10.000
whl< h the defendant Is alleged to be
withholding from th<? rightful owner.
"This action" explained Col. Kowalski,
"can settled the whole question In short.
If Sharkey, F.arp, Lynch and that clique
are In the right they can got it and prove
.1. If they me In the wiong they will bring
u;i some techlcsllty and cause delay.
"We will appear before Judge Sander
sou and produce our witnesses: we will
?how thai there wasaconsphacy,by which
Fltsslmmona was robbed of $10,000 and the
evidence which we have in our posses?
sion Is overwhelming. The reason we <?<..
sire to put our case before the conn is
that witnesses in affairs . t this kind are
of a migratory character. Their business
calls tloui away. While they are here
we want to hei r tb. !r testimony Instead
of having to delay matters by having to
send out of the State for depositions, if
the Lynch-Sharkey side wishes to not in
good faith and hopes to pronerii a clear
case, it can produce Its evidence cither to?
day or tomorrow, There is no reason for
the delay in tl? matter. Either Filzsim

vice versa.

The most notable social event of the
season, certainly the most unique nnd
attractive, was the reception given last

in honor of the 121st anniversary of the
Battle or Great Billige, which was
r"tight near this city on December 9,
177G.
The annual reception or the Daugh?
ters in honor or the anniversary of ih?
historic event has become a fixed social
feature or every season, and Is always
eagerly anticipated.
LOVELY DECORATIONS.
Last evening, however, the chapter lit?
erally outdid itself. The lovely home of
Its registrar, Mrs. John Graham, cor?
ner of Pembroke and Colonial avenues.
Ghent, had been tendered for the event
and It was decorated in the most beauti?
ful and artistic style. Deri fingers
had Interwoven into chandelier and
bracket and mantel a profusion of Ivy
and smilax and festoons of other lovely,
Vines which made hall, parlor, ami
dining room veritable bowers <>f fresh?
ness and verdure. French bow-knots,
deftly done In Ivy sprays, hung about
the doorways. Ropes of verdant green
leaves were festooned above the win?
dow.", and In the hallway was a lovely
wreath inclosing the historic date
"we celebrate" In gold letters, "Decem?
ber 9, I77fi." The decorations were ;.u
in "Empire" style and were most beau?
tiful.
DAINTY REFRESHMENTS.
Especially lovely was the dining-room
where everything was eerved In true
colonial style. The apartment was
lighted by candles placed In silver can?
dle '?IJcks. and there, as elsewhere, \ve:e
lovely ftowens and wreaths and ropes
of ttreen.
The menu was a lavish variety of
il.ilr. lv.-. prepared in beautiful style;
many of the delicious salads and Ices
being the creations of the fair hands of
those of the daughters who laughingly
style themselves "Kitchen K.its."
COLONIAL COSTUMES.
But the loveliest feature.* of the recep?
tion were the daughters themselves. Ar?
rayed in colonial gowns or gorgeous de?
sign and OO tly material, and With hair
powdeted, they wen- lovely counter?
parts of the miniatures of their ances?
tors of long ago, which aome of them
wore as ornaments.

BISHOP RANDOLPH'S ADDRESS.
The feature of ih>- evening was an ad?
dress by Right Rev Alfred Magill Ran?
dolph, BLhop of Southern Virginia, or.
"Colonial and R volutlonaty History."
The Bishop's remarks were a-: follows.
"When I think of the American revo?
lution, and of the history <>( thai re?
markable era which you are trying to
keep gteen In the memory of ithe pres?
ent generation, 1 think of it as, more
than any other, an era of great men,
and if of great men, neco.'sarlly an era
of great women to lay the foundation or
their great nets and to train them for
their wor'.t. The memotyof greail men
is. perhajis, the largest contribution that
history makes to human civilization.
The true concept! its of a great man,
I leparaited from falso nnd ignoble con?
ceptions, are among the highest Inspi?
rations to the life of every generation.
Thuik of it f >r a moment.
GREATNESS DI:FINED.
I "What Ls a gieat man? You reply
there are two kinds >>:' great men?one
great In thought; another great In ac?
tion. The poet, the scientist, and the
philosopher are all great men In their
sphere; that of thought.
MEN OF ACTION.
"But the kind of mm that enlists our
deepest sympathy one who Ins an?
other kind of greatne-s than the great
neza of though ,. The man of action, the
man of character, the man who not only
thinks but d u.-; who not only see what
Is right, but love- It with his wh lie
heart: who not only paints an Idea of
?the true and the good man upon (.-:i:i
v* a, or .lings It in verse, but the nun
who lives tor It and. if need be, dies for
It. Bacon was the great eil thinker that
the modern world has produced, but a

the possibility of Intellectual kingship

METHODIST MISSIONARY WOHK
Rev. Morrison 'Voll? ?I (In I'rogreas in
Mexico mill Itrnzll.
The main auditorium of Epworth M.
E. Church was well filled la si evening
oa the occasion of an address by Rev,
H. c. .Morrison, missionary secretary of
the Methodist church, South, on mls
sionary work In Mexico ami Brasil,
Mr. Morrison Is of Imposing person
and he Illustrated his points with sim?
ple but well limed gestures, which make
him quite an attractive speaker. lie
has the advantage over ordinary mis?
sionary managers, who handle their
Heids through the malls, in thut he has
personally visited every nook and corner
of the countries aboul which he speaks.
Last evening be used a couple of
maps procured lit Mexico und Brasil re?
spectively, to Illustrate his talk. He
devoted himself entirely to descriptive
and explanatory style and told his
hearers all about the customs and re?
sources of the countries In which their
missionaries nie working.
Mexico, said he. lying directly to the
south of us. is or deep Interest to Ameri?
cans. The Methodist church was among
the (Irst to send missionaries there.
The Inhabitants of Mexico, being
Spaintnrds and American Indians, he
declared, were not hard to deal with In
a missionary spirit, but on the contrary
they seemed eager to enter the schools
the missionaries have established. There
arc many of these Institutions In Mexico,
he said, and each ono Is doing a valiant
and valuable work. Methodist school
property In Mexico alone is worth $2i0,
000.
The speaker drew an inviting picture
of Mexico us a Held for young missiona?
ries.
Itrnzll, he said, is a most successful
field. Its population Is 1C,,(ki0 nnd is
mostly congregated near the Southeast?
ern corner of the country. Here tin
work Is b?ing done. He thought Brazil
a better Held than Mexico because the
people, b?lng of Portugese extraction,
are more stable of character thun their
hot-blooded Spanish cousins.
Mr. Morrison took a roseate view of
the mission work, which he said should
be very near to the heart of all church
people. He closed with an appeal for
continued hearty support of the South?
ern mission Held.
