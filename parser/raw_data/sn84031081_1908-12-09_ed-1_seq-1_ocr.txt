tlie body of Maggie (Jarcia to the
house where the other members of
her family had been murdered, but
left Martinez's body at the spot where
lie killed the girl and himself.
The condition of the girl's body
proves beyond a doubt that she re
sisted the fiend to the last. Her cloth
ing was torn until it hung in rags;
her body was cut and bruised in doz
ens of places and even her shoes were
torn and cut end blood marked her
trail. It was the crimson footprints
of the girl which led the pursuers at!
last to the two bodies.
For four days arid five nights the
girl had been ill the hands of the
llend who m ordered her family, and
during that time the pair had nothing
to eat hut one loaf of bread, which
Martinez secured on Saturday after
noon at a raneh. They had covered
only twenty-Mix miles from the scene
of the murders, but they must have
walked several times that distance to
elude pursuit.

Washington, Dec. t. An emergency
volunteer army measure was advo
cated today by President Hoosevelt In
a snccial message ent lo congress,
and (he draft of the bill accompany
ing the inossiiip' was Introduced in the
senate by Mr. Clilioin. The president
says Ihe hill Ik Intended to replace the
present law which was placed on the
statute books "piecemeal and hurried
ly, partly on Ihe eve of war with
Spain, and partly after hostilities hud
actually commenced."
After de lining the present law to
be faulty and ivhnllj Inadequate to a
speedy and proper organization nf a
volunteer force, the president say.s the
hill proposed, which was drawn nnihr
superv ision of the chief of staff of tha
army, lias the hearty approval of th.,
w ar depa ii ment. The message ra"
rurther:
"It is designed to afford the rom
Píete machinery by which should we
be confronted with a foreign war, the
executive power could proceed at once
to transform ciithuslnatle and patri
otic citizens luto efficient and orgnn
l.'.ed soldb rs. Happily at P resent there
is no cloud on Ihe horl.on, but thai
very fact affords us tin- very best op
port unity to proci i d with care and de
liberation In the preparation of laws
adeiiuiite and indispensable for our
possinl,. v need".
It Is pointed out by the president
that the proposed measure would not
eail lor a dollar's expenditure during
iho veats of peace and in Its enact
iiii nt into law now would "merely be
