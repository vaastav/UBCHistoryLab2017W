The President's Message,
president Arthur's message was given
to the Senate and House on the aseenib
lin? of those bodies on Monday last. The
message is an able and exhaustive docu
ment, and notably a desire to impress
opon the Republican party its only hope
of recovering its power and prestige is to
change, and adapt a rigid economy in ex
penditures. A large portion of the mes
sage is taken up with a review of our
foreign affairs, but our space will only ad
mit of a few notes and extracts on the
more important subjects. In respect to
the coinage of the silver dollars, the
President says the mass of accumulated
coin has grown so great, the vault room
is scarcely sufficient to contain it ; of the
one hundred and twenty eight millions
thub far minted, little more than thirty
fire millions are in circulation. He re
commends an immediate and extensive
reduction in the amount of -revenues of
the government; only such taxes ought to
be levied as are necessary for a wise
economical administration of the govern
ment. That the rapid extinguishment of
the public debt is not desirable ; ex
perience has taught that swollen revenues
will be devoted to extravagant expendi
tures. Regrets that the conflicting views
the abolition of all internal revenue taxes,
except those on tobacco, distilled spirits
and fermented liquors. He now suggests
that all internal taxes, save distilled spirits,
can be prudently abrogated, accompanied
by a simplification of the machinery of
o.nnlfl rp.n1f in rotir.mani .

dollars. The system of excise duties has
never commended itself to the favor of the
American people, and only resorted too to
supply deficiencies in the treasury.
"The sentiment of the country doubt
less demand, that tho present excise tax
shall be abolished, as Boon as such a
course can safely be pursued. It seems
to me, however, that, for various reasons,
so sweeping a measure as the total aboli-
Hon ot internal taxes would, for the
O I
present, oe an unwise step. Two ot the
reasons are deserving of special mention :
First, it is by no means clear that, even if
is continued without modification, these
duties alone will yield sufficient revenue
for all the needs of the government. It
is estimated that one hundred millions of
dollars will bo required for pensions dur
ing the coming year, and it may well be
doubted whether the, maximum annual
demand for that object has yet been
reached. Uncertainty upon this question
would alone justify, in my judgment, the
retention for the present, of that portion
of the system of internal revenue which is
least objectionable to the people. Second,
a total abolition of excise taxes would al
most inevitably prove a serious, if not an

insurmountable obstacle to a thorough re-1
vision of the tariff and to any considerable I
reduction in import duties. The present
tariff system is, in many respects, unjust.
It makes unequal distributions, both of its
burdens and its benefits."
While recommending a reduction of the
revenue tax, he advises a policy of dis-
I
criminating in the adjustment Gf details,
aa to attorn a.ia and nrot.pnt.ion to nnmpatin I
i
labor, equalize the public burden among
all classes and occupations, and bring it
into closer harmony with the present need
of industry. He recommends an enlarge
ment of the free lists, a deduction of du-
ties on certain manufacture, particularly
' F . , , 3
cotton, iron, steel and a substantial reduc
tion of the duties on Bugar, molasses, silk,
wool and woolen goods. He favors the
adoption of the Dutch standard of color
as a test of the saccharine strength of
sugar.

sage on the - internal revenue as being of
more general interest than other subjects.

a bill ot appropriations a diversity of ob
. a 1 1 TT 1 .
jects widely separated in their nature and
locality, as tending to the success of the
bill as a whole, though many items if
separately considered would be rejected.
He commends an amendment to the con
stitution, that the Executive may disap
prove any item or items of law appro
priating money, whereupon the part ap
proved shall be law and the part disap
proved shall fail to become law.
He has instructed the Attorney General
to prosecute the star routers with the ut
most vigor, that if any guilty person es
cape it will not be from lack of earnest
efforts ou the part of the proseoution. He
asks the consideration of Congress to the
question of granting aid to the States and
Territories in behalf of education. Calls
attention to the great benefits of the for
ests still remaining on the public do-
main, especially in the extreme Western
States and Territories, in modifying the
extremes of climate, and their importance
to the' growth and pjosperity of the coun-
iry; mac itiey will soon become extinct!

prevailing dryness of the climate renders
their restoration impossible.
The civil list at this time embraces one
hundred thousand persons, most of whom
are selected by and through the Presi-

Nobtii Caeolixa is not the onlv State
where money was expended for election
purposes. The editor of a paper in Den-
ver when asked if much money was spent
in politics in Colorado, replied : "Ob, no,
not very much. Chaffee of the Republi
can committee only spent $33,000, and
Patterson of the Democratic committee
$25,000. Then it cost Tabor something
like $20,000 trying to elect a Legislature
favorable to his Senatorial aspirations,
while Senator Hill and Wolcott disbursed
some $40,000 to beat Chaffee and Tabor.
So altogether, you see, not over $125,000
to $140,000 were put in circulation to run
the campaign."
The investigating committee, Senator
Vance chairman, closed its labors last
week. During the sessions at Morgan-
ton and Dallas, some of the facts es-
tablished by witnesses, prove gross
violations of the revenue laws, and

printed, is o outer newspaper published on thia side
of the carta haa been bought and read in any year by
ao many men and women.
We are credibly informed that people bay. read and
lUce Tac Stjji for the following reasons, among' oth
ers: Because Its news columns nresent in attractive
form and with the greatest possible accuracy whatev
er has interest for humankind; the events, the deeda
and misdeeds, the wisdom, the philosophy, the not-
ble folly, the solid sense, the improving; nonsense all
the news of lhe busiest world at present revolving: in
space.
Because people have learned that in its remarks
concerning- persons and affairs The Sun makes a
practice of telling them the exact truth to the best of
its ability three hundred and sixty five days in the
year, before election ae well as after, about the
whales aa well as about the small fish, in the face of
dissent aa plainly and fearlessly aa when supported by
general approval. TmUuxhas absolutely no pur
poses to serve, save the information of it readers and
the futheranee of the common good.
Because in politics it has fought for a ' dozen years,
without Intermission and sometimes almost alone
among- newspapers, the fight that has resulted in the
neABt OTenrhelmliir mnular irm-riir xralnat Dak..
I sonism and for honest government. No matter what
party is in power. Tub Huk stands and wUl continue
to stand like a Mux (or tha iateraaia nf that nani.
agaiuat the ambition of bosses, the encroachments of
monopolists, and the dishonest schemes of publio
robbers.
All thia is what we are told almost daily by our
friends. One man holds that Tna8cw is the bestrew
ligtoua newspaper ever published, because its Chris
tianity ia undiluted with cant. Another holds that it
ia the best Republican newspaper printed, because it
has already whipped half of the rascal out of that
party, and is proceeding against the other half with
Brtdiminishea vigor.
If you already knew Tbx Self, you will observe that
ul8S3 it is a little better than ever before. If yon
do not already knew Tbk 8ujc, you will find it to be a
mirror of all human activity, a storehouse of the
cboieest products of common sense and imagination,
a mains tar for the cause of honest government, a
sentinel of genuine Jeffersoaiaa Democracy scour?
for wickedness of every species, and an uncommonly
good investment for the coming year. . .
