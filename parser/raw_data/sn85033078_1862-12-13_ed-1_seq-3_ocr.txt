lISTORY OF TEE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PENINSULA
McClellan’s Protest and Halleck’s Reply
Among the important papers presented
in Gen. Halleck s recent report is the
following correspondence. Gen. McClel
lan’s letter is a protest against the order
U withdraw from the Peninsula. Gen.
Halleck s reply throws a flood of light
upon many points heretofore more or less
obscure:
Berkley, Aug. 4th, 1852—12 M.
[ln cypher to Maj. Gen. Halleck, Com
mander in Chief:J
Yonr telegram of last evening is re
ceived. I must confess that it has caused
me the greatest pain I ever experienced,
for I am convinced that the order to with
draw the army to Aqnia Creek will prove
disastrous in the extreme to our cause.
I fear it will be a fatal blow. Several
days are necessary to complete the ar
rangement for so important a movement
as this, and while they are in progress I
beg that careful consideration may be
given to my statement. This army is now
in excellent discipline and condition. We
hold a debouche on both banks of the
James River, we arc; free to act in any
direction, and with the assistance of the
gunboats I consider our communication as
now secure.
We are now tw:-nty five miles from
Richmond, and are not likely to meet the
enemy in force sufficient to fight a battle
until we have reached fifteen or twenty
miles nearer, which brings us practically
within ten miles ot Richmond. Our long
est line ot land transportation would ne
from this point twenty five miles, but with
the aid of gunboats we can supply the
army by water during its advance certain
ly to within twelve miles of Richmond.
At Aquia Creek we would be seventy
five miles from Richmond, with land
transportation all the way. From here to
Fort Monroe is a march ot about seventy
miles, for 1 regard it as impracticable to
withdraw this army and its material ex
cept by land, the result of the movement
would be to march 135 milts to reach a
point now only twenty-five miles distant,
and to deprive ourselves entirely ot the
powerful aids of gunboats and other trans
portation, and to these the certain de
moralization of the army, which would
ensue, the terrible depressing effect upon
the people of the North, and the stern
probability that it would influence foreign
powers to recognize our adversaries.—
There appears to me sufficient reasons to
make it my imperative duty to urge in the
strongest terms afforded by our language,
that this order may be revoked, and that
Bo far from recalling this army it he
promptly reinforced to enable it to resume
the offensive. It may ho said there are
no reinforcements available. I point to
Gen. Burnside’s forces, to that of Gen.
Pope, not necessary to maintain a strict
defense of Washington and Harper’s Fer
ry ; to those portions of the army of the
West not required for a strict defense
there.
Here, directly in front of the army, is
the heart of rebellion. It is here that all
our resources should be collected to strike
the blow which shall determine the fate
ol this nation. All points of secondary
importance elsewhere should he abandon
ed, and every available man brought here.
A decided victory here, and the military
strength of the rebellion would be crush
ed. It matters not what partial reverses
we may meet witli elsewhere, here is the
true defense of Washington. It is here
on the bank of the James River that the
fate ot the Union should be decided.
Clear in my convictions of right, strong
in the consciousness that I have ever been,
and still am, actuated solely by love of my
country, knowing that no ambitious or sol
fish motives have influenced me trom the
commencement of this war, 1 now do what
1 never did in my life—l entreat that order
may bo rescinded.
It my counsel does not prevail I will,
with a sad heart, obey your orders to the
utmost of my power, devoting to the
movement, one ot the utmost delicacy and
and difficulty, whatever skill J may pos
sess, whatever the result may be ; aud may
God grant that I am mistaken in my fore
bodings. 1 shall at least have the satisfac
tion that 1 have written and spoken frank
ly, and have sought to do the best in my
piower to arrest disaster from my country.
(Signed) G. 13. McClellan, Maj. Gen.
(Otlicial Copy.) Headquarters Army,
Washington, 1). C., Nov. 23, 1802,
To this Ualleck returned the following:
Washington, Aug. 0, 1802.
Mujor-Goneral McClellan, commanding*
Ac., Berkeley, Va.:
General: Your telegram of yesterday
was received this morning, and 1 immedi
ately telegraphed a brief reply, promising
to write you more I ally by mail. You,
General, certainly, could not have been
more pained at receiving my order than I
was at the necessity of issuing it. I was
advised by high officials in who-o judg
ment 1 had great confidence to make the
order immediately on my arrival here,
but 1 determined not to do so until 1 could
learn your wishes from a personal inter
view. I tried every way to avoid with
drawing your army, and delayed my de
cision so long as 1 dared to delay it. I
assure you, General, it was not a heartless
aud inconsiderate act, but one that
caused me mere anxious thought titan any
other of my lile, but alter full and mature
consideration ot ail the pros and cons., 1
was reluctantly forced to the conclusion
that the order must bo issued. Allow me
to allude to a few facts of the case- You
aud your officers at our interview estima
ted the enemy’s torces in and around
Richmond at 200,000 men, since then yon
and others report that they have received
and are receiving large reinforcements
from the South. Gen. Pope’s army now
covering Washington is only 40,000. Your
effective force is only about 00,000. You
are only thirty-live miles from Richmond,
and Gen. Pope eighty or ninety, with the
enemy directly between you, ready to
fall with his superior numbers upon
one or the other, as he may ele t. —
Neither can reinforce the other in
case ot such an attack. If Pope’sjbe des
tined to reinforce you, Washington, Mary
land and Pennsylvania would be left un
covered and exposed. It your force be
reduced to strengthen Pope, you would be
too weak to ever hold the position you
now occupy, should the enemy turn around
and attack you in full force; in other
words the old army of the Potomac is
split iu two parts, with the entire force of
the enemy directly between them. They
cannot be united by land witnout exposing
both to destruction, and yet they must be
united. To send Pope’s torces by water
to the Peninsula is under present circum
stances a military impossibility. The on
ly alternative is to send the forces on the
Peninsula to some point by water—say
Fredericksburg—where the two armies
cau be united.
Let me now allude to some of the objec
tions which you have urged. You say
that to withdraw from thepresent position
will cause the certain demoralization ot
the army, which is now in excellent disci
pline and condition. I cannot understand
why a simple change of position to new
aud bj no means distant base will demor
alize an army in excellent discipline, un
less officers themselves assist in the de
moralization, which I am satisfied they
will not.
Your change of front from your ex
treiae right, at Hanover Court House, to
your present position, was over thirty
miles. But I have not heard that it de
moralized your troops, notwithstanding
the severe losses thev sustained in effect
ing it.
Anew base on the Rappahannock, at
Fredericksburg, brings you wiihin about
sixty miles of Richmond, and secures a
reinforcement of 40,000 or 50,000 fresh
and disciplined troops, Ihe change, with
encli advantages will, I think, if properly
presented to your army, encourage rather
than demoralize your troops. Moreover,
yon yourself suggested that a junction
might be effected at Yorktown, but that
a flank march across the Peninsula would
be more hazardous than to retire to Fort
Monroe.
Yon will remember that Yorktown is
two or three miles further from Richmond
than Fredericksburg is. Besides the lat
ter is between Richmond and Washington
and covers Washington from any attack
by the enemy. The political effect of the
withdrawal may at first be unfavorable,
but I think the public are beginning to un
derstand its necessity, and that they will
have more confidence in a united army
than in the separate Iragments.
But you will reply, why not reinforce
here, so that I can strike R'chrno .and from
my position. To do this, you said, at our
interview, that you required 50,000 addi
tional troops. I told you that it was im
possible to give you so many. You finally
thought you would have some chance of
success with 20,000, but you afterwards
telegraphed that you would require 35,000
as the enemy was being largely reinforced.
If your estimate of the enemy’s strength
was correct, your requisition was perfect
ly reasonable; but it was utterly impossi
ble to fill it until new troops could be en
listed and organized, which would require
several weeks.
To keep your army in its present posi
tion until it could be reinforced, would
almost destroy it. In that climate, the
months of August and September are
almost fata! to whites on that part of the
James River, and even after you got the
reinforcements a-ked for, yen admitted
that you most reduce Fort Darling and
tiie river batteries before you could ad
vance on Richmond,
Is is by no means certain that the re
duction of the fortifications would not re
quire as much as those at Yorktown, this
delay might not only be fatal to the health
of your army, but in the mean time Gen.
Pope’s forces would be exposed to the
heavy blows of the enemy without the
slightest hope of assistance from you.
In regard to the demoralizing effect of a
withduwal from the Peninsula to the
Rappahannock, 1 must remark, that a
large number of your highest officers, in
deed, a majority of those whose opinions
have been reported to me, are decidedly
in favor of the movement. Even several
ot them who originally advocated the line
of the Peninsula, now advise abandon
ment.
I have not inquired, and do not desire
to know by whose advice, or lor what
reasons the army of the Potomac was sep
arated into two parts, with the enemy be
tween them, I must take things as 1 find
them. I find the force divided, and I
wish to unite them. The only feasible
plan has been presented for doing this.
If you or any one else had presented a
better one, 1 certainly should have adopt
ed it; but allot your plans reouire rein
forcements, which it is impossible to give
you. It is so very easy to ask for rein
forcements, but it is not so easy to give
them when you have no disposition of
troops at your command.
1 have written very plainly, as I under
stand the case, and 1 hope you will give
me credit for having considered the mat
ter, although I may have arrived at differ
ent conclusions from your own.
Very respectfully, your obedient serv’t,
[Signed,) H. W. Halleck,
Ganerai-in-Ohief.
Gen. Halleck states that about this time
he received news of a heavy rebel force
preparing to attack Pope, and menace the
capital. He thereupon sent urgent mes
sages to McClellan, but still the evacuation
1 of Harrison’s Landing was not commenced
till eleven days after.
United Stales Navy—Report of Secretary
Welles.
The material portion of Secretary
Welles’ annual report is his accou.it of tiie
growth and present strength of the navy,
and the effectiveness ot it in enforcing the
blockade and keeping the ocean clear of
privateers. When Mr. Welles assumed
charge of the Navy Department in March,
1861, there were but 42 vessels then in
commission, and most of them abroad.
There were only 7,600 seamen then in the
pay of the Government, and on the 10th of
March, only 207 iu all the ports and re
ceiving-ships of the Atlantic coast, to man
our ships aud protect the Navy-yards and
depots, and aid in suppressing the rising
insurrection. At the present time, by pur
chase and by construction, the Govern
ment has afloat, or progressing to com
pletion, a naval force of 427 vessels, and
carrying 3,268 gun-, 6o sudden and so
vast a naval armament has not beeu wit
nessed iu modem times. Of the 427 ves
sels in service, 104 only are sailing ves
sels, 323 are steam vessels, and 123 of
these latter have been added by construe
lion. This speaks more than almost any
other fact of the great energy and prodig
ious achievements of the Navy Depart
ment. These new vessels of war are of no
mean capacity and calibre, as the follow
ing description of them will show ;

Mr. Welles points to the work ot his
immense improvised navy, and claims
practical success in its blockading service
—the most prodigious ever undertaken by
any Government The high price of cot
ton in our own aud foreign countries,
when the bouth has millions of bales of it,
and the exorbitant price in the South ot
all articles of foreign manufacture, is con
clusive proof ot the efficiency ot the block
ade. Mr. Welles thinks all the Southern
ports will be in our possession at an early
day, when, he suggests, a part of the
blockading force may be spared to chase
rebel pirates from the high seas —a not
very consoling prospect to American
commerce, it must be said.
Tim Secretary of the Navy speaks with
evident disgust of the action ot England in
permitting the rebel privateer, the Ala
bama, to leave her ports to harrass Amer
ican commerce, aud suggests that the
British Government might justly be called
on to make up to American shippers and
ship owners the losses indicted on them
by the Alabama. With regard to the
future of American (Southern) commerce,
the Secretary suggests that when ail the
Southern coast and ports are safely in our
possession, the blockade should be dis
solved aud the ports opened to general
commerce, under such limitations, condi
tions aud restrictions as it would clearly
be within the province ot the Government
to impose, and without offence to the laws
of nations. This is an important sugges
tion, and probably foreshadows the Ad
ministration policy,

The subjoined is from an address which
Ben Josson, in his drama ot Catiline ,
puts in the mouth of the Roman Genera],
Petreius, to his army as it marched forth
against the rebel legions of the arch con
spirator. Much of it bears a striking an
alogy to the sentiments which our Gene
rals in the present war to put down the
rebellion of Jeff. Davis, if earnest men,
must fee!:
It is my fortune and my glory, soldier?,
This day, to lead you on:
And I am proud to have so brave a cause
To exercise your arms in. We not now
Fight for how long, how broad, how great and
large
Th’ extent and bounds o’ the people of Rome
shall be;
But to retain what our greai ancestors,
With all their labor, counsel?, arts, and actions
For us, were purchasing so mmy years.
The quarrel is not now of fame, of tribute,
Or of wrongs done unto confederates,
For which the army of the people of Rome
Was wont to move : hut for your own Republic,
For the raised temples of the immortal gods,
For all your fortunes, altars, and your Sires,
For the dear souls of your loved wives and children,
Your parents’ tombs, your rites, laws, liberty,
And briefly for the safety of the world ;
Against such men as only by their crimes
Are known.
And who, in such a cause, and ’gainst such men
Would not now wish himself all arm and weapon,
To cut such poisons from the earth?
Chiefly when this sure joy shall crown our side,
That the leas' man that falls upon our party—
As some must give their names
To fate, and that eternal memory
Of the best death, writ with it, for their country—
Shall walk at pleasure in the tents of rest.
And see far off, beneath him, all their host
Tormented after life ; and Catiline there
Walking a wretched and less ghost than he.
The Report of the Secretary of War—
an Important and Interesting Docu
ment.
From the long and able report of Sec
retary Stanton we gather the following
detail-. The portion ot the United States
which is the scene of military operations
is divided in ten departments; the middle
Department, comprising Pennsylvania,
Maryland, New Jersey and Delaware ; the
Department of Virginia ; the Departments
ot the Ohio, the Mississippi, the Tennes
see, and the Cumberland ; the Department
of North Carolina; the Department of
the South; the Department of the Gulf;
the Department of Missouri. In addition
to these there is the Department of the
Northwest, of New Mexico and of the
Pacific. The general military operations
of the year are graphically and concisely
sketched. According to the recent offi
cial returns, the armies in the ten active
departments constitute a force of 775,836
officers and privates. Since the date of
these returns the number has been increas
ed to above 800,000.
WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
From a survey of the whole field of ope
rations, it is apparent that whatever dis
asters our arms may have suffered at par
ticular points, a great advance has never
theless been made since the commence
ment of the war. When it began the en
emy were in possession of Norfolk, and
every port of the Southern coast. They
held the Mississippi, from Cairo to New
Orleans. Now, the blockaded ports of
Charleston and Mobile only remain to
them on the seaboard ; and New Orleans
and Memphis have been wrested from
them. Their possession of Vicksburg ob
structs the Mississippi, but it is to them of
no commercial use. Their strongholds on
the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers have
been captured. General Andrew John
son, as military governor of Tennessee,
holds Nashville. Tiie enemy have been
driven from Kentucky, West Tennessee,
Missouri, part of Arkansas; are fleeing
before Grant in M’ssissippi, and all their
hopes of Maryland are cut off. In com
mercial, political and strategical points of
view, mor-i success has attended the Union
cause than was ever witnessed upon so
large a theater, in the same brief period,
against so formidable and enemy.
THE PRESENT SITUATION.
The Union forces are now in the field,
under able commanders, stronger than
ever, resolute and eager to be led against
the enemy, and to crush the rebellion by
a vigorous winter campaign. The armies
of the Potomac asd of the West stand
ready to vie with each other in quickest
and heaviest blows against the enemy,—
Taught by experience the ruin of inaction
and the hazard of delay, a spirit of ear -
nest activity seems to pervade the forces
of the United States beyond what has
hitherto been exhibited. In the numerous
battles and engagements that have occur
red, our armies iu general have displayed
tiie courage and determination that should
inspire officers and soldiers fighting iu
defense of their Government. Many gal
lant lives have been lost, and many brave
and distinguished officers have fallen. For
the dead, deep sorrow is felt by the Gov
ernment and people of the United States.
A detailed report ot those who have fallen
in battle, or have distinguished themselves
in the field, will be presented to you as
soon as all the necessary official reports
can be obtained. Some promotions in re
ward of gallant service have already been
made from the ranks, and to high com
mand ; others have been delayed for want
of the reports of subordinate commanders,
m order that promotion may be governed,
not by partiality or prejudice, but unon
due consideration of relative merit. By a
resolution of Congress passed at the last
session, the President was authorized to
distribute two thousand medals to private
soldiers of distinguished merit. From
different specimens a selection has beeu
made, and tiie medals are to be ready in
January for distribution.
THE DRAFT.
The Adjutant General’s office is charged,
among other important duties, with the
business relating to enlistments, recruiting
and drafting militia. Under the calls of
July and August, theie are already in the
field over four hundred and twenty thou
sand new troops, of which three hundred
and ninety-nine thousand (393,000) are
volunteers, three hundred and thirty-two
thousand (332,000) ot whom have volun
teered for three years or during the war.
It will be remembered that the call was
made at one of those periods of despon
dency which occur iu every national
struggle A cbiet hope of those who set
the rebellion on foot was for aid and com
fort from disloyal sympathizers in the
Northern States, whose efforts were relied
upon to divide and distract the people of
the North, and prevent them from putting
forth their whole strength to preserve the
catiou existence. The call for volunteers
and a draft of the militia afforded an oc
casion for disloyal persons to accomplish
their evil purpose by discouraging enlist
ments, and encouraging opposition to the
war aud the draft of soldiers to carry
it on.
SUSPENSION OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS
CORPUS.
Anxiety was felt iu some States at the
probable success of these disloyal prac
tices, and the Government was urged to
adopt measures of protection by tempora
ry restraint ot those engaged in these
hostile acts. To that end, provost mar
shals were appointed in some of the States
upon the nomination of their Governors;
to act under the direction of the State
Executive, and the writ of habeas corpus
was suspended by your order. By cider
cf the Department, arrests were forbidden
unless authorized by the State Executive
or by the Judge Advocate. Some in
stances of unauthorized arrests have oc
curred, and when brought to the notice of
the Department, the parties have been
immediately discharged. By a recent or
der, all persons arrested for discouraging
enlistments, or for disloyal practices, in
States where the quotas of volunteers and
militia are filled np, have bees released.
Other persons arrested by military com
manders and sent from departments where
their presence was deemed dangerous to
the public safety, have been discharged
opon parole to be of good behavior, and
do no act of hostility against the Govern
ment of the United States.
While military arrests of disloyal per
sons form the subject of complaint in some
States, the discharge of such persons is
complained of in other States.
It has been the aim of the Department
to avoid any encroachments upon individ
ual rights as far as might be consistent
with public safety and the preservation of
the Government. But reflecting minds
will perceive that no greater encourage
meet can be given to the enemy, no more
dangerous act of hostility can be perpe
trated in this war, than efforts to prevent
recruiting and enlistments for the armies,
upon whose strength national existence de
pends. The expectations of the rebel
leaders, and their sympathizers in loyal
States, that tbe call for volunteers could
not be answered, and that the draft could
not be enforced, have failed, and nothing
is left but to clamor at the means by which
their hopes were frustrated, and to strive
to disarm the Government in future, if, in
the chances of war, another occasion for
increasing the military force should arise.
DUTIES OF THE PROVOST MARSHAL.
Beside aiding State authorities respect
ing draft and enlistment, another impor
tant duty is assigned the provost marshals.
The army returns and the report of the
General-in-chief show that a large number
of officers and enlisted soldiers who are
drawing pay and rations are improperly
ab.-ent from their posts. The pursuit of
such persons, and their compulsory return
to duty, is a necessary function of a pro
vost marshal, and such number only as
may be required for that purpose will be
retained in the service. The pay and
bounty allowed by act of Congress to re
cruits have offered strong temptations to
practice fraud upon the Government by
talse returns upon the muster rolls, and
false.charges for subsistence. Diligent ef
forts are being made for the detection of
all such practices, and to bring the guilty
parties—some of whom have held respect
able stations in society—before a proper
civil or military tribunal as soon as the
necessary preliminary investigations by
the Judge Advocate can be completed.
The same course is being pursued in re
spect to fraudulent contractors and dis
horsing officers.
The Secretary states that the expendi
tures for enlistments, recruiting, drilling,
and subsistence of volunteers, regulars
and militia, amounts to the sum of $20,-
092,282 98. The patriotic zeal and effi
cient aid cordially rendered by the lojal
Governors is acknowledged. The issues
by the Ordnance Department include 1,-
920 field and siege, 1,002 fortification can
non, 7,394 gun carriages, caissons, mortar
beds, traveling forges and battery wagons,
1,270,080 small arms, 987,292 sets of
equipments and accoutrements, and 213,-
991,127 rounds of ammunition for artille- |
ry and small arms, still leaving large sup- .
plies of ordnance stores at the arsenals
and depots.
During the fiscal year ending the 30th
of June, 1802, the sum of $5,550,039 54
was paid to the regular troops, that $91,-
116,010 61 were paid to volunteers, and
that 38,597,819 07 have been paid since
the 30th of June, 1862. The Surgeon
General’s report shows an expenditure of
the whole appropriations ot that depart
ment, amounting to $2,445,894 89. The
number of general hospitals is one hun
dred and fifty-one. The number ot pa
tients in them is fifty-eight thousand one
hundred and seventy-five. The whole
number under medical treatment is stated
to be not short of ninety thousand.
CONCLUSION —NO LEGITIMATE AID TO BU
DISDAINED.
With this presentation of the past ope
rations and the present condition of the
War Department the duty required of me
by the act of Congress to make an annual
report is la a great measure fulfilled. It
is seen that a force has been placed by the
people of the United Stales at the com
mand of the Government to maintain its
authority, more mighty in all the elements
of warlike power than was ever belore ar
rayed under one banner. How shall that
force be employed ? To smite the enemy
on every hand, to attack his armies and
strongholds, to occupy hi& ports, clear the
great rivers of the West of his obstruc
tions, and pause not until he is subdued, is
our plain duty. Above all, it is our duty
to disdain no legitimate aid that may save
the lives of our gallant soldiers, diminish
their labors, provide for their wants, and
lessen the burdens of the people.
No aphorism is more universally re
ceived, than tiiat “ the sole object of a
just war is to make the enemy feel the
evils of his injustice, and by his sufferings
amend his ways, he must therefore be at
tacked in his most accessible quarter.”—
The power of the rebels rest upon their
peculiar system ot labor, which keeps la
borers on their plantations to support
owners who are devoting their time and
strength to destroy our armies and destroy
our Government. Whenever that system
is in hostility to the Government, it is, in
my opinion, the duty of those conducting
the war to strike down the system, and
turn against the rebels the productive
power that upholds the insurrection. —
Rightly organized in the recovered terri
tory, the laborers ot the rebel States will
not only aid in holding fortified positions,
but their labor will, as in India, free the
white soldier from the most unwholesome
exposure of the South. They will culti
vate the c<Tn and forage, which will feed
; our cavalry and artillery horses, and save
1 the country a portion of the enormous
I burden now attending their purchase and
transport from the North. This cultiva
tion would have been of greater advantage
to us on the southeastern coast than even
; that of the great staple of the Sea Islands.
Probably the people who remained upon
I these Islands, within protection of our ar
| mies, could, under wise control, have
| supplied all the forage needed this year
I by the forces in the Department of the
i South. The full ration tor s horse weighs
twenty-six pounds, that of a soldier three
pounds.
An army, well organized and equipped
for active operations, with a dua propor
tion of cavalry, artillery and baggage
trains, will Lave not less than one horse
or mule to every four soldiers ; so that
the weight of food for the animals is more
than double that of the rations for the
men.
How important an aid, how great an
economy, in a long contest, therefore,
would there be in raising by this cheap
labor, the greater part of the forage aione
for the Southern department, thus for a
greater portion of our wants, transferring
the base of supplies now at New York to
Hilton Head or New Orleans.
The department has found it difficult to
transfer this labor from one part of the
seat of war to another. Local and family
ties seem to be very strong with these
people and with all their faith in the
power and good will of our military com
manders, it was found difficult to get vol
unteer laborers to leave Port Royal for
other depots.
A population of four millions true to
the interests of the Union, with slight as
sistance from the army, will, under proper
regulation and government, be of the
greatest assistance in holding the territory
once recovered. The principal staples of
the South are the product exclusively of
their labor. If protected upon the lauds
they have heretofore cultivated, with
some organization, and with snpport from
small detachments of loyal troop-, thev
would not only produce much ot what is
needed to feed our armies and their trains,
but they would forever cat off from the
rebellion the resources of a country thus
occupied.
The rebel armies move with ease thro’
portions ot the border States, living upon
the countries in which oar commands had
no supplies. The people bring forth their
hoard and offer them to the rebels for sale
or gift. Protect the laboring population
who are the majority in the greater part
of the South, in possession of the land
and its products, and this great advantage
will, tor whatever portion of the country
we occupy, be transferred to us. As soon
as the coast is thoroughly occupied, and
the people organized, trade wiil revive.
Cotton, rice, sugar and other products will
be exchanged by tbe producer for what
needs. Their wants will be supplied di
rect from tbe Northern factories, and the
cultivation of the great staples wiil enable
them to pay for what they use. A per
fectly free trade will thus again grow up
between the North and the South, and
with greater or less rapidity it will spread
over the whole country as our forces sue
ceed in meeting and dispersing the rebel
armies.
The greater part of the whole country
which formerly produced the sea island
cotton is now thoroughly restored to the
Union, The laborers are there—the soil
and climate. It needs only assurance of
protection to revive tfie cultivation of the
staple, as well as to produce vast quanti
ties of corn and forage for our troops.—
bines this war must be conducted by
marches and battles and sieges, why neg
lect the best means to make "them success
ful and their results permanent ? It is
worthy of notice that thus tar the por
tions ot territory which, once recovered,
we have most firmly held, are precisely
those in which the greatest proportion of
colored men are found. By their assis
tance. our armies will be able permanent
ly to operate in and occupy the country ;
and in labor for the army, in raising us
and their own supplies, full occupation
can be given them, and with this there
will be neither occasion nor temptation to
them to emigrate to a northern and less
congenial climate.
Judging by experience, no colored man
will leave his home in the South, if pro
tected in that home. All pos.-ibility of
competition from negro labor in the North
is avoided in giving colored men protect
ion and employment upon the soil which
they have thus far cultivated, and the
right to which has been vacated by the
original proprietors, deeply involved in
the crime of treason and rebellion. No
great territory has been permanently re
duced without depriving the leaders of its
people of their lands and property. It is
these that give power and influence. Few
men have the commanding genius and tal
ent to exercise dangerous influence over
their fellow man without the adventitious
aid of money and of property. By strik
ing down this system ot compulsory labor,
which enables the leaders of the rebellion
to control the resources of the people, the
rebellion would die of itself.
Under no circumstances has any dispo
sition to servile insurrection been exhibi
ted by the colored population in any
Southern State, while a strong loyalty to
the Federal Government has been dis
played on every occasion, and against
every discouragement. By the means
suggested, the rebellion may be disarmed
and subdued swiftly and effectually, and
the lives of our own people saved from
slaughter on the battle field. By the oc
cupat’.on of all their forts on the Mississip
pi and the sea coast, a market will be
opened in every rebel State for the indus
try of our people to supply the wants of
the army, and also of a loyal population,
in exchange for the valuable products of
their labor. Another point of attack is
by armed senttlments upon vacant Gov
ernment lands in Florida and Texas.—
Thousands in the Northern and Western
Stales arc impatiently waiting the signal
of military movement to plant their homes
in the best territory of this continent, and
bring it back to the Union as loyal States.
So far from the Southern States being in
vincible, no enemy was ever so vulnerable,
it the means at hand are employed against
them. It your proposition for compensa
ted emancipation, and a voluntary return
to loyalty, be blindly rejected, still the
proper application of the means a*- com
mand of the Government cannot fail to
accomplish the suppression ot toe rebel
lion and a restoration of these peaceful
relations which were designed to he es
tablished forever on this continent by the
Union of the States.
Artemas Ward as an Editor. —In the

To talk about discipline and organization

Gen. Hallecfc’s Report—lmportant De>
velopemeuts.
Washington, Dec. 2. 1862.—Gen. Hal
leck, the Oommander-in-Chief, in his re
port to the Secretary of War, states that
he started on the 24th of July to visit the
Army of the Potomac, to ascertain if there
was a possibility of an advance npon Rich
mond trora Harrison’s Landing, and if not,
to form some plan of uniting the armies of
Geo. Pope and Gen. McClellan, who was
°f the opinion that it would require 50.-
000 additional troops to go on. Halleck
replied that there could not be sent more
than 20,000. Gen. McClellan asked to i
consider the matter till morning, when he ,
agreed to go on with that number. On :
Gen. Halieck’s arrival home, he received j
a dispatch that at least 35,000 troops |
would be required The report states j
that such reinforcements could not be
sent without leaving Washington and Bal
timore almost defenseless, and an order
tor the withdrawal of the army of the
Potomac was issued on August 3d, a pre
vious order having been given for the re
moval of the sick, and transports in va-t
numbers supplied. A protest was read
trem Gen. McClellan on the sth, and the
order was not put in for eleven davs—un
til the 14th.
On the Ist orders were issued to Gen.
Burnside to embark at Newberg for Aquia
Creek, who arrived promptly on the night
of the 3d.
It is added, had the army of the Poto
mac arrived a few days earlier, the rebel
army could have been easily defeated, and
perhaps destroyed. The losses at South
Mountain and Antielam are put at 1,742
killed, 8,066 wounded, and 913 missing—a
total of 10,721. The report states that
the army rested on the north bank of the
Potomac, near Sharpsbnrg, from the 17th
of September to the 27th of October, and
says the long activity of so largo an army
in the face >f a defeated foe, and during
the season far rapid marches and a vigor
ous campaign, was a matter of great dis
appointment.
A review of the movements before
Washington is made. He says that a part
of the Army of the Potomac was ordered
forward from Alexandria, and that Gen
Cox was ordered to come by rail via
Washington from "Western Virginia with
the main portion of h ; s force.
Gen. Pope, on the 27tb, ordered Gen.
Porter to be at Bristow Station the next
morning. The report says that for some
unexplained reason, Porter did not comply
with this order, and his corps was not iu
the battle of the 27th and 291 h, iu which
Gen. Pope gaiued some ground, although
the battles were not decisive.
Of the reinforcements from Alexandria,
embracing at length the whole Peninsula
army, it is said some of the corps moved
with becoming activity, but the delays
were neither creditable nor excusable. —
The soldiers actually engaged in these
battles fought with great bravery, but
many thousands straggled away from their
commands, and it is said not a few volun
tarily surrendered to the enemy, so as to
be paroled as prisoner of war.
In this emergency Cox’s troops were
ordered forward in great haste from Wes
tern Virginia.
Halleck then recites the history of
Pope’s campaign, and brings out a letter
from Pope, in which that officer pro
nounces Sigel as wholly unreliable.
Halleck commends Pope’s earlier dispo
sitions for isolating Jackson’s forces, as
well planned. The delays of some of
McClellan’s troops in marching to Pope’s
relief were neither creditable nor excusa
ble. He says no full official report of the
campaign has yet been received from
Pope. He concludes this subject by say
ing that it McClellan’s troops had arrived
a little earlier the rebel army could have
been easily defeated, and perhaps de
stroyed.
Halleck next sketches the history ot the
Maryland campaign and denounces the
surrender of Harper’s Ferry, and implicit
ly censures McClellan for it. He then
complains of McClellan’s long inactivity
in the face of a defeated enemy, and says
he was utterly ignorant of what his plan
of campaign was, as towards the close
McClellan sent no reports to him, but only
to the President direct.
Halleck next sketches Buell’s campaign
and says that as a commission is ordered
to investigate, it would be obviously im
proper for him to express his opinions
now.
He says an investigation has been or
dered of Morgan’s strange abandonment
of Cumberland Gap.
Grant’s and Kosecrans’ operations are
sketched without comment.
Curtis’ withdrawal to Missouri is termed
unfortunate, aud is said to have prevented
the carrying out of intended movements
in Arkansas.
He says it is quite possible that Indian
hostilities may be resumed iu the spring,
and preparations will bs made accordingly,
The forces iu South and North Carolina
are pronounced too small to accomplish
much. Gen. Halleck calls attention to
to the fact that onr victories have not
been followed up, and says that in Mary
land, Virginia, Kentucky and Middle Ten
nessee the rebel armies have exhibited
much more mobility aud action than our
own. He says this is partly owing to our
enormous baggage and immense transpor
tation, and says that our troops, especially
in the East have been little accustomed to
such marching as is required by active
operations.

The Bp.insmade Case. —The New York
Board of Police Commissioners on Monday

Washington, Dec. 4. — Special to the
Times. —A special Cabinet meeting was
held to day, and as it is only a day m
advance of the regular meeting, it is re
garded as an event of unusual interest.
The Committee on Ways and Means
have not yet held a meeting, but will do
so to-morrow, to consider the proposed
amendments to the tax law, which are
believed to be necessary for a successful
operation of the law.
Special to the Tribune. —Dr. Barney, of
Baltimore, was recently taken by the
rebel pickets, at Oentreville, and sent to
Richmond. He has since stated that ho
put himself in their way for the express
purpose of being captured. While at
Richmond, where he has ac
quaintances, he had frequent interviews
with members of the Confederate Cabinet,
and was admitted into many secrets re
gprding the rebel programme. When the
time bad arrived for his departure to the
North, he was sent tor by J. P. Benjamin,
who handed him letters addressed to Gov.
Seymour, of New York. Fernando and
Ben Wood , Valtandigham and Cox , of
Ohio, Bayard, of Delaware, Beverdy
Johnson, of Maryland-, and a number of
other noted Democrats in the North, and
in the Border States. In the verbal in
structions given to Dr. Barney, no terms
were asked for. Southerners told him
they would consent to no terms; that if
not admitted into the Union as equals
they would not come in at all. What
they ask is the granting of an amnesty to
all the military aud civil leaders of the
rebellion, so that an election tor members
of Congress can be made dnring the com
ing winter; and that that body be called
together as early as April.
Gen. Sigel to-day demanded a Court of
Inquiry, to investigate the charges and
imputations of Pope’s letter to Halleck.
The situation at Fredericksburg is un
changed. The pickets stationed along the
river, aud five miles above, are very
friendly. Yesterday, three of the enemy’s
pickets, belonging to an Alabama regi
ment, came across the river, and talked
for an hour with our pickets. They en
deavored to make a trade for coffee and
overcoats. Two other rebel soldiers ford
ed the river iu eight ot their pickets, aud
gave themselves up as deserters. They
were led to Gen. Burnside’s Headquarters.
The rebel force across the river is sup
posed to be about 80,000.

Cairo, Dec. G.—From Memphis papers
we learn that Gen. Hovey’s expedition,
20,000 strong, which left Helena some
days since, lauded at Friar’s Point on the
sth, twenty miles below, marched to
Grenada and took possession of that
place last Monday. A number of citizens
fled. The proprietor of the Appeal J re
moved Lis establishment to Marietta, Ga.,
before the federal occupation. The rebels
burned fifteen or twenty locomotives and
several hundred cars.
New York, Dec. 6.—The Tribune's
Washington dispatch says, the statement
in Barney’s letter, printed in to-day’s
Tribune, that Barney has had an inter
view with President Lincoln, is contra
dicted on the highest authority. It is
further to be stated, on the same authori
ty, that the President has no knowledge
whatever of the statements contained in
the letter, and no communication on that
subject or embodying such information
has been made to him in any way.
Leading Republicans deny all know
ledge of the matter, and the supposition
that this letter has any weight for their
alleged attention to Barney’s statements is
entirely eeroneous. It may be added that
no recent communication from Fernando
Wood has been received by the President,
and none whatever on these or similar
subjects.
Private advices from one of the most
eminent friends of American in France,
represents that the recent offer of media
tion by Napoleon, is there regarded as an
expression of a deliberate and matured
purpose from which the Emperor will not
recede, and that it is considered a serious
blow to our cause in Europe, aud to the
cause of freedom in Europe not less than
in America.
The following is from the Herald:
Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Dec. s.—Recent reconnoissances have dis
covered that no attempt is made by the
enemy to hold the section north of the
Rappahannock, their forces having entirely
evacuated the country, with the exception
of small scouting parties. There cross the
river at small blind ferries, now easily
found in consequence of low water, and
after a dash upon our outposts succeed in
escaping by seme new route, unknown to
our pickets.
The difficulties heretofore existing in the
transmission of the mails between Wash
ington and Headquarters, by the energy of
Headquarter’s postmasters Hazlette and
Oooley, have at length been overcome,
and we now get letters without delay.
Convalescents and exchanged prisoners
are flocking to their respective commands
in great numbers.
Burnside’s order recommending the dis
missal of officers guilty of neglect of duty
in allowing their commands to be sur
prised by the enemy, gives unusual satis
faction, and will undoubtedly correct the
eerious'evil of carelessness on the part of
commanders of outposts.
