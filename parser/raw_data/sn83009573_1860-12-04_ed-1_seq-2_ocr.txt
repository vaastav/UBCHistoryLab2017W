BALTIMORE.
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1860
THE BALTIMORE EXCHANGE ANNUAL
LETTER SHEET
Will be issued from this office on the Ist day of
January, 1861, (Tuesday.) It will be in form and
general contents, similar to those which we have
heretofore made up, and which we have the best
reason to believe, have given universal satisfac
tion. We hazard nothing in sayiug that our com
mercial reports are unequalled by those of any
paper in this city in accuracy and completeness;
and all the statistics of the trade and commerce
of the city for the past year will be embodied in
our Letter-sheet, in a condensed and interesting
form, accompanied by appropriate remarks and
explanations. At a time when political causes
seem to indicate a closer business connection be
tween Baitimoro and the Southern and South
western States, our merchants should avail them
selves of every opportunity of advertising, not
only their own business, but that of the
whole city. An opportunity to accomplish
both objects will be afforded by our Letter
sheet, in which all persons ordering twenty-five
or more copies in advance, can have their busi
ness card inserted without extra charge. Those
who intend to make use of our sheet will please
leave their orders, at their earliest convenience
at our counting-room, or with our agent. Mr.
Iloltzman, who is authorized to receive them.
Price per single copy, 3 cents.
The simple fact, that the first day of the present
session of Congress has come and gone, without
any marked event, or outburst of the fire burn
ing in the hearts and brains of men from the ex
cited sections, is somewhat reassuring. Both
Houses seem to have organized, not only with
out difficulty, but with great order, decorum
and apparent good temper. The very air
is filled with rumors of almost every hue
and shape, of compromises which shall compose
existing difficulties. We attach to none of them
the least importance, but do not feel ourselves at
liberty, altogether, to withhold them from our
readers. We have an intelligent and care
ful correspondent at the Seat of Government,
whose first letter we publish this morning, with
instructions to write to us only for the purpose of
conveying information and not merely to fill a
column, which can always be better employed
than by giving expression to mere speculations of
professional letter writers. We pledge ourselves
to keep the readers of the EXCHANGE, during the
present session, quite up, in all valuable and use
ful knowledge of what transpires from day to day.
The PRESIDENT'S Message is generally expected ]
to he delivered to day at noon. If so, we hope to ,
be able to place it in the hands of our readers at ,
least as early as any of our contemporaries—well
knowing the interest which everybody must at
tach to that document at the present moment.—
When it shall hare been duly considered, we hope
to witness a concentration of the statesmanship of
the country on some feasible plan to rescue us
from the yawning gulf of disunion.
It has been said in the North that the South, by
demanding the repeal of what are called the Per
sonal Liberty Bills, lIR3 raised an unnecessary and
immaterial issue. It is asserted that these uncon
stitutional laws arc practically inoperative, be
cause the people who eudeavor to prevent the en
forcement of the Fugitive Slave Act seldom resort
to them for that purpose, but prefer to adopt more
vigorous measures to accomplish their ends. The
operation of that statute is not usually defeated,
we are told, by the interposition of parties assum
ing to act under cover of State laws, but by
violent mobs whose proceedings override all rights
and all legislative enactments whatsoever; and the
same resistance that is now offered to the arrest and
rendition of a fugitive slave, would be, therefore,
displayed even if the obnoxious Personal Liberty
Bills had never been thought, .of. For these rea"
sons, then, it is suggested that we ought not to
trouble ourselves or embarrass tlic North by ask
ing the repeal of the laws in question, when, in
the language of the Tribune, the '-South would
"not be profited one stiver" by their abrogation.
That these views find favor in the North is
natural enough, for the people of that sec.
tion have manifested every disposition to
avoid meeting the real issues in dispute, but
an argument so fallacious is not likely to im
pose upon the South or to bring about a belter un
derstanding between the hostile States. We insist
that the repeat of the Personal Liberty Bills would
be a measure 110 less practical than important.
Whether they are habitually appealed to to forward
or sanction aggressive acts against citizens of the
South it matters little, for one single instance of
injustice is sufficient to justify a community in de
nouncing the medium through which the wrong
was done. And we are at no loss for examples
by which to illustrate the oppressive working of
these laws, for they have but too recently been in
voked to satisfy the vengeance of the people of a
sister State against a resident of Maryland. More,
over, these illegal acts palpably serve to encourage
the lawlessness which has been so frequently pro
ductive of serious consequences t) the inhabitants
of the border States. It cannot be doubted that
many a mob in the North has been instigated to
set at defiance the authorities and lav. s to which the
Southern stranger looked for protection, by the
mere recollection of the fact that sworn le
gislators and judges had themselves re
pudiated an act of Congress, and had stigmatized
as kidnapping what the SUPREME COURT defines to
be a legal right. There is still another practical
consideration, which cannot be overlooked in this
connection. These laws are the cause of fearful
agitation in the South, because they indicate the
hostile and uncompromising spirit of the North;
and even if they were obsolete, they ought never
theless to be swept from the statute books. The
Slave States are entitled to ask for some proof of the
conservatism, of which the North makes so loud n
profession. They and their institutions have been
directly and indirectly assailed continually for
twenty years past, and they may fairly expect
their brethren of the Free States to offer them
some evidence stronger than words, of a determi
nation to respect in future the provisions of the
Constitution. The repeal of the Personal Liberty
Bills would give the South the welcome assuranceit
seeks for, and would afford it the strongest ground
for believing that the North is desirous to pur
sue a conciliatory course. Surely the request of
the South is not unreasonable, and it is hard to
comprehend how the people of the North can re
ject it, if they are really anxious to restore har
mony between the several States, and so preserve
the Union.
A movement lias been set on foot by the School
Commissioners of Baltimore County, which prom
ises to exert a salutary local influence on the cause
pf Education. It is well known to those who take an
interest in such matters, how radically defective are
the means and methods devised for conducting our
Common Schools in the counties. In this city
the case is different, the course of instruction being
based upon a well organized system, which is for
the most part effectively carried out under teachers
well qualified to fulfill the duties which are as
signed them to perform, and whose services on the
whole are not inadequately paid. Any one who
will glance at the statistics of education for Balti
more County, as given in the census for 1850,
will be struck with the facts that are there dis
closed. In a total white population of rather over
thirty-four thousand, there were six thousand white
adults, who could neither read or write. If the
children who were also left to grow up in ignor
ance of even the rudiment 3 of letters, had been in
cluded in the tabular estimate, a still more de
plorable condition of things would have
been exhibited. Some improvmeut in this res.
pect has been made since then ; but the system—
if such it may be called, which is no system at
all, but merely a crude method of teaching—is
wanting in almost every element that gives value
and importance to the Coinmou Schools of the
Eastern and many of the Western States, where the
importance of a thoroughly good common schoo'
education is more insisted upon, and is certainly
better appreciated than it has been hitherto with
ns. In this State we have never hud a school svs
tem. Every couuty lias bec-u permitted to regu
late its own educational concerns, and the conse
quence is, that in no one county is there anything
like unity of effort, or harmony of method. The
school houses, as structures, are for the most part
of the rudest kind, and they are frequently remote
from the centres of population in the district. The
teachers are ill paid, and, of course, hut indif
ferently qualified for the duties which they
have undertaken i > perform, and as a natural re
sult, there aie many among them \i ho fail to com
mand that respect which is one of the essentials to
success in a vocation where obedience to the mas
ter should be one of the first principles inculcated.
The School Commissioners for Baltimore County,
in their last Annual Report, undertook to state
what the system needs to make it efficient.
Tbey declared that four things were requisite.
"First —Suitable houses and furniture. Secondly
" —Well qualified teachers. Thirdly—Remunera
"tive salaries for teachers. Fourthly and lastly
"Thorough supervision... jj, e Commissioners
might much more tersely have on—„ e( j U p
whole of ihelr wants, if, instead of ietu Uft ...t.
. the deficiencies in detail, they had simply called
called for a thorough revision of the school sys
tem, so as to make it applicable, not to Baltimoie
County alone, but to every county in the State.—
The "four things requisite" do nevertheless tell a
plain story. They indicate, as plainly as words
can possibly do, that almost everything
is needed that is essential to the success of
Common Schools under any system or method of
teaching. \\ iihout suitable school houses, and all
the paraphernalia connected therewith; without
good teachers who can only be obtained by pav
ing them good salaries—ami without an appropri
ate supervision of the schools, the scholars, and the
teachers themselves—by some qualified person or
persons—the little good that can be accom
plished scarcely compensates for the money ex
pended in attaining it. "We have long regarded
the condition of our Common Schools—those that
arc outside the city of Baltimore we mean—as a
disgrace to the State. It is not the fault of the
School Commissioners that they are so; for, al
though, from the very nature of their office,
they cannot help being cognisant of the de
fects that arc inherent in the present sys
tem—if we must so style it—they possess no
power to remedy them. They can" only suggest
what might be done to make them better than
they are; but it still remains for others to act
upon those suggestions. It cannot he questioned
that many of the teachers selected are ill qualified
to impart instruction to the children which are
placed under their charge. But how is it possible
that it should be otherwise, when the average sal
ary of teachers per annum in Baltimore County
amounts only to two hundred and ninety-one dol
lars—a sura considerably less than is received In
ordinary mechanics, and but little, if any more,
than is paid to common farm laborers, if we in
clude the cost of their board. The School ques
tion lias been repeatedly pressed upon the attention
of the Legislature. At the Biennial-session which
was held in 1855-G, Governor LIGON in his
annual message earnestly recommended the
adoption of a Common School system
that should be more in consonance with
the spirit of the age, and the honor and dignity of
the State than the loose and incongruous tiling
which was constantly calling for Legislative tin
kering, and which when tinkered was compara
tively worthless. In support of his views, a plan
was submitted which possessed many excellent
features, and which, if it had been divested of
some of its complexities, would undoubtedly have
worked well; but the delegates, from the counties
fell to wrangling over it, and the result was that the
Bill, notwithstanding the efficient support which it
received,and the'many cogentarguments which were
brought forward in favor of its adoption, failed to
become a law. Since then the connties have been
| thrown, as of old, upon their own resources, and of
course, as is usual under such circumstances, mat
ters have not mended much. An experiment has
however, been undertaken by the School Commis
sioners of Baltimore County, which bids fair to
work some reformation in the system of teaching
at present In vogue, so far as re
gards that particular County. The experi
ment to which we allude is the organ
ization of a Normal Class or Teacher's Institute,
under the supervision of Prof. F. A. ALLEN, Prin
cipal of the Chester county, Pa., Normal School and
ot P. M. LEAKIN, A- M. Fifteenycars experience as
a Normal School Teacher, affords every reasona
ble warrant that Prof. ALLEN possesses all the re
quisite knowledge for imparting to teachers of
Common Schools the particular knowledge of which
they stand most in need; whilst his associate, Mr.
LEAKIN, is also favourably known as a competent
teacher in Schools of the higher grades. This Nor
ma! Class, composed of all the teachers of
Common Schools in Baltimore County, commenced
its session yesterday in the Hail of the Newton
University, and its morning and afternoon meet
ings will he continued until Friday next. Tilt
special duties of the day being over, each evening
will be devoted to the delivery of addresses upon
educational subjects generally. On Friday, at the
close of t he session of the Normal Class, the teach
ers present will undergo an examination into their
respective qualifications for the duties which they
have assumed, aud upon the result of their exami
nation their retention or dismissal will depend.—
Now, all this is excellent, as far as it goes, and
reflects great credit 011 the Commissioners of Bal
timore County. It is a slep in the right direction,
and will undoubtedly he productive of some
amount of positive good. But the main difficulty
in relation to our Common Schools has yet to be
overcome. What is really wanted, and what we
hope soon to see imperatively demanded, is a rad
ical change in the system which at present pre
vails, and that change can only be brought about
by Legislative action.
We understand that a report prevailed in Wash,
ington on Saturday that Commodore Shubreck and
C'apt. Ingraham intend to resign, in case South
Carolina withdraws from the Union. It is not
likely that the rumor can be true as regards Capt.
Ingraham, for he, if we mistake not, is abroad in
the Mediterranean. But the prevalence of such re
ports serves to show the impression which the un
happy state of the public mind creates, that loyalty
to the flag under which those gallant officers have
won lasting renown, will become incompatible with
the allegiance which they owe to their native State-
Both of them are natives of South Carolina.
JOEL V ICKERS, ESQ. —The death of this venerable
citizen,announced yesterday morning, adds another
well known and respected name to the necrology Of
Baltimore for;lS6o. Captain Vickers, early in life,
commanded in our then extensive and flourishing
mercantile marine, and sailed between this city and
the East Indies and Europe. He was engaged in
our naval difficulty with France and took active
part in the defence of Baltimore in the last war.—
From 1809 until within a very recent period he
was employed in mercantile pursuits in this city,
and retired with an ample fortune. The members
of the Corn Exchange yesterday paid the usual
tribute to his memory.

MEETING OF CONGRESS—VARIOUS 11 UMORS AND SUITML
SES—MR. HUNTER TO OFFER A COMPROMISE- —CAU-
CUSES —TEMPER OF SOUTHERN MEN—EXPECTED SPEECH
OF MR. BRECKINRIDGE, &C., &C.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3d.
A bright sun and bracing atmosphere greeted the
assembling of Congress to-day, and the galleries of
both Houses were crowded to excess in anticipation
of the reception of the President's Message, and
perhaps an exciting impromptu debate thereon.—
In this anticipation the public were disappointed, the
President not yet haviDg completed the document,
important alterations having suggested themselves
to him at the last moment. These alterations, it is
stated, relate to his views upon the subject of seces
sion, which, it is now said, will be less decided in
opposition thereto than has heretofore been ex
pected.
The Senate presented rather an empty aspect
this morning, quite a number of Senators being ab
sent.
No Senators appeared from South Carolina, Geor
gia or Louisiana, and individuals were not present
from many other Southern States. No politica l
significance, however, is attached to the absence of
any except the Senators from South Carolina and
Georgia. Mr. Toombs, however, it is believed*
will be here. Mr. Slide!!, of Loulsana, and Mr.
Gwin, of California, are at home looking after
their re-election by the Legislatures of their re
spective States, and Mr. Benjamin, I believe, has
not yet returned from California, where he has
been engaged upon a very important law case. Mr.
Douglas and Mr. Seward were in their seats, look
ing quite well.
Messrs. Bigler, Mason and Collamer were appoint
ed the Committee to wait upon the President, and
it being understood that he was prepared to make
no communication, the Senate, at an early hour, ad
journed.
The House organized amid the usual noise and
bustle. Bev. Thomas H. Stockton, the Chaplain
delivered a long, fervent and eloquent prayer, in
which he supplicated God to crush the designs of
wicked men in ail parts of the country, and aid the
wise men of tbe land, who in these troublous times
knew not what to do. The venerable Divine was
listened to with unusual attention.
Mr. Grow, of Fa., made several efforts to get up
his pet hobby, the Homestead Bill, but did not
succeed.
The only absentee this morning from Carolina
was Mr. I'orcher Miles, of the Charleston district.
The tedious operation ot selecting scats was then
gone through with, and it was noticeable that the
Americans generally took seats upon the Republi
can side of the House. Mr. Winter Davis is upon
that side, and Mr. Etberidge, of Tennessee,located
himself with Mr. Burlingame, of Massachusetts.
Mr. Washburn, of Maine, having been elected
Governor of Maine, bis position upon the com
mittee of Ways and Means will have to be filled by
another.
When the name of Mr. Bocock, of Virginia, was
called to-day, for the purpose of selecting his seat,
Mr. Houston, of Alabama, arose and said that in
Mr. Bocock's absence he would make the selection,
and would choose the seat occupied bv Bocock
during the last session. Mr. T. li. Florence, of
Pennsylvania, at the time was sitting in llie place,
and at Houston's icquesl vacated it, remarking
jocosely that by so doing it would enable him to
get farther from the gentleman from Alabama.
"Yes," replied Houston, "and before long we will
probably be still farther apart."
The House at 2 P. M. adjourned, having done
nothing of importance. No evidence of unkind
feeling was given by members towards each other.
The breach between the sections is, however,
wider and deeper than it was at the close of last
session, and various plans are being suggested with
the view of healing it. A caucus of South Ameri
cans were strongly disposed to urge a general Con
ference of all tbe Southern members, to be held
'o-nightjbut the scheme has tailed, tbe South Caro
linians and Georgians refusing to have anything to
do with it, and the delegations from Alabama,
Mississippi and other Southern States manifesting
great indifference
i As soon as the message is read, a number of pro.
I positions will be submitted. One by a member
from New York to restore the Missouri Compro
mise and extend it to the l'acific, and another, from
Maynard, of Tennessee, proposing the appointment
of a committee of one from each State, to whom
the issues as to slavery shall be referred. No in
dications have as yet been given, however, that
either of these will be satisfactory. It is further
said that Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, will introduce
an elaborate plan of compromise into the Senate>
which will comprehend the settlement of all the
great questions now agitating the country.
J learn reliably that Senators Green, of Missouri,
and 1-itzpatrick, of Alabama, are in favor of the
secession of the Southern States unless the North
speedily yields.
ihe message, which occupies sixteen columns of
the Washington Constitution, will be forwarded
North this evening, or in the early train to-mor
row morning.
A serenade is to be given to Vice-President Breck.
inridge to-night, when it is expected he will dis
close his views upon the politica! condition of the
country.
Caucuses are expected to take place to-night of
the Ucpublicans and Americans, when the political
difficulties will be discussed. 1 do not think any
definite result will be reached, and if so, at too late
an hour to telegraph you to-night.
The tone and temper of the representatives of the
cotton States is very firm and decided. They talk
of nothing but secession, and do not seem to care
whether their demands are met by the North or
not. A portion of the Republicans seem favorable
to concession, but the bulk of them, like Falstaff,
object to doing anything "upon compulsion." If
their courage, however, is not greater than that of
the fat knight, they may recede when the oppor
tune moment arrives. Propositions of compromise
will be as plenty as blackberries as soon as the Pre
sident's Message shall have been delivered.
It is said that Mr. Crittenden and Mr. Buchanan
have arrived at an understanding, and that the for
mer will support the President's views. Supposing
this to be true, it amounts to very little, as Mr.
Crittenden's influence in the Senate lias not beon
potent of late.
Great importance is attached to the speech which
it i 3 expected Vice President Breckinridge will
make to-night, on the occasion of the compliment
ary serenade to be given to him. The event will
not take place till between 10 and 11 o'clock, and
I cannot therefore, apprise you of its character un
til tomorrow.
All the speculations in regard to Lincoln's cab
inet are the merest trash, and are manufactured to
give prominence to certain men. I learn from the
best source that Mr. Lincoln has not yet made up
his miad on the subject, deeming it prudent to await
the solution of the political troubles, and to defer
all action until he shall have arrived in Washing
ton and have had the opportunity of consulting his
leading party friends in Congress.
Property-holders in Washington are terribly
scared at the very mention of a dissolution of the
Union, and it is undeniable that real estate here has
experienced a marked decline within the last six
months.
Mr. Douglas made a Union speech to some of his
friends last Saturday night, in which he endorsed
the speech of Alex. 11. Stephens, and planted him
self on the Georgia platform of 1851.
ODSEHVER.
MADIGAN'S ClßCCS. —Madigan's Circus opened
last evening at Front Street Theatre to a well filled
house. The programme, as presented in the bill,
was a very attractive one, and the performances
throughout were of more than usual excellence.
The main feature of the evening, however, was the
first appearance hero of Mons. Blondin, whose ex
ploits at Niagara have made his name world-la
mous. From the difficult nature of his per
formances last evening, and the pertec l
ease and self-confidence with which tbey
were achieved, we are no longer disposed to
regard anything that ho might attempt upon
the tight-rope, however perilous it might be,
in the case bf others, as involving any special dan.
ger to oim. lie is evidently as much at home on
the rope as others would be upon the solid ground,
and his evolutions are really amongst the most re
markable things we have ever witnessed. His poise
is perfect, and whether sitting or standing upon
a chair, balanced by the rounds across the rope; or
throwing back-somersaults over a long line of
lighted candies placed brcat high; or dancing in
cumbrous wooden shoes; or traversing the rope
blindfolded and enveloped in a sack, the skill which
lie displays relieves those daring feats from the ter
ror which they would otherwise inspire in the be
ho Ider.
THE .MARYLAND INSTITUTE LECTURES. —The annual
course of Lectures before the Maryland Institute
. have heretofore proved seasons of great pleasure and
t profit to our citizens, and judging by the list of first
class names mentioned as expected to take part in
the course of this winter, we are satisfied the fu
ture will bo equal to the past. The first lecture
j will be delivered this evening by Prolessor S. S.
, Ilaldeman, ot Columbia, Pa., who is every war
t qualified to treat of the Subject chosen, which is
Defects >I American Literature.
1 HOLLIDAY STREET THEATRE.— The luela-drama of
the Dead Heart was performed last night to a small
house. The principal parts were played by Mr.
b. Williams and Miss Alice Gray, very much to the
' satisfaction of their fricads. Messrs. Seal !an and
1 Leake were also in excellent mood, and were much
applauded. The piece will be repeated to-night.
TOM THUMB. —The little General was welcomed
back to Baltimore yesterday by quite flattering
audiences, both in the afternoon and evening.—

Gay street.
The shipments of boots and shoes from Boston,
Mass., to domestic markets, outside of New Eng
land, during the week ending the 28tb ult., amount
ed to 4,745 cases, of which 1,544 went to the Middle
States, 1,308 to the Southern States, and 1,893 to
the Western States; besides 00 cases were shipped
to the British Provinces, and 3 to Cuba.
Tbe manufacturers of Philadelphia on Saturday
determined to put their mills upon half time. Sev
eral contemplate stopping on the first of tbe year,
if business does not revive. Accounts from New
York, and from the East, report the discharge of a
large number of workmen in consequence of the
depression.
By special order of the War Department of the
30th ultimo, First Lieut. James St. C. Morton,
Corps of Engineers, is assigned to duty as Chief
Engineer of the Washington Aqueduct, and will re

shall be able to close his accounts and turn over
the public property.

ning Property, and illustrated hi-? Address with accurately
prepared diagrams which vxhibite 1 to the stockholder* the
amount of excavation made, and the exact degree of practi
cal productiveness in ore, of the several parts of the min
ers' vein op-Tp d up to the present tira .
He then oIT red a Business Statement which showed that
Ores of t opper and Cold had already been produced by the
Mine ami S3ld by the Coinpiny to the amount of Thirty
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars. This practical result, lie
stated, wa? far ahead - f the early experience of nine-tenths
of the oldest and most solidly established c pper mines now
existing, cither in tliia country or abroad, and greatly in
excess of that shown by any similar property in North Car
olina, for an equal period from the commencement of its
W m r% Hn e, iual outlay of capital
The Pres dmt then stated that there was no floating debt
du by the company; that its entire liabilities up to this
time were hut Two Thousand six Hundred Dollars, and this
chiefly cunrent bil's for supplies* that the mine was fully
slockedl with buildings and machinery for years of future
wo: K; that a full force of workmen, under an able and rxpe
rienced captain, were driv ing tlie mine ahead to it 3 com
p.ete development; that there was, even in this preparatory
excavati 11, a steady and daily vi Id of Copper Ore; and
that the Gold Oreli ad grown to be a valuable auxiliary to
til* company s revenue, as it was now yielding One Thon
sani Dollars per montlu.
\V ith this statement of farts concerning the condition of
their propelty, the President called upon' the SD ckholt'erj
to say what trey would do to sustain it* further w- rking to
ni compute development. The small original work n* cap
it il of liftmen thousand dollars had b-en expended v. 1111
such results as lie had shown. The sum of tw-\it\ thousand
dollars would now insure the completion n* rip* work.
At the close of the President's address the xuee ii.g, with
marked unanimity, concurred in the great desirardeoc.-s of
promptly furnishing theCompanv with the required means.
After a general discussion as to the re st mode of d dng ?o,
and acting under the powers explicitly granted in the Com
pany s (darter to make assessments on the stock, to f rte.t it
for non-payment thereof,a nd to tell th"?t'.< kso f< r r, ir. d f.r
the sole ben fit of the Company, the ran-tirg fira Iy, with
out a dissenting vote, adopted the following r solutions:
Resolved, That an assessment of twenty rents I. laid
upon each share of the wind- capital stock of the Guilford
Copper and Gold Mining Comnanj; ten cents of which shall
be paid on or b-fure the 15th t n of D ember, ISn; rt e
cents on or before February Ist, 1801; and 11 ve c.nt on or bu
fore March Ist, 1861
a Fr solved further. That aiy and all share? of stock is-mod
by this company, upon which cuy one of the instaMiii o N
, of the foregoing assessment sh.ilt not hp tid inc sh at the
P office of the company on o" efore the days mentio-i. din
1 the foregoing resolution, shall, uuder the powers grant *1
(• in the charter of this com piny and the by-laws made in
pursuance thereof, be absolutely forfeited to the coaip my,
re-issued by it, and sold for its sol- lie efit atsu li tine s as
the board of directors may deem fit.
* Fcsol red further, That the TrAusf r Books of the Compa
ny be closed from the 10th to the 15tli of December, both
inclusive.
Stockholders of the Guilford Copper anil Gold Mining
1 Company will therefore TaJce Notice, that on or before the
15th day of December, 1800. they a?e required to pay, or
cause to be paid, in cash at the Company's Office, 34 Second
r street, as the first installment of the fotementiom das -ess
ment, Ten Cents per Share for the full number < f shares
appearing on the face of each and every certificate held bv
{ thera, and have the same receipted for upon each r sniil
certificates. A failure to meet this payment >v the day ap
pointed will at once work a total forfeiture cr their stock,
and of the validity of aiy certificate not carrying the re
-1 ceipt.
[ Persous holding the company's stock in the oaimfof
another party can have their certificates transferred to their
• own names, or continue to hold th min any other name.—
i It behooves them, however, to present their certificates hy
, t "Vi l °} e . at the place appointed, and pay, or cause to be

we desire to call the attention of our customers am! the

Fluid, and find tiut it is all the inventor claims for it,and
wecan fully recommend it to all as doing away with those
accidents from EXPLOSION to which so many consider
F.tbereal Oil liable; this in the eves of manv. has be"n the
only drawback in using it, and we consider that this is now
entirely obviated. This Fluid, like all other Burning Flu
ids, is inflammable, for to cause it to be rot so would be to
render it useless asan iLuminator, we do not. therefore, oiler
