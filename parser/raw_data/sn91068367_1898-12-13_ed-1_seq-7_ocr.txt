REFERENCE TO iMAINE DISASTER
In President McKinley's Message to Congress Stirs the Anger of the
Spanish-Awaiting Engrossment of theVreaty for Signing by the
Commissioners-Several .Matters to be Settled by Diplo
matic Negotiations- France to Take up Cause of
French Holders of Cuban Bonds Prepara
tions for the Changeof Flags in Cuba
Parie, December 8. The United j
States and the Spanish peace commis- j
sioners concluded their work today and
finally settled the terms of the treaty of
peace. They will meet once more in
formal session, on Saturday or Monday
next, when the Spanish commission- !
ers, sorrowfully, and the Americans,
with feelings of relief, will write their
signatures upon the document which
embodies the results of the war the
preparation of which has consumed
eleven weeks, a longer time than the
war itself. In the meantime the treaty
will be engrossed under the supervis
ion of Mr. Moore and Senor Ojeda ,the
secretaries of the respective commis
sions. The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter
over the result, though observing the
forms of friendliness and courtesy to
the end. Senor Montero Itios, whose
strong and persistent struggle to save
for his country every possible asset
from the wreck of her colonial empire
has commanded the respect and admi
ration of his opponents, went from the
council chamber to his bed in a state
of complete collapse as the result of the
long strain and his chagrin over the
small fruits of his efforts. Senor Ojeda
has been prostrated since yesterday
and was unable to attend the joint ses
sion today.
The Spaniards charge equal blame
upon the European powers and the
United States for their downfall. One
of the Spanish commissioners said this
evening:
"The European nations have made a
great mistake in deserting Spain and
leaving her to spoliation by the brute
force of a conscienceless giant. They
all know that in the Philippines Amer
ica has taken more than she can digest.
She will ultimately sell the islands to
England or uermany and when the
transfer is attempted it will precipi
tate a general European strife. We
have refused to sell any island in the
Carolines. We never thought of con-
sidering an offer, nor have we consent
ed to negotiate upon any questions I
except those directly involved in the
protocol signed at Wasnington."
Taris, December 8. The treaty is
finished. The Spaniards have declined
to grant most of the requests of the
United States which were .unsettled at
the beginning of the season. They
refuse to cede a coaling station in the
Carolines.
Judge Day today said: "We have
settled all the points on which we can
agree. It only remains to engross and
sign the treaty. That will be done in
two or three days."
The members of the commission say
the treaty will contain little outside
the scope of tnc Washington protocol
and the matters directly base thereon,
like the provisions for the evacuation
of the ceded territories, the transfer
of public property therein and guar
antee of the safety of the property and
rights of the Spanish citizens remain
ing there.
The details of the last class of ques
tions covered by the statement which
the Americans handed to Senor Mon
tero Rios at the last meeting were con
sidered today, but all the commission
ers refuse to divulge the details of Che
conference. Several points upon which
they were unable to agree were left
open for diplomatic negotiations. The
Spaniards refused to admit that they
had failed to respect former treaties
guaranteeing religious freedom in the
Caroline islands oi that there was a
necessity for new guarantees.
The conclusion of the work was, ac
cording to the commissioners, marked
by politeness and all outward evidences
of good feeling and relief at the fact
hat the task was accomplished.
When all the propositions had been
discussed, Judge Day, president of the
American commission, remarked:
' There seems to be nothing more to do
but to engross and sign the treaty."
Senor Montero Rios, president of the
Spanish commission, acquiesced to this
and the Americans bowed themselves
out before the Spaniards, according to
their custom.
The American commissioners enter
ed the joint conference today in a ner
vous frame of mind. They evidently
had reasons to believe that a possibil
ity existed, even at this late hour, that
there might be a rupture. This, feeling
of apprehension was based on the tem
per that the Spaniards have displayed
lately.
REFERENCE TO THE MAINE DIS
ASTER. V
The Madrid papers are disposed to
' revive the question of the Maine and
excite public opinion against the United
States on account of the reference made
to this subject in President McKinley's
message to congress. They report that
Senor Montero Rios, president of the
Spanish commission, made an impas
sioned denunciation of President
McKinley at the last joint meeting of
the commissions; but these reports are
practically without foundation. .
Senor Rios did refer to the Maine,
hut In only one calmly worded sen
tence, expressing regret that the pres
ident had spoken, as Span ard3 thought,
unjust of them. The Spaniards' had
already proposed at this conference
? have the responsibility of the Maine
reported upon a joint commission of
the European powers. The American
commissioner refused to listen to thi3
and permitted Senor Rios' reference to
the presidents message to pass un
challenged, as a discussion would have
provoked debate and bad blood.
FRANCE AND THE CUBAN BONDS.
Diplomatic circles in Paris, predict,
as one of . the results of the treaty, a
diplomatic contest between France and
the bnited States which may, have an
important chapter in history. The
French government is reported to have
resolved to take up the case of the
French holders ot Cuban bonds, and it
is believed France will declare that the
repudiation of bonds is the result of
t" i treaty which the victorious nation
impi sc J upon Spain. Tney argue that
by t i treaty, responsibility has been
Rh5 .21 upon America and, therefore,
the French government will endeavor
to exact some pledge for the payment
or guarantee of the bonds. j
PREPARATIONS FOR GOVERN
MENT OF CUBA.
Havana, December 8, 7:25 p. m.
Major General James F. Wade, presi
dent of the United States evacuation
commission, has received certain in
structions from President McKinley
which seems to indicate that he will
be appointed military governor of
Western Cuba. A formal announce
ment is daily expected from Washing
ton though it may be delayed untU the
time comes for a change of flags.
General Greene will be governor of
the city of Havana. He has already
virtually taken hold, as he is having
some of the streets cleaned and is de
vising measures for the sanitation and
policing of the city.
The preparation for a change of flags
is being brought about by degrees and
the transition will not .be abrupt. Al
ready the evacuation of the province of
Havana is complete, except for the
troops stationed in the city. Of these
there are 12,000. General Castellanos
does not fix a date for their withdrawal
earlier than January 1st, but they will
probably retire to Cienfuegos before
Christmas.
ANDEUSEN C;iVS UP HOPE
The Seaman to Hans Today Senti
ment Growing lu 111m Favor
Norfolk, Va December 8. John An
dersen, the Sweedish cook of the Olive
Pecker, who is to be hanged between
the hours of 8 o'clock a. m. and 6
o'clock p. m., for the murder of Mate
Saunders, has apparently given up all
hope of executive clemency. The pres
ident has not been heard from and it
1s believed he will not commute the
sentence. Andersen says he is prepar
ed to die and, as he acted in self-defence
in killing the captain and mate of
the schooner, his conscience is clear of
murder, and he will show the world
that he will go to meet his God without
fear or regret.
It is believed here that he will die
game. It is understood that Andersen
will be executed at 2 o'clock p. m. On
account of the disinclination of any
one here to assist in the execution,
Marshal Treat was compelled to bring
requisite help from Richmond . Since
August 26th, when Andersen was to
have been hanged, public feeling here
Jjas grown rapidly an his favor and
there are very few people who would
not hail with joy a commution of his
sentence.

In the Spanish T7ar Under Inrestlga
tlon Tbe Testimony of surgeon Gen
eral Sternberg
Washington, December 8. The con
duct of the medical service of the army
was taken up today by the war inves
tigating commission and Surgeon Gen
eral. Sternberg was rigidly questioned
about his administration. The medical
department, he said, was eqnJppped on
ly for an army of 25,000 men when
the war broke out and from year to
year the estimates he had submitted
had been materially reduced by con
gress In a policy of economy of ap
propriations. As soon as there was a
prospect of war he had begun prepara
tions, though not making any expense.
He had models of chests made, he said,
and equipment developed, but when
he suggested to Secretary Alger the
propriety of making purchases for his
services, the policy was to wait. He
said at one time there were as many
as 650 contract surgeons employed. He
conceded it was a mistake not to hare
appointed more contract surgeons from
those who had experience in the civil
war.
The department now, he said, has
ample evidence that typhoid cases dur
ing the war were largely mistaken for
malarial fever until the cases reached
the division hospitals and that malaria
also had been diagnosed as typhoid.
He contended that there had been very
little lack of medical supplies during
the war, the great difficulty being that
sigeons frequently preferred other
than the field supply, and an unantici
pated typhoid fever outbreak had also
considerably taxed the field resources.
Delays frequently had been caused
through want of delivery to the proper
medical officer.
Surgeon General Sternberg, concern
ing the relative merits of division and
regimental hospitals, said that while
experience had taught a good deal, the
theories of the department as to medi
cal administration were broken up in
the main.
Coming to the history of the Santiago
movement, General Sternberg explain
ed that there had been an abundance
of medical supplies sent to Santiago
and that the trouble arose in their
landing and distribution. He said em
phatically that he could do no more
in his office than send supplies where
he thought they were needed and re
spond promptly to requisitions.
General Beaver "We are to under
stand you had at all times the hearty
support and good will of those over
you in forwarding the work of your
department?"
"Yes," was the reply, "most undoubt
edly." As to the general condition of troops
in mobilization camps, he said the
trouble could nearly all be summed up
in the two phrases, "neglect of sani
tary measures," and "letting the troops
remain too long in one camp."
Touching the subject of female
nurses, General Sternberg said serious
ly, but somewhat sadly, that "they
were expensive luxuries."
Xle Farmers' Congresi
Fort Worth, Texas., December 8.
The farmers national congress was
slow in getting down to business to- ,
day, on account of the bad weather. '
Among the resolutions adopted was
one favoring aid in constructing: the
Nicaraguan canal, government control
of the same, and another favoring de
velopment or the beet sugar industrv.
A committee to engross the resolutions
and present the same to congress was
appointed.
Resolutions recommending the pass
age of laws providing that grain be
separated from seeds of noxious weed3
before being put on the market was
ordered forwarded to the proper au
thorities. The congress also passed
resolutions favoring the lease or sale
of lands so as to make them taxable
and asks the United States congress
for increased appropriations for rural
free mail delivery; favoring national
legislation to do away with the privi
leges accorded to original packages of
oleomargarine under inter-state com
merce law; prohibiting the branding of
dairy products with the name of the
state or territory in which they are
produced and urging the necessity for
instructions of the principle of agricul
ture in public schools. The resolutions
urge harbor improvements for inter
state commerce as well as for national
defences.
After some lively competition, Boston
was chosen over Des Moines, and Den
ver as the place where the next session
will be held. The congress then ad
journed sine die.
A Ship's Crew In mutiny
Philadelphia, December 8. With a
majority of his crew in irons, they
having mutined, the British ship Jack
Burrill, Captain Robertson, hence for
Santos, with 3,006 tons of coal, passed
seaward today.
While outward bound, the Burrill an
chored at Brandywine shoals and While
there began to leak, but only slightly.
All hands were set to work to pump her
out and while thus engaged decided to
protest against going in the ship on th
ground that she was unseaworthy. Af
ter a most thorough survey the ship
was pronounced seaworthy. This was
told the crew, but still they protested.
Captain Robertson faced the issue
squarely. He sent to Philadelphia for
a sufficient number of men to work the
ship clear of the capes and went out
today. The crew to a man were in mu
tiny and will be kept locked up until
they agree to turn to without further
trouble.

SENATE.
Washington, December 8. At the
opening of today's session of the sen
ate it was decided that the adjournment
today be until Monday next.
It wa3 determined to give one hour
of today's session to the consideration
of pension bills.
In connection with the consideration
of bills on the pension calendar, Sena
tor Vest, (Missouri) said: "I do not
want to be captious about this pension
business and do not want to set myself
up as, a reformer, but this thing of pass
ing a lot of pension bills 6imply by the
reading of the titles and when a quo
rum of the senate is not present hat got
to be stopped."
After referring to the methods by
which pension bills are passed by the
senate, Senator Vest said: "Men of
the south have eat here and permitted
these bills to be passed, having some
delicacy about entering objections to
tee course of procedure. Recent events
have obliterated sectionalism and we
are once more united and are one coun
I try and one treasury. e can, there
! fore, come here and object to this
1 spoliation, and I use the word advised
ly, without fear of having our motives
impugned or our words misconstrued.
We are paying out in round figures
$141,000,000 annually for pensions and
it is our duty to find out why it is that,
, thirty-three years after the close of the
1 civil war, this thing of pension claims
shows so enormous increase. I have
been criticised by some of my people
because I have not taken a more deter
mined stand on this pension question.
I want, however, to pay liberally in
pensions. I regard such payment as a
i sacred duty, but I do object to the
passage of these bills without proper
. consideration and with the same re
strictions that are hedged about other
measures."
- Senator Gallinger, of New Hampshire,
' as chairman of the pension committee,
agreed with Senator Vest in his desire
to have the pension bills carefully con
sidered. He thought a quorum of the
senate ought to be in attendance when
the pension calendar was considered.
During the consideration of bills on
the pension calendar,' Seator Caffery,
of Louisiana, introduced this resolu
tion: "That it is the sense of the senate
of the United States that the president
enter Into negotiations with the gov-
ernment of Great Britian for the pur- j
pose of abrogating or modifying the !
Clayton-Bulwer treaty so far and to
the extent that the same may be deem
ed to prevent the United States from
owning, constructing, controlling or
operating an inter oceanic canal across J
the Isthmus of Darien."
At the expiration of the one hour al
lotted to the consideration, of the pen
sion calendar twenty-six bills had been
passed.
At 1:50 o'clock the senate went into
executive session and at 2:15 o'clock
resumed business in open session.
Senator Morgan called up the Nicara--gua
canal bill with a view to making
it the unfinished business. He moved
that the senate proced to the consid
eration of the bill.
Instantly Senator Pettigrew moved
to adjourn. On this motion the ayes
and noes were demanded. The vote
resulted 13 ayes, 42 noes.
Senator Morgan's motion to proceed
with the consideration of the Nacara
gua canal bill was then carried and
after the bill had been laid before the
senate, thus becoming the unfinished
business, the senate, on motion of Sen
ator Morgan, at 2:25 o'clock p. m., ad
journed until Monday.
HOUSE OP REPRESENTITIVES
. The urgent deficiency bill to provide
for the support of the military and
naval establishments was passed by the
house today, practically without oppo
sition. A fear had been expressed that
the measure might open up a prolonged
debate upon the conduct of the war, but
the democratic leaders decided that
such a debate would properly come
later upon the regular appropriation
bills or upon the bill for the reorgani
zation of the army. There was not a
word of criticism of the war during the
debate. The only point upon which an
issue was raised today was to whether
the bill providing, as It did, for the
pay of the volunteers until July 1, 1899,
might not he construed as a modifica
tion of the law under which the vol
unteers were mustered into service.
Mr. McRae, of Arkansas, offered an
amendment, providing that It should
not be so construed and upon it there
was a general discussion as to the ad
visability of mustering the volunteers
out before the regular army was in
creased. Mr. Cannon finally accepted the Mc
Rae amendment and that removed the
only shadow of opposition to the bill.
A number of amendments were adopt
ed upon the recommendation of the
appropriations committee, which re
ceived some supplemental estimates
after the bill was prepared. The lar
gest of these was an item of $2,000,000
for an emergency fund for the war de
partment, and $378,000 for the ordnance
department, increasing the amount car
ried by the hill to $69,859,852.
When the hill was first called up. Mr.
Underwood, democrat, of Alabama, iu
terrccated llr. Cassca tta dsla
of the appropriations committee, with
a view to securing a statement as to
the disposition to be made of the vol
unteer army.
Mr. Cannon said the treaty of peace
had cot been ratified. It might be rati
fied in January. It might not be rati
fied for months. No one could tell what
was in front of us. We must deal with
a situation. The volunteer army might
be mustered out and Its place taken by
the regular army. That was a matter
for the future to decide but he felt con
fident that the government would be
rich enough and congress wise enough
to meet any emergency.
Mr. Sayers, democrat, of Texas, the
ranking minority member of the appro
priations committee, gave his unquali
fied , endorsement to the bill. It did
not affect In any way, he said, the leg
islation regarding the volunteer or
regular armies.
Mr. Livingston, democrat, of Georgia,
ia supporting the bill expressed the
opinion that the law under which the
volunteers were mustered into service
was subject to double construction as
to the time when they should be mus
tered out. The law said they should
be mustered out when the purpose for
which they were enlisted had been ac
complished or when hostilities had
ceased. He believed if the president
was disposed to keep the volunteers
in the service until the regular army
had been reorganized this bill appro
priating money for their payment
would strengthen his hands.
Mr. McRae, democrat, of Arkansas,
said there was no purpose on his side
of the house to oppose the appropria
tions in the bill, but he did not believe
that its passage should be construed as
in any way interpreting the act creat
ing the volunteer army. He said he
would not have pressed the amend-
ly adopted, had it not been for the
president's declaration in his message
that he would muster out the volun
teer army as soon as the regular es
tablishment was increased. It was
unjust to the volunteers to hold them
in the service when congress had given
a solemn pledge that they should be
mustered out as soon as the war ended.
Replying to a question by Mr. Can
non, Mr. McRae said: "We are op
posed to a large standing army and we
are opposed to holding the volunteers
to perform the duty of regulars and
be used as a club to force us to create
a large standing army. Let reorgani
zation of the army come in the regular
way."
The bill was then passed.
The conference report upon the bill
to render the sureties of consuls, vice
consuls and consular agents liable for
damages in suitsj at law was adopted.
The house adjourned over until Mon
day to give the committees an opportun
Ity to work without interruption.

For the Passage of Ills Bill Increaslug
the Army Ills Heasous fur Ills Post
tlou
Washington, December 8. General
Miles expects to appear before the
house military committee in a few
days to set out personally the reasons
why he thinks his army bill should
be passed. The most urgent is the fact
that immediately upon the formal an
nouncement of the peace between the
United States and Spain, the United
States army may be suddenly reduced
almost a third, and at a time when the
need for troops for garrison purposes
is still pressing. This statement does
riot apply to volunteer troops.
As stated by the president in his
message they, having enlisted for the
Ivor m net oil 1ler.KnfiAl T7tl . l
thp wnr ripnnrtTnpnt npt,ntr n,,(,r ,ho
authority conferred bv comrress at th
last session, sought to recruit the reg
ular army to a war footing to stimu
late enlistments, it pledged itself in a
formal order to discharge upon his
own application any recruit who wishes
to leave the service upon the conclu
sion of peace,, although the nominal
term of enlistment was for two years.
General Miles will refer to the present
prospect of a conclusion of the negotia
tions at Paris and the signature of the
treaty of peace as an evidence of the
necessity for speedy action. He will
also urge that provision be made for
the fortification of Manila.
Lkdy and Her Escort Killed by aJeal

Missouri City, Mo., December 8. A
double murder was committed tonight
