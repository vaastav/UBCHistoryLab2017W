aince Spiritualism has revealt.I t.. us the re

13 no u-e for it in the world to cuine,twhich
depends entirely upon what is meant by the
word "religion," We would as soon have

know of, as some of the spiritual ailaud ills
that pass with ranie jieopl- for religion.

The Chicago Pu4 has lecii guilty of the
meanest thing we ever heaid of. It refers to
the difficulties which the "Pa-sive" managers
are having in securing an- appropriate name
for the head of their Presidential ticket, and
then suggest that they take Gen. McCIellan!
What could lie meaner than that? Still, we
must all admit, that the name of the most
"passive" man in the country would not lie
out of place at the head of the '"passive"
ticket.

The New York World handles the 'Pos
sum policy very gingerly. It "cannot en
dorse the positions of Mr. Adam," nor
does it "at present condemn them." It
thinks the move a good one, neverthele-s it
ventures to express the opinion that "the
transient tnthu-itni of the moment is not
always the mfel criterion of what is wise
and expedient." The World" position on
the 'Possum is muddled very closely after
the position of one ot Hosea Billow's can

on Monday the -1th int. The imjiortance of
this line of road cannot lie over-etiinaied.
For six months we have advocated the build
ing of it. We lielieve in the road now.
The proposition made by the corporators
has not met with favor and we doubt if it
can be carried.
The amended pi opoi-ition eems to us all
right, but it is contended tliit it amounts to
nothing, and that the jieople really vote on
the original proportion. It i a fact that the
amendment U not filed. Tlu inul be a mis
take on the jiart of the corporator". Tiie at
torneys difler as to the question of the Jlegil
effect of the amended proposition. Some
assert that it modifies the original proiio-i-tion
and others a--crt that it does not.
There does not fem to lie any general dis
position manifested tovote for or agiint, and
the impression prevails that it will U. oted

Reports fiom the Xorthern Pacific Rail
road say the thermometer is down to twenty
three degrees below zero and heavy winds
are prevailing. The trains arc stopped by
the drifting snow and the televraph wires
are broken in a number of places. Ttlt
gram. When the project of building the Xorthern
Pacific road was being discussed, some jeo
ple expressed doubts as to the practicability
of operating a road through the high latitude
of Northern Minnesota and Dakota during
the winter month-.; but the friends of the
enterprise were always ready to draw away
all such objection-", with their "Isothermal
lines " This isothermal business is r very
pretty theory, and a fine thing to talk about,
but operating a railroid in the dead of win
ter, along the northern border of Minnesota,
is a horse of another color entirely. Iso
thermal lines are no doubt good things, and
calculated to flourish in the latitude in ques
tion, but the little experience we have al
ready had tells us that railroad lines, and
telegraph lines, being made of grosser stuff,
are liable to be snowed under.

The first number of Senator Boss's tiaper
is before us. Mechanically, it is faultless
neatly made up and hand-omely printed,
though an innovation to the extent of dis
pensing with the big "head" on the first
page. In sentiment it seems to be honest,
independent and sound. His "sjlatatory"
his the ring of the true metal, and did space
permit we hould like to pioduce it in full,
but we have only room for the following par
agraph, which is an index to the tone of the
paper, After reviewing the political situa
tion of the country, hesays:
We shall try to call tli ngs by their right
names. If we believe a man to be a thief,
and think we have sufficient evidence to war
rant us in o doing, we shall, in plain Saxon,
call him a thief, no nutter what party he
belongs to, or whose friend he is. If we be
lieve a public measure to lie franeht with
mischief to the country, we shall resist it to
the best of our ability,' no mailer what party
advocates it.
port ineasur.'s that we believe to be fpr the
. nit umirarr, we snail suiv
best, unaeierrea ny tne tact that they urav
have been proposed by those who differ from
us politically.
We wish the new paper abundant succeas;
we trust its circulation may obtain and its
influence be felt iu every county in the Sate,
for Senator Boss is one ot the few alas,
very few Kausas politicians of whom il is
said by all parties, "He is honest," We
believe be will do jus: what he promises
approve the right and condemn the wrong,
ui.dex all circumstances hence we wish
siiaa, in hia new venture, God speed.

I Tilt Times i K-ueil again this morning
i a double sheet, and we are .Imposed to
J continue the custom from the encouragement
tli ti we have received from many quarters,
although the additional cost is a run-idrrable
item in our expen-es.
lint ihe si.b-cription Ii-t o? TllE TlMts is
cinlinually increasing, and our aderti-ing
pitronage is al-o growing, so that e feel
jii-tified in attempting to meet tm deuiai-ds
of tli.- public, for a well-filled new-paper
upon that day in the week, esjierially in
which the jieople have ample opiortiinily to
read and rtfi.ct upon public events.
The pairons of Tun Times have placed
the paper upon a firm ba-i-, so that its finan
cial condition i eji'V aud the luture looks
1 encouraging. The pajirr will continue to
endeavor to meet iheir approal in all of its
I .h'liartnienta. It will sneak the opinions and
sentiments ot the mivn hone-tly and fear-h--ly,
and maintain an independent position
iijion questions of local as we'l as general in
terest. Such expanses as we are justified in incur
ring to make The Times worthy of the city in
which it is published, and of the State of
which that city is the metropolis, will I
cheerfully a-s'imcd; aud we thank our nu
merous friends for the way in which they
have already recognized oui en leavuik to
make this tupur a first-class journal, and fur
the substantial manner in which theau favors
have been bestowed upon us.
We, therefore, approach them with no at
tempt at a diqday of false modesty, ar.d
request a continuation of their efforts iu ex
tending the circulation and influence of Tiie
Time. We trust that they will get up
clubs, or at least send in an additional name,
from time to lime, and aid us in the good
work of making Leavenworth the noblest
city iu the Missouri Valley. Read this copy
ot the Iper, and if you have no further use
for it, hand it tu your neighbor, and induce
him, if you can, to subscribe for the coming
year. It is not for our interest alone that
you will be working, but for the welfare of
the whole community.
Again thanking our patrons for their
liberal support, we forlicar to say more at
the present, but will continue at our poit of
duty, and endeavor to sjieak honestly, fairly
and .aithfully what we believe to be to the
interest of the people, uikhi every subject
which may pa-s under our attention and be
worthy of thought and di-cussioii.

The Commercial of yesterday gives its
readers a olmu and a qu irter editorial on
"what it cis-ts to lie metropolitan, retrench
ment and reform" and ', "let
our Legislators attend to it." After speak
ing of the salaries of the City Clerk, Treas
urer, Police Judge. Engineer, Street Com-mi-t-ioiuT,
Weigh Master and Council men as
excessive, and saying that the City Attor
ntVs salary is not too much, it clo-es as fol
lows. We have thin adverted iu no spirit of par- j
simony nor a de-ire to carp at small exces-es, j
to me proingai, wasieiui uiaiiner in which j
our f-liy exiteiiuiiures are uiaue. tie siioinu

e most "ladly congratulate the Commer
cial .in t iking a ignition on the right side of
this ipiestion. For nearly two years ie
have advocated reform on this very subject
in and out ol the City Council.
W'v were intending to write an article
for Sunday's Times on this great
runs. We have noticed the
CommaciaVt locals with interest, and when
w- lead the editorial we felt sure that we
could note advocate the proposed reform
without being charged by the acoompli-hed
editors of that paiier with doing so lrom sel-
C-h, personal and interested motives. '
ai-operation of the Commaeial, we pledge all
the aid Tun Times can give to this much
needed reform.

The sum of $37,120 for salaries of city
officers looks large. It is not, however, the
only leak. There is a general looseness in
the auditing of the various' claims that
came before the Council. There is now in
force a resolution which declares tint all
claims shall be referred to the Committee
on Claims Iiefore they are allowed, but it il
not enforced.
A reference to the Clerk's book', and a
comparison of the exj-eii-cs during the last
ten years will show where great savings can
bi made. Seven years ago the city tax was
onlv 1 per cent., now it " is over
3 per cent. Of this, however, we will speak
at another time.
We would ask the Legislature to so amend
the Charter that the salaries of the city of
ficers shall tliall not exceeii the following
sums:

Council, at sa aries not exceeding the sum
now paid. The Weighmaster and Market
toaster sho'ildbeappointed by tl.e Council,
and paid a commission. There is no need
of moiethau one Fire Marshal. The City
Physician can be dispensed with.
It will is seen that in the salaries of
Mayor, Clerk, Treasurer, Judge, Marshal,
Councilmen. Polio-men. and Fire Mar-hal.
the sum of $13,340 can be saved; and a
saving can le made on all other officers, and
also upon all the other expenses of the city.
We have no hesitation in saying that the
current expenses of carrying on the city gov
rrnment can be reduced one-lhirdat least.
Xdw, Mr.lCoiainerciaf, will you join with
us, and demand of our Legislature that they
so amend our City Charter as to enable us to
reduce the current expenses of the city gov
ernment.? We would like to see the same
reform carried out in the County of Leaven
worth. With united iffort, without regard
to party intent-, -we can make the lax
200,000 lesa than it is the preaenf year.

maiden name was Lucy Decker, and she
married a man named Isaac Seeley, and had
two childieu by him. I hey both joined t lie
Mormons at .Nauvoo. Seeley was a dissipat

well. The Prophet saw Mrs. Seelev and
loved her. He s lid it was plain that Seeley

Hampton died. When the Mormons were
driven out of Nauvoo, Mrs. Hampton was
left liehind with six small children, the pro
line! ot her marriage with Hampton. Sub
sequently, she married a Mr. Cole, and by
him had one daughter, named Vflale. When
Vitale was 'our years old, Brigham Young
sent for Mrs. Hamiton to come and live with
him, and so strong was her Mormon faitn
that she at once set out for Utah, accom

the fiscal year 1871, ?H4,fHl,17t.. This
sum includes amounts refunded and allowed

The total amount of manufactured tobam.

cheroots, tfcc, on which tax was collected,
amounts to 1,332,844,307. The increase is
due to the vast change in the law changing
the mode of collecting these articles. The
Commissioner favors the consolidation of
the tobacco tax at the rate of 2-1 cents, if it
can be done without a loss to the Govern

Mr. Rintlall thought the questions of union

the evil of creating a select committee to

that when tiie first Pacific lCailroad was es

up inthe interest of the road, and that the ,
