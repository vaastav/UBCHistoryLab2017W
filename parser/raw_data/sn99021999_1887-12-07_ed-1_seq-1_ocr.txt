liouril tlio president's message.
Hoyd , Mr. Lumbertpon , Mr , Hitchcock uni
Mr. Molklejohn occupied seats In tlio re
M'rved gallery of the seriate , whllo Oovcrnoi
U'lmyor took la the proceedings from the sou
lite shambcr Itself. During the day each um
all of the committee were busily engaged Ii
button holing the senators and members o
congress la thd interest of Omaha at tin
jlaco ) for holding the next national eonvcn
lion. Mr'Hitchcock had n short intcrviev
with Senator Ingulls , during which tlio sen
ntor expressed himself as strongly in fiivo
of Omaha and willing to use his best effort
to advance her interests in cus
it should bo made perfectly clou
that the hotel accommodations fo
taking euro of the immense crowd
which certainly will bo in attendance , ar
adequate. Church Howe was eirenlutin
around among thohouthorn members. Karl ,
in the day Mr , Uoscwatcr piloted a mimbe
of the committee to the chief signal olllcer ;
iiuarters , where ho Introduced them to hi
old friend , General Grccly. General Creel
expressed great interest in the object of th
committee's visit and spoke in the warmes
terms of his former experience In Omalui an
the many friends which ho made during hi
hojourn there. This evening a largely a
tended meeting Is in progress at the Arliiij
ton hotel , to which many western membei
of congress and prominent republican
throughout the country huvo been invited t
confer with the Nebraska committee i
reference to the convention.
There is nothing to bo said about the llgl
over the location of the national convention i
there arc not more than half a dozen men
liers of the committee present , but it is c :
jicctcd that the trains to-moirow mornii
will bring a large number of memoers ai
the canvass will then actively begin. Tl
delegations for the various cities. Chlciig
Philadelphia , Omaha , St I.ouis and Minn
npolls have opened headquarters and ai
ready to commence tlio light as soon as tl
committee airivcs. In the meantime the
nre woking ; among the members of congic1
/Him the various states trying to secure the
influence. Philadelphia-will make a muc
stronger bid than was expected and it is no
believed the cho'ii'o will bo between Chlcag
and that city , with the chances in favor (
Chicago. In the event that the lines ni
closely drawn the Omaha and Mlnneapol
people will favor Chicago in preference 1
Kolng east , but the policy of these t\\
smaller cities is to hold their few vote
hoping that they may bo able to cateli tl
support of either Chicmro or Philadelphia- i
case the light becomes determined , .In
I'hiladelphia people would lather go to Ch
cngo than to either Omaha or Mhineapoli
In fact , Chicago is the second choice (
nearly every man.
The headquarters of the Nebraska delep :
tion at the Arlington were to-night floode
With plilotins and southern men who at
working for Cincinnati. Omalm is gainin
ground as a dark horse , at least. Nebraska
delegation is considerably em-out aged ti
night and the prospects are that the light b
tween Cincinnati and Chicago will become :
strong that ono of thuoutsido cities will s
euro the convention. The Nebraskans a
working with the greatest ojicrgy mid a
ably assisted , not only by people from lov
but some of tlio D.ikotins and a number fro
the noi thwestern states. The Minneapol
delegation is making a vigorous eitoi t , Tin
arrived on a special train this evening ai
many of them were about the headquarte
of the NebrasUans.

to the question , "What is the business a <

explains the phenomenal growth of the pr
rlpa ! c.lUes. This Is the true reason of (
great iisc in realty values rather than t
theory , so generally adopted in the cast , tl
it is simply a result cf a speculative boom

imputation aial wealth to warrar.1 St. Tin
is not ono man in a thousand east of t
Alloghnnlcfi who has any conception of i

strength and wonderful material mid boc
development of the great west. "
As to the causes of tlio recent money str
pency and what legislation he would supg
to prevent n recurrence of such troubl
Senatov Paddock said : "ThisIs a very lai
question , and an am > wcr , satisfactory even
mysojf , could not bo compressed Into an

certain the theory advanced by some at t

real estate speculations in the Wc.st , is fill
clous. The appreciation in real estate v.il
UfliiH In the newer west is the result , chic
of nn eiionrrous.increase of population , bi
m'vis mid wealth fn the past ten years in tl

vastly Increased business Incident to this
phenomenal growth , without a correspond
ing Increase of other facilities. The demand
for additional area for new stores , ware
houses , mills , manufacturing establishments ,
etc. , mid for more residences for the largely
Increased number of people employed under
tills new order of things , naturally and legitl-
mntelj led to an appreciation in rcnl estate
values. This , however , did not affect Um
east In any way , except to Increase the demand
upon It from thai section for moro merchan
dise and manufactfred ware and commercial
facilities required by these prosperous comll-
lions which , in turn , demanded Increased re-
'inlllances. This actually caused an Increase
ol the flow of money to the eastward , instead
of un increased Inflow from the east. 11
money went west for real estate investment ,
and very little went for that purpose , it was
sent In the form of eastern bills ol
exchange , which were Immediately deposited
posited in some bank In n western city am
were quickly returned by such banks us a deposit
posit to some bank in New York. If It hup
pencil to bo used In the purchase of real es
late , most likely it went into the hands of i
settler upon whoso property there was i
mortgaged indebtedness held by some cast
crn capitalist , perhaps for many years
which was paid off , resulting in the return o
tliis money to the east.
" 1 am not sure that competent leglslatloi

"I am confident that legislation can bo de

How the Message WJIH Tlcccivcil.
WASHINGTON , Dec. 0. [ Special Telegra
to the HII : : . ] Tlio president's message wi
a great surprise to republicans and unlvc
sally u disappointment lo democrats. Tl
republicans were surprised to see the mini !
Islratien of the democratic party so read !
favor free trade. Tlib democrats were disu
[ lointcd in finding none of tlio recommend
tions in the message which they had ii
plorcd the chief magistrate to make. Tl
republicans tire frank to admit tlwlr dclig
over the character of tlio message. T ]
comments made by Senator William ' .
Chandler , late secretary of the navy , ai
Senator Hiscock , of Now York , indicate vei
thoroughly the drift of opinion of the prim
pal men of the republican party. Scnat
Chandler said : "Tho message delights in
because it o\ only announces the principles <
the democratic party , and that this ailminl
tration is for free trade. If the party w
only endorse the message and stand to it , v
can sweep the country next year. I a
afraid the whole thing will bo repudiated. "
Senator Hiscock said : "We can can
Now York by at least UO.OOO majority if tl
democrats will only stand upon that phi
form. The republicans want nothing better
Heprcscntulivo McKinley , of Ohio , who
ono of tlio principal members of the coi
mlttco on ways und menus , said : "I am gli
the democratic party lias nt lust been draw
into u hole where it has been compelled
show its bund. It is now free trade again
protection to our industries. "
Quito a number of democratic senators ni
members refused to-night to express i
opinion upon the message and It is read I
seen that they are very slow to endorse
The party in congress will be quite as mil
split up on tlio question of endorsing t
message as on Iho reform of Iho tariff. T
Ohioans are raging furiously over the refi
once to free wool while tl > o southerners n
mad because there was no allusion to t
abolishing of internal revenue luxes.
Ijondem Papers on the Message.
LONDON , Dec. 0. The Morning Post , e-o
menting on President Cleveland's incssni
says : "The message will produce a sen ;
tion in Europe ns well us in America u
strengthen tlio free Irndo cause throughc
Iho world. "
The Daily News says : "Seldom has
American picsldent had a moro import :
lesson to teach. Tlio fact Is , the policy
protection lias been reduced touprnclii-alu
theoretical absurdity. The htono now i
rolling will not stop until the idol pf prot
tion is broken in pieces , "
The Times says : It Is remarkable ti
Mr. Cleveland has tlio courage to confrt
the serried phalanx of protectionists on t
eve of a contest for the presidency. So I
ns Knglund is concerned it is questlonul
whether America will not confront us
formidable rivalry iii both home and forei
markets.
The Chronicle says : It the policy ot Pre
dent Cleveland is adopted , its effect on t
trade of the world cannot full to bo i
men be.
The Standard says : President C'lcvelan
message musks n revolutionary stuiti
point in llseal controversies in the Unit

day was asked : "You are quoted in an inte
view recently as saying that Mr. Hluinc hi
no preference where the convention should 1
held ! "
"I don't think the reporter caught n
meaning exactly. Mr. Hlainc has express *
no desire to have Itio convention in any pn
ticular place and will not do so. There is
feeling , howevcramoiig many of Mr.Hlainc
friends and supporters that perhaps his i
tcresls will bo better served if the couve
tion Is held in a certain locality. "
"Do you mean Chicago ! "
"Yes. " ,
"Aro the wishes of Ms1. Hlaino's frlcn

"I do not think the national committee w

tlio party in our judgment. "
"Is Mr. Hlaine a candidate for rcnomni

"I do not think ho would decline a resioi
iimtlon , but ho is not in position to make
light for it. I mean ho would feel some dc
cuey uboul taking such a course. Mr. Hlui :
made u conlcst for the nomination in IS
and in I SO. In l&Sl ho was again a Candida

lleport of the Sccrotnry of War.
WASHINGTON , Dec. ( ' ( . [ Special Telegram
to the HKK.I The secretary of war made
public his annual rcjort this evening. It oc
cupied .sixty-seven pages of small type , yet
contains llttlo that Is new to Hiu : readers and
which Is not covered by tlio regular press
report. The report states that plans nnd es
timates for the completion of the barracks
and other buildings at Forts Hoblnson , Neb , ,
nnd D. A. Ktissell , Wyo. , have been ap
proved by him and the sums of $7fi,000 ami
550,000 have been respectively appropriated
for these purposes' . Plans nnd estimates.fot
work at San Antonio , Fort Porter and Forl
Kylcy to tlio amounts of . * .10,000 , , &r > , ( KX ) ami
10,000 , respectively , have also been ap
proved.
The secretary snys , among many things :
'I recommend that for the extra expense nee
'ssnrily ' incurred , each commissioned olllcer.
while traveling to or from the place of the
session of a general court martial , court o :
nquiry or retiring board and during its scs
sion , bo allowed u reasonable compensutloi
for such extra expense actually incurred am
hat the judge advocate or recorder of nnj
such court or board shall , in addition t (
ills other pay , receive a per diem ill
owanco for every day ho shall bi
icccssarily employed In such court o :
board. It would , also bo Just tlia
each of the commissioned officers in the judgi
idvocato general's department below tbi
grade of the judge advocate general bi
: iuthori/cd to have one civilian clerk , whosi
compensation and traveling allowances shal
bo the sumo as those of paymasters' clerks
'The pay of non-commissioned officers o
the army is too low. It is often less thai
that of a private on extra duty and the posi
tion Is. therefore , frequently declined by re
liable men. The remuneration should bo in
creased to range from Si"i to "f5o per month a
an incentive for good soldiers to seek , rathe
than to avoid promotion.
The records show that the great majorit ,
of men who desert , or seek discharge , ar
those of less than three years' service. Thi
is a great evil and a constant drain on tin
army. In order to get rid , without injury ti
the government , of recruits who nro inefll
clout , wurtblcsH , discontented and unfltte
for service the .adjutant . general rccon
mends that discharges bo made purcbasabl
at rates that would reimburse the goverr
incut for expense's of recruiting and tram
portation.
[ Press ] . The annual report of the seen
tnry of war shows that the expenditures c
the department during the fiscal yea
amount to $ 441 , 80,10. , ) . The. estimates for th
next fiscal year uegato $ .VI33SIT10) ) again !
an appropriation ' Vthc current year of ) :
0"itOi : ! . The increase is caused by the incoi
poration of an estimate of Ji.'KI,15l , : fo
public works , including river and harbor iir
proveuicnts ; the. expenditures on that ac
count amounting to only ? l03-ll' : ! ( ) . The se <
rotary says the estimate for military ostul
lishment arc based on the actual requiri
mentsof the service. During recent ycai
the appropriation for the transportation c
the army , have been inudquuto to meet th
cost thereof , and the failure to approprint
for that service has caused much embarras
incut. The secretary refers to Genera
Sehotiield's recommendation that at leat
or.o eight inch mU/i'le-loading gun , with a ]
pliunccs for target practice , and one or mot
of the now braiien-loading guns and mortar
bo furnished each military post with u vie'
to improvement of artillery instruction.
Touching Geronimo and his fellow cnptivi
now confined nt Fort Pickeils and Mom
Ternon barracks , the report says that at th
time it is u diftlcult matter to find for them
permanent homo. For many reasons it is In
possible to return them to Arizona ; under e :
isting laws they cannot bo taken to the Ii
dian territory and on the northern rcservi
tions the climate Is too cold for them.
The repoit refers briefly to the diflleulty i
August last in Colorado between the slat
authorities and Colorow's band ot Utcs an
says an effort should bo made for n restitt
tion of their property to the Indians.
The secretary stronglv approves of the rei
ommendatioii contained in General Slier
dan's reports touching the extension of a
possible aid by the government to the m
tiomilguaidof the different states nnd sui
gesting u system of national encampment
for stale militia at the expensoof the nation !
government.
Attention is called to the fact that the P ;
cilic coast is destitute of fortifications , gin
and armament of every description , whi !

WASHINGTON , Dec. tl. The annual report
of Attorney General Garland gives n full tie-
omit of the business of that department dnr-
ng the fiscal year. The number of oidlnary
tilts now pending In the court ot claims , Is
,110 , Involving the sum of ? i : , 'JoO,000. The

'ourt and "I to the supreme court. During
his year there were I'J,1K)7 ) criminal prosccu-
ions , mostly for violations of customs ami
nternnl revenue laws.
The attorney-general calls attention to the
suggestions and recommendations made in
ils last report In regard to mutters culling
'or remedial legislation , and again urges the
iccesslty of iinmediuteuetlon thereon. These
subjects arc us follows : Fees of marshals in
crritories ; pay of deputy marshals ; ' revision
if fee bill ; substitution of fiscal forcalendai
vcar ; protection of civil officers und witnesses :
fees of witnesses und Jurors ; criminal pro
cedurc. In icgiird to tlio confinement ami
treatment of United States prisoners , tin
ittorney-general says ho Is more than evei
convinced of Uio absolute need of a - government
ment penitentiary and reformatory. He ulsc
calls attention to the necessity for addi
tional legislation for restoring and preserving
court records , and makes an urgent npponl ii
jchnlf of certain changes in the judicial sys
: em of the country.
The attorney-general urges an uppropriatlot
for the erection on ground adjacent to the do
liartment of Justice of a suitable building foi
Iho accommodation of the supreme court am !
other courts , mid the commissioners of tin
United States. Ho also asks that congres-
provide for furnishing portraits of Judges o :
the supreme court lo adorn the chambers ol
that court.
Attention Is also invited to the necessity ol
extending the jurisdiction of the fedora
courts to crimes committed upon America ! :
vessels navigating the great hikes.
Congress is urged to take some action for i :
settlement of outstanding claims of witnesses
ami jurors for services during and prior tc
the year IbS.I.
The attorney general says increased expenses
penses in the service of process has been tin
experience of the department since the pass
age of the Inter-state commerce bill. Prioi
to the passage of that bill marshals were fur
nished with free transportation over vurioui
lines of railway whllo in the service of pro
cess. Since that date , however , no frci
transportation is furnished and railway !
charge a mileage greater than the fees al
lowed the marshal for his travel in sucl
service.
The attorney general , in closing his report ,
devotes a chapter to consideration of tin
French spoliation act. Ho says : "Tin
difficulty of the questions involved suggest :
the necessity of iv vigilant , exhaustive
judicial investigation. I therefore rccom
mend the passage of an act amendatory o
the act of tlio ! Uth ) of January , IbS" ) , whicl
shall confer authority upon the court o
claims to render judgment in cases provide !
for by the act instead of reporting their con
elusions to congress , as now required to do
and to grant to either party , government o
claimant , the right of appeal to the suprem
court of tlio United States from the decisioi
of the court of claims on suits filed under tin
act of IbSS. It is not probable that oithei

LOMHIN , Dec. (1. ( [ New York HeraliV
Cable-Special ti * tlio Hr.i : . ] Mr. Smith was
not exin-cted to make startling revelations at
Donenstcr , partly because It was pretty well
umlei stood that there nro none to make. There
was n touch of unaccustomed humor in pro
testing that he could not make a point whlld
spinning out over three columns. Some men
aspire to bo thought brilliant but Smith , who
has found out that safety us well us honor 13
to be found In the humdrum and common
place , never appears before the public with
out exulaining that speaking Is not Ills line
and he is to-iiiiy one of the most peculiar
men In the country which is getting tired o
too much talk. There Is reaction going on
among quiet , sensible people against "elo-
qiieiice.1 They have hud mi overdose of elo
quence and some of us may live to see tha
day when prime ministers will bo chosen be-
cnu > o they cannot speak above live minutes
at u time. Smith will bo disqualified from
this competition for ho can talk us long as
yon please , all the while protesting that ho
cannot.
Of course ho had nothing now to tell about
Ireland. Manv people thought lie would dis
close the intention regauling tlio now rules
of managing the house of commons. Ho tohl
nothing wo did not know before. 1 bellovo
the proposed alterations will require the
house to meet at 'J instead of ( , adjourn at 7
for dinner , reassemble at ' . ) and sit till 12:30. :
At that hour , by a standing order , the ques
tion will bo put by the chair , thus an auto
matic eloturo will constantly work. A moro
rigorous punishment will bo enforced for will
ful or systematic violations of rules. The
general management of the business is to bo
referred , in the first instance , to committees ,
as In congress. This Is the scope of the ro-
viscd procedure at present completed by
the government. If curried it will bo intro
duced into the house mid horrify the old-
fashioned members , but everybody admits
that tlio present rules are broken down nnd
that something must bo done to prevent the
house from sitting fourteen hours at a
stretch. The plain man of business will find
a largo majority supporting him in this part
of his programme.
The ministry all around are having a run of
good luck , the National league evidently
making no headway. Many of its leaders are
mysteriously silent or absent and its internal , .
divisions are not likely to bo lessened. I
state it on the best authority that the Times
is delighted to have O'Donnoll's action
against it to defend , mid that OVponncll ,
whether intent tonally , or not , In playing Into
its hands. Ho proposes tp.sjjmmontho chief
Pumollitns us his witnesses. The Times boa
long desired to get them into the witness box ,
no matter how. There must necessarily bo
many secrets connected with the organiza
tion and the idea is that under skilful cross-
examination must como out the whole history
of the League and its supporters must toll
where the money came from , how it was em
ployed and all the rest of it. O'DonnoH paved
the way for these disclosures. His motives
must bo left io conjecture. The Times has
made great preparations for tlio trial , all its
secret stores of information being in perfect
readiness. Great will bo the sensation when
ever it comes out who supplied the Times
with the material for its articles headed
"Parnellism and Crime. " The office keeps its
secrets , but some tilings leak out abroad. For
one tiling , that the Times' informants were ,
without exception , Irishmen. Not neccssii-
illy renvcunt Parnollites but union men.
Ono is said to have Jul : " nrctty long con
nection with the newspapers ; another il 2St'-
retary of a public man ; a third was actually
connected with the League. I speak from
outside rumor for tlio Timoa is keeping ev
erything dark till the day of trial. It Is
needless to say that the Parnollitcs regard
O'Donnell as an enemy , and some profess to
think that lie has an understanding with the
Times , an unlikely supposition. In any case
the leaders will avoid going into court if
possible. P.irnoll will , most likely , bo out
of the country. Harrington , who knows
nearly everything , will probably be iu jail
whence lie can bo brought as n witness.
Even now It is whispered that O'Donnell
will not force his action to trial. Ho is In
Vienna under the protection of the police.
Assuredly this affair docs not tend to cheer
the main body of Parncllites.
It la said u great pressure is being exer
cised to induce Gladstone to open another
campaign and that ho refuses. Ho Is Im
mersed In literary work of various kinds.
There has long been talk of a book on the
future life , which lias occupied Gladstone for
years past. It may appear before long. Tlio
aged leader seems to have come to tha con
clusion that , for the moment , speaking Is u
waste of breath. The truce of Christmas
will soon bo in force. Next week's pro
ceedings will probably end the burly burly
'till the new year. On the Hth Hulfour
