Scientific American.—Every week
this most valuable periodical pre
sents whatever is new in the world ot
science, art, and manufactures. Full
«f practical information, it discloses
to the thoughtful not only what has
been ascertained, but suggests the
possibilities still to be revealed. For
forty-five years Munn & Co., have
•conducted this paper in connection
with the procuring of patents for new
inventions. The Scientific American
is authority on all scientific and me
chanical subjects, and should be in
every household. Copies of the
paper may be seen at this office and
subscriptions received.
There has been a kick from some
-quarters because our county treasur
er has been collecting delinquent
taxes according to law. This is un
just. Mr. Enger is simply doing
his duty as a public official and is
certainly entitled to no blame- in the
matter. Judge Rose has severely
reprimanded all county treasurers for
not collecting taxes, before, and has
given them strict orders to collect
the taxes right up. If you have not
paid your taxes and have the money
do so and save extra costs, but don't
blame a county official for doing his
iuty. It is refreshing to know that
we have an official like Mr. Enger
who attends to the business of his
office in good shape.
The Minneapolis Tribune fines
time, between shouts for the success
of the convention committee, to pay
its respects to Col. Donan. It says:
Everybody knows P. Donan, and for
that reason little attention is paid to
what he says, but it will be conven
ient to have his record in black and
white when next he comes begging
favors in Minneapolis, as lie certain
ty will. Pat has a free lunch route,
comprising the principal cities of
the union, and Minneapolis is on his
Hst. He will be here again with his
blarney and pathos and every loyal
-citizen of Minneapolis should be pre
pared to give the continental
nuisance the chilling reception he
deserves.
The officials of the Great Northern
road have issued a circular instruct
ing agents to refuse cars except to
elevators or actual farmers. This is
directed against the track buyers, or
independent dealers, and in accord
with the policy of the road which is
not to recognize the street buyer be
cause he is a "disturbing element."
The very tact that a farmer will sell
his wheat to an "irresponsible" track
buyer in preference to elevator com
panies is sufficient evidence that the
track buyer is badly needed in North
Dakota. The grain raisers are
friendly to the independent buyer
and are looking forward to the day
when ho will be permitted to do
business in the state. The street

THE ART IN ACTING.
The Ksnential Point lit Which the Actor
Dlfl'ern from the Dramatist*
A great French critic said once, in
concluding an essay, that acting was the
lowest of the arts. He admitted that it
was an art, but only by courtesy. I
agree with him, and I do not think it
requires much reasoning to arrive at that
conclusion. The mimetic art means
simply the interpretation of the creative
art. Do you catch the idea? A pupil in
the beaux arts may sketch the Venus de
Milo on paper with such vigor that his
fellows are wonderstruck. But the vi
rile reproduction on paper of thc^tatue
does not place the artist next the statue's
maker, nor does the representation of
Phedre put the actor on the pedestal of
Racine.
The sculptor, the painter, the drama
tist, tlie musician—they create.

thou­
sand different persons, a thousand differ
ent things rush to be assimilated by their
genius. The effect is an aggregate of
beings taken from the whole of a na
ture. The individuality of the creative
genius is deepened, but is not annihi
lated. His art is of the highest, because
he is the embodiment, tlie representa
tive of nature. Balzac said that to de
scribe a landscape he turned himself for
the moment into trees and grass, and
fountains and stars, and sunlight, and
thus reached the heart of that which he
would reproduce. In other words, he
created the landscape just as Rousseau
would create the same landscape upon
six inches of canvas.
Bat for the actor—let him storm Par
nassus as lie will there are few leaves in
the laurel crown. It is his function to
represent the creations of genius—to in
terpret them to the public. He has not
the thousand inspirations of the author
he lias only the suggestions of the glow
ing words. The actor is subservient to
the author, notwithstanding he may for*
get his bondage for a brief five minutes
and breathe the free air of genius.
There was an age in France, they say,
when actors were provided simply with
the framework of the drama and left to
improvise the rest. In fact, Goldoni, the
Italian dramatist, speaks of supplying
plots to the French king's players from
which they improvise the speeches. But
we have no evidence that the actors rose
above the level of the Chinese stage of
today, where a similar practice prevails.
Mind j'ou, this opinion is not accepta
ble to the public. I know it must be
unpopular of necessity. The public
looks upon Siddons, Mars or Rachel in
terpreting the grand creations of gen
ius and regards the actor as the em
bodiment of Shakespeare or Racine or
Corneille. The public shouts with ap
plause when the actor trembles with
feigned passion, but this same public
forgets that the words, the action, the
... expression are all simply echoes of an-
No actor brings this genius nearer to
the heart of the public, to be sure, bnt
at the same time let him remember that
he is only the interpreter, after all, and
the shouts are really for Shakespeare
and Racine.
And, to end with a suggestion, is not
the actor's art akin to the journalist's—
that is, in the relation of the latter to
literature? It seems to me that the
playhouse and the newspaper go hand
in hand. They are popular vehicles of
thought, and are within the scope of
the people. Perhaps this is not flatter
ing and perhaps it is unjust—but then,
it is only a suggestion.—Sarah Bernhardt

WASHINGTON, NOV.
30,1891.
The president's message to Congress
is complete, but the precautions are
such that there is pot even a probabili
ty that it will get out before it is sent to
congress. It has not been sent to the
govermcnt printing office to be put in
type and there is a possibility that it
may not gn there at all, as it is now
possible to duplicate each type writteu
page of it as many times as may bo de
sired right in the White House, under
the eye of private Secretary Halford
and Miss Sangar, the president's confi
dential stenographer. Your correspou
dent is assured by one who knows that
the message is one of the ablest ever
written and that it is particularly
strong matter with which partisan
politics should have nothing to do
The last week of the speakership
light begins with a rush. More than
two hundred members of the house
have arrived within tho last forty-eight
hours, which give the friends of the
several candidates material to work on.
Springer of Illinois, has the gaudiest
headquarters and also tho noisiest, al
though a w'eek ago he was not consider
ed "in it" at all. Among his loudest
shouters are a quartette of Illinoians
who held oflice under the Cleveland
administration—Ex-Pension Commis
sioner Black Fred Winston, ex-minis
ter to Persia Lambert Tree, cx-miuis
ter to Belgium and Adlai Stevenson,
ex-lirst assistant postmaster-geneial.
Henry George is lobbying all lie knows
how for Mills, and he openly states he
is doing it because Mills is a free trader.
Crisp's friends claim that he will be
nominated on the first ballot in the cau
cus, but they will not back? their claim
with cash, although men with sporting
proclivities are anxious to give them
the opportunity of so doing. McMillin
says hose who suppose ho intends with
drawing will bo disappointed. He may
not withdraw, but the prediction is
made that if upon auy ballot in the cau
cus the votes he controls will be suffi
cient to nominate Mills they will go to
him. Jerry Simpson is declaring that
the alliance members will flock togeth
er outside the caucuses of the old parties
but the indications are that Jerry will
find it a very small flock, as the South
ern members will it is believed, go iuto
the democratic caucus—they are a very
hungry set and it is only by going into
the caucus that they can get even a
little share of the house patronage, it
is believed that Jerry himself cat be in
duced to go into the democratic caucus
if the right sort of inducement is ofl'er
ed. The caucus will be held next Sat
urday evening and the prediction is
made that if neither Mills nor Crisp is
nominated on one of the first three bal
lots some one of the other candidates
will win on the fourth or fifth ballot.
However, it is at best but guess work-
Postmaster-General Wannamakcr
says that there is not the slightest
foundation for the statement being pub
lished, as special correspondence from
New Orleans in as many of the big
newspaper as will sell their news col
umns, to the effect that the mails going
to that city are in a demoralized condi
tion owing to their being tampered with
by post-oflicials. This letter is beiug
sent out and paid for by the notorious
Louisiana Lottery company, which
finds one-third of its business gone
since the United States mails were, by
act of the last congress, closed to it and
its victims, and it takes this method of
trying to manufacture a public senti
ment against the law. Mr. Wanamaker
says that the mails to and from New
Orleans are as free lrom government
interference as those to and from Phila
delphia or any other city.
The treaty which lias for several
weeks been in course of negotiation be
tween this country and Hawaii has
been completed, signed by the represen
tatives of the two countries and turned
over to the president, who will, if he
approves of it, and it is thought that he
does, sign it and send it to the senate
tor ratification. The treaty has not "of
course" been made public, but it is un
derstood that it will remove all barriers
in the shape of customs duties in either
country from the trade between Hawaii
and the United States.
Whenever the Washington correspon
dent of a democratic newspaper runs
short of legitimate news he sends off a
story about the contemplated removal
of some prominent republican official.
Civil Service Commissioner Roosevelt
was the latest victim, but the story car
ried its own contradiction. It said that
the post.office inspectors who had bsen
investigating Mr. Roosevelt's charges
against the Baltimore postoffico officials
nad recommended Mr. Rooevelt's dis
missal. Sueh a rieiculous assumption
•f authority is unheard of, Tho only,
uth in this story is that the inspectors
$1.50 PER ANNUK
have made a report the i:atutc of which,
