WASHISQTON, Twsd»y, DEC. 4.
Tht President's message WM presented to
the Senate and House, today by bis Private
Secretary, Mr. Glossbrenner. In the House,
the meftsage was read by Col. Forney, the
Chief Clerk, and in the Senate by the Secre
tary.
After attending to the great commercial,
agricultural and other material prospects of
the country, the President asks why is it
then that discontent now so extensively pre
vails, and the union of the States, which is
the source of all those blessings, is threaten
«d with destruction? The long continued
and intemperate interference of the North
ern people with the question of slavery in
the Southern States has at length produced
its natural effect. The different sections of
the Uniea are now arrayed against each
other, and the time has arrived, so much
deplored (bythe Father of bis Country when
toatiie geographical parties have been
formed.
This does not proceed solely from the
cftaim on the part of Congress or the Terri
torial Legislatures to ezcludo slavery from
the Territories nor from the efforts of the
different States to defeat the execution of
the Fugitive Slave Law. But the immedi
ate peril arises from incessent and violent
agitation of the slavery question throughout
the North for the last quarter of a century,
which has produced its malign inllncnces
among tho slaves, and inspired them with
vague notions of freedom. Hence a sense of
.security no longer exists around the family
altar. This feeling of peace at home has
given place to apprehensions of servile in
•urrection. Many a matron throughout the
South retires at night in dread of what may
befall herself and children boforc the morn
ing. Should this apprehension of domestic
danger extend and intensify itself until it
shall pervade the mass of tho southern peo
ple, when disunion will become inevitable
Self preservation is the first law of nature,
and no political union, however fraught with
blessings and benefits in all other respects,
can long continue if the necessary conse
quence be to render the homes and firesides
of nearly half the parties to it habitually and
hopelessly insecure. Soonei or later thehave
bonds ofsiyh. a union must be severed. It
is my conviction that this fatal period has
•ot yet arrived.
After referring to the incessant agitation
against slavery at tho North, for the last
twenty-five years, both by the press and the
people, and asserting that the time of Con
gress is occupied with violent speeches on
this never-ending subject, he remarks, how
easy would it be for the American people to
settle the slavery question forever, and re
store place and harmony to this distracted
country. This can bo done by letting the
Slave States alone, and permitting them to
manage their own State affairs, as they on
ly are responsible before God for slavery
exiating among them, and with which the
North has no more right to interfere than
with tho similar instotions in Russia or Bra
xil. The President still relies on tho good
ssnss and forbearance of the people, alleging
Mr. Buchanan refers to the feet that the
President's province is net to make but to
execute the laws. It is alleged as one cause
for immediate secession, that the
8taies are denied equal rights with the oth
er States in the common territory. But by
what authority are these denied? Not by
Congress, which has never pesesd, and 1
believe never will pass, sny act to exclude
shivery from these territories, and certainly
not by the Supreme court, which has sol
emnly decided that slaves are property, and
like all other property, their owners have a
right to take them into common territories,
and hold them under the protection of the
constitution. The anticipation that Con
gress msy pass some lew obnoxious, is no
good reason for dissolution.
The- President reasserts the power of Con
sacred rights of property are secured by the
constitution.
The most palpable violations of the con
stitntii n«l duly which have yet been com
vnitted consist in the acts of different state
legislatures to defeat the execution of the
fugitive slave law. It ought to be remem
bered, however, that for these acts neither
Congress or any President can justly be held
responsible having been passed in violation
of the federal constitution, they are, there
fore, noil and void. It will be the duty of
the next President, as it has been my own,
to act with'vigor In executing the fugitive
slave law again« conflicting enactments of
ftate legislatures/ We are not to presume
in advance that he will violate his duty,
which would be at war with every principle

J'he Fugitive Slave Law has been carried
into execution in every contested case since
the commencement of the present Adminis
tration. Let us trust that the State Legis

This leads the President to obseite that

to the office of President does not, of itself
afford just causefordissolving the Union.

contracting
Th President then enumerates the pow
ers conferred on Congress by tho federal
government, and that these powers may be
effectual, it also possesses exclusive right to
levy and collect all import duties sad ether
lazes, and has adopted effectual means to
restrain the states from Interfering there*
with. In order still further to secure the
uninterrupted exercise of these high powers
against state enactments, the laws of thea
United States, which shall be made in pur
suance of the Constitution, and all treaties
made or which shall be made under the au
thority ot the United States shall be made
the Supreme laws of the land and the Judg
es in every Court shall be bound thereby,
anything in the constitution or laws,of any
state or territory notwithstanding. The
government created by the constitution, and
deriving its authority from the sovereign
people of each of the several states, has
precisely the same right to exercise its power
over the people of all states, in the enumer
ated cases, that each one of them possesses
over subjects not delegated to the United
States, but reserved to the ststes respectively
or to tho people. To the extent of tho del
egated powers, the constitution of the Uni
ted States is as much a part of the constitu
tion of each state', and is as binding on its
people as though it had been texualiy inser
ted therein. This government, therefore, is
a great and powerful government, invested
with all the attril utes of sovereignty over
the special subjects to which its authority
extends.
It may be asked, then, are the people of
the States without redress against the ty
ranny and oppression of the general govern
ment? By no means. Tho right o( resist
in on the part of the governed against
the oppression of the government cannot be
denied. It exists independently of all con
stitutions, and has been exercised at allthe
periods of tho world's history. But this
distinction must ever observed, be that this
is revolution against an established govern
ment, and not a voluntary secession from it
by virtuo of an inherent constitutional
right. In short, let us look tho danger
fairly in tho face. Secession is neither
more not less thin a revolution. It may or
it may not be a justifiable revolution butand
still it is a revolution.
What in the meantime is the responsi
bi'ity and the position of the Executive? liecussion,
is bound to take care that the law be faith
fully executed, and from this obligation ho
cannot be absolved by any human power.
But what if the performance of this duty in
whole or in part has been rendered imprac
ticable by events over which he could have
exercised no control? Such at the present
moment is the case, throughout the State of
South Carolina, so far as tho laws of the
United States, to secure the administration
ofjustice by means of the federal Judicary,
are concerned. All tho federal officers with
in its limits, through whose agency alone
those laws can bo carried into execution
already resigned. We no longer have
a District Judge, a Distrct Attorney or
Marshal in South Carolina. In fact, the
whole machinery of the federal government,
necessary for tho distribution of remedial
justice among the people, has been demol
ished, and it would be difficult, if not im
possible, to replace it.
The only acts of Congress on the statute
books, bearing on this subject, are those of
February 28th, 17'Jo, and March 3d, 1807.
These authorize the President after he shall
have ascertained the Marshal, with his
potst comitatw, is unable to execute civil or
criminal process in any particular case, to
call forth the militia and employ the army
and navy to aid him in performing this ser
vice having first, by proclamation, com
manded.the insurgents to disperse and retire
peaceably to their respective abodes within
a limited time.
This duty cannot, by say possibility, be
authority exists to issue process and where
there is no Marshal to execute it, and
where, even if there were audi an officer,
the entire population would constitute one
solid combination to resist him. Congress
alone has powertodeckle whether the pres
ent law cannot be amended so astocarry

stituttou.
The revenue still continues to be col
lected as heretofore at the custom house at
Charleston, and should the collector resign,
a successor may be appointed to perform
this duty.
It is not believed that any attempt will
be madetoimpel the United States from its
there by forces but if in this
should prove to be mistaken, the officers in
command of the forts have received orders
to act strictly on tho defence, In such
contingency the responsibility for conse
quences would rightfully rest upon the heads
of the assailants.
Southernproperty
In reference to recognising a seceding
State as an independent government by the
President, he says it would bo a naked aet
of usurpation on his part, and it is his duty
to submit to Congress the whole question,
in all its bearings.
The probability of an emergency soon
arising when Congress will be called on to
decide the question whether it possesses
vvu|nl DMv ICllltflll mi
Union, authorises him to express the opinion
that no such power has been delegatod to
Congress, or to any other department of
the federal government. It is manifest that
there is not among the specific and enumt-r
ated powers granted to Congress, and it is
equally apparent that its exercise is not
neces«ary and proper to carrying into exe
cution any one of these powers. The Presi
dent declares that, to make war upon
State, is at variance with the spirit of the
Constitution.
After having conquered a State, how are
wo to govern it? We could not govern by
despotic power, nor could we by physical
force compel its people to elect a senator
and representatives, and all other duties ap
pertaining to a independent State. The
fact is that our Union rests upon public
opinion, and can never be cemented by the
blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it
cannot live in the affections of the people, it
must ore day perish.

The Union ere long will, if preserved, ren
der ua the most powerful nation on the face
of the earth, In every foreign region of the
globe, the title of an American citizen is
held in the highest respect, and when pro
nounced in a foreign land causes the hearts
of our countrymen to swell with honest
pride. 8urely when we reach the brink of
yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror
from die fetal plunge. By such a catas
trophe the hopes of the friends of freedom
throughout the world would be destroyed
and along night of leden despotism would
enshroud the nation. Our example for more
than eighty years would not only bo lost
but it would be quoted as a conclusive
proof that man is unfit for self-government,
The slavery question like everything,
human, will have its day. I firmly believe
that it has already reached and passed the
culminating point but if in the midst of
the existing excitement the Union shall
perish, the evil may then become irrepara
ble. Congress can contribute much to avert
it by proposing and recomending to the
Legislatures of tho several States the reme
dy for existing evils which tho Constitution
has itself provided for its own preservation.
The President proposes that an explana
tory amendment to the Constitution be
adopted .by Congress, for tho final settle
ment of the true couaiructions of the Con*
stitution on these specific points. He pro
poses—
First. An express recognition of the
rights of property in slaves in the States
where it now exists or may hereafter ex
ist.
Second. The duty of protecting the rights
of slaveholders in the common territories
throughout their territorial existence, and
until they shall be admitted as States into
Union, with or without slavery.
Third. A like recognition of the right of
the master to have his slave, who
haswithered
escaped from one State to another, delivered
up to him.
Fourth. The validity of the fugitive slave
law, enacted for this purpose, together with
a declaration that all State laws impairing
this right are violations of the Constitution,
are consequently null and void.
Such explanatory amendments would, it
is believed, forever tcrminato existing dis
and restore peace and harmony
among the States.
The President then discusses our foreign
relations.
Our relations with Spain have been com
plicated, by the refusal of tho Senate to
ratify the conventionforthe adjustment of
the Cuban claim so called.
The President reiterates his recommenda
tion for tho acquisition of Cuba by a fair
purchase.
With the exceptions of Mexico our rela
tions are generally of a satisfactory charac
ter.
In relation to Kansas the President says,
the desperate band recently assembled under
a notorious outlaw, in the southern portion
of the territory, to resist the execution of
the laws, and to plunder the peaceable citi
zens, will, I doubt not, be speedily subdued,
and brought to justice.
lie recommends a Pacific Kail way, and
congratulates the country upon the appa
rent diminution of the slave trade.
In view of the destitution in Kansas he
recoinended to Congress that if any consti
tutional measure of relief can be devised
that the subject should bo duly considered.

love of tho Union.
THE STATE BEFORE UNION.
Judge Story gives a graphic picture of
what the States were before the adoption of
the present Union, and what they would
likely be again, is it should be dissolved.
"The most opposite commercial regula
tions ox'uted in the different States and, in
many cases, and especially between neigh
boring States, there was a perpetual course
of retalitory legislation, from their jealousies
and rivalries in commerce, in agriculture, or
in manufactures. Foreign nations did not
fail to avail themselves of all the advantag
es accruing to themselves from this suicidal
policy, tending to the common ruin. And
as the evils grew more pressing, the resent
ments of tho States against each other,
and the consciousness thst their local inter
ests were placed in opposition to each other,
were daily increasing tho mass of disaffec
tion, until it became obvious that the dan
gers of immediate warfare between some of
the States were imminent.
"Dut the evil did not rest here. Our
foreign commerce was not only crippled,
but almost destroyed. Foreign nations im
posed upon onr navigation and trade just
such restrictions as they deemed best to
their own interest and policy. All of them
had a common interest to steal our trade
and to enlarge their own. They d"d not
fail to avail themselves, to the utmost of
their advantages. They pursued a system
of the most rigorous exclusion ot our
ping from all the benefits of their own com
merce and endeavored to secure with a
bold and unhesitating confidence, a monopo
ly of our. The effects of this system of op
crations, combined with our political weak
ness, was.soon visible. Our navigation was
ruined our mechanics wore in a state of
inextricable poverty our agriculture was
and the little money still found
in the country was graduUy finding its way
abroad, to supply immediato wants and a
state of alarming embarasment, in that most
difficult and delicate of all relations—the re
lation of private debtors and creditors—
threatened daily an overthrow even of the
ordinary administration ofjustice. Severe
as were the calanities of the war, the pres
sure of them was far less mischevious than
this slow but progressive destruction of all
our resources, all our industry and all our
eredit."
Will not all these evils be frightfully ag
gravated after the Union is dissolved, and
to which we must add the incalculable cal
amities of civil war.
