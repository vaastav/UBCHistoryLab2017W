IMPORTANT.A lady was disapoint
ecl the first time she used DeLand's

was yellow. The trouble was, she
did not allow for the extra strength,

mistake and now declares it to be the
best she ever used.

The whole St. Peter Tribune and
Journal forces are looking for the
Yankee gill who, it is said, came on
from New Hampshire to marry one of
-St. Peter's rich bachelors. So far the
search has been unsuccessful, and the
Tribune pronounces the whole thing
a hoax. The President's message was deA
livered to Congress on the fourth inst.
It is an able, business like document
and receives the commendations of
the leading papers in the country. A
supplement accompanies this issue of
the REVIEW giving the message in its
entirety,
At the meeting of the Minnesota
Valley Medical Association in Man
kito, last week, Dr. C. Berry of this
city was elected first vice president of
the society for the ensuing year. Dr.
F. Welcome, of Granite Falls, was
elected a member. The next meeting
of the society will be held at Le
Sueur.
Lute Ives rises to remark: I must
say that the old story of the crucifix
ion of Christ in effigy at New Ulm is,
in my opinion, a humbug, as I was in
the immediate vicinity of New Ulm at
the lime, and never heaidof it until I
saw it in some religious Boston paper
several months after the Indian out
break."
Some physicians ascribe the pre
valence of diphtheiia at the present
day laigeiv to badly trimmed, smoky
kerosene lamps, which are sometimes
left burning in the chambers all night,
turned down low, filling the room
with their poisonous fumes in con
nection with the fetid atmospheie of
ill-ventilated aiiartments.
There is no need ot anyone going or
sending elsewheio for a nice Christ
mas or New Year's present. Our mer
chants have amply provided tor both
old and young, and their prices are as
low as the lowest. If you wish to
place your money where it will do the
most good for all concerned, patronize
home institutions.
The Lyon County News says its in
formant of the doings in the early
days at New Ulm "is a lespected man.
and one esteemed by and inteiested in
om own people." Now if the Ntivs m
foim.mt will come right out and tell
UL' all ho knows about that "effigy"
he will do our people, in whom
he is so much interested, a great
favor.
Some young "gentlemen" amused
themselves last Sunday night by
throwing stones through the win
dows in Helman's residence, Hoin
burg's machine agency ollice, Schno
brich's and Brust's saloons. This sort
of thing is getting to be a nuisance to
the most patient oE our people, and it
is about time a lesson was taught
some one.
After IJOI ing to a depth of 98 feet
without finding water, the laihoad
company has concluded that thei is
more moistuie neaier the suiface of
the ground and a force of workmen are
now engaged near the Empire mill in
excavating for a reservoir. Quite a
nice stieain of water runs past the
reservoir and this is to be utilized,
provided the Eagle Mill folks will in
terpose no objection.
%*"Mean people take advantage of
their neighbor's difficulties to annoy
them." Mean diseases, such as piles,
rhuematism, constipation, dyspepsia,
malaria, lame backs, etc., take advan
tage of people's exposures and attack
them. It is then that Kidney-Wort
appears on the field and by its timely
agency puts to rout this flock of evil
ailments. I is a friend in need and
therefore a friend indeed.

The Tracy Trumpet says that Mr.
Scbell has purchased the ice-house
and ice, formerly belonging to Law
rence Strait & Co. He will fill this
building and the Hartigan ice-house
this winter, and next summer, run an
ice wagon. Mr. Schell is also sole
agent for the sale of the celebrated
Eagle Mill flour. Herman Seiter's 09
cent store is doing a thriving busi
ness, we understand. Our New UlmSchwerzler

City Clerk Nix gives notice in an
other column of a citizens' meeting,
to be held at 0 o'clock this evening in
Turner Hall. The call does not speci
fy the object of the meeting, but we
understand that tho city treasury has
bcome depleted and that the meeting
is called for the purpose of authoriz
ing a loan of $4,000. Three thous
and dollars of this amount has already
been expended on street improve
ments, the money having been ad
vanced by the Citizens Bank, and the
balance is needed for the payment of
one of tho outstanding city bonds,
which will mature shortly. Other
matters may come up for considera
tion, but the present condition of our
city finances will be the main subject
for discussion.

The Winona Board of Trade has
unanimously adopted a resolution re
questing the Governor to designate
Winona as the place of encampment
for the Second regiment Minn. Nat
ional Guard during the coming year.
committee of the most influential
business men was appointed to confer
with Mayor Ludwig and the city
council and solicit their co-operation
in the matter. The Winona people
have gone to work in this matter in a
business like manner. Waseca and
Faribault are also moving in the mat
ter. The question will be decided at a
meeting of the officers of the regiment
to be held at Mankato January 0th.
Commenting on the proposition to
have Col. Tim Sheehan, ex-Sherlffof
Freeborn county, appointed to the po
sition of Adjutant General, the Pio
neer Press gets off the following
"good one" on Col. Tim:
An old story and a good one can be
told of Sheehan. He was afresh lieu
tenant in command of raw recruits at
Fort Ridgely when that post was be
sieged by the Sioux in 1862. Capt.
Marsh, his superior, was slain with a
score of men while on the way from
the fort to the relief of the Lower
Agency. Lieut. Sheehan announced
the death of Capt Marsh at parade on
the day the news reached the fort.
"Now," said he, when the sad fact was
duly stated, "let us give three groans
for the brave dead!" Victory would
have called for cheers. Death to
Sheehan's Hibernian mind, deserved
groans. The whole company, under
his Bashan-hke lead, gave three such
howls as would have lifted the hair on
the heads of Capt Marsh and his brave
men, had any been left there by their
slayeis.

NEW ULM REVIEW WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1883/ 7
Hon. C. C. Brandt and lady re
turned from their visit to friends in
Ohio last Thursday.
United States Marshal Denny last
Thursday arrested and conveyed to
St. Paul Mr. J. Altermath, the
postmaster at Leavenworth. Mr.
Altermath, it appears, has been in the
habit of using canceled postage stamps
on nearly all the letters written, or at
least addressed, by himself for more
than a year. So reckless had he be
come in Iiis practice that he made no
effort at concealment, and Mi. Childs,
the special agent of the post offi' de
partment, had no trouble at all in
woiking up the ea&e. We abo under
stand that he made a pi actice of sell
ing stamps outside of his office, and
that he is short in his accounts with
the department. He had a hearing be
fore United States Commissioner Cor
doza, last Saturday, which resulted in
his being held in $1,000 bonds to ap
pear at the June term of the United
States court at Winona.
We have just purchased the patent
right for the manufacture and sale of
Arthur L. Pratt's Acme Ledger and
Bill holder in Blown, Redwood,
Lyon and Lincoln comities. Most
kinds of business involve short time
accounts which are treated as tran
sient, sundry memorandum and week
ly. Hitherto this class of accounts
has caused more trouble and annoy
ance than all the other accounts.
The time and space consumed
in running these through the ledger
has induced most parties to resort to
other methods of treatment, none of
which fully meet the case. The habit
of keeping small accounts in the cash
drawer or on a spindle in the form of
memorandums or tickets lenders
them liable to loss. To meet this evi.
dent demand the Acme Ledger has
been designed. The ledger consists of
about three hundred punted bill
heads with a stub at the top having
peiforations similar to a check book,
and is divided into twenty-six pack
ages by dividing leaves of heavy ma
nilla card board, indexed on the right
hand edge. The entire contents aie
detachably secured with a substantial
cover. The manner of using this sys
tem is to post all small memorandums
or weekly accounts in this book either
by making direct charges, which is
very easy on account of the index, or
post from the day book. This system
is particularly useful in keeping ac
counts for weekly and monthly settle
ments. Every time an entry is made
it makes out the bill for that amount,
so that any account can be instantly
referred to, and it is made out in bill
form up to date. When a customer
comes to settle it is only nocessaiy
to turn to his account, receipt it and
tear out, leaving the stun, which gives
a statement of the transaction in a
concise manner. New bill blanks
can be replaced at will. We will
furnish the Acme Leager, complete
with 1,000 bill heads, piinted to order
in an attractive foim, on good paper,
for $3.75. This is little moie than
the cost of so many common bills,
which would have to be used to ren
der an account in regular foim.
Stately Gossip.
The Thanksgiving patty at R. A.
Allen's proved to be a very pleasant
affair.
Mr. O. Goodnough and family will
leave for Wisconsin next week.
The new bridge across Mound Creek
is now nearly completed.
Mrs. Jos. Haggard ielt for Eau-VASES
Clarie last week, to see her son, whoVases
is very sick.
Mr. Oliver Goodnough has exchang
ed forms with a Mr. Reynolds from
Wisconsin.
Mr. C. Balbach caught a large Otter
a few days ago, the first one caught in
this locality this season.
Mrs. M. L. Haggard departed for
Oronocco, where she will stay with
her relations during the winter.
A number of Statelyites met with a
mishap near Mr. Bichelhaupt's place
last Tuesday morning while on their
return from the dance at Mr. Black
man's The "old buss" proved to be a
very unsubstantial affair, one wheel
gave way and it deposited its Sleepy
load down the hillside In a manner
more embarrassing than grotesque.
SMITH.
A Hotel Man's Luck.
Mr. J. G. Tyler, chief Clerk at th
Union Depot Hotel, had rheumatism
in the muscles of the chest and left
shoulder. By applying the Great
German Remedy three days he realiz
ed complete restoration, and he is of
the opinion that there is nothing
equal to the St, Jacobs Oil for pain.
The Great German Remedy is also a
specific for burns and sprains.Salt
Lake (VtaJt) Tribune.
In the Pilot House.
"YCS, 31PI this kind ot work obliges a man toreach
keep sober as a judge Of all men IB tho world,
boat pilots and railroad engineers s&oHld let
liquor alone. For on their clearness of sight and
coolness of head depends the safety of life and
property.'
Keeping his hand on the wheel as he said this,
Mr. A. Brockman, of No. 29) Silver street, Chi
cago, aaded: "Of coarse, some of 'em drink bat
the sober ones have the best positions and the best
pay. Yes, the work and exposure sometimes tells
on as but for my part, I find PARKER'S TONIC to
be all the invigorant I need. I've got a bottle a
board here now, never go on a trip without it.
When I havn't any appetite, or am in any way out
of sorts, it sets me up in no time. If drinking men
would use the Tonic, it would help 'em to break
off (No, that isn't a light-house it's a star, low
down in the water.) As I was saying, the Tonic is
new life bottled up. You see that flag staff? Well,
with a bottle of PAKBEB'S TONIC in the locner I
can keep malaria as far lromme as that, all that
time. My wife has used it for three years for sum
mer complaints and colic, and as an invigorant,
when she's tired out from overwork. She says the
Tonic is a daisy. Good-bye! Don't break your
neck going below."
This preparation which has been known as
PARKER'S GINGKR Tone, will hereafter be adver
tised and sold simply under the name of PARKER'S
TONIC. As unprincipled dealers are constantly
deceiving their customers by substituting inferior
articles under the name of ginger, and as ginger
is really an unimportant ingredient, we drop the
misleading word.
There is no change, however, in the preparation
itself, and all botues remaining in the hands or
dealers, wrapped under the name of PARKER'S
GINGXB TONIC contains the genuine medicine if the
facsimile signature of Hiscox Co. is at the
bottom of the outside wrapp*. an 281.
