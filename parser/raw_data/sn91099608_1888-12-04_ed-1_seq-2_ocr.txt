Soalal Ufa of Ancient Egyptians.
Ciuests who were Invited to a private
house rode thither in thtiir chariots or in
sedan chairs carried by their servants,
and like those now used in India and
elsewhere. If the day was hot the cha
riot or sedan chair was furnished with an
umbrella to keep oft the sun. An
Egyptian gentleman often drove his own
ohanot, but servants attended him to
help him to alight and to take change of
his team and cliariot. While they were
awaiting the announcement of dinner
music was provided, and the principal
features of the house were pointed out
to the guests and, as with us, good man
ners constrained them to praise all they
saw, and especially any curios shown to
them. If visitors desired to wash their
feet or hands before dinner, servants at
tended on them, and In palaces the water
pitcher and basin were of gold. Serv
ants also, as a sign of welcome, poured
from an alabaster or metal box sweet
ointment upon the heads of the visitors
and brought garlands of flowers. To
each guest was also given ,a lotus flower,
which he held,in his hand while he re
mained in the host's house. Wine was
then brought round and both ladies and
men partook of it, using cups of gold
_«i i_,_ m. nted
cheap
"While the guests were being enter
tained with music and dancing, dinner
was being prenared, the meats including
beef, goats nesh and venison while
ducks, geese, teal, quail and other birds
were also provided. Mutton was not
eaten. Great quantities of fish and veg
etables were also served, the feast bein£
exceedingly plentiful, and the dishes
very various. Each dish was placed in
the cetster of the table, and the guests
dipped pieces of bread Into it. When
the host gave the sign, it was removed
and another introduced. The poor could
not, of course, secure such abundance as
this, but lived largely on vegetables,
milk, cheese and fruit At a later period
the Egyptian's love of the table seems to
have increased, so that tbe mode of life
of the higher classes was described as
ever luxurious and even profligate.—A.
Inkeroley in San Francisco Chronicle.
French Canadians In New England.
Who then need wonder at the predic
tion of an able New England statistician,
that beforo the end of the first quarter of
the next century that the French Cana
dians in the New England states will out
number the Anglo-Saxon population?
Why, we have In them already consider
bly more than England conquered in
Canada, with thousands coming yearly
from Quebec to join them. With such
extraordinary progress achieved under
so many disadvantages, tho above pre
diction is far from Improbable.
The social philosopher and American
patriot can find abundant food for specu
lation in the fact that against the Yankee
family of one or two children, and often
none, tho French Canadian will count
his nock of from half a dozen to
a dozen and a half. And the An
glo-Saxon wi\ doubtless continue
to "go west" to a large extent,
while the Frtaich Canadian will probably"
maintain and increase the movement to
the southeast. So we shall, have history
repeating itself. We thnll see the Nor
mans overrunning and taking possession
of another England by the worthy and
beneficent arts of peace, and the judi
cious employment of manners and pow
ers which have enabled this people, from
insignificant beginnings, under most un
favorable and discouraging circum
stances, to build one vigorous state in
North America within a century, and
then undertake the rapid formation of
another.—American Magazine.

an article describing a now hypnotic
phenomenon, in the ueld of a "nogative
hallucination." This term describes a
state in which the suggestion that a ccr
tain person, a certain object in the field
of vision, rcanidua unseen, has been
obeyed. The vtate ia explained as an au-
nihltaJtwo of the ggrcepyoP ta it rg»cha
comtclolIKtiess, Tlio Impression T5
ceiveil, but ignoivd. Having third
party to suggest to one of his subjix-ti
tliat he will bo invisibio to her, it is found
that she does not hear him, see liim or even
feel the prick of a pin when lie holds the
pin, reacting normally to all other per
sons. If, however, Jl. Liegois calls out
impersonally, "Camiilo feels thirsty,
Cuinille will drink a glass of water," she
hears and obeys the command if simil
arly told to stand at his sido, sho does
so and so on for every sense. While
she does not hear him, she none the less
really can hear hiin. There is a sort of
dual personality,, one-half of which
obeys tho negative suggestion, while the
other is automatically regulated, and
obeys any suggestion not directly in con
flict with a previous one. Tho further
development of this study promises in
teresting results.—Science.
Dungcra of Clinmois Hunting:.
The exjxii ienco gained in ordinary deer
stalking is of little uso to tho chainoiii
hunter—tho region in which the game is
to bo seen is so different, while tho agil
ity and watchfulness of the two animals
compel tho cultivation of very different
kinds of adroitness. The man who is fit
to win and wear the much prized "Gam
bort," or long tuft of hair from tho back
of tho winter pelt of tho chamois, re
quires to bo a man of iron muscles, cool
head, unerring eye, and a courago tliat
niust often be prepared to face terriblo
odds, to avoid tho danger of having to
meet others much worse.
Without the power of undergoing fa
tigne and privations it is vain his at
tempting to become an adept in this
sport. And one of the very charms of
the "Gamsjagd" lies in tho knowledge
that ho cannot obtain his success by any
kind of adventitious advantages. Neither
man nor dog can be of any use to hjm.
He must rely entirely on himself and if
once he gets troubled with a dread of
hunger or cold, or abyss or crevasse, or
slippery glissade, ho may much better
try his fortune at humbler game. In
short, chamois hunting is Alpine climb
ing, plus tho fact that it is the antelope,
and not the guide, who selects tho trav
eler's route.—-London Standard.
Gift of Second Sight.
Very much akin to dreams is tho omen
or gift of second sight, that is to foresee
disaster by tho vision of that disaster it
self or some symbol This is a belief that
is most common among the
Scandinavian
and Scotch, the vision of a funeral pro
cession being tho ordinary omen indicat
ing a death. The Germans have a pe
culiar form of second sight which they
call the dopple ganger, that is the double
goer. In this the person who is to die is
astonished by seeing himself, either on
the street or in a room, and sometimes
even in Ills own bod.—San Francisco
Chronicle.
