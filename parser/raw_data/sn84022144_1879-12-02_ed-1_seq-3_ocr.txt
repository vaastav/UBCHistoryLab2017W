The Moretarv of war reports that the war
department estimates fur the G*CM1 vear
ending June 30. 1881, are $40,380,429 93,
the aame being for a leaaanm of money than
any annual estimate rendered to cougress

leaat twelve years.

in recommending such legislation aa will
authorize tha en liniment of the full uuuiber
of twenty-five thousand men for the line of
the army, exclusive of the three ihouHand
four hundred and sixty-three men required
for detached duty, and therefore not availa
ble for aervice in the field.
He alao recommends that congress be ask
ed to provide by law for the disposition ol a
large number of abandoned military posts
andreserrations, which, though very valua
ble in themselves, have been rendered use
less for military purposes by the advance of
civilization and settlement.
He unites with the quartermaster general
in recommending that an appropriation be
made for the construction of a cheap and
perfectly fire-proof building for the safe
storage of a vast amount of money accounts,
vouchers, claims, and other valuable records
now in the quartermaster general's office,
and exposed to great risk of total destruction
by fire.
Healaa recommends, in conformity with
the views of the judge advocate general,some
declaratory legislation in reference to the
military statute of limitations as applied to
the orime of desertion.
In these Beveral recommendations 1 con
cur.
The secretary of war further reports, that
the work for the improvement of the South
Pass of the Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Kidr, made in pnrxuance
of an act of congress, has been prosecuted
during the past year with a greater measure
of success in the attainment of results than
during any previous year. The channel
through the Sonth Paw, which, at the be
ginning of operations in June, 1875, had a
depth of only seven and one-half feet of
water, had, on the 8th of July, 1879, a min
imum depth of twenty-six feet, having a
width of not less than two hundred feet and
a central depth of thirty feet. Payments
have been made in accordance with the
statute, as the work progressed, amounting
in the aggregate to $4,250,000 and further
payments will become due, as provided by
the statute, in the event of success in main
taining the channel no if secured.
The reports of the general of the
army and of his subordinates, pre
sent a full and detailed account of
the military operations for the sup
pression of hostilities amon^ the Indians of
the Ute and Apache tribes, and praise is
justly awarded to the .officers and trcops en
gaged, for promptness, skill and coursge
displayed.
The past year has been one of almost un
broken peace and quiet on the Mexican
frontier, and there is reason to believe that
the efforts of this government and of Mexico
to maintain order in that region, will prove
permanently successful.
This department was enabled during the
past year to find temporary though crowded
accommodations, and a safe depository for a
portion of its records, in the completed east
wing of the building designed for the state,
war and navy departments. The construc
tion of the north wing of the building, apart
of the structure intended for the use of the
war department, is being carried forward
with all possible dispatch, and the work
should receive from congress such liberal
appropriations as will secure its speedy com
pletion.
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
The report of the secretary of the navy
shows continued improvement in that branch
of the service during the last fiscal year.—
Extensive repairs have been made upon ves
sel*, aud two new tihips have been completed
and made ready for sea.
The total expenditures of the year ended
June 30, 1879, including specific appropria
tions not estimated for bv the department,
were $13,555,710.09. The expenses charge
able to the vear, after deducting the amount
of these specific Impropriations, were' $13,
343,317 79 but this is subject to a reduction
of $283,725.99, that amount having been
drawn upon warrants, but not paid out du
ring the year The amount of appropria
tions applicable to the last fiscal year was
$14,538,040.17. There was,- therefore, a
balance of $1,479,054 37 remaining unex
pended, and to the credit of the department
on June 30,1879. The estimates for the fis
cal year ending June 30,1881, are $14,864,
147.95. which exceeds the appropriations
for the present fiscal year $301,897.28. The
reason for thia| increase is explained in the
secreiary's report. The appropriations avail
able for the present fiscal yisar are $14,502,
250.07, which will, in the opinion of the
secretary, answer all the ordinary demands
of the aervice. The amount drawn from
the treasury from July 1 to November 1,
1879, was $5,770,504.12, of which $l,0d5,
440.33 has been refuuded, leaving as the ex
penditure for that period $4,074,053.79. If
the expenditures of the remaining two-thirds
of the year do not exceed the proportion for
these four months, there will remain unex
pended, at the end of the year, $477,359.30
of the current 'appropriation*. The report
of the secretary shows the 'gratifying fact
that among all the disbursing officers of the
pay corps of the navy there is not one who is
a defaulter to tbo extent of of a single dol
lar. I unite with bim In recommending
the removsl of tbe nbservstory to more
healthful location. That institution reflects

DEPARTMENT or
JL'STICK
The appropriation lor judicial expenses,
which
has heretofore been made for tbo
J0,Ue" gross, was sab
divided st tha last session of oongreia, sad
so appropriation whatever was made for
tbe payment of tbe feus of marsha's and
their deputies, either in Ibc service of pro
Mas or forth* discbarge «l other delict
and, since use 30, these ofHccrs have con
tinued tin performance of their duties, with
out compensation from the government,
taking upon themselves ibe necessary in
cidental oat lavs, as w«:i st rendering their
own services. In only a few unavoidable
instances, bsa the proper execution of I he
process or tbe Uulted States railed by rea
son of tbe absence of the reqalslte appro
priation. This course of oflicisl conduct
on tbe part of thase.offlcers, highly credit
able to tbeir fidelity, was advised by the
attorney-general, who Informed them, how
ever, tbat they would necessarily have to
rely for tbeir compensation upon tha pros
pact of ftitan legislation by cosgrtsi. I
therefore especially recommend that Imme
dlate appropriation bs made by congress for
this purpose.
Tbe act making the principal appropria
tion for tbe department of justice at pre
vious sessions bus uniformly contaiosd tbe
following clause: "And far defraying the
expensea which may be Incurred in tbe en
forcement Ofttae act approved February 28,
1870, entitled 'An act to amend an act ap
proved May 30. 1870, entitled 'An act to
enfotca the right of citizens of tbe United
States to vote ID the several states of the
United Htstes, and for other purposes,' or
any acta amendatory thereof or supplement
ary thereto.'"
No appropriation WM made for ibis pur
pose for the current year. As no general
election for members of congress occurred,
tbe omission was a matter ot little practical
importance. Such election will, however,
take place during thvensning year, and tbe
appropriation made for the pay of marshals
and deputies should be sufficient to em
brace compensation for tbo services they
msv be re'quired to perform at sucb elec
tions.
Tbe business of tbe supreme court Is.
at present, largel? in srresrs. It cannot be
expected that more causes can be,decided
than are now disposed of in its annual ses
sion, or that by any assiduity tbe
distinguished msgistrates who com
pose tbe conrt can accomplish more
than la. now done. In the courta of many
of the circuits, also, the business has in
creased to such an extent, that tbe delay of
justice will csll the attention of congress to
an appropriate remedy. It is believed tbat
all is done in each circuit which can fairly
be expected from its judicial force. The
evils arising from delay, are less heavily
felt by the Unittd States, than by private
suitors, as its causes are advanced by the
courts when it is seen that they involve tbe
discussion of questions of a public char
acter.
The remedy suggested by the attorney
general, is the appointment of additional
circuit judges, and the creation of an inter
mediate court of errors and appeals, which
shall relieve the supreme court of a,part of
its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also
obtained for the performance of circuit
duties.
I commend this suggestion to the consid
eration of congress. It would seem to
afford a complete remedy, and would in
volve, if ten additional circuit judges are
appointed, an expenditure, at the present
rate of salaries, of not more than $00,000
a year, which would certainty be small in
comparison with the objtcts to be at
tained.
THE POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the postmaster-general
bears testimony to the general revival of
business throughout the country. The re
ceiptsof the postoffice department for the
fiscal year ended June 20,1879, were $
041,982.80, being $740,405.91 more than the
revenues of tbe preceding year. Tbe
amount realized front tbe sale of postage
stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal
cards, was $7G4,405.91 more than in tbe
preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more
than in 1877. The expenditure of the de
partment were $33,449,899.45, of which the
sum $370,401,04 was paid on liabilities in
curred in preceding years.
The expenditures during the year were
$801,20977 less than in the preceding
year. This reduction is to be attributed
mainly to the operation of the law passed
June 17, 1878, changing the compeniation
of postmasters from a commission on the
value of stamps sold, to a commission on
stamps cancelled.
The amount drawn from the treasury on
appropriations in addition.to the renenues
of the department was $3,031,454.95, being
$2,270,197.80 less than the preceding
year.
The expenditures for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1881, are estimated at $39,
920,900, and the receipts from all sources
at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency to be
appropriated for, out of the treasury, of
$7,710,000.
The relations of the department with
railroad companies have been harmonized,
notwithstanding the general reduction by
congress of their compensation, by the ap
propriation for special facilities, and
the railway post office lines have been great
ly extended, especially in the southern
states. The interests of the railway-mail
service and of the public would be greatly
promoted, and the expenditures could be
more readily controlled by the classification
of the employeesof the railway-mail service
as recommehded'by the postmaster genera],
the appropriation for1 salaries, with respect
to which the maximum limit is alreddy
fixed by law, to be made in gross.
The "postmaster general recommends an
amendment of the law regulating the in
crease ot compensation for increased service
and increased speed on star routes, so as to
enable him to advertise for proposals for
auch increased service and speed. He also
suggests the advantages to accrue to the
commerce of the country from the enact
ment of a general law authorizing contracts
with American built steamers, carrying the
American flag, for transporting the mail
between ports pf the United Btatcs and ports
of tbe West Indies and South America, at a
fixed maximum price per mile, the amount
to be expended being regulaUd by annual
appropriations, in like manner irlth the
amount paid for the domestic Star service.
Tbe arrangement made by the postmaster
general and the secretary of the treasury
for tbe collection of duty upon books re
ceived in the mail from foreign countries,
has proved so satisfactory in its practical
operation thattke recommendation is now
marie, tbat congress shall extend the pro
vision* of the act of March 3, M79, under
which this arrangement waa mad*, ao as to
apply to all other dutiable articles received
the mails from foreign countries.
OUR INDIANS.
The reports of the secretary of the inte
rior and of the commissioner of Indian
affairs, setting forth the present'atate of our
relations with the Indian tribes on our ter
ritory, the measure* taken to advance tbeir
civilization and prosperity, and^ the prog
ress already achieved bv them, will be found
ol more than ordinary interest. The gen
cral conduct of our Indian population has
been so satisfactory tbat the occurrence of
two disturbances, which rvsoltsd in blood'
ab*4 and destruetioa of property, I* all the
mors to be laaMotad.
The history of tbe outbreak on the White
River Ute Maervation ia western Colorado
has become so (miliar by la borate MOM*
in Ibe public press, tbat its remarkableia
cidenta need not be seated here in detail.
It is expected that the settlement of this
difficulty will lead to auch arrangements aa
will prevent further boetile contact between
tbe Indians and tbe border settlements ia
Western Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at tbe
Meeealero agency, in New Mexico, where
where Victoria, the head of a
smalt band of marauders, after
comm'ttlng many atrocities, being vigor
ously cbesed by a military force, nade ale
way across the Mexican border and I* now
on foreign anil.
While these occurrences, In which a com
paratively kmall number of Indiana were en
gaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority
or our Indian population have fully justified
the expectation of those who believe tbat
by human* and peaceful Influences tbe Indi
an can be led to abandon tbe habita of sav
age life and to develop a capacity for useful
and civilized occupations. What tbey have
already accomplished in tbe purauit of agri
cultural and mechanical work, the remarka
ble success which baa attended tbe esperi
mcnt of employing aa. freighters a claaa of
Indians hitherto counted among tbe wildest
ana most Intractable, and tbe general and
urgent desire expressed by tbem for tbeed
ucstion of their children, may be taken as
sufficient proof tbat tbev will be found capa
ble of accomplishing much more if they
coniinuo to be wisely and fairly guided.
The "Indian policy" sketched in tbe report
of Ibe secretary of tbe .interior, tbe object
of which is to mske liberal provisions for
the education of Indian youth, to settle tbe
Iodisns upon farm lots, in severalty, to rive
tbem title in fee to their farms, inalienable
for a certain number of years, and when
tbeir wants are thus provided for, to dispose
by sale of tbe lauds on their reservations
not occupied and used by tbem, a fund
formed out of the proceeda for the benefit of
the Indians, wbicb will gradually relieve
tbe government of tbe expensea now pravi
ded for by aunual appropriations, must com'
mend itself as just aod benificial to tbe In
dians, and as also calculated to remove those
obstructions which the existence of large
reservations presents to the settlement and
development of the country. I therefore
earnestly recommend the enactment of a law
enabliog tbe government to give Iodisns
title in fee, inalienable for twenty fire
years, to tbe farm lands assigned to tbem by
allotment. I also repeat tbe recommenda
tion made in my first annual message, tbat
a law be passed admitting Indiana who can
give satisfactory proof or having, by tbeir
own labora, supported tbeir ramtlies for
number of years, and who are willing to de
tach themselves from tbeir tribal relations,
to tbe benefit of tbe homestead act, and to
grant tbem patenta containing the ssme
provision of Inalienability for a ceitain pe
riod.
The experiment ot sending a number of
Indian children, of both sexes, to tbe Hamp
ton Normal and Agricultural Institute, in
Virginia, to receive an elementarv English
education and practical instruction in farm
ing and other useful industries, has led to
results so promising, tbat it Was thought ex
psdient to turn over tbe cavalry barracka at
Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the interior
department for the establishment of an In
dian school on a larger scale. This school
has now one hundred and fifty-eight pupils,
selected from various tribes, and is in full
operation. Arrangements are also made for
tbe education of a number of Indian boys
and girls belonging to tbe tribes on the
Pacific slope, in a similar manner, at Forest
Grove, in Oregon. These institutions will
commend themselves to the liberalit.
of congress, snd to the philanthropic mu
nificenceof the American people.
Last spring, information was received of
the orgsnization of an extensive movement
in the western states, the object of which
was the occupation by unauthorized persons
of certain lands in the Indian Territory
cedeft by the Chcrokees to the government
for the purpose of settlement by other In
dian tribes.
On the 29ih of April, I issued a procla
mation warning all persons against partici
pation in such an attempt, and, by the co
operation of a military force, the invasion
was promptly checked. It is my purpose
to protect the rights ot the Indian inhabit
ants of that territory to the full extent of
the executive power. But it would be un
wise to ignore the feet that a territory so
large and so fertile, with a population so
sparse and with so great a wealth of unused
resources, will be found more exposed to
tbe repetition of such attempts as happened
this vear, when the surrounding states are
more densely settled, and the westward
movement of our population looksstill more
eagerly for fresh lands to occupy. Under
such circumstances tbe difficulty of main
taining the Indian territory in its present
state will greatly increase, snd the Indian
tribes inhabiting it would do well to pre
pare for auch a contingency. I, therefore,
fully approve of the advice given to them
by the secretary of the interior on a recent
occasion, to divide themselves in severally
large a quantity of their lands as tbey
can cultivate, to acquire individual title in
fee, instead of their present tribal ownerahip
in common, and to consider in what man
ner the balance of their lands may be dis
used of by the government for their benefit.,
adopting such a policy tbey would moife'
certainly secure for themselves the valne of
their possessions, and at the same time pro
mote their progress in civilization and pros
perity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate
the pretent state of things in the territory.
The question whether a change in the
control of the Indian service should be
made, was in theforty-fifth congress referred
to a joint committee of both houses for
inquiry and report. In my last annual me*
sage I expressed the hope tbat the decisiob
of tbat question, then inproipect, "woold ar
rest further agitation of this subject, such agi
tation being apt to produce a disturbing effect
upon tbe service as well as tbe Indiana
themselves Since then, the committee
having reported, the question bat been de
cided in the negative by a vote in the bouse
of representatives.
For the reasons here stated, and in view
of ibe fact that further uncertainty on this
point will be calculated to obstruct other
much-necded legislation, to weaken the
discipline of the service, and to unsettle sal
utary measures now in progress for be
government and improvement of the Indl
sns, I respectfully recommend tbat tbe de
cision srrived at by congress at its last ses
sion be permitted toatand.
TIMBRR DEPREDATIONS.
The efforts made by tbe department of
tbe interior to arrest the depredations on
tbe timber landa of the United Sutea have
been continued, and have met with consid
ersble success. A Isrge number of esses of

AORICDLTOBB.
My recommendationa in former meesagts
are renewed in favor of enlarging tha Csctli
tiea of tbe department of agriculture. Agri
culture is the lading inteifcaVMnd ibe per*
maoent^ industry of uur people. It ta-t* tbe
abundance of agricultural production, as
compared with our home consumption, and
tbe iargeljr IucreaMd and highly profitable
market abroad which'we have enjoyed in re
cent years, tbat we are mainly
indebted for .our preaent proa
perity as a people. We must look
for Its continued maintenance to thefsame sub
stantial resource. There Is no Uranen of indns
try in which labor, directed by scientific knowl
edge. yields sucb Increased prodaction In com
parison with unskilled labor, and no branch of
the public service to which the encouragement
of liberal appropriations can be more appropri
ately extended. Tbe omission to .render such
aid is not a wise econoniy but, on the contrary,
uudoubtly results In losses of Immense sums
annually
that
might be
saved
through well-di­
rected eltorta by the Government to promote
vital interest.
Tbe results already accomplished with the
very limited meana heretofore placed at the
command of the Uepartinent of Agriculture is
aa earnest of what may be expected witb in
creased appropriations for the several purposes
indicated in the report of the Commissioner,
with a view to placing the Uepartinent upon a
footing which wilt enable it to prosecute more
etlectlveiy tbe objects for which it is establish
ed.
Appropriations ae needed for a more com
plete laboratory,for the establishment of veter
inary division of forestry, and for an increase of
force.
The requirements for these and other purpos
es, indicated in tbe report of the commissioner
under Hie bead of the immediate necessities of
the department, will not involve any expendi
ture of money that the country cannot with
propriety now undertake in tbe iuterests ot ag
riculture.
KDUCATION.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau
education the extent to which educational priv
ileges throughout the United States have been
advanced duriug the year. No more fundamen
tal responsibility rests upon congress than tbat
of devising appropriate measures of liuancial
aid to education, supplemental to local action
in the States and Territories, andin the District
ol Columbia. The wise
forethought
of the loun
ers of our government 'lias not only furnished
the basis tor the support of tbe common-school
systems ot tbe newer states, but laid the foun
dations for the maintenance of tlielr universi
ties and colleges of agriculture aud he mecban
ic aits. Measures IU accordance with this
traditional policy for the further beuelit of ail
these Interests, and tbe extension of the saine
advantages to portion of tbe country, it is hop
ed, will receive yo.ur favorable consideration.
To preserve and perpetuate the national liter
ature should be among the foremost cares uf
tlie national legislature. The library .gathered
at the capitol siill remains unprovided with any
suitable accomodations lor its rapidly increas
ing stores. The maguuude and importance ot
the collection, increased as it is by the deposits
made under tue law of copyright, by domestic
and foreign exchanges, aud by the scientific
library ol the binithsouinn Institution, call for
building accommodations wlilcn shall be at once
adequate and lire-proof. The location of such
public building, which should provide for the
pressiug necessities of the present, and for tbe
vast increase^ the nation's oooks iu the future,
is a matter wbicli odd-esses itself to the discre
tion of congress. It is ea ruestly recommended
as a measure which should unite all sutfra ges
aud which should no longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON MONUMENT
The joint commission created by act of con
gress of August 2,for the purpose of super
vising and directing the completion ol the
Washington natiouai monument, ot which com
mission the president a member, has given

as may be necessary lor the completion of this

DI&TnlCT OF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with tho im
