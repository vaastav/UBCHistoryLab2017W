LABOR (KOICTS
Utilized by Workhouse Super
intendent Warner in
Constructing
A MAGNIFICENT HIGHWAY.
Banner Township Takes an Advanced
Step for Good Roads.
ALL PLEASED WITH THE RESULT.
The Work Accomplished at a Comparative
Fxpense Which Will
CEETAIXLI AST0S1SH TUB FARMERS
An important experiment has just been
completed by Henry Warner, Superintend
ent of the Workhouse. He has worked con
victs on the public highways, and built a
magnificent road in Harmcr township. The
prison Is situated in O'Hara township,
but sonic of the township officers have pre
vented any improvements of the roads there
because they were afraid of trying convict
labor, the opportunity having been open to
them for three years past.
The adjacent township of Harmer, farther
up the Allegheny river, however, profiiins
by the discussion of the country road ques
tion in The DisrATCil, concluded to take
a step in advance of the day. Superintend
ent Warner has been for years a warm, ad
vocate ol permanent improvement in rural
highways, and he has alwaysnrgued that by
utilizing convicts and vagrants in such
work it can be done cheaply.
ix iiaiuier lowxsnir.
He had several times proposed to both
O'llara and Harmer townships to let him
rebuild their roads lor them with the labor
of workhouse prisoners. The latter finally
consented, aud so to-day Allegheny county
farmers stand as the first in the State to try
the proposed new system of road improve
ment. Mr. Warner contracted to mate 1,100 feet
of macadamized road at Hulton Perry, and
charge the township exactly what it would
cost. Before it was half finished, the citi
zens weic so well pleased that they got the
Superintendent to agree to build another
stretch of about 1,500 feet of the old Free
port road, at Powers' Run. The work in
both instances was simply repairing or re
building the old main road, which parallels
A Well-Hounded .Roadbed.
the West Penn Kailroad. The first 1,100
feet, at Hulton Ferry, was finished on
Saturdav last, and work will be commenced
shortly on the other, at Powers' Run.
WOKKIXG TJXDEK DISADVANTAGES.
The work was commenced on September
3, and has been continued ever since then,
off and on, as the weather would permit.
The experiment was tried under the most
disadvantaceous circumstances. There was
a great deal of wet weather, some of which
was entirely too bad to permit the men to
work at all. The balance of the time the
of the officers at ?2 CO per day. On this
basis the cost of building the road has been
as follows:
Work ot cotiTicts 5266 50
Work of wagon 220 00
Timoof officers 1S5 00
Gravel 60 00
Stone 21 10
Sewer pipe tor water courses 25 71
Railroad fares 31 W
Freight 3 SI
Pouder for blasting i 46
Total J757 3S
HOW IT "WAS MADE.
The total cot is equal to only G9 cents per
lineal foot. City roadways will average $5 per
lineal foot for paving, and that is only one
side of the street. For both sides, or the
whole of the roadway, it is usually 10 per
foot. But here was the whole of the Harmer
township road made pretty nearly as solid
as a city street at a cost of 69 cents per foot.
While the road made by Mr. Warner is
not exactly macadamized, it is a question if
it is not as good and lasting as though it
were. Here is the way he made it: He
took the old road on its natural level, but
smoothed it off at some points in order to
cut the cutters on cither side as nearly level
as possible. This road from side to side he
rounded off, that is to say, made it higher in
the middle and sloping to the gutter on each
side.
THE BBOKKSf STOXE.
On this was dumped broken stone to the
average depth ot 14 inches. This was the
ordinary blue stone, taken from the quarries
at the side of the road where the men were
working. There is plenty of it in Allegheny
county. While a sandstone, Mr. Warner
contends that it is sufficiently strong, if used
for road making just as he has bandied it.
It was all broken by hand by the convicts in
the quarry in pieces from 3J to 4 inches in
size.
exhibit printed above shows that it was
much less than even $1,000.
SMOOTH AS CITY PAVEMENTS.
The Illustrations accompanying this article
are from photographs taken of the work.'
One of the larger pictures shows 700
feet of the old Freeport Road, immedi
ately in the rear of the workhouse, which
Draining Off the Water.
Mr. Warner built a year and a-half ago. It
was made by the same stone and gravel
method as the Hulton Ferry road, and has
withstood that period without a scar. Not
a cent's worth of repairs has been put on it
since, and when the Hulton Ferry road
settles down Mr. Warner expects it to be as
smooth as this one. The Dispatch re
porter rode in a country wagon over the
road back to tho workhouse and it was ns
Emooth and delightful riding as any Ligo-
V5 - 1
BAD ROAD ABOUT TO BE MACADAMIZKD.
The broken stone on the road was then
covered with bank gravel, this covering be
ing at least two inches thick or more, ac
cording to the quantity of gravel obtainable.
Good bank gravel with some bond in it is a
good protection for sandstone, and Mr. War
ner was particular in selecting it. River
sand will not fill the bill at all, because it
has been so thoroughly washed that there is
no sticking qualities in it It is in myriads
of fine particles. Bank gravel is rather
scarce in Allegheny county, but there is
plentv of it on the workhouse propertv, for
tunately. DEAINING OFF THE TVATEB.
Care was taken to preserve the same water
sheds or height of slopes in both stone
and gravel courses, so that the water would
be well drained off both. A tinv rivulet
had lormerly flowed across the. road at one
point, and a little plank bridge, was consid
ered by old roadmakers ample to cross it.
But Mr. Warner aimed at something more
than crossing it. He fixed it so that the
water can never overflow in Ireshcts upon
the road level and ruin the surlare. Build
ing a stone culvert under the road at that
point he inserted a 24-inch sewer pipe, and
extended it clear under the road to the other
side. It only cost the price of the pipe, but
it forever prevents the water from injuring
the road, and in that is small for its first
coit. At another point a 10-inch sewer pipe
was put in in a similar manner. Three
ideas seem to have been prominent in mak
ing the road, viz., to keep the road well
drained by proper rounding and sewering;
to get solidity with broken stone, and to in-
r XSi?
MACADAMIZED ROAD AFTER A TEAR'S TRIAIi.
earth was generally wet and heavv and hard
to handle Hulton Ferry is three and a
quarter miles north of the workhouse. At
first the couvicts and their overseers were
hauled to and from their work every day in
wagons, but bo vile were the intervening
stretches ol roid that whole hours were oc
lUjiieil in making the roum' trip. So, for
the balance ol the time, the prisoners were
shipped to and Iro on the West Penn Rail
road trains, necessitating the expenditure of
money for fares. The bad roads made team
ing hard, and it was not such an easy thing
to get the proper materials and tools to the
spot.
CHEAP AT TnAT.
Superintendent Warner makes the point
that had the experiment been tried away up
in Findley township, which is one of the
outlying districts of the county, far away
from the workhouse, the work would have
been more quickly and cheaply done, for
the reason ttiat the prisoners, once there,
would have remained until the job was com
pleted. A camp would have been estab
lished in the neighborhood. Two hours'
transit of the meu in the wagons between
Hulton Ferry and Claremont was an im
mense amount of time lost, especially in the
short October and November days.
Yet with all these difficulties to contend
with, the 1,100 feet of road has been con
structed at a cost which will astonish
farmers, and make them wonder what a
difference it, would be where neighborhood
camps would save time and good weather
would cheapen materials. Of course, it will
require the test of time to prove the endur
ing qualities of the roadway, but Mr. War
ner is satisfied to let it
STAND OiT IT MERITS
as perhaps the most solid bit of made road
in Allegheny county townships. He says
it cannot be damaged by the heaviest haul
ing, and that there will be absolutely no
expense for repairs to it in the years to
come.
More than two months of labor on the
1,100 teet ot road, reduced to act in 1 figures,
was equal to the work of 533 laborers, 55
two-horse wagons, and 54 officers lor one
dav. Mr. Warner estimates the value of
the convicts services at 50 cents per dav:
sure permanence by protecting the stone
with the best of gravel.
NO ATTEMPTS AT ESCAPE.
From 17 to 20 convicts were worked upon
the road each day. and for 70 per cent of the
time these squads were in charge of only
one officer. There was never an attempt at
escape, nor were the ball and chain ever
used. The prisoners seemed to enjoy the
liberty of being three miles and more away
from the frowning prison walls, and they
worked willingly, like so many laborers
employed at a rate of pay per diem. They
gave no trouble to the keepers whatever.
But for their convict garb, passengers on
the West Penn Railroad looking at them
from the car windows could not have known
the difference between them and ordinary
road laborers. There was nothing of that
brutality, nor social revulsion at the
spectacle, which some people professed to
fear. In every particular the experiment
was a success.
The farmers of Harmer township are over
joyed at getting a road like this for C9 cents
per foot. The majority of them do not hesi
tate to say the annual cost for repairs here
after will be practically nothing. Thev
want brother farmers from othei sections of
the State to come and see it.
SOME BAD GUESSES.
Some funny things happened, though,
while the Workhouse Superintendent was
making the road. Doubting Thomases
were plenty all through the Allegheny val
ley. The woods at one time seemed lull of
them. One granger from back along Deer
creek approached the official one day, as he
stepped off the train at Hulton Ferry, with
this query:
"Say, Mister Warner, how much is this
here road going to cost? Up in the post
office t'other night Caleb said he had
been figuring on your work, and he didn't
see how it could be finished at less than
$10,493. I sed roaby it would cost that
much."
"Give me $1,000, and I will tell you that
the road is over-paid for," replied Mr. Warner.
That was before he Mew exactly how
that of "the wagons at H per day; the wages J much the experiment wonld cost, but the
4s- ' i
nier block pavement in the city, in fact a
good bit more so because there was more
dirt nnd gravel used here as covering.
Another of the large illustrations shows
the bad stretch of road at Powers' Run to
be tackled next by Superintendent Warner
with his road gang.
A FIGHT IN PROSPECT
AT THE COMING FEDERATION OF LABOR
CONVENTION AT DETROIT.
Socialists to Make an Attempt to Control
the Convention and Depose President
Gompers Statistics on the Eight-Hour
Movcment The Work Laid Out.
Kef York, Dec. 1. The annual conven
tion of the American Federation .ol Labor
that isoTig held in Detroit December 8,
has already created a great deal of-anxious
interest among trades unions. National or
international trades unions will send one
delegate lor 4,000 members or less, two for
8,000, three for 16,000, four for 34,000, and
five for 04,000. State federations, central
labor unions, trades assemblies, local trade
union)!, atld federal labor unions will be en
titled to one delegate each. About 100 dele
gates will assemble at the convention, rep
resenting the most diversified trades In the
country.
A quarrel is expected to take place over
the application for admission that will be
made by the Socialists, who are represented
in the Central Labor Federation of New
York. Lucicn Saniel is the delegate from
this body, and lie is an out-and-out Socialist,
who preaches the doctrines of Karl Marks
and La Salle in order and out of order.
The Central Labor Federation has not yet
sot a regular charter from the American
Federation of Labor. It received blank
credentials to the convention from President
Gompers, who afterward said that he had
not intended to send them. Gompers is op
posed to the admiision of Socialists, and
cannot see any reason why trades unions,
whose business it is to occupy themselves
with industrial questions, should admit
them to membership.
Saniel, however, is a great fighter, and he
has instructions from his constituents to
force Socialism down the throat of the con
vention. Should he be admitted he will at
once proceed to oppose the renomination of
Gompers for President, which office he has
already held for several terms. Should
Saniel not be admitted, he will, according
to instructions from his constituents, call a
mass meeting in Detroit and make it as un
pleasant as possible to Gompers and the
other delegates.
Gompers has been compiling statistics in
regard to the eight-hour movement. The
carpenters fight was the only great one in
this direction, but n number of smaller
strikes for eight bours were also reported as
successful.
Gompers says that 90 per cent of the
strikes for eight hours were accompanied by
an increase of wages. But in no case were
wages reduced.
Some time jigo the Executive Council of
the American Federation of Labor had de
cided that the miners were to make the next
fight for eight bours. Since then Gompers
has had applications from the International
Typographical Union and from the Brother
hood of Painters and Decorators, both of
whom want the support of the Federation in
struggles for eight hours. It is a question
whether the Federation can suppoit more
than one union at a time, but it will do its
best for all.
Another question that will be discussed
by the convention will be as to the advisa
bility of having a general strike fund and
whether unions shall be assessed in cases of
strikes or the funds continne to be raised by
voluntary .subscriptions. In regard to the
question of politics, Gompers does not think
that any steps will be taken to go into inde
pendent political action. Something may
be done to enable workmen to obtainheir
demands by legislation, but Gompers does
not like the idea of allying with any politi
cal parties. The convention will probably
ask for legislation for eight hours for Gov
ernment employes, and will also request
Congress to make the alien contract labor
law more stringent.

ALL OF THEM DEHOfi.
A Quadruple Ueply to the Bill in
Equity Piled bj W. J. -Howard
AGAINST THE CITY AKD OFFICIALS.
Jado Stowe Instructs Grand Jurors in No
Uudeclded Manner.
NEWS OP A DAI IS THE COUNTY C0DUTS
A demurrer was filed yesterdey afternoon
by City Attorney Cleveland and Council
man W. A. Magee, to the bill in equity by
W. J. Howard against the city of Pitts
burg, Mayor, Controller, Treasurer, Finance
Committeemen, present and ex., and the
city depositaries. The defendants ranged
themselves into four classes, and each speaks
its own piece, filing a separate demurrer.
The first is by the city, Mayor Gonrley,
Controller Morrow, and Treasurer Dennis
ton, who say :
"These defendants demur to so much of
the bill as seeks relief against them, and for
cause show:
"First The plaintiff has not, by his bill,
made such a case as entitles him in a court
of equity to any relief from or against de
fendants. "Second Plaintiff in the first prayer of
his bill asks the Court to decree that the
moneys collected and to be collected by the
city and the investment made thereof for
the sinking funds, arc a trust fund, to be
held in trust inviolably pledged for the ben
efit of the bondholders of the city and the
payment of its funded debt, without in any
manner showing that said moneys are not
now held as a trust fund and so inviolably
pledged as fully as though a decree of court
were made for the purpose.
SEEKING FOR A SUBSTITUTE.
"Third Plaintiff in his prayer seeks to
strike down the depositories of the city
which were, regularly chosen by Councils
and to substitute others in their stead, and
this without the consent of Councils, with
out even making them parties to the bill
and without authority of law.
"Fourth Plaintiff in his second prayer
seeks to withdraw the sinking fund of the
city from its regularly chosen depositaries,
to deprive it, through its Councils, of the
care, management and control of funds
which power is vested in them by law, and
to plane said care, management and control
in the hands not so vested and without giv
ing Councils a hearing or making them
parties to the bill.
"Fifth Thecontrol of the sinking fund is
vested by law in Council?, and, as shown by
the bill, Councils have heretofore exercised,
and are now exercising this power.
"The plaintiff in his third prayer seeks to
wrest this power from Councils and place it
in the hands of the City Controller, thereby
striking down a discretionary power vested
by law in a legislative bodyand substituting
the discretionary power of an individual,
and this without any authority of the law.
"Sixth Plaintiff, in the fourth pl.ice.seeks
to add to the terms of si contract duly made
between the city and the Allegheny Na
tional, Farmers' ' Deposit National, "Firt
National and Freehold Banks, and this
without making Councils a party to the bill
and without authority of law.
"Seventh Councils, ns is shown by the
bill itself, are an indispensable party de
fendant. ".Eighth The bill does not charge any
combination,,consniracy or fraud by which
the plaintiff haMnflVr'ed, of islikely tosu
ler, any loss of property.
"The averments in the 9th, 12th, 13th and
14th paragraphs of the bill are scandalous,
scurrilous and impertinent, and the hill as
a whole shows that the plaintiff is not filing
it in good faith ns a taxpayer to protect
him from any possible loss in the handling
of the sinking fund, but merely for some
ulterior purpose of his own in connection
with other corporations and individuals.
"Wherefore, defendants ask whether they
shall be compelled to make any further or
other answer and pray to be dismissed,"
etc.
DEMURRER OF DEPOSITARIES.
The second demurrer was filed by the city
depositaries above named. They add that
they object to the conglomeration which
mixes them up with the other defendants in
matters in which they, the aforementioned
banks are not interested and that the bill is
multifarious in the following among other
respects:
A. That the bill joins as defendants four
Masses: First, the city, Mayor, Controller
and Treasurer; second, present members of
the Finance Committee; third, the former
members of the Finance Committee whose
terms of office expired long before tho filing
ot the bill, and fourth, the banks compris
ing the city depositaries.
Respondents, being merely the depos
itaries or debtors of the city, "should not be
involved in a controversy between a tax
payer and the city whereby he seeks to
personally charge the second and third
classes in the bill with a per
sonal liability for some alleged dereliction
of duty, there being no averment to show
that in any Way these respondents were con
nected with the dereliction. The bill itself
shows on its face that the money on deposit
is subject at all times to the check of the
City Treasurer. Also, it U stated, taking
all to he in good faith, the case disclosed is
one where Councils, having the power to do
so, regulated the investment of the sinking
funds in the purchase of bonds in a manner,
one taxpayer in the city, the plaintiff, thinks
unwise, and ibis taxpayer seeks through a
Court of Chancery to control the manage
ment and investment of the funds without
any application to Councils and notwith
standing Councils, in 'thorn the State
lodged the power to manage and control the
sinking funds, represents every taxpayer in
the city. This, it is evident, one taxpayer
cannot do.
Separate demurrers were filed by the
present members of the Finance Committee
and by the former members. In them the
same ground is taken as contained in the
other demurrn
STJfic'JOR 8TATE TAX
IJquor Dealers Asked o Come to the Cap
tain's Office and Settle. '
Attorneys R. W. T. Frazer and W. M.
Hall, Jr., yesterday entered 20 suits in be
half of the Commonwealth against different
brewers, wholesale liquor dealers and bot
tlers, to collect the State mercantile tax.
The suits are a result of the opinion handed
down by Judge Ewing, recently, in the case
against Pier & Dannals, the brewers,
who had refused to pav the mercantile tar.
They bad claimed that, having paid a li
cense fee to the State, it was all the State
tax that could be imposed on their business.
Judce Ewing, in his opinion, supported this
view which would exempt brewers, bottlers,
etc., from the payment of the mercantile tax,
but in this case, as the firm had neglected to
take an appeal within the time provided by
law from the appraisement, judgment would
have to be entered against them. On the
latter point of not having taken an appeal
the suits were brought yesterday, a test case
having been made in the one of Pier &
Dannals.
Those sned yesterday were as follows: B.
H. Gangwisch, $16; Iron City Brewing

CIMMINAL COURT OPEN.
The Grand Jury Gets Down to Business at
Once Charge of tho Judge List of the
Bills Returned and Those Ignored.
The December term of Criminal Court
opened 'yesterday with Judges Stowennd
Single on the bench. When the Grand
Jury assembled it was found that one jury
man too many had been drawn and ex-Jury
Commissioner John F. Ennis, at his own
request, was relieved. Judge Stowe named
J. G. Weir as foreman of the jury.
The body was charged by Judge Stowe,
who first read from authorities as to their
duties, and spent considerable time explain
ing as to the manner of taking testimony
and determining cases, so that there could
ho no delay. Judge Stowe also called at
tention to the complaints of recent years of
attempts to communicate with grand jurors,
and stated that any mention of a matter to
come before the grand jury was unlawful
and should not be tolerated by a member of
the body, whose duty it was to report it to
court. The court desired to impress upon
them that the grand jury is not an inde
pendent body, but is under control ot and
directly responsible to the court. They
were ordered to report at 9:30 A. M. and re
main until 4 p. 31. and, jurors not conform
ing to this rule would not receive a day's
pay. Simply because a juror did like a
taw was no reason why they should not re
turn a true bill in a case. If the law was a
bad and unpopular one then it should be en
forced, so as to make it odious and finally
repealed.
The true bills returned yesterday were as
follows: v
Fred. Sting, Valentine Lelber, robbery:
Michael Kreutzer. E. 13. Price, felonious as
sault; Annie Atwood, C. T. Cooper, Pearl St.

ARMOUR'S NEW SCHEME.
A Plan to Knock Ont Chicago's Big Stock
Yard Interests.
Chicago, Dec. 1. The Journal this a'
ternoon says that negotiation have been
in progress for several days between the big
packers, Armour, Swift and Morris, who
have recently purchased a large tract of
land at Hammond, Ind., on which to erect
slaughter-houses, and Mr. Stickney, repre
senting the railroad and other interests con
cerned in the proposed new stock yards in
the township of Lyons, situated west of the
city.
S It is understood that an agreement bns
been practically reached by which the pack
ers will relieve the present owners of the
Stickney tract of their obligations, and, in
return, the Stickney syndicate will shift its
railroad and other interests to the Indiana
tract. If this deal is carried through it will
practically settle the transfer of all the
stock yards, packing and slaughtering inter
ests of Chicago into another State.

Tills Sqnaw Winter Liable to be Followed
by a Better Kind.
The dissolving of yesterday's snow storm
into rain was a grievous disappointment to
many people in the country. The roads
had almost gotten itito good condition, for
the first time in two months, and when snow
began to fall farmers dreamed of moving
crops. If Old Probabilities, however, con
cludes to follow old-time precedents, the sit
uation may not be so bad after all. Under
the old regime Indian summer came and
was followed by "squaw winter," after which
there was a spell of good weather.
Last week came the nearest to Indian
summer that we have had for years, so it is
barely possible this may be squaw winter,
and December may have some good weather
in store.

AVASJinrnTOjr, Dec. 1. President Har
rison to-day transmitted to Congress the
following message:
T o tbe Senate and House of ltepreseiita tires:
The reports of the several executive de
partments which will be laid before Con
gress in the usual course will exhibit in de
tail the operations of tbe Government for
the last fiscal year. Only the more im
portant incidents and results, and chiefly
such as may be the foundation of the rec
ommendations I shall submit, will be re
ferred to in this annual message.
The vast and increasing business of tbe
Government has been transacted by the
several departments during the year with
faithfulness, energy and success. The reve
nues, amounting to above 5130,000,000, have.
been collected and disbursed without reveal,
ing, so far as I can ascertain, a single case
of defalcation or embezzlement. An earnest
effort has been made to stimulate a sense of
responsibility and public duty in all officers
and employes of every grade, and the work
done by them has almost wholly escaped un
favorable criticism.
Where the Credit Belongs.
I speak of these matters With freedom be
cause the credit of this good work is not mine,
but shared by the heads of the several de
partments with the great body of faithful
officers and employes who serve under
them. The closest scrutiny of Congress is
invited to all the methods of administra
tion and to every item of expenditure.
The friendly relations of our country with
the nations of Europe and of the East have
been undisturbed, while the ties of good will
and common interest that bind us to the
States of the "Western Hemisphere have
been notably strengthened by the confer
ence held in this Capitol to consider meas
ures for the general welfare. Pursuant to
tbe invitations anthorized by Congress, the
representatives of every independent State
of the American continent and of Hayti met
in conlerence in this Capitol in October,
1889, and continued in session until the 19th
of last April.
Slaxks. an Interesting Epoch.
This important convocation marks a most
interesting and influential epoch in the
history of.the "Western Hemisphere. It is
noteworthy that Brazil, invited while under
an imperial form of government, shared as
a republic in the deliberations and results
of the conference. The recommendations of
this conference were all transmitted to Con
gress at the last session.
The International Marine Conference,
which sat at Washington last winter,
reached a very gratifying result. The reg
ulations suggested have been brought to the
attention ot all the governments repre
sented, and their general adoption is confi
dently expected.
The legislation of Congress at the last ses
sion is in conformity with the propositions
of the conlerence and 'the proclamation
therein provided for will be issued when the
other powers have given notice of their
adhesion.
The conference of Brussels to devise
means for suppressing the slave trade in
Africa afforded an opportunity for a new
expression of interest the American people
feel in great work. It soon became evident
that the pleasure proposed would tax the
resources of the Congo basin beyond the
revenues available under the general act of
Berlin of 1884j
Tne "Work of Civilizing Africa.
The United States, not being a party to
that act could not share in its revision, but
by a separate act the Independent State of the
Congo was freed from the restrictions upon
a customs revenue. The demoralizing and
destructive traffic in ardent spirits among
tbe tribes also claimed the earnest attention
of the conference, and the delegates of tbe
United States were foremost in advocating
measures for its repression. An accord was
reached, the influence of which will be very
helpful and extend over a wide region. As
soon as these measures shall receive the sanc
tion of the Netherlands, for a time withheld,
the general acts will be submitted for ratifi
cation by the Senate. Meanwhile negotia
tions have been opened for a new and com
plete treaty of friendship, commerce and
navigation between the United States and
the Independent State of tbe Congo.
Toward the end of the past year the only
independent monarchical government on the
"Western continent, that of Brazil, ceased to
exist and was succeeded by a republic. Dip
lomatic relations were at once established
with tbe newgovernment,but itwas notcom
pletely recognized until an opportunity had
been afforded to ascertain that it bad popu
lar approval and support. "When the
conrse of events had yielded assurance of
this fact no time was lost in extending to the
new government a full and cordial welcome
into the family of American common
wealths. It is confidently believed that the
good relations of the two countries will be
preserved, and that the future will witness
an increased intimacy of interconrse and an
expansion of their mutual commerce.
The Central American War.
Tne peace of Central America has again
been disturbed through a revolutionary
change in Salvador, which was not
recognized by other States, and
hostilities broke out between Salvador
and Guatemala, threatening to involve all
Central America in conflict and to
retard tbe progress which had been made
toward a union of their interests. The
efforts of this Government were promptly
and zealously exercised to compose their
differences, and through the active efforts of
the representative of United States a
provisional treaty of peace was signed
August 26, whereby the right of the
Bepublio of Salvador to choose its own
rulers wa lecozsiJedWtaieral zeta, the
rhief of the Provisional Government, has
since been confirmed in the presidency by
the assembly and diplomatic reeognition
duly followed.

HARRISON SAYS HE HAS RECALLED MIN
ISTER MIZNER.
The Acts of the United States Kepresenta
' rtve Unauthorized McKinley Slade a
Mistake Concerning Hatroll Other For
eign Relation Considered.
The killing of General Barrnudia on
board of the Pacific mail steamer Acapulco,
while anchored in transit in the port ot San
Jose de Guatemala, demanded careful in
quiry. Having failed in a revolutionary
attempt to invade Guatemala from Mexican
territory, General Barrundia took passage
at Acapulco for Panama.
The consent of representatives of
United States was sought to effect
his seizure, first at Champerico, where
the steamer touched, and afterward at
San Jose. The captain of the steamer re
fused to give up his passenger without a
written order from the United States Minis
ter. The latter furnished the desired letter
stipulating as the condition of hi3 action
that General Barrundia's life should be
spared and that he should be tried only for
offenses growing out of his insurrectionary
movements.
This letter was produced to the captain of
the Acapulco by the military commander at
San Jose, as his warrant to take tne passen
ger from tbe steamer. General Barrundia
resisted captnre and was killed.
Exceeded the Bounds of Authority.
It being evident that the Minister, Mr.
Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his au
thority in intervening, in compliance with
the demand of tbe Guatemalan authorities,
to authorize and effect, in violation of prece
dent, the seizure on a vessel of the United
States of a passenger iu transit charged with
political offenses, in order that he might be
tried for such offenes under what was de
scribed as martial law, I was constrained to
disavow Mr. Mizner's act and recall him
from his post.
The Ilicaraguan canal project, under the
control 01 our citizens, is making most en
couraging progress, all the preliminary con
ditions and initial operations having been r"
accomplished within the prescribed time.
During the past year negotiations have
been renewed far the settlement of the claims
of American citizens against the Govern
ment of Chili, principally growing out ot
tbe late war with Peru. The reports from
ou? Minister at Santiago warrant the expec
tation of an early and satisfactory adjust
ment. Our relations with China, which have for
several years occupied so important a place
in our diplomatic history, have called for
careiul consideration and have been the
subject of much correspondence.
Tho Negotiations With China.
Tbe communications of tbe Chinese min
ister have brought into view the whole sub
ject of our conventional relations with his
country, and at the same time this Govern
ment, through its legntion at Pekin, baa
sought to arrange various matters and com
plaints touching the interests and protection
of our citizens in China. In pursuance ot
the resolution, October 1, ISM, I have pro
posed to the governments of Mexico and
Great Britain to consider a conventional
regulation of the passage of Chinese labor
ers across our Southern and Northern fron
tiers. On the 22d day of August last. Sir Ed
mund Monson, tbe arbitrator selected under
the treaty of December 6, 1888, rendered an
award to the effect that no compensation was
due from the Danish Government to United
States on account ot what is commonly
known as the Carlos-Bntterfield claim.
Our relations with tbe French republic
continue to be cordial. Our representative
at that Court has very diligently nrged the
removal of the restrictions imposed upon our
meat products, and it is believed that sub
stantial progress has been made toward a
just settlement.
Good Effects of the Siraoan Treaty.
The Samoan treaty, signed last year at
Berlin by tbe representatives of. the United
States, Germany and Great Britain, after
due ratification and exchange, has begun to
produce salutary effects. The formation of
the government agreed upon will soon re
place the disorder of the past by a stable ad
ministration, alike jnst to the natives ind
equitable to the three powers most con
cerned in trade and intercourse with tba
Samoan Islands. The Chief Justice has
been chosen by the King of Sweden and.
Norway, on the invitation of the three
powers, and will soon be installed. The
Land Commission and the Mnnicipal
Council are in process of organization. A
rational and evenly distributed scheme of
taxation, both mnnicipal and upon imports,
is in operation. Malietoa is respected as
King.
The new treaty of extradition with Great
Britain, after due ratification, was pro
claimed on tbe 2oth of last March. Its ben
eficial working is already apparent.
Tne difference between the two govern
ments touching the fur-seal question in the
Bebring sea is not yet adjusted, as will ba
seen by the correspondence which will soon
be laid before Congress. The offer to sub
mit tbe qnestion to arbitration as proposed
by Her Majesty's Government has not been
accepted, for the reason that tbe form of
submission proposed is not thought to be
calculated to assure a conclnsion satisfactory
fo either party. It is sincerely hoped that
before the opening of another sealing season t
some arrangement may be effected which
will assure to the United States a property
right derived from Russia which was not
disregarded by any nation for more than 89
years preceding the outbreak of tbe existing
trouble.
Where a Mistake Was 3Iade.
In the tariff act a wrong was done to the
kingdom of Hawaii,which lam bound to pre
sume was wholly unintentional. Duties were
levied on certain commodities which are in
cluded in tbe reciprocity treaty now exist
ing between the United States and the
kingdom of Hawaii without indicating the
necessary exception in lavor ol that king
dom. I hope Congress will repair what
might otherwise seem to be a breach of faith
on the part of this Government.
An award in favor of tbe United States -
in the matter of the claim ot Mr. Vanbok
kelen against Hayti was rendered on.tbI
