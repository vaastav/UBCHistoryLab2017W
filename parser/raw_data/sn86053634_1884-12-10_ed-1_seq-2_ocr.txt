Y,Le;t.-.ns, The shipping trsdo in
American reSsda is and ha for years
been depressed, and the export trade
in American produce is languishing
for want of a market that might be
reached if the shipping trade was in
the Lunds of citizens cf the United
States. Therefore
ilesoived, lhst the Committee on

to enquire w hether it would bo expe

interest of the country, und in the
presence cf the great full which lias
taken place, and is stili iu progress
iu the Y!:gts of labor, and iu the
prices of the products of fhrms, work
shops, and mines, the recommenda
tion of the President and the Secre
tary of the Treasury that the coinage
of silver dolars and the issue of sil
ver certificates shall be immediately
and unconditionally prohibited are
calculated to create alarm, and there
by aggravate the ditliculties of the
situation ; and that, to ttie end that
the public mind may be quieted bv
the assurance that if tho total toI
nme of currency is not to bo enlarg
ed ill correspondence with the in
creasing population and excbangtn
of the country, it shall not at least
be reduced by suspending the coin
age of silver dollars, the Senate de
clares its opinion to be that no Talid
reason exists at the present time for
imposing any new and additional re
striction upon either the coinage of
1 Ivor dollars or the issue of silver
certificates.
Mr. xiiii uesirea the resolution to

A Kurdcrer Haufffd
In the autumn, a fiend in human
form, named Howard Sullivan, a col
ored man, overtook a Miss Watson
while she was on a lonely road on
her way from town to her country
home in New Jersey, and murdered
her for lust and money. He was
hung ou the second inst., at Salem,
N. J., and when about to be swung
o3T, he asked all who hoped to meet
him in heaven to raise their hands.
Nearly every man prefect raised their
handj. lie declared that he was
about to fall into the arms of Jesus.
It ia jrst such miserable spectacles
s that, that gives a ghastly glory to
au e78cntin in the mind of bad peo
pie. If they are taught that r.fter a
thieving and rpurdVrous career they
can l.-o prayed into tha arms of Jesus
and be eternally happy, what use is
there in pursuing a correct life ? If
a life in the service cf the Devil is to
bs changed for a life ia glory merely
by a shout or two for Jesus, the evil
desires 'night as well be indulged,
for if detection comes, and human
society inflicts punishment, aa eter
nal state of happiness awaiti the vil
lain in the other world. That is
about the way the thieves and mur
derers argue, and that is (.hour
the result of the teaching ofacertain
class of theologians. Such preachers
do society a great deal of harm, and
they do a great injury to a certain!
'ass cf people by making them feel
secure of eternal happiness regard
less of what they do. Out upon such
preaching and such preachers that
teach that ths human fiend who lurks
the roadsids and springs out upon
an
l ..cent iriil and violates her nsr-
son and robs her of her money is a fit
rtnljact for heaven. If the murderer
can gt into heaven good for him,
but iu the name of the commonest
deceacy let us be spared ths iniliclion
of a set of Theological teachsrs that
attend upon the murderer and work
him up to a public expression tb&the
is certain to go straight to heaven
from the gallows.
The North American of December
3, 1884, give s au account of the exe
cution of Sullivan as follows :
Sal-m. N. J.. Dec 2. Early this
morcitg one unacquainted with the
events which were totranspiieinthis
generally qmet littie town would
have supposed that it was a fait' day
or gaia occasion 01 simitar n.iture.
Eveiy country road leading to the
place was dotted uith coming wa
gon auu peucsuiaDS, wruie tiie in
coming railroad trains brought many
other anxious, curious persons, who
in common with those coining in
other ways hastened to the centre of
the town and gatherad around tho
Court-House. The street was soon
crowded. Roughly ciad farmers and
laborers jostled against men who bore
the appefuaucQ of merchauta and
men of leisure, against half grown
boys and even little children. The
centre of attraction to all was the lit
tie roughly-built board shed in
which Howard Sullivan was to bo
hanged.
Iu the jail adjacent to which, the
scaffold was to be erected, Sallivan
sat in his room. He had gona to bed
at midnight, after spending several
hours in devotional exercises and
singing negro melodies. "Call me
about seven o'clock." betaid. During
the night he awakened and ate half a
mince pie, which was furnished to
him, but with this exception he slept
as soundly as though he had never
buen branded with the mark of Cain,
and was not on the threshold of death.
It was a few minutesafterseven when
he was awakened by the warden.
His breakfast of buckwheat cakes and
sausage which was brought to hiui a
few moments later from the table of
ex Sheriff Coles, wus the first meal of
which he had eaten heartily. He did
not refuse this, bat merely said Le
would eat later.
Early in the morning several re
porters and others were admitted to
see him. He talked wiiii perfectcalm-
ness, and after a tune ate a nortion
of the breakfast which he had declin
ed at Crst. Soon afterward his father
and mother came to see him, togeth
er with Rev. Richard Miles, one of
the colored clergymen whom ho had
chosen to bo with him in his last
moments. Sullivan etill maintained
his calm demeanor, and during the
visit of his parents parted with ap
parent unconcern from Rev, T. R.
Croshorn, colored, and Revs. "W. V.
Louderbough and William S. Zane,
white, who had visited ltim during
his incarceration. At ten o'clock his
two sisters, Emiiine and Kate, reach
ed the town, coming, in company
with several other colored people, on
a train from Feu wick the nearest
station to their home t Bushtown
They spent a short time wit h him, and
then father, mother, anil sisters turn
ed to take their last farewell. The
mother coiild stand it no longer, but
crying out in a heart brokeu tone,
fainted in the corridor. The sister
Emiiine also partially fainted, but
both were revived and helped into the
street Here they had gone but a
short distance when the mother faint
ed again. She wtui picked up and ta
ken into a tin shop near at baud, where
she stayed until the train left, nearly
two hours iater.
My God ! Must I leave him ? Oh
my brother ! My brother !" shrieked
Emiiine a mouieut after her mother
fainted. Aj she fell she was caught
by hei father, who held her in his
arms for some time, and then laid
her on the cold brick sidewalk while
be chafed her hands to revive her.
She was resuscitated in about a quar
ter of an hour, and taken slowly on
toward the depot wuiliug and mourn
ing for her brother.
Meanwhile Sheiiff Kelty was rush
ing nervously around, in and out of
the jail, preparing for the final act
It was not until the middle of the
forenoon that the gallows and
covered way fiotn tho jail to the
building were completed, the noisy
bang of hammers jarring harsh
ly in the prisoner's ceil, ten feet away
until it was nearly time for him to
die. Almost until the time of the
execution, too, the Sheriff was busy
revising the list of persons who were
to 1)9 admitted. Several of those
who had eagerly sought this privilege
a few days beforo faltered, and con
cluded taut they had rathor not see
the revolting n'jjht, and the names of
others were substituted. The repor
ters of leading daily papers who were
present were, however, persistently
ignored, two only gaining a Jmission.
One of these succeed ad by getting a
re pleat from Sheriff De B. Kiem, who
had loabe 1 the Salem arthonties the
gallows of Moyamensing Prison, and
the other paid 2 for the privilege.
Mr. Smith, t jo editor of a local pa

can't do it. It is impossible. The

of black clothes proyided by ex-Sber-
ia Coies. who, wita Itevs. Richard
Miies and Wiisoo Peterson, both col

man. As Sullivan parsed the head
of tho stairs he re-cogni.ed two or
three persons fctaiuhug there and
calmly hide them good-bye. At ths
foot of the stairs he prised his coffin,
which he looked nt with a serene
smile, Th SiieriiTs deputies and
the few newspnpr reporters win,
were permitted to be present filed in
aiter the party m which tho murder
er walked.
Sullivan with steady trend and a
placid demeanor followed Sheriff
Kelty up the steps to the scaffold.

tremor ia his voice spoke as fol
lows :
'T say good-bye toyouall. I thank

At twenty bine minutes past eleven
Sheriff Kelty pulled tho bolt and the
trap fell wilh n heavy clang, plainly
heard in the street and through the
jail. The body turned slowly with
the tautening of the rope, but there
wm no other motion. The neck of
Howard Sullivan was broken, and the
law had avenged the murder of Ella
Watson. After banging one minute
and ten seconds there was a slight
convulsion. That was all. At four
niinntes past twelve the body was
cut down and given into the charare of
Undertaker Turner, the relatives hay
ing filed a bond that they would not
open the coffin or have a public fun
eral, and later in tha day the murder
er's clay was returned to its native
earth in the Bunbtown graveyard.

Held a Speculative Policy.
Mho
A recent decision by a Pottsville
court in a cs-e of graveyard insur
auce, created uneasiness in graveyard
insurance circles.
Tiie cane was briefly stated in the
Philadelphia Times of tha 4th inst,
an follows :
"v Pottsville, December 3.
The speculative insurance craze
which swept over the country sever
al years ago was revived this weakia
a case at court which attracted con
siderable attention. Among the com
panies which did a profitable busi
ness of the graveyard character was
the ''Prudential," of Harrisburg.
Among the old people who exper
ienced no difficulty in getting a cer
tificate from the prudential was Con
rad Beocher, of Treniont. Although
his days were almost numbered he
secured the policy November 3, 1S7'.,
and in consideration of professional
services rendered Beacher to the
amount of 13 Le immediately trans
furred ths policy to Dr. G. Y. Leiir,
a practicing physician of Tremont.
On the 5th of December the fame
yenr Dr. Leiir gave Beecher a receipt
iu full ''by having his life insured."
Six mouths later Beacher died and
iu accordance with the rules cf the
company Dr. Leiir forwarded the
policy t the Prudential for collec
tion. Three months afterward Lehr
received from the company oa account
of the cert ifie'ate 12,570.1)8 aud on
the 11th of April the remainder, 5S8.

Brecher's widow, who was in very
