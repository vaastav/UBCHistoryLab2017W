"Washington, Pec. 7. An Innovation
in federal government bureau methods,
involving practical co-operativo ns
slatance, metallurgical and cetaln
other Industries of the country in
solving many of the intricato and
complex problems in manufacture, Is
outlined in the annual report of Dr.
K. O. Cottrell, director of the bureau,
mado public today.
This new policy, Is described as a
direct outgrowth of tho world war.
It la declared that not only lias tlio
Bureau of Mines adopted this ad
vanced co-operation with the actual
needs of the industries, but that tho
lending nations of the world are fol-
lowinc suit, determined not to lx
left behind in tho coming race for
supremacy In tho industrial trade of
tho world. Croat Itrituln, it Is said,
is especially alive to this movement.
For this new work the Bureau of
Mines has 13 well organized e.vpeii
ment stations located In the differ
ent mining and metallurgical fields
of thu country, all fitted, Director
Cottrell nays, with the necessary
chemical and laboratory apparatus as

Recording to the Bureau of Mines, that
at present the bureau has agreements
for experimental work with nineteen
industrial concerns, 12 different uni
versities, nnd with state agencies in
11 states.
These co-operative agreements with
the bureau embrace many different
activities. For instance, there Is an
experiment station nt Bartlesville.
Okl.i., 'devoted, entirely to the work
of the petroleum" Industry. Already
in one of the oil fields ot Oklahoma
the investigations ot tho engineers
nre snid to have gone far enough to
indicate that the production of this
field mav be materially Increased be
cause certain of tho productive sands
had no, been recognized by thu oper
ators. Seeking to find additional sources
of motor fuel for tho rapidly Increas
ing number of automobiles, the bu
reau has entered into co-operative
agreements with the states of Utah
nnd Colorado to develop the oil shale
Industry. A' Boulder, Col.i., an ex
perimental oil shale retuit lias been
installed and tests have been begun on
shales 'f that district. At Salt Lnko
City, Utah, similar Investigations nre
being made. Co-operative oil shale

SPEAKS HIGHLY OF PERSON
NEL OF SEA SOLDIERS
Washington, Dec. 7. Tho mechanl
cal condition of America's fleet has
undergone little improvement since the
termination of the wur and the en
gineer performance of tho individual
ships "lias not fieen satisfactory,"
Rear Admiral Gr'ffin, chief ot the
bureau of engineering, says In his
annual report made public today at
the nai department.
commended by tho admiral for having
"successfully .grappled with this sit'
uatlon with at least no retrograde
movement." Admiral Griffin adds hotV'
ever, that the operat'on of the ships
with reject to their mechanical
workings is not by any means what Is
desired although it has been better
than "was reasonable to be expected"
under the conditions.
Admiral Griffin attributed' tho trou
bles of engineering staff mainly to an
Inadequacy of operating personnel,
but explains that the Influx of" raw
recruits coupled with tho constant
ndditlon of new vessels 10 the navy
list has Increased tho problems. The
lnck ot men reacted on the engineer
ing bureau in two ways, the admiral
says.
The number of repair Jobs usually
classed as navy-yard work was great
ly inerensed due to the decreased skill
in operation wh'lo the yards were,
In addition, called upon to perform
much work which ordinarily would bo
bo accomplished by the forces of Indi
vidual ships. The appropilations for
tho upkeep of the fleet were, In many
cases, therefore, used for- the perfor
mance of work ordinar ly done by en
listed men. The unusual demand serv
ed to reduce funds available for major
repair work.
In addition to the oxtr.i cost caused
by the personnel situation, the ndmlnil
says a number of other facts com
bined to increase the difficulties with
wh'ch tho bureau was confronted.
There was a large amount of up
keep work, left over from the war
time operation the report says nnd
with this came closely pared appro
priations in the face of Increased la
bor and material costs.
The navy pay scale also has served
to reduce the number of skilled nnd
technical employes who were nble
to obtain higher wages elsewhere. The
situation, the admiral declares, Is one
wh'ch would occasion concern even
under ordinary elr.-umstanccs.
lWetopment ot tho navy's shoro
establishments has been aided substan
tially. Admiral Griffin says, through
the cessation of work on wartime ox
teiis ons in th plants and the con
sequent reversion of those unused
mateilal.i and equipment to the gen
eral stocks allowed by the 'tipproprla
ticn bllln. I

The pool halls continue to give the
city administration quite a lot of
trouble notwithstanding tho fact that
a recent ordinance was framed with
the Intention ot putting them out of
business.
Irffnunlcipal court this morning R.
A. CroUer was again brought before
the municipal Judge charged with op
erating a pool hall in violation of tho
ordinances and was f'ned $19 and $1
costs. He appealed to the pounty. cour t.
W, L. Shoffner tin the Fame charge
hnd a case continued until 4 o'clock
this afternoon.
These defendants are alleged to
be frequent visitors to the municipal
court, but are said to appeal their
cases In every Instance.
In speaking of nppeals from the
municipal court to thu county court,
one city offic'al stated, this morning
that the usual procedure was not In
keeping with the provisions of the
city charter which would make It
more difficult for defendants to take
this step If the provisions of the
charter were rig'dly adhered to nnd
city section 1S2 of tho city charter
which u-ads ns follows:
"Appeals from Judgment In muni
cipal court allowed from city court
to county court that the Judge of
said court shall fix thu amount of the
appeal bond, which shall be given by
the party appealing within five days,
and shall he s'gned by one or more
good and sufficient sureties to be
npproved by tho mayor, and every
defendant appealing shall be required
to deposit and pay $.1 for transcript
fee to the county court which shall
be paid In cash before any appeal can
be taken, which fee shall go to the
credit of tho police fund."
This official stated that It was of
dally orcurrenco that fines Imposed
by the municipal Judge against de
fendants were appealed to the county
court without the formality of col
lecting this fee.

LEGISLTION IN VIEW
Washington, Dee. President
elect Harding rolled at Ihe White
House tlds afternoon.
Washington. Dec. 7. Sitting In
separate session the house and senate
received tho president's annual mes
sago today and the house adjourned
Immediately afterwards. Tho senate
continued in session for some timo,
however, receiving Its first bills and
resolutions.
Debate on the pending bill to reg
ulnto the meat pneking Industry was
put over In tho sennto until tomor
row and on objection of Senator
Lodge of Massachusetts, the Republi
can leader on Joint war finance cor
poration, as aid to farmers went over
under the rules,
Meantime, negotiations looking to
an agreement on packer legislation
went forward.
It was said that the finance com
mittee proceed Immediately after the
holidays with hearings In preparation
for tax and possibly tariff rate legls
lnt'on that may be finally passed at
an extra session next spring.
Willie the house was marking time
several hours most of its members
were busy with committee meetings
and appropriation measures. Commit
ted meetings included one of the mili
tary affairs committee investigating
wur expenditures.
Means of stimulating commerce nnd
Industry appear to lie uSTtnoHt In
the minds of congressional lenders.
Although house h-adcrs were con
vinced that few measures of conse
quence other than appropriation bill
will lie acted upon as manifest indica
tion that a program ot stabilization for
commerce und industry should take
proeedcncn In commlttis considera

conditions.
In connection with the business leg
islation and overlapping it In some in
stances were tanner relief measures.
While most of these have ns their
purpose the grant ng of Immediate aid
to agriculture In the face of the
present decline of prices, there was
a tetidetw-y toward stabilization.
Washington. tv 7. Receipt of

FROM TIIE REJECTION OK THE
PRFNCIPLES OF DEMOCRACY
AND THE SUBSTITUTION
OF AITOCRACY
.Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil
son's concrete recommendations to
congress In his annual message to
day were:
Revision of the tax laws with sim
plification of the income and profits
taxes.
Independence for the Philippines.
A loan tn Armenia.
Economy in government appropria
tions and expenditures and creation
of a "workable budget system."
Cold storage and other laws affect
ing the cost of living, and the federal
licensing of corporations as recom
mended In previous messages.
Rehabilitation and training of dis
abled soldiers and sailors.
The president did not endorse a
bonus.
Nowhere did Ihe president refer to
the league of nations or the peace
treaty right, except perhaps by Infer
ence, In his opening when he quoted
Abraham IJnroln's "Iet as have faith
that right makes might, and In that
taith let tis dare to do our duty, as
we -tmderstaml hV - -
At its close the president wrote a
paragraph which might be regard)!
as a valedictory, saying:
"I have not so much laid be
fore you a series of recommend-'
tions as sought (o, utler a con
fession of fulth, ot the faith to
stand by until my last fighting
day. I believe this is to be the
tilth of the future and present
nnd of all the victories which
await national action In the days
to come, whether In America nr
elsewhere.
Democracy, the president said, "h
being put upon its final trial."
"The old world," said he. "Is Just
now suffering from a wanton rejection
of the principle of democracy and a
substitution of the principle of au
tocracy Assured In the name but
without the authority and sanction
of the multitude. This Is the time
of all others when democracy should
prove Its purity and its spiritual power
to prevail. It is surely the manifest
destiny of the United States to lead
in the attempt to make this spirit
prevail."
Two ways "in which the I'nlted
States ran assist to accomplish this
great object" were outlined by the
president. They were:
First, by offering the example with
in her own borders of the will and
power of democracy to make and en
force laws which are unquestionably
Just and which are equal in their ad
ministration. ,
Second, by standing for right and
justice as towards individual nations.
"The United States," sold the presl
dent, "cannot refuse the role of cham
pion without putting the stigma of
rejection upon the great and devoted
men who brought its government Into
existence."
His message was transmitted by"
messenger, the president adhering to
his decision not to address congi-emi In
person.
Thn president's message Was not
read Immediately In the senate, which
walled until It had disposed of rou
