AN APPEAL FROM THE SBTTLSE
In anohr ccuma wa publish a peti
tion ttst is biicg circulated among the
actutl setters npon school lands in the
west rddrcGsed to their representatives in
the legislature and praying Icr relief from
certain oppressive features cf the
existlrg land rjstern This petition
originated In Lpscomb county which
perhaps contains more actual settlers
than any ol the upper Panhandle counties
and it will receive the unanimous appro
val cf that class cf cltizsns in the west
The petition is a pltin candid state
ment cf ficts known to all who are ac
quainted wlih the condition
ot the settlers npon school
lands Time after time The Gazette
has pressed their grievances upon the
attention cf the public but inconsiderate
pnjidices hive always proved strong
tnongh heretofore in the legislature to
prevent the adoption of measures of re
lief The Twenty first legislature can find
acts abject which so much needs its at
tention this question of ths settlement
cf the school lands It is a question
which in the hails of the federal congress
commanded the eloquence and the efforts
of Thomas H Benton and Stephen A
Douglas who succeeded In having re
pealed op pressivo laws very similar to
system
which has brought such marvelous pros
perity to the sections in which the federtl
lands were situate
The time has come to face some
disagreeable trctks in relation to
the situation in the school land
districts Rosycolored statements
may snbserve Individual interests bnt
they cannot change conditions and in the
end they aggravate the evils It Is no
exaggerated picture that is drawn in this
petition on the contrary it is the con
servative statement ot m6n whose
Interests are directly opposed to tny
thirg which might excite public alarm
and retard settlement
In the twentyseven conntiea compris
ing the Panhandle ot Texas there were
cist In the late election 2060 votes The
entire population cf these counties is not
la excess cf 7C00 people an
average cf less than 250 to the
county cr to put It more

true that direct railroad
communicaticn wlh this section has
Deen established less than two years but
that was long enough to work a much
greater charge in the country if the usual
Inducements to settlement in a
new country had teen of
fered The stubborn fact is
that the state has dealt with Its landed
hclcicgs after the manner cf an avaricious
and overreaching landlord I has put
conditions upou tleir purchase which
have kept out more than the present
anmber of settlers upon the lands
and are driving others away some
In digust because they have
found their purchases unprofitable
under present conditions others in de
spair bccBuo all their earthly possessions
have been srcrlflced la an effort to meet
the hard exacioas of the law
The effect of this selfish policy
npon the interests of tte west
and Indirectly upon the school fund rev
enues may easily be ascertained by a
comparison of the situation in Greer with
tbat of its sister counties In the Panhan
dle Three year3 ego the population in
Grccr wa3 confined to a few roving bands
of cowboys Abost that time the sgl >
tatioa of tho quesion cf the ownership cf
the county was begun The results fur
nish a startling commentary upon the
policy cf the state towards the west the
mere possibility that Greer county might
revert to the United State and that the
fedtr l land policy might prevail there
ha3 given the cocnty a popula
tlon almost equal to that
of the entire Panhandle besides The
scholastic censm of 1887 revealed the
presence cf ever 575 children within
factolssic again the county Indicatlrg
iccordlng to the uenal proportions In
that section a population cf 3000 This
it should be remembered was
acquired without s rsilroid touching the
ccuaty The sentiments of the people cf
Greer upon the boundary question
furnish farther evidence ot the unwisdom
ot our own systemj Almost without
exception the actual settler chss favors
the claims cf he United States
upon the disputed territory Tfli3 truta
may not be relished by the people cf
Texas but it is a tm > h and one tor which
the oppresslva attitude cf the state
towards the settler Is responsible
That there are not fitly thousand peo
ple in the Panhandle ot Texas to day is
due solely to tha public school land ej
torn ct the etato It may well be ques
tioned whetSer the interests of that sec
tion and cf the state st large wculd
not have been better snbierv3d under a
system cf granting homestead gratuities
to settlers than under the policy which
has prevailed The history of this coun
try front the earliest to the latest eettla
tnents verifies the assertion of the petition
tht It is about all that a new country
Is wonh to settie end lmprova lt
It reveals another Iacr K < lhat

present it has been the settled policy cf
ill governments to allot public
lands tmccg their citizens
ts a juai reward for the hardships to be
uedtrgona in the development of uncccu
pi 3d territory
The Ttxss system demands of the set
tler that he shall share with the state
prcfl3 dependent wholly upon his
toil It Is mora immoral than the
conracts ot the worst cf U3urerr
or not content with unlawful advantage
It claim3 an Interest in the sweat and Ml
ot the pioneer who Is doing far more for
it rpo lldtng than for hlmeelt I co
erces from him a contract that Its own
judges as between citlz3n and citizen
would hold void as flagrantly unjast and
against pu lc policy It holds out to
him illusory hopes and promises which
deceive and when he is no longer able
to meet Its hard txictlons by the stroke
cf a pen the result of a lit3time ot labor
are forfeited to the state under a decree
more arbitrary and cruel than could be
pronounced in any other civilized coun
try
It it were so disposed The Gazette
could go Into older cocntles than those
cf the Panhandle for proof of tha obstruc
tions which the Texas school land policy
has thrown In the path ct westerndevel
opment It might point to th SnsWled
condition cf sectlono that ravebeen n

in which healthy development is pric I
cally Impossible
The Twentyfirst legislature ha3 it
within its power to retrieve the west and
the public lmdcd Interests from a Litna
tion which is not only a public
disgrace bul a public disaster
If such an end is reached during
Governor Hiss administration history
will write that down as the beginning cf
a new epoch in the development cf the
state an epoch of growth and prosperity
beside which tha achievements of the
past will appear insignificant i
