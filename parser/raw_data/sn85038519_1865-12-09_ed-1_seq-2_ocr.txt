proffers, and to reject "all sacrifices on tlio
part of thi Southern States, is shared by all
that school of public men called radicals,
whether they be in the South or North, and
and wc think wc do not use too strong lan
guage when wc characterize it as a base and
unworthy spirit, whatever the incentive
which prompts its indulgence.
AVe have yet to Bee or hear urged, cne
valid reason against tho rcadtnission of the
Southern States to their former and rightful
status in the Union. "We havo neither time
nor purpose now to elaborate the many co
gent reasons, which, from the outlook of
enlarged patriotism, arc presented in its
favor. We have heard much twattling
about their failure to recognize tho
rights of man which means simply
that they have not advanced to the
puritan standard of ideas about the negro
race, and that they cannot admit, with their
superior knowledge of the subject, that a col
ored freeclman, recently emancipated from a
slavery, which according to these same per
fectionists, was the most degrading and bru
tifying ever tolerated, is immediately fit for
tho high duties of an American citizen. But
even those who sincerely entertain this fan
tastic opinion, have no right to make it the
ground of excluding millions of white peo
ple who do not hold it, from the privilege
of full participation in the government. "W'c
have heard much too of a necessary period
of probation that disloyalty so flagrant as
that shown by the Southern people, requires
time to be 'purged away that it would bo
unsafe to admit men, recently so forgetful of
their duties, into Uio councils of the nation
and one zealous advocate of the exclusion
8ystem,tlieC1iicago7ZjKWcan,has even gone
so far as to assert, that a "miraculous change"
should first overcome the entire mass of
the Southern people a something per
haps, which human agency alone could no
efiect a baptism from on high witli the
waters of unalloyed loyalty a complete
political regeneration and new birth. "With
such impracticable nonsense wc have not tho
patience to deal courteously. It is beneath
the dignity of serious refutation. "We have
heard also, of States having forfeited their
statehood that they could not secede, but
n the attempt, they could and did commit
suicide, and that they have fallen into a ter
ritorial condition, there to remain, until it
shall Buit the sovereign pleasure of congres
sional condilora impcriorum, to reconstruct
them. Hut the President in his recent mes
sage, argiiM at length the indestructibility
of States, and tho proposition is so clear,
that nono but a purblind fanatic can fail to
admit its truth. These and other sophistnsand
fooleries, equally vapory, we havo heard, but
not one substantial reason for longer delay
ing the complete restoration of tho Union in
all its parts and functions, and giving that
quiet to the public mind on these questions,
which it so much needs. Every mouth, nay
every week, that this desirable consumma
tion is deferred, is fraught with peril not
the peril indeed, of another revolution, but
one which will surely infect republican
liberty, if it docs not entirely transform the
character of the govenimcnt. Upon this
subject the President also speaks wisely.
Closely examined it will be found that the
opj03ition to the rcstomtion of the Southern
States to their due and equal position in the
function of law making, is born of and
based in that fanatical anti-slavery agitation,
which, for years before the conflict of arms,
was so baneful to the peace of the country.
And it is propagated by the same men, and
the numerous retainers whom the hope of po
litical and pecuniary profit by the war, have
added to their train. All the various theo
ries of reconstrution so-called arc the out
growth of this sentiment a sentiment which
lias become infuriated by its constant appeal
to passions, and corrupt, because it has been
compelled to resort to every kind of means
to sustain itself. And yet the exponents of
this sentiment arc ever pratingof republican
ism, and the Declaration of Independence,
while they are subjecting nearly one half of
the people of the republic to the operation
of the executive and judicial functions of
tho government, and denying them all voice
in the grcuul essential republican right of
making thcTaws. It is this sort of absurdity
and injustice which seeks to substitute itself
for the wise and healing measures of an en
larged statesmanship.
In the interest, especially of the people for
whom we speak, and for the good of the
whole country, wo protest against the
longer prevalence of this spirit, in what
ever form it manifests itself. "Wc entreat
the people of the dominant party North to
discard it, and adopt tho conciliatory sug
gestions of tho President. lie is anx
ious, as are the people of whom he is ono,
that the gates of strife and discord in re
gard to this question, shall bo forever elocd.
lie tells them that the great achievement
the emancipation of slaves is enough for
the prevent; anil that man mut bo pisocd
of a devil of hate and kindred passions, who
does not see that all social and industrial
problems, and race relationships will best
settle themselves, without the interference of
government, when its jiolicy is to be dicta
ted by an officious philanthrophy whicli
neither knows its business, nor how to do it.
Let them reform it altogether, and as they
arc victors, let them exhibit that wisdom
which makes victory complete, and crowns
its work.

Tin: KAmcAi. i'uoijuammi:.
PitKsiDKNT Johnson, preparatory to the
meeting of Congress, perfected a plan for
the full and complete restoration of the
Southern States to their proper relations un
der the general govenimcnt. As individ
uals, we were required to conform to the
terms cf his proclamation of amnesty of the
U9th of May last. As States, wo were re
quired to amend our organic law, repealing
tho ordinance of secession, abolishing slave
ry and repudiating all debts growing out of
the "so-called" rebellion. "We were also
required to adopt the amendment to the
Federal Constitution, proposed by Congress,
to the effect that slavery or involuntary ser
vitude, should never exist again in any part
of these States.
Practically all these requirements have
lecn complied with. The Southern States
havo elected their Senators and Uepresen
tatives to Congress, and President Johnson,
through his message, has brought them to
the doors of tho two houses' and has there
left them with this simple declaration: "Here
it is for you, fellow-citizens of the Senate,
and for you, fellow citizens of the House of
Representatives, to judge, each of you for
yourselves, of the elections, r.nrvuN.s and
qualifications of your own members,"
which is in accordance with the power given
them by the 5th Sec or the 1st Art. of the
Constitution.
Hut the Kadicxk are not disposed to re
ceive and consider the subject in tho form
presented them by the President. They are
not willing to be restricted by President
Johnson and the Constitution to the mere
consideration of the " elections, returns and
qualifications " of those Southern members.
In fact they have but little or no concern
about this phase of the question. The reso
lution agreed upon in their caucus, and
subsequently adopted in the House, and
which will bo found in the first
day's proceeding published in another
column of this paper, provides for a joint
committee of the two Houses, "who shall
enquire into " not the elections, returns and
qualifications of the Southern members but
'tht conditionot tho States which formed tho
6b-called Confederate States of America, and
report whether they or any of them are enti
tled to be represented in cither House of Con
gress." In the meantime " nojncmber shall
be received into either House from any of
the so-called Confederate States, and all pa
pers relating to the representatives of said
States shall be referred to said Committee
tviihovt del-ate."
What could lw more lcvolutionary than
such action as this? "Where can they find
the shadow of authority for a dominant ma
jority to seize the reins of government and
sit in judgment upon what Spates are, and
what arc not "entitled to be represented in
the Congress" of a government of whicli, ac
cording to their own theory, as well as our
present concessions, all are equally memltcrs?
As citizens of States within tho Union wc
have been held ameinable to Federal laws.
As offenders againtt that Union, in our in
dividual capacity, wc have been held to ac
count, and required to so alter our State
Constitutions a3 to remove all difficulties
to future harmony. As part and parcel of
that Union we arc required to pay tares and
perform all other duties to tho government
in the fame manner that tho States of
the North are required. It is not pretended
by this Congress that we are 'out of the
the palcf the Union. It is not admitted
tliat we have ever been. It is not pretended
that we arc any thing less than States.
"When and where then, wc ask, hxs there
been a bolder, a more flagrant, a more defi
ant usurpation of power? "Where an act
more revolutionary in its character?
The withdrawal of the Southern Stales,
even in the light of those who view it from
a Northern stand-point, was not so gross a
usurpation of jwwer; since in the one in
stance the act was based uion theories long in
dispute; whilst in the other it is but an
open usurpation, in direct conflict with their
own theory, and with nothing to support it
but the naked might of a tyrannical ma
jority, mocking and buffeting a disarmed
and powerless minority.
Supposing all that is charged against the
action of the Southern States in seeking to
separate from the Federal government be
true; tmc, that they acted without warrant
in the Constitution; true, that they sought
to dissolve the Union. And suppose that it
was a crime. Does that justify the very
States who opposed it and who put it down,
in turning around and committing a greater
crime? Are we to have no Constitution in
future because, perchance, one section, in the
opinion of the other section, went counter to
that instrument in their desire to have a
separate government?
The Southern people are tired of strife.
They want peace, and if they cannot have
the old government restored they would wel
come any fort of government that their rul
ers may choose to give them, so that it is
definite and tangible, in preference to the
mere loo?e, unbridled whims and p:ssions of
a cold, selfish, cruel and tyranical party.
"Wc cannot believe that the President with
his antecedents, his sense of justice, his
avowed determination to uphold the Consti
tution, the rights of the States and the rights
ot the citizen .under them, can fail to be
aroused" to the importance of tho crisis, and
the necessity for a bold effort to protect the
govenimcnt against a conspiracy more trca
sanablo to free institutions in America than
the revolutionary effort of the Southern States
to secure "a separate nationality.
Tin: pitraiiiiarr axi tiii: kaiicai.1
It is evident that tho people of the South,
and the more conservative portion of the
North, are troubled with the apprehension
that the President may compromise too far
with the imperious demands of the blind
and reckless majority whicli, unluckily, com
pose the present Congress. "Wc acknowledge
that wc aro more hopeful. No one not
even the bitterest enemy of the President
ever questioned his sagacity. Having con
fidence in his purpose to adhere to the policy
he has laid down for his administration, wc
cannot, therefore, suppose that lie will dally
with the avowed enemies of that policy, fur
ther than is necessary to get the advantage
of position.
The New York Herald, its editors and cor
respondents, are generally unreliable. The
following, however, from its "Washington cor
respondent, we believe correctly typifies the
condition of affairs and tho feeling of the
President relative to the South :
thi: Hipncur.Tira of Tim fiubidisnt's
position.
It is vcrv evident that tho recent despatch
es of the President to his Provisional Oov
ernors in the South arc misunderstood.
Those despatches are not to be interpreted
as indicating a want of confidence in the
Southern people ; nor arc they prompted by
a feeling that the South lias not manifested
the right spirit. On the contrary, the Pres
ident has full confidence that the right
spirit exists ; but he lias seen the extreme
tendency of some portions of Congress, and
lie is desirous that the South shall put itself
in'a position that will materially assist him'
in the North, while combatting with the ex
treme measures of the radicals. This is the
true interpretation of the despatches asking
the Southern people to pursue a certain
course in their conventions and Legislatures.
The strength of the Piesidcnt and the result
of the contest, if there is a contest Wtween
him and the radicals in Congress, depend in
a great measure upon the tone of the South
ern people If the latter manifest a dispo
sition to bo dictatorial or exhibit braggado
cio, they will render it imjos.siblc for the
President to carry through his reconstruc
tion policy and will strengthen the
extreme men of the party. It is
admitted by everybody that everything
looked . favorable for the admission of
the Ixmisiana delegation last year up to the
time that a member of that delegation, ask
ing admission, assaulted Mr. Kelly, from
Philadelphia, and that that act alone set
tled their petition for admission adversely.
This is apropos to the jxiiut. Mr. Johnson's
jHiwcr in Congress depends upon the tone of
the South. If he can stand by his present
jiolicy and retain the confidence of the jjreat
bulk "of the Southern people, there is no
doubt of the final result before Congress.
Hut if the tone of the South, and the dispo
sition manifested by the public men there,
is such that the President, in order to stand
by anil protect them against extreme meas
ures of the radical faction in Congress, is
obliged to cut loose from his Northern base,
he at once becomes Tylerixed and is jower
less to aid the South in readjusting that sec
tion. It is therefore important that the
bWnl
disposition that will cnatitc tnc rrcsiucnt to
endorse tlieir course without outraging the
real Union sentiment at the North. This
is an important jHiint. This is the true ex
planation of the dtsqiatches of the Provis
ional Governors indicating that their posi
tion would be strengthened by adopting
such and such measures. It is not because
he is disgusted or dissatisfied with them, but
it is the movement of a general who selects
liis position to meet the enemy and fortifies
it, making it as impregnable as possible be
fore the battle commences.
It will bo seen from this view that the re
sult of this contest with the radicals will
depend upon contingcnccis which may arise
from time to time If they sail out in a bold
course and attack the- President, as marked
out at the caucus of yesterday, the lattter has
the wenjton and the materials to carry his
point. Ilut suppose, for instance, that some
of the Southern representatives in the midst
of the struggle put on imperious airs and
commence to make threats, or bluster about,
the tables will be turned and the radicals
will lie successful. There is a strong indi
cation that the extreme men of Congress will
take even- possible step to goad Southern
reprosenta'tivfts on to th9t very point, know
ing that it will result in the postponement of
reorganization. Keep your temper is there
fore the lK3st instniction that can be given
to representatives from the South.
The public must also make up tlieir mind
that evurv expression in the Legislature and
Conventions in the Southern States against
the iolicv of the North, the negroes or any
thing of that nature will be magnified and
as much mado out of it as passible. These
arc all the contingencies, and it maybe from
Southern people, m their conventions. Lo
1 the annlications of members
r.ir nilniisiinn to Coneross. should exhi
this consideration of these facts that the
President has concluded to tone down his
message and present it in a more modified
form, which lias caused the impression that
generally- prevails to-day that he will be in
harmony with the party in Congress Which
elected him.
THK LIFE OF Hit. KAXK.
This is one of the oddest books printed in
a long while. It is the publication of a wife,
(socalled, as Bill Arp would say) of the love
letters received by her during a long court
ship. The delicacy of the book may be
questioned, but its interest cannot. The rea
sons for thus spreading before the public eye
these sacred mementoes, is thus told :
"The Lite Dr. Kane, the celebrated Arctic ex
plorer, left behind him, when he died, something
besides Ms valuable book t attract public atten
tion. He bad secretly effected, it appears, what
his rather haucbty family in Philadelphia consi
dered a ni'Kttliaure with a JIis.s Fox, of whom be
was cnamcrcil. anil between this lady, ns his wi
dow, ami Dr. Kane's mother and brother, littio
but litigation and bad feeling has subsisted since
the great explorer's decease. It seems that ho was
for several years engaged to .Mis JIargaretta Fox,
ono of the young Indies of spirit wrapping cele
brity, with whom ho fell in love while she was ex
hibiting as a medium in Philadelphia,, she being
then only fifteen years old. With tho concnt of
her mother. Dr. Kane removed her from nil asso
ciation with spiritualists, and placed her in a pri
vate school near Pliilbdelphia, to remain during
his absence in the Arctic regions. On his return
in 1So5, they were to have been married ; but the
opposition of Dr. Kane's family wa3 such that
Miss Fox released him from his engagement. Ho
loved her, however, too well to live without her;
and in April. 18.V3, tho engagement w.13 renewed,
with the understanding that it should be kept to
crct till the publication of Dr. Kane's great work
should rcaliic an independence for him. In Octo
ber. 1K0, his physician having ordered Dr. Kane
to England, ho was secretly lDnrricd to Miss Fox,
and made his will, leaving five thousand dollars
to her in a private trust to his brother. His last
letter was addressed to her. This legacy was not
paid, and injurious, reports being raised, Mrs.
Kane sued for dower as the widow, and prepared
a memoir embodying lit of Dr. Kane's letters.
The Doctor's family interposed to prevent tho pub
lication of the memoir and letters, and agreed to
pay the lady the interest of the money left her,
and a sum down to repay her expenses: but they
baving failed to keep the agreement, the publica
tion is now made in order to vindicate the charac
ter of the lady."

sentation in Congress.
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
Mr. Sumner introduced a concurrent resolution
declaratory of tho adoption of the Constitutional
Amendment abolishing Slavery,
Mr. Brooks said the gentloman from Pennsylva
nia understood the purport of the ancient maxim,
that language was given to us to conceal our ideas.
The proper timo to which the gentleman alluded
was in anticipation of the Message, in order that
the gentleman might throw himself in opposition
to it, to place before the conntry a quasi condem
nation oi the President. He (llrooks) was not the
President's vindicator, except, where tho recoid
should be presented on principles in accordance
withhisonn. -He moved that tho gentleman from
Tennessee be allowed to present his credentials as
n member elect from the Stale of Tennessee, and
that his name be placed upun the roll.
A 1-OlXT OK ORDER.
Mr. Stevens I rise to the point of order that tho
motifiu is inadmissablc. tho motion for the election
of Speaker now being in order.
The Clerk ruled that was n good point of order.
Mr. Majnard I appeal to the gentleman to lis
ten to mo for a fw minutes.
Mr. Stevens I cannot yield to any gentleman
who is not a member of this body.
Mr. Johnson (Pa.) obtained tho floor, for the
purHsc, as he said, of explaining, but
Mr. Stevens objected, remarking. "A man can
not explain anything never spoken."
The Clerk reminded Mr. Brooks that ho could
not yield the floor if objection was made, nor could
ho yield it excepting for the purposes of explana
tion or detxitc on pending amendments.
Mr. Brooks replied that he did not regard the
proceedings as parliamentary, and expressed his
regret that such a dangerous precedent was about
to be established.
Mr. Johnson 'Pa.) wished to propound a ques
tion. It related to making up ttic roll, which was
the first step to organisation.
The Clerk held that that had no;rcferencc to
the elect ion of Speaker, which was the pending
inutioD.
THE rtlVlOUS QUESTION".
Mr. Stevens raovtd the previous question. On
the motion lo proceed to the election of Speaker
Mr. Jobnton proposed to submit a motion which
could tako nrcrdencc of the motion of his col
leaguefMrsteevcnsi. llifwished to move lliattle
name of the gentleman from TCSmesseo, who holds
the credentials, be placed upon the roll.
The Clerk decided the motion out of crdsr.
The House, under the operation of the previous
Question, agreed to the question of Mr. Morri'l,
that the House now proetod to the election of
speaker.
ELECTION FOE SrCACEB.
Mr. Morrill nominated Schuyler Colfax of In

the speaker's address.
Gentlemen of the House of'IIepresentatives:
The reassembling of Congress, marking as it docs
the procession of our National history, is always
regarded with interest by the people for whom it
is to legislate. . But it is not unsafo to say that
millions moro than ever before, Xorth, South,
East and West, aro locking to the Congress which
opens its first session to-day with an earnestness
and solicitude uncmialed on similar occasions in
tho past. Tho XXXVIIIth Congress closed its
constitutional existence with the storm-cloud of
war still lowering over us; and, after a nine
month's absence. Congress rcsnines its legislative
authority in these council-halls, rejoicing that
from shore to shore in our land there is pcaco. Its
duties are as obvious as tho sun's pathway in the
heavens. Itcprescnting in its two branches the
States and the People, its first and higher obliga
tion is to guarantee to every Stato n Kepublicaii
form nf government, Tho ltebellion having over
thrown tho constitutional State Governments in
miny State-, it is jotirj to maturcfri d cna:t legi- -lation
which, with the concurrence ot such a las s
of enduring justice as will guarantee all ncrtasary
safeguards to tho people, and to afford what our
magna charta. the Declaration cf Independence,
proclaims is tho chief objeci of Government, pro
tection to all men in their unalienable rights.
Applause. Tho world should witness in this
great work the most inflexible, fidelity, tho "most
earnest devotion to tho principles of libtwiy
and humanity, the truest patriotism, and
tho wisest statesmanship. Men by tho hundreds
of thousands havo died that the Itcpublic might
live. Tho emblems of mourning havo darkened
tho White House and the cabin alike. But tho
fire? of civil war havo melted every fetter in the
land and proved tho funeral pyre of Slavery. It
is for you representatives to do your work as
faithfully nnd as well as did tho fearless saviors of
the Union on their more dangerous arenas of duty.
Then we may hope to seo the vacant and once
abandoned scats nround U3 gradually filling up,
until this Hall shall contain Representatives from
everr State and district, their hearts devoted to
be Union for which they aro to legislate, jealous
of its honor, proud of its glory, watchful of its
rights and hostile to its enemies: and tlio stars on
our banner that paled when the States they repre
sented arrayed themselves in arm? against the na
tion, will shine with a more brilliant light of
loyalty thao over before. Applause. Invoking
the guidance of Him who holds the destiny of na
tions in tho hollow of His hand, I enter again
upon the duties of this trying position, with a
heart filled with gratitude to yon for the unusual
ly flattering mannerin which it has been bestowed,
and cheered by the hopo that it betokens your
cordial support and assistance in all its grave re
sponsibilities. I am now ready to take the oath
of office prescribed by law.
THE OATH ADMINISTERED.
Mr. Washburne (111.) tho oldest consecutive
member of the House, then administered the oath
of otiicc to tho Speaker, and tho latter then ad

Objections coining from"thc Democratic side,
Mr. Wilson moved a suspension of tho rules.
Mr. l'andall'd'cnn.) desired to say somo on his
side wished to vote for candidates not named in
that resolution. He therefore asked leave to offer
another list.
.Mr. Wilson declined to yield the floor. ,
Mr. llnndall unsuccessfully moved thai tho res
olution lio upon the tablo when the question hav
ing been taken tho resolution was agreed to by a
vote of 133 Yeas against So Nays.

"To Hon. William H. Si:vAnn: The Amend
ment is adopted by an overwhelming vote. I will
send you an authenticated copy at an early day.
Please seo that Alabama is announced as tho

Applause followed tho reading of this dispatch.

Mr. Stevens offered tho following joint resolu
tion. JUfoleed, (by tho Senate and Douse of Repre
sentatives in Congress assomblcd). That a joint
committee of fifteen shall bo appointed, nine of

and all papers relating to tho representatives of

Mr. Udndgc ( is.) objected to tho introduction

Mr. Stephens moved a suspension of the rules;

tive bv li?J nirainst iV.
Mr, Dawson inked for a postponement of tho

CITIZENS OF LATELY ItLllELI.IOUS STATES.
Mr. Sumner introduced n series of resolutions
dcclartory of the duty of Congress, especially in
iv.pi'ui iu tuc luyat ciuzcua u. ihu cluics laieij iu
rebellion.
CONDITIONS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTED.
Mr. Sumner introduced the following:
J totted. That in order to provide proper guar
antees for security in tho future, so that peace and
prosperity shall surely prevail and tho plighted
faith of the nation shall bo preserved, it is the full
duty of Congress to tako caro that no Stato de
clared to be in rebellion Shalt Allowed to resume,
its relation to tlio Union until after the satisfacto
ry performance of fivo several conditions, which
conditions precedent must bo submitted to a pop
ular voto and bj sanctioned, by a majority ot tho
people of each Stato resnoctivelv. a3 lollows :
Tho complete rc-cstablihmcnt of loyalty as
stiown by an lionost recognition ot t lie unity o! the
Republic, and tho- duty .of allegiance to it at all
times tvithout mental reservation or equivocation
of any kind.
The coinplcto suppression of all oligarchical pre
tentions, and tho complete enfranchisement of all
citizens, so (hat there shall be no denial of rights
on account of color or race, but justico shall bo

lho rejection of tho Rebel debt. and nt thesamo
time tno adoption in jh.h proportion oi tno Na

The choice of citizens for office, whether Stato

Jlmnltnlj That, ill order to pruvido these es

TENNESSEE.
When the State of Tennessee was reached, Mr.
Maynnrdcf that State, holding in his hand a pa
ner. ila.irr.1 to make a remark, but the Clerk ob
jected, saying there could be no interruption of
me can.
.Mr. Maynard Docs the Clerk decline?
The Clerk I do.
The calling of tho roll of members having been
completed. Mr. Maynard again rose, but was over
ruled by tho Clerk.
It was then announced that 173 members had
answered lo their names.
Mr. Morrill moved that tho House now rroeecd
to the election of a Speaker.
Mr. Maynard, beforo that was dono wished to
say a few words.
Mr. Stephens called him to order.
I ITho Clerk informed Mr. Maynard thailho eeuld
not recocmixc any gentleman whoso Lame wai not
on the roll.
Brtr.ra or he. bbooss.
Mr. Brooks of New York hoped the motion
would net prevail until It was settled who were
members of thi House, and whether tho gentle
man from Tenncsc-e w ho held his credentials in
his hand, was entitled to be heard. He traded the
House would not proceed in any rerolutiunary
step like tilts without bearing from Ten nwee; for
if Tnnntsceiscot in tne Union and is notalnial
State, but her eitiiens aie aliens and foreign!, by
what right Joes the President of the United States
occupy his place in tbe bite House 7 lie repeated
he trusted the gentleman would have tbe privilege
to be hoard; fur if the precedent now propose i bs
ettablishcd, the Clerk would, in cflect, rive law to
the Houseroerdy by arbitrary wili.and thus make
himself omnipotent
Mr. Wcntworth called tbegrntlemau to order.
ThoClcrksaidtbc. gentleman was proceeding in
order.
Mr. Brooks responded; When tho gcntlemaa
knows ise better in the Uotuo, he will always ud
hat I proceed to order. We ought tQ, know who
have a right to vote before wo proceed' with the" or
ganization. IT the gentleman (Mr. Maynard) is
notfrom a Stato in the Union, what man is loyal?
During the darkest period of the war, wnilo he was
an exile from Tennessee, I heard his eloquent
voice on the St. Lawrence urging my State to dis
charge its whole duty to thocountry ; and here aro
honorablo gentlemen who will not permit him to
bo heard though ho holds in his hnnd a ccrtificato
from the Oovcrnorof Tennessee. Neither has tho
Clerk of tho House read the names of raembeig
from Virginia I mean Old and not Western Vir
giniaover whit h Gov. Pierpont has presided and
still prc-idgs, to which csition he was elected dur
ing the war, and whose loyalty is unquestioned. By
what right has the Virginia delegation beentx
cludcd? I want the Clerk to tell me. Hcha-sgiven
no reason for it. I will yield the floor to enable
him to answer the question.
Tho Clerk replied: "If it is tho desire of tho
House, 1 will give the reasons.
Mr. Stevens, in his chair The Ilortsc knows it
all. and don't want the reasons.
Tho Clerk said what ho had dono was in view
of his duty, and he was willing to let the record
stand.
Mr. Brooks, resuming, said it was known to
some, but not to all, that the State of Louisiana
was here last Congress by permission of tho gen
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stevens), who
gave his assent lo the ccrord; but now Louisiana
is excluded. The Republicans then admitted two
members from Louisiana, and now tho Clerk as
sumed the responsibility of excluding the mem
bers elect from that State. Whv this inconsistency
of action, as well as absurdity?
DEBATE ON THE ADMISSION OF SOUTHERN MEM
BERS. Mr. Washburn (111. reminded tho Houso that,
on the occasion to which tho gentleman referred,
the Clerk put tho names of tho two Louisiana
members on the roll. They did not voto' for
Speaker, and the House some timo after refused
to let them bo sworn in. '
Mr. Brooks That was after tho Speaker was
chosen.
Mr. Washburne They were never members.
Mr. Brooks But they gave their votes for
Speaker without objection from tho Republicans.
But tho gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Stcv
cns.) did not want to hear tho reasons of tho clerk.
This was not parliamentary. Tennessee, Louis
iana and Virginia were all to be excluded without
debate. Were gentlemen afraid to face debate,
after passing a resolution in caucus excluding
members from certain seats without discussion?
Mr. Stevens I rise to a point of order. It was
once held that on tho assembling of members, on
the first day of tho session, no other business was
in order except a motion to organize by the elec
tion of officers.
-Mr. Brooks I trust tho gentleman will not be
impatient. I would say to him, strike, but first
hear. The action of the clerk is to be carried on
without debate. In the whole history of the
country, and throughout the revolutionary period,
there is no record of violence more flagrant than
that which is proposed to bo visited on the minor
ity of the Houso by tho exclusion of 57 Represen
tatives, and that, too, without debate. I would
ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania at what pe
riod be will introduce the joint resolution which
was approved in the Republican caucus? I hope
he will inform us.
Voices Don't tell. Don't answer him.
Mr. Stevens Oh I I havo no objection to an
swering. It will bo introduced by me atthoprop
cr time. Laughter and applause.
The Speaker said tho motion would be in order
if the previous question has not been demanded.
Mr. Dawson moved that the resolution belaid on
the table, which was decided in the negative.
Tho House then passed the joint resolution by the
following vote ; ca?, 123 ; nays, SO.
BILLS NOTICED.
Mr. Washburno (111.) gave notice of n bill to
rovivo tho grade of General in the Unitcd'Statcs
army.
Mr. Orthgavo notice of abill to amend the Con
Stitution so as to apportion Representnlivrs in
Congress occording to tho number of legal voters

RIGHT OF SUFFRAOE IN THE DISTRICT.
Mr. Kclley (Pa.) gave notice of bis intention In
introduce the following bill to extend tho right of
suuragu iu iiici'isiriciui uoiumuta;
lie it enattalj ifc, That from all laws and parts
of laws prescribing the qualifications of electors

and that from and after Hie passage of this act, no
person shall bo disoualified from vnlimr nt nnv

color.
SECTION 2. And he it further enacted. That all
acts of Congress and all laws of tbeSt.nln of Mnrv-
land in force in said District, and nil ordinances of
the Cities ol W asliington and Georgetown, incon
sistent with the provisions of this act, arc hereby

ADMISSION TO THE nOUSE.
Mr. Xiblack asked leave tn offer n resolution
that, pending tho consideration of tbn siiltiret ilm

Pending the resolution the House adjourned.

"Washington, Dec 5. A Republican Sen
atorial caucus was held to-tlay, when a com
mittee wxs appointed to arrange the stand
inp; committees of the Senate. There will
be but few changes and none in the chair
manship of the leading committees. There
was an informal meeting to-day of several
conservative Republican Senators for the
purpose of considering the House resolution
appointing a joint committee of the two
Houses, to whom all matters relating to the
admission of the Representatives from th'c
boutli should be reicrretl. That resolution,
they say, will be strongly opposed and will
notpass without material modnication.
These Senators will oppose it on the ground
that it puts the Senate m minority bv allow
ing them only six members, while the House
tuts nine, thus placing them entirely in the
power oi tne House, llicro were only
twcnty-thi'ce Representatives from the South
who presented tlieir credentials to the Clerk.
Tennessee sevciij Virginia seven, North Car
olina live, Mississippi three aud Louisiana
one. None of the other States have pre-
il.: . !... . i . i i
Miura tueir credential anil it is not llKeiy
that they will when they learn the action to
day of the Republicans in Congress.
The Louisiana delegation called upon the
President to-day, and had .i very interesting-
interview, a he President informed them
that lie had done all in his power to bring
Louisiana within proper relations with the
federal uovcrnment, but that the admission
of the Representatives from that State was a
question lor Congress alone to decide.
Special to tho Tribiine.1
Washington, Dec. 5. The question will
now come, whether the Representatives who
can take the test oath, from States that have
been in rebellion, anil whicli are recognized
by tho Executive Department of the Govern
ment, as States having legitimate civil gov
ernments, shall he admitted to seats; and
upon tins we apprehend there will be a
division of opinion among those who tints
far count themselves supporters of the Ad
ministration.
