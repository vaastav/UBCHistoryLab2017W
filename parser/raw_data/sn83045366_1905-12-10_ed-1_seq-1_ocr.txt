STATE INSURANCE
CHIEFS COUNCIL
O'Brien of Minnesota With
Party of Commissioners
at White House.
Conference Decides to Sup
port President's Plan of
Federal Control.
Law First, Then the Court's
Opinion as to the Con
stitution.
Trouble Over Cortelyou's
Policy as to Appointment
of Postmasters.
John Goodnow Living
Fine Style in Shanghai
Mansion.
The conference lasted for half an
hour, but it was not productive of defi
nite results. The president and his vis
itors felt that it was desirable for the
government to take control of insur
ance, and the insurance commissioners
from the south were as strongly of this
opinon as those from"" states farther
north. Nobody, however, was in posi
tion to say what the supreme tourt
would hold as to the constitutionality
of such a law.
It was finally agreed, however, that
the thing to do was to push for legisla
tion, and leave to the courts the decis
ion of the constitutional question.
This will be done. The president will
"stand pat" on his message recom
mendation, and the insurance commis
sioners who were here promised him
that sentiment in their respective
states would indorse him.
Clash With Cortelyou.
I
Dissatisfaction with the postmaster
general's policy relative to presidential
postmasters has become so great among
some of the republican members of the
house that they have taken to diseuss
.ing it to the exclusion of matters of
legislation.
A member of the Minnesota delega
tion, who is outside the controversy be
cause he has his own postmasters in
office and is willing they shall stay
there, but who has kept touch with
the situation, said today:
"When you see three or four or a
half dozen republican members of con
gress in earnest confab these days, they
are not discussing rate legislation, nor
the Panama canal, nor international
peace, but the postmaster general's or
der. I went to two hotels last night
and found such groups the lobbies.
"Now that it is known that Mr.
Cortelyou, backed by the president,
meant what he said when he promul
gated the new rule, sentiment in regard
to the department's policy has been
crystallizing and a size-up of the situa
tion shows it to be about as follows:
Fifteen or twenty republican house
"nembers are well satisfied with the new
jolicy. As many as fifty have ex
messed a determination not to have
mything more to do with the postof
ice department, so far as recommend
ng men for appointment as postmasters
concerned. They will inform the de
partment that the filling of these posi-
10ns is' a purely executive function
nd that the department can go ahead
nd do as it pleases. Still another
iunch, the hot-heads, are advocating
he adoption of legislation providing
or the election of postmasters cities
'f 20,000 population or less.''
Minnesotans Interested.
In this connection it can be stated
hat six of the nine members of the
Minnesota delegation are vitally con
em ed in the new policy of the depart
lent. They are Volstead, Davis, Steen
rson, Bede and Buckman of the* new
"lembers, and Tawney of the older men,
'ho is said to want to make some
Ranges in his district. In the districts
*f the first five, which were rearranged
uder the |pst apportionment, there are
pvr many presidential postmasters who
*ere appointed by former congressman,
'ad some of whom were actively op-
""Ssed to the present members.
Under the new policy, these members
jin't put their own men into the post
fices, and they are more or less out-

ASHINGTON, Dec. 9.Insur-
ance Commissioner T. D.
O'Brien of Minnesota, ac
companied by Commissioners Host of
Wisconsin, Can oil of Iowa and the in
surance commissioners of Tennessee,
Mississippi, Kansas, Massachusett and
the District of Columbia, today called
on the president by previous appoint
ment and discussed with him the ques
tion of whether it would be possible
for congress, without violating the con
stitution, to pass a bill placing insur
ance under the federal government, in
accordance with the suggestions con
tained in the president's message to
congress.
ITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 9.When
Andrew Carnegie named Wil
liam E. Corey head of the Unit
ed States Steel corporation to succeed
Charles M. Schwab, he is alleged to
have said: "There is a man whose
head never can be turned by a woman.''
That the prediction of the Laird of
Skibo failed of fulfilment is proved by
Corey's infatuation for an actress.
At Chicago, in saloons, in society
everywherethe sensation is the all
absorbing topic, and while some are un
charitable enough to call it scandal, all
admit that it furnishes food for gossip.
In Pittsburg, as well as in his old
home at Braddock, the feeling against
him over his alleged ill-treatment of
"Laura," as most of the people in the
valley know Mrs. W. Ellis Corey, is
very bitter.
Uncle Gave Him a Start.
Twenty years ago a slim youth walked
into the office of J.-B. Corey in Brad
dock and said: "Uncle, give me a
job."
"All right, Ellis I'll put you to work
and if you stick by me I'll make a
man out of you. Report here tomorrow
morning.''
The next morning W. Ellis Corey re
ported at the office of his uncle and
was put to work on his coal tipple,
dumping cars. There was a series of
protests, but they were unheeded by
the old man, who had worked his way
up from a Mississippi coalboat pilot to
that of a millionaire and who had toiled
side by side with John D. Rockefeller.
If Ellis, his favorite nephew, wanted
to make his way in life, he must begin
at the bottom out here, roughing it with
the rest of the beys* EHie would get
$40 a month and must wait till pay day
for his money, the same as the rest of
the men.'
Young Corey's Work.
Young Corey remained at work for a
time. His duties were to push loaded
cars as they came from the mine to the
tipple on to a sort of a cage, lock them
there, press some sort of a lever, which
would tip the cars and shoot the coal
into cars below tnru a chute. It was
the worst kind of dusty and grimy
work.
It was not long until young Corey
found an outlet. There had been a long
standing feud between his uncle and
Captain Johns, who was superintendent
of the Braddock mills. Captain Johns
had been asked by J. B. Corey to close
his mills on Sunday, but he had indig
nantly refused. Seeing young Corey
one day covered with grime, he said:
"It's a shame for the old man to treat
you so. Come over to the mill office
and I'll give you a job that will be in
keeping with your ability. I'll put you
to work in the laboratory and make a
chemist of you."
To the Steel Mills.
Without so much as a word of fare
well, Corey passed from the coal tipple
to the laboratory of the Braddock Steel

Special to The Journal.
Chicago, Dec. 9.Thirty million
dozen eggs360,000,000 eggsin one
million cases are awaiting consumption
in Chicago's coldstorage houses. Thirty
million pounds of butter in 50,000 tubs
are also locked up in the coldstorage
vaults, ready to be spread on Chicago's
bread whenever she is hungry. These
enormous quantities of dairy products
put by in her commercial larder are the
greatest in Chicago's history, and set
a mark that overtops that of any prev
ious year.
While New York is complaining
about the high prices of first-class eggs
and eastern dealers are tearing .their
hair in frantic manner because the Sen
has gone on a strike, with a shortage
in the supply of the high-grade article,
Chicago "dealers are assured there will
be no shortage of the best eggs here all
winter.
New York is paying frgm 35 to 88
cents a dozett-retail for the best eggs,
while Chicago is giving from 28 to 35
cents for the same article.
Dealers on South Water street say
the western hens will lay enough eggs
to keep Chicago supplied with good,
fresh eggs nearly all winter. The refrig
erator egg will be eaten only by the
man who pays for it and who knows
what he is getting.

LEVELAND, Dec. 9.Influenced
by the Rogers execution, a bill
to discontinue capital punishment
in Ohio will be introduced in the legis

of an eye for an eye" was- obsolete
and a relic of barbarism.
"The taking of a life by a state is
cold-blooded murder," he said, "and
sometimes worse than murder, for mur
der is often committed in a passion
when the assailant does not recognize
.the enormity of his action. The popu
lation in the state of Ohio ought to
take the .lead in setting a good example
in this matter. A life sentence in the
penitentiary is severe enough penalty
for any crime."

Washing-

Dec .The
ton correspondent of
wires follows:
Eben W. Martin of South Dakota has
introduced in the house a bill which
aims to give the government control of
every corporation in the country which
is engaged in interstate commerce, in
fuel or food supplies.
Two years ago Representative Martin
forced consideration of his resolution
asking for an investigation of the af
fairs of the beef industry. The resolu
tion passed the house and the beef in
quiry was on.
This new measure of the South Da
kota congressman provides that every
corporation, joint stoek company or
other association engaged in interstate
and foreign commerce in food supplies
shall first obtain from the Secretary of
commerce and labor a franchise per
mitting it to conduct business.
No Over-Capitalizing^
Before the company can be licensed,
it must prove that it is not over-capi
talized and that its Capital represents a
fair valuation of its rights and proper
ties, and it must be made plain that the
company is in no sense a trust, that it
is not its intention to enter in any com
bination or any conspiracy in restraint
of trade, and that there is no thought
of attempting to monopolize the partic
ular business in which it is to engage.
Pees for examination are to be
charged and a price is set on the license,
all moneys paid for the servfce and the
franchise to be put into a fund for the
promotion of the work of the bureau of
corporations of the department. Every
year, or oftener if the department de
mands it, the corporation is to make a
report sworn to by it* president, its
manager, its treasurer an&.a majority of
its board of directors, setting forth the
properties, the earnings, the profits, toe
dividends and lastly, tire business meth
ods.
To Keep Them in Check.
If* the corporation* does not come to
time with its report %p$$h date set, its
franchise is ter^efjsllp'ended until it

The measure provides that the re
sponsible officers of any corporation of
the kind specified in the title that shall
attempt to do business after July 1,
1906^ without the proper authority, or
in violation of the provisions of the act,
shall be fined not more than $5,000 or
imprisoned for a term not exceeding
one year, or suffer both penalties at the
discretion of the court.
If any corporation attempt to carry
on' interstate commerce in food or fuel
without a license any goods that it may
have in transit are to be seized and con
fiscated by the government.
Such are some of the provisions of
this measure introduced by Mr. Mar
tin of South Dakota and at the bill and
the man behind it the republican mem
bers of congress are looking fairly
aghast.
The bill has gone to the committee on
interstate and foreign commerce.

EW YORK, Den. 9.A move
ment is on foot among certain
trustees of the Mutual Life In
surance company to make W. H. Trues
dale president. This movement is said
to be due to the desire of the Rocke
feller-Ryan group of trustees to *shut
off the damaging disclosures as to the
conduct of the company. There is a
belief, it is declared, on the part of
those who urge Mr. Truesdale's elec
tion, that he would bring the house
safeaning" agitation to a speedy close
and thus check further deterioration
in the company's assets.
Mr. Truesdale, who is president of
the Lackaw,anna railroad and also
chairman of the committe,e-s-of trustees
investigating the Mutual s affairs, is
said not Ho hp in favor of so sweeping
an inquiry as are the other members
of that committee, John M. Auehin
eloss and Stuyvesant Pish.
No Chance for Peabody.
The opposition to Mr. Peabody has
apparently destroyed his prospects as
successor to Eichard A. McCurdy. The
Standard Oil clique may be balked,
however, as a result of a resolution in
troduced by Eloridge T. Gerry, at ves
terday's meeting of the Mutual trus
tees and adopted. The Gerry resolu
tion 'specifically declared that the
"house-cleaning" committee should
continue its business even after a per
manent president was selected.
Until that resolution was adopted,
soine of the trustees thought they
could get rid of all their troubles mere
ly by the election of a permanent pres
ident, and because the Truesdale-Fish
faction was in the minority there was
not much use in wasting time consult
ing their wishes.
Standard Oil Crowd.
The dominant faction, consisting of
tho friends of George F. liaker, of the
First National Bank, and Jlenry H.
Rogers, of the Standard Oil company,
was inclined to be a little impatient

not take kindly to their choice of

LIFE OF KRU5E
Friends Familiar With His
Operations Say "Lead
ings" Never Err,
He Says His Wealth Is Not
for Selfish
Uses.
URRENDERING himself to the
guidance of visions, "W. H. Kruse,
of 347 East Seventeenth street,
has made thousands of dollars in the
wheat market, has filled hundreds of
pages with written revelations and has
now capped the climax by discovering
what is reported to be an immensely
valuable gold mine in the Ozark mount
ains, Arkansas.
Such is the remarkable statement
by Mr. Kruse and vouched for by
friends familiar with his market opera
tions. The latter say that the wealth
which has come to him has not been
employed for seeking further gain nor
has the opportunity opened to him by
its possession been used for personal
aggrandizement. Instead, he regards
himself as merely the instrument thru
which divine agencies are Beeking to
do a great work. This is nothing less
than the establishment of a great com
munity that shall exemplify the prin
ciples of the new era of unselfishness
and common brotherhood which Mr.
Kruse believes is dawning.
Just how and when this great idea
is to be worked out, he does not as yet
know but he does know that none of
the income from sources revealed to
him is to be used by himself or by
others for selfish ends. A profound be
liever in the Bible, he is a simple, un
assuming man whose whole life is dom
inated by a power which, to him at
least, is not a bit mysterious. He talks
of his visions and what they have led
him to with an unassuming modesty
and conviction that Bhows they arc
realities to him, and those who have
known him long say his life is in strict
accord with the principles he holds.^and
the "leadings" he has r*ceiv%
Those long familiar with the peculiar
gifts of Mr. Kruse know that while he
has been a large operator in wheat he
has never sought to profit by .inducing
others to invest with him. His suc
cess has made them respect the source
of his information and they are not
disposed to class his visions as vaga
ries. Neither are they inclined to re
gard his operations with .suspicion, for.
he has no use for other people's money
and has nothing to sell. What he has,
has been given to him for a purpose to
which he is faithfully devoting it. To
all who know him he is a puzzle from
every viewpoint except that one which
accepts literally his own explanation,
First Fought the ViBions.
For many years Mr. Kruse has been
seeing the visions. It was not until
three years ago, however, that he sur
rendered himself to be led by them.
He had felt before this that to take
them seriously would be to sacrifice his
individuality and that he would cease
to be a free moral agent. He was en
gaged in the grain commission business.
Finally, however, came a vision and
a message which impressed him so
strongly that he decided to act as they
had indicated. Since that time he has

A Headless Revolution.
The most paralyzing feature of it all
is that there is no head to the revolu
tion. With some strong hand to take
the helm, Russia might weather the
storm without the reign of terror which,
it is felt must come.
But there is no controlling miadf
there is no man strong enough to com
mand obedience from all the millions
of people who are striving to obtain
that liberty of which they have had but
a taste, and to' obtain which they know
not how to proceed. "^jbL
Little wonder, then,, that the ques
tion, "Wherb is the revolution leading
Russia V* is on the lips of every
