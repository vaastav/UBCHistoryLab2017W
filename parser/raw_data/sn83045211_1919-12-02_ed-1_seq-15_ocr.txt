Washington, Dec. 2. President Wil
son today sent the following message to
Congress :
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives: I sirccrcly regret that T ennnot be
present at the opening of this ses
sion of the Congress. I am thus
prevented from presenting in as di
rect n way ns I could wish the many
questions that nre pressing for solu
tion at this time.
Happily, I have had the advantage
of the advice of the heads of the sev
eral executive departments who hnve
kept in c!.iso touch with affairs in
their detull and whose thoughtful
recommendations I earnestly second.
In the matter ot the railroads and
the readjustment of their nffairs
growing out of federal control, I shall
take the liberty at a later day of
addressing you.
Urges Budget System
I hope that Congress will bring to
a conclusion nt this fcession legisla
tion looking to the establishment of
a midget system. That there should
be one single nuthority responsible for
the making of all appropriations and
that appropriations thould be made
not independently of each other, but
with reference to one Mnglo compre
hensive plan of expenditure properly
related to the nation's income', there
can be no doubt.
I believe the burden ,of preparing
the budget must, in the nature of the
case, if the work is to be properly
done and responsibility concentrated
instead of divided, rest upon the ex
ecutive. . The budget t.o prepared should be
' submitted to and approved or amend
ed by n single committee of each
, House of Congress and no slugle ap
propriation should be made by the
Congress, except such us may have
been included iu the budget prepared
by the executive or added by the pnr
, ticular committee of Congress charged
with tliu budget legislation.
J . The problem is not an easy ouc. A
fundamental change has taken place
with reference to the position of
America in the world's affairs.
.. Economy Audit Needed '
Another and not less important ns
'pect of the problem is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated
'are. expended. Under existing law
the only audit is for the purpose of.
ascertaining whether expenditures
have been lawfully made within the
"appropriations. No one is author
ized or equipped to ascertain whether
the money has been spent wisely,
, economically and effectively. Tho
auditors should be highly trained ofu
cials with permanent tenure in the
Treasury Department; free of obliga
tions to or motives of consideration
for this or any subsequent admin
istration, and authorized and empow
ered to examine into and make re
port upon the methods employed and
the results obtained by the executive
departments of the government.
Their reports should be made to the
Congress and to tho secretary of the
treasury.
Must Simplify Taxation
I tr,ust that the Congress will give
its immediate consideration to the
problem of future taxation. Simpli
fication of the income' and profits
taxes has become an immediate nec
essity. These taxes performed indis
pensable service during the war.
They must, however, be simplified,
not only to save the taxpayer incon
venience und expense, but in ouder
that his liability may be made certain
and definite.
With reference to tho details of
tho revenue law, the secretary of
.the. treasury and the commissioner
of internal revenue will lay beforu
"you for your consideration certain
amendments necessary or desirable in
connection witli the administration
of the law recommendations which
have my approval and support. It
is of the: utmost importance that iu
dealing with this matter the present
law should not be disturbed so far
as regtfrds taxes for the calendar
year 1020, payable in the calendar
year 11)21, The Congress might well
consider whether the higher rates of
income and profits taxes can in peace
times be effectively productive of
revenue, and whether they may not.
on the contrary, be destructive of
bifslness activity and productive of
waste nnd inefficiency. There is a
point at which in peace times high
rates of income and profits tuxes dis
courage energy, rcinove the incentive
to new enterprise encourage ex
travagant expenditures and produce
industrial stagnation, with conse
quent unemployment and other at
tendant evils.
Public Should Come First
The prejudice aud passions engen-
s dered by decades of controversy be-
. tween two schools of political and
' economic thought tho one believers
y$ in protection American Industries,
me ovaer Denevers 111 lurm iur reve
nue only must bo subordinated to
the single consideration of the public
interest in the light of utterly
changed conditions.
i, i, Before tho war America was heav
K tof the, debtor of the rest of the world,
- ana me interest pujnieiiuj hub nau 10
i maKe to loreign countries on Ameri
can securities held abroad, the ex
penditures of American travelers
abroad and the ocean freight charges
she had to pay to others, about bal
anced the value of her pre-war fa
'' vprhble balance of trade.
' During the war America's exports'
1 have been greatly stimulated, and in-
creased prices have increased their
; values. On tho other hand, she has
purchased a largo proportion of .the
American securities nrevlously held
m , ahroad, has loaned some $11,000,000,-
f r AAA frt tnrnltrn envprnrnPTitll. nnd hfltt

jttMr'M meeting it ueretororo tx
' ironse out havViwijir three yts.jt of
-f- T"""f .TT m. F
meeting the favorable balance of trade
in peace times : lly imports into this
country of gold or of goods, or by
establishing new credits.
Europe Can't Ship Gold
"Europe is in no nosition nt tho
present time to ship gold to us nor
yuum we contemplate large further
imports of gold into this country
without concern. The time has nearly
passed for international governmental
loans and it will take time to de
velop In this country a market for
foreign securities.
Anything, therefore, which would
tend to prevent foreign countries from
settling for our exports by shipments
of goods into this country could only
Iuivo tho effect of preventing' them
from pajlng for our exports and,
therefore, of preventing the exports
from being made.
Tho productivity of the country,
grcntly stimulated by the war, must
find iin outlet by exports to foreign
countrles,.and any measures taken to
prevent imports will inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load the hanking mnchluery of
the country with credits to carry un
sold products and produce industrial
stagnation nnd unemployment.
If wo want to sell, we must bo
prepared t buy. Whatpvcr, there
fore, may have been our views during
tho period of growth of American
business concerning tariff legislation,
we must now adjust our own economic
life to a changed condition growing
out of the fact that American busi
ness is full grown and that America
is the greatest capitalist in the world.
Isolation Policy Antiquated
No policy of isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportunities
of America. The provincial standards
and policies of tho pust, which have
held American business as if iu n
straitjacket, must yield and give
way to the needs iiud exigencies of
the new day in which wo live, n day
full of hope und promise for Ameri
can business, if we will but take ad
vantage of the opportunities that are
ours for the asking.
The recent war has ended our isola
tion and thrown upon us a great duty
and responsibility.
Must Share in Trade Expansion
The United States must share the
expanding world market. The United
States desires for itself only equal
opportunity with the other nations
of the world and that through tho
process of friendly co-operation uud
fair competition the legitimate inter
ests of tho nations concerned may
bo successfully nud equitably ad
justed. There are other matters ot Impor
tance upon which I urged action at
the last session of Cougrcss which aro
still pressing for solution. I am sure
it is not necessary for mo agaiu to
remind you tlitit tliero Is oue im
mediate uud very practicable question
resulting from the war which we
should meet iu the most liberal spirit.
Tt is a matter of recognition and
relief to our soldiers. I can do no
better than to quote from my lust
message urging this very action:
Assist Iteturning Soldiers
"Wo must see to it that our re
turning soldiers are assisted iu every
practicable way to find the places for
which they are fitted in the daily
work of tho country.
"This can be done by developing
and maintaining upon an adequate
scale the admirable organization cre
ated by the Department of Labor for
placing men seeking work, and it
can also be done, in nt least one very
great field, by creating new oppor
tunities for individual enterprise
."The Secretary of the Interior has
pointed out the way by which return
ing soldiers muy bo helped to find and
take up laud iu the hitherto unde
veloped regions of tho country which
the federal government has already
prepared or can readily prepare for
cultivation and also on many of the
cutovcr or neglected areas which lie
within the limits of the older states:
and I once more take tho liberty of
recommending very urgently that hiR
plans slinll receive tlie immediate and
substantial support of the Congress."
In the matter of turifE legislation,
I beg to call your attention to the
statements contained in my last mes
sage urging legislation with reference
to the establishment of the chemical
and dyestuffs industry in America :
"Amoug the industries to which
special consideration should be given
is that of the manufacture Of dye
stuffs and related chemicals. Our
complete dependence upon German
supplies before the war made tho In
terruption of trade, a cause of excep
tional economic disturbance.
Chemical Industry Important
"The close relation between the
manufacture of dyestuffs, on the one
hand, and of explosives and poisonous
gases, on the other, moreover, has
given the industry an exceptional
ulgnillcanco am! value.
"Altliougli Mie United States will
gladly and unhesitatingly Join In the
program of international disarm
ment.lit will, nevertheless, bolt pol
icy of obvious prudence to make cer
tain of tho successful niuintennn
of many strong and well -equipped -
tiieiiucui puiuut.
"The German chemical industry,
with which wo will bo brought into
competition, was and may well bo
agaiu, o thoroughly knit monopoly
capablo of excicislng a competition
of a peculiarly insidious and 'danger
ous kind."
During the war the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service
to the nation. By materially in
creasing tho production of his laud
he supplied America and tho Allies
with the increased amounts of food
necessary to keep their lmraentta
armies in the field. He indispensably
helped to win tho war.
But there is now scarcely less need
of increasing tho production in food
nnd the necessaries of life. I ask
tli Congress to consider .means of
encouraging effort along these lines.
'H3 iwjxwuinoe.ot aolng everythlag
poaaibk ycvmiU, production aleo '
economical lines, to improve market
ing, and to make rural life iriorc at
tractive and healthful, is obvious.
I would urge approval of the pjnns
already proposed to the Congress by
the secretary of agriculture, to secure
tho essential facts required for the
proper study of this question, through
the proposed enlarged programs for
farm munagciueut studies uud crop
estimates.
Develop Natural Ilcsourrcs
I would urge, also, the continuance
pf federal participation in the build
ing of good roads, under the terms of
existing laws and under the direction
of present agencies; the need of fur
ther action on the part of the states
and the Federal Government to pre
serve nnd develop our forest re
sources, especially through the prac
tice of better forestry methods on
privute holdings and the extension of
the publicly owned forests; better
support for couutry schools nnd the
more definite direction of their
courses of study nlong lines related
to rural problems: aud fuller pro
vision for tanltntiou iu rural dis
tricts and the building up of needed
hospital and medical facilities iu
these localities.
Perhaps the wnyvnight be cleared
for many of these desirable reforms
by a fresh, comprcheuslvo survey
made of rural conditions by n con
ference composed of representatives of
tho farmers aud of the agricultural
agencies responsible for leadership.
I would cull your attention to tho
widespread condition of political rest
lessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while various
and complicated, arc superficial rath
er than deep seated.
Names Causes of Unrest
Broadly, they arise from or are
connected with the failure on the
part of our government to arrive
speedily at n just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal
conditions from the transfusion of
radical theories from seething Kuri
pean 'centers pending such delay,
from heartless profiteering resulting
in the increase of the cost of llviug.
and lastly from tho machinations of
passionate and malevolent agitators.
AVith the return to normal con
ditions, this unrest will rapidly dis
appear. In the meantime, it docs
much evil. It seems to me that in
dealing with this situation Congress
should not ho Impatient or drastic
but should seek rather to remove the
causes. It should endeavor to bring
our, country back speedily to 11 peace
basis, with ameliorated llviug con
ditions under tho minimum of restric
tions upon personal liberty that is
consistent with our reconstruction
problems.
And it should arm the federal
government with power to deal in
its criminal courts with those per
sons who by violent methods would
abrogate our time-tested institutions.
With the free expression of opinion
and with the advocacy of orderly po
litical change, however fundamental,
there must be no interference, but
toward passion nnd malevolence
tending to incite crime and insur
rection under the guise of political
evolution there should be no leniency.
Legislation to this end has been
recommended by the attorney general
and should be enacted.
Would Hit High Prices
Tn this direct connection, I would
cnll yout attention to my recom
mendations on August 8. pointing
out legislative measures which would
be effective in controlling nnd bring
ing downline present cost of living,
which contributes so largely to this
unrest. On only one of these lecom
meudatious has the Congress acted.
If the government's campaign is to
be effective, it is necessary that tho
other steps suggested should be acted
on at occc.
Would Extend Food Control
I renew and strongly urge the
necessity of tho extension of the pres
ent food control net as to the period
of time iu which it shall remain iu
operation. The attorney general has
submitted a bill providing for an ex
tension of this act for a period df
six months. As it now stands it is
limited in operation to the period of
the war aud becomes inoperative upon
the formal proclamation of peace. It
is imperative that it should be ex
tended nt once. The Department of
Justice has built up extensive ma
chinery for the purpose of enforcing
its provisions; nil of which must be
abandoned upon the conclusion of
peace unless the provisions of this act
are extended.
During this period the Cougrcss will
have an opportunity to make similar
provisions nnd regulations with re
gard to all goods destined for inter
state commerce and to exclude them
from interstate shipment, if the re
quirements of the law are not com
pile! with.
Some suph regulation Is impera
tively necessary. The abuses that
have grown up In the manipulation of
pricesiby the withholding of food
stuffs and other, necessaries of life
cannot otherwiso be effectively pre
vented. There ran be no doubt of
either the necessity or the legitimacy
of such measures.
Asic Funds for Publicity
As I pointed iu my last message,
publicity can accomplish a great deal
iu this campaign. The alms of the
government must be clearly brought
to the attention of tho consuming
public, civic organizations und stato
officials, who. are in a position to lend
their assistance to our efforts. You
havo made available funds with which
to carry on this campaign, but there
is no provision in the law authoriz
ing their expenditure for tho purposo
of ranking the public fully informed
about tiie efforts of tho government.
Specific recommendation has been
made by the attorney general in this
regard. I would strongly urge upon
you its Immediate adoption, as it
constitutes one of the preliminary
steps to this campaign.
Cites N. J. Cold-Sforago Laws
I also renew my recommendation
that the Congress pass a law reg
ulating cold storage as it is regu
lated, for example, by tho laws of
the state ot New Jersey, which limit
the time during which goods may bo
kept in storage, prescribe the method
of disposing of them if kept beyond
the permitted period, nnd require that
goods released from storage shall in
ail cases bear the daje of their re
ceipt It would materially add to tho
serviceability of tho law, for tho pur
poso wo now have in view, If it wero
also prescribed that all goods re
leased from Btorago for interstate
shipment should havo plainly marked
upon each package the selling pr
market price at which they went Into
storage.
By this means the purchaser would
always be able to learn what profits
stood between him and the producer
or the wholesale dealer.
I would also renew my recommen
dation that all goods destined for in.
tenttate commerce Miwld ia every

We should formulate a law requir
ing a federal license of all corpora
tions engaged iu interstate commerce
nnd embodying in the license, or iu
tho conditions under which it is to
l)e issued, specific regulations design
ed to secure competitive selllug and
prevent unconscionable profits in the
method of marketing.
Shipping Itcfoi-ms Much Needed
Such u law would afford a welcome
opportunity to effect other much
iieeded reforms in the business of
interstate shipment and iu the mcth
tods of corporations which are engaged
in it; but for the moment I confine
my recommendations to the object
immediately in hand, which is to
lower the cost of living.
Definite Labor Program Needed
No oue who has observed the march
of events in the lust 5 car can fail
to note the nbsolutc need of a definite
program to bring about an improve
ment iu the conditions of labor. There
can be 110 settled conditions leading
to increased production aud a reduc
tion in the cost of living it labor and
capital aro to be antagonists instead
of partuers. Sound thinking and uu
honest desire to serve the interests
of the whole nation, as distinguished
from the interests of a class, must be
applied to the solution of this grclt
ami pressing problem.
T.ie failure ot other uatious to con
sider this matter iu a vigorous way
lias produced bitterness aud jeal
ousies and antagonisms, the food of
radicalism. The only way to keep
men from agitating against grlcv -antes
Is to remove tho grievances.
An unwillingness even f 0 discuss these
matters piodiiccs only dissatisfaction,
nnd pives comfort to the cxtrcmo ele
ments in our country which endeavor
to stir up disturbances in order to
piovoho governments to cmhaiU upon
u ionise of retaliation and repression.
The seed of revolution is repression.
Tho remedy for these things must uot
ho uegative in character. It must bo
constructive. It must comprehend the
general interest. The real nntidote
for tho unrest which manifests itself
is not suppression, but n deep con
sideration of the wrongs that beset
our national life nud the application
of a remedy.
Klglit of Collective Bargaining
Congress lias already shown its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrougs by establishing the
eight-hour day iin the standard in
every field of labor. It has sought
to find a way to prevent child labor.
It has served the whole country by
leading tho way iu developing the
means of preserving and safeguard
ing lives and health in dangerous in
dustries. It must now help in tho
dlfiiciilt task of finding a. method that
will bring about a genuino democra
tization of Industry, based upon tho
full recognition of tho light of those
who work, in whatccr rank, to par
ticipate in some organic way iu every
decision which directly affects their
welfare.
It is with this purpose in mind
that I called a conference to meet, iu
Washington on December 1 to consid
er these problems in all their broad
aspects, with the idea of bringing
about a better understanding be
tween theso two interests.
Must Krcognlzo Labor's Aims
Tho great unrest throughout the
world, out of 'which has emerged n
demand for an immediate considera
tion of the differences between capital
and labor, bids us put our own housu
in r.rdct.
Fmiihly, there ran he no permanent
nnd lasting settlements between capi
tal ai.n labor which do not recognize
me lunilumental concepts tor wlilcii
labor has been struggling through liio
yens.
The whole world gave its recogni
tion nnd indorsement to these funda
mental purposes iu the league of na
tions. The statesmen gathered at
Versailles recognized the fact that
world stability could not ho had by
reverting to industrial standards and
conditions against which the average
workman of the world had revolted.
It Is expected, therefore, that the
task of tho statesmen of this new day
of change and readjustment is to
recognize world conditions und to seek
to bring about through 'legislation
conditions that will mean the ending
of nge-long antagonisms between
capital nnd labor and that will hope
fully lead to tho building up of n
comradeship which will result not
only iu greater coutcutmeut amoug

tho mass ot workmen, but also bring
about a greater production and 11
greater prosperity to business itself.
Many Demands Aro Just
To nuul.xzc the particulais in the
demands of labor is to admit the jus
tice of their complaint in many mat
ters that lie ut their bases. The
workmen demands an adequate wage,
sufficient to permit him to live in
coinfoit, unhampered by the fear of
powrty and want in his old age.
Ho demands the right to live and
the right to work amidst sanitary
surroundings, both in home and in
workshop, surroundings that develop
and do not retard his own health and
well-being; aud the right to provide
for his chlldicu's wants in the mat
ter of health and educatiou.
In other words. It Is Ills deslro to
make tho conditions of his life and
the lives of thoso dear to him tol
erable aud easy to hear.
Way to Industrial Pcaco
The establishment of (lie principles
regarding labor laid dowit Iu the cove
nant of tho league of nations offers us
tho way to industrial peace and 1011
(ilialiiin. No other road lies opeit to
us. Not to pursue this one is longer
to invite enmities, bitterness, and an
tagonisms which in the end only
lead to Industrial and social disaster.
Tim unwilling workman is not a
profitable servant. An cmploje
whose industrial life is hedged about
bj haul aud unjust conditions, which
he did not create aud over which lie
has no coutiol, lacks that line spirit
of enthusiasm and volunteer effort
which are the necessary ingredient
of a great producing entity. Let us
ho frank about this solemn matter.
The evidences of world-wide unrest
which manifest themselves iu viuleuco
throughout the world bid 11s pause and
consider the means to be found to stop
th6 spread of this contagious thing
before it saps the very vitality ot thu
uatiou itself.
Do we gain strength by withhold
ing the remedy? (Jcas it not tho bus
iness of-statesmeu to treat these niuu
ilcstations of unrest which meet us
on ecry hand as evidences of an
economic disoider nud to apply con
structive remedies wherever neces
sary, being sure that in the applica
tion ot the leaiedy we touch not the
vital tissues of our industrial and
economic life? There can bo no re
cession of the tide of unrest until
constructive instrumentalities are set
up to stem tli.il tide.
Bight to Bargain Collectively
Governments must rccogui.o the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humane objects that have at their
base the inuluul piotection and wel
fare of those engaged in all indus
tries, liibor must not be longer treat
ed as a commodity. It must bo re

ami industry iu cmplojincnt Is un
thinkable. The terrible tragedy of
war which has just ended and which
has brought tho world to the verge of
chaos nud disaster would bo in vain
it there should ensue return to tho
conditions of the past. Duropc itself,
whence lias como tho unrest which
now holds the world nt bay, is an
example o( standpatUm in theso vital
huniano matters which America might
well accept as an example, not to
he followed but studiously to bo
avoided. Kuropo modo labor the dif
ferential, nnd tho price of it all is en
mity and untngomism and prostrated
industry. Tho right ot labor to livo
in peace nnd comfort must bo recog
nized by governments and America
should he tho first to lay tho founda
tion stones upon which industrial
peaca shall ba built.
lustico to Both Sides
Labor not; only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should re
ceive a reasonable return upou its in
vestment nnd is entitled to protection
at the hands of the government in
every emergency. No government
worthy of the naino can "play these
elements against each other, for there
Is a mutuality of interest between
them which the government must
seh to express and to safeguard at
all cost.
Klght to Strike Inviolate
The right of individuals to strike
is inviolate and ought not to bo in
terfered with by any process of gov
ernment, but there is a predominant
right, and that is the right of the
government to protect all of its peo
ple and to assert its power and maj
esty against the challenge of nny
class. The government, when it as
serts that right, seeks not to an
tagonize a class, but simply to de
fend the right of the whole people
as against the irreparable harm and
injury that might be done by the at
tempt by any class to usurp a power
that only government itself has a
right to exercise as a protection
to all.

putes which have led to war, states
men hive sought to set up as a
remedy nrhitiatlou for war.

five years bd to war nnd disaster?
America, witnessing the evil conse
quences which have followed out of
such disputes between the contending
forces, must not admit itself im
potent to dcnl with these matters by
means of penccful processes. Surely,
there must be some method of bring
ing together in n council of peace nud
amity these two great interests, out
of which will come n happier day of
peace and co-opcrntlon, a day that
will make for more comfort and hap
piness in living nnd a more tolerable
condition among all classes of men.
Certainly human intelligence can de
vise some acceptable tribunal for ad
justing the differences between capi
tal aud labor.
America's Hour of Test
TIilS is the hour of test nnd trial
for America, lly her prowess and
strength and the indomitable courage
of her soldiers she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conception of liberty and
justice. Let not her influence as a
mediator between capital nnd labor
ho weakened and licr own failure
to settlo matters of purely domestic
concern ho proclaimed to the world.
There are those In this country
who threaten direct action to forco
their will upon a majority. Itussia
tpday, with Its blood nnd terror, is
a painful object lessou of the power
of minorities. It makes little differ
ence what minority is; whether capi
tal or labor, or any other chlss; no
sort of privilege will ever be per
mitted to dominate tilts country. We
are a partnership or nothing that is
worth while. We are a democracy,
where the majority are the masters,
or all the hopes aud purposes of the
men who founded this government
have been defeated nnd forgotten.
In America there is but one way
by which great reforms can be ac
complished and tho relief sought by
classci obtained, and that is through
the orderly processes of reprcseututive

No Privileged Class
The message closed with a pointed

jority. It makes little difference AVhat;

clared were tho only ones by which re
lief nnd reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any other
method of reform nre enemies of this
couutry," the message saifl. "Let those
beware who' take the shorter road of
disorder and revolution."
