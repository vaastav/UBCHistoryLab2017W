CHAPTER XXIV.
!. Olivia Fiwii-r, take up tho thread of
the storythe woful, wonry uurratlvs of
Iny wamlcrliiin aftur leaving my Island
frlvmta.
Once mora I found uirwlf In London.
! bad uiore acquaintance with nttnNt ev
ery great city un I lie Oouilnont. I'Vtu
,. nsU.lr, 'i'ar.llf bad given mo the address
of a boardUm limn., or rather small
family hotel, where be bud stayed two
or three times, am 1 drovt! there at om-,
I wvut la several governess Bgi'Uclcs,
which were advertising fur leather In
tli a daily paper. Winn a fortnight bad
passed with no opening fur mo, I felt
It necessary to leave thu boarding house
which bad been my temporary home.
Wandering about the leant fashlouablo
auburlm, where lu Iging would rust least,
I found a bedroom In tho third atury of a
bouse In a tolerably respectable ulrwt.
In thla feverish aolluido one dny UritK
gml liavlf after another with awful mo
notony. A tht'y punned by, tho only
change they brouiibt waa that tbe aultry
boat grow ever cooler, and thu long day
ahorter. Think what a dreary Ufa for a
young girl! I waa aa fond of companion
ship, und m-eded love aa much na any
girl. jV It atranue that my thouxhta
dwelt aoiuewhnt ilaliKcroimly upon tho
l)eniit, en n til dny lu Surk T
Now and tn u. when I ventured out
Into tho atreetH, a panic would aeUe mv.
a dread unutterably great, that I might
meet my biiNlmnd amldat tbe crowd. 1
did not even know that bo wna lu Iaiii
don; be hud alwaya apo'xen of It an a
place ho ili tentod. Ilia babita made tho
free, muonventlouiil life upon thu Con
tinent more aurccnhlu to him, llow be
wna living now, what be waa dolug,
where bo waa, were ao many eulguina to
mo; and I did not care to run any rlxk
in finding out the anawera to them. Twice
I pnnaod the Ilnuk of Australia, where
very probnbty I could bavo learned If
be wa lu the nmo city aa myself; but 1
do red not do It, and aa aoou aa I know
how to avoid that at rift, I never puaacd
along It.
I bad been allowed to leave my addrcxa
with the clerk of a large geuerul agency
iu the city, Towarda the cloao of Oc
tober I received a note from him, deair
lug me to call at the oitleu at two o'clock
tbe following afternoon, without fall. 1
bad a lung time to wait. The olllco clock
pointed to hair-punt three before I caught
the clerk'a eye, and itv hiui beckon me
' up to the counter. 1 bad thrown back
uiy veil, for here I wna perfectly e.ife
from recoKtiitioti. At the other end of
tbe counter atood a young ma a lu con
aultation with a clerk, lie looked enr
neatly at me, but I wa sure be could
not kuow me.
"Mi ICIlen Mnrtiueau?" anld tho clerk.
That win my mother' unme, mid I hud
adopted It for my own, feeling aa if 1
bud imiia right to it.
"Yea," I auawered.
"Would you object to go Into a French
chool aa govcruca?'' he Inquired.
"Not in tho leant," I aaid engcrly.
"And pay a amull premium?" he add
ed. "llow much?" I Baked, my spirit fall
ing again.
"A mere trifle," ho said; "about ten
pound or ao for twelve months. You
would perfect yourself In French, you
know; and you would guin a referee for
the futuro."
"I muHt think about it," I replied.
"Well, there U tbe address of a lady
who cun give you ail tho particulars," be
aaid, banding me a written paper.
I loft tho olllco heavy hearted. Ten
pounds would be more than tho half of
the little store left to me. Yet, would It
not be wiser to secure a refuge and shel
ter for twelve months than run tho risk
of not llnding any other situation? I
walked slowly along tho street towards
the busier thoroughfares, with my head
bent down and my mind busy, when sud
denly a heavy band was laid upon my
arm, grasping it with crushing force, and
a harsh, thick voice shouted triumphant
ly in my ear:
"I've caught you at Inst!'"
It was liko tho bitterness of death, that
chill and terror sweeping over me. My
husbund's hot breath was upon my cheek,
and bis cyea wore looking closely into
mine, ltut before I could speak bis grasp
was torn away from mo, and ho was
sent whirling Into the middle of tbe
road. I turned, almost in equal terror, to
aee who had thrust hiniKclf between us.
It was a stranger whom I had noticed
in tho agency olllce. But bis face was
now dark with passion, and as my hus-.
band staggered buck again towards us,
his hand was ready to thrust him awuy
a second tiuio.
"She's my wife," he stammered, trying
to get past the stranger to me. By this
time a knot of spectators bad formed
about us, and a policeman had como up.
Tho stranger drew my arm through his,
and faced them defiantly.
"Hu'b a drunken vagabond!" ho said;
"he has just come out of those spirit
vaults. This young lady is no more bis
wife than she is mine, and I know no
more of her than that she has just come
away from Ridley's olllce, where she has
been looking after a situation. Good
heavens! cannot a lady walk through tho
streets of "London without being Insult
ed by a drunken scoundrel liko that?"
"Will you give him in charge, sir?"
asked the policeman, while liichnrd Fos
ter was making vain efforts to speak co
herently, and explain his claim upon mo.
I clung to the friendly arm that had come
to my aid, sick and almost speechless with
fear.
"Don't," I whispered; "oh! take me
way quickly."
Ho cleared a passage for us both with
vigor and decision that there was no re
sisting. I glanced back for an instant,
and saw my husband struggling with tho
policeman. lie looked utterly unlike a
gay, prosperous, wealthy man, with a
well-filled purse, such as be hud used to
appear.. lie was shabby and poor enough
now for the policeman to be very hard
on him, and to prevent him from follow
ing me. The stranger kept my hand
firmly on his arm, and almost carried
me into Fleet street, where In a mluute
Stretton
or two we were quite lout lu Die throng,
and I was sufu from all pursuit.
"I do not know how to thunk yoft," 1
aal I, fulterlugly.
"You are rembllng still!" he replied.
"How lucky It was that 1 followed joi
directly out of Illdlcy's! If 1 ever coma
acroaa that aeomi irel aalii I all a II know
him, yon may be sure. My nntne la John
Senior. I'erhnp you have beard of my
father, lr. Senior of Itrook street?"
"No," replied, "I kuow nobody in Lou
don."
"That's bad," be anld. "I wish I wna
Jane Senior instead of John Senior; I do
Indeed, Ilo you ftel belter now, Mia
Martlueau?"
"How do you kuow my niimo?" I osU
d. "The clerk at Ilidley's culled you Miss
Kllen Martlueau," lie answered. "My
bearing is very good, and I was not die;
ly engroaaed in my Imsliica. I heard and
aaw a good deal wblUt I Wits there."
He called an empty cnb that was pann
ing by. We shook hands warmly. There
w,i no time for lowering; so 1 told blm
the name, of (he auburb where I was
living, Mid he repented it to the cabmnu.
"All right," he sai l, speaking through
the window, "the fare U paid and I've
taken cabby's number. If ho tries to
client you, let me know; Dr. John Senior.
Itrook treet. I hope that situation will
be a good oue, and very pleuitaiit. Good
by." "Good by." I cried, leaning forward and
looking at bis face till the crowd came
between ua, and I lust sight of It.
I felt safer when the calunuD set me
down at the house where I lodged, ami
I ran upalulr to my littlo room. I klu-

died tho lire. Then I But down on my i
box before It, thinking.
Yes; 1 must leave London. I must take
this situation, tho only one open to me, j
tn a school In France. I should at leant
bo assured of a home for twelve months;
and, as the clerk bud said, I should per-'
feet myself ia French and gain a ref
eree. I should be earning a character in
fact. The sooner I fled from London
again the better, now that I knew my
husband was somewhere iu it. I unfold
ed tho paper on which was written tho
namo of tho lady to whom I was to ap
ply. Mrs. Wilkinson, 19 Hellringer
street. I ran down to the sitting room,
to nsk my landlady where It was, iinl
told her, in my new hopefulness, that I
had heard of a situation In France. Hell
ringer street was less than a mile away.
I could bo there before seven o'clock, uot
too Into perhaps for Mrs. Wilkinson to
give me an interview.
No. 10 wus not dttncult to find, and I
pulled tho bell handle with a gentle mid
quiet pull. A slight, thin child in rusty
mourning opened it, with the chain
across, and asked in a timid voice who
I wna.
"Does Mrs. Wilkinson live here?" I
asked.
"Yes," sold the child.
"Who Is there?" I heard a voice call
ing shrilly from within.
"I am come about a school Jn Franco,"
I anld to the child.
"Oh, I'll let you in," she answered eag
erly; "uhe will see you about that, I'm
sure. I'm to go with yon, if you go."
She let down the chain, and opened the
door. There was a dim light burning
in the hall, which looked shabby and
poverty stricken. I had only time to take
a vague general impression, beforo tbe
littlo girl conducted me to a room on the
ground floor.
"I'm to go it you go," she said again;
"and, oh! I do so hope you will agree to
go."
"I think I shall," I answered.
"I daren't be sure," she replied, nod
ding her head with an air of sngmity;
"there have been four or five governesses
hero, and none of them would go. You'd
have to take me with you; and, oh! It is
such a lovely, beautiful place. See! hero
is a picture of it." .
She ran eagerly to a side table, on
which lay a book or two, one of which
aho opened, and reached out a photo
graph, which had been laid there for se
curity. It was clear, sharply defined. At
the left hand stood a handsome bouse,
with windows covered with lace cur
tains, and provided with outer Venetian
shutters. In the center stood a large
squaro garden, with fountains, and ar
bors and stnttios; and behind this stood
a long building of two stories, and a steep
roof with dormer windows, every case
ment of which was provided, like the
house in the front, with rich lace cur
tains and Venetian shutters. ' The whole
place was clearly In good order and good
taste, and looked like a very pleasant
home. . i
"Isn't It a lovely place?" asked tho
child beside me, with a deep sigh of long-lug.
'
"Yea." f anld.' "I almntd Ilk. in an

"I have not the honor of knowing you,"
she nal.l politely.
"I come from Kidley's Agency office,"
I answered, "about a situation a Eug

"It Is a great cbuiice," clio said, "my
friend, Madams I'crrler, is ver good,

like a slater for ihcm. Tlia term a are
very high, very high for Franc; but
there Is absolutely every comfort 1 up

"No." I answered, "I am afraid 1 could
not. I am sure I could not.
"That of course must be ronxlderej
in the premium," she continued; "If you
could huve Introduced, say, six pupil.
tbe premium would be low, I do not
think my friend would take one penny
less than twenty pounds for the first year,
and teu for the second.
The tear started to my eyes. I bad
felt so a i re of going If 1 would pay ten
pounds, that I was qullo unprepared for
this disappointment. There was still my
diamond ring left; but how to dispose of
it, for anything like its value, I did not
know.
"What were you prepared to give?"
asked Mrs. Wilkinson, whilst I besitat
d.
"Tbe cbrk at Uldley's office told me
the premium would be ten pounds," I an
swered; "I do not see bow I can give
more."
"Well," ahe said, after musing a little,
"It Is time this child went. She has been
here a month, waiting for somebody to
take her dowa to Noireau. I will agree
with you, and will explain to Madam
Terrier. How soon could you go?
"I should like to go to-morrow," I re
plied, feeling that the sooner I quitted
London tbe better. Mrs. Wilkinson's
steady eyes fustened upon me again with
sharp curiosity."
"Have you references, miss?" she ask'
ed.
ft
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD."
"No," I faltered, my hopes sinking
again before this old difficulty.
"It will be necessary, then," she auld,
"for you to give the money to me, and
I will forward It to Madiimo Perrier.
Pardon, miss, but you perceive I could
not send a teacher to them unless I knew
that sho could pay the money down."
I did not waver any longer. The pros
pect seemed too promising for me to lose
It by any Irresolutiou. I drew out my
purse, and laid down two out of the three
five-pound notes left me. She gave me a
formal receipt in the names of Emile and
Louise Terrier, and her Bobcr face wore
un expression of satisfaction.
"There! It is done," she snid. "You
will take lessons, nuy lessons you please,
from the professors who attend the
school. It is a grand chance, miss, a
grand chance. Let us say you go the day
after to-morrow; the child will be quite
ready. She Is going for four years to
that splendid plnce, a place for ladies of
tho highest degree."
At that moment nn imperious kno k
sounded upon the outer door, and the lit
tle girl run to answer It, leaving the door
of our room open. A voice which I knew
well, a voice which made my heart stand
still and my veins curdle, spoke in sharp,
loud tones in the hall.
"Is Mr. Foster come home yet?" were
the words the terrible voice uttered, quite
close to me It seemed; so close that I
shrank back shivering, as if every sylla
ble struck a separate blow. All niy
senses were awuke; I could hear every
Bound iu the hall, each step that came
nearer and nenrer. Was she about to
enter the room where I was sitting?
She stood still for half a minute as if
uncertain what to do.
"Ho is upstairs," said the child's
voice. "He told me he was ill when I
opened the door for him."
"Where is Mrs. Wilkinson?" she ask
ed. "She Is here," said the child, "but
there's a lady with her."
Then the woman's footsteps went on
up the staircase. I listened to them
climbing up one step after another, my
brain throbbing with each sound, and 1
heard a door opened and closed. Mrs.
Wilkinson had gone to the door, and
looked out into the hall, as If expecting
other questions to be asked. She had
not seen my panic of despair. I must
get away before I lost the use of my
senses, for I felt giddy and falut.

while the punishment for an unsuccessful

enormity of the offense against our Insti

KCOXOMIC CONDITIO. j
Restoration of Canfldeace aad Re.
tara of Proaperltr j
During the laat five yeara business con
fldence has been restored, and the ' Na
tion la to be congratulated because of Its
present abounding prosperity. Such pros
perity can never be created by law alone,
although it is easy enougb to destroy It
by mischievous laws.
In dealing with business Intents',
for the Government to undertake, by
crude and Ill-considered legislation, to do
what may turn out to be bad, would be
to incur the risk of such rar-reacUng
national disaster that It would be pB'f
erable to undertake nothing at all. Ihe
men who demand tho Impossible or the
undesirable serve as the allies of the
force with which they are nominally at
war, (or they hamper those who would
endeavor to And out In rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and in what manner It ia practi
cable to supply remedies. j
Reajatatloa of Corporations. (
There la a widespread conviction in tie
minds of the American people that tbe
great corporations known as trusts are
In certain of their features and tenden
cies hurtful to the general welfare. Thla
springs from no spirit of envy or un
charitableness, nor lack of pride tn the
great Industrial achievement that have
placed this country at the bead of the
nations struggling for commercial su
premacy. It Is based upon sincere
conviction that corablnatlo and concen
tration should be, not prohibited, but su
pervised, and, within reasonable limits,
controlled; and in my Judgnent thla con
viction Is right. f
The first essential In determining how to
deal with the great Industrial combina
tions 1 knowledge of facts publicity.
Department of Commerce and Indus,
tries.
There should be created a Cabinet of
ficer, to be known as Secretary of Com
merce and Industries, as provided in the
bill Introduced at the last session of the
Congress. It should be bis province to
deal with commerce In Its broadest sense;
Including among many other things what.
ever concerns labor and all matters affect
ing the great business corporations ana
our merchant marine.
Chinese Exrlnelon.
Not only must our labor be protected
by the tariff, but It should also be pro
tected, so far as It Is possible, from the
presence in mis country of any laborers
brought over by contract. oCof those who,
coming freely, yet represent a standard
of living so depressed that the? can un
dersell our men In the labor market and
drag them to a lower level. I regard It as
necessary, with this end U view, to re
enact Immediately the law excluding Chi
nese laborers, and to strengthen It wher
ever necessary in order to make Its en
forcement entirely effective.
Trades Inlona.
The most vital problem with which tnls
country, and for that matter the whole
civilised world, has to deal, is the prob
lem vwncu nue lor one slue tne better
ment of social conditions, moral and phy
sical, in large cities, and for another siae
the effort to deal with that tangle of far
reaching question which we group togeth
er when we speak of "labor." The chief
factor in the success of each man wage
worker, farmer and capitalist alike must
ever be the sum total of his own In
dividual qualities and ' abilities. Second
only to this comes th nnwor of not
ing In combination or association with
others. Very great cood haa been and
will be accomplished by associations or
unions of wage-workers, when managed
with forethought and when they com-
ome insistence upon their own rlnhts with
law-abiding respect for the rights of oth-
CI3.
Better Immigration Lawa Weeded.
Our present Immigration laws are un
satisfactory. We need every honest and
etlictent Immigrant fitted to become an
American cltlsen, every 'Immigrant who
cornea here to stay, who brings here a
strong body, a stout heart, a good head,
and a resolute purpose to do his duty well
In every way, and to bring up his chil
dren as law-abiding and God-fearing
members of the community. But there
should be a comprehensive law enacted
with the object of working; a three-told
Improvement over our present system.
Both the educational and economic ipst.
In a wise Immigration law should be de
signed to protect and elevate the general
body, politic and social. A very close su
pervision should be exercised over the
steamship companies, which mainly bring
over the immigrants, and they should be
held to a strict accountability tor any
Infraction of the law.
Tariff Kevlalon Hnrtfnl.
There Is general acaulescence in nnr
present tariff system as a National policy.
The first requisite to our prosperity Is the
continuity and stability of this economic
policy. Nothing could be more unwise
tnan to custom the business interests of
the country by any general tariff hane
at this time
Reciprocity must be treated aa thn hand.
maiden of protection. Our first duty is
to see that the protection granted by the
tariff In every case where it is needed is
maintained, and that reciprocity be sought
for so far as it can safely be donn with.
out Injury to our home Industries.
Condition of the Merchant Marine.
Tbe condition of the American mer
chant marine is such as to call for Imme
diate remedial action by the Congress. It
is discreditable to us as a Nation that
our merchant marine should be utterly
insignificant in comparison to that of
other nations which we overtop in other
forms of business. We Should not longer
submit to conditions under which only a
trifling portion of our great commerce la
carried in our own ships.
Financial Matters.
In many respects the National banking
law furnishes sufficient liberty for the
proper exercise of the banking; function;
but there aeems to be need of better
safeguards against the deranging influence
of commercial crises and financial panics.
Moreover, the currency of th eountry
should be made rmponslve to the de
mand of our domestic trade and com
merce, s
orpins In' the Treasury.
The collections from duties on Imports
and internal taxes continue to exceed the
ordinary expenditures of the Government,
thanks mainly to the reduced Army ex
penditure. The utmost care should be
taken nt to reduce the revenues so that
there will be any possibility of a denctt;
but, after providing against any such con
tingency, means should be adopted which
will bring the revenues more nearly with
in the limit of our actual needs, in his
report to the Congress the Secretary of the
Treasury considers all thtm queatlons at
length, and t ask your attention to the
report and' ' recommendations.
Interstate Commerce Law.
In 18X7, a measure was enacted for the
regulation of interstate railway, com
monly known as the Interstate commerce
act. The cardinal provisions of that act
wer that railway rate should be Just and
reasonable, and that all shippers, local
ities and commodities should be accorded
equal treatment. A commission waa cre
ated and endowed with what were sup
posed to be the necessary powers to exe
cute the provisions of this act.
Tbe act should be amended. The rail
way Is a public servant. Its rates should
lie just to and open to all shippers al.-e.
The Government should see to it tbat
wltbln Its Jurisdiction this Is so, and
should provide a speedy, Inexpensive and
effective remedy to tbat end.
Department of Aarlenltore.
Tbe Department of Agriculture, during
the past 15 year, ha steadily broadened
Its work on economic lines, and bas ac
complished results of real value In up
building domestic and foreign trade. It
has gone Into new fields until It is now in
touch with all sections of our country and
with two of the Island groups that have
lately come under our jurisdiction, whose
people must look to agriculture as a live
llhood. It Is searching the world for
grains, grasses, fruits and vegetables spe
cially fitted for Introduction into localities
of the several states and territories where
tbey may add materially to our resources.
Valne of the Forests.
Tbe practical usefulness of the National
forest reserves to the mining, grazing. Ir
rigation and other Interests of the regions
In wnicn tne reserves ne nas tea 10 u. wide
spread demand by the people of the West
for their protection and extension. The
forest reserves will Inevitably be of still
greater use in the future than in the past.
Additions should be made to them when
ever practicable, and their usefulness
should be increased by a thoroughly business-like
management
At present the protection of the forest
reserves rests with the General Land Of
fice, the mapping and description of their
timber with the United Siates Geological
Survey, and the preparation of plans for
their conservative use with the Bureau
of Forestry, which is also charged with
the general advancement of practical for
estry In the United States. These vari
ous functions should be united In the Bu
reau of Forestry, to which they properly
belong.
Certain of the forest reserves should also
be made preserves for the wild forest
creatures. All of the reserves should be
better protected from fires.
Reclaiming; Arid Lands.
The reclamation of the unsettled arid
public lands presents a different problem.
Here It is not enough to regulate the flow
of streams. The object of the Government
is to dispose of the land to settlers who
will build homes upon it. To accomplish
this object water must be brought within
their reach.
Whatever the" Nation does for tbe ex
tension of irrigation should barmonlxe
with, and tend to improve, the condition
of those now living on irrigated land. We
are not at the starting point of this devel
opment. Over J200.000.000 of private cap
ital has already been expended In the con
struction of Irrigation works, and many
million acres of arid land reclaimed.
Lax and uncertain laws have made
It possible to establish rights to water in
excess of actual uses or necessities, and
many streams have already passed Into
private ownership, or a control equivalent
to ownership.
Nation's Aid Justified.
The benefits which have followed the
unaided development of the past Justify
the Nation's aid and co-operation In the
mere difficult and important work yet to
be accomplished
IXSILAR MATTERS.
What Mast Be Done to Develop
Hawaii.
In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on the traditional Ameri
can lines.
Forto Rico.
It is a pleasure to say that It Is hardly
more necessary to report as to Porto

and Is thriving as never before, and it is
being administered efficiently and honest
ly. Its people are now enjoying liberty
and order under the protection of the
United States, and upon this fact we con
gratulate them and ourselves.
Cubn.
In Cuba such progress has been made
toward putting the Independent govern
ment of the Island upon a firm footing
that before the present session of the Con
gress closes this will be an accomplished
fact. Cuba will then start as her own
mistress: and to the beautiful Queen of
the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page
of her destiny, we extend our heartiest
greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I
have discussed the question of reciprocity.
In the case of Cuba, however, there are
weighty reasons of morality and of Na
tional Interest why the policy should be
held to have a peculiar application, and I
most earnestly ask your attention to the
wisdom. Indeed to the vital need, of pro
viding for a substantial reduction In the
tariff duties on Cuban Imports into tbe
United States.
The Philippines.
In the Philippines our problem Is larg
er. They are very rich tropical Islands,
Inhabited by many varying tribes, repre
senting widely different stages of pro
gress toward civilisation. Our earnest
effort la to help these people upward
along the stony and difficult path that
leads to self-government. We hope to
make our administration of the Island
honorable to our Nation by making It of
the highest benefit to the Filipinos them
selves; and as an earnest of what we In
tend to do, we point to what we have
done.
Additional Legislation Keeded.
The time has come when there should
be additional legislation for the Philip
pines. Nothing better can be done for the
Islands than to Introduce Industrial enter,
prises. Nothing would benefit them so
much as throwing them open to industrial
development. The connection between
Idleness and mischief is proverbial, and
the opportunity to do remunerative work
Is one of the surest preventives of war.
Paclflo Cable.
I call your attention most earnestly to
the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and
the Philippines, to be continued from the
Philippines to points In Asia. We should
not defer a day longer than necessary the
construction of such a cable. It is de
manded not merely for commercial, but
for political and military considerations.

Is, therefore, an essential condition of
water conservation.
The Government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as it does other

regulate the flow of streams, the water

Treatment of Indiana.
In my judgment the time has arrived
when we should definitely make up our

Permanent Censns Bnrean.
For the sake of good administration,
sound economy and the advancement of
science, the Census Office, as now consti
tuted, should be made a permanent Gov
ernment bureau. This would insure bet
ter, cheaper and more satisfactory work,
in the Interest not only of our business,
but of statistic, economic and social sci
ence. The Postal Service.
The remarkable growth of the postal
service Is shown in the fact that its reve

have nearly doubled within 12 years. Its
progressive development compels con

Chinese Situation.
The general terms of the settlement of
the questions growing out of the anti
foreign uprisings in China of 1900, having
been formulated tn a joint note addressed
to China by the representatives of the
Injured powers in December last, were
promptly accepted by the Chinese Gov.
ernment. After protracted conferences
the plenipotentiaries of the several powers
were able to sign a final protocol with
the Chinese plenipotentiaries on the Tth
of last September, setting forth the meas
ures taken by China in compliance with
the demands of the joint note, and ex
pressing their satisfaction therewith
The agreement reached disposes in a
manner satisfactory to the powers of the
various grounds of complaint, and will
contribute materially to better future re
lations between China and the powers.
