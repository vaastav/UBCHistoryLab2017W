Fault of the Clerk,
The court clerk was examining an
applicant for citizenship papers. Un
fortunately the clerk didn't ask his
questions In the order In which the
man from across the seas had been
taught the answers.
"Do you speak English ?" asked the
clerk.
"Sure, Mike," was the answer.
"How long have you been In this
country?"
"Michigan."
"How tall are you!"
"Forty years."
The clerk sighed. "I think you'd
better get an interpreter," he said.

to play the part even without Invitation from

the task .was undertaken with a true and
disinterested enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested self

it was always difficult to maintain such a
role without offense to the pride of the peo
pies whose freedom of action we sought to
protect and without provoking serious mis

men of the country would be asked to bind
themselves to serve with the colors for pur

a final footing of strength and efficiency
and to press that plan to completion wimm
the next five years. We have always looked
to the Navy of th country as our first
and chief line of defense; we have always
seen it to be our manifest course of pru
dence to be strong on the seas. Tear by
year we have been, creating a navy wnicn
now ranks very high Indeed among the
navlee of the maritime nations. We should
now definitely deetrmine how we snail com
plete what we have begun, and how soon.

of 10 battleships, I battle cruisers, 10 scout
cruisers, 6l destroyers, in iieet auomarinev,
86 coast submarines, 4 gunboats. 1 hospital

The Secretary of the Navy Is asking also
for the Immediate addition to the personnel
of the Navy of 7500 sailors, 250O apprentice

would be sufficient to cars for the ships

Colorado Drys Win Out.
Denver The authority of Colorado
to enact and enforce state-wide pro
hibition was upheld by the State Su

The court held that cities governed un
der special charter were without au
thority to continue traffic in intoxicat
ing liquors after January 1, 1916, when
the state-wide prohibition becomes ef
fective. George Q. Richmond, deputy

whether we will or not. There le, for ex
ample, a very pressing question of trade
and shipping involved in this great problem
of National adequacy. It Is necessary for
many weighty reasons of National efficiency
anrt develooment that we should have a
great merchant marine. The great merohant
fleet we once usea to maim u rtuu, m
great body of sturdy sailors who used to
earrv our flaa into every sea, and who wer
the pride and often the bulwark of the
Nation, we nave aimon ariven out or ex
istence by Inexcusable neglect and indiffer
ence and by a hopelessly blind and pro
vincial policy of so-called economic protec
tion. It le high time we repaired our mis
take and resumed our commercial Inde
pendence on the seas,
For it Is a question of Independence. If
other nations go to war or seek to hamper
each other's commerce, our merchants, It
seems, are at their mercy, to do with as they
please. We must use their ships, and use
them as they determine. We have not ships
enough of our own. We cannot handle our
own commerce on the seas. Our Independ
ence is provincial, and is only on land and
within our own borders.. We are not likely
to be permitted to use even the ships of
other nations In rivalry ef their own trade,
and are without means to extend our com
merce even where the doors are wide open
and our goods are desired. Such a position
Is not to be endured. It Is of capital Impor
tance not only that the United States
should be Its own carrier on the seas and
enjoy the economlo independence which only
an adequate merchant marine would give It,
but also that the American hemisphere as a
whole ahould snjoy a like Indspendenoe and
seif-sufflency, If It Is not to be drawn
Into the tangle of Euronean affairs. With
out Such Independence the whole question
of our political unity and self-determination
Is -very seriously clouded and complicat
ed Indeed, i.
Moreover, we can develop no true or ef
fective Amrlcan policy without ships of our
own toot shipe of war, but ships of peace,
carrying goods and carrying much more:
creating friendships and rendering indis
pensable services to all Interest on this side
the, water. They must move constantly
hack and forth between the Americas. They
are tne only shuttles' that can weave the
delicate fabric of sympathy, comprehension,
confidence and mutual dependence in which
we wish to clothe ou,r policy of America for
Amerlcansj '.
The task of building uo an adeauate mer
chant marine for America private capital
must ultimately undertake and achieve, as
It has undertaken and achieved every other
like task amongst us in the past,- with ad
mirable enterprise, intelllirence and visor:
and It seems to me a manifest dictate of
wisdom that we should nromotlv remove
every legal obstacle that may Stand in the
way of this rauch-to-be-desirsd revival of
oar old independence and should facilitate
In every possible way the building, purchase,
and American registration of ships. But cap
ital cannot accomplish this great task of a
sudden It must embark upon It by degrees,
as the opportunities of trade develop. Some
thing must be done at once, done to open
routes and develop opportunities where they
are as yet undeveloped; done to open the ar
teries of trade where the currents have not
yet learned to run especially between the two
American continents, where they ars, sin
gularly enough, yet to be created and quick
ened; and It Is evident that only the Gov
ernment can undertake such beginnings and
assume the Initial financial risks. When the
risk has passed and private canlta! begins
to find Its way in sufficient abundance into
these new channels, the Government may
witnaraw.
' Ship Purchase Plan Declared Urgent.
With a view to meeting these pressing ne
cessities of our commerce and availing our
selves at the earnest possible moment of
the present unparalleled opportunity of link
ing the two Americas together In bonds of
mutual interest and service, an opportunity
which may never return again if we miss
It now. proposals will be made to the nres-
ent Congress for the purchase or construction
or ships to be owned and directed by tne
Government similar to those made to the last
Congress, but modified In some essential par
ticulars. 1 recommmena tnese proposals to
you for your prompt acceptance with the
more confidence because every month" that
has elapsed since the former proposals were
made has made the necessity for such action
more and more manifestly Imperative. That
need was then foreseen; it is now acutely
felt end everywhere realised by those lor
whom trade is waiting, but who can find no
conveyance for their goods, I am not so
much interested in the particulars of tne
programme as I am In taking immediate
advantage of the great opportunity which
awaits us if we win but act b tnis emer
gency. In this matter, as in all ethers, a
spirit of common counsel should prevail,
and out of It should come an early solution
oi tnis pressing prooiem.
There Is another matter which seems to
me to be very intimately associated with the
question of National safety and preparation
ror defense. Tnat is our poucy towaras tne

Our treatment of them and their attitude
towards us are manifestly of the first con

Justice to the people of Porto Rico were sub
mitted to the 63d Congress. They will be
submitted also to you. 1 need not particu
larize their details. Tou are most of you
already familiar with them. But I do rec
ommend them to your early adootion with
the sincere conviction that there are few
measures you could adopt which would uore
servlceably clear the way for the great poli
cies by which we wish to make good, now
and always, our right to lead In enterprises
of peace and good will and economic and po
litical rreeaom.
The plans for the armed forces of the
Nation which I have outlined and for the
general policy of adequate preparation tor
mobilisation and defense. Involve of course
very large additional expenditures of money
expenditures which will considerably ex
ceed tne estimatea revenues ot tne uovern-
ment. It Is made mv duty ,by law. when
ever the estimates of expenditure exceed the
estimates of revenue, to call the attention of
tne congress to tne fact ana suggest any
means of meeting the deficiency that It
may be wise or possible for me to suggest.
I am ready to believe that it would be my
duty to do so in any case; and I feel partic
ularly bound to speak of the matter -when It
appeari that the deficiency will arise directly
out of the adoDtlon by the Congress of meas
ures wnioti i myseir urge it to auopt. aiiow
me, therefore, to. speak briefly of the present
state of the Treasury and of the fiscal
problems which the next year will probably
ojsciose. , . . r-
. ' Additional Revenue Required.
On -the 30th of June last there was an
available balance In the general fund of the
treasury or. siu,i(u,iuo.(ti. Tne loiiu Ban
mated receipts fir the year 1918, on the as
sumption that the emergency revenue meas
ure passed by the last Congress will not be
extended beyond Its present limit, the 81st
of December, 1815, and that the present duty
of 1 cent per pound on sugar will be discon
tinued after the 1st of May, lt14, will be
1870,356,500. The balance of June last and
these estimated revenues come, therefore, to
a grand total of 1774,585,005.78. The total
estimated disbursements for the present fiscal
year, including f 2S.0O0.O00 for the Panama
Canal. $12,000,000 'or probable deficiency ap
propriations, and 50,000 for miscellaneous
debt redemptions, will be f 758,801,000; and
tne balance in tne general iuna or in
Treasury will be reduced to 120.844,665.78.
The emergency revenue act, if continued be-
yona us present, time rotation, wouia pro
duce, during the half year then remaining,
about 41.0OO,0O0. The duty of 1 cent per
pound of sugar. If continued, would produce
during the two montns ot tne fiscal year
remaining after the first ot May, about f 15,
000.000. These two sums, amounting to
gether to $56,000,000, if added to the reve
nues of the second half of the fiscal year,
would yield the Treasury at the end of the
year an available balance ot $70, 644, 005.78.
The additional revenues required to carry
out the programme of military nnd naval
preparation of which I have spoken, would,
as at present estimated, be for the fiscal year
1U1T, $1)3,800,000. These figures, taken with
the figures for the present fiscal year which
X have already given, disclose our financial
problem for the year 1017. Assuming that
the taxes imposed by the emergency revenue
act and the present duty on sugar are to be
discontinued, and that the balance at the
close of the present fiscal year will be only
$20,644,606.78, that the disbursements for
the Panama Canal will again be about $25,
000,000, and that the additional expenditures
fir the Army and Navy are authorized by the
Congress, the deficit in the general fund of
the Treasury on the SUth of June, 1917, -will
be nearly 236,000,000. To this sum at least
160,000,000 should be added to represent e
safe working balance for the Treasury, and
$12,000,000 to Include the usual deficiency
estimates In 1017; and these additions would
make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
the present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next, however
there would be a balance In the Treasury
of some $16,500,000 at the end of the present
fiscal year and a deficit at the end of the
next year of only some $50,000,000, or, reck
oning in $02,000,000 for deficiency appropria
tions and a safe Treasury balance at the end
of the year, a total deficit of some $112,
000,000. The obvious moral of the figures is
that it Is a plain counsel of prudence to con
tinue all of the present taxes or their equiv
alents, and confine ourselves to the problem
of providing $112,000,000 of new revenue
rather than $207,000,000.
, Internal Taxation Preferred to Bonds.
How shall we obtain the' new revenue7
We are frequently reminded that there are
many millions of bonds which the Treasury
Is authorized under existing law to sell to
reimburse the sums paid out of current reve
nues tor the construction of the Panama
Canal; and It le true that bonds to the
amount of approximately $222,000,000 are
now available for that purpose. Prior to 1818
$184,631, M0 of these bonds had actually been
sold to recoup the expenditures at the Isth
mus; and now constitute a considerable item
of the public debt But X, for one, do not
believe that the people of this country ap
prove of postponing the payment f tnelr
hills. Borrowing money is short-eigntea
finance. It can be juatinea oniy wnan iiw
manent things ars to be accomplished which
many .generations will cert Inly benefit by and
which It seems hardly fair that a single
generation should pay for. The objects we
ars now proposing to spend money for can
not be so classified, except In the sense that
everything wisely done may be said to-be
done in the interest of posterity as well- as
In our own. It seems to me a cleasWctate
of prudent statesmanship and frahk finance
that In what we are now, I hops, about to
undertake we should pay a ' we go. The
people of the country are entitled to know
Just what burdens of taxation they are to
carry and to know from the outset, now.
The new bills should be paid by In ternaj.. tax
ation. - V ,
To what sources, then, shalKiwe turn?
This Is so peculiarly a question which the
gentlemen of the House of Representatives
are expected under the Constitution to pro
pose an answer to that you will hardly ex
pect me to do more than discuss It In very
general terms. We ehould be following an
almost universal example of modern govern
ments if we were to draw the greater part
or even the whole of the revenues we need
from the income taxes. By somewhat loWrr
ing the present limits of exsmption anpytfts
figure at which the surtax shall boglfl.to be
imposed and by increasing, step ,. step
throughout the present graduation, the eur
tax itself, ths income taxes as at present
apportioned would yield sums sufficient to
balance the books of the Treasury at the end
of the fiscal year 1017 without anywhere
making the- burden unreasonably or op
pressively heavy. The precise reckoning
are fully and accurately set out in the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury which will
be Immediately laid before you.
And there ere many additional sources of
revenue which can Justly be resorted to
without hampering the Industries of the
country or putting any too great charge upon
Individual expenditure. A tax of 1 cent per
gallon on gasoline and naptha would yield,
at the present estimated production, $10,
000,000; a tax of 60 cents per horse power
on automobiles and Internal explosion en
gines, $16,000,000; a stamp tax on bank
rneouei probably $18,000,000; a tax of 26
MMs per ton on pig iron, $10,000,000; a tax
ot 26 cent- per ton on fabricated iron and
steel probably $10,000,000. In a country of
great Ktrlce like this 11 ; ought to be easy
to distribute the burdens of Ration without
making them anywhere bear too heavily or
too exclusively upon any one set .of JPWns
or undertakings. What is clear is that the
Industry of this generation should pay the
bills of this generation.

Wlreletg Amateurs.
There are now between 350,000 and
(00,000 purely amateur wireless sta
tions In the United States, according
to H. Oernsback, editor of the Elec
trical ExDerimenter. There are not
more than 15,000 such stations In all
the rest ot the world. And he goes
on to explain the value of these hun
dreds of thousands of amateurs, most
of whom are schoolboys, as follows:
The average amateur must needs
have a higher intelligence than his
card playing, dance hall resorting
classmate. - Indeed, when your aver
age radio amateur has mastered all
the intricacies of a wireless set, he
has obtained a pretty thorough knowl
edge of electricity in general. As a
rule most of our electrical industries,
big and little, require thoroughly prac
tical young men, the ones wno Know
how to do things. This is where the
amateur shines, and nine times out
of 10 he lands the job over the head
ot the untrained theoretical young
man."
the Children's museum of the
Brooklyn institute has undoubtedly
taught more boys the practical way to
become wireless operators than any
other one institution, and the best evi
dence of this is the thousands of
houses in Brooklyn that have wireless
apparatus on their roofs.
