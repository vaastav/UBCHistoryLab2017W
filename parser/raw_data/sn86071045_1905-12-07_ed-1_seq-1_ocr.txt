BUTLER, PA., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1005.
PRESIDENJSiVIESSAGE
President Roosevelt's annual message
has been delivered to congress. Open
ing wi'h a plea for the co-operation of
all classes in continuing the country's
prosperity and in correcting existing
evils, for a "square deal" for every
body. the message lii- t takes up the
question of corporations and railroad
rate legislation. The president says;
Corpora Hons.
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and any effort to prevent all combina
tion will be not only useless, but in the
end vicious, because of the contempt
for law which the failure to enforce
law inevitably produces. The corpora
tion has come to stay, just as the
trades union has come to stay. Each
can do and has done great good. Each
should be favored so long as it does
good. But each should be sharply
checked where it acts against law and
justice.
Experience has shown conclusively
that it is useless to try to get any ade
quate regulation and supervision of
these great eorp'Jwttioiis by state ac
tion. Such regulation and supervision
can only be effectively exercised by a
sovereign whose jurisdiction is coex
tensive with the tiell work of the cor
porations—that is, by the national gov
ernment. I believe that this regulation
and supervision can be obtained by the
enactment of law by the congress. If
this proves impossible, it will certainly
be necessary ultimately to confer in
fullest form such power upon the na
tional government by affirmative ac
ment of the constitution.
The laws of the congress and of the
several states hitherto, as passed upon
by the courts, have resulted more often
In showing that the states have no
power in the matter than that the na
tional government power; so that
there at present exists a very unfortu
nate condition of tilings, under which
these great corporations doing an In
terstate business occupy the position of
subjects without a sovereign, neither
any state government nor the national
government having effective control
over them. Our steady aim should be
by legislation, cautiously and carefully
undertaken, but resolutely persevered
in, to assert the sovereignty of the na
tional government by affirmative ac
tion.
This is only in form an Innovation.
In substance it is merely a restoration,
for from the earliest time such regula
tion of industrial activities has been
recognized in the action of the law
making bodies, and all that I propose
is to meet the changed conditions in
such manner as will prevent the com
monwealth abdicating the power it has
always possessed, not only in this coun
try, but also in England before and
since this country became a separate
nation.
Railroad Hate Legislation.
As I said in my message of Dec. 0
last, the immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
Is the enactment into law of some
6cheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged in inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent tho imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
Include putting a complete 6top to -re
bates iu every shape and form. This
power to regulate rates, like all similar
powers over the business world, should
be exercised with moderation, caution
and self restraint, but it should exist,
so that it can bo effectively exercised
when the need arises.
In my Judgment, the most important
provision which such law should con
tain is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought
before it whether a given rate pre
scribed by a railroad is reasonable and
just, and if It is found to be unreason
able and unjust then, after full investi
gation of the complaint, to prescribe
the limit of rate beyond which it shall
not be lawful to go—the maximum
reasonable rate, as it is commonly call
ed—this decision to go into effect with
ln a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review
by the courts.
It sometimes happens at present, not
that a rate is too high, but that a fa
vored shipper is given too low a rate.
In such case the commission would
}iave the right to fix this already estab
lished minimum rate as the maximum,
and it would need only one or two such
decisions by the commission to cure
railroad companies of the practice of
giving improper minimum rates. I call
your attention to the fact that my pro
posal is not to givo the commission
power to initiate or originate rates gen
erally, but to regulate a rate already
fixed or originated by the roads upon
complaint and after investigation. A
heavy penalty should bo exacted from
any corporation which fails to respect :
rm order of the commission. I regard
this power to establish a maximum :
rate as being essential to any scheme
of real reform in the matter of railway >
regulation.
It is worth while considering whether I
It would not be wise to confer on the
government the right of civil action
against tlio beneficiary of a rebate for
at least twice the value of the rebate.
This would help stop what is really
blackmail. Elevator allowances should ,
be stopped, for they have now grown 1
to such an extent that they are demor
alizing and are used as rebates.
Private Car Line*.
All private car lines, Industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should bo expressly put under the su
pervision of the interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate in Icing charges or in mileage or In
a division of the rate for refrigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. Only in
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected. A system
of examination of railroad accounts
should bo provided similar to that now
conducted into the national banks by
the bank examiners. A few lir.it class
railroad accountants, if they had prop
er direction and proper authority to in
spect books and papers, could accom
plish much in preventing willful viola
tions of the law;.
Employers' Liability Lin.
In my annual message to the Flftj •
eighth congress at its sec.mil session I
recommended the pas <a of an em
ployers' liability law for the lustriet of
t'olum|iia and in our navy yards. 1 re
newed that recommendation in my
message to the Fifty-eighth congress at
its second session and further suggest
ed the appointment of a commission to
make a comprehensive study of em
ployers' liability with a view to the en
actment of a wise and constitutional ,
law covering the subject, applicable to
all industries within the scope of the
federal power. I hope that such a law i
will be prepared and enacted as speed- I
iiy B3 possible. J
There has been demand for depriving
cufrts of the frower to issue injunctions
in Inlnir dtepMles. Such limita
tion of the equity powers of our courts
would be most unwise. It is true that
some judges have misused this power,
but this does not justify a denial of the
power any more than an improper ex
ercise of the power to call a strike by a
labor leader would justify Uie denial of
the right to strike. The remedy is to
regulate the procedure by requiring the
judge to give due notice to the adverse
parties before granting the writ, the
hearing to be ex parte if the adverse
party does not appear at the time and
place ordered. What is due notice must
depend upon the facts of the case. It
should not bo used as a pretext to per
mit violation of law or the jeopardiz
ing of life or property. Of course this
would not authorize the issuing of a
restraining order or Injunction ill any
case in which it is not already author
ized by existing law.
I renew the recommendation I made
in mv last annual message for an in
vestigation by the department of com
merce and labor of general labor condi
tions, especial attention to be paid to
the conditions of child labor and child
labor legislation in the several states.
Such an Investigation should take into
account the various problems with
which the question of ehild labor is
connected. In such a republic as ours
the one thing that we cannot afford to
neglect is the problem of turning out
decent citizens. The future of the na
tion depends upon the citizenship of
the generations to come. The children
of today are those who tomorrow will
shape the destiny of our land, and we
cannot afford to neglect them. The leg
islature of Colorado has recommended
that the national government provide
some general measure for the protec
tion from abuse of children and dumb
animals throughout the United States.
I lay the matter before you for what I
trust will be your favorable consider
ation.
As to Women Who Work.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough inves
tigation of the conditions of Women in
industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged In gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as it is vast and
complicated. The introduction of wo
men into industry is working change
and disturbance in the domestic and
social life of the natiou. The decrease
in marriage, and especially in the birth
rate, has been coincident with It. We
must face accomplished facts, and the
adjustment to factory conditions must
be made, but surely it can be made
with less friction and less harmful ef
fects on family life than is now the
case. This whole matter in reality
forms one of the greatest sociologicaj
phenomena of our time. It is a social
question of the first importance, of far
greater importance than any merely po
litical or economic question can be.
In any great labor disturbance not
only are employer aud employee inter
ested, but also a third party—the gen
eral public. Every considerable labor
difficulty in which interstate commerce
Is Involved should be investigated by
the government and tbe facts officially
reported to the public.
In.nraiict.
The great insurance companies afford
striking examples of corporations
whose business lias extended so far
beyond the jurisdiction of the states
which created them as to preclude
strict enforcement of supervision and
regulation by the parent states. In my
last annual message I recommended
"that the congress carefully consider
whether the power of the bureau of
lorporations cannot constitutionally be
extended to cover Interstate transac
tions in insurance." Recent events
have emphasized the importance of an
early and ( 'cbaustive consideration of
this question, to see whether it is not
possible to furnish better safeguards
than the several states have been ablo
to furnish against corruption of the
flagrant kind which been exposed.
It has been only too clearly shown
that certain of the men at the head of
these large corporations take but small
note of the ethical distinction between
honesty and dishonesty. They draw
the line only this side of what may be
called law honesty, the kind of honesty
necessary In order to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. Of course the
only complete remedy for this condi
tion must be found in an aroused pub
lic conscience, a higher sense of ethical
conduct In the community at large and
especially among business men and In
the great profession of the law, and in
the growth of a spirit which condemns
all dishonesty, whether in rich man or
In poor man, whether it takes the shape
of bribery or of blackmail. But much
can be done by legislation which is not
only drastic, but practical. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
interests of this country. The United
States should In this respect follow the
policy of other nations by providing
adequate national supervision of com
mercial interests which are clearly na
tional in character.
I repeat my previous recommenda
tion that the congress should consider
whether the federal government has
any power or owes any duty with re
spect to domestic transactions in in
surance of an Interstate character.
That state supervision has proved in
adequate is generally conceded.
The llevcimea.
There Is more need of stability thau
of the attempt to attain an Ideal per
fection lu the methods of raising rev
enue, and the shock and strain to the
business world certain to attend any
serious change In these methods ren
der such change inadvisable unless for
grave reason. It is not possible to lay
down any general rule by which to de
termine the moment when the reasons
for will outweigh the reasons against
such a change. No change can be
made on lines beneficial to or desired
by one section or one state only. There
must be something like a general agree
ment among the citizens of the several
states that the change Is needed and
desired lu the Interest of the people as a
whole, and there should then be a sin
cere, intelligent and disinterested ef
fort to make it in such shape as will
combine, so far as possible, the maxi
mum of good to the people «t large
with the minimum of necessary disre
gard for the special interests of locali
ties or classes, but in time-of peace
the revenue must, on the average,
taking a series of yaara together, equal
the expenditures or else the revenues
must bo Increased. Last year there
was a deficit. Unltss our expenditures
can be .kept within the revenues then
our revenue laws must be readjusted.
It Is impossible to outline what shape
such a readjustment should take, for
it is as yet too early to say whether
there will be need fcr it. It should bo
considered whether 't la not desirable
that the tariff laws should provide ior
applying as against or in favor of any
other nation maximum and minimum
tariff rates established by the congress,
so as to secure a certain reciprocity of
treatment between other nations and
onraAhraiL
Economy In Expenditure*.
I earnestly recommend to the cau-
CTe-is the need of economy and. to this
end. of a rigid scrutiny of appropria
tions. .All unnecessary office* should
be abolished. In the public printing
also a large saving of money can l>e
made. There is a constantly growing
tendency to publish masses of unim
portant information at which no human
being ever l.»oks.
Yet. In speaking of economy, I must
In nowise be understood as advocating
the false economy which is in the end
the worst extravagance. To cut down
in the navy would be a crime against
the nation. To fail to push forward all
work on the Panama canal would be
as great a f•Uy.
Cnrreney.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. The
evil does not consist In an inadequate
volume of money, but in the rigidity
of this volume, which does not respond
as it should to the varying needs of
communities and of seasons. Inflation
must bo avoided, but same provision
should be made that will insure a
larger volume of money during the fall
and winter months than In the less ac
tive seasons of the year, so that the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business. At present the
treasury department is at irregularly
recurring intervals obliged in the inter
est of the business world—that is, in
the interests of the American public—
to try to avert financial crises by pro
viding a remedy which should be pro
vided by congressional action.
Raiiuea. Methods In Department!.
At various times I have instituted in
vestigations Into the organization and
conduct of the business of the execu
tive departments. While none of these
Inquiries have yet progressed far
enough to warrant final conclusions,
they have already confirmed and em
phasized the general Impression that
the organization of the departments is
often faulty in principle and wasteful
in results, while many of their business
methods are antiquated and inefficient.
I recommend tiiat the congress consider
this subject.
Federal Elections.
In my last annual message I said:
"The power of the government to
protect the Integrity of the elections of
its own officials Is inherent aud has
been recognized and affirmed by re
peated declarations of the supreme
court. There is no enemy of free gov
ernment more dangerous and none so
insidious as the corruption of the elect
orate. No one defends or excuses cor
ruption, and it would seem to follow
that none w.juld oppose vigorous meas
ures to eradicate It. I recommend the
enactment of a law directed against
bribery and corruption in federal elec
tions. The details of such a law may
be safely left to the wise discretion of
the congress, but it should go as far as
under the constitution it is possible to
go and should include severe penalties
agajnst him who gives or receives a
bribe intended to influence his act or
opinion as an elector and provisions for
the publication not only of the expend
itures for ixminations and elections of
all candidates, but also of all contribu
tions received and expenditures made
by political committees."
I desire to repeat this recommenda
tion.
All contributions by corporations to
any political committee or for any po
litical purpose should be forbidden by
law, directors should not be permitted
to use stockholders' money for such
purposes, and, moreover, a prohibition
of this kind would be, as far as it
went, an,,effective method of stopping
the evils aimed at in corrupt practices
acts.
The Unique Conference.
The first conference of uations held
at The Hague In 1899, being unable to
dispose of all the business before it,
recommended the consideration and
Settlement of a number of important
questions bj* another conference to be
called subsequently and at an early
3ate, These questions were the follow
ing: (1) The rights and duties of neu
trals; (2) the limitation of (lie armed
forces on land and sea and of military
budgets; (3,» the use of new types and
calibers of military and naval guns; t£)
the inviolability of private property at
sea In Mines of war; (5) the bombard
ment of ports, cities and villages by na
val forces. In October, 1904, at the In
stance of the interparliamentary union,
I issued invitations to all the powers
signatory to The Hague convention to
send delegates to such a conference
and suggested that it be again held at
The Hague.
From all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled in some cases with
the condition that we should wait until
the end of the war then waging be
tween Russia and Japan. The emperor
of Russia, immediately after the treaty
of peace which so happily terminated
this war, In a note presented to the
president on Sept. 33 took the Initiative
in recommending that the conference
be now called. The United States gov
ernment in response expressed its cor
dial acquiescence and stated that it
would as a matter of course tako part
in the new conference and endeavor to
further its aima. We assume that all
civilized governments will support the
movement and that the conference is
now an assured fact. This government
will do everything in Its power to se
cure the success of the conference to
the end that substantial progress may
be ill the cause of International
peace, Justice aud good will.
Monroe Doctrine.
There are certain essential points
which must never be forgotten as re
gards (he Monroe doctrine. In the first
place, wo must us a nation make it ev
ident that we do not Intend to treat it
in any shape or way as an excuse for
aggrandizement on our part at the ex
pense of the republics to the Houtto.
But we must make it evident that we
do not intend to permit the Monroe doc
trine to l>e used by any nation on this
continent as a shield to protect it from
the consequences of its own misdeeds
ngainst foreign nations. The Monroe
doctrine does not force us to interfere
to prevent the punishment of a port
save to see that the punishment does
not assume the form of territorial occu
pation Ui auy shape. The case is more
tliihcult when it refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cer
tainly decline to go tu war to prevent a
foreign guyeriiment from collecting a
,'Us(; debt. On the other baud, it is
very inadvisable to permit any foreign
power to take possession, even tempo
rarily, of the custom houses of an
American republic in order to enforce
the payment of its obligations, fov »uch
temporary occupation turn into
a permanent occupation. The only es
cape from tbrso alternatives may at
any tiu'O bo ihat we must ourselves
undertake to bring about some arrange
ment by which 60 much as possible of
a just obligation shall be paid.
To do so insures the defaulting re
public from having to pay debts of an
improper character under duress, wivlio
it also insures honest creditors of the
republic from being passed by iu the
interest vf dishonest or grasping cred
itors. Moreover. foc.tlie Ualted
to fake such a position offers tlie only
possible way of Insuring us against a
clash with some foreign power. The
position is therefore in the interest of
I eace as well as In the interest of Jus
tice.
Santo Domingo.
Santo I >omiugo has now made an ap
l>eal to us. and not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous Instinct
within us, bids us respond to the ap
peal. The conditions in Santo I>omlngo
have for a number of years grown
from bad to worse until a year ago all
society was on the verge of dissolution,
fortunately just at this time a ruler
sprang up in Santo Domingo who. with
his colleagues, saw the dangers threat
ening their country and appealed to the
friendship of the only neighbor who
possessed the power and the will to
help them. There was Imminent dan
ger of foreign intervention. The pa
tience of foreign creditors had become
exhausted, and at least two foreign na
tions were on the point of Intervention
and were only prevented by the unoffi
cial assurance of this government that
it would itself strive to help Santo
Domingo in her hour of need.
Accordingly, the executive depart
ment of our government negotiated a
treaty tinder which we are trying to
help the Dominican people to straight
en out their finances. This treaty Is
pending before the senate. In the
meantime a temporary arrangement
has been made under which the Domin
ican government has appointed Amer
icans to all the Important positions la
the customs Bervlce, and they are see
ing to the honest collection of the rev
enues, turning over 45 per cent to the
government for running expenses and
putting the other 55 per cent Into a
safe depositary for equitable division
in case the treaty shall be ratified
among the various creditors, whether
European or American.
Under the course taken stability and
order and all the benefits of peace are
at last coining to Santo Domingo, dan
ger of foreign intervention has been
suspended, and there is at last a pros
pect that all creditors will get justice,
no more and no less. If the arrange
ment is terminated by the failure of
the treaty chaos will follow, and sooner
or later this government may be In
volved in serious difficulties with for
eign governments over the island or
else may be forced itself to intervene
in the Island in some unpleasant fash
ion.
Army and Xavjr.
I do not believe that any army in the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. Provision should
be made by sufficient appropriations
for maneuvers of a practical kind.
Provision should be made for the pro
motion of exceptionally meritorious
men over the heads of their comrades
and for the retirement of all men who
have reached a given age without get
ting beyond a given rank.
There should ba an increase in the
coast artillery force so that our coast
fortifications can be In some degree
adequately manned. There Is special
need for an Increase and reorganization
of the medical department of the army.
In both the army and navy there must
be the same thorough training for duty
in the stall corps as in the fighting line.
The importance of this was shown con
clusively in the Spanish-American and
the Russo-Japanese wars. The work
of the medical departments in the Jap
anese army and navy is especially
worthy of study.
Our navy must, relatively to the na
vies of other nations, always be of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and It
has now reaohed a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be maintained, but increased. It
does not seem to me necessary, how
ever, that the navy should, at least in
the immediate future, be Increased be
yond the present number of units.
What is now clearly necessary is to
substitute efficient for inefficient units
as the latter become worn out or as It
becomes apparent that they are use
less. Probably the result would be
attained by adding a single battleship
to our navy each year, the superseded
or outworn vessels being laid up or
broken up as they are thus replaced.
Naturalisation.
On this subject I recommend:
First.—A federal bureau of naturali
zation, to be established in the depart
ment of commerce and labor, to su
pervise the administration of the natu
ralization laws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom
plished.
Second.—Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third.—More exacting qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth.—The preliminary declaration
of Intention to be abolished and no
alien to be naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti
tion.
Fifth.—Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such state courts
as have jurisdiction In civil actions in
which the amount in controversy Is un
limited; in cities of over 100,000 inhab
itants the United States district courts
to have exclusive jurisdiction in the
naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
Criminal Laws.
In my last message I asked the at
tention of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to
the report of the attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to be no statute of the
United States which provides for the
punishment of a United States attor
ney or other officer of the government
who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement is other than one
possessing money value. This ought to
be remedied by appropriate legislation.
Legislation should also be enacted to
cover explicitly, unequivocally and be
yond question breach of trust in the
shape of prematurely divulging official
secrets by an officer or employee of the
United States and to provide a suitable
penalty therefor.
Merchant Marine.
To the spread of our trade In peace
and the defense of our flag in war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
is indispensable. We should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and in case of need to re-enforce our
battle line. It cannot but be a source
of regret and uneasiness to us that the
lines of communication with our sister
republics of South America should be
chiefly under foreign control. It Is not
a good tiling that American merchants
and manufacturers should have to send
iheir goods and letters to South Amer
ica via Europe if they wish security
and dispatch. Even on the Pacific,
where our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer
chant flag Is now through
No. 46.
the liberal aid bestowed by other gov
ernments on their own steam lines. 1
ask your earnest consideration of the
report with which the merchant ma
rine commission has followed Its long
and careful inquiry.
It is a matter of unmixed satisfac
tion once more to call attention to th#
i excellent work of the pension bureau,
for the veterans of the civil war have
a greater claim upon us than any other,
class of our citizens. To them first of
all among our people honor is due.
Immigration.
As I said in my last message to the
congress, we cannot hare too much
immigration of the right sort, and we
should have none whatever of the
wrong sort.
The questions arising In connection
with Chinese immigration stand by
themselves. The conditions in C-iina
are such that the entire Chinese cooly
class—that is, the class of Chinese la
borers, skilled and unskilled legiti
mately come under the head of unde
sirable immigrants to this country.
But in the effort to carry out the pol
icy of excluding Chinese laborers, Chi
nese coolies, grave injustice and »wrong
have been done by this nation to ihe
people of China and therefore ultimate
ly to this nation itself. Chinese stu
dents, business and professional men
of all kinds, not only merchants, but
bankers, doctors, manufacturers, pro-.
Jessors, travelers and the like, should *
be encouraged to come here and treat
ed on precisely the same footing that
we treat students, business men, trav
elers and the like of other nations.
As a people we have talked much of.
the open door in China, and we expect,
and quite rightly intend to insist upon,
justice being shown us by the Chinese,
But we cannot expect to receive equity,
unless we do equity.
The Civil Service.
Heads of executive departments and
members of the commission have call
ed my attention to the fact that the
rule requiring a filing of charges and
three days' notice before an employee
could be separated from the service for
inefficiency has served no good pur
pose whatever. Experience Baa shown
that the rule is wholly ineffective to
save any man if a superior for im-"
proper reasons-wishes to remove him
and is mischievous because It some
times serves to keep in the service In
competent men not guilty of specifier
wrongdoing. Having these facts In;
view, the rule has been amend*! by
providing that where the Inefficiency or,
incapacity comes within the personal
knowledge of the head of a department'
the removal may be made without no
tice, the reasons therefor being filed
and made a record of the department
The absolute right of removal r»st»
where it always has rested, with the
head of a department. The change la
merely one of procedure. It was ffruch"
needed, and It is producing gdOd re-'
suits.
Our copyright laws need revision.
Philippines and Other
During the laßt year the Philippine
Islands have been slowly
from the series of disasters which slncO
American occupation have greauy re-'
duced the amount of agricultural prod
ucts below what was produced In
ish times.
The agricultural conditions of th« Is
lands enforce more strongly than evet(
the argument in favor pf reducing the
tariff on the products of the Philippine
Islands entering the United States. I<
earnestly recommend that the tariff'
now Imposed by the Dlngley bill tu>on'
the products of the Philippine Islands' t
be entirely removed, except the tariff
on sugar and tobacco, and that tHat
tariff be reduced to 25 per cent Of the
present rates under the Dlngley fcet;
that after July 1, 1909, the tariff upon,'
tobacco and sugar produced to the
Philippine Islands be entirely removed
and that free trade between th® isWdsJ
and the United States In the product*
of each country then be protidea foe
by law.
In my judgment, Immediate steps
should be taken for the fortification of
Hawaii. This is the most Important
point in the Pacific to fortify In orler
to conserve the interests of this Coun
try. It would be hard to overstate the
Importance of this need. H&waU ifc too
heavily taxed. Laws should be enaot
ed setting aside for a period of,, say,
twenty years 75 per cent of the interns)
revenue and customs receipts from Ha
waii as a special fund to 6e expended
In tho Islands.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citteen* of
Porto Bico.
I wish also to call the attention of
the congress to tone question which af
fects our insular possessions generally
—namely, the need of an increased lib*
erallty In the treatment of ths Whole
franchise question in these Iwlftflfls.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given

admitted as one state.
The Panama Canal.
Active work In canal construction,
mainly preparatory, has been in prog
ress for less than a year and a tiulf.
During that period two points about
the canal have ceased to be open to
debate. First, the question Of route;
second, the question of feasibility. The
point which remains unsettled is Wheth
er the canal shall be one of several
locks above sea level or at sea level
with a single tide lock. On this point
I hope to lay before the congress at an
early day the findings of the adVlfry,
board of American and European en
gineers.
In addition to sanitating the Isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid
ed for employees and an adequate sys
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices has been cre
ated. Hospitals have been established
and equipped that are without Superi
ors of their kind anywhere. During
the past year a large portion of the
plant with which the work Is to be
done has been ordered. It is confident
ly believed that by the middle of the
approaching year a sufficient .propor
tion of this plant will have been In
stalled to enable us to resume the work
of excavation on a large scale.
What Is needed now and without de
lay is an appropriation by the congress
to meet tho current and accruing ex
penses of the commission. The first
appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the
$135,000,000 authorized by the fepooner,
act was made three years ego. It is
nearly exhausted. Unless the congress
nhall appropriate before that time ail
work must cease.
[ln conclusion the president recom
mends an increase in the diplomatic
and consular service and more ad
equate compensation of its members.]!
