Second Annual Convention, at
Oklahoma City,
AGAINST THE ROSE LAW
Next Legislature is Looked to
for Relief.
Oklahoma City, O. T., Dec. 7. (Special.)
The Oklahoma Bankers' Association met
m this city this afternoon in their second
annual convention, which -will be contin
ued over tomorrow. The bankers associ
ation is the outgrowth of the Rose bank
ins law, passed by the legilsature two
j ears ago. This law, as is usually the
case with fusion legislation, -was so replete
with imperfections and inconsistencies
that the backers in protection to their
own Interests and the interests of their
depositors, saw the necessity of concert
ed action and understanding on their part.
The preliminary meeting out of which was
formed the present association, met at El
Reno a year ago. There was a strong
feeling there manifested to test the consti
tutionality of the law in the courts before
lcndering compliance with its provisions,
but Attorney General Cunningham, who
was present throughout the sessions, ad
vised against such a course. He admitted
the ambiguous and Imperfect features of
the law, but suggested that the bankers
should do all in their power to obey the
law, in return for which he pledged his
efforts lo secure remedial legislation in
the next legislature. The truculent ele-J
ment was pacified by this conciliatory ad
vice and have Joined in giving a loyal
support to the new law in which they
were aided by the wise, conservative and
helpful policy of the present territorial
board, without which, it is conceded by
the bankers, much confusion would have
resulted.
Today's session of the convention was
taken up principally in hearing the re
ports of Secretary Otto A. Shuttee, of
El Reno; Treasurer John J. Gerlach, of
"Woodward; also the report of the exec-
urn o committee, of which D. W. jfar
f;uart, of Norman, is chairman. The ad
dress of welcome to the bankers was made
bv Oklahoma City's gifted mayor, J. P.
Allen, which, as usual, with him, was an
oratorical gem. The response was made
by Banker L. P. King of Waukomls. The
feature of the session was Pres. Sarch's
annual address.
Tonight the members of the association
-re the guests of the bankers and citi
zens of Oklahoma City at a performance
at tho opera house.
President Search's address follows:
PRESIDENT SEARCH'S ADDRESS.
oentlemen of the Oklahoma
Association:
Bankers
At our meeting at El Reno, twelve
months ago, an interest in the affairs in
which wo are engaged was manifested
fiat was commendable to our members
and encouraging to a further ciTort to
maintain a bankers' association, yb
which as is declared the general welfare
and usefulness of banks and banking
institutions might be promoted, and from
a personal acuaintanco and the disctib
tion of subjects pertaning to the banking
interests of the Territory, practical ben
efits might be derived.
The matter that then meroe particularly
Interested us all was the practical enforce
ment or non-enforcement of a then un
tried banking law. Those of you who
v ere present at that meeting will remem
ttr how diverse were tho opinions con
corning its application, and how as the
result of discussion an agreement was
r- ached and a resolution unanimously
adopted placing us in tho attitude of a
rrompt compliance with tho law and the
rules promulgated by the Banking Board.
A unity of action was displayed that
c uld only have been attained through
organization. The spirit manifested was
doubtless appreciated by tho board; much
Irss friction has resulted than was ap
prehended by many and experience has
proved tho wisdom of our action. Mutu
ally pleasant and helpful acuaintances
were formed that hae in many respects
been valuable.
To renew those acuaintances, to dis
cuss the various topics of interest that
may be introduced, to learn something, if
possible, and to impart knowledge if may
J'o, we havo again convened in another
annual assemblage as reuircd by our by
laws. A further retirement of those by
laws directs a stated programme to be
prepared; in meeting this reulrement it
has been necessary to choose individuals
to prepare papers on special subjects. I
trust these selections may not interfere
with such a friendly and general d'scus
sion as ought to and must prevail if we
would make our meeting protitable and
Fuccessful, your individual experience
ip ay be valuable to some one else, and the
information you can impart may lighten
tho burden of jour brother or assist him
hi the performance of some of tho often
deeply engrossed in his Hff5&i
in business, ready to go
ahead and carry out bound
less schemes of achieve
meat, and using up all his
trength and nervous force,
never pausing to think what
unseen danger may threaten
him Troin behind
Mighty few hard
working men ever
stop to realize that
feelings of weak-
ncss and sluggish
ness and incapacity
that overcome
them at times arc the forerunners of seri
ous disease.
More men would succeed in carrving out
their life purposes if they would put their
ronstitutions in strong, forceful, high con
dition, without waiting until disease has
plunged its axe into their vital organs. If
a man who is using up his working vitality
faster than his nutritive powers s-upply it,
will use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Disl
covery as an adjunct to his daily meals, it
will give the digestive organs power to
take hold of the food and extract from it
the elements which strengthen the vital
arganism and build up healthy blood.
It revitalizes every organ and tissue of
the body ; purges bilious poisons out of
the circulation ; invigorates the nerve cen
ters and the muscular system and makes
man altogether a man full of ambition,
energy and pluck.

THE EXCELLENCE OF SYRUP OF HGS
is due not only to the originality and
simplicity of the combination, but also
to the care and skill with which it is
manufactured by scientific processes
known to the California Fig Svrup
Co. only, and we wish to impress upon
all the importance of purchasing the
true and original remedy. As the
genuine Syrup of Figs is manufactured
by the California Fig Sritup Co.
only, a knowledge of that fact will
assist one in avoiding the worthless
imitations manufactured by other par
ties. The high standing of the Call.
fornia Fig Syrup Co. with the medi
cal profession, and the satisfaction
which the genuine Syrup of Figs has
given to millions of families, makes
the name of the Coxa pany a guaranty
of the excellence of its remedy. It is
far ic advance of all other laxatives,
as it acts on the kidneys, liver and
bowels without irritating or weaken
ing them, and it does not gripe nor
nauseate. In order to get its beneficial
effects, please remember the name of

complex and laborious duties Incident to
his vocation.
Events of more than national Import
ance have transpired since we last met.
"Without special preparation for war, nor
contemplating any immediate necessity
for ah unusual contingency our people
were confronted with a condition of af
fairs requiring calm consideration and the
wisest counsel that our dignity might be
maintained and the important questions
so suddenly and imperatively demand
ing solution be wisely considered.
That wo became involved in war was
rather tho result of a combination of cir
cumstances as remarkable as those which
continually presented themselves during
tho period of hostilities, and which so
miraculously led us out to a wider use
fulness as a nation and to a victory that
astonished the world. Old dogmas and
theories concerning territorial expansion
hitherto so reverentially regarded have
becomo matters of small moment com
pared to the newer problems, the consid
eration of which had not been antici
pated. Notwithstanding, our long, boasted su
periority as a nation, the achievements
so wonderfully wrought wero no more
surprising to others than to ourselves, not
only in conquest abroad, but in the re
quirements of tho occasion at home.
To prepare for so unexpected and unu
sual expenditure an experiment of of
fering to the public $200,000,000 of govern
ment bonds was made so that in every
respect it might be a- popular loan. Noted
financiers predicted failure, but to the
surprise of all, subscriptions were made
for several times the amount, more than
5100,000,000 of the loan went to 230,000 peo
ple, each of whom subscribed for 5500,
or less. "We are told that if the United
States had accepted in currency all tiie
j subscriptions made the treasury would
have absorbed seven-ninths of all ihe
money In circulation in the country and
that if the number of persons who sub
scribed for bonds were standing side by
side they would form a line one hundred
and twenty miles long. Almost every
occurrence has similarly illustrated how
little conception we had of our resources
and capabilities.
Disaster to monetary interests was pre
dicted and wo are astonished that since
hostilities were declared $165,000,000 have
been expended, or $l,000,0u0 per day in
addition to the ordinary expense of the
government and no disturbance in finan
cial circles lias resulted. On the con
trary, the gold rcserve(a matter of so
much general interest a few years ago)
and which we have learned to regard as
an indicator of public confidence, has, re
gardless of these unusual demands, in
creased $20,000,000 since April 3, 1S0S, at
which time the then high water mark had
been reached. Deposits in tho banks of
the country are greater than at Shy time
in its history. Our merchantable com
modities are more in domand abroad and
consequently our exports are larger than
ever before and all indications bespeak
continued national prosperity.
As a community Oklahoma rejoices with
the Nation, having reason to be grateful
for the opportunity to contribute her
share, not only by representatives enroll
ed in tho "Rough Riders" whose achieve
ments at San Juan He.ghts aro historical,
but in the shipment of wheat, corn, cot
ton, cattle and hogs that have gone to
help feed and clothe our armies.
Another bountNarvest has b?en gar
nered, tho returns from which add large
ly to the wealth of the Territory. "When
the people aro prosperous our business
prospers, notwithstanding the often re
peated assertion that the contrary is
true.
Without any material increase in bank
ing facilities th6 deposits in territorial
'junkb. as shown by the reports of the
bank examiner, were increased from $1.
4S0.149.0O, July 13, 1S07, to $2,550,436.13,
June 30, 1S3S, at which date the report
further states, that not a bank in the
Territory carried a re-discount. In addi
tion to this, the six national banks in
tho territory showed by their statements
Mav 5, 1S9S, an aggregate deposit of ?1,
(C7.$$)3.61, with the same showing of re
discounts as the territorial banks. Un
doubtedly as large a proportional in-
1 ease in business might be shown at
;h s time.
The settlement and subsequent igrowth
of our Territory has indeed Seen remark
et. le. us material prosperity ha exceeded
all expectations, tho events of its his
tory followed closely in the wake of the
boom days" and yet wo have inherited
Httle of its consequences. The panic of
198 only hastened the failure of Insti
tutions whose unbusinesslike methods
would, by a sower process, have accom
plished the same results.
The banks of our Territory give evi
dence by their periodically published
statements not only of a confidence im
posed, but a prosperity enjoyed by the
people that is truly encouraging.
As a fraternity, wo have kept pace
with the progress made In other voca
tions, and the nonor of the profession is
maintained by its representatives. Th-tt

ful 'discussion so important a subject de
manded, and is, therefore, necessarily
imperfect and in many ways conflicting
in its terms, and except for the sound
judgment and good sense of the Banking
Board, and a mutual desire on the part
of all parties interested to make the bast
of tho situation, much litigation might
have resulted. All these matters should
and will doubtless be remedied by our in
coming legislature.
The recommendations of this body, if
they be rea&onable and right, will have
much to do in the formation of an amend
ment more perfect and better adapted to
the wants of a growing community like
ours.
"With such remedies as further legisla
tion may apply, a patience that must go
hand in hand in the conduct of a safe
business, and a right treatment of pa
trons sure of appreciation, each individual
business will improve so that at our next
annual meeting we shall note a largely
increased aggregate, indicating the con
tinued thrift and prosperity of ur people
as a reward of industry and economy.
UOXDS rOK 1'UBLIC IJUICDENGS
Proposition to .Erect 8800,000 Worth.
in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City, O. T., Dec. 7. (Special.)
This city is greatly stirred up over a
proposition (emanating from Guthrie, of
course) to bond the territory for the sum
of $SOO,000 for the ostensible purpose of
erecting public buildings. Tho originator
of this daring plan is said to bo ex-Chief
Justice Frank Dale; at least he has sound
ed Oklahoma county's legislative repre
sentatives and sought to enlist their sup
port of the proposed measure. Judge Dale
is the owner of considerable land adjacent
to Oklahoma City and while there are a
few who incline to the belief that the bond
scheme is actuated by a political motive,
the general opinion is that it is merely an
effort to create a real estate boom. The
general features of the plan proposed by
Judge Dale is to bond the territory for
$500,000; $200,000 to be used in erecting a
capitol building in Guthrie; a $200,000 peni
tentiary at Oklahoma City; $200,000 for an
insane asylum; $100,000 for a deaf mute
school and $100,000 for a reformatory. The i
three last named institutions are not defi
nitely located, It will be noted, it being
a part of the plan to invite support from
EI Reno, Kingfisher, Perry, Enid, Paw
nee, Pond Creek, Shawnee, Chandler, Te
cumseh, Newkirk and other ambitious
towns of the territory.
Of course Judge Dale is lawyer enough
to know that there 13 a federal limitation
to the indebtedness of tlieterritory, which
he proposes to overcome by having the
legislature pass a bftl authorizing the is
suance of the bonds, tho principal and in
terest being guaranteed by the revenue
from sections 13 and C.1, and when this
much is accomplished Delegate Flynn is
expected to secure the necessary legisla
tion from congress legalizing the act.
A Race Against .Fire.
After a ten days' fight to avoid death,
the crew of a steamer from Spain recently
arrived in Baltimore. In mid-ocean it was
discovered that flames were raging in the
vessel's hold. For ten long days the crew
bravely fought the flames. If men would
fight as persistently against disorders of
the stomach and digestive organs, there
would be fewer premature deaths. The
best weapon for such a fight is Hostetter's
Stomach Bitters. It is tho greatest of
tonics, and the best of remedies for kid
ney, liver, bladder and blood disorders.
EVASION OF QUARANTINE
Is Guarded by the Oklahoma Quaran
tine Itonrrt.
Oklahoma City, O. T.v Dec. 7. (Special.)
The quarantine board t a special meet
ing at Stni water Monday adopted an order
enforcing the quarantine regulations
against the bringing into the territory of
cattle from Kansas and other points north
of the federal quarantine line. Thi3 step
was take nto prevent an evsalon of the
quarantine regulations by snipping cattle
from Texas to Kansas and then re-ship
ping to Oklahoma.

Record of Cases Disposed of at 1
Ilcno Since the Ke-Keconvenlne
El Reno, O. T., Dec. 7. (Special.) After
Judge Tarsnoy re-convened court the first
case tried was that af Delmas B. Bras
selton, a member of the hospital corps at
Fort Sill. Delmas was charged with sell
ing an inferior quality of whisky, put up
in one of Undo Sam's thirty-two ounce
vials, to three Indians. The jury turned
Delmas loose.
About twenty-five -wood cutters who
have been getting their fire wood an Ma
jor Billy Walker's preserves were arraign
ed. All pleaded not guilty. Judge Turs
ney asked -them if they had attorneys to
plead their cases, they all answered no.
None of them wanted ajury trial as the
judge was good enough for them.
Olivee Culp, Quin Fort and Fred and
Ike "Walters, who recently broke jail, were
arrested by a United States marshal In a
cotton field near Ryan, I. T. Sheriff Can
on went after them and returned them to
their old quarters in the county jail. Judge
Tarsney will pay his respects to the quar
tette sometime during tho week.
Ned Slsson, with his big six-shooter,
came up from the south on the 5 o'clock
Rock Island train last evening. Ned rush
ed into court like a whirlwind, but without
the notorious Bill Scribblns.
The time of the court was taken up the
whole of yesterday afternoon with a per
jury case. John Armstrong, a boy who
ought to be at home with his parents in
Iowa, swore that Roger Travis and John
Williams had committed an assault on
him. He afterwards swore that it was all
a He. The jury has not yet reported.
The trial of Bill Norvllle for the kiilinc
of Major Thomas is now going on.
Conrad Maas. a German farmer whose
home is six miles southwest of BrWtra

McKinley's Message Settles
the Annexation Question.
ATTITUDE OF FILIPINOS
Reported from Manila to be
Ail it Should Be.
New Tork, Dec 7. A special from Ha
vana says: President McKinley's message
has given the greatest satisfaction to the
Cubans, who look upon It as a definite
declaration of tho policy of trie United
States toward Cuba. Rafael Portuondo,
the president of the Cuban assembly,
said:
The message is most satisfactory to
Cuban aspirations and win have an excel
lent effect here. It proves beyond fur
ther caviling and dispute the honest in
tention of the United States toward Cuba.
1c will quiet many of our more violent
associates who have been talking loudly
about America and have been suspicious
of her intentions, and It will enable them,
like myself, who have believed and trust
ed in her, to co-operate more fully with
her officials in their work. It is a good
message, and fully satisfies us."
HAVANA PRESS DIVIDED.
Havana, Dec. 7. The Socal press shows
a sharp division on the comments on Pres
ident McKinley's message to congress.
El Pals and La Lucha find an anaolv
between the message and the joint resolu
tion of April last constituting in their
opinion, proof that the United States gov
ernment is "really determined to carry
out the promises solemnly contracted be
fore the world."
On the other hand El DIario de X-a Mar-
Ina .La Union Avisidor, El Comercio, La
Union Iberia, and El Leon Espanol see In
the message a veiled admlsion that the
president's policy is to occupy the island
for an indefinite period, with a view to
ultimately annexiug it. These papers
loudly denounce the passage in the mes
age which urges co-operation and assist
ance in every possible form for tho so
cial and moral reconstruction of the island
in order to enable the people of Cuba to
govern themselves.
The idea of qualifying the Cubans to
administer their own affairs is represent
ed by this section of the press as "an in
sulting warning."
A dispatch from Trinidad, province of
Santa Clara, announces the landing at
4 o'clock yesterday afternoon at CasiJda,

FIT FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT.
Kingston, Jam., Dec. 7. United States
Customs Commissioner Robert P. Porter
arrived here from Cuba yesterday on
board the Admiral Sampson and sailed for
homo today. He said his Investigation in
dicated the desirability of reciprocity be
tween Cuba and the United States in spite
of the Louisiana sugar and Florida tobac
co trade. The commissioner has framed
a Cuban tariff, market to all nations on
eaual terms.
Commissioner Porter considers the Cu
bans perfectly fit for self-government.
ATTITUDE OF FILIPINOS.
Manila, Dec. 7. The native press con
tinues to advocate independence and im-
bursement to tho United States govern
ment to be paid Spain for the Philippines.
The Independence thlnk3 this course the
only just one. It insists that the Filipinos
have aided the Americans solely because
they believed they were fighting for lnde
pendonc. Tho paper quotes liberally from
Prsldent McKinley's last speech In Chi
cago to support its contention that the
Americana are pledged to give the Filipin
os Independence.
Chief Aguinaldo and his principal advis
ers fully recognize the importance of a
strong protectorate in some form. One of
the latter has even ventured the assertion
that if the Filipinos were granted inde
pendence in accordance with the dmand of
th leaders, the United States would be
Immediately asked to establish a protec
torate, as otherwise the hlllppinea must
sooner or later become the prey of less
liberal-minded countries.
This statement is borne out by the at
titude of the better class of Filipinos in
tho vicinity of Manila. The numerous stor
ies as to hostility felt and displayed on
their part toward the Americans are with
out foundation. The United States author
ities expect on the part of the natives, a
peaceful acceptance of the inevitable.
MOW MADRID FEELS ABOUT IT.
London, Dec. 7. The Madrid corespond
ent of the Standard, who contrasts the in
difference of tho majority of Spaniards
to the president's mes-tago with the same
anxiety regarding bis declarations fore
shadowing war, says: "Only in political
and official circles is any interest hi the

TRANSPORTING TROOPS TO CUBA.
Washington, Dec 7. General Ludington,
quartermaster general of the army, has
received a telegram from Major Rollinger,
the quartermaster at Savannah, Ga., in
charge of the transportation of the
troops from that point to Cuba, as fol
lows: "The following are the arrangements;
First North Carolina, on the Michigan;
Second Illinois on the Roumania, and 161st
Indiana and Fourth Virginia, on the Mo
bile. Transportation of four regimental
headquarters with division hospital and
signal corps divided between the Michi
gan and Roumania. Division and brigade
headquarters on the Mobile. Will inspect
and report on her as a transport. General
Lee's corps headquarters on the Panama,
Doubt if you will gain anything by send
ing troops from here by way of Tampa
on the Florida and Whitney. It will take
both boats to carry one regiment. Time
taken in loading regiments here, unload
ing and loading at Tampa and unloading
at Havana will cause considerable delay.
Suggest shipping of freight, which might
delay unloading of transports at Ha
vana, by Florida and Whitney. Perhaps
this would bo cheaper and cause less de
lay than by returning ships from Ha
vana. General Lee's entire corps should
be transported direct from this point to
Havana (before the 20th Inst. Understand
from General Lee that authority has
been granted for landing troops at Ha
vana docks instead of at Marience."
TKEATS AMERICANS WHITE
Cnstellnnos is of a Very Different
Mortfrom OldJItlnnen.
Havana, Dec 3, via Key West, Fla.,
Dec 7. Tho official visit of General Wade,
as president of the Cuban evacuation
commission to Captain General Castella
nos, at the palace today was marked by
a display of official and military cour
tesy and honors fully in keeping with
the rank of the visiting officer and in
sharp contrast to the system -which pre
vailed under the regime of Captain Gen
oral Blanco whan these ceremonies wero
totally disregarded. During tho latters
term of office, visiting generals and ad
mirals of tho United States on reaching
the palace entrance were forced to elbow
their way through tho groups of lounging
soldiers always abounding about the pal
ace doors and court yard. Their exit
heretofore always had been as unceremo
nious as their entrance.
The reception accorded to General Wado
today, however, Tva3 a revelation In the
matter of official ceremony and Spanish
courtesy. At the conclusion of the inter
view General Castellanos in person de
scended the stairs with his vistior and
conducted him to -where his carriage was

ican general drove away. The palcej
guard, dnrwn up In double file, presented
arms as General "Wado and his party
passed through tho lines. The arrival of
tho Americans .had (been heralded ly a
bugle blast.
General Wade's visit was merly an offi-
call on tho new captain general and was
of brief duration. It -was required by
military etiqueme. The meeting of tic
two officers was of a most cordial na
ture and expressions of mutual regard
were exchanged. General Wade was ac
companied "by his entire staff.
A petition, purporting to repfcsent tJie
sentiments of 200,000 Spaniadrs remaining
in Cuba, and which is addressed to tho
queen regent, is published In the local
papers here. Asserting that tho accession
"of authority by the United States has
boon attended in Porto Rico by acts of
violence -which -may be repeated in Cuba,
the petitioners ask that the Spanish gov
ernment "demand witti firmness a solid
and responsible guarantee from the
United States," or "make n alliance
with some European power to Insure our
protection."

Tho Slarrte amendment win anfboris

T'e never did ; but we have

dandmff that it looked as if it
had been out in a regular snow
storm. No'need of this snowstorm.
As the summer sun would
melt the falling snow so will
melt these flakes of dandruff In
the scalp. It goes further than
this: it prevents their formation.
It has still other properties:
it will restore color to gray hair
in just ten times out of every
ten cases.
And it docs even more: it
feeds and nourishes the roots
of the hair. Thin hair becomes
thick hair; and short hair be
comes long hair.
