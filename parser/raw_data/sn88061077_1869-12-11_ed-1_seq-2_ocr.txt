The pulillo debt is represented in
great part by bonds having from five
to twenty and from' ten to forty
years to run, bearing . interest at the
rate of six per cent, and Ave percent,
respectively. It isoptloual with the
government to pay, these bouds at

Interest not exceeding J percent.,
and as rapidly, as the remainder be

It may bo necessary to authorize the
interest to be paid at either of three

OUR MANUFACTURING INTER FISTS.
Our manufactures are increasing
with wonderful rapidity under the
ciMtouragement which they now re
ceive. With tho improvements in
machinery already effected and still
increasing, causing macninery to
take tho place of skilled labor to a
larue extent, the Imjiortation of many
articles must mil oir largely within
very few years. Fortunately, too,
maniuactorics are not connnedtoas
few localit ies as formerly, and it is to
be Hoped they will Iss-onio ,inore dif
fused, making tno interest in them
equal In all sections, Thev a-ive em

iiiiuhi!iii.i to people at nomo, unit re
tain with us tlie means which other
wise would bo shipiied abroad.
Tho extension of railroads in Eu
rope and the Kast Is drawing into
competition wltli our agricultural
productions like products or other
countries. Self-hiterewL if not self-
preservation! therefore dictates cau
tion against disturbing any Indus
trial Interest of the country; it
teaches us also the necessity of look

our surplus. .

1 would respectfully call vourattea-
tlon to the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Interior for uniting
the duties or snpcrvwtng' the educa
tion of the freedmen with ,the other
duties devoloving upori the Commis
sioner of Education. It is tho desire
of Congress to make the census,
which must be taken during the year
1870, more complete and perfected
than heretofore. rvould suggest early
action upon' any plan that msv be
agreed, as Congress at the last session
appointed a committee' to take into
consideration such measures as might
oe deemed proper m rerercuce to the
census, and to report a plan. , I desist
from saying more. " ' ' . ,
I recommend to your favornlJi con
sideration the claims of the 'Agricul
tural bureau for liberal appropriation
In a country so diversified in a cli
mate and soil as ours, and with Apopu
lation so largely dependent Upon
agriculture. . Tlie benefits that can lie
eonrvrred by properly fostering tills
beureaii are .Incalculable. I desire re
spectfully tocalj theattentlou of Con
gress to tho Inadequate salaries of a
nunjber of the most important officers
of tbegovernment-in this message.
I will not enumerate them, but will
specify only the justices Of the Su
preme Court. 'No change has been
made iii their salaries -for fifteen
years, and since that time the labors
of the court have largely increased,
and the expenses of living have at
least doubled : during the same time
Congress has twice found it Uoossary
to increase largely the compensation ;
of Its, members, and the duties which
it owes to anotnur department de
serves, ond will undoubtedly receive
Its due consideration. . .
There are many suljects not alluded
to. .in this message, which might
With propriety be Introduced, but I
abstain, believing your patriotism
and statesmanship, will suggest the
topics and legislation most conducive
to the lutere-sts of tho.. whole people.

portunity to apply or enforce the.ni
or any others that I might entertain
on this subject,
The Supreme Court of the United
Stales.luw decided . that the Stale of
Tennessee is bound to receive - tlie
notes of the Bank of Tennessee for
taxes; hence the, necessity of mak
Inir some provision for their redemp
tion. As these' notes have generally
passed out Of to e hands or tlie people,
the oriidiiaf holders, and at very low
rates, and are now hcld'by specula-
tdrs-mostly pcrsoiisjljlugoutf the
State who pay 110 taxes here,..! am
In ravor or their redemption at the
l,ovest possible cost to the people.

State tax, provide that it may be dis-
nlinrmKl liv. thn lin viilnli t ill ITiilteil

one-hair the amount levied ; tnus
make it the interest of the tax-payers

Lands of the present .holders to be
taken up by the bank, from its debt
ors, In payment of debts due and In
train or collection, and ror real es
tate . now owned and .held by the
bank, which will absorb the larger
part or the circulation.
The amount Jiot redeeiued in one
of the ivavi suircrcsted. should be pro
vided for by an -leaner of the bonds of
the State at par. Under no circum
stances would I favor the sale of the
