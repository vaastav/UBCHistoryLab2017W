ernment dike upon which the resi
dents of the western part of this city
depend for flood protection gave way

sandy and the natural resistance will
be but slight. Where possible houses
are being rolled to places of safety
and others are being demolished.
Five dwelling houses and the ware
house of the Arkansas Packet com-'
pany were swept away and the greater
portion of the Cady Hardwood Mill
was destroyed. Barraque street for

stroyed. The Cotton Belt shops have been

WANTS ARMY FOR QUICK ACTIO
President Roosevelt Sends Special Message to
Cougress and Asks Prompt legislation
For Volunteer Army
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. An
emergency volunteer army measure
waa advocated yesterday by President
Roosevelt In a special message sent
to congress and the draft of the bill
accompanying the message was Intro-1
duced in the senate by Mr. Cullom.
The President says the bill is intended !
to replace the present law, which was I
placed on the statute books "piecemeal
and hurriedly, partly on the eve of j
the w-nr with Spain and partly after !
hostilities h 'd actually commenced " '
After declaring the present law to'
be faulty and wholly inadequate to a
speedy and proper organization of a
volunteer force, the President says the
bill proposed, which was drawn under
the supervision of the chief of staff
of the srmy, has the hearty approval
of the war department. The message
says further:
Price of Hen Fruit Goes !
Soaring Skyward!
Eggs are almost unobtainable at this
se.ison of the year, and from now un
til the first, of the year the farmer
who brings eggs to town can name his
own price. The fresh country variety
are now selling at 35 and 40 cents per
dozen and by Christmas 40 cents will
probably be the lowest price. This
is higher thn last year, when the
price did not' exceed 35 cents. Cold
storage eggs are also scarce and are
bringing $8.50 a crate, or 27 cents
a dozen.
Kansas City and several other large
cities are now threatened with an egg
famine, both the fresh and crated eggs
being exceedingly scarce, and al
though the conditions are not so alarm
ing here, the grocers are will
ing to pay fancy prices for the com
modity. -
JAIL BfiEM
THWARTED
Through the watchfulness of Jailer
Yeartu, who is always playing the
sleuth stunt, the plans of prisoners
la the county jail to attempt escape
were thwarted this morning. The Jail
birds had taken the springs from the
Boles of their shoes, making saws of
them, And were working at the scut
tle holes In their cells when detected.
The soft part of the steel had. yielded
to the treatment but the hard layer of
metal beneath proved a snag and the
Jailer got next and confiscated the
tools before any further progress had
been made.
BOILERMAKER INJURED.
J. A. I-ogan, a boilerni'ker at 404
Kansas avenue, got a particle of steel
in his eye yesterday morning, which
required medical assistance before It
was removed and left the eye In a bad
condition.
VANTS $5000
DAMAGE
The case of Walter Farrar versus
the Chickasha Cotton Oil company
went trial in the district court. The
plainiirr is sueing for $5,0no ior per
sonal injury.
Farrar, who was an employe of the
company, had his leg broken In Ap.'ll,
1!W, a heavy cake of oil meal falling
on him from a c.c which had been
loaded at the local mill.
WEATHER FORECAST.
For Chickasha and Vicinity: To-
night and Thursday fair; warmer.
"It Is designed to afford the com
plete machinery which, should we be
confronted with a foreign war, the
executive power could proceed at once
to transform entb.Uomal.lc aud patriotic
citizens into efficient and organized
soldiers. Happily there is at present
no cloud upon our horizon, but that
very fact affords us the chance to pro
ceed with deliberation and care In the
preparation of laws adequate and in
dispensable for our possible war
needs."
It is pointed out by the President
that the proposed measure would not
call for a dollar's expenditure during
ihe years of peace and its enactment
into law now "would merely be to
place at the disposal of the executive
power machinery whereby should war
threaten the means to wage it could be
swiftly brought into being."
Ambitious Statesmen
Visit the Capital
Guthrie, Okla.,' Dec. 9. Senator J.
C. Graham of Marietta, Representa
tive Bert Tillotson of Nowata, ex-Representative
Murdoch of Ralston all
arrived in Guthrie last evening: The
first Is a candidate for president pro
tern of the senate, Mr. Tillotson is a
candidate for speaker of the assem
bly, and Mr. Murdoch seeks to be
secretary of the senate. Each has a
following gained in the First, legisla
ture sufficient to make his respective
candidacy formidable to their friendly
antagonists. Senator' Graham was
also a member of the constitutional
convention and an Oklahoma legisla
tive body without the fiery topknot
of the Marietta leader would look
strange to those familiar with the
personnel of Oklahoma lawmakers.
The senator returned home this morn
fug, and Mr. Murdoch went to Okla
lahoma City at noon.
Want Appropriation
For National Park
Special lo The Express.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. A bill
will be Introduced at this session of
congress calling for an appropriation
of not less than $100,000 for the im
provement of Piatt Park, at Sulphur,
Okla. Every member of the Oklahoma
delegation will get behind this bill. It
will probably be Introduced by Mr,
Carter or Mr. Ferris.
DIED AT NINNEKAH.
G. W. Jameson of Ninnekah died !
yesterday at the age of 64. Funeral i
services were conducted this .afternoon j
by Rev. Anderson. The deceased Is
survived by his wife.
PROBE CANAL
SCANDAL
Roosevelt's letter Causes
N.Y. World To Demand
Investigation
New York, Dee. 8. The New York
World, to which Delaven Smith, ed
itor of the Indianapolis News, re
ferred in his reply to Roosevelt's at
tack upon him as authority for an ar
ticle on the Panama canal which ap
pealer In his paper, and called forth
the President's letter, says today iu
part :
"In view of Mr. Roosevelt's wi.i
hlatemenls of fact in his scandalous
personal attack upon Delaven Smith,
editor of the Indian-'polis News, the
World calls upthe congress of the
leit.id States to make Immediately
a full and Impartl.il investigation of
the entire Panama canal scandal. In
vestigation of 19u6 by the senate com
mittee of Inter-Oceanic canals was
blocked by the refusal of William
Nelson Cromwell to answer the most
pertinent question of Senator Morgan
of Alabama. Since that time nothing
has beon done, because after Senator
Morgan's death there waa no successor
to carry on his great work of revealing
the truth about Panama corruption."
Charles Zimmerman, a well known
farmer, six miles west of town, Is re
ported dangerously 111. He is the la
ther of Mrs. J. P. Wolverton.

itions to see If Law is
Violated
Guthrie, Okla., Dec. 9. Deposition
In the case of the state vs. the I. T.
Illuminating Oil company et al., filed

first, that of violating the state laws
with regard to the piping of gas; sec
ond, to ownlngro'ui estate contrary to
the constltutioaal clause prohibiting
corporations from acquiring land for
any other than actual operating pur- .
poses In Oklahoma; third, of monop
olizing the gas business of the state.
