of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington. Nov. 20.-Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and five
members of the House of Representa
tives. began here today an Inquiry into
the subject of public control atid
pervtston of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing or the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of thecoun
| try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee Is to look Into the ques
i tlon of government ownership of rail
ways. telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
The members of the eommittee
which will conduct this important in
S vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman: Senators liobinsoa
of Arkansas. Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Hrnndogoe of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia. Sims of Tennen sea,
Cullop of tudiami. Kseb of Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to Congress iu
ffl flDeccmher of last year. He described
as Its purpose to determine what could
-■ be done "for bettering the condition#
tinder which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole."
Prominent Men as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
Interests affected hy the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers, bank
era, representatives of commercial or
: fautzations. railway executives, econo
mists and others to up|>car before them.
Vs- The first to tie heard are railroad

commissioners of various states who
Their
began their evidence
' testimony is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of die federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by atate bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labor
organizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to tlie Increase
of governmental authority over wages
and conditions of labor.
V Chief Interest In die hearings cen
ters in the proposals that will lie put
forward by representatives of tue rail
roads. for it Is reported t liât they will
advocate an extension of federal au
thority over rates and securities to the
practical exclusion of state control of
these matters. It is understood also that
they will go on record iu favor of fed
eral IncoriKiratiou of all railroad Hues
Legislativ« Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source Is ob
* tabled the following on dine of the leg
lalatlve program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider iu
its investigation: They will endeavor
tF demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects in the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordination resulting from
tbo simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of Interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed in the hands of a federal
body so that interstate traffic may lie
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state oommisslons
Jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
pian, a compulsory system of federal
incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond Issues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
in order to enable the commission prop
erly .to exercise its Increased powers,
it is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases against the
XflB railroads shall tie delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may devote Its oner
gles to its administrative functions.
With the commission ihus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle Its business more prompt
I ly. the railroads will urge that the pe
I rlod during which the commission may
J now anspend proposed increases in
I rates be reduced from ten months to
(10 days, with provision for reparation
I to be paid to the shinters If the ad
vance shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also ask that the commis
sion be given tlie power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rate*
so that In meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which It consld
* era too low.
One of the most important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration Is
that the commission I«" specifically
authorised to take into account In
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total ..earnings in tlie light of ex

NEW POLICY NEEDED
IN GOVERNMENT
RAILWAY CONTROL
Helpfulness andEneouraKemsst
Urged by Alfred P. Thom.
CREDIT MUST BE IMPROVED I
I
Increasa of Transportation Facilitiaa
Necessary to Secure Relief From
High Cost of Living May Thus Be
Provided For by the Railroads.
Washington. Nov. 28.—A new policy
government railroad regulation,
on constructive principles of
helpfulness and encouragement instead
of upon principles of repression an<1
punishment, was urged by Alfred P. J
Thom, counsel for the Railway Execu- 1
tlves' Advisory Committee, the first
witness on behalf of the railroads be
fore tile Newlands Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce, which has Insti
tuted a genera) inquiry into .the prob
lems of railroad regulation.
"It Is proposed by the joint resolu
tion of Congress,' said Mr. Thom, "to
go into a comprehensive study of the
whole subject of transportation, to
nuiken new assessment, after 20 years
of experiment, of its history, its pres
ent conditions and its future needs.
Tlie railroads accept the view that reg
ulation is a permanent and enduring
part of government iu America and
that tlie first duty of the earri -rs is to
the public,
reasonable
of
based
.
That duty is to afford
facilities on reasonable t
terms and at reasonable rates, and this j
must he done before any private irter
ests can be considered."
Certainty, Safety and Sufficiency.
Mr. Tbom contended dial the real in
terest of tlie public is in being assured
of certainty, safety and sufficiency *>f
transportation facilities, rather than in
rates. The first consideration of the
public is to obtain transportation facili.
ties. Wliat the cost is. is iu reality a
second considérai ion. he said.
Mr. Thom proposed an increase of
transportation facili lies as a method
of securing relief from the high cost
of living. "There have been less than
1.000 miles of new railroad construct
ed in tlie United States during the past
year." he said, 'less than in any year
since 1848. except the period of the
Civil War. and yet the cost of living is
daily advancing owing to a shortage of
supplies which might lie remedied by
securing access to new areas of pro
duction.
Credit Must Ba Improved.
"This leads to the consideration as to
whether railroad credit is us good as
tiie public interest requires. It is tn
liosaibie for railroads to earn enough
to supply the necessary new facilities
from current revenue. They must be
provided from credit. Investors can
not l>e coerced, but must lie attracted."
Among the conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter investors he
mentioned the following:
"First. Railroad revenues are not
controlled by investor*, but are fixed
and limited by governmental authority
and not by one but by several govern
mental authorities, which do not recog
nize responsibility for assured results
.o Investors and are uncoordinated.
"Second. Railroads cannot control
and tlie government cannot and does
not »mit the expense account.
"Third, The present *ystem of regu- !
latlon is based on a policy of regulatio i
and correction and not on a policy of
helpfulness and encouragement.
"Fourth, The outstanding obligations
of the railroads have already exceeded
the financial rule of safety and involve !
a disproportionate amount of obliga
tions beariug fixed charges.
"Fifth. The investor must accept a
subordinate obligation or security with
no assurance of a surplus of enrnings
to support it.
"Sixth. Other competitive lines of in
vestment preseut superior attractions.
"Seventh, Tbe railroad business Is
largely controlled by (miittcal instead
of business considerations.
Look Forward, Not Back.
-We may debate about what has
caused tlie present conditions." said
Mr. Thom, "but we cannot debate about
what tlie people need. Tbe President
ha. taken ilie view that we u.ust look
forward iu this matter nod 'make a
fresh assessment of circumstances* in
order to ileal beipfuUy and inteliigent
wlth the prohictfl
no more prevalent in the railroad btisl- .
ness today than in any other business
humanely conducted. The givat ques
tion now Is whether tlie existing sys- '
tern of regulation gives the |uib|b- re
liable assurance of sufficient present
