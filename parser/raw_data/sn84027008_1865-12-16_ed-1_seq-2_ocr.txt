More Signs.
Wc published on Thursday some indica?
tions from Congress, that the radicals, on
?)bcr second thought, were cooling off from
their intemperate action on thu first two
days of the session. Wv: have further favor?
able indications in our Northern exchanges
received Thursday. Mr. Forney, writing
Trom Washington, to his piper, the Phila?
delphia Press, says " there is a conscious
?nd visible improvement in the political
prospect this fine winier morning," De?
cember 0. "Many things will conspire
to increase and extend this feeling. First
tornes th? happy accord between tho
-President and Congress, if not as to all
.ibo remedies, at least in the absolute duty
and necessity of a permanent adjustment
of national equalities. But equal even to
'Mun essential clement of future peace and
hartr.r.nw is the good temper among tho
heretofore -complaining Southerners. Tho
determination of Congress and tho
?ihoroughness of tho President havo evi?
dently convinced them that their only truo
vcourse is to agree to all the enumerated
conditions."
Again we lind the following in the open?
ing paragraph of a long editorial article in
?the"Now York Tribune, reviewing tho Presi?
dent's Message:
""No document discussing so many
diverse questions of grave moment and
seriously affecting so many vital in?
terests as the first annual message of
President Johnson, could reasonably be
-expected to accord ia every respect with
.ino convictions or prepossessions of a
majority of its readers; yet we doubt
.whether any former message has, on tho
"whole, contained so much that wiil bo
?generally and justly approved, with so
little that will or should provoke dissent,
lt is a State naper of signal ability and of
??unusual frankness, dealing unreservedly
-with every great question of internal or
international policy, and calculated to in?
crease the hold of its author on tho regard
and confidence of the American people."
-This from such a radical as Greeley, is
?oert???ly remarkable. Throughout his
comments, he is highly commendatory of
<the President's views, dissenting only to
?ais views on tho negro suffrage question'
.?.?ndeven on that point, he is not disposed to
""chop logic." There are other significant
items in tho Washington items, publish?
ed elsewhere in yesterday's paper. Above
-all, the despatch from thc President to Go
werfior Perry, which we published on Wed?
nesday, gives us groat encourageai ont to
?hope that Stevens, Sumner and their
Ifangs of ultra radical followers will quail
/ajid give way before thc statesman-like
views of the President and the conserva?

MESSES. EDITORS: NOV that politics aro
belan: par. perhaps the system of "mecha?
nics as a science" will have a showing.
Politicians never yet pave real strength to
any country-the mechanic always has and
ever will do so. Nothing more than thc
genius of mechanics, as developed at thc
North, contributed to the overthrow of tho
Southern Confederacy, (except,-indeed, thc
corruption of sonic of our own officials;)
but a new ora has commenced in the South .
-cotton is no longer king, although a most
useful servant, and tho whole resources of
our wonderfully rich country can now be
developed, which must bc dono principally
by tita mechanic. Lot us of thc South take
hold of the matter with enerby. Energy
is, in fact, almost our only capital; but that
we possess, or can, if wo will, und let all
recollect that energy is superior to gold -
and can make it. This is not tho foolish
chimera followed so long by the alchemists
of old, and in vain; but is a reality, which
never fails its determined follower.
Wc have even now in Columbia men
whose profession is thc study and develop?
ment of "scientific mechanics," and wc
have operatives of ability second lo thoso
of nc) other Southern city. Let thom or?
ganize and form a "Mechanic's Institute,"
where each, man will impart instruction to
his fellow upon some subject on which he
may be peculiarly qualified, where thc
standing of the mechanic as a citizen will
be shown in its true light, proving to tho
younger members that their first duty is
obedience to order, and that, being useful
human beings, they therefore hold a -moro
honorable position in society than thoso
drones of th?? community who rxist only
for themselves, but yet protend to call
themselves members of tho body politic.
Heretofore, in our section, everything
has boen subservient to agriculture; or
rather, I should say, to tho very imperfect
cultivation of cotton* To bi a planter, no
matter on how small a scale, was > be a
gentleman, and a mechanic was not looked
upon a3 such. Without disparagement to
tho cotton planter, a mechanic can also be
a gentleman, and ho can also bo even a
moro usfful member of society titan thc
planter. Let the young men of the South
think of this, and let them recollect that
only by the proper encouragement of tho
differe nt branches of the mechanical arts,
can our couutry bo raised to that prosper?
ous and eminent position to which it is
entitled. In this good work, let Columbians
take the lead.
Barbarously sacked, devastated and im?
poverished as our homo is now, our city
was always worthy, and is still capable of,
doing so-the materia! is here for tho
foundation, and let us welcome, no -.natter
from whence hi- comos, every true man
who will aid in tho superstructure. Now
is the time to commence. Let us have a
"Mechanic's Institute," organized on tho
principle <>f tho European gui!.ls, in which
! he eliler .-eld more experienced members
will lill thc prominent positions, giving in?
struction to the younger and less experi?
enced, each in his own department; not
pr. ve!.ling the noviciate, however, from
presenting his views, if he is found com?
petent t ) discuss the importance of the
subject, and where thc interest of scientific
industry will be properly and fairly cared
Do n..t suppose, Messrs. Editors, that I
wish lo disparage, in the least degree, agri
cull ural or commercial pursuits, far from it ;
they are necessary to the prosperity of
every country. 1 merely wish to show,
that, for the good of thc country, tho
science-of mechanics is just as necessary,
or more essential, perhaps, than tho mero
products of the soil, which are in most in
stanees virtually consumed* or exported to
foreign paris. SPES.

Tile President'? Interpretation of thc
Monroe Doctrine.
There ia no question that the words of
the President on foreign aggressions upon
this continent in thc interests of monarchy,
have great significance.
There is no threat in them lo wound the
most sensitive French honor, but there is
I a very plain statement of the feeling and
conviction of tito nation. We have con?
sistently and carefully refrained from pro?
pagating republicanism in Europe by any
other Cuan moral means, and we expect a
like moderation from European powers in
regard to propagating monarchy in Ame?
rica. But, sass thc President, with the
tone becoming a discussion on so impoi -
tant a question, "'We should regard it as a
great calamity to ourselves, to thecauso of
good government, and to the peace of the
world, should any European power chal?
lenge the American people, as it were, to
thc defence of republicanism against for?
eign interference. We cannot foresee, and
arc unwilling t > consider, what opportu?
nities might present thcmelves, what com?
binations might offer, to protect ourselves
against designs inimical to our form of
government. The United States desire to
act in the future aa they have ever acted
here! fore; thej never will be driven from
that course bnt by the aggression of Euro?
pean {lower. ; c i I we rely on the wisdom
and justice of tho^o powers to respect the
system of non interference which has so
l.mg been sanctioned by time, and whmh,
by iis good result'', has approved itself to
bo? h continents.'
This language precisely reflects the feed?
ing of thc natio i on this question. They
would regard a war with Franco as a great
calamity, both to this country and to tho
world; they are disposed to proceed with
the utmost mod?rai ion; still thev could
never do otherwise than ci riskier tho
French establishment by iorco of a nio
narcy in Mexico as "... challenge to tho
I defence of republicanism against foreign
I interference." A martial nation like tho
I French will understand our feelings by
imagining what thc sentiments of the first
French Republic would have been if Ger?
many had forced a monarchy on Switzer?
land; or still nearer, what the feelings of
tho present Government would be if the
Republicans of Europe, in combination
with tho b nit. d States, had founded a Re?
public on the Rhine, existing only.by Vine
rican aid.
A foreign monarchy forced on a sister
republic, is a standing "challenge" ko the
United States. As a mero matter of in?
terest, there would be no great motive to
object to Maximilian's kingdom. We
should nndenbtedly carry on as much
trade .vit li a Pre?en monarchical Mexico
as with a native republican Mexico. No
monarchy could ever weaken our repub?
lican influence on this continent. Wo nave
nothing to fear from a French Mexico.
100,000 French bayonets in that kingdom
would bo as nothing to thc force we could
hiing into the field. Moreover, tho barren
plains between Texas and tho fertile parts
of Mexico would be a sufficient protection
against a foreign power in that country,
while on the sea no European powcrwould
have anything like the force and advan?
tages we should necessarily possess.
A French monarchy in Mexico is no real
source of danger tous. Neither does tho
United States desire the possession or
absorption of Mexico. It would bea great
misfortune to this country to incorporate
her in the Union, even if her people wero
willing. Those half-breeds and miserable
mixtures of Indians and negroes and
whites would never ho suited to our insti
(tutionsor civilization. There is no hope
or wish among our peoplu to annext Mexi?
co. Still, notwithstanding all this, thc
setting up of a monarchy on tho ruins of
a republic, on this continent, and the time I
and mode chosen" for thia act of aggres
sion, cannot bat he always felt as an insult ?
by tho masses of our people. They see
and watch the grand struggle in Europe
between democracy and imperialism or
aristocracy.
They know that the Emperor Napoleon
is, by choice, both in literature and the
more earnest world of fact, tho great de?
fender of imperialism in Europe. They
must consider titi? invasion cf the Ameri?
can continent as a coming out of his way
to throw down ii:- gauntlet to republi?
canism in Amt rica. They consider it a
?)lain declaration of war -not of nations,
mt of principles-made on this side of thc
ocean, by the great representative of ar?
bitrary power from the other. Moreover,
th^y know nat where this is to end. An
interference in Mexico to found a monarchy I
may justify an interference somewhere
else, to found a dependency of a European
Stat? on the ruins of some republic. Our
own Southern States might not be out of
all danmor of a foreign ''establishment of
0.-i'?.\" This popular sentiment is ex?
pressed by the President; but evidently
with the hope, shared by al! the people,
that the French Emperor, seeing the
hopelessness of forcing a throne on tho j
Mexicans, withdraw his forces and leave
Maximilian to his fate.
Still, tho earnest words succeeding show :
that the President does not propose to j
wait as long or as patiently aa Italy has j
done for the withdrawal of the French
troops from Home. No indefinite Algerian '
occupation will be permitted here. The '
President evidently hints at "combina- j
tions" and "opportunities" which we should i
employ in our defence, that would bc most
perilous to imperialism in Europe. He I
will not allow himself to "foresee" or j
"consider" them, but we know well that j
tho United States always lias an ally in
Europe, ai d that democracy, though
crushed there, is by no means dead. There
arc invasions in the interest of liberty, as
well as of imperialism, and thrones may
bc overturned as well as erected.
Tho President ?lees not permit himself
to ''consider" this, lint tho people can.
Perhaps the President ?loes uot allow him- :
self to "foresee" what a rival to the |
French throne might do tm the French |
coast, with an American navy to back him.
We, however, of the people, may be per- j
mitted to consider all these possible com- !
binations in the last dreaded issue.
Let us hope that the serious and respect?
ful words of the President may be carefully j
weighed by so intelligent a ruler as the ?
French Emperor, and a struggle avoided,
which, as Mr. Johnson says, would bc "a
calamity to this country and tho world."
