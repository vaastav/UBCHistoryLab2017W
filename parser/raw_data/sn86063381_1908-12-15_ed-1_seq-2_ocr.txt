STATE PARK "HAVEN OF FORESTRY.
Todd County Argus- Two years
ago a bill was slipped through the
legislature turning over the control
of Itasca park to the Forestry com
mission. As soon as the commis
sion secured control it decided to use
the hotel, built to entertain summer
tourists, as a forestry school and
some twenty-five students have been
up there all the summer. Itasca
park is a beautiful summer resort and
the people in this part of the state
object to having it turned into a
school for twenty or twenty-five
students who could study forestry in
some other place as well.
Properly managed the park
could be made a resort that will
attract thousands of tourists dur
ing the summer. The mainten
ance of such a resort would be
of great value to the people in
that section in a financial way and
would be a good advertisement for
the state as well. Friction between
the commission and R. A. Arnold,
the park commissioner, has resulted
in the resignation of the latter.

SENDS MESSAGETOSENATE
In Transmitting Report of War De-
partment on Brownsville Affair the
President Briefly Comments on Re-
sult of Investigation and Makes Rec-
ommendations for Reinstatement of
Some of the Men.
Washington, Dec. 15.In transmit
ting the war department's report on
the Brownsville affair to the senate
President Roosevelt accompanied the
document with a brief message on the
subject. After the reading of the
president's message had been con
cluded the cierk read all of the state
ments and other evidence submitted
to the war department, for which the
president's message was merely a
letter of transmittal. This is contrary
to the usual course. The message fol
lows To the Senate:
I enclose heiewith a letter from the
secretary of war transmitting a report
of the investigation made by Mr. Her
bert J. Browne, employed by the de
partment in conjunction with Captain
W. G. Baldwin to investigate as far
as possible what happened at Browns
ville on the 13th and 14th of August,
1906. The report and documents con
tain some information of great value
and some statements that are obvi
ously worthless, but I submit them in
their entirety.
This report enables us to fix with
tolerable definiteness at least some of
the criminals who took the lead
the murderous shooting of private
citizens at Brownsville. It establishes
clearly the fact that the colored sol
diers did the shooting but upon this
point further record was unnecessary,
as the fact that the colored soldiers
did the shooting has already been
established beyond all possibility of
doubt. The investigation has not
gone far enough to enable us to de
termine all the facts and we will pro
ceed with it but it has gone far
enough to determine with sufficient
accuracy certain facts of enough im
portance to make it advisable that I
place the report before you.
Has No Doubt of Their Guilt.
It appears that almost all the mem
bers of Company must have been
actively concerned in the shooting,
either to the extent of being partici
pants or to the extent of virtually en
couraging those who were partici
pants. As to Companies and
there can be no question that prac
tically every man in them must have
had knowledge that the shooting was
done by some of the soldiers of
troop and possibly by one or two oth
ers in one of the other troops. This
concealment was itself a grave of
fense, which was greatly aggravated
by their testifying before the senate
committee that they were ignorant of
what they must have known. Never
theless, it is to be said in partial ex
tenuation that they Were probably
cowed by threats, made by the more
desperate of the men who had actually
been engaged in the shooting, as to
what would happen to any man who
failed to protect the wrongdoers
Moreover, there are circumstances
tending to show that these misguided
men were encouraged by outsiders to
persist in their course of concealment
and denial I feel, therefore, that the
guilt of the men who, after the event,
thus shielded the perpetrators of the
wrong by refusing to tell the truth
i though serious, was in
jf-aif d'iO the unwise and improper
arntt d oi others and that some
nvasiuo o[ llowance should be made
fci thp misr mduct.
Coirlit'oirords,
of Reinstatement.
I believe we can
1 i 'istate any of these men
"i wilfully tell what has hap
pened, give all the aid they can to
fix the responsibility upon those who
are really guilty and show that they
themselves had no guilty knowledge
beforehand and were in no way impli
cated the affair, save by having
knowledge of it afterwards and fail
ing and refusing to divulge it. Under
the circumstances, and in view of the
length of time they have been out of
the service and their loss of the ben
efit that would have accrued to them
by continuous long time service, we
can afford to treat the men who meet
the requirements given above as hav
ing been sufficiently punished by the
consequences they brought upon
themselves when they rendered nec
essary the exercise of the disciplinary
power. I recommend that a law be
passed allowing the secretary of war,
withm a fixed period of June,, say,
DEFECTIVE PAGE
year, to reinstate "any"*"of these ~30ij
diers whom he, after careful examine*
tion, finds to have been innocent and
whom he finds to have done all in his
power -to help bring justice to the
guilty.
Meanwhile the investigation will b
continued. The results have made it
that only by carrying on the
Investigation as the war department
has actually carried it on is there
the slightest chance of bringing the
offenders to justice or of separating
not the innocent, for there were doubt
less hardly any innocent, bat the less
guilty from those whose guilt was
heinous.

CAMPAIGN FOR A
"CLEANER PRESS"
Movement Has Backing of Prom
inent New Yorkers.
New York, Dec. 15.With the start
of the Hains trial at Flushing, L. I.,
a campaign for a "cleaner press' has
been inaugurated in New York with
the hope of inducing newspapers to
eliminate from their columns anything
that might be suggestive or offensive.
The move has been started by an
open letter of three prominent men
who declare that they have the sup
port of Archbishop Farley, Bishop
Greer, Jacob H. Schiff, the banker
and financier, Robert W. de Forest
and others. The co-operation of tlio
public is invited and while there is no
desire, it is said, to "censor" the news
it is believed that a campaign along
proper lines will be effective. The
letter, after deploring the publication
of "libidinous details of criminality,"
with special reference to the Thaw
case, says:
"It is believed by good authorities
that a respectful protest presented
early enough to the press by men of
serious character, representing heavy
responsibilities in the care of their
own children or children confided to
them by the duties of their positions
in life, will meet with an immediate
and sympathetic response, resulting
in such careful editing of this and
similar news matter that no harm
shall be done to the reading com
munity by indecently offensive sug
gestion."

SEIZURE OF SHIPP

Holland Explains Action in
Venezuelan Waters.
OFFICIAL NOTE IS ISSUED
Capture of Guardship a Protest
Against the Personal Rule of Pres-
ident Castro and in Order to Guar-
antee Itself Against a Renewal of
Former Molestations of Dutch Ves-
sels by Venezuela.
The Hague, Dec. 15.The govern
ment of The Netherlands is satisfied
that it was quite within its rights,
from the standpoint of international
law, in seizing the Venezuelan coast
guardship Alix off Puerto Cabello.
The Alix was suspected of carrying
munitions of war from one Venezu
elan port to another. Similar reprisals
will be taken whenever and_wherever
possible.
The government has issued an offi
cial statement in connection with the
seizure of the Alix, in which it sets
forth that it is taking action against
the personal rule of President Castro
in order to guarantee itself against a
renewal of former molestations of
Dutch vessels, this being a point con
cerning which Castro refused to give
any assurances.
WITHOUT FIRING A SHOT
Dutch Cruiser Captures Venezuelan
Guardship.
Willemstad, Island of Curacao, Dec.
15.The following detailed story of
the capture of the Venezuelan coast
guardship Alix by the Dutch cruiser
Gelderland was obtained from an offi
cer of the cruiser:
The Gelderland was steaming slow
ly a short distance off the fort at
Puerto Cabello. She noticed the Alix
coming in and after taking up a posi
tion that prevented the passage of
the smaller boat she ordered her to
stop and sent off a boat to search the
Venezuelan vessel. It was discovered
that the captain of the Alix had hid
den his Venezuelan pennant in his
pocket and he pretended that his ves
sel was a merchant steamer. A pas
senger on board the Alix, however,
declared to the Dutch officers that
the Ah\ was a coastguard vessel A
search was then made. The flag was
found in the captain's pocket and six
rifles and a small quantity of ammuni
tion also were discovered. The rifles
were in bad condition.
The crew of the Alix were given
their choice of coming to Curacao or
going ashore at Puerto Cabello. They
preferred the latter course, embarked
in one of their own boats and pulled
into the harbor.
The Venezuelan gunboat Restaura
dor was at Puerto Cabello and the
officers of the Gelderland could see
her getting up steam. Smoke was
pouring from her funnels. The Gel
derland stayed outside Puerto Cabello
for several hours waiting to see if the
Restaurador would come out, but she
did not venture forth.
The Gelderland manned the Alix
with an officer and several marines
and towed her into Curacao. She is
now anchored in the inner bay.
NOTE TO DIPLOMATIC CORPS
Venezuela Protests Against Action of
Dutch Warships.
Caracas, Venezuela, Dec. 15.For-
eign Minister Paul has sent a note to
the members of the diplomatic corps
here protesting against the "repeated
violations of the territorial rights of
Venezuela" by the three Dutch war
ships that have been cruising in Ven
ezuelan waters since Dec. 2. No
blockade has been declared, he sets
forth, and the continual interference
with the coastwise shipping is having
a detrimental effect upon the com
merce of neutral powers. In conclu
sion the foreign minister says:
"Venezuela protests with energy
against these aggressions upon the
territorial sovereignty of the republic
and she holds Holland responsible for
all the consequences."
Holland Keeps Plans Secret.
Washington, Dec 15.Holland's ul
timate forcible designs against Ven
ezuela, if she has finally determined
on them, the initial steps of which
appear to have been the seizure of a
coast guardship, are still a mystery
to the state department, as that gov
ernment has not yet seen fit to make
the United States acquainted with
Ihem. Holland apparently has mapped
its course alone, avoiding any act that
might give cause for complaint from
any of the powers having interests in
Venezuela or interfering with vested
rights there.
Primary Law Constitutional.
