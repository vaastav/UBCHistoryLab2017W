San Francisco, Dec. 9. Not only
will a uewr air route be blazed across
the JHaciric oceai the last remaining
great body of water to be traverser.
iy air but also a new trail across tb
Atlantic may be established, by (Sir
Keith tmith, noted British aviator, in
his proposed flight around the worlc
next year.
His flight, if successful, will be the
first xound-the-wurid flying tour and
tile first ir flight across the Pacific
. ocean. He is investigating the feasl
illty of crossing; the Atlantic via Lab
lador, Greenland and Iceland. At
lantic flights havt previously been
made direct to Ireland from New
foundland and via the Azores to
Portugal. If conditions being; invest!
Fated prove favorable, the new route
will be attempted by sir Keith in con
eluding his world air tour.
The globe-trotting aviator, who has
& heroic war record, was In San
Francisco today making final arrange
ments for petrol supply depots in the
Aleutian Islands and Alaska.
In Kiglit Jumps.
Tha Pacific flight will be made in
eight jumps, rroiti Petropavlosk. on
the Kamchatka peninsula to Van
couver via Alaska his plane will fly
over a practically uninhabited country
Sir Keith, expects to traverse the
Fiooe oy air in auu Hying nours. in;
actual time elapsed from the start
from England, the third week of
-April, until the return to England
expected to be about three months
The distance over the- route he has
laid out is between 22.00U and 23. Out
mites.
The Vickers amphibian plane
which will be used on the flisht. wi.!
have a cruising speed of ninety miles
an hour. The machine will carry a
s''ndinc and directional wireless set
This will permit asking for relief in
event of accident and also the collec
tion of weather information from
fchips along the water route.
After leavins Japan, practically all
landings will be made on water. The
amphibian type of plane doubles tht
number of landing places over those
that were available when Sir Keith
and his brother, the late 'Sir Ross
Smith, negotiated their flipht to Aus
tralia. It is practical to descend on
water for repairs.
Three to Make Flight.
Sir Keith, another officer and a
mechanician, will make up the crew
for the long: flight. The rout will
be the same as followed on the Aus
tralian trip as far as Siam over
France. Italy. Greece, Egypt, India
and Ham. From Siam the flyers will
rroceta to saigon. rrfnctl Indoo
China, Hong Kong and Shanghai,
China: Tokio. Japan; Kuril Islands.
Kamchatka, Aleutian Islands, Alaska
and Vancouver. From Vancouver the
flight- will be made across Canada
to Toronto: from Toronto to New
York, from New York to St. Johns.
Newfoundland.
Decision will then be made as to
the route across the Atlantic.
Sir Keith has just come from China
and Japan, where he made all ne
cessary arrangements for landing
places 'and petrol supplies. He has
collected a mass of data on weather
conditions, prevailing winds and ocean
-renditions from which he will map his
flight. He will go from here to Wash
ington where hydroeraphic records of
the United Btates government will be
studied to obtain further information
on Pacific conditions.

HOPE IN HARDING'S SPEECH
Clemencean Wants Diplomats to
"Make Most of It."
(By the Associated Press.)
Washington-. Dec. 8. Georges Cle
menceau, repeating his plea for
France in an address bere today, in
terpreted & paragraph of President
Harding's annual message' to congress
as an "overture" looking toward the
sort of European rapproachement for
which he hoi3.
The president's words dealt with the
four power treaty and were as fal
lows: "The, four power pact which abol
ishes every probability of war in tha
Pacific, has brought new confidence
in a maintained peace and I can well
believe it might be mad, a model for
like assuranejes wherever In the world
any common interests are concerned."
After reading this extract from the
president'a message, M. Clemenceau
said:
"I hope the diplomats will make
something of it."
OLD FILMS CAN BE REVAMPED
Plea of Douglas Fairbanks, Now a
Star, Denied by Court. '
New York, Dec 9. The plea of
Douerlas Fairbanks to restrain Hyman
Winik and others from revamping
films in which Fairbanks appeared
several years ago, was denied by Su
preme Court Justice Wagner yester
day. The court held that Fairbanks
was but an employe of the company
that made the films and that the pro
ducers had a right to make changes
in a commod.ty tbey had hired him to
help produce.
The decision may affect old films of
a number of other motion picture ac
tors and actresses who have become
stars since the older pictures wece
made.
