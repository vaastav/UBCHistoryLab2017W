THE republican policy of high
taxes, scarce money and low prices
will receive a liberal share of the
people's attention after the treaty
of peace i6 signed.
THE time on which the state

CONGRESSIONAL proceedings will

LAST week's severe blizzard

Cfi\alier county the board of
state school lands has loaned$15,
350 ou furm mortgages since Jan'y
1st. With the excepticn of Rich
land county the amount placed was
the largest in the state. The total
amount loaned by the board was
$115,255, the low rate of interest,
only fix per cent, made this source
of obtaining money quite popular
with the borrower.
MOJTET, while running the Set
tler, at Bismarck was taking
chances every day in the week ef
going to jail for criminal libel.
On the othei hand, the self-same
Moffet on going to the Philippines
in command of Cp. A., of the state
volunteer militia is place in charge
of the old Spanish prison at Man
ila. The question presents itself
that perhaps Moffet is a better
soldier than newspaper man.
SENATOR HANSLROUGH and Edi
tor Nye settled their little differ
ence, regarding the ownership of
the Enter-Ocean newspaper plant
over at Devils Lake, out of court.
It was bringing "Hans" too much
noterietv and he virtually allowed
Nye to dictate the terms of settle
ment. There's nothing like public
sei.'M'Dont to fill the position of a
pear -, commission when a United
Stau-3 Senator is trying to work a
blutf on a poor newspaper man.
IN the last issue of the Crystal
Call was an editorial which argued
in favor of making all educational
and judicial positions appointive
inst^aii of elective. The board of
railioad commissioners is another
position that Editor Minder argues
should be included in the list. It
is his opinion that with this added
responsibility resting with the
state executive greater care would
be taken by the people in selecting
a fitted man for the gubernatorial
chair. This is something that has
many good points both for and
against and no doubt time will be
given for its consideration before
the
old regime is changed.

An interesting question now be
ing discussed is whether the an-
habitants cit zens of the United
States with the reciprocal tights
and obligations of citizens. This
is one of the stumbling blocks to
the anti-expansionists, and they
make it one of their strongest
nleas against annexation. T'tiev
say that "the moment new territory
is incorporated into the national
domain its inhabitants become
citizens of the United States, and
as such are entitled to all the
privileges and immunities of citi-

this does not mean they become

"The main opposition to the an

from people who have all along

of Cuba. They are disappointed
in the fact that. Cuba has been
freed, and, in line with their views
on this subject, are opposed to the
