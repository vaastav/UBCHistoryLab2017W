President Cleveland's Message to
Congress.
TARIFF THE MAIN POINT
TOGETHER WITH THE SURPLUS IN
THE TREASURY.
Congress Held Responsible For the
Large Surplusâ€”He Favors Reduction of
Tariff, but Wants the Internal Revenue
Taxes to Remain Unchanged.
To the Congress of the United State
You are confronted at the threshold of
four legislative duties, with a condition of
the National finances which imperatively
demands immediate and careful considera
tion. The amount of money annually ex
aoted through the operation of present law,
from the industries and necessities of the
people largely exceeds the sums necessary
to meet the expenses of the government.
,AWhen we consider that the theory of our
institutions guarantees to every citizen the
full enjoyment of the fruits of his industry
and enterprise, with only such deduction as
may be bis share towards the careful and
economical maintenance of the government
which protects him, it is plain that the ex
action of more than this is indispensable ex
tortion and a culpable betrayal of Ameri
can fairness and justice. This wrong in
flicted upon those who bear the burden of
National taxation, like other wrongs, mul
tiplies a brood of evil consequences.
The pnblio treasury which should only
txist as a conduit, conveying the people's
tribute to its legitimate objects of expendi
ture, becomes a hoarding place for money
needlessly withdrawn from trade and the
people's use, thus crippling our National
energies, suspending our country's develop
ment, preventing investment in productive
tnterprise, threatening financial disturb
ance, and inviting schemes of public
plunder. This condition of our treasury is
not altogether new; and it has more than
once of late been submitted to the people's
representatives in the congress, who alone
' can apply a remedy. And yet the situation
. still continues, with aggravated incidents,
more than ever, presaging financial con
vulsion and wide-spread disaster. It will
not do to negleot this situation, because its
dangers are not now palpably imminent
and apparent They exist none the less
. certainly, and await the unforeseen and un
sxpeoted occasion when suddenly they will
be precipitated upon us.
On the 3oth day of June, J SS'j, the excess
of revenues over public expenditures after
complying with the annual requirement of
the sinking' fund act, wm $17,5t). 735.84;
during the year ended June 3), 188B, such
excess amounted to f4'j,sH,545.:.0; aud dur
ing the year ended June 3'J, lbo7, it reached
the sum Of $55,567, 84. 54.
The annual contributions to the sinking
fund during the three years above specified
amounting in the aggregate to 134, 058,
620. 94 and deduoted from the surplus as
stated, were made by calling in for that
purpose outstanding three-per-cent. bonds
of the government. During the six months
prior to June 80, 1887, the surplus revenue
had 'grown so largely repeated accumula
tions, and it was feared tha withdrawal of
this great sum needed by the people would
so affect the business of the country that
the sura of $70,861,100 cf such surplus was
applied to the payment of the principal and
interest of the three-per-cent bonds still
outstanding and which were then payable
at the option of the government. The pre
carious condition of financial affairs among
the people still needing relief, immediately
after the 30th day of June, 1887, the re
mainder of the three-per-cent. bonds then
outstanding, amounting with principal and
interest to the. sum of f 18,877,500 were
called in and applied to the sinking fund
contributions or the current fiscal year.
Notwithstanding these operations of the
treasury department representatives of dis:
tress in business circles not only continued,
but increased, and absolute peril seemed at
hand. In these circumstances the contribu
tion to the sinking fund for the current fis
cal year was at once completed by the ex
penditure of f37,684,!K3,55 iu the purchase
of government bonds, not yet due,
bearing 4 and 4 1-3 per cent interest,
the premium paid thereon averaging about
34 per cent . for . the former, and
per cent for' the latter. In addition
to this the interest accruing during the cur
rent year upon the outstanding bonded in
debtedness of the government was to some
extent anticipated, and banks selected aa
depositories of public money were per
mitted to somewhat increase their de-
posits. '
While the expedient thus employed to re
lease to the people the money lying idle in
the treasury, served to avert immediate
danger, our surplus revenues have con
tinued to accumulate, the excess for the
present year amounting on the 1st day of
December to 155,3 3,7ul. 19, and estimated
to reach the sum of $113,000,000 on the 30th
of June next, at which date it is expected
that this sum, added to prior accumula
tions, will swell the surplus in the treasury
to $140,000,000. There seems to be no assur
ance that, with such a withdrawal front
use of the people's circulating medium, our
business community may not, in the near
future, be subjected to the same distress
which was quite lately produced from the
same cause, and while the functions of our
National treasury should be few and simple,
and while its best condition would be
reached, I beiieve, by its entire disconnec
tion with private business interests, yet,
when, by a perversion of its purposes, it
idly holds money uselessly subtracted from
the channels of trade, there seems to be
reason for the claim that some legitimate
means should be devised by the government,
to restore iDW emergency, . without waste
or extravagance, such money to its place
among the people. . , ,
If suck an emergency arises there now ex-'
1st no clear and undoubted executive
mp nf relief. Herutofore the radnmn
j"."-. - - 1
tion of, three-per-cent bonds which. were-
payable at the option ot the government,
has afforded a means for Che disbursement
of the excess ot our revenues; but these
bonds bave all been retired, and there sure
no bonds outstanding the payment of which
we have the right to insist upon. The con-'
tribution to the sinking fund, which fur
nished the occasion for expenditure in the
purchase of bonds has been already made
for the current year, to that there is no out
let in that direction.
In the present state of legislation the only
pretense of any existing executive power to
restore, at this time, any part of our surplus
revenues to the people by its expenditure,
consist in the supposition that the secre
tary of the treasury may enter 'the market
and purchase the bonds of the government
not yet due at a rate of premium to be
agreed upon. Tne only provision of law
from which such a power could be derived
is found, in an appropriation bill passed a
number of years ago; and it is subject to
the suspicion that It was intended as tem
porary and limited in its application instead
of conferring a continuing discretion and
authority. No condition ought to exist
which would justify the grant ot power to
single official, upon his judgment of its
necessity, to withhold from or release to the
business ot the people, in an unusual man
ner, money held in the treasury and thus
affoot at his will the financial situation ot
the country; and if it is deemed wise to
lodge in the secretary of the treasury the
authority in the present juuoture to pur
chase bonds, it should be plainly vested and
provided as far as possible with such checks
and limitations as will define this official's
right and discretion and at the same time
relieve him from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring circulation the
surplus money accumulating in the treasury,
it should be borne in mind that premiums
must of course be paid upon such purchase,
that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investment whioh cannot be pur
chased at any price, and that combinations
among holders who are willing to sell, may
unreasonably enohanos the oost of such
bonds to the government, t
It has been suggested that the present
bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate
of interest, and the difference between the
old and new security paid iu cash, thus find
ing use for the surplus in the treasury. The
success of this plan, it is apparent, must de
pend upon the volition of the holders of the
present bonds; and it is not entirely certain
that the inducement whioh must be. offered
them would result in more financial benefit
to the government than the purohaae of the
bonds, while the latter proposition would re
duce the principle of the debt by actual pay
ment instead of extending it
The proposition to deposit the money held
by the government in banks throughout the
country for use by the people, is, it seems to
me, exceedingly objectionable in principle,
as establishing too close relationship be
tween the operations of the government
treasury and the business of the country,
and too extensive a commingling of their
money, thus fostering an unnatural reliance
in private business upon public funds. It
this scheme should be adopted it should
only bp done as a temporary expedient to
meet an urgent necessity. Legislative and
executive effort should generally be in the
opposite direction, and should have a ten
dency to divorce as muou and as fast as can
safely be done, the treasury department
from private enterprise. Of course it is
not expected that unnecessary and extrava
gant appropriations will be made for the
purpose of avoiding the acoummulation of
any excess of revenue. Such expenditure,
besides the demoralization of all just con
ceptions of public duty which it entails,
stimulates a habit of reckless improvidence
not in the least consistent with the mission
of our people on the high and beneficent
purposes of our government I shall deem
it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge
of my countrymen, as well as to the atten
tion of their repsentatives charged with
the responsibility of legislative relief, the
gravity of our fiaancial situation. The
failure of the congress heretofore to pro
vide against the dangers which it was quite
evident the very nature ot the difficulty
must necessarily produce, caused a condi
tion of financial distress and apprehension
since your last adjournment, which taxed
to the utmost all the authority and expe
dient within executive control; and these
appear now to be exhausted. If disaster re
sults from the continued inaction of con
gress, the responsibility must rest where it
belongs,
Though the situation thus far considered
it fraught - with danger, which should be
fully realized, and though it presents fea
tures of wrong to the people, as well as
peril to the country, it is but a result grow
ing out of a perfectly palpable and appar
ent cause, constantly reproducing the same
alarming oiroimstauoes a congested ' Na
tional treasury and a depleted monetary
condition in the business ot the oouutry. It
need hardly be stated that while the present
situation demands a remedy, we can only
be saved from a like predicament in the
future, by the.mreoval of its cause. Our
scheme of taxation by means of which this
needless surplus is taken from the publio
treasury, consists of a tariff or duty levied
upon importions from abroad and internal
taxes lived on the consumption of tobacco
and spirituous and mlt liquors.
It must be conoeded that none ot the
things subjected to internal revenue taxa
tion are, striotly speaking, necessaries;
there appears to be no just complaint of
this taxation by the consumers of these
articles, and there seems to be nothing so
well able to bear the burden without hard
ship to any portion ot he people, But our
present tariff laws, the vicious, inequitable
and illogioal souroe ot unnecessary taxa
tion, ought to be at onoe revised and
amended. These laws as their primary and
plain effect, raise the price to consumers of
all artioles imported and subjeot to duty,
by precisely the sum paid for such duties.
Thus the amount of the duty measures the
tax paid by those who purohase for use
these imported articles. Many of these
things, however, are raised or manufactured
In our own country, and the duties now
levied upon foreign goods and produots are
called protection to these home manufac
turers, because they render it possible for
those of our people who are manufacturers
to make these taxed artioles and sell them
for a price equal to that demanded for the
imported goods that have paid oustoms
duty.
Ho it happens that while comparatively a
few use the imported artioles millions of
of our people who use and never saw any of
the foreign produots, purohase and use
things of the same kind made in this coun
try, and pay therefor nearly or quite the
same price which the duty adJs to tha im
ported articles. Those who buy imports
pay the duty charged thereon into the pub
lio treasury, but the great majority of our
oltizens who buy domestio artioles ot the
same class, pay a sum at least approxi
mate equal to this duty to the home manu
facturer. - This reference to the operation
of our tariff laws ' is not made by way of
instruction, but in order that we may be
constantly reminded Ot the manner In which
they Impose a burden on those who oon
sume domestio products, as well as those
Who consume imported articles, and thus
create a tax upon all our people.
It it not proposed to entirely relieve tha
country o( this taxation; it must be exten
sively continued as the source of the govern
ment's income; and in a readjustment of our
tariff the interests of American labor en
gaged in manafactura mould be carefully
considered as well as tha preservation ot our
manufacturers. It may be called protection,
or by any other name, but relief from the
hardships and dangers of our present tariff
law should be devised with especial precu
tion against imperiling the existence of our
manufacturing interests. But this interest
should not mean a condition, whioh without
regard to the' publio welfare or a National
exigency, must always insure the realization
of Immense profit instead of moderately pro
fitable returns. As the volume and divers
ity of oui- iSational activities increase new re
cruits are added to those who desire a con
tinuation of the new advantages which they
oonceive the present system ot tariff taxa
tion directly offered them.
So stubbornly have all efforts to reform
the present condition been resisted by those
of our fellow -citizens thus engaged that
they can hardly complain of the suspioion,
entertained to a certain extent that there ex
ists an organized combination all along tha
line to maintain their advantage. We are in
the midst of centennial celebrations and
with becoming pride we rejoice in Ameri
can skill and ingenuity in American energy
and enterprise, and in the wonderful natu
ral advantages and resources developed by
century's National growth. Yet when an
attempt is made to justify a soheme whioh
permits a tax to be laid upon every con
sumer in the land for the benefit of our
manufacturers, quite beyond a reasonable
demand for governmental regard, it suits
the purposes ot advocacy to call our manu
factures infant industries still needing the
highest and greatest degree of favor and
fastening oare that can be wrung from
federal legislation. It is also stated that
the increase in the price of domestio manu
factures resulting from the present tariff is
necessary in order that higher wages may be
paid to our workingmen employed in manu
factories, than are paid tor what is called
the pauper labor of Europe.
All will acknowledge the force of an argu
ment which involves the welfare and liberal
compensation of our labor is honorable in
the eyes of every American citizen; and as
it lies at the foundation of our devalopment
and progress, it is entitled, without affecta
tion or hypooraoy, to the utmost regard.
The standard of our laborer's life should not
be measured by that of any other country
less favored, and they are entitled to their
full share of our advantages. By the last
census it is made to, appear that of the 17,
302,099 of our population engaged in all
kinds of industries, 7,670,493 are employed
in agriculture, 4,074,238 in professional and
personal service, (2,934,874 of whom are
domestio servants and laborers,) whllt.
l,810,5i) are employed in trade and trans
portation; and 3,857,113 are classed as em
ployed in manufacturing and mining.
For present purposes, however, the last
number given should be considerably re
duced. Without attempting to enumerate
all, it will be conoeded that there should be
deducted from those which it includes 875,
143 carpenters and joiners, 385,401 milliners,
dressmakers and seamstresses ; 173,726 black
smiths, 133.7&6 tailors and tailoresses, 103,
473 masons, 76,341 butchers, 41,309 bakers,
33,083 plasterers, and 4,891 engaged in man
ufacturing agricultural implements,
amounting in the aggregate to 1,314,023,
leaving S,633,0S9 persons employed in such
manufacturing industries, as are claimed to
be benefitted by a high tariff. To these the
appeal is made to save their employment,
and maintain their wages by resisting a
change.
There should be no disposition to answer
suoh suggestions by the allegation that they
are in a minority among those who labor,
and therefore should forego an advantage,
in the interest of low prices for the ma
jority ; their compensation, as it may be af
fected by the operation of tariff laws,
should at all times be scrupulously kept in
view; and yet with slight repletion they
will not overlook the fact that they are con
sumers with the rest: that they, too, have
their own wants and those ef their families
to supply from the earning, and that the
prioe of the necessaries of life as well as
the amount of their wages, will regulate the
measure of their welfare and oomfort But
the reduction of taxation demanded should
be so measured as not to necessitate or jus
tify the loss of employment by the working
man, nor lessen bis wages, the profits still
remaining to the manufacturer after a
necessary readjustment should furnish no
excuse for the sacrifice ot the interested ot
his employes either in their opportunity to
work or in the deminution ot their compen
sation. Nor can the worker in manufac
tures fail to understand that while a high
tariff is claimed to be necessary to allow
the payment of remunerative wagers it cer
tainly resulted in a very large increase in
the price of nearly all sorts of manufac
tures, whioh, in almost countless forms, he
needs for the use of himself and his family.
He receives at the desk of his employer his
wages, and perhaps before he reaches bis
home is obliged in a purchase for family
use ot an arlicle which embraces his own
labor, to return in the pay men t of the in
crease in price which the tariff permits the
hard earned compensation of m any days of
toil
The farmer and the agriculturalist, who
manufacture nothing but wh pay the in
creased price which the tariff imposes, upon
every agricultural implement, upon all he
wears and upon all he uses and owns,' ex
cept the increase of his flocks and herds, and
such things as in his husbandry produces
from the soil, is invited to aid in main
taining the present situation, and he is told
that a high duty on imported wool is neces
sary for the benefit of those who have sheep
to shear, in order that the prioe of their
wool may be increased. They, of course,
are not reminded that the farmer who has
no sheep is this soheme obliged, in his pur
chases of clothing and woolen goods, to pay
a tribute to his fellow farmer as well as to
the manufacturer and merchant; nor is any
mention made ot the fact that the sheep
owners themselves and their households,
must wear clothing and use other artioles
manufactured from the wooL They sell at
tariff prices and ' thus it consumers must
return their share of this increased price to
the tradesman.
I think it may be fairly assumed that a
large proportion of the sheep owned by the
farmer! throughout the country are found
in small flocks numbering from twenty-five
to fifty. The duty on this grade of imported
wool whioh these sheep yield is ten cents
eaoh pound if of the value of thirty cents or
less, and. twelve cents if ot the value of
more than thirty cents. If the liberal esti
mate of six pounds be allowed for each
fleece,' the duty thereon would be sixty or
seventy-two oents, and this may' be taken
as the utmost enhanoement ot its prioe to
the farmer by reason of this duty. Eight
een dollars would thus represent the in
creased price of the wool from twenty-five
sheep and $36 that from the wool of fifty
sheep; and at present values this addition
would amount to about one-third of its
price.. If upon its sale the farmer receives
this or a lest tariff profit, the wool leaves
his bands charged with', precissly that sum,
which in all Its changes will adhere to it,
until it reaches the consumer. When man
ufactured into cloth and other goods and
material for use its oost is not only In
creased to the extent of the farmer's tariff
profit, but a further sum has been added
for the benefit of the manufacturer under
the operation of other tariff laws.
In the meantime the day arrives when the
farmers find it necessary to purohase woolen
goods and material to clothe himself and
family for the winter. When he faces the
tradesman for that purpose he discovers
that he is obliged not only to return in tha
way of increased prices, his tariff profit on
the wool he told, and which then perhaps
lies before him iu manufactured form, but
that he must add a considerable sum thereto
to meet a further increase in cost caused by
a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus in
the end he is ai sused to the fact that he has
paid upon a moderate purchase, as a result
of the tariff scheme, which, when he sold
his wool seemed so profitable, an inorease
in price more than sufficient to sweep away
all the tariff profit he received upon the
wool he produced and sold.
When the number of farmers engaged in
wool raising la compared with the farmers
in the country, and the small proportion
they bear to our population is considered;
when it is made apparent that in the case of
a large part of those who own sheep, the
benefit of the present tariff on wool is
illusory; and, above aft, when it must be
conceded that the inorease of the cost of
living caused by such tariff becomes a bur
den upon those with moderate means and
the poor, the employed and unemployed, the
sick and well, and the young and old, and
that it constitutes a tax, whiob, with relent
less grasp, is fastened upon the clothing of
every man, woman and child in the land,
reasons are suggested why the removal or
reduction of this duty should be included in
a revision of our tariff laws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the
consumer of our home manufactures, result
ing from a duty laid upon imported artioles
of the same description, the fact is overlooked
that competition among our domestio pro
ducers sometimes has the effect of keeping
the prioe of their produots below the highest
limit allowed by suoh duty. But it is notori
ous that this competition is to often stran
gled by combinations quite prevalent at this
time and frequently called trusts which have
for the object their regulation of the supply
and price of commodities made and sold by
members of the combination. The people
can hardly hope for any consideration in the
operation of these selfish schemes.
If, however, in the absence of such combina
tion, a healthy and free cdmpetion reduces
ihe price ot any particular dutiable article
of home production below the limit which
it might otherwise reach under our tariff
laws, and if, with' such reduced price its
raanuntcture continues to thrive, it is en
tirely evident that one thing has been dis
covered whioh should be carefully scruti
nized in an effort to reduce taxation. The
necessity of combination to maintain the
price of any commodity to the tariff point
furnishes proof that some one is willing to
accept lower prices for such commodity and
that suoh prices are remunerative, and
lower prices produced by competition prove
the same thin Thus where either ot these
conditions exist, a case would seem to be
presented for an easy reduction of taxation.
The considerations which have bean pre
sented touching our tariff laws are intended
only to enforce an earnest recommendation
that the surplus revenues of the government
be prevented by the deduction or our ens
om duties, and, at the same time, to em
phasize a suggestion that in accomplishing
this purpose we may discharge a double
duty to our people, by granting to them a
measure of relief . from tariff taxation in
quarters where it is most needed, and from
sources where it can be most fairly and
justly accorded. Nor can the presentation
made of such considerations, with any de
gree of fairness, be regarded as evidence of
unfriendliness toward our manufacturing
interests, or of any lack of appreciation of
their value and importance.
These interests constitute a leading and
most substantial, element of our National
greatneis, and furnish the proud proof ot
our country's progress. But it in the emer
gency that presses upon us our manu
facturers are asked to surrender something
for the public good, and to avert disaster,
their patriotism as well as a grateful resig
nation of advantages already afforded,
ohould lead them to willing co-operation.
No demand is made that they shall forego
all the benefits of governmental regard;
but they cannot fail to be ' admonished of
their duty, as well as their enlightened self
interest and safety, when they are reminded
of the fact that financial panic and collapse
to which the present condition tends, afford
no greater shelter or protection to our man
ufacturers than to our other important en
terprises opportunity for safe, careful and
deliberate reform is now afforded, and none
of us should be unmindful of a time when
an abused and irritated people, heedless of
those who have resisted timely andreasona
ble relief may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wrong.
The difficulty attending a wise and fair
revision of our tariff laws is not under
estimated. It will require on the part of
the eongress great labor and care, and
especially abroad aud National contempla
tion ot the subjeot, and a patriotic disre
gard of such local and selfish claims as are
unreasonable and reckless of the welfare of
the entire countsy. Under our present laws
more than four thousand articles are sub
ject to duty. Many of these do not in any
way compete with our own manufacturers,
and many are hardly worth attention as
subjects of revenue. A considerable reduc
tion can be made in the aggregate, by add
ing them to the free list. The taxation of
luxuries presents no features of hardship,
but the necessaries of life used and con
sumed by all the people, the duty upon
which adds to the cost of living in every
home, should be greatly cheapened. The
radicul reduction of the duties imposed
upon raw material used in manufacturers
or its free importation, is, of course, an im
portant factor in an effort to reduce the
price of thesj necessaries; would not only
relieve them from the increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being thus cheapened,
that part of the tariff now lald;upon such
product as a compensation to our manufac
tures for the present price of raw material
could be occasionally modified. Such re
duction, or free importation, would serve
beside to largely reduce the revenue.
It is not apparent how such change
can .have any injurious effect upon
our manufacturers. On the contrary, it
would appear to give them a better chance
in foreign markets with the manufacturers
of other countries, who cheapen their wares
by free material. Thus our people might
bare the opportunity of extending their
sales beyond the limit ot home consump
tion, saving them the depression of inter
ruption in business and loss caused by a
glutted domestio market, and affording
their employes more certain and steady
labor, with its resulting quiet and content
ment The question thus imperatively pre
sented for solution should be approached in
a spirit higher than partisanship and con
sidered in the light of that regard for patri
otic duty which should characterize the
action of those intrusted with the weal of a
confiding people. But the obligation to de
clared party policy and principle is not
wanting to urge- prompt and effective
action.
. Both of the great political parties now rep
resented in the government have, by re
peated and authoritive declarations, con
demned the condition of our laws which per
mit the collection rom the people of unneces
sary revenue, and have, in the most solemn
manner promised its correction; and neither
as citizens or partisians are our countrymen
in a mood to condone the deliberate violation
of these pledges. Our progress toward a
wise conclusion will not be improved by
dwelling upon the theories of protection and
free trade. This savors top much of bandy
ing epithets. It is a condition which con
fronts us not a theory. A relief from this
condition may involve a slight reduction ot
ot the advantages which we award our home
productions. But the entire withdrawal of
such advantages should not be contemplated.
The question of free trade is absolutely ir
relevant; and the persistent olaini made in
certain quarters, that all efforts to relieve
the people from unjust and unnecessary
taxation, are schemes of so-called free
traders, is misohievdus aud far removed
from any consideration for the publio good.
The simple and plain duty whioh we owe
the people is to reduce taxation to the
necessary expenses of an economical opera
tion of the government and to restore to
the business ot the country- the money
which we bold in the treasury through the
perversion of governmental powers. These
things can and should be done with safety
to all our industries, without danger to the
opportunity for remunerative labor whioh
our workingmen need, and with benefit to
them and all our people, by cheapening
their means of existence and increasing the
measure of their iiomf orta
The constitution provides that the presi
dent shall, from time to time, give to the
congress information of thestate of union.
It has been the custom of the executive in
compliance with this provision, to annually
exhibit to the cougrese, at the opening of
its session, the general condition of the
country, and to detail, with some particu
larity the operations of the different execu
tive departments. It would be especially
agreeable to follow this course at the pres
ent time, aud to call attention to the valua
ble accomplishments of these departments
during the last fiscal year. But I am so
much impressed with the paramount im
portance of the subject to which this com
munication has thus far been devoted, that
I shall forego the addition of any other
topic, and only urge upon your immediate
consideration the "state of the union," as
xhown In the present condition of our treas
ury and our general fiscal situation, upon
which every element of our safety and
prosperity depends.' '
The reports of the heads of departments,
whioh will be submitted, contain full and
explicit information touching the transac
tions of the business intrusted to them, and
uch recommendations relating to legisla
tion in the publio interests as they deem ad
visable. I ask for these reports and recom
mendations the deliberate examination and
tction of the legislative branch ot the gov
ernment. There are other subjects not em
braced in the departmental reports," 7de
uianding legislative consideration, and
