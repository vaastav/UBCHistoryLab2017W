ETON JACKETS ARE STILL IN VOGUE
Smart Combination of Slink Fur and Velvet Is Very Popular Eton
Short Coats Have Been Made Comfortable by Many Ingenious
Devices Street Gown Should Be Eeasonably Short Pome
of the K"ew Effects in Corduroy.
Somebody whispered not long ago to the
effect that the Eton jacket was shortly to
be marked "passe," and shelved until the
fancy of Damo Fashion chose to revive it.
Dame Tashlon has assumed a woman's
prerogative, and changed her mind, evi
dently, for never have I seen so many
Etor.s and variations of the Eton as this
autumn. It is quite too useful a coatee to
bo shelved without a protest, and it's my
humble opinion it has come to stay In
definitely. Thereat, a great many tailor
mades," or perhaps "tailored-maids." will
rejoice.
For street gor.ns the long coat Is im
practicable. It spoils the tout ensemble of
a costume which is designed strictly for
out of doors, and It becomes1 burdensome
for walking. So mi-lady Is sure to take
great comfort In her suit coat.
Some of the prettiest jackets ore modi
fied to such a degree that the name Is all
there Is left of the original model. Take,
IOr Instance, tho Pfl.lt thnt nnn!.t1 n
black velvet gown, which 1 saw on the ave

was braided with soutache braid In a criss
crss ceslgn. and there were position coat
tails heavily outlined with braid; these were
studded with tiny gold buttons. The front

witn a double row of gold buttons. Another
Jacket of corduroy In the new betel-nut
shade had a cape collar and fastened only
at the top. This was trimmed with wide
scalloped bands of brown taffeta silk.
lor a combination mink fur and velvet
of the same shade ore very popular-. The
jacket Is made solidly of fur: the skirt of
velvet, trimmed with fur bands.
ilany Ingenious devices are used to ren
der the Eton Jacket suit comfortable In
cold weather. The chamois vest Is perhaps
the simplest and most comfortable arrange
ment. The padded bodice Is mich an old thins;
that It would need no mention were it not
for an Improved way of padding It. This is
by means of a silk shirt worn underneath.
The silk garment Is simply a taffeta shirt
waist of becoming color, which is slipped
on ns a waist under a waist. The added
warmth is considerable, and. besides, if
madarne wishes to remove her bodice, she
may do so. for the taffeta shirt waist un
derneath Is very becoming, and quite fit to
eppear la public
BOOKS make: ideal presents.
Choose Cheery, Sunshiny Stories or
the Classic, Old or Xcnr.
Books and pictures whn well chosen
and perfectly adapted to the receiver are
Ideal presents. But do not give a volume
of Browning to a little sister, a French
novel to jour grandmother, or a, book on
sheepraislng to your fatEer if he is a
lawyer, a banker or a minister. A book
should be given only when you understand
the mental culture and general attitude of
the mind of the one to whom you give. It
is much the same with a picture. One rule
should hold good as to Christmas bcoks
and pictures never give anything of a
painful nature, for such things do not fit
in well with the happy midwinter davs of
festivity. Choose cheery, sunshiny books,
the classics old and new, on which the
sun never sets, for gifts; and for picture .
If you can afford them, get bright, airy
water eolors or well executed etchings, full

IXJCIUOIS HAT ELASTICS.
Optio Serve la Of tea Affected by Evea
a Band of Robber.
I wonder how many motners know that
they ore Injuring the eyesight cf their
little ones by putting the elastic that
keeps the little hat In place behind the
ears instead of In front of them. The op
tic nerve is placed Just back of the ears
and the pressure that is brought to bear
on it by this tiny band of rubber Is very
harmful to that sensitive organ, the eye.
It is unfortunate that the elastic cannot
be done away with entirely, but no other
method cf fastening the hats of little peo
ple haa been suggested, for, of course, a
hat pin would be a deadly weapon when
converted to the use of youngsters, so
make hasto to adopt the lesser evil. The
children will doubtless object to the change
at first but they will soon grow accus
tomed to it.
READTSO AS A RECREATIOX.

Reading should form a considerable ele

not only Is it a pleasure while one is at It,
but there Is nothing that will educate one
so quickly. One or two hours a day Is none
too much to spend with substantial litera
ture eaays, history, poetry, political econ

habit once formed is a joy forever; possess-

W mates than lite the pivdoctsfl
ing It. one need never know a lonely hour,
one's books become one's friends, and from
the hour or two spent in reading one uncon
sciously acquires a studious disposition.
Heading an essay, for instance, vou come
across a name or a word that is either en
tirely unfamiliar or Is remembered dimly;
the name or word rerhaps appears fre
quently, and you naturally wish to read
understandlngly: your only course to ac
quire your end is to spend a few moments
with the encjeyopedia or the dictionary.
In those few moments the searcher Is cer
tainly richer In knowledge by more than
the information she started out to find.
Such reading cannot help but be education
al, and a self-search for information Is a
dozen times more beneficial than knowledge
sought and gained without personal effort.

REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
New York. Dec. 11 Edward A. Blhn,
treasurer of the Garden Theater, was sued
to-day In this city by a San Francisco belle
Miss Alice Roland for 13,000 damages for
alleged breach of promise of marriage.
Julius Lehmann, her counsel, asserts that
sicca the time when Miss Roland alleges
Blhn jilted her Blhn has been married to
another young woman. Meager details of
the suit were made publio to-day In the
Supreme Court in legal papers filed in an
application, made by Frank L. Crocker,
counsel for Blhn. for an order of court re
quiring Miss Roland to deposit $50 to se
cure the costs in the suit on the ground that
she sued as a, nonresident.
Mr. Tfhmann opposed the application. He
said that Miss Roland was about to come
to this city to live, and would be a resident
here before the trial of the suit. In sup
port of that statement Mr. T-hmnnn sub
mitted to the court a telegram from Miss
Roland's San Francisco lawyer. The tele
