An amazing instance of human per
fidy was brought to the attention of
the police the other day, si-.ys the Buf
falo Express. A young man com
plained that his uncle hat/ .irornlsed to
drop five dollars a month in his infan
tile savings bank if he abstained from
liquor, tobacco and froward conduct
until he attained his majority. The
lad avers that he has faithfully kept
his part of the contract, hut that on
opening the bank he found it empty,
whereas it should have contained $800.
Thus the complainant has missed all
the delights of youth and has nothing
to compensate him except his good
habits.
Nevertheless, let's hope that Miss
Vanderbllt will be happy with her
112,000,000 fortune. It is a good
deal of a burden, but there are ways
of lightening It. Among thff least ad

White Mice on the Flag.
Lieut. It. G. Hervey, of the rtritish
navy, has designed a (lag for the use
af submarines. The flag measures 18
by 12 feet and its background is in
Ihreo vertical sections, one colored yel
low, another red and the third blue,
tn the center is a black shield, divided
Into four parts, two of which are oc
cupied by a submarine and three tor
pedoes. In each of the remaining
itiarters is a white mouse rampant.
This is the first time white or any
Dthci colored mice have appeared on
flag. The explanation of their pres
ence on the submarine flag is that
a-liite mice arc always carried on a
submarine boat as a safeguard to the
:rew, says the Montreal Gazette. Ro
dents are considerably more sensitive
than men to noxious gases, such as
those which have a tendency to ae
tumulate in a submarine, and immedi
ately the mice show signs of collapse

accordingly the boat is brought to the
