miles behind the record established in

efforts of Walthour and Bedell to re
gain the lap lost, when they formed
a new partnership because of acci
dents to their original team mates, are
a feature Ot the race. Late lost night
they nearly succeeded, a spill spoil
Ing their effort when the men, riding

in the senate of the constitutional j they are claimed, if we can, in de
questlons involved. If the military I (Continued on Page 8.)
and civil forces of the federal gov-j - -.-
ernment were to be used by the Pres- j
ident, said Mr. Rayner, It became very
important to know the exact status of
the President in the matter. "Because,"
he added. "It is quite a serious matter
In view of the great calamity that
has lately befallen the city of San
Francisco, for the President to con
template the bombarding of the city
at thla time, and to declare war
against the board of county school
trustees of San Francisco if there is
no Justification or pretext opon which
such ferocious proceedings can be
undertaken. The President Is' exer
cising a great many functions legis
lative, executive and judicial, lawful
and unlawful, constitutional and un
constitutional. If he is possessed of
the idea that he la supervisor of al!
of the public schools of the various
state of the union, and he seems to
be impressed with tbts Idea, because
In the very last paragraph ot his mes
sage he recommends the establishment
of shooting galleries in all of the
large public schools of the country
we' must either disabuse his mind of
this fancy or we must let him know
that we agree to the omnipotence of
his Jurisdiction. 1 If he can take pos
session of the public schools of Cal
ifornia and compel the state to ad
mit, to them Japanese students.-contrary
to " th laws of California, he
could with equal propriety send na
an amendment tj the Santo Domingo
treaty and demand the admts'lon of
the negro children of Santo Domingo
into the white schools of South Caro
lina- or Of any? other state of the
union. Of course, if the people have
come to the conclusion that" every
thing the President recommends . is
right, then there Is hardly any use
in contesting any of his prooosltlons
and instead of conferring upon htm
the power to nfove congress informa
tion of the states of the union, we
mtght confer upon him the function of
furnishing his own peculiar, views
upon the entire state of the universe
and - recommending any improve
ments or chancres In the general plrtn
of creation that he may deem expe
dient, from the cradle to the grave. In
fact, the President, upon page 19 of'
his message, anticipates the cradle
and makes a recommendation upon
the states of the union that tends to
place in his hands , the establishment
of the birth rate of the country. Now
if we can only supplement this func
tion by giving him complete Jurisdic
tion over the death rate, we will then
have a rule on which his ubiquity is
unclrcumscrlbed and whose unlimited
possibilities are beyond the reach of
human contemplation."
Mr. Rayner coincides with what the
President bad said in his message In
praise of the Japanese, His sympa
thies had, be said, been with them
during the war with Russia and he
thought it a shame that Japan should
have been overpowered in the con
ference room when she had been vic
torious on the battlefield. He pro
posed, he said, to discuss the present
question entirely outside of the" par
ticular circumstances and plant him
self on these two propositions:
X. , That there is no provision what
ever in the treaty with Japan 'that
confers the right that the President
speaks of or gives to -the government
of Japan the privileges that it claims
In connection with the public school
system of California or of any other
state. .,..'.''... .
2. If there was such a provision in
this or any other treaty conferring
this right the treaty would be void
and ...without any authority upon the
part of the United States to make it,
and in violation of the constitution
that the treaty-making power , of the '
government
"The -precise point Involved," be
said, Is the tenth article of the con-'
stitutlon that powers not delegated to .
the United States nor prohibited by
It to the state, are reserved to the
states respectively or to the people."
Continuing. Mr. Rayner said: "The
power of a state to regulate its pub
lic school system, is clearly among tta
reserved powers. Have we therefore.
