OFFICIAL CITY PAPER.
Congress is in session and
about all you can read about
is ship subsidy. Analyzed, it
means plain steal.
Gov. Stanley is going to
make some sweeping reforms,
so he says. He will do just
what the corporations giye
him permission to do.
When the gold trust gets
to grinding, the gold stand
ard will bear more fruit than
ever before. We hope the re
publican idol worshippers
will get their money's worth.
"The ballots didn't get to
the Philippines in time."
Pretty graceful way of get
ting out of the hole. Fact is
no provision was made for an
election over there. Why not
make a clean breast of it?
Old man Lease, husband of
the celebrated Mary Ellen
Elizabeth, is to be free once
again. Hon. Mary has sued
for divorce and the meek man
will not resist. The laugha
ble thing of it is that Mary
alleges desertion.
You never hear of a strike
in our postal system, do you?
No. Why? Because the gov
ernment owns it and oper
ates it at cost. A tie same
could be done with the tele
graph system with equal sue
cess.
What the corporations don't
absorb through special favors
which will be granted them
at the approaching session of
the legislature, will go in the
way of enormous appropria
tions. The people must be
taxed in order that somebody
can have a rake-off.
The war revenue bill has
been framed by the commit
tee and will soon be reported
to the house. It reduces the
war revenue $40,000,000, and
the principal tax reduction is
on beer and other liquor.
i ne Drewenes nave a nne or
ganization and their lobby
is getting in its work. And
to these depths have our So
lons fallen!
ThePhilippine bugaboo has
been exploded at last and
Hon. John A. Lestef will get
his seat as representative of
the 77th district to which he
was elected. The republicans
died hard but it seems that
they have finally given up.
W. C. Millar says he will not
contest for the seat because
the U. S. senator would be
disposed of before the matter
could be determined. Other
and better reasons are that a
recount would increase in
stead of decrease Mr. Lester's
majority. Mr. Millar attrib
utes his defeat to the fight
over the U. S. senatorship.
TOBTTJEED A WITNESS.
Intense suffering was endured by wit
ness T. L. Martin, of Dixie, Ky., before
he gave this evidence: "1 coughed ev
ery night until my throat was raw;then
tried Dr. King's New Discovery which
gave Instant relief. I have used it la
my family ror rotir years and recom
mend it as the greatest remedy for
coughs, colds and throat, chest and
lung troubles. It will stop the worst
couzh, aud not only prevents but cures
consumption." Price 60c and $1. Ev

TELEGRAPH 0PERAT6RS STRIKE.
The Santa Fe telegraph operators
went out on a strike on Saturday even
ing and as a consequence train service
is greatly crippled and communication
by wire is shot off. The trouble began
on the Gulf system between Pursell, I.
T. and the Gulf. The principal greiv
ance is low wages and long hours the
oft repeated story.
There is no telling where it will end.
It may involve the railroad employees
before it ends. Both the company and
and operators have taken a firm stand
and if neither gives in it will work a
great hardship on the public..
As it stands now all special trains
are blocked and transportation is re
tarded. The mails and regular passen
ger and freight trains are not delayed.
There is an interesting lesson in this
strike for people who have overcome
prejudice sufficiently to study the caus
es and remedies for the tyranny of pri
vate monopoly.
"The Country it Saved."
Advocate.
In the White House, these eyenings,
lights are burning late. The veracious
daily newsrapers inform us that the
clerks are working till midnight on the
letters of congratulation received by
the President. They also say that by
careful computation ninety-nine and a
traction per cent of them say:
"Honored Sir: The country is saved.
I caunot refrain from thanking God
that you are re-elected, and sending
you my deepest congratulations. Pros
penty is assured.
"Signed, J. Jones.
"P. S. The postoifice here is horri
bly managed by your former appointee,
and I am an applicant for it. Please
give me the office. My application is
attached."
TnK name ot the president of the
salt trust is Skinner, which probably
accounts for the fact that the price of
salt has more than doubled since Noy.
6th.
Government ownership may be an
old song, distasteful to political mos3
backs and all that, but just the same it
would be a godsend in the present crisis
brought about by the telegraphers'
strike.
The president's message contains 18,-
000 words and deals chiefly with the
Chinese and Philippine questions.
Contrary to his campaign buncombe,
President McKinley does not recog
nize in his message that the war is ov
er or anyway near it.
Hon. Ciias. A. Towne has been ap
pointed by Gov. Lind of Minnesota, to
fill the vacancy in the U. S. senate,
caused by the death of Senator Davis.
Towne will serve until March when the
legislature will have elected a republican
to succeed him. Gov. Lind is a demo
crat but he wanted to appoint a republi
can to fill the vacancy, on account of
the short time until the legislature
convenes. The republicans, however,
feared that such action might compli
cate the approaching contest in the leg
islature and hence none of them con
sented to serve.
The "Appeal to Reason," a socialist
newspaper published in Girard, Kan
sas, bv J. a. Way land, has the record
of having published the largest paid
edition of any newspaper since the
dawn of printing. It was the last edi
tion before election when its paid sub
scribers reached the phenomenal num
ber of 920,000. It not only shows the
busineGs energy of a man, but also
shows that millions are either votaries
of socialism or at least are taking suf
Gcent interest therein to investigate.
It may be that these extremists or
fanatics if you please will in the en
suing four years sweep over the coun
try like an African soroco; or perchance
if the ideas they advance are not as
wild and visionary as thought by most
of us, they may revolutionize the pres
ent status of existing affairs tor the
amelioration of the condition of hu
manity. Who can tell? Northport
(Wash.) News.
The number ot people who actually
believe that trusts are a great help to
the people is by no means small. There
are some people, who, on other matters
are ordinarily intelligent, are so dense
ly iguorant on that proposition as to
say that by means of trusts the neces
saries of life are cheapened. Then
with a puffed up pride greater than
that of an ancient Miltiades, they point
us to the price of a few articles now
controlled by the trusts compared with
the price of the Bame articles 60 and 75
yea is ago when there was scarcely a
trust in existence, with self evident
satisfaction that they have made' a
three-base hit. What silliness! These
perambulating cocoanuts are too shal
low to be cracked. They seem to for
get or probably neyer knew that with
new inventions and new mechanical
appliances, production has been cheap
ened and multiplied so that now the
cost of production of the present day
is so much less than it was In those
years of over a half century ago, that
the rules of per centage can hardly cal
culate it. Admitting that there are
articles (and they are few) sold cheaper
now in the hands of trusts than they
were then in the hands of individuals,
the per cent of proQt to the trust, is
hundreds of times greater than it was
to the individual. If the necessaries of
life were furnished the consumer now
at cost of production as they were then,
these fellows who now shower blessings
on the trusts, would stand , aghast in
open-eyed wonderment and marvel at
things they had never realized before.
The trust is the midnight highwayman
of the century and he who defends t it
would be as consistent to invite an out
right holdup in the daily walks of life.

If every district in the state
had elected such a represent
ative as Barber county did,
there would be no scandals
connected with the approach
ing session of the legislature.
State Supt. Nelson favors a
law giving book companies
more leverage. He says school
books are too cheap. If you
voted for Nelson, j ast pay
the advanced price without
grumbling when you buy
books for your children next
fall.
From the amount of fellows
who are daily" arriving in To
peka to "take charge ot the
campaign" in behalf of differ
ent senatorial aspirants, it
can be inferred that there
will be luxurious pastures for
that class of legislators who
look on the "long green" with
lustful eye.
It would be worth thous
ands of dollars to the people
of Kansas if there were no leg
islative session in Kansas
this winter. The friends of
the trusts and corporations
compose both houses and
they will distribute favors
lavishly. The people will be
squeezed and the corpora
tions will get the squeezings.
We were told by republi
can politicians that with Mc
Kinley's re-election the war
would end at once that the
insurgents were simply pro
longing it hoping for Bryan's
election. But it was a false
prophecy. The war is going
on at a greater death rate than
ever before and there is no
sign of the end.
Even the insurance com
panies are preparing a peti
tion to the legislature for a
law that will enable them to
dodge the payment of losses.
The corporations are going to
get their money back this
winter. They probably ex
pended a great deal of money
to get a republican legisla
ture but it will prove a good
investment for them.
The value of Rockefeller's
holdings inStandardCHl alone
is $240,000,000, to say noth
ing of his other possessions.
This accumulation of wealth
represents profit paid by con
sumers of oil. Now if they
paid so much money above
cost of production to Rocke
feller alone, how much tax
have they paid on all the
necessaries of life. Yet you
adore the trusts, do you?
mere are a good many
people in Barber county
learning that what the In
dex has been telling them
about ever increasing taxes
was not political buncombe
after all. This is what our
republican friends called
"personal abuse" then, but
we notice as they go down in
to their jeans to meet their
taxes the tune changes. The
"personal abuse" is on the
fellows who pay the taxes at
the present writin g.

THE IRL R. HICKS 1901 ALMANAC.
Whatever may be said of the scien
tific eauses upon which the Rev. Irl R.
Hicks bases his yearly forecasts of
storm and weather, it is a remarkable
fact that specific warning of every great
storm, flood, cold wave and drouth,
have been plainly printed in his now
famous almanac tor many years. The
latest startling proof of this fact was
the destruction of Galveston, on the
very day named by l'rof. Hicks in his
1900 Almanac. The 1901 Almanac, by
far the finest, most complete and beau
tiful yet published, is now ready. This
remarkable book of nearly 200 pages.
splendidly illustrated with charts and
half-tone engrayings, goes as a preml
urn to eyery suoscriber who pays one
dollar a year for Prof. Hicks1 journal.

POPULIST HATIOHAL PLATrOKH.
The Peoples parry of the United .Stater
in Convention assembled, congratulating US
suoporters on the wide extension of Its prin
ciples in aU directions, does hereby reaffirm ,
Its adherence to the fundamental principles
proclaimed in its two prior platforms, and -sails
upon all who desire to avert tbe tub.
version of free institutions by corporate and
imperialistic power, to unite with It In bring -
log the government back to tbe Ideals of
Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Lincoln. -It
extends to its allies In the struggle for tbe
financial and enconomic freedom assurance
of its loyalty to the principles which -aui- -
mate the allied forces and the promise of
honest and hearty co-operation in every effort
for their success. To the people of the Unit
ed States we offer this platform as the expres
sion of our unalterable convictions.-, -v
Resolved, That we denounce the act of
March U. 1900. as the culmination of a long
series dt conspiracies to deprive tbe people
of their constitutional rights over the money
of the nation and relegate to a gigantio moa- ' -ey
trust the control of the flnances.aDd.benoe
of the people. We denounce this act, ' first, - -
for making all money obligations, domestls
and foreign, payable In gold coin' or Its
equivalent, thus enormously Increasing the "
burdens of the debtors and enriching tbe
creditors; second, for refunding "coin" bonds
not to mature for years, into long-time gold -bonds,
so as to make tbelr payment lmprob
able and our debt perpetual; third, for tak
ing from the treasury over $50,000,000 In a
a time of war and presenting it at a premium '
to bondholders to accomplish tbe refunding
of bonds not due; fourth, for doubting the
capital of bankers by returning to them the
lace value or tnoir Donas m current money i '
notes, so that tney mav draw one Interest
from tbe government and another from the ,
people; fifth, for allowing banks to expand
and coutract their circulation at pleasure, v
thus controlling prices or all products; sixth.
for authorizing the secretary of the treasury
to issue new gold bonds to an unlimited -
amount whenever he deems It necessary to re- -
pienisn toe goia noara, tnus enabling usurers "
to secure more bonds and more bank curren -
cy by drawing gold from tho treasury, there- ,
i- creating an "endless chain, or Dernetuallr
adding to a perpetual debt; seventh, for '
striking down the greenback in order to force -
tbe people to borrow f 16,000,000 from tbe '
banks, at an annual cost of over 120,000,000.
While barring out the money of the oonstltu- r
tion. this law opens the printing mints of the
treasury to tbe free coinage of bank paper
mnnpv. rn fn nrn th. taw i rwi i m nnvarioh ih.
many. We pledge anew the Peoples party.
never to cease the agitation until this eighth -financial
conspiracy is blotted from tbe stat- -ute
books, and Lincoln greenback restored,
the bonds all paid and all corporation money
torever retired.
We reaffirm the demand for the reopen
ing of the mints of the United States to tbe
free and unlimited coinage of silver and gold
at the present legal ratio of 18 to 1, the im
mediate increase in the volume of silver coins
and certificates thus created to be substitut
ed, dollar for dollar, for the bank notes
issued by the private corporations under
special privilege granted by law of March 14,
1900. and prior national banking laws, the re
mainiag portion of the bank notes to be re
placed with full legal tender government pa
per money and its volume so controlled as to
maintain at all times a stable money market
and a stable price level.
We demand a graduated income and in.
heritance tax. to the end that aggregated
wealth ehall bear its Just proportion of taxa
tion. We demand that postal saving banks be
established by the government for the safe do
posit of the savings of the people and to fa
cilitate exchange.
With Thomas Jefferson, vre declare thn
land, including all natural sources of wealth,
tho Inalienable heritage of the people The
government should bo act as to secure homes
tor the people and prevent land monopoly.
The original homestead policy should be en
forced and future settlers on the public do
main should be entitled to a free homestead,
while all who have paid an aoreage price to
tbe government under existing laws should
have tbelr homestead rights restored.
Transportation being a means of change
and a public necessity, the government
should own and operate the railroads in tbe
interest of the people and on a non-partisan -basis,
to tbe end that all may be accorded the
same treatment in transportation and that
the extortion, tyranny, and political power
now exercised by the great railroad corpora
tions, which result in the impairment, it not
the destruction of the political rights and per
sonal liberties of the citizen, may be destroy
ed. Such ownership is to be accomplished In
a manner consistent with sound public jxlcy.
Trusts, tbe overshadowing evil of taV aga,
are the result and culmination of the private
ownersnip ana control oi tne tnree great in
struments of commerce money, transports- '
tion. and the means of transmission of infor
mation; which Instruments of commerce are
public functions and which our forefathers
declared in the constitution should be con
trolled by the people through their congress,
for the publio welfare. The one remedy for
the trusts is that the ownership and control
be assumed and exercised by the people. We
further demand that all tariffs on goods con
trolled by a trust should be abolished.
To cope with the trust evil, the people -must
act directly, without the Intervention of
representatives who may be controlled or in
fluenced. We therefore, demand direct legis
lation, giving the people tbe law-making and
veto power under the initiative and referen
dum. A majority of tbe people can never be
corruptly influenced. --
Applauding the valor of our army and
navy in the Spanish war, we denounce the
couduct of the administration in changing t
war for humanity into a war for conquest.
The action of tbe administration in tbe Philip
pines is in conflict with all the precedents of
our national life, at war with tbe declaration
of independence, the constitution and tbe
plain precepts ef humanity. Murlerand ar
son have been our response to the appeals of
the people, who asked only to establish a free
government in their own land. We demand a
stoppage of this war of extermination, by tbe
assurance to tbe Philippines of Independence
and protection under a stable government of
their own creation.
The declaration of independence, the con
stitution and tbe American flag are one and
inseparable. Tbe Island of Porto Rico Is a
part of tbe territory of the United States and
by levying special and extraordinary customs
dues on the commerce of that island, the ad
ministration has violated tbe constitution,
abandoned tbe fundamental principles of
American liberty and hits striven to give tbe
lie to the contcution ot our forefathers that
there should be no taxation without rep
resentation. Out of the imperialism which would force
an undesirable domination on tbe people of
the Philippines, springs tbe un-American cty
for a large standing army. - Nothing in tbe
character or purposes of our people justifies
us in ignoring tbe plain lesson of history and
putting our liberties in jeopardy by as
suming tbe burden of militarism, which
is crushing- the people of the old world. We
denounce the administration tor its sinis
ter efforts to substitute a standing army
for tbe citizen soldiery which is the best.,
safeguard for the republic
We extend to tbe brave Doors of South At-
rinfl on r nmnalh and moral ninmM(. . fkf-
patriotic struggle tor tbe right of self-government.
We are unalterably opposed to allianc
es, open or covert, between tbe United
States and any other nation. 1 bat tend to the
destruction of human liberty.
And a further manifestation of Imperial
ism is to be found in the mining districts of
Idaho. In tbe Coeur d' Alene district soldiers
have been used to overawe miners striving
for a measure of industrial independence and
we denounce tbe state government of Ids bo -and
tbe federal government to abridge
tbe civil riabts of the peopie and to enforce
an Infamous permit system which denies to
laborers tbelr inherent liberty and compels
them to forswear their manhood and their
right before being permitted to seek employ
ment. The Importation of Japanese and other la
borers under contract to serve monopolistic 4
corporations is a notorious and flagrant viol a
lion of tbe immigration laws. We demand -that
tbe federal government shall take cogni
xanne of this menacing evil and repress it un- '
der existing laws. We further pledge our
selves to strive for the enactment of more
stringent laws for tbe exclusiop of Mongolian
and Malayan immigration.
We endorse municipal ownership of pub
lie utilities and declare that tbe advantages
which have accrued to the publio under thai
system would be multiplied an hundred
fold by its extension to natural interstate
monopolies.
We denounce the practice of issuing la
j unctions in the cases of dispute between em
ployers and employes making criminal acts
by organization which are not criminal when
performed by individualsvand demand legis
lation lo restrain tbe evij. . -
We demand that United States senators
and all othevofScials as far as practicable be
elected by direct vote on the people. Believ
log that tbe elective franchise and an ontram.
melled ballot are essential to a government
of, for and by tbe people, the Peoples party
condemns this wholesale system of disfran
chisement bv coercion and Intimidation adopt
ed in some states, as un-Republican and un
Democratic. And we declare ft to be tbe du
ty of the several state legislatures to take -such
action as will secure a full, free and fair
DHKnaoaui nuawimgu.
We favor borne rule in tbe territories anil
