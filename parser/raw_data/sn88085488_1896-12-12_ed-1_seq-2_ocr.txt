PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
CLEVELAND'S VIBW§ <>> FOREIGH
AFFAIRS.
Washington, D. C, Dec 7.-President
Cleveland's last message was presented
to congress today. Following is that part
of the message relating to Turkey and the
Armenians and the Cuban situation:
To the Congress of the United States.
As representatives of the people in i*e
legislative branch of their h n U
you have assembled at a time> when , ,
strength and excellence of our free in
stitutions and the fitness ot ou civ
£ns to enjoy popular rule have been
rain made manifest. A political contest,
involving momentous consequence*
fraught with feverish apprehension, and
creating aggressiveness .so intense as to
approach bitterness and passion .been
waged throughout our land, and.deter
mined by the decree of free and inde
pendent suffrage without disturbance ot
our tranquillty or the least sign of weak
ness in our national structure.
When we consider these incidents and
contemplate the peaceful obedience and
submission which have succeeued a head
ed clash of political opinions, we discover
abundant evidence of a determination on
the part of our countrymen to abide Dy
every verdict of the popular will, and to
be controlled at all times by an abiding
faith in the agencies established for the
direction of the affairs of their govern
ment. Thus our people exhibit a patriotic
disposition, which entitles them to de
mand of those who undertake to maKe
and execute their laws such faithful and
unselfish service in their behalf as can
only be promoted by a serious apprecia
tion >-<- the trust and confidence which
the acceptance of public duty invites.
In obedience to a constitutional re
quirement, I hereby submit to congress
certain information concerning national
affairs, with the suggestion of such leg
islation as in my judgment is necessary
and expedient. To secure brevity and
avoid tiresome narration, I shall omit
many details concerning matters within
federal control which, by no means unim
portant, are more profitably discussed in
departmental reports. 1 shall also fur
ther curtail this communication by omit
ting a minute recital of any minor inci
dents connected with our foreign rela
tions which have heretofore found a
place in executive messages, but are now
contained In a report of the secretary of
state, which Is herewith submitted. (
TURKEY AND THE ARMENIANS.
United States Hat* Done Everything
Possible to Prevent Bloodshed.
At the outset of reference to the more
Important matters affecting our rela
tions with foreign powers, it would af
ford me satisfaction if I could assure
congress that the disturbances in Asiatic
Turkey had during the past year as
sumed a less hideous and bloody aspect,
and that either as a consequence of the ;
yielding of the Turkish government to I
the demand of humane civilization, or as
the result of decisive action on the part
of the great nations having the right by
treaty to interfere for the protection of
those exposed to the rage and mad bigotry
and cruel fanaticism, the shocking feat
ures of the situation had been mitigated. \
Instead, however, of welcoming a soft
ened disposition or protective intervention
we have been afflicted by continued and
not infrequent reports of the wanton de- '
struction of homes and the bloody butch- j
cry of men, women and children, made
martyrs to their profession of Christian
faith. While none of our citizens in Tur- j
key have thus far been killed or wound- I
ed, though often In the midst of dread- |
ful scenes of danger, their safety in the
future is by no means assured. Our gov
ernment at home ana our minister at Con
stantinople have left nothing undone -o ,
protect our missionaries in Ottoman ter- [
ritory, who constitute nearly all the in- i
dividuals residing there who have a right j
to claim our protection on the score of |
American citizenship. j
Our efforts in this direction will not be
relaxed, but the deep feeling and sym- j
pathy that have been raised among our i
people ought not to so far blind their;
reason and judgment as to lead them to '
demand Impossible things. The outbreaks
of blind fury which lead to murder and
pillage In Turkey occur suddenly and
Without notice, and an attempt on our
part to force such a hostile presence
there as might be effective for preven
tion or protection would not only be re
sisted by the Ottoman government, but
would be regarded as an intrusion by the
great nations who assert their exclusive
right to intervene at their own time and
by their own method for the security of
life and property in Turkey.
Naval Force at Hand.
Several naval vessels are stationed in
the Mediterranean as a measure of cau
tion and to furnish all possible relief and
refuge in case of emergency. We have
made claims against the Turkish govern
ment for the pillage and destruction of
missionary property at Harput and Ma
rash during the uprising at these placos.
Thus far the validity of these demands
has not been admitted, though our min
ister prior to such outrages, and in .in
ticlpation of danger, demanded protection
for the persons and property of our mls
l nary citizens in the localities men
tioned, and, notwithstanding that strong
evidence exists of the actual complicity
of Turkish soldiers in the destruction anJ
robbery, the facts as they now appear
do not permit UB to doubt the justice of
these claims, and nothing will be omitted
to bring about their prompt settlement.
A number of the Armenians having ar
rived at our ports, an order has lately
been obtained from the Turkish govern
ment permitting the wives and children
of such refugees to bring them here. It |
is hoped that hereafter no obstacle wil
be imposed to prevent those who seek t
avoid the perils which threaten them in
Turkish dominion.
Our recently appointed consul to Er
zeroum is at his post and discharging the
duties of his office, though for some un
accountable reason his formal exequator
from the sultan has not been issued. 1 do
not believe that the present sombre pros
pect in Turkey will be long permitted to
offend the sight of Christendom. It fo
mars the humane and enlightened civiliz
ation that belongs to the close of the 19th
century that It seems hardly possible that
the earnest demand of good people
throughout the Christian world for Its
corrective treatment will remain unan
swered.
OK THE CUBAN INSURRECTION.
Recognition of Belligerency Mr.
Cleveland Deems Unwise.
The insurrection in Cuba still continues
with all Its perplexities. It is difficult to
perceive that any progress has thus far
been made towards the pacification of the
island, or that the situation of affairs as
depicted In my last annual message has
in the least Improved. If Spain still holds
Havana and the seaports and all the con
siderable towns, the insurgents still run
at will over at least two-thirds of the
island country. The determination of
Spain to put down the insurrection seems
but to strengthen with the lapse of time
and is evidenced by her unhesitating de
votion of largely increased military and
naval forces to the task. There is much
reason to believe that the insurgents have
gained in number, character and re
sources, and are none the less inflexible in
their resolve not to succumb without
practically securing the great object for
v. hich they took up arms. If Spain has
not yet re-established her authority,
neither have the insurgents yet made
good their claim to be regarded as an in
dependent state. Indeed, as the contest
has gone on, the pretense that civil gov
ernment exists on the Island, except so
far as Spain is able to maintain it, has
been practically refuted. Spain does keep
on foot such a government, more or less
imperfectly, In the large towns and the
immediate suburbs; but that exception be
ing made, the entire country Is either
given over to anarchy or is subject to the
military occupation of one or the other
party. It is reported, Indeed, on reliable
authority, that at the demand of the com
mander-in-chief of the insurgent army
the putative Cuban government has now
Riven up all attempt to exercise its func
tions, leaving that government confessed
ly (what there is best reason for suppos
ing it always has been in fact) a govern
ment merely on paper.
No Decisive Battles.
Were tho Spanish armies able to meet
their antagonists in the open or in pitched
battle, a prompt and decisive result might
be looked for, and the immense superior
ity of the Spanish forces In numbers, dis
cipline and equipment could hardly fail to
tell greatly to their advantage. But they
are called upon to face a foe that shuns
general engagements, that can choose and
does choose Its own ground, that from the
nature of the country is visible or invisi
ble, at pleasure, and that fights only from
ambuscade and when all the advantages
of position and numbers are on its side.
In a country where all these causes are
dependent, especially by those born and
hied on the soil, it Is obvious that there la
hardly a limit to the time during which
hostilities of this sort may be prolonged.
Meanwhile, as In all cases of civil strife,
the passions of the combatants grow more
and more inflamed and excesses on both
sides become more frequent and more de
plorable.
Guerilla Fighting?.
They are aiso participated in by bands
of marauders, who, now in the name of
one party and now in the name of the
'< other, as may best suit the occasion, ha
rass the country at will and plunder its
i wretched inhabitants for their own ad
vantage. Such a condition of things would
inevitably entail Immense destruction of
property, even if it were the policy of both
parties to prevent it as far as practicable.
But while such seemed to be the original
policy of the Spanish government, It nas
now apparently abandoned It, and Is act
ing upon the same theory as the Insur
gents, namely, that the exigencies of the
contests require the wholesale annihila
tion of property that It may not prove of
any use and advantage to the enemy.
It is to the same end that, in pursuance
of general orders, Spanish garrisons are
now being withdrawn from plantations
and the rural population required to con
' centrate itself in towns. The sure result
would seem to be that the Industrial
value of the island is fast diminishing,
and that unless there is a speedy and
radical change In existing conditions it
will soon disappear altogether. That
value consists largely, of course, in its ca
pacity to produce sugar, a capacity al
ieady much reduced by the Interruptions
to tillage which have taken place during
the last two years. It Is reliably assert
ed that should these interruptions con
tinue during the current year, and prac
tically extend, as is now threatened, to
the entire sugar production territory of
the island, so much time and so much
money will be required to restore the
land to its normal productiveness that It
is extremely doubtful that the people can
be induced to even make the attempt.
Of Great Concern to Us.
The spectacle of the utter ruin of an
adjoining country, by nature one of the
most fertile and charming on the whole
globe, would engage the serious attention
of the government and the people of the
United States in any circumstances. In
point of fact, they have concern with it
which is by no means of a wholly sen
timental character. It lies so near to us
as to be only partly separated from our
territory. Our actual pecuniary interest
in it is second only to that of the people
and government of Spain. It is reason
ably estimated that at least from thirty
to fifty million dollars of American cap
ital are Invested in plantations and rail
roading, mining and other business enter
prises on the Island. The volume of trade
between the United States and Cuba,
which in 1889 amounted to about $G4,000.000.
rose in 1896 to about $103,000,000, and in 1894,
the year before the present insurrection
broke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000.
Involved in other Way*,
Besides this large pecuniary stake in
the fortunes of Cuba, tne United States
finds itself inextricably involved in the
present contest in other ways, both vex
atious and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country and
indirectly promote the insurrection by
public meetings, by the purchase, an 1
shipment of arms, and by other moans
which the spirit of our institutions and
the tenor of our laws do not permit, and
made these the subjects of criminal pros
ecution. Some of them, thoroughly Cu
bans at heart and in all their feelings and
interests, have taken out papers and are
naturalized citizens of the United States,
a proceeding resorted to with a view to
possible protection by this government,
and not unnecessarily regarded with
much indignation by the country of their
origin.
The insurgents are undoubtedly encour
aged and supported by the widespread
sympathy the people of this country al
ways and instinctively feel in their strug
gle for better government, and which In
the case of the adventurous elements
of its population leans in only too many
instances to active participation In t>"
contest. The result is that the government
is constantly called upon to protect Amer
ican citizens, to claim damages for in
juries to person and property, now esti
mated at many millions of dollars, and
to ask explanations and apologies for the
acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for
the repression of the rebellion sometime:-!
blinds them to the Immunities belonging
to the unoffending citizens of a friendly
power.
On FilllmHterliiK.
It follows *rcm the same causes that
the United States Is compelled to an act
ive policy along the line of sea coast
against unlawful expeditions, the escape
of which the utmost vigilance will not
always suffice to prevent. These inevi
table entanglements of the United States
with the rebellion in Cuba, the large
American property affected, and consid
erations of philanthropy and with hu
manity in general, have led to a vehement
demand in various quarters for some sort
of positive intervention on the part of the
United States.
Can't RecoßTnlze IlelllKerency.
It was at first proposed that belliger
ent rights should be accorded the m
surgents, a proposition no longer weighed
because untimely and impracticable, an
operation clearly perilous and injurious to
our Interests. It has since been and la
now sometimes contended that the inde
pendence of the insurgents should be
recognized, but imperfect and restricted
as the Spanish government of the island
may be, no other exists there unless the
will of the military officer in temporary
command of the insurgents can be dig
nified as a species of government. It is
new also suggested that the United State*
should buy the island, a suggestion pos
sibly worthy of consideration if there were
any evidences of a desire or willingness
on the part of Spain to entertain such a
proposal. It Is urged, finally, that all
other methods failing, the existing Inter
necine strife in Cuba should be terminat
ed by our intervention, even at the cost
of. war between the United States and
Spain—a war which its advocates confi
dently prophesy could neither be large In
its proportions nor doubtful in Its Issue.
The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has, nevertheless, a character to
maintain as a nation, which plainly dic
i tates that right, and not might, should be
the rule of its conduct.
Have Territory Enongh.
Further, though the United States Is
not a nation to which peace Is a neces
sity, It is in truth the most pacific of
powers, and desires nothing so much as
to live In amity with all the world. Its
own ample and diversified domains, satis
fying all possible longings for territory,
precludes all claims of conquest and pre
vents any casting of covetous eyes upon
neighboring regions, however attractive.
That our conduct toward Spain and her
dominions has constituted no exception
to this national disposition is made man
ifest by the course of our government,
not only thus far during the nr*
insurrection, but during the 10 y ear^ nt
followed the rising at Yara in S
other great power, it may safely be J?
under circumstances of similar * ,d'
Jty, would have manifested the sam^
straint and the same patient enduranct
It may also be said that this persS
attitude of the United States' towa J
Spain in connection with Cuba unnm>7
tionably evinces no slight respect and ll'
gard for Spain on the part of the AnVri
can people. They, In truth, do not fnr
gee her connection with the discovery
the western hemisphere, nor do they un
der-estimate the great qualities of ihl
Spanish people, nor fall to fully recoil
their splendid patriotism and their chi
valrous devotion to the national honor
They view with wonder and admiration
the cheerful resolution with which large
bodies of men are sent across thousands
of miles of ocean and an enormous debt
accumulateu by the country in possea
slon of the gem of the Antilles. Cuba
may still hold its place in the Spanish
crown, and yet neither the government
nor the people in the United States have
shut their eyes to the course of Spain m
Cuba, or have failed to realize the ex
pense. The conceded grievances whhh
have led to the present revolt from the
authority of Spain, grievances admitted
by the queen regent and by the cortes
voiced by the most patriotic and enlight
ened of Spanish statesmen without re
gard to party, are demonstrated by r<*.
forms proposed by the executive and ip
proved by the legislative branch of the
Spanish government. It Is In the assumed
temper and disposition of the Spanish gov
ernment to remedy these grievances, for
tified by indications of Influential public
opinion in Spain, that this government
has hoped to discover the most promising
and effective means of composing the
present strife, with honor and advant
age to Spain, and with the achievement
of all the responsible objects of the in
surrection.
Home Hnl<» Suirircstrd.
It would seem that if Spain should of
fer to Cuba genuine autonomy—a meas
ure of home rule, which, while preserving
the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy
all rational requirements of her Spanish
subjects—there should be no just reason
why thi- pacification of the island might
not be effected on that basis. 3uch a
result would appear to be In the true
Interest of all concerned. It would stop
at once the. conflict which Is now con
suming the resources of the Island, and
making It worthless for whichever party
may ultimately prevail. It would keop
intact, the possessions of Spain without
touching her honor, which wlil be up
held, rath'-r than impugned, by the ade
quate redress of admitted grievances. It
would put the prosperity of the island \ai
the fortunes of Its Inhabitants wltnln
the crown control without severing the
natural and ancient ties which bind them
to the mother country, and would yet
enable them to test their capacity for
self-government under the most favora
ble conditions.

It has been objected on the one side that
Spain would not promise autonomy until her in
surgent subjects laid down their arms; on the
other side that promised autonomy however 116
--eral. Is Insufficient, because without assurance
of the promise being fulfilled. But the reason
ableness of the requirement by Spain of uncon
ditional surrender on the part of the lnsurf el
Cubans before their autonomy is conceded, is
not altogether apparent. It Ignores Important
features of the situation; the stability
years' duration has given to the Insurrection,
the feasibility of Its indefinite prolongation in
the nature of things as shown by past expert
ence; the utter and Imminent ruin of the lsiana
unless the present strife is speedily composeo.
and above all, the rank abuses which all pax
ties in Spain, all branches of her government
and all her leading public men concede to ci
