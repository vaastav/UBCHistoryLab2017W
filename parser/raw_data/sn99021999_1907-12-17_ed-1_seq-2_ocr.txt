President Raoaevelt Delighted.
The president received all the admirals
a ad captains on board the. Mayflower, but
made no speech. The occasion he felt did
not require one, as the setting out of the
fleet is regarded merelly as a detail of
naval practice and training. But to the
guests of his yacht the president expressed
his unfeigned delight at the showing made
by the magnificent fleet.
Facing the quarter deck. In his enthus
iasm and smiling In .characteristic fashion,
the president frequently exclaimed:
"Did you ever see such a fleet T And such
a day.",
"It ought to make us all feel proud."

for nearly five minutes, during which 'time
the admiral's head was dipping affirmative
nods as though acknowledging instructions.
During the reception the - president sent
for Seaman William Chandler, coxswain of
the Louisiana, his special greetings.. The
Louisiana Is the ship on which the presi
dent and Mrs. Roosevelt made their return
trip from the Isthmus of Panama. ' The
sailor was presented by the president to
Mrs. Roosevelt and then after the embar
rassed coxswain had taken his leave the
president said:
Enlisted Men Are "Ballr."
"I tell you our enlisted men are every
thing, they are perfectly bully and they
are always up to everything required of
them."
Each departing admiral and captain was
wished "the best of luck, old fellow, and
goodbye."
The fleet sailed from its anchorage
shortly arten 10 o'clock. There was not the
slightest hitch In any detail of the carefully
planned program.
After the Connecticut steamed from the
crowded government pier at Old Point,
the band on the quarterdeck played "The
Girl I Left Behind Me," and "Auld Lang
Byne," there were great cheers from the
shore and a lively screeching1 of whistles
from the excursion fleet. ,

Old Point Comfort, at ;10 .o'clock
r.g. Ita arrival belna- innounonl
by the firing of the national salute of
twenty-one guns from the fleet, which was
distinctly heard In Norfolk, twenty miles
distant. The weather is beautiful and all
conditions for the president's final recep
tion aboard the Mayflower to the flag and
line officers of the fleet and the departure
of the ships could not be more auspicious.
The Mayflower swung around the waUr
battery of Fortress Monroe and Into Hamp.
ton Roads shortly after 8 o'clock. The
saluting guns of the army post were the
flrst to signal tho arrival of the president
and his party. Twenty-one times the can
non overlooking the picturesque moat of
the famous army stronghold voiced their
notes of welcome. The white naval yacht
kept silently on Its way. accepting the
salute as its due and as requiring no out
ward form of reeognklon.
"Coodhr and Good I.nck."
Abosrd the sixteen warships, at 'anchor
a mile further up the roads, bugles had
already begun to summon officers and
crews to quarters. Most of the men aboard
the vessels had been railed several times
In the psst to welcome the president, but
there was a special significance to today's
ceremony. It was not a time stmply to
look pretty on parade, but coupled. fth It
was a note of "good by and gyfi uck,"

long lines, the flagship. Connecticut and
Minnesota standing respectively at the head
of the shore and. outbound columns. Like
players at some giant game of "London
bridge" the twin battleships stood with fig
urative arms overclasped waiting for the
Mayflower to pass beneath and down the
lane to meet the other ships which werej
paired on opposite sides and reached full
two miles away.
Each ship was gaily dressnd from Jack
staff to flat post, the long lines of vari
colored bits of bunting fluttering In the
early morning breete, first In an almost
perpendicular rise from the stem to the
signal yards surmounting the fore fighting
top, then reaching straight back to the
after top and down again to the stern rail
of the quarter deck. Black smoke pouring
frem every funnel indicated that the engi
neers' forces were tiuildlng up stenm for the
first stcD In the memorable voyage.
Admiral's Skip Speaks First.
The Connecticut, flying the flag of Rear
Admiral Evans, commander-in-chief of the
expedition, was first to speak the presi
dent. Its starboard and port saluting guns
began alternatively to proclaim their re
spect and duty to the nation's chief. Fol
lowing the motions of the flagship, as It
Is expressed In the navy, the other ships
took up the firing and In less than two
minutes' time 836 guns had boomed. A play
at mlmlo warfare by the finest fleet the
American navy has ever boasted could not
have produced a more spectacular effect.
The smoke of battle for a time enveloped
the fleet and the smell of gunpowder filled
the air.
Again, without formal recognition of trie
honors bestowed, the Mayflower entered
the warship lane and proceeded slowly to
a point about midway of the assembled
fleet, let go Its anchors and swung party
around, to face the flow of the ebbing
tide.
No sooner had It done so than the tor
pedo launch of the Connecticut with Ad
miral Evans and his staff on board, was
darting swiftly to Its side. Making the
aftergsngway, the officers tn all the regalia
of. special full dress uniform, repaired on
board the yacht to pay their respects to
the president. He received them on the
quarterdeck and the exchange of greetings
was more hearty than fprmal.
Reception on Mayflower.
Following the Connecticut's lead, the
launches from all of the other ships were
aoon swarming about the Mayflower. From
the Minnesota came the steam barge of
Rear Admiral C. M. Thomas, commander of
the second squadron; from the Georgia
there was the barge of Rear Admiral Wil
liam. II. Emory, commander of the second
division, and from the Alabama came Rear
Admiral C. S. Sperry, commanding the
fourth division. Each admiral was accom
panied by his staff. The captains -commanding
the sixteen ships followed the flag
Officers to the Mayflower and with their
arrival the , reception reached its climax.
These ceremonies were few and within half
an hour after Admiral Evans had first
stepped upon the quarterdeck of the yacht,
all of the officers were once more In their
danchlng launches returning to their ships.
The last good byes had been said, the
president's last wishes of good luck had
been uttered.
Suddenly the slgnag yards of the Connect
icut flashed the message:
"Get under way Immediately, following
the motions of the flagship."
Orders volleyed from each vessel's bridge.
They were covcyed by warning bells to
engine rooms, through the musical notes
of half a score of bugles and shrill whis
tles of the bo-'sun's pipes. Dressing ' lines
were hauled in and as they tumbled to
the decks the 'ships . were- robbed of gala
attire. Everything was In .cruising trim
now and the. time for-play was past. .

And Charles. ' As tho Mayflower - retreated
down the warship lane each vessel It
passed manned the rail with bluejackets,
all of whom stood at attention.
Meantime tho giant 'cranes on board the
war vessels were reaching out and picking
up tho steam launches and running boats
and storing them snugly In their berths
up In the superstructure and safe from the
crashing boom of storm waves to be en
countered on the trip.
Next from the ships came the whir and
hiss of steam driven windlasses and the
grinding clank of lifting anchor chains
whose massive links were of six-inch bent
steel. Sixty fathoms of chain had been
laid out on each ship. This Is ten. times
tho depth of the roadstead channel, but
necessary to keep the vessels free from
fouling in the swinging currents of the
tide. With the command "heave 'er up"
the work of raising anchors had begun al
most simultaneously on each of the six
teen ships. Big streams of water were
poured upon the climbing chain links, strip
ping them of all sand and harbor mud as
they rose from the surface.
Flagship First Under War.
The Connecticut, head of the column, and
the Other ships of the first division, the
Kansas, the Vermont and the Louisiana.
were the first to get their anchors folded
on their bows. Then came for each navi
gator and captain a bit of difficult maneu
vering at close quarters. The sweep of the
ebbing, tide turned every ship's stem to
the weVt, 'and 'It was necessary to swing
each vessel around to take' position for the
eastward . start to the capes. One by one
the other- armorclada hoisted tliuir post
tlon pennants to the fore truck, signifying
that they were ready to get under way.
The flagships of each of the three dl
visions subordinate to the flrst did not
hoist their pennants until the last anchor
chains of the Immediate command were
stowed. The beat of giant copper-bladed
twin propellers churned tho roadstead
waters to milky white as they maneuvered
'or tne atarx.
' When at last all sixteen ahlps were in
position. In single column "natural order
and distance," 400 yards apart, the engine
room Indicators,- far down In the depths
of the steel-protected decks, showed "full
speed ahead." For the purposes of this
cruise full speed means an easy pace o
ten knots an hour, and It was on this
sis that the ships bade farewell to ilia
great crowds gathered on the Old Poln
shore and moved away from their famllla
anchorage.
As the big vessels gained headway they,
one after another, picked up their "bones
from the furrowed wake of the flagship.

Abreast the presidential yacht the Con
necticut began its series of salutes. The
men at the rails, at the word of command,
raised right hands to caps and held them
there until the Mayfloflw "er was cleared.
On the forward bridge Captain Hugd Os
terhaus and the fleet navigating officer
came to attention with a flourish of swords.
Admiral Evans ' and the members of his
staff sainted similarly In turn from the
afterbrldge, white the -marine guard, -tvlth
polished rifles, stood motionless at "present
arms." ' ' ' r
Drums aboard the" flagship were ruffling
their tokens of respect when at last came
the strains of the "Star Spangled Banner"
floating across the waves.
Just beyond the Mayflower the saluting
annonrwere brought into 'play and with

farewell me wage, the white globules of

It was particularly fitting that the Con
necticut should leaH the great fleet ever
sent 'from American shores. It Is the prbd-
uct from stem to stern, from keel plate to
fighting top. of the Ahjerican naval estab-
shment. Designed at the Navy depart
ment In Washington and built at the Brook
navy yard, the Connecticut represents the
highest type of fighting machine the navy
has ever known. Its', else, measured by
ater the great hull displaces and not by

The energy of Its twin reciprocating en-
lnes Is rated at .16,500 horse-power and its

easily exceeded on (ts trial trip.
In armor the Connecticut Is belted with
leven Inches of wellnigh Invulnerable steel

tapers away gradually to four Inches at

by several Inches of hardened steel, its

It Would Vt equaTly effective as a 'national
policy. 'Xs matters stand today, a railroad
corporation Is In no way required to accel

lines. A carload of grain has been known
to bo six weeks on the road between Chi
cago and Washington. The consignee lost
heavily because of the delay, yet he could
obtain no redress. The particular, car re
ferred to happened to reach Washington
one Thursday afternoon and was not un
loaded until the following Monday. . The

Seed Will Be On Time.
On the morning of November 6 fire de
stroyed practically all tha seed stored In
the warehouse of the Agricultural depart
ment, these seeds being Intended for the
annual spring distribution by senators and
members of the house among their constit
uents. At the time stories were written that
this loss of seeds would entail consider
able inconvenience to the farmers and truck
gardeners who yearly had depended on the
government for their annual supply of
seeds. However, the loss will be replaced
Immediately and the seeds go out as usual,
or rather almost as promptly as though the
Are had not occurred. Secretary of Agri
culture Wilson has officially Informed con
gress of tho loss and requests an emer
gency appropriation of $j0,Xk). This re
quest to repair damage by Are will un
doubtedly bo one of the first bills to go
through congress after the holiday recess
and as Btated there -will be scarcely a
perceptible delay In the annual distribution
of seeds by the government.
