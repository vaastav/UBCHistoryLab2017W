LILLEY ENTERTAINS STAFF.
Yonc Roosevelt Not Present at Din
ner Given Last Evening.
Hartford, Dec 16. Governor-elect
George D. Mlley entertained infor
mally at dinner hint evening at the
Allyn house men who are to serve on
his staff for the coming two years.
The gathering was arranged hurried
ly yesterday by Congressman Mlley,
but the majority of staff members
were able to accept the invitation,
although the adjutant general,
George M. Cole, Adjutant General
William 10. F. Landers, Assistant
Quartermaster General M. .1. Wise
and Colonel J. Moss Ives were in
Mcrideu, in attendance at the armory
dedication exercises, as members of
Governor Woodruff's staff.
Those present besides the host
and the new executive secretary. Al
derman CVharles A. Goodwin of this
city, were, using their titles which
i hey are soon to read clear: Quar
termaster General Robert O. Eaton of
Xorth Haven, Sgureon General 1". fi.
Graves of AYaterbury, Commissary
General Andrew N'. Shepard of Port
land, Paymaster General Klmer II.
Havens of Bridgeport, Major Archi
bald E. Rice of Waterbury, Major
Louis M. I'llman of New Haven and
Lieutenant Commander F. A. P.art
lett of Bridgeport. The only absen
tee, besides those whose duties took
them to Meriden was Major Theodore
Koosevelt, Jr, of Enfield, from whom
Congressman Mlley received a tele
gram of regret. There were no
speeches, the purpose of the gather
ing being to have the men become
better acquainted with one another
and talk over maters of common in
terest, including the subject of uni
forms. Some Odd Animals.
Many curious animals haunt the
marshy parts of South America north
nf the pampas. Frogs, big and fero
cious fthe cenitophyrs). given to mak
ing virions springs when closely Ap
proached; the capybara, a cavy "con
tented with the bulk of a sheep;" the
huge, coypu rat and the swarthy, pis
like tapir are frequently seen.
Along the forest margins troops of
peccaries are often met with, occa
sionally the jaguar, sometimes the pu
ma, likewise that toothless curiosity,
the great ant bear, long in claw, long
nosed and remarkably long tongued.
Very plentiful, too, are those ''UMle
knights in scaly armor," the quaint,
waddling armadillos. Long toed Jaca
nas pace about upon the floating
leaves.
A familiar object Is the great Jabini,
a stork with a preference for the deso
late lagoons, where It may often be
observed statuesque on oue leg and
wrapped In prospeetion. Edinburgh

Strenuous Methods of Healing.
Papuan medicine men are regarded
with great respect by the natives.
Those I have met certainly seemed en
ergetic and hardworking. They sit
close to the patient, massaging the seat
at pain with much vigor, and, while
they are thus rubbing, make a noise
with their Hps rather like that which
a groom makes when rubblug down a
horse. The process Is a tiring one,
and the medicine man stops at Inter
nals to drink hot water In which tnro
has been boiled. Ills object is to ex
tract some mysterious foreign sub
stance from the sick man's body, and
If he succeeds In this he receives a
fee; otherwise he gets nothing. "No
'nre, no pay." Is apparently the Pa
puan sufferer's motto. Wide World

Jury in (be Murder Case al
Barllord Relorned Verdicl
ol Gnlily
SENTENCE TO MORROW
Hartford, Dec 16. After beins
"hung uii" for nearly 20 hours the
jury in the murder case of Peter
Kuboka and .lohn Saverock returned
a verdict of guilty In the lirst degree
against both prisoners at 1 I o'clock
to-day. Sentence will be pronounc
ed by Judge Case at 10 o'clock
Thursday morning.
The verdict was a surprise at it
was supposed that owing to a dis
agreement over the degree, in one of
the cases, a compromise verdict
would result. The jury loked tired
after it's all night session. At 7:30
when still apparently hopelessly di
vided, they were taken to breakfast,
and upon resuming deliberations one
hour later, the earnest pleadings of
some members could be heard in sec
tions of the court room
After bei;i discharged none of the
jurymen would discuss their doings
in the jury room. They had appar
ently agreed not to discuss their de
liberations with the reporters.
The prevailin gopinion is that a
verdict in the case of Saverock was
kuickiy reached and that the rest of
the time was devoted to bringing
about a unanimous sentiment in the
case of Kuboka, as the evidence
showed that the fatal wound bad
ben inflicted by Saverock.
The victim of the crime, which
was committed in Glastonbury Octo
ber 15. was Mike Viedok. He was
stabbed to iea.V.1 during a quarrel
over a dog. SaYeroek's attorney ad

CONFEDERATE FLAGS.
The Stars and Bars and Then the Red
Battlefiag.
The first Confederate flag was the
stars and bars, a blue field and three
stripes, one white and two red, and
on the blue field seven white stars In
I a circle, a star for each state that np
to that time had seceded. In battle,
however. It wns seen that this banner
bore altogether too close a resemblance
to the stars and stripes, and thus
there came Into use the Confederate
battlefiag, the origin of which seems
to have been as follows:
This is the statement of General
William I.. Cabell: "When the Con
federate army commanded by General
Beauregard and the Federal army con
fronted each other at Manassas, It was
seen that the Confederate flag and the
stars and stripes looked at a distance
so much alike that It was hard to dis
tinguish one from the other. Genera
Beauregard, thinking that serious mis
takes might be made In recognizing
our troops, after the battle of July 18,
at Blackburn Ford, ordered that a
small badge should be worn on the left
shoulder by our troops and. as I was
chief quartermaster, ordered me to
purchase a large amount of red flan
nel and to distribute It to each regi
ment." This Confederate battlefiag was
adopted In September, 3801. and was
designed by Generals Johnston and
Beauregard. Ked was Its color, with a
blue St. Andrew's cross reaching from
corner to corner and white stars on
the cross representing the different
southern states. The women of the
south made these flags by hundreds
out of their red and blue silk dresses.
Miss Constance Cary, who afterward
became Mrs. Burton Harrison, the well
known noTelist, was one of the three
southern girls who made the first three
battleflags. " "
ORIENTAL RUGS.
Made to Resemble the Antiques by
Chemical Washings.
The United States buys annually
many thousand dollars' worth of what
are known to the professiou as wash
ed nigs. Brightly colored oriental rugs
sometimes are washed with a solution
of chloride of lime, a treatment which
partly bleaches the colors and imparts
a'soft appearance to the rug.
This chemical treatment Is a process
of washing which produces the effect
of age and a peculiar sheen to the sur
face, which is pointed out by the un
scrupulous dealer as a proof of supe
rior quality. The fact is that the proc
ess of washing as described Invariably
weakens and In some Instances de
stroys the materials of the rug.
The progressive effect of the chem
icals on the materials In the rug is
this: The chlorine gas contained in the
chloride of lime attracts oxygen and
moisture from the air, by which muri
atic acid is formed. This eats away
the vitals of the rug. Sooner or later
the wool and cotton In the rug become
brittle ami thus weakeu the warp and
deteriorate the wool.
When this deterioration Is complete
the pile of the rng may be swept away
by the ordinary process of sweeping,
and the warp, which Is the foundation
of the rug, becomes so weak that boles
appear here and there, and noon the
rng is worthless.
It not seldom happens that a Persian
rug Is too staring In some bright hue,
perhaps red. and Is not salable. The
unscrupnlons dealer will subject the
rug to a series of washings in chem
ically prepared water. , In this way he

One Heir to the Properly Has I'.ecn.
Heard From.
Regarding the alleged disappear
ance of a house, off the estate of ;h
late Mary .lane Piatt on Stono street,
it. now seems that there never was a
house on the property. Tlierj skeins
to have been an agreement botwef n
Mrs Piatt und a neighbor by which
she was to move a house onto the
property in question and that the
never did so. The assessors having
been led to believe that there was a
house on the land listed the properly
at $1100 and on that :iiouut taxis
had been paid for some time. When
the appraisers appointed by the dis
trict, court looked over the properly
in order to have it sold for taxes
amounting to f UO, they lulled io find
a house there and conclude 1 that :t
had been taken piece hie.il off I lie
land. The heir whose cousin.; to pay
the taxes caused the foreclosure of
the tax lien is supposed lo be Jacob

DIKES IN GERMANY.
They Are Built With Great Care and
Exactness.
When a dike is to be built and they
are still In places making dikes It is
first mapped out by the neatly sharp
ened stakes, a long straight causeway
leading out from shore and widening
into a rounded head which abuts on
the red line of the channel. Then a
ground sill or foundation mattress of
willows is wovun and sunk at this
lead und pinned down and held in
place by the sharpened pegs. Then
wattles are woven and sand filled In,
and in places rock, and then, rounding
up neatly out of the water and form
ing a tight covering to the whole, the
hand squared blocks of stone are laid,
ns closely ns a city pavement, all over
the head and back along the neck to
the old shore. It Is as permanent and
stable as the Harvard stadium, the
dike so built, and the river, abandon
ing the space back of the tip to slack
water or to tie fi!ed In with sand,
flows on with entire grace in the re
stricted channel beyond the tip.
The care and exactness with which
these dikes are made would bo laugh
able If It were not so successful. In a
land where hand labor Is very cheap
days iire devoted to doing what in
America would be roughly cast by ma
chinery in a couple of hours. But the
result Is so admirable that one re
members regretfully the ugly pile
dikes, the horrid fringes of the Im
proved "off channel" banks of the Mis
sissippi. Where the dikes have accomplished
their purpose and generally on the
banks opposite to them the river Is
revetted nbore middle water. This,
too, is done with the hand squared
stones, and as a result the Elbe where
completely finished resembles a broad
canal between stone lined banks, the
stone rising a few feet above the wa
ter, and above It the green slope of the
fields or a fringe of willows. It Is all
peaceful, complete and generally beau
tiful, with at least the beauty of util
ity where It lacks that of rnggeduess
and wildness. Boston Transcript.

TAFT MAKES PEACE
PACT WITH GOMFERS
Speaks For Labor Unions anil
Says Hatchet Is Buried,
New York, Dei-. 10. Speaking after
Samuel Gompers, John Mitchell and
Andrew Carnegie beore the Civic
federation, President Elect Taft said:
"looking about me. 1 see some who
before election it would not have peeii
well for me to associate with, but all
that happened before the election is a
closed book. I shall be the president
of all the people.
' Time was when everybody who em
ployed labor was opposed to labor
unions. Time was when these organi
zations were regarded as a menace.
That time now has largely passed
away, and the man who today objects
to the organization of labor should be
relegated to the last century. Labor
unions have done marvels for labor
and in the future will do more.
'"Labor unions will encourage work
Ingineu not to a level down, but to a
level up and will exemplify that those
who lead In energy will have the lead
ership and the reward.
"1 am not quite ready ell her to part
with the antitrust or Sherman law. I
will agree that it probably needs
amendment, but I do not think the
amendments should be to extensive.
It is more important to enforce that
law than o repeal it.
"I believe that combinations of capi
tal are absolutely necessary to the
progress of the business world, but I
Insist that these combinations may be
abused to the detriment of the public,
and we must have something on lhe
statute books to prevent and punish
those abuses.
"It has been exceedingly agreeable to
me to meet here tonight Mr. Gompers,
.Mr. Mitchell and other labor leaders.
I trust that they know that what hap
pened before the election so fur as my
conduct to any citizen of the United
States as president Is concerned is
wippd out as if it never was. I thank
Mr. Gompers for saying that 1 am to

TEACHERS AFTER HIM.
Alderman Scully Must Explain How
to Live on Small Salary.
They're after the scalp of Presi
dent Martin Scully of the hoard of
aldermen. They threaten lo do dire
things to the presiding officer of the
nldermanic body and siiow him 'who's
who before they are through with
him. The school teachers' associa
tion is highly indignant over the
statement of President Scully that
the teachers of Waterbury should be
able to live very decently on the sal
aries which they are now receiving.
The press committee will meet this
evening and outline their plan of
campaign so the alderman from the
fifth should get prepared.
It is all the result of that midnight
session of the aldermen on Monday
evening during which Dr Hayes
showed that a girl teaching school
for $400 a year is about $30 in debt
at the end of the year. Chairman
Scully and Dr Hayes did- not agree,
and the former stated that there
were many girls in this city, much
brighter than school teachers, who
were compelled to live on a much
smaller salary than the teachers are
now receiving. lie furthermore stat
ed that good board could be procured
for less than $6 a week which is the
rock bottom figure, according to the
doctor.
Xow it is hinted that some of the
teachers intend to interview some of
the boarding mistresses of the city
and find out just how much it costs
a teacher for her board and room.
Then they're going to fire some hot
shot at Mr Scully. They may even
beard the linn in his den anrl swoop
down upon the alderman while he is
presiding at the alderliianic meeting
to-morrow evening.
The press committee has Michael
O. Donovan, instructor of English at
Crosby high, as chairman, and with
Doctor Hayes as their champion.
President Scully will find himself tip
against a formidable attack. Presi
dent Scully is evidently prepared te
meet the enemy and substantiate his
statement with fads and figures.

Uc Tells my He Waols Bis
Children Taken From Tbelr

NOT AFTER THE MONEY
Paris. Dec., I ti. The hearing of
the suit brought by Count Bonl de
Castellane against lh( Princess de
Sagan. his former wife, in which he
petitions that the custody of his
three children h,. given lo his moth
er, the Muniuise de Castellane, was
continued in this city to-day. M.
Bonnelt was heard in rejoinder for
the count. He read a letter from
the count renouncing the petition
for $i;o,0imi annually for the main
tenance of lb,, children but Insist
ing more emphatically than ever
that the children be confided to
the care of his mother. The re
mand camp as a surprise In spite of
the fact that such a course wa in
dicated at Ilie close (if the first
hearing of the case.
The letter of the Count is ad
dressed to M. iionneii and it. is
couched in an eloquent phraseology
or outraged manhood. Il begins:
"Indignant, at the perfidious and ly
ing insinuations of the princess and
her family representing ihat my
only desire is to obtain a big allow
ance I now ask for myself and my
children: T renounce with pleasure
tlip request for an allowance."
The count calls M. Honneit to
witness with what outraged feelings
he rejected lhe pecuniary offers of
the Prince and Princess de Sagan
and George Could, the princess'
brother.
"The new and unexpected atti
tude of Ceorge Gould." de Castel
lane writes-, who regards this suit,
simply as a vulgar affair of money
and who believes Ihat. his golden
authority can glid the marriage of
his sister with a tarnished man com
pels me more strongly than ever to
insist on the wiih'drawal of the
children from the house of which
the princess is the ornament and
from surroundings where they will
learn only one thing that honor is
nothing and money everything, that
moey covers every baseness and
l hat it will buy every conscience.
"The decision I have taken will
show tbe court the sole purpose
which inspires me, my jarents and
my relatives. We are without for
tunes and upon the question of
money wP do not hoid the same
theories as do the Goulds; concern
ing the education of French vout.hs.
we have other ideas than those of
the de Sagans. My parents will aid
me lo bring up these three inno
