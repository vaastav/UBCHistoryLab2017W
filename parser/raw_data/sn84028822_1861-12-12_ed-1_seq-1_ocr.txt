PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fcllow-citlxens of the Senate
and Jfousc o liqnesentathm :
In tho midst of unprecedented political
troubles wo havo cause of groat grntitudo
to God for unusual good health and most
abundant harvests. You will not bo sur
prised to learn that in tho peculiar oxo
gedcics of tho times our intcieourso with
forejen, tuitions ' has been attended with
proiounu souciiuuo, ciutiy turned upon
our own domestic affairs.
THE REBELLION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE.
. kncu. r
A .'disloyal portion ofi thoi Amoricnn
psoplo lmvo, during tho wholo year, been
cngagod in au attempt to divido and des
troy tho Union. A nation which endures
factiotjs, dquicstic, divisions' is, Exposed to
disrespect' abroad, and 0110 party, or both.
. . . J. . . 1
is suro, sooner or later, to invoko foreigti
intervention. Nations thus tempted to
intorfero aro not always ablo to resist tho
counsels of scorning expediency nnd tin
genorous ambition, although measures

Tho disloyal citizens of tho United1
States who lmvo offered tho ruin of our
country in reword for tho aid and com
fort which thoy havo invoked abroad,
have received loss patronngo nnd encour
agement than thoy probably expected.
If it wcro just to suppopo, ns tho insurg
ents lmvo seemed to assume, that foreign
nations in this caso, disregarding all nior
nl, social and treaty obligations, would
act solely and selfishly for tho most
hpecdy-restoration of commerce,' includ
ing specially, tho acquisition of cotton,
theso nations appear os yet not to havo
seen their way to thoir object more direct
ly or clearly through tho destruction than
through tho preservation of tho Union.
If wo. could dnro to beliovo that foreign
Motions are actuated by no higher prinei-"
plo than this lam quito sure a second ar
gument could bo mado to show that thay
could roach their oiin more readily by
aiding to crush this rebellion than by giv
ing encouragement to tho principle lover
relied on by it. Tho exciting of foreign
nations, to hostility against us, as already
intimated, is the otnbarrassmoiU of com
merce. These notions, however, not im
probably saw from tho first that it was
tho Union which mado as well our for
eign as our domostio commerce. Thoy
can scarcely fail to porccivo that tho ef
fort for disunion produces tho existing
difficulty, nnd that 0110 strong nation
promises more durable peace, and n more
extensivo, vnluablo and reliable commorco
than tho snmo nation broken into hostile
fragments. It is. not my purpose to re
view our discussions with foreign States,
heeauso whatever might ba their wishes,
or dispositions, tho integrity of our coun
try nnd tho stability ol our Government
mainly depciuu not upon them, but up
on tho loyalty, patriotism, viituo and in
tolligenco of the American people. Tho
correspondence itt-clf, with the iibual res
cr vat ion, is herewith submitted. I ven
turo to hopo that it will appear that wo
havo practiced prudenco nnd liberality
towards lorciKn powers nvcrtins' causes
of irritation, and with firmness maintain
ing our own rights nnd honor. Since,
however, it is apparent here, ns in every
othor State, loroign dangers necessarily
attend domestic dfficulties, I recommend
that adequate and ample measures bo
ndoptcd for maintaining tho public de
fences on ovory sido ; while under this
general recommendation provision for
defending our coast lino readily oecufTto

OUR DEFENCES.
I also, in the samo connection, nsk tho
attention of Congrcsi to our great lakes
nnd rivers.,. It is believed that somo for
tifications nnd depots of arms and muni
tions, with harbor and navigation im
provements, at well selected points upon
theso, would bo of groat importance to
tho national dofonco and preservation,
I nsk attention to tho views of tho Sec
retary of War, expressed in his report on
tho samo coneral subject. 1 deem it of
importance that tho loyal regions of East
Tounossco nnd Wcstorn Noith Carolina
should bo connected with Kentucky nnd
othor faithful parts of the Union by rail
road. I therefore recommend ns a mili
tary measure, that Congress provide for
tho construction of such a road as speed
ily as possible Kentucky will no doubt
co-operato, and through hor Legislature
mako tho most judicious solcction of tho
line.. Tho northern terminus must con
nect with somo existing railroad, and
whether tho routo 6ball be fronr Lexing
ton or Nicholasvillo to Cumberland Gap,
or fromLobanon to tho Tennossco liny, in
tho direction of Knoxvillo, or somo still
different lino, can easily bo determined.
Kentucky nnd tho Qonornl Government
co-oporating, the woru can uo compieioci
in n vcrv short time, nnd when done will
not only bo of vast present usefulness, but
also an availablo pormanent improvement

THE INDEPENDENCE OF HAYTI AND LIBERIA.
If any good reason exists why wo
should porsovcrc longer in withholding
our recognition of' tho independence and
sovereignty of Ilaj'ti and Liberia, I am
unnblo to discern it. Unwilling, how
ever, to inaugurate a novel policy in re
gard to t' cm without the approbation of
Longress, I submit tor yonr consideration
tho expediency of an appropriation for
maintaining a Ohargo d' Affaires near
each of thebo Slates. It does not admit
of doubt that important commercial ad
vantages might bo secured by favorable
treaties with them.
THE TREASURY.
Tho operations of tho Treasury during
tho period which has elapsed sinco yom
adjournment, havo been conducted with
signal success. Tho patriotism of tho
people has placed at the disposal of tho
Government tho largo menus demanded
by the public oxegencies. Much of tho
National Loan has been taken by citi
zens ol tho industrial classes, whoso con
fidence 111 their country's faith nnd zeal
for their country s dehvernuco from its
present peril, havo induced them to con
tribute to tho Government tho wholo of
their limited acquisitions. This fnct im
poses peculiar obligation to economy in
disbursement nnd oneigy in action.
The rovenuo from all sources, includ
ing loans for tho financial year ending on
the 30th of June, 1801, was $80,835,-
900 27, nnd tho expenditures for tho same
period, including payments on ncconnt
of the public debt, were SS1,57S,0:U 34;
leaving n balanco in the Treasury on the
1st of July, of $l2,i57,00r) 80 for tho
first quaiter of tho financial year cndiiij
the 30th of So t., 1SG1.
The receipts from all sources, includ
ing tho balance from July 1st, were $102,
532,500 27, nnd the expenses, 898,239,
iiiii III); leaving a balanco on tlio 1st ol
October, 1801, of 4,202,770 IS. Esti
mates for the remaining tlneo quarters of
tho year and for the financial year of 18G3,
together ith his viows of the ways and
means of meeting the demands contem
plated by them, will bo submitted to Con
gress by the Secretary of tho Treasury.
It is giatifying to know that the ex
penses mado necessary by tho rebellion
aro not boyond the resources of tho loyal
people, and to believe that the same pat
riotism which. lias thus far sustained tho
Government will continiio to sustain it
until pcaco and union shall again bless
tho land.
THE ARMY.

I respectfully refer to tho report of tho
Secretary of War for infoi motion re
specting tho numerical strength of tho
army, nnd for recommendations having
in viow an iucreaso of its efficiency, nnd
tho woll-boing of tho various branches of
tho service entrusted to his "caso. It is
gratifying to know that tho patriotism of
tho peoplo is equal so tho occasion, nnd
that the number of troops greatly exceed
tho forco which Congress authorized 1110
to call into tho field. 1 refer with pleas
nro to thoso portions of his report which
mako allusion to tho croditablo degrco of
discipline already attained by our troops,
nnd to the excollont sanitary condition of
tho entire army.
Tho recommondntion of tho Secretary
for an organization of tho militia upon a
uniform basis, is a subject of vital im
portance to tho future safety of tho coun
try, and is commended to tho serious at
tention of Congress.
A largo addition to the regular army,
in connection with tho defection that has
so considerably dimiuMied tho nuiiibor of
its officers, gives peculiar importnnco to
his recommendation for increasing the
corp3 of cadets to tho greatest capacity
of tho Military Academy.

THE JUDICIARY.
There nro thrco vacancies on U10 bench
of tho Su prcmo Court. Two by the de
ccaso of Justices Daniels nnd McLean,
nnd 0110 by tho resignation of Justieo
Campbell. I have so far forborno mak
ing any nominations to fill theso vacan
cies for reasons which I will now state.
Two of the outgoing Judges resided with
in tlio btnto now overrun by revolt, so
that if successors wcro appointed in tlu
snmo localities thoy would not bervo up
on their circuits, and many of tho most
competent men there ptobably would not
take tho porsonal hazard of accepting to
servo oven here upon tho supremo bench.
1 novo been unwilling tO'tlirow all tho
appointments noi;thwaid, thus disabling
myself from doing Justice to tho South
on tho reluin cf pence, althpugh I may
remark that to transfer to' ho North, pno
which has heretofore boon in tho South,
would not, with reference to territoiy nnd
population, bo unjust. During tho long
nnd brilliant judicial career of Judgo Mc
Lean, his circuit grew into an empire nl
together too largo for any 0110 JudgQ to
givo the couits therein more than a nom
inal attendance, rising in population from
1.470,000 in 1831, to 0,151,405 in 1800.
Besides this tho country has generally
outgrown our present Judicial system.
If uniformity was at all intended, tho
system requires that nil tho States shall
bo accommodated with Circuit Courts,
attended by Supremo Judges, whilo in
fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kan
sas, Floiida, Texas, California, and Or
egon, havo never had nny such com ts,
nor can this bo well remedied without a
chnngo of the system, becauso tho adding
of Justices to tho Supremo Court, enough
for tho accommodation of all parts of
tho country with Circuit Courts, would
crento a court altogether too dangerous
for a judicial body of any sort, and the
ovil of it be ono that will iucreaso 'ns
new States como into tho Union. Cir
cuit Couits nro useful or thoy aro not use
ful. If useful, no Stato should bo denied
them. lf"not useful, no State should
have them. Let them bo provided for
all, or abolished as to all.
Tlneo nullifications occur to mo hero,
which I think would bo an improvement
upon our present system. Let the Su
premo Couit bo of convenient number in
ovcry event. Then first let the who'o
country bo divided into ciicuits of conve
nient size, tho Supremo Judges to servo
in a number of them corresponding to
their own number, nnd independent Cir
cuit Judges bo provided for nil tho rest ;
or secondly, the onpiemo Judges no re
lieved from Circuit duties, nnd Circuit
Judges provided for all tho Circuits ; or
thirdly dispense with Circuit Courts al
together, leaving the Judicial functions
wholly to tho District Couits, and nn in
dependent Suproino Court.
THE U. S. STATUTES.
:
I respectfully recommend to tho con
sideration of Congress, tho present con
dition of tho statue laws, with tho hope
that Congress will be able to find an
easy remedy for tho many inconvoniences
and evils which constantly embarrass
thoso enggaged in tho practical adminis
tration of them.
Sinco tho organization of tho Govern
ment Congress has enacted somo 5000
acts and joint resolutions which fill more
than G000 closely printed pages, and nro
scattered through many volumes. Many
of theso nets have been drawn in hasto
and without suflicint caution, so that
their provisions are often obscure in
themselves or in conflict with each other,
or at least so doubtful ns to render it
very difficult fur oven tho best informed
persons to ncccrtoin precisely what tho
stotuto in law is.
It seems to mo vcrv impoitnnt that
tho statuto law should bo mado ns plain
nnd intelligiblo-ns possible, and bo re
duced to ns small n compass and may
consist with tho fullues and and provi
sion of tho legislature and tho perspicu
ity of its langungo. Theso well done
would, 1 think, greatly facilitate tho la
bors of thoso whoso duty it is to assist
in tho administration of the laws, and
would bo n lasting benefit to tho people
by placing before them in a more access
ible and intelligible l'oim the law which
so deeply concern their interests and
their duties.
I am informed by somo owhos opin
ion x respect, that nil tho octs of Con
gress now in forco nnd of a permnnont,
general naturo, might bo revised ond re
written so ns to bo embraced in ono vol
ume, or at least two volumes of ordina
ry nnd convenient size; nnd 1 respectful
ly recommend to Congress to consider
tho subject, nnd if my suggestion bo ap
proved, to deviso such a plan as to their
wisdom shall seem mosc proper for tho
attainment of tho proposed.
NORTHERN CLAIMS IN REBEL STATES.
of
Ono of tho unfavorable consqeuonccs
of tho presont insurrection is tho entire
suppression in many places of oil ordin
ary menus of administering civil justieo
by tho officers, nnd in tho forms of existing
law, This is tho caso in wdiolo oiin
part in all tho insurgent States, and
as our armies advanco upon and toko
possession of parts of thoso States, the
practical ovil becomes more apparent.
There nao no couits or olhcers to wliom
tho citizens of othor Stntos may apply
for tho enforcement of their lawful claims
against citizousof tho insurgont States,
and thoro is a vast amount of debt con
btituting such claims. Somo havo cs-

that a pian may bo devised for the

ment. Whether by a voluntary return to
allegiance and order or by tho powor of
onr arms. This, however, is not to be
a permanent institution, but n tempo
rary substitute, and to censo as soon as
tho ordinary courts can bo ro-cstablished
in peace.
CLAIMS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.
It is important that some more con
venient menus should be provided if pos
sible for tho ndjustment of claims ngainst
tho Government, especially in View of
their increased number by reason of the
war.. It is as much tlio duty of tho
Government to render prompt justice n
gainst itself in favor of citizens ns it is
to administer tho snmo between private
individuals. ' Tho investigation nnd nd
justation of all tho claims in their nature
belong to tho Judicial department? be
sides it is apparent that tho attention
of Congress will bo moro than usually
engaged forsomo timo to cdmo with great
national questions. It was intended by
the organization of tho, Court of Claims
mainly to roinovo this branch of businoss
from the halls of Congress; but while tho
.Com t has proved to bo an cfTcctivp nnd
valublo means of investigation, it in a
great degrco fails to efiect tho object of
its creation for want of powor to mnko
its judgment final. Fully aware of the
delicacy, not to say tho danger, of the
subject, 1 commend to yonr careful con
sideration whether this power of making
judgments final may not be properly
given to tho Court, reserving tho right
of appeal on question of law to tho (su
premo Court, with such other provisions
as experience may have shown to be nec
essary.
THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
Postmaster General, tho following being
a summary statement oi tuo condition 01

sonrces during tho fiscal year ending 30.
Juno, 1801, including tho annual perma
nent nppropiiation of $700,000 for the
transportation of frco mail matter was
9,049,290.40, being about two percent
less than the revenuo of ISfiO. Tho ex
penditures were $13,G0G,709.11, show
ing a decrease 01 more man o per cent,
ns compared with those of tlio previous
year, and leaving an excess of expendi
turea over tho revnuo for tho lat fiscal
year over 8557,402 71. The gross rev
enue for tho year ending Juno 30th, 1SG3,
is estimated nt nn increase of four per
cent, on thnt of 1SG1, making 89,382,
000. The total expenditures for 1803
nro estimated deficiency nt812,528,000,
leaving an estimated deficiency of $3,
331,000 to bo supplied from tho Treas
ury, in addition to the,, permanent appropriation.
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
Tho present insurrection shows, I
think, that tho extention of this district
across the Potomac river at tho timo of
establishing tho eapitol hero, was emi
nently wiso, and consequently, that tho
relinquishment of that portion of it which
lies in tho Stato of Virginia, was unwiso
nn 1 dangerous. I submit for your con
sideration expediency of regaining thnt
paitof tho dwtiict and tho restoration
of tho oiiginal boundaries thereof
through negotiation with tho Stato of
THE INTERIOR.
Tho report of tho Secretary of terior,
with the accompanying docu
ments, exhibit the condition of the sev
eral branches of the public business
pertaining to that Dcpaitmcnt. Tho
depressing inllueneo of tho insurrection
have been especially felt in tho operation
of tho Patent and General Land Office.
Tho cosh receipts from the snles of pub
lio lands during the past year havo ex
ceeded tho expenses of onr land system
only about two thousand dollars. The
sales have been entirely suspended in
tho Southern States, while the interrup
tions to the business of the country, nnd
tho diversion of largo numbers of men
from labor to military servico havo ob
btiucted settlements in tho now States
ond Territoiies of tho Northwest.
The roeoiptsof tho Patent Ofiieo havo
declined in nino months, about 100,000
dollars, Kudoring a largo reduction of
tho force employed necessary to mako
it self sustaining. Tho domain! upon the
Pension Offico will bo largely increased
by the insurrection Numerous applica
tions for pensions based upon the caus
alities of tho existing war, lmvo all ready
been mado. There is reason to believe
that many who aro upon the Pension
ltoll nnd in receipt of tlio bounty of tho
Government nro in tho ranks of the in
suigont army or giving thoin aid nnd
comfort. Tho Secretary of tho Intciior
has directed tho suspension of tho pay
ment of tho pension of such persons, up
on proof of thoir disloyalty. I rocom
mond that Congress authorize that officer
to causo tho names of such persons to
be stiickon from tho pension Itolls.

AGRICULTURE. THE SLAVE TRADE.
The execution of the laws for the sup
pression of tho African slave trade, has
been confined to the Department of the
interior. It is a subject of congratula
tion that the efforts which have been mado
for tho suppression of this inhuman traffic
havu recently been attended with unusunl
success. I' ive vessels being fitted out for
tho slave trado have been seized and con
demned ; two masters engaged in the
trade, and ono person equipping tlio ves
sel ns a blnvcr, has been convicted nnd
subjected to tho penalty of fine and im
prisonment, and ono captain taking up a
cargo of Africans on board his vessel has
been convicted of the highest grade of of-

which is death.
THE TERRITORIES.
Tho Territories of Colorado, Dakotah,

is considered that tho leaven of treason
was found existing in somo of these new
countries when the Federal officers arrived
there. Tho abundant natural resources
of theso Territoiies, with the security and
protection anorded by organized Govern'
ment, will doubtless invite to them 1
largo immigration when peace shall re
store tho business ot the country to its
accustomed channels. I submit tho res
olutions of the Legislature of Colorado,
which evinced the patriotic spirit of the
people of tho territory, bo far the au
thority of tho United States has been up-
lield in all the territories, ns it is hoped it
will be in tlio future. 1 commend their

THE DISTRICT.
I reeomend to tho favorable considera
tion of Congress tho interests of the Dis
trict of Columbia. The insurrection has
been tho causo of much suffering and sac
rifice to tlio inhabitants, and as thoy havo
no representative 111 Congress, that body
should not ovorlook their just claims up
on the trovernment.
THE WORLD'S FAIR.
At your Into session a joint resolution
was adopted authorizing th President to
take measures for facilitating a proper
representation, of the industiial interests
of tho United States nt tho exhibition of
tho industry of all nations, to bo holdeu
at London in tho year 1802. I regret to
havo been unnblo to givo personal atten
tion to this subject, a subject at onco so
interesting in itself, nnd so extensively
and intricately connected with the mnto
terial prosperity of tho world. Through
tho Secrotaiies of tho Stato and intciior a
plan or system has been devised and par
tially matured, which will bo laid before
you.
THE CONTRABAND QUESTION.

Congress, entitled nn act to confiscate

of ccitnin persons to tho labor nnd service
of certain other persons, havo become for
feited, and numbers of tho latter thus lib
crated aro already dependant on tho Uni
ted States, and must bo pioviiled for in
some way besides this. It U not impos
sible that some ot tho btntes will pa s
similar enactments for their own benefit
respectively, and by tho operations which
persons of tho same class will bo thrown
upon thoin for disposal. In such caso I
recommend thnt Congress provide for ac
cepting such persons .from such States,
aecoiding to samo mode of valuation, in
lieu protanto of direct taxes, or upon
somo other plan to bo agreed upon with
such States respectively : that such per

that in any event, stops bo taken coloni

Instead of transcending I have adhered
to tho act of Congress to confiscate prop

If a new law upon the subject should be
proposed, its propriety will be duly con

and hence all dispensable means must be
employed.
We should not bf in haste to determ

The Inaugural address at the beginning
of the Administration, and the Message
to Congress at the late session, were both
mainly devoted to the domestic contro-
ersy, oui of which the insurrection and
consequent war have sprung. Nothing
now occurs to add to or subtract from
the principles on general purposes stated
nnd expressed in those documents.
A REVIEW.
The last ray of hope for preserving the
Union peaceably expired at the nsnnlt
upon Fott Sumter, and n general review
of what has occurred sinco may not be
unprofitable. What was painfully un
certain then is much better defined and
more distinct now, and the progress of
ovents is plainly in the right direction.

insurgents connitcntiv claimed a
strong support fiom north of Mason tfc
Dixon's line and the friends of the Union
were not free from apprehension on this
point. This, however, was soon settled
definitely and on tho right side. South
of the Line noblo little Delaware led off,
rigui lrom 1110 nrst. .Maryland was maae
to seem against tho Union. Our soldiers
ossaulted, bridges were bnlncd and
torn up within hor limits, nnd
wo were many days at one rime without'
the ability to bring n single Regiment
over tho soil to the Capitol. Now her
biidges and liailroads are repaired and
opened to the Government. She already
gives seven Ilegiments to the caii6c of
the Union and none to the enemy, and
her people nt n regular election havo sus
tained tho Union by a large majority,
and a larger aggregate voto than they
over before gave to ouy candidate or nny
question. Kentucky too, for soma time
in doubt, is now decidedly, and 1 think
unchangably ranged on the side cf tho

Union. Missouii is comparatively quiet,
and I beliovo cannot agaiu bo ovcriun by
tho insuigcnts. These three States, Mary
land, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of
which would promise a single soldier at
fiist, have now on nggregnto of not les
than 40,000 in the field lor the Union,
whilo of their citizens not more than a
third in number are ninougjtho insurgents,
they of doubtful whereabouts and exist
ence. After a somewhat bloody struggle of
mouths winter closes on the Union peoplo

ters of their own country. An insurgent
forco ot about 1,500, for months dom
inating the narrow peninsular region
constituting the counties of Aecomao nnd
Noithampton and known as the Eastern
Shore ol Viiginia, together with some
contiguous parts of Maryland, havo laid
down theii aims and the peoplo there
have renewed their allegiance to and ac
cepted the pi otection of the old flag.
This leaves no nimcd forco noith of the
Potomac or cast of the Chesapeak.
Also, we havo obtained a footing nt

accounts of popular movements in behalf
of the Union in Noith Carolina and

that the cause of tho Union is advancing

It continues to developo that tho insur

found in tho most grave and maturely
considered public documents as well ns
in tho genual tones of the insurgents.

to participate in the selcctu n of public

vocated with labored nrgutgent to provo
that Jnrgo control or the Government in
the people is the source of all political
evil. Monarchy itself is somctimo3 hin
ted at as a possible refuge from tlr crior
of the people. In my pre.eut position I
could scarcely be justified, were I to omit
raising n warning voico ngainst this ap
proach of returning despotism.
CAPITAL AND LABOR.
nji inferences lrom them are groundless,
Labor is prior to and independent of cap
wore j tai and deserves much the higher cou
Iiailroads j sideiation. Capital has its rights which
arn wnrthv ot nrotcction ns anv other
a
It is not needed, nor fitting here, that
a general argument should Co made in
favor of popular institutions, but thoro is
one point, with its connections, not so
hackneyed nsmost others-, to which I'ask
a brie! attention. It is the effort to place
capital on an equal footing with labor, in
the btructnro of Government. It is as
sumed that labor is availablo only in con
nection with capital; that nobody labors
unlcso somebody else, owning cnpitul,
somehow by the use of it, induce them to
labor. This assumed it is next consider
ed whether it is Lent tbut capital shall
hire laborers, and thus induce them to woik
bv their own consent, or levy them and
drive them to it without their consent.
Having proceedc 1 so far it is naturally
concluded thnt all laborers are either hired
laborers or what we call slaves, and fur-
ther, it is assumed that whoever is onco
a hired laborer is fixed in that condition
for life.
Now there is no such relationbetwecn
capital and labor as assumed, nor is thoro
any such tfiing as a freeman being fixed
fnr life in the condition of a hired laborer.
I50th of these assumptions are false, nnd
rights. Nor is it denied that there is,
nnd probably always will be a relation
between labor and capital producing mu
tual benefits. The error is in assuming
that the whole labor of cominunit- exists
wiiliiu tho relation. A few men own
capital, and that few avoid labor, ond
with their capital hire or buy a few to
labor for them. A largo majority bo
longing to neither clast, neither woik
for othcis nor havo others working for
them. In most of tho Southern States a
maiority of tho whole people of all colors
J . ; , .. . im-
are neither slaves nor masters, while in
the Northern a laigc majority nre neither
hirer. nor hired men Men with their
famolies, wives, sons and daughters, work
for themselves on their farms, in their
houses, and in their shops, taking Uie
whole product to themselves, and asking
no favors of capital on tho oue hand, nor
of hired laborers or slaves on the other.
It is not forgotten that n considerable
number of persons mingle their own la
bor with capital; that is, they labor with
their own hands nnd also buy or hire
others to labor for them; but this is only
a mixed ami 1101 a uuuui;i
principle stated i di.-turbed by the ex
istence of this mixed class. Again, as
has already been sni.l, there is not of
necessity any such thing as the fieo hired
laborer being fixed for that condition for
life. Many independent men everywhere
in these State-, a few years back in their
live.-, were hi led l.iboieis. Tho prudent,
penniless beggar in tho woild labois for
wases awhile and saves a sm plus with
winch to buy tools or land for himself,
then labors on bis own account nnd at
length hires another nowbegiuncr to help
him. This is the just, nnd generous and
prospcious system which open the way to
nil, gives hopo to all and consequently
energy, piogiess and inprovoment of tho
conditiou of all. No men living arc moro
worthy to bo ti listed than those who toil
up or on fiom povoity, none less inclined
to tnko or touch aught which they have nut
honorably earned. Let tlteui bowaro of
surrendering n political power which they
