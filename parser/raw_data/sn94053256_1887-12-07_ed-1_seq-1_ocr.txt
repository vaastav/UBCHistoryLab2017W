THE AHNDALMESSAEfE.
It Deals Only with the Tariff
Question.
TAXES MUST BE BEDUCED.
President Cleveland Urges Immediate
Action on the Fart of Congress
He Strongly Advises a Revision of the
Existing Tariff Laws, and Declares That
Unless Measures Are Taken to Reduce
the Surplus, the People Must Suffer.
? Be Appeals to the Manufacturers to
xert Themselves in Favor of a Tariff
Reduction.
We give an extension of the telegraphic
summary in the Democrat yesterday some
of the salient points of the President's
message to Congress.
SURPLUS REVENUES.
While the expedients thus employed to re
lease to the people the money lying idle in
the treasury served to avert immediate
danger, our surplus revenues have continued
to accumulate, the excess for the present
year amounting on the 1st day of December
to $55,258,701.19, and estimated to reach the'
turn of $113,000,000 on the 80th of June next,
at which date it is expected that this sum,
added to prior accumulations, -will swell the
surplus in the treasury to $140,000,000. i
There seems to be no assurance that, with
such a withdrawal from use of the people's
circulating medium, our business community
may not in the near future be subjected to the
Fame distress which was quite lately produced
from the same cause. And while the func
tions of our national treasury should be
few and simple, and while its best condition
would be reached, I believe, by its entire
disconnection with private business interests,
yet when, by a perversion of its purposes, it
idly holds money uselessly subtracted from
the channels of trade, there seems to be
reason for the claim that some legitimate
.means should be devised by the government
to restore in an emergency, without waste
or extravagance, such money to its place
uimong the people.
NO EXECUTIVE POWER OF RELIEF.
If such an emergency arises there now ex
ists no clear and undoubted executive power
of relief. Heretofore the redemption of 3
per cent, bonds, which were payable at the
option of the government, has afforded a
means for the disbursement of the excess of
our revenues; but these bonds have all been
retired, and there are no bonds outstanding
the payment of which we have the right to
insist upon. The contribution to the sinking
fund which furnishes the occasion for ex
penditure in the purchase of bonds has been
already made for the current year, so that
there is no outlet in that direction.
In the i resent state of legislation the only
preteu f ony existing executive, power to
THE QUESTION OF PURCHASING BONDS.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoriug to circulation
.the surplus money accumu'ating in the treas
ury, it should be Lome in .mind, that pre
miums must of course be paid upon such
purchase, that there may be a large part of.
these bonds held as investments which can
not be purchased at any price, and that com
binations among holders who are willing to
sell mny unreasonably enhance the cost of
such bonds to the government.
It has been suggested that the pre ent
bonded debt might be refunded at a less rate
of interest, and the difference between the
old and new security paid in cash, thus find
ing use for the surplus in the treasury. Jhe
success of this plan, it is apparent, must de
pend upon the volition of the holders of the
present bonds; and it is not entirely certain
that the inducement which must be offered
them would result in more financial benefit
to the government than the purchase of
bonds, while the latter proposition would re
duce the principal of the debt by actual pay
ment, instead of extending it.
DEPOSITING MONET IN BANKS AN OBJECTION.
The proposition to deposit the money held
by the government in banks throughout the
country, for use by the people, is, it seems to
me, exceedingly objectionable in principle,
as establishing too close a relationship be
tween the operations of the government
treasury and the business of the country, and
too extensive a commingling of their money,
thus fostering an unnatural reliance in pri
vate business upon public funds. If this
scheme should be adopted it should only be
done as a temporary expedient to meet an
urgent necessity. Legislative and executive
effort should generally be in the opposite di
rection, and should have a tendency to di
vorce, as much and as fast as can safely be
done, the treasury department from private
enterprise.
Of course it is not expected that unneces
sary and extravagant appropriations will be
made for the purpose of avoiding the accu
mulation of an excess of revenue. Such ex
penditure, beside the demoralization of all
just conceptions of pnblic duty which it en
tails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvi
dence not in the least consistent with the
mission of our people or the high and benefi
cent purposes of our government.
TARIFF LAWS SHOULU MENDED.
But our present tariff laws, the vicious, in
equitable and illogical source of unnecessary
taxation, ought to be at once revised and
amended. These laws, as their primary and
plain effect, raise the price to consumers of
all articles imported and subject to duty, by
precisely the sum paid for such duties. Thus
the amount of the duty measures the tax
paid by thos3 who purchase for use theso im
ported articles. Many of these things, how
ever, are raised or manufactured in our own
country, and the duties now levied upon
foreign goods and products are called pro
tection to these home manufactures, becr.usa
they render it possible for those of our peo
ple who are manufacturers to make these
taxed articles and sell them for a price equal
to that demanded for the imported goods
that have paid customs duty. So it happens
that while comparatively a few us 3 the im
ported articles millions of our people who
never use and never saw any of the foreign
products purchase and use things of the same
kind made in this country and pay therefor
nearly or quite the same enhanced price
which the duty adds to the imported articles.
Those who buy imports pay the duty charged
thereon into the , public treasury, but the
great majority of our citizens who buy do
mestic articles of the same class pay a sum
at least approximately equal to this duty to
the home manufacturer. This reference to
the operation of our tariff laws is not made
by way of instruction, but in order thatjwe
may be constantly reminded of the manner
, , in which they impose a burden upon those
;. i who ' consume domestic products as well as
' those who consume imported articles and'
'SSnft'cYgatto a tax upon all our people.
It is also said that the increase in the price
of domestic manufactures resulting from the
present tariff is necessary in order that
higher wages may be paid to our working
men employed in manufactories, than are
paid for what is called the pauper labor of
Europe. All will acknowledge the force of
an argument which involves the welfare and
liberal compensation of our laboring people.
Our labor is honorable in the eyes of every
American citizen; and as it lies at the foun
dation of our development and progress, it is
entitled, without affectation or hypocrisy, to
the utmost regard. The standard of our la
borers' life should not be measured by that of
any other country less favored, and they are
entitled to their full share of all our advan
tages. By the last census it is made to appear that
of the 17,392,099 of our population engaged
in all kinds of industries 7,670,493 are em
ployed in agriculture, 4,074,238 in profes
sional and personal service (2,934,876 of whom
are domestic servants and laborers), while
1,810,256 are employed in trade and trans
portation, and 3,837,112 are classed as em
ployed in manufacturing and mining.
For present purposes, however, tho last
number given should be considerably re
duced. Without attempting to enumerate
all, it will be conceded that there should be
deducted from those which it includes 375,143
carpenters and joiners, 285,401 milliners,
dressmakers and seamstresses, 172,726 black
smiths, 133,756 tailors and tailoresses, 102,473
masons, 76,241 butchers, 41,309 bakers, 22,083
plasterers and 4.891 engaged in manufactur
ing agricultural implements, amounting in
the aggregate to 1,214,023, leaving 2,623,089
persons i mployed in such manufacturing in
dustri s as are claimed to be benefited by a
high tiriff.
To these the appeal is made to save their
employment and maintain their wages by
resisting a change. There should be no dis
position to answer such suggestions by the
allegation that they are in a minority among
those who labor, and therefore should forego
an advantage in the interest of low prices for
the majority; their compensation, as it may
bo affected by the operation of tariff laws,
should at all times be scrupulously kept in
view, and yet with slight reflection they will
not overlook the fact that they are con
sumers with the rest; that they, too, have
their own wants and those of their families
to supply from th-ir earnings and that the
price of the necessaries of life as well as the
amount of their wages will regulate the
measure of their welfare and comfort.
But the reduction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to necessitate
or justify either the loss of employment by
the working man nor the lessening of his
wages ; and the profits still remaining to the
manufacturer, after a necessary readjust
ment, should furnish no excuse for the sacri
fice of lha interests of his employes either in
their opportunity to work or in tho diminu
tion of their compensation. Nor can the
worker in manufactures fail to understand
that while a high tariff is claimed to be
necessary to allow the payment of remun
erative wages, it certainly results in a very
large increase in the price of nearly all
sorts of manufactures, which, in almost
countless forms, he needs for the use of
himself and his family. He receives at the
desk of his employer his wages, and per
haps befora he reaches his home is obliged,
in a purchase for family use of an article
which embraces his own labor, to return
in the payment of the increase of price
which the tariff permits, the bard earned
compensation of many days of toil.
MANUFACTURERS URGED TO CO-OPERATE.
These interests constitute a leading and
most substantial element of our national
greatness and furnish the proud proof of our
country's progress. But if in the emergency
that presses upon us our manufacturers are
asked to surrender something for the public
good and to avert disaster, their patriotism,
as well as a grateful recognition of advan
tages already afforded, should lead them to
willing co-operation. No demand is made
that they shall forego all the benefits of gov
ernmental regard, but they cannot fail to be
admonished of their duty, as well as their
enlightened self interest and safety, when
they are reminded of the fact that financial
panic and collapse, to which the present con
dition tends, afford no greater shelter or pro
tection to our manufacturers than to our
other important enterprises. Opportunity
for safe, careful and deliberate reform is
now offered; and none of us should bo un
mindful of a time when an abused and irri
tated people, heedless of those who have re
sisted timely and reasonable relief, may
insist upon a radical and sweeping rectifica
tion of their wrongs. .......
The difficulty attending a wise and fair
revision of our tariff laws is not underesti
mated. It will require on the part of the
congress great labor and care, and especially
a broad and national contemplation of the
subject, and a patriotic disregard of such
local and selfish claims as are unreasonable
and reckless of the welfare of the entire
country.
Under our present laws more than 4,000
articles are subject to duty. Many of theso
do not in any way compete with our own
manufactures, and many aro hardly worth
attention ns subjects of revenue. A consid
erable reduction can be made in the aggre
gate, by adding them to the free list Tho
taxation of luxuries presents no features of
hardship; but the necessaries of life u o J
and consumed by all the people, the duty
upon which adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly cheapened.
The radical reduction of the duties imposed
upon raw material used in manufactures, or
its free importation, is, of course, an im
portant factor in any effort to reduce the
price of these necessaries; it would not only
relieve them from the increased cost caused
by the tariff on such material, but the man
ufactured product being thus cheapened,
that part of the tariff now laid upon such
product, as a compensation to our manufac
turers for the present price of raw material,
could be accordingly modified. Such re
auction, or tree importation, would serve
beside to largely reduce the revenue. It is
not apparent how such a change can have
any injurious effect upon our manufac
turers. On the contrary, it would appear to
give them a better chance m foreign markets
with the manufacturers of other Countries,
who cheapen their wares by free material,
Thus our people might have the opportunity
of extending their sales beyond the limits of
home consumption saving them from the
depression, interruption in business, and loss
caused by a glutted domestic market, and
affording their employes more certain and
iteady labor, with its resulting quiet and
contentment.

THRILLING SCENES AT THE BURST
ING OF A WATER TOWER.
Accidents and Incidents of Recent Hap
peningsBrief Mention : of Current
Events - Brought Across the . Wires and
Boiled Down Into Short Paragraphs.
Atlanta, Dec 7. Yesterday morning a
water tower in Thomasville, La., collapsed,
with tragic results. Four men were killed
outright, all being buried beneath the fallen
masonry, and horribly crushed and muti
lated. Four others were badly injured, one
of whom, and possibly all, will die. Four
others were left for nearly an hour clinging
like flies to the side of a portion of the
tower, which remained standing until they
were rescued by means of a rope. They
were seventy feet above the ground, and
clunz to the projecting bricks of the half
ruined wall, which threatened to fall at any
moment. When the hook and la Ider com
pany reached the scene it was found that its
ladders lacked at least twenty-five feet of be
ing long enough to reach the men. To come
down a rope hand over hand to the top of the
ladder was their only chance of escape. The
wall was swaying in the breeze and threat
ened to collapse before ropes could be pro
cured. It did not, however, and a cord at
tached to a rope was tied to a brick and,
after several attempts, thrown over the top
or the tumbling masonry, a score of men
lent eager aid pulling up the rope and get
ting it in reach of one of the men. A mo
ment later he descended it to the top of the
ladder and finally reached the ground in
safety. A mighty shout went up from the
crowd. The rope was moved successfully
from one man to another of the remaining
three until we all were finally rescued in the
same manner as the first. The killed were:
Joseph Moore and T. J. P. Rommerdall
(white) ; Levin Wells and "Joe" Fabian (col
ored). The injured, all colored men, are
Edward Dorsey, John Tate, William Ken
nedy and Frank Fatziam. Tate cannot sur
vive, and the recovery of the others is still a
matter of doubt.
Mr. Blaine and the Presidency.
New York; Dec 7. Mr. J. W. Small ey,
the foreign correspondent of The New York
Tribune, cables the following from Paris
concerning the Maine statesman:
MrJBlaine authorizes me to say that the
reports of alleged interviews with him.
cabled of late by various persons from Paris,
in which he is represented as speaking with
great freedom of his political intentions
and of his expectations touching, the
presidential nomination and election of
next year, are absolute fabrications. It may
be added that the presidency is the one sub
ject upon which Mr. Blaine has maintained
a steady reserve since he came to Europe.
But it is not to be denied that all those who
hold intimate relations with him have in
some way gained an impression that he does
not expect his name to be presented to the
Republican convention of 1888.
His Daughter Deputy Marshal.
Trenton, N. J., IDec. 7. United States
Marshal Gordon has appointed his daughter,
Alphonsine M. Gordon, a young woman just
out of her teens, as his deputy. The mar
shal has been too ill for several months to
attend to the duties of the office, and his
daughter has full power to sign all papers in

COMMENTS OF THE PRESS.
What Some of - the leading Journals Say
. Regarding the Message.
"New Yobk, Nov. .7. The following are
brief extracts from the editorial c alumna of
the morning papers: -
; The ueraia: xne message is an able, con
servative and statesmanlike document,
vhich, unlike many other messages, will be
read by the people and discussed-by them.
Putting aside all other questions and topics,
Mr. Cleveland has confined himself to one
alone, as of supreme and overshadowing
importance the question of surplus taxa
tion.which, as be rightly says, if not quickly
remedied by congress, will overwhelm the
country in a huge and general financial dis
aster. - The World: The admirable message of the
president has given to the Democratic party
what it has long lacked an issue and a leader.
The issue is tax reform, . The leader is the
president. V
- The Sun: It is not a commonplace docu
ment, for it is simple, intelligible and coher
ent; and the quality of brevity is chiefly due
to the fact that all other topics of national
interb.it are dismissed in a lump or postponed
as inconsequential in the presence of one
problem of supreme importance the ques
tion of tariff revision.
The Tribune says: It is a most unwelcome
task to speak only in critical and contro
versial terms of the annual message of a
president. But in this instance .the president
himself, not speaking for- the whole people,
whose official representative he ought to be,
has chosen to speak exclusively for one fac
tion of one party, and only on the chief issue
between parties.
." The Times says : It remains to be seen how
eongress will regard the appeal made by the
president. It is a . wise appeal, based on
facts that no one can deny, and pointing to
n policy that must be adopted sooner or later.
If it be not adopted now: then, in the words
of the message, "the responsibility must rest
where it belongs.", -' "
. Philadelphia,. DecUT. The Times says
editorially : The preoiient's message is one
of the most incisive revenue and industrial
deliverances ever made to the country. The
question of internal revenue reduction is left
to congress without positive executive sug
gestion. - ' - -- :
' Louisville, Ky.,' Dee.: 7. -Mr. Watterson
says in The Louisville Courier-Journal: The
message of the president takes the breath out
of official veterans, who think that such a doc
ument should be infinite in breath and uni
versal in detail. It is. on the contrary, very
short, very much to the "purpose and treats
only one single question of national interest
that is, of course,-the tariff. .
Boston, Dec 7. The; Herald says: Presi
dent Cleveland's message is, we think,
unique in being confined to the considera
tion of one topic . Recognizing the condi
tion of ' the revenues of the government as
of paramount concern, to a degree that over
shadows everything else, Mr. Cleveland has
omitted the summary, of dry facts and sta
tistics which too often furnish the staple of
these communications to congress, referring
that body to the reports of the subordinate
departments of the government for a knowl
edge of the same. .
Chicago, Dec 7. Of the president's mes
sage The Tribune, the leading Republican
journal of the west and Blaine's most ardent
advocate, says: Full justice of President
Cleveland's unprecedented course in devot
ing his annual communication to congress
exclusively to a consiaerauon or cne surplus
and the best means of distributing it, is to
be found in the message itself. The message
is able and statesmanlike, business like in
style, perspicuous in statement, clear in its
reasoning and irrefutable in its conclusions.
London, Dec 7. The London Times, re
ferring editorially to x resident Cleveland's
message, says: It is- 2! the more remark
able that Mr. Cleveland should have the
courage to confront the serried phalanx of
Protectionists on the eve of the contest for
the presidency.

Interesting Supreme Court Decision.
The Supreme Court of Errors has made
a decision of special interest. The case is
that of Thomas A. Shaw vs. City of Hart
ford; and the Court of Common Pleas is
advised to render judgment for the plain
tiff for $8.90. Shaw claimed that he was
compelled to pay in Hartford a tax on per
sonal property while he was a resident of
Massachusetts. The assessors bad added
to his list 10 per cent, for failure to hand
in a list and also compelled the payment of
town and district school taxes. He paid
under protest and then brought suit. The
decision is evidently in accordance with
the fourth clause of Judge Calhoun's find
ing in the court of common pleas, .which
was as follows: "That if both the assess
ments for horse and wagon and the addi
tion of 10 per cent, were unlawful, the
plaintiff is entitled to the return of $8.68."
