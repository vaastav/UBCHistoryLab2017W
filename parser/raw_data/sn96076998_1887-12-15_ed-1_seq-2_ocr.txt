''The duty on wool Is too high," fays
a Huston free trade paper, and that is
all the argument it has to offer in. fa

put wool on the free list. "The fheep

It is P.iid that Carlisle wishes to
make Joe Wheeler, the rebel cavalry
man, chairman of the committee on
Military Affairs'. This is not a pleas

template, but it Is of apiece with the
slavish deference of the democratic
party to everything that bears the con

There are a good many quver things
about the prohibitionists, but nothing
Is queerer than to see a pnrty of that
name casting 111 votes at the last elec
tion in Iowa, w here prohibition has al
ready been established by the republi
can party. What do those til votes
want, anyhow I New York Tribune.
Antrim. Benzie, Isabella, Leelenaw,
Van Uuren and Grand Traverse coun
ties are for prohibition in their own
borders, and the roll will soon bo long
er. There is already twice ns much
territory in Michigan covered by a pro
hibitory law as there is in the whole
state of Rhode Island. Bet. Tribune.
Dakota can only be kept out of the
Union by the democratic party ucting
on the idea that no republican terri
tory shall be admitted. There is no
other excuse. To day in wealth, in
enterprise, in intelligence, if not in
population, Dakota excels one-half
of the democratic states which refuse
to recognize her rights. Chicago Inter
Ocean.
Chicago continues to take the con
vention cake. The republicans decid
ed to meet there in June next, to se
lect their candidate for the presidency.
There in no significance in the choice;
it was simply a contest among half a
dozen cities, and the national commit
tee wisely selected Chicago, because in
points of location, hotel accommoda
tions and hall facilities it is the finest
convention city in the country. Dvt.

The Importance which the presi"
dent gave to the tariff revision has
momentarily made people imagine
that it is the great question of the
hour, lie could easily have given the
same Impression about any other ques
tion to which he had devoted his en
tire message the fisheries, immigra
tion, pensions, prohibition, coast de
fenses. In a pecuniary sense all peo
ple are interested in the tariff; but in
tellectually it bores nine-tenths of
them.- Dtt. Journal.
It Is claimed that the experiments
this year at Fort Scott, Kansas, in ma
king sugar from sorghum have result
ed in success. From n ton of cane 100
pounds of fine sugar have been made,
with twenty pounds as seconds, besides
ten gallons of syrup. It Is claimed
that the seed will pay for cultivating,
and one man can cultivato from 40 to
50 acres, and an acre will produce 12
tons of cane, and a ton of cane will
yield two bushels of seed. It. is ex
pected t hat a ton of cane will make 200
pounds of sugar when everything
works all right. The sugar-cane of
the South, it is said, produces an aver
age of 130 pounds of sugar to the ton.

From Our li-Jar Correspondent.
Washington, Deo. 3, 'S7.
With the coming of Congress comes
the Inevitable ofllvO hunter, and he is
already here in full force. There are
scores here after position In the organ
ization of the new house,and hundred"
that want other places. The result
will be that ninety-nine out of every
hundred will be disappointed. They
will 'hang about here for weeks and
months, in anticipation, until they be
come disheartened nnd absolutely
"dead broke," then borrow money
enough from their congressmen to pur
chase a ticket, and prabably leaving
several little bills unpaid, start for
home disgusted' nnI swearing ven
geance on the administration. Hotels,
boarding hons?s nnd merchants here
have learned pretty well how to rate
these fellows, and generally can tell
one on sight, and demand advance
payment, yet they ore often badly
sold, of course it is not so in a majori
ty of cases, but they so frequently oc
cur that an office hunter Is in extreme
repute here. I have never seen a more
persistent crowd for place than Is in
trutu tarings in new ones. The great
majority of them are from the South
ern States, and one would suppose
from their persistent activity that thev
regarded this their only and last
chance.
Senator Allison, of Iowa, Is an able
man and discreet politician The re
publican party are proud of such spot
less public men, and the presidential
bee that is buzzing in his head does not
disconcert him. A reporter of a demo
cratic paper sought to Interview him
the other evening on this question,
when the Senator very politelj said to
him that there need be no uneasiness
in the democratic party about ' tills
matter, that when the time came the
republicans would have a candidate
and a winning one, too. That is the
whole thing in a nut shell, and the re
porter left with the impression that he
had met one wise member of the Fif
tieth Congress. Many of them come
here with "interviews" already pre
pared on prominent topics, and are ex
ceedingly anxious to have some news
paper man father their manuscript. In
my judgment, more than half the"in
terviews" printed, emenating from
Washington, are thus prepared and
their publication solicited, and in some
Instances paid for.
The commissioners nppointed by
President Cleveland to investigate the
Pacific Railroad, nre here preparing
their report. That "investigation"
cost the government a clean $100,000,
and literally amounts to nothing, so
far as the public is concerned. It gave
three men a nice little job, however,
under ft "reform" administration.
Mr. Benedict has discharged from
the government printing office anoth
er squad of employes of republican
proclivities, to make place for appli
cants pressed by new democratic con
gressmen, lie says, without any re
serve, that when the time comes for
him to leave that office, there shall
not be left a single republican in that
branch ol the service. No matter how
skilled or competent the man or wo
man maybe, they must go, and their
places filled for mere partisan purpos
es. Jicnedict is using ins place lor all
its worth.
Speaker Carlisle, drives a magnifi
cent span of Kentucky bays. He has
named one Sam Randall, and the oth
er Hill Morrison, emblematical of the
two wings of the democratic party
traveling together on the tariff i-sue
Carlisle, so generally dignified, has a
streuk of humor in his nature, after
all.
Senator Ingallsrof Kansas.one of the
brightest men of the country, Is the
present presiding officer of the Sen
ate, and indications all point to his re
election on Monday.
The republican members ot congress
will hold their caucus Saturday after
noon, and the democrats in the eve
ning. The republicans will have sim
ply a nominal ticket for house officers,
and the democrats who can elect their
ticket will be in hot water to tho chin
over nominees. One thing seems to be
well settled,' that Sam Donaldson, the
old doorkeeper, must go.

Mr. Hlaine promptly availed h fin-
sol f of tho president's message to of
fer himself ns the protection eandi
date par excellence of the republican
pnrty. This pitches the presidential
campaign into the house o-f represen
tatlves. Tariff revision will be treat
ed not on its menrs, out witn a vie

The New York World is not well In
formed If It supposes the dependent
pension Mil which tho (rand Army of
the Republic will ask cungress to pass
this winter otiginated with the claim
agents or has a political motive be
hind it. The bill has for Its object the
relief of veterans of the army who are
in distress. Their disability nnd de
pendence has been caused or hastened
by hardships and exposure endured for
tho sake of the union, nnd no body of
iiivn Is so well informed regarding the
condition of these veterans as the
Grand Army of the Republic. The
pohts of that order are called upon
weekly for assistance by some comrade
or ex-soldier, who would suffer for the
common necessities of life if that or
ganization were not prepared with its
ocanty relief fund, to come to their
aid. The country is full of veterans
of the army which saved 'the nation
from dismemberment, who ore as
much entitled to pensions ns many
whose names are on the list, but who
have resolutely declined to apply for
them for them in the past because
they were self reliant and sensitive
about having their patriotism ques
tioned, until no' when their disabili
ties have brought them close, by the
TiTTOTvrtJpgKary,"ine inprw
made proof of their claimsunder
the rulings of the pension bureau
about impossible. .It is to meet the
case of these soldiers nnd not to en
rich claim agents or "put the presi
dent In a hole" that the Grand Army
has prepared another dependent pen
sion bill. There is a real hope, wheth
er there is a real expectation or not,
that the bill will become ft law. The
merits of the bill do not turn upon
the amount of money the government
is paying for pensions, so lunch as
whether those who are to he reached
by the dependent bill have acquired
a just claim upon the government by
their services in opposition to seces
sion and rebellion. When a bill pen
sioning the survivors of the Mexican
war, the majority of whom had since
been in arms against the union, could
become a law, giving pensIoiiFto men.
who "are hot In heed and were not
wounded, it Is too much to expect
that the actually dependent and needy
survivors of the union army will be
cared for in their old age by the gov
ernment they rescued from dismember
input. They must be cared for by the
state or the nation, nnd there is one
very good reason why they should re
receive national aid and thot is, that
those whom they fought against will be
compelled to pay a share of the ex
pense. Bay City rress.
