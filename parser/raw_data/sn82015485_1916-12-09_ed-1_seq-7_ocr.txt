CONGRESS HEARS
WILSON'S MESSAGE
President's- Address to ,Both
Houses Is Quite Short.
RAIL TROUBLES COME FIRST
Further Leaislation on That Line Is
Strongly Recommended Bill Giv-
ing Foreign Commerce Promo
ters Free Hand Necessary.
Washington, Dec. 5. President Wil
son today delivered his message " to
both houses of congress in Joint ses
sion. The address was as follows :
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time -to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion -such legislative measures as may
be judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the practice, which I
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which it seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible; but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the Interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, it seems to me im
. peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and - action
" should . be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last sessionjn view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, aniA trainmen.
Railway Troubles First.
I then recommended :
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
. in the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate ; in order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon it with a-prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
its present constitution and means of
action, practically impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages in the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in Interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration-by the in
terstate commerce commission or an
increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
. and economies, should the facts dis
closed justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existin
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, in case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
Investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll-
ing stock of the railroads of the coon
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the" military service of the United
States such train crews and adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use-
Renews His Recommendations.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress immediate
. ly acted on : it established the eight
hour day ,as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and It au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these . the
measures most immediately needed ;
but it postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportnnity fhould
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem it neces
sary to renew. The power of the in
terstate commerce commission to grant
an Increase of rates on the ground re-
- ferred to is indisputably dear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of the com
mission's authority or its inclination to
do. Justice when there Is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions the increase
In - the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, the
provision for full pubHc investigation
and assessment of industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and .operate the rail
ways when necessary In time of war
or other like public necessity I now
very earnestly renew. "
The necessity for .such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
npon them. -
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it practi
cally Impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but it Is not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative instru
ment. The country cannot and -should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military fprces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed. -
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative ethciency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regard to one
of Its Items, the increase in the effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted : its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.;
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man In any occupa
tion should be obliged by law to con
tinue in an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society "in do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple- Into our jurisprudence which
take It for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public
investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the judgment of the
opinion of the nation Is not to propose
any such principle. It is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint itself with
the merits of the case as between employee-end
employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
but the justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust in It unless it be arbi
trarily- and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for the
permanent interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money In elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies in. the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
jeopard the interests of the couifif
and of the government. W
Immediate passage of the .bill to reg
ulate the expenditure of money in elec
tions may seem to be less necessary
than the immediate enactment of the
other measures to which I refer; be
cause at least two .years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled ; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience; and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
and some special object connected with
it. might be thought to be In the mind
of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer ha ad in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those-who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently, will immediately assume;
has indeed already assumed,' a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary Instrumen
talities for its prosecution; it is
deemed'' to be doubtful whether bey
could be created upon an ' adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all. legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without
permitting unregulated license.- The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity is here and may escape us
if we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs. -The
argument . for - the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing tha island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are. not" just. . We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. We
ought to do it at once. .
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the tijo houses of which it is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them. ; -
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country.; It
has been a privilege to labor in such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion' of
-a recora or rare . serviceaoieness. uu
distinction. " " - . "
Bound to Make Good.
The well-dressed stranger stepped
Into the drug store and, passing by
the boy who usually attended to casual
customers, approached 'the proprietor,
who was arranging some goods in the
show case.
"Mr. C , I presume?" he re
marked, pleasantly, and the druggist
turned and bowed gravely. "I have
heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of
vou often." said the brisk man. "He
told me if ever I needed anything In
this line to come, to you. He spoke of
you as a man on whom one could rely
with perfect confidence, who had only
the best of evrything and with whom
it was always a pleasure to deal.
"Mr. Quorn is very kind," answered
the other, beaming with gratification
"He is one of by best customers. What
can I do for you' this morning?
"Well er this morning, as it hap
pens." said the stranger, with just a
ittle briskness, "this morning I should
like, If you will allow me, to conult
your directory."
'Certainly," was the-calm reply, "we
also have a good selection of one and
two-cent stamps as well as railway
time tables, if you need anything of
that kind." -.
Franklin Objects Seriously.
She isn't very large, that's true, but
being a county seat, and boasting of
a college, several factories, flour mills,
railways, interurbans and her lately
acquired Masonic home, Franklin feels
that she is not a town to be passed
liehtlv by. in fact," she knows her im
portance, and thought that everyone in
the .state realized it until she was
taken down a bit lately. Daring the
hi it conference of the Methodist
churches held recently in tne town a
meeting of .the Indianapolis presbytery
is in session at the same time at
Hopewell, a country church in a pros
perous farming community a few
miles out. One of the Presbyterian
delegates, on leaving the train joined
in the throng headed for the Method
ist church. When it came to regis
tering, some of his inquiries caused
someone to suggest that probably he
was in the wrong place, and he asked
innocently: "Isn't this Hopewell T
"No, this Is Franklin," was the proud
reply. Indianapolis News.
Rather Embarrassing.
Irvin Cobb, the war correspondent.
home from Europe long enough recent
ly to get his breath and look over tne
Droof sheets of a new book, attended
an authors banquet in New York.
A deaf man sat next to Cobb, r ar
ther down the table another man told
a funny story, and when he finished,
the deaf man laughed and applauded
louder and longer than any of the
rest. ,-.---
"Good old boy!" shouted the daf
man. "That reminds me of a story," he
added to those near by.
"Get up and tell it. Charlie," cried
several. The toastmaster sanctioned
the suggestion. . .
Then the deaf man got up and told
the same story the other man had told.
He Was on the Job.
The undertaker arose and said to
the mourners assembled : :
"If anyone present -wishes to say a
few .words of tribute to the deceaseo,
nowis the time, when the family will
be glad to hear such."
A stillness prevailed, and. after -a
few moments of silence It was broken
i,v a vounc man, who arose and
asked:.'- ..'----"','''
"Do I understand that no one wishes
to make any remarks?".
"It would appear so," replied the
undertaker. -v '
"Then." asked the young man, as a
light came Into his eyes, "may I be
nermltted - to make a few remarks
about southern California and Its won
derful climate?""

General Brewster in his biennial re
port filed with the governor the other

sale of the Kansas Natural to the Do

gation and result in the public receiv
ing better service.
"It is impossible," said the report,
'for a corporation to be managed as
a going .concern by court receivers. If
the stock of the-Kansas Natural, or
the property belonging to the Kansas
Natural purchased by the Doherty in
terests or other interests, the receiver

Kansas Charities Less.
Kansas counties had fewer poor to
care for the last fiscal year and it
cost less to care for- them than the
previous year. The counties gave aid
to 8,621 persons and spent $565,201.13.
In the previous fiscal year the coun
ties gave aid to 12,939 persons and
spent $584,481-33. That is in addition
to the maintenance of the poor farms
of the counties.
Raps Irrigation System.
"It is simply a waste of state funds
to conduct irrigation experiments un
der the present law. The system
should be changed. .The state should
quit putting in experimental plants,
It should permit the irrigation com
missioner to employ experts to teach
the -farmers how to put in irrigation
plants and look after their . ma
chinery." This statement was made
recently by J. W. Loagh, state irriga
tion commissioner, and one of the
most successful Lrrigationists in . the
West. .
HEADED FOR ROCKS
NATIONAL TREASURY IN A
DE-
PLORABLE CONDITION.
Democrats Make Loud Claims of "Pros
perity While Piling Up an Enor
. moua Deficit Appropriations
Beyond All " Reason.
The Democratic administration,-
which is loudly proclaiming "prosper
ity,' b piling up a government deficit
of nearly .$2,000,000 every 2 hours.
Congress has made appropriations
for the fiscal year ending June 30. 191T,
which total $l,630,383,000.Every,
source of revenue available "at pres-i
ent will fall short $444,814,000 of rais-t !
ing that sum. .
- The estimates of Incomes are : From!
customs duties r. $225,000,000, inter
nal laws $515,000,000, new rev
enue law $205,000,000, sale - of Pan
ama' . canal bonds remaining in the
treasury $240,569,000. That is a to
tal of $945,000,000 with which, to pay;
$1,630,383,000.
Of the appropriations for the cur
rent year $349,103,590 are attributable
to military and naval preparedness
and on account of the war situation.'
In addition to that item, which la
looked upon as extraordinary, thei
Democrats have arranged to spend la
the present year $336,000,000 In ex
cess of the revenues of the nation. '
Not only are they facing a deficit
of $444,814,000, but to keep It down to
that total they are figuring on. "selling.
$240,569,000 Panama canal bonds, thus
adding to our bonded debt by $240,569,
000. In other words, in one year's op
erations, they would" Increase - by,
$685,383,000 the amount the country
owes. . That Is more than two-thiraa
the total national debt of $1,028,564,
055 when they took charge.
During the first eight months of;
the present year our shipments of ma
terial exceeded similar shipments made
during the same period in the year
the war began by $1,535,000,000. Add
fed to this there was a gain In the ex
port of cotton and breadstuffs to sup- '
ply elothlng and food . needs., of Eu- -rope
due wholly to the war, which In
creases the total to $1,748,000,000. Our
total exports of al! kinds now amount
to $2,110,000,000 more than they were
In 1914. - There is no evading the ob
vious fact that the war was the cause.
What Is going to happen to this
business and the employment of Amer
ican wage-earners which Is back of it
when . the war ends? - There Is cer
tain to be a great change.
:- President Wilson's .Weakness.
Undoubtedly the impression left
ipon an unprejudiced student of Mr.
Wilson's public career Is that of a,.
wavering, shifting personality, even "
seeking a line of least resistance. His,.
innumerable changes of mind on im-.
portant .questions point Inevitably to'
sacrifice, of principle in favor o'
political expediency. More "significant
still have been his direct surrendea to.
dictation from special, interests. His
well-known reliance upon unofficial ad--;
