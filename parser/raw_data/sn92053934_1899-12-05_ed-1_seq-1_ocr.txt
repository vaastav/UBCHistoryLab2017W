PEESIDESTS MESSAGE BEAD.
Senator Hayirard'a Death Announced
In the I'pper Branch and Robert'
Case Taken l'p By tbe Honfte Objec

II la Own Behalf.
Washington, Dec ii. Another sor
row had fallen upon tbe senate before
it cotTcjned today in tbe death of
Senator-elect Ilayward, of Nebraska.
Platte (Conn.) and Jones (Ark.), the
committee to inform the president of
the senate in session, reported that
dnty performed. Bate (Tenn.) was
sworn in. Maj. Pruden, the presi
dent's secretary, then appeared with
the message and its readicjr was be
gun. At the conclnsion of the reading of
the message Thurston announced the
death of Ilayward and submitted ap
propriate resolutions.
In the house, after reading of the
journal. Cannon, from the committee
to wait on the president, reported that
the president would communicate in
writing. Immediately thereafter Maj.
Pruden presented the message and it
was at once read.
At the conclusion of tbe reading of
the message it was referred to the
committee of the whole on state of
the union and ordered printed. The
speaker then laid before the honse
Taylor's resolution with reference to
tne Roberts case.

CENTEKI.D IN ROBERTS.
Bfost of the Interest of the Open! or Scse
aton of tbe Ropreaentatlvre.
AVfC-hlngton. Iec. 5. An enormous
crjvel witnessed the opening scenes ia
The bouse. Th principal interest cen
tered Ux tbe disposition of the ia?e of
Roberts, the Mprmcni representative
from I'tah. Those who anticipated a
sensational iloiiouucenient wore disap
pointed. The programme outlined by
tlie Republican leaders at their cou
ferencf on Friday uiglit was partially
curried out. The objection to the ad
ministration of tbe oath to Itoberts
rva.s entered by Taylor, of Ohio, as
predicted and he stepped aside with
out protest except to ask if by doing
so be waived any of bis rights. To this
tbe speaker responded in the negative.
There was not a protest from any
eruarter against the objection fo the
administration of tbe oath to Uolierts.
Hut ou the coutrary the only voice
raised except that of Taylor's was that
of Me-Une. of Arkansas, who joined
with Taylor in bis protest.

In offering his resolutiou for an
luvestigation of the Itoberts" e-ase Tay
lor said: "I d so. Mr. Speaker, on my
responsibility as a member of this
honse. and lieoause specific, serious,
and apparently well grounded charges
of ineligibility are made against him.
A transcript of tbe proe-eediugs of
court iu Utah evidences tbe fact that
the claimant was in lssi convicte-d or
that be pleaded guilty of tbe ( rime of
unlawful cohabitation. Affidavits and
other luipers in my iossession inilh-ate
that ever since then be has lieen per
sistently guilty of tbe same crime, and
that ever slne-e then be La becn and
is now a poly ga mist. If this transcript
and these affidavits and papers tell the
truth the niemlier-elect from I'tah is.
In my judgment, ineligible to le a
ir.emlier of this bouse of representa
tives, lioth because of tbe statutory
disqualification of the Edmunds law.
and for higher and graver and quite as
iouiid reasons.
Naturalization Alan Attacked.
"I' ought also -to say. in addition to
What I have just sahl that I b-ive in
my possession a certified copy of tbe
e ntry under which the claimant to this
Wat was naturalized. and that eminent
counsel assert that if this lie the
record in the case this claimant is not
a citizen of the I'nited States. I offer
and express no opinion upon that
projwisition.
"Mr. Speaker, if It were possible to
emphasize the gravity of these charges
and the responsibility that is at this
moment ImiKtsed upon this bouse we
will find that emphasis in the me
morials, a small part of which could be
physically cared for In this ball, but
all of which I now present to tbe
bouse, from over 7.0n.0tKj American
men and women, protesting against
the entrance of this representative
elect from Utah.
ROBERTS BORE HIMSELF WELL.
Hie Dane-hter Watched the Proeeedinga
From the Gallery.
It must be said in justice to tbe
Utah man that he has a line appear
ance and bore himself with dignity
through a very trying ordeal. He wa
on hand when Clerk McDowell called
the house to order and sat quietly and
placidlf through tbe tedious business
of three? or four, roll calls and ctber
features of the organization. He took
af seat to the right of the speaker aad
balfladoezn rows from tbe front. Im
mediately behind liici sat"' Bailey of
Texas and on bis left a young mem
ber from Brooklyn. Hobcrrts was tbe
e-enter of observation, for tbe thousands
mostly ladies who thronged the gal
leries, but it was not until be started
down tbe aisle in response to the cal;
of his name that the spectators got a
good look at bim while Taylor was
making bis speech. Roberts remained
immovable. He clutched th rails of
tbe seats on cither tilde of him and.
leaning forward sightly, listened atten
tively to every word uttered against
hiin. His face wor ea look of bold de
fiance, and never for one minute did
be change color in the slightest or dis
play signs of nervousness.
Although Rolierts was not sworn in
he secured a seat. This, however, was
by an accident pure and simple. In
tbe seat-drawing lottery no provision
bad been made for Roberts, but when
the drawing was completed two others
as well as himself had not been pro
vided with seats, and the speaker
asked and scured from tbe house gen
eral permission for those members
who had not drawn sears to make such
selections as they could. I'nder this
authority Itoberts got a seat in an ob-M-nre
portion of the ball. His daugh
ter sat in tbe gallery and watched the
proceedings from beginning to end.
Tbe election of Speaker Henderson
and bis induction into 'office, tbe ap
pointment of tbe usual (committees to
wait upon the president.! he seat-drawing
contest with the asual amusing
features went off witbotit a hitch.. The
only other feature out df th ordinary
was the adoption of the I!eeU rules for
the present congress. Tbe Democrats
knew it was futile- ro more than pro
test against th eadoptinn of these rules
after the Republicans bad decided up
on this course in caucus, and the de
bate uiou the resolution to adopt them
was very brief. They wer eadopted by
a strict party vote.
Appropriate tribute to t be- memory
of the late Vive President Hobart was
paid by tbe senate yesterday at its first
session of the Kifty-slxtb congress.
The session lasted only thirty-three
minutes, and only the most formal and
necessary business was transacted.
After the adoption of the usual rou
tine resolutions and tbe hdmlnistration
to the now mnibers of the oath of of
fice'. Sewell of New Jersey presented
lining resolorions upon tbe death of
me rice president, tlie resolutions were
ordereel to be communicated to the
bouse of reprrseutatl veh and tbe ses
sion was suspended.

dated Wednesday. Nov. 1S. morning,
from its correspondent at Moddcr riv
r camp: "The severest engagement
our column has yet bad. and probably
the severest of tbe whole campaign,
was fought yesterday ou the banks of
the Modder river. . The battle was
waged fiercely for nearly fourteen
hours. The enemy occupied a strongly
entrenched position, their front ex
tending five miles along the bank of
tbe stream. They were well supplied
with artillery and fought desperately.
British Force ThatWas Engaged.
"Our force consisted of the second
battalion of the Coldstream Guards,
first . battalion of the Scots Guards,
third battalion of the Grenadier
Guards, first battalion of the Northum
berland Pusiliers. second battalion of
the ' Yorkshire Light infantry (the
Kings Owni, a part of the first bat
talion of the Iyal North Lancashire
regiment. ' the Ninth lancers, the
mounted infantry, three butteries of
field artillery and the first battalion of
tlie Argyll and Sutherland Highland
ers (Trincess Louise's). The latter re
inforced us from General Waucbope's
brigade and arrived just in time for
the fight. The battle started at day
break, our guns shelling the Boers

lery duel lasted some hours. Then
there was a brief lull in the enemy's
operations, of which the general imme
diately took advantage. Our infantry
advanced across the plain towards the
river in two brigades. The guards, on
tbe right, were met by an awful hail,
of bullets from the enemy's sharp
shooters posted dose to the river on
the opposite bank. Ours bad no cover
whatever, and were simply mowed
dowu. It seM'tnevl impossible to live
through the terrible fire, but the brave
fellows did not retreat an inch. The
Boer fire jvas horribly accurate, and
they must have numbered at least 10,-000.
HIGHLANDERS FAIL FOR OCR.
Cannot Force a Fassage of the River Gal
lant Deeds of Officers.
"The Scots Gurads advanced GOO
yards lief ore they were fired on. Then
they had to lie down to escape the
deadly fusillade, which lasted without
intermission throughout the day. The
Highlanders made several attempts to
forve a passage of the river. but they
were exposed to such a murderous en
filading tire that they had to retire aft
er they had suffered terribly. Subse
quently a party of the guards got over
and held their own for hours against
a vastly superior force. Tlie general
opinion of the staff is that there had
never been such a sustaiued fire iu tbe
auuals of the British army as that
which our troops bad to face yester
day. Our men fell in dozens while try.
iug to rush the bridge.
"Among the many heroic deeds one
of . the most conspicuous was that of
Lieutenant Colonel Codrington. of the
Coldstream Guards, Captain Sellpein.
of the Queensland contingent, and a
dozen members of the Coldstream
Guards, who jumped into the river
and swam nearly to the other side in
the face of a steady fire, but who were
forced to retire, and joining bads
swam back, two of their number being
nearly drowned in tbe retreat.
"The British guns kept' up a heavy
fire all day. and fearful ifavoc was
wrought in the Boer positions, the en
emy being forced to fly from their en
trenchments. Night put an end to the
terrible bloodshed. Tbe iufautry brig
ade was dreadfully cut up. The Boers
retreated at night, taking their guns
with them, and we are now occupying
their positions. Tbe enemy's loss was
tremendous."

scribing in The Daily Mai! yesterday

says: "I ran testify that the British
never once saw the enemy, yet they
were not able to raise baud or foot
without being riddled. Despite all this,
however, the day belonged to tbe artil
lery. The infantry never advanced
two paces during this day of hell. The
