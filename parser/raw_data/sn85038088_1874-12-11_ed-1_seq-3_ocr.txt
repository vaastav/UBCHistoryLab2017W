Neither the Herald nor the Trionne
had the nerve to "tackle" the President's
Message. But after .a little reflection,
the Herald managed this week to electri
ify its subscribers with the Governor's
Message.
We were in error in stating that Frank
Mitchell A Bro., of St. Louis, had suf
fered loss by a recent conflagration, as
we learn from A. M. Scott, Esq., of that
city. It was another firm, with a name
almost similar to that of the Mitchell
brothers.
We have a rather juicy communica
tion from New. Lexington, which will
appear in next issue. It, with other in
interesting matter, was crowded out of
our columns this week by the P. M.,
which, as will be observed, occupies
nearly the whole of our second page.
The burglar who carried off Mr. Le
vi's goods, has i ot been captured, as was
stated in a telegram from Lancaster to
the Cincinnati Commercial. Herts, the

the theft, ia still at large, and any in
formation concerning his whereabouts
would be very thankfully received by
Mr. L.
Congress convened on last Monday,
and had scarcely got through with lis

the financial question was sprung, and
the indications now are that it will be
the occasion of unusually lively debates
during the session.
The Mite Society of the M. E. Church
will be entertained at the residence of
Mr. O. T. Mohler on Wednesday eve

Come, everybody, and have a good time.
Three prisoners St. Clair, McMannis
and Blackburn broke jail at New Lex
ington, on Sunday evening last, and two
of them made good their escape. But
the third and most interesting of the
pets Blackburn was collared by Mr.
Porter, the jail guard, who happened to
"come around" just as the boys had
emerged from the hole they had dug
through the prison wall, and taken back
and supplied with a new set of jewelry.
Died At his residence in this place,
on Wednesday morning, the 9th instant,
Jacob Burgoon, aged about 88 years.
The deceased came to this county from
Frederick county, Maryland, in 1825,
and located in the vicinity of St. Jo
seph's, where he resided until a few
years ago) when he removed to town,
where he departed this life as above
stated. He led a quiet and upright life,
was universally highly esteemed in the
community, and his death is lamented
by a large circle of relatives and ac
quaintances.
A battle occurred at Vicksburg, Miss.,
on Monday last between large forces of
whites and negroes. The latter were re
pulsed with a loss of about seventy. The
whites lost one killed, and two wounded.
A dispatch says: The attack was made
for the purpose of reinstating Crosby,
Sheriff, who was requested to resign be
cause he had not given any bond. The
negroes in the country are reported
burning dwellings and cotton gins. At
last accounts, however, all was quiet in
the city, bat the inhabitants generally,
were in arms, ready for any further
"emergencies."

the M. E. Church, February 1872, an

The history of last year's proceedings
of the Fair Company shows $2503.25 of
receipts which includes only $200 bor
rowed money. During the same year
the expenditures were $992.06 leaving a
net balance in favor of the Fair of
$1511.19.
This was good work. The Board re
cently elected is composed of good ma
terial but it will have hard work to
equal the results of the last year's effort.
It is already intimated that the new
Board will give an entertainment at the
city hall which will I worthy of pat
ronage and that as the proceeds of last
February's effort resulted in a net in
come of $27730 nothing short of an ef
fort to raise $300 this winter ull ratisfy
the ambition of the new Board.
This shows the right kind of pluck.
Any laudable endeavor to lift the Fair
Company out of debt will receive the
hearty approval and support of the com
munity at large, for after all it is the
capacity of the community to sustain the
fair in Somerset that is on trial and not
the capacity alone of the Directory and
officers.
Ten or fifteen of our young melt have
expressed their readiness, if called on
by the proper authorities, to furnish an
entertainment for the benefit of the
Fair Company. Such an entertainment
by our native amateur talent can be j
made highly attractive with some care j
in drafting a programme. I
We hope that no pains will be spared
in the presentation of the plays and the
performances so that their repetition
may rather be desired than ignored.
In all the entertainments it may not
bo well to leave out music both vocal
and instrumental, nor the female ele
ment on the stage. We have some ex
cellent musicians who have already
proven their powers to charm the ear,
but we have also those whose presence
on the stage hag not yet been greeted by
a public audience. Let us hear them.
And last, but by no means least, can
we not have a series of lectures on var
ious subjects of interest from competent
persons who may be willing to aid the
Fair Company? Surely we may if the
proper steps be taken to this end.

31, 1874, and continuing three days. A
suitable room has been secured, and

Mr. H. A. Schwartz of this place, is
the agent for "our Fireside Friend," one
of the most popular literary papers of
the day. Every subscriber to the pa
per gets one or more beautiful chromos.
The premium chromos we have seen,
and have no hesitation in pronouncing
them charming, and of a high order of
art. But as Mr. Schwartz lias these
chromos and sample copies of the paper,
for exhibition, and is also fully conver
sant with all the inducements which
the publishers offer to eubearibers, we
refer the public to him, feeling assured
that they will find in these offers abetter
opportunity to invest a small amount to
good advantage than has turned tip for
a long time.

According to a decision of the Sup
reme Court of Indiana on Wednesday,
the passage of the Civil Rights bill will
be necessary to enforce the mixed school
system in that State. By an act of the
Legislature in 1869 provision waa made
for the education of white and colored
children in separate schools. Suit was
brought by a negro to compel a school
board to admit his children to a com
mon district school. One of the main
points urged was that the statute of 1869
referred to was in conflict with the four
teenth amendment of the Constitution of
the United States. The court held that
such amendment forbids any State from
abridging the privileges of any citizen of
the United States, that all the privileges
of the school system of Indiana are de
rived from Constitution and laws of that
State, and that the Constitution of the
United States has no force over such
priyileges. The case will be appealed
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

Another Railway Train Boarded
and Robbed by Misked Men.
Kansas City, Mo., December 8.
About half-past three this afternoon, as
the Kansas Pacific train reached Murice,
a few miles west of this city, five" mask
ed men flagged and stopped it, cut off
the passenger coaches, moved the engine
and express car some distance forward,
and robbed Wells, Fargo & Co.'s safe of
about $27,000. One can of gold dust,
for Kountz Borthers, New York, con
taining $5,000, was also carried off. All
were large men, rode bay and brown
horses, and were heavily armed with
Henry rifles and revolvers. The Ex
press Company offers a rewerd of $10,000,
the K. P. Railway Company $5,000, and
Governor Osborn $2,500 for the recovery
of the funds and arrest of the robbers.

Every man, says the Boston Trans
cript, likes honesty in one way or anoth
er. This man likes to see it in another,
enjoying the sight of it as that of a cost
ly luxury which lie can not afford to in
dulge in ; while that man, wiser and
truer, having lost all else, hugs it as his
only priceless fortune, and gloats over it
as his secret and sufficing treasure.
It was for for fifty years the sole aim
of James Hollow, of West Dudley,
Mass., to get "a home of his own." So
fixed was his mind upon this idea that
it almost amounted to a mania. He
worked incessantly, and saved his earn
ings parsimoniously until a month ago,
he was able to buy a farm. He took
possession, and died twenty days after
ward.
The New York critics note that a re
markably large proportion of the "Black
Crook" audiences consist of very old
men, solid men, men of standing and
position, and the nearer the stage one
looks the mote numerous the bald heads
become. This is as it should be. They
are no doubt there to crowd "Young
America" out. Boston Post.
Nineteen years ago a Tennessee father

to its original
color, with the gloss and fresh nrss of

though not alwaya, cured by iu
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where the follicles are destroyed, or
the glands atrophied and decayed;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a new growth of
hair in produced. Instead of fouling
the hair with a pasty sediment, it
w ill keep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional use will prevent the hair
from turning pray or fulling ott,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the scalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff, which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
