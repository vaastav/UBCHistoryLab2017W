Do Not Prove Fire^Proof When
Put to the Test
NEW YORK'S TWO TALLEST BUILDINGS
Burned Just as Handily as One-Story Cottages, But Did Not
Collapse or Fall on the Firemen —Loss
Associated Tress Special Wire
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.—ln a blinding rain
storm tonight the massive block of buildings
on Broadway, number.- 2511 to 259, and in-
eluded between Murray and Warrenstreets,
was almost destroyed by fire. Within three
hours more than a million dollars' worth
of property was destroyed. The fire began
in the live-story brick building occupied by
the men's furnishing firm of Rogers, Peet
It Co., on the southwest corner of Broad
way and Warren streets. Adjoining the
Rogers-Peet building and south of it was
tire magnificent white building oi the Home
Lite Insurance company, aud next to this
was the brown stone building of tlie Postal
Telegraph company, erected at a cost of
millions only a few years ago.
IT WAS PICTURBSQUB
Within a few minutes after the discovery
of the lire the Rogers-1 Yet building was a
roaring furnace, and an alarm bad been
turned in which brought out more than a
score of engines. It Waa but a short time
when tin- flames had eaten thtuugiTthe wall
of the Home Lite and were ro.il ing bigli
above that lofty structure. Thousands
people had gathered on the seen* and tin
blinding glare of the flames lit up the lower
part Of tlie city. Even in the downpour
tbe great crowds of people grew and tin
police were called out from many stations
and kept the people back for block-. Qreal
showers of sparks were carried in all direc
lions by the gale that blew sixty miles an
hour. It was a picturesque fire.
PRIVATE PAPERS LOST
The Home Life Insurance building was
occupied by that Company and a large num
ber of prominent men in Various lines ot
business. Every effort was made to save
the valuable papers stored in some of the
offices, but many of them were lost. The
offices of the rapid transit commission were
or the ninth Moor of this building, and it
is beleved all the plans and schemes ol
work with which the commission hns been
working these many years have been de-
In the Postal building, as Well, there were
many setious losses of a private nature,
and when the Harms reached the operating
room o,' this itructure, which they did
within thrte hours of the outbreak, the
one or two solitary operators who remained
at their posts were compelled to flee for
their lives, leaving unsent messages at the
hays.
Tlie lire burned even more fiercely in the
Home Life building, owing to the great
height of tbis structure, ami in an incred
ibly short time the upper half of this mag
nificent building was in flames. The water
towers in the streets were able to throw
their heavy streams only into the lower
part of the structure and the firemen, al
though they worked with great bravery and
untiring energy In the blinding smoke and
beat, could do little in the face of such a
fierce sweep of flame and gale. It was only
a question of time when the Postal building,
so far as the upper stories were concerned,
went the way of the others.
ESTIMATES OK LOSS
The estimate of the losses by Chief Bon
ner, after midnight, was a million dollars,
with a probability of a still lurther loss
should the fire continue to make anything
like rapid progress. At that hour he be
lieved be bad the fire under control within
reasonable limits. At 2 o'clock, however,
it was still burning fiercely in front, and al
though not observable by the thousands of
people, was burning slill more fiercely and
extending lower down in the roar.
An insurance man roughly estimates the
losses at about as follows:
Rogers, Peet 4. Co., building, stock and
losses to ol her tenants, $3.K1,000.
Home Life Insurance company, building
and losses toother tenants, $500,000.
The Postal Telegraph company, building
and looses to tenants, $100,000.
Losses to surrounding buildings, $50,000.
Chief Homier thought that this estimate
on the basis of a million dollars' loss was
about, as near correct as was possible to
make.
The ltogers-Peet building wns tbe prop
erty of the Hoffman estate, and was_one of
the historic buildings of Broadway. It was
erected 35 years ago.
Tbe fire started from three explosions.
What caused the explosions the firemen
could not find out. They thought gas had
escaped in some manner in the basement,
and, so resulted iv explosion and lire.
The Postal Telegraph company officials
say that all their wires have been burned out,
find that they have no connections from
their building.
The Hardware club's quarters, which were
on the top floor of the Postal building, were
ruined. Their loss, is heavy. Tbe Home
Insurance building wns one of the hand
somest on Broadway, nnd was supposed to
be absolutely fireproof. its summit was
280 feet nbove the sidewalk. Leading ar
chitects of the country submitted plans for
its construction.
WHERE IT STARTED
The fire started in the rear of the base
ment of the building occupied by Rogers,
Peel & Co., clothing, about 9:3o>ocloc-k. Two
policemen standing within half a block of
Warren street, heard a loud explosion and
a moment later saw a thin line of smoke
curling up from the side of the Rogers, Peet
4- Co. building. At that time rain was fall
ing in torrents and the wind blew a gale. An
alarm was sen.t in, but before the first en
gine turned into Broadway the Rogers, Peet
k Co. basement was a roaring furnace, with
One Million Dollars
grout flames bunting through tho Moore
above and l ushing fiercely to the root. With
in (en minutes five alarm! had been sent in,
bringing engine after engine to the scene.
Hy Id oclock, so rapidly and fiercely did
the flamei make progress, that there wai
nothing but the shell of the Roger*, Peel
& Co. building left, with mountains of Hanu
roaring a hundred feet in tbe air anil en
circling the adjoining structure, tbe Horn.
Life Insurance building. In- the blinding
rain the liremen worked, stretching the
black and slippery lines of hose through the
building, lighting tbe Haines from every side.
GROSSES THE STREET
Soon a great wave of fire swept across
Warren street and caught the I'nited States
Life insurance building at the west conic
of Broadway, Nbs. 2.T0 and 261. Tin.'wood
work on a dozen windows was afire in^n'mo
ment and from that time on several streams
were played on this building to save it from
dest ruction.
When the Warren street wall ol the Rog
ers, I'iet, building fell at 10:30 oclock. a
dozen firemen were directly beneath, Sev
eral of the men were struck hy bricks, but
none was more than slightly injured. . Act
ing Chief i'erle Ceil but was dragged to sale
ty by some of his men.
THE THIRD VICTIM
dust before 11 oclock Home Lile In
surance company's building, sixteen stories
high, at 2f>s and 207 Broadway, caught lire.
The firemen already had their lines in this
building up to the seventh fioor. They were
greatly handicapped hy tbe many stories.
Flames had eaten their way through the
side wall in many places and the huge white
structure burned fiercely. Tbe elevators
made trips up and down. The men running
tbe cages were compelled to Bee for their
lives and in this way many of the effects of
tbe offices were saved.
The three top floors were on fire almost
simultaneously from the beginning. The
smoke was dense. Flames shut high above
the roof and over the massive biownstoue
Postal building, and everybody al. work in
the structure had been ordered out of this
building long before.
Desperate c fforts were being made to save
it. The interior of the Home Life Insurance
building was by this time a furnace. By
this time from the windows of the six or
eight upper stories the flame.; were pouring
in masst;s. In the rear nine stories were
afire and the lire department, so far as t his
portion of the building was concerned, was
absolutely powerless.
THE niG POSTAL BUILDING
At 11:10 the Postal budding of fourteen
stories, caught lire. Chief Homier, who bad
charge of the firemen, took |he elevator and
went to the roof to give personal directions.
Alt this time there)werelal iew operators who
had ignored the orders of the fire chief, two
or three clerks and a few boys at work in
the building, working in smoke, and mes
sages were sent until the dames came and
made them run for their lives. The unsent
messages were left at the telegraph keys.
Chief Homier had under his direction all
the engines stationed in tbe lire houses be
low Twenty-third street, [v addition five
hook and ladder companies, including water
towers, were at the seer.*. Most of the men
worked in the lower parts of the building to
save adjoining buildings. Only a few gangs
were with the fire chief on the top of the
Postal building. They fought with all their
strength to keel) the flames back. Put, not
uithstanding all their efforts, at, 1 oclock
this (Monday) morning three floors of Ihe
building had been partially destroyed. The
fire was then working its way downward.
UNDER CONTROL
Chief Bonner thouch:, however, lhat he
had it under control. He did not expect to
get much below the stores now burning.
At 2:3(1 Chief Bonner went home, saying
that the fire would burn itself out in a short
time and that it could not spread, and was
practically out.

Fire early this morning wrecked the end
of St. Agnes' Catholic church on Fifty
third street near Third a\enu», destroying

A SHIP ON FIRE
A German Steamer Standing by to
Give Aid
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.—The Herman
steamer Dalrearli, from Rio, which arrived
today, when in latitude37.4B, longitude 75.57,
came alongside of a ship ablaze from tbe
stern to foremast, while a large yellow fun
nelled German steam-hip was standing near
flu- flaming wreck. Nobody could be seen
on the deck of the binning vessel, nor were
there any boats struggling amid tbe waves,
so it is probable that the crew weic rescued
by the steamship which was waiting to note
tlie end.
After steaming around the wreck twice
the Dalrearli proceeded on her way. The
steamer by the burning'ship was either the
Wer ra or the b'ulda, of the North German
Uoyd line. Both vessels sailed in company
from this port last week bound for Havre.

Traffic Almost Paralyzed
Associated Press Special Wire
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. i.—A heavy
rainstorm which began here yesterday con
tinued all today, increasing in violence, ac
companied by winds of almost gale velocity.
Shortly betorc midnight there was a clear
sky. At the maximum the wind blew 42
miles an hour. Telegraph wires from this
city south were rendered almost useless on
account of the heavy wind. Trees, swing
ing signs and chimneys were blown down,
but no great damage is known U> have re
sulted.
T\ few dispatches received at the maritime
exchange told of a very heavy northeaster
prevailing at the Delaware breakwater and
other points along the New Jersey coast.
At many points the tide rose to the highest
point it has reached in years.
At Atlantic City great damage was caused
to w ires, and tho city is in comparative dark
ness tonight. Several private residences
on the meadows were completely surrounded
by Water, compelling occupants to use boats
in going to and irom buildings.
Reports from Eastern Pennsylvania in

All Hands Lost
NEW YORK, Dec. 4.—The Nova Scotian
schooner Wallecfa arrived today from Gon
aives, and reports that during the height of
tiie hurricane on November 28, in latitude
30.22, longitude 7.1!, she sighted a dismantled
schooner of about 700 tons Hying signals of
distress. It was nearly dark at the time,
and her crew could be seen on the decks
gesticulating front ically for assistance. The
Walleda bore down on tbe stranger, and got
close under her lee and hailed her.
They shouted that the vessel was sinking
and asked to be taken off.
Captain Kemp told them that his boats
j were stove in and useless. They said they
would come to tbe Walleda with their own
boats. During tbis time tbe Walleda laid
to, but found she was rapidly drifting to lee
ward, and wae then about on quarter tack,
and after several tacks managed to cross tbe
bow of the wreck, and again drifted down to
the leeward port. The Walleda hailed again,
but got no answer. In the meantime, an
t other three-masted schooner came to her as
i instance, and assumed a position to the wind
-1 ward of the wreck. Both of them stood by
until daylight. When morning broke tbe
wreck was seen to be deserted aad the boats
gone. It is supposed that the unfortunate
men had attempted to launch their boat
during the night, which capsized, and all
hands were lost.

THE AUDIENCE IS WAITING
For the Play to Begin on the
tional Stage
THE CURTAIN TO RISE AT NOON TODAY
The Only Business Likely to Receive Attention Is Embraced
in the Money Budgets and an Increase of
the Regular Army
Associated Press Special Wlrei .
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 -The curtain
will ring up tomorrow at noon on the clos
ing session oi the Fifty-fifth congress. The
war and the fruits of the American victory
curry in their wake many problems Which
the national legislators must solve. Bui
though many questions may press tor solu
tion, the brief space covered by tins session,
which expires by limitation March 4th. pre
cludes the probability of much being accom
plished beyond the passage of the regular
money budgets, the legislation for the ill
crease of the regular army, which tlie ad
ministration deems necessary to meet the
result of the war, and probably the enact
ment of a law to give a permanent territor
ial government to the Hawaiian islands.
This covers all the important legislation
which the congressional leaders expect to
see enacted at tbis session, It is almost
the unanimous sentiment of tlie members
lhat no attempt should be made to legislate
concerning the possessions acquired by the
war with Spain at this session.
There arc earnest advocates of the Nicara
gua canal who will strive to secure tlie pass
age of a canal bill now, and in this they may
possibly be successful, but neither it, nor
any of the measures like the pooling bill,
anti-scalpers' bill, etc., which have strong!
friends, will be allowed to interfere with the
bills, the passage of which is deemed abso
lutely necessary to prevent an extra ses
sion.
NO EXTRA SESSION.
The leaders at both ends of the capitol
have put their heads together at the be
ginning of tbe session and are bent upon the
idea of avoiding an extra session. With
this purpose in view, the appropriation bills j
are to be given the road at both ends of tbe
capitol and pressed through with all possi
ble haste. The sub-committee on appro
priations of the house has been at work for
a week. The deficiency bill to meet the
ordinary expeuses of the army and navy
during the six months from January 1, 1898,
to Jttly 1, is ready to submit to the full
committee tomorrow, and the regular Dis- j
trict of Columbia appropriation bill will be
ready By the end of the week. It is neces-1
say that the former should become a law I
before the holiday recess, which this year is
to be shorter than usual, and Chairman Can- j
nan hopes to see it through the bouse and in
the senate before the end of this week.
The Democrats of the house have not dis
closed thiir position, but it is not believed!
they will seek to obstruct any appropria
tion bill necessary for the maintenance of'
an army now in the field. Should there be I
a disposition to open up and prolong a de-|
bate upon the. conduct, of the war. upon this
bill, if. is safe to assume that the committee
on rules will be invoked to bring in an order
to close the debate.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
Great interest is manifested in the presi
dent's message, which will De submitted lo :
congress tomorrow, on account of the many
questions which it will have to deal with, !
and no presidential message in years has
been listened to with the eagc-ness j
the interest with which President i
McKinley's message will be heard to
morrow. The reading of the message will
occupy probably two hours. The first thing |
in order after Speaker Reed calls the house
to order tomorrow will be a call of the roll j
to determine the presence of a quorum, j
Concerning this there is littie doubt, as!
members are arriveing by every train audi
tbe hotel lobbies are already thronged with I
them. A quorum having been developed, |
committees will be appointed to wait upon
the president and the senate to inform them
that the bouse is ready to proceed to husi
nss. Pending the arrival of tlie president's
message, several members electd to till va
cancies caused by deaths or resignations will
be sworn in, and immediately after the read-!
j ing of the message is completed, the house
, will adjourn out of respect to the memory of I
I .Messrs. Love of Mississippi and Northwayi
;of Ohio, who died during the recess. On I
, Tuesday or Wednesday at the latest the
! house will plunge into the work. Chairman
: Cannon will have the deficiency bill ready
and it will occupy the attention of the house
lo the exclusion of everything else for the
remainder of the week.
REED HAS ARRIVED
The hotels arc rapidly filling up with mem
bers of congress preparatory to the opening
j session tomorrow. Included in the arrivals
today was Speaker Reed, who paid a nmn
! her of congressional calls during tbe after
| noon and evening.
SENATE FORECAST
Members Anxious to Dispose of the
Business Promptly
Senators express a determination 'to take
up the work of the session vigorously- in the
beginning, with the hope of getting well
advanced before the holidays, and they are
counting upon taking up the appropriation
I bills al a very early date tor the purpose of
I preventing an extra session due to any fail
ure on the part of the national budget. It
is expected that the army deficiency biil
wili reach Ihe senate during tbe present
week, the understanding at the north end of
the capitol being that the house will dispose
of it within a very few days after assem
bling. The commtitee on appropriations
will bring it in early, for the double purpose
of having it passed quickly and of testing
the feeling of senators on questions con
necteel with the war.
The first day's session will be given up
almost entirely to the messnge and there is
great interest manifested in hearing the
minutes and details of the president's rec
ommendations. After the reading of the
message, the senate will adjourn till the
next day. All plans for legislation of gen
eral scope awaits the promulgation of this
document, and, as a consequence, one hears

far less than usual of measure! to be in*
troduced.
It is impossible to say what matters will
oceiii.v the week after the disposal of the
message, but it is probable that some
speeches tnay be delivered upon the policy
indicated by the message, and also that the
calendar may be taken up. t here are
many measures which have been reported
I and there will be no difficulty to find employ
inent it the senate is disposed to settle t»
routine hi early in the session.
During the closing days of the last se»
sion Senator .Morgan gave notice of his in
tention to cull up the Nicaragua canal bill
at the bt ginning of the present session. He
unquestionably will redeem his promise, and
would doubtless seek the first opportunity
but for t he possibility of change of sentiment
in favor of having the government under*
take tlie entire responsibility of building
the cina!. All the indications are that
thi- i|iu -tion will be one of the most impor
tant subjects under consideration during
the session.
Opposition is developing lo ihe bill which
the Hawaiian commission will bring in and
for which early consideration will be asked.
There is a considerable contingent in the
senate opposed lo constituting the islanda
into a territory because of the apprehension
that they may be converted into a state,
and deliberate consideration of the subject
1 will be asked.
While it is quite too early to reach a
definite conclusion, there are decided indi
cations of a disposition on the part of the
senate to confine the session's work to rou
tine measures and the appropriation bills,
and it need surprise no one if the close of
the session would demonstrate that this
general policy had been pursued.

RANCH PROPERTY

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 4. —A dispatch,
to the Journal from Chihuahua, Mex., says:
Grant 11. Gillett, the missing Kansas cat
tin plunger, whose sudden disappearance
so startled the financial world, arrived in
Chihuahua on November 33, and left on the
morning of the 24th for Durangu, where it
is stated that ho deposited a large sum of
money in the hank. He remained only a
shor. time iv DurangO, when he bought a
return ticket lo Chihuahua.
Two prominent business nier.: of this city
came up from DurangO on the same train
with him and stated that he bought a first
class ticket and rode in a second class coach
as tar .is Torreon, where he took the Pull
man.
The gentlemen got into conversation with
him and he said lie had made considerable
money in Colorado in the general merchan
dise business, and that he was in Mexico
with a view of investing in a ranch or
mining property. He conversed quite free
ly upon various topics, referring occasion
ally to the cattle business. He was well*
dressed and wore several beautiful dia
monds.
At Jiminez he was met by his attorney,
C. R. Troxel, and the two entered into low
conversation and remained together until
they reached Chihuahua. They arrived here
last Monday and went to the leading hotel,
where they registered.
The man was undoubtedly Gillett, at
his signature corresponded with his signa
ture to a document heid in this city.
Troxel left Tuesday on the stage for the
west, presumably to the mining camps in
the Sierra Madre mountains.
(iillett is still in the city, but his where
abouts arc unknown, except to the de
tectives who are closely shadowing his ev
ery movement.
The report that Gillett has been arrested
and held iv custody here is untrue. The
Jefe Politico says tbe Mexican authorities
have not seen him and know nothing of hie
w hereabouts.
He will be arrested immediately upon a
warrant from the authorities of the United
States, who are expscted to arrive soon
from El Paso. Their baggage is all in this
city and on one of the trunks is the tag
with the name C. R. Troxel.
Three letters which have arrived at the
hotel for (1. G. Gillett have mysteriously
disappeared.
