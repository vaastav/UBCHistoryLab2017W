AN ANNEXATION MOVEMENT.-Thu
British oolooibta retudent iu New York
huid a meeting on 23d alt., for tho pur?
pose of organizing a colonial anuexutiou
movement. Representatives of Cuuudi?,
New BruuHwiok, No vu Scotia, Prince Ed?

iu a pledge to sastain tho projeot of e
union of all these colonies with tut
United States, and measures wero taken
to secure the oo-operalion of thou
brethren in Chicago, St. Louis, Buffalc
aud other places. Tho speakers at th I
meeting dwelt upon the projeot of un
nexation with great earnestness, cou
tending that it is as sure of cousumma
tion os it is certain that England ii
losing faith in the colonial Bystem, and,
therefore, that tho question should bi
ouusidered calmly with reference ' - con
tingenoies uot remote. As the ournn
of Commerce remarks, these get lemei
mean well, but tbey will fail to get u]
any enthusiasm over aanexation at thi
time. The advance of tho ?labami
claims towards settlement bas stoppet
tbe aunexatiunieta in the United State
from asking fur Canada as au offset ti
those claims. And, on the other hand
a community that went into moral fit
