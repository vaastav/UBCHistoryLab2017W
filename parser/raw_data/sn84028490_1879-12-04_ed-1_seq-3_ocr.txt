dlnate grades in the great Departments
wascondetuned, and examinations, as
to capacity, to be conducted by depart
mental boards of examiners, were pro
vided lor and made eonditions of
" admissioD to the public service. These
statutes are a decision by Congress that
examinations of some sort, as to attain
ments and capacity, are essential to the
well-being of the public service. The
important questions Bince the enact
ment of these laws have been as to the
character of these examinations, and
whether official favor and partisan in
fluence,' or common right and merit,
were to control the access to the exam
inations. In practice, these examina
tions have not always been open to
' worthy persons generally, who might
' wish to be examined. Official favorit
ism and partisan influence, as a rule
appear to havelesignated those who
alone were permitted to go before the
examining-boards, subjecting even the
examiners to a pressure from the
friends of the candidates very difficult
to resist. As a consequence, the
standard of admission fell below that
which the public interest demand
ed. It was almost inevitable
ble that a system which provided for
various separate boards of examiners,
with no common supervision or uni
form method of procedure, should re
sult in confusion, inconsistency, and
inadequate tests of capacity highly
detrimental to the public interests. A
further and more radical change was
obviously required.
In the annual message of 'December,
1870, my predecessor declared that
"there is no duty which so much em
barasse3 the Executive and heads of
Departments as that of appointments :
nor is there any such arduous and
thankless labor imposed on Senators
and Representatives as that of finding
places tor constituents. The present
system does not secure the best men,
and often not evenlit men foi the pub
lic places. The elevation and purifica
tion of the civil service of the Govern
ment will be hailed with approval by
the whole people of the United States.
Congress accordingly passed the act,
approved March ad, 1871, "to regulate
the civil service of the United States
and promote the efficiency thereoif,"
giving the necessary authority to the
Executive to inaugurate a civil service
reform.
Acting under this statute, which was
interpreted as intended to secure a sys
tem of just and effectual examinations
under uniform supervision, a number
of eminently competent persons were
selected for the purpose, who entered
with zeal upon the discharge of their
duties, prepared, with an intelligent
appreciation of the requirements of
the service, the regulations contem
Dlated. and took charge of the exami
nations, and who, in their capacity as a
board, nave been Known as tne "uvn
Service Commission." Congress for
two years appropriated the money
needed for the compensation and for
the expense of carrying on the work
of the Commission.
The Civil Service Commission.
It appears from the report of the
Commission, submitted to the President
in April. 1874, that examinations had
been held in various sections of the
country, and that an appropriation of
about $25,000 would be required to
meet the annual expenses, including
salaries, involved in discharging the
duties of the Commission. The report
was transmitted to congress by special
message of April 18th, 1874, with the
following favorable comment upon the
labors ot the Commission: Mr sus
tained by Congress, I have no doubt the
rules can, after the experience gained,
be so improved and enforced as to still
more materially benefit the public ser
vice and relieve the Executive, Mem
bers of Congress, and the heads of De
partments, from influences prejudicial
to good administration. The rules, as
they have hitherto been enforced, have
" resulted beneficially, as is shown by the
opinions of the members of the Cabinet

ber of the same year similar views are
exuresseu. and an appropriation lor
continuing the work of the Commission
again advised.
The appropriation was not made, and,
as a consequence, the active work of the
Commission was suspended, leaving the
Commission itself still in existence.
Without the means, therefore, of caus
incr Qualifications to be tested in any
systematic manner, or of securing for
the public service the advantages of
competition upon any extensive plan, i
recommended in my annual message of
December, 1877, tne mamng or an an-
propriation for the resumption of the
worn or ine commission.
In the meantime, however, corapetl
tive examinations under many embar
rassments have been conducted within
limited spheres m the Executive De
partments in Washington, and in a
number of the custom-houses and post
offices of the principal cities of the
country, with a view to further test
their effects, and, in every instance,
they have been found to be as salutary
a3 they are stated to have been under
the administration of my predecessor.
I think the economy, purify, and the
efficiency of the public service, would
be ereatlv promoted by their systematic
introduction, wherever practicable,
throughout the entire civil service of
the Government, together with ample
provision for their general supervision,

Reports from the Secretary of the
Interior, from the Postmaster-General,
from the postmaster in the city or JNew
. York, where such examinations have
been some time on trial, and also from
the collector of the port, the naval
officer, and the surveyor in that city,
and from the postmasters and collectors
in several ot the other large cities,
Bhow that the competitive system,
where applied, has, in various ways.
contributed to improve tne puunc ser
vice. m
The reports show that the results
nave been salutary in a marseu degree,
and that the general application of sim
ilar rules cannot fail to be of decided
benefit to the service,
The reports of the Government ofli
cers. in the city of New York, especial
ly, bear decided testimony to the utility
of open competitive examinations in
their respective offices, showing that
"these examinations, and the excellent
aualiflcntions of those admitted to the
service through them, have had a
marked incidental effect upon the per
sons previously in the service, and par
ticularly upon those aspiring to promo
tion. There has been, on the part of
these latter, an increased interest in the
work, and a desire to extend acquaint
ance with it beyond the particular desk
occupied, and thus themoraZe of the
entire rorco has been raised.
The examinations have been attended
by many citizens who have had an op
portunity to thoroughly investigate the
Bcope and character or the tests and the
method of determining the results, and
those visitors have, without exception,
approved the methods employed, and
several of them have publicly attested
their favorable opinion."
Upon such considerations, I deem it
my duty to renew th recommendation
contained in my annual message of De
cember, 1877, requesting Congress to
make ttie necessary appropriation for
the resumption of the work of the
Civil-Service Commission. Economy
will be promoted by authorizing a mod
erate compensation to persons in the
public service who may perform extra
labor upon or under the Commission,
as the Executive may direct.
1 am convinced that it a just and ad
equate test of merit is .enforced for
admission to the public service and in
making promotions, such abuses as re
movals without good cause and partisan
and official interference with the proper
exercise of the appointing power, will
in large measure disappear.
There are ottior administrative
abuses to which the attention of Con
gress should be naked in this connec
tion. Mere partisan appointments, anu
the constant peril of removal without
cause, very naturally lead to an absorb
ing and misclievlous political activity,
on the part of those thus appoint,
which not only lnterteres with the uue
discharge of official duty, but is incom
patible witn tne rreeuom ot elections.
Not without warrant, in the views of
several of my predecessors in the Pres
dential office, and directly within the
law of 1871, already cited, I endeavored,
by regulation, made on the 22d of June,
1877, to put some reasonable limits to
such abuses. It may not be easy, and
it mav never perhaps be necessary, to
define with precision the proper limit of
political action on the part of the Fed
eral officers. But while their right to
hold and freely express their opinions
cannot be questioned, it is very plain
that they should neither be allowed to
devote to other subjects the time
needed for the proper discharge of their
official duties, nor to use the authority
of their office to enforce their own
opinions, or . to coerce the political
action ot those who Hold uitterent
opinions.
Itesisons of justice and public policy,
quite analogous to those which forbid
tne use of official power for the op
pression of the private citizen, impose
upon the Government the duty of pro
tecting its officers and agents from
arbitrary exactions. In whatever
aspect considered, the practice of mak
ing levies, for party purposes, upon the
salaries of officers is highly demoraliz
ing to the public service and discredit
able to the country. Though an officer
should be as free as any other citizen
to give his money in aid of his opinions
or his party, he should also be as free as
mv other citizen to refuse to mako such
gilts. If salaries are but a fair com
pensation tor the time and labor of the
officer, it is gross injustice to lew a tax
upon them. If they are made excessive
in order that they may bear the tax,
the excess is an indirect robbery of the
public lumis.
1 recommend, therefore, such a re
vision and extension of present statutes
as shall secure to those in every grade
of official life or public employment the
protection with which a great and en-
ightened Nation should guard those
who are faithful in its service.
The neglected Appropriations.
The appropriation for judicial ex
penses, which has heretofore been
made tor the Department of J ustice in
gross, was subdivided at the last session
or congresss, and no appropriation
whatever was made for the payment of
the fees of Marshalsand their deputies,
either inHhe service of process or for
the discharge of other duties ; and since
June 30th, these officers have continued
the performance of their duties with
out compensation from thcGovernment,
taking upon themselves the necessary
incidental outlays, as well as rendering
their own services. In onlv a few un
avoidable instances has the proper exe
cution or tne process or the united
States failed by reason of the absence
of the requisite appropriation. This
course of official conduct on the part of
tnese omcers, rngiuy creditable to their
fidelity, was advised by the Attorney
General, who informed them, however,
that they would necessarily have to
rely for their compensation upon the
prospect ot future legislation by Con
gress. i tnereiore especially recom
mend that immediate appropriation be
mane oy congress tor this purpose.
The act making the principal appro
priation for the Department of Justice
it previous sessions has uniformly con
tained the following clause: "And for
defraying the expenses which may be
incurreu in me enforcement ot tne act
approved February 28th, 1870, entitled
'An act to amend an act approved May
Bum, ii0, entitled an 'Act to enforce
the right of citizens of the United
States to vote in the several States of
the united States, and for other pur
poses, or any acts amendatory thereot
or supplementary thereto.
No appropriation was made for this
purpose for the current year. As no
general election for members of Con
gress occurred, the omission was a mat
ter of little practical importance. Such
election will, however, take place dur
ing tne coming year, and the appropria
tion made for the pay of Marshals and
deputies should be sufficient to em
brace compensation lor the services
they may be required to perform at
such elections.
The Indians.
The reports of the Secretary of the
Interior and of the Commissioner of
Indian, Affairs, setting forth the present
state of our relations with the Indian
tribes on our territory, the measures
taken to advance their civilization and
prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them will be found of more
than ordinary interest. The general
conduct of our Indian population has
been so satisfactory that tne occur
rence of two disturbances, which re
sulted in bloodshed and destruction of
property, is all the more to be la
mented.
The history of the outbreak on the
wniteuiver ute reservation m west
ern Colorado has become so familiar by
elaborate reports in the public pressJ
that its remarkable incidents need not
be stated here in detail. It is expected
t.hiit the settlement of this difficulty
will lead to such arrangements as will
prevent further hostile contact between
the Indians and the border settlements
in Western Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at
the Mesealero Agency, New Mexico,
where Victoria, the head of a small
band of marauders, after committing
many atrocities, being vigorously
chased by a military force, made his
way across the Mexican border and is
now on foreign soil.
While these occurrences, in. which a
comparatively small number of Indians
were engaged, are most deplorable, a
vnst maiontv of our Indian population
have fully justified the expectations of
those who believa that by humane and
peaceful influences the Indians can be
led to abandon the habits of savage
life and to dovelop a capacity for useful
and civilized occupations. What they
have already accomplished in the
pursuit of agricultural and mechanical
work, the remarkable success which
has attended the experiment of employ
inc as freighters a class of Indians hith
erto counted among the wildest and
most intractable, and the general and
urgent desire expressed by them for the
education or tneir children, may do
taken as a sufficient proof that they
will 1)0 found capable of accomplish-
incr much moro if thev bo wisely and
fairly guided. The "Indian policy"
sketched in the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, the object of which is
to make liberal provision for the educa
tion of Indian youth, to settle the in
dians upon farm-lots in severalty, to
give them title in tee to their tarms,
inalienable for a certain number o
years, and when their wants are thus
provided for, to dispose by sale of the
lands on their reservations not occupied
and used by them, a fund to be formed
out of the proceeds for the benefit of
the Indians, which will gradually re
lieve the Govornrnent of the expenses
now provided for by the annual appro
priations, must commend itself aa just
and benelicial to the Indians, and as
also calculated to remove those obstruc
tions which the existence of large res
ervations presents to the settlement
and development of the country. I
therefore earnestly recommend the en
actment of a law enabling the Govern
ment to give Indians a title In lee,
inalienable for twenty-five years, to the
farm lands assigned to them by allot
ment. I also report the recommenda
tions made in my first annual message,
that a law be passed admitting Indians
who can give satisfactory proof of hav
ing, by their own labor, supported their
families for a number of years, and
who are willing to detach themselves
from their tribal relations, to the ben
efit of the homestead act, and to grant
them patents containing the same pro
vision ot inalienability tor a certain
period.
Educating the Indians.
The experiment of sending a number
of Indian children, of both sexes, to the
Hampton Normal and Agricultural
Institute, in Virginia, to receive an ele
mentary English education and practi
cal instruction in farming and other
useful industries, has led to results so
promising that it was thought expedi
ent to turn over the cavalry barracks,
at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania, to the
Interior Department for the establish
ment of an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has uow 158 pupils,
selected from various tribes, and is in
full operation. Arrangements are made
tor tne education ot a number ot In-
dian boys and girls belonging to tribes
on the Pacific slope, in a similar man
mer, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These
institutions will commend themselves
to the liberality of Congress and to the
philanthropic munificence of the Amer-
can people. .Last spring information
was received of the organization of an
extensive movement in the Western
States, the object of which was the oc
cupation by unauthorized persons of
certain lands in the Indian Territory
ceded by the Chcrokees to the Govern
ment tor the purpose of settlement by
other Indian tribes.
Changing the Control.
a
control of the Indian service should be
made was in the Forty-filth Congress
referred to a joint committee of both
Houses tor inquiry and report. In mv
last annual message I expressed the
hope that the decision of that question,
then in prospect, "would arrest further
ngitation ot this subiect. such agitation
being apt to produce a disturbing eff ect
upon the service as well as the Indians
themselves." Since then, the commit
tee having reported, the question has
ueen ueuiuuu in cue negative oy a vote
in the House of Representatives.
i or the reason here stated, and m
view of the tact that further uncer
tainty on this point will be calculated
to obstruct other much-needed legisla
tion, to weaken the discipline of tho
service, and to unsettle salutary meas
ures now in progress for the Govern
ment and lmprovemenftorthe Indians,
I respectfully recommend that the
decision arrived at by Congress at its
last session be permitted to stand.
The Treasury Department.
The attention of Congress is called to
the annual report of the Secretary of
the Treasury on the condition of the
public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all
sources for the fiscal year ended June
30th, 1879, were $273,827,184 40 ; the
ordinary expenditures for the same
period were 2(iO.'J 40.883.54 : leaving a
surplus revenue for tho year of $0,877,-
3UU.U3
lho receipts for the present fiscal
year, ending June 30th, 1880, actual and
estimated, are as follows: Actual
receipts for tho first quarter commenc
ing July 1st, 1870, $70,843,003.21 ; esti
mated receipts tor the remumdm
three-quarters of tho year, $208,150,330.-
i ; total receipts tor the current fiscal
year, actual and estimated, $288,000,000.
the expenditures tor thesame period
will be, actual ard estimated, as fol
lows: For tho quarter commencing
July 1st, 1870, actual expenditures,
$91083,385.10; and for the remaining
three-quarters ot tho year the expendi
tures are estimated at $172,310,014.00
making tho total expenditures $204,-
000,000. and leaving an estimated sur
plus revenue tor the year ending June
30tll, 1880, Ot $24,000,000. The total
receipts during the next fiscal year end
ing J une 30th, 1881, estimated according
to existing laws, will be $288,000,000;
and the estimated ordinary expenditures
for the samo period will be $278,007,
304.39 leaving a surplus of $0,002,035.01
ior that year.
The large amount expended tor ar
rears of pensions during the last and
the present fiscal year, amounting to
$21,747,210 60, has prevented the applica
tion ot the tun amount required by law
to tho sinking fund for the current
year; but these arrears having been
substantially paid, it is believed
that the sinking fund can hereafter be
maintained without any change of ex
isting law.
The War Department.
The Secretary of War reports that the
War Department estimates tor tne fis
cal year ending June 80th, 1881, are
$40,380,428 03. the same being for a less
sum of money than any annual estimate
rendered to congress tor that Depart
ment during a period of at least twelve
years. lie concurs with the General of
the Armv in recommending such legis
lation as will authorize the enlistment
of the full number of 25,000 men for the
line of the Army, exclusive of the 3,403
men required tor detached auty. anu
therefore not available for service in
the Held. lie also demands that Con
gress be asked to provide by law for
the disposition ot a large number or
abandoned military posts and reserva
tions, which, though very valuable in
themselves, have been rendered useless
for military purposes by the advance of
civilization and settlement.
The Secretary of War further reports,
that the work for the impiovement of the
South Pass of the Mlsa ssippl River.under
contract with Mr. James IS. Eads, made
In pursuance of an act of Congress, has

The Navy.
The renort of the Secretary of the Nayy
shows continued' Improvement in that
branch of the service during the lant fiscal
year. Extensive repairslisve been made
upon vessels and two newshipshave been
completed and made ready for sea. The
renort of the Secretary shows the gratify
lnit fact that among all the disbursing of
ficers of the pay corps of the Navy there
is not one who is a dofaulterto the extent
of single dollar. I unite with him in reo

The Postoffice Department.
Tho report of the Postmaster Genoral
bears testimony to the general revival of
business throughout the country. The
receipts of tho Postofllce Department for
the fiscal year ended June 30, were 830,
Oll.OSH SO, being 8764,105 01 more than the
revenuos or the preceding year. Tue
amount realized from the sale of postage
stamps, stamped envelopos, and postal
cards, was $7(31,455 01 more than In the
preceding year, and f-,37,Z5'J 2i more
tban in 1877. The expenditures of
the Department were ?33,14!),899 45, of
which sum of $370,401 03 was paid on nu
bilities occurred in preceding years; The
expenditures during the year were $301 ,
20!) 77 less than in the preceding year.
This reduction is to be attributed mainly
to the operation ot tho law passed June
17, 1878, changing the compensation of
postmasters from a comminsion on the
value oi stamps sold, to a commission on
stamps cancelled.
xne postmaster uenerai recommends
an amendment of the law regulating the
increase of compensation for increased
speed ou star routes, so as to enable him
to advertise for proposals for such in
creased sorvice and Bpeed. He also sug
gests the advantages to accrue to the com

mail between ports of the United States
and ports of the West Indies and South
America, at a fixed maximum price per
mile, the amount to bo expended being
regulated by annual appropriations, in
like manner with the amount paid for tho
domestic star service.
Department of Agriculture.
My recommendations in former mes'
sages are renewed in lavorof enlarging
tLe faculties ot the Department of Agn-
culture. Agriculture is the loading in
terest and the permanent industry of our
people, it is the hduikI u-e ot agricultur
al prrduction as compared with
our home consumption, and the
largely increased and highly profitable
market abroad which we have enjoyed in
recent years, that wearo mainly indobtod
lor our present prosperity as a people.
We must look for its continued mainte
nance to tuoauuio siuiHtautial resourco
There is no branch ol industry in which
labor, directed by soienlilui knowledge,
yields such increased production in cjiu
narisou with unskilled labor, and no
branch of the public service to which me
encouragement of liberal appropriations
can be more appropriately extended. The
omission to rendor such aid is' not a wise
economy; but, on the contrary, undoubt
edly results in losses of immense sums
annually that might be saved tnrougti

to promote this vital Interest.
Washington Monument.
The Joint Commission oreated by the
act of Congress of August 2, 1870, for the
purpose ot superviHing and directing tne
completion of the Washington National
Monument, of which Commission the
President is a member, has elven careful
attention to this subject, and already the
strengthening of the foundation has so
tar progressed as to insure the entire suc
cess of this part of the work. A massive
layer of masonry has been introduced
below the original foundation, widening
the base, increasing the stability of the
struoture, and rendering it possible to
carry the shaft to completion. It is earn
estly recommendod that such further ap
propriations be matte ror tne continueu
prosecution of the work as may be neces
sary for tho completion of this National
Monument at an early flay.
