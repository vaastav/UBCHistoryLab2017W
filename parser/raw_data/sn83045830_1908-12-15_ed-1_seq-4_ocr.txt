The would-be Democratic party re
ergaahters of today are the same gen
tlernen who got the upper hand in
the convention of 19?-4 and nominated
their man. He was defeated by over
two aad a half millions plurality.
This element failed to control the
action of the Democratic convention
la 1S08. The candidate nominated at
Denver this year lost the election by
less than one and a quarter millions
of popular votes. But his strength
was more than one and a quarter mi>

OUR GULLIBLE MILLIONAIRES.
Every time Congress takes up th??
question of a change, ??ltIi*t upward
or downward, of the tariff schedules,
the louJeat cry for free entry of cer
tain specified articles invariably
comes from the persons who aie best
equipped tUDI lully to i>ay auy
amount of duty upon the rommodl*.
tics they wl?h lo bring here from
Europe.
I'pon the plea that the American,
artistic temperament should be whole.
Nomely developed, the Ogden Goeleta,
the J, Plerpont Morgans, the Mrs.
Jack Gardners and other in :e or less
pretentious new riches always have
contended that the purchasers abroad,
of Old Masters should be permitted!
to bring the canvases into this coun?
try without paying tribute at the cus?
tom house. True, these works of art
are hung in private galleries and tbe
part of the American public which the
owners contend is most in need of en?
lightenment along artistic lines, is not
permitted to gaze upon these marvels
of the painter's brush at'or they get
here.
Hut the rabble may lead about them
In the Sunday newspapers and be up?
lifted.
Recently, however, it has developed
that the commercial ability which en.
aides one to accumulate millions In
soap, starch or p>rk may yet leave
him shy of discriminating Judgment
when It comes to the identification of
>al Old Mastern.
The realization of this fact has pro?
duced a sort of protective union
amongst the parvenuea of Plttsburg,
an account of which Is given below:
"A general overhauling of picture
galleries of Plttsburg rich men la now
On to see how many of their paint?
ings are Spurious. The fact that
'James H. Laughlln was permlted to
pay $!*.."iiiii tor u $:tn canvas recently
has caused great excitement among
the iron and steel kings whose ideas
run to oil paintings.
' "A sort of blacklist has been start?
ed of dealers who have charged ex
horbitant prices or sold fake goods
at first-class rRtes. This list is said
to contain the names of more than
l score of New York dealers, and ful?
ly as many in London and Paris.
"Within the past vear a prominent
Pittshurger arranged to buy a pictur?
abroad for $25.000. but found
before delivery that this work of "an
old master" had been made in New
York and shipped abroad for his
benefit."
An ungifted New York knight of
the brush, without the ability to pro?
duce an acceptable American maga?
zine cover design, may execute a daub,
label it "Rembrandt" or "Raphael,'
send it to Europe end receive a fabu?
lous sum from our millionaire con
uoisseurs when they travel abroad
In search of masterpieces.
For the blessing of reading about
[these pictures, after their free return
HO the United States, we should he
willing to pay tbe proposed import
tax of five cents a pound on coffee.
Our own esteemed l.oeb has abun?
dant provocation for bringing action
against the Chinese court for infringe
ment of his copyright. A four year
old proxy has been designatej by
Prince Regent Chun who will receive
the lickings that the young emperor
hereafter may deserve.

TAKES UP SENATE'S TIME
(Continued from First Cage.)
?the President concerning this inves?
tigation by detectives showed the pro?
priety of adapting such a provision
as that embodied in his amendment.
"It seems to me." he said, "that one
of the worst features of this whole
unfortunate business is that this
man should now be pursued in this
way b> secret detectives in the man?
ner I have described."
Senator Foraker read a letter he
had written t;> Convert in which h
SHid he (the senator) would "look
after" the detcc'Ues who were visit?
ing him "at the proper time"
"That pron;i.-e mill be made good,

the criminals who took the lead 'n
the nmrilcrous shooting of private ci?
tizens ut llrownsville. it cstablisiies j
clearly the fact that the colored sol-j
filers did the shooting; but upon this.'
point further record was unnecessary, 1
as the fact that the colored soldiers
tild the shooting has already been es-j
tabllshed beyond all possibility ofj
doubt. The Investigation has not!
Rone far enough to enable us to de?
termine all the facts, and we will pro.'1
reed wiih it; but It has gone far.
i-nough to determine w ith sufficient j
accuracy certain facts of enough lni-1
portance to make it advisable that I
(dace the report before yon. it ap?
pears that almost all the members of
Company B must have been actively-1
concerned In the shooting, cither to
ihe extent of being participants or to,
ihe extent of virtually encouraging!
those who were participants. As to]
Companies (' and D. there can be no
question that practically every man
In (hem must have had knowledge
that the shot ting was dune by some
DE the soldiers of B troop, and pos?
sibly by one or two others in one ot
the other troops. This conceal-j
ment was itself a grave offense, which
?as greatly aggravate!'by their test!-,
lying before the Senate committee
thai they were Ignorant of what they?
must have knowu. Nevertheless, it
is to be raid In partial extenuation'
that they were probably cowed by;
threats, made by the more desperate'
of the men who had actually been I
engaged in the shooting, as to what
would happen to any man who fatted
to protect the wrongdoers. More
over, there are circumstances tending j
to show that these misguided men
were encouraged by outsiaers to per-j
sis* In their course of concealment'
and denial .1 feel, therefore, thai
the guilt of the men who. after the
event, thus shielded the perpetrators
of the wrong by refusing t tell the
truth about them, though serious, was
in part due to the unwise and impro?
per attitude of others, and that some1
measure of allowance should be mail.-!
for the misconduct. In other words,'
I believe we can afford to reinstate
any of these men mh<> truthfully tell
what has happened, give all the aid,
they can to tlx the responsibility ui>on
those who are really guilty, and
show that they themselves had no
guilty knowltdce beforehand and
wete in no way implicated in the af?
fair, rave by having knowledge of I'
afterwards and failing and' refusing
to divulge It I'ndt-r ^he circum?
stances, and in view of the length or
time they have been out of the ser-'
vice, and their loss of the hcnt-fl> ?1
would have arcured to them by con?

ford to treat the men who meet the(
requirements given shove a.- having

TREAT ENRIGHT AFFAIR
STILL WARM SUBJECT
Reported from Washington Tru<. Mar?

sons for Removing Deputy.
RICHMOND. VA., Iiec. 14.?-Reply?
ing to interviews published from the
Knrlght sympathizers, following the
removal of Major M. J Knrlght from
office by United State. Marshall Mor?
gan Tr? 3t faction are in anus today,
and have trained their guns on Edgar
Allen. Jr., assistant Richmond isist
master, and a supposed sympathize!
with Enright. It has inen alleged
that Marshal Treat was a champion ;
of the negro in the Republican party,
and that Postmaster It E. Cabell, A.s-j
slslant Postmaster Edgar Allan, Jr., j
and John I!. Luce, associated with
Major M. J. Enright, represented the
lily white following of ihe (J. O. P. in
Virginia. Marshal Tn at'd friends re
pud t?te this allegation
'Morgan Treat was the original lily
white Republican In Virginia." said
one of his support*r.<- this morniug.
"As far back as 18H8 In (I'd battle to/j
tip. reformation and purification of j
Republicanism in this .section of tbe.
Mate. so far as the Ida: k and tan In-I
gredienl was concern, d. This was j
shown at Hanover Court house whtn.j

as former PoJtmasti r Wra> T.
Knight Hoheit S. Rylatid and ('. P. j
Snead. both of K'ng William county ;
John L. Grubs and William Haw, Loth I
of Hanover, and T. L. Moss, also of
Hanover opposed the negro faction
(known as the Alien faction) then In]
power.
"The Allan faction was headed at i
this meeting by Kdgur Allan, better
known a.s "Yankee" Allan, a man
named James Bayne. William Custa
lo. who kept a saloon at the eorm r of [
Seventh ami Broad streets, and the)
negro (now dead) known as Captain1
Hen Scott.
Secret of Allan's Power.
' There was nev? r a more anamo
lous situation than exists in what is
now known a.-i the Cabell-Allan-Luce
lily whi'e faction. The name of Ed?
gar Allan. Jr., is a large fly in a
rmall pot of ointment. This is the
faction which rectos to be champion?
ing th. Knrlght fight
"The secret of Edgar Allan'j pre?
sumed power lies in the fact that he
(Allan) and Krank Hitchcock were
schoolmates. To this fact he is said
to owe his appoint mint to his present
position. It id sail that Hitchcock
mentioned the tiatm of Allan to his
(Hitchcock's) friend. George B. Cor
tel>ou, and 'hat the appointment fol?
lowed as a sequence
"It made no difference that Allan
may have been "p. rsona r.on prata' j
to the lily whites; his appointment
was not made on color lines."
Asked for Reasons.
WASHINGTON. 1). C. De?. 14 ?
No report lias been received at the
department of justice relative to the
reasons Marshal Morgan Treat had
for r(moving Major ICnright from the
place of deputy marshal. It was stat?

considerable complain; growing out of
the removal of Mi.jor Enrich: had
been selected by V'ar.= hal Treat to
