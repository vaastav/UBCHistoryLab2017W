AN IMPORTANT STEP.
To tho Settlors Upon tho Osage
Trust Lands. '
In view ot the facts, that under thc
cxistin" law the settlers upon the";
0ae Fndlan Trust lands arc compcll-!
od lo pay for their claims within one I
vearfroin date of settlement: that a
lar'-'O majoritvof said settlers are poor
men endeavoring to secure homes for
themselves and families; that being
out upon the borders where the ordi
nary avenues forrcmunerativc labor do
notexist, and where but an inadequate
market can bo maintained for MiCh
commodities as they may produce from
their lands; that owing to the scarcity
of money in the west the time for pay
ment has already laped in a great
number of instances: that money can
only be borrowed at Mich :i ruinous
and extorting r.itc of interest as in
nearly every instance ) wallows up the
land, labor, home and improvemcutx
of the settler : And in view of the fur
ther facts, that the moneys for these
lands as fat as paid in arc by the gen
eral government converted into bonds
bearing a low rale of interest for the
benefit of the Indians; that all the gen
eral government does or should dc
uuiiTd. i the sale of the lands and the
security of their price together with
Mich iiitcret, in accordance with the
terms of the treaty ; that all the state
and counties in which thec laud arc
situated desire i that the lands may
peedily be subject to taxation ; that
precedents already exist in which the
general government has given a long
series of years in which to pay for In
dian lands, therefore, we the settlers
upon the above lands present
a nrriTiox
To the honorable, the house of repre
sentatives and senate, in congress as
hcmbled. We the undersigned your
petitioners respectfully represent that
they are buuu Jldc settlers upon the
Oxage Indian Trit-t lands and arc de
sirous, for the reasons above enumera
ted, of having the law relating to the
settlement and sale of said laudi so
amended as to provide that settlers
may prove upaiid gain immediate title,
as under the present law, Jjy paying
the first year's interest at the time of
proving up, the government to bo se
cured by taking a mortgage bond,
running ten years, with coupons attach
ed, bearing the same rate of interest
that is paitl the Indians, with the pro
viso that annually each claimant or
settler shall appear at a general land
otllce by himself orattorucy with com
petent proof that he is actually living
upon and cultivating his land, when he
shall redeem at least one coupon with
tho privilege of redeeming all, and that
whatever extra annual expense may be
incurred by the government in carry
ing out the provisions of such act shall
be paid in fees by the settler annually
at the time of redeeming such coupons,
leaving the land, by virtue of title thus
gained subject to state, county and
municipal taxation. And your peti
tioner will ever pray.
The above statement of facts togeth
er with the mailer of the petition were
drawn up by us in puisuaurc of many
anil earnest solicita'ions iipnuthcpa'rt
of M'ttlers living in this and adjoining
counties. Whatever is done should be
done ijuickly. As the muM Directive
and speedy manner of getting petitions
circulated among the settlers and sign
ed and returned. We ask all the pa
pers published hi the counties included
upon these lauds to publish the above
and request the settlers to embody its
substance in the form of a petition, cir
culate and sign and return the same to
their representative' or to M. ii. Mur
doch, slate senator, Wichita. It is de
sirable that this chould all be done by
the 1.1th day of January. As soon as
the legislature meets, we will, in con
nt'cliou with the representatives from
this ilibtrict, ask tho state's endorse
ment, by concurrent resolution, when.
thi" whole matter can be sent in nu olli
cial form to congress.
If the settlers upon any portion of
tlies. lands know of a better, more-efficient
or satisfactory plan for an exten
sion oftime.ur of one less objectionable,
let them embody it in their peti
tions. The plan here set forth, we
think, secures the government, secures
ilie Indians and will at an outlay of
t'lewii or twelvedollars a year give the
settler ten years time in which to save
homestead.
The truth is, too large a proportion of
these valuable lauds arc falling into
the hands of non-resident laud buyers,
not onl to the detriment of the set
tlers, but to the detriment of thecoun
trv. In the hands of the settlers they
mi' improved and become valuable, eu
hansing the taluc of all lauds and pro
perty around them, while in the hands
of .peculHlors they lay idle upon the
A
maike', unimproved and almost worth'
less for tho purposes of taxation

Tho President's Message,
Fpon the outside of this paper will
hr found President Grant's message in
full. It is noticeably flic longest ever
submitted by him. Owing to our re
cent complications with spain, terrible
financial crash, and the new elements
at work in our national body politic,
this Mate paper has been looked for
ward to with more than an ordinary
degree of interest. thesequcstionsaic
handled in a straightforward manner
that will no doubt meet the hearty ap
proval of the people throughout the
country. The efforts being made by
Spain to establish a republican form of
government are warmly commended
by our chief executive, and tho action
of the slaveholders in Cuba severely
criticised. As to the Virginlus butch
ery he characterizes her seizure as a
violation of the sovereignty of tho
United States and the shooting of her
passengers inhuman, which is followed
by the demand made by our govern
ment for reparation and apology. As
to the Into panic, he favors a flexible
ourrency, but recognizes the import
ance of a resumption of specie pay
ments, but Is opposed to any contrac
tion that would prove violent or dis
astrous. The great question of trans
portation he treats at some length,
offering suggestions to congress. The
bankrupt law he has no patience with
uid ask Its repeal. In a cute way he
goes for the salary grabbers, by asking
for ah amendment, which shall cm
ewcr the president to veto objection
'able portion ofa bill without destroy
ing the whole act, intimating, we sup
pose, that had he had such power he
would hare vetoed the salary grab sec

Auciitor Wilder's Report-
Daniel W. Wilder, state auditor of
Kansas, has favofed some of the papers
with advanced sheets of his annual re
port to the legislature. From that re
nnrt it is nlain to bo seen that lie has
been going down to the bottom of mat- j
lers hi liis office, overhauling the trans
actions of his predecessor and tho state
treasurer, and it is just as plain that
he has found frauds and steals. In
truth, he gives dates, amounts and
names. For one, we were not in the
least surprised. We have been in favor
of putting on trial for impeachment
the Inst three treasurers of this state:
(They have been acting in open viola-
Hon of law, and every committee ap
pointed by the legislature for investi
gation have so found and so reported ;
yet no action was ever taken, other
than whitewashing matters for the
sake of the good name and reputed
honest v of these officials. lo not uii-
.tr.nt n.t.1 lie 4.1 CHI 1 1 1 f lltrfwf fc.tffllK
and robberies were discovered, but
speculations by the treasurers in the
funds of the stale through home and
foreign batiks, by way of deposits, ex
changes, use of money, etc. Auditor
Wilder shows up the whole matter in
his report, together with some other
things. There appears to have been a
a systcmized swindle in the paying out
of the Price raid funds. The 'general
government allowed the state $337,
051.38. Auditor Thomau drew out
of this fund .'il.OOO.OO without power
of attorney or authority. This amount
belonged to many persons who were
entitled to from 10 to 100. The
names of the persons so defrauded arc
given by the auditor. Among them
we recognize the name of a man who be
longed to a regiment of which we had
command. The amount is Cl.95, for
which we applied no less than three or
four times, in person and by letter.
The state treasurers have been in
the habit of stamping upon the back
of warrants "not paitl for the want of
funds," thereby entailing the interest
upon the state. The auditor shows
that such stamping was a lie and a
fraud in about seven out of ten times,
right along. The treasurer in the face
of law and the warnings and threat
nings of impeachments, has been keep
ing large sums of money in the Xew
York and Topeka banks, also ii: Kan
sas City and other hanks in the state.
Governor Osboru and Auditor Wilder
both addressed letters to him during
the summer, warning him against this
violation of the law, but all to no pur
pose. The panic came and the conse
quence is easily imagined. At one
time he was keeping !Slll,878.C7inNcw
York.
The laws of the state declare these
actions high crimes and misdemeanors,
yet all the treasurers of this slate that
we have any knowledge of have been
guilty of tliis practice. From what
we know of the temper of the house
this winter, we would not be surprised
if warm work resulted from this re
port of Auditor Wilder's.

and reliable correspondent of the Kan

ants, can, sitting in his ofllce, forty
miles away, give a better report of the
doings of a legislature or a convention,

Still Mora About Corn.
Editok Kaoli:: 1 noticed in your
issue of the 27th hist, an article enti
tled "more about corn," in which the
author, entitling himself "Farmer K.,"
works himself into the highest pitch of
indignation, because certain farmers
have agreed not to sell their coui lor
less than fifty cents per bushel, until
tho first of January.
He says, "I am al no glad that 1 did
not send a copy of your number to Illi
nois a 1 think i.othing would have n
stronger tendency to stop emigration
from this quarter ihuti !o toll them
that it costs 30 cents per bushel
to raise corn in Sedgwick county."
"They would naturally conclude,"
the continues, "that our land was no
account." And he also says: "If it is
so, it is a startling and important truth
that must have been unfolded inside
the locked doors of a grange meeting,
and these incantation individuals have
let it out." "Xow, there arc some of
us that think that corn can be raised
for one half that money."
Perhaps there arc some of yon that
think so, FarmerfK., but you are ex
tremely isolated like the islands in the
Little Arkansas river. And there arc
a great many others besides those
tweuty-nino that have agreed not to
sell their corn for less than fifty cents
per bushel, that believe and know that
it cannot be raised for fifteen cents.
1, for one, will aknowledgo that it
might be raised for fifteen cents, that
is, "it might be," but not under the
existing circumstances. In the present
condition of things it is impossible for
a farmer to raise corn at fifteen cents
per bushel, or twenty-five cents, and
keep soul and body together.
He also says: "One man with good
team, plows and cultivator, average
season and average luck, and no other
business to take any part of his time,
can raise 40 acres, or 2,000 bushels.
This would require three months, and
more, and, fifteen cents per bushel,
would be $100 per month lor man and
team."
Such a statement as the abovo is the
hight of absurdity, and, coming from
one who pretends to be a farmer, is
the more inexcusable.
Xo farmer uuder tho heavens can
make a living by raising corn exclusive
ly, and purchasing everything else.
Look at the price of bacon, fourteen
cents per pound, flour from four to six
dollars a hundred, and all other neces
sary articles in like proportion.
Take a glance at the price of fuel
coal from niuc to twelve dollars per
ton, and wood from four to eight dol
lars per cord.
Then retain again to the experienced
farmer, who has a family of from four
to six children to support, or perhaps
more, and tellliim to raise forty acres
of corn, to sell it for fifteen cents perl
bushel, and buv all the necessities
ri
life, ami free what he will loll yon.
Let us now make an estimate of what )
it will cost :i family to live, buying
everything. horc feni'l excepted, which
we will deduct from the corn. Horse
feed for two iornrs for one year, three
feeds a day and twelve ears at a fcrd,ur ieui? what it costs him and his
for each horse, we will allow one! neighbors to huk and deliver thcir's
hundred car to the bushel wc lind t
that it take two hundred andninetecii
bushels to feed two horses Tor one
year. Deduct two hundred and nine
teen from 2,000 bushels, this leaves
1,781 bushels, at fifteen cents per bush
el, equal to $267.15 net.
Xow, say six m a lamily, man, wife,
and four children, allow $150 per year
for clothing; Hour, one sack per month
at$f.50pcr sack, $51; bacon, $30; su
gar, S20; codec, $20; tea, $5; salt, $6;
potatoes, $20; coal oil, soap, yeast, &c,
$15: tax, $5; wo will not allow any
thing for medicines, or incidental ex
penses, which families may always
with certainty count upon having to
pay.
I have made these estimates very
low, as every farmer having a family
of that size to support will tell you.
Xow let us count up and sec how we
stand. Wc have the proceeds of the
crop, which is $"2C7.I5, absolutely ne
cessary expenses, $32.5.00.
lly calculating wc find that wc are
$57.85 in debt. .
Hut in bringing these facts before
the public, I don't do it to dishearten
any one, or to discourage them from
coming here, I only intend to show the
folly of trying to raise corn and make
a living by selling it at fifteen cents a
bushel.
Xow, 1 claim that wc have as good
soil here, and as easily cultivated as
any soil that the sun ever shone upon,
every foot of which is susceptible of
cultivation, ami every acre capable of
producing heavy crops of cereals of all
kinds.
Hut wc don't wish to waste our time
raising corn to sell, wc must turn it in
to pork, raise our own poultry, keep a
few sheep, raise wheat enough for our
own bread, and turn everything to ac
count that will check the outlay of mo
ney. In this way, by strict economy and
frugality, with the assistance of brain
enough to enable us to look ahead, and
to correct all past errors, we, the farm
ers of Sedgwick county, find the road
to prosperity.
Again I would say to our inauspi
cious neighbor "Farmer K." that it
is not by any magical charm, or by any
incantation, that this terrible secret
has been brought to light, but simply
through the application of two simple
rules of arithmetic, addition and sub
traction in the every day experience of
practical farmers.
As far as being afraid to send that
copy of the K.vtii.K ta Illinois for fear
of checking immigration, I will say
that you might as well throw your hat
against a northwestern tornado to try
to change Its course, and in my estim
ation that very copy would have been
conclusive to that immigration.
Again our much oflended Farmer K.
says: "Were it not for our much abus
ed Wichita, we would be selling our
corn for ten tents a bushel."
In answer to this statement I will
quote a passage of tho article written
by "Farmer of Lone Tree," which has
been the cause of producing "more
about corn."
"Farmers do not complain of prices
of dealers in Wichita, but they protest
against selling the produce at one half
its real value."
And I do not blame them, I think
they are right, but T would advise
them not to raise too much corn, let
them devote more of their time to
something that will pay them better,
and something that will sell more
readily. There arc several kinds of
produce that will yield three times the
quantity, to the same amount of
ground, will need no more work com
paratively, and generally sell at much
higher figures than corn.
If wc will raise corn let us feed it to
stock, this is the only way that we can
get anything like a fair compensation
for our labor.
As Tar as the contention between the
farmers and Wichita is concerned, wc
need not trouble ourselves about it.
Every farmer in Sedgwick county has
an interest in Wichita, and that inter
est is for her benefit. If there is any
contention between them it is only an
endeavor on tho part of the fanner to
throw oil' tho mountain of oppression
caused bv middle men, and to getdcaH
of those who, like leeches, arc drawing
the life-blood out of their bodies and
cheating them out of the proceeds of
their honest labor. Let a farmer take
a load of corn to Wichita of twenty-five
bushels, say he has to cross the bridge,
he will have to pay seventy-five cents
toll and twenty-live cents for weighing.
Selling his load at fifteen cents per
bushel, deducting toll and weighing,
ho will have a balance left of $2.75 for
his load. Xow, if ho should haul off
the whole 2,000 bushels, twenty-five
bushels at a load, toll and weighing
will make a difference of $80 hi the pro
ceeds of his crop; add to this the fami
ly expenses, and we find that they are
$137.85 in debt instead of $57.85. "
If Farmer K. would try tho experi
ment of com culture on his own plan
for one year, keeping a correct account
in the mean time, at the end of the
year, while oxamining his accounts, he
will find that the business was not
very profitable one, he will also find
that startling and Important truth cap
able of being unfolded outside of the
grange, and without the assistance of
incantation individual. C. F..T.

Mukdock lino's : Tho fire in this
city last night burned out Park & Hoy's
bakery and restaurant, also Win. Park's
furniture store, two story building and
stock, total loss to them. Fire origin
ated in the balcony or rear room of the
building. Henry Mayer, barber, was
the next sufferer; barely got out wife
and children with 3 trunks and a bu
reau; building, one story, his own and
total loss. Xcxt the old Gold Rooms
building, owned and occupied by a
now comer with a fancy notion and
millinery store; building only lost.
Xcxt legal tender, lost by the Ilonie
dramatic association, total loss. Zohm
ton & Green's law office, S. Marsh's
Mint Saloon, and J. B. Dickey, drug
gist, came next in rotation ; stocks all
saved and buildings owned by parties
elsewhere, total loss. George Clapp's
one story boots & shoe store was torn
dowu to arrest the flames and did so.
All will open out again in other locali

king of bird?.
How cleverly-he has replied to; f. r
statementof what it costs to raise corji
io Wichita. He might have added the
cost of shelling, bagging and shipping
to Liverpool of retailing and consum
ing after it gets there; for-this would
have been equally applicable lo the
point of difference between "Farmer
of Loue Tree" and myself. But It
seems the baby question crowded the
subject out of his mind. Xow I was
very careful not to correct one errone
ous statement by making another. I
know a man up the Little river to
whoso movements I have paid some
attention and who lias raised it patch
of corn the past season. It is now
nearly all cribbed and there will be
over eighteen hundred bushels of the
corn he raised. Had this been sold for
fifteen cents per bushel on the stock
he would have received fully $100 per
month for every month of faithful la
bor that was bestowed upon the patch.
Of course, cost of board, keeping up
team ami implements has to come out
of the money received for crop. There
arc scores of renters back in Illinois
who would be glad to raise corn for
fifteen cents per bushel, sold on the
stalk, and the land furnished them. In
fact, many arc raising it for ten and
twelve cents, and then arc doing bet
ter than they would paying from four
to six dollars per acre rent, and deliv
ering their corn to town" at from twen
ty to twenty-live cents, the best prices
their towns are paying them at this
time. I believe wc can raise corn in
this valley just as cheap as they can in
Illinois. Ifwc cannot, when our lauds
cost us only about one-tenth of what
thcir's aro valued at, why, then, this
country has little to recommend it to
the corn-grower.
My recipe is wanted. It is this: co
operation. "What ?" says my friend.
"Why that is what wc arc all working
for." Yes, co-operation, but not that
kind of co-operation which says "wc,
the farmers of Sedgwick county, will
unite and make the people of Wichita
pay us fifty cents for our corn," when
no other market this side of Indiana
will warrant more than half that, un
less it is shelled and in bags. This
kind of co-operation. as Mr. Kelly inti
mates in his article last week, would
have n tendency to drive away con
sumers and will) them our market.
Not that kind of co-operation which
calls the farmer from the plow and
harvest field to form combinations
against the interest of trade and com
merce of mechanics and merchants.
In the language of Thacher, wc be
lieve "farmers should take a firm stand
against all combinations." Xot that
co-operation which says, "farmers, you
arc exercising too much muscle in ag
riculture; you must quit it and have
your brains do flic work." Xone of
this, but a heart v co-operation of brain
and muscle will acccomplish the work.
If our Cowskin friend don't believe it
let him give it a lair trial next spring,
and keep an account of the time ho be
stows on the crop. If he spends a day
in town, showing his certificate and
"making terms" with the merchants,
let him enter it honestly "a day lost,"
and thou lot him tell us honestly how
ho comes out.
Wc aro glad to hear from "Farmer
Doolittlc" again. There seems to bo
some reason and common sense in the
general make-up of this man and less
of selfishness than is - manifested by
many of our farmers. Why, sonic of
them scratched the name of W. IS.
Smith from the republican ticket for
no other reason than that he lived in
Wichita. They can't take the Kagi.k
because Murdock belongs to tho town
clique; they cannot patronize the ag
ricultural fair for a similar reason,
and thus it goes. Yet these men seem
to think the county rests directly up
on their shoulders.
I, with "Doolittlc," think the coun
ty ought to buy the bridges. The
present stock holders must feel a suffi
cient interest in the county to sell at a
reasonable price. The river, coursing
through the middle of our county,
gives us more vallev land than any of
our neighbor counties can boast of,
and this adds to outvalue as a county.
We should be very incomplete without
the west side, and the west side would

Editor Eagle: Asthcbridgcqucs
tion is again brought before you by
Farmer Doolittle, who treats the sub
ject very generously and aks if we
farmers of the west side want free
bridges. Wc most assuredly Uo. We
claim to be citizens and tax payers and
arc compelled to go to tho city of
Wichita to pay our taxes and to do all
county business ; and as wc have more
than one-half of the land of the county
on our side of the river, wc think it
no more than just aud right that wc
should have a free bridge over the Big
Arkansas river. At least change this
around and have the county scat on
this side. How would you relish the
higli rates of toll that wc have been
subjected to within the past eighteen
mouths. That, If nothing else, would
make you err free bridges. Wc hare
no doubt that when the bridge prop -
