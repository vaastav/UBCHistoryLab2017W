SCOTLAND. 80UTH DAKOTA
Boston is sent digging up Paul Revere
relics. Workmen employed In restor
ing the old Revere house at the North
End uncovered In the back yard the
old Paul Revere well. It shows a
diameter of four feet and six Inches,
while its depth is not yet determined,
as, of course, it had been filled up
completely. It proves to be entirely
planked in vertically, like an ordinary
•water tank, with old oak-hewn plank.
In connection with the work that has
been going on there have been also
some other discoveries. Two pieces of
old Lowestoft china have been found,
one a part of a cup and the other a
part of a saucer. In some excavating
in the cellar there was found an old
half-dollar, also a big capper cent of
1844.
West Virginia Is to make an experi
ment in a Jim Crow city. This city
has been laid out near Charleston, the
capital of the state, and it Is expend
that within a year It will contain a
population of several thousand. No
white person will be permitted to re
side within its limits or to own prop
erty therein. In the midst of this little
Africa is situated the state colored
high school. Educational facilities will
be ample and there will be electrio
lights, sewers and parks. The city will
bo governed, of course, by the negro
Inhabitants, and the whole state will
watch with interest the progress of
the experiment as testing the capacity
of the negro for self government.
The administration of the Prussian
railroads has recently experimented
with wireless telegraphic signals on the
line between Berlin and Beelltz, em
ploying a train of four cars carrying
antennae and receiving apparatus, the
transmitting apparatus being installed
between Berlin and Sangerhausen. The
transmitting wire was suspended upon
telegraph poles for a distance of 200
feet, about a foot beneath the ordinary
telegraph wires. Within a distance of
about seven and a half miles on each
fclde of the transmitting station, the
signals were clearly and distinctly re
ceived on the moving train.
All the principal railway companies
of Great Britain issue railway tickets
made entirely of gold, which entitle the
holder to travel free by any class of
car and train, on any line and by any
system In the British Isles. They are
the size of a 60-cent piece, but oval
In shape, and engraved with the rail
way company's coat of arms, with the
holder's name beneath, and are intend
ed to be'worn on watch chains. These
tickets can not be bought, but are pre
sented by the directors to persons who
have earned the railway companies'
gratitude.
The heaviest stag which has been
killed this season in Scotland was a
royal, which scaled 371 pounds. This
immense beast was shot in Arran deer
forest by one of Lord and Lady Gra
ham's guests at Brodick castle. The
stags in Arran are remarkable both for
size and quality, and the forest carries
a heavy stock of red deer, and affords
first-rate sport. The shooting lodge on
the west side of the island, where the
beet stalking is obtained during the
first month of the season, is covered'
outside with over 200 pairs of deer
horns.
Tho Empress Eugenie treasures a
pen made from the quill of a golden
eagle's wing and richly mounted with
diamonds and gold, which was used at
her request by the fourteen plenipo
tentiaries who signed the Treaty of
Paris in 1856. When the Hon. Mr.
Ward, eldest son of Lord Bangor, was
married some time ago the register
was signed with a quill pen which was
used by the high contracting powers
In signing the Treaty of Vienna, and
which has several times been utilized
•t weddings in the Ward family.
.Jhe Pennsylvania state nurseries, in
1906, cent out no fewer than 160,000
white pine seedlings, besides 400 pounds
of seed, to be planted last spring. This
Is in addition to the extensive forestry
work under way at the cost of the
Pennsylvania railroad at Altoona, and
of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation
company in Schuylkill and Carbon
counties, and the work upon the state's
own reservations. This is a good begin
ning for one of the ten states which
now have reservations.
Thackeray's favorite poets were Gold

Prior, whom he thought the easiest, the
richest, the most charmingly humorous
0t English lyrical poets, and Gav, the
force of whose melody and artless ring

red Pope, too but while admitting
Milton's greatness thought him "such
a bore that no one could read him." It
is not surprising, therefore, that Thack

ROOSEVELT STANDS
FOR REGULATION OF"
BIG CORPORATIONS
In Message Delivered Tuesday
He Urges a National In
corporation Act.
MONEY REFORM IS NEEDED
He Leaves It to Congress to Select
Plan, but Inclines Toward Guar
anty Fund for Protection—
Many Points Covered.
Washington. D. C., Dec. 3.—Pres
ident Roosevelt Unlay sent his annual
message to the sixtieth congress, and
It was read in both branches of the
assembly. In part the message is as
follows:
The Senate and House of Represent
atives: No nation has greater re
sources than ours, and I think It can
be truthfully said that the citizens of
no nation possess greater energy and
industrial ability. In no nation are the
fundamental business conditionssouiul
er than in ours at this very moment
and it is foolish, when such is the case,
for people to hoard money instead of
keeping it in sound banks for it is
such hoarding that is the immediate
occasion of money stringency. More
over, as a rule, the business of our peo
ple is conducted with honesty and pro
bity, and this applies alike to farms
and factories, to railroads and banks,
to all our legitimate commercial enter
prises.
In any largo body of men, however,
there are certain to be some who are
dishonest, and if the conditions are
such that these men prosper or com
mit their misdeeds with impunity, their
example is a very evil thing for the
community. Where these men are
buslntss men of great sagacity and of
temperament both unscrupulous and
reckless, and where the conditions are
such that they act without supervision
or control and at first without effective
check from public opinion, they delude
many innocent people into making in
vestments or embarking in kinds of
business that are really unsound. When
the misdeeds of these successfully dis
honest men are discovered, suffering
comes not only upon them, but upon the
innocent men whom they have misled. It
is a painful awakening, whenever it oc
curs and, naturally, when it does oc
cur those who suffer are apt to forget
that the longer it was deferred the more
painful It would be. In the effort to
punish the guilty it is both wise and
proper to endeavor so far as possible to
minimize the distress of those who
have been misled by the guilty. Yet it
is not possible to refrain because of
such distress from striving to put an
end to the misdeeds that arc the ulti
mate causes of the sufferings, and, as
a means to this end, where possible to
punish those responsible for them.
There may be honest differences of
opinion as to many governmental poli
cies but surely there can be no such
differences as to the need of unflinch
ing perseverence in the war against
successful dishonesty.
(Here the president quotes from his
1905 message his declaration for the
square deal between corporations and
people and for the regulations of inter
state. commerce to this end.)
I have called your attention in these
quotations to what I have already said
because I am satisfied that it is the
duty of the national government to em
body in action the principles thus ex
pressed.
Interstate Commerce.
No small part of the trouble that we
have comes from carrying to an ex
treme the national virtue Of self-re
liance, of independence In initiative and
action. It is wise to conserve this vir
tue and to provide for its fullest exer
cise, compatible with seeing that lib
erty does not become a liberty to
wrong others. Unfortunately, this is
the kind of liberty that the lack of all
effective regulation inevitably breeds.
The founders of the constitution pro
vided that the national government
should have complete and sole control
of interstate commerce. There was
then practically no Interstate business
save such as was conducted by water,
and this the national government at
once proceeded to regulate in thor
oughgoing and effective fashion. Con
ditions have now so wholly changed
that the interstate commerce by water
is insignificant compared with the
amount that goes by land, and almost
all big business concerns are now en
gaged in interstate commerce. As a
result, it can be but partially and im
perfectly controlled or regulated by the
action of any one of the several states
such action inevitably tending to be
either too drastic or else too lax, and in
either case ineffective for purposes of
justice. Only the national government
can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise
the needed control. This does not
mean that there should be any exten
sion of federal authority, for
such authority already exists un
der the constitution in amp
lest and most far-reaching form
but it does mean that there should be
an extension of federal activity. This
is not advocating ceniralizatiop. It is
merely looking lacts in the face, and
realizing that centralization in busi
ness has already come and cannot be
uvoided or undone, and that the pub
lic at large can only protect itself irom
certain evil effects of this business
centralization by providing better
methods for the exercise of control
through the authority already central
ized in the national government by the
constitution Itself.
There must be no halt in the
healthy constructive course of ac
tion which this nation has elected.
to pursue, and has steadily pur
sued, during the last six years, as
shown both in the legislation of
the congress and the administra
tlon of the law by the department
6f justice. The most vital need is
in connection with the railroads.
As to these, In my judgment there
should now be either a national In
corporation act or a law licensing
railway companies to engage In In
teratate commerce upon certain con
dijaons. THE LAW SHOULD BE
SO FRAMED AS TO GIVE TO
THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION* POWER TO PASS':

I Sherman Anti-Trust Law.
Moreover, In my judgment there
should be additional legislation look
ing to the proper control of the great
business concerns engaged in inter
state business, this control to be ex
ercised for their own benefit and pros
perity rio less than for the protection
of investors and of the general public.
As I have repeatedly said in messages
to the congress and elsewhere, experi
ence has definitely shown not merely
the unwisdom but the futility of en
deavoring to put a stop to all busi
ness combinations. Modern industrial
conditions are such that combination
is not only necessary but inevitable. It
is so in the world of business just as
it is in the world of labor, and it is
idle to desire to put an end to all
corporations, to all big combinations
of capital, as to desire to put an end to
the combinations of labor. Corporation
and labor union alike have come to
stay. Each, if properly managed is a
source of good and not evil. Whenever
in either there is evil, it should be
promptly held to account but it should
receive hearty encouragement so long
as it is properly managed. It is pro
foundly immoral to put or keep on the
statute books a law, nominally in the
interest of public morality, that really
puts a premium upon public immoral
ity, by undertaking to forbid honest
men from doing what must be done un
der modern business conditions, so that
the law itself provides that its own in
fraction must be the condition prece
dent upon business success. To aim at
the accomplishment of too much usual
ly means the accomplishment of too
little, and often the doing of positive
damage.
Forbid the Evil Combination.
(Hero the president cited previous ex
pressions to the effect that the Sher
man anti-trust act is so framed that
the business of the country cannot be
conduct without breaking it.)
The antil-trust law should not
be repealed but it should be made
both more efficient and more in
harmony with actual conditions.
It should be emended so as to
forbid only the kind of combin
ation which docs harm to the gen
eral public, such amendment to
be accompanied by, or to be an
incident ot, a grant of supervisory
power to the government over
these big concerns engaged in in
terstate business. This should be
accompanied by provision for the
compulsory publication of accounts
and the subjection of books and
papers to the inspection of the
government officials. A beginning
has already been made for such
supervision by the establishment
of the bureau of corporations.
The anti-trust lav.- should not pro
hibit combinations that do no injustice
to the public, still less those the ex
istence of which is on the whole of
benefit ,o the public. But even if this
feature of the law were abolished,
there would remain as an equally ob
jectionable feature the difficulty and
cieiay now incident to its enforcement.
The government must now submit to
irksome and repeated delay before ob
taining a final decision of the courts
upon proceedings instituted, and even
a favorable decree may mean an empty
victory. Moreover, to attempt to con
trol these corporations by law suits
means to impose upon both the depart
ment of justice and the courts an im
possible burden it is not feasible to
carry on more than a limited number
of such suits. Such a law to be really
effective must of course be admin
istered by an executive body, and not
merely by means of law suits. The de
sign should be to prevent the abuses
incident to the creation of unhealthy
and improper combinations, instead of
waiting until they are in existence and
then attempting to destroy them by
civil or criminal proceedings.
Condemns Trusts in Necessities,
A combination should not be tol
erated If it abuse the power ac
quired by combination to the pub
lie detriment. No corporation or
association of any kind should be
permitted to engage in foreign or
interstate commerce that is formed
for the purpose of, or whose op
erations create, a monopoly or gen
eral control of the production, sale,
or distribution of any one or more
of the prime necessities of life or
articles of general use and neces
sity. Such combinations are
against public policy they violate
the commcn law: the doors of the
courts are closed to those who are
parties to them, and I believe the
congress can close the channels of
interstate commerce against them
for its protection. The law should
make its prohibitions and permis
-sions as clear and definite as pos
sible, leaving the least possible
room for arbitrary action, or al
legation of such action, on the part
of the executive or of divergent
interpretations by the courts.
Among the points to be aimed at
should be the prohibition of un
healthy competition such as by
rendering service at an actual loss
for the purpose of crushing out
competition, the prevention of in
tlation of capital, and the prohi
bition of a corporation's making
exclusive trade with itself a con
dition of having any trade with
itself." Reasonable agreements be
tween, or combinations of corpora
tions should be permitted, provided
they are first submitted to and ap
proved by some appropriate gov
einment body.
THE CONGRESS HAS THE POW
ER TO CHARTER CORPORATIONS
TO ENGAGE IN INTERSTATE AND
FOREIGN COMMERCE, AND A GEN
ERAL LAW CAN BE ENACTED UN
DER THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH
EXISTING CORPORATIONS COULD
TAKE OUT FEDERAL CHARTERS
AND NEW FEDERAL CORPORA
TIONS COULD BE CREATED
License as an Alternative
An essential provision of such a law
should be a method of predetermining
by some federal board or commission
whether the applicant for a federal
charter was an association or combi
nation within the restrictions of the
federal law. Provision should also be
made for complete publicity in all mat
ters affecting the public and complete
protection to the investing public and
the shareholders in the matter of issu
ing corporate securities. If an incor
poration law is not deemed advisable,
a license act for' big interstate corpor-'
ations might be enacted or a combi
nation of the two might be tried. The
supervision established might be an
alogous to that now exercised over na
tional banks. At least, the anti-trust
act should oe supplemented by specific
prohibitions of the methods which ex
perience has shown have been of most
service in enabling monopolistic com
binations to crush out competition. TJie
real owners of a corporation should be
compelled to do business In their own
name. The right to hold stock In other
corporations should hereafter be de
nied to Interstate, corporations unless
on approval by the proper government
officials," and a prerequisite to such ap
proval should be the listing with the
government of all owners and stock
holders, both by the corporation own
ing such stock and by the corporation
in which such stock Is owned.
To confer upon the national gov
ernment, In connection with the amend
ment I advocate in the anti-trust law,
power of supervision over big business
concerns engaged in interstate com
merce, would benefit them as it has
benefited the national banks. In the
recent business crisis it is noteworthy
that the institutions which failed were
institutions which were not under the
supervision and control of the national
government. Those which wore under
national control stood the test.
Would Help the Railroads.
National control of the kind above
advocated would be to the benefit of
every well managed railway. From
the standpoint of the public there is
need for additional tracks, additional
terminals, and improvements in the
actual handling of the railroads, and
all this as rapidly as possible. Ample,
safe and speedy transportation facili
ties arc even more necessary than
cheap transportation. Therefore, there
is need for the investment of money
which will provide for all these things
while at the same time securing as far
as is possible better wages and shorter
hours for their employes. Therefore,
while there must be just and reason
able regulation of rates, we should be
the first to protest against any arbi
trary and unthinking movement to cut
them down without the fullest and
most careful consideration of all in
terests concerned and of the actual
needs of the situation. Only a spe
cial body of men acting for the na
tional government under authority con
ferred upon it by the congress is com
petent to pass judgment on such a
matter.
Pure Food Lav/ a Success.
Those who fear, from any rea
son, the extension of federal ac
tlvity will do well to study the
history not only of the national
banking act but of the pure food
law, and notably the meat inspec
tlon law recently enacted. The
pure food law was opposed so vio
lently that its passage was de
layed for a decade yet it has
worker unmixed and immediate
good. The meat inspection law
was even more violently assailed
and the same men who now de
nounce the attitude of the na
tional government in seeking to
oversee and control the workings
of interstate common carriers and
business concerns, then asserted
that we were "discrediting and
ruining a great American Indus
try." Two years have not elapsed,
and already it has become evident
that the great benefit the law con
fers upon the public is accom
plished by an equal benefit to the
reputable packing establishments.
The latter are better off under the
law than they were without it. The
benefit to interstate common car
riers and business concerns from
the legislation I advocate would be
equally marked.
Currency Reform Needed.
In my message to the congress a year
ago I spoke as follows of the currency:
"I especially call your attention to
the condition of our currency laws. The
national banle act has ably served a
great purpose in aiding the enormous
business development of the country,
and within ten years there has been an
increase in circulation per capita from
$21.41 to $33.08. For several years evi
dence has been accumulating that ad
ditional legislation is needed. The re
currence of each crop season empha
sizes the defects of the present laws.
There must soon be a revision of them
because to leave them as they are
means to incur liability of business dis
aster. Since your body adjourned
there has been a fluctuation in the in
terest on call money from 2 per cent,
to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was
even greater during the preceding six
months. The secretary of the treasury
had to step in and by wise action put
a stop to the most violent period of
oscillation. Even worse than such
fluctuation Is the advance in commer
cial rates and the uncertainty felt in
the insufficiency of credit even at high
rates. All commercial interests suffer
during each crop period. Excessive
rates for call money in New York at
tract money from the interior banks
into the speculative field. This depletes
the fund that would otherwise be avail
able for commercial uses, and commer
cial borrowers are forced to pay ab
normal rates, so that each fall a tax,
in the shape of Increased interest
charges, is placed on the whole com
merce of the country.
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system is se
riously defective. There is need of a
change. It must never be forgotten
that this question concerns business
men generally quite as much as bank
ers especially is this true of stock
men, farmers, and business me in the
w*st for at present at certain seasons
of the year the difference in interest
rates between the east and west is
from 6 to 10 per cent,, whereas in Can
ada the corresponding different is but
2 per cent."
I again urge on the congress the need
of immediate attention to this matter.
We need a greater elasticity in our cur
rency: provided, of course, that we
recognize the even greater need of a
safe and secure currency. There must
always be the most rigid examination
by the national authorities.
Should Be Elastic System.
Provision should be made for an
emergency currency. The emer
gency issue should, of course, be
made with effective guaranty, and
upon conditions carefully prescribed
by the government. Such emer
gency issue must be based on ade
quate securities approved by the
government, and must be issued un
der a heavy tax. This would permit
currency being issued when the de
mand for it was urgent, while se
curing its retirement as the demand
fell off. It is worth investigating
to determine whether officers and
directors of national banks should
ever be allowed to loan to them
selves. Trust companies should
be subject to the same supervision
as banks legislation to this effect
should be enacted for the District
of Columbia and the territories.
v..
Yet we must also remember that even
the wisest legislation on the subject
can only accomplish a certain amount.
No legislation can by any possibility
guarantee the business community
against the results of speculative folly
any more than it can guarantee an
individual against the results of his ex
travagance. When an individual mort
gages, his house to buy an automobile
he invites disaster and when wealthy
men, or men who pose as such, or are
unscrupulously or foolishly eager to be
come such, indulge in reckless specula
tion—especially If it is accompr.nied by
dishonesty—they jeopardize not only
their own future, but the '-lture of all
their innocent fellow citizens, for they
expose the whole business community
to panic and distress.
.-f The" Tariff.:
This country Is-definitely com
mltted to the protective system and
and any efTor^ to uproots It could':
not but cause widespread,industrial
disaster. In other words, the prln-
clple of the present tariff law
could not with wisdom be changed.
But in a country of such phenom
enal growth as ours it is probably
well that every dozen years or so
the tariff laws should be carefully
scrutinized so as to see that no ex
-.cesslve or improper benefits are
conferred thereby, that proper rev
enue Is provided, and that our for
eign trade is encouraged. There
must always be as a minimum a
tariff which will not only allow for
the collection of an ample revenue
but which will at least make good
the difference In cost of production
here and abroad that is, the dif
ference in the labor cost here and
abroad, for the well being of the
wage-worker must ever be a card
inal point of American policy. The
qucs.ion should be aproached pure
ly from a business standpoint
both the time and the manner of
the change being such as to arouse
the minimum of agitation and dls
turbance In the business world, and
to give the least play for selfish
and factional motives. The sole
consideration should be to see that
the sum total of changes repre
sents the public good. This means
that the subject can not with wis-:
dom be dealt with in the year pre
ceding a presidential election, be
cause as a matter of fact expert
ence has conclusively shown that
at such a time it is impossible to
get men to treat It from the stand
point of the public good. In my
judgment the wise time to deal
with the matter is immediately af
ter such election.
Income Tax and Inheritance Tax.
When our tax laws are revised the
question of an income tax and an in
heritance tax should receive the careful
attention of our legislators. In my
judgment both of these taxes should be
part of our system of federal taxa
tion. I speak diffidently about the in
come tax because one scheme for an
income tax was declared unconstitu
tional by the supreme court while in
addition it is a difficult tax to adminis
ter in its practical working, and great
care would have to be exercised to see
that it was not evaded by the very men
whom it was most desirable to have
taxed, for if so evaded it would, of
course, be worse than no tax at all
as the least desirable of all taxes Is the
tax which bears heavily upon the hon
est as compared with the dishonest
man. Nevertheless, a graduated in-_
come tax of the proper type would be j»'"J
desirable feature of federal taxation,
and it is to be hoped that one may be
devised which the supreme court will
declare constitutional. The inheritance
tax, however, is both a far better
method cf taxation, and far more im
portant for the purpose of having the
fortunes of the county bear In propor
tion to their Increase in size a corre
sponding increase and burden of tax
ation.
The government has the absolute
right to deoide as to the terms upon
which a man shall receive a be
quest or devise from another, and
this point in the devolution of prop
erty is especially appropriate for
the imposition of a tax. Laws im
posing such taxes have repeatedly
been placed upon the national
statute books and as repeatedly de
clared constitutional by the Courts
and these laws contained the pro
gresslve principle, that Is, after a
certain amount Is reached the be
quest or gift. In life or death, is
increasingly burdened and the rate
of taxation is increased in propor
tion to the remoteness of blood of
the man receiving the bequest.
Behind the European Countries.
The principles are recognized already
in the leading civilized nations of the
world. In Great Britain all the es
tates worth $5,000 or less are practically
exempt from death duties, while the
Increase Is such that when an estate
exceeds $5,000,000 in value and passes
to a distant kinsman or stranger in
blood the government receives all told
an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth
of the whole estate. In France so much
of an Inheritance as exc.eeds $10,000,000
pays over a fifth to the state if it
passes to a distant relative.
The German law is especially interest
ing to us because it makes the in
heritance tax an imperial measure
while allotting to the individual states
of the empire a portion of the proceeds
and permitting them to impose taxes
In addition to those imposed by the im
perial government. Small inheritances
are exempt, but the tax is so sharply
progressive that when the inheritance
is still not very large, provided it is
not an agricultural or a forest land,
it is taxed at the rate of 25 per cent,
if it goes to distant relatives. There is
no reason why In the United States
the national government should not
impose inheritance taxes In addition to
those imposed by the states, and when
we last had an inheritance tax about
one-half of the states levied such taxes
concurrently with the national govern
ment, making a combined maximum
rate, in some cases as high as 25 per
cent. The tax should is possible
be made to bear more heavily upon
those residing without the country
than within it. A heavy progressive
tax upon a very large fortune is in no
way such a tax upon thrift or industry
as a like tax would be on a small for
tune. No advantage comes either to
the country as a whole or to the indi
viduals inheriting the money by per
mitting the transmission in their en
tirety of the enormous fortunes which
would be affected by such a tax and
as an incident to its function of revenue
raising, such a tax would help to pre
serve a measurable equality of oppor
tunity for the people of the generations
growing to manhood.
Enforcement of the Law.
A few years ago there was loud com
plaint that the law could not be in
voked against wealthy offenders. There
is no such complaint now. The course
of the "department of justice during
the last few years has been such as
to make it evident that no man stands
above the law, that no corporation is
so wealthy that it cannot be held to
account. But the laws them
selves need strengthening in more
than one important point, they should
be made more definite, qt that no hon
est man can be led unwittingly to
break them, and so that the real
wrongdoer can be readily punished.
Moreover, there must be the pub
lie opinion back of the laws or the
laws themselves will be of no
avail. At present, while the av
erage juryman undoubtedly wishes
to see trusts broken up, and is
quite ready to fine the corporH
tlon itself, he is very reluctant to
find the facts proven beyond a rea
sonable doubt when it comes to
sending to jail a member of the
business community for indulging
in practices' which are profoundly
unhealthy, but which, unfortunate
ly, the business community has
grown to recognize as well night
normal. Both the present condi
tion of the law .atad the present
temper of.juries render it a task
of extreme difficulty to get at the
real wrongdoer in any such case,
especially by imprisonment. Yet
It is from every standpoint far
preferable to punish the prime of
fender by imprisonment rather
than to f|ne the corporation, with
the attendant damage
holders.

Accidents.
The loss of life and limb from rail
road accidents in this country has be
come appalling. It is a subject ot
which the national government should
take supervision. Ic might be well to
begin by providing for a federal in
spector of interstate railroads some
where along the lines of federal inspec
tion of steamboats, although not going
so far perhaps at first all that it
would be necessary to have would be
some officers whose duty it would be
to investigate all acidents on interstate
railroads and report in detail the
causes thereof.
Employers' Liability.
Congress should adopt legislation pro
viding limited but definite compensa
tion for accidents to all workmen with
in the scope of the federal power, in
cluding employes of navy yards and
arsenals. In other words, a model em
ployers' liability act, far reaching audi
thoroughgoing, should be enacted
which should apply to all positions,
public and private, over which the na
tional government has jurisdiction.
The law should be made such that
the payment for accidents by the em
ployer would be automatic instead of
being a matter for lawsuits. Workmen
should receive certain and definite com
pensation for all accidents in industry
irrespective of negligence.
By the proposed law, employers
would gain a desirable certainty of ob
ligation and get rid of litigation to
determine It, while the workman and
his family would be relieved from a
crushing load.
The constitutionality of the employ
ers' liability act passed by the preced
ing congress has been carried before
the courts. In the event that the
court should affirm the constitutional
ity of the act, I urge further legislation
along the lines advocated in my mes
sage to the preceding congress. Since
1S95 practically every country of Eu
rope, together with Great Britain New
Zealand, Australia, British Columbia,
and the Cape of Good Hope has enacted1
legislation embodying In one form or
another the complete recognition of the
prlnclnle which places upon the em
ployer the entire trade risk in the
various lines of Industry.
Eight-Hour Law.
The principle of the eight-hour day
should as rapidly and as far as prac
ticable be extended to the entire work
carried on by the government and"
the present law should be amended to
embrace contracts on those public
works which the present wording of the
act has been construed to exclude.
Investigation of Industrial Disputes.
Strikes and lockouts, with their at
tendant loss and suffering, continue to
Increase. For the five years ending
December 31, 1905, the number of strikes
was greater than those in any previous
ten years and was double the number
in the preceding five years. These fig
ures indicate the Increasing need of
providing some machinery to deal with
this class of disturbances In the Inter
est alike of the employer, the employe,
and the general public. I renew my
previous recommendation that the con
gress favorably consider the matter of
creating the machinery for compulsory
Investigation of such industrial contro
versies as are of sufficient magnitude
and of sufficient concern to the people
of the country as a whole to warrant
the federal government in taking ac
tion.
Employment of Women and Children.
A thorough and comprehensive meas
ure should be adopted at this session
of the congress relating to the employ
ment of women and children in the
District of Columbia and the terri
tories. The investigation into the
condition of women and children
wage-earners recently authorized and
directed by the congress is now being
carried on in the various states, and
recommend that the appropriation
made last year for the beginning of this
work be renewed, in order that we may
have the thorough and comprehensive
investigation which the subject de
mands. The national government has
as an ultimate resort for control of
child labor the use of the interstate
commerce clause to prevent the prod
ucts of child labor from entering into
interstate commerce. But before using
this it ought certainly to enact modei
laws on the subject for the territorU\=
under its own immediate control.
The Really Dangerous Criminals.
Vice in Its cruder and more
archaic forms shocks everybody: but
there Is very urgent need that public
opinion should be just as severe in con
demnation of the vice which hides itseK
behind class or professional loyalty, or
which denies that it is vice if It can
escape conviction in the courts.
Swindling in stocks, corrupting
legislatures, making fortunes by
the inflation of securities, by wreck
lng railroads, by destroying com
petltors through rebates—these
forms of wrongdoing In the cap
italist, are for more Infamous than
any ordinary form of embezzlement
or forgery yet It is a matter of ex
treme difficulty to secure the pun
ishment of the man most guilty of
them, most responsible for them.
The business man who condones
such conduct stands on a level with
the labor man who deliberately sup
ports a corrupt demagogue and agl
tator, whether head of a union or
head of some municipality, because
he is said to have "stood by the
union." The members of the busi
ness community, the educators, or
clergymen, who condone and en
courage the first kind of wrongdo
ing, are no more dangerous to the
community, but are morally even
worse, than the labor men who are
guilty of the second type of wrong
doing, because less is to be par
doned those who have no such ex
cuse as is furnished either by ignor
ance or by dire need.
Farmers and Wage Workers.
The national government, through
the department of agriculture, should
do all it can by joining with the state
governments and with Independent as
sociations of farmers to encourage the
growth in the open farming country
of such institutional and social move
ments as will meet the demand of the
best type of farmers, both for the im
provement of their farms and for thu
betterment of the life itself. The
farmer must not lose his independence,
his initiative, his rugged self reliance,
yet he must learn to work in the
heartiest co-operation with his fel
lows, exactly as the business man has
learned to work and he must prepare
to use to constantly better advantage
t,.h» knowledge that can be obtained
«m agricultual colleges, v.'hile he
i.n_st insist upon a practical curriculum
In the schools in which his children
are taught.
The present diverse methods of In
spection and grading of grain through
out the. country under different laws
and boards, result in confusion and
lack of uniformity, destroying that con
fidence which Is necessary for healthful
trade. I therefore suggest to the con
gress the advisability of a national
system of inspection and grading of
grain entering Into interstate and for
eign commerce as a remedy for the
present evils.
