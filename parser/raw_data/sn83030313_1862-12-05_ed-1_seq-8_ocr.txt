DREAD Of NOKIHEKNERS
Men. women and children, Degroos and all, ore in mortal
fear of everything and everybody coming from the North.
The sight of a gunboat sets them in a panic of terror, and
thovJlee from a Northern man as from the pestilen e.
Whenever the gunboat approached a landing there was a
general stampede for the woods, and it was with the
utmost diillculty, and frequently only after several miles
chasiug, that auybody could bo found to converse with.
And whon found they wore all too much frigfhiencd to say
anything. The fear did not seem so much to bo a dread
of the Northerners as an apprehsusion of what their own
fate would be should they bo seen conversing with a
Yankee. Many of the plouters have deserted their homes
and taken their families to temporary tenements a few
miles back from the river.
ignorance.
A noticeable circumstance is the general ignorance of
the people regarding currant events. They are completely
excluded from communication with all parts of the coun
try, whether North or South. They hare no mails, nor any
conveyance by which to reach distant points. Some time
ago the planters clubbed together and paid a boy one hun
dred and tirty dollars a trip to bring tbem newspaper!and
mails from Vicksburg; but the boy found that this price
didn't pay him, and he abandoned tho enterprise. For
throe weeks prior to tbo visit of tbo Lexington they bad
received no intelligence from any direction.
Tns war qi'Ksnov.
Tbey are all very an: ious to know if this war is to be
prosecuted as an anti-slavery crusade, and express their
determination, if that to the case, to submit to their pri
vations and sufferings and never yield. Nevertheless
tbey are all anxitus :sr peace, and cannot fully compre
hend why matters should not move along now just as
prosperously as they did iu years gone by. They only
console themselves with tho reflection tbat it is all the
fault of the "damned abolitloulsts."
CONTRA HANI'S.
The Lexington brought away about twenty-five negroes,
who exprossed a desire to toave the plantations: but gene
rally tbo slaves were as loth to come away as tbeir mas
ters were to have them. Theyaro not particularly par

preferring a willing sorvitude with their old masters.

of a large force ol the enemy caused his command to retire

A very excellent cue torn prevail* among the non-com

Mrl Island, and one which tend* greatly to promote the
mprit a* oorp^and general harmony and friendship among
the men. This is, onoe in each year to give a military
ball, by general subscription among themselves, to which
they invite their friends of both sexes 'rom the neigh
boring cities, at these annual reunions a good deal of
fun and mcrrimont prevail, and the men gtve themselves
up to the enjoyment of the occasion with all the earnest
ness and happiness which can well he conoeived. Thoy
spare no pains or expense In celebrating :ho joycus anni
versary, and for the comfort and enjoyment of tlroir
guests they exeat themselves to the farthest extent Of
their ability. On these occasions the commissioned olli.
cers of tbo regiments on the island lay as >de for Uio mo.

their siiborditnites. Scruo persona have objected to this
familiar condescension on (ho ground itwi it is destruc
tive to good discipliuo, and tends to ins <herdItiation lu
the army. This is tar from being true; for, as experience
baa shown, the very oppositchua 1> "eh the result. No one
can doubt that tue highest statu of discipline exists iu tiro
French army, and yet, at b.i! s and parties given
by non eommissmucd oltlccrs in far is and other French
military stations, it is no unci inmou thing to sco tho
brilliant uniforms and decorations of llie very highest
grades of ottlcers. Not long since, it may be rciueuibered;
one of those non-commissioned officers' b lis was given
In France at which ths hmper.ir anil Empress were pro
sent. Their Usjusties onened tho-ball?the Esoperor
dancing with a corporal s wife, and the Empress leading
olT with the corporal bimsoif. No wonder the soldiers
called him "Our Em; eror.''
On Wednesday eroniog lost the annual ball to which
we have thus alluded took place on Governor's Island,
and was a very successful affair. The ballroom was
beautifully due >rated with Hags and banners, the r<>or
being completely covered by these national emblems.
The tine baud of tho Eighth infantry was stationed at one
end of the room, which was illuminated by bayonet
cnudelabras?that is, bayonets reversed so as to repre
sent candle-licks, and bound together ingoniously, the
light reflected from tho brilliant blades sbiuing with
dazzling biiil.fcucy. The portrait of Washington, draped
with days, was hung iu the west of the room and that ol
Gineral McClclian, surrounded by rilles,swords and other
military insiguia, was suspended at the other end, lin
mediately lacing Washington's, lu the ballroom were col
lected a Dumber ol ladies from New York and othor
places, and the amusements of the evening began with
s me inspiriting mu-ic rrom the bahd.
Among tho regular line oflicers who were present was
tne veteran commander of the (Hist, Col. Ixx.mis, of the
Fifth infantry. Tbo Colonel, however, only remaiDod a
short time. The other otliccrs were:?I.lent. Woavor, of
the Eighth Cnitod States infant y, oltleer of the day;
Lieut. Chnds, Sixth infantry ; Lieut. Fisher, Eighth in
fautry; Lieut. Tiernon, Third artillery; Lieut. Casey,
Filth infantry; Lieut. Puree), First iutautry,und Captain
E. K. VauBruut,of tho Anthuu Battalion, and lady.
At a later hour of the evening the amiable lady of
Lieut. Weaver arrived, and.soon entered with mnch spirit
into the amusement of the hour. Her prc. enco lint ad
ditional life to the increasing crowd of dancers.
Tho Committee of Arrangements deserve g.eat praise
for the ample provision mauo lor tho cnnvonieoce cad
comfort of thoir guests. The supper table was loaded
with everything solid and substantial that could bo de
sired, and tho parties presont, it is needless to say, did
ample justice to the delicacies spread be. ore them. This
committee consisted of Sergeant P. H. Guerrin. Corporal
George Bell, Sergeant Sotso, Sergeant Majors Scrivouer
and Taylor and private Taylor
Among tbo non-commissioned oflicers present we ro
ticed Sergeant Dewey, who wus a corporal at tho battle
of Cedur Mountain, but was | rumoted on the Held on iliut
occasion by Captain Pitcher, of the Eighth infantry?
who commanded all tho regular troops at that battle?
for his bravery in action. Sergeant Dewey is a quiet
lookiug yotipg man, and scorns to wear his honor with
bee uuing modesty. His oflicers gtvo him the character
of a good soldier;
Music and dancing were kopt tip with zest ail tho even,
ing, and some of the soldiers and their lady friends
UetermiuoJ to keep at it till Uio sounding of tho reveille.
Ihoso of the guests who wore nt so enthusiastic iu
their devotion to Terpsichore loft at an earlier hour; but
still the dance went on, and the happy party of fair
women and bravo inen continued "to chase tho hours
with liying feet." The call of tho soldier to duty alone
brought the festivities t? a close.
To Lieutonunt w cavor and his excellent lady, as well
as to tbo other lino officers present; to Captain K. K,. Van
Hru.it, of the Anthon Battalion, and to Corporal Wm Bell
and tbo other non-commissioned officers, our reporter begs
to returq his sincere thanks lor all the kindness and
attention shown him during ihe few hours he spent on
the island at this really enjoyable and successful ball.
Supreme Court?Chambers.
Before Hon. Judge Barnard.
IKXUMERABLK WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS.
As the critfca. sometimes say of tbethentrea, "This
bouse is doing an immense business." Judge Barnard's
court is thronged to suffocation every day with parents
and friends of youthful soldiers '-tired cf war's alarums,"
and who feel a longing for tbe relaxations of borne and
civil life. The cases are too numerous to mention in
detail. In some instances tbe writs are ditmissod, and In
many others tho youths are relieved from sorvioe. A few
will suffice. Geo. W. Lundeveg, under age, applied
through bis counsel, Mr. W. 8, Yard, to be discharged on
tbo grounds that he was uot eullste-i by a oomraissioncd
officer, and was never regularly mustered into service;
that the law is particular iu regard to mustering officers;
If not so any person could hold euothor by bii oath ad
ministered vgtboul authority. On these grounds the
Judge granted the discharge. When Lundeveg was first
brought before the f'ourt Hie Judge asked htm
was it for glory ho onitvtodr He replied that
at firet it was; but bo s<on round out "that
it was for money and the riggers." Mr. Hurloy had
issued (our writs of habeas corpus; In one only a return
was made, and he obtained the discharge of the boy.
Mr. Sheehan took out un attachment aga inst? colonel
for contempt in not obeying a writ. In another
case the officer who produced a boy, iu answer to a writ,
came into f'ourt with a long sword by his side. Judge
Barnard asked him wh.it ho wai. He replied mat ho was
in the cavalry. Toe Judge thou told bim that this was a
civil court, and he (tbe officer) might ae well coino there
w-lili bis musket on his nhcu.der er a cauueu ball under
his arm; whereupon the son of Mars ruttrodjto the liall nud
left his w ea|ion in charge of a comrade.
An application was made for an order for publication of
notice of a cot tain cause in the Etxninp Pott.
Judge Barnard, before he grouted the order, told tho
counsel that be should strikeout tho name of that paper
and substitute anothor That paper suited two years ago
that I was not lit to sit upon tho bench. 1 am here now,
and have the advantage of the rod for six years more,
and ag long us t am judge it uevor shall have an order of
pub'icatiou from mo. Tbe substitution was forthwith
made.
