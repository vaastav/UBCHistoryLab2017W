4>nr Success in Katt Tennessee.
Eastern Tennessee, so desperately struggled
1 for, Is now, and wo ntay well hope
! definitely, safe. General Longstreet, if he
i is still within the limits of that State, is
anxious only about the safest way to get out of
i it. Ilurnsitle's noble struggle, which the whole
j country has watched with such intense interest,
! terminated successfully upon the arrival of
i General Sherman with reinforcements on the
j -1th instant, and the retreat of Longstreet on
the same night.
Longstreet's line of retreat is up the valley of
the Holston, which he may follow into Virginia,
liis infantry und transportation follow the
valley on tlie south side of the river, which
thus covers his left. Ilis left is also covered
by his cavalry on the north side of the river
and by the Clinch Mountains, the gaps in
which his cavalry will hold or obstruct.
General Foster wa3 at Tazewell, on Longstreet's
flank, on the 6th, and his cavalry on
that day bad a fight with the enemy's cavalry
in one of the passes. His despatch indicates
- his iutentioa to use his cuvalry to the utmost,
I and if be does so he will doubtless inflict
I severe punishment on the enemy. Sherman's
' cavalry is reported to be on the south side of the
; Ilolstoo; and, though the country is broken and
1 bad for cavalry, it is not improbable that this
| energetic officer may be able to hold the ene1
my's infantry until his own can come up, when
! we may reasonably anticipate the destruction
or capture of Longstreet's entire force.
On Monday the President announced the
retreat of Longstrect by proclamation, and
I called upon the people "to render special
homage and gratitude to Almighty God for
i this trreai advancement of the national cause."
From these words we may gather the importance
that the President attaches to this success,
and we think that bo does not overrate it
Hy Longstreet's failure we see the rebellion
compelled to relinquish its final hold upon the
last grand outpost by which it might have retained
control over the interior and held the
upper country thut forma so grand a part of
the .Southern States. Now it is restricted to the
belt that follows the line of the Atlantic from
Richmond to Mobile, shut up between the
mountains and the sea, ttaukod on the one band
hy the Alleghany and Cumberland Mountains,
that bristle with Northern bayonets, and on the
other l?y the ocean, that teems with Northern
gunboats. Its present territory is represented
by the three points of Richmond, Charleston
and Mobile. Such a country is inevitably weak
at every point, and, while it hardly possesses a
sufficient depth for natural cohesion, it will
doubtless soon be demonstrated that it pos^
sesses but little power of resistance.
f Rkcri'itinu in Nkw York.?We cannot con'
ccive why nny difficulty should be experienced
in this city in filling up the ranks of our armies.
To us it appears that there is nothing so easy.
I There are plenty of men and means; but the
, mode of management adopted, or rather allowc
ed to be practised, tends to prevent rather than
i. encourage enlistment. The men who should
>, swell our forces from this city are continually
o being driven away In'o Jersey and Brooklyn
' by the manner in which the recruiting officers
0 are treated by the Board of Supervisors. It
1 is stated that there are substitute brokers who
control the matter; but it was supposed that
* their improper influence would cease to exist
, immediately after the lute charter election,
o Yet we still have daily delegations of recruitr,
ing o(boors catling upon ns and complaining
d that they cannot obtain the money for the men
' whom tbey enlist. Thia Is all wrong; and Mr.
r Orison Blunt, who is chairman of the Board of
0 Supervisors, and who has a high reputation for
honesty ami patriotism*, should look into the
> matter and see it righted.
Prksimcnt Lincoln's FoaTHcflirao Tijin or
jn Restoration.?We arc promised the President's
)f Message to-day, and wo arc told that its disie
tlnguishing feature will be his plan for the
g reclamation of the rebellious States. It is also
r reported (hat he will start from the compreJ
henshro idea that, under his emancipation pro*
d clumation. slavery is abolished iu the desigd
nated States. 11 tLis be so, then our Presilt
dent's annual Message of 18(13 w 11 l> the most
important document of the kind in the history

in(i tiih; Sim*.- A letter Irum one of oil
London correspondents recently published
gives some important information regard
ing the present aspect of rebel a flair
abroad. The rebel agents, it appeare, abandon
ing all hope of inducing the British government
to allow the rams to depart, have sold them to
the Admira'ty. Convinced tint their can e i:

worth just so much waste papor, with no prospect
of their ever recovering a cent of the
money which has been received from the British
government.
We can imagine the revulsion of feeling
which this collapse of the rebel bubble will occas
on at toe other side. Nothing is so gatliug
to an Englishman as to be tricked out of his
money. His belief in his own suporior intelligence
is so great that he does not admit the
possbility of his being duped. When he finds
that the rebel agents have been too smart for
him, and that be has lost his self-esteem as well
as his cash, his anger will know no bounds.
Ills eyes will then be opened to the shallow
contrivances by which he has been bamboozled,
and he will abuse tlio Southerners worse than
be ever did the Yankees. If the rebel agents
are wise they will make early tracks from
British soil. It will soon prove uncomfortably

Braoo Do>v' Foit.?General Grant has given
(ho finishing blow to Bragg, who lias been
superseded by Hardee. Bragg has been an
unlucky braggart from the beginning of the
war. When he planted bis batteries at Pensa
cola for the reduction ol Fort Pickens, be declared
that, regardless of expense, men or gun
powder, Pickens should be reduced to the
rebel flag. But, instead of taking Pickens
he was compelled to clear out of Pensacoln
and abandon the town and its defences to "the
Yankees/' Bragg, with a considerable army
next invaded Kentucky, and from the centre ol
that State issued a flaming proclamation to the
people of the Northwestern States to join hie
victorious banner and tho Southern con
federacy; but his onward march at Fsrryvilh
was turned into a disgraceful flight over tb<
mountains of Kentucky into Tennessee. Nex
he undertook an advance upon Nashville, bu
was met half way by Itosocrana, and sent of
again, soundly thrashed for his presumption
Next he was turned out of his fortifications a

>- Kkhml, It appears from tho Richr
mon 1 K upiii t-r that the supplies of subsistence 1
, (Indian corn) for tin- rebut armies, including
- the army ol hue, are now chiefly drawn from
? Georgia and Alabama?two Stales which, dowu
to the outbreak of the rebellion, inainly de- |
poiulud for their provisions upon TennetMe, u
i Kentucky and the Nortliweat, and upon Texas. '
i But during tho last be .won the fertile fields of 1
Georgia and Alabama, heretofore entirely do- A
, voted to cotton, have been almost exclusively
devoted to Inditn com, and the result is a r
, Corn crop in th-se two Stales believed to bo *'
i sufficient to supply the rebol armies east of the 1
M ssissippi till tho next summer. At al! evonts,
upon Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina i,
the rebellion now depends for its subsistence c
C through the winter. Virginia, in some portions, u
lias beep reuuoed to a desert, in other portions J1
lias been exhausted; Tennessee, Kentucky, the
great Northwest and aU the Stales west of the ?
Mississippi are utterly cut off' liom Jeff'. Davis, u
mid even Mississippi, extensively planted iu 1
i corn last spring, has, by tho contending armies
t within her borders ainue May last, been almost t
impoveriBbed. The cutting of the remaining r
railroad lines, therefore, between Virginia and t
i Georgia, in compelling Jeff. Davis to ovacuato
Richmond, will leave his mockery of a govern- '
I mont witiiout a local habitation or a name. Is t
it uecessarv to wait till serine to achieve this i
work? Thin is the question which, from policy i
and humanity, we would urge-upon the attention
of the administration. 0

mutter relative to tho disposition of aliens captured vio "

violated the liloekade with impunity, always claiming 8

wore subjects of foroigu Powers. Upou being discharged D
many of these parlies have made their way directly back

runners Tin.a some of them have violated the blockade *
I from two to eight times, as is the case with a large |K>r P
( tion of the crew of tho prize stoumer Uanshoe. The 1
government has found it necessary to distinguish, in the
1 face of these facts, between neutral aliens and uggrossive '
1 alieus, and It is probable that all prisonors hereafter cap- r<
tured violating the blockade, who may he kuown to have '
prevl msly committed the same ofTouce, will bo sent to f
Fort Larayette, Fort Warren and othor strongholds, no 0
matter what the evidences may be regArdlng their na- r

arc.
To day aod Thursday of ihli week baa l>?en not apart
iv Mr. Webb for tbe reception on board or the royal
tallan Irou-ctud frigate lte d'llafta, of sucb of the public
a are Interested Id not ouly a beautiful ship, but the
nost ecu going iron clad frigule ever built la this counry.
The ship lies at the uow liremeu docks at lioboiteD,
ud will bo open for visitors from nine A M. until sunset,
ifier Thursday do visitors will be allowed on board.
The l<e d'ltalia, built by W H. Wobb for tbo
oyal Italian Davy, will shortly loavs our waters for
or uow boine beuoath tbe auuuy sklos of the KssL lorn
of AmonoDu parentage, sho goo*,out to the world a
joiiuBioiil of the lugeuulty and cieallve genius of Amu
ica, and we may be proud of her as a model ship, and as
he llrst regular sea goiug iron clad frigate built In this
ounlrj. Her beauty or form, her symmetry of ouMino
ud the grace of her every feature not ouly olicite tbo
iigbesi coinmenduttoo of our own people aud that of all
oreign olllcl.ils who hive seen her, but the Italian olll
era who have been son! out bore to take her to Italy
re dollgbled with bor, and m every quartor talk of her
n language indicative of tboir high appreciati >n of our
alcnisutidof tboir own gralitlcalion In being possessors
>f sucb a Alio spocimeu of naval architecture.
Tbe ship has some remarkable features, which were
ligpisye.! in a receul trial trfp?her speed excoedtng by
ar what was oipectod?.bowing that our private shipluilders
in Ibis country, when untrammelled by old fogyjin,
stupidity and conceit of certain officials In the Navy
lepartmeut, can build the faslost vessels afloat. Her
teerogo was tbe tbemoof univurstl sad unlimited praise,
be men at tbe helm controlling It wltb perfect ease, while
be large ship obeyed It witb a rapidity and oertaioty quite
n contrast wltb some vessels we could name.
Tbe amount of room which has been devoted to tbe use
if ber battery is frco from obstructions, and will enable
he orew te have a^iple accommodation lor the free use
{ tbelr guus In action. Tho ports are unusually high
hove water, so that iu aseiwiy she will bo dry on dock
nd not flood ber battery witb waves, tier draught of
ruler is remarkably light, tho ship drawing only twentyUree
feet six Inches, with all her equipments on board,
bis of itsolf Is a groat desideratum, and Is in marlcod
ontrast with vessels of bor louuage in the navies of
ranee and Kagland as well as our own.
Mr. Webb has shown bis energy and skill in this snip,
od in tbe midst of a terriblo civil war, when labor and raa
arial were not readily procured, when \ thousand druwooka
have boon encountered, bo has completed within
tie specified time one of "tbe most beautiful ships of war
Host. Wo can learn from this a lesson, and the Navy
lopartmeut should heed it.
The well known ability of tbe constructor to carry out
ha desires of the Italian Minister of Marlue, as well as bis
ecuuiary responsibility, was undoubtedly tbe prime
suae or his nhtatiiinir Lhasa conlritcts silt nmlii nil hup
a&ncl&t troubles be liu never given the Italian authorises
any opportunity to distrust hint. In tbe midst of our
uly riots tbe Italians wore alarmed lost their ships
bould be destroyed; but tbe manner In wblcb Mr. Webb
uarded them against attack obtained for bun a new condones
iu tbe eyos of the Italians.
In point of workmanship the He d'ltalia stands o it promineut.
Not a thing lias boon neglected to make her
launch, strong, beautiful and seaworthy, liar armor
dating has been secured la tbe most Arm manner, while
bo bull which benrs it is a wonder of strength.
There is one thing wbich wo must all regret, if rumor
HI truthful; aud that is, that orders btve been rocelved
or the Ret!alantuomo, an old lasnioiied sailing ship of tbe
ina, with a small auxiliary engine, to keep In close c >m any
with the iroo clad. It sfflnd have been ordered
therwlse. The Re d'ltalia should hare been allowed to
nake the ruu across the Atlantic as quickly as she could,
aid wo feel coulldeut that sbo would have surprised
ho world; but, as orders stand, she Is condemned
0 poke along at less than half speed, so that the
Id sblp-of the-Une, which, to do ber utmost, cannot
uake much speed, can be kept in sight. This order,
10 doubt, is the result of the recent failure of
he Krench and Knglish iron-clads to keep at sea In
tad weather, and the Italians do not wish to loso
heir officers and men In the event of tbe barest poedililty
of tbe ship foundering. But no one need fear that.
1 plan of her midship section gives her the most beautlul
and easy posture in tbe water, end she win no doubt
irova a most famous see boat.
It has been stated that Mr. Webb is about to build
>tber iron'clad vessels for tha Italian navy, In addition to
iie two be now has on haad. We enjoy the facilities Cpr
:or roc ting the statement and-saylng that be bos no such
ntention, nor have tbe Italians at present any dealre to
ncrease their Iron clad navy by having them constructed
lutside thalr own navy yard*. They have the men,
noons and yards la which to build them, and they have
dready built some of the Dnest vessels In their navy.
Die representative of their navy now in this port must
lot by any means be considered a sample, however. She
was oum oy id* N en pom ana nvtru years ago, and boors
the advent or the present style of war Teste?*.
There la no doubt but the Coiled Slates government
irould only be too glad to obtain tho He d'ltalla and
fie de bulgl de 1'ortogallo, but the Italians, on the other
tiand, would bo but too sorry to part with them.
