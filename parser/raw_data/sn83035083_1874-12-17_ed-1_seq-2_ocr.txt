Columbus, Dec. 12, 1874.
Ed. Press : The conundrum maker
proposes this: "Why is the Ohio
Legislature like the mills of the myth
ical gods of the ancients?" The ready
were mutilating the connty records, answer to which is : Thev grind slow-
thus endangering all titles to property
so that no man's property was safe
for a moment.
The following is given as a brief
history of the affair :
The troubles date as far back as the
municipal election in June last. The
whites of the city made a desperate
effort to redeem the city from the cor
ruption that had been going on there
for over four, years. The negroes
nominated a ticket, composed almost
exclusively of their ewn race, and en
deavored to carry the election by ex
tensive colonization from the country,
even going so far as to band them in
military organizations. The leading
negro, who fills the office of Chancery
Clerk, declared in a public speech that
the whites would yet be proud to ally
themselves by maruTage with colored
men, and that, were be not married,
he eould easily secure as his wife any
white belle in the city. But fer a
counter military organization on the
.part of the whites they would have
been overpowered at this election by
the votes of the country negroes. The
irritation produced by their proceed
ings was further aggravated by the
recent discoveries that Davenport,Car
doza and Dorsey, all filling important
ly. Whether the remainder of the
answer "but they grind fine" ought to
be given, the revolutions of the future
will determine.
There seems to be a fixed purpose
to reduce the pay of the county officials
of the state, especially in the large
counties, so that "court house rings"
will have less of golden links in them
hare now. Seme four or five bills,
having for tbeir purpose this end, are
pending in both theHouse and Senate.
It will require wise action, if no injus
tice is done the officers of the smaller
counties. Some propose to make all
offices salaried, by requiring all fees
and costs to be paid into the county
Treasury, which will simply result in
paying for county work by au unequal
tax, the man with or without prosperi
ty, drawn into law, paying perhaps
largely while his neighbor, more for
tunate, pays little or nothing for this
purpose. Another plan proposed, is
to reduce all fees and costs about thir
ty per cent, from the present rates.

A distressing accident occured on
the Atlantic and Great Western Kail
road, about a mile west of Manfield
on Friday afternoon. Charles Wen
shiser. a lad about seventeen years Of
age, fell from the top of one of the
cars, the train running over hi body,
cutting him almost in two, and caus
ing his death instantly.
Seven frame dwellings occupied by
German families at Brighton, a suburb
of Cincinnati, were destroyed by fire
at an early hour Monday morning.
The flames spread with such fearful
rapidity that many occupants of the
houses were obliged to escape with
out clothing, and it was with great
difficulty the children were aroused
and rescued.
records. The Sheriff, who was about
to receive $150,000 of taxes drawn
from an impoverished people, was also
found to have only a straw bond. Ap
peal was made to the negro' Board of
Supervisors, to order him to make a
fresh bund, but this was refused.
Despairing of any relief from any
source whatever, the whiles resolved
to force the resignation ol these cor
rupt officials, and the negroes rallied
in terce to prevent iL It is not doubt
ed that the application ot Governor
Ames, who is a rancorous enemy of
the whites, to the President for troops
will be promptly honored, and that

negroes and Radical thieves in their
carnival of plunder and oppression.
It is also believed that the subject will
come up iu some way or other before
Cengress, and probably lead to a de
bate in which many of the issues of
the last general election will be reviewed.
A bill has been introduced into the
Legislature "to permit teachers in rur
al districts' to adjourn tbeir schools on
holidays and for one week wWcn the
Teachers' Institute is in session.". Of
course this is a proper subject for leg

At a caucus of Republican Senators
held the day after the assembling of
Congress a discussion on the financial
question developed the fact that the
lack of harmony which existed at the
last session still exists. Soma Sena
tori were sanguine enough to think, a
comproirme might be effected and a
currency bij I agreed upon that would
satialy.tho. conflicting views of mim-
I beis. But the views, of the resump-
tionUI-s find inflationists are too dia
mctiTtialjv oposi'd to each other to
admit of anv such compromise. The
matter will have q he decided at this
session of Congyees, and it will be

Southern Appeals to The "Great Father."
The country has been afforded two
excellent specimens as showing the
revolutionary effects produced by
Grantism in the South, Both these
specimens came from Alabama, where
the thieving Federal carpet-baggers
haye been mast active. First we had
the ''Republican county officers" of
Eufaula and Clayton, in Barbour
County, calling ou the Federal Gov
ernment to send down troops to pro
tect them against the "White Leag
uers." At the very time that this call
from the Barbour County politicians
and carpet-baggers was received at
Washington, the new Democratic
Governor of Alabima was delivering
bis noble and patriotic inaugral ad
dress at Montgomery, In the course ot
which he said "he would regard it as
"one of his highest aud most sacred
-obligations to see ibat the laws are
"Jaiihlully executed, and (he rights of
"all citizens, without regard to race or
"color or previous condition, duly
"guarded and protected." As the
election is now over, of course this
stupid requestjWhich less than a month
ao would hare beu a godsend to
Landaule't Williams for Southern-oat-
rage capital, was treated as of course
it ought to have bceii treated, and the
-llepublican officers of Barbour Coun
ty" were advised to call upon their
own State authorities if they needed
protection.
The otBer specimen came from the
Mayor and Aldermen of Tnscurabia,
which town suffered so severely from
the effects of the gale the other day.
These men sent an appeal by telegraph
to President Grant personally asking
for immediate relief by the order of
a supply of rations"
Thus Grantism and carpef-bagaTsm
in the South have taught the people
ot these two districts at least to be
lieve that the present President not
only has authority to order the Fed
eral army to any part of the Union to
protect a small gang of politicians in
a bar-room brawl, but that he - abso
lutely holds the key of the Treasury,
aud can Walk in and take out as much

The Constitution-making disease
that broke oat all over the state two
or three years since, culminating first
at the State Capital, and then stopping
over at Cincinnati, for a number of
mouths, although seriously checked
by the people last August, is showing
decided symptoms again in the Gener
