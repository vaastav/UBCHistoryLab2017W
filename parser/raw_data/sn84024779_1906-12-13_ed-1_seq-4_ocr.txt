Of what use is your buasted
political equality when a mas

must work for a living?
The man who has laid away
the President's message to con
gress to read, and then forgets
it will be none the looser.
Several railroads have given
it out that they will not obey
the railroad rate bill. To heil
with the law, say they. As
they own the public officials
they can do pretty much as
they please.
The president in his message
tried to use his big stick on the
San Francisco School Board
in relation to the Japs, But the
School Board give Teddy to
understand that he could not
•run things in that neck of the
woods, aud that they were tbe
School Board of San Francisco.
Roosevelt sent a special mes
sage to Congress Dec. 6th ask
ing for a bill to be passed giv
ing him power to dismiss army
officers,-why this? If he has
authority to dismiss two com
panvs of regulars withot trial*
lie surely has the authority or
gall to dismiss petty officers,
The senate of the United
States has called upon the sec
retary of war and the president,
by resolution, for infoimation
about the dismissal from the
aervice of the colored troops of
the 25th infantry, about which
there has been so much said
recently.
Men of small mind or mental
caliber are the ones who put on
superior airs. The same is
true as to women The really
great minds regard euery man
and woman of good character
as an equal, You can easily
show your "inferiority" by
claiming "superiority." "By
their fruits ve shall know them"

What those papers really want [several weeks
is to capture the organization
of the two houses of the legis

make the Burke administration
a failure, so that the machine
may be easily dominant in the
party and the state two years
hence. The Search-Light

Strength, or Nerve Weakness nothing more. Pos
itively, not one weak heart in a hundred is, in it

hidden tiny little nerve that really is all at fault
Shis obscure nerve—the Cardiac, or Heart Nerve
—simply needs, and must have, more power, mors
stability, more controlling, more governing
strength. Without that the Heart must continue
to fail, and the stomach and kidneys also have
these same controlling nerves.
