COAL MEN ARE
FACING PROBE
Both Miners and Operators To
Be Subjects of Grand Jury
Investigation
SIX LEADERS APPEAR
Disclosures Indicate Operators As
Well As Miners In Conspiracy to
Violate Lever Law— Evi
dence Collected.
Indianapolis, Ind., Dec. 5.—Upon
the heels of its institution of contempt
proceedings against officials of the
United Mine Workers of America, the
government has taken steps to broad
sen the scope of its prosecutions in
connection with the strike of coal
minei-s, and will investigate alleged
violations of the Lever fuel control
•act and the Sherman anti-trust law, by
jminers, operators and others.
Judge A. B. Anderson, United States
•district court, ordered a special ses
sion of the federal grand jury Here
and immediately afterward a state
ment was given out by L. Ert Slack,
:United States district attorney, and
Dan W. Simms, special district at
torney, who is aiding in the injunction
proceedings, declaring that the time
.has arrived to determine "whether
this is a government of law or a group
of men."
Six officials of the United Mine
Workers of America, who were
•charged with criminal contempt for
alleged violation of the federal court's
injunction against the strike, appeared
at the federal building and furnished
bonds of $10,000 each for their ap
pearance in court.
It was stated that determination to
begin the grand jury investigation
came as a result of disclosures in the
proceedings against the miners' lead
ers, which tended to show that the
coal operators, as well as the miners,
vcre in a conspiracy to violate the
..ever law. Agents of the Department
r-f Justice two weeks ago started an
investigation of alleged violation of
:he Sherman anti-trust law by operat
ors and the evidence collected by
them has been added to that secured
in previous investigations of the mi
ners'.
FARMFRS ROSE TO EMERGENCY
^What They to Win the War and
Sa,'e
World from Starvation.
Washington, Dec. 6.—In his annual
report just issued Secretary of Agri
culture Houston tells in a brief way
how the farmers of America helped to
win the war and are saving the world
from starvation by marvelously in
creased production of foodstuffs. He
says the wheat crop for 1919 is esti
mated at a million bushels over that
of 1918 and that of corn 300,000,000
tbushels over the last year's. In meat
•production, also, the record figure of
last year will be exceeded, and the
same is probably true of milk, eggs
and poultry. Crop yields per acre,
says Mr. Houston, show an upward
tendency, due largely to better meth
ods and better machinery.
TULFD0 CARS TO RESUME

The order followed quickly a con

.Doherty and his chief counsel, Charles
A.
Gruenauff of New York, in which
the court advised acceptance of coun
cil action.

DIVERSIFIED PROGRAM
Is Outlined By President Wilson
In Message.
Suggests Tribunal To Peacefully Set
tle Industrial Disputes—Asks for
New Tariff.
Washington, Dec. —A diversified
program to restore a peace-time busi
ness status, revise the tax system*,
curb unrest, reduce the cost of living,
and rectify labor and farming condi
tions, was recommended by President
Wilson in his message to the new ses
sion of Congress.
The President asked for new tariff
laws based on the nation's changed
relation to the rest of the world, sug
gested that the income and excess
profits tax schedules be simplified, ad
vocated steps to improve rural condi
tions and promote production, and de
clared for a "genuine democratization
of industry" to protect both labor and
capital.
The railroad problem he reserved
for a future message and he made no
statement of his intentions regarding
the peace treaty or Mexico.
He declared the causes of unrest to
be superficial and temporary, and
made his only reference to the Sen
ate's failure to ratify the peace treaty
in saying that restlessness was due
largely to the nation's hestitation in
determining its peace policy.
In an extended discussion of labor
conditions, he declared the workers
had just cause for complaint in many
matters, and that there should be a
"full recognition of the right of those
•who work, in whatever rank, to parti
cipate in some organic way in every
decision that- directly affects their wel
fare."
He asserted that the right of indi
viduals to strike must be held invio
late, but added that there must be a
firm stand against "the attempt by
any class to usurp a power that only
government itself has a right to exer
cise as a protection to all.
Finally he suggested the establish
ment of a tribunal for peaceful deci
sion of industrial disputes.
