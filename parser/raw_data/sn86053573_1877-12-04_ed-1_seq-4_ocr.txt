To ACCOMMODATE the. President, min
tage and tho report of the Secretary of tho
Treasury ftt length and a liberal jnonis of

We iuert on another page tho prospectus
fthe "tVhukly KKPunLicAN, which, tu U
therein set forth, will be Issued on Thurs

mouth aheet of eight page. This publica
tion will contain a great tariely of political
end mUoellancous reading matter, and In
politics it will be thoroughly and decidedly
(Republican according to the most orthodox
tenets of the faith.
The 1'rMldcnt'a M engage.
We give tho full text of the President's
Annual message to Congress to the readers
if The National IUpudlican this morn
ing. "We commend It to tho candid perusal
ef every intelligent American citizen. It
Is an Important and well-composed public
document, which presents In t main a
Yry candid and explicit tIow otTthe part
f the Executive of the condition of the
wintry, accompanied by such suggestions
and recommendations to the law-making
ower as In his Judgment Is demanded by
te circumstances of the occasion.
We are not prepared at this moment,
owing to a want of time and room, to treat
of the Tarious questions involved In this
document much at length. We see in It
at a glance some things to commend and
others to dissent from ; but, u a whole, the
document Is highly creditable to the states
manship and the literary culture of the
Executive. It Is not without its merits
and Its fallacies, all of which we may take
time and occasion to discuss in the future
In a fearleas and frank manner, under a de
termination to "render unto Cceaar the
things that are Cesar's," and unto the popu
lar Interests of the country the things that
properly belong to them. Our sense of Jus
tice to the national welfare will not
permit us to commend with partisan
partiality much that Is suggested and
recommended, for we think it in
consistent with the material interests of the
country; but we- hope to temper our criti
cisms with a spirit of candor which will
how that while we disagree with some of
the propositions put forth on the questions
of Internal policy taking, for instance, the
practical workingsof the so-called Southern
policy, the civil service reform, and the
problems of finance we ore disposed to
urge our views, and then so far to agree to
disagree.
It affords as plcasnre to notice that the
Fresldent discusses the duties of the Government-
toward the District of Columbia
In an Intelligent, liberal, and catholic spirit,
lie holds to n Just appreciation of the ex
isting relations between the Government
and the District, and what is due to its
people from Congress. His suggestions and
recommcrfdatfons are wise and jnst, and do
credit both to his head and heart, and we
trust will bear with proper weight upon tho
future action of the law-making power.
When Did It Hcstn?
It Is difficult to decide Just when tho
conspiracy which has engaged so much pub
lic attention recently did begin, and hence
its begiuning and ending are neither clearly
defined in the mists of history. h 1875
the affairs in Louisiana had become so tur
bulent and alarming ns to call for tntestl-
' gal ion, and a sub-corn ml ttee, consisting of
Memrs. Phkuti, Foster, and Vari er, was
sent there for that purpose. These gtmtle-
men were at once captured by the Demo
crats, who plied them with generous atten
tlons and other seductive influences to an
extent that greatly dimmed their visions
and interfered with a clearness of ight In
looking Into matters. Their report was
strongly tinted with Democratic coloring,
and did not provo satisfactory to the aver
age intelligence of the Kepublicnn party.
This fact led to the visit to that sec-

Little Kocx, Axr., Nor. 39, 1577.

Dear Six: In the National Kepublican
of the SUt instant you comment upon the
question, "Who is responsible for tho crushing
out of tho Republican party at the South?' and
your view of tho sltuatlou will be accepted as
the truth by ninety-nine one hundredths of
sllSonthern BepubHiatu, whether they hold
0 nice or not.
In the present anomalou condition of affairs
this latter class wttl preserve tho silence that
profound respect for their salarlos demands;
but at he Jit tbey proUbty think as little or
the President's blunder as the rest of us.
To cure a disease Is one thing, to kill the pa
tient another ; and this particular attempt to
emancipate voters from an alleged control by
office holders will be tha greatest btlure In
American politics. Jt would be a misnomer to
call It statesmanship.
Here In Arkansas, as elsewhere In the South,
we have sufferod from the misconduct of offi
cials, and the confidence of the masses has
been given to soma Republicans who have not
proven to be worthy of it; put, nevertheless,
no one thinks of operating a party without the
general aid of those who receive the honors
and enjoy the emoluments of public station.
'That order" has accomplished all you
charge to It, and, Instead of resulting la the
'emancipation of tho action of voters from the
control of office-holders," it has operated In
the South at least like a dcath-darap. and
down here Republicans stand aghast at the
future, and fcol that uutoss the high chiefs of
the party at Washington and throughout the
North protest against this surrender to the
Democracy, (for this Is practically whtt It Is,)
and unless there shall be a change of front by
the administration, it will be a hopeless un
dertaking, for two years at least, to revive the
Republican party in the South,
And yet whatever may be true of other
Southern States, there are 40,000 Republican
voters In this. The colored citizens, as a class,
are disposed to be true to the Republican party.
There are many Northern men scattered
through the State who are true to It, and there
are Southern Republicans who were ,llving
here when the war broke out who are true to it.
Bat tbe President seems to set as though the
Northern men especially who are here are all
of the speculative, good-for-nothing, dishonest
clacs, and unworthy of his confidence. Yet It
should never be forgotten that not only in Ar
kansas, but all through the South, the close of
the war left in the territory that they had
aided to conquer, thousands of men, who per
iled everything for the sake of their country,
who abandoned their callings to defend the
flag, and are now In the South In the most per
fect good faith, and striving, each In his own
way, to live and let live. "
A pronounced Republican In the Southern
States Is politically as obnoxious now as ever,
and If he thinks proper to be active In a politi
cal campaign he Is a radical'1 in what is
attempted to be made an opprobrious senso of
the term, aud no distinction Is drawn between
thwe whose personal conduct Is above reproach
and some men who unfortunately have once
been trusted by their party, but never wilt be
again.
Party strife Is bitter, end those Democrats
whose Confederate record is the clearest are
the most trusted. The ruling element In the
South believes, as It always has believed,
that the American Union la simply a confed
eracy of co equal States, and not a great and
Indivisible nationality, and conciliation from
this element In a party sense there Is not,
from present Indications, the slightest hope to
oxpect, and yet tho country Is witnessing an
attempt by a Republican national ad minis tra
tratlon to placate an adversary by methods
that are as unwise In theory as they will
pnn e to be utterly deceptive In practice, for
the President's "policy," If It be a "policy,"
has now been fairly tried, and in this connec
tion the New York Itmet docs Indeed present
an accurate review of this overture to South
ern Democrats, on tho one hand, and of tho
collapsoof Southern Republicanism In certain
of the cotton States on the other,
Arkansas, moreover, can bo added to thellst,

The National.
If aver folks enjoyed themselves the audi
ence at the National last night did. If one may
judge from the fact that they laughed and
screamed and roared and applauded from the
time the curtain went upon the first aot till
thenas of the play,
" Forbidden Fruit" Is without doubt Bond
canity best comedy. It Is replete with fun
and laughable situations throughout The
comedians, William H. Crane and Stuart Rob
eovrhave made this comedy the best that is
now presented on the American stage. Crane
as Sergeant Butter and EoUou as Giro Dove are
young married men and ftreat frieuds.
They dotermlne to have a frolic without the
knowledge of their better halve, and then tho
fun commences and goes on till the end. No
harm Is done; no Immorality Is committed,
and the most fastidious foil to find fault with
any action or word of tho play. Crane and
Kobson were never more funny than thoy
were last evening. They are comedians of tho
very first order, and richly deserveded the
graud ovation with which they were received
lat evening.
Mrs. Uermon, Blanche Ford. Laura Joyce,
Alccla Bolson, all did remarkably well, while
the remainder of the company were well
up In their lines for the first representation.
If the renders of the BaruBUCAN really de

means see Crane and Bolson, the Oherubt In

this evening.

together a delightful entertainment Miss
Lee and Bose Watklns are charming vocalists
and first-class artists, white the renown of
