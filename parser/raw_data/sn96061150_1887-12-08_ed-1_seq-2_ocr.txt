MUNICIPAL PATRIOTISM.
The followiug is from an editorial
in the December Century: The
voter who has come to claim for his
individual conscience the supreme
power of private judgment in national
politics is still far too apt to accept
without hesitation the guidance of his
party 'Tnachine" in stale politics,
while he looks upon city politics as
practically beneath his notice. He is
affronted by the action of his national
party, in any of its attempts to control
the action of its minorities, while he
gazes tranquilly above and beyond the
grossest abuses in his own city gov
ernment His common council spends
months in a "dead-lock" over the ap
pointment, of three or four policemen,
with "deals" and diplomatic negotia
tions enough for the management of
an empire and hardly enough success
for the management of a kitchen;
taxation results merely in providing
a livelihood for incompetent officials
and in thrusting inefficient public ser
vice upon the citizens; and still the
citizen refuses to learn the essential
lesson that there is such a thing as
municipal patriotism, and that munic
ipal politics is its only practical mode
of expression.
Why should the politics of the city
bo tied down to the politics of the
nation or the state? Is there any
identity of interest between the two,
such as would bo apt to secure effi
cient city administration by a selec
tion of city officers based upon na
tional party preferences? Everyone
knows the contrary from practice as
well as from theory; in a few of our
cities, the lesson has already devel
oped a strong and effective independ
ent city vote; and yet, take the coun
try through, the individual conscience
seems to be almost as inert as ever in
this matter. The man who, moved by
conscience, takes up his own burden
of battle against the abuses of
his own city government, is pretty
certain of the pity of thoce who know
him personally and of the criticism of
those who are strangers to him; he
need not expect that which he de
servesthe cordial sympathy of his
fellow citizens, their consideration for
his inevitable errors, and their rejoic
ing in his successes. His fellow citi
zens have not yet been educated up
to that point We still lack that es
sential factor in political development
Municipal patriotism. Thousands
of men have been found ready and
willing to die for the United States or
even for the individual state. Where
are the men who would die for Brook
lyn, or Chicago, or San Francisco?
Where, indeed, are the men who would
live for them?
Tim president's message consists of
5,129 words, exclusively on the tariff.
He thinks that the surplus in the
treasury should be prevented from fur
ther accruing, and that whatever re
ductions are made should be made in
custom duties rather than internal
revenue, a doctrine which is accepta
ble to England.
For Savins; Life on a Stormy Sea.
Rear admiral Ammen has proposed
to the secretary of the navy a plan
for the rescue of shipwrecked passen
gers. It consists of the construction
of what is called a balsa, or a float.
The rear admiral proposes that in the
event of the abandonment of a vessel
at sea the balsas could be used in a
Bea so rough that ordinary boats
could not be utilized, and he sug
cests the following mode of launch
ing: "The head sail should be hoist
ed so as to bring the wind quarterly;
oil bags would be thrown over from
each quarter. The railing at the
stern, fitted for unshipping, would be
let down and the launching skids put
in place, and a balsa carried aft by
eight men and lowered with four
on it Then a rough car to fit in the
skids would be loaded with the help
less persons and lowered to the balsa,
oe received and placed and the op
eration continued until the boat had
her load; then she would be cast
adrift, make a drag of her mast and
sail, throw overboard her oil bag,
and the same operation would be re
peated until every one was embarked.
Then they should fasten to each oth
er in sections of fives." The admiral,
in a letter to secretary Whitney, asks
that the department construct a balsa
and subject it to practical tests in
all kinds of weather. The balsa con
sists of two casks, upon which a plat
form is laid. In the casks are scut
tles for stowing provisions. A suffi
cient; number of them to carry 1,000
people couia, in tne opinion or tne
rear admiral, be carried on a large
steamer without inconvenience.

Republican Convention.
The Delegates to the Astoria Republican
City Convention will meet in conveniion for

NEW YORK TRESS COHHENT.
New Tobk, Dec. 6. The Commer
cial Advertiser, in speaking of the
President's message, says: "The nov
elty in the form and the unconven
tional tone of the message, as well as
the urgent and overshadowing impor
tance of the single topic it considers,
will attract the universal attention of
the nation to the dooument If we
are not mistaken, it will have decis
ive weight in the future of the two
parties and legislation."
The Post says editerially: "The
message deals with nothing but pub
lio finances and the means of bring
ing about equilibrium between re
ceipts and expenditures. This is
unusual, but under the circumstan
ces entirely wise. In order to make
the deepest impression on the public
mind on a most important, if not the
only important, topic of public con
cern, it was necessary. Otherwise
when the session got advanced, it
would be next to impossible to secure
auy results, as other important mat
ters would absorb all the attention of
congress. The people on theP acific
coaBt, he says feel the need of the
Postal Telegraph more than auy one
else."
The World says: In thus pressing
upon congress the issue of para
mounMmportance to the exclusion of
all other issues, the president has
shown a true comprehension of the
situation. He has championed the
cause of the long overburdened tax
payers. He has made himself the de
fender of the business interests lm
periled by the prospective lock-ups of
the money, and he has also supplied
his party with what it has long lucked
an issue and a leader.
The Mail and Express says: The
president has framed an issue for the
next year's campaign. He has put
the Democrats fairly on the free-trade
platform, and the country will recog
nize the fitness of the position. The
devotion of the whole messago to a
single subject was necessary to em
phasize the fact that Cleveland is a
candidate for re-election as a free
trade leader. The Bepublican party
has nothing to complain of. It has
for several years urged the making of
an issue, and Cleveland has
simply accepted the invitation of
his political opponents. We are glad
he has accepted it so frankly, bo fair
ly and so boldly. There is the prom
ise of a great political contest in the
unequivocal words of this extraor
dinary message. The Republicans
will enter upon the campaign with
courage and confidence. There is no
doubt about their attitude on the
tariff question. They took their
ground years ago, and are prepared
to maintain it now. The president
and speaker Carlisle say that they de
sire to do nothing that will injure the
American workingmen or American
manufacturers, but neither working
men nor manufacturers will be de
ceived by glittering generalities.
They are now free traders and believe
that both laborer and manufacturer
would be benefited by the abolition
of duties. No such false issue will
be fought over. The next campaign
will be a battle between protection
and free trade, and it will be a whole
some, vigorous political contest, with
the chances largely in favor of the
Qepublicans.
