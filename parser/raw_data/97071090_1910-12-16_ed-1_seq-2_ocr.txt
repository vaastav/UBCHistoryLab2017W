as President Taft In his message to

negotiations were practically com

What effect the action will have
on tho many financial deals between
this country and China now pending

Other Chinese railroads, it has been
planned, are to be built with Amer

SIU'HAMHXTO, Oil., Dec. M
A prophecy that (Jovernor-elcct
Johnson will eliminate the numerous
"political colonels" that composed
the majority of the military stnfls ot
former governors is followed todn.
by u leport that Johnson is planning
to ask for the submission oi .i plan
for tho establishment of n convenient
working staff, composed of men fa
miliar witli military life am'. di-ei-pline.
The details of the icorgan
intion of the governor's staff have
not been made public, but it ih a mi1.
piediction that any of the chant
contemplated by Johnson will ieceic
the indorsement of the officers and
men of the California national gnaw,
who feel that the aides of the gov
ernor should be chosen 'from imioiij.
the men who really study militnrv
condilims. That the scheme wi"
arouse the antagonism of the "ball
room aides" is the belief C the
bonalide guardsmen, ns the gold lace
was given for political urvie , .inn
it is asserted that fhe same ml In
ences will be used to retain th? deco
rations.
The probable procedure of John
son, it is said, will be to revoke the
commissions of some !I0 gold-lace
colonels and provide himself with i
compare staff lepresenling the vnn
otis blanches of tie guard.
This would mean a staff compris
ing a colonel of infantry, one of ar
tillery, another of cavalry, one ol
the signal corps mid a fifth chose i
I nun the naval militia.

Gives the Best Light at Any Price
When you pay more than the Rayo
nrice for a lamp, you are paying for extra
decorSons that cannot add to the qua ty
of the light. You can't pay for a better
light, because there is none. An oil light
has the least effect on the human eye, and
the Rayo Lamp is the best oil lamp made,
though low In price. You can pay $S, $10,
or $20 for some other lamp, aifd although
,,.. nt n mnrfi cnstlv lamp, you can t
net a better light than the white, mellow,
diffused, unflickering light of the low
priced Rayo.
Has a strong, durable shade-holder. This set
son's burner adds to the strength and appearance.
Made of solid bruss, nickeled, and easily polished.
