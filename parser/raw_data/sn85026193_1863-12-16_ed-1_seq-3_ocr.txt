"For. the first tiiu t since Mr. Pom. Toy was ap
pointed Post .Master at this place, the lit' of un-cilled-for
h;lters is published."
The above is the first sontence of an item iu tho
la.-t issue of the IfUjicmlctit, concerning the publi
catiou of tho list of uncalled-for letters in last
week's Jovr.SAt.. That it is a groundless false
hood, is proved by the Joviinal of March IS 185",
wherein Mr, Puuieroy published a list of uncalled
for letters; and that it is a grossly malicious false
hood, is evident from the fact that the m in who
wrote it could not have even believed that u Tost
Master who has been iu olllce since January 1ml,
hasnot, until last week, puMialied a lUtof uncalled
for letters. Having thus shown that hia Clot su
tence is a lie, people will not consider it nrc.jovy
for us to notice the remainder of his item for no
one would placo any reliance in the evidence of n
wituess who commenced hia testimony by per
juring himself I Hut the aforesaid editor, on the
above, us on every other occasion, "rings in" his
" big circulation" qoostion, and we therefore take
tho liberly of saying a word or two about his con
cirn. Tm: " iKurri'vuHST "How it is Gottks IV! -The
iii"i'ail is not " what it seems !" It pre
tends aud possibly its thirty or frty readers may
believe it to baa paper printed ut Perrvsbutg;
but it isn't tint, by a Huh more rtmi i It ori
ginally starts from the Dlmle ollice, Toledo, in this
wise ! It is well known that, iu every city office, a
large number of handbills, political and otherwise,
are printed for general circulation throughout tho
surrounding country. Now the o'inn'ciit man
has a terrible mania for publishing a newspaper
an4 the proprietors of the Vlwle, probably wishing
to humor him, occasionally print oil some sheets,
or handbills, headed, " Wood County Independ
ent," for circulation in this county. They are,
nf course, printed only on one side ! Watch
the result I The Dayton and Michigan train comes
thundering along stops at rerrysburg somebody
throws off a wad of tho aforesaid bills hvlrpiDiU-nt
man being on band, manages to get tho "first
grab" at it " totea" it to hia shop, prints some
thing diily on the other side, and jocosely calls it
" my rtoospaper '." And tho people smile pitifully
just as they do when some poor fellow, who has
the "gold mania," aits from moruing till nijiht, fum
bling over lid buttons, and calling them "eagles !"
But this poor fellow is not content with calling his
sheet a ' uoospapcr," but likewise Insists that it it
the " largest circulation !" Ao i thu " reminds us"
of a fellow wu ones know, who had tho " colt
mania." He bad succeeded iu raising a very
'scrawny runt" of a colt, and when it was three
years old, ha not only imagined (hat it was the bett
colt in tbe country, but conceived that every ouo
e!se thought ao tno and whenever anything was
sanl, he Mipposert Unit it mini be souicthin iupr.ne
ofhi.1 Colt. One day he hitched up his Colt with
another animal, to go to a Lake port, a few miles
distant, with a load of staves. Shortly after ho
started, a neighbor shouted to hini, " llow much
do you get for those itavos V" "Il's nulfin but a
freo year old I" responded our hero, as ho cracked
his whip an l jogged on. Soon after- trd a mer
chant hailed him with, "Can you bring me in a
load of salt, to-day 1" " Il's unllm but a free year
old, sir !" be cj.iculaUd, c Isting an admiring glance
at his colt. Agaiu the merehaut said, " I want
you to bting mc in somo salt !" " I tell you it's
miiii but a free yoar old," respunded tho colt man,
as bo whipped up and went his way.
Thn it is with the Mepmdmt " largest circula
tion" mania man. As ho sits in his sanctum, oc
cupying the slick of wood which he terms his arm
chair, writing bis editorial on tbe margin of au old
"handbill," a man enters, and the following ron
versatiun takes place :
Utramjcr " (iood day, sir."
.1oiiiti .'mi " Ye, sir, its tht largest .irctilutin
in the county.''
Sirati'jcr'' What's the nens 7"
Win i. i .Via" I tell you it' the largest circula-
, tion anywhere around here."
fit, u.yrr- -" You d ni't think there'll be draft in
this eoumy, do you ."
.Vmim Jni " Now I'll bet the drink I've got
the bigger circulation lou any noospspi-r in the
States."
S'rwvfr " 1 dou't believe the war w ill end this
winter."
.Voo',1 .Viim Don't care whether you believe it
or not publish the ouly noospaper that circulated'
to speak of, on this continent."
And thus the poor mania man ravos about hi
noospaper" aud hi " eirculati." He evidently
ha a chrunio, eomiound, double -and twitted " big
circulation "in bi head I We pity him he has
our heartfelt commiseration--and if we are ever
o unf jrtunatu as to have so lar.je a " circula
tion " that e can ueilber toll the truth or pay our
honest debt, wj shall ask him to rcturu our ym

as it relates to Slate ll.tvenuiients, has no;
reference to Slates wherein loyal State tiov-:

proper to further say, that w hether mem-'

be admitted to seals constitutionally, res's
exclusively with the respective ll oise-i, and
not to ar.y extent with tho Exei irlive. '
And slill further, that this Proclamation j
is intended to prcsont the people of the!
States whet-in tho national antiioiily has j
been suspended, and loyal Slate tiovein-i
incuts have been subv:M'tod, a m le in and '
by which the national authority and loyal
Slate tiovei nnients may be te-establislied
within said Slates, or in any of them.
And, while '.lie mode presented is the
best the Executive can suggest with his
present impressions, it niu.-it not bo under
