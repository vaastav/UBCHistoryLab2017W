PRESIDENT FAVORS
SINGLE-HEAD RULE
Governor to Administer Over
District, He Proposes.
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
Approves Recommendations of Special
Commissioner Reynolds.
? ??
LABOR AND HOUSING BUREAU
Mr. Boosevelt Elaborates on Ideas of
Adviser Hegarding This Branch
of Government.
Supporting recommendations for change
in the form of administration for the
District of Columbia, made in the report
of James Bronson Reynolds of New York,
selected as special commissioner or adviser
to the President for the purpose of
devising a new form of government, Mr.
Roosevelt today sent a message to Congress.
Mr. Reynolds' recommendations, as
summarized by himself, are as follows:
1. The extension of the civil service to
cover all minor offices in the District of
Columbia.
2. The creation of the office of governor
at a salary of perhaps $10,000 per annum.
J. The creation of departments of health,
police, fire, building and public works,
street engineering, charities, corrections
and housing and labor. These departments
should be conducted by a commissioner
at a salary or" perhaps $3,000 per
annum.
4. A municipal council composed of the
above named commissioners should constitute
a public assembly for the passage
of ordinances regulating the affairs of
the District.
3. A citizens' committee of 100 to represent
all general civic interests.
The President's Message.
The President's message reads:
' To the Senate and House of Representati\
es:
The rapid Increase of population in
the National capital within recent years
has gw^MOim social conditions,
necessitating changes in the machinery of
its administration. Greater efficiency and
a better provision for the protection of
both the industrial and dependent classes
arc required.
"Recognizing these needs, I have had
a special report made to me on the affairs
of the District of Columbia which I transmit
^lerewith. I cordially approve the
recommendations in the report for:
"The substitution of a single head or
governor in place of three Commissioners.
"The establishment of District or municipal
departments in place of the existing
bureaus: and
"The creation of a new department to
be known as that of housing and labor.
"I ask your careful consideration of the
entire report; Mr. Reynolds has rendered
a great and disinterested service for
which our heartiest thanks are due him.
"A single executive head would increase
efficiency, determine responsibility and
eliminate delays and uncertainties in%
citable under the present system.
".Municipal* departments headed by
commissioners to be appointed by the
governor would yield the same advantage.

be o-ordinated with otla-r city departments.
Emphasis on Recommendations.
"I especially urge that the proposed department
of housing and labor be established.
Poverty, disease and crime are
largely duo to defects of social conditions
and surroundings. The need of improved
-unitary inspection of dwellings, rear alleys
and small shacks (such as unhappily
still exist in Washington) and of stores,
workshops and factories should not be left
to subordinate bureau chiefs, but should
be brought under the direct control of a
competent head of the above named department.
"An equally important public responsibility
is the protection of the independent
industrial class. which neither desires
nor accepts charity, but whose members
have often been led to misfortune and
ven crime through agencies licensed by
the state, but defectively and inadequately
supervised. Notable among these are
pawnshops, loan and industrial insurance
companies and employment agencies.
"The supervision of these agencies is at
p:. sent limited to the police. They should
1>?- under the direction of officials qualified
to advance their efficient y and economic
s? rv ice to t he public.
"The above named changes would vastly
improve the efficiency of The District government.
and would afford protection to
industrial and dependent < hisses which
is imperatively needed.
I :ilsn transmit for the consider:! t ion ?!

?
After more than a week of threat and |
talk the House of Representatives today
took action on a resolution, professedly of |
censure to the President, brought in by
the Perkins special committee appointed
for the purpose.
The resolution, as will be seen by a rare- j
ful perusal, is as mild as buttermilk, and. j
in the opinion of people around the Capitol \
who ought to know, fully as innocuous.
The only effect of the resolution is to j
call upon President Roosevelt for any in- I
formation he may have in support of his i
statement in his annual message of PJUS j
with respect to any unworthy motive j
which actuated members of Congress In ;
voting last year to adopt the legislative i
limitation contained in the sundry civil
bill upon the activities of the secret serv- j
ice. J
Here is the resolution as adopted by !
the House practically unanimously. Only ;
one member. Representative Paul Howland
of Ohio, voted in the negative.
Later Mr. Howland said he was in entire
sympathy with -the President and
believed he should have all the secret
service money he wanted.
The Besolution.
Following is the full text of the resolution,
together with the accompanying
preamble:
"Whereas there was contained in
the sundry civil appropriation bill,
which passed Congress at its last session
and became a law, a provision in
reference to the employment of the
secret service in the Treasury Depart- ?
ment. and
"Whereas in the last annual message w
of the President of the United States to
to the tw^ houses of Congress it was se
stated in reference to that provision:
'It is not too much to say that this rc'
nm^nflmont hou honti r\f Knnofit ?nlv
***? "'Vi ? Wl 1'V.IIVill ?
and could be of benefit only, to the ni
criminal classes,' and It was further tli
stated, 'the chief argument in favor
of the provision was that the congressmen
did not themselves wish to 5
be investigated by secret service men,' =
and it was further stated, 'but if this
is not considered desirable a special p
exception could be made, in the law,
prohibiting the use of Uig^jyjgret serv- .
ice force in investigating members of
Congress. It would be far better to
do this than to do what actually was ,
done, and strive to prevent or at least
to hamper effective action against
criminals by the executive branch of
the government"; and * of
"Whereas the plain meaning of the ^
aboye words is that the majority of *
the congressmen were in fear of being J,(
investigated by secret service men and
that Congress as a whole was actuated
by that motive in enacting the )e!
provision in question; and
"Whereas your committee appointed Ja
to consider these statements of the ju
President and report to the House cannot
find in the hearings before com- t)|
mlttecs nor in the records of the j.
House or Senate any justification of
tills impeachment of the honor and rc
integrity of the Congress; and p,
"Whereas your committee would pre- jjj
for, in order to make an intelligent j,
and comprehensive report, just to the
President as well as to the Congress,
to have all the information which the ai
President may have to communicate: jn
Therefore, be it er
"Resolved, That the President be re- , >j
quested to transmit to the House any ' le
evidence upon which he based his j
statement that the 'brief argument >.
in favor of the provision was that the K
congressmen did .not themselves wish
to be investigated by secret service
men." and also to transmit to the
House any evidence connecting any gi
member of the House of Represent- 1
atives of the Sixtieth Congress with j
corrupt action in his official capacity
and to inform the House whether lie
has instituted proceedings for the punishment
of any such individual l>y the T
courts or has reported any such alleged
delinquencies to the House of
Representatives."
Senate Example Not Followed.
It had been expected that, following
the lead of the Senate yesterday, the h]
House would bring in a resolution with j,
some ginger to it. either of language or rj
of suggested action. Hut the resolution
adopted todayy does not even lay on the
table that portion of the President's rues- 01
sage relating to the secret service, andjjr
which was so distasteful to members. js
There does not seem to be anything in u|
the message which can even simply be
* ~ ? ? 1 l->o *> > tn .. f V??? m t w It _
?"i ?nr*i i ijv(j ?i.*> in t in- miLuir vi nn m<i' u ?
talked-of. luii non-materialized rebuke. tl
After ISoprfsenliitlve Perking of N'fiv |
York, chairman of the special rebuking
eomniittee had offered the resolution and w
preamble published above, the only dis- ''
mission of interest that ensued was with 1,1
uspuet to that particular "whereas" reating
to the meaning of the President. l>
Representative .Bennett of New York w
thought the language of the preatnl.de
should make it plain that this was the 11
conclusion arrived at by the committee n
and not the House. He demanded a sep- Vl
urate vo <* on that paragraph.
When Speaker Cannon called for those s'
in favor of the adoption of this portion
of the preamble practically everbocty rose.
Mr. Bennett jumped up and tried to withdraw
his demand for a division, but Rep- i "
; resentative Macon of Arkansas. John i
J Sharp Williams of Mississippi and other, '
democrats protested. The standing vole | n
was continued. w
! o
Longworth Runs Away.
Representative Longworth of Oldo, tliei1'
President's son-in-law, wiio had been sit- Jj
ting in ids regular seat, not expecting ^
any call fur a division, was visibly cin- f\
barrassed at this point. He jumped from '
ids chair aiul left tne floor of tile House
iii a hurry, without voting.
Among those who voted against this n
i portion of tin* preamble were Represent- j,
ative Bennett of New York, Parsons of k
New York, Hepburn of Iowa, Hayes of
California, Dawes of Ohio, Ilowland of :l
, Ohio. Holland of Nebraska. Murdock of a
Kansas and Gaines of West Virginia.
Mr. Gaines was Just turn ml down by the j
President yesterday, too, in that Charles
Town coHvetorship rase. >
The resolution was then adopted with p
only one disfwnting vote. The vote on a
the preamble was 270 to 14.
Subcommittee May Conduct *
Secret Service Investigation
~ n
No time has definitely been iix?-d yet f<?r "

^jtee of the Senate to take action on that I p
" I portioii of the President's message dealing 1t

ith Congress and the secret service anil
prepare for investigation of the secret
rvice in accordance with the Aldrieh
solution, passed yesterday.
Tt is probable a meeting will be held toorrow
or Saturday |pr a discussion of
ie matter.
The impression prevails today that a
eliminary subcommittee, probably of
re senators, will be appointed and will
t during the Christmas holidays.
A recommendation for action on the
resident's message will doubtless be
ade shortly after Congress reconvenes
muary 4. It is not so certain when instigation
of the secret service will be
included.
Senator Hale of Maine, acting chairman
the appropriations committee w.ll
lubtless he chairman of the subcommite
if one is appointed. Senators Warren
Wyoming and Gallinger of New Humpilre
have been suggested as other relblican
members, and Senators Teller of
dorado and Tillman ol" South Carolina,
i the democrats.
Senator Galliiiger. however, expects to
ave about the first of the year for Now j
ampshlre to be present when the legisture
elects his successor. Mr. Galllnger
is no fear that he will not be chosen
succeed himself, but he wants to be on
e ground. This circumstance might
>ep him from serving.
The other members of the appropriations
immitteo are Senators Cullom of Illinois,
erkins of California. Klkhis of West Vlrlila
Hemenwav of Indiana, republicans;
aniel of Virginia, Clay of Georgia and
osier of Louisiana, democrats.
The investigation of the secret service,
ising as it lias out of the recent annual
essage of the President, will undoubtIIV
be completed before the 4th of
arch next, when Mr. Roosevelt will
ave the White House.

P
hauksgiving Day Incident as Told
by Instructress at Forest
Glen.
llow President Roosevelt severely rejked
a party of girls from the National
ark Seminary at Forest Glen, Aid., for
ding past liim Thanksgiving day in Roek
reek Park, and how lie caused the iiorse
le of the girls was riding to rear and
imp by striking it with his riding whip
told in a story which lias just leaked
it and been eonlirmed today by Atiss E.
Sisson, teacher in the school, who was
ie chaperon for the party.
Miss Sisson and three of the girls of the
istit utioii. whose names are withheld,
ent for a horseback ride through Roek
reek Park in the crisp air of Thanksgivig
morning. As they were Jogging along
ie of tiie tree-lined roads of the national
serve they saw a party ahead of them
hich included two ladies and two men.
s they closed up the gap between the
vo parlies APss Sisson says she rocogized
one of the men as President Rooseilt
"
For some time the seminary parly rode
owly behind the chief executive and his
arty. Rut the spirited animals wanted
? go faster, declares Miss Sisson. and
nall> the girls galloped past the preslcnlial
party.
When they slowed their horses down
Sain a few minutes later they heard
ipid Uonfbeats behind them. The rider
;as pressing his horse hard and lie soon
vertook them.
"As we were riding f?>nr abreast at the
fine, the President's horse crowded 11s
<> iiitie as lie dashed past," said Miss
isson. continuing Hie narrative. "As
e brushed past his horse struck the
jo* of,one of the young ladies, knocking
from the stirrup, and a. blow from the
'resident's crop fell on the horse's llank.
'he young woman's horse .reared, and
ut for her coolness and admirable horselanship
she might have been thrown
eneath the feet of the'horses. I do not
now whether the blow was intentional.
" 'Vou know that you should not go
head of our party," said the President
s he rode past us and turned in the
addle to look us squarely in the face.
I" then joined his companions.
"Naturally, we felt very much mortified,
lone of us intended an affront to the
'resident, and 1 cannot understand his
etion.
"The President appeared to be in a
age, but, of course, I do not know about
hat. I only know how we felt about it.
"I prefer not to give the names of the
oung ladies In the party. They are
auchters of wealthy parents, highly ooneeied,
and I am sure their parents would
bjcot to the notoriety attending such an
ITair."
The story was told about the seminary

people in Washington.

TION ON MARINE ORDER.
Asks by What Authority Men Were
Detached From Battleships?Referred
to Naval Committee.
1
' Tt Senator Rayner of Maryland lias his
way the Senate will find out by what
authority the President issued an order
a short while ago detaching the Marine
Corps from service on the battleships and
the order yesterday declaring that the
officers of the corps submit to tests
similar to those prescribed by him for
army officers. If the Senate shall decide
that Congress has the power to
promulgate rules governing the Marine
Corps that shall lie binding upon the
President lie wants such a set of rules
adopted.
His intention to push the matter was
evidfnt today by his introduction of a
resolution 011 the subject calling upon
the military affairs committee to investigate
it. At first lie asked that the resolution
be referred to the committee on
military affairs, but on the suggestion of
Senator llale. chairman of the naval
I committee, and with the consent of Sent
ator Warren, chairman of the military
I committee, the resolution was referred to
[ the naval committee.
Mr. Rayner"s resolution is as follows:
"Whereas the President of the United
i States has lately promulgated a series of
| orders in connection with the Marine
' Corps, detaching them from the battleI
ships, and requiring them to perform eer1
lain tests, as fully set forth in such
I order:
"Now be ii resolved. That the committee
i on military affairs is hereby instructed to
! inquire and report," first, whether the
1 President under existing statutes has the
authority to issue these orders; second,
; whether If he has such an authority the
: execution of these orders would not impair
the efficiency of the marine service,
instead of advancing it. and whether the
service would not thereby be diverted
from the purpose for which it was intended
bv law: third, whether Congress lias not
the rieht to prescribe a set of rules and
I regulations for the, government of the
Marine Corps which will bind the President
as commander-in-chief of the army
an<l navy of the l.'nited States, and if so.
to report a set of rules for the government
of the Marine Corps to effect the
purpose for which said corps was organized
and to promote its usefulness."
It was very evident that the resolution
interested Senator lla'.c greatly, lie took
special pains to call Mr. Warren's attention
to it and suggest that it go to
the naval committee.
Mr. Rayncr said Ik- did not have any
objection to referring it to the naval
committee, but be failed to change the
resolution so as to instruct toe naval
committee to conduct the inquiry.
"The President has taken the marines
off the battleships," declared Mr. Rayner,
"and turned them into policemen, Janitors,
or what not. and I inferred that
he intended to disconnect them with thes
navy. That is the reason that 1 suggested
that the military affairs committee
take up the matter."

Greeks, Armenjans and Bulgars represented
the Christian nationalities. Members
from Jerusalem and Mecca rubbed
shoulders with their colleagues from the
European provinces and the far-off Kurdish.
Armenian and Arab districts on the ;
confines of the Indian ocean.
So far as can be judced from surface
indications, the new parliament lias entered
upon its duties with a united determination
to carry out successfully the
aims of the bloodless revolution which
made possible the inauguration of a constitutional

The sultan left Yildiz Palace in a state lli
coach at 11:.*50 o'clock to drive to the w
building: adjoining the ministry of justice ^
and facing tl|c great square of St. Sofia,
where the new chamber convened. He 1,1
was accompanied by the first secretary of S!i3
the imperial chancellery, Ali Bjevad Bey,
and a larg number of aids and at- a*
lendants.
The entire line of march of Hie im- i
perial party, a distance of five miles, had
been swept and spread with fresh sand ti>
for the passage of his majesty. These 01
are the same preparations made every
time the sultan leaves Yildiz Palace, and j
particularly when he attends the Selam- j
lik. Every regiment in Constantinople ' p,
was out under arms and lined up along j p]
the route of the procession to guard the f
progress of the sultan. Triumphal arches ^
spanned the streets, and as the occasion
had been made a public holiday the city Sl
was crowded with people. Thousands ti
came in from surrounding towns and villages.
as well as from more remote parts ti<
of the empire, and almost the entire local A
population turned out to witness the ceremonies.
Foreign Diplomats Attend. j m
All the ministers of state, senators j JJ'
