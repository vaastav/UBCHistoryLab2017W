and othei deputations from Dublin were on
the pier to receive him. Dr. Fitzgerald, Mr.
I-eamy, Henry Harrington and Edw.ird
Harrington were the first members of Par

the same boat. As they came ailu.re they
were subjected to hostile demonstrations by
the crowd, while theie were shouts for
Parnell, mingled with cheers for Mrs.
O'Suea.
Parnell was the last to leave the boat.
As lie proceeded to the train the crowd be
came enthusiastic in its demonstrations, and
he was cheered again and again.
A number of addresses were presented to
birn, in reply to which he expressed his
thanks for the welcome. He said ho did
rot fear the result of the fight. He never
lfd the Irish party wring in the past and lie
would not in the future.
PBEBEBTES WITH AN ADDRESS.
The Town Clerk at Kingstown presented
-P»tne!l with an address expressing admira
tion cf his "resolute resistance of the inso
lent dictation of Gladstone," and assuring
him of support lv his "noble work." The
address contained this declaration: "The
people will not accept any home-rule scheme
not giving the people full control of Uie po
lice and the piAv ( r to settle the land ques
tion."
In a speech Parnell said he was confident,
with the youth of Ireland on his side, he
would win. The l'arncll Leadership Com
mittee presented Parnell with an address,
eniphasizirg in the strongest manner their
condemnation of " the miserable and con
temptible position" the seceders Had as
sumed.
GROANS FOR" UE ALT.
The train then pulled out ana after a short
run arrived in Dublin, where a large crowd
assembled. As soon as the train stopped
Timothy Healy hurriedly descended from
the coach, entered a cab and drove away.
He was recogniz-'d by the crowd, however,
before he reached the cab, and was greeted
with groans and sUouts of "'Chief Justice
Healy."
The crowd was so dense that rarnell witti
difficulty made his way throueh. He finally
reached a cab and entered it with Joseph
Kenny. The crowd surrounded the cab,
unharnessed the horse and drew him through
tbe streets until they reached Kenny's
house. As the cab rolled along the streets
the crowd followed singing " God Save Ire
land." The pace was quick and cave active
exercise to the dozen stalwart policemen
who followed. Upon his arrival at Ken
ny's house Parnell made a brief speech to
the crowd.
I'urnell received a telegram stating that
the workmen of Kilkenny would snjjport
him.
Healy, on three occasions was hooted in the
street to-day. Last night he tried to address
the people, when the crowd made a rush for
him, hustling him around and smashing hU
hat. Some arrests were made.
A OIIEAT PARXELI.ITE Mr.KTING.
This evening a great procession was
formed at the Mansion House, and when
Parnell reached his carriage tiie horses were
uniiitched and a score of enthusiastic men
drageed the carriage to the Kutunda. rar
nell received an ovation all along the route,
an clat tin- Botnnda he experienced the an ;it
estdifheulty in getting into the hall, wiii:h
which was packed tosufficati n. Theclner
ing when he reached the platform continued
several minutes, afler which a vute of confi
dence in Parnell was passed.
In his si eech he said: "I have bei>n :•<;
cused of absence from the field of brittle. It
is easy to make excuses lor sece^ion and
defection, but when the day comes for
nieaßuiing the amount of my shortcomings
and those of my opponents, the ba'ance will
not be ag.iinst me." [Snouts of "Down with
tbe renegades."]
CONFRONTED WITII MI'TINT.
"I did not plead sickness, though God
knows it was not the timp, when I was
crippled in health and strength, to confront
me with a moveineut of mutiny, stronger,
ui'.re vindictive, disgraceful and cowardly
[cries of "He ily"j tlia i ever a commander
Jn-chief was called upon to face. Ah yes,
they chought I »;u dead and that they
mi^ht play around my corpse and divert the
Iri-li nation from the true issues. Now I
suppose this is a great crisis. Who made
it? Is it you, or who? [Voices, "Old Glad
stone, the hypocrite."] We shall see sune
day who did this deadly thing against our
race. We shall know' where to affix the
itaiu they sought to attach to me.
AXXIOUS FOR TRIAL.
"I was anxious to assume this trial, to
give Ireland breathing time, to postpone the
terrible issue. Why was I refused an op
portunity? Why did Gladstone wait nine
days after the verdict and allow the Lein
eter meeting betore hinting that my reten
tion was dangerous. Had he but whiskered
that my retirement was necessary 1
should have hastened to consult my
comrades and rescue them from the
impossible position in which they placed
themselves. By the Leinster resolution, we
•re here U>-day to say to Gladstone, We
respect you in your position ; we acknowl
edge your immortality, and the strength and
power exhibited by you on so many diverse
and great battle-fields, but no decline to
fuse with you; we. decline to surrender to
you our independence, which has produced
In you the frame of mind in which you are
to-day, and which, please Gcd, will continue
till it has produced ill" fruition of our hopes.
JRKLA.ND'S MESSAGE TO GLADSTONE.
"The message that Ireland sends to the
Grand Old Man is this: Kesume your place
as leader of your party, bacK up your legiti
mate authority, and when you have put
yourself in the position of an independent
leader such as ouis, then, nnd not until
then, will we allow our leader to treat with
you upon those equal terms, which alone
can its M.iv a lasting and permanent settle
ment." [Great cheering.]
Parnell's defense.
Farnell said if the movement against him
vrasearnesthtt would yield to it immediately.
"But," he said," "it is a movement of
hypocrisy by a man whose In me rule was
skin deep, but whose haired of Inland was
not skin deep. The main features of the
movement are an aberration of judgment
and invincible ignorance. I ne.d not dwell
on my defenne, it will oe known some day.
[Prolonged cheering and waving of hats.] I
could not come aim ng you to-night unless I
know there was another side to the ques
tion, and that you would be content to wait
before deciding that I am too unworthy to
walk with you in tight of the promised land,
which, please God, I will enter with you."
[Ciioßof "Parnell forever."]
OVERFLOW MEETINGS.
Parnell referred to the offers of office to
Irish members, and said the pledge not to
accept office from the English Government
is a trail of Irish character. They must
stand to it if they are Co succeed. He said
he had not promised them absolute success,
but repeated that Ireland can win upon no
other line. "It Ireland leaves this port to
which 1 have led her, almost in sight of
victory, 1 will not, for my part, say what
will accompany her future. My position is
that of IHBO, and 1 say to all Irishmen, be
ware, whiie the power is still in your hwnds,
ijefore yon surrender forever to forces
which you cannot control the illimitable
power of our rage."
Farnell also addressed two overflow meet-
The Morning Call.
ings, and, at the conclusion of hij speeches,
proceeded to the National Club, whera he
held a reception.
A JJEWSPArER SEIZED BY rARNEIX.
The newspaper United Ireland got into
trouble through its persistent advocacy of
the retirement of Parnell, who is one of the
Directors ol the company owning the paper.
Acting in that capacity, ParneU tc-<lay
seized the paper, stopped the issue of the
current edition and ejected the acting editor.
Bodkin. Paniell's agent took possession of
the paper.
When Bodkin entered the offke he found
Parnell in possession. Parnell, in the pres
ence of three Directors, read the articles of
association under which the compitnv was
organized, and then ordered the Sheriff to
eject Bodkin. The latter made an ineffec
tual resistance.
A desperate row occurred in the down
stairs office between the Sheriff's officers
and the sub-editors. Sticks and stools were
used anti tbe air was filled with Hying mis
sies. Jrinally, after a sharp, lierce struggle,
vie sub-editors were nut out of the building.
Ihe news of the seizure created great ex
citement aud a mob surrounded the office.
TO BE SIED FOR ASSAULT.
Parnell later addressed the staff, the mem
bers of which promised to serve him during
the remainder of the crisis.
Parnell placed Leamy in charge of the
paper.
Timothy Healy was at the office of the
.National League when the payer was
seized.
Pam-ll owns 474 of the 500 shares of ca
pital stock of the company, nnd Dr. Joseph
t. Kenny and Justin McCarthy the remain
der. The editors who were ejected will sue
Parnell for assault
liodkin, in an interview subsequent to his
removal, said the edition of the purer which
Parnell destroyed contained ninny resola
ti n* adopted by provincial branches of the
National League opposing Parnell. Also, a
cable dispatch from O'Brien saying: "Abide
by my instructions. Insist moderately, hut
firmly, uioii Parnell's retirement as a sine
qua uou."
THK PAPBB RECAPTURED.
Late to-night a strong party of Parnell's
opponents made a descent upon and re
captured the edict sof United lrel.md. The
invaders destroyed nil the " leaders," which
had been prepared by Leamy, and turned
all the matter they fouuo s.-t up into the tire.
I hen they took possession of the leiig.-rs
and other books and documents belonging to
the concern. All this was done in the name
of William O'Brien.
A. strong posse from various laborers'
societies was left as a garrison, with in
stiuciions to remain on guard da; and night
and resist by f i rce any luitiier intrusion by
Parnell and his friends.
A MANIFESTO.
London, Dec. 10.— Theanti-Parnell mem
bers of tl.e Irish Parliamentary ratty have
issued a manifesto to the Irish* people. In
this they say, in part: "Piirnell, disregard
ing our appeals to remember the country,
evincedan iil-jiidgrd determination to main
tain his untenable position, t! us threatening
to plunge Ireland into a conflict which may
overwhelm her and cause her present fair
prospects to disappear forever. It is the
outy of Irishmen now, irrespective of all
consideration of feelings, either for Painell
or these differing from Dim, to adopt a course
that «ill tend to save Ireland lrom destruc
tion."
CHARGES AGAINST PAKXEI.L.
The signers enumerate at length the rea
sons for their action. They .specify the
charges against Parnell as follows : "First,
he sneaks as if he was the injured party,
whereas he alone is responsible for the
present deplorable situation.
"Second, he pledged liimself to repel the
charges in connection with the O'Slieu case,
but when the time came he remained
silent.
"Third, he does not hesitate to renounce
and denounce the multitude of English
friends of Irish liberty as ' English wolves.'
«_ Fourth the ' English wolves' aud Irish
I3i>hops express the same opinion of Par
neil, ai,d he cannot mend matters by calling
nickname*. If ParneU is re-elected the
Tory Government will resume its power, co
ercion receive a new lease and the struggle
for h.nie rule will be lost to the living neu
eratiou."
TIIKY IIEFISE TO ABANDON GLADSTONE.
The fuiiil (inestiou for the Irish nation is:
Lose all for Parnell or win all without him.
The signers refuse tv abandon Gladstone
for Parnell or to insist on the Literal leader
revealina^iis plans for home rule, which
action, Tfiey say, would be foolish
to give an advantage to Ireland's foes.
They refuse to beliuve Gladstone desired
to dictate. He was bsuud to pub.ish
his conviction that the retention of
Parnell in the leadership would wreck
home rule. The signers otfnrcd P..r
nell an opportunity of temporary re
tirement, wish a view to his eventual re
instatement, but it never cave the faintest
chance of a settlement His fatal manife-to
was an appeal to the hatred between the
peoples of Grout Uritain and Ireland, and
makes it Impossible for him hereafter to co
operate with the Liberal party.
PAKHBIX DSSEBTXD THEM.
The signers ni-ver deserlcd Parnell, but
he th<*m, and the honor of lieland is s;ife
in their hands tlnough good or evil fortune.
The signers pledge themselves to remain an
independent party, thus insuring final vic
tory for the Irish cause under the auspices
of the alliance of the British Democracy
and Irish people.

UTAH INDUSTRIAL HOME.
Beport of the Comm siion on the Progresi cf
the Institution.
Dee. 10.— The report by the
Utah Commission regarding the Ut&h In
dustrial Home, which was established by
the Edmunds law as an asylum for Mormon
apostate women, has been presented to
the Senate. The number of inmates is
only twenty-eight The commission at
tributes the small number partly to "female
pride" ami partly to the restraining influ
ence of the Mormon Church. The commis
sion believes, however, that the establish
ment of the institution has not been unpro
ductive of good results. The managers of
the Indn.-trial Home ask Congress for an
appropriation to buy sowing machine?.
They think the latter will prove to be seduc
tive influences, aud the commission lmpes
the Industrial Home will do better In the
future and tbat they will be successful in
persuading many old Mormon women to
enter it.
The report recommends th-it some dis
cretion be given the commission iv the
matter of admission ot beneficiaries and
that they be permitted to pay their trans
portation exjK'nses from different parts of
tbe Territory to the home, by whicn means
they would secure a larger number of in
mates. Kegarding the success of the under
taking the report sta'.es that the completion
of the home building is so recent that the
association has not yet had a fair oppor
tunity to demonstrate its success.

law. The old law is so wretchedly ineffi
cient that according to the testimony of the
Labor Inspectors themselves L'o per cent of
the Immigration now coming to this country
is in violation of the eontiact-laber law.
That statute was framed to meet the condi
tion of things that existed at the time the
law was pascrd. Employers have changed
their methods, and the law ii unable to
reach them. It i-j pi acliciniy useless, so we
hi.ye framed a new law. We have al^o very
much enlarged the inhibited ehisves of im
migrants." The bill is substantially that
introduced a week nuo by Owen, and here
tofore published. Polygantoua persons are
added to the li.-t of classes defined in Owen's

the six months Iron January to June, ISB9,
intervening between the close of the former
fiscal ye«r. The report gives in detail a
reco:d of the amalgamations during the
year and says the result to iho company
has proven satisfactory in every respect,
and the completion of the plans now in
progress lookiug to the same end will
demonstrate the wisdom of the policy out
lined. The large expenditures are explained
on the ground of briucinc; up the road-beds
and tracks of acquired lines to the proper
standard, etc. Since August, 1880, traffic on
all Uie lines has been heavy, and it has been
found necessary to make provision lor a
large amount of additional equipment, etc.

sources of revenue during the fiscal year
satisfactory returns are shown, notably
from traffic, from which the best results
were obtained, the figures showing an in
crease over the previous twelve mouths of
83,818,178. The decrease of revenue from
paasrngci traffic of $689,960, and express of
5113.M8, arose wholly from the reaction in
the Southern California boom, which was
felt most during the fiscal year, the Califor
nia division alone showing 527'2.G(J6 and the
Atlantic and Pacific road 8232,3'JJ less pas
senger earnings, and B*oso and 520,(J22 re

"1 lielieve the October earnings are the

many months. They tell us from Omaha
that November should show an improve
ment. Ifell sure December will coutinue
the Improvement But I have been so much
disappointed in monthly returns that 1 do
nnt like to prophesy. The Trustees have
canceled during the year 57,3ti7,000 of bonds,
reducing the aunual fixed charges by nearly
S("|OO,(iOO. But only half of mis reduction
will show in this year's report. This leaves
outt.tandins onIy"SO,G3C,OOO of these 8 per
cent bonds, and at maturity, in September,

sue, and when all the land mites are paid
there will be a balunce from land assets to

D3XOH PACIFIC PASSENGER TRAINS.
Pouti.ani) (Or.), Dec. 10.— Tuere is a
probability that the Union Pacific will re
place tiains Nos. 7 and 8. which were taken

that two passenger trams per day will arrive
aud leave here as formerly. The fast mail
is unable to accommodate the travel, and
No. 1, west bound, is not able to haul all the

As this is very lit le advantage over the

schedule will be revived.

A Word About Catarrh.
"It Is the in ;i ■•■.'■. membrane, that wonderful
semi-fluid envelope surrounding the delicate tis
sues of the air and food passages, that Catarrb
makes Its stronghold. Once established, It eats Into
the very vitals, and renders life but a long-drawn
breath of misery aud disease, dulling the sens© of
bearing, trammeling the power of speech, destroy
ing the faculty of smell, tainting the breath, and
killing the refined pleasures of taste. Insidiously,
by creeping on from a simple cold in the b ead, it as
saults the membranous lining and envelopes tha
bones, eating through the delicate coats and causing
inflammation, sloughing and death. Nothing short
of total eradication will secure health to the patient,
and all alleviatlves are simply procrastinated suffer
ings, leading to a fatal termination. Sanpord's
Radical CI'UE, by Ihftnftifftwi aud by M/frnaiadmla
istration, has never failed: even wben the diseased
made frightrul hiroads on delicate constitutions,
hearing, sincil and taste have been recovered, auti
the disease thoroughly driven out."
Sanforu's Radical Citrk consists of one bottle
ortheKADicAL.t*UKK, one box Catarrh ai. Soi.vkst
and one Imi'roved Inhai.kr, neatly wrapped inoua
package, with full directions; price, $1.00.
