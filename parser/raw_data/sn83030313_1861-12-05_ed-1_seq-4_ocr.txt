the situation.
' or "?veral (lays past scoHting parties from the
li visions of Generals Porter, Smith and ITancock
Lave been searching the country on the Virginia
wile of the Potomac in the direc tion of Vienna and
Hunter's Mills, without finding any force of the
enemy in that region.
A smart engagement Is said to have occurred on
Monday, about five miles above Newport News,
between the United .States gunboat? Hefzel, Scy
Biour, Whitehead and Shawnee ond the rebel
"W arner Patrick Henry. The fight lasted for two
tours, but as the rebel vessel kept pretty well out
of range of the gunboats, aud was protected bv a
baitery on shore, she suffered no damage, as far as
can be ascertained.
We are in possession of some more rebel ac
counts of rumored conflict on the Southern const.
^ ith regard to the reported attack on Fort Pu
iMki the Savannah R^Hican of the 28th ultimo
*ays that the cannonading of the fleet was dia
I. nelly heard on the day previous, and that Com
modore Tatnall, with his little rebel squadron, had
Arrived at Savannah quite disabled; but as the
United States transport McClelland, which has re
cently arrived here, left Tybee Island on the same
date as the publication of the Savannah paper,
and brings no report of an attack on Fort Pu
laski, it is very probable that the firing alluded to
was paused by the engagement between TntnaU's
Mosquito fleet and our gunboats. From
the same Southern source we are informed
that Nassau, on the Georgia coast, had been taken
possession of by the Union army, ru.?l a I,rge
amount of unhulled rice and uninjured cotton had
fallen a prey to them. The planters are destroy
ing their cotton as fast as possible, when unable to
carry it into the interior. Bands of Union men
were forming in the mountains, and a negro insnr
rection was deemed probable and immincut. The
wealthy families of Savannah were flying to Maeon
and Atlanta, as they have been led to believe that
"dishonor, if not death, awaits every female that
may remain, should the city be captured." Jt i*
also stated that the Georgia troops at Richmond
and Petersburg had formally demanded to be sent
home by the government.
General IWcians and his staff arrived at
Wheeling yesterday to take up their winter qunr
ters. The General has been offered his choice of
several rebel residences for his winter home. It is
probable that the campaign in Western Virginia Is
therefore at an end for the present.
The Legislature of Maryland organized yeeter
day and received the Governor's Message, In which
he declared strongly for the Union; says that re
bolllon must be put down, and that Maryland must
bear her share in the good work at whatever cost.
He also recommends summary punishment upon
rebels within the State.
1 be City of Baltimore brings some very im
portant details of her own telegraphic report*
concerning American affairs in Europo to the
21st ult.
The allied treaty against Mexico provides that
England, France and Spain shall "seize" all the
fortresses and military positions on the Gulf coast
of the republic. The London Times sees in the
Mexican expedition a turning of the tide from the
doctrine of "manifest destiny" which has ho long
prevailed on this side, and argues that the United
States cannot but view the presence of European
troops on the continent of North America with
feelings of mortification and distrust
In an editorial on the great naval expedition to
the rebel States, the London Times regards it
rather as an expedient of the Cabinet to satisfy the
people than a scheme devised by miliary genius
In the same article the 7YrnCg says that "by dis
missing General Fremont the government repudi
ates the designs attributed to it by its Mends , n
the other side of the Atlantic. Mr. l,inoo)n rc.
mains truo to his promises aud to the American
constitution, and both these bind him to support
the slave laws with which General Fromout would
ventnre to tamper."
Mr. Bercsford Hope, M. P., in ? lecture at
Faversham on the war In America, contended and
said ho knew the majority of thinking men agreed
with him, though they did not say it, that the best
and readiest method toward* restoring peaoe
would be for the European Powerato recognise
tho independence of the South at once.
CONGBEB8.
In the Senate yosterday, a resolution expelling
John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, now an officer
in the rebol army, was offered, but objected to by
Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, on the ground that as
Breckinridge had already resigned he could not be
expelled. The resolution, however, was adopted
by a vote of yeas 36, nays none. The staling
committees were then announced. H>?.y arc
ly the samo as at the last session. Mr. Hale sub
mitted a resolution, which lies over, di
recting the Judiciary Committee to Inquire
into tho expediency of abolishing present
Supreme Court, and organizing another Supremo
Court which will meet the requirements of tho
constitution. Mr. Wilson introduced a resolution
providing for tho rolease of slaves confined in
prison in Washington. The subject was referred
to the Committee on District of Columbia A flairs.
On motion of Mr. Wilson, tho same committee were
directed to consider the question of abolishing
slavery in the District of Columbia, allow ing ;w
peasation to loyal owners of slaves. Mi. -
bury, of Delaware, proposed the appointrnen <>
commission, consisting of Millard 1- illmore, t lank
liu Pierce, Roger B. Taney, Edward Everett
George M. Dallas, Thomas M. Ewmg, Horace
Binney, Reverdy Johuson, John J. Crittenden
aud George C. Pngh, to confer with a like number
of commissioners from tho so-called Confederate
States, with a view to the restoration ot peace, the
preservation of the Union, and tho maintenance of
the constitution, and that during the pendency or
the deliberations of the joint commissioners active
hostilities shall cease. This proposition wag
promptly laid on the table. The Secretary of War
was, ou motion of Mr.Snmner, requested to furnish
copies of General Halleck's orders to the army in
Missouri referring to fugitive slaves. Mr. McDou
gall introduced a bill providing for a line ot mail
steamers between San Framisco and ShangUae,
touching at the Sandwich Islands and Japan.
In tho House the negro question occupied a large
portion of the session. Mr. Guvley gave notice of
a bill to confiscate and declare free the slaves o
rebels, also providing for their apprenticeship to
loyal masters and subsequent colonization. Mr.
Hutchins, of Ohio, offered a resolution directing
inquiry as to what shall be done with forty-live
slaves now in prison at Washington, and to prevent
slaves from being similarly imprisoned lnreaftor.
Mr. Dunn, of Indiana introduced a resolution in
structing the Committee on Foreign AlVairs to
inqnir. as to the practicability and expediency of
acquiring, in a "congenial clime" on any part of
this continent, or on the adjacent islands south of
the United States, a right to colonize and
protect free negroes who may emigrate
thereto. The resolution was adopted. Mr.
Hutchins, of Ohio, asked leave to Intro
auce a bill to abolish slavery in the District oi
Columbia, but objection was made by Mr. Cox of
Ohio. A resolution was adopted calling on the
President for information respecting tho interven
tion of France, England and Spain in the affairs of
Mexico. A resolution requesting the President to
adopt measures for an exchange of prisoners of
war was referred to tho Judiciary Committee. Mr.
Holman, of Indiana, introduced a preamble and
resolutions reaffirming the Crittenden declaration
as to the cause and object of the war, which, on
motion of Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, were bud
on the tabic, by a vote or 71 against 03. A bill
was introduced providing for the restoration ol
Alexandria county, Virginia, to the District ot
Columbia. Tlio Secretary of Wur was requested
to report wlut measures have been or ought to
be taken to expose and punish Major Lynde and
other army officers who may be guilty of treason
or cowardice in surrendering a larger and mperior
force of United States soldiers to Texan troops, so
that those who are innocent may be relieved from
blame, Ac. The Military Committee were inntructcd
to report what 'change, if any, is necessary to be
made in the mode of payment of soldiers held
as prisoners of war. The Homestead bill was in
troduced, and referred to the Committeo oil Public
Lands. The Contract Investigating Committee
were allowed to sit during the sessions of the
House and report, from time to time. The nana
extra number cf copies of ihe President a Mi's.?ig
and the accompanying documents was ordered to
be printed.
MISCELLANEOUS NEWS.
The City of Baltimore urrived att'iis port ye-tcr.
day evening from Liverpool and Qneenstown, w ith
Eropesn files of the 2 1st ultimo. Her ijcwh was
anticipated by Her own telegraphic report from
St. Johns, N. F., published in the Hf.k.u.ti of Ir.st
Saturday. The papers contain some interesting
details, which urn given this morning.
It i? said tliat tlie piojeet of tho new Italian
confederation proposes a Northern kingdom, with
Victor Emanuel at its h?a<!: a Papal State,
including Umhria and tho Marchcs, and
a Neapolitan kingdom under Francis II.
Venice would be given to the Northr*n
kingdom. Tin-, great obstacle to the realization of
this plan is Baron Rirasoli; but every kiud of in
trigue was at work to displace him. The financial
condition of France was (-till very precarious, and
M. Fould wan exercising all his ingenuity in order
to lay the basis of u now budget. The London
Times says Napoleon must soon disarm or else
"send his armies to feed over Europe;"' and the
London Post remarks;? "The financial war wi.ich
we have waged with France is at an end, and the
victory inconte?tably is ours. In preparations ns
in battles, in finances a;' well as in hostilities, it is
the weaker Power which breaks down."
The stcanndiip Northern Light or rived at this
port yesterday from Aspinwall, with the Pacific
mails and tsTO/iKJ in trea.-ure from San Francisco.
By the arrival of the steamship Northern Light
we have lute and interesting news from Central
America and the South Pacific. The Dutch fleet
were about to proceed to Laguayra to demand
satisfaction from the Venezuelan government for
an insult to the Dntch flag. Moaquera had banished
the Archbishop of Bogota, Momignor Herran,
brother of Mosipiera's envoy to Washington. A
most frightful butchery was rec-ntly committed in
Bolivia by order of Colonel Yantz. The details
aro very disgusting. The indigo crop throughout
the country wis very successful. Croat exertions
were being made t? extend the cultivation of cot
ton in Peru. Tho health of ull the various repub
lics is said to be excellent.
Captain Wilkes, the gallant commander of Ihe Snn
Jacinto, is to be formally received by the Mayor
and Common Council of this city, in the Gover
nor's Itoom, at tho City Hall, at eleven o'clock this
morning. After the reception is over Captain
Wilkes will be pleased to receive those of our citi
zens who may wish to see him, when, no doubt
many will avail them-dvys of tho opportunity.
A military reeonnoissanee of tho country be
tween Rolla and the Gasconade was made on the
2Sth nit. by Majur Thorn, of General Halleck's
staff, and tho Topographical Engineers. The fol
lowing officers also accompanied the expedition,
via:? General Asboth nnd staflf, General Wynian
and staff, Acting Brigadier General Opteriiaus, Act
ing Brigadier General Albeit, Colonel Dodge,
Colonol KuobelsdofT and Major Warring. The
party was escorted by Major Wright and three
I companies of cavalry.
[ General J. W, Webb, the United States Minister
to Brasfl, hag notified all concerned that If any
American vessel, arrived la Brazil, shall hoist the
Confederate flag, he will remove the master and
send the vessel home.
An advertisement appears in the Hamilton (C.
W.) Time* calling for one hundred "healthy
j ncgroos" to enter the service of the Australian
Cotton Association, in Now South Wales and Queens
land. Passage paid and ?21 ($84) per aunam, with
rations, are the inducements, aud it is promised
that the negroes will be "treated by the Australian
Cotton Association precisely in the same manner
that white servants are, all being alike free sub
jects of our enlightened government."
Tho notorious body guurd in Missouri has been
disbanded by order of General Halleck. The Gene
ral does not appear to believe in such body guards.
Tho commission appointed to coustruct a new
city charter met in the oTtmbcr of the Board of
Conncilmcn yesterday. On calling the roll, but
eight members answered to their names. The
meeting then adjourned, subject to the cull of tho
Chair.

Leavitt's auction rooms, opened well. The buyers
wen- principally men of tho trade, and the invoices
sold at fair prices, the bidding being spirited.
I.ipplneott's bool :i sold readily, and were at times
duplicated. Th military works reached tho ordi
nary good trade t-ale mark, but were held stifliy by
tho publishers at any lower rate than the duplicat

fair prict s, and portions of the invoice were freely
duplicated. The sale commences to-day with
Hazard'1! lint from Philadelphia, followed by Shel

pages, and consists mainly of holiday books, und
Towuscnd's iuvoicc of prenontation books com"
plctes to-day's Bale.
The Grand Jury of the General Sessions was

without marked change, was nevertheless more
favorable to the drovers than for some timo past.
The range of price was not so wide, ami while

The Prrsttlcnl'rt and the Sufnikic
Abolition Rlcmtul In Congceti,
Tin' M.vsta^M <>t" President Linroiu, from It?
conservative and national character, is ap
proved and i udorsed by nine-tenths of the peo
ple of the loyal States. If it could he read by
the people oi the aeced'd States also, we believe
that it would be mo3frcordiully received by the
masses, and that before ii* calm, steady, bene
ficent light the errors with which Recession
conspirators have deluded th" people would
vanish like clouds before the mn.
Next to its conservatism, the most, striking
characteristic of the Message is the pure, simple
style in which its great ideas are expressed. Its
language is the strong, sinewy Anglo-Saxon of
the age of Sbakspere and Milton. The ornate
fopperies of word, phrase and metaphor with
which the English language has since been adul
terated are entirely discarded. Like Talley
rand, our politician ; have used words only to
conceal ideas, aiul of late words seem to have
multiplied and ideas decreased in cxact propor
tion, until a politician's speech or a President's
Message has become an apt simile for nothing
ness long drawn out. President Lincoln has re
versed this custom. He has great things to say,
and his Idea* shine clearly through his pers
picuous style to be known, read and admired
of all men. The utterances of Epaminoudas,
Phociori and Pelopidus among the ancient
Greeks, or of llegulns and Scipio Africanus
among the ancient Romans, p re the models
of the terse brevity of the Message, and its
English is that of our best elates, as simple,
forcible and unpretending us that of tho Eng
lish version of the Dible. If the name of George
Washington, instead of that of Abraham Lin
coln, had been signed to this Message, there
\tould have been as little alteration in its stylo
as in its sentiments.
This conservative Me. ^age of President Lin
coln, full ot great national ideas simply and
weightily expressed, will find but little favor,
however, with the Satanic abolition clement, in
Congre-s and out of it. Under the lead of such
revolutionary fanatics as Sumner and Wade
in the Senate, and Lovejoy and Stevens in
! the House, the abolition:- te will attack it most
vehemently. Its conservnti. iu is as fatal a blow
to them as it is to the rebel chiefs. A radical
abolition niej-'ige would have strengthened
tho hands of Sumner and Jetf. Davis alike, and
so these coluborers for disunion will endeavor,
by every possible means, to weaken the effect
and misrepresent the policy of President Lin"
coin's admirable Slate paper. The rebel enemy
in front may be safely left to the care of Gene
ral McClcllan and Commodore Dupont, but the
President himself must attend to the abolition
enemy iu the rear.
Tho President has, thus far, held the aboli
tionists firmly in check, and the loyal people
have applauded and endorsed his conservative,
constitutional course. Confident that he will
ultimately subdue the disunionists, North r.nd
South alilce, let us watch and wait. What the
next movement of the abolition array in Con
gress will be we can predict with no more cer
tainty than we can foretell the next movement
of Jeff. Davis' army; but wo can say, safely,
tlmt it will bo defeated. Let the abolitionists
beware. The declaration of the President's
Message, that "the Union must be preserved'
ond hence all indispensable means must be em.
ployed," applies as well to the abolitionists
as to the rebels. If it shall bo found "indis
pensable" to the preservation of the Union to
treat abolitionists to the prison fare which
otlier relic' sympathizers have received, tlio
President will ?*tainly uso this "means," and
the country will heartily applaud the act.
Meanwhile, let the abolition army begin its
attack, and let us be prepared to successfully
resist it.
Thk Traitor Brkckimhdok Expet.t.kd from
tiieSknatk ? Mokk Candidates for Expulsion. ?
The Scnato of the United States did a good
work yesterday, and did it well. Its late pre
siding officer, John C. Breckinridge, ex-Vice
President of the United States, faithless to his
oaths uud a renegade to his country, is at tlio
head of a rebel force in Kentucky. It would
be an ignominy to the Senate to have his name
on tbo roll of Senators. The Senate thought so,
and proceeded yesterday to rid itself of that ig
nominy. Mr. Chandler, of Michigan, introduced
a resolution to expel Breckinridge. The trai
tor's colleague, Powell, himself equally open to
the charge of treason, interposed by repre
senting that, inasmuch as Breckinridge had al
ready resigned, he could not be expelled. Mr.
Trumbull, of Illinois, took opposito grounds,
and, by consent of Mr. Chandler, amended the
resolution so as to make it more tert-e and forci
ble. It is as follows: ?
Whereon, John C. RrrckmriJifO, o mombor of this body,
has Joined tlio cnomio.i or his country, and in now In
unimMlkl govcruiuutil lie has ?woiu to support;
lluri f"t?,
Resolved, That the trai'or BreelinriJge be txpelld.
This resolution received the unanimous vote
of the Senate. There were ten Senators either
absent or not votiug, and among these was Lite
trailer's friend, Powell.
The House of Representatives had dono a
similar work the previous day by expelling
Burnett, of Kentucky, and Reed, of Missouri^
This is a manifestation of the right sort of
spirit. It should be steadily persisted in, uud
whenever, in either House, a member shows his
disloyalty to the government, he should be in
stantly expelled. There has been altogether
too much tritling with traitors. We doubt very
much whether Senator Powell's loyalty could
f-taixl any fair test ; and it is but a mild ex
pression to say that his sympathies are with the
rebels. There are others, in both houses, who
come within that very questionable category,
and whose presence in Washington is, of itself,
dangerous. If they do not help the rebels with
arms, they do furnish them with information
We notice also that ex-Senator Green, of Mis
souri, an avowed secessionist, and who is now
on parole, having been arrested as a rebel, is
sojourning at Washington. Senators, ex-Sena
tor* or members, whose loyalty stands at such
a low ebb its that of the men we allude to.
should not be tolerated in Congress, nor per
mit led to remain in Washington, where they act
as spies for the rebels. If not expelled from
Congress, they bhould lie taken in hand by
General McClellan, ami sent away as suspectcd
persons. Let there be no more spies or traitors
in Congress.
TlIK PKOPOSED DlSMSliBKRMKNT AND PARTITION
ok Rkbkt. Virginia.* ? The Secretary of War
suggests a novel and effective mode of punish"
ing rebel States. lie proposes to try hia ex
periment first upon Virginia. His plan is to
dismember the rebel portion of that State, and i
to partition up its territory, after the manner of
Poland, among States that hare remained loyal
to the Union. First, he recognizes the already
seceded portion of it ? Western Virginia ? as an
existing dr facto Slate. Its eastern boundary is ut
present fixed by the Blue Hidge. This Secretary
Cameron proposes to have fixed as the eastern
boundary oi' the State of Virginia. In other
words, the only Virginian State to be recognised
at all is the newly constituted one of Western
Virginia. Its urea is to bo increased by
throwing in the two Maryland counties of Al
leghany and Washington. All east of the Blue
Ridge to Chesapeake I'ay, including the cities
of Richmond, Petersburg, Fredericksburg and
Norfolk, is to be annexed to Maryland; while
the two peninsular counties of Accoinac and
Northampton are to be ceded to Delaware.
All this Mr. Cameron calmly proposes, not by
way of punishment to the rebel State of Vir
ginia ? though, of course, that is the overpowcr
ingmofiveand sufficient excuse? but simply as a
proper and expedient reconstruction of the bouir
darienof the States of Delaware, Maryland and
Virginia, so as to place the seat of the national
government, for all time to come, beyond reason
able danger of seizure by enemies within or foes
from without. The new lines proposed are, he
says, great natural boundaries, which for all time
to come would servo to mark the limits of these
States. Any constitutional difficulty in the way
may be obviated, he thinks, by the mutual as
sent of the States concerned (regardless, of
course, of rebel Virginia) and Congress.
We doubt not that this plan ? the details of
which will be better understood by reference
to th?r map and explanatory article which we
publish in connection with it ? will bo popular
among the grout mass of the loyal people of the
North.
1/ Congre >s take up the subject, the plan may
undergo great modification, and Virginia may
not bo so completely dismembered as Mr.
Cameron proposes. But that some such retri
butive justice should be meted out to her, as a
punishment for her share in this infamous re
bellion, and ns a memorable warning for other
States in all time to came, there will be fow to
gainsay or dispute. It will also, if carried out,
have the effect of dispelling, to a brge extent,
that absurdly ridiculous dogma of State sove
reignty, which has been the strongest element
iu this secession movement, and will teach
States rights men. us tliey call themselves, that
States are merely enlarged municipalities, hav"
ing distinct legislative systems for the sake of
convenience, but subordinate in all material
national matters to the republic, one and indi
visible. It is well that the lesson should first
be imparted to Virginia.

How to Test thk Cmm-ATioN of the IIkiui.d
anh Its Contkmpobak'ks. ? "The Little Villain"
of an obscure newspaper in this city is in such
ft desperate way to get exact information about
tbe circulation of tbe Herald that be proposes
to pay $12,500 for it in the shape of a gambling
bet. Where, we should like to know, did our
poverty stricken contemporary get tbe money?
At what pawnbroker's shop in Chatham street
did he deposit tho stock of his paper in order to
raise the wind ! But, supposing that he could
scrape together so much of other men's money,
which It must be confessed is a violent pre
sumption, or granting that he has on baud so
mil eh cash that he can fairly call his own ? a
still more outrageous supposition ? wo do not
want to take any man's money without giving
him a fair equivalent for it. Betting on a cer
tainty is considered so dishonorable that the
sporting fraternity, and all who are in tho habit
of muking bets, unanimously agree that the
man who bets about a matter of which he has
certain knowledge is not only not permitted to
win, but forfeits his own stake. Perhaps the
Little Villain, now on his last legs, calculates
to get $12,500 from us by laying this gambling
trap for our feet, in order to prop up bis ri'ketty
concern a little longer. He is well aware that
we are sure our circulation is fivefold greater
than his, and consequently to accept such a
wager would be unfair on our part.
Betting, Jwwever, even when fair, is against
our religion, and we cannot consent to let him
have tho information he seeks In that way. But
as he makes a pitiful appeal to us. we will let
him have it gratuitously. Let a committee of
three bo appointed, the Little Villain to name
one, we another, and these two to select a third
man. We will submit our books for tho last
twenty years to their examination, and we will
give them every fncility to ascertain our circu
lation during that period, provided that the
Littlo Villain will do the same as regards his
bantling journal from the time it came into ex
istence up to tbe present date. Let the 4felts
of the examination in both cases be published,
and the world will then see who is tolling tbe
truth and who is not.
This is our way of giving our contemporary
the information he desires. If he does not like
it, then we have another proposition to make.
The time is approaching thai tho Postmaster
gives his advertising to tho newspaper of high
est circulation in this city, as he is bound to do
by lasv. Let our contemporary apply for it.
We will do the same. Let the books of both
journals be laid before the Postmaster, who
can thus satisfy himself as to tho circulation of
each. Let bis decision be published in both
papers immediately after.
Such are the tests l?y which we propose to
have the circulation question settled. Has our
contemporary any objection to offer to them ? If
so. lot liiin state it. If ho has not, then let tho
matter be disposed of at once, when he will ob
tain gratis all he wants to know. For instance,
he will discover that the circulation of the I1e
jtAi.n did not reach 135,000 yesterday, but only
120,000. Let him accept this free offer, instead
of sporting $12,500 not bis own, and let him
apply all his surplus cash, as far as it will go,
to the payment of his debts.
Fin at. Dkstwction* ok Partiks. ? The election
of Mayor in this city is the strongest evidence of
the destruction of parties by the operation of
the war. The republican candidate was elected
by conservative votes, after having repudiated
the obnoxious principles of bis party. The de
mocratic partf was defeated because it is de
moralized, disorganized and divided like a large
routed army, which becomes the prey of a
Binaller forco whose organization is intact. The
same folly that lost the democracy the Presi
dential election, and the recent election
in this State, has now lost the elec
tion to the Mayoralty. Mr. Opdyke, who
was only elected by the skin of his teeth, could
not have been elected had the democracy con
centrated on one man. Their united vote ex
ceeds that for the republican candidate bv 20,00i).
The division of the democracy in this State
caused the division in the Democratic Conven
tion at Charleston and at Baltimore, which
elected Mr. Lincoln ; and the Albany Regency,
1 the authors of the split, have been beaten every
where throughout the State this fall. The final
catastrophe is their defeat in the democratic
city of New York. The democratic party is
broken up. There is nothing left of it. The
primary causes of the disruption and disinte
gration of the democratic party are the corrup
tion and incompetency of the leaders. Other
parties have been broken up, and the repub
lican party is now hastening to its dissolution
from the same causes. Henceforth there will
be only two parties in the country ? the party
of disunion, and the party of the Union, the
constitution and the laws.
Mu. Lincoln's Mks-uuk on Our For. sign Re
lations. ? President Lincoln understands the
proper way of dealing with England. She may
mean peace, but she may be intent on mischief,
lie proposes that in our coast and frontier de
fences, and in our navy, wo shall so si l engthen
ourselves as to be ready for any contingency.
This is the way to answer the menaces of Eng
land; and when she is further made to under
stand that in six months we can, if required,
increase our army of half a million to a million
of men, and our navy from two hundred aud
fifty ships to five hundred, she will cease to
menace us. Our shuffling, thin skinued and
trembling abolition organs ? the Tribune and
Times ? have been denouncing the Herald, as
laboring to foment a war with England for the
relief of Jeff. Davis, in our articles urging the
identical policy of President Lincoln. We are
satisfied with our endorser, and our slow coach
abolition detainers are welcome to make all
they can of their silly abuso and their blunder
ing folly.
Iron-Plated Suirs fob Oi r Navt. ? By the
report of the Secretary of the Navy we find that
three iron-clad steamers arc now being built,
and that ho recommends the building oF twenty
additional vessels of the same kind. They are
undoubtedly costly, and there is a difficulty, as
the Secretary remarks, in combining the heavy
armament with the light draft desirable for the
coast service. But by all means let us have
them. They are just the sort of craft we stand
most in need of, and their draft can easily be
regulated according to size and our naval re
quirements. With the two hundred and sixty"
four vessels, mounting in the aggregate 2,5f>7
guns, already constituting our naval force, these
armor steamers, and others in process of con
struction, will raise us to the dignity of a great
naval Power, and we shall be well able to cope
with any or all of the European Powers on tho
high seas as well as on land. Congress will
doubtless act upon this reoommendation of tho
Department.
Tite Mayoralty Elkcciow? Pnoaracra of 4
Nkw Chabteb. ? The vote for Mayor will bs
found to be very close when the canvassers
shall have made out the official returns. But
there Is no good reason to believe that the
result we announced yesterday will be changed.
It may be safely assumed that Opdyke is elect
ed, though by a minority of tho voters. The
division in the democratic party lost them the
election, as it did the recent State election and
the Presidential election of 1860. Instead of
only one being put forward, two democrat!#
candidates are nominuted, and the consequence
is that the republican candidute is elected,
though the figures show a majority of twenty
thousand against him. A house divided against
itself cannot stand ? a lesson for Tammany and
Mozart.
But even with this division the republican
candidate would not have been successful but
for two circumstances which operated in his
favor. One was the speech made by Wood to
the Germans, in which he so directly assailed
the administration, and thus drove into the
ranks of Gunthor many conservative democrats
who are in favor of the war. Had the elec
tion been two or three days later it is
probable Gunther, from this cause, would have
been elected. The other circumstance which
operated against Wood, and in favor of Opdyke,
was that the latter, two days before the election,
came out in a card repudiating abolitionism*
This was the canse of his polling a vote a little
higher than that for Gunthor, who, without the
aid of any newspapers, was very near being
successful. The whole vote may be regarded
as decidedly Union and conservative.
We opposed the election of Mr. Opdyke be
cause of our hostility to the political principles
of the party who gave him the nomination. Bat,
as he has repudiated the rabid revolutionary
ideas of the abolitionists, we must now regard
him as a conservative man. As to his character
for integrity or his capacity for the office, we
never had a doubt. lie will therefore, there i*
every reason to believe, make a good Mayor.
And as the State Legislature will be republican,
we hope they will clothe him with such powers
as are necessary to render his office efficient,
and not permit him to be a mere cipher, as the
Mayor of this great empire city now is. The
population, wealth and intelligence of New
York city place it in rank far above several
States of tho Union. Its principal ex
ecutive officer ought to be invested
with a degree of dignity suitable to the position
of the metropolitan city of tho United States.
His power ought to correspond in some degree
with that of tho Lord Mayor of London. The
whole executive authority ought to be vested
in him, instead of tho responsibility being di
vided us it is now, and everything consequently
allowed to go wrong. He ought to be elected
for four years. The name of Mayor ought te
bo changed to that of President, and the desig
nation of Aldermen and Councilmen changed
respectively to Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, after tho model of the federal go
vernment. An executive mansion, too, ought to
be built for the President in the Park. Let this
be dono by a new charter at the opening of the
State Legislature, nud hereafter we may expeot
an efficient executive, who will give us oleas
streets, and conduct tho government of the citjr
as it ought to be conducted, instead of ths
jarring, clashing machinery which is now
throwing all things into confusion, and doc*
not permit the responsibility to be brought
home to one head. Let this reform be at once
accomplished, and we shall never hear again,
as we so often do at present, that " nobody fc
to blame," when gross corruption and malad
ministration offend the nostrils of all decent
men.
Commissioners for the Army. ? The Secre
tary of War, in his report, suggests that Con
gross shall give authority to the President to
send commissioners with the army with powers
to exercise all the functions of local govern
ment wherever the civil authority has ceased to
exist. We do not concur in this recommenda
tion. The history of the first Frenoh Revolu
tion offers too many examples of fearful abuses
resulting from the delegation of the powers of
government in this form to rouder them safe of
imitation. Civil commissioners, armed with
irresponsible authority of this kind, are very
apt to become despots. There is this further
objection to them, that there would be ? as wag
the case under the Directory? a constant clash
ing of jurisdiction between tliem and the mili
tary chiefs. The safer course ? a3 has been
already shown in the course of the present
war ? is to appoint to the command of expedi
tious entering the rebel States generals com
bining political experience with their military
qualities. Men like Generals McGlellan, Banks
and Dix are fully competent to deal with all
the civil and legal questions that may arise oa
the military occupation of a district. We havo
seen how, in the Provost Court of Alexandria,
a military man has given satisfaction to a largo
body of suitors in cases involving somo impor
tant legal difficulties. This precedent may be
everywhere advantageously followed until the
re-eatablishmcnt of the authority of tho govern*
ment justifies a return to the regular forms of law.
No necessity has, besides, been shown for the
creation of civil commissioners such as are recom
mended. It is true they might have been of
some use in coexistent jurisdiction with a com
mander so unequal to tho duties of his position
as General Fremont. The exception, howovor?
only proves tho rule established by the success
of the policy initiated by tho other generals
mentioned above, that it is safer to entrust to n
single authority in time of war the military and
civil administration of a rebellious district than
to divide it between officers whoso training and
prejudices would be ture to bring them in con
flict.
The MKPHTSTornn.R8 op Abolition on Gevb
Rxh Cameron's Retort. ? The Tribune , in one of
its articles yesterday, endeavors to make it
appear that there was a heated discussion be
tween tho President and tho Secretary of War
in ret'ereneo to that portion of the report of the
latter which treats of the use to be made of the
slaves of rebels. The object of this is of course
to show that there are irreconcileablc differ
ences iu tho Cabinet on the subject. The report
itself, as it appeared yesterday, is the best
answer that can be made to such assumptions.
Had there been any such scene as that described
it would have beeu follovod by General Came
ron's immediate resignation. All that passed
between the President and the Secretary was
what usuully occurs when a mistake has been
made by 0110 gentleman and an explanation is
demanded by another. The error was promptly
nnd cheerfully corrected, and there was an end
of tho matter. It is useless for the abolition
rgana to try to sow the seeds of discord la
