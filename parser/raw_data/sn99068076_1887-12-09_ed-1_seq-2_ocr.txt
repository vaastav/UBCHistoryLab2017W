BY C. R. TINAN.
There is a moral in the 1 ale Atlantf.
election that will have application in a
general way. Two yeara ag.i the prohi
bitionists carried that city by a majority
of 200. They then proceeded to enforce
the law with quhcard of rigor, invaded
private dwellings at unreasonable hours
and rumaged around after the uiauflr.r
of a foraging party in time of war. No
right was respected when the liquor
constables were on the scent. Lawsuits
multiplied, and much factional bitter
ness was inevitably engendered. The
pr^Wbitioniats, in their eagerness, went
toe "ir and groused a conservative feel
ing that, together with the fact that the
law would not be enforced iu tpito of
them, buried them under an adverse
majority of over 1,100 in the county at
the Jale election. It is almost certain
that the liquor element wiil mistake
this vote aa a license for f\ee wtiaky,
and, acting accordingly, will inaugerate
a reign of recklessness that will later
change tie mEjurity to tho other side.
In many localities neither the prohi
bitionists or the liquor dealers soetn to
have any eenae on this questiou. E»ch
want all or nothing, and tho resell is a
continual excitement and uncertainty
that does more harm than good.to the
cause of good goveiuieut as well as that
of temperance.
A recent issue of t'je Cactou Ad or ate
in referring to Mr. McBride again as
suming control of tlie Mitchell Alan eaid
ia substance that "Bob" was at work on
his smut machine, to which U-e Moil
retorts: "Of what earthly uae sre such
sheets as the Advocate, but to spoil good
paper? Colorless, insane, idealess to
idwy, th# produce lSss rillles in their
neighborhood, than a lame tad pole in
the Gulf of Mexico. No, they are not
vulgar. Tlicy are what Heinrich Hein
calls 'anatomical}- Trrtuous,' physic
ally anil mentally impotent." The Dell
Rapids Tvnn and the Flaudreau Jlerati
also, it seems, are indulging insnaae
journalistic compliments. Witness the
following from the Timet: "In speaking
of cur comment upon a certain item
taken from the Herald two weeks ago,
Bio. Whitman says: 'The Tim,s should
bear in mind that smut is not wit and no
one will voluntarily enl*r into a contest
with a polecat.' We now see our mis
take i:: entering into a conteu with Air,
and, by the way, he should not 'orget
the above quotation himself. You can't
tell h'.iw rank a poll-cat is until you atir
liiui np. We have stirred and are satis
fled."
It is painfully evideat that something
h-is got to he done for the relief of the
children's best friend, Hsnta C'laus. The
chimneys, as built to-dsy, cspeci»l!y in
Kimbdll and vicinity—some of them be
ing nothing bur a section of stove pipe
projecting through the roof—are alto
gether too small for the jolly old saint's
comfort. Just think what a terrible
catastrophy it would be for him to get
stuck in «ome chimney before he should
get half over his route. The thought is
terriUe when it ir, consiyvre '. how many
disappointed little UOVB and girls there
would be. In conversation with the old
gentleman late one night this week he
said something had got to he done be
fore Christmas as he had been increasing
in girth steadily while the chimneys
ave been shrinking. In many places
last year they had to drive Mm down
with a sledjs-
In the recent prohibition campaign at
Atlanta, thousands of hand-bills were
circulated by the anti-prohibitionists
containing a picture of Abraham Lincoln
striking the chains from the slaves. Be
low the picture was printed the tollow
ug extract from one of Lincolu'e
speeches:
"Prohibition will work great injury to
the cause of temperance. It is a eposes
of inteuiperac.ee within itself, for it goes
beyond the bounds of reason, in that it
attempts to control a man's appetite by
legislation, and in making crimes out of
things that arc not crimes A prohibi
tory law strikes a blow at the very prin
ciples on which our goverment was*
founded. I have always been found
laboring to prutcct the weaker classes
from the stronger, and I ran never give
my consent to such a law as you propose
to enact. Until my tongue be silenced
in death 1 will continue to fight for the
rights of man."
They—the one st.ate 'cllows—say it's
the office seekers—the politicians—who

When you get down t» the bottom of it

President Cleveland submitted the

the United States,

When it was proposed to rcduco letter
postage from three to two cenls it was
believed by the opponents of the meas
ure that under the reduction there would
not be revenue enough from the postal
service to meet expenses. It has been
found, however, that the net postal rev
enue has been greatly inCTe-ised during
the i.ast two years, and it is probable
that the po&MRcc officials wiil otter

A few years ago the late Czar of Bus
sir began to "nip anarchy in the liud."
He kept up the nipping business until he
himself was nipped. Then his son laid out
the same line of policy. Upon the let
ter's recent trip from the German fron
tier to his capital he needed,the services
of 80,000 Boldiers to watch the railroad
track and inspcct each lump of coal
used by the engine. Evidently the Rus
sian style of nipping buds is not a suc
cess.
The supreme court of the United States
decided the three prohibition cases from
Kansas on the fith inst. The court
holds that the state has a right to su
press the traffic under ita jMilice powers
and also without paying damages or
compensation to the liouor dealers.
This settles the question of the validity
of the prohibition law In the affirmative
and is an important in.iut gained by .he
prohibitionists.
The queen of England has very little
real power. She has no power of- veto

Young and pretty Mrs. Georee Gsoukl
stood on her head while passing through
Clevoland in a private car with her hus
band, the other day. This may look
like a rash statement to make, but wc
know it is true, because the Cleveland
Lender published her picture in that
position, and the Leader is one of the
most reliable exchanges fiom which we
ever pulled a wrapper.
During the late prohibition campaign
in Atlanta, Georgia, the Atlanta Consti
tution presented a curious phrase of
journalism. The two editors of the pa

opposite sides in the question. Their
views were both published in their pa
per with proper d-istinguishing marks.
