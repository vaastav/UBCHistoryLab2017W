SONLAND
Thus wrote Longfellow:
"Look not mournfully into the past 1
Wisely Improve the present
Go forth to meet the shadowy future
without wear."
Good stuff, even thought a bit plati
tudlnal. Native Americans boast of the things
the Fathers accomplished.
Imported Americans keep alove a
tender regard for "The Fatherland."
Quite natural and, in a way, com
mendable. But do we not sometimes lose sight
of he fact that we are fathers, too,
and we are fathering a land for our
sons and their sons?
Doesn't the thought help us a llttlo
net to rely on what our ancestors have
done for us, not to be guided neces
sarily by precedent, not to be steered
forever by the dead hand, but to re
member that we. too, are making his
tory and that we need to make it not
alone to save our own skins, but for
the safety and freedom of our descend
ants? Every citizen in the world today
must face the problems of the world.
He must help overcome them, or they
will overcome him and his sons.
Let him forget past prejudices and
be not too sure of past prides.
Let him remember Fatherland less
ard Sonland more.

AS HE SAW LIFE
Andrew Carnegie's autobiography
now is published. He left it In the
fcrm of notes which have been ar
ranged in chronological order by Prof.
John Van Dyke.
Carnegie records it in the motto
which he inscribed in his libraries at
New York and at Skibo, his estate in
Scotland.
It Is such a sentiment as one might
expect of a man who built .o many
public libraries In the United States.
"He who cannot read is a fool.
"He that will not Is a bigot.
"He that dare not is a slave-."
No lcsH Interesting is his creed, the
final sentences of which are, "It would
be no greater miracle to be born to a
future life than to have been born to
live in this present life. The one bus
been treated, why not the other'.'
Therefore, there is reason to hop.' for
I Immortality. Why not hope'."'

The enrroiichmonts of salt water
have reduced the Tampico oil field's
f production about 50 per cent in the
J pytlmntion
of prominent oil men in
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. Oils and rails
of the better class were the only re
deeming features of today's irregular
to heavy stock market, those shares
displaying occasional strength while
specialties of the miscellaneous varie
ty were under constant pressure.
Weakest stocks were those compris

sues whose financial requirements and
dividend status have recently been the
subject of lively discussion in specula
tive circles.
Texas & Pacific coal and oil was in
active demand at a net gain or aj
points and Willys-Overland, preferred,
represented the other side of the ac
count, losing 9 points, or a total
of 20 points in a little more than a
week. Nominal losses exceeded gains
at the uncertain close, witn saics 01
0,0.00 shares. Dealings were prepon
derantly professional, developments
and other incidents of the day, includ
ing the publication of the president's
message to congress, evidently lacking
the elements to operations for the con
structive side.
Greater interest was "manifested by
local financial interests In the addi
tional bank failures reported from
North Dakota, commodity markets
were again nervous and new low prices
were recorded for raw sugar and bar
silver.
Several of the leading transportation
svstems announced further curtailment
of their working forces, the New Eng
land textile situation developing more
unfavorable aspects and a leading
Canadian silver mine suspended divi
dends. V
No deviation from its recent mono
tonous course was shown Dy me

London and all centers of continental

Financial Review
By ERIC KOBBE
Of Blyth, Witter & Co.
The cost of production does not af
fect the price at which a commodity
can be sold. It does determine what
the producer will attempt to obtain for
his product but the demand is the
court of last appeal which rules what
the selling price shall be. Hence If
there is a lack of demand for a certain
product, the producers of that product
face a situation in which it is necessary
for them to accept a price which is low
enough to stimulate buying, even
though that price is below the cost of
production. To falsely stimulate buy
ing by curtailing production, or by
withholding goods from the market.
will eventually leatl to lower readjust
ments than if the loss made necessary
by the law of supply and demand was
accepted at once. A lowering of the
sale price to the point of stimulating
buying will be the bottom, for as soon
as buying recommences the price will
at once strengthen and the sooner that
condition of affairs can be brought
about the sooner we will be back at
normal times- We have run the whole
gauntlet from the wildest speculation,
the highest prices, and the largest prof
its, down to prices at less than cost
and a great volume of business fail
ures. Can we not find the middle
ground?
Jt appears to the Review that the
price readjustment is sound business
and an economic necessity. The losses
which entail to producers are necessary I
providing that these losses are not ruin
ous and the present price of sugar,
grain and cotton, while indicating a
heavy loss, do not indicate ruin. It
seems beyond dispute also that the pro
ducers could see nothing for this year
except exceptionally high" prices for
their products and they allowed their
cost of production to mount up much
higher than was justified on this as
sumption. Hence, when these prices
failed to jn-tt-rialize, and even dropped
to abnormally low prices, the producers
were caught with a crop on which the
cost of production had been so high
that they now face a much greater loss
than if 'this cost had been kept down
commensurate with average prices.
While all the foregoing may be true,
we are . talking about ancient history,
and unless we can learn a lesson from
present conditions and study out a eolu
tion for the problem, it is quite useless
to review and rub salt Into old wounds.
Therefore we will take up the condi
tion of cotton, which holds all the local
Interest, and see if we cannot possibly
make some constructive suggestions
not with any idea that the present
situation can be eased to any extent,
but with the idea that the same mis
takes will not be repeated in years to
come.
The first consideration is bettering
the market. This is especially true for
long" staple cotton. The advantages of
this commodity for all purposes are
too numerous to mention, and it re
mains for the producers to organize a
marketing association which will start
now to take care of the 1921 crop.
Thus the producers will have a voice
through this association In naming and
controlling a just price for their prod
uct. Adequate warehouse facilities
should be provided. This could be
taken care of by a state issue of bonds.
The producers must Introduce busi
ness methods in their farming. You
cannot control a thing you do not own
and If a crop must be mortgaged to
pay the liiing expenses of the producer
and also the cost of production, that
producer has small chance to say what
price he will or will not accept for his
crop. He must sell for any price that
may be offered. There has been en

tirely too much "shoe-string" farming
farming that has been gone at blind
ly and ignorantly, with the result that
legitimate producers have been made
to suffer along with the speculator and
the amateur. Who will say that the
elimination of this type of farmer will
not react in the end to the benefit
of all ?
We must also get away from the one
crop idea. Acreage planted to food and
feed crops, a re-establishment of a
staple live-stock industry, adds to the
cotton producer's ability to produce his
main crop at a reasonable cost and re
moves many difficulties of financing
as done at the present time. Scientific
methods would, no doubt, also raise
the yield per acre. Once the farmers
own their crops, co-operative methods
may bo used for financing and market
ing which will act to the advantage of
both producer and consumer. The pro
ducer will be able to take advantage of
the national warehouse act and will be
able to sell direct to the mills or to the
exporters.
The national warehouse act provides
for the establishment ' of warehouses
under government supervision and of
an approved type in which the cotton
producer can store his cotton. The
manager of the warehouses must be
bonded and the commodities stored
therein must be fully insured. The
grower, when he stores his cotton, is
eiven a transferable warehouse re
ceipt which is collateral of high value,
The number of bonded warehouses is
yet so small that no appreciable part
of the crop can b stored in this way,
but beyond this the first requisite is
that the farmer own his crop.
Summing up, the preventive meth
ods that must be used to prevent a
recurrence of the present situation seem
to the Review to be:
1. Business methods for the pro
ducers.
2. Diversified farming.
3- The organization of co-operative
marketing associations.
4. The building of bonded ware
houses.
A combination of these things appear
to us to point to a clear road for the
