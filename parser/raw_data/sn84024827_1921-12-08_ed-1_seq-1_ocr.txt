Predicted Kennedy Would
Die in Weird Story
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 7.
A con
versation in a beauty parlor, involv
ing a prediction of the death of J.
Belton Kennedy, was the major topic
of testimony today in the trial of Ar
thur C. Burch, accused of murdering
Kennedy. The conversation was de
scribed by Mrs. Mary A. Bailiff of
Los Angeles, who said Mrs. Mada
lynne Obenchain, accused Jointly with
Burch, had made the prediction of
Kennedy's death. Long cross evam
ination failed to change her story.
Mrs. Bailiff said she met Mrs. Ob
enchain first at the beauty parlor last
spring and that they "got to talking
as women will." Later, she said, they
met again at the same place, and she
described to Mrs. Obenchain a dream
she had had, in which she saw Mrs.
Obenchain on a country road with a
crowd approaching.
Would Not Marry Belton
"I couldn't tell whether it was a
funeral or a wedding procession,"
the witness declared, and added she
thought it strange she should dream
such a thing about a stranger, where
upon Mrs. Obenchain saiid:
"I know exactly what rc meant. 1
feet something is going to happen.
Belton will soon pass out." And lat
er 'she said: "Belton will soon pass
out. I could almost put my hand
on the spot where it will happen."
Mrs. Bailiff said Mrs. Obenchain
on July 25 invited her to lunch with
her at the hotel where Mrs. Oben
chain was stopping and she did so
on July 27. Then, she went on, Mrs.
Obenchain told her she "would never

in his denouncement.
"Yet, we have the spectacle," he
added, "of the president making a

thing unprecedented. Then fester

ST. POHNS, N. F., Dec. 7.
Eighteen lives are known to have
been lost in the terrific northwest
storm off the Newfoundland coast
that swept a score of vessels from
the sea on Monday and Tuesday. De
tails were slowly filtering into this
port tonight, due to the demoraliza
tion of wires, but it was believed
property damage along the coast
would total $250,000.
Nine men, a woman an a cniid are
reported to have gone down with the
rchooner Passport at Bay Verde. The
schooner Jean and Mary parted from
her tug, the D. P. Ingraham near Pen
guin Island and was lost with her
crew of seven. The tug which was
a United States gunboat In the civil
war, was driven on the :siand near
the lighthouse and became a total
wreck, but her crew was saved.
Schooner Is Missing
The Bchooner Vicola, out of Lun
enburg, N. S., which left North Syd
ney, N, S., several days ago in com
pany with the Alcala, has not been
heard from. She carries a crew of
seven. The Alcala is safe here.
Wreckage of ships laden with food
btuffs for northern settlements strews
the coast at Conception pay. Five
fishing vessels are known to have
been smashed to pieces. j
Charles Moore, master of the In-
graham, brought in the first details of j
the storm today. HJs vessel, after ,
losing the Jean and Mary, was blown
across Hamilton Sound to the light
house at Penguin Island where she
became a total wreck. The gale i
struck the vessels during a blinding
snow storm, he said. Deck houses
went by the board, running lights
were smashed and the tow-line was
snapped. The captain said the mast
er of the Jean and Mary trted to con
nect with the tug, but the latter was
swept away to the island. No ship
could live in the sea that was run
ning, Captain Moore said. He added
that it was the worst storm in his
long experience as a sailor.
Crowds See Wreck
Ships for the northern outposts of
the colony were carrying a winter's
supply of foodstuffs to many fami
lies. A list of the schooners reported
lost included the Dtenthus, Cactus,
Jean and Mary, Passport, W. S. Mon
roe. Drummer's Tax, A. H. Hardy,
William Martin, Prospector, Natoma,
Pansy, Thresa Stone, Gordon, W. O.

Watchers on the ciirrs of Concep
tion Bay saw the schooner believe:!
to be the Passport. Through the driv
ing mist, they were aere to discern
the figures of the nine men and the
woman with the child, but before a
life line could be shot over the wreck
the schooner was smashed to pieces
and all on board were swallowed by
the roaring sea.

year of , 1921 was described as
"one of liquidation" and the year
of 1922 was forecast as "one of
recuperation" by Secretary Hoo
ver today in an address at the an
nual convention of the United
States Potters' Association.
"The country has passed the
worst stages of depression and is
now on the upgrade," he aid.
Activities in the construction
industry, he declared, were sign
posts of conditions. This indus
try, for three months, he declared
has revealed extremely encour
aging indications.
Hoover expressed the belief
that a too liberal interpretation
bad been applied to the phrase
"Keep the government out of
business." When the phrase was
coined, the explained, it applied
to getting the government out of
the operations of railroads and
ships but, he asserted, there were
many lines of business which need
the co-operation and assistance o
the government. Export trade,
he added, was primarily involved
in governmental assistance and
service.
