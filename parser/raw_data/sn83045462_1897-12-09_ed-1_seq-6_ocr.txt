MESSAGE PLEASES SPAIN
Ministry Accepts President McKinley's As
surances of Good Will.
Senor More*, However. Renenti the
Implied Threat of Intervention In
Cote Autonomy Falls.
A dispatch from Madrid to the New York
Evening Telegram yesterday says: Taken
as a whole, the impression created here
by President McKinley's message Is very
good.
Although individual ministers refused to
give personal opinions on the matter, a dip
lomatist who enjoys the entire confidence
of the cabinet?the time who replied so
effectively It. the Herald to Estrada Palma
?made the following statement for the
Evening Telegram:
"I am only echoing the opinion of the en
tire cabinet when I say that the message
is regarded as extremely favorable to
Spain.
"It recognizes, amply, her rights. It ren
ders Justice to the efforts of the present
government to restore order, peace and
prosperity to the island.
"It expresses plainly the opinion that the
autonomy contained in the decree lately
issued is generous and ample, and admits
quite as plainly that the insurgents have
no further excuse fcr opposition and claim
ing iecogmtion of belligerent lights.
"1 am ceitain that the ministers of the
cabinet arc- gratified to a degree, and re
gard the message as a most hopeful indi
cation of the ultimate success of Spain's
efforts.
At the same time, others among the
ministers feel certain that certain clauses
in the message call for some protest."
M. Moret is believed to be among these
latter. The diplomatist says:
"President McKinley says under certain
conditions that if Spain, after having a
fair chance to put the reforms into opera
tion, is without complete success. the
nited States, in the cause of humanity
?inu in the interests of commerce, will be
compelled to interfere.
Now, what does 'a fair chance' mean?
Does it mean, as we Spaniards hope it does,
that the Insurgents will understand that
filibustering will lie suppressed? That those
found guilty of fomenting resistance will
be_ severely punished?
, "I'1r ,his CHSe Spain asks nothing more
success of her efforts there.
. e arc thousands. In fact, a majority
of the population of the island, who ardent
ly long for peace, who desire only to en
Joy the lioerty granted them now. If those
who remain intractable find all hope of help
from the I nited States cut off on the one
hand and are opposed, on the other hand,
by the remainder, the war will be totally
at an end within two months.
"But suppose they think by keeping In
arms tne 1 nited States will Interfere with
Jf* cer^a*n time? The sreopraphicaP con
ditions of the island and the nature of the
conditions prevailing^ there might enable
ihem to keep up a scattered, desultory war
fare for an indefinite period. In fact, the
hope of future help from America would
?.a Premium on insurrection.
Remember that a large number of the
ir"?rn.,s nre not any more infatuated
with independence than with autonomy.
j remain up in arms because the con
hatem ?* pcaceful la,'or are what they
"Therefore. I repeat. President McKin
le> s message in reference to 'a fair chance'
means that. say. for perhaps a year the
insurgents will be cut off from every form
H' '"hort' Spaln ,s left 10 deal
with h<r own people in the fairest s-mit
of humanity and a desire for reconciliation
ami Justice, the insurrection in such event
must ( le out v.ithin a couple of months
This interpretation of Presiden McKin
ley s message is not accepted.
"It is believed fhe references, such as
above, were intended by the President to
pacify a certain section in Congress."

IIALF A YEAH IX JAIL.
Mickey Will Xot Have to Hnatle for
Chrlntmaa Dinner.
James Mickey, who is not an Irishman,
as his name would suggest, but a coal
black negro boy. about eighteen years of
age, was sentenced to Jail by Judge Kim
ball in the Police Court this morning for
assaulting a colored girl named Maggie
Mason. From the evidence, it appeared
'hat Mickey had struck Maggie such a se
vere blow in the face that a compound
fracture of the Jawbone was the result,
and she has to wear her face in a sling.
When questioned as to why he had struck
the girl, Mickey said he was drunk at the
time, and <111 not remember how he hap
pened to do it.
Deed, Jedge, I did not have nothing
against the girl. Her brother and me was
drinkin' together, and I was very drunk."
"Well," said Judge Kimball, "I think six
months in Jail will Just about suit a man
who will knock a girl down and break her
Jaw."

possible for a tailor to make? When correctly

can invariably feel that they own garments that
fit them in a manner which lends an even and
regular contour to their forms. In other words,
tliev are made fashionable?made with excellent
tailoring inside and outside. These arc the kinds
you'll get from our line
' ^ ones.
REMEMBER, our Great Extra Sale of $9.97 to-measur?
