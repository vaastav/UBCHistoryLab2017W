Any reciprocity plan which pro
poses to permit foreigners to come
in here to hurt an American industry
while our own people assail foreign
industries, is not only in defiance of
the instinct of self preservation, but
is opposed by all the best experience
we have had. Textile "Record."
The man who makes work for
two men where there was work but
for one man before is a benefactor
of the country. The man who re
verses that operation whether by re
ciprocity or otherwise-is a benefact
or, perhaps, of some other country,
but not of this one. Economist.
The Democratic papers tell us that
an anti-trust congress and an anti
trust administration could soon
knock out all these combines. You see
the Democrats still have faith in the
ability of their so-called leaders to
make the country so dull that all
the trusts would starve to death.
No doubt they could do it. They
are as good wreckers as ever. Mo
ravian Falls (N.C.) "Yellow Jacket."
Every generation has troubles
enough of its own; it should not be
compelled to be continually fighting
over and over the same questions
that divided parties fifty years
ago. Questions once thresh d cut
should stay so, the wheat and the
chaff separate. Every intelligent
American knew in 1840 that Protec
tion enriched this country, benefit
ing especially the worker for wages,
and that free trade and all tenden
cies to it took business away from
the country and so impoverished all
but a verv few. Why, then, must
these lessons be learned over
anO I
over every few yearsr kvery new
exoerience of the familiar facts
scores deeper into the nation and
causes greater suffering than before.
Why should any party, for sheer
partisan advantage, seek to unsettle
the public mind with exploded theo
ries? Let the "American system"
remain henceforth the unchallenged
policy of the nation. Such, indeed,
would be a course of true patriotism.

Epigrammatical Extracts from
President Roosevelt's Message
TRIBUTE. TO MCKINLEY.
It is not too much to say that at
the time of President McKinle's
death he wai the most widely loved
man in all the United States; while
we have never had any public man
of his position who has been so
wholly free from the bitter animosi
ties incident to public life. His po
litical opponents were the first to
bear the heartiest and most generous
tribute to the broad kindliness of
nature, the sweetness and gentleness
of character which so endeared him
to his close associates. To a stand
ard of lofty integrity in public life
he united the tender affections and
home virtues which are all-import
ant in the make-up of national char
acter. A eallant soldier in the
great war for the union, he also shone
as an example to all our people be
cause of his conduct in the most si
red and intimate of home relations.
There could be no personal hatred
of him. for he never acted with
aught but consideration for the wel
fare of others.
ANARCHY.
The blow was not aimed at tyran
ny or wealth. It was aimed at one
of the strongest champions the wage
worker ever had; at one of the most
faithful representatives of the system
of public rights and representative
government who has ever risen to
nublic office This
criminal was a professed anarchist,
inflamed by the teachings of profes
sed anarchists, and probably also
by the reckless utterances of those
who, on the stump and in the public
Dress. aDDeal to the dark and evil
spirits of malice and ereed, envy
and sullen hatred No
man or body of men preaching an
archistic doctrines should be allow
ed at large any more than is preach
ing the murder of some specified
private individual. Anarchtistic
speeches, writings and meeting are
essentially seditious and treason
able Anarchy is a
crime against the whole human race,
and all man-kind should band
against the anarchist. His crime
should be made am offense against
the law of nations, like piracy and
that form of man-stealing known as
luc s'vc wauc, iui n 13 wi hi Lriain-
er infamy than either. . . . .
The American people are slow to
wrath, but when their wrath is once
kindled it burns like a consuming
flame.
TRUSTS.
Successful enterprise, of the type
which benefits all man-kind, can
only exist if the conditions are such
as to offer great prizes as the re
wards of success The
fundamental rule in our national
life the rule which underlies all
others is that, on the whole, and
in the long run, we shall go up or
down together Dis
aster to great business enterprises
can never have its effects limited to
the men at the top. It spreads
throughout, and while it is bad for
everybody, it is worst for those
farthest down Much
of the legislation directed at the
trusts would have been exceedingly
mischievous hand it not also been
entirely inaffective It
is based upon sincere conviction
that combination and concentration
should not be prohibited, but super
vised and within reasonable limits
controlled; and in my judgment this
conviction is right. . . . What
further remedies are needed in the
way of governmental regulation or
taxation can only be determined af
ter publicity has been obtained, by
process of law, and in the course of
administration If,
however, the judgment of the con
gress is that it lacks the constitu
tional power to pass such an act,
then a constitutional amendment
should be submitted to confer the
power.
RECIPROCITY.
Reciprocity must be treated as the
hand-maiden of protection. . .
It is most important that we should
maintain the high level of our pres
ent prosperity The
natural life of development for
policy of reciprocity will be in con
nection with those of our produc
tions which no longer require all of
the support once needed o establish
them upon a sound basis, and with
those others where either because of
natural or of economic causes we
are beyond the reach of successful
competition.
NEW POSSESSIONS.
We hope to do for them what has
never before been done for any peo
ple of the tropics to make them fit
for self government, after the fashion
of the really free nations. . . .
The adminiitation of these islands
should be at wholly free from the
suspicions of partisan politics as the
administration of the army and navy.
. . . . History may safely
be challenged to show a aingle in
stance in which a masterful race
such as our, having been forced by
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT.
theexieencies of war to take posses
sion of an alien land, has behaved
to its' inhabitants with the disinter
ested zeal for their progress that our
oeonle have shown in the Philip
nines. To leave the island at this
time would mean that they would
fall into a welter of murderous an
archy. Such desertion of duty on
our part would be a crime against
humanity.
I NTK KST ATE COM M EKCK .
That law 1887 was largely an
experiment. Experience lias snown
the wisdom of its purposes, but has
alsn shown, uossiblv that some of
its requirements are wrong, certain
ly that the means devised for the en
forcement of its provisions are de
fective The railway is
a public servant. Its rates should
be just to and open to all shippers
alike.
MERCHANT MARINE.
It is discreditable to us as a nation
that our merchant marine should be
utterally insignificent in comparison
to that of other nations which we
overtop in other forms of business
. . . Ships work for their own
countries, just as railroads work for
their terminal points. . . . Our
government should take such action
as will remedy these inequalities
The American merchant marine
should be restored to the ocean.
FORESTRY.
The preservation of our forests is
an imperative Dusiness necessity
We have come to see clearly thai
whatever destroys the forest, except
to make way for agriculture, threat
ens our well Deing
The forest reserves should be set
apart forever for the use and benefit
of our people as a whole, and not
sacrificed to the shortsighted greed
of a few. . . . . The forests
are natural reservoirs. By restrain
ing the streams in flood and replen
ishing them in drouth they make
possible the use of waters otherwise
wasted. They prevent the soil from
washing, and so protect the storage
reservoirs from filling up with silt.
Forest conservation is, therefore, an
essential condition of water conser
vation. IRRIGATION.
It is as right for the national gov
ernnient to make streams and rivers
of the arid regions useful by engin
eering works for storage as to make
useful the rivers and harbors of the
humid region by engineerinc works
of another kind The
reclamation and settlement of the
arid lands will enrich every portion
of our country, just as the settle
ment of the Ohio and Mississippi
valley brought prosperity to the At
lantic States In the
arid states the only right to water
which should be recognized is that
of use.
NAVY.
The American people must either
build and maintain an adequate
navy or else make up their minds
definitely to accept a secondary
position in the international affairs,
not merely in political, but in com
mercial matters. It has been well
said that there is no surer way of
courting national disaster than to be
"opulent, aggressive and unaimed
. . . we desire the peace
which comes as of right to the just
man armed not the peace granted
on terms of ignominy to the craven
and the weakling.
ARMY.
Pressure for the promotion of civ
il officials for political reasons is bad
enough, but it is tenfold worse where
applied on behalf of officers of the
army or navy.
INDIANS.
The Indian should be treated as
an individual like the white man.
CIVIL SERVICE.
The merit system of making ap
pointments is in its essence as dem
ocratic and American as the com
mon school system itself.
CHINESE SITUATION.
In the attainment of this purpose
we necessarily claim parity of treat
ment, under the conventions,
throughout the empire for our
trade and our citizens with those of
all other power.
THE NEW BOOK,
THIRTY YEARS IN WASHINGTON
av Ma. GiNiiMi John A. Lofn.
Thin macniflcently Illustrated volume la pub
lished with tha consent and aid of tlia United
States Government, and ahia fact alona ia evl
denca of It sterling merit and of tba great eara
that hai bean beitowed upon it.
It la aaid that all road lead to Washington
juat ai thajr did to ancient Roma. Certain It ia
that tha ayea of mllliona mho eannot behold tha
marvels aad gloriea of our Natlenal Capitol in
person are constantly turned toward! it.
Tha Book ia a complete panorama of tha
countless Interest of the National Capitol as
seen by a famous woman who, as the wife of an
inlluentlul Senator, a society leader, and a close
friend of every mistress of the White House from
Lincoln to the present time, has been in close
touch with the inner life of Washingtoa and en
joyed rare privileges for studying the mighty
activities of the Government, such aa no other
person has ever before been able to command.
Many distinguished men and women have
long urged Mrs. Logan to give this volume to
the world, She bus rocolved letters from thous
ands unknown to her, expressing the hope that
it would be written . In her preface she says
"My first introduction to the city of Washing'
ton was in 1S58, General Logan being a member
of Congress, and for more than thirty years
have lived there almost continuously, an inter
ested observor of passing events. As the wife
of a Senator, I mny any that 1 enjoyed unusual
privileges and opportunities to see and know
the inner life anil activities of the Capitol City,
I have had my share of the favor ot tha
powers that were, and the honor of being in
eluded among the ilistinguishod guests at both
private and olliciul entertainments; and I have
known the pleasure of personal acquaintance
with prominent statesmen, courtly diplomats
and beuutiful, winning, and gifted women, fill
ing with irraco Hiid dignity the highest social
ignitions thnt the iieople could bestow.
"It has been my aim to show my renders, both
by word and pictorial art, the wonders and th
working of the elaborate machinery of the Gov
ernnient in motion, by leading them through
the great Departments nnd explaining what the
army of busy men and women workers do and
how they do it; to show them the works of art.
the wonderful collections of relics and curlosl'
ties from every part of the world, and the archi-
Ltectural glories and priceless treasures of tho
L apitoi ; to aoscnoe ami explain its giant activ
ities ; to take them through the White House
from the attic to the cellar, through every 'or
hidden room, and to portrny not only its daily
life, past and pros 'nt, hut its brilliant social
nnd otlicial functions as well ; to tell the story
of every President, and of every woman who
ever reigned in tho White House ; to visit the
Treasury, the Denil Letter office, and to solve
the marvels and mystories of every government
industry; in short, to present evory interesting
phase of life and scenes in Washington."
Its illustrations are a triumph of American
art. It is worth tho price of the book just to
look at these 50 magnificent full-page plates,
from photogrnphs taken with government con.
sent and aid exclusively for this volume They
portray wonderfully interesting scones. The
govemniaut generously waived all "rules and
regulations" in order that this book by a woman
of Mrs. Logan's standing and influence should
be as perfect and complete as possible. One can
linger a long time over these plates, and though
he turns from each with regret he is pretty sure
to 11 iui tho next one of still mure absorbing in
terest.
Wo do not know when 710 pages have given us
more genuine pleasuro. If we spoak warmly of
the book, it is because it richly doserves it. It
is sold by agents, and all who introduce such
work ought to bo cordially welcome. Put it in
our homes. To own it is to prize it ; to read it
is to obtain a liberal education. We heliovo the
best way to keep out poor books is by introduc-
ng good ones, and a better one than this has
never boon brought toournotico.
The book is published by the old and well
known firm of A. D. Worthiugton &. Co., Hart
ford, Conn,, whose imprint is sufficient guarau
tee of this first-class volume. They want more
agents for it. An agency for a book so popular
as this oilers to men and women an unusually
good opportunity to do well.

A MOTHER'S MEDICINE.
There is never any question of the value of
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Proscription in the minds
of those who have used it as a preparative for
maternity, and for the reason thatevery woman
ho has experienced maternity has a definite
t.iiularn of comparison by which she can
measure the difference in her condition with or
willieut the health giving aid of "Favorite Pre-
scriptMia."
Fur example, Mrs, S. E. Rose, of Big Otter,
Clay Co., West Va., writes Dr. Pierce as follows:
"I am the mother of five children and have been
as' high as 8 days in the doctor's hands aod never
less than two days at any time until the birth of
my last child. Then I had used two bottles of
'Favorite Prescription" and tho doctor was with
me only two hours."
Every mother will appreciate the force of
that testimony. There ia no chance for error or
forgetfulness in suob a case. It is a plain state
ment of fact ; one hundred and ninety -two hours
of suffering reduced to two hours by the use of
"Favorite Prescription"
This shows what help "Favorite Prescription"
renders in extreme cases. In the ordinary ease
of childbirth the use of thii medicine makes
the baby's advent practically painless. Thous
ands of women testify to this. Mrs. W. J. Kid
der, of Hill Dale Farm, Enosburg, Vt , says
that she was in fast failing health and with the
trial of motherhood before her, when she began
the use of "Favorite Prescription." The result
was, to quote the exact words of her letter: "I
began to improve immediately: my health be
came excellent and I could do all my own work.
I had a short easy confinment and have a healthy
baby hoy."
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription by its re
markable tonic eroperties, puts the system on a
basis of sound health. Nature does the rest.
Nervousness, sleeplessness, morning sieknesi-
loes of appetite, despondency and anxiety are
all cured by the use of "Favorite Prescription."
It gives great physical vigor and muscular elas
ticity, which explains the practicaUy painless
birth hour.
It alee indaeea a free flow of the autritive a.
rations so that the mother Is abundaatly able
to nana and nourish her babe.
la it a wonder that many a grateful woman's
Utter ends in terms aimUar te that of Mrs. J. W.
O. Steveaa, of Mila, Nortaamberland, Co., Va.,
who writes: "I naheaitatiagly advise expeet
aat mothers to am Dr. Pierce's Favorita Pre
scription."
