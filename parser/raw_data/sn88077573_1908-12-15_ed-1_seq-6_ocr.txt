nia cnnal, and'ofttho (-epetltlon of t(ie
Rtory that ,H syndicate of American
cltUuns owned either one or both of
the Panama companies, I deem it
wise to submit to tho congress all
the Information I have on the sub
ject These htorles were first brought
to my attention as published In n pa
per In Indianapolis, called Tho News,
edited by Mr Delavan Smith. Tho
stories wore scurrilous nnd libelous
In character and false In every essen
tial particular. Mr. Smith shelters
hlmtolt behind the excuso that he
merely accepted the statements
which had appeared In n papei pub
lished In New York, The World, own
ed by Mr. Joseph Pulitzer. It Is' Idlo
to say that the known chnracter of
Mr Pulitzer nnd his nqw.spaper arc
such that the htatements in that pa
per will he believed by nobody; un
fortunately thousands of persons arc
Ill-informed in this respect and bo
llevo the statements they see In
print, even though they appear in a
newspaper published by Mr. Pulitzer.
A member of tho congress has actu
ally Introduced a resolution in refer
ence to these charges. I thcreforo
lay all tho facts boforo jou:
The story repeated at vnrlous times
by tho World and by its followers in
the newspaper press Is substantially
as follows: That there was corrup
tion by or on behalf of the govern
ment of tho United States In tho
transaction by which tho Panama
canal piopcrty was acquired from Its
French owners; that there wcro Im
proper dealings of somo Kind bo
tween agents of tho government ano
outsldo persons, representing or act
Ing for an American syndlcnto, which
had gotten possession of tho French
company; that among these persons
who It wns alleged mado "huge
profits," wero Mr. Chnrles P. Taft, r.
brother of Wljllnm H. Tnft, then can
dldatofr'fno presidency, and Mr
DouStas Robinson, my brother-in-law;
t Mr Cromwell, tho counsel for
tho Pnnnma canal company In the
negotiations, was In somo way Impli
cated with tho United States govern
ment authorities In these important
transactions; that tho government
has concealed the true facts, and has
destroyed or procured or agreed to
tho destruction of certain docu
ments, that Mr W. II. Taft was sec
rctarvfwar at tho time; that by an
ngrjrtMiient between tho United States
crnment and the beneficiaries of
tho deal all traces thereof were
"wiped out" by transferring all tho
archUcs and "secrets" to the Amer
ican government Just Ik .ore tho hold
ing of tno convention last June, at
which Mr Taft was nominated.
Say Stories Baseless,
Those statements sometimes ap
peared in the editorials, sometimes in
tho news columns, sometimes in the
shape i)f contributions from Indl
vlduaisV either unknown or known to
? 1 b4ot bad character They are false
fin everj pattlculnr from beginning to
end Tho wlcUedness of tho slanders
Is only surpassed by their fatuity So
utterly baseless aro tho btorles that
apparently they represent In part
merely material collected for cam-r-atgn
purposes, and In part storlo
originally concocted with a view of
possible blackmail, I
,Tho Iriventor of tho story nbnuti
Mr. Charles P, Taft, for Instance, evi-'
dently supposed that at some perlodl
bt tho Pnnama 'purchase Mr. W. Il.i
in reality Mr. W. H. Taft never be
came secretary of war until long
after the whole transaction in, ques
tion had been closed.
The Inventor of the story about Mr.
Douglas Hotdnson had not taken the
trpuble to And out the fact that Mr.
Itphinsou had not had tho slightest
connection, directly or indirectly, of
any kind or sort with any pause, of
trio Panama transaction from begin
ning to end. Tho men who attacked
Mr. Hoot In tho matter had not taken
the- ii&ubta to reailtba public docu
ments which would tnvu informed
Lrth
them that Mr. ltoot had nothing to do
with tho purchase, which was entire
ly arrnnged through tho department
of Justice, undor the then Attorney
General Mr. Knox. Now, those stories
as a mntter of fact need no Investiga
tion whatever. No shadow of proof
has been or can bo produced in be.
naif of nny of them. They conrlst
ilmply of u string of Infamous libels.
In form they nro in part libels upon
Individuals, upon Mr. Taft nnd Mr.
Hoblpson, for Instance. Dut thoy nro
in fact wholly nnd in form partly a
llhol upon the United States govern
ment. I do' not bcllevo wo should
u'eoncern ourselves with tho particu
lar Individuals who wroto tho lying
fund llbolmis editorials, articles from
correspondents or articles Jn tho
news columns. Tho real offender is
Mr. Joseph Pnlltrer, editor and prp
prlotor of tho World. While tho
criminal offense of which Mr. Pulit
zer has been guilty Is In form n llbql
upon individuals, the great Injury
dono Is In blnckenlng tho good namo
of tho American people. It should
not be left to a prlv&to citizen to sue
Mr. Pulitzer for libel. Ho'should bo
prosecuted for libel by tho govern
mental authorities, in point of en
courngoment of iniquity, In point of
infamy of wiong-dolng, there is noth
ing to chooso between a public ser
vant who betrays his trust, a public
servant who Is guilty of blackmail,
or theft, or financial dishonesty of
any kind, and n man guilty ns Mr.
Joseph Pulltzor has been guilty In
this Instance. It Is thcreforo a high
national duty to bring to justice this
vlllflcr of the American people, this
mnn who wantonly and wickedly,
without one shndow. of Justification,
seeks to blncken vt,lje character ot
reputable private citizens, and to con
vict the government of his own coun
try In the eyes of tho civilized world
of w"iong-dolng of tho basest and foul
est kind, when he hns not bnb Shadow
of justification of any sort or de
scription for the chargo lie' has macle.
Legal Action Threatened.
The attorney general has under
consideration the form In which tho
proceedings against Mr. Pulitzer shall
bo brought. Meanwhile, I submit to
you nil tho accompanying papers, so
that you may have before you com
plete Information on tho subject I
call your attention to my communica
tions In my messages to the congress
of Jan. 20. 1002; Mnrch 11, 1903; Dec.
1, 1903; Jan. 4, 1904, and Dec. IT
1900, in which I set forth at length
the history of various phases of tho
whole transaction. I recall your at
tention to the report and opinion of
the nttornoy general rendered to mc,
dated Oct. 25, 1902, with tho accom
panlng documents and exhibits. I
call your attention to the correspond
ence ot tho officers nnd ngents of the
Panama Canal company with tho
president and other officers of the
United States printed In Senato Docu
ment No. 34, Dec. 10, iy02 Also to
the copy of tho' official proceedings of
the Now Panama Canal company at
Paris on the 30th of December. 1903,
together with a report of tho council
of administration ot that company,
printed in Sennte Document No (33,
Jaji. 28, 1904. and to tho copy of the
general convoynnco by tho now Pan
rima Cannl company to tho United
States; also copies of certain tele
grams from tho president ot tho com
pany making an offer of snlo, and At
torney Goneral Knox's cablegram In
response, In Senate Documont No.
285, March 23, 1900.
1 call jour attention furthermore to
the exhaustive testimony recorded In
tho public document (Scnnto Docu
ment No. 401. Fifty-ninth Congress,
Second Session), which contains tho
searching investigation Into tho
whole transaction made by tho con
gress for Its Information and fully
considered by tho congress before It
took action. '
In the act approved June 2fi; 1902,'
"To Provide For tho Construction of
a Canal Connecting tho Waters of
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans," the
congicbs provided as follows:
"That thn presldont of the- United
States is heiijby nii(hol7.c(l tn nc
qufre for and on behalf of tho United
States, al ,a cost not exceeding $10,
000,000, tho rights, privileges, fran
chises, concessions, grants of land,
right of way, unfinished woik, plants
and other properly, real, personal
and mixed, of every name and nature,
owned by tho now Panama Canal
company of, France, on the Isthmus
of Pnnama, nnd all its maps, plans,
drawings, records, on tho Isthmus of
Panama and In Paris, Including ull
tho capital stock, not less, howevor,
than CS.CC3 shares of tho Panama
Railroad companj, owned by or held
for tho use and aid of tho canal com
pany, provided a satisfactory tltlo to
all said property can be obtained."
Shareholders of No Concern,
It thereupon becamo tho duty of
the pres'dent In execution of this
statute to purchaso the property
specified from tho New Panama
Canal company of Franco, provided
he could obtain a satisfactoty tltlo
The. depurtmqnt of Justice was In
structed to examine tho title and
nfter such an examination Attornoy
General Knox reported that n satis
factory tltlo could be obtained, Pay
ment of the purchase prlco was there
upon mado to the New Panama Canal
company, In accordanco with the ac(
of the congress, and tho property was
conveyed by that company to the
United States. It was no concern of
the president, or any officer of tho
oxecutlvo department, to inquire as
to what the New Panama Canal com
pany did with tho money which It ro-colvt-il.
As a matter of fact tho New
Panama Canj! company did dis
tribute the money between its share
holders nnd thn p'hundioldorH of the
preceding Pnnniim Cuiml company, in
accordance with tho decree of a
TUB MARION DAILY 'AftUROR TTOSPAY
French court, and the records of the
Fronch courts show who wcro tho
shareholders, who received tho
money; but that is no concorn ot
ours.
I call your attention to tho accom
panying statement as to tho attempt
to form htj Amo'lgait company, in
3899, for tho purpose of 'taking over
the property of tho French company.
This nttcmiUSpfoved abortive. There
was no concealment (n its effort to
put through thls plan; lis complete
failure nnd abandonment being known
to ever) one. Tho Important points sot
forth In the accompanying papers,
and in the papers to which I have
referred you, aro ns follows!
Tho Investigation of tho history,
physical condition nnd existing value
of tho enterprise by tho congress, re
sulting In tho enactment of the law
of 1902, authorizing tho president to
acquire tho property for tho sum of
$40,000,000 upon securing a satis
factory title and thereupon to under
take the work of construction; tho
falluro ot the Americanization of the
enterprise In 1899, tho transmission
by mo to the congress from time to
time of full Information nnd advice
as to the relations of this government
to transit across tho Isthmus nnd un
der tho trcatlos ns to the negotia
tions nnd final acquisition of the
title; and Inter ns to tho progress and
condition ot the work ot construction;
the previous authorization of the
sale to tho United States by tho stock

subsequent ratifications; the examina

Knox; tho arrangements for payment

ment, 'and tho payment accordingly
nt tho bank of France upon proper
offlclnl receipts to tho' liquidators act
ing under the decreoof the French
court, tho Fiench governmental body
having jurisdiction in tho matter;
PRESIDENT ftOOSEVELT,
and finally, the subsequent apportion
ment nnd distribution of tho fund to
tho creditors nnd stockholders of tho
two companies under tnat decree
The Panama Canal1 transaction was
actually carried through not by olthor
the then secretary of state, Mr. John
Hay, or the then secretary of war,
Mr Ellhu Root, both of whom how
ever wero cognizant of all tho es
sential features; but by the attorney
genoral, Mr. P. C Knox, nt present
senator from Pennsylvania. I di
rected or approved every notion anil
am responsible for nil that wad dono
In carrying out the will of tho con
gross; and tho provisions of the law
onnctod by congress, nfler exhaustive
examination nnd discussion, wore
scrupulously compiled with by tho ex
ecutive. Cromwell's Part.
Whllo tho transaction wns pending
I saw Mr, Cromwell but two, or throo
I tlmqs, and ny communications, wjh
nin were imiiqn io tne exchange or
purely fornml courtesies. Secretary
Hay occasionally saw "him, in ttltf
pamo manner; I doubt 'whether MK
Root held r.'ny conversation with him,
The attorney general saw him fre
nuontly, us ho was counsel for tho
Panama company Their communica
tions wrro official as lcprescntlng tho
two sides. I enclose copies of my
rqrrespondenco with Mr, William
Dudley Foulke, who first brought
these scandnlous sloiles to my atten
tion, nnd with Senator Knox and Mr.
Cromwell, to whom I wroto In re
sponse to the request of n gentleman
who wished to know about tho stock
holders in tho Panama Cnnai com
pany. Tho tltlo to the Panama Cannl pro
perties was vested In tho now Pana
ma Canal company of Franco, which
was the legal owner thereof, nnd tho
old or so-cnllcd Do-Lessop company
had a large equity therein.
Tho tltlo was not in a Now Jersey
company, nor In any other American
company, nor did this have' any deal
ings with any American company
throughout the nffalr. Tho oxact le
gal status, to tho most minuto detail,
appears In the exhaustive (opinion of
Attorney XJoneral Knox approving tho
title to bo given to the United States,,
which clearly cstabllshon, that, tho
only paity dealt with was tho New
Panama Canal company ,of France,
with, tho concuironco of tho liquida
tor of the old company, nnd not any
American corporation or syndicate.
Title Was Clear.
Tho action of the United Statos
government was, of course, wholly tin
Influenced by and had nothing what
ever to do with any question as to
who.weie, or who had been, tho so
curlty holders of either the new or
'the old company. Who such security
holdorH were was not fj(ir affairs. If,
as u matter of fact,, tho canal com
pany, cither or both, hud been own

DEOBMBIIR 16, IPOS',
ed by American citizens or by citi
zens ot nny other nationality, It
would not hayo altered in tho slight
est degrco tho action taken by this
govorpment, Our concern wns to got
the cannl proporty which was owned
by tho French company, nnd to see
that tho tltlo wns clear. Our transac
tions woro carried on openly, nnd
wcro published In detail, nnd wq
dealt solely (so far as tho Intorcsts
of tho othor Panama company woro
concerned) with tho liquidator ap
pointed by tho proper French gov
ernment body, tho civil tribunal ot
tho Solno, and in nccordanco with
the decrco of this same tribunal, with
the Now Panama Canal company,
which also went into liquidation upon
the sale to tho United States.
All our transactions wero carried
on openly and wero published in de
tail, Tho distribution of our payment
ot $40,000,000 follows tho award of
tho arbitrator chosen by tho now
company and tho liquidator, author
ized by tho decree of this samo civil
tribunal of tho Seine, and providing
for a dissemination of tho proportion
ate division between tho new and old
companies, Wo pnld the money
through tho New York banking houso
of Messrs. J, P. Morgan & Company,
acting as fiscal ngonls of this govern
ment, into tho Bank of Franco in
Paris. The receipts and accounts of
our trensury department show tho
payment of tho monoy into tho Bank
of Franco nnd account for the money
being paid over to tho liquidator ap
pointed by the civil tribunal of thn
Solno and to tho New Panama Cannl
company of France, the proportion ot
the $10,000,000 being 128,C0O,0dO
francs to the liquidator of tho old
company and 77,400,000 franqs to tho
New Pannina Cnnal company of
Franco in liquidation. In these pay
ments wo followed tp thq letter tho
decrco of the governmental tribunal
of France, which lind thq authority to
mako sucn a decree, tho clVIl tribunal
of tho Seine. We had nelthol4 dei're
nor authority to' go behind this do
crco i of i this proper governmental
body, asi all the, conflicting rights ot
the security holders of both com
panies had been settled by tho decren
of said court by ratifications or arbi
tration which resulted in that divi
sion, Distribution of the Money.
I wish to make as clear ns possible
and ns emphatic as posslblo the
statement that we did not have any
thing to do with the distribution of
a dollar of tho $10,000,000 we paid as
regards any stockholder or" bond
holder of the French companies, save
that wo followed out tho award of the
arbitrators appointed in accordance
with tho decree of the French court
which had dealt with tho subject in
awarding a proportion to the old
company and n certain proportion to1
tho new compnny. Any question con
cerning tho stockholders, bondhold
ers or other bcnoflclarics ot the pro
ceeds of salo was purely a question
for the civil tribunal of the Solno, tho
French governmental body, with
which t,hls nation had nothing what
ever to do. Under those circum
stances thcro was not tho slightest
need for Mr. Cromwell to glvo nny
Information on the subject of tho
compnny for which ho had been coun
sel. This government has no con
cern with Mr. Cromwell's relation to
thrsc companies, or cither of thorn,
or with tho amount of his profession
al compensation. It was not tho nf
falr of this government to inqulro
who wcro tho security holders of tho
companies. Nevertheless, of his own
accord, ho has submitted to mo, to
gether with n copy of his statement
published on tho 11th Instant, and
which I transmit herewith, a full list
of the stockholders of tho New Pnn
nma cannl company of Franca on
Jan. ID, 1900 (numbering over 0,000),
nnd a list of all stockholders who
woro present nt a special meeting of
tho 'compnny hold Fob. 28, 1902, Im
mediately nftbr tho cable offer of tho
company was mado to tho United
States (Jan. 9-11, 1902), to accept the
npprrjsoment of $40,000,000 mddo by
tho Isthmian canal commission, and
to sell for '.mi d sum the Pnnnma
canal, concessions pnd other prop
erty, nnd tho shares of tho Panama
Railroad company, He hpa.nls fur
nished mo n certlflji-d copy of the flna'
report of tho liquidator of the old
company, which was filed on Juno
25th last, and formally approved by
tho civil tribunal of tho Solno, to
gether with a summary account pio"
pared and signed by said liquidator
as lato ns the 24th ultimo.
I also transmit n translation ot
tho two resolutions with tho vote
upon them, adopted at a meeting ot
tho stockholders of tho now compnny
held on April 23, 1901, for the purpose
of finally ratifying tho salo. All these
documents I herewith transmit as a
part of this message.
No Payments On Old Stock,
It appears from them that tho
creditors of tho old company number
220,290 parties who hnvo received
dividends out of the funds in tho
hands of tho liquidator, who In his let
ter states that In this present month
of December tho second and last dis
tribution to tho creditors will bo be
gun, and that tho nvcrngq dividend
heretofore paid to each Individual
was 782 francs, or $iC(S. No pay
ment whatovor was or will be made
upon the stock of the old compnny, as
it was worthless from tho day De
I'esseps failed and this cuts out from
consideration nil mlslondlng state
ments regard lily a possible purchaso
by anybody df tho stock of tho Old
Panama Cabal company, It has not
received and will not jocelve a penny.
Even upon the bonded indebtedness,
the the dividend, I am thus Informed,
will amount In tho aggregate to only
about ten per centum. It IlknwWo

Tho New Pannina Canal company
of Franco is in liquidation, as tho ac
companying papers set foith. This
liquidated company received ns its
proportion of the $10,000,000 tho Bum
of 77,000,000 franco nnd this was
distributed by the liquidation in thrco
payments through .four leading banks
of Paris, roverlng a period of the
past folir years nnd to shareholders
numbering nbout C.000. Every stop
of the transaction was not only taken
publicly but was contemporaneously
therewith advertised In the legal and
flnnnclnl papers or France, nnd the
banks mnk'.ug tho payments tool:
proper receipts from nil the parties
to whom payments wcro made, 'as IS,
customary In such cases. i
Tho capital of the New I'lin'ania,

made amounted to nboutjlHO francs
on each 'share 6fl00 francs. Noi'dlvf!

The accounts and records of this

Credit Lyonnnlso of Paris as a proper
custodian of tho same, nppolntcd up
on such liquidation. Recently a re
quest was mndo by n prlvato indi

payments, but answer wns mado by

reason for granting such lequcst by

As u mntter of fact there is notli

Now Panama Canal coiripnny of
iFrance did not Itsolf iropoSO to fix
tho figure, $40,000,000, as tho valua
tion of tho canal and rnilrdml proper

of in'vestlgalidn and porsopnl ipefiqc

and tho work dono woro in detail ap
praised ut that sum us their value to
tho United Statos, Tho Fronch com
pany steadily refused for over two
yoars to mako any offer whatever In
answer to tho mnny written lequosts
of tho Isthmian canal commission,

This government thoreforo acquir
ed all the properties and concessions

to printing them, save that It la a use
