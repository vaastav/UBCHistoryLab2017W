There bw been impcaeJ upon the Executive
branch of the jfjrernrnent the execution
of the act o< Con^reta, approved
April 30.1371, and commonly known u
the Ku Klux law.
In % f?ortiuo of the Sure of South Carolina.
the ntcuteily of the courtc pursued
will t/fc (luii./04Uaacii by the report of the
committee t/? invta^jate the Southern
outrage*. Uaier the pruvi*ioos ot the
above act, I iatu&l a proclamation calling
the auention ot the peeple of the United
but** to the urne, and declaring my reluctance
to execute any o< the extraordinary
power* thereby conferred upon me
exeept in cue of imperative netxaaity,
bat making known my purpose to exercise
such powers whenever it thouiJ become
necmary Uj do so lor the parmae
of tecuring tu all rritizens of the United
^Stales the peaceful enjoyment of
(be right* guarantied to them by the
Coostiluliuo %nJ Che Uwe. AfU r the
pMMge oi thU law, information was received
from lime to time that combination*
id the character referred to in thii
law exuted and were powerful in many
pert* of the Southern btates, particularly
in certain counties in the State of South
Carolina. Careful investigation was
made an J it ?u ascertained that in nine
cocntks "t thai bUUs such combination*
were active ami powerful, embracing a
Aijffir-icni portion the citizens to control
the loyal authority, and Laving,
anw?g other things, the object of depriving
the emancipated cla?s of the suUitantul
benefits ol freedom ami of preventing
the free |tr*litu^al action of thoae citizens
who did not sympathize with their
own views. Among the Kepublicans
there were frequent scourging* and occasional
assassinations. These were generally
perpetrated at night hy disguised
persons, the victim* io almost all eases
being citizens of different political sentiment*
from their own, or freedfpersons
who ha/1 shown a disposition to claim
e<|oal ri^hu witli other citizen*. Thousands
of inoffensive and well-disposed
citizens were sufferers by this lawless
violence;. Thereupon on the .'50th of October,
1*71, a proclamation was issued In
terms oj the law, calling upon the member*
of the combinations to disperse within
live days, and to deliver to the marshal or
military officers of the United States
all arms, ammunitions, uniforms, disguises
and other means and implement*
used by them lor carrying out
their unlawful purpute*. This warning
not having been heeded, on the l?th of
October another proclation was issued,
suspending the writ of habtaJ corpus in
nine counties in that State. Direction
wu given that within the counties so
designated persons supposed, upon reliable
information, to be members of fucli
unlawlul combinations, should be arrested
by tho military forcers ol the United
tttates and delivered to the Marshal to be
dealt with according to law. In two of
said counties?York snd Bpartanburg?
many arrests have been made. At the
last account the number of persons tlins
arreted was one hundred and sixtyeight
; several hundred whose criminality
was ascertained to be of an inferior de
KSe" have generally made 'confes-|
sions of their guilt. urcat caution has
been exercised In making these arrests,
awl notwithstanding tbe large number,
It In believed that no Innocent peraon la
now in custody. Tbc prisoners will be
held lor regular trial before tbc Judicial
tribunal* or the United States. As toon
at It appeared that tbo authorities of tbe
United 8 la Us were about to take vigorous
measure* to enforce tbe law, man; persona
absconded, am] tberc is good ground
for supposing tbat all sucb persons bare
violated Uie law. A full report of what
has been dona under tbl? law will be submitted
to Congress by tlio Attorney Ucn
eral.
THE MORMON qcmiou.
In Utah there still remains a remnant
if Iwrbsriatn repugnant to civilisation,
decency nml to tbo laws of tbo United
Htates. Territorial olilcuni, however,
liavo been limnd wbo aro willing to per
form their duly In spite of equity and
with a due sense of sustaining the majesty
of tbe law. Neither [Kilygsmy nor any
other violation of tlio existing statutes
will lie permitted within the territory of
the United Htatca. It is not with the religion
of tlio self-styled Bainta that we
aro dealing, but their practices. They
will be protected In the worship of Ooil
according to the dictates ot their consciences,
but they will not be permitted
to violate laws under tbe cloak of religion.
It may be advisable for Congress
to consider what in tbo execution of the
laws against polygamy Is to be the status
of plural wives and their offspring. Tbe
probability of Congresa passing ah enabling
set authorizing the territorial Icgis
latum or Utah, to legitimatize prior to
Uio passage of the Act, might ta justified
by im humanity to these innocent children.
This is a suggestion only, and not
a recommendation.
THP. INDIAN rROBT.Mt.
The policy pursued towards the Indiana,
ha* resulted favorably bo fur as can
bojndged from the limited timo during
which It has lieen In operation. Through
the eiertlons of the varions societies of
Christiana to whom it has been entrusted,
the execution of the policy and the Board
of Commissioners, authorized by the law
of April 101b, 1800, many tribes of Indians
hare l>een induced to settle npon
the reservations to cultivate the
soils and perform productive labor
of various kinds, and to partially accept
clriliiation. Ther are being cared
lor in such a way it Is hoped as to indnce
those still pursuing their old habits of
life to embrace the only opportunity
which is left them to avoid extermination.
I recommend liberal appropriations to
carry out tho Indian |?eace policy, not
l>ccau*e it is humane, christinnlike and
religious, but l?ecause it is right I recommend
to your favorable consideration
also the policy of granting n territorial
government to the Indians in the Indian

because sll these figures are in the
accompanying reports, or in those presented

avxkct pob the soctb.
More tban ill years baring elspted
since tbe Isst hostile gun was firai between
the arrnis tben arrayed against
each other for the perpetuation or tor the
destruction ol the Union, it may well be
coniiikrwl whether H is not now time
that the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth
Amendment should bo removed.
That amendment does not exclude the
ballot, but only requires the disability to
hold office of certain classes. When the
purity of the tullot is secure, majorities
are sure to elect officers reflecting the
views of the majority. I dot see the advantage
or propriety of excluding men
from office merely becausc they were
men before the rebellion of standing and
character sufficient to be elected to positions
requiring them to take an naUi to
support the Constitution, and admitting to
eligibility those entertaining precisely the
same views, but of less standing In the
community. It may be said that the former
violated an oath, while the latter did
not. The latter did Dot have it in their
power to do so. If they had taken this
oath, it cannot be doubted that they
would have broken it, as did the former
class. If there arc any criminals distinguished
above all others in the part
they took in opposition to the government,
they might, in the judgment of
Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty.
This subject is submitted filt
your careful consideration. The condition
ol the Southern States is, unhappily,
not such as all true patriotic citizens
would like to ice. [Social ostracism, for
opinion's sake, persona! vlolenco or threat
tnwurd* nenutns i ntertalnini? nolilicai
views oppov.il to IIiom entertained by
the majority of the old citizen*, prevents
immigration and the flow of much needed
capital into the .Stales lately la rebellion.
It will be a happy condition of tbc country
when tbc old citizens of these States
will take an Intercut Id public affairs, promulgate
tbeir ideaa honestly entertained,

permit the same freedom of eiprwsion

TUB DISTIIIOT or Oil,UKIlli.
Under the provisions of tlio act of Congress,

Territorial Government was organized in
the District of Columbia. Its rtsulta
thus fur have fully realized the expectstionsof
Its advocates, linder the direction
ol the territorial nUlcers a system of
Improvements hH lieen inaugurated, by
means of which Washington is rapidly
becoming a city worthy of the nation *
capital. The citizens of the liistricl having
voluntarily taxed themselves ina^largo
amount lor tho |*irpnse of Contriliuflng to
the advancement of the seat of government
I recommend liliettl appropriations on
the part ol Congress in order that the Government
may bear lis Just shsre of the expense
of carrying out a judicious system
ol Improvement*. Hy the great lire in
Chicago, the most important ol Uie
Government building! In that city were
consumed. Those burned had already
become inadequate to the wants of the
Government in that growing city, and
looking to the near luture, were totally inadequate.
1 recommend, therefore, that
an appropriation lie mills immediately to
purchase the remainder of thasquare on
which the burned buildings stood, provided
It can be purchased al a fair valuation,
nnd provided Uic Legislature ol Illinois
will pass a law authorizing Its condemnation
for Government inirposts: and
also an appropriation of as inucU Money
as can prf?perljr l>o ox ponded towards tho
