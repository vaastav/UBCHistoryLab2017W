BKJTlirXCENCK OF BBFTJBLICAN GOYIB.K
HENT "
'The occasion ot the 24' h election ot
Chief Magistrate has afforded another op
poitunity jo the people of the United States
to exhibit to the world a significant exam
ple of peaceful and safe transmission of the
power and authority ot the government
Irom the public servants whose terms ot
office are about to expire to their newly
cboeen successors. This anple
eannot fail to Impress profoundly
the thoughtful people of other
countries, with the advantages which re
publican institutions afford. The immedi
ate, general and cheerful acquiescence of
all good citizens in the result of the elec
tion gives gratitjing assurance to our
country, and to its friends throughout the
world, that a government bated on the free
consent of an intelligent and patriotic peo
ple possesses elements of strength, stability
and permanency not found in any other
toim ot government.
sotjthkkn rpposition to full freedom
of c.lobed citizens.
The continued opposition tojtbe full and
free enjo ment ot the rights of citizenship
conferred upon the colored people by the
recent amendments to the Constltution.still
prevails in several oi the late slave-holding
States. It has, pet haps, not been mani
fested in the recent election to any large
extent in acts of violence and intimidation.
It has, however, by fraudulent practices in
connection with the ballots, with the regu
lations as to the places and manner
of voting, and with counting, re
turning and canvassing the votes
cast, been successful in defeating the
exercise of the right preservative of all
rights, the right of suffrage, which the
Constitution expressly confers upon our en
franchised citizens- It is the desire of the
good people of the whole country that sec
tionalism as a factor in our politics should
disappear. They prefer that no section of
the country should be united in
solid opposition to any other sec
tion. The disposition to refuse a
prompt and nearty obedience to
the equal rights amendments to the Consti
tution is all that now stands in the w y of
a complete obliteration of sectional lines in
our political contests. As long as either of
these amendments is flagrantly violated
or disregarded, it is safe to assume that the
people who placed them in the constitu
tion as embodying the legitimate results ot
the war for the Union, and who believe
them to be wise and necessary, will con
tinue to act together, and to insist that
they shall be obeyed. The paramount
question still is, as to the et j yment
of the right, by every American
citizen who b as the requisite qualifications,
to ireely cast his vote and to have it hon
estly counted. With this question rightly
settled, the country will be relieved f the
contentions of the past. Uy-gones will in
deed be by gones, and political and party
issues with respect to the economy and effi
ciency of the administration of internal
improvements, the tarff. domestic educa
tion, finance and other important surjects.
will then receive their full share of atten
tion. But resistance to and nullification of
the results of the war, will unite together
in resolute purpose tor their support all
who maintain the authority of the govern
ment and the perpetuity of the
Union, and who adquaielv appreciate
the value of the victory achieved. This
determination is produced from no hostile
sentiment or feeling to tiny part of the peo
ple of our country, or to any ot their inter
ests. AMKKBHESTS to th constitution xk-
YIOABLK.
The inviolability ot the Amendments
rests upon the fundamental principle of
our government; they are the solemn ex
pression of the will cf the people of the
United States. The sentiment that the
constitutional right of all our citizens must
be maintained does not grow weaker ; it
will continue to control tne government of
the country. Happily the history of the
late election shows that in many part9 of
the country where opposition to the fifteenth
amendment has heretofore prevailed it is
diminishing, and is likely to cease alto
gether if firm and well considered action
is taken by Congress. I trust the House of
Representatives and the Senate, which
have the right to judge of the election re
turns and qualifications ot their own mem
bers, will tee to it that every case of viola
tion of the letter or spirit of the fifteen' h
amendment is thoroughly investigated,
and that no benefit from such vio
lation shall accrue to acy per
son or party. It will be the duty of the
Executive, with sufficient appropriations
for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly
all who have been engaged in depriving
citizens of the rights guaranteed them by
the Constitution. It is not, however, to be
forgotten that the best and surest guarantee
of the primary rights of citizenship is
to be found in that capacity lor
self protection, which can only belong to
a people whose rieht to universal suffrage
is supported by universal education.
POPULAB EDUCATION
The means at the commsndof the loca
and State authorities are in many cases
wholly inadequate to furnish free instruc
tion to all bo need it. This is especially
true, where, before emancipation, the edu
cation of the people was neglected or pre-
vented in the interest of slavery.
Firmly convinced that the surject of
popular education deserves the earnest atl
tention of tte people ot the whole country,
with a view to wise and comprehensive
action by the government of the United
States, I respectfully recommend that Con
gress, by suitable legislation, and with
proper safeguards, supplement the local
educational funds in the several States,
where the grave duty and responsibility of
citizenship have been devolved on unedu
cated people, by appropriations from the
Treasury ot the United Slates. Whatever
government can fairly do to promote free
and popular education ought to be done.
Wherever general education is found,
peace, virtue, and social order prevail and
religious liberty is secure.
CIVIL BEBYICK BEFOBH.
In my former annual message I have
asked the attention ot Congress to the ur
gent necessity of a reformation of the civil
system ot tba government. My views con
cerning the dangers of patronage, appoint
ments tor personol or pai tisan consideration
have been strengthened by mv obsrvation
and experience in the executive office, and
I -believe these dangers threaten the sta
bility of the goverment. Abuses bo serious
in their nature cannot be permanenly
tolerated, they tend to become more
alarming with the enlargement of the ad
ministrative set vice. As the growth of the
country in population increases the num
ber of officers and placemen employed, the
reasons are imperative for the adaption of
fixed rules for the regulation of appoint
ments, promotions, and removals, estab
lishing (a nniform method, having exclu
sively in view in every instance the attain
ment of the best qualifications for the po
sition ia question, such a method alone is
consistent with the equal rights of all citi
zens, and the most economical and efficient
administration of the public business.
COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.
Competitive eliminations and Im
partial appoint Joents and promotions have
been conducted for some years past in sev
eral of the executive departments, and by
my direction this system has been adopted
ia the custom bouses and postofOceaof the
larger cities of the country. In the city of
New York over two thousand positions in
the civil service have been subject, in their
appointments and tenure of place, to the
the operation of published rules
tor this purpose. During the
past two years the results of these practical
trials have been very satisfactory and have
confirmed my opinion ta favor ot tnis sys
tem of selection. Ail are suojeciea io me
same tests, and the result is free from prju
dice by personal favor or partisan influ
ence. It secures for the position appnea
for the best qualifications attainable among
the comrjetlnff aDPiicanis ii is an eiieciusi
protection from the pressure ot important
ties, which, uoder any other coarse pur
sued, largely exacts tb time and attention
of the aDDointincr officers to, their treat
detriment, in the discharge of other f fflcial
duties, preventing the abuse of service for
the mere furthetance ot private or party
purposes, and leaving the employe of the
government treed from the obligations im
posed by patronage, to depend solely upon
merit for retention and advancement. With
ibis constant incentive to exertion and im
provem ent. these in valubie results haven e i
attained In a higher degree in the uffi.es
where the rules tor appointment by com
petitive examination have been applied. A
method which has so approved itself by
experimental tests at points where such
tests may be fairly considered conclusive,
should be extended to a 1 subordinate post
tions under the Government. I believe
that a strong and growing public senti
ment demands immediate measures for se
curing and en'orcing the highest possible
tmciency in the civil service and
its protection from recognized abuses,
and that the experience referred to has
demonstrated the least bility of such meas
ures. The examinations in the custom
bouses and postoffices have been held un
der many embarrasments and without pro
vision for compensation tor the extra labor
performed by the officers who have con
ducted them, and whose commendable in
terest in the improvement of the publie
service has induced this devotion of time
and labor without pecuniary reward A
continuance of these labors gratuitously
ougnt not to oe expeciea, ana wunout an
appropriation by Congress for compensa
tion it is not practicable to extend
the system or examinations gener
ally throughout the civil service. It
is also highly important that all
such examinations should be conducted
upon a unilorm system, and nnder general
supervision. Section 1.753 of the Revised
Statutes authorizes the President to pre
scribe the regulations for admission to the
civil service of the United States, and tor
this purpose to employ suitable persons to
conduct the requisite inquires with refer
ence to the fitnebS ot each candidate in re
spect to age, health, character knowledge
and ability for the branch ot service into
which he seeks to enter, but the law is
practically inoperative for want of the re
quisite appropriation. I therefore recom
mend an appropriation of $25 000 per an
num to meet the expecses ot a Commis
sion, to be appointed by the President, in
accordance with the terms of ibis Section,
whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uni
form ana emctent system ot competitive
examinations and to suppervise the appli
cation ot the same throughout the entire
civil seivice ot the government
I am persuaded that the facilities which
such a Commission will afford for testing
the ntoess ot those wno apply for office wilt
not only be a welcome relief to members ot
Congress, as it will be to the President an J
beads of departments; bnt that it will also
greatly tend to remove the causes ot em
barrassment which now inevitably and
constantly attend the conflicting claims ot
patronage between the legislative and exe
cutive departments. The most effectual
check upon the pernicious competition of
incoences and official favoritism in the be
stowal of offices will be the substitution of
an open competition of merit between the
applicants, in which every one can make
bis own record with the assurance that his
success will depend upon this alone.
PARTY ASSESSMENTS AND THE SPOILS 8TS-
TEM.
I also recommend such legislation, as,
while leaving every i fficer as tree as any
other citizen to express his political opin
ion, and to use his means for their ad
vancement, shall also enable him to feel as
safe as any other citizen In refusing all
demands upon bis salary for political pur
poses A law which should thus guarantee
true liberty ana justice to all who are en
gaged in the public service, and likewise
contain stringent provisions against
the use of official authority to
coerce the political action of pri
vate citizens, or ot official subordi
nates, is greatly to be desired. Tne most
serious obstacle however to an improve
ment oi the civil service, and especially to
a reform in the method of appoin ment and
removal, has been found to be the practice
under what is known as the spoils system,
by which the appointing power has been
so largely encroached upon by members
of Congress. The first step in
the reform of the civil service
must be a complete divorce between Con
gress and the Executive in the matter of
appointments. The corrupting doctrine
that to the victors belong the spoils is in
separable from Congressional patronage
as the established rule and practice of
parties in power. It comes to be under
stood by applicants for office and by the
people generally, that Representatives and
Senator are entitled to disburse the pa'ron
aee of their respective Districts and States.
It is not necessary to recite at length the
evils resulting from thin invasion ot the
Executive functions. The trne principles
ot government, on the subject of appoint
ments to omce, as stated in the .National
conventions of the leading paries of
the country, have again and again been a
approved by the American people and have
noi been called in question in any quarter.
These authentic expressions of public
opinion upon this alt important subject sre
the statements of principles that belong to
constitutional structure of the government.
Under the Constitutiou the President and
heads ot departments are to make nomina
tion for office, the Senate is to advice and
consent to the appointments, and the House
of Representatives is to accuse and prose
cute faithless officers. The best in
terest of the public service de
mands that these distinctions be preserv
ed ; that Senators and Representatives whs
may ledges and accusers should not dic
tate appointments to office " To this end
the cooperation of the legislative
department of the government is re
quired, alike by the necessities of the
case ana by purine opinion. Mem
bers of Congress will not be relieved from
tbe demands made upon them with refer
ence to appointments to omce, until by
legislative enactment the pernicious prac
tice is condemned and forbidden. It is
therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the - relations of
members of Congress with respect to ao-
F ointments to office by the President, and
also recommend that the provisions of
section 1767, and of tbe sections following,
of the Revised Statutes comprising the ten
ure of office, act of March 2, 1887, be re
pealed. Believing that to reform the sys
tem and methods of tbe Civil Service in
our country is one of tbe highest and most
imperative duties of states manehi p. and
that it can be permanently done only by the
co-operation of the legislative and execu
tive departments of the governnent, I
again commend tbe whole subject to your
considerate attention.
J SUPPRESSION OF POLTGAMT.
It is the recognized duty and purpose of
the people ot the United States to suppress
polygamy where it now exists in our Ter
ritories, and to prevent its extension.
Faithful and zealous efforts have been
made by tbe Uaited States authorities in
Utah to enfore tbe laws against it. Expe
rience has shown that the legislation upon
this subject, to be effective, requite exten
tensive modification and amendment The
longer action is delayed the more difficult
it will be to accomplish what is
desired. Prompt and decided measures
are necessary. Tbe Mormon sectarian or
ganization, which upholds polygamy, has
the whole power of making and executing
tbe local legislation ot tbe t erritory. By
its control of the grand and petit juries it
possesses a large influence over the admin
istration of justice. Exercising, as the
heads ot this sect do, the local political
powers of tbe Territory, they are aole to
make effective their hostility to the law of
Congress on tbe subject of polygamy, and
in fact do prevent its enforcement. I iyg
amy will not be abolished if tbe enforce
ment of tho law depends on those who
practice and uphold tbe crime It can
only be suppressed by taking away tbe po
Iitical power ot tbe sect which encourages
and upholds it. The power of Congress to
euact suitable laws to protect the territories
is ample. It is not a case fer half-way
measures. The political power
of the Mormon "sect" is increas
ing. It controls now one of our
wealthiest and most populous territories.
It is extending steadily into other territo
ries, and where ever it goes it establishes
polygamy and sectarian political power.
The sanctity ot marriage and the family
relation are the corner stone ot our Ameri
can society, and civilization, rcligous lib
erty and the separation ot church and state
are amoiig tbe elementary ideas of free in
stitutions. To reestablish the interests and
principles which polygarry and Mormon-
ism have imperilled, and to fully re open
to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of
all creeas mar, part oi our domain
which has been In a great degree
closed to general immigration by iutolerant
and immoral institutions, it is recommend
ed that the government of the Territory of
Utah be reorganizea. l recommend that
Congress provide tor tbe government of
Utah by a Governor, Judges or Commis
bioners appointed by the President and
conurmea by tne senate, a government
analogous to the provisional government
established for the territory north west of
the Ohio by the ordinance ot 17S7 If.
however, it is deemed best to continue the
existing form of local government, I rtcom
mend that the right to vote, hold office and
sit on iurits in the Territory of Utah be
confined to those who neither practice nor
uphold polygamy. If thorough measures
are adopted. It is believed that within a
tew years tbe evils which now affect Utah
will be eradicated, and that this Territory
will in good time become one of the most
prosperous atd attractive ot the new States
of the Union.
THE FISHERY QUESTION AND FOBTUNK BAT
AFFAIR
Our relations wan all foreign countries
have been those of undisturbed peace and
have presented no occasion for concern as
to their continued maintt nance
My anticipation ot an early reply from
tbe British government to tne demand ot
indemnity to our fishermen for tbe injuries
suffered by that industry at Fortune, Bay,
in January, 1S78, which I expressed in my
last annual message, was disappointed
This answer was received only in the latter
part of April ia the present year, and when
received exhibited a failure of accord be
tween the two gove-nments as to the meas
ure of the im-hore fishing privilege, secur
ed to our fisherman by tbe treaty
of Washington, of so serious a char
acter that I made it tbe
subject of a commnnication in Congress in
which I recommended tbe adoption of
measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this government in maintenance
of the rights accorded to our fishermen
under tbe treaty, and towards securing an
indemnity for the injury these interests
had suffered. A bill to carry out these
recommendations was uoder consideration
by the House of Representatives at tbe
time of the adjournment cf Congress in
June last. Within a few weeks I have re
ceived a communication from Her Majes
ty's government renewing the considera
tion of the sul ject, both of the indemnity
from tbe injuries at Fortune Bay, and of
tbe interpretation of the treaty, in which
the previous correspondence bad shown tbe
two governments to be at variance. Upon
both these topics tbe disposition towards a
friendly agreement is manifested by a rec
ognili m of our right to an indemnity tor
tbe transaction at Fortune Bay. leaving tbe
measure of such indemnity to a fu.ther
conference, and by an assent to tbe view of
this government presented in tbe previous
correspondence, that the regulation of con
flicting interests of the shore fishery of the
Provincial sea coast, and the vessel fishery
of our fishermen, should be made the sub
ject of confeience and concurrent arrange
ment between the two governments. I
sincerely hope that the bases may by found
for a speedy adjustment of the very serious
divergence "ot views in the interpretation
of tbe fishery clauses ot the Treaty ot
Washington ; which, as the correspondence
between the two governments stood at tbe
close of the last session ot Con
gress seemed to be irreconcilable.
INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION AT NEW SOUTH
WALES
In the important exhibition of arts and
industries which was held last year at Sid
ney, New South Wales, as well as in that
now in progress at Melbourne, tbe Uaited
States have been efficiently and honorably
represented. Tne exhibitors from this
country at the former place received a large
number of awards in some of the most
considerable departments, and the partici
pation of the United Siates was recognized
by a special mark of distinction. In the
exhibition at Melbourne tbe share taken
by our country is no less notable, and an
equal degree of success is confidently ex
pected. OTHER FOREIGN RELATIONS
The sUte of peace and tranquility now
erjjojed by the continent of Europe, has its
influence upon our diplomatic and com
mercial relations. We have concluded
and ratified a convention with the French
Republic for the settlement of claims of tbe
citizens of either country against tbe other.
Uoder this convention a Commission, pre
sided over by a distinguished publicist,
appointed in pursuance of tbe request of
both cations, by his majesty the Emperor
of Brazil has been organized, and has be
gan its sessions in this city. A Congress to
consider means tor the protection of indus
trial property has recently been in session
in fans, to which I have appointed the
ministers of tbe United States in France
and in Belgium as delegates. The Inter
national Commission upon weights and
measures also continues its work in Paris
I invite your attention to tbe necessity of
an appropriation t be made in time to en
able this government to comply with its
obligations under tbe metrical convention.
Our friendly relations with the German
Empire continue without interruption At
the recent International Exhibition of Fish
and Fisheries at Berlin, tbe oarticiDation
of the United 8tates, notwithstanding tbe
haste with which the commission was
forced to make Preparations, was
extremely successful and mentor.
iou8, winning tor private exhibitors
numerous awards of a high class, and lor
the country at large tbe principle prize of
honor offered by his majesty the emperor.
The results of this great success cannot but
w aaxantageous to this' important ana
growing industry. . ' i
mere have .been, , spme , ; questions
raised between the' two governments as
to the proper effact and interpretation of
our treaties of naturalization, but recent
despatches from our minis.er at Berlin
show that favorable progress is making
toward an understanding in accordance
with tbe views of ibis government, which
makes and admits no distinction whatever
between tbe rights ot a native, and a
naturalized citizen of th United Siates, in
practice. The complaints of molestation
tufiered by naturalized citizens abroad
hve never been fewer than at present
There is nothing of importance in our
unbroken friendly relations with tbe gov
ernments of Austria, Hungary, Russia.
Portugal, Sweden and Norway. Switzer
land, Turkey and Greece Dmlngthe last
summer several vessels belonging to tbe
merchant marine of this country, sailing
in neutral waters of the West Indies, were
area at, boarded and searched by an armed
cruiser of the Spanish government The
circumstances as repotted involve not only
a private injury to the persons concerned, but
alo seemed too little obseivant of the
friendly relations existing for a century be
tween this country aud Spun. The wrong
was brought to tne attention of the Spanish
government in a serious protest ana re
monstrance; the matter is undergoing in
vestigation by Koyal authorities with a
view to such explanation or reparation as
may be called lor. Tbe Commissson sitting
in this city lor the adjudication
of the claims ot our citizens
against the government of Spain,
is, I hope, approaching the termination ot
its labors. The claim against the United
Siates under the Fionda treaty with Spain
were submitted to Congress for its action
at the late session, and I again invite your
attention to the long standing question
with a view to a final disposition of the
matter. At the invitation ot tbe Spanish
government a conference has recently been
held at tbe city of Madrid to consider the
surject of promotion by foreign powers ot
tbe native Moors in the iu npire ot Morocco
Tbe Minister of the United States in Spain
was directed to take part in the
deliberations of this conference, the
result of which is a convention signed on
behalf of all the powers represented. The
instrument will be laid before the Senate
for its consideration The government oi
the Uaited States has lost no opportunity
to urge upon that ot the Emperor of Mo
rocco the necessity, in accordance with the
humane and enlightened spirit of the age,
of the putting an end to tbe persecutions,
which have been so prevalent in that
country, of a faith other than tbe Moslem;
and especially of the Hebrew resdenta of
Morocco.
Tbe consular treaty concluded with
Belgium has not yet been officially pro
mulgated owing to tbe ai eration of a
word in tbe text by tbe Senate of the United
States, which occasioned a delay during
which the lime allowed for its ratification
expired. Tbe Senate wilt be asked to ex
tend the period lor ratification.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex
tradition with Denmark has tailed
en account of tbe objection of
the Danish government to the usual
clause - providing that each Nation
should pay tbe expense of the arrest of the
persons whose extradition it asks.
The provision made by Congress at its
last session for tbe expense of the Commis
sion which bad been appointed to enter
upon negotiations with tne Imperial Gov
ernment ot China on subjects of treat in
terest to the relations ot the two
countries, enabled the commissionets
to proceed at once upon their
mission. The I m peri am Government
was prepared to give prompt anr1; respect
ful attention to toe matters brought under
negotiation, and the conferences proceeded
with such rapidity success that on the 17th
of November last two treaties were signed
at Pekin ; one, relating to tho introduction
of the Chinese into this country, and one
relating to commerce. Mr. Trescott. one
of the commissioners is now on bis way
home bringing tbe treaties, and it is ex
pected that they will be received in sea on
to be laid betore the Senate early in Janu
ary. Oar minister in Japan has negotiat
ed a convention for the reciprocal
relief of shiprecked seamen. I take oc
cation to urge upon Congress .he propri
ety of makiog provision for tbe erection of
suitable fire proot buildings at the Jap
anese capital for tbe me ot the American
Legation and tbe court house and jail con
nected with it The Japanese government,
with great generosity and curtesy, has
offered for this purpose an eligible piece of
land.
In my last annual message I invited the
attention of Congress to the subject of tbe
indemnity lunds received some years ago
from China and Japan. I renew tbe rec
ommeodsdion then made that whatever
portions ot thcte funds are due to Ameri
can citizens should be promptly paid, and
tbe residue returned to the nations respect
ively to which they justly and equitably
belo'og.
Tbe extradition treaty with the Kingdom
of the Netherlands, which has been for
some time in tbe course ot negotiation, has
during the past year been concluded and
duly ratified.
Relations of friendship and amity have
been established between the government
of the United States and that ot Roumania
We have a representative to Bucharest and
have received at this capital the special
envoy who has been charged by his Koyal
Highness, Prince Ubarles, to announce tbe
independent sovereignty of Roumania, and
we hope fur a speedy development ot com
mercial relations between tbe twocountries.
MEXICAN AND SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS
In my last aunual message I expresstd
the hope that the prevalence of quiet on
the border between this country and Mex
ico would Boon become so assured as to
justify the modification of the order, then
in force, to our military commanders, 11
regard crossing the frontier without en
couraging such disturbances as would en
danger the peace ot tbe two countries.
Events moved in accordance with these
expectations and the orders were according
ly withdrew to tbe entire satlslaction ot our
own citizens and the Mexican government
Subsequently the peace ot tbe border was
again disturbed by a savage foray under
tbe command of the Chief Victoria, but by
the combined and harmonious action oi the
military forces of both countries bis band
has been broken up, and eubstmially de
stroyed. There is reason to be ieve that
the obstacles which have so long prevented
rapid and convenient communication
between the Uuited States and Mexico by
railways, are on the point of disappearing
and that several important enterprises of
this chancier will soon beset on toot.
which cannot fail to contribute largely to
tbe pro-perity of both countries.
New envoys from Guatemala, Columbia.
Bolivia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua have
recently arrived at this capital, whose die
tinction and enlightenment affjrd the best
guarantee ot the continuance of
friendly relations between ourselves
and these sister Republics. Tbe
relations between this government and
that of the Uuited S'ates of Columbia have
engaged public attention during the past
year, mainly by reason oi the project of
an inter-oceanic canal acros the JUtbmua
of Panama, to be built by private capital.
under a concession from the Colombian
government for that purpose. The treaty
obligations subsisting between the United
estates ana uoiombia by which we guarantee
the neutrality of the transit aud tbe sover
eignty and prosperity of Colombia
in the Isth m us, make it necessary
to at the conditions under which
so stupetdous a change in
the region embraced in this guarantee
should be effected, trauaformtng as It
would this isthmus from a barrier bat ween
tbe Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a gate

navies and merchant, ships of the world,
should receive the approval of this govern
ment as being compatible with" the dis
Charge of these obligations oa our part,
aod consistent with our interests as the
principal powers of the Western hemis
phere. The views which I expressed to a
special message to Congress in March last
in relation to this project, I
deem it my duty again to
press upon your attention. Sub
sequent consideration has hat confirmed
the opinion that it is the right and duty of
the United States to assert aid maintain
such supervision aod vuth irity, over any
ioterocenries ctnal across the I-thmut that
cannects North and houth America, as
will protect our national interest.
THE WAR BETWEEN CHILI 4KD PEBU.
The war between the he public of Chili
on tbe one baud, and ihe allied republics
ot Peru and Bolivia on tbe other still con
tinues This government das not felt
called upon to interfere in acooieH that is
with in the belligerent rights 0f the parties
as independent states We hive however,
always held ourselves io read mess to aid
in accomodating their difference, and have
at different times lemtuded both belli gar
eats ot our willingness to render such ser
vice. Our good offices, in this direction, were '
recently accepted by all the belligerents,
and it wa9 hoped they would prove effica
cious; bull regret to announce ihttthe
measures, which the ministers of the
United States at Santiago and Lima took
take, with tbe view to bring about a peace,
not successful In the course ot the
war some questions have ariten affecting
neutral rights; in all of these tbe ministers
ot the United S ates have, under their in
structions, acted with promptness and en
ergy in protection of American interests.
BUAZIL AND THE ARGNTINB CONFEDERA
TION. The relations of the Uaited States with
the Empire of Brazil continue to be most
cordial, and their commercia' intercourse
steadily increases, to their mutual advant
age The internal disorders with which the
Argentine Republic has for sometime past
been afflicted, aod which have more or less
influenced its external trade, are under
stood to have been brought to a close.
This happy result may be expected to re
dound to the benefit of tbe foreign com
merce ot that Republic as well as to tbe de
velopment of its vast interior resources
In Samoa, the government of King
Malietoa, nnder tbe support and recogni
tion of the consular representatives ot the
Uoited Mates, Great Britain, and Germany,
seems to have given peace and tranquility
to the Islands While it does not appear
desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme
of tripartite local govenmeut, which baa
been proposed, the common interests of the
great treaty powers require haimony ia
men relations to the native frame of gov
ernment, and this may be best secured by
a simple diplomatic agreement between
them. It would be well if tbe consular
jurisdiction of dur representative at Apia
were increased in extent and importance
so as to guard American interests in the
surrounding aud outlying Islands of
Oceanica
EGYPT.
The obelisk, generously presented by the
Khedive of Egypt to the city of New
York, has safely arrived in this country,
and will soon be erected in that me ropolis.
Commission for the liquidation of tbe
Eiypii&n debt has lttvty concluded its
work, and this government, at the earnest
solicitation of the Khedive, has acceded to
tbe provisions adopted by it, which will
be laid before Congress tor its information.
A Commission for the revisioa ot tbe ja
riiciai code of the Reform Tribunal of
Egypt Is now in session in Cairo Mr.
Faruham, consul general, and J. M.
liaichelder. Esq , have been appointed as
commissioners to participate in ibis work.
Tbe organization of the reform tribunals
will probably oe continued for another pe
riod of five years.
INTERNATIONAL BANITARY CONFERENCE.
In pu suance ot tbe act patsed at tbe last
session ot Congress, invitations have been
extended to foreign maritime siates to j ia
in a sanitary conference in Vabiogion,
beginning the first of January. The accep
tance of tnis invitation by many prominent
powers gives promise ot succtss in tbis im
portant measure, designed to establish a
system of international notification by
which the spread ot in ectious or epidemic
diseases may be more effectively checked
or prevented The attention ot Congress is
invited to the necessary appropriations for
carrying into effect the provisions of the
act referred to.
EXTENDING AMENIOAN COMMERCE.
The efforts of the D. ptrtment ed state to
enlarge the trade aud comnerce of the
Uoited States, through the active agency
of consular officers aud through tne dis
semination ot information obtained from
them, have been unrelaxed. The interest
in these efforts, as developed in our com
mercial communities, aod the value of in
formation secured by this means, to the
trade and manufactures of the country.
were recognized by Congress at its last ses
sion, and piovision was made for the more
frequent publication ot consular and other
reports by the Department of State. The
first issue of this publication has now been
prepared, and subsequent issues may regu
larly be expected. Tbe importance and In
terest attached to the reports of consular
officers, are witnessed by the general de
mand tor them by all classes ot merchants
and manufacturers engaged in our foreign
trade. It is believed that tbe sj stem ot
such publication is deserving ot tbe appro
val of 2ongress, and that tbe necessary ap
propriations tor its continuance and en
largement will commend itself to your con
sideration.
The prosperous energies of our domestic
Industries, and their immense production
of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite,
and even require, an active developement
of the wiehes and interests of our people in
that direction. Especially important is it
that our commercial relations with tbe At
lantic and Pacific coasts of South America,
with tbe West Indies and the Gult ot Mex-
icy should be direct, and not through the
circuit of European systems, and should be
carried on in our own bottoms The full
apprecia ion of tbe opportunities which
our fronton tbe Pacific ocean gives to
commerce with Jspan, China, and tbe East
Indies, with Australia and tbe Island
groups which lie along these routes of vavt-
gation, should inspire equal euorts to ap
propriate to cur own shipping, and to ad
minister by our own capital, a due propor
tion ot this trade. Whatever modifications
of our regulations of trade and navigation
may be necessary or useful to meet and
direct these impulses to the enlargement of
our exchanges and of our carrying trade, I
am sure tbe wisdom ot Congress will be
ready to supply.
SUBSIDIZING 8TEAM POSTAL COMMUNICA
TIONS.
One initial measure, however, seems to
me so clearly useful and emctent tnai i
venture to press it upon your earnest atten
tion. It seems to be very evident that the
provision of regular steam postal commun
ication, by aid from Government, has teen
the forerunner of the commercial pre
dominance of Great Britain on all these
coasts and s as, a greater share m whose
trade is now the desire and the latent of
otr people It s also manifest that the
efforts of other European nations to con
tend with Great Britain for a share of this
commerce have beu successful in propor
tion with their adoption of regular si earn
postal communication with the mirk eta
they sought. Mexico and tbe States of
South America are anxious to receive such
postal communication wttn mis country,
and to aid in their development, similar
co-operation may be looked tor, to due
time from the Ess tern nations and from
Australia- lc is aimcuu to see now tne
