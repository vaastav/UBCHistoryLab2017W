I call particular attention to the Territory of Hawaii.
The importance of those islands is apparent, and the need
of improving their condition and developing their resources
is urgent. '
Our Currency System is imperfect.
1 During the seven years and three months there has
been a net surplus of nearly o-ic hundred millions of receipts
over expenditures, a reduction of the interest-bearing debt
of ninety millions.
I believe it is worse than' folly to attempt to prohibit
all combinations, as is done by the Sherman anti-trust law.
a.
Under such a popular government as our, founded on
the theory that in the long run the will of the people is su
preme, the safety of the Nation can only rest in training
and guiding the people so that what they will shall be right
and not in devising means to defeat their will by the tech
nicalities of strained construction.
What would have been an infringement on liberty half
a century ago may be. the ncctssary safeguard of liberty to
day. '
.
The pconlc should not be allowed to pardon evil and
slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it
right.
We must face the fact that there are wise and unwise
judges, just as there arc wise and unwise executives and
legislators.
In this respect compensation for families of injured
the generosity of the United States toward its 'employees
compares most unfavorably with that of every country in
Europe even the poorest. ,
No man should be allowed to make money in connec
tion with railroads out of fraudulent overcapitalization and
kindred stock-gambling performances.
We do not object to the concentration of wealth and
administration: but we do believe in the distribution of the
wealth in profits to the real owners and in securing to the
public the full benefit of the concentrated administration.

CHAMBER WILL TAKE
UP COASTWISE LAW
Special Meeting Galled
- To Consider This
Matter
The matter of the nttltudo of the
Chamberpot Commerce in regard to
the coastwise shipping law amend
ments will bo considered at a special
meeting of the Chnmber which has
b6en called for tomorrow afternoon at
8 o'clock. Tho officers ask that a
specially large attendance be present,
a It Is desired tq get the expression
of the entire membership of the or
ganisation, as far as this is possible.
Some of tho prominent members
of the Chnmber are advocating that
a cablegram bo sent to tho Governor
at Washington, asking him to take
no nctlon In regard. tn the matter be
fore ho has received the document
ary showing on the basis ot which
the commercial bodies withdrew their
opposition to the present coastwise
law. It Is probable that this Is the
opinion which will do roima to pro
vail among tho majority ot the mem
bcrs. It has also been suggested that
the Qocrnor be asked to concentrate
his energies on the passage ot tho
ship nubsldy bill, whlloothcrs are !n
favor of fabling him merely to use
his" own" Judgment In the question.
