DESPAIR.
Ah ! what is life when love hath flel,
And what is love when hope is dead,
And what is joy, when grief hath sled
Its blight upon the blossom fair!
When sorrow casts her darkest winr,
When clouts of doubt are hovering, .
When from the fount of Hore no spring
Is left to quench Despair.
It is to drag a weary chain.
To count its links with anxious pain,
And ever to return again.
To count them o'er and o'er ;
Like paternosters that are said
Like Ave's hymned above the dead,
Like funeral dirges sung and read,
For ever, evermore.

THE PUBLIC DOCUMENTS.
With th nrpnino nf IliA KPSQinn ril
Goagrcfs we tare the nv-tal Sooi of pnaofc.''"Set-n t,Je
documents from tie President, Trcasurv.
Army, Navy, Postal, Iuterior, Patent,
Lnud, Pension, Indian, Agricultural and
other departments, so voluminous as to be
absolutely beyond the power of any news
paper to print, or of any business man to
read It is the ancient custom of our na
tional government to be thus diffuse in
its State papers, but one that surely can
not last in its present shape, as the people
have long since discovered that very much
that appears in these papers is mere repe
tition. Take the Iuterior Department re
port, for instanee, and you Cud that it is a
mere synopi-is of the reports ef the Land,
I'atent, Indian, Public Buildings, and
some nther Purcau reports. Yet the
newspapers often attempt the foolish feat
of priuting both. Then the President's
message is a synopsis of all the depart
mental reports, with a brief review of our
foreign relations uuJ eomc uliiiuut uiuu
ments for home consumption.
At present wo shall consider these dfce
umcnts together, as forming parts of the
one general presentation of the stale d
a flairs and of the view aud policy of tiie
government. The first thing that occurs
lo the reader of theso documents is that
their whole toue, especially that of the
President's message, is very decidedly
moderated from the high and insolent
bearing which so incensed both Congress
and the nation There is really nothing
to complain of in the language or temper
f any of theso document0. It is appa
rent even to the most superGcial observer
thtit they aro all extremely guarded, and
that au effort has been made to assume an
air of courtesy aud deference to the peo
pie's representatives, for which the elec
tions have probably afforded the hint
We may differ from the sentiments ad
vanced, but no one cau deny that the opin
ions held by the writers of the documents
are stated ia very moderate terms. Look
ing at the sentiments themselves, we una
them to be identical with those advanced
ia the documents of last year, and the
policy advocated by the President does
not differ a hair's breadth from that he
has rendered so offensive ; so that all the
professions in favor of jmpartial suffrage
must have been intended to deceive those
who uudcrtook to deal with him. Not a
stop is taken in the direction of any con
ciliation with Congress, nor is any plan of
agreement even hinted at. Just as the
plan of admitting the rebel States uncon
ditionally was admitted last year, it is re
peated iu the present message.
The statement made bv this document
is so smooth, plausible aud iusinuating
that many persons will probably overlook
the misrepresentations it contains. The
Presideut, for example, says that the en
forcement of the laws is no longer ob
structed ia any State by combinations too
powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary
couise of judicial proceedings, which cer
taiuly is not the fact. All over the south
bands of regulators oppress the Union
men and the fieedmen, burn their houses,
Cog aud even kill them, and no judicial
proceedings can reach the outlaws. No
attempt has been made to enforce the
Civil Rights act, and the combinations at
the south have rendered it a dead letter.
It is curious that the President wholly ig
nores that statute in his message. The
Frecdmen'a Bureau receives the cold
shoulder in about the same style. The
message says that '-the animosities engen
dered by the war aro rapidly yieldiog to
the benificent influence of our free iusii
tutiour, and to the kiudiy effects of unre-
-AID T11B ENFOBCKME5T Or IBK LAWS.

not necessary to traverse this portion of
the document, and we notice it now only
to call attention to the fact that all the at
tempts at a new basis of arrangement
have failed, and that the Presideut yields
nothing whatever to public opinion as de
ductions, .The President
does not even attempt to present a reason
able excuse for interfering with the rolls
of members of Congress, aud it is not
likely that either House will pay any at
tention to what he says on the subject.
It is plain that it was written for the pub
lic and not for Congress, and hence the
moderate language used. The Secretary
of the Treasury goes out of his way iu his
report to meddle with the tame matter,
and to give it as one of the measures in
dispensable to the proper regulations of
our Cuanccs. lie makes the attempt to
iuduce people to believe that the policy
of Congress on reconstruction impairs the
value of our public securities. Of course
this argument is intended only to create
opinion among the peoplo hostib to Con
gress. The condensation of the departmental
reports contained in the message is ouitc
interesting to those whn have not lime to
persue the full reports. They show a
very prosperous state of affairs iu most of
the Departments. The Treasury figures
have airesdy been published so generally
as to be quite familiar. They cxliil it a
miscalculation last year on the part of the
Treasury Department which is !i:t!e .'hort
of marvellous. The Secretary
s et:;na'cs
fioted up an increase of SI 12,19 1.947 ol
the national debt for the fi.-esl year, iu
stead of which there w.is a surplus reve
nue of ?37,2S1,CS0, and ihe debt was re
duced S31,106,3S7. The miscalculation
was so extraordinary that we aro tempted
to rail attcntiou to its details. Mr. Mc
Cuiloch's estimates entirely emitted the
receipts from direct tax, and this produced
? 1,9 13,(513. Ho set djwn the receipts
from customs at 8100,000,000, and they
went 532,037,0(58 beyond that sum. lie
underrated the internal revenue in like
manner $37,1507,927, and the miscellane
ous revenue S1S,2S5,125. It may be
urged that bis idea in this was to restrain
Congress from making large appropria
tions, but, if so,he has now destroyed his
reputation with Congress, and his esti
mates will no longer be depended upon.
The reduction of 8200,379,5(55 of the
national debt in fourteen months is un
doubtedly greatly to his credit as a pru
dent manager, and as he estimates a sur
plus of ei5S,33,308 for the year ending
Juue 30, 18C7, we may look for the con
tinuation of the same policy. The Pres
ided aud Secretary recommend a gradual
reduction of the taxes as the country ad
vances in wealth and population.
The report of the Treasury Depart
ment goes at great length into the ques
tion of contraction of the currency, spe
cie basis arid the tariff, and on these heads
the President aud Dot repeated his views,
or indorsed them further than to com
mend them to the careful consideration of
Congress. Tli6 Secretary wants to have
authority to cancel six millions of green
backs a month during the present fL-cul
year,, ten miliious a mouth thereafter, and
to continue this until the w hole volume
of government currency is extinguished.
He admits the saving of interest to the
government by the use of this currency,
aud also the favor iu which it is held by
the people : but he opposes it altogether,
and urges that the circulation be aban
doned wholly to the banks, whereby we
should have no government currency at
all. We need not reiterate our opposi
tion to this.
In regard to the national banks, though
the Secretary considers them an immer.se
improvement upon all previous systems
uf bauking, bo indicates hostility to any
culargcuicBts of the opiul or currency,

wastes time in doing so.
Wo have not space to refer to the
President's condensations of theolhcr re
ports, but would merely observe that they
are all gratifying exhibits ot the prosper
ous condition ot affairs. The Presideut
emphatically urges trpon the (Senate to
pass the bill from the House to accept
League Lland fur an iron-clad naval de
pot. There is but little of intetcsliu the
reference to the France-Mexican trouble,
the Fcuians aud the British spoliations.

A CURIOUS CASE-A PAITEE SUDDENLY
ENRICHED.
Several years since a man named Free

lie had a reputation of meanness second

He had a wife aud three children. lie
quarreled with his wife and sued for a
divorce, which he was unable to obtain.
The wife also failed iu a similar attempt.
Waterhousc then deserted his wife, who,
subsequently becauio a pauper ia the
town of Brunswick. Her three children
'were r,tacej umjcr ti;c carc uf rcrsot;s in
Poland, and have there grown up. Years
passed without netts ol the scandalous
husband.
Something more than a year ago Judge
Luce, of Auburn, received information
of the death of Freeman Waterhousc in
Idaho Tetritory, whither, it seems, he
skedaddled after deserting his wife. He
died after amassing a fortune of from
twenty to twenty five thouaud dullars in
gold, leaving, apparently, no heirs behind
him. The Judge of Probate in Idaho
wrote to Maine fur information. Judge
Luce at once looked up the facts, and
reported them, and was retained by the
miser's wife, a pauper ia Brunswick, to
recover the prvpe:ty The cs.-:e has been
pending in Idaho the past pear, and has
resulted iu a verdict which will give the
entire property to the rightful heirs.
Mrs. Watcrhouse will probably receive
60,00 in gold and her three children the
remainder of the propel ty enough to
set them up iu the world, somewhat.
Judge Luce La3 already received from
Iduho, for the widow, a bag of gt Id dust
worth about 53,200 in coiu, and the re
mainder will be forthcoming.
The result shows that Mrs. Watcrhoue
was very fortunate in not secutirg a di

LETTER FR01I "0CCASI0..1."
WAsniNOTOs, P. C, Dec. 3, 'CO.
The first day of the second (session of
the Thirty ninth Congress has just closed
and all the indications are auspicious.
The President's Message has produced-
, impression than sleepy edi-
"1J L "
tonal iu the Aafionol ItitctH'jcncer. Il
is the old story of treachery disguised ia
some of Mr. Seward's faded rhetoric,
and touched off with the cheap logic of
an obsequious Attorney General. So far
from an original idea, it is the dismal iter
ation of rejected heresies aud threadbare
falsehoods so weary that it was listened
to without an apparent emotiun, aud at
the end, and before its reading was fin
ished, the galleries were almost cleared.
Even the adherents of the President, in
cvery case his old opponents, held to hiui
Ly the '-is cX otiiets er the expectation ot
olHce, Lave no word to say ia its vindi
cation. The great, majorities in CougrcsJ
treated it with open contempt, and laugh
ed at it as aa argument a thousand times
refuted, and as the last feeble cnunciaiiuu
of a recreant who although uuivcrsally
repudiated by his constituents, is still
weak enough to auhero to his "policy,"
and vain enough to believe that any cla-a
of the people continue sincerely to favor
it. The indifference with which the
message was received, was not tho least
significant event of the day. The pas
sage of the bill repealing that fectien t-f
tho act of Congress, Ju'y 17, 1J-G2, au
thorizing the President to extend amnesty
to the rebels, by an overwhelming vote iu
the House, is ouly the beginning of cura?
tive and retributive legislation. So too of
Judge Kelley's proposition to dismantle
and remodel ihe whole iutercal revenue
system, which, on a suspension of tho
rules, was referred to the proper comm'tUn
This measure removes the whole patron
age under that tremendous system from
the President and the Secretary of tho
Treasury, and gives it to the Supreme
Court of the United States. Another
great remedy is the bill of Hen. Thomas
Wiiliams, ef the Piltsburg or Alleghany
(Pa.) district, soon to be reported, sub
stantially providing fur the suspension of
the functions of any officer while he is tu
trial for crimes and misdemeanors bifuro
he Uni ted States Suuate. The passage
of such a statute closes the legal gap iu
ths impeachment argument and cry?talizcs
the full power iu Congress. The discus
sion of Andrew Johuson's outrages upon
so'emu law aud executive honor has es
tablished the necessity of such legislation,
and you may rest assured that neither his
