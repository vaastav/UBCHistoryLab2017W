IS 3 pohgamist and advocates that
dlctrin of the Mormon church is to
have the organized support of hun
dreds of thousands of women in the

movement is to take organized form in
this city at a meeting of the Presby

sions Dee 20
There are 100000 members of the
Presbyterian Home 1lissions society
alone in the United States
The Home Missions societies of the
Congregational and Baltst churches
are preparing to make a similar cam
paign against Roberts and the omens
socIeties of other denominations are
becoming interested in the fight It is
intended that all shall cooperat The
Congregational Home Missionary so
ciety will take the matter up at a
metlng to be held at the Saint Denis
hotel in January
This movement is not to be confined
to missionary societies but is to be
started through them as a convenient
way of arousihg interest over the entire
country The women are to give in
formation regarding the Roberts case
apd the supposed danger of the revival
of polygamy and to unite in obtaining
iersonal letters to representatives in all
districts throughout the country pro
testing against the seating of an
avowed polygamist
Rev William S Campbell who has
spent twelve years in Utahamong the
Mormons h in New York taking an
active part in the fight against polyg
amy He with another speaker who
has lived among the Mormons will
probably address the coming meetings
Mr Campbell will dwell especially on
the revival of polygamy in Utah He
says that the presbytery of Utah is in
tueli with only 70 of the no postoffices
n Utah Reports received from these
show 2000 cases of polygamy and that
JOOO pOlygamist children have been
born since Utah was admitted to state
hood in 1895
In the womens fight against Roberts
it is urged that if he is seated the
Mormon church will grant dispensa
tions to many men to take more wives
lIissionaries who have been stu lying
the Utah situation say that many
polygamists are now making arrange
ments to that end

the outgrowth of the litigation over the

declined to give IIp the papers on the

Some time ago he was before United

ARMY WILL DWINDLE I
Regulars as Well as Volunteers Must I
Be Discharged
Washington Dec SGeneral lIiles
expects to appear before the house mil
I itary committee in a few days to set
out the reasons why he thinks his army
bill should be passed The most urgent
is the fact that immediately upon the
I formal announcement of the peace be
tween the United States and Spain the
United States army may be sUddenly
reduced almost a third and at a time
I when the need for troops for garrison
purposes is still pressing This stat
meat does not apply to volunteer
troops 4s stated by the president In
his message they having enlisted for
the war must all be discharged But
when the war department acting under
the authority conferred by congress at
the last session sought to raise the reg
ular army to a war footing to stimu
late enlistments it pledged itself in a
formal order to discharge upon his
own appllcaton any recruit who wishes
to leave the service upon the conclu
sion of peace although the nominal
term of enlistment was for three years
General Miles will refer to the present
prospect of a conclusion of the nego
tiatians at Paris and the signature of
the treaty of peace as an evidence of
the necessity for speedy action He
will also urge that provision be made

By Telephone to The Herald
Ogden Dec 80ne of the greatest
rabbit hunts in the history of the west
took place yesterday the Weber coun
ty marksmen going out to Seco on
I the Southern Pacific and slaughtering
the bunnies by thousands There were
sIxtyeight in the party including a
few Salt Lalrers The train left Ogden
at 240 nm and arrived at the hunt
ing grounds an hour before daylight
During the hour the party organized
into two squads one headed by A L
Brewer and the other by George
Browning
The Browning party went along the
west side of the long VshaDed ridge
extending north and south
The Brewer crowd went along the
east side of the ridge and all the hunt
ers declare that never in their exueri
I ence did they see anything to equal
the number of rabbits They cOuld be
seen by hundreds at a time and sev
eral gentlemen of veracIty declare that
as high as fifty were killed by one
man without his moving out of his
tracks They were as thick as files in
summer the hunters declare 1
Three wagons followed each squad
and they were wholly inadequate to
bring in the game A great many of
the hunters had only taken 100 shells
each and they were soon out of am
munition The heavy part of the shoot
lag was over by noon and the count
of rabbits killed was entirely lost Es
timated by wagonloads the Browning
ctowd beat the others by lrobably 800
of 1000 5
A conservative estimate is that 5000
rabbits Iwere killed though some esti
mates run up to more than double that
number About 1000 were left on the
ground as the wagons could not get
them to the railroad during the day
An extra car was provided and the
game will be brought into Ogden and
the rabbits distributed today to any
who may call
The party hoarded the return train
about 3 oclock and arrived home about I

L T
Paris De SThe United States and
Spanish peace commissioners concluded
their work today and finally settled the
terms of the treaty of peace They will
meet once more in formal session on
Saturday or Monday next when the
Spanish commissionerS sorrowfully
agd the Americans with feelings of re
lief will write their signatures upon
the document which embodies the re
sults of the war and the preparation of
whIch has consumed eleven weeks a
longer time than the war itself In the
meantime the treaty will be engrossed
under the stlpervision of 1Ir MoOre and
Senor Ojeda Ute secretaries of the re
spective commissions
The Spaniards are exceedingly bitter
over the result though observing the
form of frIendliness and courtesy to
the end Senor Montero Rios whose
strong and persistent struggle to save
for his country every possible asset
from the wreck of her colonial empire
has commanded the respect and ad
miration of his opponents went from
the council chamber today to his bed
in a state of complete collapse as the
result of the long strain and his cha
grin over the small fruits of his efforts
Senor Ojeda has been prostrated
since yesterday and was unable to at
tend the joint session today
The Spaniards charge equal blame
upon the European powers and the
United States for their downfall One
of the Spanish commissioners aid this
evenIng The European nations have
made a great mistake in deserting
Spain and leaving her to spoilation by
the brute force of a consciencelesS
giant They an know that In the Phil
ippInes America has taken more than
she can digest She will ultimately sell
the islands to England or Germany
and when the transfer is attemted it
will preciptate general Ellrpean
strife We have refused to sell any island
in the CrOIIne We never thought of
considering an offer Nor have we con
sented to negotiate upon any questions
except those directly involve in the
protocol signed at Washington
SCOPE OF THE TREATY
The members of the commission say
the treaty wiiI contain little outside
the scole of the Washington rtocol
and the matters directly based thereon
like the provisions for the evacuttion
of the ceded territory the transfer of
public property therein and guarantees
of the safety of the property and rights
of the Spanish citizens remaining there
The details of the last class of ques
tions covered by the statement which
the Americans handed to Senor Mon
tero Rios at the last meeting were
considered today but aU the commis
sioners refused to divulge the details
of the conference Several points upon
which ther were unable to agree were
left open for diplomatic negotiations
The Spaniards refuse to admit that
they have failed to respect former
treaties guaranteeing religious freedom
in the Caroline islands or that there
was a necessity for such guarantees
The conclusion of the work was ac
cording to the commissioners marked
by politeness and all outward evidences
of good feeling and relief at the fact
that the task was accomplished
When all the propositions had been
discussed Judge Day president of the
American commission remarked
There seems to be nothing more to
do but to engross and sign the treaty
Senor Iontero Bios president of the
Spanish commission acquiesced to this
and the Americans bowed themselves
out before the Spaniards according to
their ustom
AMERICANS WERE NERVOUS

nervous frame of mind They evidently
had reasons to believe that a posSIbility
existed even at this late hour that
there might be a rupture This feeling
of apprehension was based an the tem
per the Spaniards have displayed
lately
This week the commissioners of Spain
did not conceal the fact that having
failed to gain all the important points
they were indifferent as to whether or
not the conferences resulted in a set
tlement of peace by the signing of a
treaty by which Spain loses all her
colonies
The Madrid papers are disposed to
revive the question of the Maine and
to excite public opinion against the
United States on account of the refer
ence made to this in President 11 Kin
leys message to congress They repr
that Senor 1Iontero RIos presidEnt of
the Spanish commission madE an im
passioned denunciation of President
McKinley at the last joint meeting of the
commissions But these reports arc
practically without foundation Senor
RiOs did refer to the Maine but only
in calmly warded sentences expressing
regret that the president had spoken
as Spaniards thought unjustly of them
The Spaniards had already proposed
at this conference to have the respon
sibility of the Maine reported upon by
a joint commission of the European
powers The American commissioners
refused to listen to this and permitted
Seaifr Rios reference to the presidents
message to pass unchallenged as a
discussion would cause bad blood
Diplomatic circles in Paris predict as
one of the results of the treaty a dip
lomatic contest between France and
the United States whichwill make an
important chapter in history
The French government is reported
to have resolved to take up the case
of the French holders of Cuban bonds
and it is believed France will declare
that the replldlatlo of the bonds is the
result of the treaty which the victorious
nation Imposed upon Spain
They argue that through the treat
responsibility has been shifted upon
America and therefore the French gov
ernment will endeavor to exact some
pledge for the payment or guarantee ot
the bondS
