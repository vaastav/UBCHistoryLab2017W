Fellow* Citizen* "112 Ihe Senate
and Iltnise of Representatives :
After a brief interval the Congress of
the United States resumes its annual leg
islative labors An all wise and merci
ful Providence lias abated the pestilence
which visited our shores, leaving its ca*
.lamitous traces upon some portion of our
country. Peace, order, tranquillity and
civil authority have bet-u formally de
clared to exist throughout the whole of
the United States. In nil of the States
civil authority has superseded the coer
cion of arms, and the people, by their
voluntary action, are maintaining their
governments in full activity and com
plete operation. The enforcement of the
laws is no longer -'obstructed in any State
by combinations too powerful to be sup
pressed by the ordinary course of judic
ial proceedings," and the animosities en
ceudeved by the war are rapidly yield*
in"to the beneficent influences of uur
free- Institutions, and to the kindly if
feets of unrestricted social and comnicr
eiai iute course An entire restoration
off.Sternal feeling must be the earnest
wish ot every patriotic heait; and we
will have accomplished our grandest na
tional achievement when, forgetting the
*ud events of the fas', and remembers
in" oirly their instructive lessons, wo re
sume onr -onward career as a free, pros*
perous, aud united people.
In my mewage ot the 4th of Decern
her ISt»r», Congre-s was informed of the
measures which Bad he«n instituted by
the Kxecutive with a view.to the gtadu
Sl | restoration of the Slates in which the
insurrection occurred to their relations
with the General Government. Provis
ional Governors had been appointed/ ou
ven (ions called, Governors elected, Leg
islatures assembled, and Senatorj>j.-,ind
Hep esenlntives chosen to the Congress
td the United Sta'cs. Courts had been
~f,cnc"d ttn tho onfororm?nt ot laws long
in abeyance. The blockade had been re
moved, custom houses ro c>tabli"<l»c«-,ani
jlie internal revenue laws putin force,in
order that the peopfe might contribute to
the national income. Postal operations
had been renewed.«nd cflorts were being
made to restore them to their former con
• Hi, m of efficiency. The States them,
selves had been asked to take part m the
,liigh function of amen ling the Constitu
lion, and (d thus sanctioning tho extitic
,n.in „112 African slavery as one of tho log*
i'.iuiato results of our internecine strug-
glo.
Having progressed thus fur, the exec
utive department lo in ! that it hud ac«
plaited nearly nil that was within the
of its constitutional aulhori.y.
One thing, however. yet remained to he j
.lone he!'«re the- w-rk «if wstoration coitld
be completed, aud that was the admis
sion to Congress of loyal Sen ators and
Representative* Irom the States whose
iicopln had rebelled against the lav.lul
authority of tl.c Genoral Government.
This question devolved upon the respec
tive I looses, which, bv the Constitution,
arc made the judges of the elections, re*
turns, and qualifie itions of their own
members; ami its consideration lit once
engaged (lie attention ol Congress.

the Constitution of the I'nited States
All of the States iu which the insuvtee
tion had existed promptly amended their
t Constituti.ms, so as to make them con
form to the great change thus effected
in tbe organic law of the land ; declared
•null and void nil ordinances and laws »t

iftated to admit sny of these States to
representation; and it was not until to
'yards tbe close of tbe eighth month if
the session that on exception was made
'fn f»ror of Tennessee, by the adn. ission
of her Senators and Representatives.
V I deem it a subject of profound regret
that Congress has tbus far tailed to ad
jnit to seata loyal Senators and Represen
"tativesfrom the other States, whose in
jjabitantfc, with those of Tennessee, bad
engaged in the rebellion. '1 he States
more than one-fourth of the whole nnm

seat* of fifty u.euili#rß in the House ol
Representative* and of twenty members

their own consent, not by a la:lure of
election, but by the refusal of Congress
to accept tlieir credentials. 1 heir ad

people, and removed serious cause for
discontent on the part of the inhabitants
of those States. It would have accorded
with the great principle enunciated in
the Declaration of American Independ
ence, that no people ought to bear tin
burden of taxation, and yet be denied
the right of representation. It would
have been in consonance with the express
provisions of the Constitution, that''each
State shall have at least one representa
tive," and, -'that no State without its con
sent, shall be deprived of its equal
suffrage in the Senate." These provis*
i.,ns were intended to secure to every
State, and to the peopie of every Sta'e,
the right .jf representation in each llous3
of Congress; and so important was it
deemed by the framers of the Constitu
tion that the equality of the States in
the Senate should be preserved, that not
even by an amendment of the % Constitu
tion tfan any State, without its consent,
be denied a voice in that branch ot ti e
National Legislature.
It is true,"it has been assumed that the
existence of the States was terminated
by the rebellious acts of their inhabi
tants, and that tho insurrection having
been suppressed, they were thenceforward
0i be considered merely as conquered tei
litories. The Legislative, i xeCutive,
and Judicial Departments of the Gov
ernment have, however, with great dis
tinctness and uniform consistency, r fuS
ed to sanction an a-suinption so inc mi
patible with tho nature ot our republi
can system, and with ibe professed oh
jeots of the war. Throughout the recent
legislation of Congress the undeniable
fu«t makes itself apparent, that these ten
p diticil ill ties arc nothing less than
St te of this Union. At the very com
tnencunont of the rebellion, each House
declared, with a unanimity as remarka
ble as it was significant,"that the war was
not "waged, on our partj iifcany spirit id
oppression, nor for any purpose of eon
c|ues: or subjugation nor purpose of over
throwing or interfering with the right*
or established institutions of th ne States,
but to defend and maintain the suprerru

in pursuance thereof, and to presetvc the

up in the fact that the functions of the
,<tate were nut destroyed by the rebellion,
but merely suspended ; an d I hat princi

which, like Tennessee, attempted to re
nounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Kxeeu'ive Depart
mcnt of the Government upon this sub
ject has been equally definite and uni
form, and the purpose of the war was
specially stated in the proclamation is.su
ed by my predecessor on the 22d d<y of
September, IS(W. It was then solemnly
unclaimed and declared that "li Mcalter

sion of loyal members to seats in the re
spective Houses of Congress was wise
and expedient a year ago,it is no 1e33 wise
and expedient now. If this anomalous
condition is right now—if, in the exact
condition of these States at the present
time, it is lawful to exclude them Irom
representation, I do not see that the qiies
tion will be changed by the efflux ot
time. Ten years hence, if these -States
remain as they are, the right of represen
tation will be«o stronger —the right of
exclusion will be no weaker.
The Constitution of the United States,
makes it the duty of the President to
recommend to the consideration of Con
gress "such measures as he shall judge
uccessary or expedient." I know ot no
measure more imperatively demanded by
every consideration of national interest,
sound policy, and equal justice, than the
admission of loyal members from ihenow
unrepresented States. This woul 1 con
summate the work of restoration, an i ex
ci t a most salutary influence in the 'e<
establishment of peace, harmony, and
fraternal feeling. It would tet.d greatly
to renew the confidence of the American
[ cople in the vigor and stability of their
institutions. It would bind us more close
ly together as a nation, and enable us to
show to tha world the inherent and recu
perative power of a Government founded
upon the will of the people, and esub
lishel up in the principles of liberty .jus*
tice and intelligent"!. On increased
strength and enhanced prosperity woul.l
irtefragably demonstrate the fallacy of
the arguments against free institutions
diawn from our recent national disorders
by the enemies of republican government
The admission of loyal members from
the States now cxehidad from Congress
by allaying doubt an 1 apprehension,
would turn capital, now awaiting an op
portunity for investment, into the chan
nels of trade and indu -try. It would al
leviate the present troubled condition of
those States, and, by inducing einigra
tiin. aid in the settlement of fertile re
gii.ns now uncultivated, and lead to an
increased production of those Staples
which hive added so greatly to the
wealth of the nation and the comriorce
of the world. New fields of enterprise
would bo opened to our progressive peo
pie, and soon the devastations of war
would be repaired, and all traces of our
domestic differences effaced from the
minds of our countrymen.

The report, of 'he Secretary of the
Treasury afloiiis nmdi uifonuaUMi res
pecting the revenue unci commerce of the
country. His .icws upon the eurrency.
aud with rc'ferenec to a proper adjust
mentof our revenue system, internal as
well ns impost, are commended to the
caref'u' c >nsideration o( Oon-rtsß. Jo my
last annual message I expressed my (jen
"ral views upon the<e Bubjoctt. I need
i >u)w only call attention to the necessity
of carrying into evf ry department of the
Government a system of ri<;id accounta
bility, thorough retrenchment. and wise
economy With'no exceptional nor un
usual exprn litures. the opprettsi'u bur
dens of taxation can be le'seued by nqeh
ji modification of our revenue htws as will
be consistent with the public faith, aud
the legitimate and necessary wauts of the
Government.
The report presents a much more sat
isfactory condition of our finances than
one year a o the most sanguine could
have anticipated. During the fiscal year
ending the 80th June, 1865, the last year
of the war. the public debt was increased
$941,902,537, and on the 31st of Octo
ber, 1863, it amounted to $2.740,854,-
750. On the 31st day of October, 1866,
it had been reduced to $2,551,310,006,
the diminution, during a period of four
teen months commencing September 1,
1865, and ending October 81, having
been 820fi.879.565. In the ljst annual
report en tha state of thefinanees, it was
estimated that during the three quarters
of tlie fiscal year ending the 30th of June
last, the debt would be increased §112,-
194,047. During rtiat period, however,
it was ic-ueed S3! 106 387, the receipts
of the year having been 889,705.905
more, and the expenditures $200,529,235
less than the estimates. Nothing could
more clearly indicate than these state
ments the extent and availability of the
uatinna' resources and the rapidity and
safety with which, under our form of
government, great military and naval es
tablishments can be disbanded, and ex
penses reduced from a war to a peace foot-
ing.
baring th« fiscal year ending the 30ih
ol' June, 1806, iho roN wero $558,
'•32,620, ami thoex: »<i- ure- 5520.750,*

for the fiscal year ending the 30ih Juno,
1867. will be 8475,061,2*6 ami that the
expend 'ures will reach the sum of $316,-
428,n78, le ving in the Treasury a sur
plus of 8158,633,305. For the fiscal
ye r emtio* June 30, 1868, it !•» cstiina*
ted that the receipts will amount to 8436,
>OO.OOO, and that the expenditures will
!>e 8350,'247.641 —showing an excess of
585,752.359 in favor of the Government.
These estimated receipts may be dimin
ished by a reduction ot excise and im»
port duties but after all necessary re
ductions shall have been made, the rev
etitie of the present and of following
years will doubtless be sufficient to cover
all .legitimate charges upon the Treasury,
and leave a large annual surplus to be
applied to the payment ol the principal
of hs debt, 't here seems now to be no
go.id reason, why tax>s may not be re
du " i as tho country advances in popu
j&ii.in and wealth, and yet thetlebi be ex
tinguished within then ;xc quarter of a
century.
The report of the Secretary of War
furnishes valuable an 1 important ittfor
ination in reference to the operations of
nis Department during the past year.—
Few volunteers now remain in the ser
vice, and they arc being discharged as
rapidly a'jthey can le replaced by, regu
lar troops. The army litis been promptly
paid, carefully provided with medical
tieatmont, Will sheltered and subsis'ed,
and is to be furnished with breech load

It is stated in the rcu<> • .112 the Seere

this time consists of tv i huhil ed. and
seventy-eight vessel.-' arm. d .with two ;

and valance bare l>ecn displayed by all
the squadrons and their movements have
been judiciously and efficiently arranged
in such manner SK would best promote
American commerce, and protect the
rights snd interests-of our countrymen
abroad. The yeMscls unemployed are un
dergoiuL: re airs, or are laid up nntil their
services may be required. Most of the
iron»elaa fleet is at League Island, ici the
vicinity of Philadelphia, a placo wiucli,
until decisive action should be taken by
C'ofiirresx was s.elee'ed by the Secretary of
the' Navy as the most eligible location for
that Clitss of vessels. It is important that
a suitable public station should be pros
vided tnr «lnd fleet. T t is in
tended that these Tessels shall bf in prop
ei' condition for any wn#iyency, and 'tis
desirable that the bill-accepting
island fir .naval purposes, which | apg d
the Home-ot Representativs ai ils last
session, should receive final action at an
early period, in order that there may be a
suitable public station for this cla-s ol
vessels, as well as a navy y?rd of area
sufficient for the wantsof tha seryico. on
the Delawire river. The Naval Pension
Kund amounts to having
been increased daring the
- I ■
year. The expenditures of the Depart
ment fin the fiscal year end : ng 30th June
last were $43,324,520, and the estimates
for the coming year amount to 823.578,-
430. Attention is invited to the condi
tion of our seaiueu, and the importance
of legislative measures for their relief and
improvement The suggestions in behalf
of this deserving class of our fellow cit
izens are earuestly recommended to the
favorable atteution of Congres#.
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a most satisfactory condition oT
tho postal service, and submits recom
mendations which deserve the considera
tion of Congress. The revenues of the
Department for tire yeer ending June 30,
1860, were 814.386,986, nud the expen
ditures 815,352,079, showing an excess
of the latter of 8965,093. In anticipa
tion of this deficiency, however, a
cial appropriation was made by Congress
in 'he act approved July 28, 1806. In*
eluding the standing appropriation of
8700,000 for free maii matter, as a legit»
imate portion of the revenues yet remain
ing unexpended, the actual deficiency
for tho past year is only 8265,093 —a
sum within 851,141 of the amount esti
mated in the annual report of 1^64
The decrease of revenue compared with
tho previous year was one and one-fifth
per cent., and the increase of expendi
tures, owing principally to the enlarge
ment of the mail service in the South,
was twelve per cent. On the 30th of
June last there were ic operation six
thousand ni.ie hundred and thirty mail
routes, with an' aggregate length of oue
hundred and eighty thousand nine hun
dred and iwcnty-onc miles, an aggregate
annual transportation of seventy-one
million eight hundred and thirty-seven
thousand nine hundred and fourteen
miles, and an aggregate annual cost, in«
eluding all expenditures, of 88 410,184
The length < 112 railroad routes is thirty
two thousand aud ninety two miles, and
tho annual transportation thirty million
six hundred and nine thousand four hun
dred and s'xty-seven miles. The length
of steamboat routes is fourteen thous ml
three hundred and forly-six miles, and
the annual transportation three million
four hundred and eleven thousand nine
hundred and sixty-two miles. 'lhe mail
service is rapidly increasing throughout
the whole country, and its steady exten
sion in the Southern States indicates their
constantly improving condition. 'lho
slowing importance of tho foreign ser
vice jilso merits attention. The Post Office
Department ol Great Britain and our own
have agreed upon a pieiiminary basis for
a new Postal Convention, which, it is
believed, will prove eminently beneficial
to the commercial interests of the United
States, inasmuch as it contemplates a re
duction o the international letter post
age to one-half the cxis'tios rates ; a rft
duction of'postage with all othtr countries
to and from which correspondence is
transmitted in the British moil,or in clos
ed mails through the United Kingdom ;
the establishment of uniform and reason
able charged lor the sea and tcrritori .1
transit of correspondence in closed mails
and an allowance to each Post Office De
partment of tlye right to use all mail
communications established under the
authoiity of the other for the dispatch of
correspondence, cither in open or closed
mails, on the same terms as those appli»
cable lo the inhabitants of the c untry
providing the means of transmission.
The report of the Secretary of the In
I terioi exhibits the condition of tho c

the last fiscal year, four -million six hun
i.red and twenty nine thousand three hun
drcd and twelve acres of public land wcro
.digj.oMd of. one million eipht hundred
and ninety two thousand five hundred
and sixtrcn acres of which were entered
under the homestead act. 'iho policy
oripiuully adopted relative to the public
lands has undergone essential modifica
tions. Imtnodiato roveriue, and not their
rapid settlement. was tho cardinal feature
ol our land system. Long experience
and carne-t di-cission have resulted in
the eon via lion that the early development
ol our agricultural resources, an I the
diffusion of an energetic population over
our vast territory, are objects of far great
cr importance to the national growth and
prosperity than the proceeds of the sale
o! the land to the highest bidder in open
maikct. The pre-emption laws confer
ui>on the pioneer who complies with thc<
terms they impn«e tho privilege of pur
chasing a limited portion of " unoffercd
lands" at the minimum price. Tho
homestead enactment* relieve the settler
from tho payment of purchase money,
and secure him a permanent home, upon
the condition of residence for a term of
yeurs. This liberal policy invites emi
gration from the old, and from the more
crowded portions of tho new world. Its
propitious results are unndoubtcd. and
will be more signally manifested "'hen
ti i«e shall have given to it a wiJcr devel
opment.
Congress has made liberal grants of
public land to corporations, in aid of the
construction of railroads and other inter
niil improvements. Should this policy
hereafter prevail, njo v e stringent provis
iop« will b i required to secure a faithful
application of '.he fund. Tho title to the
lands should not pass, bv patent or oth
erwise. but remam in tho Government
and subject to its control until some por
ti<m of the road ha- been actually built.
Portions of them might then, from time
ti) time, be conveyed to tho corpora i n,
but rtever it) a greaftfer ratio to the whole
quaMity embraced by the grsnt than the
ouiptetcd parts bear to th * entire length
ot (he projected impr vement. This
restriction would not operale to the prej
ud ec of any undertaking eon<oivud in
piuvi faitb Mid executed with rensiubaUf
energy, ag it i« £ho fettled practice to
withdraw from market the lands Calling
within the operation of such grants, and
thus to exclude the inception of a Fiib-
Seq'uent adverse right. A nrcach of the
couditions which Congress may deem
proper to impose should work a forfeits
ure of claim to the lauds so withdrawn
but unconvcyed, and o r title to the liiu J s
conveyed which remain unsold.
I Operations on the several lines of the
Pacific Railroad have heen prosecuted
with unexampled visor and succe&s. —
Should no utifoi-seen causes of delay oc

great thoroughfare will be completed be
fore the expiration of the period desig
nated by Congress.
During the last fiscal year the amount
paid to pensioners, including the expen
ecs of disbursement, was thirteen million
four hundred and fifty nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-six dollars; atrd
fifty thousand one hundred and seventy
seveu names were added to the pension
rolls. 'I he entire number of pensioners,
.June 30. 1806, was one hundred and
twenty-six thousand seven hundred and
twenty-two. This fact furnishes melan
choly atid striking proof of the sacrifices
made to vindicate the constitutional au
thority of the Federal Government, and
to maintain inviolate the integrity of the
Union. They impose upon us corres
ponding obligations. It is estimated that
thirty-thice million dollars will be re
quired to meet the exigencies of this
branch of the service during the next
fiscal yetr.
Treaties have been concluded with the
Indians who. enticed into armed opposi
tioii to our Government at the outbreak
of the rebellion, bav. unconditionally
submitted to our authority, and manifes

During the year ending September 30,
ISfiO, eight thousand seven liundred and
sixteen patents for useful inventions and
designs were issued, and at that date tlte
balance in tbe Treasury to the credit of
the l'atent fund was two hundred and
twenty eight thousand two hundred and
ninety- feven dollars.
As a subject upon which depends an
immense amount of the production and
commerce of tbe countiy. I recommend
to Congress such legislation as may be
necessary for tbe preservation of the lev
ecs of the Mississippi river. It is o
matter of national importance that early
steps should be taken not only to add to
the cffii iepcy of these harriers against
destructive inundations, but for the re
moval of all obstructions to the fice and
safe navigation of that great channel of
trade ami commerce.
The Distiict of Cobimb'R, unJer ex
istin<* laws, is not entitled to that, rcpre
sentation in the National Councils which
from ur earliest history, has been uni
formly accorded to each Territory estab
lished from time to time within onr lim
its. It maintains peculiar relations to
Congress, to whom the Constitution has
granted the power of exercising exclu
sive legislation over the seat of govern
ment. Our fellow citizens residing in
the District, whoso interests are thus
(vnfided to tho special guardianship ol
Congress, exceed in number the popula
tion of several of our Terrifi r (S, an 1 n
just reason is perceived why a delegate
of their choice should not beadm : tted to
a seat in tbe House of Representatives
No mode semis inappropriate and effect
ual of enabling them to make known
their peculiar condition and wants, and
of securing the local legislation adapted
to them. I therefore recommend the
passage of a law authorizing the electors
of the District of Columbia to choose a
delegate, to bo allowed tho same rights
and privileges as a delegato representing
a Territory. Tho increasing enterprise
and rapid progress of improvement in tho
District are highly Gratifying, and I true'
that the efforts of tho municipal author
ities to promo'c the pros'eritv of the
national metropolis will deceive the effi
cient end generous co operation of Con
gress.
The report of the commissioner of
Agriculture reviews the operations of his
Depnrtircnt during the past year, and

encourage those States which, scourged
by war, are now earnestly engaged in the
reorganization of domestic industry.
It is a subject of congratulation that
no foreign combinations against our do
mestic pesce and safety, or our legitimate
influences among the nations, have been
formed or attempted. While sentiments
of reconciliation loyalty and patriotism
have increased at home, n more just con
bidcratfon of our nat onal character and
rights have been manifested by foreign
nations.
The entire SHCCCSS of the Atlantic
Telegraph belwocn the coast of Ireland
and the Province of Newfoundland, is an
achievement which ha* boon justly cele
brated in both hemispheres as tho opening
of an era in the progress of civilization.
There is reason to expect that equal sue
cess will attend, and even greater results
follow, the enterprise for connecting the
two <"oniinent> through the Pacific Ocean
by the p'-ject'd iineof telepriph batween
Kamchatka and tho Russian Possessions

Tho resolution of Congress protesting

NUMBER 2,
The Executive, warned of an attempt
by Spnnish>-Anierican adventures to in
duce the emigration of freedmen of tha
I nited States to a foreign country, pro
tested against the project as one which,
if consummated, would reduce them- to a
boadage even mora oppressive than that
from which they have just been relieved,
'ssuranee has been received from the
Government of the State in which the
plan was matured, that the proceeding
will meet neither its encouragement nor
approval. It is a questioq worthy of jour
consideration, whether our laws upon this
su ject are adequate to the prevention or
punishment of the crime thus meditated.
In the nmnth of April last as Congress
is aware, n friendly arrengemsnt was made
between the Emperor of France and the
President of tho United States for the
withdrawal from Mexico of the Freqclf
expeditionary military forces This with
drawal was to be effected in three detach
ments the first of which, it was under
stood, would leave Mexico in November,
now past, fhe second in March next, an<{
the third and last in November, 1867.
Immediately upon the completion of the
evacuation, the French Government waq
to assume the same attitude of non inter
vention, in regard to Mexico, as is held
by the flovernmentof the United States
Repeated assurances have been given by
the Emperor, since that agreement, that
he would complete the'promised evacua
tion within the period meutioned,orifpncf
It was teasonably expected that the
proceedings thus contemplated would pit;-,
duce a crisis of great political interest in
tSe Republic of Mexico. The newly
appointed Minister of the United State;.
Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent forward,
on the 9th day of November last, to as
sume his proper functions as Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United B<ates to
that Republic. It was also thought ex
pedient that he should be attended in the
vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant
Oeneral of the Army of the United
States, with the view of obtaining such
information as might be importaot tu do
tcrmine the course to be pursued by the
United States in re establishing and main
taining necessary and proper intercourse
with the republic of Mexico. Deeply ins
tcrested in the cause of liberty and hu
manity, itseemed an obvious doty on our
part to excreise whatever influence wq
possessed for the restoration and perma
nent establishment in that eoantry of •
domestic and republican form of govern
ment.
Such was the condition of affairs in
rggaid to Mexico, when, on the 22d of
November last, official inf >rmation was
received from Paris that the Emperor of
France had some time before deeided not
to withdraw a detachment of hi# forces
in the month of Novemlier past, accord
ing to engagement, bat that this ''ecision
was made with the purpose of withdraw
ing the whole of those fore's in the en
suing spring. Of this determination,
however, '.he United Btatea had not re
ceived iny notioc or intimation; and, so
t -on as the information was received by
the tiovernment, care was taken to make
kniwn its dissent to the Emperor of
France.
I cannot forego the hope that France
will reconsider the subject. and adopt
some resolution in regard to the evacuas
lion of Mexico which will conform as
nearly as practicable with the existing
engagement, nnd thus meet the just ex
pectations of the United States The
papers relating to the subject will be laid
before yon. It is believod that, with the
evacuation of Mexico by the expedition
ary torces, no subject for serious differ
ences between France and the Uoited
Slates would remain. The expressions of
the Kmperior and people of Franco war
rant a hope that the traditionary friend
ship between the two jountries might in
that case bo renewed and permanently
restored.
A cliiin of a citizen of tho United
States for indemnity for spoliations com
mitted on the high sc»n by the French
nuihorities, in lha exercise of a bellig
erent power against Mexico, has been
met by the Government of Franco ,l»itl>
a proposition to defer settlement until a
mutual convention for the adjustment of
all claims of citizens and subjects of both
countries, arising out of the recent wars
on this Continent,shall be agreed upon by
the two countries. The suggestion isnot
ileerued unreasonable but it belongs to
Congress to diiect tho manner in which
claims for indemnity by foieigners, all
well as by citizens of the United States,
arising out of the late civil war. shall bo,
abjudicated and de'ermined. I have no
doubt that tho subject of all such claims
will engace your attention at a oonvenU
eut and proper time.
It is a matter of regret that no coo«
siderable advance has bpen made towards
aa adjustment of the differences between
the United States and Great Britain,
arising cut of tho depredations upon our
national Simmercc and other trespasses
committed during our civil war by BriU
iah subjects, in violation of international
law and treaty obligations. The delay,
however, may he believed to have resul
ted in no small degree from the domestic
situation of Great Britain. An entire
ebango of ministry occurred in that
country during tho last session of £*arli
ment. The attention of the new minis
try was called to the subject at an early
day, nnd there is some reason to expect
that it will now be considered in a becom
ing hod friendly spirit. The importance
of an early disposition of the question
cannot be exaggerated. Whatever might
be the wishes of the two Governments, it
is manifest that will and and frien4-
ship between the two countries cannot be
established until a reciprocity, in the
practico of go>d faith and neutrality,
shall be restored between tho respeotire
na'ions.
