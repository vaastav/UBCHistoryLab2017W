Practically all the time in botl
houses of congress was occupied ir
the reading of President Taft's mes
sage.
In the senate three new senators
were sworn in. They are C. A.
Swanson of Virginia, who succeed
thile late Senator Clay, and Lafayette
Young of Iowa, who takes the seat
made vacant by the death of Senatol
J. P. Dolliver.
Senator Cummins of Iowa will in,
troduce a resolution in the senate to.
morrow designed to help in the re.
vision of certain schedules of the tarifl
law. Tihe rule will permit the taking
up of a single schedule for revision
without rendering the balance of the
law open for amendment.
Senator Cummins also will Intro
duce a resolution limiting to 60 days
time a bill may be held in a senate
commitrtee. Thie resolution provides
that after that time a bill may bhi
called upon the floor of tile senate as
lhough the committee had reported
it back.
For the tirst time in a long while
tihe house today began business with
out asking divine guidance. The heavy
snow storm that has swathed the cap
ital in white so crippled the streetcar
service that Chaplin Couden did not
reach tihe capital before noon. Speak
erCannon at the stroke of 12 brought
his gavel down shortly.
"The chaplin not having arrived,"
lie announced, "'the clerk will pro
ceed withi the reading of t e journal.''
Tihe clerk proceeded, but his dron
ing was soon checked by the arrival
of I lie chaplin, who then delivered the
prayer.
BOYCOTT OF
FARM PAPER[
Merchants Association of Great Falls
Opposed the New Farm
Journal
Sam Teagarden, who formerly pub
lished his farm paper in Lewistown,
is now having some trouble in Great
Falls in regard to the patronage of
his paper. It appears that the Mer
chants' association has boycotted his
magazine on the ground that it is
not a newsspaler.
To put his case before the public
Mr. Teagarden is printing the "Buzz
Saw, for things that need ripping up
the back." Tins clever little leaflet
is published as "often as the notion
seizes" tlie publishers, and puts the
proposition before the public in a
clear light. In their felting an
nouncement the following resume of
the situation is contained:
The publishers of Montana Land-,
Farms & Stock, the new farm maga
zine which has now made-its home in
this city, find their magazine under a
boycott, carried on by the Merchants'
Association of Great Falls.
While the first number of fle mag
azine, which was designed to be ex
ploitive of the resources of Great
Falls and its surrounding count r.,
was in preparation, the publisher.
learned of a by-law of theMerclhants
association which would forbid its
members pat ronizing their periodicai
unless it was classed by the ass.rla
tion as a newspaper.
That they might have an open
field, and in order to be permitted to
submit their proposition to all cla.~se
of busirness mena on its merits, ant
effort was made to have the board ol
directors of the Merchants' associa
tion pass a resolution declaring that
in the opinion of the board the neo
publication should be classed as a
newspaper. It was pointed out tothe
board, in session, that the magazine
had been incorporated under the laws
of Montana, had purchased its oon
material, had rented and titted up an
office, and that one of the publishers
had taken a lease on a residence
house, sent for his family, and would
make his hliome in Great Falls.
The board declined to grant the
request, upon the stated plea that it
did not have tie authority to bind
the association. The promise was
given to refer the request to the next
general meeting of the organization.
After weeks of waiting, the pub
lishers managed to learn that the
date had been fixed for the general
meeting. They accordingly subinitted
a proposition for recognition. This
request was laid over for future ac
tion.
Note the sequel: The manager of
a well known local business concern,
whose firm was a member of the
Great Falls Merchants' Association,
having made a contract for 2,5oo
copies of the first number of the iag
izine and a page adveriisement there
in, but wishing to know what was
the attitude of the association, called
up the secretary of that organization
and asked for in format ion. lie w as
told that if lie persisted in tie con
tract, his firm would be fined and
very probably expelled from the asso
ciation. Mr. llartman, businessman
ager of the magazine, who was at
hand, took the phone arid asked to
have the statement repeated. This
was done by the secretary of the as
sociation, inl the same set terms as
previously used with the manager of
the local firm who had signed the
contract for copies and space in the
magazine.
The publishers, who had received
assurances of similar patronage from
a number of other tirms who were
members of the Merchants' associa
tion, desisted, however, from at
tempts to secure the business which
had been promised.
The loss because of this boycott
has been considerable, but in splite or
it the first edition has rupi to 60,000
copies and the end of the orders is
not yet.
The question will naturally occur
to the mind of the reader: "Why
should the new farm magazine be
boycotted?" The answer is simple
enough. The publication made a
splendid presentation of the land re
sources of the country about Great
Falls, and its circulation broadcast
would induce new settlers. New set
tlers ini turn would mean new mer
chants in Great Falls, and that in
t urn wou'ld mean that the stra:ngle
hold of the Merchants' association
would be broken. There was, and
there is, no other reason whatever.
And what about the effect of the
boycott upon Montana Lanlds, Farms
& Stock? Nothing more than to
stimulate its activities, but along
broader lines. While its purpose had
been to confine itself to land settle
ment work, it will from this on en
gage, with all the earnestness and
power it can muster, ini tie work of
attracting to Ureat Falls new men,
new money and new energy, and God
knows the city needs all three badly
enough.-Lewistown l)aily News.

Reports received in Billings last
week from Columbus are to the effect
that the new steel bridge over the
Yellowstone near Columbus was
closed to tralfic there by a deputy
United States marshall, who stretch
ed wire across one end or the struc
ture. It is said that the interior de
partment has taken a hand in the
bridge question, believed to have been
settled, for the reason that the land
immediately on the south side is an
Indian allotment and that the county
cannot condemn a right of way across
It without taking the matter up with
the federal authorities.
