so forbidding that your visit was cut
as short as possible! Did you ever visit
some good backwoods home where your
liedroom was cold and dark, where your
meals were cooked by your hostess, and
served without attempt at style, and
where the host said he "seen him when
he done it"! But the chances are that
true hospitality altouuded and your vis
it lasted as long as von could possibly
make it.
Hospitality may mean as much as a
general utility man means to a base
ball team. If you have nothing cle
t offer your guest, you may at least
bae hospitality. Don't apologize for
a our lack of a fine home, but do apolo
gize for the manner in which you offer
the n-e of it to your guest, unless that
manner is hospitable. If you offer the
ue of a line house to a guest and do
not offer it hospitably, it's like giving a
Christmas present after finding that a
person is going to give you one.

SPIRIT OF THE NEWS
Thursday St. Louis Republic prints
two long articles about President
Roosevelt on its first page and three
full columns on its second page under
the general caption, "What'll we do for
news after T. B.'s exit!" The articles
ileal with every pha.se of the President's
activities from his African hunt to the
entertainment of twenty chorus girls.
In the period since the last issue the
President has had several differences
with Congress, expressed vividly his
opinion of Mr. Pulitzer and the Xew
York World, called forth a long rebute
from Mr. Bryan, summoned a Harvard
student to the White louse, has been
called a coward, and has remarked that
if Mr. Hobson had a little more sense
that he would be guilty of having half
ensc. Strenuous life! Surely no one
can accuse the President of not living
up to his teachings on this ground at
any rate. There is truly danger of a
news famine when this prolific source
embarks for Africa.

The University for Women.
To the Editor of the Uulrersltr Mluoarlan:
The value of the university to women
today is as far-reaching in its effects as
the early church was in the dark ages.
There is not a girl living who if she
wants a higher education cannot get it
at a university. She roar start empty-
handed with only enough for railroad
fare and perhaps a few pennies over. A
girl of this calilier has the grit to "stay
with the ship" which is all that is nec
essary to get a degree. There is much
a girl can do to work her way through
a cosmopolitan institution and other
students, letter situated in life are al
ways willing to help those who are not
so fortunate as they. Xot all the peo
ple in the world are hard, especially at

It is an honor to the South that we

for regular expense-. In addition new-
buildings and the like have cost a fur
ther $24,020,000, Berlin alone requiring
nearly "VI million dollars.
Berlin is fast becoming for Germany
what Paris is for France, the over
whelming center of university life. In
addition to its 8520 matriculated stu
dents, about 7,000 others are permitted
to attend lectures, making a total of
only 1,000 less than the reports claim
for Pans.
In general the universities in the
large centers of population increasing
ly attract the greatest number of stu
dents in Germany. Munich has now.
3.943 full students, Leipsic 4-341. Bonn
3,209. while the smaller university
towns report no corresponding growth.
Even greater is the growth of the
technological institutes. There are ten
of these in Germany with a total en
rollment of 15.790 matriculated tttu-
dents. Through the influence of the
kaiser these schools have now lieen
placed on an equality with the uni
versities.
The woman contingent is now 2.824
in the universities, of whom 320 are
matriculated. In 1900 the mimlier was
only 6tJ4. Xaturally Berlin leads with
771, but no Prussian university will
matriculate a woman or admit her to
examinations. This right she has in
all but Rostock, in Mecklenlierg.

I'm doing a sort of second appren

pects me to know all about thiin, that
he doesn't know, but in things that he
knows something about the Minitri
School of'Agriculture "don't amount to
a hill-o'-beans." But we get aloii" to
gether just fine all the same.
Some of you fellows over there can
talk all you want to but it wasn't the
lack of coaching that lost that Thanks
giving game. The team work might
have been better but that wa not the
main thing. The fellows didn't have a
healthy, clear-cut, on-the-jiimp, don't-
give-a-rap-anyway attitude of mind to
ward the result of the game.
What they lacked has no na but
it is the stuff that a base ball pitcher
needs when the first man up makes a
three base hit. The Kansas players
had it. They went ahead and played
like samhill, letting the score take care
of itself. And it did. When the first
score was made, they just couldn't be
lieve that the game was going to keep
on going that way. Our fellows couldn't
believe it either.
Don't think that I mean they had no
fighting spirit." they made a tremeiid
oils fight, but what I'm talking of is
something different. It is what gives
tone to an athlete's mental and physical
condition; lie may or may not have it:
it is neither born nor made in him. And
though fleeting at other times, when a
"run" is started, it seems to stay with
the winner. You have seen a player in
some game that require- skill start to
winning, get excited. liecome reckle-sly
skillful for the time and just keep on
winning.
Some persons might want to call this
thing by -ome pro-aie name like 'elf-
confidence, but I say it is more than
that. It is more like faith or super
stition. But what is our conclusion Ju-t
this; we can't beat Kansas till we
break the hoodoo. There are three wax
of accomplishing this. The first is to
catch them sometime when the hoodoo
is not working for them, when they are
what the coaches call over confident.
What is over confidence It means to
have so much confidence beforehand that
you haven't any at all at the right time.
And a hoodoo doesn't work without
faith. The chances of this method are
about one in ten.
The next way is to get the hoodoo
working for us. That is worth aliout
one chance in a thousand. The other,
and the way we will finally have to do
it, is to get a fifty percent better team
that can "wollup" the Javhawkers.
hoodoo and all.
What's the use of speculations? When
you are in trouble change your Iward
