HE WANTED TO SHOW -UP
JUDGE ARCH BALD
William P. Boland Admits That He
Sought Evidence Against Him.
Washington, Dec. 10. William" P.
Boland, of Scrantou, Pa., the man
charged by Robert W. Archbald of the
commerce court with having organ
ized a conspiracy that resulted in
Judge Archbald's impeachment and
bis present trial before the senate,
admitted on the witness stand in the
Senate today that he had suggested
the verious steps by which Judge
Archbald was connected with the deal
for the Katydid refuse coal-dump, in
order to "check up Judge Archbald."
"I wanted to button up Judge Arch
bald," he said, shaking his finger at
the accused Jurist. "I wanted to show
he was the kind of a man he is."
These admissions, made under
searching questions by Judge Arch
bald's attorney, A. S. Worthington,
were interspersed with the vigorous
denunciation of Judge Archbald by
Mr. Boland as "corrupt judge" and
charges that Judge Archbald had been
"working for the railroads."
Repeated demands were made by
Judge Archbald's attorney that Mr.
Boland be required to answer ques
tions directly, but notwithstanding
cautions from President Bacon, he em
bodied in his replies sweeping charges
' against Judge Archbald and frank ad
missions that he had set out to get
hold of everything that would help in
'showing up" Judge Archbald and
that would sustain the belief he held
hat Judge Archbstld was being "used"
by the railroads.

Assails Idaho
Supreme Court
ROOSEVELT CALLS ITS DECISION
OUTRAGEOUS.
AID FOR NEWSPAPER
Colonel Asks Progressives to Retain
Able Lawyers and Pay, Fine of Boise
Journalists Charged With Contempt.
Chicago, Dec. 10. Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt and George W. Per
kins of New York were the leading
figures at the national conference of
the new progressive party b,ere to
day. Colonel Roosevelt digressing
from a prepared address, attacked the
Idaho state supreme court for its de
cision during the recent campaign re
garding presidential electors. Mr. Per
kins took the center of the stage when
it became known that certain of his
fellow progressives had started a
movement to oust him from the na
tional executive committee because of
his former corporate connections.
Roosevelt Fights for Perkins,
Colonel - Roosevelt waged the fight
for Mr. Perkins during an address to
delegates at the conference. Pointing
out Mr. Perkins and calling him by
name, Colonel Roosevelt declared that
the New York financier was one of the
men that he was- proud to have as a
fellow worker In the progressive par
ty. Mr. Perkins later made a speech in
which he asserted that he always had
been for progressive causes and meas
ures and that he resented an intima
tion that he was a new convert to the
cause.
Attacks Idaho Supreme Court.
Taking up the subject of the Idaho
sunrAmo -nnnrt'H ntnr decision Col-
! onel Roosevelt said:
"In Idaho the , election law makes
no provision for the election of pres
idential electors. The supreme court
permitted republican and democratic.
electors to he put on the ticket by
construing a provision for the election
of constables and other officers to in
clude presidential electors, but held
that the progressive ticket could not
be nominated by petition because the
highest number of -votes enumerated
as1 necessary to nominate by petition
was 300 for the election of state offi
cials. They said that the electors
were not state officials. The supreme
court of the United States has held
more than once that they are not na
tional officials.
Had to Write Names of Electors.
"I defy any honest and intelligent
man to .read that decision of the su
preme court of Idaho and compare
the laxity of the construction by which
they construed a statute which did not
make any provision fof electors at all
to permit the republican and demo-'
cratic parties to vote on the electors
and the quibbling and the technical
ity of construction by which they con
s trued the statute to prohibit the pro
gressive party from getting electors.
"The progressives of Idaho had to
write in on the election ballot the
names of the presidential electors and
the extraordinary thing that over 25,-
000 men did so write them in. Over
25,000 men and ,women, I should say.
1 am using the term men in the gen
eric sense as it always must be used
In a gathering of progressives.
An Outrageous Decision.
"Now the Capital-News of Boise,
the leading progressive paper of Idaho,
criticized that decision. The most of
fensive criticism they made was to
include a telegram from me in which
I spoke of the decision with guarded
moderation, but still with frankness.
"I hold that decision was an out
rageous decision. I hold that it was
the duty of every honest citizen to
protest against it and to denounce It
in the strongest terms.
Have Power to Ruin Paper.
"And now that Idaho court contin
uing to serve the cause of reaction
has summoned Mr. Sheridan, the edit
or of the paper, and others, before
it for contempt,
"They have it In' their power now
by the infliction of a sufficiently heavy
fine to ruin the only paper with the
Independence to stand up against such
a monstrous perversion of Justice in
Idaho.
, Progressives Should Fay Fine.
"I will advocate that the progres
sive party make good any fine and I
hope that we will send out the ablest
lawyers to fight that case and that
we give the widest publicity to our
reprobation of the conduct of that
court.
"The people of the United States
should with one voice join in condemn
ing what has been done and prevent
the consummation of the outrage."
Colonel Roosevelt's discussion of
the Idaho case was received with
cheering by the delegates that con
tinued for several minutes.
