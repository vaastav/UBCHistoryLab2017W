Burton H. Barnes, a wealthy American

daughter of the Paolis, from the mur

reward is to be the hand of the girl he

"You can wager your grog money,

This sea-dog suggestion is so dis
quieting that poor Burton paces the
: deck and sighs.
The boat has now returned, and as
[ the men scramble on deck, Edwin de
mands: "Did you put your passenger
I on shore at Bandol?"
"Aye, aye, sir, but the loon went up
; the dock as cautious as if he feared
; land sharks."
This revives in Barnes' mind Em
ory's warning, "Suspect everybody!"
The vessel is soon under way again,

[ and thinking: "No one can board us
in all probability unobserved. We are
I safe here with the Scotch crew and
I the Scotch mate." Suddenly the cigar

I start he mutters to himself: "By

one?" for at her husband's last sugges

"Nothing," stammers the bride, hid
ing her face from his glance by pick
ing up her table implements, "only I
am not a very good sailor, therefore
this delightful cuisine has no charm
for me."
As the young Corsican lady rises
from the table the English girl gets up
also; she seems to be anxious to end
her contiguity to a betrothed whose
reproachful glances at her cold and
rather haughty face have grown em- I
barrassing. !

"Would that I dared to take Marina
over the surges of the Atlantic to Eng

moodily, as Enid and his spouse disap

Finally he tacks a playing card on the
tip of the bowsprit and shoots thç
spots out of it.
"This will be a warning to this dish

crew of whom I feel a doubt, not to
make me shoot at him," cogitates the
marksman, grimly.
But his exploits with the pistol seem
to enthuse the Frenchman, rather than
dismay him. In his excited Latin way,
Leboeuf shouts louder than anyone on
deck and fairly screams with Gallic
enthusiasm as Barnes winds up by
placing a card on edge and splitting It
with his unerring bullet.
Later on Monsieur Leboeuf sets Mr.
Barnes to thinking again. He makes
his appearance and demands deter
minedly that the yacht anchor oft

"Nonsense!" dissents the American.
"Emory told me enough was put on
board yesterday to last for several
days."
"Then Monsieur has been robbed by

"If Monsieur vil observe," he leads the
way to his galley, which connects with
the vessel's ice-chest. Opening this,
he remarks:. "Ze cold storage, it has
all run out. Ver is it? Gone! Voila,
not enough for ices ce soir; not
enough to frappe ze champagne; not
enough to preserve ze legumes and s.e
beurre."
Barnes discovers that what Leboeuf
tells him is correct. During this hot
weather ice is absolutely an essential.
After a short consultation with Edwin,
Anstruther grumblingly sets the Sea*
gull's course for the French coast.
Three hours before sunset they an

Looking at the retired old French sea
pçirt, Edwin remarks: "I don't think
there's much danger of these Corsican
assassins discovering us In this out-of
the-way place for a few hours," and
sends the dingy on shore carrying
Monsieur Leboeuf and directing him
to make the necessary purchases and
bring them off at once.
"VVe'Il keep the ladies safe on board,
and no shore boats shall come along

FIGHT WITH SAVAGE LION.
Adventurous Hunter Paid for Sport
With His Life.
From the Sudan comes the report of
a fierce fight between a wounded lion
and a government engineer, which
ended in the death of the latter, an
Englishman named C. H. Salmon.
Salmon, while on board the steamer
Metemmah, between Fashoda and
Melut, on the White Nile, discovered
a lion among the bushes on the shore. •
Taking a gun, he went ashore asking j
those on board not to follow him. He
shot twice at the lion, one bullet tak

the other in the abdomen,

seemed to be his death agony, the lion

to maul him. The engineer held the

Gigantic Potatoes.
Big potatoes which weigh as much
as a man are not often seen,
consignment of them, however, has
just been sent off from the West In
dies. There were just six potatoes,
and each was large enough to feed a
big family. Yam is the popular name
applied to this variety of giant sweet
potato. The tubers usually attain a
length of three feet and an average

weight of 30 pounds. Yams weighing
from 100 to 150 pounds, however, are
by no means uncommon in the West

Judges Too Poorly Paid.
Coupled with a eulogy of the Ju

urges that, beginning with the su

their salaries doubled.
As was to be expected, the attitude
assumed by certain labor leaders dur
ing the recent election comes in for
bitter criticism.
The president as
serts that demands made on congress
for legislation were unjust and im
practical and could bnt work harm to
the cause of labor. While declaring
that our judicial system is sound and
effective at core, the president says:
There are certain decisions by various
courts which have been exceedingly det
rimental to the rights of wage-workers.
This is true of all derisions that decide
that men

anteed their liberty" to contract to enter
a dangerous occupation, or to work an

or to work In unhealthy surroundings:
and therefore cannot recover damages
when maimed In that occupation, and
cannot be forbidden to work what the
legislature decides is an excessive
ber of hours, or to carry on the work
under conditions which the legislature
decides to be unhealthy.
There is also, I think, ground for the
belief that substantial Injustice is often
suffered by employes In consequence of
the custom of courts issuing temporary
injunctions without notice to them, and
punishing them for contempt of court in
