THE ESTEY POLICY.
The numerous pianos designated as
"stencils" are pianos which cannot be
traced to the factory in which they were
made. Such pianos have no standing, and
no firm, can be held responsible for them.
The Estey Company takes pride in the
fact that it does not carry in stock an in
strument of such a "caste." Every instru
ment it handles is of known origin, either
an Estey or some other reputable make.

It seems like the Irony of fnto that
the man who Invented and exploited tho
Aladdin's lamp oven with whloh ho
taught people how to cook proicrly
should die from Indigestion.
The calamity howlers, whoso voices
swelled in high chorus last July, whon
the government receipts showed a deficit
of (23,000,000, nro naturally disappointed
In the estimate of President Shnw that
there will be a deficit of only (8,000,000 at
the end of the current fiscal year.
Secretary Bonaparte of tho navy de
partment tnkes rank as tho high chief
Iconoclnst when he projmsos that the
old warship Constitution bo used as a
tnrget for gun practice by tho up-to-dato
ships of the navy. The protests which
have poured In from every direction will
precludo any such action. Mr. Bonaparte
seems' to be entirely devoid of sentiment.
The President's recommendation that
the Congress carefully consider whether
the burenu of corporations cannot con
stitutionally be extended to cover Inter
state transactions In Insurance, will bo
sure to provoke a sharp controversy In
Congress and a wide discussion outside
Congress. The recommendation Is . not
new, being merely n reaffirmation of what
the President said In n message to the
58th Congress, but recent events have
given the subject a new Importance and
an added emphasis.
Evidently cities and town containing
presidential post offices are not to be
rent with Internecine strife over the nest
nppolntment except In rnrc cases. Post
master General Cortelyou lias announced
thnt merit has preference jvcr political
Influence. It Is said that the President is
not only In accord with this ruling, but
that he Is tho author of the continuous
service policy. Tho understanding In
Washington Is that the oillco of every presi
dential postmuKter will receive a rating
after being reported upon by a post office
Inspector, and If tho rating Is high tho
administration will take the responsibility
to reappoint the present Incumbents, un
less the Congressman of the district can
show good and sufficient reasons ngalnst
a reappointment.
Tho Immigration problem is brought to
mind again by the annual report of Frank
P. Sargent, which shows In a year 1,020,199
aliens landed on our shores with tho ex
pectation of making homes here. Tho
number was an Increase of 213,629 over
tho preceding year. Mr. Sargent predicts
that tho chief source of futuro Increases
In Immigration are Russia mid Austria
Hungary. -Air. Sargent says that the
problems of Immigration "loom so largely
In U10 prospect of our country that It
may bo said without giving Just cause to
charge exaggeration, that all other ques
tions of public economy, relating to things
rather than to. human beings, shrink Into
comparative Inslgnlflcanco."
Tho annual report of Postmaster Gen
eral Cortelyou contnlns some striking
sentences. Here Is one; "I am less con
cerned about the deficit than I am about
efficiency of administration." Hero Is
another: "For tho time being, attention
can be moro profitably devoted to an im
provement of the service already estab
lished than to an immedinto consideration
of such questions as the reduction of rates
of postage, a parcels post, postage savings
depositories, a postn) telegraph and tele
phono nnd kindred subjects." The deficit
for the year ended June 30, 1905, was $14,
572.584.13, ngalnst $8,779,492.30 in 1904. Mr,
Cortelyou estimates' the deficit for the
year ending next June nt $14,441,116. But
for tho rapid extension of tho rural free
delivery service the post oillco department
would now bo self-sustaining.
The oxtcnt of the land frauds througout
tho western states has- been revealed to
some extent through the special articles
from time to tlmo In the Boston Tran
script, but it is surprising to learn from
the annual report of Secrotary Hitchcock
of the interior department that his agents
are n&W at work to punish frauds In 20
states and that In tho cases already
brought to the attention of the courts
thcro have been 30 convictions and 532
Indictments. Some of tho most Important
prosecutions have been in California and
Oregon, and In the latter etato the late
United States Senator Mitchell and Con
gressman Herrman wer convicted. Mr.
Hitchcock has found that In two countlej
in Kansas 22 persons were holding 122,000
acres of land illegally. In Nebraska
frauds have been very extensive, and two
men who are alleged to have maintained
in unlawful Irtclosure a quarter of a
million acres escaped with a fine of $300
each. The Lewlston frauds involve 10,
000 acres of the best tlmberlaod In Idaho,
Many frauds are reported'from the south
em states, but the holdings of the opera
tors there ore not so large as in the West
It its understood that the dragnet is now
close to United States senators from a
western state and other officials who have
not figured in the scandals publicly up
to the present time.
See "Old Bl StebblnB" tomorrow after
noon ana evening.
Senator E. W. Cnrmack, who has been
described ns having "a caustic tongue,
nn endless vocabulary nnd leather lungs'"
Is going the length nnd breadth of Ten
nessee shouting praises of Theodore
Roosevelt. He was formerly chief critic
of tho President In tho Senate, but the
now light which has come to him la said
to bo due to the fact that he has found
that Roosevelt Is extremely popular with
the people of Tennessee, and Carmnck In
his fight to retain his scat has adopted
tln method of fulsome praise. His op
ponent Is "Bob" Taylor, ex-governor,
famous as the "fiddling statesman."
The personnel of the new British minis
try-was announced Sunday, with Sir Henry
Cnmpbell-Banncrmnn as premier. ' Sir
Robert Thrcshle Rcld, lord high chancel
lor, Herbert Henry Asqulth chancellor
of the exchecquer, Herbert John Glad
stone secretnry of homo affairs und Sir
Edward Grey secretary of foreign affairs.
Sir Henry Campbell-Baniierman has held
many Important public positions since
1871 und has been leader of tho Liberal
party since 1899. Mr. Gladstone Is the
fourth son of tho great statesman and
received his political training as secretary
to his father. He Is an advanced Liberal,
favoring homo rule, free trade nnd tho
abolition of the veto power. John Morlcy,
the widely known author, holds tho posi
tion of secretary of state for India under
the new regime, .nnd John Burns, tho
labor leader, Is given the post of presi
dent of tho local government.
Tho Boston Journal went beyond any
other newspaper of flambouyant Journal-
Ism In handling tho Mary Rogers case,
when In Its cartoon "Blot," it depicted
the hand of Gov. Bell pouring a bottle
of Ink over the stnte of Vermont. Gov.
Bell had absolutely no connection with
the conviction or tho legal procedure of
the case other than to grant tho first
reprieve when the claim of new cvldcnco
was advanced and the second to avoid
any clash with the federal courts. Ho was
urged to Interfere with tho operation of
tho machinery of the law, nnd this he re
fused to do, notwithstanding that his
own views nro said to be against capital
punishment. Ho was placed In a very
trying position, but ho took tho only con
sistent course open to him. It was not
his place, after the courts and legislature
had said that Mary Rogers should dlo to
stop the execution. Criticism of Attorney
General Fltts also rests upon no founda
tion. He simply performed the disagree
able duties which were Incumbent upon
him through his official position. Through
nil of the course of the case Vermont has
had a governor nnd nn attorney general
who have carried themselves with poise,
dignity and good sense.
Death of Edward Atkinson.
Edward Atkinson, 78; the widely known
political economist, dropped dead Monday
from 1111 attack of acute Indigestion while
about to enter his ofllce In Boston. After
attending private schools In Boston ho
received a business training In commis
sion houses In that city. From 184S to
is, 1 lie was connected with several large
manufacturing companjes ns clerk and
treasurer. He then became president of
the Boston Manufacturers' Mutual Fire
Insurance company, nn office which ho
held to the tlmo of his death.
In 18S7 he was nppolntcd by President
Cleveland special commissioner to report
upon tho status of bimetallism In Europe.
He. was one of the most prominent mono
metalllsts of New England. Ho wns ono
of the founders of the New England Emi
grant Aid society, nnd a founder nnd
director of tho Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
Mr. Atkinson s devotion to old-fashion
ed Ideas of honesty and economy In the
life of the people did great good, and ho
was nn Incessant preacher of economy.
The Aladdin oven, which ho Invented nnd
exploited, wns calculated to accomplish
moro good than It has achieved. This dqvlce
ior eooKingi or, ns tie put it, "teaching
peoplo to slew," utilized the heat from
a common lamp for making soups and
cooKing all kinds of food for tho table.
Ho demonstrated that a man could thus
provide for his family at the cost of a
fow cents a day, and he was fond of giv
ing exhibitions of his apparatus and tho
delicacies It was capable of turning out.
Tho'thought which Mr. Atkinson develop
ed came to him when going over a build
ing on n cold day, when the workmen
wcro opening their dinner palls. Cold
victuals and pie did not seem to him good
fuel for the human furnace, and ho set
about devising something better. Mr. At
kinson practiced what he preached. Ho
wore the clothes that he recommended tho
man of slender means to buy, nnd ho nto
the food which he told others to eat, after
having cooked it himself, as he had ad
vised others to cook It.
