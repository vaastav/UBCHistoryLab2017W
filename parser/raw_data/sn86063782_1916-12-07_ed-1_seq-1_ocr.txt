Wilson In Message
f
AsksMoreConi
> Declares
That Their Operation
Should Not Be Stopped
or Interrupted by the Concerted
Action of Organized
Bodies of Men Until a Public
Investigation Shall Have
Been Instituted.
IN one of the shortest messages
ever sent to conRress President
Wilson urges that early action
be taken to complete hla program
of "settlement and regulation"
recommended at the last session. The
message In full Is as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty
laid upon- me by the constitution of
communicating to you from time to
time information of*the state' of the
Union and recommending to your con
slderation such legislative measures as
may be judged necessary and expedl
ent I shall continue the practice, which
I hope has been acceptable to you. of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments
the elaboration of the detailed needs
of the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general
public policy with which it seems nec
essary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time under
which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my suggestions
as few as possible. But there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the Interest of the public
to do at once.
%
The Railroad Problem.
In the first place, it seems to me im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration and action
recommend to you at the close <jt your
last session' in view of the public daugets
disclosed tyfcthe unaccommodated
difficulties which then existed and
" which still unhappily continue to ex
1st between the railroads of the coun
try and their locomotive engineers
conductors and trainmen.
I then recommended:
First, Immediate provision for tinenlargement
and administrative reorganization
of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the bill recentlv nassed bv the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate In order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various du
ties now devolving upon it- with a
promptness and thoroughness which
are, with Its present constitution and
means of action, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an eight
hour day as the legal basis alike of
work and of wages in the employment
of all railway employees who are actually
engaged In the work of opernt
lng trains in Interstate transportation.
Third, the authorization of the appointment
by the president of a small
body of men to observe the actual results
In experience of the adoption of
the eight hour day in railway transportation
alike for the men and for the
railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the congress
of the consideration by the interstate
commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered necessary
by the adoption of the eight
hour day and which have not been offset
by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts disclosed
justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation and arbitration
of such controversies as the present by
adding to It a provision that, In case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fail, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be Instituted and
completed beforo a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
control oy tne executive.
And, sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power.
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
lng stock of the railways of the country
as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
StateB such train crews and adminlb
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use
The second and third of these recommendations
the congress immediately
acted on: It established the eight
hoar day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service and it authorised
the appointment of a commission
to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed, but
It postponed action upon the other suggestions
until an opportunity should be
offered for a more deliberate consider
atlon of them.
The fourth recommendation I do not
4#tm It necessary to renew. The pow

in doing so would ba to adopt a
new principle into our jurisprudence
which I take it for granted
we are not prepared to intro

operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or

until a publio investigation shall

New Legislation Necessary.
The necessity for such legislation la
lanlfest and pressing. Those who have
utrusted us with -the responsibility
tnd duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would flnd it
Mi T 11 falliira to
tct upon these grave-matters or any
tnneeessary postponement of action.
Not only does the interstate commerce
commission now And it practical
ly Impossible, with its present membership
and organization, to perform Its
great functions promptly and thoroughly,
but it is not unlikely that it may
presently be found advisable to add to
its duties still others equally heavy and
exacting. It must tirst be perfected as
an administrative instrument.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances
for lack of additional means of arbitration
and conciliation which the congress
can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the executive
to make immediate and uninterrupted
use of the rnilrouds for the concentration
of the military forces of the
nation wherever they ure needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, prevention
and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere
statement of it. With regnrd to one ol
its items, the increase In the efficiency
of the Interstate commerce commission,
the house of renrrsentntives hna al
ready acted. Its action needs only tbr
concurrence of the senate.
To Safeguard Industrial Processes.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare Ray the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should 1
make it, that any man In any occupation
should he obliged hy law to continue
in an employment which he deaired
to leave.
To pass a law which forbade or prevented
the individual workman to leave
his work before receiving the approval
of society in doing so would be to
adopt a new principle into our Jurisprudence
which I take it for granted
we are not prepared to Introduce. But
the proposal that the operation of the
railwuys of the country shall not be
stopiK?d or Interrupted by the concerted
action of organized bodies of men
until n public investigation shall have
been Instituted which shall make the
whole question-at issue plain for the
Judgment of the opinion of the nation
is not to propose any such principle.
It is based upon the very different
principle that the concerted action ol
powerful bodies of men shall not be
permitted to stop the industrial pro
cesses of the nation, at any rate before
the nation shall have had an opportunity
to acquaint itself with the merit;

employer, time to form its opinion upor
an impartial statement of the merits
and opportunity to consider all practl
cable means of conciliation or arbltra
tlon.
I can see nothing In that proposltior
but the Justifiable safeguarding by so
clety of the necessary processes of 1U
very life. There is nothing arbitrary
or unjust in it uhless it be arbitrarily
and unjustly done. It can and shouk
be dono with a full and scrupulous re
gard for the interests and liberties ol
all concerned as well as for the per
manent Interests of society Itself.
Three matters of capital lmportanci
await the action of the senate whlcl
have already been acted upon by thi
house of representatives?the bill whlcl
seeks to extend greater freedom o
combination to those engaged Is pre
mottng the foreign commerce of the
country thnn Is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the
laws against monopoly, the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto
Rico and the bill proposing a more
S thorough and systematic regulation of
' the expenditure of money In elqptiens,
commonly called the corrupt practices
act. I need not labor my advice that
these measures be enacted into law.
Their urgency lies In the manifest circumstances
which render their adoption
ut this time not only opportune
but necessary. Even delay would seriously
Jeopard the Interests of the
country and of the government.
Immediate passage of the bill to regulate
the expenditure of money in
elections may seem to be less necessary
than t* e immediate enactment of
the other measures to which ! refer,
because at least two years will elnpse
before another election In which federal
offices are to be filled, but It would
greatly relievo the public mind If this
Important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dangers
to the public morals of the. present
method of obtaining and spending
campaign rtinds stand clear under recent
observation and the methods of
expenditure cau be frankly studied la
the light of present experience. And a
delay would have the further serlone
disadvantage of postponing nctlon.-jfefe*
til another election was at hand dud
some special object connected with If

those who urged It. Action can bo
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
Enlarging Our Export Trad*
I shall not argue at length'tba desirability
of giving a freer hand In the

will give freedom without permitting

be done now, because the opportunity
Is here and may escape us If we hesitate
or de'.ay.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of'
Porto Itleo Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
, Its people are not Just. We have cre1
ated expectations of extended privilege
which w*e have not satisfied.
There Is uneasiness among the people
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our Intentions

of the pending measure would happily
remove. We do not doubt what we
wish to do In any essential particular.
We ought to do It at once.

WHY COTTON 18 HIGH
| The Wall Street Journal's rijlaHHw
of Present Prices.
Spot cotton on the New York Ex*
change averaged 19.88 cents a pound
in November of this year, or $99.40 a
bale. There were times in that Month
\ when it sold as high as 20.96 eents,
, or $yOi.75 a bale. Its course since
the 16th day of November. 1914, when
the Exchange reopened, la almost unbelleveble.
Many of those who deal meet in
cotton feared that It would not Come
back?wur would destroy the mftfket.
Accordingly, the average price fa# the
[ November, 1914, period was 7.67 Cents,
or $38.35 a bale for a product that
costs at least $50 to produce. The
following month was still more giSoiay
and the average price went to tAl.
From that time on It t* an ldWfeeting
study to trace the upward tMtrae.
Step by step, sometimes losing 9 little
ground, but always regalalitf
the advance was maintained unit! De'

With some recessions the idrinee
was steadily maintained throlfhoot
' the past months of 1919, but It was
' not until July that cotton c*0C off
' the shackles of doubt and feftf and
entered the llata as a real Maftthon
runner.

cause of this advance It Is trite the
