President's Message-
We had intended to furnish our readers
with the President's Message in to day's
piper, but the detention of the mail train
prevented us from receiving i copy until
several ours after is was due.
The Message briefly refers to foreign af
fairs —rep-esents the condition of the fi
nances as gratifyiug—recommends the or
ganization of the militia on a uniform ba
sis—and a more efficient organization of
the navy.
A reorganization of the Supreme Court
is desirable, there being now three vacan
cies on the bench.
A general revision of the laws is recom
mended. Congress is asked to devise a
jdan temporally for the administration of
justice in all such parts of the insurgent
States and Territories as may be under the
control of this government, whether by a
voluntary return to allegiance and order, or
by (he power of our arms.
He proposes to colonize contraband
slaves, as well as others who may be euian- •
cipatcd or taken at a valuation in some
proper territory to be set apart for that pur
pose.
" In considering the policy to be adopted
fur suppressing the insurrection, I have
beer, anxious and careful that the inevita
ble conflict tor this purpoe shall not de
generate into a violent arid lemorseless rev- j
olutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in
every ease thought it proper to keep the
■ r crily of the Union prominent, as the
j .11 try object of the contest on our part,
ieu -ng ail que.-;ions which arc not of vital
i. iiry impoi ;. to tire wise deliberation
of the Legialatu
•• Jhe I n: n iuut be preserved, and
oui-peiisible means may be era
p! We should not be in haste to de
t- :u ue that rudicil and extreme measures,
which may reach the loyal as well as the
disloyal, are indispensable."
"The inaugural address at the beginning
of the Administration, and the message to j
Congress at the late special session, were
both mainly devoted to the domestic con- i
troversy out of which the insurrection and .
consequent war have sprung. Nothing more
occurs to add or subtract to or from the
principles or general purposes stated and
expressed in that document. The last ray
of hope for preserving the Union peaceably ;
expired, and the assault upon Fort Sumter,
and a general review of what has occurred
since may not be unprofitable."
" It continues to develop that the insur- !
reeiion is largely, if not exclusively, a war
upon the first principles of popular govern
ment—the rights of the people. Conclu
sive evidence of this is found in the most
grave and maturely considered public doc- j
nments, as well as in the general tone of
the insurgents. In these documents we
find the acknowledgment of the existing I
right of suffrage, and the denial to the
people of all right to participate in the se
i "tion of public officers, except the Legis- 1
Wure, boldly advocated, with labored ar
guments to prove that large control of the
people in Government is the source of all
political trouble."
•' Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at
us a possible refuge from the power of the
paoplc."
"In my present position I could scarce- !
ly be justified were I to omit raising a war
ning voice agaiust this approach of return
ing despotism."
The message closes with an allusion to j
labor and capital, placing the iorrner first
in the structure of our government.
BSSL-Maryland s ill has nests of tories who
will not stop their foul work until they taste
bemo. An eastern shore judge a few weeks
ago instructed the grand jury to indict all
{>* -ons who had furnished the United States
luMjoritivs with information ; and last week
the Ret. I>r. Rtrftock, Past r df the Presby

Locofoco Intrigues
Notwithstanding the terrible war in
which our country is involved, the old leav
en of locofocoistn—the same which bowed
1 down in humble adoration to the " nigger
< calf" set up by the hellhounds who sur-
rounded and controlled the administration
of J-mes Buchanan; the same which, in
, the name of democracy, scattered our army
and navy, despoiled our national ar
mories, and robbed our mints—is again
! rearing its head in its old guise, and seek-
I ing to acquire power and office at any sac
rifice. A few months ago this hydra head
ed faction, shrinking from public vengeance,
was tame as a sucking lamb. Their speech
es and harangues were full of " union"—
they knew no party —and in their humility
even acknowledged that the infamous re
bellion got up by Davis, Yancy, Cobb,
Floyd, Thompson, and other lights of pat
ent democracy, was not the result of abo
litionism, or of the success of the Repub
lican party, but a deep laid scheme, in pro
cess of incubation during the past thirty
5 years. To this heart wrung acknowledge
1 j ment the Holts, the Dickinsons, the Dixs,
' and other honest leaders who felt them- ,
' selves the dupes of the southern conspira- I
tors, still adhere; but not so the syco
phantic editors and political trimmers who ]
think they see success in future public ;
debt acd consequent taxation—measures \
unpopular with unreflecting men no matter
j how just or necessary. In the meantime
many of these men wormed themselves in
' to the confidence of the General and J?tate
administrations, and under the plea of "no
party" obtained all grades of military offi
ces from General down to anything
that would pay, and now it is no uncommon :
j boast to hear some Breckinridger proclaim
that the vast military organization of the '
government is in the hands of " Breckin
! ridge democrats!" For our part, we seldom
inquired or cared what the politics of this
or that man was, so that he possessed qual
j ifications for military office, until we heard
this boast proclaimed; and we must confess
that our faith has been somewhat shaken j
in reviewing the military as well as some
other appointments made both by the Na
tional as well as our State Government.
Ihe old Pennsylvania State robbers—the
" union-savers" of 1856 —with a horde of
j "orators" of that period who at times were
so intoxicated as to defer their " union"
harangues to another day—one of whom
even recently, if common rumor is correct, '
denounced the raising of a company "to j
fight Lincoln's war" a " d—d foolish
thing"—now strut round with epaulettes
on their shoulders, ordering Pennsylva j
ia's brave and true rank and file hither and
thither! If Governor Curtin will send
some special and trustworthy agents to gath j
er up facts respecting a number of officers
who unfortunately have received appoint
ments at his hands, he will find just such
characters as we have designated the re
cipients of his favors—men who are cith
er speculating on the wants and neeessi
ties of the poor soldier, or spending their
time in disgraceful scenes of drunkenness.
Justice to the brave and patriotic soldiers j
demands that these evils should be stern- ;
ly rebuked.
To come back, however, to our original '
purpose of noting the doings of the politi- j
cal trimmers in this State, we refer to the '
late demonstration made by Chas. J. Bid
die, Col. of one of the Philadelphia Regi- i
ments. He was in the service in June i
last, and in answer to a nomination for '
: Congress replied as follows :
"CAMI* MASON AND DIXON'S LINE, J j
" Beyond Ccntreville, via Bedford, Pa., >
"Jane 29, 1861. j
"Hon. A. Y. Parsons: The nomination
takes me wholly by surprise. I thank you j
all for this great and unsolicited honor. I
am, I trust, a true son of Pennsylvania, ready I
j to serve her when, and where, and how she
pleases. My present position is most con- ;
genial to me ; but I will not place my own
preference in opposition to the people's wish.
If elected. I will serve as soon as I can quit
the tented field without dishonor. Philadel
phia would not expect me sooner. I will give
,no partigtm pledges. I will try to do my duty
in whatever Bphere it may please God to place .
me. CHARLES J. BIDDLE."
j On the strength of this declaration—pa
triotic enough on its face—this man was
elected to Congress just as Mr. May was
at Baltimore—but no sooner does he think
his way is clear than he comes out in a
tirade of abuse of the republican party, !
the war, and the administration, worthy of
the most devoted disciple of Jef Davis or i
any other traitor.
Under such leaders, the patent demo-'
critic editors are taking their cue, and act
ing accordingly. As long as they acknowl
edged the southern traitors as their mas
ters in politics, they religiously followed
the southern cry of " abolition," whieh was
the length, breadth, and strength of their
argument. For a time it was dropped, but
is again finding favor. In the meantime
the traitors south have fouud ajiotker word
lor our patriotic soldiers : they call them
Hessiant and in order that northern
patent democrats may not be behind their
late " brethren" in the south, the term is
; al*o finding its way into sundry patent dem-
• ocratic prints—see Lewistown Democrat of
i last week*
- ' In this, as in other matters, tastes of
I | course differ; but for our part we suppose
rj most foiks would rather be called anything
-! our soldiers are called by rebels and traitors,
i j than the most honied word in use among
i | the latter as applied to themselves.
PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS.
i | The first session of the Tbirty-seventh
; Congress commenced at Washington on
• Monday. A quorum was present both in
| the House and Senate, and as Loth had
, | previously organized, they at once proceed
jed to business. A joint committee was
' appointed to wait on the President, but
the Message was not transmitted. It is
uuderstood that the Message is more than
usually brief. In both Houses the confis
! cation of slaves was introduced by resolu
tions. In the Senate notice was given of
| a resolution to abolish the distinction he- j
! tween the regular and volunteer array. The
i House adopted resolutions declaring that
: as Colonels Corcoran and Wood had been
placed in confinement as felons by the reb- ]
i el authorities, and ordered to be treated "as
prisoners convicted of infamous crimes,"
! that the President be therefore requested
j to order John Slidell and James M. Mason
to the same character of prison and treat-
I ment. A resolution of inquiry in relation
to the disastrous result of the battle of
Ball's Bluff was passed.
j Two more States have been added to the
Southern Confederacy! Jefferson Davis'
announces to the Southern Congress that
; treaties have been made between this Gov- j
i
j eminent and the States of Missouri and
. 1
j Kentucky, by which they become part of'
| the Soutbern Confederacy. These last ac
; cessions to the rebel cause are among the
most extraordinary that have yet been
made. A cabal of traitors in the lower
part of Kentucky, after having been beat
j en by the loyal people of that State, time
and again, with overwhelming shame—af
; ter having been driven from their homes 1
by the loyal citizens around them—have
assembled as a mass convention in an ob
scure county court house, and, assisted by
such men as John C. Breckinridge and
Henry Burnett, have passed what they call j
a Declaration of Independence, asserting
themselves to be a separate government,
and apply to Jefferson Davis for admission
i into the Southern Confederacy. In Mis- :
' souri the case is almost parallel. In both
; of these States, says the Press, the rebels
have but doubtful footing, and control but 1
a small portion of the territory. They are
neither authorities in fact, nor authorities
in name. They possess no power, nor is j
their jurisdiction recognized, llow fear- !
fully degraded and shameless must a gov- i
ernmcut be which cau resort to such means
to strengthen its power, and give prestige
to its authority ! Missouri and Kentucky i
members of the Confederacy ? Jefferson
Davis might as well claim to be master of
Massachusetts or Pennsylvania.
Broad Tup Railroad in now run
to its full capacity, and is still unabie to sup*
ply the demand for its coal.

have commenced the experiment of a daily
paper in Erie.

tafA. letter has been received from Geo.
D. Prentice, Esq.. dated New York, Nov. 2oih,
stating 'bat he had nothing to do with the
article ia the Louisville Journal concerning
tin. speech made by Secretary Cameron at the
dinner party lately given bv Col. Forney in
honor of Mr. Prentice. Th entire article in
the Journal was a misrepresentation of the
speech, sent by some person without the
knowledge of Mr. Prentice. Secretary Cam
eron's opinions upon the subject are the same
as those expressed in bis instructions to Gen
erals Butler and Sherman, and it is under
stood that they will be reiterated ia his an
nual report to the President.
r[ WARNE W S .
p The military tuovelnentj in the M eat
, are assuming great importance. Accor
, ding to the Cincinnati Inquirer, twenty
five thousand troops left Carondolet, Mis
, { souri, on the 24th ultimo, for Cairo. '1 he
same day eight thousand troops passed
| down the Ohio for Louisville. General
i Thomas' Brigade, also about eight thou
j sand strong, is to move to Elisabeth town,
' in the vicinity of Louisville, whe e is the
I J
> great rendezvous for the troops and stores
, intended undoubtedly for a movement
' against Nashville. Twentv five thousand j
I
: troops will soon be on their way from Wes I
j tern Virginia to Louisville, and the Nash
ville division will then number nearly one
hundred thousand men The Louisville j
Democrat of Friday contains some signifi- i
cant in imations relative to this Nashville
movement. It says : " Our readers may
j "as well prepare to hear, before the close
| "of this month, news as stirring as that
j '• from the great fleet, and this time the
! u news will be of more interest to us, be
" cause of its nearness. Kentucky will, to j
i " a great extent, end the war, so far as the
I land forces are concerned."
i Advices from Missouri say that the
Rebel army, some 15,000 strong, since the !
evacuation of Springfield, vas moving in
three divisions. The right wing, 6,000
strong, under Meßride, is resting at Stock
ton. The left, under Rains, 4,000 men,
' rested near Nevado, aud the centre, under
1 1
t Price, 5,000 men, was at or near Monte
r ville. Price intended to march into Kansas j
and operate there. General Lane was at ;
| Fort Scott with 5,000 men, but Price in
tended to evade him. M'cCulloch had been ;
| ordered to follow Price but refused, and
was going into winter quarters in Arkan
sas.
In Missouri the country between Lex
: ington aud Independence is said to be des
erted, the men having gone off with the
Rebel army. Jennison's Kansas men were i
laying waste the country in Jackson coun
w. . i
Some anxiety having been expressed
lest the Nashville, last heard from at
' Southampton, just after having done a deed .
i of shameless piracy, should molest the ship
; Arago, and perchance capture General •
Scott and Mr. Thurlow Weed, the New
York Tribune calls to mind the fact that '
the Arago carries four rifled cannon of
I long range, has a number of small arms,
and can be defended by a crew of 100 men
The Nashville will not be to> ready to .t- j
tack such an antagonist.
Another valuable prize arrived at the
j Brooklyn Navy Yard on .Suid iy, which
was captured after a three hours' chase, on
the 25th ult., by the steamer Pengin, whi'e
lieadiug for EdUto Bland, near Charleston,
.V C. She proved to be the schooner Ai
j biou, from Nassau, New Providence, ladcu
with a cargo worth SIUO,OOO, consisting
of salt, oil, tin, fruit, aud also the suspi
cious articles of arms, ammunition, saddles
and cavalry equipments. When brought
to by the Penguin's guns she reported her
self bound for New York, from Nassau,
with fruit and salt; but upon searching i
j her the additional curgo of contraband of
1 war was fouud on board. The officers turn
out to be citizens of Savannah.
Later advices have been received at New
York from Port Royal. Tatnall's attack
on the Federal gunboats at Tybee Island ;
was a farce. He merely fired a few shots
and then ran under the protection of Fort
| Pulaski. Beaufort was to be taken posses- j
sion of on the 29th by five thousand of our
troops. An expedition was preparing,
| supposed to be for Fernandina, Florida.— j
Five thousand troops were to go under the
I convoy of the Wabash and a number of;
| men-of-war.
The transport steamships Illinois and Er-
I icsson, arrived at New York from Port Roy- |
i al. bring intelligence of unusual interest
I from the Southern coast. A portion of the
fleet had taken unopposed possession of Ty
bee Island at the mouth of the Savannah.— j
The position is one of great strategetic impor- I
tance with the view to future operations
against Savannah, whilst it immediately clos
es the outlet to the sea from that port, the
; ship channel running within six hundred
yards of the island. Tybee Island and the
, Southern extremity of Hilton Head Island,
are on the opposite sides of the mouth of Sa
vannah river. At Braddock's Point, the ex- j
tremity of Hilton Head Island, the Coofeder
ates had constructed a fort which they aban- l
doned when the P.irt Royal forts were cap
tured. This fort has now been garrisoned by '
our forces and the guns placed in a servieea- j
ble condition. Immediately adjoining Ty
bee Island is Cockspur Island, upon which
stands Fort Pulaski, a strong casernated work
which fell into the possession of the Rebels
when Georgia seueded. Com. Dupont in
forms the Navy Department that the posses
sion of Tybee Island gives them a positon
witfiin easy shelling distance of Fort Pulaski.
From Port Royal we learn that the troops
are all in good health and spirits. The dis
mounted guns have been replaced in Fort
Walker, the works themeelves have been
i strengthened and repaired, and new worka |
are on foot, two thousand men being employ* I
Ed on them ; a long warf is also building.—
Many bodies of slain Rebels haw been dis
| eoteredi Hma barfed in the Mtnd by the die*
charge of shel!s>andsome hidden in the woods,
l The boasted battery of five guns from Char*
j leston was also found in the woods, two of the
pieces hating been spiked. Arrangements
were in progress at Port Royal to despatch a
j joint naval and military expedition to some
point on the Southern coast.
! Adjutant General Thomas has sent instruc
tions to Gen. Sherman, at Port Royal, to seize
all the cotton, corn. rice, and crops of various
sorts, within his reach ; to use what is neces
sarv and of value for the subsistence of his
troops, and to send the cotton to New \urk,
there to be sold for the benefit of the Govern
ment. Gen. Sherman is also directed to take
the services of negroes, not only to aid in
I gathering the crops, but also in making forti j
I ficati >ns.
Attack on the 2Ath Pennsylvania.
Some excitement was occasioned at Sandy
liook, Md., ou Friday afternoon by the reb
, els throwing about thirty shells at the quar
ters of some companies of the 28th regiment, j
j under the command of Major Hector Tyn- j
dale, at Harper's Ferry. Major Tyndale
tried the effect of the long range Enfield* on
| th'-in, but the distance, being 2000 yards, was
: too great. Although s >me of the firing of i
the rebels was fair, nobody was hurt. Our j
men were well deployed, and ready for a clos
| er range, which the rebels would not give
. them.
New YORK, Dec. 2. J
The stearuer MeClellan has arrived from j
Tybee Island and Hilton Head. She carried I
Gen Sherman and staff to Tybee Island,
where a rec.>rnuisance was made during
which four shells from Fort Pulaski burst
near the party No damage was done bow
ever. On the return with the Gen. to Hilton
Head the McCteUan passed the gun boat \
Florida with C >u*. Dupoat on board bound to
the Savanna* river. The Florida returned
the .-ante evening. The MeClellan left Hil
t r> Head on Thursday night and brings
mails ;uid despatches trout Gen. Sherman and j
C m. Dupont. The health of the troops was
perfect. No news from other points.
LEAVENWORTH. Nov. 30.
The train on the Piatt County Railroad
was seized yesterday on its arrival at Weston, (
by the guerrillas under Sergeant Gordon, and i
the U. 8. express company's freight appro j
priated. All the money in eharge of the ex- j
press was saved. The mail matter was not 1
taken. Gordon bad previously robbed the
stores of several Union men of Weston. No !
more trains will be run on that road till this
gang rs dispersed.
Maj. K M. Hough, A. D. C. to Gen. Ilun
ter, in command of four companies of the
first Missouri cavalry, as an escort to a large
train from Sedalia, arrived yesterday. The
command had an engagement with the rebels
at Black Walnut creek, Johnston county,
killed eight cavalry, wounded seventeen and
took five prisoners. Five federals including .
Major Hough, were injured. None severely. /

LOVISVILLK, Dec. 2 —The southern pa
pers to the 2Hth ult. have been roceived. :
They coutaia scattering accounts of the
Fort Pickens Air, frotu which it appear
ed that the bombardment commenced on
Thursday the 21st, and continued with oc- !
casional intermission, night and day till the
evening of the 21th, when (Jul. Drown ;
ceased firing.
The rebels did not respond until after !
Fort Pickens opened fire.
The fire from the fort and the outside I
Santa Rosa island batteries, were directed j
against Fort Barrancas, and the other rebel j
batteries, the rebel steamers Time and Nel- j
mo, and the navy yard, while the federal
vessels engaged Fort Mcßae.
The rebels admit that they lost sixteen
killed and wounded in the bombardment, i
Also, that considerable damage was done to ■
Fort Mcßae, including the caving in of i
the powder magazine. The navy yard and
town of Warringtou were partially destroy
ed.
The rebels appear to have acted strictly
on the defensive.
The stories about the disabling of the
United States steamers Colorado and Nia
gara appear to be unfounded.
The rebel steamers Time and Nelmo j
were somewhat damaged, but succeeded in
getting out of the reach of Col. Brown's i
fire.
Col. Brown received no reinforcements.

Sir —ln obedience to orders, I started from
this camp yesterday, at 9 o'clock in the even,
ing, for the purpose of marching to Draines
▼ill©- We reached positions above and be
hind Drainesville shortly after 5 in the morn
ing, after a tedious and toilsome maroh.—
Maj. Borrows advanced on the town by the
northern pike, which leads to it, with two
companies of the regiment, while I, with tbp
other eight, gained the rear of the town and
advanced by the Leesburg pike. There were
but two picketsmen in the town. These were
; cavalry men belonging to Col. Staart's Yir
ginia Horse, and were captured with their
horses and arms, by Capt. Stadelmann's com
pany B. I arrested six of the citizens of
Drainesville, who are known to be secession j
ists of the bitterest stamp. Their names are
as follows: John T. Day, M. IX, Draines
ville ; R. H. Gannel, Great Falls, Va; Jno. T.
j D. Bell, C. W. Coleman, Drainesville; W. B.
May, M. D., J. B. Fair. Upon my return,
some miles from Drainesville, a fire was
i opened upon the head of the column from a
thick pine wood. Assistant Surgeon Alexan
der was seriously wounded, and private Joel ,
j Houghtaling, I fear, mortally wounded, and
I bad my horse killed. Surgeon Staooton
received a ball in his overcoat, aad his horse
was shot twice. The woods was Instantly
surrounded, and the carbineers dismounted
and sent within them.
We killed two and captured four, one of
whom is shot twice aud not expected to. liva. ■
I I {captured two good horses, five shot guaa
: one Hall's rifle, and two pistols. The nanus

the prisoner had no recollection ; but as lie

much feeling uf the officers of the Provost
Guard, enumerating by name Major Stone,
Captain Wenriek, Lieutenants Agustine and
Voorhes, and Adjutant Patch. The other
prisoners, too, he said, had respected his con

had often heard expressed fervent hopes fi r
his welfare and his escape from the extreme
penalty of the law; hut he had no hopes uf
the latter. The sentence of death had been
or would be pronounced against him, and he
was, through the consolation of religion, re a

forbearance was exhibited towards him that
he was not killed on the spot when he shut
the Major, an-1 for this he was thankful.
He said: On the opening of this war he
had left his home in good health and with a
warm heart, to aid in preserving the G >vern

and re enlisted for the war, and up to the
time of the act f r which he expected to sul

of his country. Ho was crazed, he said,
when he fired the fatal shot.
