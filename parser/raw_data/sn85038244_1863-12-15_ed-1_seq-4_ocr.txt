THE COQUETTE.-'
!
MISS EMMA PASSENGER.
Dear mother, I am weary ; they call me proud
and gay. j
Thev do not know ihe ciddv throng my
heart-ache when away,
from gliding through the festal hall, to
' sounds of mirth and glee,
I have stolen to thee, sweet mother, from the
dance and revelry.
Oh ! loop my heavy tresses back, and lay thy
gentle hand
I'pon my brow, -whose cooling touch seems
like some magicwand ;
It serves to calm my burning thoughts, which
in wild surges roll.
And pierce as with a-rsy of light the tempest
in my soul.
Seel they called me very beautiful, with
pearls twined in my hair, .
A ad gleaming from my neck and arms all
but ho very fair.
There was one smile I prized, mother, yes, I,
t jo vain coquette ;
It were worth a million such as these that I
to-night have met.
I could hardly bear the mingled lock of pity
and of scorn
With which he Bcanned my eager face, and
lightly Bitting form;
I could not bear to see him pass me coldly,
idly by.
To meet no glance of sympathy from his re
splendent eye.
I was sick of fawning flattery, and so I stole
away,
Eut all my thoughtless life comes up, all of
my wasted days ;
I thought of young Ds Nohmav, mother,
Willie, and proud Osdettk,
All of tho hearts I broke when I prized the
name coquette.
"But now I sicken at the word degrading wo
man's nnme, .
And wUS my maiden life a dream, and I a
child again ;
A little laughing lender child, kneeling be
side your knee,
Or playing with the" flowers and birds and
.Willie on the lea. .
Ah ! those were pleasant days, mother, lind
I was happy then,
When human hearts serTed not for toys, and
I shrank from giying pain.
Toor Willie! I've been thinking of his ear
ly love for me,
And how his aching heart found rest beneath
.the surging sea.
And another, still another, comes my strain
ing eyes before,
Troops of avenging spirits slowly beckoning
at the door ; '
And Dk Norman's earnest, wistful glnnce,and
usdette s smile l nee,
For far away in foreign climes they toil for
wealth and me. i
I promised each to be their bride; 'twas but
a wicked jest;
I thought they would forget, and sooth my
fickle heart to rest;
But now I know what true love is. Dear
mother, do not start;
I must tell you all my shameful acts, and
ease my burdened heart.
You know the young Italian, mother, the artist-boy
who enme '
So late from Florence, to our land,towin him
self n name.
How very beautiful he was, and painted oh!
so well !
This morn they found him poisoned, dead. and
I'alone can tell ......
Of the burning thoughts, the hidden fire
with which he vainly strove.
0 God ! he loved me, and I scorned what was
no boyish love. - ' '
Here is a letter, mother; .read, the words fire
all my brain ; '
I am his murderer, and wear upon my heart
this stain.
I was gliding through the giddy dance,' when:
' I heard that he had died,
' And I caught St. Leox's searching glance of
mingled grief and pride.
I thought that I should sink, mother, but all
eyes were on me then, .
For they knew he loved me and I tried to
rally up again.
But I could not ; so I fainted, and fell cold
upon the floor;
It was St. Leon took me up, and bore me to
the door.
So Effie told ne, and she said, when they
called me heartless, vain,
There came across his speaking face such a
. Quivering look of pain ; "
And that he laid me quickly down on the
couch, and, with a sigh,
Passed slowly from the fatal halls, with
moisture in his eve.
I wonder if he pities me, and he love! Gcmo '
so. - .
O mother! you alone of earth your daugh-
tcr s heart may know.'
Take off the glistening satia robe, and the
pearls from out my hair; '
I shall reign no more Tain fashion's queen,
With this bitter load f ears;
And stern rep?ataaee thrilling through my ;j
pulses evermore, - - . -.
I will not be the butterfly that I have been of
.vore.
Oh! no, Gon helping me, I'll try to lead a
better life,
And yoi; will help mc, too, mother, to still
this bitter strife ;
Still help the good to conquer, help pull up
' the many weeds
Within the garden of my soul, and sow the
. ' " precious seed.
And may help the pure dew-drops, which
blessed lny childhoed s years, .
. Will come jinto me onee jain, through all
this waste of tears;
And like a little trusting eMid,I will lear U
watch and pray,
And Gon will take t"hiWd of i fioni off
a v smil a '- ay.
i
I
j
never met!
Yet I tin the punishment U just, my gun of
joy hs tet ; !
Yet I trust a holier one shall rise, a purer
love be given,
Something which doth not come of earth, to
bind our gouU in heaven.
Oh ! my soul is full of music and holy peace i
to-night; j
All is so still,iny little room seems filled v ith
golden light;
Though the birds have hushed their carols, j
and the sun has gone to rest, j
It seems as if their song and light were surg- !
ing through my breast. j
Ho.con it be! life was so dark this night ,
' three years ago, ' ' j
I thought I ne'er could rise again from out the i
- flood of woe; i
But now the summer sun shines through each
window"Pane
A happy wife, I'm taking up life's joyous
song again.
And St. Leox's sitting near me, with a look
of earnest pride,
While a little laughinj treasure lies in the
The nut eyes nd rosy lips, with-eurls of
golden hair, (
And little dimpled clinging hands to us are
. very fair, ,
God grant toglre m wisdom tiV darling
child to guide,
That she, a fair sweet blossom, may. grow up
by my side;
0 mother! thou'rt a holy "name, how few are
jvorth the trust, . .. . -
To train immortal souls within these forms
of mortal dust,
Which to us look so beautiful 1 .they are but
caskets given,
The jewels shrined withiji are ourg to train
for earth and heaven.
1 see those early memories come with sad
dened feelings yet : ...
God grant our darling ne'er may be that cold
vain thing, coquette.
I passed a year, a weary year,still struggling
with my pride,
But at the close came peace and love, and I
became his bride ; (
He had loved me from that sad dark night
when trusting Grmo died
Strange that love's tendrils e'er could stretch
across that bloody .tide. ,
But so it was ; and as he watched my altered
mien and face,
I came to hold within his heart the high
est holiest place; . ;
And De Xormah and Osdette they too haTe
brought home happy wives
In earlier days this would have cost full many
pangs my pride.
Alas I I would have hated them, barriers to
my schemes, and yet
The true wife and the mother has laid off the j
vain coquette.
Proud Isabel, De Xoemax's wife, with glori
ous brown eyes deep,
With a world of love and tenderness which
in their mazes sleep:
Fair Leilias, with her gentle eyescd sweet
ly winning ways,
She will shed sweet peace'o'er OsDETTs'slife,
and crown with joy his days :
I love them both as sisters, and a dark weight
is removed; i
Their hearts have found them fitting mates,
and mine a holy love;
And it seemeth now that Willib smiles to
night, and blesses me,
While Grino looks upon our child so sweetly,
mournfully.
I almost see his dark hair mingle with her
golden curls;
Fie will be her guardian-angel in the holy up
per world ;
There is no envy there,no ! no ! there all will
meet as friends,
And in one joyous company our kindred
souls shall blend.
Hush I hush! wild heart-beats ! gently throb,
I am so happy now,
I almost fear to breathe, lest I should break
your joyous flow ;
Sing, little song-birds, for to-night tny heart
is all in tune,
Sing praises to ihe Fathee for my life's glo
rious noon.
Yet my brow is marked with lines of care,
which years had never made,
And thoughts of early days have cast upon
my brow shade,
Which time can never wear away from out
my heart, and yet
I feel my life is all too blest for the ence vain
coquette.
MISS EMMA PASSENGER. A City in the Rocky Mountains.

j
The resident population of Virginia, Nevada
Territory, on the first of July, was estimated
at fifteen thousand, the daily average number
of transient visitors being about as many
more. Main Btreet, which is 'the Broadway
and Wall street of the city, is some three-
quarters of a mile in length, and is crowded
with every grade and description of persons,
a large proportion of whom are elegantly
dressed.
The tmildings on Main street are mostly
brick, the first story being iron, open in front.
This gives a cheerful appearant to the street,
especially in the night time, when brilliantly
illuminated with gas.
Many of the buildings in the city arc pro.
vided with vaults and salamanders. Some of
the streets are so blocked up with lumber,
brick and mortar, that teams are at times un-
able to get along. Common laborers get from
$i to S5 a day.
The city supports fonr daily newspapers, a
theatre, opera house, several churches, any
number of negro minstrels, and melodists, etc.
No one who has not been there can form any
ifoa 0f the amoumt 0f treasure to be seen in
passing through Main street. At Wells &
Fargo' s banking house and express office, it is
not uncommon to sot tons of " silver brieks ''
wheeled in and out ia the eoursof an hour
These "bricks'' in shape resemble the ordi-
nary nre brick, but are tau-'h larger. These
' are sometimes worth SI, 800 each.
There are but two ways which lead
to great aims and achievements en
ergy and perseverance. Energy is a
rare gift: it provokes opposition,
hatred and reaction. But persever
ance lies within thff reach of. every
one ; its power increases with its prog
ress, and it is but rarely that it misses
its aim.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
Gcntlrvitn of the Senate and llvutc of R-pre- i
$etita(ir'i:
Another year of health and of sufficiently
abundant harvest has passed. For these, and
especially for the improved condition of our
national affairs, our renewed and profound .
gratitude to God is due.
We remain in peace .and friendship with!
foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citi- j
zens of the United States to involve us in ;
foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrec
tion, have been unavailing. Her Britannic
Majesty's Government, as was justly ex pfcted
exercised their authority to prevent the de- I
parture of new hostile expeditions from
British ports. The Emperor of France has, ,
by a like proceeding, promptly indicated the
neutrality which he proclaimed at the begin- 1
ning of the contest. j
Questions of great intricacy and import- i
ance have arisen out of the blockade slid
other belligerent operations, between the
Government and several of the maritime pow- I
ens, but they have been discussed, and, so !
far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit j
of frankness, justice and mutual good will, j
It 's especially gratifying that our Prize j
Courts, by tlie impartiality of their ad.iudica- j
tion, have comnimanded the respect and con- j
fidence of maritime powers. The supplemen- I
tal treaty between the United States andGreat
Britain, for the suppression of the African j
slave trade, made on the lTth day ofFebmary !
last, has been dulv ratified and carried into !
execution. It is believed that so far as the
American ports and American citizens are
concerned, that inhuman and barbarous traf
fic has been broughtjo an end. !
I shall submit, for the consideration of the !
Senate, a convention for the adjustment of t
possessory claims in Washington Territory,
arising out of the treaty of the 15th of June, j
1840, between the United States and Great !
Britain, and which have been the source of
some disquiet among the citizens of that now j
rapidly improving part of. the country. j
A novel and important question, involving :
the -extent of the maritime jurisdiction of j
Spain in ithe waters which surround the Island j
of Cuba, has been debateiLwithout reaching
an agreement,-and it is proposed, in an amic
able spirit, to refer to the arbitrament of a
friend!y-poer.- A convention for that pur
pose will be submitted to the Senate.
I have thought it a proper subject for the
approval of the Senate, to concur with the in
terested commercial power3 in an effect the
convention with Peru,on the arrangement for
the liquidation of the Scheldt dues, npon the
principles which have been heretofore adopt
ed in regard to the imposts upon navigation
ia the waters of Denmark.
The long pending controversy between this
Government and that of Chili, touching the
seizure at Silana, in Peru, by Chilian officers,
of a large amount in treasure belonging to
citizens ofthe United States,has been brought
to a close by the award of. His Majesty the
King of the Belgians, to whose arbitration
the question waB referred by the parties. The
subject was thoroughly and patiently exam
ined by that respected Magistrate, and al
though the sum awarded to the claimants may
not have been as large as they expected.there
is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his
majesty's decision. The decision was prompt
ly complied with by Chili, when intelligence
in regard to it reached that country. The
joint commission, under the act of the last
session for carrying into subject of claims,
has been organized at Lima,and is engaged in
the business intrusted to it.
The difficulties concerning interooeauie
transit through JCicaragua, are in course of
amicable adjustment. In conformity with
the principles set forth in my last annual
messaged have received a representative from
the United States of Columbia and have cred
ited a minister to that Republic.
Incidents occurring in the progress of our
civil war have forced upon my attention the
uncertain state of international questions,
touchiug the rights of foreigners in this coun
try and of citizens abroad. In regard to some
Governments, these rights are at least parti
ally defined by treaties. In no instance,
however, is expressly stipulated that, on the
instance of civil war, a foreigner, residing
in this country, witin the lines of the insur
gents is to be exempted from the rule which
classes him as a belligerent, in whose behalf
the Government of this country can not ex
press any privileges or immunities from that
character. I regret to say, however, that
such claims have been put forward, and in
some instances, in behalf of foreigners who
have lived in the United States the greater
part of their lives. There is reason to be
lieve that many persons.born in foreign coun
tries, who have declared their intention to
beoome citizens,or who have been fully natu
ralized, have evaded the military duty re
quired of them by denying the fact, and there
by throwing upon the Government the burden
of proof. It has been found difficult or
impracticable to obtain this proof, from the
want of guides to the proper sources of in
formation. These might be supplied by
requiring clerks of courts, where declarations
of intention may be made, or naturaliza
tion effected, to send periodically, lists
of the mimes of persons naturalized, or
declaring their intention to become citizens,
to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose
department- these names must be arranged
and printed 'or general information. There
is reason also to believe foreigners frequently
become citizens of the United States for the
sole purposeof evadingthe duties imposed by
the laws of their native country, to which, in
becoming naturalized here,they atoncerepair,
and though never returning to the United
States, they still claim the interposition of
the Government as citizens. Many alterca
tions and great prejudice have heretofore
arisen out of this abuse. It is therefore submit
ted to yonr Berious consideration. It might
be advisable to fix a limit, beyond which no
citizeu of the United States, residing abroad,
may claim the interposition of his Govern
ment. The right of suffrage has often been
assumed and exercised by aliens, under pre
tense of naturalization, which they have dis
avowed whin drafted into the military service.
Isubmitthecxpediency of such an amendment
of the laws as will make the fact of voting an
estopcl against any plea of exemption from
military service, or other civil obligation, on
grounds of alienage.
In common with other western powers, our
relations with Japan have been brought into
serious jeopardy, through the perverse opposi
tion of the hereditary aristocracy of the em
pire to the enlightened and liberal policy of
the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into
j the society ot nations. It is to be hoped, al-
though pot with entire confidence, that these
difficulties may be peacefully overcome. Insk
your attention to the minister residing there
for the damages he sustained in the destruc
i tion, by fire, of the residenoc of the legation at
j Yeddo.
1 Satisfactory arrangements have been made
j with the Emperor of Ktissia, which, it is be
i lieved, will result in effecting a continuous
I line of telegraph through that empire from
: our Pacific coast. ' I recommend to your favor
' able consideration the subject of an intcrna-
tional telegraph between the capital and the
i national forts along the Atlantic seaboard and
; He Gulf of Mcxioo. Such connections, estab
lished with any reasonable outlay, would be
economical as well as effective aids to diplo
matic, military, and naval services.
The Consular system of the United States,
: under the enactments of the last Congress,
begins to he self-sustaining, and there is
! reason to hope that it may become cntire
: ly so with the increase of trade, which will
' ensue whenever pence is restored. Uir Min
isters abroad have been faithful in defending
, American rights, and in protecting our eom-
mercial interests. Our Consuls have neces
1 earily had to encounter increased labors and
responsibilities, growing out of the war.
I These they have, for the most pnrt, met and
I discharged with zeal and efficiency. This
! just acknowledgment includes those Consuls
! who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, China, and
other central countries, arc charged with com
1 plications and extraordinary powers.
The condition of tho several organized Ter
ritories is pencrallv satisfactory, although the
a
is
of
of
of
to
to
Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not I
entirely suppressed. The mineral re- j
sources of Colorado, Nevada, Idahoe, ""ew
Mexico and Arizona are proving far richer ,
than at first understood. I lay bet'oieyou com- j
munications on this subject from the Gover- '
nor of New Mexico. . I again submit to your j
consideration the expediency of establishing ;
sysrein for the encouragement of emigra- .
tion". Although this source of national wealth ;
again flowing with greater freedom than !
for several years before the insurrection oc- j
curred, there is still a great deficiency of la- ;
borers in every field of industry, especially in j
agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron j
and coal as of precious metals. While the j
demand for labor is thus increased here, tens
thousands- of persons, destitute of remun
erative occupation, are thronging our foreign
consulates and offering to emigrate to the Uni
ted States, if essential, but very cheap, as-
sistance can be afforded them. It is easy to j
see that under the sharp discipline of civil
war, the nation is begining a new life, lliis
noble effort demands the aid, and ought to re
ceive the attention and support of the Govern
ment. Injuries unforeseen by the Govern
ment, and unintended, may in some cases,
have been inflicted upon the subjects or citi
zens of foreign countries, both at sea and on
land, by persons in the service of the United
States.
As this Government expects redress from
other powers, when similar injuries are in
flicted, by persons in their service, upon cit
izens of the United States, we must be pre
pared to do" justice to foreigners. If the ex
istingjudicial tribunals areinadequate to this
purpose, a special court will be authorized,
with power to hear and decide such claims
the character referred to as may have aris
en under treaties and public law. Conven
tions for adjusting claims by joint commission
have been proposed to some Governments, but
definite answer to these propositions has
yet been received from any. In the course
the session, I shall probably have occa
sion to request you to provide idemnification
claimants, where decrees of restitution
have been rendered and damages awarded by
the Admirality Court, and in other cases
where this Government may be acknowledged
be liable in principle, and where the
amount of that liability has been ascertained
by an informal arbitration. The proper of
ficers of the Treasury have deemed themselves
required by the laws of the United States
upon the subject, to demand a tax upon the in
comes of foreign Consuls in this .country,
while such a demand may not be an indication
public law, or perhaps of any existing
treaty between the United States and a for
eign country. The expediency of so far mod
ifying tho acts as to exen.pt from tax the in
come of such Consuls as are not citizens of
the United States, derivel from the emolu
ments of their office, or from property not
situated in the United States, is submitted to
your serious consideration. I make the sug
gestion, upon the ground that a comity, which
ought to be reciprocated, exempts our consuls
in all other countries from taxation. To the
extent thus indicated, the United States, I
think, ought not to be illiberal to internation
al trade and commerce.
The operations of the Treasury during the
last vear have been successfully conducted.
The enactment, by Congress, of a National
Banking Law, has picved a valuable support
of the public credit, and the general legisla
tion in relation to loans has Fully answered
the expectations of its favorers. Some amend
ments may be required to perfect existing
laws ; but no change in their principles or
general scope is bclived to be needed. Since
these measures have been in operation, all de
mands on the Treasury, including pay of the
army and navy, have been promptly met and
fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops,
it is believed, were ever more amply provid
ed, and more liberally and punctually paid,
and it may be added that by no people, were
the burdens incident to a great war more
cheerfully borne. The receipts, during the
year, from all sources, including loans, and
the balance in the Treasury at its commence
ment, S'JOl, 125,074. 8lj; the aggregate disburse
ments, S'JjjT'JOjGSO.'iy, leaving a balance on
the 7th of July, 1803j of $-32,90 1.421. Of
the receipts, there were derivedfrom Customs,
Sij'J,0")0,042.4t); from Internal Kevenue, $37,
040,707.00; from direct taxes, 14S,810,3G1 ;
from lands, 107,017.19, from miscellaneous
sources, $3,040,015.35 ; and from loans, $770,
682,301.57, making the aggregate of S001,
125,674.80. Of the disbursements, there
were, for pensions, &c, 8421,052,059; for in
terest on the public debt, $2,472,984,051 ; for
War Department, $599,298,600.83; for Navy
Department, 50,324,105.27; for the payment
of funded and temporary debt, 181,086,035.
07; making an aggregate of $895,790,030.65;
and leaving a balance of $532,904,421. But
the payment of the funded and temporary
debt having been made from moneys borrow
ed during the year, they must be regarded as
nominal payments, and the moneys borrowed
to make them as merely nominal receipts, and
their amount 18,108,GG3,507 should, there
fore, be deducted, both from the receipts and
disbursements. This being done, there re
mains, as actual receipts, 71,470,999,5-58,
leaving the balance as already stated. The
actual receipts and disbursements for the first
quarter, and tie estimated receipts and dis
bursements for the remaining three quarters
of the current fiscal year of 1864, will be
shown in detail by the report of the Secre
tary of the Treasury, to which I invite your
attention.
It is sufficient to say here, that it is not be
lieved that the actual results will exhibit a
state of the finances less formidable to the
country than the estimate of that officer here
tofore submitted, wh;.le it is confidently ex
pected that at the close of the year, both dis
bursements and debts will be found very con
siderably less than has been anticipated.
The report of the Secretary of War is a doc
ument of great interest. It consists of, first,
the military operations of tho year, detailed
in the report of the General ia-chief; second,
the organization of colored persons into the
war service; third, the exchange of prisoners,
as fully set forth in the letter of General Hitch
cock; fourth, operations under the Act for en
rolling and calling out the national forces, de
tailed in the report of the Provost Marshal
General ; fifth, the organization of the Invalid
Corps ; sixth, the operations of the several de
partments of the Quartermaster General, Com
missary General, Paymaster General, Chief
of Engineer, Chief of Ordnance, and Sur
geon General.
The duties devolving on tbe naval branch of
the service during the year, and throughout
the whole of this unhappy contest, have been
discharged with fidelit- and eminent success.
The blockade has been constantly Increasing
in efficiency, as tlie navy lias expanded. 1 et,
on so long a line, it has so far been impossible
to entirely suppress illicit trade. From the
returns received at tlie Navy department, it
appears that more than one thousand vessels
have been captured since the blockade was
instituted, and that tlie value of the prizes
already sent in for adjudication amounts to
over thirteen million dollars.
Tlie naval force of tlie United States con
sists at this timcof 588 vessels completed and
in the oourse of completion, and of these seventy-five
are iron-clad armored steamers.
The events of the war give an increased in
terest and importance to tho navy which
will probably extend beyond ill war luclf.
The armed vessels in our navy completed and
in the service, or which are under contract
and approaching completion, are believed to
exceed in number those of any other power;
but while these may be relied upon for har
bor defense and sea-coast service, others of
greater strength and capacity will be neces
sary for cruising purposes and to niaiutian
our rightful position on the ocean.
The change that has taken place iu naval
vessels and naval warfare since the introduc
tion of steam us a motive power for ships of
war, demands cither corresponding change
in some of our existing navy-yards, or tlie
establishment of now ones for the construc
tion and necessary repairof modern war ves
sels. No inconsiderable embarrassment, de
lay and public injury, have been experienced
from the want of such Government establish
ment. The necessity of such a navy-yard,
so furnished, at some suitable plnee upon the
Atlantic sabord, lias, on repeated occasions,
been brought to the attention of Congress hy

the Navy Department, and is again present
ed in the report of the Secretary. I think it j
my duty to invite your special attention to,
this subject, and also of establishing a yard ;
and depot for naval purposes upon one of the j
Western rivers. A naval fbree has been cre
ated on those interior w aters, and under many
disadvantages within a little more than two t
years, exceeding in number the whole naval ;
force of the country at the commencement of j
the present Administration. Satisfactory and
important as have been the performances of j
the heroic men of the navy, at this period
they are scarcely more wonderful than the
services of .our . mechanics and artisans in
the production of war vessels, which have
created a new form of naval power.
Our country has advantages superior to any
other nation in our resources of iron and
timber, with inexhaustible quantities of fuel '
in the immediate vicinity of both, and all !
accessible and in close proximity to naviga- I
ble waters. Without the disadvantage of j
public risks, the resources of the nation have j
been developed and its power displayed in
the construction of a navy of such magnitude
which'has at the very period of its creation,
rendered signal service to the JUnion. The
increase of the number of seamen in the pub
lic service, from 7,000 men, in the spring of
1801, to about 24,000 t the present time, has
been accomplished without especial legisla
tion or extraordinary bounties to promote
that increase. It has been found, however,
that the operations of the draft, with high
bounties paid for army recruits, is beginning
to affect injuriously the naval service, and
will, if not corrected, be likely to impair
its efficiency, bjvletaching seamen from their
proper vocation, "and inducing them to enter
the army. 1 therefore respectfully suggest,
that Congress aid both the army and naval
service by adequate provision on this sub
ject, which would at the same time be equit-.
able to the communities more especially in
tended. I commend to your consideration the
suggestions of the Secretary of the Navy in
regard to the policy of fostering and training
seamen for naval service. The Naval Acad
emy is rendering signal service in preparing
midshipmen for highly responsible duties,
which, in after life, they will be required to
perform, in order that the country should not
be deprived of the proper quota of educated
officers, for which legal provision has been
made at the naval school. The vacancies
caused by the neglect or omission to make
nominations from the States in insurrection,
have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy.
The school is cow more full and complete
than at any previous period, and in every
respect is entitled to the favorable considera
tion of Congress.
During the past fiscal year the financial
condition of the Post Office Department has
been one of increased prosperity, and I am
gratified in being able to state that the amount
of postal revenue has nearly equalled the en
tire expenditure the latter amounting to
eleveu millions, three hundred and fourteen
thousand dollars, and fourteen cents, and the
former to eleven millions, one hundred and
sixty-three thousand, seven hundred and
eight-nine dollars and fifty-nine cents, leaving
a deficiency of but $150,417 25. In 1800, the
year immediately preceding the rebellion, the
deficiency amounted to $5,650,700 49; the
postal receipts of that year were $2,045,722
19 less than those of 1803. The decrease
since 1860 in the annual amount of trans
portation has been only about twenty-five per
cent., but the annual expenditures on account
of same, has been reduced thirty-five per cent.
It j. manifest, therefore, that the Post Office
Department will become sustaining in a few
years, even with the restoration of the whole
service. The International Conference of the
postal delegates from the principal countries
of Europe and America, which was called at
the suggestion of the Postmaster-General,
met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and
concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June.
The principles established by the conference,
as best adapted to facilitate postal inter-,
course between nations, and as the basis of
future conventions to inaugurate a general
system of uniform international charges nt
reduced rates of postage, can not fail to pro
duce beneficial results.
I refer you to the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, which is herewith laid before
you, for the useful and varied information in
relation to public lands, Indian affairs, pat
ents, pensions and other matters of public con
cern pertaining ti his department. The
quantity of lands disposed of during the last
and the first quarter'of the present fiscal
year, was three million, eight hundred and
forty-one thousand, five hundred and forty
nine acres ; of which one hundred and sixty
one thousand, nine hundred and eleven acres
were sold for cash; one million, four hundred
and fifty six thousand five hundred and four
teen acres were taken up under the homestead
law, and the residue disposed of under laws
granting lands for military bounties, for rail
roads and other purposes. It also appears
that the sale of the public lands is largely on
the increase. It has long been' a cherished
opinion of .some of our wisest statesmen
that the people of the United States had a
higher and more enduring interest in the
early settlement and substantial cultivation
of the public lands, than in tbe amount of
direct revenue to be derived from the sale of
them. This opinion has had a controlling in
fluence in shaping legislation upon the sub
ject of our national domain. I may cite, as
an instance of this, the liberal measures
adopted in reference to active settlers, and the
grant to the States of the overflowed lands
within their limits, in order to their being
reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation.
The grant to railroad eompanies of alternate
sections of land upon the contemplated linos
of their roads when completed, will largely
multiply the facilities of reaching our dis
tant possessions. This policy has received
its most signal and benificent illustration in
recent enactments, granting homesteads to
actual Eettlcrs. Since the 1st day of January
last, the before-mentioned quantity of $1,450,
614 acres of land has been taken up under
its provisions. This fact, and the amount of
sales furnish gratifying evidence of-the in
creasing settlement upon the public lands.
Notwithstanding the great struggle in
which the energies of the Nation have been
engaged, and which has required so large a
withdrawal of our citizens, I cordially concur
in tlie recommendation of the Secretary of the
Interior suggesting a modification of the act
in favor of those engaged in the military
and naval service of the United States. I
doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt
such measures as will, without essentially
changing the general features of the system,
reserve, to the greatest practical extent, its
benefits to those who have left their homes in
defense of the country in this arduous crisis.
1 invite your attention to the views of the
Secretary of War as to the propriety of rais
ing, by appropriate legislation, a revenue
from the mineral lands of the United States.
The measures provided at your last session
for the removal of certain Indian tribes, have
been carried into effect. Sundry treaties
have been negotiated, which will, in due time,
be submitted for the constitutional action of
the Senate. They contain stipulations for
extinguishing the pospcWe rights of the In
dians to large. and valuable tracts of land.
It is probable that the effects of those treaties
will result in the establishment of permanent
friendlv relations with such of those trihes
as have been brought into frequent and
bloody collisions with our outlying settle
j ments and emigrants.
I suggested, in my last annual mcssnge, the
propriety of remedying our Indian system.
Subsequent events have satisfied me of its ne
j ccssity. The details set forth in tho report
of the Secretary will evince the urgent need
for immediate legislative action,
I commend the benevolent institutions es
I tablished or patronised by tho Government,
in this District, to yonr generous and foster
! ing care.
The attention of Congress, during tho last
session, was engaged, to some extent, with a
proposition for enlarging the water eominuni
. cation between the Mississippi Itiver and the
north-eastern sea-board, which proposition,
however, failed for the time. Since then, upon
a call of the greatest respectability, a Conven
; tinn bus been held nt Chicago upon the same
subject, a summary of whose iews is con

THE REBELLION.
When Congress assembled a year ago, the ;
war had already lasted nearly twenty months, j
and there had been many conflicts, both on
land and sea, with varying results. The re- I
bellion had been pressed back into reduced !
limits; yet the tone of public feeling and I
opinion, at nome anu aoroau, was not satis
factory. With ether signs, the popular elections
then just past, indicated uneasiness among
ourselves, while amid mucu that was coid and j
menacing, the kindest words coming from
England were uttered in accents of pity, that
we were too blind to surrender. Our com
merce was suffering greatly by a few armed
vessels, built upon and furnished from for
eign shores, and we were threatened such
additions from the same quarter as would
sweep our trade from ie sea, and raise our
blockade. We had failed to elicit from Eu
ropean Governments anything hopeful upon
the subject. The Emancipation Proclamation
which was issued in September was running
its assigned period to the beginning of the
new year. A month later, the final procla
mation came, including the announcement
that colored men of suitable condition would
be received into the war service. The policy
of emancipation and of the employment of
black soldiers gave to the future a new as
pect, abont which hopes, fears, and doubts
contended in uncertain conflict, according to
our political system, as a matter of civil ad
ministration. The general Government had
no lawful power to effect emancipation in
any State, and for a long time it had been j
that the rebellion could be suppressed j
without resorting to it as a mititarv measure.
It was all the while deemed possible that
necessity for it might come, and that if it
should, the crisis of the contest would then
be presented. It came, and as intended, it
was followed by doubtful days. Eleven months
having been passed we are permitted to take
another review. The rebel borders were
pressed still further back, and by the com
plete opening of the Mississippi River, the
country dominated over by the rebellion is
divided into distant parts. Practical com
munication between them and Tennessee and
Arkansas has been so substantially cleared
of the insurgent's control and influence;
and the citizens in each, and owners of
slaves, and advocates of slavery at the begin
ning of the rebellion, now declare openly for
emancipation in their respective States. Of
thoso States not included in the Emancipation
Proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither
of which, years ago, would tolerate any re
straint upon the extension of slavery into
their territories, only dispute now as to the
best mode of removing it from within their
own limits. Of those who were slaves at the
beginning of the rebellion, fully one hundred
thousand are now in the United States mili
tary service, about one-half of which number
actually bear arms in the ranks, thus giving
the double advantage of taking much labor
from the insurgent cause, and supplying the
places which otherwiso must be filled with so
many white men. So far as tested, it is diffi
cult to say they arc not as good soldiers as
any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to
violence or cruelty has marked the measures
of emancipation and arming the blacks. These
have been much discussed in foreign countries,
and, cotemporary with such discussions, the
tore of public sentiment, there is much im
proved. The same measures have been fully
discussed, supported, criticised and denounced,
and the result of the annual elections is high
ly encouraging to those whose special duty it
is tobear the country through this great trial ;
thus we have the reckoning. Thecrisis which
threatened to divide the Union is past.
Looking now to the present and future, and
with reference to the resumption of the na
tional authority within the States wherein
that authority has been suspended, I have
thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of
which is herewith transmitted. On examin
ation of this proclamation, it will appear, as
is believed, amply justified by the Constitu
tion. True, the form of an oath is given, but
no man is coerced to take it. A roan is only
promised a pardon in case he voluntarily
takes the oath. The Constitution authorizes
the Executive ti grant it on such terms as are
fully established by judicial and other au
thorities. It is also proffered that if, in many of the
States named, a seat of Government shall be,
in the mode prescribed, set up, such Govern
ment shall be recognized and guaranteed by
the United States, and that under it the State
shall, on subscribing to the constitutional
conditions, be protected against invasion and
domestic violence. The constitutional obli
gation of the United States to guarantee to
every State in the Union a republican form
of government, and to protect the State in
the case as stated, is explicit and full ; but
why tender the benefits of this provision
only to a State Government setup in this par
ticular way? .This section of the Constitu
tion contemplates a case wherein the element
within a State, favorable to Republican Gov
ernment in the Union, may be too feeble for
an opposite and hostile element external to
and even within tho State, and such are pre
cisely the cases with which we are now deal
ing. An attempt to guarantee and protect a
revised State Government, constructed in
whole or in preponderating part from the
very element against whose hostility and vio
lence it is to be protected, is simply absurd.
There must be a test by which to separate op
posing elements, so ns to build only from the
sound, and that test is a sulficiont and liberal
one, which accepts as sound whoever will
make a sworn recantation of his former un
soundness. But if it be proper to require a test of ad-
mission to the political bodv, an oath of alle
giance to the Constitution of the United States
and to the Union under it, why not also to
the laws and proclamation in regard to slav
ery ? Those laws and proclamations were en-
acted and put forth for the purpose of aiding
. .n the suppression of the rebe lion. To give
them the fullest effect there had to be a pledg
for their Tnaintainance. In my judgment
they had aided, and will further aid, the cause
for which they were enlisted. To give up
this principle would be not only to relinquish
a lever of power, but would also be a cruel
and astounding breach of faith. I mav add,
at this point, that while I remain in mv pres-
est position; I Shall not attempt to retract or
i -V , t.
inouity the tmnncipation rrockimation. nor
, L ?
shall I return to slavery any person who is
ma.le free by the terms of the proclamation,
or by nny act of Congress. For these, and
other reasons, it is thought best that tlie sup-
port of these persons shall be included in the
oath, ai d it is believed the Kyecutivc may
law fully ohtim it in return for pardon, and
tho restoration of protected riprhts which He
has a clear constitutional power to withhold
altoirxther or grant upon the term which be
Hhall deem widest for the publiu interest. It
should be observed, also, that this part of the
oath is subject to the modifying and nbrnjra
i tin power of legislation ami supreme jitdi
! cial decision. The proposed acquiescence of
the National Executive in any honorable
temporary state arrangement for the freed
people, is made with a view of possibly niodi
1 fyinjy the confusion nnd distressing destitu-
tion which must, at least attend all ela,.-,,
hj a total revolution of labor throughout the
wkolc States. It, in hoped that tho already
deudy atllicied people in those States may be 1
son 'what more ready to pive up the cause of 1
then affliction, and to this extent this vital ;
matter is life to theniaclveii. while io power .
of the National Kxecutive to prevent an abuse
is abridged hy 'his proposition. 1
The HRestion ia the proclamation as to
maintaining the political framework of the
of the States the elements for resumption
have been ready for action, but remain inac
vorablc live apparently for want of a rallying poiut,
or a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the
platl of B, rather than B that of A? If A
and"B should agree, how can they know but
that the General Government here will respect
their plan? Bj"the proclamation, a plan is
presented which mav be accepted by them a3
and it may be esteemed fortunate that, in giv
hoped ing the greatest efficiency to their indispen-
States on what is called reconstruction, is
mode in the hope that it may do good without
harm. It will favor labor, and avoid great
confusion. But why any proclamation upon
the subject? This question is beset with the
conflicting views that the step might be de-
laved too long or be taken too soon. In sonic
a rallying point, and which will not be re
jected here. This tnav brinz them to act soon-
er than they otherwise would. The objection
to a premature presentation of a plan by the
National Executive, consists in the dangerof
committants in points-whioh could be more
safely left to further-developments. Care
has been taken to so shape the document as
to avoid embarrassment from this source.
In saying that, on certain terms, certain
classes will be pardoned, with their rights
restored, it is not said that other classes, on
other terms, will nevr be included. In say
ne that a reconstruction will he accepted, if
presented in a specified w-ay, it is not Siiil
that it will be accepted in other ways. The
movements by State action for emancipation,
not included in the Emancipation Proclama
tion, are matters of profound gratulation:
and, while I do no.t repeat w hat I have here
tofore so earnestly-urged npon this subject,
my general views and feelings remain un
changed, and I trust that Congress will omit
no fair opportunity of aiding these important
Stales to the great consummation.
In the midst of other cares, however import
ant, we must not lose sight of the fact, that
the war power is still our main reliance. To
that power alone can we look yet, for a time,
to give confidence to the people in contested
regions, that the insurgent power will not
again overrun them. Until that confidence
shall be established, little can be done any
where, for what is called reconstruction.
Hence, our chiefest care must still be direct
ed to our army and navy, who have thug far
borne their harder part so nobly and well ;
sable arms, we do also honorably encourage
gallant men, from commander to aentinel,
who compose them, and to whom, mora than
all others, the world must Btand indebted, for
the home of freedom, disenthralled, regener
ated, enlarged, and perpetuated.
