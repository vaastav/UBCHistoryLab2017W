RURAL. FREE DELIVERY.
Rural free delivery has come to
stay. The report of the postmaster
general to congress made public today
and which, so far as it relates to rural
'free delivery, is published elsewhere
.in this issue with but slight abridge
ment, brings out some very important
(acts upon this subject. The expert
mental rural free "delivery service
inaugurated up to this time "has dem
onstrated some remarkable results.
The conclusion reached by the post
master general that rural free deliv
ery can be' extended to every portion
of the country adapted to the same at
-a net increase in expenditures of $12,
000,000 per year will be of great sur
.prise and is a matter of.much con
gratulation. It means that rural free
delivery will not only be retained
'where it has heretofore been experi
mentally tried, but that it will also
,• soon be extended to every home
in the land where the population is
sufficiently dense to warrant the ser-
Tice.
Another fact pointed out by the
postmaster general, is of much sig
niflcance.. It is, that if certain abuses
which have grown up with reference
•to second-cass mail matter -be abol
ished, this reform alone will effect a
sufficient saving in expenditures and
Increase in revenues to cover the total
net additional cost. to ^xtend rural
free delivery thruout the entire Unit
ed States. That this matter has been
worked out to -such a successful con
clusion reflects great credit upon
Postmaster General Smith and ex
First Assistant Postmaster General
I Perry S. Heath, who was an ardent
advocate of rural free delivery and
who claimed from the first that it was
a practical measure and would prove
^entirely feasible without imposing an
undue burden of taxation in order
to bring it about. The republican
party in its national platform and
President McKinley in his message to
congress have indorsed und commend
•. ed this great advance in the postal
service Of the nation. The report of
Postmaster General Smith upon this
subject will be read with the greatest
interest by residents of the rural dis
tricts in this part of the state.
In connection with the above it is
Interesting to note that-Major John B.
Jeffrey, special agent of the postoffice
/. department, has completed' the in
spection of five proposed new rural
free delivery routes in Wapello coun
ty, and will recommend the estab
lishment of the same at once. Two of
these routes extend from Ottumwa,
two from Agency, one from Eldon and
one from Hedrick. The latter occu
pies the extreme northeastern corner
of the county. There are already in
operation in this county three routes
—one from Ottumwa, one from Ba
tavia and one from Hedrick. Peti
tions are now in circulation, asking
for the establishment of a new route
starting from Blakesburg, and occupy
ing the extreme southwestern corner
of the county. Also a petition asking
for a route starting from Ottumwa and
running out thru the Bear Creek dis
trict in the direction of Munterville.
Four routes were recently established
in Davis county, and several in each
of Keokuk, Mahaska and Monroe coun
ties.

Sir
A GOOD R0AD3 PROPOSITION.
Free rural delivery of mail is a good
roads proposition of the most far
reaching importance. The honorable
postmaster general in his annual re
port to congress says:
"Good roads become indespensable
and their improvement is the essen
tial condition of the service."
After the people in the rural dis
tricts ftave once enjoyed tne great ad
vantage of rural free delivery of mail
they will not give up tlie service. The
postoffice department must, from the
very nature of the case, insist that
the roads traversed by rural delivery
routes be put in first class condition,
and he so kept at all seasons of the
year. Here then will be the lever to
force the communities to make the
necessary expenditures and do the re
quired work to make and keep up good
roads all tl)e year around.
Major John B. Jeffery, who will rec
ommend the establishment of seven
additional rural mail routes in Wapel
lo county, in addition to the three that
are now in operation in the count),
has conditioned this recowmendation
upon the roads traversed by the
rdiltae being put in good repair and so
kept at aU seasons of the year. We
want to say t-bat Major Jeffery has,
in ow opinion, the right conception in
rogtmi to fcUe »ee delivery eer
yiooi thal the people Who,
SSilF^-'
Su
'-i.'Trwv:
Semi-Weekly Courier
want it should have free delivery ot
mail, provided they are willing to com
ply with certain necessary conditions
in order to make the system complete
and put it In first class shape from the
starkly Every route laid- out by Major
Jeftery 'hi this county,' and so far .as
we know, wherever he goes, starts out
with at least one hundred families
served, who are provided with uni
form locked mail boxes erected on
posts of a specified size, all of which
are neatly painted and numbered.
Major Jeftery also enlists and se
cures the hearty cooperation of the
boards of supervisors of the various
counties, thus bringing important In
fluences to bear in the line of secur
ing good roads and strictly first class
service.
.As an instance of this good work on'
the part of this special agent of the
postoffice department/ we note the fol
lowing resolutions yesterday adopted
by the board of supervisors of Wa
pello county which mean a great deal
for the future of good roads in this
county.
Resolutions Adopted by the Board of
Supervisors of Wapello County.
Whereas, the postoffice department
has extended to the residents of Wa»
pello county the rural free delivery
system, Special Agent John B. Jeftery
having recommended the establish
ment of seven routes in addition to
the three already established, this
recommendation being conditioned
upon the roads traversed by the routes
being put in good repair, and being so
kept at all seasons of the year, and
Whereas, we recognize the force
and importance of the declaration by
the Honora'Je Postmaster General, in
his annual report to congress, that
"good roads are an essential condition
of the service."
Resolved, by the board of supervis
ors of Wapello county, Iowa, that the
county bridges and the approaches
thereto, and all road work under the
control of the board of supervisors,
will be put in first class condition and
will be so maintained, and that this
board will exercise its influence with
the road district supervisors to see
that all roads are properly worked
and kept in good traveling condition
at all seasons of the year.
Ottumwa, Iowa, Dec. 10, 1900.
Mrs. Sarah Kuhn, of the village of
Delta, is on trial charged -with the
murder of her husband in September.
It is alleged that there is a man in
tVu1 case, which alleged fact the state
will attempt to prove. In a murder
case a motive is always sought, and
many tirpes the conclusions arrived at
are ir.cofrect. At best a motive for a
crime, unless confessed by a culprit,
is but the outcome of a course of rea
soning in one man's brain, and may be
far from the truth. No man is infalli
ble and a state's attorney is just as
liable to reach an incorrect conclusion
as any citizen, even tho he has had
experience in "criminology."
America is helping China out of its
trouble in this crisis, and is incidental
ly rescuing all of China's enemies
from an embarrassing and dangerous
position. The Washington govern
ment has won. laurels in.this Chinese
matter, which the country will be bet
ter able to appreciate"-after the epi
sedf, ends than it can now. In foreign
as well as in domestic politics the ad
ministration has won credit for the
country
Somebody has said that this is a
great year for the farmer. In fact it
has been said a great many times but
the estimate of Director Sage, of the
Iowa Weather, and Crop Service, that
the tctal value of all crops produced
in Iowa the past seaBori amounts to
$102 for every inhabitant in the state
would indicate that the statement is
not lacking in proof.

PEOPLE'S PULPIT.
mmmi
Industrial Conflict.
We are now living in an era of la
bor. Civilization is rolling up its
sleeves and idleness as an art has
come down to the dude and the pro
fessional tramp. The old shame of
servitude has gone man advances and
takes his shovel with him, education
and liberty vitalize the work and the
worker, a living unit in dignity or in
dirt.
It was always so in prln
ciple since Adam carried a
spade, but in practice and potency
never so dominant as it is today, and
the more so as educated labor becomes
a fact, as we see the fruit of the tree
of knowledge spread upon the poor
man's plate and the intellectual at
tainments once like coronets and col
ogne, possessed by few, are to be
found With the user of the pick and of
the hod.
Every age has had its widening hor
izon and increasing light, star fire has
run into sun, and what was the aspira
tion of a baron is now the birthright
of a bootblack. In these changed con
ditions the vassal becomes a man and
the trampled serf a thinker. The
force that once utilized ignorance and
political impotency for private gresd
or public crime has spent its strength
and seen its day, as the time is past
for all such work as that. Intelligence
and the ballot box leave only the beg
gar and the outlaw to the crumbs of
Lazarus and the dogs of Dives. The
heel of the freeman is on the head of
the dragon.
But for all this fact of labor eman
cipation, what it teaches and what it
predicts, we see agiation and discon
tent. Agitation is a condition of pro
gress when its inspiration is of truth
and justice. They, however, are us
ually local, and, with exceptions, are
only sperm on the tidal wave, so long
as education, Christianity and Saxon
sense predominate. Agitation can
never lapse "into anarchy in this re
public when the school and the ballot
are free and the hot blooded races are
subordinate. The old methods of fire
and brimstone are obsolete, the Anglo
Saxon, in the cause of labor has been,
and is yet, cold and practical, but
none the less progressive and surf.
It is ever true, whether we like it or
not, that the race element in all its
reforms fixed its status and its meth
ods. Some of the purest and noblest
types ef reformers have been evoked
from the labor classes of Great Bri
tain and America, grand old forms of
intellect and courage, calm, patient
and gifted men, such as Cabden, Jones
and Cooper, who, in sacrifice and de
votion, serve the cause of the poor.

Allyn Bros., bankers of this city,
were taken by surprise on day last

bank and said he wished to "square

About twenty years ago when the firm
name was Morris & Allyn, he had on
deposit $100. A deposit check was
made of it, and at one time he drew
from the check $12.50. Some time af
ter that he called to get the remain
ing sum, and by mistake the $12.50
was not counted out, and the full value
of the check, $100, was paid. He has
had the use of the $12.50 for twenty
years, and came in last week, ack
nowledged the corn, and paid coin
pound interest on the same since that
time, which amounted to about $80.

he was uninjured. The aged gentle
man was bringing a load of hay to
the city, when the king bolt broke,
allowing the tongue to fall to the
ground and the wagon to switch to
the side of the road where it upset,
hurling Mr. Walters to the ground.
Three or four of his ribs on the right
side were snapped entirely off ana one
on his left side was broken in such a
manner as to pierce the lung. Walk
ing to his home, which was about a
nUile distant, he urged that he was un
hurt. However medical attendance
was summoned by the family and his
critical condition was discovered. An
operation was performed on the in

serious and his condition is considered
as critical.

WHEELER DEMURRED.
Grinnel Man Found to Be Insane—No
Asylum for Him.
Grlnnell, Dec. 12.—(Special)—W. H.
Wheeler of this city was taken by
Sheriff Binegar to Montezuma, where
he was taken before the commission
of insanity for examination. After
examination that body had two sug
gestions to consider: Was the man
insane, and if so was it advisable to
send him to an asylum for treatment?
Qn the first question the board
found that he was insane, but held
tfyat his insanity was not of a nature
requiring him to be sent to an asylum
against his protest.
Mr. Wheeler has long been consid
ered "Queer he was born in Turkey,
of missionary parents and lived there
long enough to learn the language.
For some years he has been printing
and circulating leaflets on moral and
religious subjects, and inserted locals
in tlje town papers, advertising peo
ple, especially those in trouble, to vis
it him and learn how "to think."
These things were regarded as harm
less eccentricities, or the work of a
religious crank. For a year or more
he has been away from home, in the
east and but a few days ago returned
from a tour of Iowa which he had
been traveling over in the interest of
his peculiar ideas. His father-in-law,
it is said, instituted the proceedings,
as he is said to have been caring for
his daughter, Wheeler's wife, and her
children.
Wheeler created some gossip
year ago by refusing to engage the
services of a physician when his little
child was very ill.
