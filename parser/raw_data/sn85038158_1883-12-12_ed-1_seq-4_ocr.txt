BUSINESS CHANCE.
The readers of the News will
doubt be gratified to learn that we
have sold a half interest in the office
to Col. Geo. W. Barrere and his
son Bebee, who will be associated in
the management of the paper from
and after January ist, 1884. The
particulars of the new arrangement
are more fully given in the supple
ment accompanying this week's
News. Col. Geo. W. Barrere is well
known to ail our citizens as a correct
and reliable business man, and there
is good reason to believe that his
connection with the paper will be
advantageous to its interests in every
respect. His son, Mr. Bebee Bar
rere, who will have entire charge of
the mechanical department, is an ex
cellent job printer and a young
of sterling integrity and industrious
habits, who will spare 110 efforts to
give satisfaction to our patrons in the
department under his charge.
The office will be removed about
the first of January to the Iloggard
building, a few doors west of our
present location, where we shall be
happy to see our old friends and the
public generally.
Bro. Frazer of the New Richmond
(O) Independent, has purchased an
interest in the Daily State Journal at
Jefferson City, Mo., and offers the
Independent for sale on very fa
vorable terras. Bro. Frazer is a
good editor and a genial gentleman,
and will be missed by the editorial
brotherhood of Ohio. lie has our
best wishes for his success in his new
location.
We have received from Mr. W. R.
Lazenby, Director of The Agricul
tural Experiment Station at the Ohio
State University, copies of printed
circulars which he is sending to
farmers throughout the State. Cir
cular No. 1 relates to injurious in
sects affecting the crops, and circular
No. 2 relates to troublesome weeds.
Farmers desiring to answer these
circulars can obtain copies by ad
dressing Mr. W. R. Lazenby at Co
lumbus. The answers when received I
will be carefully compared and
classified, and the results published
by the Hoard of Agriculture far th
Lenefit of farmers.
Sample Copies
We send this week's News to A
large number of Republicans in the
county who are not subscribers, but
who we think ought to be. We ask
them to examine the paper carefully
and compare it with other county
papers, and we think its superiority
will be apparent to all unprejudiced
readers. Now is the time to sub
scribe for the coining year or for a
for
shorter period if you wish to try the
paper. Call at the office and sub
scribe, or if more convenient hand
your name and money to your Post
master.
The Emperor of Chin seems de
termined to repel the advance of the
French in Tonnuin, and unless
France recedes from her position, war
is inevitable. Large bodies of Chi
nese troops are being sent to Ton
quin. Bro. Alderman of the Marietta
Register has started a semi-weekly.
It is a handsome and newsy eight
column folio, and will nodoubt prove
a success as Marietta is now large
enough to need something more than
a weekly paper.
The pressure for
subordinate of-
fices in the gift of the House ofRep
resentalives at Washington, is said
to be tremendous, there beingone to
six applicants for every office to be
filled. The Democratic majority
are at their wits' end how to satisfy
the clamor of this hungry horde of
office seekers.
The Annual Newspaper Directory
for 18S3 published by N. W. Ayer &
Son, the well known advertising
agents of Philadelphia, has been on
our table for some time. It is a
valuable work of reference for ad
vertisers and newspaper men, and
does credit to the enterprising firm
by which it is published. We have
done busines with this firm for sev
eral years past, and can recommend
them as prompt and honorable.
Miss Delia Amos, daughter of Gen.
Amos, of the Sidney Democrat, is
an applicant for the position of En
grossing Ulerk ot the Uhio benate,
which was so ably filled in the last
Senate by the lamented Miss Lillie
Darst, of the Circleville Herald.
Miss Delia is a bright and preposs
essing young lady, and has been as
sociate editor ot her lather s paper
for some time past. We hope she
may obtain the position she desires.
lne loieao Daily fost is a new
aspirant for public favor, of which
several numbers nave reached our
table. It is a bright spicy little
sheet and is furnished at the low rate
of one cent per copy, or three dol
lars a year. The publishers are
Meisrs. Chapin, Brinkerhoff & Co.
We have a pleasant acquaintance
with Mr. Chapin, who was formerly
connected with the Toledo Bee and
wish him success in his new enter
prise. The officers of the Republican
National Committee have been visit
ing Cincinnati and other cities with
a view to selecting the place for hold
ing the National Convention of next
year. Cincinnati is the most central
point, and her Music Hall is the best
adapted for the purpose of any in the
country. This with her superior
hotel accommodations and other at
tractions ought to give her the pre
ference, though Philadelphia is mak
ing a strong effort to secure it.
Change in the Hillsboro Gazette.
Mr. J. R. Marshall last week sold
his interest in the Gazette to Probate
Judge R. M. Dittey. Mr. Marshall
has been unusually successful in the
business management of the Gazette,
and has made it a better paying con
cern than any of his predecessors.
He is a first-class job printer and
it is understood has purchased an
interest in the Springfield Sunday
News, where he will have a wide
field for the exercise of his speciality.
Socially he is a clever, genial gentle
man, and the removal of himself and
family will be sincerely regretted by
their many friends. We wish them
abundant prosperity in their new
home.
The News cordially welcomes
Judge Dittey to the ranks of the edi
torial fraternity, and hopes he may
find his new duties both pleasant and
profitable.
The Keys murder case was set for
trial Monday and when it was called
in Court it was passed until Friday.
Owing to the sickness of Mrs. Taylor,
mother of the murdered men, who is
an important witness for the State,
the case will be continued until the
next term of Court and Keys will ap
pear in Court today and renew his
bond. Chillicolhe Advertiser.

A Merited Compliment to Judge
Foraker.
The Ashtabula Sentinel of last week
proposes that the Republican mem
bers of the Legislature should pay
Judge Foraker the merited compli
ment of giving him their united vote
U. S. Senator, at the coming
session. We heartily endorse the
proposition and agree with the Senti
nel that it will meet the unanimous
approval of the Republicans of the
State. The Sentinel says:
is
Its
till
FOR UNITED STATES SENATORâ€”
JOSEPH B. FORAKER.
We think as a tribute to worth and
a slight acknowledgement for ser
vices rendered, tht Republican
members of the Ohio General Assem
bly should present and vote for
Judge Foraker for United States Sen
ator. It will be a complimentary
vote only, although we wish it were
large enough to elect him. When
the Republican party last spring
were casting aoout lor a canaiaaie
for Governor, men who were compe
tent for the place, for various reasons
were extremely scarce. But at the
call of the people and his party
Judge, Foraker took the nomination
ana lea, wnat many Deueveu to ue a
forlorn hope, and fought one of the
most trvine campaigns a man was
ever called to fight in this state.
Although begirt with opposition from
all sides, he made a gallant fight and
by self sacrifice and great physical
endurance he stood bravely to his
work, and was beaten by so small
a majority that even in defeat it was
a triumph. No man in the State
deserves the compliment on his mer
its more than Judge Foraker and we
trust the vote of the entire delegation
will be given him as freely and una
nimously as it was given our lamen
ted Garfield. We know the vote
could be given to no man which
would more fully express the senti
ment of our people.
The President's Message.
The News laid this document be
fore its readers last week in a sup
plement, in advance of all its cotem
poraries. The Message is a concise,
clear fnd able statement of the af
fairs oi the government for the past
year, and has the unusual and com
mendable merit in such documents of
being brief and pointed, which will
insure it a far more general perusal
than if it had been of the ordinary
length. Tresident Arthur evidently
understands the force of the old say
ing that "brevitiy is the soul of wit."
The resident's recommendation
in regard to the Mormon question,
will meet with general approval, and
it is to be hoped Congress will carry
it out. by prompt and effective legis
lation. His suggestion that the trade
dollar be called in and recoined at
the mints, is also a wise and prac
tical one, and his views in regard to
the public debt are of the same
character. He also makes a timely
recommendation favoring the im
provemcnt of the Navy,which merits
the sanction of Congress. W refrain
however, from further comment,as no
doubt most of our readers have read
the Message for themselves.
Prof. Tice, the weather prophet is
dead. He was 73 years old.
The Annual Convention of the
Ohio Bee Keepers, will be held at
Columbus, January 14, 15 and 16.
Washington C H., is considerably
excited over several fraudulent life
insurance cases recently discovered
in which the lives of prominent citi
zens were insured without their
knowledge, by the Eureka Life As
sociation of Indianipolis, a company
which was driven from Ohio last
year by State Commissioner Moore
on account of crookedness in its
transactions. Several arrests have
been made and the whole matter
will be legally investigated.
The Ohio Editorial Association
held its annual meeting at Columbus
last week, and re-elected I. F. Mack,
of the Sandusky Register as Presi
dent, and all the other old officers
who have so ably served the Asso
ciation for several years past. Mack
did not want to serve again, but the
honor was thrust upon him and he
was forced to submit, as the Associ
ation appreciated his superior fitness
for the place too highly to part with
him. there will be no excursion
this year.
The Story of Puff. By Mrs. C. M
Livingston, (Pansy's sister) is one of
the most fascinating stories of its
kind ever written. It presents the
autobiography of a canary, its haps,
mishaps, reflections, etc., in the
choicest and simplest laungage, with
a rare blending of pathos and humor.
The dc-lighful little sketch is, indeed,
worthy of comparison with the
famous story of "Rab and his
Friends," and will afford genuine
pleasure to readers old and young.
