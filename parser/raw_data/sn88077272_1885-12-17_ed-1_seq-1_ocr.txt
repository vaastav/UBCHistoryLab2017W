SHOT IN COURT.
Edmund O'Neal, in a Desperate Effert to
Escape Mortally Wounded by
Marshal Day.
ClNcnrsATi, December 10. At three
o'clock this afternoon in the Marshal's of
fice, just across the hall from the United
States Court-room, in the Government
building, Covington, Ky., and while Judge
Barr was on the bench sentencing prison
ers, Wm. Day, Court bailiff, shot and mor
tally wounded Ed. O'Neal, a prisoner un
der indictment for counterfeiting. O'Neal
was awaiting trial and sat com
placently at the ..Marshal's desk, in
the drawer of which was a ' 44-cal-iber
revolver. It developed subsequently
that O'Neal, though he had been in the
Covington jail for fifteen months, had in
his pof ket a rasor and a package of mixed
cayenne and black pepper. There came a
sudden call from Judge Barr, on the bench,
for the twenty prisoners to receive sen
tence. Slowly they filed out, end passed
across the hall, under charge of deputies, to
the courtroom. Day remaining in the Mar
shal's office, in which only O'Neal and
himself were left. As he closed and locked
the door on the departing prisoners, and
turned back into tfce room, - O'Neal leaped
toward him wifi his package of pepper open
in one hanmd the revolver leveled in the
otb!r-i--4 pepper was most skillfully
ifiwn and filled both of Day's eyes.
In - an instant there was total dark
ness, and an agony of pain.
In absolute darkness and suffering the
most acute pain, Day still remembered
what he had seen when eyesight was left
to him. With a blind sweep of his left
hand he caught the pistol by the barrel,
and with his right caught the villain by
the throat. They went down together.
As they fell the weapon discharged, the
ball gracing Day's hip and bor
ing a hole in the wall, about three feet
hiarh. Then two men. eouallv unwerfiil
the one with full possession of his senses,
desperately bent on liberty or death, and
armed with a self-cocking six-shooter of
the best type, the other totally bliud, racked
with the most acute pain, and only know
ing that he had his man by the throat
struggled for life and death. In his hip
pocket Day had his own pistol. There
was no time to draw it. , Life
hung on the chance of controlling
the pistol which O'Neal held. In this terri
ble struggle amid the darkness the grip of
his right hand never left the throat of the
criminal, and the left hand wrested away
the pistol, turned it, caught the trigger,
pulled blindly, and a ball crushed through
the counterfeiter's body. Then, wild with
agony and excitement, Day rushed into
the court-room with his hand over his
blinded eyes, crying for help. O'Neal is
mortally wounded, and cannot recover.

of timbers and earth. A great crowd of
people soon assembled. The groans of

buried were heartrending.' They called

shovels, and in half an hour two of the vic

FOREIGN NEWS.
Another Battle in Which the Servians
are Victorious.
A Terrible Fire at Plymouth, England, â€”A
A Terrible Fire at Plymouth, England, â€”A Number of Lives Lost.
Belgrade, December 13. A telegram
from the front states that a long and
bloody engagement took place yesterday
between the Servians and Bulgarians. The
town of Veliki-Izoor was wrested from tha
possession of two battalions belonging to
the Pirot Division of the Bulgarian army,
who attacked the Servians. Upon finding
themselves outnumbered the Bulgarians
made signs that they wished to surrender.
The Servians, who were mostly elderly
men belonging to the second reserve,
shouted in reply: "You have
already deluded our children
(meaning the youths of the first reserve) in
that fashion, but you can not deceive us."
Thereupon they charged the Bulgarians
with the bayonet, scattering them in every
direction. The Bulgarians left macy dead
and wounded on the field. The Servians
claim a brilliant victory. Much enthusiasm
is manifested in Belgrade over the success
of the Servians.
London, December 13. A fire which
caused a fearful lou of life occurred to
night at Plymouth. The fire broke out in
a tenement-house in Love street, a narrow
thoroughfare in the slums, devoted to sail
or lodging-houses, cheap taverns and tall
and rickety tenements. Most of the occu
pants of the tenements were . asleep
when the fire started. Those who were
awake or were awakened by the tumult
made frantic efforts to escape. In most
cases their terror overpowered their rea
son, and they escaped from the burning
building only to meet death on
the pavement. One man was instantly
killed and crushed beyond recogni
tion by jumping from a fourthstory win
dow to the sidewalk. Many of the lodgers
threw mattresses and other articles of bed
ding upon the ground and jumped upon
them from a height of forty feet. One child
was killed in this way, and several men
and women had legs and arms broken.
The fire escapes were crowded with house
hold goods and were useless. Many pitiful
sights were witnessed by the large crowd
assembled in the streets, but powerless
to help. One lodger, a young man named
Bfckford, clung to a window sill for
several minutes with' his little sister under
his arm. If he had been alone he could
have dropped to the street in comparative
safety, but the child had swooned and' was
a dead weight. At last he had to let go bia
hold, but he managed to fall in such a
way that the little girl fell on top of him.
Both his legs are broken and his spine in
jured. He is also terribly burned about
the face and hands by the flames which
surrounded him before he fell. The
child is badly burned, but will recover.
The firemen worked heroically. Several of
them were detailed to enter the burning
building, which was then a veritable fur
nace of fire, and rescue the survivors.
These life-savers plunged into the seething
flames, followed by the pipemen, who kept
playing the hose upon them and upon each
other. In this way several lives were
saved. After the fire was extinguished
twelve bodies were found burned to a crisp.
Two lodgers are still missing.
FIENDISH.
Inhuman Treatment to Which Farm-Out
Paupers Were Subjected.
Russell, Mass., December 13. For many
months there have been rumors afloat of
cruel treatment of the town paupers by
KeeperChapman, who has for three years bid
off the 'town's poor at an average of about
seventy -five dollars a year for each pauper.
The Selectmen have persistently denied the
rumors. Two officers-of the State Board
of Health, Lunacy and Charity
have just . completed an inves
tigation. Some of the details of their re
port are too revolting for publication. The
inspectors found filth abounding and
stenches too loathsome for human endu
rance. Not a few of the inmates had for
beds nothing but a pillar of husks upon the
floor, and for covering only old clothing.
Upon such a bed an aged- man named
Thompson died without attention. The
food provided him was uncooked corn
meal, mixed with water. Starvation,
rather than disease or old age, hastened
his death. It is alleged that in his last
moments he called for water to cool his
parched lips, but though his cries were
heard by passersby, none went to his aid.
Not long aero another inmate, once a nror-
erty -owner of the town, died similarly of a
terrible disease. One man, a school teacher
and public lecturer, after enduring assaults
and hunger, finally ran away. Tbe general
care of the paupers was found to be on a

A FIGHT WITH INDIANS.
Hostiles Surprised at Their Bloody Work
in New Mexico and Driven Off.
Deming, N. M., December 13. A courier
arrived at Silver City last night with in
formation that Captain Fountain, of Troop
C, Eighth. Cavalry, and his scouts had
surprised ' hostiles on the 9th at Lillie's
cabin, three miles southeast of Papi
noes. The hostiles had murdered
Lillie and an old man named
Pryor, and had just set fire to Lillie's cabin
when the troops came up. The troops
charged and had a lively fight, wounding
several Indians, and it is believed killing
two. They captured fourteen Indian horses,
one mule and all their supplies of beef,
flour and blankets. The Indians dispersed
in every direction. The mountains are
covered with snow, and the weather is
very cold. It is believed that the hostiles
are endeavoring to reach Mexico, where
they will seek winter quarters.

saloon for the nigbt. He invited several
parties to take a drink with bint. Among
the crowd was a gambler by the name of
Hiram Perry. While the drinks were be
ing set up a woman named Frankie Riley
came in and was invited by Morrison
to join the party in an oyster sup
per. The woman started in advance of the
crowd, and the whole party except Perry
went into a restaurant. About tbe time
Morrison turned from the clerk's desk
Perry began to use some abusive language
toward Morrison and tbe woman. Mor
rison stepped outside tbe door and Perry
said: "I have a notion to kill vou
ind her and myself, and end this'
trouble," and as he spoke drew a large
army pistol and shot Morrison, the ball en-:
tering below the left eye. Death was in
stantaneous. Perry then turned and fired
t tbe woman, who was retreating through
tbe back door of the restaurant. His aim
was good, but some one saw tbe revolver,
leveled in that direction and pulled the
woman aside. The ball shattered ber right
arm. Perry then placed tbe pistol to. bis
own head and blew out nis brains.!

THE MILITARY SERVICE.
Reforms in This Branch of Government
Brought About by Wise Democratic
Legislation.
The most important and suggestive
fact in all the current annual reports
of the militarj establishment is the
great decrease of desertions. During
the previous year the number of
deserters had been 3,741; and that
this prodigious loss was not exceptional
is made known by examining also the
records of the two years preceding that
one. The aggregate desertions for
those three years we find to have been
nearly 11,000 in exact figures 10,991,
which is an average of 8,664 annually.
The maximum enlisted strength of the
army is 25,000, a number rarely
reached on any given date on account
of expiring enlistments; indeed. Gen
eral Sherman, after deducting the va
rious permanent detachments, once
estimated the average enlisted strength
for army work at 23,000. Hence, the
deserters of 1884 numbered nearly one
in six of all the enlisted men. ' - -
When we find, therefore, that dur
ing the past year there were 745 fewer
desertions than the year previous,
bringing the total below 3,000, we cer
tainly have struck upon the most prom
ising feature in the current condition
of the army. Apart from the gain in
discipline and moral effect here im
plied, the actual pecuniary saving in the
expenses of recruiting and in the supply
of clothing, equipments and horses is
very great, since deserters do not scru
ple to take off whatever Government
property may be of service to them. .
What is the cause of this fortunate
change? No doubt several causes have
co-operated to produce it, but the most
potent . probably are the recent wise
and successful efforts to make the call
ing of the soldier more nearly, as Gen
eral Miles once expressed it, "such as
the young men of the country will seek
and the veterans will desire to retain."
The last Congress was nnprecedentedly
liberal in its legislation for this pur
pose. It increased the per diem allow
ances in money paid for the performing
extra or non-militarv dutv. It created
the new grade of Post Quartermaster
Sergeant, which opened eighty new
places for promotion, with increased
pay and allowances, to men who had
served creditably during four years or
more. These promotions and transfers
in turn opened vacancies among the
company sergeants and corporals. Inspector-General
Davis is authority for
the statement also, that the supplies of
food and clothing have been generally
good in quantity and quality, and
promptly delivered during the year.
But perhaps the greatest incentive to
remaining in the service nas neen fur
nished by the act passed by Congress
last winter enabling any enlisted man
who has served as such for thirty years
to be retired, if he wishes, with three-
fourths of his pay, and also of his al
lowances for subsistence and clothing.
Already ninety-five enlisted men, most
ly non-commissioned officers, have
taken the benefit of this act. They
generally get, with their allowances for
food and clothing, from three hundred
dollars to nve hundred dollars a year,
and in some cases still more than the
latter sum. General Rochester has re
commended the Davment of nine dol
lars a month in lieu of the ration and
clothing allowances, and General Drum
suggests a payment of a gross sum for
pay and allowances, which would vary
from $53.40 per month for chief musi
cians to $23.90 for artificers. Thus it
will be seen that the maximum allow'
ance for enlisted retirement is really
aDove six nnnarea dollars a year.
There are many non-commissioned
offices like those of Ordnance Sergeant,
uuartermaster and commissary ser
geant, and Hospital Steward, which
frequently fall as rewards to veteran
soldiers, so that their retired incomes
are generally very good.
Besides this, the laws allowing in
terest on tne deposits of enlisted men.
made from their pay, not only encour
age frugality, but furnish a consider
able capital set aside for old acre.
There is also the possibility of earning
a vuuiniission, since every year sees
promotion from the enlisted men to tho
Second Lieutenancies, r or example.
in 1879 there were six such promo
tions; the next year, fourteen; the next.
one; the next, ten; the next, four; the
next, six; and the present year, we be'
lieve, four or five. But without reck
oning this chance, the youth who en
lists sees before him the prospect of re
tiring at the age of fifty with an income
that will support him to the end of his
days, and long before that age he will
probably, if faithful, have received pro
motion ana lighter -duty, suited to ad
vancing years.
The last Congress legislated wisely in
this respect. Against the increase in
expense it thus authorized was set off a
saving in some other direction; while
now into the ultimate reckoning must
go the saving in the expense of re
cruiting and m the capture of deserters.
Other improvements and reforms in the
condition of the enlisted men are pos-
siDie. Aieanwnue, it may be hoped
that tho monstrous high-water mark of
desertion in the past will never again
be reached. N. Y. Sun.
WRECKS BY THE WAY.
How the Policy of Hate and Sectionalism
Has Worked Upon Several Presidential
Aspirants.
In the general collapse of Republican
hopes on election day the bursting of
sundry Presidential booms, which had
been up to that time most tenderly
nurtured . and solicitously watched
over, escaped general notice. The
wrecks of those booms have been dis
covered among the ruins, presenting a
sorry sight and inculcating a lesson on
the danger pf counting one's chickens
before they are hatched. There is the
Sherman boom, so long wrapped up in
a corner at the bloody shirt, and the
Logan article of the same kind, which
occupied a whole sleeve of the ensan
guined garment. They are but mem
ories now and will, probably, be lost
to memory when the next Republican
National Convention comes around.
Sherman made the serious mistake of
supposing that what was good enough
for Ohio should suit the rest of the
country. When he dangled the badge
of sectional hate before the Buckeyes
and they made no sign, he was encour
aged to try the same performance in
New York and Virginia. He did so,
and the result was highly disastrous to
him. His boom is like Mark Twain's
good little boy, who went fooling
around a nitroglycerine can. There is
not enough of it left for a coroner to
sit on.
Logan, flushed with his accidental
success in Illinois, quitted the bound
less prairies, donned the bloody gar
ment and made a raid on the stump in
this State. He is now searching for
the scattered fragments of his boom.

stale and unprofitable yarn of dissau?
faction between the President and his
Cabinet. It seems useless to endeavor
to convince those crazy-quilt sheets of
the utterly ridiculous nature of such
an asseirtion. They hug the delusion
all the closer, as they do the myths of
John Roach's ruin, the bloody shirt
and the steamship subsidy. .Never was
a Cabinet more harmonious and zeal
ous in carrying out the policy of the
President than that which surrounds
Mr, Cleveland. Every member is -thoroughly
imbued with the spirit
of reform and the necessityaof faith
fully fulfilling the highest expectations
formed of the Administration. - Only
earnest and united efforts could, have
accomplished the vast amount of valu
able work done during the past eight
months. The radical changes intya-
aucea into each oepartment, xacuitat
ing its operations and attaining results
which a year ago would have been
deemed impossible, the sensible im
provement of the public service, effi
ciency, integrity and dispatch taking
the place of incompetency, corruption
and red tape, the abolition of gross
abuses, ' the impartial dispensation of
justice and the infusion of new life,
energy ' and practicability in every
branch of the Government, all testify
to the harmonious working of the .
President and his Cabinet. Those facts
constit ute a sufficient answer to the idle
rumors of the Republican press and are
further corroborated by the testimony
of a high official, who is well informed
on the subject. He says: ; .
Nearly every member of his official Bouse,
.hold has had ad 'sasreement with Mr. Cleve
land, if newspaper reports are to be credited.
Messrs Bayard, Garland and Vilas have been
particularly mentioned as oomlng under tbe
ban of the President s displeasure. And now, ,
It is ag-aln reported that he is dissatisfied with
the Secretary of State. 1 happen to know that
these rumors are wholly groundless. I do not'
believe a President ever got along witn his
Cabinet more harmoniously than Mr. dove
land, anl he has not, nor ever has had, any
idea of making- a chango in tha bead of any
one of tbe departments. The relations be
tween the President and his advisers are of--the
mosi cordial character, and nothing that
I can sei. Is likely to disturb them.
The party organs can not under
stand this harmony, or how - such a
body of public -officials nhould be in- '
spired .solely with the idea of doing
their duty honestly and fearlessly.
Tbey bear in mind only the intrigues
and deceptions of other Cabinets, and .
conclude that the present Administra
tion must follow the example of its Re
publican predecessors. It is hard for
them to acknowledge the superior
working of a Democratic Government,
but they will have to do so, sooner or
later. Meanwhile, to spare themselves
further ridicule, they should give up
the foolish work of manufacturing
trouble in the Cabinet. Their efforts
only excite derision. Albany Argus.
