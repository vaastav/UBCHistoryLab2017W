i
Washington, Dec. t. One of the
first measures of national interest
which will ba introduced in the sen
ate at thii session, -which begins to
day, will ba a resolution looking to
publio action concerning the death of
President HcKinley. TMb will be pre
sented to-morrow by either Senator
Foraker or Senator Hanna, probably
the former, and after its introduction
the senate will adjourn immediately
as a mark of respect to the memory
of the dead president. The annual
message of President Roosevelt will
not be received until to-morrow, and
on this account the session to-day
will be exceedingly brief. It is not
now expected that anything will be
done to-day beyond the announce
ment of the death of Senator Kyle,
following which the senate, in ac
cordance with custom, will adjourn
for the day. To-morrow the presi
dent's message will be read, and, after
its reading the announcement of the
death of President McKinley will fol
low at once, whereupon resolutions
providing for the appointment of a
committee to act with a similar com
mittee if the house of representa
tives to take appropriate action rela
tive to the matter and then calling
for immediate adjournment for the
day will be adopted.'

RIGHT IIP TO DATE.
(Benton'i Plasttr It Pain's Inter.)
Ihma are days of records and of the beat
ing of records, Benson's Porous Plaster, for
quickness of action and thoroughness of
care, has no records to beat except its own.
Benson's Plaster, always the best, always
the leader, is to-day better than ever. It
sticks to the skin but never sticks in its
tracks. It marches on.
The people not only want to be cured
but cured quickly sail Benson's Platter
does it. Uoughs, colds, lumbago, asthma,
brooohiUs, liver and kidney complaints,
u4 other ills approachable by an external
remedy, yield to Benson's as ice does to hear.
Neither Belladonna, Strengthening or
Capsicum plasters are to he compared with
Benson's. People who have once tested
the merit of Benton's Plaster have no um
tor any other external remedy.
More than 6,000 physicians and drag,
gists (and a thousand times as many non
professional persons) have called Benson's
Plasters one of the few (1) home remedies
that can be treated.
Fifty-ftT highest awards have been mad
to tt to competition with Um beat known
gluten of Europe and America. Better
proof of it SMrtts is IncoaceirabI. Be
.are o get the genuine.
For sal by all drnfjrjsta, at w will pre.
pay postage oa any number arderail ia the
VMIWf W sTSJns B(P rsiniawssn
uooa or tnerli. Among the first bills
of importance to be presented will
be the ship subsidy bill, which will
be introduced by Senator Frye, and
the Nicaraguan canal bill, which Sen
ator Morgan will present. Other
early bills of importance will be one
looking to the construction of a sub
marine cable from the western coast
to Hawaii, and another providing for
the establishment of a new executive
department to be known as the de
partment of commerce. On Thurs
day the senate will adjourn until the
following Monday. The general opin
ion among senators is that very little
real work will be done before the
Christmas holidays.
The programme for the opening
dny in the house, 'although it will fol
low rigidly routine precedents, will
be interesting. The speaker will be
formally elected and escorted to the
chair by a committee, Gen, Hender
son, whose , re-election as speaker is
assured, will then address the house,
after which Mr. Bingham, of Penn
sylvania, "the father of the house.
a titular honor bestowed upon the
oldest member in point of continuous
service, will administer the oath to
him. The speaker in turn will admin
ister the oath to the members-elect.
The old officers of the house who
were rechoRen by the republican can
cus then will be re-elected and sworn
In. Following this resolutions will be
adopted to appoint committees to in
form tjie president and the senate
that the house has elected flen. Hen
derson speaker and Mr. McDowell
clerk. Jly resolution Speaker Hender
son then will appoint a committee of
three to oin a similar committee
from the senate to inform the presi
dent that a quorum of the two houses
has assembled and that congress is
ready to receive any communication
he may have to make. Resolutions
to adopt temporarily the rules of the
last house and to fix the daily hour
of meeting also will precede the event
'of the opening day, the annual seat
drawing. Gen. Grosvenor, of Ohio,
probably will mnke the announce
ment to the house of the death of the
late President McKinley and offer the
resolutions upon which the house will
act., After to-morrow the house
probably will adjourn three days at
a time until congress recesses for the
Christmas holidays. Speaker Hender
son will occupy this time preparing
his committee lists, which will be an
nounced as soon as the house con
venes after the holidays. Practically
no business will be transacted before
the holidays.

HARMLESS AS MILK
Look out what you put into
the child's stomach I Children
are especially sensitive to the
action of medicine. Bui
you need never fear Scott's
Emulsion. That is one reason
why it is so popular as a chil
dren's medicine.
"As harmless as milk"
that is saying a good deal. But
we may go even further and
say that Scott's Emulsion will
stay on the child's stomach
when milk will not.
A little added to the milk in
baby's bottle and a little after
meals for older children is
just the right thing for the
weak and sickly ones.
