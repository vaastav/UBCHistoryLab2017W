OUR GREAT WATER-LIIE.
The proposition of Governor Walker to
turn over the interests of the State in the
James River and Kanawha Canal to a com
pany of gentlemen of "established reputa
tion for probity and financial ability," or.
condition that they shall complete the work
in a satisfactory manner within a specified
period, strikes us as extremely inopportune,
to say the least, at the present time. How
ever conspicuous a monument of folly it
may be to the State, in the estimation of its
Executive head, we cannot regard the
work, costly as it may have been
m its construction thus far, as money
thrown away in the interests of Virginia.
Tne project is one of the grandest ever con
ceived by Virginia statesmanship, and the
extent to which it has been carried fully
demonstrates the practicability of the great
undertaking.
It- is true that the work has terribly
lagged in its prosecution thus far, but the
State has something more than "worthless
stock" in tho hundred an! ninety-eight
miles already completed. Large commer
cial advantages have accrued to the State,
and particularly to this city, and there is
soircely an estimable limit to the advan
tages that still may flow from it.
We consider tho proposition of tho Gov
ernor as exceedingly inopportune, for the
roa-on that for the flrst time in the history
of the Federal government there Is a rea
sonable prospect that it may be taken hold
of as a great national work and substan
tially carried through to its proposed west
cm terminus. The President commends
tho undertaking in connection wilh the pro
posed action of the State, and there are
special considerations moving in the
direction of this great eutirprise which
should not be lost sight of at this time.
The Governor estimates the cost of com
pleting tho work and enlarging it to the
d.mnnds of the probable commerce that
will follow, at forty millions of dollars,
and how this vast sum is to be ob
tained ? We answer that if it is obtained
at all it will bo by tho aid of the Federal
government, and not by any company of
" responsible gentlemen," sucti as the Gov
ernor may pledge himself to obtain, in case
the splendid franchise is turned over to
them by the commissioners to mako the
transfer.
The work is admitted to be one of na
tional importance, and of incalculable
benefit to commerce and to the Federal
government in time of war. But the Gov
ernor thinks it does not fall within the
category of national improvements, such as
Congress will be likely to take hold of and
perfect. In coming to this conclusion, his
Excellency must havo ignored the
more recent facts of history, and gone back
to those of old Bourbonish times, when,
under the lead of Virginia statesmanship,
t'io wl ole South was arrayed against every
measure of internal improvement that
might be brought before tlie Federal gov
ernment. It is not thes. grand national
enter pi ises thitt have fallen out of the
"ca'egory," but old Bouibonism itself,
on 1 nobody wil! regret its disappearance
through the " hole of a category."
The National government is now tho
r Highly alivo to a system of epleii.
did internal improvements, and none,
IB all the category, comes up in importance j
and value, nt a national work, tothe James \
River and Kanawha Canal.
To turn this splendid work over to a j
company of speculators, no matter of what I
repulation for probity and financial ability, I
would bo tho worst concclvnblo policy for I
the State at this time. The action taken
by the Legislature at its last session is man
ifestly on. in tho right direction, and the
President has promptly responded fo the
band-iome overture of the State in commend
ing its proposition to the favorable considera
tion of Congress. We want to see no change
In the policy of la*t winter, as regards this
important public interest of our State j
and least of all, do we want to see the en
terprise in the hands of private individuals,
to manipulate in their own interest rather
than for the highest good of the State.
Our neighbors in West Virginia are
having a vexatious time of if. in attempting
to get a Congressional delegition. The ab
scinded Stato has made two efforts thus
far this year to elect members to the
next Congress. _he thought she succeeded
the last time, but has now awakened from
the pleasant delusion by tho threat to in
troduce a bill into tho House of Represent
atives fixing the tirno for holding another
election. All Iho difficulty has arisen from
tho vagueness in the phraseology of the
acts under which the elections in the State
havo been held. The experience of West
Virginia is a warning to law-makers to cul
tivate clearness of expression, and precision
in tho use of language.
New Haven has just established a
working-woman's home, comprising a res
taurant, reading-room and sewing-room.
There are ia every city suoh resorts for
young men, and no effort is spared to make
them attractive. Such an institution is as
moch nr-eded everywhere for women, who
are deprived of the comforts of home, and
shut out, in a gprest measure, from the re»
creations of society.
The fraternal relations now existing be- \
tween Great Britain and the United States :
Wero the topic of an address by Mr. Glad
stone at a recent banquet given in London
by Mr. C. W. Field, of New York. No
■ expression of cordiality and good will was
wanting to the speech of the Prime Minis
ter; and on tho part of all present, Amer
icans and English, the old ties of language,
li erature and kinship were in their flow
ing cups freshly remembered. Mr. Field
himself, as tha host of tha occasion, was
exposed to a storm of compliments, Mr.
Gladstone himself taking the lead. He had
j seen much, he said, in the course of his
life, of the commercial enterprise of his
country and tho world, and it had been his
very pood fortune that the greater part of
. his political responsibility had been in im
mediate connection with the commercial
and trading interests of that kingdom. But
in his recollection he could not point to an
example of novel enterprise so remarka
ble, pursued under the influence of a confi
dence which was not rash enthusiasm, but
true scientific enquiry, as that which Mr.
Field had prosecuted, under circumstances
of the extremest outward disadvantage, in
perfecting electric telegraphy.
With reference to the recommendations
of the President's Message concerning the
California and Australian steamship line,
it should bo remembered that the popula
tion of Australia, the future great repub
lic, is estimated at 2,500,000 English-speak
ing people, with a commerce of $400,000
yearly. This trade is naturally ours, since
wo have built the great highway to tho Pa
cific, a short route to the East. But our
Pacific railways will have been built in
vain if we let pass the opportunity of gain
ing to our people tho immense advantages
which would accrue to us from controlling
the rich trade of the Pacific, the increase
of which from year to year is perfectly
marvelous.
The movement for a Constitutional
Amendment, giving to the people a direct
vote for President and Vice-President, as a
substitute for the present system, is likely
to receive considerable impetus from the
death of Mr. Greeley; since the decease of
a defeated candidate before the voio of the
Presidential electors is cast, naturally sug
gests the possibility of the death of the
. elected candidate before such an event, and
t shows the dangerously indirect method by
wliich the President is now chosen. The
only effective remedy would seem to lie in
tho abolition of tbo Electoral College, and
tho substitution of a direct vote of the
people.
We admire the manner in which Mr.
Speaker Blame met the Credit .Mobil er
slander, which ho did in the most manly
and dignified way. He promptly asked lor
a committee of investigation, and called
AJr. Cox to tho chair in order that the ma
jority of the committee might bo com
posed of his political opponents. Nothii g
could more convincingly indicate his con
sciousness of entire innocence and recti
tude, and his desire for a most searching
investigation. It is understood that the
other members of the House, involved
with him in these slanders, entirely con
curred in his action.
The ladies have another very conspicu
ous feather in their caps, placed there by
Postmaster-General Creswell. In a letter
. to a prominent Prussian official, he has
taken occasion to pay a very decided com
pliment to the women employed in govern
ment positions at Washington, praising
their efficiency in very warm terms. He
says truly that there i 3 a growing public
sentiment in this country which favors the
employment of tho gentler sex wherever
they can appropriately and satisfactorily
perform the duties required.
THE Chesapeake and Ohio railroad will
be completed and in running order by the
Ist of March next. But a few miles now
remain unfinished. The road 13 first-class
in every particular, of a most solid charac
ter, T rails, well ballasted, and built with
reference to the demands of a large busi
ness, so that it can readily Vie converted
into a doublo irack. The immediate liaffic
will be in coal and Western tobacco and
flour for Kichmond.
We acknowledge the receipt of the Rr. j
| port of the Second Auditor, giving his an- j
j nual exhibit of the publio debt of the State, j
J and the condition of ite literary fund ; but
j have not time to-day to subject its figures
to a comparison with those of previous
i years, so as to determine what improve-
I mout, if any, has been made ia tha condi
tion of our finances.
The decision of M. Thiers and his Min
is ry to remain at their posts of duty has
produced a pacifying effect through tho
country, and people are now anxiously
awaiting the action of the Committee of
Thirty (an unfortunate historical number)
appointed by Minister Oufaure's resolution
of Friday.
Associate Justice N_xson, of the
Supreme Court, has tendered his resigna
tion to the President. The Judge is as
full of honors as of years, and has had a
hand in moulding some of the more admi
rable part, of his country's judicial system.
