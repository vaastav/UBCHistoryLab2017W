TREASURY STATEMENT SHOWS
TOTAL GOLD IN COUNTRY
TO BE $1,561,714,719.
New York, Dec. 10.—The events of
the last week In the financial world
have been such as usually mark the
gradual return of confidence and the
restoration of normal conditions in the
banks. The decision of the secretary
of the treasury to issue only about
$40,000,000 of the $150,000,000 In new
securities which he expressed a will
ingness to issue if conditions required;
the disclosure of unusually strong re
serves by country banks reporting to
the comptroller of the treasury; the
decline in the currency premium, and
the improvement in the New York
bank statement have all been features
of the week which have tended toward
stability and reassurance.
The action of the secretary of the
treasury in limiting the issues of se
curities was a part of the original plan
recommended to him to meet the situ
ation by a resolute and adequate meas
ure, but to carry the execution of the
measure no further than circumstances
required.
The result of limiting the issue of
the Panama 2 per cent bonds'to $25,
000,000 and the one-year treasury cer
tificates to about $15,000,000 will be to
considerably simplify the problem of
the treasury management and money
market conditions during the spring.
It is anticipated by iar-sighted bankers
here that there will be a plethora of
money soon instead of a dearth, and
that it will be necessary to reduce in
some way the large volume of currency
brought into use during the crisis.
Tlie increase in money in circulation
outside the treasury, as shown by the
monthly statement of the treasury de
partment for November, was $131,872,
887. Of this amount the increase in
gold in the country is computed at
about $72,000,000, including domestic
production as well as importations
from abroad. The other principal form
of increase is in bank circulation, in
which an increase of $7,533,521 was ob
tained by the disbursement of bank
notes held in the treasury,»and $46,
237,730 was obtained by actual in
crease in the notes issued by the con
troller and outstanding.
There have been fears in some quar
ters that If anything approximating
$100,000,000 in new bank notes were
issued upon the securities of the one
year certificates the result in inflation
would be to hold gold in large amounts
after the credits issued by the crop
movement were exhausted. This dan
ger will be reduced to a minimum by
the relatively small issues made by the
treasury, and If small amounts in gold
should be exported it is felt that they
could be spared, in view of the large
gold resources in the country to which
President Roosevelt called attention
in announcing the new loans.
The total gold in the country re
ported by the last treasury statement
is $1,561,714,719, which is equal to
more than 50 per cent of the total
money in circulation. Some further
Increase in bank circulation is expect
ed here upon the Panama bonds and
the treasury certificates, but it is be
lieved that the bonds will be deposited
in many cases as security for the pub
lic money which has been left with the
banks and will not be employed as a
basis for circulation until the one-year
certificates are canceled in the spring.

THEY RUB THE ANANIA8 BUNCH
Gridiron Club Collecta Roosevelt
Strenuous Terms.
The Gridiron club held high Jinks at
the New Willard, at Washington,
D. C., Saturday night. For four hours
the' newspaper boys poked fun without
discrimination.
1 The president was not there, but
several comedies were directed his
way. A huge fellow claiming to be a
Japanese wrestler who recently ex
hibited at the White House, pushed
his way into the hall. When he could
not find the president he offered to
take a fall out of Vice President Fair
banks, Senator Foraker and Senator
Knox. He had no takers.
Vice President Fairbanks "got his in
melody" to the tune of "Budweiser."
The boys sang the "Tale of the Cock
tail," a musical commentàry on his fa
mous cocktail dinner.
Fairbanks was given a glass of but
termilk to drink while the song was
rendered.
The session of the Undesirable Citi
zens' association was a rib tickler.
Harriman was there, and so was Sen
ator Foraker and a number of others.
The finale was a huge phonograph,
which issued these words:
"Undesirable citizens," "Mendacious
scoundrels," "Wilful falsifiers," "Liar,
Liar, Liar," "Malefactors of great
wealth," "Sheer invention," "Shorter
and uglier word" and "No swollen for
tunes."
When the room became quiet the
club phonograph retired with the re
mark "Our master's voice."
A class in nature faking through
questions and answers, developed a
logical connection between "Octopus"
and Wall street. Also if it is true
money talks, "President Roosevelt
must be the richest man in the world."
"John Barrett ain't broke," re
marked one of the class.
The story that George Washington
threw a dollar across the Potomac was
declared not to be a nature fake, be
cause Secretary Cortelyou had thro/wn
$20,000,000 to Wall street.
"Why are the ships going to the
Pacific?" was answered in many ways,
chief among which was "to seat Sec
retary Metcalf in the senate." The new
state of Oklahoma made its appear
ance with democratic senators and
representatives and an electoral vote
for Bryan. Chairman New of the re
publican national committee was re
quested to "think it over," and then
pranced in on hobby horses a squad
of equestrian tested army officers.
"We will now drink to the president
of the United States," solemnly an
nounced President Biythe, after he had
got to their feet Vice President Fair
banks, Speaker Cannon, Secretary Cor
telyou and Senator Knox.
The menu souvenir was a collection
of clearing house certificates, issued
by authority of the Gridiron Club
Clearing House association. *
