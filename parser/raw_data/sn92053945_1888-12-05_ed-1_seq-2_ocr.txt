According to a recent report in some
of the Philadelphia newspapers, a large
any, backed by millions of dollars,
has proposed to the secretary of the navy
a striking and possibly effective scheme
for the defense of that harbor and the
harbors of other cities from the attacks
of an enemy's fleet, by shooting ignited
petroleum at the unfriendly ships from
the bottom of the river and burning them
up. The rear admiral has been directed
to study closely the harbor of PniladeN
V-hia and its approaches. The petroleum
defense scheme, the originators of which
have induced the government to make this
preliminary examination of the PhiladeN
pliia harbor, is a brilliant one in more re
spects than one. A company has been
organized at Washington to develop
the plan and to show its practicability
It Is proposed to siok perforated iron
pipeB in the river bed and the approaches
to the harbor, through which petroleum
can be forced to the surface of the river
by machinery and at a high pressure. In
this way a tierce stream of blazing oil can
be sent down on the enemy's fleet to de
stroy it or drive it away.
Two Ginntic Slows
Democratic members of congress are
HBarult: extremely ret ice at as to what line
ieBsion of 'congress Tlk-jT nearly 'ttU'ef
press a desire to confer with their demo
cratic colleaijuefl before com mil ting them'
selves . An exception to this rule is Rep-
resentative Springer, of IlKnoia. Re in
sists that one of the first things the house
will do will be to pass his Oklahoma bill,
and that the next thing will be to pass
bill for the admittance of at least four
territories into the union as states.
Tlie territories that Mr. Springer desires
to admit are Dakota, Montana, Washing
ton and New Mexico. He may pass his
bill through the house, but he will find
the republican senate an unsurmountable
barrier. The republicans will selfishly
claim the privilege of admitting the ter
ritories in a manner that will yield every
possible partisan advantage. They will
probably dt-cline to admit New Mexico,
lecause it is likely to be democratic, and
will admit Dakota as two states, not that
there is any plausible reason for doing
so, but simply because they have the
power, and thereby pain two additional
votes in the senate and in tne electoral
college. After the fourth of March the
republicans hope to have things pretty
much their own way.
The message of President Cleveland,
read at the convening of the second ses
sion of the Fiftieth congress, is a master
piece of statesmanship and erudition.
In consequence of the many important
questions requiring the attention of con
gress, the document is necessarily of con
siderable lengths but throughout its en
tirety there is that frankness and perspi
cuity which has been a marked feature
of all the president's utterances. There
is not the slighest trace of disappointment
or any allusion to bis defeat whatsoever,
and if one could forget for the moment
the result of the recent election, the un
flagging interest evinced by the president
in national measures would lead one to
suppose that he had again been chosen to
preside over the destinies of the nation.
Even the most hide-bound partisan can
hardly fail but admire the president for
his undaunted mein and calm resignation
to the will of the people.
The message bristles from beginning to
end with democratic logic. On the tariff
President Cleveland reiterates, although
possibly in stronger terms, bis famous
message of a year ago, receding not one
lota from his former declaration that
reduction of the revenues waa highly es
sential to the continued prosperity of the
country. He excoriates the trusts and
over-fed monopolies and pleads for the
relief of the common people from unneces
sary taxation. While the tariff is given
special attention, other weighty matters
such as the fisheries dispute and other.
foreign affairs, the consular service,
treasury, army and navy reports, etc.,
etc. , are given proper recognition.
Every voter in the United States should
not rmly read the message, but make it a
tudy.
Pscallarltlea of tb "Forming Pod" Cul
ture, Planting and Harvest I up The, Cali
fornia Method Vn It and Red Varieties.
Peanut Oil and Pannt Floor.
The peanut is a lugtuninous plant, botanic
ally known as the arachis hrpogcea. It has
several other common names than that by
which we are accustomed to call it, among
tbera being ground pea and ground nut In
the southern states it is known as pindar and
goubar, while by the French it is catted the
pistache de terre. It ia generally believed to
be indigenous to Africa, although there are
nve or six species of the genus found grow
ing wild in Brazil. It has been successfully
Introduced into Spain, has for several years
heen raised in the states of Virginia, Georgia,
Tennessee, and has mure recently heen culti
vated in California, A small variety also
grows in China.
Roughly speaking. It might he said that
the peanut looks like clover and grows like a
west potato, hut for those who prefer a
stricter and more botanical description, the
following may he quoted: The plant is a
diffusely branched, trailing annual, with ab
ruptly pinnate leaven with four leaflets; the
small yellow flowers are in auxiliary heads
or spikea; calyx with one narrow lobe mak
ing a lower lip, the upner hp four toothed
and with a long, thread like tube; heel or the
corolla incurved and jwinted; stamens united
into a tube by thf ir fihments, each alternate
shorter than the others; o ary at the lottom
or tne long calyx tmo. After the flower
falls away the forming pod is forced into
the soil by the elongation of the rigid de-
flexed stalk to which it is attached. The
forming pod then rapidly enlarges and forms
tbick shelled, tndehiscent nod, with a
strongly netted surface, often mi it mi -ted be
tween the seeds, of which it contains t wo or
three. These have very thick cotyledons
and an extremely short radicle.
THE "FORMING POO."
The burying of the "forming pod'1 or nut
by the "elongation of the rigid, deflexed
talk" is the peculiarity of this plant, and is
one of the curiosities of the vegetable king
dom. The flower and leaf stalks are of en
tirely different clmnicters. The flower stalk
is a trailing vine like that of the melon And
cucumber, the blossums appearing at short
intervals along it length. The flower ojwns
and blossoms close down to the stalk, and it
is not until nftt-r the petals have fallen and
the seed pod is finned that the pushing
power is made manifest, (iradually the seed
pod or nut is lifted uw;iy from the stem and
little stalk shews itself. As this stalk
grows so the nut t the end f it is pushed
forward until it curves over like a fish lunik.

down to the ground, mvl then pushed into it.
If by any a-ciuVnt this is prevented U.m fruit

The culture of the peanut is not difficult.
Good corn land is generally selected iu this
country, can.' tein- taken that there is noth
ing in the land that would stain the shells.
Iu this state a sandy loam that never suffers
from drought should be chosen. In fact.
good melon land is generally good peanut
land. The bottom lands on the Imrdera of
rivers that receive a winter or spring over
flow are admirablv adapted for the growth
of this nut. The plan of planting adopted in
tbtftouth is to mark off the land in furrows
three feet apart, and in these two peas are
dropped at intervals of eighteen inches and
covered an inch and a half deep.
Wheu the nuts are ripe, which will be in
October, the California peanut fanner runs
a furrow on each side of the row of vines
with a bull tongued plow, close enough to
loosen the sou and plants. Then he takes
light and narrow grubbing hoe, digs up the
vines and turns them over to dry, taking care
never to gather in rainy weather or wben the
ground is very wet. After allowing toe vines
to lie in the sun for a dav the best plan is to
stack them, after the dew has dried, in the
following fashion: Drive a stake of four or
five feet long tirmly into the groupd, spread-
lng dried grass or hay around it, so as to
keep the vines from the damp ground. Then
lay the vines around the pon with the roots
inward, taking care to leave a space around
the stake for purposes of ventilation, and
wben the stack is of a proper height thatch it
with a straw cap tied to the staka Let the

WHITE AST) RED VARIETIES.
A clean, bright appearance of the pods is
largely to be desired, and to get this the nuts
are sometimes put into a sort of winnowing
cage, which is turned either by hand or
power. There are two sorts of peanuts
grown m California the white and the red
and to make the white variety still whiter
the nuts are sometimes treated to sulphur
fumes. The red variety, by the by, is mora
easily cultivated and sells for about the
same price. The white variety runs along
the ground, while the red grows upright in
a bunch. The picking is a rather arduous
task, but the labor will in all probabity be
modineu by tne use ot machinery.
The peanut is a useful product much
more so, indeed, than people imagine. We
all know how extensively it is eaten in its
roasted state, but therein by no means lies
the extent of its value. The nuts contain
from A'2, to 50 per cent, of a nearly colorless,
bland, fixed oil, resembling olive oil, and
used for similar purposes. The best is ob
tained by cold expression, but a large quan
tity of inferior oil is procured by heating
the seeds before pressing. It is a non-drying
oil changing but slowly by exposure to the
atmosphere, and remaining fluid in a cold
everal degrees below m degs. Fahrenheit.
It contains besides oleic and palmitic acids
two other oily acids, which have been called
the araahio and hypogseic, though it is
doubtful if they are really distinct The
principal consumption of the oil is in soap
making.
In lao3 lrgima began the manufacture of
peanut flour, the result being a peculiarly
palatable biscuit, while Georgia has long
made pastry of pounded peanuts. The kernels
roasted are largely used iu the manufacture
of chocolate, while the araaitde de terre, as
has been shown, is used by the confectioners.
It is also eaten as a fruit and roasted for
coffee. The poor man a fruit, the peanut, is
capable of sustaining life for a long time,
owing to its peculiarly nutritive qualities.

Washington City, Dec, 5. There was a
notable gathering at Wil lard's hotel yester
day. The members of the board of promo
tion oE the proposed constitutional centen
nial and the world's exposition assembled
there at noon. This board includes repre
sentative men from every part of the coun
try. This was a general meeting of the
board to hear the reports of officers and of
the executi ve committee showing the progress
made in the work of preparing the way for
the proposed celebration
Mayor Smith, of Cincinnati, as a nee
president, took the chair. Mayor Smith
made a brief speech, commending the ob
jects that they had in view. Mr. Smith
called for the report of the executive com
mittee. Secretary Anderson presented this
in an address. He said that the 110,000,000
people of the new world desire to eommem
orate the 400th anniversary of the discovery
of America by Columbus, and eighteen
American sister republics desire to celebrate
the centenary of the inauguration of consti
tutional government upon the western
hemisphere. The movement be said, has re
ceived the written endorsement ot the gov
ernors of forty states and territories, who
have formally accepted membership in the
national board ot promotion. It bad
been endorsed by the mayors of fifty-seven
leading cities, PR) presidents and secretaries
of boards of trade in the United States,
and the masters and secretaries of most of
the state and territorial granges. In brief
it has received the cordial and enthusiastic
approval of the press and public of the three
Americas. In addition to this, the govern
ment ot Spain has acted oilicially in the
matter aud has expressed a desire to pay
tribute to America by celebrating th 400th
anniversary of Us discovery.
Secretary Anderson explained that the
proposed exhibit by merchants and manu
facturers is but a temporary affair for the
six months of 1SV3, and should then be
moved; whereas the state and t- .itorial and
the three Americas1 exhibit should remain
for all time, as a lasting monumeat to the
progress and devel opment of American
states and nations. The proposed exposition
of the three Americas at Washington, be
said, is a matter of transcendently prac
tical importance to the merchants and man
ufacturers of the united States, and may
easily be made the entering wedge to an
enlarged foreign commerce with the rest of
this hemisphere.
Resolutions were offered and adopted to the
effect that the bills now pending in congress
having in view a centennial celebration in
low of the ad ption of the com itution, and
three Americas exposition m IWi, are
heartily approved by this convention, and
that their passage is hereby earnestly peti
tioned for.
In the evening the members of the board
were entertained at a banquet.

Thrae Kind of Rope Walking.
I need not say that there are several kinds
of rope walking, for quo has only to visit an
American circus to see more than one variety
practiced in tne same ring. Wcm the pro
fession recognise three legitimate forms, of
which one, however, is almost obsolete now-
adavs. Taking them in the order of their
difficulty, and therefore, I presume, their
attractiveness, there Is first the high rope,
which is nxed as near tbe clouds as the per
former dare venture or the law will allow:
secondly the "low rope," on which the more
youthful performers disport themselves, and
which is stretched only some seven or eight
feet from tne ground; and lastly, the old
fashioned "ascension1' rope, which I have re
ferred to as ling out of date entirely. This
last ism all probability the oldest form of
tight rope walking, and I believe dates back
to classic times. It receives its name from
the fact that tbe performer walks up a rope
which is stretched from the ground to
convenient elevation forty or fifty feet away.
When I was young it was still popular, and
even today wo often speak of a separate per
formance on a high rope as "an ascension. '
I need not say that the difficulty of this form
of rope walking is trifling as compared witb
that now generally practiced.
I may also mention wire walking as a
branch of the profession; but it is not
actually so recognized by us. Curious as it
may ieem to an outsider, it is much easier to
walk on a wire than on tbe regular hempen
Jrope, and, with a little perseverance and
some natural abiaty to start with,
may learn to walk tbe wire within three or
four weeks at the outside, 1 once had a man
as an assistant who never walked a rope in
his life, but shortly after he left me he was
advertised as a marvelous wire walker and
obtained a good salary. J. F. Blondin in

Washington Crrr, Dec 5. Senator In-
galls was asked yesterday morning by a rep
resentative ot tbe United Tess for bis opin
ion of the president's message. ltb th delib
eration which is characteristic of ail bis
utterances, Ingalls said: "The most painful
feature of the message to me is the absence
of all allusion to civu service reform. Tbe
message differs from that which the presi
dent sent 'o congress a year ago in dealing,
as it does, with more than one topic. The

has concealed it, and if he felt any irritation
at the action of tbe senate in rejecting tha

Opponent nf the JHrnct Tax Bill Not
Likely to Filibuster.
Washington City, Dec. 5 It is very
generally understood that the direct tax bill
which caused a deadlock at tbe last session of
congress will be taken up for a ctton in tbe
house on Thursday. From expressions of
opinion among tbe members of congress
who were m the opposition last session, it is
not thought that they can now successfully
resist ita passage. Tbe general opiuionis,
however, that if tbe bill is oassed it will be
vetoed by tbe president. This was the un
derstanding at the last session, and it was to
relieve tbe president of tbe embarrassing
effect of a veto message in the teeth of the
presidential campaign that tbe opposition
resorted to filibustering tactics to defeat the

sition will resort to obstructive tactics to de
feat tbe bill. It will probably be content to
put itself on record as opposed to it, and
rely on the president to veto it.

Subject at Chicago.
Chicago, Dec. 5. A waterways conven
tion was held here yesterday, consisting of
delegates from this city and the other chief
cities on the line of the Illinois & Michigan
canal and on the Illinois river. The state
canal commissioners were also present. The
object was to discuss projected drain
age and ship canal schemes, looking
to the construction of a steamer chan
nel connecting Lake Michigan with the Illi
nois and Mississippi rivers, Chicago's inter
est in it being not only of a commercial char
acter but also a matter of getting rid of tbe
great volume of sewage of this city. There
was much talk, but it all crystalized into tbe
resolution:
'That It is the sense of this meeting that thn
citizens on the Desplalnw ani Illinois river will
oppose all propositions from Chicago to construct
a channel to carry its sewage through the Des-
piaines and Illinois rivers, unless said channel
shall be constructed of such capacity sa
to be used as a .part of improve
ment to connect l.ke Michigan with the Mis
sissippi river," which was amended to provide
that xhe channel shall not be leas in width than
ISO feet and of a depth ot not less than SM feet

So Far mm Making Newspapers Is Con
cerned Your lally Sensation To Be
Bead to Yon and the Best of the Fam
ily Culmination of the Phonograph,
Provided the Menlo Park Geulua Does
Not Live Too Long.
New York, Dec. 5. When, a few years
ago, Thomas A. lison announced that be
would bottle up the human voice so that at
any future tima it could be uncorked and
heard to speak again, there were many with
open skepticism. Sow, if Mr. E lison
who heard the statement were to an
nounce that he would talk with persons on
the planet Mars it would be generally cred
ited. The wizard of Menlo park has not
quite acomplished that much, however, but
be proposes to do something about as won
derful in the near future. Thw modern news
paper is a triumph of the creative power of
man, but Mr. Edison proioses to revolution
ize journalism by starting a newspaper
which can be appreciated by the blind, and
even by tha illiterate. To obtain the news
of tbe day from Mr. Elison's propsed jour
nal, all that one will have to do will be to
turn a crank and listen and the newspaper
will read itself to him.
Some inkling of this marvelous project of
the great inventor having b ;en secured a re
porter went out to Mr. Edison's laboratory at
Orange, N. J. Mr. Eiison was greatly sur
prised that any hint of the new invention
had got abroad, an I at first was loath to
talk about it. It is simply one of the prac
tical uses to which tbe phonograph in its full
perfection can be put It is generally known
to people at largo taat Mr. E lison bas suc
ceeded in turning out what be calls corres
pondence phonograms. These phonograms
are made of a peculiar waxy composition
and oan be f tlded ani put in an envelope
tbe same as an ordinary letter. ben a
message which bas been traced upon them
by a phonographic needle is to be made pub
lic they are wrapped around
phonographic cylinder and by the revo
lution of tbe motor emit the sounds or the
voice which originally talked to tbera.
These correspondence phonograms can be
multiplied to any extent by a wonderful
process, details of which are yet to be made
public.
It was stated at tbe laboratory by one in
tbe secret that if necessary 2",000 or more
copies of the same cylinder could be turned
out in one hour. They can be adjusted to
any phonograph, so that 20,000 or more
"talking machines" can repeat the same
sentence at a given moment. The possibility
of this was suggested to the inventor for the '
benefit of those who wished to keep abreast
of the news of the day, but who from failing
eyesight or from other canies are not able to
rear! newspapers. Tbe Eiison Talkins-Iiews-paper
company will supply its patrons with
the phonographs at an annual rental of a
small sum. These phonographs can be used,
the same as any other, to reproduce sing
ing, piano-playing, whistling, band music,
and elocution, but they will be espe
cially designed for correspondence. Phon
ograms later will contain each day
all the latest news in condensed
form and will cover each subdivision, such
as cable and telegraphic, political, dramatic,
commercial, monetary, etc Each phono
gram will bj plainly marked so that tha
reader, or rather hearer, can choose for
himself which one he cares to use first. If a
new opera has been produ?ed the night be
fore be can listen to an able but concise crit
icism of it and enjoy the sensation of having
repeated to hts delighted ears choicest pass
aces of muic precisely as they were ren
dered at the theater. If an important polit.
ical deba te is going on tbe subscriber will be
treated to tbe most eloquent portions of tbt
speeches in the original tone of the orator.
Even the appln use or langhter which greets
bon mots wni tw faitnfuliy reproduced.
At first it will be only designed, as has
been stated, to furnish a synopsis of the
daily news, but for this purpose the first
editions of regular newspapers will be read,
condensed and repeated to receiving phono
graphs multiplied on corresponding phono
grams, and delivered by carriers to subscrib-
braakfaal tattle, and not only ha. hut A'h
raemoer of the family, can listen to it at the
same time. There will be, wben the project
has baen thoroughly established, several
editions of the talking newspaper. Some of
them will be elaborate, and will give full re
ports of most important happenings.
It will not t necessary, with the talking
and singing newspaper, for the unimagina
tive reader to worry himself by striving to
gather from the critic's description just what
pianist's performance sounded bert. He will
hear them. Instead of tbe hackneyed phrase.
"Thunders of applause greeted the speaker's
eloquence, the talking-newspaper sub
ftcriber will be deafened by the
thunder himself. If tbe president of
tbe United States goes fishing the
newspaper hearer will be able to catch the ex
act shade of triumph in his tone as be exclaims
to his private secretary, "1 ve got a bite,"
or the piecise tone of disappointment as be
adds, "Hy Jovel I've lost him!" This may
sound like romance, but the public bas Mr.
kdison's awiirance that it is quite possible
end will prcbnbly be accomplished in the not
distant future. Phonograms, as at present
made, will cost about J0 cents a cylinder.
Each one will contain about a column of
ordinary newspaper reading matter, and the
news of the day can easily be condensed into
that space. luis, however, is only the cost
of the phonograms in their semi-experimental
stage, and in future they will undoubt
edlv be brought down to a price far below
this.

Justice Kersten yesterday morning, address
ing Louis Rueinhardt, a well-dressed, good
looking young man, who stood before him
with bowed head and tba tears dropping
down on his gold-rimmed eyeglasses.
"I am guilty," said tbe prisoner, in a low
voice.
Manager Roberts, of Peter Van Schaack &
Bon, wholesale druggists on Lake street, was
tbe young man's accuser. He said Rbein
hardt had been employed by the firm for
several years as a salesman. He was consid
ered an honest, faithful employe until Satur
day last, when $2o, which had just been taken
in on a bill of goods, disappeared. It was
believed that Richardson had taken the
money, and he was watched. Monday te
was caught in the act of taking IM
which a customer had paid bim. Then
his house was searched and a miscellaneous
collection of goods, cigar, VHiuable drugs,
and other articles which he had stolen from
the store, wns found. Mr. Roberts aaid tbe
stealing had heen going on for a year and a
half, and it was believed that Rheinhardl
had taken altogether from $1,500 to $;,ou0
worth of goods.
Just then the prisoner's wife, who bad been
silting among the spectators in the court j
room, rushed forward with a cry and threw
her arms around her husband's neck.
Oh, save him" she cried. "Don't be
hard on him, Mr. Roberts. Let me keep my
husband. Louie, speak for yourself. , You
drank too much wine, or you would never
have come to this."
Louis aiid not a word, but the tears ran
down his face, while hii hysterical wife was
led away. He was held in $d00 bail to the
criminal court.
GRIEVANCES OF THE ALEUTS.
A State of AfTairs That Call fnr Very
rroutpt and Kflfocttve Remedy.
New Yokk, Dee, 5, The Sun devotes half
of its first page to a recital of tbe wrongs of
the helpless Aleuts of Alaska, uo it is
claimed, are at the mercy of tbe agents
of tbe monopoly known as tbe Alaska Com
mercial company, which company, under its
lease from the government ot tbe United
Kuites, controls a large part of tbe coasts and
islands of that territory.
The facts recited by The Sun show a shock
ing state of affairs. The wives and daugh
ters of the natives of Alaska, it is claimed,
are corrupted by tbe commercial company's
agents, many of whom are unprincipled
drunkards; chiefs and priests are bribed
by these agents and tha natives kept in
a constant state of terrorism. Government
officials who endeavor to stop the scandal
ous practices of the agents are persecuted so
that they are glad to desist. Ins uatives
