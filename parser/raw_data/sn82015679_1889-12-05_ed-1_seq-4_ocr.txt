Natural Gas In Indiana.
A representative of tho Journal is now
making a tour of the natural-gas district
of this State, collecting facts and figures
showing the effect of the new fuel in tho
development of business and manufactur
ing in cities and towns located at the
sources of supply. It is intended to cover
the entire field, and tho effort will be to
treat all with exact fairness. The first of
these letters, which will iuclnde a brief
history of tho discovery of gas in Indiana,
and tho benefits derived therefrom by
Muncie and Anderson, will bo printed in
the Journal of Saturda3 Dec. 7. Agents
in those two cities and in other towns in
eastern Indiana who desire extra copies of
Saturday's issue are requested to send in
their orders at once.
The last administration is likely to bo
known in history as one of "inactive ac
counts." There is no phrase in President liar-
rison's message like "innocuous desue
tude." General Harrison is cot a phraao
maker. Seckltaky Wisdom, has tried the
Treasury Department both ways, and he
likes it very much better the civil-service
"way. -
Visitors to the Farmers and Labor
ers conventionin St. . Louis this week
have the privilege of "seeing the wheels
go round." A great number of "wheels"
arc there.
The national banks jvhich, by the
gTace of Grover Cleveland's administra
tion, carried "inactive accounts," will
soon see them pass into "innocuous
desuetude." -
"The New York World," says an ex
change, "is fighting for decency in its
own party." A3 its own party is the
Democratic party, tho World has an im
mense fight on its hands.
A lkt of the national banks which
carried "inactive accounts" .during the
Cleveland administration would ruako
interesting reading. No doubt the of-v
fleers and managing directors were pil
lars in the Democratic church.
"Weak and egotistical" is tho com
ment of tho Sentinel upon tho Presi
dent's message, and yet he has hot used
the pronoun of the first person a half
dozen times, while the Sentinel's ideal,
Mr. Cleveland,, made it do special duty.
Secretary Noble calls upon Con
gress to make a law which will prevent
those who have been dishonorably dis
charged from the service from obtain
ing pensions. Patriotic people, and vet
erans particularly, will express them
eelVes by a loud amen.
The "inactive account" business seems
to have been a conspicuous feature of
the ClevelAnd administration. Think of
piling up $01,921,291 of government de
posits in national banks when $20,000,000
would more than cover tho business
needs of the government.
Much talk is made about tho enforce
ment of the anti-trust, nnti-grain-gam-blinglaw
in Missouri, but it is noticed
that grain futures continue to bo sold in
the wheat-pit of the St. Louis Exchange
far in excess of the real article in sight
or in tho hands of the growers.
That wos a happy coinage by Treas
ury officials when they applied the term
"inactive accounts" to the big govern
ment balances in national banks where
there was no uso lor them. They were
not only inactive, but n gift to the banks
at the expense of public interests.
The Chicago Inter Ocean maintains
that inquiry into the character of an ap
plicant for government employment is
not allowed by tho civil-service law.
Doubtless those who framed the law as
sumed that an applicant would bo re
quired to establish his good character
before being examined.
Very naturally the Democratic press,
which realizes that its party has no hope
of success in this country unless elections
in the South are farces and outrages, is
very abusive of the President because
he urges the passage of a law which will
insure a free ballot and an honest count
for members of Congress. The galled
jade winces.
As the "ruction" iu the Hoard of Coun
ty Commissioners is simply a Demo
cratic quarrel, it is not likely to result
in any public good; but it in gratifying
to see even a slight ripple iu tho meth
ods and management of the board. Con
ducted as a close corporation and politi
cal machine, its large discretionary pow-
ers have been exercised very arbitrarily
in the interests of the Democratic party.
If the inside history of the board during
the list few years could be written it
would make very interesting reading
for the public. Tho board is largely a
law unto itself, subject to the advice and
consent of Democratic caucuses.
THE TREA3UBY HES0RT.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury covers the entire field of na
tional finances, and is unusually impor
tant and interesting. ,Asido from the
customary figures and tables showing
he receipts and expenditures of the gov
ernment, his discussion of the tariff, tax
and silver questions are of special inter
est and will attract general attention.
.Mr. Windom's experience as a financier
and his large acquaintance with the
practical details of government finances
will give great weight to his statements
and recommendations. In the main his
views and recommendations accord with
those contained in the President's mes
sage. The Secretary deprecates the accumu
lation of a surplus beyond the legiti
mate needs of tho government, and
recommends measures for its reduction
and profitable employment. The reduc
tion can be accomplished by a judicious
revision of tho tariff, and, if thought ad
visable, by a repeal of the tax on tobac
co. But the 'Journal is of the opinion
that if Congress is wise enough to adopt
'i policy of national development on tho
lines suggested by tho President there
will be no room for a material reduction
of revenue in any direction. A revision
of the tariff on the lines suggested by"
the Secretary would eflect all needed re
duction and still preserve the essence of
protection. His discussion of the tariff
question is not long, but it disposes in
few words and very effectively, of the
two Democratic hobbies of "horizontal
reduction" and "tariil for revenue only."
There will be no legislation of that kind
under this administration. The Secre
tary's plan of revising the tariff is:
First By reduction in rates of duty
upon those articles which, by reason of in
considerate legislation, or changes which
have occurred in the development of out in
dustries are found to bo excessive.
Second liy iucrease in rates upon articles
which have not been successfully produced
hero, because not adequately protected.
Third Bv transferring to the free list ar
ticles which, from climatic or other causes,
are not and cannot bo successfully;, pro
duced here: also, articles which, under, ex
isting conditions, wo cannot economically
produce in sufficient quantities to meet the
needs of our people, or to serve tbe purpose
of competition with foreign productions,
and articles the production of which is of
inconsiderable importance. 1
These suggestions are in tho lino of
true tariff reform.
Tho silver question is discussed at
considerable length, and in all its as
pects. No previous Secretary of the
Treasury has presented it so fully or
so ably. It is a question of vast impor
tance, and demands careful and consid
erate treatment in the light of the best
financial authority, and irrespective of
partisan politics. This is a silver-producing
country, and we should endeavor
to utilize silver in our monetary system
to the best possible advantage and in
the greatest possible amount consistent
with the public welfare. But care must
be taken not to banish gold, and, as the
Secretary well says, the question is how
to utilize both. He recommends the
issuing of treasury notes against de
posits of silver bullion at the market
prico of silver when deposited, such
notes to be payable on demand in silver
bullion or in gold, at the option of the
government, or in silver dollars, at the
option of tho holder; tho compulsory
feature of the present coinage act to be
repealed.
The policy of the last administration
in piling up government deposits in the
national banks i3 condemned in the
strongest terms. Tho Journal has re
ferred to this subject several times, and
has stated on the authority of the last
report of the Secretary of tho Treasury
that the government deposits during the
last year of Cleveland's administration
were $54,913,480. This was tho balance
on tho 1st of July, 1883, but it seems
even these enormous figures do not rep
resent high-water mark. Secretary
Windom says that on tho 1st of April,
1888, they were $61,921,294. This shows
gross favoritism and a reckless disregard-of
the laws of business. Tho Sec
retary has already put in operation a
plan to reduce tho deposits to a normal
figure. They have already been re
duced to $47,493,479, and will bo called
in by installments until a point Is
reached commensurate with tho needs
of tho government. This bank deposit
business is a very disgraceful feature of
the Cleveland administration, and well
deserves the severe censure passed upon
it by President Harrison and his Secre
tary of the Treasury.
Other important features of the Secre
tary's report will challenge public at
tention and call for further discussion.
THE NEW ASSOCIATE JUSTICE.
The appointment of David J. Brewer
to bo Associate Justice of tho Supreme
Court is something of a surprise, simply
because his name has not been promi
nently mentioned as among the aspi
rants or those suggested for the posi
tion. His name was mentioned by
several papers in his circuit, where his
fitness is recognized. Those who know
best, do not hesitate to describe the ap
pointment as one eminently fit to be
made. Ho was a justice of the Supreme
Court of Kansas before he became Judge
of the Eighth circuit, and is recognized
as a man learned in the law, possessing
a judicial mind, aud being an untiring
worker. No circuit judge has in recent
years been called upon to make more de
cisions of important cases, and his opin
ions have been recognized by lawyers as
those of a man whose knowledge of the
principles of law and whose jmlicial
grasp entitle them to the highest re
spect. One of the most exhaustive of
his recent decisions was that on a peti
tion for an injunction to restrain tho
Railroad Commissioners of Iowa from
fixing rates of transportation. In that
decision ho affirmed the power of tho
State to regulate railroad tariff's, but
held that these officers must make such
rates as would not impair the value of
tho railroads. Tho opinion was com
mented on widely, and very Kcnerally
obtained by tho ablest papers of tho
country. As regards location, tho selec
tion is proper, since no occupaut of tho
Supreme Bench resides in that locality.
The selection is warranted on the ground
of tho familiarity of Judge Brewer with
land grants, mining regulations and
railroad law. He is fifty-two years of
age, and when he takes his seat on the
bench will meet as an associate oneof his
uncles, Justice Field of California.
No Democratic ward club in any of
the larger cities of the country is truly
great until it has elected Grover Cleve
land as . an honorary member and re
ceived an autograph letter from tho
Democratic chief in acceptance of tho
honor. Tho Indianapolis Hendricks
Club has not yet made him a member,
but in this case it matters less, because
even tho possession of a framed Cleve
land autograph would not make tho
Hendricks Club great.
There is such a thing as honest parti
sanship and genuine difference of polit
ical opinion and principle; there are also
a malignant antagonism and narrow
minded hatred of party opponents that
6erve only to bring into public contempt
and ridicule tho persons or papers ex
pressing such feelings. The State organ
of the Indiana Democracy possesses only
tho latter characteristics, as its criti
cisms on the Presidents message plainly
show.
Russia, Germany and even England
have a bad habit of sending editors' to
jail when they express their opinions too
freely and honestly. In this fact lies
very largely the cause of the inferiority
of tho average European newspaper as
compared with its American contempo
rary. Entire freedom of opinion is es
sential to the highest development of
newspaper enterprise.
Speaking of the President's message,
tho Democratic Post-Dispatch of St.
Louis, says, grumblingly: "Not a word
is said about the protection of the de
pendent white man at the ballot-box.
This is a little misty, but perhaps the
Dispatch refers to that largo class of
Democratic gentlemen whose votes in
Indiana are currently rated at $2 each.
In discussing tho question of govern
ment deposits in national banks the
Journal has stated that during the last
year of the Cleveland administration
they jumped from $19,190,070 to $.1,
903,189. It seems even these figures do
not show the worst. According to Sec
retary Windom's report tho deposits on
April 1, 1888, were $01,921,294.
i
About tho most humorous thing in re
cent political literature is Mr. W. L.
Scott's accusation of editor Dana as "the
defender of trusts and monopolies."
Such sentiments from the"Gradgrind" of
Spring Valley, and' author of the "cor
porate interests" letter found in Mr.
Depew's waste-basket are striking, to
say the least.
General Boynton, one of the oldest
and best-informed Washington corre
spondents, reviews tho strong points of
the President's nfes?age, and says: A11
in all, it comes fully up to tho expecta
tions of Republicans, and is regarded by
them as a document that is a credit to
the party, and one that will strengthen
it."
In the vicinity of New York foxes in their
primitive state are scarce, but the dudes
who ape English customs are' quite numer
ous, and must have a fox-hunt, even if
there is no convenient reynard for that pur
pose. So they have a person start out drag
ging an anise-seed bag, the scent of which
the hounds mistake for the trail of a fox.
Tho other day a club had a hunt, near New
York, or, rather, its members started out
for that purpose, but the pack of hounds
prematurely came upon the anise-seed man,
and the poor wretch was obliged to climb a
tree to escape destruction by the enraged
dogs. Ho was rescued after a time, but at
the next fox-hunt ho will not ho the drag
gcr. It is quite too English for him.
Tiik receipts of the Paris exhibition were
$9,900,000, and tho expenditures $3,300,000.
The receipts, however, were made up very
largely of subsidies, the amount received
from entrance fees, privileges, etc., being
$4,700,000, or a littlo more than half of the
actual expenditures. The most of the ex
penses were met by subsidies. This is an
interesting fact for the residents of the city
which aspires to have tho world's fair in
1892. It means that unless Congress is more
liberal than it has ever been, those who
subscribe to guarantee funds will be obliged
to pay their subscriptions.
When the chaplain invoked the divine
blessing upon the Senate on Monday he
closed his petition with tho Lord's prayer,
and but one Senator, the pious Edmunds
of Vermont, joined in repeating it. Good
people may reject with indignation the
suggestion that the other Senators' voices
were silent because they wero not familiar
with the prayer. The trouble was their
modesty and natural disinclination to be
heard in public.
"Somk days must be dark and dreary,"
but the people down in eastern Pennsyl
vania do not really see the necessity for
having 1?2 rainy days and but eighty-six
cloudless ones in eleven months of the
year, as has been their experience in 1859.
They aro willing to have some rain fall
into their lives, but they don't want a
delude.
The secret of Chaplain Milburn's popn-,
lanty with Congressmen is out. He makes
tho shortest prayers of any one who has
ever officially invoked the throne of
grace in behalf of tho Representatives.
Knowing this, it is no longer necessary to
explain that there was no politics involved
in his election.

The Nashville Christian Advocate says:
"Ex-President Rutherford B. Hayes, as he

A recent rival of George Peabody has

great brewer, who has given 250,000 to the
poor of London and Dublin, to be used in
the erection of artisans dwellings 200.000
for London and T0.000 for Dublin. The
sum has been turned over to trustees, of
whom Lord Kowton is the chief.
Edgar Saltus may be obliged to spend
the winter in the South. He has found re

all.
Travelers have already begun to erect
a monumeut to Lucy Webb Hayes on the
summit of Pike's Peak. Following the

such a size as to testify unmistakably to the
esteem for the noble character of Mrs.
Hayes.

postofiico door, but immediately find their
way to the stamp window again.
Tiik oldest railroad president alive lives
at North Brookficld, Mass., and his name is
Bonum Nye. He is not, however, as many
may suppose, related to "Bill' Nye, the

every administration of the United States
government. Mr. Nye is believed to be the
oldest Mason in tho State, and one of the

The Ladies' Hermitage Association, of
Nashville, Tenn., having procured a charter
from the Legislature, granting to it the
dwelling and tomb of Andrew Jackson, to

object in view, the association has issued a
Eublic appeal for funds, which is indorsed

Speaking of the wife of Secretary Rusk,
a correspondent says: "Mrs. Rusk has tho
bountiful, kindly nature of a Western
woman. Sho is motherly in appearance,
and, like Mrs. Miller, she, has taught her

of her life was tho loss of her youngest
daughter, four years ago, and she cannot
speak of it yet without tear-dimmed eyes.

A statue commemorating a touching
little episode in the life of the late German
Emperor Frederick is about to be erected
at Kaiserslauten. When Frederick was
Crown Prince he visited one of the orphan
asylums of that town. Among the children
was a sickly and sad-faced little boy. Fred
erick noticed him, took him in his arms,
and thereupon agreed to become his god
father. The child, to whom a caress was a
stranger, appeared somewhat frightened at
first, but soon got over his difficult? ana
began to play with the Prince's medals and
decorations. Tbe statue in question will
represent the Prince with a baby in his
arms, and the youngster tugging at his
cordons and crosses.
RAN INTO AN OPEN SWITCH.
Serious Accident to ft Pennsylvania Express
Train Several Persons Badly Hurt,
PiTTsnuRG, Dec. 4. The day express east
on tho Pennsylvania railroad was wrecked
near Greenshurg, Pa., this morning. A
switch had been left open, and the express
ran into a freight train. Both engines were
wrecked and several cars. A dozen persons
are reported to have been more or less in
jured, several, it is believed, fatally. The
names of the injured, as far as learned, are:
M. L. Brown, of Scottdale, engineer, leg
broken, cut on head and injured internally,
will probably die: Elmer Myers, of Adams
burg, fireman, terribly scalded, injuries be
lieved to be fatal; engineer Daly, severely
cut about tho head and body, not danger
ous: George Gray, fireman, badly cut and
bruised.
A number of the passengers on tho day ex
press were slightly injured, but none
seriously. Dr. Kline, of Greensbnrg, Pa.,
was cut and bruised; Samuel Fase. of Phila
delphia, received a deep cut above the
right ear. and George Sager.of Lancaster,
Pa., had his nose broken. Baggage-master
Durkholder, of llarrisburg. Pa., had a nar
row escape. A largo trunk was thrown on
top of him, but he was not seriously hurt.
The collision was terrific. Both engines
were completely wrecked and tbe baggage
car reduced to splinters. Fortunately for
the hundreds of passengers on the express
it was not hurled over the high embank
ment at this point.
GROUND BENEATH THE WHEELS.
Workmen Caught Between Two Traln3 Two
Men Killed and Two Fatally Injured.
Wilkesbarre. Pa., Dec. 4. A shocking
accident occurred at C:S0 o'clock this morn
ing at the Hazel-street crossing of the Jer
sey Central railroad. The labor train
which conveys workmen from this city to
the company's shops at Ashley was due at
the Hazel station, and several hnndrcd
men were assembled waiting for it. A
number of them walked up tbe track a
short distance to meet the train and se
cure good seats. Suddenly a fast freight
from the south approached at a high speed.
The men jumped from the north-bound
track to the southbonnd, when the labor
train rushing around a sharp curve plunged
into their midst. In their scrambling
many were thrown down or against the
two trains. Two men were strucK bv tho
freight and two by the labor train. Benja
min Polsue, aged sixty, instantly killed,
loaves a wife but no children; William
IJrent. aged sixty, body cut in half, leaves
a family of grown children. His wife is
now lying at the point of death from fever.
Steven feteffel, a Folander, aged thirty
years, head crushed and leg cut off. He
was taken to the hospital but will die.
Conrad Ernest, aged thirty years, skull
fractured. His injuries will probably, prove
fatal.
Family Supposed to Have Been Murdered.
Little Rock, Dec. 4. The mysterious
disappearance of an entire, family is report
ed from Yell ivi lie. John Morris, living near
Summerville. Mo., sent his wife and three
children, aged ten, seven and four years,
respectively, under the care of Joseph
Graves, to Jasper, Ark. The party traveled
overland in a wagon, and Graves returned
to .Summcrvillo and reported that he had
left Mrs. Morns aud the children at Jasper.
When Morris himself reached that town he
found that his family had never reached
there. Murder and robbery are suspected.
Three Women Shot by Another.
New York, Dec. 4. Shortlv after noon
to-day Antoinette Feralla, of No. 7 James
street, was shot and instautly killed by
Asunda Buqueto, another Italian woman,
with whom she became involved in a row
over money matters. When a policeman
entered the room he found Antionette
Feralla lying dead on the Moor. Maria
Cerase, the dead woman's mother, was shot
through the left elbow, while her sister,
l'etromella Periso, received a bullet in the
left breast. Asnnda Buqueto was found
under a bed in the room where the shoot
ing occurred

A Remarkable Letter, in Which Incidents of
His Jonraey Are Eloquently TolJ-Guidad
from Disaster by an Unseen Hand.
New York, D. 4. The nerald will to
morrow morning print the following letter
from Stanley, which was secured by its
correspondent at Msuwah, on Nov. CO:
To the Editor of tbe New York Herald:
"Tho Herald correspondent who found ris
during our day's halt at Msuwah, live days
from tbe coast, has made it a point that I
should write to you. I beg you to believe
that I should be most willing to do
so did . 1 know what subject would
bo particularly gratifying to yon, but as
the correspondent cannot suggest a subject
you will perhaps consider that it would be
scarcely fair to expect mo to know matters
your readers would be most in
terested in. I find it then most
convenient to imagine you able to
tell my friends much that I should like to
Raj' to them. First of all, I am in perfect
health, and feel liko a laborer of a Satur
day evening returning home with his
week's work done, his week's wages in his
Socket, and glad that to-morrow is the
abbath.
"Just three years ago, while lecturing in
New England, a message came from under
the sea bidding me hasten and take a com
mission to relieve Emin Pasha at Wadelia,
but as people generally do with faithful
pack-horses, numbers of little trilles, odds
and enas, were piled on over and above the
proper burden. Twenty varions little com
missions were added to the principal one.
each requiring' due care and thought.
Well, looking back over what has been ac
complished, I see no reason for any heart's
discontent. Wo can say wo shirked no
task, and that good will, aided by steady
efi'ort, enabled us to complete every littfo
job as well as circumstances permitted.
"Oyer and above the happy ending of our
appointed duties, we have not been unfor
tunate in geographical discoveries. Tho
Aruwinii is now known from its source to
its bourne. The great Congo forest, cover
ing as large an area as France and the
Iberian peninsula, wo can now certify to be
an absolute fact. Tho Mountains of
the Moon, this time beyond tho
least doubt, have been located,
and Ruwenzori, 'the cloud king.
robed in eternal snow, has been seen and
its llatiks explored and some of its shoul
ders ascended. Mounts Gordon Bennett and
Mackinnon cones being but giant sentries
warding off' tho approach to the inner area
of 'the cloud king.' On the southeast of
the range the connection between Albert
Edward Nyanza and the Albert
Nyanza has been discovered, and the
extent of the former lake is now
known for the first time. Range after
range of mountains has been traversed,
separated by such tracts of pasture land as
would make your cowboys out West mad
with envy. And right under the burning
equator we have fed oiyblack berries and
bilberries, and quenchei our thirst with
crystal water fresh from snow beds. We
have also been able to add nearly six thou
sand square miles of water to Victoria
Nyanza.
"Our naturalist will expatiate upon tho
new species of animals, birds and plants he
has discovered. Our snrgeou will tell what
ho knows of the climate and its amenities.
It will take us all we know how to say
what new store of knowledge has been
gathered from this unexpected field
of discoveries. I always suspected
that in the central regions between
the equatorial lakes something worth see
ing would be found, but I was not prepared
for such a harvest of new facts.
'This has certainly been tho most extra

journeyed. I say . it with all
reverence. It has impelled us whither
it would, effected its own will, but never
theless guided and protected us. What
can you make of this, for instance? On
Aug. 17, 1887, all the officers of the rear
column are united at Yambuya. They
have my letter of instructions before them,
but instead of preparing for tho
morrow's march, to follow our
track, they decide to wait at
Yambuya, which decision initiates the
most awful season any community of men
ever endured in Africa or elsewhere. The
results are that throe-quarters of their
force die of slow poison. Their commander
is murdered and tho second officer dies
soon after of sickness and grief. Another
officer is wasted to a skeleton and.
obliged to return home. A -fourth is sent
to wander aimlessly up and down the
Congo, and the survivor is found m such a
fearful pest-hole that we dare not describe
its horrors.
"On tho same date, 150 miles away, the
officer of the day leads S33 men of the ad
vanced column into the bush, loses
tho path and all consciousness of
his whereabouts, and every step
he takes only leads him further
astray. His people become frantic; his
white companions, vexed and irritated by
the sense of the evil around them, cannot
devise any expedient to relieve him. They
are surrounded by cannibals, and poison
tipped arrows thin their numbers.
"Meantinio, I, in command of the river
column, am anxiously searching up and
down the river in four different directions;
through forests my scouts are seeking for
them, but not until the sixth day was I
euceossful in finding them.
"Taking tho same month and the flame
date in 1888, a year later on Aug. 17, 1 listen
horror-stricken to tho tale of tho
last surviving officer of the rear
column at Banalya, and am told
of nothiiig but death and disaster, dis
aster and death, death and disaster. I
see nothing but horrible forms of men
smitten with disease, bloated, disfigured
and scarred, while the scene in the camp,
infamous for the murder of poor Barttelot,
barely four weeks beferc, is simply sicken
ing. On the same day, GOO miles west of
this camp, Jameson, worn nut with fatigue,
sickness -and sorrow, breathes his last.
"On the next day, Aug. 18, 000 miles east,
Emin Pasha and my .otlicer. Jephson. are
suddenly surrounded by infuriated rebels,
who menace them with loaded
rifles and instant death, but
fortunately they relent, and only
made them prisoners to be delivered to the
Mahdists. Having saved both out of the
jaws of death, we arrive a second time at
Albert nyanza to find Emin Pasha and
Jephson prisoners, in daily expectation of
thefr doom. JepbNon's own letters will de
scribe his anxiety.
"Not until both wero in my camp, and the
Kirrptiau fugitives under our protection,
did I begin to see that I was only carrying
out a higher plan than mine. My own de
higns were constantly frustrated by un
happy circumstances. I endeavored to
steer my course as direct us possible,
but there was an unaccountable inlluence
at the helm. I gave as much good will to
my duties as the strictest honor would com
pel. My faith that the purity of my motive
deserved success was firm, but I ha"io been
conscious that tho issues of every effort
were in other hands.
"Not one otlicer who was with mo will
forget the miseries he has endured, yet
every one that started from his home. de.
tincd to march with the advance column
aud share its wonderful adventures,
is here to-day. safe, sound ami
well, and the Herald correspondent
may interview them to his heart's content.
This is not due to me. Lieutenant Stairs
was pierced with a poisoned arrow like
others, but others died and he lives. Tho
poisoned tip came out from under hi heart
eighteen months after he was pierced.
Jephson was four months a prisoner, with
guards with loaded Titles around him. That
they did not murder him is not due to mc.
"These officers have had to wade through
as many as seventeen streams and broad
expanses of mud aud swamps in a day.
They have endured a sun that scorched
wherever it touched. A multitude
of impediments have milled their
tempers aud harrassed their hours.
They have been maddened with agonies of
fevers; they have lived for months in an
atmosphere that medical authority declared
to bo deadly; they have faced dangers
every day, and their diet has been
all through what legal terfs would
have declared to bo infamous and abomina
ble, and yet they live. This is not due to
te any more than the courage which they
have borne all the time, tempered upon
them by their surroundings, or the cheery
energy which they bestowed to their
work, or the hopeful voices which
rang in the ears of a deafening multitude
of biacks and urged the poor souls on to
their gal. Th vulgar will call it luck.
Unbelievers will caliit chance, but deep
down in each heart remains tJio feeling
that, of verity, there are more things 7n
heaven and earth than are drisinied of in
common philosophy.
"I must be brief. Numbers of scenes
crowd the memory. Could one but eum
them np into a picture, it would have a
grand interest. Tho uncomplaining hero
ism of our dark followers, tho brave
manhood latent in such uncouth disguise,
the tenderness we have seen issuing
from nameless entities, the great love ani
mating the ignoble, the sacrifice made by
tbe unfortunate for one more unfortunate,
the reverence we have noted in barbarians,
who. even as ourselves, were inspired with
nobleness and incentives to duty
of all thort we could speak if wo
would, butT' I leave that to tho
correspondent, who, if he has eves to eo.
will see much for himself, and who, with
his gifts of composition, may present a vciv
taking outline of what has been dono and
is now near ending, thanks bo to God, for
ever and ever. Yours faithfully,
"Henuv M. .Stanley."
OPINIONS OF THE MESSAGE.
Boston Advertiser: The message is a sat
isfactory document, comprehensive in scope,
discreet and conservative in manner cud
tone, and at the same time giving utterance
to positive recommendations of policy on
nearly every prominent question.
Evansville Journal: It is certainly an
able message clear, concise, conclusive.
Its reasoning is sound, especially on con
troverted questions. The opposition will,
of course, criticise it severely, but friends
of the administration can justifv the logic
of the message and stand by its conclusions.
It is a state document entirely worthy its
distinguished author.
Louisville Commercial: The message of
President Harrison, sent to Congress yes
terday, is marked by the clearness of stvlo
and simplicity of expression which char
acterize all of the compositions of that
oiliciaL It is a business-like review of tho
6tate of the Union, with straightforward
and positive recommendations on a number
of important matters.
St. Louis Globe-Democrat: The message
as a whole is a clear, strong and honest
document. On controverted points it is
generally in line with the uroclamation of
principles laid down in tho Republican na
tional platform, and will meet with the fa
vor of the majority of the members of tho
party. Even those who do not agree with
it on partisan questions will concede that
tho utterance is able, vigorous and eaDdid,
and eminently worthv of the exalted office
from which it emanates.
Cincinnati Commercial Gazette: There
is evidence throughout tho Presidents mes
sage of unusual diligence and capacity iu
the study of public affairs of the highest
moment. There never has been a stronger
presentation than tho President makes of
the necessity for tho protection of the col
ored people, or a cloirer aud morw bnincss
P idvocacy of tariil" reform and reduction
o - revenue. Tho message touches an
tii il number of important topics, and is
of at general interest.
New York Tribune: President Harrison's
first message is a plain, candid and entirely
unpretentious review of public attairs. Its
most striking characteristic is an absence
of pretense, exaggeration or rhethorical
llourish, and there is no attempt to cnlargo
upon especial topics for the sake of catch
ing temporary popular applause or partisan
advantage. It has tho tone throughout of
conscientious strength and sincerity, and
of profound conviction that the people will
unwaveringly sustain the national policies
to which they gave approval by their votes
one year ago.
Chicago lnter Ocean: The message has
none of that offensive "my policy,' none of
that affectation of mental superiority to
tko people, which was apparent in the mes
sages of President Cleveland. General Har
rison does not aspire to be "wise above that
which is written' in the platform of tho
party which nominated hjra. ahd which
was read and approved by the people who
elected him. The President's first messago
is a declaration of his intent to do that
which the people elected him to do to-wit,
to carry out a soundly Republican policy.
Madi son Courier: Tho President's mes
sage is a most admirable state paper. It is
candid, precise and bold, and at the eamo
time judicious and prudent. No such able
statement of Republican purpose and policv
has been made in recent times. The Re
publican party stands upon the platform
enunciated, and in co doing completely
fulfills all the promises and pledges of its
declarations of the last presidential cam
paign. The country discovers that Presi
dent Harrison rises to tho occasion, and
fully maintains the unique distinction ho
won during 1883 by his marvelous 6crics of
addresses.
The Democratic Press.
New York Herald: President Harrison's
messago is a plain business document, well
written and making recommendations
strictly in the line of the Republican plat
form. New York World: The leading charac
teristics of the President's messago are its
unhesitating advocacy of centralization
and paternalism in government aud its
blandly unconscious assumption that tho
Republican party is tho Republic. In theso
respects the message is in close conformity
with the attitudeaud tendency of tho party
which made Mr. Harrison President.
Louisville Courier-Journal: Lacking any
adequate grasp of his subjects, tho recom
mendations of the President lack clearness,
directness and effect Tlrey will neither
command respect nor excite opposition.
Tho President's message tvo years ago was
a great 6tate paper: a document which be
camo at once a part of tho literature of au
historical political struggle. The message
yesterday is read by an indifferent people,
and passes at onco to the limbo of "publio
documents." ' -
New York Sun: Tho wearied eye passes
from paragraph to paragraph of geographi
cal, historical and statistical statement
aud platitudinous comment. The message
is amorphous. Long as it is, it might have
been twice as long on the same principle of
construction, and neither more nor less
valuable: or tho wholo of it might have
been left unwritten without the slightest
detriment to tho peace and honor of the
country or the prosperity and security of
the people, and without tho slightest loss
to tno Fifty-first Congress now assembled
for the business of legislation. The mess
ago is a disclosure; and what it discloses is
a President without ideas ant? an adminis
tration without a policy.
Now York Times: It is natural enough
that a mind capable of composing so dull a
message should be incapable ot rightly ap
preciating its own work. As a mere refer
ence index to the public business, the mes
sage may. have some value iu Congress and
newspaper offices, but if it records the
events of tho time, it throws no light
unou them, aud while it refers to acknowl
edged evils, it suggests no proper remedies.
President Harrison's messago must
be accepted as tbe measure of the man.
Ho has already been pretty accurately
measured by tho people of the country, and
by none more accurately than by candid
members of his own party. Even his few
professed admirers will find nothing in this
message to justify any lingering belief
they may have that he has native capacity
or acquired competence to guide tho
national policy with firmness or intelli
gence. Tho policy ho complacently an
nounces and approves is to "let things
drifL"
Canadian Tl ews.
Toronto Empire (Conservative): If is al
together not a sensational message, thonsh
several questions which are treated with
reticence may allord f.cope for much debate
in Congress, and may lead to action not im
mediately forcshado wed.
St. Louis Republic: It is the weakest and
worst messace ever sent to Congress by any
President It fixe& Mr. Jlarricnu's place as
a politician in the lowest ranks and alto
gether deprives him of an' claim to states
manlike views on the great subjects of pub
lic moment now before the country.
Toronto Globe (Liberoll: President Har
rison's annual messago raises no new issues
and throw littlo new light upon current
political questions. Perhaps the most im
portant points as affecting Canadians are
tho intimations that the matters in disputo
relating to tho fisheries are in abeyance, or
in course of amicable adjustment, and that
a new extradition treaty with Great Britain
had been negotiated.
Toronto Mail. (Ind.l: As far as Canadians
are concerned, the most interesting portion
of President Harrison's messagoto Congress
is that relating to the trado policy of his
administration. Tbe Mail recently had oc
casion to tell its readers that this policy
was such as to preclude all Lope during the
present Republican regime of any uch
trade arrangements as havo been fully
discussed in both countries of late.
Tho message bears us out ii this. It i in
fact, little elso than a repetition of the prop
ositiou laid down iu the Kepublieau plat
form adopted at Chicago last year
