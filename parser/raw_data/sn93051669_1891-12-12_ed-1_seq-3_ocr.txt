guarded against in tbe future.
One ut tbe divorce cases in the Benton
county circuit court was that lor the dis
solution of tbe marnage of Mr. and Mrs
John Foster. Tbe marriage occurred
only a few months ago and attracted at
tention on account of tbe bride being 17
and the bridegroom 71. As the groom is
worth probably over $100,000 it is sale to
say there will be a big fagot over it.
A man named Joseph Dolph has been
personating Senator Joseph Dolph, of
Oregon, lu Pittsburg, Penu ,and the fraud

Persons arriving from La Grande state
tbat'tbe authorities of that place, backed
' by a strong public seutimetit, in view of
the recent outrages committed there and
the mysterious disappearance of twn well
known citizens of tbe vicinity, have given
orders and are enforcing them strictly,
requiring all gamblers, tinhorns, hoboes,
aud rounders generally, to leave the town.
The gambling bouses have been closed
and general reformation bas set iu. "
Baker Democrat: On Friday night the
bouse on Thus. Smith's dairy ranch in
Sumpter valley, occupied by a Mr.
jCooley and family, was entirely de -stroyed
by ' fire, together with all tbe
household effects. Tbe fire caught lrom
a defective flue. The loss in household
' effects falls extremely heavy upon Mr.
Cooley who is left entirely without borne
- to shelter bis family and beiog without
money be is turned out upon tbe cold
charity of tbe world.
Long Creek Eagle: The little four-year-old
son of Sam'iel Shields, of Colton-.
- wood, that got badly scalded on Novem
ber 17th, and was brought f Long tree
for treatment, died on the morning of
Nov. 28th. The little fellow was caretul
ly treated by Dr. Lewis of this city, but
all medical assistance was of no -avail.
The funeral services were conducted at
the M. E. church in this city Monday
morning by Rev. L. H. Poell, after
which the burial took place at the cem
etery east of town. The parents have the
sympathy of the entire community.
Port Townsend. Leader: An Oregon
woman has invented a dish-washing ma-'
chine, which she intends exhibiting at
tbe world's fair. It has advantages over
the servant girl, inasmuch as it bas no
Sunday beaux or favored mashes; unlike
the hired boy, t never gets drunk and
neglects to do its work ; ii does not smoke
, opium and cigarettes like the Chinese
dishwitshers.and on the whole has various
' points to commend it to housekeepers,
who have so long suffered from the wor
ries and cares of worthless help. Now,
if somebody will only invent a cook and
a chambermaid this world will seem less
dark and dreary.
' About balf past 10 last night Lee Gab.
a Chinaman, after coming from Doe
Sing's was afsaulted -on the street,
knocked down and robbed of $35. which

Walla Walla Union-Journal: A Tacoma
special reports that Frank VV. .viiddaugh,
who used to be a printer in tbe office of
tbe Union-Journal, but wbo now lives in
. Tacoma, bas secured a caveat on a device
for holding type in a stick which he be
lieves will fully answer the place of the
thumb of the left hand, which is ordina.
rily used for that purpose by typos. He
also has a device for holding tbe stick to
the case, thus leaving the left hand free
to assist the right in placing the type in
tbe stick. By this metuori, he claims he
can set 60 per cent more type than for
merly, when using only one hand. He
conceiyed the idea of using both hands
by watching a country newspaper editor
operate a typewriter, using both hands.
If his method proves a success Mr. Mid
daugh believes there will be no use for
type-setting machines, his method being
' more rapid and less expensive.
' Oregonian: Died, Decern ber 7th, of con
sumption, at St. Mary's Academy, in this
city, Sister Mary Achille, ner. Delia Hous
seau, aged 36 years, 5 months and 14
days. The deceased religious was born
at St. Marline, province of Quebec, and
entered the Sisterhood of the Holy Names
of Jesus and Mary at Montreal, province
of Quebec, but the last sixteen years of
her life were spent in the seryice of her
community In the different convents of
The Dalles, Salem, Seattle and Portland.
Self-abnegation and deyoiedncss make up
the summary of tbe life of this departed
nun; what wonder, then, that wheu death
approached she could look calmly for
ward in the joyful expectancy ot receiv
ing that heavenly inheritance promised
to those who have renounced all to follow
Christ? The funeral service of the de
ceased sister will take pl.tce at St. Mary's
Academy at 5:30 o'clock a. if. on Wednes

the surgeon on No. 7 last evening.
Albany Democrat: The vote yesterday
was the largest ever cast in Albany, though
not by considerable, a complete o e. The
day was very boisterous. A comparison
witb a few previous years will be of inter
est: The vote in 1888 was 475; iu 1889, 611,
a full city ticket being voted for; in 1890,
565, only a marshal . and recorder being

East Washingtonian: E. B. Davis, a prom
inent fanner ot tbis county, met with a
serious accideut Wednesday while at work
at the- tramway on Sn ike river. He was
oiling the cylinder on whicb the cable runs
wheu a w oik man started a car which was
attached to the cable and stunding a snort

a manner as to ciUfh the first three fingers
so that they bad to be amputated. He was
thrown violently to the ground and sus
tained other serious bruises about the head
and shoulders. Dr. Kuykeudall who ren
dered surgical aid says Mr. Davis is getting

W infield S. Parker, chief of police of
Fairhaven, has been missing a week and
rumors are rife of foul play. Telegrams
haye been sent over the state inquiring
about him as a prominent Mason. His wife
has been visiting relatives in Montesano.
Fairhaven councilmtn say he is absent on a
secret mission on leave which expires in a
day or two. Until then there is no need
for anxiety. They aav Parker paid over
$30,000 taxes he had collected the d ly before
he left. A later Hi- pfc'i says: "The city
clerk last night tooted up tbe tax rolls
turned oyer by Parker the day before be
disappeared, and finds that $7723 of taxes
colled are unaccounted for. It is generally
believed here that this has nothing to do
with Parker's disappearance and that when
he returns it will be accounted for."
East Washingtonian: In handling wild
horses, said a man on our streets the other

here to see a lady riding or driving a wild

ment of 320 students.
Miss Maggie .leffers, ot The Dalles, en
tered school last Monday.
Mr. Dan Doyle, ot Ihe Dalles, was in
own last week.
The entertainment given by the socie
ties Nov. 27th was largely attended. Tbe
most important feature was a play, en
titled "The Ulster", in which seventeen
characters appeared.
An electric clock bas been placed in
the college building, by means of whiph
tbe siguais ior tbe change of classes is
struck in the different rooms at the same
time.
John Loyd Thomas, secretary of the

After the Assessors.
Salem Stat sman. .
' Not finding in the assessment rolls as
returned by tbe county assessors tbe in
lormation it requires to act intelligently,
tbe state bosrd of equalization has, pur
suant to a resolution adopted, addressed
letters to several ot tbe assessors ior more
details of tbe mann r in which tbe assess
ment was made in their counties. These
icquests are for such necessary informa
tion as these rolls do not contain. An
examination of tbe rolls is sufficient to
warrant tbe assertion that in many cases
tbe books returned to tbe secretary and
so certified are not duplicates of the rolls
retained by tbe assessors and returned to
the county clerks. For instance, where
the county board made reductions or ad
ditions to the valuations ia the assess
ment of certain persons or firms, the
change is noted no these books only in
the t tal of that assessment. In these
premises, bow is the state board of equal
ization to know in what particular the
county board saw fit to alter the work of
tbe assessor. Again, several counties
fail to enumerate the numb.r of polls.
Five counties ate still unrepresented, but
their tax rolls are looked for every day
now.

Assessors' ffeeleot of Duty.
Evening Telegram.
There ia a law in thia state in reference to
the militia, which has not been carried out
heretofore, but Adjutant-General Mitchell
says he proposes to have it enforced. The
law is to the effect that every county asses
sor shall at the time of making ont bis
assessment roll make out a list of all able
bodied citizens betwen the ages of 18 and
45 years who are subject to military duty,
The county clerk shall forward a copy of
this list to the adjutant-general within
twenty days after it has been corrected,
Circulars haye been sent out to tbe thirty
one county clerks, and so far have been re
plied to by but eighteen, leaving thirteen
yet to be heard from. The clerks of Ost
eon and Sherman counties write that no
such list has ever been made out. If
assessor does not comply with the law he is
liable to a fine of from $300 to $1000, and
the clerk is liatle to a fine of from $200 to
$500. The list is to be forwarded by tbe
adjutant-general of the state to the adju
tant-general of the United States army in
an annual report. The exemptions from
military service are all persona in the army
or navy or volunteer torce oi toe umtea
States, and those who have been honorably
discharged therefrom; those who have al
ready served in tbe state militia and have
. . ... i, .i j
been honorably discharged; all judges and
clerks of the courts, and state and county
treasurers, idiots, drunkards, lunatics, pau
pers, and persons convicted of infamous
crimes.
An Escaped Convict Found,
Salem Statesman.
A telegram in the Statesman yesterday
morning said that the sheriff of Mendocino
county, Calif., arrested Harry Miller, 22
years of age, a son of Joaquin Miller, the
poet of the Sierras," for robbing the stage
aortb of Ukiah on November 15th. Young
Miller has confessed to the crime. He was
a child of -Minnie Myrtle Miller, Joaquin
Millgr's first wife, and in confessing to the
crime of robbing the stage after his arrest,
said he had tried cutting wood for a living,
but, being hard up, decided to rob a stage.
This is the young fellow wbo escaped from
the Oregon state penitentiary on August 14,
1890. With ten other men he was working
at the state reform school. They bad all
been made "trusties" and slept in the barn.
Two guards were over them. On that
Wednesday night eleven men went to bed
and on the next morning but ten got up.
The absent one was Miller, who had shaken
the soil of Oregon's state penitentiary from .
his feet during the witching hours. Search
failed to reveal his whereabouts and this
telegram gave tbe first information of the
young scapegoat since his night. Miller
had been in prison but four months. He
was serving a two years' term for larceny
and had been sentenced from Portland. He
will be returned to Salem to complete his
term for Oregon before being tried for stage
robbery.
The Northern to Get the Hunt Jane.
It has been the general opinion since C.
B. Wright became owner of the Hunt line
the system would sooner or later become i
part of the Northern Pacific. If the tol
lowing from the Tacoma Ledger of Novem
ber 23 I be true the amalgamation is about
to take place. It eaya:
Arrangements are said to have been al
most oompleted for the transfer of the old
Oregon & Washington Territory railroad in
Eastern Washington and Oregon, better
known as the Hunt system, to the Northern
Pacific railroad, to be made about tbe first
of the new year. C. B. Wright, ot Phi la
delphia.who purchased the Oregon & Wash
ington Territory last spring, has undoubt
edly come to an agreement with the North
ern Pacific, as has been reported in regard
to the tiaosfer of tbe road. Tbe Northern
Pacific com pany will receive the entire cap
ital stock of the Hunt system for . gnaran
teeing the principal and 6 per cent, interest
on the bonds that will be issued at the rate
of $25,000 per mile. Mr. Wright will take
the bonds in payment, so that the Northern
Pacific will not be called upon to pay out
any cost at all. Tbis statement is made
upon authority oi an official of tbe road,
who was seen in reference to the matter.

for yars we have been selling Dr. King's
New Discovery lor Consumption, Dr.

We do not hesitate to guarantee them
every time, and we stand ready to refund

The Day la Congress
Washington, Dec. 10. Among tbe
documents laid beforo the senate and re
ferred were tbe annaal report of tbe
secretary of the treasury and many mem
orials asking legislation for closing tbe
world's fair Sundays.
Among the bills introduced and
referred were tbe following:
To prevent food adulterations; to pro
vide for a better enlorcement of the
quarantine laws; and. to establish a na
tional board of health.
By Stewart To provide for the free
coinage of gold and silver bullion. Tbis
bill was laid on tbe table, so Stewart can
call it up at any time; to authorize tbe
sale of mineral lands to aliens; to
authorize the construction of a railroad
In Alaska; to amend the Chinese exclusion
act; to transier the revenue cutter service
to tbe ntvy department; to punish ac
ollicer for summoning jurors with refer
euce to their political or religious affairs.
By Cutlom To suspend the corring of
Chinese laborers to the United States; to
reduce letter postage to 1 cent; providing
for consular certificates for immigrants;
for badges for officers and men of tbe
Greely expedition; lor annual leave of ab
sence to per-diem employes of tbe navy
department ; providing for the income tax

summonry cancellation of pension certif
icates, and to provide for a hearing in
such cases; to establish postal savings

revise tbe patent law.
What They Think or tne nesaace.
London. Dec. 10. Tbe St. James Ga
zette, commenting to day on President
Harrison's message, says: The most im
portant point in tbe document is that
part which bas reference to the result of
the McKinley tariff. The figures pre-
seuted, the Gazette declares, compare
significantly witb British figures, which
remain stationary. Tbe calculations of
tbe supporters of tbe McKinley bill are
working out much better than any.one in
Englapd had reason to expect.
Tbe Globe sarcastically comments on
the message, whicb, it says, is adroitly
traced to catch tbe voieilines. Tbe nerv
ous Yankees are assured tbe government
knows bow to climb down, as in tbe case
of Chili and tbe Behring sea dispute.
Lord Salisbury, the Globe adds, need not
be much frightened at President Harri
son's tremendous menace, and tbe ex
pression of concern at foreign encroach
ment upon territories coutroled by tbe
American government. The Globe dis
putes tbe statement made iu tbe message
that the prosperity of the Uuiled states is
entirely due to the McKinley bill. On
the contrary, it says the prosperity of tbe
country is due to the exceptional harvest
there at a time when Europe is short of
grain.
A Hew Ocean Cable.
San Francisco, Dec 10. Advices re
ceived from Honolulu last evening an
nounce the arrival there, November 25, of
tbe United States steamer Albatross, after
making a survey irom tbis port to Hawaii
for tbe proposed cable. Lieutenant Tan
ner, in command of the Albatross, stated
to a reporter in Honolulu that there was
no reason. In hi opinion, why tbe cable
could not be laid. There would be
several difficulties to overcome, but only
such as are usual in laying deep sea
cables. Tbe greatest depth reached was
3100 fathoms, tbe average depth being
aoout zouu latooms. About 250 sound
ings were taken on the way, the last one
being off Diamond Head where a depth
of 350 fathoms was found. The vessel
took a great circle course in going down
and will make another survey in coming
up.takiDg a straight course a plambline,
as it is nautically termed. After leaving
Honolulu tbe Albatross will cruise around
tbe islands to determine the best point
tor landing tbe cable.
