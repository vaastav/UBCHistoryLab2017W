President! Menace Not Expected to
Clarify the Situation, is Wash

SLOAN OPPOSES. HITCHCOCK FOE
Nebraska
x
Nebraska
From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. (Special
Telegram . ) President Wilson's
message will not solidify the demo
crats of the nation, as It undoubt
edly was Intended to do, but will
rather, tend to divide the democracy
Into two hostile camps. This, in a
nutshell, is the situation in Washing
ton, according to one of the keenest
and most farseelng democrats, as he
expressed himself in good round
English at the capitol today.
Representative Solan, vvho Is a pretljr
keen observer and quite alive to the value
of Impressions, mid tiiat all of President
Wilson's messages have been rhetorically
valuable, but th:it In his Judgment the.
message "of today fell far below any for
mer effort, both In Its delivery and lt
reception by conaress.
o Baals for Increase.
"Tho full basis for the sudden and Im
mediate demand." said Mr. Sloan, "for
such a large Increase In the army and
navy was disappointingly not revealed.
"Tho piopcsltlon to pay as we no ap
peals to me, although the method of
paytnrnt I cannot endorse. The proposi
tion to tax smaller Incomes, gasoline,
automobiles, bank checks, to pay for
preparedness, while leaving the products
of the northwest on the fre lift, thereby
losing many millions of revenue and fos
tering the competition of water rates of
our competitors, with our higher railroad
rates, paid by farmers, should not appeal
to our section of the country.
"Reasonable duties collected on farm
products or the lat two years and dur
ing the next five would mbet a reason
able increase of cost for reasonable pre
paredness." Hitchcock Complimentary.
In strong contrast with these views of
Bpresentaflve Sloan, Senator Hitchcock
was generally most complimentary of the
tone of the message, believing It took
high ground and was worthy of being
followed. The senator, however, is un
compromising in his belief that the gov
ernment should make its own munttlona
of war, rather than let private corpor
ations do the manufacturing.
Upon the proposition of "paying as we
go," Senator Hitchcock heartily endorsed
the president's position and came out
strongly for his scheme of raising
revenues by a sur-tax. He thought the
country generally would endorse the
president's attitude upon all the big ques
tions now before It.
."The president's message Is most ad
mirable," said Representative Stephens,
"but I am opposed to the feature of a
continental army. I believe in aiding the
State militia. As to the navy Increases
suggested by the president I have serious
doubts if I can go with him the whole
length of the proposed program. I am in
favor of a reasonable increase in tho
Davy with special reference to submarines
and aeroplanes. I am especially in favor
of the president's message with reference
to the merchant marine as a part of the
liavy" establishment:" --'---- r ..
Resalt of Primaries. ,
As a result'of pOetofftce primaries Mr.
Stephens today recommended the follow
ing: Bancroft. Xander Zuhlke; Clear-'
water. Charles Payne; Oakland, Oscar P.
Swanson; Oakdale, Kred W. Shlvely:
Randolph, Anton B. Helms.
The president today sent to the senate
the names of John C. Morrow of Scott'a
Blutf for receiver and Thomas J. O'Keefe
of Alliance for register of the land office
at Alliance.
Senator Hitchcock today Introduced the
Philippine bill as the committee of which
he Is chairman reported. He also re
Introduced his embargo bill which at
tracted no end of attention during the
last congress.
