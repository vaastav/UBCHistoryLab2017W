Where We Are At ,,
President Wilson in his annual
message to congress, seems to
realize that he has gone to the
limit in legislation affecting big
business. He practically says
legislation along such lines has
brought to a standstill the big
business enterprises of the coun
try and nothing more will be
done, unless they are able to sur
vive the shock he has given
them. Jtl the legislation was
had .under the direct orders of
the president to congress. The
recent election somewhat opened
his eyes. The stagnation of bus
iness along industrial and trans
portation lines is the direct result
of drastic legislation. No one
was able to know when they put
their money into any railroad or
other corporation whether they
were getting into the toils of the
criminal law or- not. Hence they
have held aloof, and we now find
the railroads unable to get money
tn improve their properties, and
many have or will go into the
hands of receivers. Already they
have advanced the freight rates,
and . the commissioners permit
the same because the business
does not show a profit sufficient
to keep up incidental expenses.
Because of the stagnation in the
manufacturing business brought
about by the reduction of the
tariff and the laws against com
binations of capital, the business
of the ; railroads are seriously
lessened. i -
The demands on us from the
warring world, should increase
all the productive industries of
the country, which ' may save a
general collapse of business.
Under normal conditions . the
whole fabric of American busi
ness would be bankrupt. Had
no drastic legislation been enact
ed, . this government would be
enjoying a state of prosperity
unknown heretofore. With the
world wanting what we have at
our own pi ice, save and except
cotton, we should be in a golden
age. ..When capital is crippled
the poor go hungry and the labor
ing man hunts the soud house.

Try This For Neuralgia
Thousands of people keep on suffer
ing with neuralgia because they do
not knowwhat to do for it. Neural
gia is a pain in the nerves. What
you want to do is to soothe the nerve
itself. Apply Sloan's Liniment to the
surface over the painful part do not
rub it in. Sloan's Liniment penetrates
very quickly to the sore, irritated
nerve and allays the inilamation. Get
a bottle of Sloan's Liniment for 25
cents of any druggist and have it in
he houseagainst colds, sore and
swollen joints, lumbago, sciatica and
like ailments. Your money back if
not satisfied, but it does give almost
instant relief. adv
. ' Gravelhill, Tenn.. 12, 15, '14.
The Gravelhill Road Improvement
Society, at a meeting attended by
about fifty of our ' leading citizens,
unanimously adopted a resolution to
ask the Quarterly Court at its session
First Monday in January, to call for
an election to vote on the issuance of
$25,000 for the purpose of grading
and culverting all principal roads in
McNairy county. - '
, There are between 300 and 350
miles of public roads in the county,
and any public road is, proportionate
ly, as important as another, and each
community has as much right to im
provements as the other.
It will be remembered that in De
cember, 1913, the people of Gravel
hill decided that they could hardly
afford to put up longer with the con
ditions of our roads, since they were
almost impassable, so they met and
organized themselves and decided to
grade the main public road from Sel
mer to the state line near Corinth,
Miss., since this road was of prime
importance in marketing our crops
The good people of both Selmer and
Corinth lent a helping hand and with
our own private means and work the
road 15 miles distant is nearly com
plete. We found that from $35 to
$50 per mile will grade our roads by
contract. 300 miles at $50 would
cost $15,000, but culverts and some
levee work, ditches, etc., would ag
gregate some expense, together with
dynamite.
We had at our meeting recently,
magistrates, road commissioners and
1 trge land owners and all are unan
imously in favor of taking the matter
up at once, since by so doing the
work of grading, if done, can be done

in connection with the regular road
time next spring, lessening the con
tract cost, or result in the saving of
our road time to be applied in drag
ging, putting in culverts, etc., after
grading has been done.
There is no use to be discouraged
with the recent vote on the $100,
000 bond proposition, because it is
not a practical proposition to gravel
our roads, the cost of which would
not justify us. '
A graded road well kept is & four
to six ton road any way, and that is
as heavy is likely to be hauled. .
Let everybody fall into line since
the bonds can be duly paid out of our

Why the Youth's Companion Should be
in Every Family
"If I could take only one paper",
said the late Mr. Justice Brewer of
the Supreme Court, "it would be the
Youth's Companion a little of every
thing in a nutshell, and unbiased."
The Companion is a family paper in
the completest sense. ' It provides
reading that, without failing to inter
est thj young, stiil interests the ma
ture. It unites young and old through
their common enjoyment of delightful
fiction, agreeable rtiiacellany, and the
clear exposition of public questions.
So carefully is it edited, so varied
are its contents, that it would easily
supply a family with "entertaining
fiction, up-to-date information an 1
wholesome fun, if no other periodical
entered the house. . "
