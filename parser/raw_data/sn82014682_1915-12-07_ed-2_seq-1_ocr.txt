"They, simply have to continue the
s.ugar .tariflL. That seemed to be the
general opinion and the opinion of a
limited number of Congressmen whom
I met" : ' ' . " i .
Asked If there was. any danger of
action being delayed through an open
ing wide of tariff legislation, Mr. Ten
ney axiswered: . i
"Some people have exprrssed a feat
along these lines, and I should think
that there might be danger of that
If the president, however Is abjelto

that undesirable result will probably
be prevented. ;, '. - -

tioned on the general situation of the
Industry, ."After the Cuban crov comes

and the only thing holding it back
from market Is carrying ' tonnage.
They are now paying 40 cents a hun

Referring to - the new contracts,
whereby the. quota of Hawaiian sugar
that formerly went to the American
is now divided equally with the Penn
sylvania and the National ' refining
companies. Mr. ,Tenney said, that at
least zzo.ooo tons or the new crop
would go to the Pacific coast. This
year the coast refinery of the Hawaii
an planters took 250.000 tons.

the subject of the projected new
steamship of . the Matson Navigation
Company. Mr., Tenney first made, the
curious revelation, that, on one inter
efiting item, he was behind the news
published here. For the first time he
heard that the name of the floating
palace was going to be "Maklki." .
"It Is the first I have heard of
MakikL- he said with a smile. "How
ever, she is to be built by the Union
ron Works of San Francisco and of
the same dimensions as the Matsonia.
She will probably carry the same num
ber of passengers as the Matsonia and
have . similar arrangements. '
"Some minor improvements will be
made where they have been shown to
be necessary. She will be a twin-screw
steamer operated by Westlnghouse
arsons geared turbine engines and.
of course, an oil-burner. . The Matsonia
is a single-screw boat with recipro
cating "engines. The new vessel will
have more power and -be faster than
the Matsonia.- She will be completed
some time early in 1917 but we can
not tell defintlely. v ..
In ' reply to a question on the oil
situation, with reference to the re

the Taft withdrawal orders, Mr. Ten

court, came In for a share of criticism
in he affidavit which Circuit Judge
T. 0. Stuart recently forwarded to
Attorney General Gregory in Wash

authoritative source today.
In just what manner Judge Whitney
was criticized Is not definitely known,
as Judge Stuart has refused to make
public the affidavit It is understood,
however, - that the chief complaint
made against Judge Whitney by the
third judge Is that the former stood
by the decision of the supreme 'court
when the trouble arose regarding the
connection of C D. Pringle with Judge
Stuart's court in the capacity of clerk,
and which resulted In Pringle taking

United States' has essayed to discharge its duty as a' neutral in the.
troublous war-time. . The president , declared that the country has
remained neutral because it has no special interest in the causes which,
moved the European powers to war. ' y- ' " T - ; ' . 1 v r ,
- ' It is the duty of. the nations of the western hemisphere to pre
vent the collective economic ruin of these great countries straining in"
combat,' he said. ;, ' ' '
, Referring rather briefly but succinctly to the 'administration's'
Mexican policy, he said that the attitude of the United States toward.!
Mexico has demonstrated "that we have no selfish interest either in
Central or, South America.M :
' "The day of guardianship," he continued, ."has been replaced
by a full honorable association of partners whose interest is that of
solicitude for the welfare of all the Americas." ; V ' ' - . ' -
- Turning to the matter of assuring peace for the United States
and preparing to resist foreign aggression, he said :
- V'lThe passion of the American people is for peace. , War is re
garded by us merely as a means of associating our. strengths and
asserting our rights against aggression. But war is not a mere mat
ter of men and arms. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively at
the call of a sudden summons, we must know how modern fighting i
done." ,: . .'":'.''' rh.-t -T - . : : "- '

in a day but that an orderly and far-seeing policy must be developed

In this connection, the president presented the plans of the war
department for increasing the standing army to 141,843 men, with a .
supplementary force of 400,000, this later force to be. developed by
undergoing short training periods for three years of a six gears' en
listment. ' 1 : ' ;'v; --' ; ' ' - "' . ' .w .
His reference to the development of the navy was less detailed.
He said that the plans for naval preparedness involve only the short
ening of the time within which plans long, matured shall be carried
out. He dwelt briefly on the necessity for navy expansion.
The president said that the war department's plan for strength
ening the army is "an essential first step'.' and "for the present stif-.
ficient," and depends upon the patriotism of the younger men and
employers. It is to the advantage of the country, he pointed out,' to
adopt a comprehensive plan (o put the navy upon a final footing bf
strength' and efficiency, and press that plan to completion within
five years.1;."' .;. ; :' ' "'".'-

should be raised by internal taxation. . Enlarging upon this he recom
