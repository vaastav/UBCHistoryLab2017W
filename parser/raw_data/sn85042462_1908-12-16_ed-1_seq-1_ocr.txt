in The Herald's Christmas dinner and
entertainment for poor children to be
held at the Y. M. C. A. building and at
Simpson auditorium on the afternoon
fit December 25 have their hands full.
There la BO much to do that volun
teers can be used to advantage if they
will send their names, addresses, tele
phone numbers and preferred! work to
the Santa Claus editor of The Herald.
Much of the cost of the dinner will be
borne through voluntary gifts of labor
and supplies, but to feed 3000 children
is a labor of expense as well as of love,
and the malls must bring In baskatsfui
of checks before the entire army can be
properly taken care of.
Children are registering daily at The
Herald's supply depot, 323 South Hill
street, the old office of the Wright-Cal
lender company. All prospective guests
should come in person or send their
parents to fill out the blanks which call
for the name, age, addres and school
of applicants; also the name of a refer
ence if possible.
Children, .in writing to the Santa
■ dims editor, should be careful to sign
their names, ages and addresses. These
are often overlooked by writers, and
the letttrs cannot be filed by Santa If
he has no clew to the writers.
Confederacy Daughters
Robert K. Lee chapter, Daughters of
the Confederacy, is taking a conspicu
ous part in the Christmas dinner
through the volunteer work of its mem
bers who have for two weeks worked
diligently stirring up the generous im
pulses of the people in behalf of the
poor children. The committees have
also had personal interviews with the
officers of several women's clubs and
urged active participation In the grand
work of looking after the young peo
ple's happiness on the day of days.
Much benevolent work has been done
by the chapter for years in its quiet
way.
The staff of employes of the C. M.
■ Staub Shoe company, at Broadway and
Third street, has from the start taken
a deep Interest in the Christmas dinner
and entertainment. As soon as the
work was well under way a subscrip
tion list was started among the em
ployes, with the result that $16.25 was
raised In a little while.
As most of those who signed have
many relatives and friends to be re
membered with gifts the many re
cipients of this kindness will gratefully,
though silently, thank the donors.

fTTASHINGTO^, Dec. 15.— Repeated
11 peals at laughter greeted the

As the secretary read the statement
thai the charges were "false in every

There was only a small number of

being read at all.
The message elicited the greatest in

Many of these documents wero in

There was nothing which showed di

$40,000,000 paid by the United states.
DUt there was in. hided the names ol

There was not the name of a citizen

Message from President ,
President Roosevelt's statement to the sen
ate concerning the purchase of the Panama
canal property by th. United States denounces
In strong language the charges that there «a»
anything wrong in th« acquisition by the
United States of the canal property. ht
•■These stories," he says, "were first brought
to m,"attention as published In a P«P« In
Indianapolis called the New., edited by Mr
Delavan Smith. The stories were scurrilous
and libelous In character and falsa m every
Pa"M? Ulßmlth ihelten, hlniwJf behind .the, ex
cuse that he merely accepted tho statements
which had appeared In a paper published In
New York—the World, owned by Joseph Pu
'"»?''to idle to my that the "'" character
of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are such
that the statements In that paper will not be
believed by anybody; but unfortunately thou
sands of persons are 111-informed In this re
spect, and believe the statements they see
printed, even though they appear In a news
paper published*!- Mr. Pulitzer.'
Summarizing the charges made in this con
nection, the president Bays:  \,
Charges Summarized^
"These statements sometimes appeared in the
editorials, sometimes in the news columns,
sometimes in the shape of contributions by In
dividuals, either known or unknown to be of
bad character. . .
•They am false in every particular, from be
ginning to end. The wickedness of the slan
ders is only surpassed by their falsity.
"Bo utterly baseless are the stories that ap
parentyl they represent In part merely material
collected for campaign purposes and In part
are stories originally concocted with a view
of positive blackmail. . „*. ■ r,
"The inventor of the story about Charles P.
Taft, for Instance, evidently supposed that at
some period of the Panama purchase W. It.
Taft was secretary of war, whereas In reality
W H. Taft never became secretary of war
until long after the wholo transaction in ques
tion had been closen.
"Tho inventor of the story about Douglas
Robinson had not taken the trouble to find out
the fact that Mr. Robinson had not had the
slightest connection, directly or indirectly, of
any kind or sort, with any phase of the Pana
ma transaction, from beginning to end.
"The men who attacked Mr. Root had not
taken the trouble to read the public documents
which would have Informed them that Mr.
Root had nothing to do with the purchase,
which was arranged entirely through the de
partment of Justice, under the (then) attorney
general, Mr. Knox.
• Investigation Unnecessary
"N'oiv, as a matter of fact, these itoriaa need
no investigation whatever. No shadow <>i proof
has been, or can be, produced in beniiir nr
any of them. They consist mainly of a string
of Infamous libels.
'■In form they hi- libels paillv on Individu
als—On Mr. Taft and Mr. Robinson, for In
stance—but In fact they me wholly and In
form partly a libel on tha United Btatol gov
ernment.
"I do not believe we should concern sul
selves with ti"- particular Indlvlduale, who
wrote the lylnu and Übeloua editorials, articles
from correspondents or articles in the Bewi
•■The real offender is Joseph Pulitzer, editor
and proprietor of. the World, While the crim
inal offense ol whloh Mr. Pulltser has )ieen
guilty Is in form a I It* I on Individuals, the l
great injury done is In blackening the Rood
namo of the American people.
"It should not bo left tv a private citizen to
sue Mr Pulitzer for libel. He should be
proseeuftd for libel by the governmental au
thorities.
"In point of encourag-ment of Iniquity, in
point of infamy, of wrong doing, there is I
nothing t" ohoose between p public servant wljol
betrays his trust, -i publlo servant who is
guilty of blackmail or ths/t, or financial dis
honesty of any kind, and a man guilty—as
Joseph Pulltser has been guilty In this In-
Nation's Duty to Punish
"It therefore Is a high national duty to bring
to justice this vlllifler of the American peo
■ iie this man who. wantonly and Wickedly and
without one shadow of justification, seeks to
blacken the character of reputable private citi
zens, and to convict the government of his own
country In the eyes of the otvllied world of
wrong doing of the basest and foulest kind.
when ha has not one shadow of justification
of any sort or description for the charge he
has made.
"The attorney gen?ral hns under considers
tlon the form unßer which the proceedings
agalnsl Mr. I'ulitzer shall be brought "
The president refers to various papers which
he transmits with his message, and calls atten- ,
tlon to numerous utterances and acts relating
to the canal and Its purchase.
He cites the act of congress by which he
was authorized to pay 140,000.000 for the canal
property, and says it was no concern of the
president what the New Panama Canal com
pany aid with tho money.
Kxplalnlng tin- method of concluding the
purchase th» president says:
"The I'iinaina canal transaction actually
was oarrlsd through not by the then secretary
of state, John Hay, or the then secretary of

BODY OF LATE
POLICE CHIEF
FOUND IN BAY
WILLIAM J. BIGGY RECOVERED
FROM WATERY GRAVE
CORPSE IS SEEN FLOATING OFF
GOAT ISLAND
Identification Is Made Only by Means
of Clothing, as Face Is Disfigured.
Officials Seem Sure of
Identity
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 16.—Th«
body of William J. Biggy, late
chief of police, who disappeared
from the police launch patrol on the
night of November 30, was recovered
from tho waters of the San Francisco
bay.
From the appearance of the body and
the locality in which It was found there
is every reason to believe tha"t it had
remained undisturbed at the bottom of
the bay, not far from the spot where
Chief Biggy is supposed to have been
lost.
Although the features were more or
less lacerated and decomposed, the re
mains were easily identified by means
v the clothing.
Except for the hat, the clothing, even
to overcoat and gloves, was intact, and
it was evident that Chief Biggy had
made no change in his attire after his
last brief conversation with Engineer
Murphy, who was operating the patrol
on the night of the disappearance.
The body was sighted first by pas
sengers on the ferryboat Transit. It
was floating midway across the stream
between Qoat island and the end of
Mission struct.
The fact was at once reported, and
the Patrol, which has been intermit
tently engaged in tho search for the
past fortnight, immediately started out,
accompanied by a fleet of launches.
One of these whs hailed by the crew
of the scow schooner George Woods,
who had in tin; meantime sighted and
recovered the body.
Body Transferred
It was transferred to the police offl
aboard the launch aVid towed to
the Mission street dock.
From points all along the water front
an Immense crowd quickly assembled,
.Scores of policemen were hurried to
the scene. .-l?i<I within a few moments
Acting chief Cutler, Captains Conroy
iirnl Kelly, and a number of subordinate
officials were at the dock:
Just before noon the'coroner's depu
ties took charge of the remains, which
were lifted into the morgue wagon,
while the police stood at attention with
bared heads.
The wagon was accompanied to the
coroner's office by an escort of mounted
police and by Acting Chief Cutler in
an automobile.
In the presence of Acting Chief Cut
ler, Chief Deputy Coroner Kennedy and
other officials, a March of the cloth
ing in which the body was attired, whs
made Immediately upon arrival at tho
morgue.
By means of the two badges which
Chief Blggy wore, a locket with his
monogram, a muffler, a stick pin, his
police whistle and other articles, the
identification was made beyond the
shallow of a doubt.
The watch which Chief Biggy always
carried was stopped at 9:12 o'clock. So
far ;ts could be ascertained, there were
no papers in the pockets to which any
significance could be attached, and It
was concluded if Chief Blggy had a
written resignation prepared on the
occasion of his visit to Police Commis
oyier Huro Keil at the latter's home
In Belvedere, he had disposed of it in
Borne manner before he met his death.
Much to the surprise of the search
ers, a hammerless revolver, wtth al!
chambers loaded, was found in a
pocket, notwithstanding th« fart that
t lie lute chief's pistol was found after
his dead, in a restaurant where he hart
dined on the nlffht of his death.
There was no mark of violence on
tlic body, but an autopsy will be held
to assist, if possible, in clearing uo the
manner of death. The inquest probably
will not be held until next week.
Tells of Conversation
With the finding of the body of Chief
of Police William J. Uiggy In the bay
thin morning the full reasons for his
\isii to Commissioner Keil promise to
be revealed to the public. The morn
ing after the chiefs disappearance
from the police launch Keil made an
extensive memorandum of the conver
sation which he had with the head of
the police department on the previous
evening and entrusted It to Mayor
Taylor, who refuses to divulge its con
tents.
Commissioner Keil said today:
"While the publication of the con
versation 1 bad with the dead chief on
the evening of November 30 would do
iiiueh honor to his memory it might
possibly be the cause of more harm
than good. In that it would lead to re
criminatory attacks.
"Biggy talked with me perhaps more
freely than with anyone else, itnd in
his conversation that night he was
particularly open anil frank. 1 would
give tire memorandum which I made
on the following morning If I were
convinced that an] good could com*
"I may consider it advisable to bring
this matter out at the time of tJw
inquest."
Late this afternoon the body w
dead chief of police was removed to
an undertaking establishment.
The funeral will take plate from s-
Mary's cathedral next Thursday,
services will be conducted and,!
auspices of the Knights of Oolun
and almost the entire police dep
ment will attend. .
A sergeant of police and t,ix patrol
men have been detailed by tho p
commissioners to act as guard
honor and the men will relieve •
other In tight-hour watches b
corpse.
The body will not be exposed to
public view on account of its
vanoed stage of decomposition, oi
to its lengthy stay in the water.
