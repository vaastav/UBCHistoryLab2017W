further, though th TJnlted State. Is not a
nation to which peace la a necessity. It la In
truth th most pacltio.of powers, and desires
nothing so much as to live In amity with all
the world, lis own ample and dltersllied do
mains satisfy all possible lung lugs for terri
tory, praclud all dreams of conquest, nd pre
vent auy casting of covetous eve upon neigh
boring reglona however altrscilve. That cur
conduct towarda Spain and her dominions baa
constituted no exception to this national dis
position la made manifest by the course of pur
government, not only thita far during the pres
ent insurrection, but during the ten years that
followed ihe rising at Vara in ISPH.
No ot her great power, It may safely be said,
under clrcumstsnce of similar perplexity,
would have manifested tbe same restraint olid
the same patient endurance. It may also be
said that this persistent attitude ot the United
States toward Spain in connection with Cuba
will unqueilonalily evince ao alight respct
and regard tor Spain on Ihe part of the Amer
ican peopl. Ther, In truth, do not forget her
connection with lh discovery of Ihe western
hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the
great qiiallllea of the Spsnlali people, nor fell
to fully revognlre their aplondld patriotism and
their chtvalrnua devotion to the national honor.
They view with wonder and admiration ihe
cheerful resolution with which vast bodlea of
men are aent across thousand of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt acetimnlated, thnt
lh eostly possession of the Uem of the An
til lea may atlll hold It plsca in the Spanish
crown, and yet neither the government nortne
people of the United States have shut tholr
eve to the course of event In Cuba or have
failed to reallre the existence of conceded
grievances, which have led to the present re
volt from the authority of Spain grievance
recngnlxed hv the queen regent and by
the cortes. voiced by the moat patriotic and
enlightened of Spanish atalesmen without
regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms
J imposed by the executive nnd approved by the
eglalstlve branch of the Spnnish government.
It ia In the asaumcd temtwr and disposition of
tbe Spnnish government to remedy these griev
ances, forlllled by Indications of Influential
Eubllo opinion In Spain, that this government
as hoped to discover the most promising nnd
effective mennaof composing the present strife,
with honor and advantage to Spain, with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects of
Uietiisurrectlou.
It would seem that It Spain thould offer to
Citlia gemiin autonomy, a measure of home
rule which, while preserving Ihe sovereignty
of Spain, would satisfy all rational require
ments of her Spanish subjects, there should be
no Just reason why the puclllcatlon of the In
land might not be effected on that basis. Such
a result would oppear to be In the Interest of
all concerned. It would at once stop the con
flict, which Is now consuming the resources nt
the Island tntl making It worthless for which
ever party mnv ultimately prevail. It
would keep Intact the possession of
Spala without touching her honor, which
will be consulted rather than impugned by
the adequate redress of admitted grlevnncen
It would put the prosperity of the island and
tbe fortunes of Its inhabitants within their
own oontrol without severing the natural and
ancient ties which bind tbem tn the mother
country, and would yet enable them to lest
tbelr capacity for solf-govornment under tbe
most fnvornble conditions.
II has been objected, on the one side, that
Spain should not promise autonomy until her
'insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On
the other sldo. thnt promised autonomy, how
ever liberal, I Insufficient, because without
assurance of the promise being fulnlled.
Hut the reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain of unconditional surrender on the part
of the Insttrcent Cubans before their autonomy
is concerted Is not altogether apparent.
It Ignores Important features of the situation
-the stability two years' duration hs given
to the Insurrection i the feasibility of its In
definite prolongation in the nature of things,
and as shown bv past experience; the uilor
and Imminent ruin of Ihe Island, unless the
present strife I Bpeedlly composed! abovo all,
the rank abuses which all panics In Spain, all
branches of her government and all her lend
ing public men concede to exist nnd profess a
desire to remove.
Pacini such olrcumstances, to withhold the
profer of needed reforms until the parties
demanding them put themselves at mercy by
throwing down their arms, has the appearance
of neglecting the grnvest of perils and Invit
ing suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fessed willingness togrnnt reforms.
The objection on behalf of the Insurgent
thnt promised reforms can not be relied upon
must, of course, be consldored, though we
have no right to assume, and no reason for as
suming, that anything that Spain undertake
to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done ac
cording to bolh the spirit and the letter of the
undertaking.
Nevertheless, realising thnt suspicions and
precautions on the part of the weaker of two
combatant are alwoys natural and not always
unjustifiable, and being slnoerely desirous in
the Internst of both as well as on its own no
count that the Cuban problem should be solved
with th least possible delay, It was Intimated
by this government to the government of
Spain some months ago that, If a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered Ihe Cu
ban insurgent and would be accepted by
them upon a guaranty of Its execution, the
United State would endeavor to And a wuy
not objectionable to Spain of furnishing aucn
"v'hi'l'fuio definite response to this intimation
has yet been received irota tbe Spanish gov
ernment, it Is believed to be not altogether
welcomewhlle, a treaty I suggested, no
reason l perceived why It should not be ap-
Kovcd by tho Insurgents. Neither party can
II to see the importance of early action, and
both must ronllte thnt to prolong the present
atatoof thing for even a snort period will add
enormously to the time nnd labor nd xpendl
tur aecoesary to bring about the industrial
recuperation of th island. It Is, there
fore, fervontly hoped on all grounds
that earnest efforts for healing the
breach between Spain aud the Insurgent Cu
ban, upon the line above Indicated, mav be
at once Inaugurated and pushed to an Imme
diate and uceeful Issue. The friendly of
fice of the United States, either In the man
ner above outlined, or In any other way con
Istent with our constitution and laws, will al
ways be at th disposal of either party. -i
-Whatever circumstances may arise, our po.
loy and ouf Interests would constrain us to ob
ject to the acquisition of the Island or the in
terference with its control by any other
should be added thai It con not be reason
able assumed that the hitherto expectant at
titude of the United States w.111 be indefinitely
maintained. While we are anxious to accord

oan not view the pending conflict In all lt

relations to It, and possible result, without
consldqrlni that, by tbe course of events, We
may De arnwn into suo uu,

patient waiting for Spain to end the oonieat,
either alone and In her own way, or with our
friendly co-operation. '

Construction of Our New Navy,
The work of the navy department and ita
present conditions are fully exhibited In the
reiort of the secretary. The construction of

On March 4. 1803, there were in commission
but two armored vessels, the double-turreted
monitors Miantoiicnioh and Monterey. Since
that date, of vessels itheretofore authorised
there have been placed In their first commis
sion three first-class and two second-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers, one
harbor-defense ram, o nnd five dnubie-
turreted monitors, including the Maine

will bo ready for sea in tbe early spring.
Th W ar College. -
The war college has developed into an insti

value to the navy, in teaching tbo science of
war as well as in stimulating professional zeal
in the navy, and ll will be especially useful In
tbe devising of plans for the utillxutlon, In
case ot necessity, of all the naval resouroes of

Pacific Railroad Obligation.
Tho aecretary call attention to the nubile
Interests Involved In an adjustment of In ob
ligation a ot tbe Pnolilo rallroada to th govern

espeolally present this subject to the conslder
tluo of the congress.
under section 4 of th act ot congress passed
March t, 1887, the president Is charged with
the duty in the event that any mortgage or
other Incumbrance paramount to the micros!

congress has for a number of year almost
constantly naa unuer consideration varioua
Pians for dealing with Ibe conditions existing

have thus fur felt justified In withholding ac

An Urgent Blluntlon.
In the case of the Union Pacific company.
however, th case ha become espeolally aud
Immediately urgent Proceedings have been
instituted to toreciose a nrst mortgwgo upon
these aided parts of the main Hues upon
which the government holds a second and
subordinate mortgage lion. In consequence of
Ibese proceedings and Increasing complica
tions, added to tne default occurring on tbe
first day of January, 1197, a condition will be
firosented at that dale, ao far as this company
s concerned, that must emphasise the man
date of tbe act of 18x7 and give to executive
duty undor Its provision a more Important
aspect. I
'therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct or shall have previously determined
upon different solution of the problem thore
will harcly appear to exist any resson for de

mentioned, such executive action as will prom

, DEPARTMENT Or AGRICULTURE.
Worthy ol Coustnnl Cnr nnd Eucoarsge-
ninu
Tbe department ot agriculture I to tntl
mately related to the welfare of our people and
the prosperity of . our nation luat It
should constantly receive the care
and encouragement of the government
From a small beginning It ba grown to be
the center ot agricultural Intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agricul
tural efforts. Larg sums ot money are an
nually appropriated for the malnienaaoe of
this department, and It must be eonfeseed that
the legislation relating to It has always been
directed in the Interest of pructloal farming or
properly guarded against waste ana extrava
gance. So far, however, a public money haa
been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
mose wno actually tin tne son, no expenditure
nun been more prontuoiy made or more gener
ally approved oy ine people.
Export ot Farm Product.
Tho secretary report that the value of our
exports ol farm products during the last fiscal
year amount! d to (liTO.OOfl.OtX). an increase of
i7,i;oii.iw over thore ot the year Immediately
preceauig.
This statement is not the ler weloome be
oause of the fuel that, notwithstanding such in
crease, the proportion of exported agricultural
products to our totul exports ot all descrip
tions fell off during the year. The benctlta of
an Increase In agricultural products being as
sured, lb decrease iu its proportion to our
total export In the more gratifying when we
oonslder that it is owing to the fact that such
total exporta for tbe year Increased more than
ayo.uuu.ouu.
Urniultoua Dlatrlbutlon of Hoods.
In my opinion the gratuitous dlatrlbutlon ot
seeds py tne department, a at present oon-
duoted, ought to be discontinued. No one can
re d the statement of tbe secretary on thl
subject and doubt the extravagance and ques
tionable results of Ibis praotlce. The pro
fessed friend of the farmer, and certainly the
farmers themselves, are naturally expected to
be Willing to rid a department devoted to the
promotion of farming Interests ot a feature
wntca tenas so muou to it discredit
The W eather Bureau.
The weather bureau, now attached to tbe de

nggeetlona ToaehHtg lh. Present Law
nnd Ita Op.rnllona.
I desire to recur to tbe statements elsewhere
mad concerning th governueul's receipts
nod expenditures for the purpose of venturing
upon some suggestions touching our present
tariff law and Its operation.
This statute took eticcl on th win day of
August, 1NM, Whatever may be Its shortootu.
log aa a complete meaaura of tariff reform. It
must be aooorded that it haa opened the way
to a freer aad greater exchange of cotuuiodi
tlc between the United Stale nd otOer
countries, nd thus furnished a wider market
for our products and maaufaclurcrs. The only
entire fiscal year during which thl law ha
been en fo reed ended on the 30th day of June,
lnvu. in mat year our import increases over
those of the previoua year more than (e,&00,KO,
while the value of domestic products we ex
ported, and which found market abroad, was
nearly 7O,iiO0,ou0 more than during the pre
ceding year.
1 nose wno insist that tha cost to our people
ot articles coming to them trom abroad lor
ineir aoediui use should only be Increased
through tariff ehargea to an extent necessary
to mcel the expeusea of tbe government, aa
wen as tnuse wao claim mat tariff charge
may be laid upon such article beyoud the
necessities of government reveuue.snd with lb.
additional purpose of so Increasing Ihelr price
in our maraets a to give American manufac
turers aad producer bettor nd more prohts
ble opportunities, must agra thai our tariff
laws are only primarily Justified as sources of
revenue to enable the government to meet th
necessary expenses of its maintenance. Coa
eldered as to Ita sufficiency In this aspect, the
present taw can by no mean fU under iust
condemnation ' During the only complete
fiscal year of it operation it ha yielded near
ly r8.lsXi.UJU mure revenue than wa received
from tariff duties In tbe precedlrg yenr. There
wa. aevertneic. a deficit between our re
ceipts snd expenditure of a little more than
fcjft.ouo.000. Thla. however, wa not unexpected.
Tbe situation waa auch in December last, seveu
moniba before the close ot the fiscal year, thai
tne secretary or tne ireasurv loreiold a den-
clenoy ol I17,0lx),01)o.
Need Not Exelte er Dlaterb U.
Ia the meantime no defleil that ha occurred
or may occur need exelte or disturb us. To
meet any such deficit in the treasury, In addi
tion to a gold reserve of IP o.imo.ooo, a surplus
of more than lltK.iXJO.OOO applicable to the pay
ment of the expense ot the government, and
wnion must utiles expended tor that burpose.
remain a useless hoard; or. it not extravagant
ly wasted, must in any event be perverted trom
tne purpose ot lie exaction irotn our poopie.
The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in
ine revenue irotn tnia tuna t nothing more
than lu proper and legitimate use.
A Matter nf ftu Drew. Iinportnue..
1 tuppone It will not be denied that under
tue present law our people obtain the necea
snrles of a Comfortable existence at a obeaper
rate than formerly. Thl I a mutter of supreme
Importance, since It Is Ihe l Hostile duty of
every Just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible The rjeople
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under the
stress of their governmenl't necessity made
plainly manliest.
OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
Weakness and
Vice ot
Our Present
Method.
Thl reference lo the Conditions and pros
pects of our revenue naturally suggest, an
allusion to me weakness and vices ot our nnan
olnl method. They have been frequently
pressed upon the attention of congress In
previoua communication and the Inevitable
danger of their continued toleration pointed
out Without now repeating these detnlla, I
can not refrain from again earnestly present
ing the necessity of th prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule ot sound tlnanoe
and shown by experience to be fraught with
tne gravest pern ana perpioxny.
Withdrawals nf Oold Obligations.
Becaua we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from It depressing lufluenco. thla should
not lull us Into a false seourlty, nor lead us lo
lorget tne suauennesa oldest visitation. I am
more eonvlneed than ever that we can have
no assured financial pence and safety until the
government currency obligations upon which
gold may be demanded from the treasury ore
withdrawn trom circulation and cancelled.
This might be done, as haa been heretofore
recommended, by Ihelr exchange for long-
term bonds bearing a low ralo of interest or
by their redemption wilh the proceed of auch
bond.
Thla plan of laaulng bond for the purpose of
redemption certainly appear to be the most
effective snd direct path to the needed reform.
in default oi tnis, however, it would be a step
In lh right direction if currency obligations,
redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed,
should be cancelled Instead of reissued. This
operation would be a alow remedy, but It would
improve present conditions.
National Hank Note. -
Natlonnl banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to Issue circu
lation to the pur value ot bonds deposited as
security for redemption, and the tax on their
circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of
one percent.
In considering project for the retirement of
the United State notes nnd treasury note Is
sued under the new law of 10. 1 am of tne
opinion we have placed too much stress upon
the danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that
would be added to our circulation If invited to
us by better and safer financial methods. It Is
not ao much contraction of our currency that
should be avoided ea Its unequal distribution.
The entire ease may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn upon un until
our government abandon the banking busi
ness snd tbe accumulation ot funda, and con
fines Ita monetary operations to tbe receipt of
th money contributed by tbe people for It
support, snd the expenditure of such money
for the people's benefit lOur business Interests
nnd all good eitlBen long for rest from fever
ish agltntlon, and the Inauguration by the
government of a reformed financial policy
which will encourage enterprise and make
certain tho reward ot labor and industry.
- MONOPOLY.
Trusts nnd Other Aggregitlona of Capital.
Another topic In which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. 1 refer to the existence of trunts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
of which I to secure tbe monopoly of some
particular branch of trade. Industry or com
merce, and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are defended It Is usually on the
ground that, though they Increase prices, tbey
also reduce price, and thus may benefit the
public It must be remembered, however, that
a reduction of prices to the people is not one of
the real object ot these organization, nor It
tbelr tendency necessarily In that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case It is only be
cause It accord with tbe purposes or Interest
of those managing the scheme
Though congress has attemned to deal with
this matter by legislation, tbe laws passed for
that purpose thus far hav proved ineffective,
not because ot any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply because the
laws themselves, as Interpreted bv the courts.
do not reach the difficulty. If the Insuniclenci-a
of existing laws can be remedied by Jurther
leg'Siatiou, it uuuiu no uooe.
An Appeal for Economy.
In concluding this communication. Its last
words shall be an appeal to the congress for
tne mosi rigta economy in tne expenditure of
the money It holds In trust for the neonln.

but a return to frugality Is difficult When.

Hefurcnce is also made to

and the secretary sets forth the report
ot a board appointed to formulate t
general plan for the laying up of ves

it is announced that the department

legislation as may be needed to enablo
It to provide proper accommodations

department is deeply impressed.
i The Subject of tit Naval Mllltla
is dealt with at some length, and tt la
shown that at the close ot the lost. ad
ministration the number of militia
lawfully certified was 1,749, divided
among the stntea ot Ehode Island,
Maryland, South Carolina, North Car

informed of the prospective formation
ot an additional battalion tn New
York (at Brooklyn) and an organiza
tion in Ohio.
The secretary devotes considerable
space to reviewing the reports of the
chiefs of bureau which have already
been published, and in this connection
asks congress to authorize the build
ing of a dock at Norfolk of sufficient
size to take In the largest vessel of the
navy. This he recommends should be
constructed of concrete, as It I more
durable, more readily repaired and
cheaper than wooden dock.'
Such satisfactory experiment have
been made with

the department ha ordered that a tug
now being constructed at the Norfolk
yard aud one of the smaller torpedo
boats being built by tho Herreshoff
company, be fitted for using this oil,
