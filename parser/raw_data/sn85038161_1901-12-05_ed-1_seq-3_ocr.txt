ROOSEVELT TO CONGRESS
Sends His First Annual Message to the Senate
v and House of Representatives
MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS
Eulogtees the Late President McKintey and Advocates Stern Measure
for Anarchists Proposes Trust Legislation Along: the Lines of Pub
licity Favors Government Construction of Irrigation Works
Urges Construction of Isthmian' Canal and Laying of Pa
cific Cable Asks Legislation for the Colonies and
Reciprocity for Cuba Would Exclude Chinese.
Thj following Is a comprehensive sum
mary ol President Roosevelt's messtge to
congress:
Ths president begins hla flrat annual
communication with an official announce
merit or the death of the late President
McKlnley, and a euloty of hla ftrmtr
chief in which he gays:
''It la not too much to lay that at the
time of President McKlnley'a death he
was tho most widely-loved man In all the
United States, while we have never hod
any public man of hla position who has
been so wholly free from the bitter ani
mosities Incident to publlo life. His po
litical opponents were the first to bear
the heartiest and most generous tribute
to the broad kindliness of nature, the
aweetness and gentleness of character
which so endeared him to his close asso
ciates. To a standard of lofty Integrity.
In publlo life he united the tender affec
tions and home virtues which are all
Important In the makeiip of national
character. A gallant soldier In the great
war for the union, ho also shone as an
example to all our people because of his
conduct In the moat sacred and Intimate
of home relations. There could be no
personal hatred of him, for he never act
id with aught but consideration for the
welfare of others. No one could fall to
respect him who knew him In public or
private life. Tho defenders of those mur
derous criminals who seek. to excuse their
criminality by asserting that It Is exer
cised for political ends Inveigh against
wealth and Irresponsible power. But for
this assassination even this base apology
cannot be urged."
"The shock, the grief of the country, are
blttor In the minds of all who saw tho
dark days while the president yet hovered
between life and death. At lost the light
was stilled In the kindly eye, and tho
breath went from the lips that even In
mortal agony uttered no words save of
forgiveness to his murderer, of love for
his friends and of unfaltering trust In the
will of the Most High. Such a death
crowning the glory of such a life leave
us with lnflnlto sorrow, but with such
pride In what he had accomplished and in
his own personal character that we feel
the blow not as struck at him, but a
atruck at the nation. We mourn a good
and great president who Is dead, but
wnue we mourn we are mica up uy tnc
splendid achievements of ills' life and the
5
rami neroisrsywitn wnicn ne met Ms
leath."
In the same connection he makes
trong recommendations as to how the
nation should deal with anarchy. He
urges that the preaching or teaching of
anarchy be not permitted, and requests
congress to enact legislation that will
Iirevent anarchists from foreign countries
ending upon our shores. He would also
have the federal courts given Jurisdiction
over any man who kills, or attempts to
kill, the president of the country, or any
person who la In Una for succession to
the presidency. Ha has no fear, however,
that the country will ever fall Into an
archyj i
"The federal 'courts should be given Jur
isdiction over any man who kills or at
tempts to kill the president or any man
who. by the constitution or by law is In
line of. succession for the presidency,
while the punishment for an unsuccessful
attempt should be proportioned to ..the
enormity of the" offense' against our In
stitutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole
human race, and all mankind should band
against the anarchist. His crime should
be made an offense against the law "of
nations; like piracy and that form of man
stealing known as the.slave trade, for It
Is of far blacker Infamy than either. It
should bo so declared by treaties among
all civilised powers. Such treaties would
give to the federal government the power
of dealing with the crime."
The Trusts.
The president sees cause 'for congratu
lation for the nation In the business condi
tions of the present, but sees In the "tre
mendous ana highly complex Industrial
development which went on with ever ac
celerated rapidity .during the latter half
of the nineteenth century" a serious social
problem for the prestnt and future. Ha
does not believe that the old laws and old
customs are sufficient to regulate the ac
cumulation and distribution of wealth of
the present time. He does not attribute
the creation of great corporate fortunes
to the existence of a prptecttve tariff, "nor
to any other .governmental action, .but to
natural causes In the business world, op
erating In other countries, as they operate
In our own." In this connection he says:
"The process has aroused much antago
nism, a great part of which Is wholly
without warrant. It Is not true that as
us ncn nwe grown ncner ine poor have
?rown poorer. On the contrary, never be
ore has the average man, the wage
worker, the farmer, the small trader,
been so well off as In this country and
at the present time. There have been
abuses connected with the accumulation
of wealth, yet it remains true that a for
tune accumulated In legitimate business
can he accumulated by the person tpe
clally benefited only on condition of con
ferring Immense Incidental benefits upon
0,her.!' u Bxectttu enterprise of the typo
w.hl?h .feeneflt,?," "inland can only ex
lt If the conditions are such as to offer
'TrS, plltf,l V ,he ,rewa"' of success!"
Hut while he realizes existing condi
tions, he emphaslres'the fact that congress
In providing remedies must act with cau
tion, as the men and corporations "who
have built up our commerce and driven our
railroads across tbo continent have done
fhf",' .S001 ,. Pu.i" .leople. and without
them the material development of which
we are so Justly proud could never have
taken place. Moreover, we should recog
nise the immense Importance to this ma
terlal development of leaving an unham
per.d .SB '" compatible with the publlo
KS?m,hi" "tronf nl forceful men upon
. !" .' le ""ccoss of business operations
Inevitably rests. The slightest 'study of
nin" Sondl,lnn" "II satisfy anyone
capable of forming a Judgment that the
personal cquutlon Is the most Important
factor In a business operation: that the
buslneB ability of the man nt the head of
inv hllRlneiia innprn hit nw 111 tA I......-,
ly the factor which fixes the gulf between
striking success and hopeless failure."
Another reason for caution In trust legis
lation which he giver "Is to be found In the
International commercial conditions of to
day, Tho same business conditions which
have produced the great aggregations of
corporate and Individual wealth have
made them very potent factors in Inter
national commercial competition. Iiusl
ness concerns which have the largest
means at their disposal and are managed
!-b?.tho "ule' "" are naturally those
"which take the lead In the strife for com
mercial supremacy among the nations of
the world. America has only Just begun
to assume that commanding position In
the International business world which
we believe wilt more and more be hers. It
Is of the utmost importance that this po
sition be not Jeoparded, especially at a time
when the overflowing abundance of our
awn natural resources and the skill, busi
ness energy and mechanical aptitude of
our people make foreign markets essen
tial, under Such conditions It would be
most unwise to cramp or to fetter the
youthful strength of our nation.
"Moreover, It cannot too often bo pointed
otit that to Btrike with Ignorant violence
at the Interests of one set of men almost
laevltsbly endangers the Interests of all.
The fundamental rule in our national life,
the rule which underlies all others. Is that
on the whole and In the long run wo shall
go up or down together. There are excep
tions, and In times of prosperity some will
?rosper far more unci In times of adversi
ty some will suffer far morn than others;
put, speaking geueially, a period of good
times weans that all share more or less
in them, and In a period of hard times all
reel the stress to a greater or less degree."
..A18 t?0nts to the fact that In the past

war, for they hamper those who would
endeavor to find nut In rational fashion
what the wrongs really are and to what
extent and In what manner It Is prac
ticable to apply remedies."
Remedies for the Trust Evil.
But while he says the above Is true, he
yet sees many evils for which there should
be remedies provided. Of these evils the
chief Is over capitalization, "because of
its many baleful consequences." lie says:
'!The conviction of tho American people
that the great corporations, known as
trust, are In certain of their features and
tendencies hurtful to the general welfare,
Is based upon sincere conviction that com
bination 'nnd concentration should be not
prohibited, but supervised and within
reasonable limits controlled, and In my
Judgment this conviction Is right."
As a remedy for theso evils he says:
"The first essential In determining how
to deal with the great Industrial com
binations Is knowledge, of tho facts
publicity. In the Interest of the publlo
the government should have the right to
Inspect nnd examine tho workings of
the great corporations ongaged .In Inter
state business. Publicity Is the only sure
further remedies are needed In the way
of eovurnmAnlnl ..vulnHnn a ........'
can only bo determined after publicity
has been obtained by process of law and
In the course of administration. The first
requisite Is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may be made public
to the world.
"Ar.t'.n,al oodles, such as corporations
and Joint stock or other associations de
pending upon nny statutory law for their
existence or privileges, should be subject
to proper governmental supervision, and
full and accurate Information as to their
operations should bo made public regu
larly at reasonable Intervals'
'.'The . large corporations, commonly
called trusts, though organized In one
state, always do business In many states,
often doing very little business In tho
state where they are Incorporated. There
s utter lack of uniformity In the stato
laws about them, and as no state has
any excluslvo Interest In or power over
heir acts It has In practice proved Im
possible to get ndequato regulation
through stato action. Therefore In the
Interest of the whole people the nation
should, without Interfering with the pow
er of tho states In tho mntter Itself, also
assume power of supervision and regula
tion oyer all corporations doing an Inter
state business. This Is especially true
where the corporation derives a portion
of Its wealth from the existence of some
monopolistic element or tendency In Its
business. There would be no hardship In
such supervision. Hanks are subject to
It. and In their case It Is now accepted
as a simple matter of course. Indeed It
Is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so far as Is now the case with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts In
order to produce excellent results."
The president believes that, It will be

than to the associations themselves

stretched to him. To be permanently ef
fective aid must always tnke the form of
helping a man to help himself, and we
can all best help ourselves by Joining to
gether In. the work that Is of common In
terest tp all."
Tlie Immigration lavfB,
He pronounces1 our 'present Immigration
laws unsatisfactory. In which connection
he says "we need every huueit mid ol
ficlent imm'grant fitted tp beoino an
.American clllxen, every 'Immigrant who
cuiiiea here to stay, who brings h;ru .1
itrnnr; body, a good head nnd a resolute
purpose to. dc his duty well In every way
and to bring up nls children as law-abiding,
Uud-Karliuf members of the community."
liut he says:
"Tlitro should be a comprehensive law
enacted with the object of working a
threefold Improvement over our preuont
sytlcm First, we should aim to exclude
uLsolutely not only all person who ure
knownto be bellcvors In anarchistic prin

quire a more thorough system of inspec

lie tomer being especially ueeom.iry.
"The second object of u proper Immi

ity treaties and tho general policy of reci
5i1,y " .? me"s of opening the doors of
rorelgn nations to our commerce, in which
connection he says:
"Kvery application of our tariff policy to
meet our shifting national needs must be
conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the
duties mint never be reduced below the
point that will cover the difference between
thp labor cost here and abroad. Tho well
being of the wageworker Is a prime consid
eration of our entire policy of economlo
legislation.
"Subject to this proviso of the proper
protection necessary to our Industrial
well being at home the principle of reci
procity must command our hearty sup
port. Tho phenomenal growth of our
export trade emphasizes the urgency of
the need for wider markets and for a lib
eral policy In dealing with foreign na
tions. Whatever Is merely petty and vex
atious In the way of trade restrictions
should be avoided. The customers to
whom we dispose of our surplus products
In the long run directly or Indirectly pur
chase those surplus, products by giving us
something In return. Their ability to pur
chase our products should as far as pos
sible be secured by so arranging our tar
iff as to enable us to take from them
those products which we can use without
harm to our own Industries and labor or
tho use of which will be of marked benefit
to us.
"The natural .line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will be In connection
with those of our productions which no
longer require all of the support once
needed to establish them upon' a sound
basis, and with those others where either
beqause of natural or of economic causes
we are beyond tho reach of successful
competition.
"I ask the attention of the senate to the
reciprocity treaties laid before It by my
predecessor." '
The Merchant Marine.
The president pronounces our merchant
marine "discreditable tons as a nation and
Insignificant to that of other nations which
we overtop In other forms of business,"
and says we "should not longer submit to
conditions under which only a trilling por
tion of our great commerce Is carried In
our own ships. Of this ho says:
"To remedy this state of things would not
merely serve to build up our rhlpplng In
terests, but It would nlso result In benefit
to all who are Irterestod In the perma
nent establishment ef t wider market for
American products ur.d would provide an
auxiliary forrte for tho rnvy. Ships nork
for their own ccurtrles just as railroads
work for their terminal points. Shipping
lines. If established to the principal coun
tries with which we have dialings, would
be of rolltlcal as well as commercial ben
efit. From every standpoint It Is unwise
for the United fetatej to continue to rely
upon the ships of competing nations for the
distribution of on, goods. It should be
mirte ndvuntngenu to carry American
goods In American built ships."
ills lecommendHtlcn on this subject is
only that "our government should take
such anion as will remedy these Inequali
ties. The American merchant marine
should be restored' lo the ocean."
Finances,
Under this heading the president recom
mends fuch lei:li!utir,n as will better safe
guard against the .Icritnglng lnlluences of
commercial crises uiid financial panics and
such ns will make the currency of tho
country nvjro rtspnuMvi to the demands
of domtstlc trade and commerce.

"Hut after providing hgali.tt any such
contln;'er.e .i.eans , ihould be adopted
which will bring the revenues more nearly
within the limit of our actual needs."
. He urges the necessity for strict economy
In expenditures, but that "our nntlonal
needs forbid us to be niggardly In the mat
ter of providing whatever Is actually nec
essary to our well-being."
Inter-State Commerce.
He points to defects In the Interstate
commerce law, and recommends amend
ments to correct them, In which connection
he says:
"Those who complain of the management
of the railways allege that established
rates are not maintained, that re
bates and similar devices are habitually
resorted. to, .that these preferences are
usually In .favor of the large shipper, that
they drive out of business the smaller
competitor, that while many rates are too
low many others are excessive and that
gross preferences. are made affecting both
localities and commodities. Upon the oth
er hand, the railways assert that the law
by Its very terms tends to produce many
of these Illegal practices by depriving car
riers of that right of-concerted action
which they claim Is necessary to estab
lishand maintain nondiscriminating rates.
"The act should be amended. The rail
way Is a public servant. Its rates should
be Just to and open to all shippers alike.
The government should see to It that
within Its Jurisdiction this Is so and
should provide a speedy. Inexpensive and
effective remedy to that end. At the same
time It must not be forgotten that our
railways are the arteries through which
the commercial llfeblood of this nation
flows. Nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
unnecessarily Interfere with the develop
ment and operation of these commercial
agencies."
Asrrlenltural Interests,
The president cites the forest legislation
of the past and the great good of forest
preserves to the people, and rays they will
Inevitably be of still greater value.- Con
tinuing, he says:
"At present the protection of the forest
reserves rests with the general land office,
the mapping and description of their tim
ber with the United States geological sur
vey and the preparation of plans for their
conservative use with the bureau of for
estry, which Is also charged with the gen
eral advancement of practical forestry In
the United States. These various func
tions should be united In the bureau of
forestry, to wnicn tney properly beiorg.
The present diffusion of responsibility Is.
bad from every standpoint. It prevents
irtui enecnve cooperation oeiween tno
government, and the men who utilize the
resources or the reserves, without which
the Interests of both must suffer The
scientific bureaus generally should be put
under the department of ugrloulture. The
president should have by law the power
of transferring lands for use as forest re
serves to the department of agriculture.
He already has such'power In the case of
lands needed by the departments of war
and the navy,"
Irrigation,
Irrigation tn connection with the wasto
lands oi the wei is a quebtlon to which
the president giv conslueruuie attention,
a i,u taunts h.iOi.h- rtcomnunduiionu for
government uveinUnce In reclaiming thu
vvasto lands uj insisting In their irriga

country to-uu it the waters that now run

of the United States.

ot the forest reserves should ufford per
petual protection to the native launa and
flora, sufe havens of refuge to our rapidly
diminishing wild animals of the larger
kinds and free camping grounds for the
ever-Increasing numbers ot men nnd wom
en who huvo learned to find rest, health
and recreation In the splendid forests and
J.,.1,eI'clad meadows, of our mountains.
J ho forest reserves should be set apart
forever for the use and benefit of our pco
plo as a whole and not sacrificed to the
shortsighted gretd of a few."
"The forests alone cannot, however, fully
regulate and conserve the waters of the
arid region. Oreat storage works are nec
essary to equalize tho flow of streams and
to save the flood wators. Their construc
tion has been conclusively shown to be an
undertaking too vast for private effort.
Nor can it be best accomplished by tho In
dividual states acting ulono. Far-reaching
Interstate problems ure Involved, and the
resources of slnglo states would often be
Iradequftte. It Is iiroperly a national
function, at least In iiome of Its features.
It Is as right for the national government
to make the streams and rivers of the
arid region useful by engineering works
for water storage- as to mako useful the
rivers and harbors of the humid region by
engineering works of. another kind. The
storing of the floods In resorvoJrs at the
headwaters of our rivers Is but an en
largement of our present policy of river
control under which levees are built on
the lower reaches of the same streams.
"The government should construct and
maintain these reservoirs as It does other
publlo works. Where their purpose Is to
regulate the flow of streams the water
should be turned freely Into the channels
In the dry season to take tho same course
Under the same laws as the natural flow.
"The reclamation and settlement of the
rid lands wjlt .enrich every portion of
our country, Just as the settlement of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought prosr
perlty to the Atlantic states. The In
creased demand for manufactured arti
cles will stimulate Industrial production,
while wider home markets and the trade
of Asia will consume the larger food sup
plies and eftectually provent western
competition with uasteri agriculture. In
deed, the products of irrigation will be
consumed chiefly In upbuilding local cen
ters of mining and other Industries which
would otherwise not come Into existence
at all. Our people as a whole will profit,
for successful homemaklng Is but anotlwr
name- for the tipbunaiiig ot the nation.
He counsels against attempting too much
at the beginning, but advises that we let
experience on n small plan teach tlio pos
sibilities of greater undertakings. Ho also
cites the conditions under which the set
tlers of the west are attempting to build
homes on theso arid lands, and says:
"The security and value of the homes
created depend largely on the stability of
titles to water, but the majority of these
rest on the uncertain foundation of court
decisions rendered In ordinary suits at
law. With a few creditable exceptions,
tho arid states have failed to provide for
the certain and Just division of streams In
times nf.scarclty. Jjhx and uncertain laws
have made It possible to establish rights
to water tn excess jot actual uses or ne
cessities, and many streams have already
passed Into private ownership or a control
equivalent to ownership.
"Whoever controls a stream practically
controls the land It renders productive, and
the doctrine of private ownership of water
apart from land cannot prevail without
causing enduring wrong. The recognition
of such ownership, which has been per
mitted to grow up In the arid regions,
should give way to n more enlightened and
larger recognition of the rights of tho pub
lic in the control and disposal of the pub
lic water .supplies. Laws founded upon
conditions obtaining In humid regions1,
where water Is too abundant to Justify
hoarding It, have no proper application In
a dry country.
"In the arid states tho only right to water
which should be recognized Is that of use.
In Irrigation thl right should attach to
the land reclaimed nnd be Inseparable
therefrom. Granting perpetuil water
rights to other than uscrt without
compensation to the public Is often to all
the objections which apply to giving away
perpetual franchises to the public utllf.
iiles of the cities. A few of the western
states have already recognized this and
have Incorporated In their constitutions
the doctrine of perpetual state ownership
of water "
The Colonies.
Considerable attention Is riven the col
onies, and especially the Philippines. This
section of the message begins by citing
tho needs of Hawaii and Porto Hlco, of
which he says:
"In Hawaii our aim must be to develop
the territory on tho traditional American
lines. We do not wish a region ot large
estates tilled by cheap labor. Wo wish a
healthy American community of men
who themselves till tho farms they own.
All our legislation for the Islands should
be shaped with this end In view. The wall
being .of the average homemaker must
afford the true test-of the healthy devel
opment ot the islands. The land policy
should as nearly as posslblo be modeled
on our homestead system."
Of Porto Hlco he says the Island Is thriv
ing as never before, and Is being adminis
tered efficiently and honestly, lie deems
no legislation necessary except that con
cerning tlie public lands of the Island.
He calls attention to the fact that In
Cuba the Independent government of the
Island will soon be In control, and In the
same connection urges strongly tho need
of reciprocal trnde relat'ons with the new
nation, upon which subject he says:
"In the cuse of Cuba there are weighty
reasons of morality nnd of national Inter
est why the policy should be held to have
a peculiar application, and I moit earnest
ly ask your attention to the wisdom, Indeed
to the ltal need, of providing for u sub
stantial reduction In the tariff duties on
Cuban Imports Into the United States.
Cuba has In her constitution nfllrmed w hat
we desired that she should stand In Inter
national matters In closer and more friend
ly relations with us than with any other
power, and we are bound by every consid
eration of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures Jn the Interest of
her material well being.
For the Philippines he recommends much
In the way of legislation, but again coun
sels caution that we go neither too far nor
with too great haste. He says: "We hope
to mako our administration of the Islands
honorable to our nation by making It of the
highest benefit to the Filipinos themselves,
and as an earnest of what we Intend to do
we point to what we have done.
Already a greater measure of material
prosperity and of governmental honesty
and. efficiency has been attained In the
Philippines than ever before In their his
tory." He says we do not desire to do for the
Islanders, "merely what has elsewhere been
done for tropic peoples by even the best
foreign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done for
any people of the tropics to mske them
fit for self-government after the fashion of
the really free nations."
But the Idea of the president Is that we
cannot leave the Islands at this time, of
which he says: "To leave the Islands at
this time would mean that they would
fall Into a welter of murderous tinarchy.
Buch n desertion of duty on our part
would be a crime against humanity."
liut he believes sufficient progress has
been made along the Unas under which we
have been working In the Islands to war
rant us In passing new legislation, but In
this connection he urges the need of cau
tion. He believes the time has come when
the Industries of which the Islands are
capable should be encouraged by granting
franchises' for their development, and of
this he rays: k
VNothlng" better can be done for the Is
lands than to Introduce Industrial enter
prises. Nothing would benefit them so
much as throwing them open to Industrial
development. The connection between
Idleness and mischief Is proverbial, and the
opportunity to do remunerative work Is
one of the surest preventives of war. Of
course no business man will go Into the
Philippines unless It Is to hlslnterest to
do so, and It Is Immensely to the Interest
ot the Islands that ho should go In. It Is
therefore necessary that the congress
should pass laws by which the' resources
of the Islunds can be developed, so that
franchises (tor limited terms oi years) can
be granted to companies doing business In
them and every encouragement be given
to the Incoming of business men ot every
kind.
"Not to permit this Is to do a wrong to
the Philippines, The franchises must be
granted und the business permitted only
under regulations w tilth will guarantee the
islands ugulnst un kind of Improper ex
ploitation, liut tnu ust natural' wealth
of the Islunds must lie developed, and the
capitul willing to develop It must be given
thu opportunity. The tleii! must be thrown
open to Individual enterprise, which has
been the real factor In the development of
every region over w hlcli our Hag has flown.
It Is urgently nccetsarj to enact suitable
laws dealing with general transportation,
mining, bunking, currency, homesteads und
the use and ownership ot the lands and
timber. Thise laws will give free play to
Industrial enterprise, and the commercial
development which will surely follow will
afford to the people of the Islunds the
best proofs of the sincerity of our desire
to aid thtm "
Tho construction of n Puclllc cablo Is
also urged, either that the government
lay such a cable to connect Hawaii and
the Philippine:), or that un arrangement
bo miiUci by which the advantages ac
cruing from a government cable may be
secured to the government by contract
with u private cubit! company. This he
deems necessary for both commercial,
political and military considerations.
The iNtlimlnn Canal.
Ho calls attention to the need of an
Isthmian canal, and says:
"Its Importance to the nation Is by no
means limited merely to Its material ef
fects upon our business prosperity, and
yet with a view to these effects alone It
would bo to the last degree Important
for us Immediately to begin It. While Iti
beneficial effects would perhaps be most
marked upon the Pacific coast and the
gulf and south Atlantic states, It would
also greatly benuflt other sections. It Is
emphatically a work which It Is for thu
Interest of the entire country to begin
and complete nu soon as possible; It Is
one ot those great works which only a
great nation can undcrtnko with pros
pects ot success and which when dune
are not only permanent assets In the na
tion's material Interests, but standing
monuments to Its constructive ability."
Of the new treaty recently concluded
with England he mi a: "1 am glad to be
able to announce to you that our negotia
tions on this subject with Great llrltatn,
conducted on both sides In a spirit of
friendliness and mutual good will nnd re
spect, have resulted In my being ablo to
lay before the senate a treaty which If
ratified' will enablo us to begin preparations
for an Isthmian canal at any time and
which guarantees to this nation eveiy right
thut It has ever asked In connection with
the canal. In this treaty the old Clayton
Uulwer treaty, so long recognized as In
adequate to supply the base for the con
struction and maintenance of a necessarily
American ship canal, Is abrogated. It spe
cially provides that the united States
alone shall do the work of building and
assume tho responsibility of safeguarding
the canal and shall regulate Its neutral use
by all nations Jn terms of equality
without the guarantee or interference
of any outside nation from any quar
ter. The signed treaty will at once
be laid before the senate, and If ap
proved the congress can then proceed to
give effect to the advantages It secures
us by providing for the building of tho
canal."
The Monroe Doctrine,
The president sets forth the objects of
the Monroe doctrine, and the spirit In
which It hag been received hv other
Countries, nh3 fn connection with" It snxs
this nation has not the slightest desire To
acquire nny territory at the expense of
any of our neighbors, nnd cites our atti
tude tnwnrd Cuba as a guarantee of our
good faith. He says nlso that "this
doctrine li'ii nnthlna to do with the com
mercial relations of nny. American power
snve mm u in irutn auows eacn or mam
to form such as It doslrrn." That "we
do not ask for nny exclusive ;ommerclaI
treaty with any other American state."
He says of this:
1 "Tho Monroe doctrine should be the
cardinal feature of the foreign policy of
all the nations of the two Americas us
It Is of the United States. Just "8 years
have passed since President Monroe In
his annual message announced that thft
American continents are henceforth not
to bo considered as subjects for future
colonization by nny European power.' In
other words, the Monroe doctrine Is a
declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any non-Amerl-can
power at the expense of nny Ameri
can power on American soil. It Is In no
wlso Intended as hostile to any. nation In
tho otd world. Still less Is It Intended to
glvn lover to nny aggression by one new
world power at the expense of nny other.
It Is slmplv a step, nnd a long step, to
warJ assuring the universal peace of the
world by securing- the possibility of per
manent psace on this hemisphere."
The Navy.
The president urges the continued up
building of the navy as a means of per
forming our International duties an well as
a protection and safeguard for our Inter
national rights. He urges that our place
as a first-class power necessitates the
building and maintenance of a navy In
keeping with, our place among the nations
of the world, and says:
"So far from being In any way a provo
cation to war, an adequate and highly
trained navy Is the best guarantee against
war, the cheapest and most effective peace
Insurance. The cost of building and main
taining such a navy represents the very
lightest premium for Insuring peace which
this nation can possibly pay."
He recommends both the construction
of more ships and the addition of more
officers and men as absolutely necessary,
and sayi: ,
"There should be no cessation In the
work of completing our navy. So far In
genuity hns been wholly unable tn devise
a substitute for tho great war craft whose
hammering guns beat out the mastery of
the high seas. It Is unsafe and unwise
not to provide this year for several addi
tional bittleshlpi and heavy armored
Trulsers, with auxiliary and lighter craft
n proportion. For the exact number and
character I refer you to the report of the
secretary of the navy. Put there Is some
thing we need even more thnit iddttlnnal
ships, nnd this Is additional .officers and
men. To provide battleships nnd cruis
ers nnd then lay them up, with the ex
pectation of leaving them unmanned un
til they nre needed In actual war, would
be worse than folly. It would be a crime
against the nation,
"To send nny warship against n compe
tent enemy unless those aboard It have
been trained byjrears of "actual sea serv
ice. Including Incessant gunnery prac
tice, would be tn Invito not merely dis
aster, but the bitterest shame nnd humil
iation. Four thousand additional sea
men nnd a thousand additional marines
shoiilil be provided, nnd nn Increase In
tho officers fhould be provided by making
n large addition to the classes at Annap
olis. There Is one small matter which
should be mentioned In connection with
Annapolis. The pretentious and unmean
ing title of "naval cadet' should be abol
ished: tho title of 'midshipman,' full of
historic association, should be reitored.
"We now havo 17 battleships appropri
ated for. of which nine nre compVied
nnd hnvc been commissioned for nctu.il
service. The remnlnlng eight will be
rcadv In from two to four wars but It
will tnke at least that time to recruit nnd
train the men to light them. It Is of vast
concern that wo hnve trained crews ready
for tljp v'sels by tho time they nre com
missioned Good ships nnd good guns nre
simply good weapons, nnd the best
weapon are useless save In the hinds of
men who know how to fight with them
The men must bo trained nn 1 drilled un
der a thorough nnd well-planned system
of progressive Instruction, while the re
cruiting mifst he carried on with still
greater vlgoi. Hvery effort must be made
to exact the mntn function of the oAlccr
the command of men. The ipndlngTgrad
uates of the naval academy should be as
signed to the combatant branches, the
line and marines."
The Army,
No Increase In the regular army Is
deemed necessary at this time, but there
are several changes In that branch of the
government service which the president
recommends to congress Chief of these
Is the establishment of a staff department,
and of thls'he savs:
"A general staff should be created. As
for the general staff and supply depart
ments, they should be tilled by detail,
from the line, the men so detailed return
ing after awhile to their line duties. It Is
very undesirable to have the senior grades
of the army composed ol men who have
come to fill the positions by the mere fact
of seniority. A system should be adopted
by which there shall be an "elimination
grade by grade of those who seem unfit
to render the best service In the next
grade. Justice to the veterans of the
:lvll war who aro still In the army would
seem to require lht In the. matter of re
tirements they be given by law the same
privileges accordedjflo their comrades In
the navy." "
Another recommendation which the pres
ident makes In connection with the army
Is for the reduction of the "paper work"
of the service, known to the publlo as "red
tape." Of this he says: .
"Every effort should bo made to brlns;
the army to a constantly increasing state
of efficiency. When on actual service; no
work save that directly In the line of such
service should be required. The paper
work In the army, as In the navy, should
be greatly reduced. What It needed Is
proved power ot command and capacity
to work well In the Held. Constant care
Is r necessary to prevent dry rot in the
transportatloh and commissary depart
ments." He also urges the enactment of legis
lation In connection with the militia and
national guard forces of the nation that
they may be better fitted for active serv
ice In time of war, and says:
"Our militia law Is obsolete and worth
loss. The organization and armament ot
the national guard of the several states,
which are troated as militia tn the ap
propriations by the congress, should be
made Identical with those provided for
the regular forces. The obligations and
duties of the guard In time of war should
he carefully defined and a system estab
lished by law under which tno method of
procedure of raising volunteer forces
should be prescribed In advance. It Is ut
terly Impossible In the excitement and
haste of Impending wnr to do this satis
factorily If the arrangements have not
been made long beforehand. Provision
should be made for utilizing In the first
volunteer organizations culled out tho
training of those citizens who have al
ready had experience under arms, and
especially for the selection In advance of
the officers of any force, which may be
raised: for careful selection of the kind
necessary Is Impossible after tho outbreak
of war."
He praises the veterans of tho civil war,
tho war with Spain and those who havo
rendered the nation valiant service In the
Ini I nn uprisings of tho west and In tho
Philippines, and counsels continued lib
erality In tho nation's dealing with them.
The Civil Service.
Ho recommends the enactment of legis
lation that will place under tho rulings
of the merit system many classes ot em
ployes not now governed by It. His rec
ommendation for this Is as follows.
"I recommend tho passage of a law
which will extend tho clussltled service to
the District of Columbia or will at least
enable the president thus to extend It.
In my Judgment all luws proviu.ng for
the temporary employment of clerks
should heruarter contain a provision that
they be selected under the civil service
He also wishes the merit system to ob
tain In tho government service In the
colonics, and says:
i,K.N,ot,nn mf. "hould be filled In the
Philippines or Porto Hlco with anyregard
to the man's partisan nfflllatlons or scr
Ices, with uny regard to the political, so
cial or personal Influonco which ho may
hnve ut his command. In short, heed
should be paid to absolutely nothing save
the man's own charades and capacity
and thu needs of tho service. '
"The administration of these Islands
should be as wholly free from the sus
picion of, partisan politics as the admin
istration" of the nrmy and navy All that
wm?hU, rro'n ,.h.'' I'ubllu servant in the
Philippines or Porto Hlco Is that he re
flect Junior on his rim n try by the wu In
which ho makes that country's rule a
benefit to the peoples who have como un
der It. This Is all thut we should usk.
and we cannot afford to be content with
Other neeomiuniiilatious.
Among other recommendations which the
president mnkos are those asking for leg.
jslatlonthatwllllmprovo the consular serv
ice ulong lines outlined In bills introduced
at-prevJouB sessions, and he says that:
u.,s lIu? M'V thl "rvlce Is now In the
main efficient, but a standard of excellence
cannot be permanently maintained until
the principles set forth In the bills here
tofore submitted to the congress on this
subjeot are enacted Into law."
He believes the time has arrived when
the Indian should cease to be treated as a
member of a tribe, but as an Individual,
and recommends breaking up the tribal
funds, putting a stop to the Indiscriminate
permission to Indians to lease the(r allot
ments and stopping the ration system. He
recommends also, the establishment of an
Industrial educational system, and an en
deavor to encourage the Indians to become

Hs i recommends llb.rsl appropriations for
the Louisiana Purchass exposition and an
appropriation covering; expenses Incurred
by the Charleston exposition In removing;
government exhibits from the Buffalo ex
position to that at Charleston.
Another of his recommendations Is for
a permunent census bureau, as It would In
sure better, cheaper and mors satisfactory
work In the Interest of business, statistics,
economic and social science,
Tho PoataJ Isrvloe.
He calls attention to the growth of the
postal svstom and to the fact that ths an
nual deficit In this department of the gov
ernment service has been reduced to ths
small sum of U,23.72T. This, he says, could
further be Increased and possibly a surplus
shown but for the fsct that many publi
cations are now securing; the pound rate
as second-class mail matter which are not
entitled to the same under the law. Of
this he says:
"The full measurs of postal progress
which might be realised has long; been
hampered and obstructed by the heavy
burden Imposed on the government
through the intrenched and well-understood
abuses which have grown In con
nection with second-class mall matter.
The extent of this burden appears when It
Is stated that, while the second-class mat
ter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight
of all tho mall. It paid for the last fiscal
year only tl.29t,445 of the aggregate postal
revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate
of postage, which produces the large loss
thus entailed and which was fixed by the
!ongresi with the purpose of encouraging
the dissemination of public Information,
were limited to the legitimate newspapers
and periodicals actually contemplated by
the law, no just exception could be taken.
That exponse would be tho recognized and
accepted cost of a liberal public policy de
liberately adopted for a Justifiable end.
nut much of tho mntter which enjoys tho
privileged rate Is- wholly outside of the
Intent of the law and has secured admis
sion only through an evasion of Its re
itilromantB or through lax construction.
Tho proportion of such wrongly Included
mntter is estimated by postal experts to
ba one-half of the whole volume of second
class mall. If It be only one-third or one
quarter, the magnitude of the burden Is
apparent. Tho post office department has
now undortaken to remove the abuses so
far ns possible by a stricter application
of the law, and It should be sustained In
ts effort."
Thp Chinese) nilllrnltles.
He rails attention to the satisfactory
nltlpmfnt at the f'hlnnkR llfflrMiHt. nt
nst yt'nr. and this nation's part In the
ettiement, iinu says provisions havo
been mailn for Insuring the future safety
if tho foreign representatives. Of tho
promises made by China ho says:
"Tho Chinese government has agreed to
participate financially In the work of bet
tering the water approaches to Shanghai
ind to Tientsin, the centers of foreign
trade In central and northern China, ami
in International conservancy board. In
which the Chinese government Is largely
eprescnted, has been provided for the
Improvement of the Shanghai river and
the control of Its navigation In the same
line of commercial advantages a revision
jf tho present tariff on Imports has been
issented to for the purpose ot substitute
ng specific for ad valorem duties, and ah
xpert haa been sent abroad on the part
)f the United Slntes to assist In this
work. A list of articles to remain freo of
luty. including flour, cerealH und rice,
rold and silver coin and bullion, has also
oeen agreed upon In the settlement."
In conclusion, he mentions the Pan
merlran congress, now In session nt tho
City of Mexico, and refers to the death of
Queen Victoria nnd the dowager empress
