WILL THE PEOPLE
OF GERMANY AND
AUSTRIA LISTEN?
President's Message Direct
ed to Them Pointedly—If
There Is No Response,
War O-oes o^. Bitterly.
By FRED S. FERGUSON.
Washington, Dec. 6. — America's
cards are on the table.
If Germany Is to escape being crush
ed, she must as freely and frankly
state exactly what she !■ fighting for
as President Wilson outlined the war
alms of the United States.
The way Is open for the German rul
ing powers to lespond—explain to the
German people and the world exactly
what they are fighting for or admit
America's Indictment and fight It out.
The table la likewise waiting for
Great Britain, France and the other
entente powers to put their cards up
on It, as President Wilson displayed
America's.
This, it may be stated. Is the official
view of the presldent'a epochal address
before congress.
DIRECTED TO GERMAN PEOPLE
It Is the most powerful blow of the
political offensive against Germany
that has yet been struck. It was ad
dressed to the German people as much
as the other people of the world.
The war will be considered won
when a peace based on Justice—to ene
my and friend alike—can be made and
guaranteed by 'spokesmen of the Ger
man people whose word we can be
lieve." .
There Is no mistaking the meaning
of President Wilson's outline of Amer
ican war alms.
NO SELFISH AIMS.
American blood Is not to be shed
and American money is not to be Bpent
toward realization of any selfish alms.
The president did not mention the
restoration of Alsace-Lorraine. This
question, according to the official view
today, may take care of Itself when
Germany is brought to the final reck
oning, but the restoration of territory
lost 40 years ago Is not In the cate
gory of American alms.
The preeldent eald nothing of col
onies. Thesa subjects are not consid
ered among essentials of the war.
The président asked for a declaration
of war on Austria. This will be con
sidered by congress Immediately and
voted. But as he asked that Austria
be listed among America's enemies,
he voiced the cause of the dual mon
terms to which this oountry can sub
' archy by declaring that under peace
----_____....
scribe, Austria-Hungary must have
free access to the sea and must be
free of Prussian domination.
DOES NOT FAVOR RUSSIA.
If Italy still maintains ambitions of
obtaining Istrla and Dalmatia In re
turn for her efforts In the war, she
will not find support from this gov
ernment. This would cut Austria off
from the Adriatic.
Authorities pointed out today the
particularly strong bid for the Aus
trian people to assert themselves and
throw off the curse of Hohenzollern
lsm, along with the Germans, while at
the same time the president sought to
swerve Russia to unreserved support
of the allied cause.
And as if speaking to America's al
lies In the war, the president stated
the only antidote to the poison of
falsehood that Is keeping the Rus
sians and Germans In the dark is the
truth.
"It cannot be uttered too plainly or
too often," he pointedly asserted.
THEN A LONG WAR.
If the German people are unable to
respond to the political offensive di
rected against their rulers, and the
German government does not counter
the American statement of war alms
with a declaration recanting arrogant
ambitions of the past—THEN AMER
ICAN OFFICIALS TODAY BEE ONLY
PROLONGED, BITTER WAR AHEAD.
Officials see In a Germany so
crushed by arms that she must, of
military necessity, restore Belgium and
northern Francs, release Austria, Tur
key and the Balkans from her grasp—
a nation beaten to her knees.
FOR AMERICA AND THE ALLIES
THIS MEANS BLOODY SACRI
FICES. It means ths wielding of
every resource to Its utmost capacity.
The huge appropriations this congress
has been asked to approve are an In
dication of the cost In money.
Officials agreed today that America
and the allies will have all they can do
to crush Germany's ambitions of world
military domination and put her back
where she was before she ran rampant
and started the war.
It was explicitly pointed out today
that President Wilson voiced only the
American viewpoint It Is hoped that
the allies will fully subscribe to this
declaration of principles.
DEMAND FOR STATEMENT.
There has been a constantly growing
demand for a clear cut statement of
war alms. This government had hoped
that such a declaration might grow out
of the sessions of the Inter-allied coun
cil and supreme war council meeting
In France.
Colonel House and members of the
American mission gave the unofficial
Russian representative their support
In urging that a Joipt statement if
aims be made as an aid to Russia. This
statement was not forthcoming, but In
the president's speech of yesterday
America has again stepped forward
and taken the lead.

CHICAGO HERALD: "President
Wilson evidently believed the Inter
national situation called for a re
statement and clarification of our po
sition as to war and peace. It may
be summed up In four words: Victory,
reparation, Justice, security."
CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER:
"Although Its conspicuous single fea
ture Is the recommendation that the
mask* of a fictitious peace between
Austria and the United States be torn
off forthwith, the message Is most im
pressive, as a calm Interpretation of
democracy's cause In the war and a
forceful restatement of what America
and Its allies are expending blood and
treasure to accomplish."
NEBRASKA STATE JOURNAL:
"We believe the president has fairly
reflected the spirit of a vast majority
of Americans In this statement of war
alms. We are in the war with all our
strength and will light till the wrong
has been righted and justice done and
our best endeavors given to making a
repetition unlikely. We shall fight
Prussianlsm without becoming Prus
sians. Such a cause and such a spirit
what real American can fail to sup
port with all his heart?"
DENVER NEWS: "They (the Ger
man people) believe In their very
hearts that the German empire Is fnte.d
to rule the world, that the war Is the
noblest purpose ever undertaken and
that German wars, now as In the
past have been to the building of the
nation and the strengthening of their
position. Nothing but defeat, unques

people to their senses and cause them
to realize that their war machine can
not prevail against the world's civili

"Altogether, the message

hour."
DES MOINES REGISTER: "The
president has said the war will be won
and it will be. It Is up to the Ameri
can people to win It. The president's
words will be the words of humanity
when the final demands are made.
President Wilson has become the
spokesman of liberty throughout the
world."
SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE:
"Now that we are at war the president
has made a perfectly clear statement
of our ultimate purposes. The war is
against the German people only inso
far as they Indorse and support the
measures of Prussian autocracy, under
whose tyranny they groan. If they
choose to expel the Hohenzollerns as
the Russians expelled the Romanoffs,
well and good. We will then deal with
the German people."
MILWAUKEE SENTINEL: "The
message breathes the spirit of a lofty
idealism, welded to a stern fixity of
specific purpose."
CHICAGO STAATS ZEITUNG
"President Wilson does not want to
Interfere with the internal affairs of I
Germany; he opposes the present rul

oughly that the peace of the world
cannot again bo destroyed by ambi

MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE RUS

ASSURING Aid- ALLIED PEOPLES
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRINCI
PLES ON WHICH THEY WERE
ASKED BY THEIR CHOSEN GOV
ERNING POWERS TO SACRIFICE
THEIR LIVES, MONEY AND FTtOP
ERTY.
On Nov. 30, 10 days after the United
Press announcement of thia plan of
Joint restatement, the Marquis of
Lansdowne Issued his bombshell let
ter. One of Its main arguments was
that the allies should restate their
alms.
The Inter-allied conference met In
Paris Nov. 29. Delegate Maklakoff,
representing Russia's moderate So
cialists, approved the plan; American
delegates supported it and the British
statesmen were said to be "passively
acquleacent."g The matter -was, how
ever, postponed for later discussion.
APPROVED IN ITALY.
Today the New York Tlmea in
Parle dispatch quoted Minister of Fi
nance Nittl of Italy, known as one of
Italy's strongest political leaders, as
stating "It would be desirable to mako
a frank, unanimous declaration of al
lied war alms," and, again, "too much
harm has been done to the entente
cause already by Imperialist or self
centered war alma of Individual coun
tries."
Today's comment of the Dally News
of Ixmdon on President Wilson'» relt
oration of American war aims, urges
England to adopt that course. The
Dally News Is a Liberal newspaper of
radical tendencies and great strength.
ASQUITH'S POSITION.
A dispatch from London quotes the
Manchester Guardian today as predict
ing that former Premier Aaqutth when
he speaks at Birmingham, will be
"sympathetic" to I-ansdowne's letter
that ie, he will also approve a restate
ment of alms.
This would mean the greatest of
England's Liberal leaders would thus
Indorse the plan.
Congress Begins Briskly to
Carry Into Effect Main
Recommendations by
President Wilson.
Rough Sledding, However,
for His Plan to Centralize
Authority for Expendi
tures—Present Money
Spenders Strongly Object.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Congress to
day set out to make law out of Pres
ident Wilson's war message. Immed
iate declaration of war on Austria
Hungary, first of the president's re
commendations, will come probably
before the week-end.
Formal draft of the war resolution
against the "vassal of Prussian
autocracy" was to be made by the
house foreign affairs committee this
afternoon and will be ready for house
consideration tomorrow.
Senator Stone, chairman of the for
eign relations committee, called It to
meet tomorrow and expects to report
a resolution when the senate meets
next Friday.
WOULD INCLUDE TURKEY.
That the war declarations will pass,
nearly unanimously, In both houses is
not questioned. Some members, how
ever, will make a determined fight to
embrace In it rIbo Bulgaria and Tur
key. Senator Lodge, Massachusetts is
expected to lead this fight.
"I have not changed my view," he
said. "I have felt all along that we
should declare war on Austria, Turkey
and Bulgaria. As I said before, it is
essential to allied unity that we all
fight the same enemies."
MERE GERMAN TOOLS.
Other lenders, however, said that In
view of the president's statement that
Turkey and Bulgaria are mere tools of
Germany and "do not yet stand in the
direct path of our necessary action,"
congress will leave them out for the
present.
The house of representatives, mark
ing time while the war resolution
against Austria was being rolled out
in committee, swung Into routine at
noon today. Several minor bills, ear
ried over from the special session,
were in line for consideration.
Aside from national prohibition and
woman suffrage legislation, which will
be carried away by the Christmas re
I cess, leaders will confine rigidly to the
win-the-war measures.
BOTH SUFFRAGE AND PROHIBI
TION APPEAR LIKELY TO PASS.
IN THE HOUSE AT LEAST.
ENEMY ALIENS.
Anti-enemy alien legislation, exten
sion of price fixing and conservation
of national resources will have early
call on the legislative schedule.
The giant money measures, both for
raising revenue and appropriating It,
are not expected until later in the ses
slon.
The single recommendation by the
president which, it appears, may have
rough sledding is his suggestion for a
single committee to "initiate and pre
pare" all appropriation bills to "cen
ter responsibility, '■tandardize ex
penditure and avoid waste." Many
committees now spending public mon
eys promise to balk at this blow to
their powers.
His approval of the Webb bill, al
lowing export trade combinations, may
save that .measure.

union meeting.
I.abor leaders were unable to esti
mate the number of union men who
had left their Jobs to attend the con
vention. Some said 7000 In St. Paul
alone had quit. Minneapolis labor
leaders said that "thousands of men"
were not at work today. Labor lead
ers said that a thousand more men
would quit as soon as a format strike
order had been issued.
RAILROAD SHOPMEN OUT.
Shopmen from the Omaha, Minneap
olis & St. Louis and Soo line shops to
day walked out to attend the "eonttn
uous convention." Work in the shops
of these lines Is greatly Impaired.
Some believe this action would speed
federal Intervention.
Over 250 union milk men walked out'
in Minneapolis, refusing to make their
morning deliveries today in sympathy
with the lookod-out street car men.
RESPECT FOR GRAY HAIRS.
A street car was stopped near tho
state capitol in St. Paul today. When
union sympathizers noticed the gray
hair of the non-union conductor as he
took off his cap and whiatled "Darling
I Am Growing Old." they paased op
without molesting the car.
Declaring that a crowd eeeembllng at
the Audltoriupi for the prize flglits to
night might cause trouble, the 8L Paul
association today prepared a petition,
asking for cancellation of the bouta.
Benny Leonard, world's lightweight
champion from New York, Is slated to
box Gene Delmont of Memphis.
THOUSANDS LEAVE WORK.
Fifteen thousand union men were
estimated this afternoon to have left
their work In various Industries, to at
tend the "continuous convention" In
the municipal auditorium, as a protest
against the discharge of 1000 street car
men for wearing union badges. An
account could not be obtained, as there
Is no formal strike. Both St. Paul and
Minenapolls are affected about equally.
Home guard companies from several
sections of Minnesota patrolled the
downtown streets.
Saloons In West St. Paul, a suburb,
were closed by Governor Burnqulst's
order. Saloons in the Twin cities re
mained closed.
J. M. Clancy, president of the St.
Paul Trades & Labor assembly, ad
dressed the "continuous convention,"

controversy.

direction of the German depot city. The
Germans' objectives were not even
reached.
BREAK THAT DID NOT COME.
The completeness of the failure of
the German plans was illustrated in
prisoners' statements today that the
German Uhlans (cavalry), were held
for days In readiness behind the lines
for the break In the British front that
the Gormans schemed to attain, but
which they did not achieve.
The artillery fire In tho whole Cam
brai sector was increasing today and
the massing of more Infantry forces
forecast another drive. The German
reinforcements have come from various
parts of the western front.
LIGHTER GUN WORK.
I was in Flanders Sunday during a
local British advance In the Pass
ehendaele region, and at that time
comment was evoked on the fact that
the German barrage was nine minutes
late and much lighter in force than
that In any previous fighting.
The answer was apparent—either the
Brtttsli guns had knocked the enemy
artillery or the Germans had been
withdrawing their pieces for use on
another front. The latter was un
doubtedly the correct assumption.

restatement, of nllled war aima
The Daily News editorial comment
practically Indorsed that plan. Other
newspapers. Joining In the general
chorus of hearty approval of the whoi«
tone of the Wilson address. Indicated
their belief in the necessity for a re
pledging of the hosts of democracy.
As stated exclusively in these dis
patches a short time ago, Colonel
House Is known to have presented to
British officials President Wilson's ur
gent suggestion for a sorting of war
aims, a compilation of those to which
every ally could subscribe, a discard
ing of those to which all could not
pledge their force and finally Issuance <
of a Joint pledge by the allies of com
posite war alms.
The matter presumably was taken
up in the Paris inter-allied councils
but was temporarily put aside for more
physical war measures. Judging from
the reception of President Wilson's
address today, the plan will be brought
to the fore today.
The Daily News comment today was
practically an Indorsement of the
Vmerlcan repledging plan.
EFFECT ON RUSSIA IF—
"If the president could have said
earlier what he said today," the edi
torial declared, "and If in Britain and
France and Italy the responsible lead
ers «of these nations had made his
language their own, Russia might to
day be driving the German armlet
from her borders.
"The demand for a statement of war
aims has been repeated and Insistent.
In the light of Mr. Wilson's speech, a
statement which will mean wiping off
the slate of much that ought never to
have been written on it Is imperative.
There can be no kinship between tb«
spirit of yesterday's speech and th»
spirit of knockout blows or of econom
ic warfare or of post-war boycotts."
The Daily News held up the presi
dents speech to more praise than it
has greeted any previous utterance of
an American executive Judging it "an
other example of comprehension by
which he clarified fundamental issue»
of the war."
"It would be affectation to preteni
that the speech echoes the declarations
of allied statesmen." the editorial con
tinued. ''His vision comprehends the
world: theirs' only half."
A3 TO GERMAN PEOPLE.
The Times still refused today t<
agrte with the president's differentia
tion between the German government
and the German people.
"President Wilson, the Thunderer,
said, "has restated the allies' purposs
with uncompromising for re. With a
straightforward statement of war aims
the last hope» of the pacifists must
founder."
"As a reaffirmation of previous war
utterances, the speech Is of first class
importance." asserted the Chronicle.
"Clear, fur-sighted and statesman
like," was the Express' opinion.
Practically every editorial referred
to the message as the most emphatic
announcement of America's determin
ation to wage war to the limit. The
president's recommendation that war
be declared on Austria was regarded
as one further evidence of this Inflex
ible determination.
