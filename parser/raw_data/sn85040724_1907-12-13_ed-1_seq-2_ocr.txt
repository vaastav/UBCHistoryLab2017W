Whiskers.
Whiskers, which are today objects of
derision, were in the past held in al
most reverent esteem. Indeed, in some
countries, they are still held in almost
reverent esteem. The following are some
queer whisker facts:
The young Roman made a religious
ceremony of his lirst shave, preceding
it with prayer, and following it with a
sumptuous feast, almsgiving, and a
dance. Nero sealed the first down
sinned from his chin in a gold box set
with pearls, and consecrated the stuff
to .Inpit?r Capitolinas.
Willium the Conqueror punishc 1 rebel
lions Srixons by compelling them • o shave
off their beards. Many Saxons, rather
thatS endure such an humiliation, aban
doned all they possessed and fled the
ci#nntry.
The Catti. an ancient German tribe,
would not allow a youth to shave till
he had slain an enemy.
In the middle age men gilded their
beards as a sign of mourning. Tlie
Duke of Lorraine walked in the funeral
procession of Charles the Rash with his
beard covered with gold leaf.
It is tin act of courtesy in Turkey for a
host to sprinkle scent over the beards
of bis guests.
Peter the Great levied a large tax on
beards.
The kings of Persia in the past knotted
their beards with gold thread and but
toned them with square gold buttons.

SWEDEN MOURNS
HER DERD KING
NATION 10WED IN GRIEF WHEN OS
CAR SUCCUMBS AND NEW
RULER ASCENDS.
WAS MOST BELOVED MONARCH
Prince Gustave a Strong-Minded Young
Man Upon Whom All Factions in
Kingdom Will Unite.
NO FUNERAL PREPARATIONS YET.
STOCKHOLM, Dec. 9.—Oscar 11..
King of Sweden, died at 9:10 o’clock
Sunday morning. The death of the ven
erable monarch occurred in the royal
apartment of the palace, where, sur
rounded by the members of his family,
including the aged Queen Sophia and
the crown prince, Oscar Gustav, and
high ministers of state, the inevitable
end had been awaited, while outside the
palace great crowds stood with bowed
heads and tearful eyes long after the
announcement came of the death of their
well loved sovereign.
The whole country is bowed with
grief. When the tiag on the palace was
dipped to half mast there was a moan
of anguish from the assembled multitude
any many cried, "Our dear old King is
dead.”
Son Becomes King in Fact.
The succession to the throne of Swe
den has already passed to Oscar Gustav
Adolphe, duke of Vermland, the oldest
son of the late King.
At a meeting of the council of state
the new King took the oath of allegiance
under the title of Gustav V. and adopted
the motto. “With the People for the
Fatherland.”
The princes then took the oath of al
legiance and the new monarch accepted
the homage of the state officials.
The last hours of the expiring mon
arch were passed in unconsciousness and
Up to the end he gave no sign of recog
nizing those about him. The Queen was
grief-stricken because he could not bid
her farewell.
In the palace courtyard in the dim
cold gray mist stood a crowd of school
boys, King Oscar’s most devoted friends.
Here they had stood for hours, blue and
shivering, watching the palace flagstaff.
There also gathered many old men and
women in rags, whom, the King had al
ways stopped to comfort with mild words
and generous alms when he met them in
the parks or streets, their faces tear
stained because their beloved King and
benefactor was dying.
Flag Falls as King Dies.
Suddenly the flag dropped to half mast
and a wail of misery and sorrow arose.
f
NEW KING OF SWEDEN.
The old folk clasped their hands and
prayed and wept aloud and the school
boys' lamentations were pitiful to hear.
In a room near the death chamber the
first marshal of the court read to the
cabinet a draft of the new King's procla
mation to the Swedish people.
One by one the ships in the harbor
and the buildings throughout the city
displayed the flag at half mast, and the
people soon crowded the streets and open
places near the palace, but all spoke
in whispers, bearing witness to the kind
liness of him who bad departed and to
the love they bore him.
In the death chamber knelt the heart
broken Queen, and gathered about her
were her children, grandchildren, and
great-grandchildren, praying for strength
to bear their affliction. The church bells
began to toll and the minute guns
boomed. All Sweden mourned its loss.
SWEDEN’S NEW KING.
Prince Gustavus and His View's of Gov
ernment and His Life.
Crown Prince Gustavus of Sweden dif
fered from his father. King Oscar, in pos
sessing little or no taste for literature or
for science. Instead of being a theorist and
a dreamer, he is essentially a man of ac
tion, all the romance that he may have In
herited having been stamped out of his na
ture when he was forced as a young man
to break off the engagement which he had
made to marry the daughter of a Swedish
country pastor with whom he had become
Infatuated, and to wed, not for love, but
merely for state and dynastic reasons, the
by no means attractive daughter of the
Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Baden.
The crown princess shares with her
mother-in-law, the Queen of Sweden, the
disadvantage of being subject to hypo
chondria. More or less imaginary ailments
have ended by impairing not alone her
physical condition, hut likewise her mind,
and for years she has been accustomed to
spend ten months of every twelve either In
the south of France or in Egypt, her hus
band, her children and the people of her
adopted country seeing her but seldom. In
fact, it is no exaggeration to assert that
she is almost a stranger to them.
Gustavus a Big Fellow.
Gustavus is as tall as his father, though
somewhat less broad and stalwart. That
is to say, he stands considerably over six
feet and would possess an imposing pres
ence were It not for the shortness of his
sight, which forces him to wear glasses,
the latter naturally detracting from his
military appearance. But for this he would
present a striking resemblance to his great
grandfather. the famous French Marshal
FINED FOR MISLEADING GIRL.
Saloon, Flat and Milwaukee Experience
Costs Man S2OO.
CHICAGO. 111., Dec. 9.—Ernest Ruehl, 23
years old, 3751 Lake avenue, was fined
S2OO and costs by Municipal Judge Sadler
for contributing to the debauch of Eva
Roundtree, IS years old. Ralph Lamme, 21
years old. 4316 Calumet avenue, was al
lowed to go on the payment of 85 and
costs.
James E. Gleason, another man who was
with the girl during the “celebration," was
not punished, as he took her to Milwaukee
and married her,
Ruehl and Gleason took the girl to a
flat in Thirty-third street, according to the
testimony. Next day they went to Milwau
kee. where the wedding took place. Lamme
was arrested while with the girl Friday,
but he had nothing to do with the Milwau
kee episode.
Eva Roundtree Gleason testified that she
knew nothing from the time she was drink
ing in a south side saloon until she awoke
in the flat next morning.
Lusitania’s Trip Rough.
NEW YORK. Dec. 9. —Showing every evi
dence of terrific pounding at sea, the Lusi
tania docked at 3:4b o’clock Sunday after
noon. more than two days late. She had
been heavily batteM-d by waves and one
comber hit her wlrti amazing force. TUe
wave deafed the steel sheathing- around
the captain's quarters for twenty feet. The
&reat ship tossed so much almost every -
ody aboard became seasick.

Sweden was horn being still shown to tour

| In addition to being short-sighted. Gus
tavus suffers from that curious physical
defect known as barred teeth, which sut>-
* ject him at time to perfect martyrdom,
and he is constantly In the hands of the
most eminent dentists in Europe. Indeed,
of all the royal patients of the late Dr.
Thomas Evans, the Crown Prince of Swe
den was the one who stood in the most
frequent and constant need of his services.
Great Admirer of Kaiser.
Gustavus is on terms of the most inti
mate friendship with Emperor William.
The latter has no more enthusiastic ad
mirer than the prince, who, in the heliet
probably that imitation is the most sln
| cere form of flattery, has adopted many
of his German cousin’s traits and charac
teristics. He, too. believes, like the Kai
ser, that The mailed fist is preferable to
the velvet glove in solving difficulties, and
some years ago he availed himself of the
opportunity of some public meeting at
Stockholm openly to express his opinion
that the only way of putting an end to the
quarrel between Norway and Sweden was
by force, and added that he asked nothing
better than to be intrusted with the com
mand of the* Swedish army for the task
| of reducing his father’s rebellious and dis
loyal subjects in Norway to entire submis
sion. As soon as the tenor of tills ex
traordinary speech became known at <’hris
tiania the Storthing, or national legisla
ture. which happened to be in session at
the time, immediately passed by an almost
unanimous vote a measure suspending until
further notice the payment of the Norwe
i gian money of the civil list of the crown
| prince, the Norwegians taking the ground
i that it was ridiculous to subscribe to the
j maintenance of a prince who publicly ex
pressed the wish to lead a Swedish 'army
of invasion into Norway.
Much pressure was brought upon the
crown prince, even by his father, to re
tract his remarks, or at any rate in some
way to smooth them over.
Has Support of His People.
Gustavus is the first of his line to enjoy
the support and the consideration of the
Swedish aristocracy. The latter is among
the proudest, most influential and exclusive
in Europe, but made a point of holding
■ aloof from King Oscar ami his three predc
j censors on account of the peasant blood In
their veins and of their plebeian origin.
They cannot forget that Marshal Berna
dette. the first King of the ; resent line,
owed his rise in lift* to the revolution, that
he had taken part in the massacres of the
French aristocracy and royal family, and
that at Jtis death the words “Death to the
tyrants and to the aristocrats” were found
tatooed on his. arm. for which reason he
had always refused to allow his physicians
to bleed him.
Gustavus is regarded as having to a
great extent eliminated the peasant strain
of blood from his veins, and can rely upon
the support of the entire Swedish people.
New Queen of Sweden.
Victoria, as the consort of Gustavus, is
as well fitted as her husband to play the
j part of u ruler. She had many advantages
|of education, being the favorite grand
daughter of the Empress Augusta, wife of
I Kaiser Wilhelm I. of Germany. The Grand
j Duchess of Baden, Victoria’s mother, was
! tlie daughter of Augusta. Victoria is thus
i the cousin of the present ruler of Ger
j many.
j The new Queen of Sweden is a talented
i woman, being an admirable musician, an
artist and a writer. It was early seen by
j her parents that Victoria was to he a prin
| cess of high attainments and her education
I was planned with the view of developing
her talents to the full. The practical side
I of a woman’s education, however, was not
\ overlooked. Following the example set by
King Edward and Queen Alexandra with
their daughters, the Grand Duke and Duch
ess of Baden saw to it that their daughter
received a thoroughly practical training.
She was taught how to sew and darn, how
i to make butter and how to man
i ago a house. She was also taught to cook,
and for cookery she displayed a natural
aptitude which made her a past master at
the culinary art. She has always retained
a fondness for cooking, and even yet exer
-1 vises her skill in tills direction. Asa girl
she used frequently to indulge her taste for
cooking, and would often make dainty
dishes for Kaiser Wilhelm’s breakfast, as
well as supplying the cakes for afternoon
coffee.
Pair Have Thiee Children, All Boys.
The marriage of Gustavus took place on
j September UO. 1881. Three sons were born
to Gustavus and Victoria. Prince Gustav
! us Adolf, the present crown prince, was
: horn November 11. 1882, being given me
i title of the Duke of Scania. The other two
sons of the new King and Queen are Prince
i Wilhelm, Duke of Sodermanlaud. horn
June 17. 1884, and Prince Erik. Duke of
I Vestmanland, horn April 20, 1889.

STATE CAN'T FORCE
TRAINS TO STOP
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
HANDS DOWN IMPORTANT
RAILROAD DECISION.
MAY AFFECT WISCONSIN.
Held That Commission Cannot Force In
terstate Trains to Stop at Small
Stations.
INTERFERENCE WITH COMMERCE.
WASHINGTON. D. C., Dec. 9
[Special.]—The United States supreme
court ruled today that a slate railway
commission cannot force a railroad com
pany to stop its fast trains at small sta
tions. when those trains are engaged
in interstate business.
This decision, which is important, as
it may affect many rulings of the Wis
consin railway commission in similar ac
tions. was in the case of the Atlantic
Coast Line company vs. the Board of
Railroad Commissioners of South Caro
lina.
Small Town Wanted Service.
The suit arose in connection with an
effort on the part of the citizens of
Latta, S. C., to secure the stopping on
being flagged of two such trains which
daily pass through the town, and the
commission ordered that stops should be
made whenever the signal should be
hoisted. The railroad company resist
ed the ruling as unreasonable and as an
interference with interstate commerce.
The state supreme court decided
against the company and it immediately
appealed to the supreme court of the
I idled States with the result that the
relief sought was obtained.
Victory for Railroad.
The opinion of the court was delivered
by Justice Peckham and reversed the de
cision of the South Carolina court. The
opinion held the order of the commis
sion to be an interference with inter
state commerce.

matic conditions. liis address was re
ceived with applause.
Low den Pleads for Chicago.
Upon Illinois being reached Repre
sentative Lowden, the committeeman
from that state presented the claims of
Chicago. Mr. Lowden said that Chicago
being practically the center of popula
tion was the best plaoe jfor holding tliq
convention. He believed tiie rank amlj
file of the Republican party desired Chi 1
cago and that the newspapermen from
experience in the past would testify to
its desirability as a place for sending
out dispatches. Mr. Lowden closed by
quoting a telegram from Messrs Samuel
I). Raymond and F. I>. Uphain, guar
anteeing the expenses of the convention
His remarks were applauded.
Kansas City Men Argue.
T. J. Akins, member from Missouri,
spoke briefly for Kansas City and then
introduced Senator Warner of that state*,
who, he said, was one of the fruits of
the Republican victory in Missouri three
years ago.
Senator Warner received vociferous
applause. He said Kansas City had a
hall which could easily accommodate
21,900 people. Senator Warner said
that Missouri had eighteen electoral
votes; that he had labored for twenty
four years to place that state in the
Republican column; that success had
been achieved in 1904, when the state
gave Theodore Roosevelt 25,000 and
while that it was not now assuredly a
Republican state, it was in the doubtful
column. Senator Warner believed it
would help Missouri as a doubtful state
if Kansas City were chosen.
In answer to a question by Senator
Scott as to whether all delegates of
whatsoever color would be taken care
of in a dignified manner. Senator War
ner said that if he did not feel perfect
ly to guarantee that they would he
he would stand before the committee
ard protest against the convention going
to Kansas City.
Cash Guarantee Made.
Representative Bartholdt seconded
Mr. Warner’s speech.
Ex-Mayor J. H. Neff of Kansas City
guaranteed ail legitimate expenses inci
dent to the holding of the convention in
the maximum amount of $75,000 and
furnished a certified check for $50,000
as an evidence of good faith.
Henry M. Beardsley, mayor of Kan
sas City, and National Committeeman
Mulvane strongly pleaded for Kansas
City.
At 11:45 the call of states was con
cluded and the hall cleared of outsiders
preparatory to taking the ballot.
There was some sparring over the
method of voting but. the balloting pro
ceeded quickly with the result that a few
minutes after 12 o’clock the choice was
known. Chicago had made good and
the triumph was recognized by Kansas
City and Denver, whose advocates re
sponded to a demand to name the Jake
city by acclamation. This was done
anrd enthusiasm. Everybody seemed
satisfied with Chicago. June 16, as tue
place and time of meeting.

MOTHER OF MR. TAFT EXPIRES.
OX BOARD THE STEAMER PRES
IDENT GRANT, IN THE ENGLISH
CHANNEL, Dec. 9.—(by wireless tele
graph to London.) —Mrs. Taft, wife of
the American secretary of war, joined
her husband on board this steamer early
this morning at Boulogne. On the trip
out on a harbor tender the party had tin
exceedingly narrow escape from being
w reeked.
Tender Awaits Steamer.
Mrs. Taft. Mrs. George Post Wheeler,
wife of the second secretary of
the American embassy at Tokio.
and l lie other passengers for the
President Grant, boarded the len
der Holland last night within the
harbor works of Boulogne. Very heavy
seas were reigning outside and this
layed the departure, but at half past 1
this morning, it being supposed that the
President Grant was inside the break
water. the Holland started out to take
the passengers alongside. Soon alter
leaving it was discovered that the steam
er had not come inside.
Passengers in Grave Peril.
The Holland got caught in the heavy
seas. A giant wave broke her rudder
and the small tender drifted helplessly
in the darkness. She was tossed about
on the waves like a cork, and rolled
almost on her beam ends. There was
danger of capsizing or of being dashed
upon the rocks. The passengers were
thrown about in every direction. Mrs.
Taft and Mrs. Wheeler were crouching
in the captain’s cabin when some fix
tures above them came down with a
crash. Fortunately, they were not in
jured.
Boat Finally Anchors.
Near the lighthouse the Holland man
aged to get ti grip with an anchor and
this improved the situation. Repairs
were hurriedly made. The President
Grant came in at 3 o'clock and the pas
sengers from the tender were transferred
without further incident.
France Expresses Regret.
Among those who came off on the Hol
land were M. Riscliniami, sub-prefect of
Boulogne, who greeted Secretary Taft
in the name of France. The suit-pre
fect expressed his regret tit the ill-limed
start of the Holland. Secretarv Taft
made tin appropriate reply, expressing
his deep appreciation of tin* consideration
of the French government and regretting
that the change of plans had made it
necessary for him to abandon his pro
posed visit to Paris.
The President Grant is eight hours be
hind her schedule lutcau.se of the storm.
After taking on the Boulogne passengers
the steamer sailed for Plymouth.

MINERS GATHER RIFLES
Detective Patrol Discovers Hidden Guns
—Non-union Men May Operate
Goldfield Mines.
GOLDFIELD, Ncv., Dec. 9.—While
Goldfield seems to be in peace, it is
evident that the death struggle between
the mining operators and the radical
members of the Western Federation of
Miners is reaching a crisis.
That the miners have armed them
selves to resist the federal soldiers if
necessary to hold their power in the
camp was proven by the finding of a
store of rifles cached within a short
distance of the town.
Capt. Sage of the Consolidated Mines
company detective patrol was the one
who found the hidden arms. There were
KKJ rides of the latest and most deadly
kind in the pile. This is only a part of
tlie arms and ammunition which the
miners have collected during the iast few
days.
Despite the warlike mood of the strik
ers. Capt. William Cox, the representa
tive of Gov. Sparks in Goldfield, states
that the Mine Owners’ association will
attempt, during the week, to reopen the
mines here with non-union men. This
information has been communicated to
the governor. It is thought plenty of
non-union men can be hired here.

Rockford Young Women First Foreigners
on Summit.
MEXICO CITY, Mex., Dec. 9. Two
plucky American young women, Miss Hor
tense Edy and Miss Octave Woodward or
Rockford, 111., have just made a successful,
ascent of Popocatepetl volcano. They were
the first foreigners, either man or woman,

The weather was severe on the summit of
the mountain and the other members of the
party and the guides declined to make the
ascent. Misses Edy and Woodward went,
on alone and after several hours of hard
work and many thrilling experiences they,
reached the crest of the crater of the vol
cano.
By this time the snow storm, which bad/
whirled about them during their ascent, bad
given way to clear skies, and they obtained;
a magnificent view of the valley of Mexico.
They made the descent without accident.
