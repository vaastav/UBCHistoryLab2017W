ROOSEVELT, THE MAN
THERE is a note of Hamlet's soliloquy about the president's
message. Here in good set phrase are itemized the oppressor's
wrong, the proud man's 1 contumely, the law's delay and the
whips and scorns that patient merit of the unworthy takes, only
there is no hint of the bare bodkin. Roosevelt is not that sort. v He
is militant, robustious, ami everywhere at the same moment. He
will lake his place in history as one of the great presidents, a man
of wider, more embracing and eager human sympathy than any of
his predecessors but Lincolnr
He keeps things moving. For him hope springs eternal. The
complex problems, the conflict of classes, the striving for selfish
advantage that discourage and dismay certain finicky philosophers
bate him no jot of heart or hope. He is quite as ready to tackle the
trusts as he might be to meet a grizzly bear.
Roosevelt is not hidebound. He carries an open mind and
listens to reason. If there is any good to be, said of the trusts and
the big combinations he is s always ready to weigh and digest the
plea for what it may be worth. He is in nowise wedded to a
prejudice and is willing to hear the other side..
The message of Tuesday offers a fair example of the president's
spirit and method. He sees that the man who preaches class hatred
is as wicked as the' grafter, and he insists on the control of the great
aggregations of capital by wise laws and a just administration. Of
course, the overwhelming problem of the age comes in dealing with
the great corporations in such way that industry shall not be ham
pered nor oppression permitted. To curb greed and the selfish use
of great power with one hand, and with the other to help the
individual initiative and encourage the natural enterprise of the
American spirit is the job that Roosevelt sets for himself. By way*
of example, consider his plan for dealing with railroads 1 . We quote :
The raihvajs of the country should be put completely under the inter
state commerce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust
law. The power of the commission should be made thorough going, so that
it could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of securities,
as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least,
this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial opera
tions and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features
in recent legislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements
should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the com
mission being first gained and the combination or" agreement being published
in all its details. In the interest of the public the representatives of the
public should have complete power to see that the railroads 'do their duty
by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised
?o as to see that no injustice is done to the railroads. The share holders, the
employes and the shippers all have interests that must be guarded. It is to
the interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation, should be
allowed and that there should be no: improper issuance of securities.. The
guiding intelligence necessary for the successful building and successful man
agement of railroads should receive ample remuneration; but no man should
be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of fraudulent
overcapitalization and kindred stock gambling performances; there must be
no defrauding of investors, oppression of the farmers and businessmen who
fhip freight, or callous disregard of the rights and needs of the employes.
Thus the president would "put the railroads outside of the
operation of the law against trusts. He would permit combinations
and traffic agreements, but would insist on "the fullest : publicity as
to all details of financial'and executive management. All the opera
tions of the roads; the use of capital and methods for raising the
same, would be made subject to the control of the interstate com
merce commission. In a word, the inflexible and inelastic rule laid
down in the Sherman law would be substituted by a wide discretion
placed in the commission-as impartial umpire between the agencies of
transportation and the people who use them.
It is this disposition to see and consider both sides of a question
and to seek for a reasonable way out of a* difficulty that characterizes
i and inspires Roosevelt's method. He hates' injustice but welcomes
the extenuating circumstances, and when it- comes, to make up the
final account of his stewardship the American people will say, "This
was a man; take him for all in all we shall not look upon his like
again. He had the' defects of his great and/splendid qualities and
we loved him for one and for the other."
CONGRESSIONAL INSURGENTS
lib opposition to- the re-election of Speaker Cannon by the
house of representatives has disappeared, and indeed never
had a formidable backing. At the same time there is a govern
ing belief that excessive power has been placed in this office and
that important limitations are desirable. The supremacy of the
speaker in matters of legislation has grown by a process of evolution.
The house of representatives is the largest parliamentary body in the
world in point of numbers, arid by consequence its deliberative
functions ay an open forum for discussion have become practically
impossible, ti there is to be deliberation it must be, done in com
• jnittcc.
The speaker names, all the committees- and .is therefore able' to
exercise a powerful influence on the earh r stages of legislation. But
that, is only the beginning. The/unwieldy size of the house makes
it necessary, to regulate in advance the order of business, the time
assigned for bills and the speakers to be recognized. This 1 is some
thing like what politicians call the "program" and it is capable; of
gross abuse of power. The settlement of the program is intrusted
to the committee on rules, a body of five members with the speaker
for chairman and his colleagues selected by hiniself. This com
mittee has absolute power of life and death over legislation. Tliey
can deny a measure the. right of consideration by: the house. The
".committee, is,, of couxsc^ subjpct to the.sja^ajkcr'.s .will and him.
EDITORIAL PAGE
an absolute veto powerr The president's veto can be overridden by
congress, but the speaker's 1 veto is final. Now it is proposed to take
the organization of the committee on rules out of the speaker's
hands and have the members elected by the house. This method
would effect a radical change of control and would clearly be an
improvement on the present plan, but it is quite doubtful whether
the opposition to Cannon is strong enough to effect the cHange.
They say there is nothing personal about the proposition and that
it is only dictated by good public policy, but the chances are that
Joe Cannon would discipline them for insubordination.
rr TT > HE Oregon, political situation attracts attention all over \ the
| country-because it is unusual and, indeed, unprecedented. At
- the -direct primary last summer the voters declared in favor
of Governor Chamberlain for election to the office of United States
senator, to be chosen by the incoming legislature. Chamberlain is
a democrat, although the state is nominally republican.by a large
majority. The legislature will be' of the same political faith by a
proportional majorit) r , but the members are pledged under: Oregon
law to vote for, senator in accordance with the mandate of the people
delivered at the primary. It is a device to compel the election of
senators by popular vote. But the republican members of the legis
lature,,or some of them, are restive under their pledge. They do riot
want to vote for a democrat if they can find another way|Out." In a
word, they want to break their pledges. All sorts of special pleading
is current in Oregon to : justify or palliate" the proposed breach of
faith, but it is all a pretty cheap sort of stuff, and wholly 'discreditable.
In the effort to get some sort ; of .moral support for. the wotildbe
pledge breakers' Senator Fulton journeyed to Hot Springs in the
hope of persuading Taft . to lend his approval to pledge, breakers.
The effort, of course, proved fruitless: The strange thing is that it
should ever have been made.' It: is evidence of a radical misunder
standing of Taft's character to suppose for an instant that he would
lend approval to deliberate pledge breaking: ,
The politics of Oregon legislatures have been pretty rotten in
the past, and there is some speculation as to whether the incoming
body will break the record cither way. '

THE INSIDER
Recalls Dr. Blue's experience with clubwomen
in the early stage of the anti-plague war
and how the death of a pet aroused interest
Surgeon Helped by
: Sad End of a Dog
j worker, Dr Rucker, and that phase of this matter 13 causing any amount ot
regret.. Both are particular favorites with the clubwomen o£ the city, who
threw themselves heart and/soul iuto the -campaign waged against the rat.
At first they were very chilly 'in their attitude and an axntzsing tale b told
of one of the earlier meetings.
The clubwomen had been called together to hear addresses on the
dangers of the plague. President Moore of the chamber of commerce had
told the" hundred or more women in impressive language what te feared
for- San Franciico if steps were not taken to keep the covers on garbage
cans and maintain immaculate meat safes and that sort of thing. Dr. Blue
had explained with languid grace that he wouldn't let the fleet come here if
we were not good, and other leading citizens had, made other alarming state
ments, but the women remained merely politely interested.
Finally* a quiet littla woman arose in the audience and said timidly: "I
don't believe you ladies realize just what plague means. I was in Honolulu,
and saw something of it there, and"— with a suspicion of a sob — "it can
bring sadness very quickly. I had a dear little dog. We loved her "so
devotedly, and she fell a victim to the dread disease." Her voice broke here
and after a pause to recover she went on: "We realized that she had the
plague." Just here Dr. Blue, who had been meditating on things far distant,..
awoke to a consciousness of her remarks and began to listen intently.
', "We did everything. we could for her for three days," she »aid in a. y
shaking voice. "We made her little bed as soft a3 we could and tried to
keep down her fever, but it was no use. She died!" And these remembrances
brought her to tears and caused murmurs of soft voiced sympathy from the
other women. Some one arose and said: "It's this sort of thing that brings
it home to us. The loss of our own dear little pets" — and -then motions
were passed and all manner of work was begun.
When Dr. Blue met Dr. Rucker a little later he said: "There's a woman,
we ought to get to speak for us, Rucker. She's a wonder — told some story
about her child's death and got all the other women going right away."
Dr.'Rucker had heard of the story in its entirety and he looked at Dr. Blue
regretfully.: "I hate to tell you, old man," he said, **but that was her dog
she was talking about."
"Oh, the devil!" was the disgusted response of the eminent rodentologist,
and Dr. Rucker had another tale to add to his list of good one?.
