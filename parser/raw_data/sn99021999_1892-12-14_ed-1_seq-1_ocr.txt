WASIIISOTOS , I ) . C. , Dec. in. The house
Aliened today with n sharp contest between
the ways and means and appropriations
committees , but It was brief and decisive
and resulted In a victory for the former com
mittee For some time there has been a lit
tle rivalry between these two great commit
tees of the house , and when the matter of
ascertaining the condition of the treasury
umler llm operation of the McKlnluy law
became a pertinent question Immediately
after election this rivalry was accentuated
by the dispute- to which committee should
conduct the invcstlg.ulon. Mr. Dockery ol
the appropriations committee introduced : '
resolution assigning this duty tb the coni'
mlttee of which Uo is a member , and a few
days later Mr. Wilson of thu ways anil
means committee presented a resolutioi
directing the committee upon which wouli
fall the burden of originating rovemu
legislation for the relief of a depleted treasury
ury to conduct the Inquiry. Both resolu
lions went to the committee on rules , am
that committee today reported Mr. WIl
son's proposition , thus conferring Jurisdlctioi
on the ways and means committee.
Immediately after the reading of the re
port Mr Breckinrldge of Arkansas , a mem
ber of the ways and means committee * i
the last congress , but now of the nppwpria
lions committee , sought to present a subst !
lute resolution , dividing the work betweet
the two committees , conferring upon th <
ways and means committee the inquiry int <
the effect of the McKinlcy law and upon th
appropriations committee the investlgutioi
of the llnancial condition of the treasury.
Mr C'atchlngsof the committee on rule
promptly objected , staling thai Mr. Breckiii
ridge's resolution should bo introduced am
referred in the usual v.ay , ami declining , o :
behalf of the committee on rules , to accep
an.\ substitute or amendment whatever t
the pending resolution.
After some further discussion Mr. Hreckii :
ridge withdrew his substitute and the res *
lutlon recommended by the committee o
rules was unanimously adopted.
Will Ili-Kbi the Investigation ill Once.
The members of the ways and means con
mitteo were at once informally notilled tlm
a meeting of the committee would bo hel
this week to begin the Investigation.
"The investigation will bo made by th
full commlllei ? in open session , " said Mi
Springer , "and not delegated to a siibcpn
mitteo it is important that this investip ;
tlon should show the condition of the1 treai
ury at some particular moment of time. A
this is so near the end of the half of the Hi
cat year , the proper time al which the eoi
dition of the treasury should turn is the ills
day of December the end of the lirst half <
the fiscal year. If wo know the obligation
of the government on that day , tboreceipl
from all sources at that time and the liabl
Hies of the government for the future , w
will know exactly bow the governmoii
stands financially and be enabled to devise
plan for meeting a possible deficit. "
Most of the day was consumed in tit
house in considering the senate bill cnlaii
ing the provisions of the act for the di :
tribulion of awards made under the convei
tlon between the United States and Moxk
the La Abraclaims. It was bitterly oppose
by Mr Covert of New York. The hi
Dually passed by a large vote. The effect <
the bill is to refer the whole matter to tl
court of claims , with power of appeal .1 :
either party.
The remainder of the session was co
sumed in the consideration of iniimportai

1'AltH , Dec. li ) . ( New York Herald
Cable Special to Tin : Hr.i.l : The crisis
which 1 predicted in my dispatches of yester
day has happened. M. Kouvler , minister of
finance , has handed In his resignation ,
and In a way dramatic enough , at the
session of the Chamber. All that he said
proves nothing , for what he said was con
trary to. fact. He confessed that he bad
been at the house of the late Hiron : do licl-
nach , and because be was ignoraM of the
prosecutions. Hut thu prosecutions had
been decided upon In thu ministerial council
at which M. Heavier assisted eight days lie-
fore the suicide of the Baron de Helnach.
M. Clemenceru was upon thu point of
speaking in order to explain his own con
duct but ho was restrained by his friends.
That was a mistake , for an explanation had
been expected.
Sonic Singular Statement * .
I am advised thai the situation of the
ministry generally Is shaky. It is inad
missible that the other ministers did not
know of the conduct of their colleague , the
minister of finance- . Moro than that , they
have lied from the beginning , since every ono
of them has declared from the tribunu that
do Heinach was not poisoned , when they
knew to the contrary. Should the whole
cabinet resign It is impossible to say who
will succeed. Nobody wants to take the re
sponsibility ,
The position of President Carnet is also
very shaky. It must not ho forgotten that
ho also knew all about the poisoning through
.tho prefect of police , and that ho knew of
the situation In which M. Uouvier was
placed from the hitter's own confession.
It was his duty to have prevented
him taking ofllco in the new government ,
and from continuing to tell falsehoods , but
the difficulty Is greater for the republic than
for the president of the council. The eaudi-
date having the greatest is M. Henry Bris-
son , but he evinces no presidential quality.

As 1 have kept the readers of the Herald
well informed from day to day of the courst
of events since December 2 , they know thai
the situation in Franco is bad. The bourgeoisc
and the people aVe republican enough , but
let us see if wo are going to assist at ai
evolution , either reactionary or socialistic.
Anti-semitism stands for disorder , and if II
believes that its hour was at hand , it would
bring about a new scandal greater and more
disgusting than any and things would cm'
up in the death of .liberty.
There is one anti-semite who is jubilant
He is M. Drumont , who has for years pasi
been denouncing as scandalous the conduct
f deputies , llimneiers and ministers.
The committee of inquiry will tomorrov
lear M. Houvier , M. Constans and M. Clem

The successor of M. Houvier as minister o
finance will bo M. Tirard , formerly presidon

of this friendliness. I now learn that the

PAIIII , Dec. IB. In the Chamber of Depu
ties today M. Houvier confirmed the state
ment made by M. Clemeiieeau that ho and
Haron de Heinacb visited M. Clemenceau on
the eve of the baron's death. In his state
ment M. ClemeuccaU said M. Houvier had
explained to him In the lobby of the Cham
ber of Deputies that Haron do Heinaeb was
being driven mad by the campaign organ
ized by the papers against him , that It was
for him a question of life or death , and that
the three visited M. Herto induce him to
Use his Inllucnce to stop the attacks that
were being inade upon Baron de Helnach.
M. Her/ informed them that H was not in
his power to stop these attacks , and his vis
itors left.
M. Houvinr. in acknowledging Unit the
statement of M. Clemenceau was true , said
that ho bad done nothing to reproach him
self for. and that his conscience was easy.
M. Paul de Houlde , fanner president of the
suppressed Patriot league , made a violent
attack upon M. Honvier , declaring that he
ought to be compelled to appear before the
high court to answer charges made against
him in connection with his conduct while
holding a ministerial position.
M. Houvier responded to M. do Houlde ,
saying that ho was ready to answer in any
court any charge thnt'.lmd been or might bo
made against him , and'tbatho ' would only re
peat what he had said , M. Houvier added
that he had visited Baron de Heinach solely
from motives of humanity. He declared that
a section of the press was taking advantage
of the Panama affair to U'row slurs upon all
republicans who are in i ver. He would be
able to resume his placi ; as a simple deputy
and could hold his bead high , with the sense
that his honor had noc been sullied. This
closed the incident , though it was thought
at the time that it migfit lead to serious con
sequences , i
The lobbies and ( jallc'ries of the chamber
were crowded Ihrolip'hYml the sitting , every
one expecting a crisis that would result in
the overthrow of the government.
The resignation of M. Houvier will prob
ably result in an extension of official life to
the Hibot cabinet.
Shortly after M. Houvier's visit to Presi
dent Carnet it % yas officially announced that
the finance minister's resignation had been
accepted , and that M. Tierard , ex-minister

Dr.s MoiNr. < la. . Dec. lil.-The prospects
for the extension of the DCS Moines , North
ern & Western railroad to Webster City and
Mason City were never brighter than at
present. All agree that an extension of
this Hue through this productive portion of
the state would be of Inestimable value to
farmers and business alike. W. C. W'ilson
and a party of Webster City men were in
this city today and held a conference with
Superintendent Hnbbell and Manager Mar
tin relative to the proposed extension. The
position of the railroad company is that they
stand ready to build the line providing the
property owners along the proposed mute
vote the customary tax as an inducement for
the company to make the enormous outlay of
money necessary to carry out such a plan.
General ( ! . M. Dodge , accompanied by Gen
eral David S. Stanley , a retired capitalist of
New York , and Mr. Herman , an eminent
business man of the metropolis , arrived in
the city yesterday in a special car , and It is

his home on a farm near Latrope , Pa. , leav
ing his property in such a shape that his
little infant sou would inherit about ? T > 0,000.
A year or more ago the child became ill ,
and It was subsequently supposed it was
lieing slowly poisoned. Great efforts were
made to save the little fellow's life. The
mother finally took the child to California ,
lioping thai a change in the climate
would restore her child to health , but
it was no use , as the little one
was doomed , and last week died from
the effects of pneumonia and abscess
of the stomach. The abscess is supposed to
lie the result of the iioison administered.
Mrs. Guthrie is on her \vay home from the
west with the corpse , which will be brought
to this city. When the child first took ill
sbu acknowledged that some ono had given
him a peculiar liquid to drink , but would
not tell who the person was. There will not

Nnv YOIIK , Deo. til.The Brlggs heresy
trial was resumed today. The galleries of
the old Scotch church \vcro crowded , nnil
tlicattcndancoof the brethren forming the
court was unusually law. Amonij the
Itvonilucnt people In .the galleries \\as Mrs ,
Cleveland , wfo | ot the president-elect ,
accompanied hy Kev. Dr. Wilton M. Smith ,
pastor of the Central church. The largo attendance -
tendance was due to the fact that Dr Brlgifs
was to answer tlu < charges brought against
him by the prosecutlnp committee.
Dr. Hripps read from a printed pamphlet.
He bewail by calling upon the judieiatory to
dismiss all prejudices from their minds anil1
consider the case in the spirit of Christ ami
under His Inllucnce.
Dr. Bripgs proceeded to consider the points
of the prosecuting committee's argument and
asserted that the Hue of proseeution adopted
by them was illegal and dishonorable. The
rulings made by the judtciatory precluded
them from the line of argument pursued and
showed a contempt of the jiidlciatory. It
the latter sustain their own rulings , as they
must , then these charges must he thrown out
of court.
Much of Mr. McCook's argument , said
Dr. Hrlgps. was devoted loan exposition of
the fourth and seventh charges , which were
ruled out by the presbytery , lly thus defy
ing the prcsbytfi-y , the prosecution suc
ceeded in the scheme of sending to the
higherconrthcivafter.au argument in sup
port of the truth of the charges. The de
fendant argued that no evidence had boon
advanced by the prosecuting committee to
sustain charges 1. 4. fi and * ' . , and tbcso
charges should bo tin-own out.
Hilias Not lictractcil.
"Mr. Mel took has said that 1 have not re
tracted any of the statements made by mo
in the inaugural address , " continued Di' , (
Hrigps. "Hut why should I ? When it is
shown that 1 have made erroneous state
ments , then I will retract , but not before.
Tlrcre has been no proof oiVercd yet that I *
have- been guilty of heretical teachings ami1
If this were a civil court 1 should stop right
hero and ask that thu case be dismissed.
But 1 recogiil/.e the fact that this trial Is
merely for the purpose of carrying these
charges to a higher ecclesiastical tribunal ,
and so 1 am forced to consider them on their
merits.1 \
Dr. Bripps then proceeded to take up suc
cessively the charges and spocillcaliims , and
to give a categorical response in his argu
ment , which was remarkable for its wldo
research , profound erudition and close rea
soning.
Dr. Bripgs lirst called attention to the
preliminary principles which regulate all
trials for heresy in the Presbyterian church
of the United States of America , which , ho
said , have been entirely disregarded by the
prosecution in its arguments upon the
charges and specifications. Presbyterian law
requires that the charges -should set forth
that certain teachings are in conflict with
certain doctrines which are essential to the
Westminster standard , and Urn holy scrip
tures. As to dangerous errors , not in con
flict with necessary articles of the West
minster confession , this presbytoryhas not
the constitutional right to dual with them.
A Double Ittilc of Fall h.
"There is. " he said , ' a double standard , a
double rule of faith , in the Presbyterian
church. Italllrms that the holy scriptures are
the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
Hut it also declares that the Wcstminstei1
confessional and catechisms constitute tlni
official rule of faith in the Presbyterian
church. The holy scripture is the infallible
text of every statement in the Westminster
standard , and no man can be proven guilty
of heresy or sin who is not in conflict with
the holy scriptures. It must bo shown that
the doctrine against which the charge is
made is contrar.v to the holy scripture or to
the regulations ami practice of the church
founded thereon. The Westminster confes
sion , the ecclesiastical ride of faith , give un
official statement of the doctrines which the
Presbyterian church finds in holy scripture.
The defendant next considered the system
of doctrine. "The Presbyterian church In
the United States of America , " ho said ,
' Iris never attempted to set forth what are
tin1 essential and necessary articles of the
Westminster confession , and , thereforethero
is room for considerable difference ) of opinion
with reference to any doctrine which may bo
in debate. Certain historical and oxegenlal
principles , however , guide to a hasty de
cision in most cases. The Presbyterian
church Is a church with a constitution which
is a compact between ministers who consti
tute the church. It restricts the ministers
and the church also , thereby protecting the
ministry.1
Other Opportunities for Complaint.
"If the inaugural address contains heresy ,
exactly the same heresy were before the
public In my printed lectures three months
before the delivery of the address , " con-
tinned Dr. Hriggs. "If my inaugural bo
beretli ) all these other writings' are still
more heretical. You are obliged in law to
accept my explanations. You cannot find
me guilty , unless you llml that the explana
tions I shall give my statements are con
trary to essential and necessary articles ot
the Westminster confession and holy scrli-
tnre. "
Dr. TVlggs next considered "the blblcal
foundation of Divine authority , " and replied
to parts one and two together. Thuso
charges were to the effect llml Dr. lirlggH
held thai reason and church were fountains
of Divine authority. At this point the defendant -
fondant slopped his argument , and will re *
sumo It alii p. in. tomorrow.

CINCINNATI , O. , Dec. 1 ! ! . The Cincinnati
presbytery , by a vote of ill to SiT , as unoffi
cially reported , has closed thu mouth 'of ono
of Its brithest scholars until auch time as ho
filmll agree to renounce his views upon In
spiration and cease to touch them. It wan
learned from the. debate what degree of
punishment was Intend. " ! . Two reports
were submitted , line favoring a reprimand
and the other suspension. The majority of
the committee favored rebuke , but thu de
cision was in favor of his suspension.
The form of the sentence to be pronounced
against K'-v. Dr. Smith is as follows : Dr.
Smith is suspended from the ministry of the
Presbyterian church until such time as ho
shall m.ilto manifest to the satisfaction of
thu presbytery bis renunciation of the errors
he has been found to hold and his solemn
purpi.so no longer to teach or propagate
them.
The acquitlul on the first charge , and the
closeness of the vuto on the other charges
and in the sentence , are taken an good
reason swhy Prof. Smith should appeal to the
Ohio synod and to the general assembly , hue ,
on the other hand , It Is said , that the known
views of the synod are such that an appeal
would be vain , except as a utep toward
