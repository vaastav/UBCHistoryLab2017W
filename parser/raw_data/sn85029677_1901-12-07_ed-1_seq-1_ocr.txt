Market Flooded with Goods Made
from Adulterated WooL
Idaho Man Tells Stockmen That the Wool
Grower's Business Is Injured by tbe
Conscienceless Cheap Retailer and
the Bogas Manufacturer.
Chicago, Dec. 5. At Wednesday's
session of the National Live Stock as
sociation F. J. Hagenbarth, of Idaho,
iread a paper on the "adulteration of
tivwoJ." JJe presented facts to show
that wool is adulterated and said that
such adulteration deprived the wool
grower of a much-enlarged market
snd was therefore a material injury
to his interests Wnd called for prompt
regulation. It was also to the inter
ests of the wool manufacturer that
wool adulteration should be curtailed.
The public, he said, did not demand
the adulterated stuff, but it was the
clothier and the cheap retailer and
the bogus manufacturer who beguiled
the public into the belief that it was
Biuyingll wool when in reality it was
Ibuying shoddy and cotton and paying
;all-wool prices therefor. He urged
the passage of a bill by congress pro
viding for the inspection of woolen
gooas ana snocicly and the proper
stamping of the same, a fine of from
$50 to $500 to be imposed for each vio
lation of the "law by a manufacturer
and from 5100 to $1,000 for a dealer
who buys unstamped tululterated
cloth or sells it in the piece or as
clothing.
RAISES WARNING VOICE.
interstate Commerce Commissioner Says
Time is Fast Coming When Railroad
Competition Will Be Unknown.
Chicago, Dec. 5. In an interesting
address before the National Live
Stock coiv.ention held in this city,
C A. Praivty, a member of the inter
state commerce commission, said the
comraission had been referred to
as the "judicial it." The present law
'On which the commission is founded
and by which it acts should be wiped
off the slate and new ones enacted.
"The time is fast coming," the speak
er declared impressively, "when there
will be no competition between rail
roads. The cost of hauling a steak
from Texas to Vermont is now Only
about ono cent a pound. This is due
"to competition among the railroads.
This competition you cattlemen
should try to promote. What is the
purpose of these railroad combina
tions? To make money. It is not
the reduction in operating expenses
whereby the roads expect to increase
their dividends. It is by forcing more
freight money from the public."

as Soon as Treaty of Peace
Was Sighed.

the constitutionality of the imposition
of customs duties upon merchandise
brought into the United States from
the Philippine islands after the ex
change of the peace treaty with
Spain. The opinion was handed down
by Chief Justice Fuller. The opinion
was adverse to the claims of the gov
ernment on the ground that the Phil
ippine islands were at the time the
rihgs were brought in American ter
ritory, ceasing to be foreign territory,
they became domestic territory, he
said. It was held that the resolution
adopted by congress concerning ths
Philippines were not sufficient to
change the situation. Justices Gray,

the third article of the treaty Spain
ceded to the United States the ar
chipelago known as the Philippine is
lands, and the United States agreed to
pay to Spain the sum of $20,000,000
within three months. The treaty was
ratified; congress appropriated th
money; the ratification was pro
claimed. The treaty-making power,
the executive power, the legislative
power concurred in the completion
of the transaction. The Philippines
thereby ceased in. the language of th3
treaty 'to be Spanish.' Ceasing to be
Spanish, they cease to be foreign
country. They came under the com
plete and absolute sovereignty and
dominion of the United States and so
became territory of the United States
over which civil government could be
established."
