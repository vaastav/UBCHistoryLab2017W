FEAR A REVOLT OF
BERLIN POPULACE,
TALE OFREFUGEE
German Authorities Reported to Be
in Dread of Rebellion of Bis
contented Masses of the
Capital.
MUCH MISERY AMONG THE POOR
German-Born Wife of English La
borer Brings This Story
to Flashing'.
FOOD SHOPS ARE STORMED
LONDON, Dec. 19. Telegraphing
from Amsterdam the correspondent
of Reuter's Telegram company says:
"Life In the poorer quarters of the
German capital is described as piti
ful by the German born wife of an
English laborer residing In Berlin,
who after sixteen months intern
ment, has arrived at Flushing, Hol
land, on her way to England, accord
ing to the correspondent of the
Amsterdam Teiegraaf.
"The German authorities," the
Teiegraaf correspondent quotes the
woman as saying, "are in great fear
of a revolt owing to the discontent of
the people. Several riots occurred
in which shops were plundered.
Mounted police charged the crowds
which were composed mainly of
women. Misery among the working
class is considerable and is increas
ing daily."
"The woman's story is somewhat
confirmed," says the Reuter dis
patch, "by a letter from the Berlin
correspondent of the Handelsblad
who declares that shops literally
were stormed by large crowds who
were after their daily allowance of
butter, which was only about a
quarter of a pound per family.
"Provision shops were guarded by
the police to prevent disturbances."
Republican Unity
May Save Holding
.The Extra Primary
SIOUX FALLS. S. D.. Dec. 19.-(Spe
clal.) A well defined movement Is under
way among- the leaders of the stalwart
and progressive republican factions . m
South Dakota having for Its purpose the
uniting of the two factions on a Hat of
delegates to represent the republicans bf
South Dakota at the republican national
convention next Jove. -. .-
It 1s believed this movement will b
successful, and should such prove to be
the case, it will be unnecessary to hold
s special primary election throughout
South Dakota on April 4 next, as had
been contemplated In some quarters, for
the purpose of electing delegates to the
republican national convention. Should
It not be necessary to hold a special pri
mary for the selection of delegates, the
taxpayers of South Dakota would be
saved an aggregate of 150,000 of 160.000.
which. It la estimated, would be the cost
of the special primary.
Th miTim in the selection of delegates
to the republlcrfh national convention Is
klue to the fact that the national conven
tion, called for June 7. is only one day
after the date for the regular primary
election In South Dakota, which Is fixed
by the new primary tew tor the first
Tuesday In June, which next year will
fall on June &,
If the stalwart and progressive repub
licans of the state can agree upon a list
of delegates, the special primary election
would not be held, and the men agreed
upon would be on hand at the republican
nat'onal convention whe it convenes June
7, prepared to take their seats in the con
vention when the proper officers In South
Dakota wired them the proper creden
tlnts ss soon as the result of the primary
ete-tlon on June was known, which
doubtless would be early on the morning
of Juno 7, In sirple time for the neces
sary official telesrara to be sent to the
delegates in Chicago, so the members
could take their seats when the con
vention convened.

Hope Essential Factor
Of Human Existence,
Says Rev, Mr. Mackay
Rev. T. JMackay preached an Inspir
ing sermon on the "Chrlstmss Hope" at
All Ealnta' Rplscopal church : yesterday
morning. In the afternoon a vesper musi
cal service was held. Pperial musical
services will be held Christmas day.
Rer. Mr. Markay described hope as one
of the most essential factors of human
existence, reaching the climax of Its
possibilities in the higher life. Elijah,
who ascended the mountain, looking for
clouds and hoping for rain, typified th
attitude of mankind which Is always
reaching after something better In the
future, the minister said.
The question whether men msy hope
In the midst of all the trouble and d's
tresa of the great war. Rev. Mr. Mackay
answered by saying: "God Is still living.
We may well hope that good will come
of the terrible disasters of the war."
Rer. Mr. Mackay illustrated his posi
tion by telling of a question once asked
the noted negro minister, Frederick
Douglas, during the civil wsr.
"In the midst of a sermon which was
of a rather despondent note." said Rev.
Mr. Mackay, "an aged negro woman
asked: 'Is God dnadT'
"The shock of the question was so great
In tho mind of Douglas that It led him
to change tho tone of his sermon."

WILSON'S WORDS DISCUSSED,

Create Impression Respon

H0LLWEO AND GERARD CONFER
NEW YORK. Dec. 19. The New
York Tlnios has received the follow
ing authorised statement by wireless
from Berlin:
"Tho German government nat
urally, has never knowingly accepted
the support of any person, group of
persons, society or organization
sacking to promote the causa of Ger
many in the United States by Illegal
acts, by counsels of violence, by
contravention of law, or by any
any means whatever that could of
fend the American people In the
pride of their own authority.
"If it should be alleged that Im
proper acts have been committed by
representatives of the German gov
ernment they could be easily dealt
with. To any complaints, upon proof
as may be submitted by the Ameri
can government, suitable response
will be made.
Depends oa Allen Preaa.
"As Is well known, the means of com
munication between Germany and the
United States Is very unsatisfactory; It Is
practically impossible tur the German
government to keep Itself In touch with
American sentiment; It has often to de
pend upon the foreign press for Informa
tion concerning American affairs.
"The message of President Wilson, to
congress, In wbloh the activities of Ger
man sympathisers In the United tftatoa
were dlscused, will serve aa an Illustra
tion. Thera waa received In Germany
a brief summary of those psssages
which referred to plots and conspira
cies against peace and order In the
United States, and the effect pro
duced ' thereby upon sentiment In Ger
many was probably mora painful than
the American government knew. A dif
ferent Impression thereby might have
been 'produced by the full text of the
message, but unfortunately that would
not b available In Germany .until the
American newspapers arrived by mail, or
a fortnight or three weeka later, except
as It might be taken with, doubts and
reservations from tha English press.

" ."In the meantime, confidential com

In the United States by cable or wireless
Is impossible for reasons which the
American government knows. Messages
by cable must pass through the English
censorship, .and messages In secret code
by wireless is forbidden. Therefore ml
understandings are bound to arise, while

HAYE CLUES TO A
NATION-WIDE PLOT
TJ. 8. Officers Believe They Have
Unearthed Details of Conspiracy
to Blow Up War Plants.
ARRAIGN KOENIO AND ANOTHER
NEW YORK, Dec. 19. .With the
arraignment here today of Paul
Koenlg, said to be the head of the
German secret service in this coun
try, and Richard Emil Leyendeckor.
a New York, art goods dealer, on a
charge of conspiring to blow up the
Wetland canal, federal officials as
serted they had In their hands the
clues to a country-wide conspiracy
to blow up munition plants, which
has already resulted in the loss of
many lives sod destruction of mil
lions of dollars' worth of property.
For severs! years Koenlg has been the
head of a detective force employed here
by the Hamburg-American Steamship
company. The company, which is sub
sidised by the German government. was
quick to pome to his aid and through a
local surely concern supplied 180,000 ball
for him nnd ITO.W ball for Leyendecker.
Rank Clerk Arretted.
The arrest of Koenlg and Lycndecker
was coincident with the arrest by county
authorities of Frederick Schelndl. a clerk
In the National City bank. Schelndl, de
tectives claimed, confessed that ha waa
employed by Koenlg to supply htm with
Information regarding the shipment of
munitions to the allies.
This Information was obtained through
telegrams and tetters received by Na
tional City bank which has hsd a promi
nent part In the purchasing In this coun
try of supplies for the allies. Schelndl
said he received S2S a week from Koenlg,
police added. Schelndl told the polloe
that he la a German reservist and that
he acted solely from patrlotlo motives,
Pchelndl was arraigned before a police
magistrate on an affidavit charging him
with complicity In the larceny of docu
ments and messsges valued at $100,000,
from the National City bank. He waa
held In $3,000 ball for a hearing Monday.
Offera tn "Sqneol."
Important evldonco regarding Koenlgs
activities Is understood to have been ob
tained from Frederick Metsler, who was
arrested In connection with Koenlg and
Leyendecker. Metiter also was employed
by tha Hamburg-American tine and acted
as stenographer to Koenlg. - He was to
have been arraigned with his chief and
Leyendecker, hut at the last moment It
was announced by Assistant United
States Attorney Wood, who Is In charge
of the ce.se that Metsler waa not to ap
pear. ' ' " '
Later a hlKh federal official admitted
that Metsler had offered to turn state's
evidence and had already -supplied the
government with much valuable, ; Infor
mation.
r As aeon as It was known ihst' "Mstile'r
would not be arraigned, two attorneys
acting for the Hamburg-American line
went td the federal authorities and 'asked
permission to see him. This request Was
refused. The attorneys then offered any
stnoant of ball to secure Metsler'a liberty.
This offer also was refused. Metsler.
who had been examined at police hind
quarters during the night, waa taken
away early today and no Information
would be vouchsafed as to where he was
being held.
Sleuth " spend.
A new development occurred In ths
Case late today when Otto F. Mottola, a
police headquarter's detective, was sus
pended after a hearing by Commissioner
Woods. Mottola was summoned before
the commlaiioner after ths police said
they found his name In a note book taken
trom Koenlg. According to statements
attributed to Koenlg alid Metsler, Mottola
waa employed by the former at S3 a day
to make Investigations.
The arrests yesterday and toda are
said to be merely the forerunners of
numerous other arrests, which will ex
tend throughout the country. Secret
service agents assert that Koenlg had
twenty-seven agents In New York Citv
alone and probably between SOU and J0
scattered about the country.
Evolution of Man
Required Billions of
: Years; Says Miller
Burd F. Miller lectured at TheosoDhl-
cal hall, Sunday evening, upon "The
evolution of Life and Form," In which
he stated that the pedigree of man. In
stead of being only a few thousand years
old. covered a period of millions upon
minions or years, and that his long Jour
ney through evolution was a matter of
something over t.OuO.OOO.OuO years, ' That
from the middle of the Third Root race
to the present time was about 18,000,000
years. ....
Sir. Miller aald that the physlrsl scien
tists have already agreed that man has
existed for millions of years. He as
serted that "one has to admit a some
thing beyond the physical sight which Is
all powerful, which gives the beauty, the
form, the color, and is in fart the very
creator Of them, but because these forces
are not visible to our objective sight
there has sprung a great gulf between
those who study the form side and those
ho study the life side.
"But to those who study the Inner side
nf nature the real beauty and grandeur
becomes sppsrent, and the two as one.
"In the olden times religion and science
were wedded together snd there was no
discord between the intelligence and the
spirit. The fundamental difference be
tween the ancient and modern science Is
that the ancient science studies ths world
from the standpoint of a life that la
evolving, while the modern scientist stud
ies by observing tha forms through which
that life manifests. '
