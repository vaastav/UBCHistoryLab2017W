'Darkest RnsEia" comes to Raid's
opera house, Wednesday night Decem
ber 16. The play is a most interesting
and attractive one and has met with
great success for the last four seasons.
It is free from all melodramatic effects
and never offends by harrowing scenes.
Every characteristic of the land is
illustrated and clever skill is shown in
the various types of characters. The
polioe, nihilists, peasants and exiles are
intermingled with pleasing invention
and the whole is brightened by cheerful
mirth-pro vokiD e comedy, wnicn ever
bolda the audience in a happy humor.
The groupings, pictures and tableaux
are realistic and vividly illustrate Kussi
au life.
Additional interest is added to that
uocessful play "Darkest Russia" by the
recent crowning of the Czar. The Mus
covite rule with its crying injustice,
heartless oppression and police system
is shown in this stirring drama as it ex
ists today, and under which the people
re held io subjection. The play is cle
Terly constructed, and abounds in in
tensely dramatic situations, climax fol
lowing climax in rapid euccesion." The
plot is strong and the lines are thrilling,
bright and oonsietent It is full of heroics
and romance and is staged elaborately
and expressively. The company is an

known and excellent people are in the

Those who attended the piano recital

that the young lady ie one of the most

ever heard. The audience, we regret to
say, was small much smaller than it
would have been, had there not been
so many counter attractions. Mies
Tromm's playing gives evidence of the
thorough training she ha9 received, and
which she has augmented with careful,
persistent, conscientious practice. Her
execution of the difficult passages in her
elections of last evening woo the sincere i
appreciation of her audience. Her
interoretation of the beautiful composi-;
tions of Mendelssohn and Chopin, and
ber soulful shading of the various
pieces, demonstrate that ber musical
talent is inborn and not wholly the re
cult of meohanical training. All who
failed to hear her missed a treat which

THE CITY ELECTION.
Two Tickets In the Field, Both Con
taining Excellent Material
Next ftionday the citizens of Tuceon
will be called upon to cheese the officers
who will be reepm6ible for the conduct
of municipal Hairs for the coming two
years. Two tickets have been placed in
the field, and the names which appear
on each one demonstrate that party
lines have been wholly obliterated, and
that the welfare of the city, rather than
of party, is the paramount idea. It is
generally conceded by all, regardless of
party, that both titksts are made up of
good men, who will, if elected, render
acceptable service in the different offices
to which they aspire.
Henry Buebman, who is the can
didate for mayor on the nonpartisan
ticket, is the present incumbent, and is
well known in the city, where he has
resided for many years. His life in
Tucson is conspicuous for its energy
and continued devotion to the welfare
of the community. He has always risen
equal to any occasion which demanded
his attention, and naught can be said to
his detriment.
O. F. Sohumaoher heads the inde
pendent ticket. Mr. Schumacher is a
member of the board of supervisors of
tbo county, and also chairman o' the
city's committee on streets. No city io
Arizona can boast of a more enterpris
ing, more progreasiTe, more honorable
citizen than Mr. Schumacher. He has
been closely identified with the progres
of the city for many years, and b
services are highly appreciated by the
public.
Robert T. Millar is a candidate for
councilman-at-large. Mr. Millar is one
of the citizens of Tuceon who is looked
upon as valuable to ber interests.
business ne is painstaking and acocm
modating. During his term as a mem
Der of the city Lounoil, no objection has
ever been raised to bia work, for it has
always been' along the line dictated by
the greateet good to all concerned.
Rjyal A. Johnson is his opponent, on
the non-partisan ticket, find is also wide
ly known, both as a business .nan and
a pubiio official. He has held a numbe
of distinguished offices, and in each of
them has demonstrated both bis ability
and ntoe&e.
M. P. Dodge is a candidate fu
councilman in the first ward. M
Dodge is a book-keeper, a thorough
business man, accommodating, end
scrupulously honest. He is well ao
quainted with the needs cf the city and
active in the prosecution of ar.y duty
which falls to his lot. He would make
ao excellent representative for the fire
ward.
Gust. A. Hoff is a candidate for tLe
honors from the first ward upon th
independent ticket. The Tuceon Gro
cer Company owes its success largely to
the intelligent efforts of Mr. Hoff, whose
energy and business ability are un
questioned. He has the confidence of
all who know him.
From the second ward the non-partisan
ticket has chosen Geo. Pusch as Us
candidate. Whenever a maa ie success
ful in the conduct of his own affiirs, it
is more than reasonable to suppose that
he will follow the same policy when
entrusted with the conduct of th
business or. others. iNo one would ever
think of questioning either the honesty
or ability of Mr. Puecb, and he is justly
looked upon as one of Tuceon a sub
etantial citizen.
Richard G. Brady is announced
the independent candiaate for council
man from the second ward. Mr. Bind
ie a member of the firm of Brady &
Levin, and in the transaction of hit-
business has made himself well and
very favorably known to the citizens
of Tuoson. He is able, energetic, and
enternrieico and is fully aware of tb
needs of good city government. If
elected he will doubtless make a worthy
official.
For City recorder the non-partisan
ticket bears the name of the present in
cumbent, Unas. T. Uonnell, Mr. Con
nell has made a reoord in his admicis
tration which should be a strong ap
peal to voterp. lie is able. fair, ana
impartial in his execution of the law,
and 19 constantly on tne alert for any
advantage to be gained to the city. 11
is a property onwner, a tax payer, and
man of family. He has devoted much
time, and every spare dollar be couIJ
gather to prospecting and developing
mines. These facts prove a genuine
interest in the welfare of the city and
surrounding country.
His opponent uuoo the independent
ticket is E. T. Newett, one of the pro
minent leaaers of the young demooracy
and popuUr among a large circle cf
acquantances.
Frank S. Treat, the non-partisan can
didate for city assessor, is well known to
all Tucson and Pi m' county, as ooe of
the heavy taxpayers end substantia), re
liable citizens of the old pueblo. He
has been prominently before the public
for a number of yeare, and has been to
faithful to every trust that his name
eynonomous with ell that, is best in hu
inanity. If elected, be will bring to the
office an ability made strong by long
experience, the exerciee of which will
make him a most satiEfactory olncer.
On the independent ticket, for assessor
is Vicente M. Cordova, known through
out the city as an enterprising business
man. being a macufacturer and dealer
in harnepe, saddles, etc.
Harry Drachman and Herbert Ten
ney, the former on tne non-partisan
ticket, and the latter on the independent
are the two candidates for the office of
treasurer. Brth are young men con
epiouous for integrity, trustworthiness,
ability and energy. Mr. uraenman is
at the bead of the shoe department in
he establishment of L. Zeckendorf &
Co., and Mr. Tenney is cashier of the
Consolidated bans. Either of the young
gentlemen would make an excellent of
ficer, m whom the utmost confidence
could be placed, without the slightest
fear of betrayal.
The important position of city mar
shal is sought by G. W. Cakes on the
non-partisan ticket, and S. W. Finley,
ndependec t. Both are officers of ability
and courage. Each is alive to the duties
of the office, and the election of either
one would secure a careful lookout for
the city's inttreet.
The citizens of Tucson need feel no
alarm as to the welfare of the city for
the next two years, for the election of
either ticket will insure good, economical
government.

Washington, Dec. 8 The most not
able feature of the republican senate
caucus today os eeen from the outside
waa the absence of the men who bolted
the nemination ot McKinley because of

on this account were: Dubois, Petti
graw, Mactl?, Cannon, Squire, lellsr
All except Teller were in the city and
were united to attend tne caucus.
That their absence was intentional wa6
clearly shown by the following letter
read soon after the caucus waa oalled to
order by Senator Shermai : ''Wathing

Very truly yours,
Fred T. Dubois.
Dubois resignation was received with
out comment. On motion of Lodge,
Wilson, of Washington, was chosen sec
retary. Shoup was placed on tbeeteenog
committee in place of his colleague. This
oommittee was also enlarged by the ad
diticn of Uansbrough ot North Dakota
The Dingley tariff bill was referred to
the steering oommittee with instructions
to investigate as to the likelihood of
getting the bill through and to devise
means to that end if possible. It was
tne prevailing opinion that the best
policy demanded tte passage of the bill
but the opinion seemed to be quite
general that this is not within the range
ot possibility. Gear brought up the
Paoifio railroad bill, which was referred
to the steering oommittee. After Lodge
explained the status of the immigration
bill the caucus desired to stand by that
as a party measure and press its early
consideration. The oaucus also decided
for International agreement on silver
by agreeing to the following resolution
introduced by Woicott:
Resolved, that a special committee of
five members of this caucus be appoint

"Monroeism is thrusting itself forward

The St. James Gazette: "The con

Through tbe courtesy of Dr. W. V.

prosperous condition than at present
and tbe promise for efficient work and
progrees is as bright as could be de

The subject of musio is receiving at
tention this year, and the progrees of tbe
pu pile is really remarkable. The latest
methods of instruction are employed
and are giving very satisfactory results.
No provision is made by which tbe
ecbool board is empowered to employ
special leachers,in conttquenc i of whiob
fdct, matters hare been ao arranged that
primary teachers, whose regular school
wjrk is completed early in the afternoon
of each day, take charge ot this work,
devoting a short time to each room.
Mrs. Dyer has coargeof tbe musio in
the four I jwer rooms of tbe high subooi
building on the plaza, and lbe pupils
under ber instruction are doing very
nicely indeed.
Tbe upper rooms of the building are

Tbe alter. dince, previous to the epi
demio of diphtheria, was more than
satisfactory. Since that time, however,
there has been every marked decrease
in tbe number of pupils in almost every
room. Now that there is no f urtber
cause for fear on this score, parents
should eee to it that only tbe most press
iog necessity shall deter a child from
being constantly at his desk in the
sohool room. The law in the territory
is such that theappo-tionment of scnool
funds is baed upon tbe average attend

schools may be maintained for tbe long
est possible time, every parent phould
take an active part in securing tbe pres

upon tbis matter, for the results are of
