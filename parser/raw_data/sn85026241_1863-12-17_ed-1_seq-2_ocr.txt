We furtiivhed our reader with President
Lincolo'a Message in aupplement to the
Cbkomcls en last Thursday". The tnes-
tage, as transmitted by telegraph, we
frightfully butchered ; in fuct, tha tense of
it was aknoat deittrovedi. For this reason
we hare ermohided to re-print the latter part
ef it, relating to the war and to reconatruc
tion. We copy from a Washington City
paper the Intelligencer
When Cnnsjrem aatemhlad a rear ai tha
war bad already lastud nearly twenty months
aud there had beeu tuauy eotifiiets- on both
tend and ken, with varyina: results. -The
roliellion had been nrerwd back into reduced
limits; yet the tone of po'me feeling and
opinion, at home unit am-outi, was not aaiis-
liiutory. nil cutiar em in. the popular
election;, then Just past, imlicuted uneuM-
nes. unionir ourselves, while amtrl much that
was cold and menacing tba kindest words
coin in from Ktiroiro were uttered in aocenta
of pity that we were too bllud to surrender
a hnirflle enure. Uur commerce was suf
ferine greatly by a lew ai mm) rebels built
upon and furnished from foreign shores, and
we were tureatenrd with, lurh additions
from the same quarter as would sweep our
trnde trom the sea and raise our l.sackuilu.
We had failed to elicit front Kuropesn Gov
ernments any thing hopeful upon this sub
ject. The preliminary emancipation procla
liou, issued in Scplriuliet, was running it
assigned period to tho bug-inning of the new;
year. A itinnttt later the nual proclamation
came, me;uding the announcement that col
ored men of suitable condition would be re
ceived in the war scrviee. Tha polioy of
emancipation and of employing black soj
diers gave to the future a now aspect, about
which hope, and fear, and dmibl eonlendud
in uncertain conflict According to oar po
litical system, as a matter of civil adminis
tration, tbe ticueral Uoverninent had no
lnwlul power to effect emnncipntinn in any
State, and for a long time it had been hoped
that tho rebellion could be sunDressed with
out resorting to it aa a military measure. It
was all the while deemed pcvMlilo that tho
necessity fur it might come, an 1 that, if it
should, the orisis of the contest would then
be presented. It came, and, aa we antici
pated, it was followed by dark and douln-
lul ilnys.
f.leren months having now passed, we
aro permitted to take another review. The
ruhol borders are pressed still further back,
and by the complete opening of the Missis
sippi the country dominated by the robot-
lion H divided into distinct parts, with no
practical communication between them.

emancipation in their respective plates.
Ul those States not Included in the emanci
pation ptoclaiuation, Maryland auJ Missouri,
neither of which three years ago would tol
erate any restraint upon the extension ot
slavery into new Territories, only dispute
now as to the beat mode ot rcniovini it
it within theii own limits. Of those who
wore slaves at the beirinniiitt ot the rebel
lion, full one hundred thousand are now in
tbe United States military service, about
one-half of which number actually bear
aim in tho ranks; thus giving the double
advantage of taking so much labor from tbe
insurgent cause, and supplying tbe places
which otherwise must be filled with so many
white men. So fa ejus tested, it is difficult
o say they are not as aood suldier as any,
No servile iiiiurrectiou, or tendency to vio
lence or creel ty, has marked the meaiures
of eiuanoiuation and arminz tho blacks.
1 lies ineannrea have, been union dwneaed
in foreiarn countries, and ounteiuDorary with
such disouision the tone ol uublie sentiment
there is much improved. At homo the same
measures have been fully disoussod, sui
perted, criticised, and denounced, ana the
annual elections lollowing aro bigbly en
oouraging to those whose otticial duty it
to hear tbe country through this great trial.
Thus wo hare the new reckoning. The
crisis which threatened to divide the friends
of the Union is past.
Looking now to the present and future,
and with reference to a resumption of the
national authority within the States whera
in that authority has been suspended,
have thouiht fit to issue proclamation,
cony of which ia herewith transmitted.
On examination of this proclamation
will uppear, s is bolisved, that nothing
attempted beyond what is amply Justified
the loiiaututinn. true, the lorm ot au oal
is itiven, but no man ia ooeroud lotake it.
The man is only promised a pardon in case
lie voluntarily lakes the oath, lhe Const
tutinn authorises the Executive to grant
withhold the pardon at Ins own abolut
duoretion: and this includes tho power
graut on terms, as ia fully established
judicial and otbor authorities. It ia also
proffered that if, in any of the States named
a atate Uoverninent shall be, in the mod
proscribed, set up, such Government shall
lie recognised and guarantied by the United
States, and that under it the State shall,
the constitutional conditions, be prolcoted
asainst invasion and domestic violence. The
constitutional obligation of the United States
to guaranty to every State in tho Union
republican form of Government, and
protect the State In lhe casca stated, la ex
illicit and full.
But why tender tho benefits of this pro
vision only to a State Government set up
this particular way? This section of the
Constitution contemplate ease wherein
the element within a Stato, favorablo to re
publican government, in tha Union, may
too feeble for an opposite and hostile ele
ment external to or even within 4ha Slate
and such are precisely the cases with which
we are now dealing. An attempt tn guar
anty and protect revived Stato Govern
ment, constructed in whole or in ' prepon
derating part from the very eleinout against
whose hostility and violence it is to be pro
tected, i aimply absurd. There must lie
lest by which to scnarate the onnoaina ele-l
tuenta, so as to build-mily from the sound
(nd that teat ia auHioiently liberal one
which (ooeut as sound whoever wi l make
a (worn recantation ot his former unsound
Bui if it be proper to require, aa test
admission to the political body, sn ' nath
allegiance to tha Constitution of the United
States and to the Union nnder it, why also
to the lawa and proclamation In regard
slavery? Those Jaws and proclamations
were enaoted and puC forth for the purport
of aiding in tho luppresinn of th rebel
lion. To give them their fullest effect,
there bad to be pledge for their mainte
nance. In my judgment they bar aided.
and will further aid. tho cause lor vhioh
they were intended. To now abandon them
ould be not enly to relinquish a lever
power, but would also bo cruel
astounding breach of faith. '
I may add at this point that while I

Te objections lo premature presenta
tion of a plan by the ' National Executive
cow'st in the danger of eommittalaon points
which eould lie more safely left lo further
developments, tare has been taken to so
shape tho document as to avoid embarrass
mentif from this sonrcs. Saying that, on
certain terms, ccrttrin clasws will be pardon
ed, with ri;hia restored, it is not said that
other classes, or other lei iii, will never bo
included, haying that reconstruction will
be accepted if presented In a specified way,
it Is not said it will never be accepted iu any
other way. -
Tho movements, by State action, for
mancipation in several of the States, not
included in the emancipation proclamation,
are matters of profound gratitulation. And
while I do not repeat in detail what I have
heretofore so earnestly urged upon this sub
jeet, my general views and ladings remain
unchanged ; and 1 trust tlutt i ougrcss win
omit no fair opportunity of aiding these im-
pon ant steps to a great con-uuiination
In the midst of other cares, however im
portant, we must not lose sight of the fact
that the war power is still our main reliance.
To that nower alone can we look, yet for a
time, to give oouhdence to the people in the
contestod reginns, that tho insurgent power
will not uguin overrun them.
Until that confidence shall be established,
ittln can be done any where tor whnt is
called reconstruction. Hence our c hie test
care must still be directed to the army aud
navy, who hvo thus tar borne their harder
part so nobly and well. And .it may be
esteemed fortunate that in giving the great
est efficiency to these indisiiensable arms.
we do also honorably recognise the gallant
men, from command r to sentinel, whocom
nose them, and to whom, more than to
others, tho world must stand indebted for
the home nf freedom disenthralled, regeu
eiated, enlarged, and perpetuated.

the eomnarative simulicity of General Mer
edit b have eonsnired to obaeure that truth;
but w trust our Government will take care
that it is made plain to all mankind,
. The Rebels Ionic aito passed acts and is
sued proclamations embodying and announ
cing their determination to treat tbe omcers
and urivates oi'ourblaok reaiuient as above
ataterl. And there can be no rational iluuut
that they are as bad as their word. Bo lore

did the same with those betrayed into their
hands by .Miles' treachery at HVpcr'a Fer
ry. Last June, as they swept across Mary
land and u u into Southern Pennsylvania,
they caught rjnito a number of blacks
some of them, doubtless; fugitives troni
Rebel owners, but many free born and
earned them all off into bondage. And up
to tbia hour, alter meeting our black soldiers
in tair ngnt at least a union tunes, wnerein
they hove always had tho advantage over
in position or in numbers, the;: have never
yet exchanged one single prisoner, white
black, balonging to colored regiment, and
we presume tiny are resolved that they nev
er till. And they are torturing and starving
our captured brothers in order to compel
our Government to exchange for whites
only, and leave officer nnd privates of our
colored regiments to be enslaved or murder

Mb. Editor,: Many of your readers
doubt recollect of there having been a meeting
of the wool-growers of this County held
last Spring, in Morristown, to consider the
propriety of shearing the sheep unwashed;
that a committee was appointed to draft
resolutions expressing the sense of the meet
ing, that said committee reported in favor
of the old plan of brook, washing before
clipping, whioh report waa adopted by tbe
meeting, . rather than submit to tars
one-third upon unwashed wool, (the rule
that time understood to be adopted by buy
ers, i . , t ' -
That the wool shorn from sheep unwash
ed, eiposod to all the soaking rains of Ihe
spring ot the year will not LOSfj oni
TUIRD by ordinary brook washing I enter
tain no doubt. Therefote, I think the ao
tion of the convention on this poiut wise
and proper, according to our information
that time, . Tbe ooiuinittee above referred
to reported s resolution in favor of a permanent
committee, which resolution waa die
posed of by appointing a ooiuinittee of one
from each Township. I have not- the minutes
before me, and do not recollect the
name of the persons oom posing it.
It wis suggested by my friend Aruiatrong,
from Gout ilia, who was nue nf the last .ooiu
inittee, that the UiJitura ot tne Uounty give
us one column weekly, for the purpose
oiuiuiuuioating. . with each, other and tbe
wool e-mwata of tbe County. I now. aa one
of said ooiutuittee, make this request of on
oolumn weekly laeaun ot ouroouo'y papers.
I t i especially requested that th committee
will contribute to fill this column, and .ilmt
the wool-growers generally will smbraoetbis
