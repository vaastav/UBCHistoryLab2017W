The Christian F.udeuvor Societies of
the state have just held their annual
convention at MontH-lier. There whs
it good attendance, and excellent ad
dresses were made by both clergymen
and hiyuien. The next meeting was
appointed at Rutland. The Society is
doing u good work among the young
people of the state.
Washington correspondents tell us
that great preparations are being made
for the inauguration of 'resident -elect
Harrison. It is expected that Vermont
will be well represented. Col. F.stey
has engaged oil rooms at the Hotel

be a "great day in the morning," as
the boys sing.

A PICTURESQUE CHARACTER.
Mr. A. A. Karle has sold '-The
Landmark" at White Kiver Junction,
though to whom we have not heard.
He will probably rest awhile, get un
easy and then start another paper
somewhere and make a good thing in
selling 011;, as he lias usually done.
Karle is a strange mixture of rough
ness and delicacy. His personalities
would be intolerable but lor their wit,
and occasionally he writes a tender o-
bituary or a beautiful poem which re
veals the other side of the man. He
has combined more business sense and
editorial nonsense than the average

that have takeu place in our history,
and sees gome dangers ahead. The in
crease in wealth on the part of some,
and the growth of the number id' those
who are poor, the drift of the popula
tion towards the cities he regards a
ominous of evil. Classes are forming
and the gulf between employers and
employees is widening. While millions

are taxed for the support ol the gov
ernment under the operation tof tariff
laws. If things keep on as they are
tending he sees not far off the dev elop,
ineiit of communism, and this of two
kinds, one of wealth and the other of
poverty. lie thinks he sees in a revis
ion of the tariff a remedy for these ev
il, lie believes in meeting existing
evils fairly and squarely, making 110
compromise. He deplores the tenden
cy to regard the government as pater
nal ami to seek through it the fill Iter
ance ol so many private interests, loo
much loose legislation has encouraged
the violation of contracts and thegrant-
:ig of claims upon insufficient proof on
the part of the applicant. This appears
in the pushing for pensions where claims
are not sustained by valid reasons. He
considers the subject of neglected legis
lation and refers to some of the evils
flowing therefrom. One of these is the
crowded condition ol the supreme court
calendar and the consequent delay that
is caused to suitors for justice. A suf
ficient remedy has not yet been provid
ed. Another ev il relates to the public
lands. These are not protected with
of dollars. He accepts the recoiiiiiiend-
j atiou of the secretary of war that there
1 should be Home plan to test the fitness
j of ollicers for promotion. He has 110
sympathy with those who would have
the Apaches returned to their reserva
tions. Treat them kindly but keep
them in restraint far from the scenes of
their former lives. lie thinks that
I the navy ha been managed intelligent
ly, and the postal service shows an in

The message is a brief resume of pub
lic all'airs and while many may not a

The law abolishing the stock ex
