Fleeing Cashier Probably
Speeding Through
Mexico.
It Is Believed He Intends
Boarding a Steamer for
South America.
Bank Attach.es Property of Fugitive
Greater in Value Than the
Amount of His Defal
cation.
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 10.— The search
for Henry J. Fleishman, the absco'nding
cashier of the Farmers' and Merchants'
Bank, has thus xar been unsuccessful.
The only clew discovered by the police
officials, after running down every rumor
that came to their ears, is the fact that
Fleishman departed from the Arcade depot
of the Southern Pacific Company be
tween 8 and 9 o'clock last Saturday
morning. Some time between these hours
Fleishman appeared at the station, wear
ing an overcoat and carrying a light-col
ored hand satchel about fifteen inches
long. One of the railroad employes who
knows Fleishman spoke to him and In
quired as to his destination. The de
taulting cashier replied that he was go
ing over to Pasadena on some business.
The depot employe says he did not see
Fleishman again— In lact, paid no fur
ther attention to him — and does not know
whether or not he purchased a ticket or
took the train. •
A policeman at the Southern Pacific de
pot, however, supplies the Information
that the railroad employe could not give.
He knows Fleishman well and could i\pt
be mistaken in the man, and he declares
positively that he saw the fugitive at the
depot between 8 and 9 o'clock on Satur
day, and that Fleishman boarded the
train for Pasadena. Fleishman entered
one of tbe coaches and had not emerged
when the train pulled out.
Buys Ticket in Pasadena.
The ticket to Boston which the cashier
purchased was bought in Pasadena on
Saturday, and not In this city. He board
ed a Southern Pacific overland train in
that city and started for the East. How
far he traveled on the Boston ticket Is not
yet known, but the authorities will soon
be able to land this information by trac
ing the ticket through coupons In the
hands of conductors along the line. It is
certain that the Boston ticket was bought
as a ruse and that the cashier did not
travel far on it.
It is believed that he left the train
somewhere in Arizona, New Mexico or
Texas, to connect with sOme branch road
that would carry him across the border
of Mexico. The theory Is that he is now
speeding toward Vera Cruz, with the in
tention of boarding a steamer in that port
for some point in South America. The
authorities are working on that supposi
tion.
Fleishman, had he remained on the over
land, would have reached El Paso Sunday
morning at 7:05 o'clock and a Mexican Cen
tral train departs three hours later. Had
the absconder planned otherwise, by using
the Sunset limited, be might have left
the train at Benson, A. T., stopping there
until Sunday night, when he could have
taken a train for Guaymas. That port is
crowded with tramp steamers plying be
tween the ports of Central and South
America.
If the fugitive continued his journey
to El Paso he is presumed to have halt
ed before reaching Mexico City, where
he is known. There is an extradition
treaty with the southern republic, a fact
of which he doubtless was aware. At
Vera Crux he could board a steamer for
Central American and South American
ports, whose ainhorities do not sur
render fugitives.
It is accepted as a fact that Fleishman
did not flee to Lower California, where
his ample funds would prove an attrac
tion to freebooters, who would not scru
ple to relieve him of his money.
How the Money Was Stolen.
Some interesting details in connection
with the flight of Fleishman came to
light during the Investigations conducted
to-day. It was not until last Friday that
his plans were perfected and the money

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1901.
VENEZUELA MAY FIGHT
BUT CAN HAVE NO AID
Uncle Sam Will Not Engage in That Cqun
tty's Controversy With Germany.
Special Dispatch, to The Call.
f* ALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N. W v WASH
& INGTON, Dec. 10. — President Castro will not
have the support of the United States in his defi
ance of Germany. " His declaration to the American
who visited him that he would -resist by 1 force the collection
of the German claim, though he was disposed to pacify Ger
many by, permitting the establishment of a German colony
on Venezuelan soil, attracted considerable attention in ad
ministration circles. President Castro can engage in war
with Germany if he wishes, but he certainly will not be al
lowed to cede territory to Germany for colonization pur
poses, nor is it probable that Germany would accept such a
concession. . _;.
"The Monroe doctrine," said President Roosevelt in his
annual message, "is a declaration that there must be no terri
torial aggrandizement by any . non- American power at the
expense of any American power .on American soil. We do
not guarantee any American state against punishment if it
misconducts itself, provided 'that the punishment cloes not
take the .form of acquisition of territory by a non- American
power."
Before Germany orders her fleet to seize Venezuelan
it is expected she will acquaint the United
States with her intentions at the German embassy. In an
swer to a question of Germany's attitude toward Venezuela
reference is made to a statement made by Baron von Hol
leben, the German Embassador, immediately after his re
turn from Berlin, that Germany has no thought-bf extend
ing her sovereignty over any portion of the -Western hem
isphere.
that he took with him was obtained
after the bank had closed that after
noon. How he obtained these funds is
described by the assistant cashier.
When the money was being stored in the
vault after the closing hour, Fleishman
and the assistant cashier deposited $60,000
in currency in a small box which was its
customary over night receptacle. While
the assistant turned around to get more
money to place in the vault, Fleishman
must have slipped the big bundle of bills
out of the box and secreted them in his
clothing. The assistant cashier was ab
sent but a moment, and Fleishman had
no time to lose. When the cash was
counted after the cashier's disappearance
the box that usually held the currency
was empty.
This $60,000 was all the cash that Fleish
man took with him in his flight. The bal
ance of his shortage represents money
that he .had taken from time to time
previous to his departure.
After ho had obtained tbe bundle of pa
per money by stealth, there was still one
chance open to the cashier to avoid- ex
posure, and he waited for this before
starting on his journey that may termi
nate in the penitentiary. It was that
some change in Wall street conditions
might come to his rescue and enable him
to make good the money he had previ
ously stolen from the bank. With this
faint hope he delayed his departure until
the following day. Early in the morning,
long -before the first, stock quotations
were ticked over the wires from ' New
York, he was in Creary's bucket-shop to
learn the opening quotation on Amal
gamated Copper. He could not conceal his
nervousness or the feverish anxiety with
which he scanned the figures when they
were posted. He had lost. Amalgamated
Copper had touched $61 50, its low water
mark. Fleishman went straight from the
bucket shop to the Arcade depot and his
flight had begun.
There Is no longer any doubt that it was
his losses In this copper stock that led to
the cashier's downfall. He Invested heav
ily in the stock when it was seling at $20
above par, and when the bottom fell out
of Amalgamated and he had used up his
ready cash to "cover" he drew upon the
funds of his .employers, believing that
there must come a turn In the downward
tide that would enable him to repay the
money without detection and save that of
his own that had disappeared In the
slump. His last hope went when the re
turns of Saturday morning showed that
Amalgamated, Instead of rallying, had es
tablished a new low- water mark.
Bank Is More Than Secured.
Fleishman has left behind a fortune
greater In value than that of which he
robbed the Farmers' and -Merchants'
Bank. In addition to the $30,000 bond sup
plied by a surety company and his real
estate, valued at $50,000, he held convert
iblo stocks in different corporations, to
the value of $75,000. These, together with
the real estate, have been attached by
the bank. The institution has $155,000 with
which to offset its loss, the highest esti
mate of which places it much below thts
figure.
These stocks were left by Fleishman In
the hands of a friend in this city, whosa
name the bank officials refuse to reveal.
When this friend learned of Fleishman's
heavy defalcation he went to the bank
and informed it that he was the custodian
of the stocks. They were at once at
tached and will go fax toward "squaring"
the fugitive's account with his employers.
The directors of the bank met to-day
and set an expert at overhauling all of
Fleishman's accounts. Nothing further
than the statement given out yesterday
as to the amount missing, it was said at
the bank, had developed. State Bank
Commissioner Barrett made an examina
tion of the books to-day, and found Lhe
institution in a splendid condition.
The directors have authorized an offer
of $2500 reward for the apprehension of
Fleishman and an additional $2500 for the
return of the missing . money. >;.
I Judge Shaw granted the writ of attach
ment on the property of Fleishman," upon
the request of Graves, O'Melveny& Co.,
attorneys for the Farmers' and Mer
chants' Bank.
WOMAN WITH FLEISHMAN'.
Constant Companion of Cashier Whllo
He Was in Bakersfield.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 10.— Henry J.
Fleishman, the absconding cashier of the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank of Los
Angeles, was In this city on November 8
last, having been brought here as a wit
ness In the A. L. Forsythe forgery case
on a bench warrant issued from the Su
perior Court. At that time he testified
that Forsythe had no account with the
bank of which he was cashier and on
which the arrested man had forged
checks and cashed them.
Fleishman was in this city but one day
and evening. While here he was In com
pany with a woman. Fleishman was reg
istered at the Southern Hotel, but there
is no record of the woman on the hotel
register. Whether she came with Fleish
man or met him after his arrival is not
known. Fleishman has many friends in
this city, and, while he was seen by some
of them In company with the woman,
they profess ignorance as to her identity
or the city of her Vesidence. She was a
decided- brunette of striking appearance
and was attired in a dress of rich, dark
material. It Is known, however, that the
unknown woman was not a resident of
Los Angeles or Bakersfield. This much
is vouched for by Fleishman's friends,
who refuse to talk much concerning the
case, as they do not wish to gain pub
licity thrtiugh the predicament in which
Fleishman finds himself.
- The cashier while in Baker sfleld lived
quietly. He kept constant company with
his, female companion, but evidently he
and she were careful to avoid attracting
undue attention. On the evening of the
day on which Fleishman arrived In this
city : he and some of his friends attended
the floral fair which ■ was given at that
time. by the Woman's Club. The friends
who saw Fleishman with his companion
and who profess ignorance as to her
identity give as an excuse for their lack
of attention to detail so far as the woman
was concerned that they paid no particu
lar attention to her or her dress, as It
was not dreamed that Fleishman would
ever be In trouble. There was no reason
why they should' observe her. closely.
Those who know Fleishman best In this
city are" evidently aware of the name and
place of abode of the woman! but they
refuse absolutely .to say anything con
cerning her further than to deny that she
Is a resident of this city or Los Angeles.

SANTA CLARA, Dec. 10.— Local peace
officers were thrown Into a furor of ex
citement this evening over the prospect of
catching Fleishman, the absconding bank
cashier of Lo3 Angeles. Well dressed and
drunk, 'with a few dollars which he spent
lavishly, B. F. : Dudley, an iron-molder,
who came from Boston to '. work In the
Risdon : Iron- Works' in, San- Francisco a
short time ago, was taken for the default

early in the evening and notified Sheriff
Langford. Dudley. was too intoxicated to
give an account of himself, but after a
couple of hours' quizzing he regained his
senses enough to prove .who he was.
Dudley was well dressed and about the
height and build of Fleishman, but hte
hands showed he had been used /to hard
labor. In ' his pockets was $27. After be

ASSASSIN TRIES
TO END HER LIFE
Woman Found Badly
Wounded in a Wash
ington House.
Case Like That of Young
Ay ers Puzzles the De
tectives.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.— Mrs. Ida GU
bert Dennis, a dressmaker, was found In
an almost dying condition in her room at
5 o'clock this morning under circum
stances that promise to rival the Bonine
murder case. Her skull was .fractured,
her Jawbone was broken and her left ear
was almost severed from the head. Her
left arm bore bruises indicative of a
struggle, and her \ clothing and the bed
ding were saturated with blood. She was
removed to the Garneld Hospital. The
name of her assailant is unknown.
The general belief . is that Mrs. Dennis
was attacked while asleep in her back
room on the first floor, and that the first
blow,'. In : all probability administered with
the piano stool, which was smeared with
blobd, rendered her unconscious. The pre
liminary investigation by the police failed
to. indicate that there was any struggle.
Mrs. Dennis, in a conscious moment while
being carried to the hospital, said that
some, one had ■ "hurt" her, but when
pressed' for - details merely responded.
"Never mlnd.V • '. . v
Robbery. was apparently not the motive
for the crime, for on the table at the foot
of the bed was a small box containing: a
pocketbook well j filled with greenbacks
and coin. There was a bloody imprint of
a hand on the piano lid in the parlor, and
a window in that room was open. It is
supposed the assailant escaped through
thts window. When found Mrs. Dennis
was clad In her night garments and was
in bed under the cover. She was partly
conscious, although she has been uncon
scious most of the time since. -
The detectives are satisfied that the sev
eral blows of the piano stool must have
been wielded with considerable force, and
that there was no outcry. Mrs. Dennis'
groans, however, were heard by a woman
on the third floor and in the adjoining
house. About the same time Policeman i
Livingston and a watchman, who were
two blocks away, heard what they be
lieved to be a woman's scream. Mrs.
Dennis is about 47 years of age and is one
of the best /known women in business
here. She is the widow of Walter Den
nis, an actor. An operation was per
formed on Mrs. Dennis at the hospital
this afternoon. Very little hope is held
out for her recovery.
Complete mystery as to the motive for
or the perpetrator of the assault on Mrs.
Dennis continues to surround the case.
The police have been baffled in their ef
forts to obtain any clew upon which to
prosecute their work. Many theories as :
to the motive for the crime are being con
sidered by them, but absolutely no facts
have developed upon which to base a
clew to the person or persons implicated.
The victim of the assault remains In a
precarious condition at the hospital. The
physicians say she may regain conscious
ness, in which event It is expected she
will say something that will give the po
lice something to work upon. To-day in
brief periods of lucidity she mentioned
the name of a man whom she knew and
the police are seking to ascertain if he
possibly could be connected with the case
in any way. No arrests have yet been
made. The physicians hold out only a
slight hope of the woman's recovery.
