Unwise Policy
j*V
fe'The unwisdom of the course
being pursued by the city council
in regard to the entrance into the
.J^city of the Groton-Ferney tele
V': phone line can be best realized by
coming in'contact with the people
of the county outside" of Aber
deen, There"are three men on
the council, two engaged in the
jobbing trade and one a large re
tailer, whose unselfishness in the
ISr matter is more remarkable than
||p commendable. The course
which they permit the council to
•?^take in the matter is not only dis
creditable to the city, but injuri
ous not only to their own busi
ness but to every business enter
prise in Aberdeen.
PH These business men have been
active in contributing to the suc
cess of social enterprises in
tended for the purpose of win
ning for Aberdeen the good will'
of business men in the little
towns tributary to this distribut
ing point, but now all the kindly
feeling, the profitable friendship,
thus won is thrown to the wind,
and they go on obstinately pur
suing a course that must in
tensify the feeling of resentment
toward Aberdeen that is growing
all over the eastern portion of
the county. The situation may
se^m justifyable to residents of
the city, but outside, one fact
keeps staring the people in the
face—Aberdeen refuses to let a
farmer's telephoneline enter the
city.
When the matter first ca.me up
it was quite generally talked
about town that the council
should straightway pass an ordi
nance permitting any farmer's
line or independent company to
to enter the city under such reg
ulations as the council might
|from time to time impose. But
each tkpe the matter comes be
fore the aldermen," their unwise
action, or omission to do the
^sensible thing, causes the cry to
|go forth once more that Aber
Sdeen doen't want any farmer's
line to enter the town.
Of'course this, permission to
'such lines to enter the city,
establish a toll station, conduct
business and make such connec
tions as are desirable, will be
^finally granted after the situation
has become critical, but the
tardy act of justice will come

The political cataclysm that
impends over the whole vast em
pire of Russia seems to be the in
evitable fruit of centuries of mis
rule. The saddest thing about
it is that crimes of misgovern
ment to be atoned for are to be
wiped out by the blood of the
hapless victims rather than that
of the guilty ones. One thing
appears certain that, at however
bitter cost it goes, the old autoc
racy must pass away. The
stupendous price in blood, dis
aster and humiliation the old
Russia has paid for the new
order should entitle the Russian
people to an infinitely happier
era.§kM.'
Some opponents of a primary
law in this state are getting
mnch comfort out of the fact that
the governor of Wisconsin has
called an extra session to have,
among other things, certain sec
tions of the new primary law
amended They affect much
self-complacency over the fact
that they were too wise to ap
prove of such a law for this state,
as it might sometime have to be
amended.

The appointment by President
Roosevelt of his friend, Seth Bul
lock, well known Black Hills
character, to be United States
marshall to succeedEd Kennedy,
is accepted by the machine gang
of the state with very wry faces.
It is the best federal position in
South Dakota, and this appoint
ment made in disregard of ma
chine wishes is considered rather
ominous.

William Allen White thinks
that Governor Folk of Missouri
has good presidential timber in
him but that it should be matured
by about a half dozen years in
congress. He forgets that Folk
is the exception to the rule.
Consider the myriads of mature
district attorneys that have en
tered upon the duties of their
office, sworn to enforce the law,
without ever coming- with hailing
distance of their full duty, while
this immature Joe Folk has never
let a guilty rascal escape, except
where rescued from his merci
less enforcement of the law by
the superior courts. If as an
immature president he'solfar ex
ceeds"the"mature ones, perhaps
we had better not wait too long
before trying him.

The president's message, one
of the longest ever written* con
taining over 28,000 words, taking
over two and a half hours to read
it, is this week the subject of
much comment, mostly of com
mendatory nature. Those de
siring drafetic railway legistation
are somewhat disappointed. It
is even said the pro-railway ele
ment in congress is pleased
with it. But after all it is not so
much what the president says
as what he does that will decide
how resolute a leader of the plain
people he is. Time will decide
this.
