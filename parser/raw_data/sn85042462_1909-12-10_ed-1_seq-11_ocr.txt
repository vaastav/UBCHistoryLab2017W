'Forget Frivolity and Study Hard,' Nethersole's
Advice to Girls Seeking a Stage Career
SAYS GOOD GIRL
NEED NOT PEAR
CONSTANT WORK NECESSARY,
ACTRESS ASSERTS
Temptations Are Fewer Behind the
Footlights Than in Other
Vocations, Is Her
Opinion
"Girls who hope to go on the stage
should resolve to give up all thoughts
of frivolity and make up their minds
to study hard."
This is the advice that Olga Nether
■ole, the noted actress, who Is coming
to Los Angeles soon, gives all would
be Heiresses.
"Many parents oppose their daugh
ters in adopting the career of an ac
tress on the ground that the stage Id
a place Where the temptations are
greater than anywhere else," says Mi.<.-:
Nethersole. "To my mind this Is an
erroneous Idea and wrong. 'To the
pure all things arc pure,' and there is
no good reason why a woman should
not lead a life as pure and correct on
the stage as elaewhcre> '
"If a young woman Is employed In a
■hop she. in all probability, earns a
■-alary not to exceed $10 a week, and
the majority of women employed in
the shops of the groat cities earn from
$4 to $(i weekly. Money—or rather
want of money— acknowledged by
all students of ethics to be one of the
strongest factors In the temptation of
young women from the path of virtue.
We find the temptation In that re
spect far less on the stage than else
where, for the very simple reason that
a young woman on the stage, even
when playing a very small part, will
command a salary of from $30 to $40 a
week, while her sister, working In a
(lose. evil-smelling shop, will draw the
munificent salary of, let us say, $6 for
f.lx days' daily toll, working from 8
o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock
In the evening.
Good Girls Always Respected
"Who, In this cane, do you really
think Is subjected to the greater temp
tation, the girl who earns enough to
support herself in comfort, or the girl
who slaves tor barely enough to pay
for food and lodging, not to mention
the fact that she must be clothed? I
think you will agree with me that the
girl on the stage has all the advantage
up to the present time, and good girls
are respected everywhere.
"Next comes the question of com
panions and surroundings. I have
been on the stag* since i was 18 years
of age. and Judging from my own ex
perience and what I have been told by
young women employed In other walks
of life, I think 1 am perfectly safe In 1
saying that a young girl commands
equally as much respect from actors
as she will from the men with whom
she Is thrown in contact If employed
in store, office or shop she respects
herself and her priceless heritage of
pure womanhood.
"In choosing a profession adaptabil
ity must be considered. If you think
you are fitted for the stage and have
any talent for acting It Is a vocation
where the financial reward is greater
for women than will be found In any
other walk of life. Another thing
greatly In favor of the stage is the
fact that, with few exceptions, the
young women who adopt that profes
sion ar» most ambitious to succeed,

and. as everyone knows, success on the
stage means study and hard work,
and hard work and study—study never
ceasing. A woman on the stage Is so
occupied in her work that she has
little or no time for the frivolities of
life.
"A last word to any young woman
contemplating the adoption of a theat
rical career. Don't do it unless you
are prepared to work and study. Thle
does not mean study for weeks or
months—it means unceasing study for
years—l might say a life of study."

BANKER MORSE HOPEFUL
OF GETTING NEW TRIAL
Says if Convicted He Will Face Im
prisonment Firm in Belief That
He Is Innocent
NKW YORK, Dec. 9.—"lf the govern
ment has a good case it can prove It
again, but If I am denied a new trial
I have no remedy against the wrongs
and misconduct of which I think the
special officers and Jury were guilty."
This Is what Charles W, Morse, con
victed banker, who faces a fifteen-year
sentence in the federal prison at At
lanta, said tonight in, a statement. A
motion for a new trial has been set to
be heard tomorrow In the L'nited States
circuit court which convicted him, but
the argument may be postponed.
Morse's statement continues:
"What the end will be I am not able
to foretell—whether servitude under
a sentence which 1 is rarely Imposed,
even upon a murderer —or a new trial.
with a chance to submit my caße to
another jury after the cry fur a victim
has ceased. If It be servitude In a
distant state and climate, away from

with tirm consciousness that I have
violated no law nor wronged a single
individual."
Morse alleged that a majority of the
Jurors who found him guilty had In
dulged too freely In Intoxicants to
understand the complicated facts of
his case.

Music Notes
FOR the second time ■within a week
Ludwlg Wullner, liedersinger, In
terpreter and artist, was heard
last night In song recital in Simpson
auditorium.
That the house was smaller than the
OIM which greeted Dr. Wullner on his
Oral appearance was due probably to
the heavy storm of the last two days,
which chared only in season for those
dose in, but no visiting artist ever
sang in I-os Angeles to n more en
thusiastic audience. Such instant anil
sympathetic appreciation as Dr. v\ ull
ncr command! from his hearers is re
ceived by few even among the great
musicians of the «irth.
Hearing Wullner a second time Is
only to be confirmed in one's first im
pression that the man stands head and
shoulders in ills art far above all com
petitors, ai his six feet and several
Inches enable him to do physically
among men—so far indeed that he
seems almost to belong to a separate
type of which he is the sole representa
tive The distinct and very great
charm of his Blnglng is his wonderful
diction—the (ierman language lias
wholly unsuspected possibilities of
beauty which no one taught us until
tliis great, rugged giant came out of
the east to sing the heart songs of his
fatherland. And as we listen there
comes a sudden intuition that after all
we have been tricked by the man and
his art, for there is a veiled sweetness
and melody in his voice that hints at
totally different possibilities of vocal
development if he had so chosen. That
he did not let us give thanks.
The sympathetic accompanying of
Coenraad Bos was, as on the occasion
of Dr. Wullner's former recital, one
of the delights of the program.
A farewell matinee is to be given by
Dr. Wullner and Mr. Bos Saturday
afternoon In Simpson auditorium. The
program is the following:
Nachtstuck (Mayrhofer), Der Kreuz

despair a friend told me of an Ecuador
herb which he said would P«»l»velj

gave the formula used it on her 'laugh

five Inches in less than a month. Doc

the only thing which will actually grow

ought to have it. At first I thought I
would keep it a secret, and sell the se

hundreds of others must need it the

in the Menthol Crystals and the Per

tains the juice of tho Ecuador herb
mentioned above, and it loses its
strength If unsealed.
Apply the preparation night and
morning and rub well into the scalp.
If properly used it will soon produce
most astonishing results. Be careful
not to get it on the face or any part of
the body where you do not want to

The demand for the above prescrip

been so much difficulty In getting the
pure, unadulterated juice of the Ecua
