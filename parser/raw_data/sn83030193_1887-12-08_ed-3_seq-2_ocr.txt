(0. TV. KmaUty in Ib-l)aif Tribune
1'aiiis, Dec 7. After renting an abstract of tho
President's message, laid before all Kuropo this
morning, 1 saw Mr. Illalno and aiked him If he
would be willing to gtvo his views upon tho recom
mendation of the President In tho form of a letter
or Interview. He preferred an Interview, It I
would agree to send him an Intelligent shorthand
reporter, with such questions as should givo free
scope for nn expression of his vlcns. Tho follow.
Ing lucld,nnd powerful statement Is tho result.
Mr. Illalno began by saying to the reporter:
" I havo been reading an abstract of tho Presi
dent's message and havo been especially Interested
In the comments of tho London pipers. Those
papers all assumo to declare tbo message is a free
irado manifesto and evidently uro anticipating an
enlarged market for English fabrics In the, United
Btatci as a conscquenco ot tho President's recom
mendations. Perhaps that fact stamped tho char
acter ot tho messago more clearly thua any words
of inlnocan."
You don't mean actual frco trade without
duty 7" queried the rerortcr.
"No," replied Mr. Blaine. "Nor do tho Lon
don papers mean that. They simply mean that tho
President has recommended wuat In the United
Ststis Is known as a rovenuo turlrf, rejecting tho
protective fcuturo as au object and not even per
mitting protection to result freely as an Incident
to rcrcuuo duties."
" I don't know that I qulto comprehend that last
point," said the reporter.
"I mean," said Mr. Maine, " that for tho first
time In tho history ot tho United States tho Presi
dent recommends retaining the Internal tax In or
der that tho tariff may be forced down even below
the fair rovenuo standard, lie recommend) that
the tax on tobacco be retained, and thus that
many mlllluca annually shall bo levied on a do
mestic product which would far better come from
a tariff on foreign fabrics."
the tobacco tax should hk hei-salid.
"Then do you mean to imply that you would
favor the repeal of tho tobacco tax 7"
"Certa'nlyj I mean Just that," said Mr. Blalno.
I should urge that It he dona at once, even be
fore tho Chrlftmuji holidays. It would In tho first
place bring great relief to growers ot tobacco nil
otertho country, and would, moreover, materially
Ussen the price of tho nrtlclo to consumers. To
bacco to millions ot men Is u necessity. Tho Presi
dent calls It a luxury, but It Is a luxury In no other
sense than ten and oolite aro luxuries. It la well
to remember that tho luxury ot yesterday becomes
n nccesilty of to-day. Wutch, If you
plense, tho number of men at work on
tno (arm, In tho coal mine, along the railroad,
In the Iron foundry, or In auy calling, and
you will find S3 In ino chewing whllo they
work. After each meal tho samo proportion seek
tho solace of a pipe or a cigar. Theso men not
only pay tbo millions ot tho tobacco tax, but pay
an every plug nud every cigar au enhanced price
which tho tax enables tho manufacturer and
retailer to Impose. Tho only excuse lor such n tux
Is the actual necessity uiultr which tho Government
found Itself during tho war, nud the years Imme
diately loliowlng. To retain tbo tax now In order
to destroy tho piotcctlon which would Incidentally
flow from rul-jlitg tho sumo amount of money on
foreign imports is certainly a most extraordinary
policy for our Government."
Till: WlllSKF.V tax should HE uktaixku.
" Well, then, Mr. Maine, would ou advlso tho
repeal ot tho whiskey tux also7"
" No, I would not. Other consideration? than
thoso of lluinclal administration aro to bo taken
Into account with regard to whiskey. There Is a
moral sldo to It. To cheapen the price of whiskey
Is to Increase Its consumption enormously. There
would be no seuso In urging tho reform wrought
by high license In many .Stales it the National Gov
eminent neutralizes tho good effect by making
whiskey within resch of every ouo at W ccuts a
gallon. Whiskey would bo everywhere distilled It
tho surveillance of trie Govcrmcut were withdrawn
by the remission of the ta, nnd Illicit sales could
not then be prevented oven by a policy as rigorous
and searching as that with which Russia pursues
tho Nihilists. It would destroy high license at
onco In all tho States.
WHISKEY B1IOULU PAT FOn COAST nCFCNCES.
Wnlskey has done a vast deal of hurm In the
United Situte. I would try to mako it do some
good. I would use tbo tux to fortify our cities
on tho seuboard. In lew of tho powcrtul lctlor
addressed to tho Democratio pirty on tho subject
of fortifications by tho lato Mr. Bamuel J, Tllden,
lu 1S8S, I urn amazed that no attention has been
paid to tho subject by tho Democratic Administra
tion. Neer betoro In tho history of tho world
has any government allowed great cities ou the
seaboard, liko New York, Philadelphia, Boston,
Baltimore, New Orleans und San Francisco to re
main absolutely del- ucclras."
IN TIME OK l'KACBS I'llEPAllB FOIt WAll.
"But, "said tho reporter, "you don't tklnkwc
aro to havo war in any direction! "
"Certainly not," said Mr. Blaine. "Neither, I
presume, did Mr. Tllden when ho wroto his rc
uiarkab.o letter. Hut wo should change a remote
chance Into un ubsoluto Impossibility. Hour weak
and exposed points wero sirongiy fortttied. If to
day wo had by any chance even such a wur us we
bad with Mexico our enemy cnnld procure Iron
clads In Kuropo that would mesneo our great
nitira with dcatmctlou or lar them under contri
bution."
' But would not onr fortifying now possibly look
as it wooxpected wsrf "
" Why should It any more than the formications
made seventy or eighty years 'ago by our grand
fathers when they guarded themselves against
succoisful attack from the armaments of that day?
We don't necesaarlly expect a burglar because we
lock our d ore at night, but It by any possibility a
burglar comes It contributes vastly to our peace of
mind and our sound sleep to ltd that he can't
get In."
HOUSES AND FAHU8 TAT TOO MUCH TAX,
" But alter tho fortification should bo con
slructed would you still maintain tho tax ou
whlskeyj"
Yes," aald Mr. Blaine, "so long as there Is
whiskey to tax I would tax It, and when the Na
tional Government should have no uie for the
money I would divide tho tax among the members
of tho Federal Union with tho spcclflck-bjcct of
lightening the tax ou real estato. Tnc houses nnd
farms of the whole country pay too largo a propor
tion of the total taxes. If ultimately relief tould
be given In that direction It would, lu my judg
ment, be a wlso snd beneficent policy. Home
honest but misguided friends of temperance hao
urged that the Government should not use the
money derived from tho tax on whiskey. My reply
la that tho tax on whiskey by tho Federal Govern,
mint, with lis suppression of all illicit dl.tlllatlon
sndconseqent enhancement of price, has been a
powerful agent In the temperance reform by put
ting it beyond tbo reach of so many. Tho amount
ot whiskey consumed In the United Staled per
capita to-day Is not moro than 40 per cent, of that
consumed thirty yoira ago."
" Besides your gcueral and sweeping opposition
to the President's recommendation, havo yon any
further spccitlo objection ;"
Yea," answered Mr. Blaine; "I should
seriously object to tho repeat of the duty on wool.
.To repeal that vould.work great injustice, o mny
Interests and would seriously dlscourago what we
should earnestly encourago, namely, the sheep
emtwo among farmers throughout tho Union.. To
break down wool-growing and be dependent on
foreign countries for the blanket under which wo
sleep and the coat that covers our backs, Is not a
wlso policy for tho National Government to en
force." TDK OLD BCOABOO.

tion was adopted It would increoso onr export
trBdcj"
" Possibly lu some few articles of pccnlar con
structlou It might, but It would Increase our Im
port trade tenfold ns much In Iho great staple falx
rlcs, In woollen aud cotlon good, lu Iron, In steel,
lu all tho thuusind and one shapes u which they
are wrought. How aro we to export staple fabrics
to the markets ot Kuropo unless wc make them
cheaper llun they do In Enrol e, and how arc wo
to manufacture them cheaper than they do in
Kutnpc, unless wo get cheaper labor than they
have In Europe J'
"Then you think that the question of labor un
derlies tho whole subject:" "Of courso It dots,"
replied Mr. Blaine. "It Is, In fact, tho cutlro
question. Whenever we can forco carpenters,
!un"otn, Ironworkers and mechanics In every de
partment to work as cheaply nud live as poorly In
tho United States us similar workmen in Kurope,
we can, of course, manufacture just us cheaply us
they do In Kligland and France. But I um totally
opposed to a policy that would entail such re
sults. To attempt It Is equivalent to asocial nud
financial revolution, ono that would bring untold
distress."
" Yes, but might not tho great farming class be
bcnciltcd by Importing articles from Europe In
stead ot buying them at higher prices at home?"
"Tho moment," answered Mr. Blaine, "yon
begin to Import freely fio:u Europe you dr.vo our
own workmen from mcchuulcul nnd manufactur
ing pursuit;. Hi the same t roportlon they betoino
tillers of tho soil, Increasing steadily tho agri
cultural product and dicrcuslm: steadily the large
homo demand which Is constantly enlarging ns
homo manufacturers enlarge That of course,
works great Injury to tho farmer, glutting tho
market with his prodncts and tending constantly
tolowerprlcess. "
TIIYINO TO ECAltK THE FAHJ1KHS.
" Yes, but tho foroign demand for farm products
would t.o Increased In like ratio, would It not?"
' Even suppose It were," said Mr.Blolne, "how
do you know tho source from which It will be sup
plied. The tendency In ltuisla to-day uud lu the
Asiatic po.jscBslous of England Is toward a largo
luereaso of the grain supply, the grain being raised
by the clie-npjit po-slblo labor. Manufacturing
couutrlis will buy their breaelstufTs where they can
get them cheapest, uud the enlarging of the home
market for the American fanner being checked, he
would search In vuln for oneot the same value.
His foreign sales are already checked by tho treat
competition abroad. There never was a time when
tho mcreoBO of a large homo market wus so valu
able to 111 in. Tno best proof Is that tho farmers are
prospeious lu proportion to the nearness of mauu
rnctiir.ng centres, aud u protective tariff tcuds to
spread manufactures. In Ohio and Indiana, for
example, though not.. classed ih manufacturing
Mates, tho annual value of fabrics is larger thau
tho unnunl value ot agricultural products."
At this point Mr. limine entered into au explana
tion of tho low tariff of 1SI0 and Its results, claim
ing that its temporary Illusory prosperity was fol
lowed by jearB of depression und distress. "It
la remarkable, " said .Mr. Blaine, "that President
Polk recommended tho tariff of 1W6 on precisely
the same ground that President Cleveland recom
mends a similar enactment now, namely, the Bar
plus lu the Treasury wus menacing tno prosperity
of iho country. History Is repealing Itself."
UK WOULD MAKE NO C1IANUE.
The interview continues:
" Do j ou mean lo imply that thero should bo no
reduction of thu national roecnuo?"
"No, wiintlhavo said Implies tho reverse. I
would reduce It by u prompt repeal of tho tobacco
tax, aud would mako hero and thero somo chaugos
lu tho tariff not to roJuce protection, but wisely
foster It."
" Would you explain your meaning more fully?"
"I moan," Bald Mr. Maine, 'that no great
system of rovenuo like our tariff can operate with
ell'iclency and equity uulc.-s tbo changes of trado
be closely watched and thu law promptly adapted
to those change. But I would mako no change
that should Impair the protective character of tho
whole body of tho tariff laws. Four years ago, In
the net of 1S53. wo made chaugos of thu character
I have tried to Indicate. It such chuuges wcro
made, and the fortification of our seacOdBt thus
undertaken at a very moderate annual outlay.no
surplus would bo found after that ulreudy accumu
lated hud lie-en disponed of. Tho outlay ot money
on fort 111 cat lens, whllo doing great scrvlco to tho
cuuntry, would give good work to many men.''
But vhat nbout tho exlstlog suiplus?"
' Tno ubsiract ot tlu message I havo keen, "re
plied Mr. Blaine, ' contains no referenco to that
point. I, therefore, make!' no comment further
thau tu Indorse Mr. Fred Grant's remark that a
surplus Is nlwaj s easier to naud.e than u deficit. "
l'OSSIULE EFFECT OF 111K l'KKSIIlKNT'S l'OLICV.
The icporier repealed the question whether tho
President's recommendation would not, If adopted,
glee ub iho udtautugoof a largo Increase In ex
ports. 'I only repeat, "answered Mr. Blalno, "that It
would vastly cularco our Imports, whllo the only
export It would Berlously increase would be our
gold aud silver. Tnat would flow out bounteously,
just as It did under tho tariff of 116. Tho Presi
dent's recommendation enacted Into law would re
sult, us dl I nu cxperlinout lu drslnago of a man
who wlidicd to turn a swamp Into a productive
Held. Ho dug n drain to a neighboring river, but
It happened, unfortunately, that tho level of the
river was higher than tho level of tho swamp. Tho
consequence need not be told. A parallel would
bo found wheti the President's policy In attempt
ing to open a channel tor an Increase of exports
should slmplr succcod In making way tor a delug
ing Inflow ot fabrics to the destruction of homo In
dustry. "
OUH OWN MARKET FOB OUU OWN PEOrLE.
" But don't you think It Important to Increase
our export trade?"
" Undoubtedly ; but It Is vastly more Important
not to losu our own great market for our own
people In the vain effort to rcaca tho Impossible.
It Is not our foreign trade that has caused the
wonderful growth and expansion of tho Itepubllc
It Is tho vast domestic trade between thirty-eight
States and e ght Territories, with tholr population
of, perhaps, (VJ, 000, 000 lo-oar, Tho whole amount
of our export und Inn ort trade together has never,
I think, reached $1,500,000,000 auy ouo year. Our
Internal homo traJo on 130, OiO miles of railway,
along 15, W0 iriles ot ocean coast, over the live
great lakes nud along 20,000 miles of navigable
rivers, reaches the enormous annual aggrcguto ot
moro Hun Jto, ooo.iXk), 0 00, and perhaps this yoar
$j0,tsj0,0ti0,(i00.
ii.iism.eiar: free tradx'at noun.
" It Is Into this llllniltuble trade, even now In Its
Infancy aud destined to attain a magnitude not
dreamed of twenty years ago, that tho Europeans
nre struggling to enter. It la the hertlageof tho
American I eoplc, of their children and their chll
elreu's children. It gives au absolutely frco trade
over a territory nearly as large as all Europe, and
tho profit Is ull our own. The genuine Iree
trader appeals nnablo to see or comprehend that
this con.liuiitnl trade not our exchanges with
Europ-. Is the great source of our pro.perlly.
President Cleveland now plainly proposes a policy
that will admit Europe to a share of this trade."
A NEW I'Ol.ITlCAL ECONOMY NXEDtiD.
" But you are In favor of extending our foreign
trade, are you not?"
" Certainly I am, In all practical and advantage
ous ways, but not on the principle of tbe free
traders, by which wo shall be constantly exchang
ing dollar for dime. Moreover, Iho foreign trade Is
often very delcslvc. Co'.ton Is manufactured in the
city ot my residence. If a box ot cotton goods Is
scut, $op mljes lo thel'rovlnce of Now Brunswick,
It Is foreign trade.' 'if 'shipped' iT.WmlVc's round

menslty of Its Internal trade rqalro a new political
economy. Tho treatises wtltten for European
Btatcs do not grasp our peculiar situation."
THINKS THE FOUTIt NEEDS rnOTKCTION.
"How will the President's messngd bo taken In
the South ?" " I don't dare to answer that ques
tion. 1 ho truth has been so long obscured by cer
tain total questions of unreasoning prejudice that
nobody can hope for Industrial enlightenment
among tholr leaders Just yet. But In my view the
South abote all sections of tho Uulo'i needs a pro
tet'tno tariff. Tno tno Virginias, Norm Carolina,
Kentucky, Missouri, Tenncsico, Alabama and
Georgia havo enormous resources and facilities for
developing and handling manufactures. They
cannot do anything wltliout protection. Even
progress so vaetassomcof these Slates have made
will bo checked if tho President's mesmgo fs en
acted Into law. Their Sonators and Representa
tives can prevent It, but they are so used to follow
Ing anything labelled ' Democratic 'that very prob
ubly tney will follow tho President nnd bl'ght the
progress already made. By tho timo somo of the
Southern States get Irto Iron oro nnd coal, whllo
tobaeco Is taxed, they may havo occu-lon to sit
down and calculate the valao of Democratic tree
trade to their local Interests. "
THE FALLACY OF A1IU1TTINO HAW MATERIAL.
" Will not tho President's recommendation to
admit raw mater. al Snd strong support?"
"Not by wlie protectionists In our lime. Per
hnps some greedy inaunfa Hirers may think that
wltn tie) coal or free iron oro they can do great
things, but It they should succeed In trying will,
us the boys say, culch it nn tho rebound. If tho
homo trado In raw material Is destroyed or seri
ously Injured railroads will bo tho first to feel It.
If that vast Inti rest Is crippled In uny direction the
financial fabnoof tho whole country wll fed It
quickly nnd serlouslr. II uny man can give a rea
son why we should nrranje tho tariff to favor the
raw material ot other countries In a competition
against our material ot tho samo kind, I should
like to bear It. shoulJ that recommendation of
tho Presldtnt bo approved It would turn 100,000
American laborers out of employment beforo It
had been a year in operation. "
A I-ULL AND FAIR CONTEST ON TUE ISSUE.
"What must bo the marked and general effect
of t'uo President's messnge ?"
"It will bring tho country where It ought to be
brought to n lull nnd fair contest on the question
of protection. The President himself makes It
the one Issuo by presenting no other In his mes
sage. 1 think It well to have the question settled.
The Democratic party m power Is n standing men
ace to the Industrial prosperity of the country.
That menaco should be removed or tho policy It
foreshadows should bo mado certain. Nothing Is
so mischievous to business as uncertainty, nothing
so paralyzing as doubt. "
