ieaslng to be able to say that things
ww dona before we can do now."
; -I know whereof I speak," he de
la red.
The president sail at the Red
mea meeting:
"1 am Just as proud of what the
Vmerican Red Cross does as though
wera an intimate and active par
Jrtpan In all its programs. It is one
f the finest manifestations of the
4ter side of America that has ever'
-en shown. I hope with all my
seart that much of the big work
hich ha been yours In the past will
vrr be asked of you again. It
Till be a wonderful thing for me and
on to have lived in a period when
v nave brought the conscience of
r sr.Vind into an understanding
ihere we shall have done something
anetble to prevent calling on- you
44j for war service.
"And I like to say it to you,
buuM knew whereof I spsak.
' We are going to succeed beyond
ewr fondest hopes; it is getting
te be so pleasing to be able to

anything impossible when the
caneaience of present day civili
aation is fixed en that accom-
ptrshment.

eaure to say I hope your syni
thiea and your humanities and

nations and your generosity shall

ttahia misfortunes and those ines
ipable sufferings which come now

DEMOCRAT C SENATOR
ASSAILS SPEECH OF
HARDING
PARTISAN
WASHINGTON. Dec. 8 The Re
publican party's leadership was as
sailed in a speech in the senate yes
terday by Senator Harrison, Demo
crat of Mississippi, who declared
President Harding was dalng "the
verytWngs for which he as a senator
had denounced President Wilson."
The president's message, he added,
constituted an appeal to partisanship
and warning to Republicans to dis
avow their allegiance to "bloc' or
ganization. Mr. Harrison attacked the senate
Republican leaders, saying they had
"shifted and hopped until none of us
knew where or when or why." Sec
retary Mellon also was denounced as
seeking, in his annual report, to "help
along" the ideas of President Hard
ing with respect of "relieving the
rich of heavy taxation."
When Mr. Wilson opposed or urged
legislation, Mr. Harrison continued,
the then Senator Harding declared
him as a "dictator and an autocrat,"
and when Mr. Wilson issued his ap
peal in 1918 for the eelction of a
Democratic congress, Mr. Harding
was equally bitter in his denounce
ment. "Yet we have the spectacle.' he
said, "of the president making c
speech against the soldier bonus, a
thing unprecedented. Then yesterday
he appealed to the agricultural group
to line up to get behind the party
banner."
He said he was confident there had
been a misprint in the president's
message, where Mr. Harding bad ex
pressed appreciation of the "signal
achievements" of the extra session.
What the president meant, he added,
probably was "single achievement."

A letter, written by King Charles 1
to his father, James 1, when he was
a 10-year-old boy, has been discover
ed in an old house in Edinburgh. The
crypt museum of Parliament House
paid t0,000 for the letter.
DOUBLE MISS
' "I shall miss you while you are on
your hunting trip, dear," murmured
his wife affectionately; " and I shall
pray that the men you are going with
will do the same." Boston T can-script.

Altogether it is such a collection of new styles as one would expect to see at
the grand opening of a fashion show, and never in a clearance sale. But the
good part of it is that they ARE in a clearance sale and one in which the
greatly reduced prices mean more than usual because the fine styles were
marked closer in the first place than before. (Second Floor)
