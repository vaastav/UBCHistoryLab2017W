OF 2D MESSAGE
Sent to Congress by President
Tall At Today's Session
Between raited States, Great Britain
and France aad Hopes Senate Will
Ratify Them at Once First 0 facial
Statement Why Troops Were Sent
to Mexican Border.
WWbiagton, Dec. 7. Peace is tie
keynote of President Taft's message
on foreign relatioaia, which, wa sent
to congress today. After ceiling at
tention to the fact that tbe United
States 1 at present on the most
cordial term with ell the other
world power, President Taft lauds
the arbitration treaties, wtich thla
country 4wa negotiated with Great
Britain and France and exprceses (be
sincere hope that the senate will rati
fy them at once.
Upon the topic of "Arbitration," the
President has the following to say:
"The year Just passed mark an Im
portant general moranent on the part
o. rthe growers for broader arbkr.
tion. ' In the recognition of the mani
fold beneffts to mankind In the ex
tension of toe policy of Ge ettle
nent of International dispute by ar-
irtrauon rather than by war, and In
response to a wide-apead demand for
an advance in that direction on tbe
part of the people of (be United State
and of Great Britain and of France,
the terms of which designed, as ex
pressed la the preample of tfteae
treaties, to extend the acope and obli
gation of the policy of arbitration
adopted In our present treaties wKa
tbese government. Tq pave tha way
for thi treaty wiin" tie United State,
Great Britain negotiated aa import
snt modiflcatlon In ft alliance with
Japan, ami the French government
also expedited tbe engotlations with
signal good wL" - .
The message contains the first of
ficial explanation of the movement
of United States troop along the
Mexican border at the time of the
Madero revolution In Mexico. The
president stated that advices from
Henry Lane Wilson, United State
Ambassador at Mexico City, indicated
that the ituation In Mexico wa
much graver than pre dispatches
implied. Fearing for the lien of tbe
40,000 American In Mexico, Mr. Taft
"took a good deal of responsibility,"
aa be phase ft, tnd o rdered out the
soldier and war ship. At the same
time President Taft notified President
DIas, of Mexico, that no alarm need
be felt aa the troop were to be used
only to enforce neutrality and to pre
vent the shipment of arm across the
Rio Grande from the American aide.
The frtondshlp of the United State
with Mexico la now closer than ever,
the nnweag say. Touching upon
the anti-Mad ero revolution, lnaugurat
ed by Gen . Bernardo Reyes, who was
arrested fry the federal authorities
for plotting an inanrrenctlon against
a friendly power, on United State
soil, the president declared that thka
country was merely following out a
policy of respecting tbe contempora
neous recognised constitutional au
thority in Mexico.
President Taft aUo voiced bis
pleasure that war bad twen probably
averted by the United States la act
ing as mediator In a boundary dis
pute between Haiti and Santo Dom
ingo and bttweott Oosta Rica and
Panama.
The message touches lightly upon
the revolution In China. In reference
to loan for railroal construction and
currency reform, ia whldt American
financier figured.
. Tbe message deplores the war be
tween Italy and Turky but It wa
wtth saUsfaotkin Chat Mr. Taft called
attention to the fact that K could In
no wis embroil the United State.
Attention W called to tte work of
the ofsum comm barton now sitting at
the Hague whkn I trying to curtail
traffic In dangerous drugs and It &
pointed out that the trade of the
United Stat s for the flacal year end
ing June 30, lsll were 12,000.000,000,
a gain of tJOO.000,000 over tloae of
the previous year.
President Taft ay there 1 a cry
ing need for an American merchant
marine and again wek congress to
grant ub4dy that nn-rchaat
marine service . may be built up. .

office. The proceeding i pronounced
illegal and dlsoourteous. He declares
that rome of ths members of the
