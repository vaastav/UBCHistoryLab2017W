HIKAM II. 1JENNEK. 1

BY PAUL H. HAYNE. ! I
Dedicated to the Wife of thin Hero and Martyr. When
the drums beat and the trumpets blare, I
When banners tlaunt in the stormy air, I 1
When at thought of deeds that must soon be done c
The hearts of a thousand leap up as one? t
Who could not rush through the din and smoke,
The cannon's crash and the sabre stroke, :
Scarce conscious of ebbing blood or breath, I
With a laugh for wounds and a scoff at death? ! I
But when on the sullen breeze there comes ; e
No thrill of trumpets nor throb of drums, (
But only the wail of the sick laid low j
Bv the treacherous blight of a viewless foe?
Who, then, will upgira his loins for tight I t
With the loathsome Pest in the poisoned night, ' 1
No martial music his pulse to start, [
But the still small voice of the ruthful heart? ;
Who then? Behold him, the calm, the brave, i f
On his billowy path to an alien grave! j
Serene in the charm of his God like will, . t
The soldier is armored to save, not kill. 1
Ah ! swiftly he speeds on the mist-bound stream ' i
This Pilgrim wrapped in his tender dream,
His vision of help for the sick laid low | c
U., t Kn ooil unito nf ?n simhtished foe. 1 9
Ah! swiftly he speeds 'mid the hollow boom : c
Of bells that are tolling to death and doom, j t
Till even the sounds of the hells grow still; 1
k. For the hands of their ringers are lax and chill,
And the hum ol the mourners is heard no more j i
On the misty slope and the vacant shore, j e
And the few" frail creatures that greet him seem
But the ghosts of men by a phantom stream.
f
Still the hero bis own great soul enticed, j
To suffer and toil in the name of Christ. > 8
He follows wherever his Lord has led, i a
To the famished hut or the dying bed. j ,
He medicines softly the fevered pain; \ .
To the starving he bringeth his golden grain ; 1
And ever before him and ever above C
Is the sheen of the unfurled wings of Love. j
Meanwhile, in his distant home, are those V
That his going has robbed of their sweet repose. v
The days pass by them like leaden years; j
The nights are bitter with tears and fears? J
Till, at last, by the lightning glamour sped, t
Comes?a name and date, with the one word, f
"Dead!"
And the arms of the Smitten are lifted high 8
And the heavens are rent by an anguished cry! t
Dead ! dead ! Vain word for the wise to hear! 1
How false its echo on heart and ear! j t
To earth and earth's he may close his eyes? i j
But who dares tell us a Martyr dies f
And of him just gone it, were best to say 1 *
That in some charmed hour of night or day? I t
Having given us all that his soul could give? j |

Fellow- Citizens of the Senate t
and House of Representatives: t

Wm> vine Being, who holds in His bands the des- l
n tinies of nations, for the continued bestowal, a
mUK during the last year, of countless blessings 1
MB upon our country. I
wmffi We are at peace with all other nations, a
Hr&g Our public credit has greatly improved, and t
HBp .is perhaps, now stronger than ever before.
Abundant harvests have rewarded the labors t
of those who till the soil, our manufacturing 1
industries are reviviug, and it is believed that | j
general prosperity, which has been so long : g
anxiously looked for, is at last within our j a
reach. 1
The enjoyment of health by our people
generally has, however, been interrupted, t
during the past seasou, by the prevalence of l
a fatal pestilence, the yellow fever, in some r
B portions of the southern States, creating an l
IBra| emergency which called for prompt and ex- e
traordinary measures of relief. The disease u
appeared as an epidemic at New Orleans and i c
at other places on the lower Mississippi, soon ' e
after mid-summer. It was rapidly spread f
BBjSft by fugitives from the infected cities and I
towns, aud did not disappear until early in e
KB November. The States of Louisiana, Missis a
KiBp sippi and Teunessee have suffered severe!}, a
About one hundred thousand cases are be- s
lieved to have occurred, of which about I
twenty thousand, according to intelligent es- t
W timates, proved fatal. It is impossible to esti t
9 mate, with auy approach to accuracy, the loes I
f to the country occasioned hy this epidemic. | g
[ It is to be reckoned by the hundred millions j e
of dollars. The suffering and destitution that! <i
resulted, excited the deepest sympathy in ill j t
parts of the Union. Physiciaus and nurses q
hastened from every quarter to the assistance ! ?i
of the afflicted communities. Voluntary con- | f
tributious of money and supplies, in every ; i
needed form, were speedily and generously a
furnished. The Government was able to re. j r
spond in some measure to the call for help, l
i / i r I
by providing tents, medicines, anu iuou ior i
the sick aud destitute, the requisite directions | v
for the purpose being given in the confident f
expectation that this action of the Executive e
would receive the sanctiou of Congress, f
About eighteen hundred teuts, aud rations I
of the value of about tweuty-five thousand I ?
dollars, were sent to cities and towns which 1 <1
applied for them, full details of which will be s
furnished to Cougress by the proper Depart- J r
ment. j a
The fearful spread of this pestilence has | \
awakened a very general public sentiment in j ^
favor of national sanitary administration, j 1
which shall not only control quarantine, but ; 1
have the sanitary supervision of internal com- j 1
rnerce in times of epidemics, and hold an ad 1 a
visory relation to the state and municipal i11
health authorities, with power to deal with i
whatever endangers the public health, and I J
which the municipal and state authorities are t
unable to regulate. The national quarantine I s
act, approved April 29,1878, which was passed
too late in the last session of Congress to pro- r
vide the means for carryiug it into practical : 1
operation, during the past session, is a step in j i
. the direction here indicated. In view of the | i
necessity for the most effective measures, by i t
quarantine and otherwise, for the protection j e
of our seaports and the country generally, t
from this aud other epidemics, it is recomend- r
ed that Congress give to the whole subject r
early and careful consideration. j i
The permanent pacificatiou of the country j *
by the complete protection of all citizeus in 1
every civil political right, continues to be of r
paramount interest with the great body of j ^
our people. Every step in this direction is |1
welcomed with public approval, and every in- . 1
terruption of steady and uniform progress to I
the desired consummation awakens general *
uneasiness aud widespread condemnation. ;
The recent Congressional elections have fur- 8
nished a direct and trustworthy test of the ,
advance thus lar made in the practicaj estab- |(
lishment of the right of suffrage, secured by *
the Constitution to the liberuted race in the ;
C...nkoMi Stutoa All disturbing influences, t
~ ? o
real or imaginary, bad beeu removed from all ^
of these States.
The three constitutional amendments, which (
conferred freedom and equality of civil and j i
political rights upon the colored people of the c
South, were adopted by the concurrent action ?
of the great body of good citizens who main- 1
tained the authority of the national govern- (
ment and the integrity and perpetuity of the 1
Union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a f
wise and necessary embodiment in the organic i
law of the just results of the war. The peo- 1
pie of the former slaveholdiug States accepted t
these results, and gave, in every practicable t
form, assurances that the thirteenth, fourteenth t
and fifteenth amendments, and laws passed in
k pursuance thereof, should, in good faith, be : s
enforced, rigidly and impartially, in letter j
and spirit, to the end that the humblest citi- i
Z^-n, without distinction of race or color, t
fc should, under them, receive full and equal t
W protection in person and property, and in po- j a
fitical rights and privileges. By these copsti- j r
utional amendment8, the southern section of
he Union obtained a large increase of politi:al
power in Congress aud the electoral colege,
and the country justly expected that
(lections would proceed, as to the enfranchised
-ace, upon the same circumstances of legal
md constitutional freedom and protection
vhich obtained in all the other States of the
Juiou. The friends of law and order looked
orward to the conduct of these elections, as
jflering to the general judgment of the counry
an opportunity to measure the degree in
vhich the right of suffrage could be exercised
>y the colored people, and would be respected
>y their fellow-citizens ; but a more general
mjoyraent of freedom of suffrage by the col>red
people, and a more just and generous
jrotectiou of that freedom by the cotnmuniies
of which they form a part, were geueraly
anticipated than the recent record of the
flections discloses. In some of those States
n which the colored people have been unable
o make their opin:ons felt in the elections,
he result is mainly due to influences not easiV
measured or remedied by legal protection ;
. .. .L- cu_. ct

at large, and in some particular congresional
districts outside of these States, the re:ords
of the elections seem to compel the conriusiori
that the rights of the colored voters
lave been overridden, and their participation
n the elections not permitted to be either genral
or free.
It will be for the Congress for which these
lections were held, to make such examinaions
into their conduct as may be appropriite
to determine tbe validity of the claims of
nembers to their seats, in the meantime, it
>ecome8 the duty of the Executive and Julicial
departments of the government, each
u its province, to inquire into and punish
dotations of the laws of the United States
vhich have occurred. I can hut repeat what
said in this connection in my last message,
hat whatever authority rests with me to this
nd I shall not hesitate to put forth, and I
im unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to
he legislatures, the courts, the executive auhorities,
and the people of these States where
hese wrongs have been perpetrated, to give
heir assistance towards bringing to justice
he offenders and preventing a repetition of
hecriraes. No means within my power will
>e spared to obtain a full and fair investigaiou
of the alleged crimes, and to secure the
:onviction aud just punishment of the guilty.
It is to be observed that the priucipal ap
iropriatiou made for the Department of Jus
ice at the last session contaiued the following
ilause: "And for defraying the expenses
vhich may be incurred in the enforcement of
he act approved February twenty-eight,
ighteen hundred and seventy-one, entitled
An act to amend an act approved May thir
-i ?i
leifl, eignieeu nuuuieu ttuu ocvcmj, cimucu
.0 act to enforce the rights of citizens of the
Jnited States to vote in the several States of
he Union, and for other purposes,' or any
,ets amendatory thereof or supplementary
hereto."
It is the opinion of the Attorney General
hat the expenses of these proceedings will
argely exceed the amount which was thus
irovided, and I rely confidently upon Confess
to make adequate appropriation to cable
the Executive Department to enforce the
aws.
I respectfully urge upon your attention
hat the congressional elections, in every disrict,
in a very important sense, are justly a
natter of political interest and concern
hroughout the whole country. Each state,
very political party, is entitled to the share
if power which is conferred by the legal and
:oustitutioual suffrage. It is the right of
very citizen, possessing the qualifications
described by law, to cast one unintimidated
(allot, and to have his ballot honestiy countd.
So long as the exercise of this power
,nd the enjoyment of this right are coramou
ud equal, practically as well as formally,
ubmission to the result of the suffrage will
>e accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all
he departments of government will feel the
rue vigor of the popular will thus expressed,
tfo temporary or administrative interests of
;overnment, however urgent or weighty, will
ver displace the zeal of our people in defence
if the primary rights of citizenship. They
inderstand that the protection of liberty rejuires
the maintenance, in full vigor, of the
uanly methods of free speech, free press, and
ree suffrage, and will sustain the full authorty
of government to enforce the laws which
re framed to preserve these inestimable
ights. The material progress and welfare of
he states depend on the protection afforded
o their citizens. There can ne no peace
without such protection, no prosperity without
leace, and the whole country is deeply interred
in the growth and prosperity of all its
>arts.
While the country has not yet reached compete
unity of feeling and reciprocal coufilence
between the communities so lately and
o seriously estranged, I feel an absolute assuance
that the tendencies are in^hat direction,
md with increasing force. The power of pubic
opinion will override all political prejutices,
and all sectional or State attachments,
demanding that all over our wide territory
he name and character of citizen of the Unied
States shall mean one and the same thing,
.nd carry with them unchallenged security
ind respect.
Our relations with other countries continue
leaceful. Our neutrality in contests between
oreign powers has been maintained and repected.
The Universal Exposition held at Paris duing
the past summer, has been attended by
arge numbers of our citizens. The brief peiod
allowed for the preparation and arrangeuent
of the contributions of our citizens to
his great Exposition, was well employed in
snergetic and judicious efforts to overcome
his disadvantage. These efforts, led aud diected
by the Commissioner General, were renarkably
successful, and the exhibition of
American industry was creditable and gratiying
in scope and character. The reports of
he United States commissioners, giving its
esults in detail, will be duly laid before you.
)ur participation in this international compeition
for the favor and the trade of the world
nay be expected to produce useful and imjortant
results, in promoting intercourse,
'riendship, aud commerce with other nations.
In accordance with the provisions of the
tct ofFcbruury 28, 1878, three commissioners
vere appointed to an international conference
>n the subject of adopting a common ratio
jetween gold aud silver, for the purpose of
'stahlishim/. internationally, the use of biine
O' # w '
,alic money, and securing fixity of relative
ralue between those metals.
Invitations were addressed to the various
jovernments which had expressed a willingiess
to participate in its deliberations. The
^inference held its meetings in Paris, in Au
;ust last. The report of the commissioners
lerewith submitted, will show its results. No
;ommon ratio between gold and silver could
)e agreed upon by the conference. The gen?ral
conclusion was reached that it is necessa y
to maintain in the world the monetary
unctions of silver as well as of gold, leaving
lie selection of the use of one or the other of
hese two metals, or of both, to be made by
iach State.
Congress having appropriated, at its last
ession, the 911111 of 85,500,000 to pay the
tward of the Joint Commission at Halifax,
f, after correspondence with the British Government,
on the subject of the conformity of
he award to the requirements of the treaty
ind to the terms of the question thereby subletted
to the Commission, the President shall
deem it his duty to make the payment, communications
upon these points were addressed
j to the British Government, through the lega- j
i tion of the United States at London. Failing
to obtain the concurrence of the ^British !
i Government in the views of this Government I
I respecting the award, I have deemed it my
duty to tender the sum named, within the j
year fixed by the treaty, accompauied by a
notice of the grounds of the payment, and a
protest against auy other construction of the
i same. The correspondence upon the subject j
will be laid before you.
The Spanish Government has officially an-1
j nouneed the termination of the insurrection I
| in Cuba, and the restoration of peace throughjout
that island. Confident expectations are '
1 expressed of a revival of trade and prosperi- j
ty, which it is earnestly hoped may prove I
well-founded. Numerous claims of American
" . ? ~c I
Citizens lor injuries or restoration ui piupcity |
have been among the incidents of the long |
continued hostilities. Some of these claims
are in process of adjustment by Spain, and
the others are proraieed early and.careful consideration.
The treaty made with Italy, in regard to
the reciprocal consular privileges, has been
duly ratified and proclaimed.
No questions of grave importance have
arisen with any other of the Europeau powers.
The Japanese Government has been desirous
of a revision of such parts of the treaties
with foreign powers as relate to commerce,
and, it is understood, has addressed to each of
the treaty powers a request to open negotiations
with that view. The United States has
been inclined to regard the matter favorably.
Whatever restrictions upon trade with Japan
are found injurious to that people, cannot but i
affect, injuriously, nations holding commercial
intercourse with them. Japau, after a
| long period of seclusion, has, within the past
few years, made rapid strides in the path of
| enlightenment and progress, and, not unreasonably,
is lookiug forward to the time when
her relations with the nations of Europe and
America shall be assimilated to those which
they hold with each other. A treaty looking
to this end has been made, which will be sub!
mitted to the consideration of the Senate.
After an interval of several years, the ChiI
nese Government has again sent euvoys to the
I United States. They have been received, and
i a permanent legation is now established here
! by that Government. It is not doubted that
j this step will be of advantage to both nations
j in promoting friendly relations and removing

now in operation, and a survey and soundings
of the harbor of Pago-Pago have been made
by a uaval vessel of the United States, with
| a view of its occupation as a naval station, if
found desirable to the service. '
Since the resumption of diplomatic relations
with Mexico, correspondence has been opened
and still continues between the two Governments
upon the various questions which at
one time seemed to endanger their relations,
j While no formal agreement has been reached
I as to the troubles on the border, much has
; been done to repress and diminish them. The
| effective force of United States troops on the
Rio Grande, by a strict and faithful compli!
ance with instructions, has done much to reI
move the sources of dispute, and it is now unI
derstood that a like force of Mexican trcops
! on the other side of the river, is also making
' an energetic movement against the marauding
Indian tribes. This government looks, with
j the greatest satisfaction, upon every evidence
| of strength in the national authority of Mex!
ico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent
i or to punish incursions upou our territory.
Reluctant to assume any action or attitude in
i the control of these incursions, by military
| movements across the border, not imperativeI
ly demanded for the protection of the lives
i and property of our own citizens, I shall take
! the earliest opportunity, consisteut with the
! proper discharge of this plain duty, to recogI
uize the ability of the Mexican government
to restrain, effectively, violations of our territory.
It is proposed to hold, next year, an international
exhibition in Mexico, and it is be
lieved that the display of the agricultural and
manufacturing products of the two nations
will tend to a better understanding and increased
commercial intercourse between their
people.
With Brazil and the Republics of Central
aud South America, some steps have been
taken toward the development of closer commercial

Bolivia. A bouudary question between the
1 Argentine Republic and Paraguay has been
' submitted,by those Governments, for arbilra;
tion, to the President of the Uuited States,
i and I have, after careful examination, given
a decision upon it.
A naval expedition up the Amazon and
Madeira rivers has brought back information,
valuable both for scientific and commercial
purposes. A like expedition is about visiting
the coast of Africa and the Iudian ocean.
The reports of diplomatic and consular offi
cers in relation to *he development of our foreign
commerce, have furnished many facts
that have proved of public interest, and have
stimulated to practical exertion the enterprise
of our people.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
furnishes a detailed statement of the operations
of that department of the Government,
and of the condition of the public finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources for
th^ fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, were
8257,763,878.70: the ordinary expenditures
! for the same period were 8236,964,326.80?
leaving a surplus reveuue for the year, of
820,799,551.01.
The receipts for the present fiscal year, end!
ing June 30, 1879, actual and estimated, are
as follows: Actual receipts for the first quarter,commencing
July 1,1878, $73,389,743.43;
! estimated receipts for the remaining threequarters
of the year, $191,110,256.57; total
receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and
estimated, $264,500,000. The expenditures
for the same period will be, actual and esti,
mated, as follows: For the quarter commen1
eing July 1, 1878, actual expenditures, $73,344,573.27;
and for the remaining threequarters
of the year, the expenditures are es j
! timuted at $166,755,426.73?making the total !
! expenditures $240,100,000 ; and leaving an j
estimated surplus revenue, ror me year enamg
i June 30, 1879, of ?24,400,000.
The total receipts during the next fiscal
j year, ending June 30, 1880, estimated according
to existing laws, will be ?264,500,000 ;
and the estimated ordinary expenditures, for
the same period, will be ?235,320,412.68;'
j leaving a surplus of ?28,179,587.32 for that!
i year.
In the foregoing statements of expenditures,
actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for |
the sinking fund provided for by the act up- i
proved February 25,1862, which requires that !
one per cent, of the entire debt of the United !
States shall be purchased or paid within each !
S fiscal year, to be set apait as a sinking-fund. ,
: There has been, however, a substantial corn- !
pliance with the coudiiious of the law. By i
! its terms, the public debt should have been i
I reduced, between 1862 and the close of the i
! last fiscal year, ?518,361,806.28; the actual;
reduction of the ascertained debt, in that pe- I
. riod, has been ?720.644,739 01 ; being in ex- i
cess of the reduction required by the siukingI
fund act-8202,282,933.33.
The amount of the public debt, less cash
| in the Treasury, ^November 1, 1878, was I
I ?2,024,200.083,18?a reduction, since the j
I same date last year, of ?23,150,617.39.
The progress made "during the last year, in
refuudiug the public debt at lower rates of
interest, is very gratifying. The amount of
four per cent, bonds aold during the present
year prior to November 23, 1878, is $100,270,900,
and six per cent, bonds, commonly
known as five twenties, to an equal amount,
have been, or will be reedemed as calls mature.
It has been the policy of the department to
place the four cent, bonds within easy reach
of every citizen who desires to invest his savings,
whether small or great, in these securities.
The Secretary of the Treasury recommends
that the law be 30 modified, that small
sums may be invested, and that through the
post offices, or other agents of the government,
the freest opportunity may be given in all
parts of the country for such investments.
The best mode suggested is, that the Department
be authorized to issue certificates of
deposit, of the denomination of ten dollars,
bearing interest at the rate 3.65 per cent, per
annum and convertible at any tims within
one year after their issue into the four per
cent bonds authorized by the refunding act,
and to be issued only in exchange for United
States notes sent to the Treasury by mail or
otherwise. Such a provision of law, supported
by suitable regulations, would enable
any person, readily, without cost or risk, to
convert his money into interest-bearing securities
of the United States, and money so received
could be applied to the redemption of
six per cent, bonds.
The coinage of gold during the last fiscal
year was 852,758,980. The coinage of silver
dollars, under the act passed February 28,
1878, amounted on the 23d of November,
1878, to 819,814,550, of which amount 84,984,947
are in circulation, and the balance,
814,829,603 is still in the possession of the
Government.
With views unchanged with regard to the
act under which the coinuge of silver proceeds,
it has been the purpose of the Secretary
faithfully to execute the law, and to
afford a fair trial to the measure.
In the present financial condition of the
country, I am persuaded that the welfare of
legitimate business and industry of every description
will be best promoted by abstaining
from all attempts to make radical changes
iu the existing financial legislation. Let it
be understood that during the coming year
the business of the country will be undisturbed
by governmental interference wti.h the
laws affecting it, and we may confidently expect.
that the resumption of specie payments,
which will take place at the appointed time,
will be successfully and easily maintained,
and that it will be followed by a healthful
and enduring revival of business prosperity.
Let the healing influence of time, the inherent
energies of our people, and the boundless
resources of our country, have a fair opportunity,
and relief from the present difficulties
will surely follow.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
that the army has beeu well and economically
supplied, that our small force has been actively
employed, and has faithfully performed
all the service required of it. The morale
of the army h88 improved, and the number
of desertions has materially decreased during
the year.
The Secretary recommends?
1. That a peusion be grated to the widow
of the late Lieutenant Hiram H. Banner, 18th
Infantry, who lost his life by yellow fever
while in command of the steamer J.M.Chambers,
sent with supplies for the relief of sufferers
in the South from that disease.
2. The establishment of the annuity s< heme
for the benefit of the heirs of deceased officers,
as suggested by the Paymaster General.
3. The adoption by Congress of a plan for
the publication of the records of the War of
the Rebellion, now being prepared for that
purpose.
4. The increase of the extra per diem of
soldier teachers employed in the post schools,
and liberal appropriations for the erection of
buildings for schools and libraries at the different
posts.
5. The repeal or amendment of the act of
June 18, 1878, forbidding the "use of the army
as a posse comitatus, or otherwise, for the
purpose of executiug the laws, except in such
cases and under such circumstances as may
be expressly authorized by the Constitution
or by act of Congress."
6. The passage of a joint resolution of Congress
legalizing the issues of rations, tents and
medicines which were made for the relief of
sufferers from yellow fever.
7. That provisions be made for the erection
of fire-p?oof building for the preservation of
certain valuable, records, now constantly exposed
to destruction by fire.
The recommendations are all commended
to your favorable consideration.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows that the navy has improved during the
last fiscal year. Work has been doue on seventy-five
vessels, ten of which have been
thoroughly repaired, aud made ready for
sea. Two others are in rapid progress towards
completion. The total expenditures
of the year, including the amount appropriated
for the deficiencies of the previous year,
were 817,468,392.65. The actual expenses
chargeable to the year, exclusive of these de
ficiencies, were 813,306,914.09, or 8767,199.18
less than those of the previous year, and 84,928,677
74 less than the expenses, including
the deficiencies. The estimates for the fiscal
year, ending June 30, 1880, are $14,562,381.45?exceeding
the appropriations of the
present year only 833,949 75 ; which excess
is occasioned by the demands of the Naval
Academy and the Marine Corps, as explained
in the Secretary's report. The appropriations
for the present fiscal year are 814,528,431.70,
which, in the opinion of the Secretary,
will he ample for all the current expenses
of the Department, during the year. The
amount drawn from the Treasury from July
1, to November 1, 1878, is 84,740,544.14, of
which 870,980,75 has been refunded, leaving
as the expenditure for that period, 84,669,563.39,
or 8520,899 24 less than the corresponding
period of the last fiscal year.
The report of the Postmaster General erabraces
a detailed statement of the: operations
of the Post Office department. The expenditures
of that Department for the fiscal year
ended June, 30, 1878, were 834,165,084.49.
The receipts, including sales of stamps, money
order business, and offical stamps, were
829,277,516.95. The sum of 8290,436.99, included
iu the foregoing statement of expenditures,
is chargeable to preceding years,
so that the actual expenditures for the fiscal j
year ended June 30,1878, are 833,874,647.50.
The amount drawn from the Treasury on appropriations,
in addition to the revenues of
the Department, was 85,307,652.82. The
expenditures for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1880, are estimated at 836,571,900, and
the receipts from all sources at 830,664,023.90,
leaving a deficiency to be appropriated
out of the Treasury of 85,907,876.10. The
report calls attention to the fact that the
compensation of postmasters and of railroads
for carrying the mail, is regulated by law, and
that the failure of Congress to appropriate
the amounts required for these purposes, does
uot relieve the Government of responsibility,
but necessarily increases the deficiency bills
which Congress will be called upon to pass.
In providing for the postal service, the following
questions are presented : Should Congress
annually appropriate a sum for its ex- <
penses largely in excess of its revenue, or should
' n ? ! 1 -1 *11
guch rates or postage ne esiuDiisnea as win i
raake the Department self-sustaining ? Should
the postal service be reduced by excluding i
from the mails matter which does not pay its |
way? Should the number of post-routes be !
diminished ? Should other methods be adop- J
ted which will increase the revenues or diminish
tlie expenses of the postal service?
The International Postal Congress, which i
met at Paris May 1, 1878, and continued in i
session until June 4, of the same year, was !
composed of delegates, fnra nearly all the
civilized countries of the world. It adopted j
a new convention, to take the place of the
treaty concluded at Berne, October 9, which
goes into effect on the 1st of April, 1879, between
countries whose delegates have signed
it. It was ratified and approved, by and
with the consent of the President, August 13,
1878. A synopsis of the Universal Postal
Convention will be found in the report of the
Postmaster General, and the full text in the
appendix thereto. In its origin, the Postal
Union comprised twenty-three countries, bav
ing a population of three hundred and fifty
millions of people. On the 1st of April
next, it will comprise forty-three countries and
colonies, with a population of more than six
hundred and fifty millions of people, and
will soon, by the accession of the few remaining
countries and colonies which maintain organized
postal services, constitute, in fact as
well as in name, as its new title indicates, a
Universal Union, regulating, upon a uniform
basis of cheap postage rates, the postal intercourse
between all civilized nations.
Some embarrassment has arisen out of the
conflict between the custom laws of this country
and the provisions of the postal convention,
in regard to the transmission of foreigu
books ahd newspapers to this country by
mail. It is hoped that Congress will be able
to devise some means of reconciling the difficulties
which have thus been created, so as
to do justice to all parties involved.
The business of the Supreme Court, and of
the courts in many of the circuits, has increased
to such an extent during the past years,
that additional legislation is imperative to
relieve and prevent the delay of justice, and
possible oppression to suitors, which is thus
occasioned. The encumbered condition of
these dockets is presented anew in the report
of the Attorney General, and the remedy
suggested is earnestly urged for congressional
action. The creation of additional circuit

than 860,000 a year.
The anuual reports of the Secretary of the
Interior and of the Commissioner of Indian
Affairs, present an elaborate account of the
present condition of the Indian tribes and of
that branch of the public service which ministers
to their interests. While the conduct
of the Indians, generally, has beeu orderly,
and their relations with their neighbors friendly
and peaceful, two local disturbances have
occurred, which were deplorable in their
character, but remained, happily, confined to
a comparatively small number of Indians.
The discontent among the Bannocks, which
led first to some acts of violence on the part
of some members of the tribe and finally
to the outbreak, appears to have been caused
by an iasufficsency of food on the reservation,
and this insufficiency to have been
owing to the inadequacy of the appropriations,
made by Congress, to the wants of the Indians,
at a time when the Indians were prevent- |
ed from supplying the deficiency by hunting.
After an arduous pursuit by the troops of the
United States, and several engagements, the i
hostile Iudians were reduced to subjection,
and the larger part of them surrendered themselves
as prisoners. In this connection, I desire
to eall attention to the recommendation
made by the Secretary of the Interior, that
a sufficient fund be placed at the disposal of
the Executive, to be used, with proper accountability,
at bis discretion, in sudden
emergencies of the Indian service.
The other case of disturbance was that of a
hand of Northern Cheyennes who suddenly
left their reservation in the Indian Teritory
and marched rapidly through the states of
Kansas and Nebraska in the direction of their
old hunting-grounds, committing murders
and other crimes on their way. From documents
accompanying the report of the Secretary
of the Interior, it appears that this disorderly
band was as fully supplied with the
necessaries of life as the four thousand seven
hundred other Indians who remained quietly
on the reservation, and thai the disturbance
.n..c >.. iioorl ho mun nf n restlpsH nnd mirhipv
ous disposition among the Indians themselves.
Almost the whole of this band have surrendered
to the military authorities, and it is
a gratifyiug fact that when some of them had
taken refuge in the camp of the Red Cloud
Sioux, with whom they had beeu in friendly
relations, the Sioux held them as prisoners
and readily gave them up to the officers of
the United States, thus giving new proof of
the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the
contrary notwithstanding, they have uniformly
shown ever since the wishes they expressed |
at the council of September, 1877, had been ,
complied with. ,
Both the Secretary of the Interior and the :
Secretary of War unite in the recommenda- ]
tion that provision be made by Congress for <
the organization of a corps of mounted "In- I
dian auxilaries," to be under the control of i
the army, and to be used for the purpose of i
keeping the Indians on their reservations aud ]
preventing or repressing disturbances on their i
part. I earnestly concur in this recommeu- I
dation. It is believed that the organization <
of such a body of Indian cavalry, receiving a i
moderate pay from the Government, would <
considerably weaken the restless element j
among the Indians, by withdrawing from it a <
number of young men aud giving them con- <
genial employment under the Government, t
it being a matter of experience that Indians I
in our service, almost without exception, are i
faithful in the performance of the duties as- <
signed to them. Such an organization would I
materially aid the array in the accomplishment
of a task for which its numerical strength (
is sometimes found insufficient. <
But, while the employment of force for the i
prevention or repression of Indian troubles j
is of occasional necessity, and wise prepara- i
tion should be made to that end, greater reli- i
ance must be placed on humane and civiliz- ]
ing agencies for the ultimate solution of what (
is called the Indian problem. It may be c
very difficult,, and require much patient effort, r
to curb the unruly spirit of the savage Indian I
to the restraints of civilized life, but experi- 1
ence shows that it is not impossible. Many of \
the tribes which are now quiet and orderly r
and self supporting, were once as savage as 1
any that at present roara over the plains or t
in the mounains of the far west, and were c
then considered inaccessible to civilizing in- t
fluences. It may be impossible to raise them i
fully up to the level of the white population of t
the Uuited States; but we should not forget t
that they are the aborigines of the country, 1:
and called the soil their own on which our r
people have grown rich, powerful, and happy, o
We owe it to them as a moral duty to help
them in attaining at least that degree of a
civilization which they may be able to reach, s
It is not only our duty?it is also our inter- t
est to do so. Jndiaps who have become agri- I p
culturists or herdsmen, and feel an interest in c
property, wil] thenceforth cease to he a war- t
like and disturbing element, It is a^o a t
well-authenticated fact that Indians are apt b
to be peaceable and quiet when their chil- t:
ilreu are at school, and I am gratified to v
know, from the expressions of Indians them- c
selves and from many concurring reports, n
that there is a steadily increasing desire, even 1
among Indians belonging to comparatively t<
wild tribes, to have their^ children educated.
I invite attention to the reports of the Secretary
of the Interior and the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs, touching the experiment recently
inaugurated, in takiug fifty Indian
children, boys and girls, from different tribes,
to the Hampton Normal Agricultural Institute,
in Virginia, where they are to receive
an elementary English education and training
in agriculture and other useful work, to
be returned to their tribes, after the completed
course, as interpreters, instructors, and examples.
It is reported that the officer charged
with the selection of those children might
have had thousands of young Indians sent
with him had it been possible to make provision
for them. I agree with the Secretary
of the Interior in saying that "the result of
this interesting experiment, if favorable, may
be destined to become an important factor in
the advancement of civilization among the
Indians."

Jl 1IO VjUCOUULi miciiici a tiiou^o iu iud vvutrol
of the Indian service should be made,
was, at the last session of CoDgress, referred
to a committee for inquiry and report. Without
desiring to anticipate that report, I venture
to express the hope that in the decision
of so important a question, the views expressed
above may not be lost sight of, and
that the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest
further agitation of this subject, sucb
agitation being apt to produce a disturbing
effect upon the service as well as on the Indians
themselves.
In the enrolment of the bill making appropriations
for sundry civil expenses, at the last
session of Congress, that portion which provided
for the continuation of the Hot Springs
commission was omitted. As the commission
had completed the work of taking testimony
on the many conflicting claims, the suspension
of their labors, before determining the
rights of claimants, threatened, for a time, to
embarrass the interests, not only of the Government,
but also of a large number' of tbe
citizens of Hot Springs, who were waiting for
final action on their claims before beginning
contemplated improvements. In order to
prevent serious difficulties, which were apprehended,
and at the solicitation of many leading
citizens of Hot Springs, and others interested
in the welfare of the town, the Secretary
of the Interior was authorized to request
the late commissioners to take charge of tbe
records of their proceedings, and to perform
such work as could properly be done by them
under such circumstances, to facilitate the
future adjudication of tbe claims at an early
day, and to preserve the status of the claimants
until their rights should be finally determined.
Tbe late commissioners complied
with that request, and report that the testimony.
in all th6 cases, has been written out,
J , ?? '
examined, briefed, and so arranged as to facilitate
an early settlement when authorized
by law. It is recommenced that the requisite
authority be given at as early a 4*y in
the session as possible, and that a fair compensation
be allowed the late commissioners
for the expense incurred and the labor performed
by them since the 25th of June
last.
I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations
made by the Secretary of the
Interior with regard to the preservation of
the timber on the public lands of the United
States. The protection of the public property
is one of the first duties of the Government.
The Department of the Interior
should, therefore, be enabled by sufficient appropriations,
to enforce the laws in that respect.
But this matters appears still more important
as a question of public economy.
The rapid destruction of our forests is an
evil fraught with the gravest consequences,
especially in the mountainous districts, where
the rocky slopes, once denuded of their
trees, will remain so forever. There the injury
once done, cannot be repaired. I fully
concur with the Secretary of the Iuterior in
the opinion that for this reason, legislation
touching the public timber in the mountainous
States and Territories of the West, should
be especially well considered, and that existing
laws, in which the destruction of the forests
is not sufficiently guarded against, should
be speedily modified. A general law concerning
this important subject, appears to me
to be a matter of urgent public necessity.
" - n ii n i.
I1 rum ttie organization or me uoverumeui,
the importance of encouraging, by all possible
means, the increase of our agricultural
productions has been acknowledged and urged
upon the attention of Congress and the people
as to the surest and readiest means of increasing
our substantial and enduring prosperity.
The words of Washington are as applicable
to day as when, in his eighth annual message,
he said : "It is not to be doubted that, with
reference either to individual or national welfare,
agriculture is of primary importance.
In proportion as nations advance in population
and other circumstances of maturity,
this truth becomes more apparent, and renders
the cultivation of the soil more and more
nn object of public patronage. Institutions
for promoting it grow up, supported by the
public purse?and to what object can it be
dedicated with greater propriety ? Among
the means which have been employed to this
sod, none have been attended with greater
success than the establishment of boards, composed
of proper characters, charged with collecting
and diffusing information, and enabled,
by premiums and small pecuniary aids, to ensourage
and assist the spirit of discovery and
mprovement, this species of establishment
contributing doubly to the increase of improvement
by stimulating the enterprise and
experiment, and by drawing to a common
centre the results everywhere of individual
skill and observation, and spreading them
:hence over the whole nation. Experience '
iccordingly hath shown that they are very
.-heap instruments of immense national bene- 1
it." 1
The great preponderance of the agricultural
ever any other interest in the United States,
?ntitles it to all the consideration claimed for
t by Washington. About one-half of the I
copulation of the United States is engaged 1
n agriculture. The value of the agricultu- ?
al products of the United States for the year I
[878, is estimated at three thousand million '
lollars. The exports of agricultural pro- <
lucte for the year 1877, as appears from the j
eport of the Bureau of Statistics, were five i
lundred and twenty-four millions of dollars, i
rhe great extent of our country, with its di- l
rersity of soil and climate, enables us to pro- t
luce within our own borders, and by our own i
--- -_i~ .L k.,* ?e
uuur, Liui uui^y tuc ueuceaoiicd, uuo uiuow ui i
he luxuries that are consumed in civilized t
ouutries. Yet, notwithstanding our advan- a
ages of soil, climate and intercommunication, c
t appears from the statistical statements in 1
he report of the Commissioner of Agricul- t
ure, that we import, annually, from foreign c
ands, many millions of dollars1 worth of agicultural
products which could be raised in
urown country. 1
Numerous questions arise in the practice of }
dvanced agriculture which can only be an- c
wered by experiments, often costly and some- e
imes fruitless, which are beyond the means of [
>rivate individuals, and are a just and proper c
harge on the whole nation for the benefit of s
he nation. It is good policy, especially in r
imes of depression and uncertainty in other o
uisiness pursuits, with a vast area of uncul- h
ivated, and hence unproductive territory, t
nsely opened to homestead settlement, to en- s
ourage, by every proper and legitimate t
leans, the occupation and tillage uf the soil. ]
'he efforts of the Department Agriculture a
o stimulate old $nc| iptfo^wce new agricultu- f
ral industries, to improve the quality and increase
the quantity of our products, to determine
the valae of old, or establish the importance
of new methods of culture, are worthy
of your careful and favorable consideration,
and assistance by such appropriations of money
and enlargement of facilities, as may seem
to be demanded by the present favorable conditions
for the growth and rapid development
of this important interest.
The abuse of animals in transit is widely
attracting public attention. A national convention
of societies specially interested in the
subject has recently met at Baltimore, and the
facts developed, both in regard to the cruelty
to animals and the effect of such cruelties
upon the public health, would seem to de*
? ? i . f* n
mand tue caretui consideration 01 congress,
and the enactment of more efficient laws for
the prevention of these abases.
The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau
of Education shows very gratifying progress
throughout the country, in all the interests
committed to the care of this important
office. The report is especially encouraging
with respect to the extension of the advantages
of the common-school system, in sections
of the country where the general enjoyment
of the privilege of free-schools is not yet attained.
To education, more than to any other agency,
we are to look, as the resource for the advancement
of the people, in the requisite
knowledge and appreciaition of their rights
and responsibilities as citizens, and I desire to
repeat the suggestion contained in my former
message, in behalf of the enactment of appropriate
measures by Congress for the purpose
of supplementing,, with national aid, the local
systems of education in the several States.
Adequate accommodations for the great library,
which is overgrowing the capacity of
the rooms now occupied at the capitol, should
be provided without further delay. This invaluable
collection of books, manuscripts,
and illustrative art, has grown to such pronnrfinna

system of the country, as to demand the
prompt and careful attention of Congress to
save it from injury in its present crowded
and insufficient quarters. As this library is
national in its character, and must, from the
nature of the case, increase even more rapid*
ly in the- future than in the past, it cannot
be doubted that the people will sanction any
wise expenditure to preservb it and to enlarge
its usefulness.
The appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution for the means to organize, exhibit,
and make available for the public benefit,
the articles now stored away belonging to
the National Museum, I heartily recommend
to your favorable consideration.
The attention of Congress is again invited
to the condition of the river-front of the city
of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance
to the health of the residents of the
National Capital, both temporary and permanent,
that the low lands in front of the-city,
now subject to tidal overflow, should be reclaimed.
In their present condition, these
flats obstruct the drainage of the oity, and are
a dangerous source of malarial poison. The
reclamation will improve the navigation of
the river, by restricting and consequently
deepening its channel; and is also of importance,
when considered in connqption with
the extension of. the public grounds and enlargement
of the park, west and south of the
Washington monument. The report of the
board of survey, heretofore ordered by act of
Congress, on the improvement of the harbor
of Washington and Georgetown, is respectfully
commended to consideration.
_ The report of the Commissioners of the.
District of Columbia presents a detaiiea
statement of the affairs of the District.
The relative expenditures by the United
States and the District for local purposes is
contrasted, showing that the expeditures by
the people of the District greatly exceed
those of the General Government. The exhibit
is made in conection with estimates for
the requisite repair of the defective pavements
and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate
necessity, and, in the same connection,
a plan is presented for the permanent
funding of the outstanding securities of the
District.
The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions
of the District are entitled to the
favorable attention of Congress. The Reform
School needs additional buildings and
teachers. Appropriations which will place all
of these institutions in a condition to become
models of usefulness and benefice, will be regarded
by the country as liberality wisely bestowed.
The Commissioners, with evident justice, request
attention to the discrimination made
by Congress against the District in the donation
of land for the support of the public
schools, and ask that the same liberality that
has been shown to the inhabitants of the various
states and territories of .the United
States, may be extended to the District of
Columbia.
The Commissioners also invite attention to
the damage inflicted upon public and private
interests by the present location of the depots
and switching-tracks of the several railroads
entering the city, and ask for legislation look
ing to their removal. Ibe recommendations
and suggestions contained in the report will,
I trust, receive the careful consideration of
Congress.
Sufficient time has, perhaps, not elapsed
since the reorganization of the government of
the District, under the recent legislation of
Congress, for -the expression of a confident
opinion as to its successful operation ; but the
practical results already attained are so satisfactory,
that the friends of the new government
may well urge upon Congress the wisdom
of its continuance, without essential
modification, until, by actual experience, its
advantages and defects may be more fully
ascertained. R. B.' Hayes.
