'My baby's cold, says she, 'but well

And the conductor opened the door,
and plunged across the coupling ' into

It was quite a considerable city, with

a slender young girL wrapped in a

she was no more than sixteen, with

" Oh, I am not afraid," she said, with
an artless little laugh; "I shall go
straight to the seminary. n
So the express train thundered on,
with steady ceaseless pulsing at its iton
heart, and constant roar.
Suddenly the signal whistle sounded,
the train began to slacken its speed. '
- . "Surely we're not atExmouth yet,"
I thought unless I have fallen nncon-i-
. sciously asleep and allowed the progress
of time to escape me."
I glanced at my watch ; it was barely

due at Exmouth until after twelv- I

' 'Great Heavens ! what a monster I"
We had continued Jthe conversation
throughout in a whisper," scarcely above
our breath,' and now the conductor rose
and' left me to study the faces of my fel
low passengers with curious -dread and
horror. : '
Somehow; often cs I revolved the mat
ter in my mind, my fancy would settle
oa a coarse, gross-looking man ' oppo
site, with a bushy beard, and a shaggy
coat, with the eollar turned up around
his ears. I felt convinced that this man
with the heavy hanging jaw was the
Cain T and as I looked furtively across
I caught the" wide open blue orbs of the
air little girL
-Obeying the instantaeous impulse of
nrv heart, 1 arose and went over to her.
-" You heardwhat we were saying, my
child I .
"Yes a murder oh, how horrible?"
"Do not be frightened no one shall
hurt you."
She smiled np in my face with sweet
pounding innocence.
Our stay at Exmouth was very brief;
but during the delay, I could see that
the watchful detective had changed his
seat for one nearer the brutish man in
the shacrsrv coat, -
"See," faltered the young girL "they
locked the car doors at Exmouth; they
are unlocking them now.
She was right
" Probably they were fearful that the
criminal would escape," .1 remarked in
an undertone. j . J : . :
"Will you may I trouble you to
brinff me a class of water ? "
I rose and made my way toward the
ice-cooler by the door, but with difficul
ty, for the train was again under rapid
motion. To mv disappointment the
tin goblet was chained to the shelf. -
- " No matter," said she with a winning
smile, ''I will come myself.".- .
I drew the water, and held up the cup;
but instead of taking it as she approach
ed, she brushed suddenly past me, open-,
ed the door, and rushed out upon the
platform, r""5"-.'' '. "
- "Stop her! stop her!" shouted the
detective, springing to his feet; "she
will be killed ; - conductor, brakeman,
holdup!"
' There was a rush, a tumult, a bustle.
I was fust upon the platform; but it
was emotv and deserted, save by a half-
frozen looking brakeman, who seemed
horror-stricken.
- "She went past me like a shadow,
and jumped off as we crossed Cairo torn
Dike road." he stammered.
"Jumped rff the express train! Well,"
said - the - conductor, shrugging his
shoulders, "she must have been killed
instantly. What mad folly!"
"It's five hundred- dollars out of my
pocket" said the detective ruefully. "I
didnt want a row before we got to Bays
water, but I was a confounded fooL A
woman cornered will do anytning, 1 be
lieve." ' ' ; -
"What?" I ejaculated, "you surely
do not mean that child "
" I mean," Baid the detective calmlv,
that child as vou call her, is Attila
Burton, married woman of twenty-six
years of age, who last night murdered
four persons' in cold blood, and was try
ing to escape to Canada. That's what I
mean." - .- -
t The train was stopped, and a party of
us, headed by the conductor and detect
ive, went back to search for any trace of
the beautiful young creature, whose
loveliness and apparent innocence had
appealed to my sympathies. Nor was it
long before we found her, lying quite
dead by the side of the track frightfully
mangled by the force of the fall, and.
mutilated almost beyond recognition.
"WelL she's escaped justice in this
world, if not in the next," said the de
tective gloomily, as he 'stood looking
down upon hei remains.
"Do you suppose she expected to be
able to spring off the suoving train with
out injury," I asked.
"Without much injury; women are
unreasoning creatures. But I never
dreamed of such insane folly or I should
have taken prompt measures to prevent
it
They lifted np the dead fair thing,
and carried it to the nearest place of
refuge a lonely farmhouse among the
frozen hills, and we returned to the
train, reaching Bayswater only a few
minutes behind our regular time.
And when in the next morning's pa
pers I read an account of the murderess,
I thought of the slender creature's blue
eyes and rosebud mouth, with a strange
pitying thrill at my heart, - : ;
Mental Taxation a Cause of Dyspepsia.
Mental anxiety and pecuniary embar
rassmeata, such as loss of property by
fire, by failure in business, or by bad
debts, and also domestic troubles, dis
appointed affections, and the loss or
the treaahery of .friends, will frequently
cause dyspepsia ; too close, , and too
active" intellectual labor is also a fre
quent cause. .7 Editors, . authors, and
literary persons often engender dyspep
sia in this way. '
Much brain "labor requires much
blood at the brain, and an ever-working
intellect uses up so much of both blood
and nervous foroe that there is not
enough remaining to do the work of di
gestion. . ......
On the other hand, deranged di gestion
is sometimes produced by two little ex
ercise of the brain. .Persons are fre
quently met with who have beei in act
ive business life, and, having accumu
lated enough to satisfy their ambition,
have retired from business. -' Now, al
though the brains and bodies retire from
active life, yet the pool1 stomachs very
often have their tasks lncreaseo. .
' If a man has been for a long time ac
customed to eating heartily and working
hard, either with body or brain, he had
better not relax his working habits
without at the same time having a cor
responding relaxation in his habits of
eating.
. "He who will not work neither shall
he eat,11 is not only a Bible injunction,
but a law of the human constitution,
the .disobedience of which is often at
tended with such derangements of di
gestion, and other bodily infirmities, as
to render either property or life of but
little value. -Dr. Miller.

Recommendations and Suggestions THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.
Soon after the extettng war broke ont in Europe,
tbe protection of the United States Minister in Parts
was invoked in favor of the North Germans domi
eilled m French tei tKtay. Instructions were laaued
to grant the protection. This has been followed by
an extension of American protection to dttsena of
Saxony, Hesse and Bex Coourg, Gotha, Columbia,
Portugal, Uruguay, the Domtneian Bepnbbe,
Fxraador, Chili, Paraguay and Veneansla, in Paria.
Tbe charge was an ouorona one, requiring iiaauaut
and severe labor as well as the aierriss of ps henna,
prudence, and good Judgement. It baa been per
formed to the entire satisfaction of this government,
and as I am officially informed, equally so to the
satisfaction of the guwi ument of North Germany.
As soon as I learned that a Benubhe had dean pro
claimed at Paris, and that the people of France had
acquiesced in the change, the minister of tbe United
State was directed by telegraph to recognize it and
tender my ermaratnlstions and these of the people of
tbe United States. The rs-eatahllahment m France

diiasUu traditions of Fjrnipe,a)ipycdtobeariroper
subject for the felicitation of Americana. Should
tbe present straggle result in attaehrng the heal te of
the Frenoh to our sunnier forms of representative
government. It wiD he s rah)eot sf still farther satis
faction to our people. While we make no effort to
Impose our institutions upon the mbabftants of other
countries, ana wnue we sanere H oar traditional
nerrtralibv in errS tntwts rise .bete, we cannot be
mdJ&erent to the snrean or Aineriesn political ideas m
a. grant and highly cdvCuxed country tike Franca. We
are asked rv tne new guveriitneut ao use onr good
ofBora jointly with those of European noweratn the
interest of peace. Answer wsa made that the estab-
bahed poncy and true Intel eats of the United Btates
forbade them to interfere in the FiniMieaii fractions
Jointly with European powers. I aaoertsined. tn for
mally and umometaliv, that the government of North
Germany waa not then disposed to listen to anch
leuiue ulalii'iai from any powers, and though
earnestly desiring to see the bhssiag of peace
restored to tbe belbgnrents,with all of whom the
United States are on terms of friendship, I declined
on the part of thin Government to take a step which
enuld only result in tnjnrv to onr nrne interests with
out advancing the ohiert for which onr intervention
waa invoked. Should the ttme oome when the action
of the United States can hasten the return of peace
bra single hour, that action wfD be heat illy taken. I
deemed it prudent, in view of tbe number of person
of German and French birth bring in the United
States, to issue, soon after the official notice of a
war had been received from both beffigeietita. a
TToelamattoH denning the duties of the United
States as a nentral, and the obUgations of nnaisa
residing within their ten It's; to observe then- htw
and the laws of nation. The proclamation was fol
lowed by others, a circumstance seemed to eaD for
them. The people thus acqrjalnted tn advance of
their duties and obligations, have assisted tn prevent
ing violations of the neutrality of the United States.
Recommendations and Suggestions THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR. THE CUBAN REVOLUTION.
It is not understood that the oondition of the ro-
em recti si in Cuba has ttiaterially changed sines the
eloseof the last atasion of Congress. In tbe eariv
stage of Oe eontt the authorities of ftnein ineug-
ted a system of arbitrary arrests, of dose confine
ment, of military trial, and execution of dl per
aons suspected of eompheity with Insurgents and
of summary embargo of their properties and
reqnlaiijon of their revenues by eiecuUvs warrant,
Such proceeding, as far as thev affected the per
sona or property of tbe dtlxens of tbe United States,
were in violation of the rrrnrhnoas of the trestv of
ira, between the United States aad Spain. ' Bepre-
eentataans of injuries resulting to several persona
claiming to be dtisens of the United State, by rea
son of such relations, were made to the Spanish
government. From April, lM9,toJune last, the
Spanish Minister at Washington bad been dot bed
with a limited power to aid in redressing such
wronga. That power was found to be withdrawn,
la views a k was said, of the waverahlr sitnation tn
which tbe Island of Cuba then was, which, however,
did not lead to the revocation of the suspension of
the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised
by the executive power in Cuba: and we were obliged
to stake our sowtplatnt at Madrid. In the negotia
tions thus opened, and etftl pending there, the
United Btates onlr claimed that for the future the
rights seoui ed to their citizens by treaty should be
respected tn cuoa; tnat a to the past a Joint tri
bunal should be established tn the United State
with full Jurisdiction over an anch ofathria. On the
other band, Spain would be at liberty to traverse
every material fact, and thus orrm plete equity would
be done. A case which at one time threatened seri
ously to affect the relations between the United
Btates aod gnaiu has ah-eady been disposed, mini
way. Tbe claim of the Col. IyrroAanmwaD for the
Illegal seizure and detention of that vessel waa n
ferred to arbitration bv rmttnal consent and has re
sulted in s award to the United Btates for toe own
ers of the mm at nineteen thousand seven hundred
and two dollars and fifty cents in gold. Another
and long pending chum of tiks nature of the whale
ahin Canada, ha been disposed of by friendly arbi
tration daring the present year. It was ref sired by
the Joint oonsent of Brazil and tbe United Btates to
the decision of Rir Edward Thornton, Her Britarde
Majesty minister at Washington, who kindly un
dertook the laborious task of examhnhg thevohnn
mons mass of correspondence and testimony sub
mitted by tbe two governments, and awarded to tbe
United States one hundred thousand seven hundred
dollar and nine cents, which has since been paid by
the imperial goveriuueut. These recent examples
show that the mode wfcich the United Btates ban pro-
poaea to wpam tor an justing tne pending claim tn
Just aad feasible, and that it may be agreed to by
either nation witbswt dishonor. It is to be hoped
that this moderate demand may be seceded to by
opsin WTcnoui runner aejay.
Should the pending netrotiatioue unfortunately
and unexpectedly be without result, it would then
become my duty to communicate that fact to Con
gress aad await it action on the subject. - -
THE SPANISH-AMERICAN PEACE CONFERENCE.
The long deferred peace conference between Spain
and the allied South American repuhHoa, ha been
inangurated tn Washington under aba auspices of
the United States, pursuant to the recommendation
contained in the resolution of the House of Repre
sentatives of the 17th of December, IMS. The ex
ecutive department of government offered its friend
ly offices for the promotifm of peace and harmony
between Spain and the allvd Iteyablles,'- Hesita
tions ana obstacle occurred to the acorptance or the
offer. Ultimately a conference was arranged and
vat opened in this ev on the twenty ninth of Oeto
bar last, at which I ritualized tbe Secretary of State
to preside. It waa attended by ministers of, Spain,
Peru, Chili aad Ecuador. In coneesnence of the
absence of a representative of Bolivia, . the confer
ence was adVwrned until tbe attendance of a pleni
potentiary from that repnbtic could be secured, or
other measures eould be adopted towards oompaas
tngtla ohtcet.
The allied and other republics of Spanish origin
on this continent may see in this fact s new proof of
our sincere lull isal in their welfare of our desire
to see them blessed with good governxaents capable
of main tain tng order and rtreaerrtng their respective
territorial integrity, and of onr atnoere wish to ex
tend our own oomnjercial and social relations with
them. Tbe time is probably not far distant when in
the natural course of events the European political
connection with this continent will nrse. Our pol
icy should be shaped in view of this probability ao
as to ally the commercial Interests of tbe Spatilah-
Amerioaa states more closely to urn osju and tho
give the United State afl the pre-eminence and all
the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adams and
Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to Join
to the Congress of Panama. , H . .
THE RAN DOMINGO-QUESTION.
During tbe last erosion of the present Oongre a
treaty for the annexation of the Benobbc of Ban
Domingo to the United States failed to receive the
requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was thor
oughly oonvtnoed then that ths beet interests of the
oountry. commercially and materially, demanded its
ratification. - Time has only cull firmed thai view. I
now firmly beheve that the moment It i known that
the United States baa entirely abandoned tbe project
of acceptance, a a part of its lenOury, ths kdand of
Ssa Domingo, a free port will be negotiated for by
European nations.
In ths Bay of Samana a large eomrnereJal

without receiving us i repondrng benefits. The gov

Just olaim to tbe controlling tnfftienol ever the great
commercial traffic soon to now from the west to the
east by way of the Isthmus of Darien. It Is to baud
np our merchants ; It is to fnrnish new markets for
the prodrKSs of our farms, ahops and manufactories.
It is to make sjavev wjisuupurtable tn Cuba and
Porto Rico at once and ultimately so in Brazil. It is
to settle tbe unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an
sxternxinstmg conflict. It t to provide honest
means of paving onr honest debts without over-casing
the people. It is to furnish our citizens with
tbe asiotssauin of turn j Ufa at ebesnar rate than
ever before-, and it is, tn nne. a rapid stride towards
that greatness which ths hrtetligeoce, industry and
enterprise of the elllsens of the United State entitle
this country to assnme among nations.
In view of the Importance of this question, I ear
nestly urge upon Congress an early action expressive
of n view as to tbe beat means of acq uh lug Ssa
Domingo. My suggestioa la that a Joint resolution
of the two Houses of Congress and tbe Executive be
authorised to appoint a committee to negotiate for a
treaty with the atrth-s-tties of San Domingo for the
acquisition of that island : that aa aopTOpriattoo be
made to defray the capons of each commission.
The oriesUen may then be dessrralned by tbe action
of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of
annexation, as in the osee of the acquisition of Tex
as. So convinced am I of tbe advantages to flaw
from the acquisition of Ssa Domingo, and of the
great disadvantages--! might almost say calamities
of non-acquisition, that I believe the subject ha
onty to OS mvestigsxeu 10 dc approveo.

covered that tbe aonimonlr received boundary Una
between tbe United State and tbe British Posses

of the true position of the zenith parallel, and that
the line when run on what ts now supposed to be
the true position of that parallel, would leave the

the territory of the United States. This information
being casnjnuniosted to the British Government, I
was requested to consent, and I did consent, that
British occupation of the fort of the Hudson Bay
Company ahonld ooutinue for the present. I deem
it important, huweiei, that this part of the boundary

BOUNDARY LINE AT PEMBINA. THE ALABAMA CLAIMS. THE FISHING QUESTION.
The oourse rsrrsnsd by th Oanadiaa suthorities
toward the fiaherTnen of tbe United State daring
tbe past season has not been marked by a friendly
feeling. Hy tbe first srticis of the convention of
1818, between Great Britain aad the United States,
was agreed the Inhabitants of tbe United Btates
should hays ftwevsr, in atonxmon, the right of taking
fiah in certain waters therein defined. In tbe water
not Included in the limits named in eornmon, within
three miles of part of the British coast, a has been
the custom for many years to give to tatrstding fish
ermen of the United State a rvsawnable warning
of the violation of ib technical rights et Great
Britain. - -
The Imperial Government la understood to nave
delegsted th whole or a share of its Juratdictaon or
control of these In-share fishing grounds to th oolo
nial authority, known as the Dominion of Canada,
and the semi-lndrrpsndent but irresponsible agent
ha exeieistd its delegated power in an smtraondly
way. Vessels have been seixsd without notice or
waning, tn violation of custom prevailing, and have
been taken into Oanadiaa porta, their voyage bro
ken up, and the vessels oondernned. There aa reason
to beheve that this vexation and unfriendly treat
ment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy
fishermen of the United State with a view to pohtt.
cslsa7rAnpt-i thrwwrnnesat. Tr
Dominion of Canada saaiii a Mill broader and
more uritenable Jurisdiction over th. vessels of tbe
United State; they authorize officers or persons to
bring iisst ae bo-erirag arathin three msrine muea of
any of the ooast bays, creeks or harbor of Canada,
into port, to search the oargo, to rramino the inaslig
on oath tonjching the oargo and voyage, and
to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty
if true answers are not arrsun, and if anon
vesael at found preparing to fish within three marine
mile of any such eoaata, bays, creeks or harbor
without a beense, or after the expiration of tbe peri
od named tn the last license granted to it, they pro
vide that a vessel, with her tackle, fcc, kc, ahall be
forfeited. It at not known that any condemnations
oave oeen made under una statute. Bnozttuanei
thoriUea of (nada attemot to enforce tt will
oome my duty to take such step as (pay bt ut mi man
to nsvteot tbe right of the citizen of the United
BtaLes. It haa r-Mn claimed by He MavhatJW Offi
em tho fishing vessci of th tuloi Btaicr
hsvs no right to enter tbe open ports of the British
rusw visions tn North America except for purposes of
a teller, and repairing damage, and purchasing
w iod, and obtaining water ; that they have no right
to -rr at tbe British etartoan-boosea, or trade, ex
cept fw Mae i Imi of wood and wacev, aad that
they must depart within M hoars after notice to
less e. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing
vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been
raarlr nnlnrthii isslm So far as the claim is found
ed on the alleged construction of the convention of
1X18. it oonnot be acquiesced tn by the United States.
It fat hoped that a will not be Insisted oa by Her
Majesty' Government. During the conference which
preceded the negotlatioiai of tha Convention of 1818,
the British Commissioner proposed to expressly ex
clude tbe fishermen of the United State from tha
privilege of carrying on trade with any of His Brit
ianie Majesty's subjects residing within the limits
assigned for their nee; and also that it ahonld sot be
twini Its- tne vessels of tne united states engsgea m
such fishery to have on board any goods, wares or
saerchau ulaevshatever, xoept such aa may be oecea-
sarrfortbe Lsoseeiiuonol thatr voyages to ann rrom
tsaid fishing ground; and any vassal of the United
Btates wntcn snail contravene uu regulation may ns
eized, condemned and confiscated, with her cargo.
This proposition, which is identical with the eoo
U action now put upon the language of the Conven
tion, was emphatically objected to by the American
Ocmmiasioner, and thereupon waa abandoned by ths
Britlab plenipotentiaries, and Artless j, a a atanoa
in the Convention was substituted.
I', however. It b said that this claim la founded
rpon provincial or eolonial statutes, aod not upon
the convention, this Government cannot but iwgard
Ltbem as am friendly, and in contravention of lb
spttlt. If sot of th letter, of ths treaty for tha
faithful execution of which the Imperial Govern

attempt may possibly be made by tha Canadian as
thorities in theeoming season to repeat their un
neUthboriy a -t toward onr fishermen. I recommend
Joe to oonferupoa tbe Kxeoutlve the power to sus

THE NAVIGATION OF THE ST. LAWRENCE.
A like anfriendly disposition has beso manifested
o the part of Oanada ta ths mairrtenaoce of a claim
of the right to exclad cltiaen of the United btates
from navigattoa of tha St. Lswrsoos. Thai river
constitute a natural outlet to th ocean for eight
States, 1th an aggregste population of 17,600.000

ton, upon the waters which discharge into it- Th
lorelgn ro-nmeroe cr tbe ports on Iheae waters la
open to Britten com petition, and tbe major part of
it la dona in britlab bottom. If tho American

tha ocean, the nxonofoly of the direct onsntnerce of
th lake port with tbe Atlantic would be in foreign
hands, their vess'li on trans-AU -ntlo voyage
having access to onr lake porta which sroold be
denied to American vessel on similar voyages. To

During th administration of Mr. John Quiner
Adams, Mr. Clav noqueationably demonstrated the
est' ral right of citizen of tbe united Btatee to

Congress of Vienna, tn opening the Run and other
rivers to all ostein, showed the Judgment of
European Jurist and statesmen that the inhabitant
of a oountry mrangn wrden a navigable nrer passes
bars a natural right to enjoy th navigation of that
river to aod ml tha see, though naming through
tents i of another power. This right does
not exclude tha coequal right of the aovarslgua

Marriage a La Mode.
The New York eorrespondent of the
Trov Times writes:
- The modern'' style of marriage is as
fruitful a source of splendid misery as
can be irngiTiiTrie STtast Hogarth
made a great hit bv illustrating tne mar
riage a la mode of this day, and were he
now alive he might find an equally rich
subject in the high life of riew xork.
knew an instanoe of a splendid marriage
j i - i . i, ?i -a j- l
in which, among osoer i tenia oi uibjjibj,
a half-dosen groomsmen and bndetv
maids were put in aervioe. The wed
ded pair sailed for Europe, and while en
joying the luxury of its gayest capital,
the husband detected his wife correspond
ing with her music teacher, a fine look
ing uerman by wnom sne nad Deen
captivated. He immediatelT notified
the parents to send for their daughter,
whom he at once abandoned. Within
six months from her wedding the bride
was back in her father's house. That
trifling ingredient in matrimony called
love is overlooked when the gratifieav
tion of social ambition is at hand, but
the bride will yet find the true master
of her heart, and, as in Hogarth's fa
mous series to which I referred, an in-
triirue will be the result. In the mean
time, while she shares the grandeur of a
splendid establishment, she feels that
bitterness of disappointment wnicn
giw life to a tiaaon. Among the more
noted of these marriages a la mode is
that of a public man. of considerable
notoriety, who was at that time
widower of fifty, with a bad rep
utation both in asocial and political mat
ters. However, he waa reputed to be
rich, and wealth, like charity, overs a
multitude of sins. He offered Itimself
to a young lady, who had reached the
npe age of sixteen, and hence migct be
expected to know her price. This wasa
house in the Fifth avenue, worth $100,
000, to be conveyed before the perform
ance of that fremorey which was to
unite the affectionate couple. The deed
was executed, but it is mors than whis
pered that just one day prior ts this the
premises were confidentially mortgaged
for $95,000. The bride, under these
ciioninrstances, might draw consolation
from the fact that her honorable and
honored husband shaved everybody that
came in contact with him, and nence
such a pieoe of sharp practice might
reasonably be expected.
I presume that the young lady refer
red to took pattern by another marriage
a la mode, which occurred several years
previousulv, and excited a great deal of
remark. This took place between a
oistinguished financier and the daughter
of an eminent naval officer. It is said
that in this instanoe the consideration
s not only a deed of a Fifth avenue
mansion, but $100,000 invaluable stocks.
This match, as I have said, counted
great notioe, and. even eenrmre,
owing to the husband's an
tecedents. As the season advances
the matrimonial market is excited, and
several important bargains are now
under way. Mention is made of an al
liance near at hand, between a four
story brown stone house, with carriage
and servants, and a fortune on top of it
of $250,000, on the one hand (encumber
ed by 200 pounds of flesh and blood,
with the bloated wynntenance of a rakish
widower,) and on the other a chignon
and trousseau, a smattering of Jfrencn,
and lore of the world, the flesh and the
devil, all done up in the ptainted form of
a fashionable young lady.
Mb. Johx Fbaskb. familiarly called
by Inverneetsiana "The Black Sodger,"
is dead. He came of a rare old fighting
race of Highlanders, and was no un
worthy descendant, louring snocesnve
generations his ancestors had fought at
Killiecrankie, SheriSmuir, Preetonpans,
Culloden and Quebec, and John himself
aoeompanied the Gordon Highlanders
through all the Peninsular war and sub
sequent campaigns, from 1808 to Quatre
Bras, while one of his sons took part in
the Crimean war and in the Indian mu-;
tiny with the 72d Highlanders. His
father obtained a commission in consid
eration of his gallantry at Quebec, and
four brothers, who also received com
misfflons, died ia evotion.

literary journal published m New York
about fifty years ago, and edited by
James G. Brooks, contained a tale
written by Mrs. Helen Mana Wiluams,
entitled "Perorou, or the Bellows
mender of Lyons." - This tale rjeming
to the notioe of Bnlwer was draitiatised
by him, the prominent points, ehartaf.
ters and scenes being retained. Bnl
wer, however, in the first
printed edition of the play ad
mits his oblirration to "The Bellows-
mender of Lyons, but does not mention
tha name of the authoress. Helen
Maria Williams was an F.nglinxi author
ess, who was born in the north of Eng
land in 1762, and who died in Paris in
1827. - She went to London at the age
of 18, and during the ensuiag ten years
published several tales and poems,
which excited great attention. In 1790
she settled in Paris, and wrote two vol
nmes of letters on the state of France.
These letters defended tbe Girondists,
and on their downfall she was for soma
time imprisoned, and her life was seri
ously in danger. She subsequently
wrote books of travels, hirrtorical nar
ratives, and novels and tales. ' Bnlwer
wrote "The Lady of Lyons" about tha
