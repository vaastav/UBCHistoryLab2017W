The President's Message—Mosby to
Have His Pees—Places Wanted
by Chilians.
(SPECIAL DISPATCHES TO Tag BECORD-UTOON. |
,
CONGRESSIONAL PBOCF.EDINO3.
In the Senate.
Washington, liecember ML—-It was an un
usually lull Senate that responded to President
pro-tern, Ingalls'call^to order at 1J o clock to
day.
At that time all the galleries were full except
the President's aud the Diplomatic Department.
As the minute hand had overtaken the hour in
dicator ou the dial of the clock facing him, lu
galls let fall the gavel Chaplain Butier
opened the proceedings with prayer.
A few moments were spent in greeting the
Senators, and then Senator Sherman oflem! the
usual icsoliition that the Secretary notify the
House that the Senate is ready to proceed to
businc-- ,
The resolution was adopted and a committee
appointed to notify the President that the Senate
is ready to receive any communication he may
have to make. HeMTB. Morrell and Sauisl.ury
comprised the committee.
At 12:47 the Senate tojk a recess until half
past 1 o'clock.
At the conclusion of recess, the usual message
Irani [hi- llnuse announcing the (act ot its b»iug
in m'-muli and having appointed a Committee to
wait upon the President, was delivered, it hav
ing beeu deleyed iv consequence of the recess.
'I his was followed by a report lrom the com
mittee in wait on the President, to the effect
that it Inn! performed that duty aud that the
President would communicate In writing im
mediateiy. Then the President's message was
delivered by Prnden, ODe of hi- Becr< taries, and
UcCook, Secretary of the Senate, proceeded to
read v.
The rending of the message occupied one
hour ami twenty minutes. The portiotu which
dtectmed the questions of the tariff revision.
the treasury surplus, the fishery troubles aud
the West incident were listened t<> with very
close attention anil apparent interest by lonx
teen Republican senators aud about an equal
uumlier of Democrats. The other iiortious of
the message seemed not to have many listeners.
and the reading had the effect of" gradually
clearing the gallery ot the numerous spectators.
When the reading was finished, the message.
on motion 'if Hoar, was laid ou the table and
ordered printed.
Hoar said he was about to move adjournment,
but thought that if it be convenient it would be
desirable for the Senate to letfrn from gentle
men having various measures iv charge what is
to be the order of business for to-morrow.
The presiding officer, Imialls, said '-he unfin
ished business was the bill to reduce taxation
(the tariff).
Hoar—" At what hour will that bill be in or
der to-morrow '"
Presiding officer—" Two o'clock."
Prye—" I give notice that I snail call up for
consideration (with theconsent of the Senate)
the bill for the settlement with the Union Pa
cific Railroad Company, to morrow morning,
immediately after the routine business of the
morniui; is completed."
In the House.
Wa.<hini:tos, December ::d.—Long before the
hour for the meeting oi the second session of the
Fiftieth Congress the public galleries were filled
with spectators.
On the floor hand-shaking was indulged iv
and congratulations on re-election or condol
ences on defeat exchanged among the members.
Jocose raillery on the part of Republicans, pa
tient resignation on the part of the Democrats
was everywhere evident.
At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of the gavel
stilled the tumult which existed in the nail,
and silenced reigned while the Chaplain offered
prayer.
The roll of the members was then called, and
the hum of conversation broke out afresh. Dur
ing the progress of the call of members Presi
dent Cleveland entered the Executive gallery
and bt'eame an attentive spectator.
On motion of Mills oi Texas, a resolution was
adopted directing the Clerk to inform the Si B
ate that a quorum of the Uouse was ready to
proceed to business. In accordance with the
resolution the Speaker appointed a committee
to joiu a similar committee appointed by the
Senate to wait upon the President and iuform
him that Congress was ready To receive any
communication he might desire to trausmit to
the House, then, at 1.'.T0. took a recess for an
hour.
After recess Holman announced that the com
mittee appointed to wail upon the President
performed that duty, and that the President
would communicate with Congress forthwith.
Pruden. one of the President's Secretaries,
then announced the annual message, a Inch was
delivered to the House immediately, and read
by the Clerk.
Thai portion of the message in which the
President treats of the tariff question was
listened to attentively by the members of both
sides of the House. Now and then a smile, more
of triumph then of derision, would appear upon
the face of some enthusiastic Republicans, but
the silence was not broken until the Clerk read
in a clear voice that " the cause for which the
battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly
and distinctly defined. It should never be com
promised. It is the people's cause." Then the
fiemocrats could no longer restrain their feel
ings, and broke into a round ot applause which
was answered by the Republicans with derisive
laughter.
From this point interest in the message slack
ened. Mills was the only member who paid
the slightest attention to the further reading,
and Ihe noise of the conversation was so great
that it was no easy task.
When, at 3k 16, the reading was completed,
Mills offered a resolution, which was agreed to,
referring the message to the Committee on the
Whole, providing for its printing.
Adjourned. •
Tlli; lUOKMON CASE.
An Early Consideration .Asked or the
Federal Btipreine Court.
Washington, December Sil.—ln the Supreme
Court today Hon. F. S. Ruhards of Salt Lake
made a motion for the advancement of the case
of the United States vs. the Mormon Church for
the forfeiture and eschcatment of the Church
property to the Government, on appeal from a
decree from the Supreme Covirt of Utah. Alter
stating the claims of the Government and of
uppellauis, the following reasons were given
for the advancement of the case, viz.: That
it is a cause in which the United States
is a party ; that it involves the
ronstituiniuality of certain Acts ot Congress
that it atltcts unt only the people of Utah, but
the rights of church corporators of every de
nomination in the Territories, and is therefore
a question of public interest: that a large
amount or church property has been seized and
is now held by a receiver. Much of it Li of a
perishable nature and thus liable to irreparable
loss and damage if left till the case can come
up in its order. The great expenses and
delay will amount to a virtual confiscation
of said property ; that nearly half a million
dollars of personal property has been seized,
when there is no law nor semblance of law for
seizure of personal properly : that part ot the
real estate so seized has been held by the
Church for over twenty-five years, and before
the Act of ltfiJ wa." piis*e.l limiting the amount
of real estate to be hi-ld by ihnrch corporations,
anil that another part hud been held as a
parsonage and is exempted in the terms of the
law.
For these and other reasons appellants ask an
early hearing of the case. Counsel for the
Government offered no objection, and the Court
took the matter under advisement.
WORK AHEAD.
Uncertainty as to What Buatneu Congreiw j
Will First Take Up.
Washington. December ?A.— Before the
Senate adjourned to-day notification was made
by Frye that he would call up the I'nion Paci
fic settlement bill to-morrow; by Chandler, that
he would ask for action on his resolution to in
vestigate the Louisi-ina election of April last,
and by Allison that he would ask to proceed
with the tariff bill, and would even (if the dis
cussion was too protracted), call it up during
the morning hourd ol the session.
It is very uncertain what business the House
will oegin work on. There were many contin
uing special orders tor dates already past, and a
number of measures against which the point oT
■o quoruu was raised. Out of this hutch-potch
the House may pick out almost any thine they
want to consider, bat the chances are that, as
between the various important measures, the
time will be taken up in disputing which shall
have precedence, until the direct tax question
comes up on Thursday. Some unanimous con
sent morning-hour business may be done in the
meantime.
MOSBY'S FEES.
The Ex-Cblnesa Consul flets Jndgmeat
for 513.839.
WISKNOKM, December 3d.— The Conrt o f
Claims to-day cave judgment for J13.539, in
favor of Colonel John S. Mosby. late United
States Consul-Genera) to China. This represents
tees for certificates to Chinese immigrants to
the Initeil States, etc., collected in an official
capacity, and tor which accounting the officers
of the Treasury refused to allow him credit. . !
The facts in the case are about as follows ' j
General Mosby, while Consul-General at Hong
kong from February. i»79, till July. 188). coi- ;
lected for service fee' aggregating $ B,9>Si. which I
he believed belonged to him as perquisites of
the office. The State Department decided ad !
versely and he, In order to avoid a controversy
with superior officers, turned the money into the
Treasury. On retiring from the position in ISSS
he demanded a return of the money, but the
Treasury officials declined, although admitting
that at least a portion of the fees belonged to
him. Comptroller Durham refused to allow
Mosby credit for the fees, on the ground that he
had voluntarily paid his own money into the
Treasury. Mosby then brought suit agaiust the
Government in the Court of Claims. Last winter
he went to Washington aud argued bis own case
before the Court. The Couit holds that Utineral
Mosby was entitled lothat portion of the amount
collected.
PBKSS OPINIONS.
What Leading Journals Think of Cleve
land's Last Message.
New York, December :id.— The Pott editori
ally says: The Present's message of last De
cember gave the countn- a surprise by its bold
ness, and the present wi.i do hardly less.
The Commercial Advertiser (Independent), says
editorially: The message Is a notable state pa
per, and will jirodtably direct popular thought.
Ihe Mad and Ejrpms editorially says: Most
Americans will be «lad as they read this mes
sage that it is. probably the last one which will
emanate from the present Chief Magistrate.
An editorial in the Evening .-«« i L'em.) says:
Toe second session of the Finieth Congress uit-t
at noon to explain how it got bounced by the
American people. The prisoner at the bar said
that American justice was more honest than elo
quent, liod has given you v new Constitution
aud sen>e, instead of which yon go about the
country stealing ducks. Alas, "for any Congress
that has a good caance and wastes it, Mealiug '
ducks, or chasing rainbows, or conducting au
educational campaign.
The Sun continues. In the- most sarcastic man
ner, to ridicule Cleveland and his message.
Three sentences are: '• I am right, and the
country is wrong. Truth is mighty, aud will
prevail. There may be some delay, but the
rainbow still arches the Weitern sky.""
TheiVeosay: •The message is a unique, and,
let us hope, a comparatively harmless illuttra
tion ol the length In which a shallow dema
gogue w ill go in order to incite and imLjiUer one
class of American citizens agaiust auother.
That portion ot the menage devoted to the i
tanrt issue shows how acutely the President
feels his defeat, and at the same time demon
stratet his utier incapacity to deal with this
• lUestiouin a calm, dispassionate aud statesman
like munuer.''
The Tribune editorially says that President
Cleveland's message is the marl ot a beaten I
candidate. In a document which should be a
dignified State paper he h.is taken the pains to
exhibit the sorentss ol a discarded politician,
because the policy which he !md toreed upon
his party was deleated by the people.
BOSTON PUB KZPJtISBtOia.
Bostdh, December Ith.—Regarding the Presi
dent's me—age, tbe Journal says this morning
-11 We grieve to say that the President of the
I'nited Stales, of whom, by reason of his high
office, it would be pleasant to s|>eak with re
spect, has tinctured the earlier portion of his
message with a demagogitm which is unworthy
the Cuief Executive of this great people, and
which—so far as it is accepted by foreigners a 9
a ftatemcut—is untrue aud libelous."
The Berald says ; " The message, in its consid
eration ol controverted questions, has in it
qualities of that frankness and courage which
have distinguished President Cleveland'» entire
public life, aud it will be found to be through
out a statesman > ike as well as patriotic docu
ment."
THE OHIO COSTINGKST.
SlcKinley Wants the Speakership. and
Sbenuitn a Cabinet Position.
WA-iiisiiTos, December 3d.— The question of
Mr. McKinleys candidacy for the Bpeakenhlp
of the next Congress is settled. He has told his
friends fiat he is iv the race, and that he con
siders the honor one of tbe greatest in politics.
The general Ohio situation is greatly mixed.
Sherman, it is said, would like to go into the
Cabinet, and can do so, but the present I.ejfisla- I
ture would elect his successor, aiid it is believed !
that Foraker has it fixed for himself. This Mr.
Sherman could not tolerate, and they are trying
to plan some way to insure the defeat ot Foraker
and the election of Buttcrworth Sherman's
going into the Cabinet is said to depend on the
success of this plan.

Important Changes Kecom mended by
the Convention of OtHcerg.
Pas Francisco, December oil—At the fifth
annual Convention of the officers of the National
Board tliis evening, four of the six brigades
being represented, it was decided to recommend
lo the Legislature an increase in the force from
60 to 00 companies, the maximum strength of
each from la> to hO, aud the minimum from CO
to 50.
The plan to increase the term of all line
ortkers from two to four years was rejected.
Provision "was made l<ir the issuance by the
State ol medals i^r ten, Bfteen nud twenty yean 1
active service, and that the stale pay a'lull per
diem and aliowauces for encampments.
It was decided, a< the sense of the Convention.
that all the ii-i^inicntal and signal corps in
the Brigade be consolidated in a Brigade
organization, and that Ihe number of
Brigadiers be reduced from six to three, per
mitting of a Briira'ie in the Northern. Central
and Southern portions of the State.
This proposition whs stubbornly contested by
delegates from the northern purl ol the Btate,
save General Bneehan, of Sacramento, who
warmly espoused the movement.
The officers from Southern California favored
the plan, and it was adopted, recommending
only three brigades hereafter.

I-onaford tried to quiet him, but his efforts were
Ineffectual.
Hayes turned on Longford and called him

several blows In the lace. At this Juncture Jim
Douglass pulled Longford away. Then a shot
was fired, ami Hayes fell to the floor with a
wound in his eye.
All the parlies in the sa:oon were taken to

ried there, but di< don the way. AH the parties
were interrogated separately." and each told a
different star; about the "trouble, and none
would admit that he saw the shooting. They
agreed only ou one point—that they saw Hayes
fall.
The police concluded, from all the statements,
that the fatal slio-. was tired by John Longford,
a brother of the Sergeant, who was present at
the time ol the trouble. The Sergeant, his

Swallows Take to a Ship.
A rather curious episode in natural his
tory occurred the other day on board the
French steamboat Abd-el-Kader during
the passage from Marseilles to Algiers.
Just as the vessel was rbotit two hours out
the sky became quite black with swallows.
It was then about ti o'clock in the evening.
The birds alighted in thousands on the
sails, ropes and yards of the Abd-el-Kader.
After a perky survey of the deck from their
eminences aloft they descended coolly on
deck, hopped about among the sailors and
passengers, and eventually found their way
into the cabins both fore and aft. The
birds were evidently fatigued', after a long
flight, and allowed themselves to be caught
by the people of the ship, who gave them
a welcome reception and provided them
with food, which they enjoyed heartily.
The little winged strangers "remained all
night on the vessel, and in the umrning at
7 o'clock the head lookout bird no doubt
sighted the Balearic Isles, for the whole
flock made for land, after having spent a
comfortable and refreshing night on board
ship.
Human Ashes for Parlor Ornaments.
An unknown eenina ha? suggested that
the best way of disposing of the bodies of
deceased friends and relatives is to cremate
them and mix the ashes with some chem
ical preparation that he has invented,
which would make them acquire the con
sistency of clay. This clay could be :nade
into statues, which, he "believes, would
make becoming ornaments fur the mantel
pieces of the relatives of the deceased. A
penon .djriog mifebl leave iontructiom in
his will as to what kind of a st:ttue he
would prefer to assume. The sporting
man could meet death calmly with the
thought that in a few days he would figure
as the mighty John L. himself above the
bar of his favorite retreat, while an ugly
girl might be translated intn a Vena, and
so on indefinitely. The scheme will fill
the world with statues if adopted, and the
inventor ought to reap a rich liaivest from
his idea.
