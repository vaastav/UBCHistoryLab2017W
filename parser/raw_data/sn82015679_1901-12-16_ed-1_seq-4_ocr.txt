There Is reason to believe that Congress
will break tho precedent by passing a bill
before the holidays thanks to the Reed
rules In the House.
To-day the United States Senat will
meet at 11 o'clock and remain in session
until a vote on the Hay-Pauncefote treaty
is taken. There U no doubt as to Its rat
ification by a decided majority.
The new Philippine tariff is denounced by
Democrats as another step on the road to
Imperialism. A few years ago the "money
power" and "geidbug" were the favorite
Democratic epithets. As a fine-sounding
word "imperialism" Is an improvement.
The head of a policy-shop "trust" has
teen arrested in New York whose profits
for a part of last year were v),000. The
Brooklyn Eagle, in commenting upon the
arrest, stigmatizes the policy shop as the
most detestable and injurious form of
gambling because "it takes pennies from
' the poor, the ignorant, and children."
Senator Mason, of Illinois, is the object of
considerable criticism because of the use of
his frank to circulate an advertisement of
a champagne company whose product he
extolled in his report on pure foods. It is
not claimed that the senator has received
any compensation for this valuable service,
but that lie has been used by sharp people.
Tho Atlanta Journal calls attention to
en organization of colored men in Missis
Ippi for the purpose of urging its mem
bers to suppress the lynching evil by ed
ucating the negro above the crimo of
criminal assault. In the same connection
it remarks that here is a chance for North
ern "reformers' to do something practi
cal by encouraging this organization.
Could not some white leader in the South
emphasize the enormity of the offense by
making such assaults a crime when com
mitted by white men?
The Springfield Republican, a paper that
carries about with It an air of conscious
wisdom, Fays of Mr. Ferguson, the re
cently appointed (Governor of Oklahoma,
that he Is classed as a Democrat, and
"has no knowledge of Oklahoma, having
mide his home in "Washington for years."
Inasmuch as Mr. Ferguson has been chair
man cf the Republican territorial commit
tee and managed two Republican cam
paigns in the Territory, besides being well
known there as a man of affairs, it would
appear that the Republican had somehow
skipped a stitch.
President Gomncrs, of the Federation of
Labor, has been unanimously re-elected, In
rite of the threats made by the socialistic
element to defeat him. Even the charge of
President Shaffer that Mr. Gompers be
trayed the cause of the Amalgamated steel
workers In refusing to sustain the Shaffer
rtrtke did -not count against Mr. Gompers.
Among the vice presidents Is John Mitchell,
cf this city, who has rendered the coal
miners most useful service. It seems that
the socialistic element was weaker in this
last congress of the Federation than it
has been in previous years.
A part of tho people of Missouri are
having fun over the performance of Mr.
Cardwell, of Kansas City, a Democratic
member of the Legislature. Mr. Card well
made a speech declaring that the members
cf the Democratic state committee and
ether leaders fold legislation to corpora
tions. One of tho former, in the St. Louis
Republic, declared that Cardwell's story
was false, whereupon Cardwell sued the
Republic for libel. Since then Cardwell has
withdrawn his suit for the sum of $7,r.e0,
alleged to have been raid by the men
who are accused by him of selling legis
lation. Members cf a New York woman's club
conceived the i lea a few days ago of send
ing the Queen of Holland an expression
of sympathj' upon her domestic infelicities.
A resolution to that effect was introduced
nr.d received considerable support, but was
finally voted down on the reasonable
rround that her little Majesty's family
affairs were none of the club's business.
If Hollanders had taken the same judicious
course, an-1 refrained from meddling it
-em probable that poor Wilhelmina
wuld have had no domestic miseries. At
least i-h'j would have had tho sad satis
faction of k ping them to herself.
The Democratic Chicago Chronicle is
laborl:.;r to induce the party to take a
sensibly position in regard to the Phll
!p;Ir.s. It d.-elaris that the Interpretation
of the Kar.sas City platform that the
inlands tdionld be abandoned "is political
Imbecility and a betrayal cf country and
cf party, and an outrage upon common
sense." Thj question whether the islands
are to be American territory "was settled
cr ail time." says the Chronicle, "by
the votes of Democrats as well as Repub
licans when the treaty of Paris was rat
ified. It might have added that after the
Rryan party had made the question of
the retention of the Islands a leading is
sue in 1 it was beaten more decisively
than It wa3 on the silver issue four years
earlier. The issue which the Chronicle
would have Its party make is that the
Islands shall be governed as a part of the
United States and not after the British
colonial policy. That is, instead of carry
ing, out the present policy of governing
the islands by a commission which shall
make the necessary laws subject to the
approval of the United States, and enforce
them until the natives are in some sense
f.tted for self-government, the Chronicle
would set them to governing themselves
as territories and extend to the people of
the islands all the laws of the United
States which are applicable to territories
in that hemisphere. Many will fail to
grasp the point which the Chronicle is
making. We have had Alaska thirty years
and have ruled It rather as a colony than
as a territory. Its people have no voice
in their own government. They do not
hold elections, and except that there are
no special provisions relating to tariffs
such as is proposed in reference to the
Philippines, it has been ruled very much
as If It were a colony.

A dispatch from Kingston, Jamaica, dis
closes a curious situation, with a possibil
ity of new complications springing out of
that perpetual source, of trouble, Central
America. The: dispatch says that three
delegates from the Mosquito territory have
arrived at Kingston, and are negotiating
with the British government for relief from
Nicaraguan rule. "They have sent a signed
letter to the newspapers," says the dis
patch, "setting forth their refusal to be
lieve that Great Britain is abandoning the
Managua treaty, and declaring that the
Mosquito Indians are prepared to fight
rather than accept tho continuation of Nic
araguan control." The Mosquito territory
was the source of all our trouble growing
out of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, which,
after an embarrassment of nearly half a
century, we are just getting rid of. The
Mosquito Indians are of little more ac
count than the Insect of the same name,
and their mission seems to hi equally to
cause trouble. It was because of the Brit
ish claim to exercise a protectorate over
the Mosquito Indians and their territory.
Including Greytown; the proposed starting
point of a ship canal across the isthmus,
that the United States entered Into tho
Clayton-Bulwer treaty. Under cover of
this claim Great Britain, in ISIS, seized the
port of San Juan and made an attempt to
extend the protectorate over all the adja
cent coast. This led to friction with tho
united States and eventually to the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, by which Great Britain
agreed not to exercise any "dominion"
over the Mosquito coast, though she still
continued to exercise a quasl-protectorate.
In 1SC0 Great Britain entered into a treaty
with Nicaragua, the treaty of Managua,
which provided that the Mosquito Indians
should have their country as a permanent
reserve and the right of self-government,
but should be required to acknowledge al
legiance to Nicaragua, They were per
mitted to have a flag of their own, which
must bear some emblem denoting thiir sub
mission to Nicaragua, By this treaty Great
Britain remanded all claims to a protec
torate over the Mosquito Indians and their
country in favor of Nicaragua. In 1S01,
during a disturbance at Bluefields, a Brit
ish warship landed troops there to restore
order, and to a request from the United
States for Information regarding the trans
action tho British government replied that
"no protectorate over the Mosquito Indians,
in substance or in form, is desired or in
tended by the British government." The
Bluefields Incident dragged along for some
time, and ended by the Mosquito Indians
formally recognizing the sovereignty of
Nicaragua.
This recapitulation throws some light on
the present mission of the Mosquito dele
gates to Kingston. They evidently repre
sent a movement to repudiate the sover
eignty of Nicaragua, and arc trying to get
British encouragement to engage in a rev
olution. Fifty years ago Great Britain
would have promptly accepted an invita
tion to take a hand in that kind of an In
ternational "scrap" in Central America,
but times have changed since then. It is
not unlikely, however, that if the Mos
quito Indians carry out their threat of re
belling against Nicaraguan control Great
Britain may land troops there again to
"restore tranquillity," and the Bluefields
incident and diplomatic correspondence
will be repeated. "Our neighbors to the
south of us," as Secretary Hay called them
recently, are a bad lot.
A TWENTIETH CKXTTIIY WOXDKH,
Tho announcement is made on the au
thority of Signor Marconi, the inventor of
wireless telegraphy, that he ha3 succeeded
in sending electric signals from a station In
England to a station on this continent, a
distance of 1.TÖ0 miles, without a wire. The
dispatch making the announcement charac
terizes the achievement as "the most won
derful scientific discovery of modern
times." If not the most wonderful of such
discoveries, it certainly belongs In that
class. Whether it will be developed Into a
practical utility remains to bo seen, but the
mere demonstration of the fact that an
electric signal can bo sent across the ocean
without a wire is in itself of great scientific
interest. And, considering the progress
wireless telegraphy has made since the first
discovery of tho principle, it would not be
safe to question its future development. It
has not been four years since the first an
nouncement of Marconi's discovery. On
the CSth Of March, lSltf, he sent a message
of over one hundred words across the Brit
ish channel, a distance of thirty-two miles.
In an address at the Royal Institute, Bon
don. Feb. 2, i:A, Marconi stated that during
naval maneuvers he had discovered that
messages could be sent from one ship to
another sixty miles distant. Since then he
has been experimenting with progressive
results until now he has succeeded in send
ing distinct signals across the Atlantic. In
the light of past experience it is not dif
ficult to believe that tho time will come
when wireless telegraphy will come Into
general use. The principle is not new, and
Marconi Is really not Its discoverer. Ills
credit lies In having developed It along
original lines. In Professor Henry, an
American scientist, tran.-rnitted signals
from imc room to another, a distance of
eighteen feet, without a wire, and in 1M2
Samuel F. B. Morse, Inventor of the elec-
! trie telegraph, sent a message without
j wins eighty feet ucross the Potomac at
Washington. Other scientists in this and
other countries have demonstrated the prin
ciple, but none has carried the demonstra
tion to anything like the success that Mar
coni has. The possibility of long-distance
telegraphing without wires being demon
strated, there will remain the problem cf
reducing the cost of the plant to figures
that will give the discovery commercial
value.
In this connection it will probably sur
prise most persons to learn that the electric
current used in ordinary telegraphing does
not pass through the wire, but, as It were,
over or around it. The annual report of
the Smithsonian Institution for 1?X con
tains a paper by Prof. Elihu Thomson, on
"Electricity During the Nineteenth Cen
tury," In which the writer says:
Just h..-re we may refer tc the fact for It
Is a fact that the electrical energy trans
mitted over a line, which may be many
miles in length, really does not travel by
the wire connecting the two points. It
travels in the ether surrounding the wire.
The wire itself is, in fact, the guiding core
of the disturbances in the ether which pro
ceed outward in all directions to unlimited
distances. The guiding core or conducting
wire is needed to focalize or direct the de
livery of the energy. This curious conclu
sion of science that the power from the
power-station wire travels in the space
around the wires led from the station is
one of the results of recent electrical
strides. The wireless telegraphy of
to-day utilizes a sudden electrical disturb
ance made at one point, which travels by
the surrounding ether in all directions and
:s picked up in feeble fashion, it may well
be, by very sensitive receiving instruments.
The shock or disturbance to the ether is
thus recognized, and by a preconcerted sys
tem of signals tho s'ight disturbances are
sent out in a sequence such as to convey
Intelligible messages. Distances of upward
of one hundred miles are thus covered with
what must be regarded as an extremely
feeble means so far as the scale of the ap
paratus is concerned, and there would seem
to be no reason why the scale of operations
greatly Increased may not, in the near fu
ture, widely expand the range over which
wireless telegraphy can work.
This explanation really magnifies Mar
coni's achievement in sending signals
across the Atlantic by showing that he Is
able to "pick up" and localize an ethereal
disturbance which pervades the whole at
mosphere and perhaps universal space.
XOTIIIXG TO INVESTIGATE.
The furor which has been raised In Wash
ington for an investigation based upon the
decision of the "majority of the Schley
court of inquiry" is due not so much to a
regard for the reputation of Admiral Schley
as to make political capital for the Demo
cratic managers. Public opinion as ex
rresed by tho press is favorable to Admiral
Schley. The court was of his own calling,
and he is reported to be satisfied with the
finding. There is no testimony bearing
upon the mater which a Senate or House
committee could bring to light that has not
been given to the public. Any finding which
such a committee could make would not
change public opinion in the least. Thus
far no charge has been made against the
administration of the Navy Department,
since no scandal or rumor of a scandal is
attached to it. It has been said that the
executive departments of the navy are con
trolled by an official clique which is hostile
to Admiral Schley. This is mere assump
tion, and it will be recalled that no evi
dence was presented to establish such a
charge. If there is ground to believe that
such is the case, let the investigation be
directed against the bureaus, to the end
that remedial legislation may be considered;
but there is no propriety In making Admiral
Schley a party to such investigation unless
he should be called as a witness.
The only purpose of an investigation 's
political, ns those who urge the investiga
tion have no fear that injustice has or will
be done Admiral Schley. They hope to find
something which can be used to help the
Democratic party out of the almost hope
less position into which its leaders have
plunged it. Knowing that nothing can harm
them, they have nothing to lose by an in
vestigation, and may gain a point. At lenst,
an investigation would draw attention from
their hopeless situation. In Congress, par
ticularly the House, the opposition has
no policy except to be against the Re
publicans. In that position they are wait
ing for something to turn up. Any kind of
investigation would be a diversion. Doubt
less the majority in Congress will decline
to assume that Admiral Schley is culpable
by ordering an Investigation, nor will it
proceed to investigate the organization of
the navy unless specific charges are made
and the evidence clearly foreshadowed.
The Anti-trust League, which is made
up of men who are known for not being
able to distinguish between assertions and
evidence, is making a noisy demonstration
about the confirmation of Attorney Gen
eral Knox. The Pittsburg Dispatch, in al
luding to the matter, says that, "leaving
Mr. Knox's integrity out of vhe question
for argument's sake, no one has ever Im
peached his intelligence or his care of his
professional standing." It is a matter of
doubt if the Senate committee was jus
tified in paying as much attention as it
has to the few men who constitute this
league.
There arc always two ides to every
question, even that concerning the saloon,
and it is Interesting to hear both sides,
even if your mind is so absolutely and
positively made up that you can accept but
one view of the subject. There Is the at
titude of District Attorney Philbin, of New
York city, for instance. He is in favor
of law and order; of a Sunday closing law
and of strict saloon regulations. After out
lining his Ideas concerning such restric
tions and regulations, he goes on to say:
I do not know of any line of business
in which so much good can be accomp
lished as In the liquor business. A saloon
keeper who has a proper conception of his
duty to those persons patronizing his place
may be able to save men from becoming
victims to the evil of intemperance, and
by a high an l proper appreciation of that
duty prevent his place from b ing a great
j source of unhappiness and misery to the
lamines or me men wno are in the hatit
of frequenting it: and there are liquor
dealers who are mindful of such obliga
tions. On the other hand, there are bar
rooms of low class In this city that are the
rendezvous of criminals, and where crimes
are constantly being planned, apparently
within the knowledge of the proprietors, ns
has frequently been shown In criminal
trials.
The professional temieranee people will
be slow to accept his theory that a saloon
may be a reform Institution, but it will not
harm them to consider that point of view
for a time.

judgment by his brother officers. Philadel

court there will naturally continue 'to be a

could have dimmed his glory. By Insisting

been brought under that influence in the
Navy Department which has been respon

Schley hns been hounded ever since the

FENIANS BLAMED.
OfTicers nt Xer York Seek for Authors

NEW YORK, Dec 13. The presence of

the transatlantic liner Etruria reached
here to-day dlsclcsed the fact that they
were not only looking for Lawrie Marks,

the British government also is anxious

Several of tho Etrurla's passengers who
visited the scene of the explosion and

Superintendent Thomas, of the fire brigade
told them the Exchange was destroyed
by an Infernal machine timed to go off at
midnight, and which had been placed In
the oflices where brokers' samples of oil
were stored. He charged that Fenians
were at the bottom of the conspiracy.

also said, informed them that ho suspected

PASTOR FROM MICHIGAN
REV. WILLIAM C. COVF.RT, OF SAGI
NAW, AT SECOND PltESIJYTEItlAX.
Ills Subject Wns "The Widening
World" A Discourse Replete
with Interest.
The subject of the sermon rreached at
the Second Presbyterian Church by the
Rev. William C. Covert, of Saginaw, Mich.,
yesterday morning, was "The Widening
World." It was the purpose of the dis
course to indicate how the events of his
tory b.we widened life and given greater
scope to duty. The text was taken from
Esther iv, 14: "Who knoweth whether thou
art come into the kingdom for such a time
as this."
Rev. Covert said, in part: "If any man
has a helpful word that he feels is of God
and is calculated to inspire men and send
them forward to larger things, now is the
time for him to speak. We have just
crossed the threshold of what is to be tho
greatest century in the history of the race.
We are evidently entering on something
larger, grander and more heroic, and If you
have anything to say that will make me
more ready and capable to gather up the
responsibilities of the new and vaster coa
ditlons to which we have come you should
say it. There is an inspiring call to Chris
tian work in the enlarged and enlarging
conditions of life to which we have come.
I desire to indicate some of the things God
has used and is using to enlarge the scope
of human life and by which also He has set
this generation Into larger realms of duty.
"During recent centuries silent and revo
lutionary forces have been at work. They
have brought to the life of our day a new
and vaster amplitude than our fathers ever
dreamed of. This amplitude affects our
duty. This is a day when entire nations
are being born again. Knowledge never
was so rich, so mutual, so universal. Dr.
Dennis, speaking of our day and its herit
age, says: 'We are living in an era of cum
ulative and mighty consummations. Rich,'
full currents of history have converged upon
our century and have lifted us on a flood
tide of material prosperity, intellectual cul
ture and spiritual power. The young gen
eration just stepping to action is appealed
to by conditions more inspiring than his
tory has hitherto afforded. Shame to us if,
after Goel has set before us these wider
fields and put into our hands these larger
powers and set up these new and mutual
relations in the earth, we of this day do
not see our duty and go forward to dis
charge. DEVELOPING HUMANITY".
"Did you ever stop and think how God
has been constantly developing humanity
by breaking down the little selfish walls
with which she has circumscribed herself
and thus thrusting her out into tho strong
er currents of the world's life. He has al
ways done it; He Is doing It to-day. In
this great fact lies the inspiration to which
I have referred. Look at some of the ob
vious facts in history. .
"Go back to the fall of Constantinople.
There the roots of our twentieth century
are buried. Over western Europe was the
darkness and ignorance of the middle ages.
Languages were crude, men depraved, life
barren. Constantinople was the home of
learning; there gathered the poets and
philosophers and theologians of the day.
There they stayed though men were hun
gering and dying out there in the west. It
Is not God's way. The cruel Turk won his
ambitions, smote the brilliant capital and
sent by the blessed calamity these poets
and teachers into the needy west. They
were the couriers of the new learning and
of a wider life. Then knowledge was bound.
No books; priceless manuscripts wer?
chained in monasteries. This barrier must
be taken away, so God moving through
Gutenberg set up the types and through
some other genius gave us paper and
knowledge went on the wings of the morn
ing. This was but the beginning of the
widening process. The spirit of adventure
arose and mingled with the desire for
learning. The sea .had kept Europe at
home and her life bound. This barrier
is next removed. God gave men the mag
netic needle and moved in the heart of
Columbus and the barrier disappeared.
Mind was yet In bondage. The way of
thinking and of being saved ws pre
scribed by men. Proud spirits chafe un
der this tyranny. Then Martin Luther
nailed his thesis to the church door at
Wittenberg and the world stepped out
into a freedom hitherto unknown.
Copernicus came and widened the skies
and made a new. heaven over a new earth
and quickened thereby the imagination of
men and set life in great bounds. New
views of humanity have been constantly
forced upon us and our. neiei or duty thus
enlargedr Ballroads and steamships and
telegraph lines bind the ends of the earth
together and every man white, black, rtd
or vellow has become a neighber. The
gospel missionary has contributed to this
amplitude. He has pushed the horizon of
the church's duty farther out.
LARGER LIFE AND SERVICE.
"Our own Nation has had a call to larger
life and service. We were a people isolat
ed, prosperous and respected, magnifying
our own politics and in peril of losing our
soul by gaining a world of wealth. God
had other plans for our development. We
wcro too rich and strong to be Idle. We
were approached by a moral duty. A great
wrong was uncovered before our eyes and
we found ourselves at war. And when it
was over we found Cuba free but our Na
tion bound, and every virtue and grace
of national character put to the test. Never
did the people of this Nation have so plain
a call to larger responsibility and never
has any national event given so wide a
range to our national life and duty. We
are out Into the swiftest currents cf the
world's life. Shall we go on to strength
and true greatness? Now what dos all
this mean?
"Touching our mutual feelings, it means
that the truest motives for world wide
evangelization have been discovered. All
men have been brought together. We look
into the eye and feel the heart beat of the
poorest, darkest man in Africa. To see is
to le appealed to. It means that the church
Is face to face with the greatest opportun
ity in her history. The world Is op'.-n be
fore her. May God improve her people
that the opportunity may b met.
"It means, too, that God intends so to
widen our life, so to bring men together,
so to set up these mututl relations of
business and literature and religion that
If the Church of Christ will ke.p her heart
pure and urge upon men the claims of
Jesus that the day will come that shone
In Christ's own eyes when the kingdoms
of the world will be His. For this g orious
consummation may the church labor!"
SOME OF THE NEW BOOKS
A History of American Art.
There has been much written in a gen
eral, discursive and critical way concern
ing particular features or phases of Amer
ican art, and many American artists have
been written about individually, but the
present work Is the first attempt to treat
the subject as an entirety and to trace the
development of American art from its ear
liest beginning to present times. "A His
tory of American Art," by Sadaklchl Hart
man, is a valuable contribution not only to
the special field to which it belongs, but to
American literature, for beside rare famil
iarity with American art and artists the
author shows a degree of literary culture
attractive to general readers. The first
chapter in the book, which consists of two
volumes of liberal size, treats of "American
art before lSl'S." In this chapter one learns
how the earliest American painters of
note Copley, Trumbull, Peale and Allston
got their inspiration and start. The Amer
ican artist in the latter part of the eight
eenth century had a rough road to travel.
Most of them were "traveling artists," who
went forth over the country, painting por
traits or sign boards, decorations for stage
coaches and fire engines or whatever else
they could find to do for practice and liv
ing. Yet all four of those above named
lived to become famous in England, and
Benjamin West not only became a personal
friend of the King, who almost exclusively
employed him as his historical painter from
17G7 until 12. but he succeeelcd Sir Joshua
Reynolds in the presidentship of the Itoyal
Academy in 1?j2. Other artists treated of
In this chapter are Gilbert Stuart, one of
the greatest portrait painters of moelern
times, who painted three portraits of
George Washington; Thomas Sully, John
Vanderlyn, Washington Allston and others
of the early misters. The chapter con
cludes: "The art of few nations can boast
of having possessed at the very start one
of the most remarkable portraitists of all
times and countries, and to have produced,
in regard to proportion and symmetry of
form and composition, gravity and dignity
in motive and conception, one of the best
nudes ever painted." The last allusion is to
Vanderlyn's "Ariadne of Naxos," of which
the author says in another place, "It is in
my opinion the best nude this country has
ever produced." Successive chapters treat
of "Our Landscape Painters," "The Old
Scherl." "The New School." "American
Sculpture," "The Graphic Arts," "Amer
ican Art in Europe" and "Latest rhases."
In these chapters the author treats not only
of painters and sculptors, but of engravers
and illustrators, among whom one encoun
ters many familiar names of recent times
and of the present. But the author is not
greatly enamorcel of present-day art. He
thinks It leads to superficiality and frivol
ity. "Our art of to-day," he concludes,
"lacks young people who. with compete nt,
finished work realize the new Ideas they
strive for. Studies alone are not sufficient.
We must have more thinking painters, like
Hunt and Fuller, like Innis. Martin. Thay
er, Homer, Dewing and Tryon; like Whis
tler and Sargent and St. Gaudens; men to
whom the American Nation owes a debt It
can never repay, not only because they
were Insensible to mercenary temptations
and faithfully accomplished the ideals of
their youth, but because their genius
proved powerful enough to strnggle against
the indifference of a whole nation, and thus
bequeathed to us In this very era of com
mercialism a proud and self-reliant native
art." The book shows remarkable knowl
edge of all departments of art and is em
bellished by many beautiful engravings. It
is published by L. C. Page & Co., Boston,
in Art Lovers' Series.
Historic TMvns of Western Stntes.
A few years ago Mr. B. G. Twaltes, an
Industrious literary compiler, began the
preparation of a series of short histories
of the notable towns and cities cf Newr
England. This was followed by a second
volume treating of the towns of the Mid
dle States, by a third treating of the towns
of the Southern States, and now by a
fourth entitled "Historic Towns of West
ern States." The plan can hardly be called
one of impartial history, for the history It
embraces is very partial in the sense of
being local and, therefore, incomplete.
Nevertheless, it is pretty good history as
to particular spots, and the several
sketches, done by different persons selected
with special reference to their knowledge
of local history, contain much matter of
local and considerable of gvneral interest.
In fact, the work is very good as far as
it goes, but it is rather misleading in the
suggestion that it contains sketches of all
the historic towns in the Western States.
The towns treated, and for the most part
very well treated, in this volume are Ma
rietta. Cleveland, Cincinnati, Detroit,
Mackinac, Indianapolis, Vincennes, Chi
cago, Madison, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Des
Moines, St. Ixuis, Kansas City, Omaha,
Denver. Santa Fe. Spokane, Portland. Salt
Lake City, San Francisco, Monterey and
Los Angeles. Some of these cities have an
early history while others are compara
tively modern, but all are worth telling
about. Yet the list does not include nearly
all of the historic and interesting towns
of different States. Thus in Ohio the old
historic towns of Athens and Chillicothe,
not to mention others, are conspicuous by
their absence. The first was the seat of
the first university established west of
the Allegheny mountains, the old Ohio Uni
versity established nearly twenty years be
fore that of Marietta, which is mentioned,
and Chillicothe was an Indian town be
fore It was a white settlement, and has an
interesting history. The Indiana list, to
be nearly complete, should have embraced
sketches of Corydon. New Harmony and
other historic towns, and so, perhaps, in
other States. But the line had to be drawn
somewhere, and for the size of the book it
has been judiciously drawn. The sketch of
this city, written by Hon. Perry S. Heath,
characterizes Indianapolis as "perhaps the
handsomest city between Philadelphia and
Denver." It is a good summary of the
early history and later growth of the city.
The sketch of Vincennes, by W. H. Smith,
traverses the well known ground of the
early history of that town in considerably
more space than that given to Indianapo
lis The sketch of Chicago Is by Hon. Ly
man J. Gage, that of San Francisco by
Edwin Markham, and all the writers show
good knowledge of the subjects. The book
is broucht out in excellent style by d. 1 .

Entirely American ns this story Is in its
scenery, setting and characters, It can
scarcely be said to have an American at
mosphere except In as far as remote co
lonial times resemble those of a later pe
riod. Compared with the present the at
mosphere is foreign. The story opens in
the spring of 1774 at the residence of Sir
William Johnson, who was commissioner
of Indian- affairs for the Crown. Of thia
residence the author says in a prefatory
I note that It is still standing in Johnstown,
N Y.. and that "one may see the
hatchet scars in the solid mahogany ban
isters where Thaycndanegea hacked out
polished chips." The story deals mainly
with the fortunes of Sir William's two
wards. Michael Cardigan, a young fellow
of sixteen at the opening of the story, who
subsequently became a dashing soldier, and
Felicity Warren, who is first introduceu
as -Silver Heels." The story runs on his
torical lines, and among the characters in
troduced are Patrick Henry. Loan the
frl-nd of the white man. John Hancock,
Paul Revere, Jos. ph Brant and several In
dian Chiefs Of the period. Part of the
action takes place in Boston where Ine
reader gets a Klimpse of the political clubs
of the pa'riots and other phases of the
times. But historic fact and atmosphere
are subordinate to the loves and adventures
of Cardigan and Silver Heels The story
abounds with ad, . nture s yet it moves

and father verbose- style s.ems somewhat
Tabored. Nevertheless It contains many

Two Timely Health Hooks.
"The Children's Health." by Florence
Hull Wlnterburn. in ten not very long
chapters, gives a very long list of things
to be done, or left undone, to the

Stronger and better men and women. As
befits a work Intended more for the house
hold than the study or clinic, the book
deris largely in those general rubs and
terms that would there be better under

couched in more scientific language. It
lays down broad rules fcr uencral guid

"The Convalescents Receipt Bock" is
a little volume born of long experi

A rilojrrnphj- of LoTvell. ,
The iwo volumes of the life of Jarne
Rüsten Lowell, by Horace E. Scud??r, are
very Interesting. They are written with
great discrimination by a friend who has
the literary instinct and who knows how
to present the life of another literary man
In proper lights ami with excellent whole
effects. Taken altogether, Lowell waa
about the best all-round product cf th
culture of New England In the last cen
tury. Others there were who may have
surpassed him in certain lines of thought
and work, but he was great as a linguist,
teacher, reformer, poet, essayist, editor,
orator and diplomatist, and builded a char
acter that was strong, beautiful and worthy
of imitation. His love of freedom wa? the
keynote of his life, and because he knew
a greater measure of it was attainable In
America than anywhere else on earth, ha
loved his country intensely and took 'the
ekepest Interest In its welfare. He wa
given to criticism of much that was politi
cal and was quick to point out things that
he thought were blotches on his country's
tame; but he did these things from a hih
sense of duty and with the hope that when
the faults were corrected there would he
greater freedom and 'more opportunity to
attain the complete success of democracy,
which was his dream.
He was charged with having become
Anglicized. That was the last thing he
could have been guilty of, if it meant he
ever loved England more than he did
America. When he represented the United
States at the court of St. James he was
American to the core. Truly, he was
pleased with the associations, literary, po
litical and social, in England; but Cam
bridge, Massachusetts and Harvard College
were the heart of his existence. He was
quick to resent any slurs upon his native
land, all the years he was abroad, and
the record of his life, looked at a? a whole,
discloses an American citizen than whom
none was better.
The literary appreciations concerning
Lowell in thc.se volumes are In Mr. Scud
cer's best vein. He knows his subject and
analyzes the work done by this distin
guished man with great keenness. He also
brings out with much clearness the per
sonal characteristics of Mr. Lowell, throw
ing sidelights on his home life, his friend
ships, his work in literature and as a pru
fessor in Harvard, using many letters that
were not printed in the book of letters
edited by Mr. Norton. Houghton, Mithin &
Co., Boston. ,
The Strength of the Hills. ,
This novel, by Miss Florence Wilkinson,
is the ninth in number of a series of new
books by new authors, selected by Harper
& Brothers as worthy to represent Amer'w
Ican life. The scenery of the tale lie:
mostly in the Adirondacks, and for a brief
period in New York city. The author at
tempts to depict the contrast between the
dwellers among the hills and the family
of the mill owner who has for years been
gathering wealth by robbing the hills of the
forests under whose shelterlngstrength the
rivers are born upon which the valleys
of the State depend for their fertility. Tue
mountaineers of this Etory have physical
strength and resolute minds, but are not'
versed in the arts and graces of life and see
an impassable gulf between them and the
luxurious summer campers from the cltyi
who hold out the patronizing hand. Enoch'
Holmes, the mountain hero, is by no means;
a captl.-ating person. He is a logger, over'
six feet in height, has a fair knowledge!
of books, and alms to be a preacher; is ex-;
tremely overbearing and when he gives way '
to anger, eases nts rage by quoting from
the Bible. On these occasions his quota
tions bear a strong resemblance to pro-
fanity. When he is trying to tell hia love
to his loved one and she seeks to evade
the declaration, he bursts out: "You will
not listen to me, and why? You
hold yourself apart like a different clay.
What do we know of you, or you
of us? The crackling of thorns un
der a pot, and I have said all there is to
say of you." The statement of the author j
that "Enoch was always most cruel when
he most deeply loved," does not add to his
attractions. He is a sorry hero and does ;
not seem to represent any common type of ;
American manhood. There are some fine i
descriDtions and some readable converra- I
tions. Others are crude and too long. Mis
Wilkinson will by study, practice and care
ful cutting out of unnece ssary "filling" suc
ceed as a story writer. Harper & Brothers,
New York.
The Portion of Labor.
The title of this latest book by Mary EL
Wilkins is likely to repel more readers than
it draws, since it does not suggest wholly
agreeable possibilities, but those who brave
ly take their chances are well repaid. It
Is not a study of "labor" in a large sense,
and none of the Industrial problems Is
solved. If any purpose Is undertaken by
the author or lesson taught it is that the
education of schools is not essential to the
building up of fine, strong characters nor
even to the making of men and women
equal to all occasions. The child Ellen,
who is the hcrrnne of the tale. Is an excep
tional person. It Is true, a lily In a garden
of coarser flowers; but she Is not an im
possible product of such parentage and en
vironment, it Is r.ot uncommon, in fact,
to find fine-iibcrcd creatures such as ehe
springing from Fuch an unpromising par
entage as the respected and respectable
but narrow and intolerant Brewsters and
the coarse and ignorant, but warm-hearte-d
Louds. The best came out In all of thrm,
even the high-tempered Mrs. Brewster, in
the ir time of stress, while Ellen was more
ennobled by her "portion of labor" and
the attendant responsibilities thrown upon
her than she could have been by the four
years of Vassar which she gave up for a
place in the shoe factory whn sh- real
ized the family ihoI. The book, which is
Miss Wilkins's most ambitious work, is
undoubtedly her best. It Is not. Ilk some
