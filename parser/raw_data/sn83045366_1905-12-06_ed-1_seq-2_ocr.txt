Senator Armstrong's Comment on
ft Disclosures in Mutual Re
serve Quia Today.
1
New York. Dec. 6.That the man
agement of the Mutual Reserve iund
Life association was so honeycombed
with evils that its officers had to yield
to practically every demand made upon
it bv ''strikers" was clearly estab
lished at yesterday's session of the
Armstrong investigating committee.
I The facts brought out by Inquisitor
1 Hughea made evident the necessity or
examining the president of the associa
tion, Frederick A. Burnham, who is
1, ill at* his home as a result of an opera
tion upon his ear.
George D. Eldridge, first vice pTesi
i dent and actuary of the .Mutual Be
5 serve Life, was todav first witness. The
witness said the $15,000 paid to Tracv,
Boardman & Piatt for legal expenses
appearing before legislative com
inittees to secure the enactment of a
I bill reincorporating the Mutual Reserve
1 company in 1901 was charged to the
general exDenses of the company.
B. R. Soliday, of Trenton, took out a
policy in 1886 for an amount not to
exceed $8,500 in the Northwestern Life
Insurance company, which later was
bought up by the Mutual Reserve com
pany. Mr. Eldredge said the mutual
I reserve gave Soliday a policy for $8,500
in place of the one he held in the North
western but put a hen of $2,360 against
it. Excess mortality charges later
madec against the policy cut its face
value to $3,765. Altogether Soliday
i paid $1,843 into the Mutual reserve as
premiums at the late of $483 a year
and got for it in 1905 a paid up policy
for $332.
Mr. Hughes questioned the witness
as to why his company made represen
tations to a policyholder that its pre
mium rate would be a uniform amount
and then made special assessments?
against him in addition. One instance
related elicited the comment from beu
ator Armstrong:
"Tt does not seem remaikable that
there was a high morality among peo
ple hoiaing such policies. 1 should
think it would kill them."
The case which called forth this com*
ment was that of a policy for $5,000
taken out in 1881 by a man 56 years old.
The premium on this policy ranged from
$398 the first year to $780 the last \ear,
and amounted in all to $4,396. Aftei
carrying the policy for twenty years
the man allowed it to lapse 1901. and
got nothing.
Mr. Eldredge said it was impossible
to prevent the high premiums charged
later because the early premiums were
insufficient.
Mr. Eldredge said his company has
made no payments to Andrew Hamil
ton, the legislative agent, nor to An
drew C. Fields, to maintain a house in
Albany. PEOPLE IN PANIC
LEAP FROM SHIP
Fear Vessel Is Sinking and Are
TerrorStrickenSeveral
Lost.
Havana, Dec. 6.A- wild panic on
board the French line steamer X.a Cham
pag'n'e yesterday resulted in the injury
of six and the possible drowning of
from three to six persons. The Cham
pagne arrived from French and Spanish
ports with 350 cabin and 1,400 steerage
passengers, 1.100 of whom were bound
for Havana and 300 for Mexico.
The steamer had a small cargo and
but little coal, and after anchoring and
discharging the cabin passengers she
began coaling. At the time she was
slightly listed, and the ciowd of Spanish
immigrants swarming to her side to
watch the lighters caused her to (list
more and to take a quantity of water
thru her cpen coal ports.
Some of the lighter men called out
that the ship was sinking, alVd the
frightened immigrants struggled and
fought for a chance to escape. Some
400 men and women jumped to the
lighters and a sec re of men into the
water.
A few of these swam ashore and
some of them clung to small boats. A
check of the passenger list after quiet
was restored showed six passengers
missing. I is n-ot definitely known
that these were drowned, as it is possi
ble they reached the shore.

AMBASSADOR'S JOB
IN THE BALANCE
Thompson Threatened with Dis
missal from Post in Brazil's
Capital.
Which haS CUred thOUSandS. lativ blackmai &d nothing else.
Special to The Journal.
Washington, Dec. 6.David E
Thompson, ambassador to Brazil, is
threatened with dismissal from office.
Two reasons are assigned, either of
which is considered good for dismissal.
The president has given no intimation
of his final action, but it is understood
Mr. Thompson, who is now at his home
in Nebraska, will not return to his
post.
Ambassador Thompson and Eugene
Seeger, consul general at Eio Janeiro,
had a row and each sought to injure the
other with the authorities here. The
ambassador forwarded charges against
Mr. Seeger, making allegations that
seemed to disqualify him for continu
ance in office. Conisul General Seeger,
in turn, preferred charges against Mr.
Thompson.
The charges in each instance were
regarded by the president as serious,
and the solicitor general, Mr. Penfield
of the state department, was sent to
Brazil with instructions to make a thoro
investigation. Mr. Penfield completed
his errand and returned.
Ambassador Thompson followed Mr.
Penfield to the United States, landing
in New York soon after Penfield's ar
rival. He remained there a few days
and then proceeded to his Nebraska
home. He did not come here and pay
the usual visit of respect to the presi
dent and secretary of state. This neg
lect is almost,equivalent to an unpar
donable offense.

finding one so broad in its statesman
ship, so free from personal bias, so pro
nounced in its logic.
Most people remember that when
Theodore Roosevelt succeeded William
M'Kinley as the result of the shocking
tragedv at Buffalo, there was a feeling
of downright apprehension as to what
this strenuous, young man would do
with the government of the United
States. The fear was expressed most
particularly that he would embroil us
with foreign nations. I twas alleged
that he was a jingo by temperament and
that he could not resist the temptation
to get up a row with some European na
tion, which would enable him to make
active use of the army an*d navy.
Denial of Jingoism.
There could not be a better denial
of all this than the message sent to
congress yesterday. I deals almost ex
clusively with domestic questions, and
it discusses these issues in a broad,
philosophic spirit which is about as
far removed from impetuous enthusiasm
as one could well imagine.
It is this logical, conservative and
dispassionate discussion of great public
questions which attracted so much at
tention among public men and which
induces them to declare there never has
been such a state paper in the history
of the nation.
Most of the conservative men in e&n*
gress are particularly delighted at those
sections in the president's message.in
which he reads to the people at large
and insists that they shall not perse
cute the rich man any more than the
poor man. One paragraph which was
especially quoted at the capitol, both
by republicans and democrats, is that
in which, after discussing the necessity
of railroad reform, the president says:
Square Deal to All.
"This legislation should be enacted
in a spirit as remote as possible from
hysteria and rancor. I we of the
America body politic are true to the
traditions we have inherited we sliall
always scorn any effort to make us
hate any man because he is rich, just
as much as we should scorn any effort
to make us look down upon or treat con
temptuously any man because he is
poor.''
During the summer the paid liter
ary agents of the railroads have per
sistently misrepresented the attitude of
the president. A effort was made
to persuade the people that he pro
posed to create a commission which
would have power to initiate all rail
road rates and which, on that account,
would upset the transportation busi
ness of the entire country. I was
apparently to put an end to all this
misrepresentation that the president
wrote one clear-cut passage which, in
the opinion of members of congress,
without regard to party, furnishes the
text on which railroad-rate legislation
will be built.
Cleared the Atmosphere.
This significant passage, which has
cleared the atmosphere so much at the
capitol, reads:
I call your attention to the fact
that my proposal is not to give the
commission power to initiate or orig
inate rates generallv, but td regulate
a rate already fixed or originated by
the roads,, upon comolaint an- after
investigation. A heavy penalty should
be exacted from any corporation which
fails to respect an order of the com
mission. I regard this power to estab
lish a maximum rate as being essential
to anv scheme of real reform in the
matter of railway regulation. Th
first necessity is to secure it, and unless
it is granted to the commission there
is little use in touching the subiect at

Cutoff Canal to Remedy'Missis

Duluth Harbor.
4^
5 By W. W. Jermane.
Washington, Dec. 6. Representa
tive Bede will take up the question of
prevention of floods in the Mississippi
river as soon as the rivers and har
bors committee is appointed by Speaker
Cannon. He proposes to have the com
mittee request General MacKenzie,
chief of engineers, to instruct the river
and harbor board of engineers to exam
ine and report on the question of the
construction of a cutoff canal in Aitkin
county, across the bend in the Missis
sippi river. The question was discussed
by Major Abbott when he was in
charge of river and harbor work in
Minnesota ten years ago, and all data
are at hand for the use of this board,
which is composed of engineer officere
stationed in Washington. Mr. Bede be
lieves the project is feasible and will
urge it.
Another proposition* that Bede will
have considered by the engineer board
is for the construction of a break
water outside the entrance to the Du
luth harbor to prevent injury to the
works at the harbor mouth and to af
ford a safe anchorage for vessels inside
the harbor.
Ones
proposition is the con-
thi breakwater half a
mile outside the barbor entrance, but
this would be more expensive than
congress would probably care to au
thorize. A second and more practical
project provides for the construc
tion of a wing breakwater just out
side the harbor entrance, with an open
ing in the middle for tho passage of
vessels, which will be less expensive.
The board will be asked to investigate
and report on both projects.

While these investigations were be.-

to lemember that only a few days pre
vious 'she had found a paper sack tied
to the door of her schoolhouse contain
ing an orange and bearing the inscrip
tion, in a feminine hand, "For Teach-
er." She was about to peel the orange
and distribute the sections among the
pupils when one of the scholais, call
ing her attention to the fact that there
was a hole punched in the orange, she
decided to take it home. She placed
it on a pantry shelf, where it had re
mained forgotten until after the well
episode. Suspecting then that it, too,
uigh have been poisoned, the orange
was forwarded to the state chemist,
wno discovered that there was enough
strychnine in it to kill fifty people.

fendant at the church the Sunday prev

orange, concerning which the prosecu

of the footprints and the shoes, the
supposed attempt of the brother to ob

The line of the defense is not defin

however, included $50,000,000 on ac
count of the Panama canal.
The total amount of United States
paper currency issued during the last

Shaw on Currency.
On the subject of the currency, the
secretary says
The necessity for an elastic currency
has received fresh emphasis in the
financial conditions of the last few
months. Millions were loaned, approxi
mately at 1 per cent in midsummer, and
call money reached 25 per cent in No
vember. The exceedingly low rate was
about as dangerous as the high rate,
for the latter was the logical result
of the former. Such extremes can and
should be Tendered impossible.
As a means to this end, I suggest
the advisability of permitting national
banks to issue a yolume of additional,
government guaranteed currency, equal
in amount to 50 per cent of the bond
secured currency maintained by them,
but oubnect to a tax of 5 or 6 per cent
until redeemed by the deposit of a like
amount in the treasury. By eliminat

The Journal is printing daily
communications from streetcar
expressing opinions as to whether the
gates on the streetcars do constitute a
nuisance by causing unnecessary delay
and many inconveniences, or whether
they are a protection against accidents,
as the company contends, and should be
retained.
It should be understood that The
Journal wants a perfectly unbiased
expression of public sentiment. At the
same time, readers of this paper should
hardly expect that the discussion cov
ers all phases of complaint against the
streetcar management. Suggestions for
the improvement of streetcar service
are in order, but they should bear
directly in this instance upon the ques
tion as to whether the gates should, or
not, be abolished.
Several correspondents have asked
why, if the gates are so beneficial, that
the streetcar systems of other cities
have not adopted them.
The a 1 has endeavored to
get from the streetcar management
some explanation as to why its illus
trious example has not been followed.
The management replies that other sys
Jnw would be glad to put on gateB, but
that they fear their patrons would ob

It is altogether likely that this is
truefew other cities .would stand for
the delays and annoyances occasioned

AREYOURRIDNEYS WEAK?
Thousands of Men and Women Have Kidney
Trouble and Never Suspect It.
To Prove What the Great Kidney Remedy, Swamp-Root Will I
Do for YOU, Every Reader of The Journal May Have
a Sample Bottle Sent Absolutely Free by Mail.
It used to be considered that only urinary and
bladder troubles were to be traced to the kid
neys, but now modern science proves that nearly
all diseases have their beginning in the disor
der of these most important organs.
Therefore, when your kidneys are weak or out
of order, you can understand how quickly your
entire body is affected, and how every organ
seems to fail to do its duty.
If you are sick or "feel badly" begin taking
the great kidney remedy, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp
Root, because as soon as your kidneys begin to
fet better they will help all the other organs to
ealth. A trial will convince anyone.
I was out of health and run down generally, had
QO appetite, was dizzy and suffered with headache
:nost of the times.u I did not know that my kldney|
were the cause of my trouble, but somehow felt
that theye be, and I began taking Swamp-

Mrs. A. L. Walker, S31 E Linden St., Atlanta, Ga.
Weak and unhealthy Kidneys are responsible
for many kinds of diseases, and if permitted to
continue much Buffering and fatal results are sure
to follow. Kidney trouble irritates tha nerves,
makes you dizzy, restless, sleepless and irritable.
Makes you pass water often during the day and
obliges you to get up many times during the
night. Unhealthy kidneys cause rheumatism,
gravel, catarrh of the bladder, pain or dull ache
in the back, joints and muscles make your head1
ache and back ache, cause indigestion, stomach
and liver trouble, you get a sallow, yellow com
lexion make you feel as though you had heart
you may have plenty of ambition, but
no strength get weak and waste away.
The cure for these troubles is Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Eoot, the world-famous kidney remedy.
In taking Swamp-Boot you afford natural help
to Nature, for Swamp-Boot is the most perfect
healer and gentle aid to the kidneys that is
known to medical science.
How to Find Out
If there is any doubt in your mind as to your
condition, take from your urine on rising about
four ounces, place it a glass or bottle and let
it stand twenty-four hours. I on examination
it is milky or cloudy, if there is a brick-dust
settling, or if small particles float about in it,
your kidneys are in need of immediate attention.
Swamp-Boot is pleasant to take and is used
in the leading hospitals, recommended by phy
sicians in their private practice, and is taken^by
doctors themselves who have kidney ailments',
because they recognize in it the greatest and
most successful remedy for kidney, liver and
bladder troubles.
Five Votes Against Gates.
To the Editor of The Journal:
We, the undersigned, wish the gates
removed from our cars by all means,
as we have missed many a connection
that, had the car been minus the gate,
we might have, with a big jump, got
to" our destination by the time we
wished. We feel that the gates con
stitute a great disadvantage and that
it would be a great advantage to have
them removed.

should go, but no sufficient reason for
retaining them.
To me, the most important feature
of the matter seems to be in case of
an accident. Take the case on the
Central avenue line (and everybody
remembers what a fearful and terrify
ing accident it was), when a railroad
train struck a streetcar full of passen
gers, all securely shut in, so that they
would be safe from accident, from the
company's view of the case. I there
had been no gates, many could have
escaped but they were penned in and
held for massacre. A chance to escape
danger should be considered over and
above all other things.
No other large cities have gates on
streetcars. Are the people^ of Min
neapolis so .much less intelligent than
those of other cities that they must be
cooped up and shut in like rats in a
trap, or they could not be carried with
safety to themselves? Avoid the death
trap at all hazards by taking off the
gates.'
