PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
HARRISON'S THIRD ANNUAL BUNCH
OF RECOMMENDATIONS.
The Clillinn AfTnlr Treated at Consider
able I.ength—Reparation Demnmled.
Tariff Law Claimed to lie Far From a
Burden Upon the People.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. President
Harrison's third annual message to con
gress was delivered to-day. Congress is
informed that the long-pending dispute
with England over the Behring sea seal
fisheries has been satisfactorily settled
on a basis of arbitration proposed by
England, and during the year ending
May 1 next only 7,500 skins are to be
taken in the Behring islands.
Congress is urged to provide for a
joint demarcation of the frontier line
between Canada and the United States,
wherever required, and especially for
the exact location of the water boundary
in the rivers, lakes and straits.
The announcement is made that Ger
many, Denmark, Italy, Austria and
France have opened their ports to in
spected American pork and pork
products.
The recent political disturbances in
Brazil were a subject of international
discussion, and the latest information is
that constitutional government has been
re-established in Brazil without blood
shed.
New Orleans Lynching anil Chilian War.
The lynching of eleven Italians in
New Orleans is considered by the presi
dent a deplorable and discreditable inci
dent. Claims for indemnity for the
men's families were made by the Italian
minister and not allowed. That un
happy incident led the president to sug
gest to congress that offenses against
the treaty rights of foreigners domiciled
in the United States should be cogniza
ble in our federal courts.
The civil war in Chili, the seizure of
the Chilian war vessel Itata at San
Diego, Cal., by United State3 court offi
cials for violating our neutrality laws,
her escape, and the subsequent chastise
ment of her officers by the Chilian pro
visional government are reviewed. The
United States government was disap
pointed in attempts to bring about a
peaceful adjustment of the rebellion in
Chili but at no time did our govern
ment, officially or otherwise, recognize
the insurgents, and our naval officers at
Santiago and our minister there were
enjoined from first to last, against tak
ing anything but neutral ground.
Assault Upon United States Seamen.
The assault upon United States sea
men from the steamship Baltimore in
Valparaiso harbor, (Jet. 10,' called for
prompt and decided action on the part
of our government. One officer was
killed and eight men seriously injured,
one of whom has since died. The as
saults were unprovoked. Our men
were unarmed. The attention of the
Chilian government was at once called
to the affair and notice was served that
due reparation would be insisted upon
if the assault proved to have been
wholly unprovoked. The reply of the
Chilian provisional government was
offiensive. This government is now
awaiting the result of an investigation
by the criminal courts at Valparaiso,
which result is looked for soon. This
whole matter will be the subject of a
special message to congress if Chili does
not vender due and speedy account of
licm-lf for that unjust and murderous
attack iiixui our seamen.
A friendly but firm protest has been
"-made to Rn.-sia against the hard meas
ures oit'ired against Jews in that
country.
The Nicaragua canal project receives
the hearty endorsement of the presi
dent, who urges that government aid be
extended, if necessary, to complete the
canal speedily, and he hopes that neither
party nor sectional lines may act as a
drawback to this great project which
means much for Americans.
Tlie Treasury Department.
The president insists that tariff and
other legislation of the last congress has
been only benefictal to all classes. Dur
ing the twelve months from Oct. 1,
1800, to Sept. 30. 1891, the total value of
our foreign commerce (imports and ex
ports combined) was $1,747,800,400,
which was the largest of any year in the
history of the United States.
During the year ending Sept. 30. 1891,
our imports of merchandise amounted
to $824,71 ,270, which was an increase
of more than eleven million dollars over
the value of the imports of the corres
ponding months of the preceding year.
The value of free imports during the
twelve months ending Sept. 30, 1891,
was $118,092,887 more than the value of
free imports during the corresponding
twelve months of the preceding year.
The Silver Question.
Under the law of July 14, 1890, the
secretary of the treasury has purchased
since Aug. 13, during the fiscal year 48,
393,113 ounces of silver bullion at an
average cost of $1,043 per ounce. The
highest price paid during the year was
$1,202.'), and the lowest $0.9836. In ex
change for this silver bullion there have
been issued $50,577,498 of the treasury
notes authorized by the act.
The surplus on March 1,1889, was
$183,827,190.£9. The policy of applying
this surplus to the redemption of the
interest-bearing securities of the United
States was thought to be preferable to
that of depositing it without interest in
selected national banks. There have
been redeemed since the date last men
tioned of interest bearing securities
$250,079,350, resulting in a reduction of
the annual interest charge of $11,084,
57 ir.
The result of this policy, of the silver
legislation, and of the refunding of the
41 per cent, bonds has been a large in
crease in the money in circulation. At
the date lust named the circulation was
$1,404,203,898, oy $28.08 per capita
while on the first day of December, 1891,
it had increased to $1,577,862,070, or
$24.38 per capita.
TI10 Postofflce Department.
The revenues of the department show
an increase of over five millions of dol
lars, while the estimates for tlio year
1893 shows a surplus of receipts over
expenditures. Eight thousand miles «f
new iostnV service has been established
upon railroads. The president recom
mends that free mail delivery he ex
tended to all towns of.0,000 inhabitants,
(hat all country pontoftices he uiaOu
money order stations, and that the sy*
tem of free mail delivery in couuiry
district* be tried.

a citizen his relations with the general
government should cease, and the state
should not ba compelled to bear the ex
pense of educating Indian children. He
believes in bringing Indian chiidren into
country schools and thinks the general
government should pay from tribal
funds, into the state treasury, an
amount equal to the school tax upon the
property of each Indian father. The
Sioux outbreak of one year ago is re
viewed, and the president states that
General Miles "protected the settlers
and subjected the hostiles with the least
possible loss."
The area of Indian reservations li:\s
been reduced 23,000,000 acres since
March 4, 1889, by allotting lands to
Indians iu severalty and by ceding re
maining lands to the United Stales for
disposition under the homestead laws.
Tito Pension liureuu.
A report from the pension commis
sioner shows that the total number of
pensioners on the roll June i!J, 1NIM,
was 070,100. There were allowed dur
ing the fiscal year ending at that time
250,555 cases. The appropriation for
the payment of pensions for the fiscal
year 1890-91 was $12?,885,998.89 awl the
amount expended $118,530,659.25, lead
ing an unexpended surplus of '$9,155,
144.05.
Subsidized Railroads.
The report of the commissioner of
railroads shows that the total debt of
the the subsidized railroads to the
United States Dec. 31, 1800, was $112,
512,613.06. A large part of this debt is
now fast approaching maturity with no
adequate provision for its payment.
In closing his third annual message to
congress the president pleads for .ballot
reform in all sections and under all cir
cumstances urges railroad and other
corporations to throw additional safe
guards around the lives of their em
ployes, and hopes that increased appro
priations may be made to carry on the
work of the civil service commission.
Chilians Anxious to
See
BALTIMORE, Dec. 8. The annual
meeting of the Maryland State Grange
began during the evening. The closing
session will probably be held Thursday.
An officer of the grunge says that in all
probability only routine business would
be transacted during the meeting. He
added that the Maryland Grange will
not connect itself in any way with the
Farmers' Alliance, as the members do
not favor admitting politics into their
organization. There are about 1,050
members of the Grange.
Archbinop Ireland'* Declaration.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.—Archbishop
Ireland has created a sensation in Wash
ington ljy a declaration which lie made
iu the course of a sermon which lit- de
livered here on Sunday. He was preach
ing in the humblest Catholic church in
the city, a church devoted to negroes
and having a large congregation of the
colored race. In the course of his re
marks he said: "If Jesus Christ and
the twelve apostles should appear at ono
of the fashionable churches at Washing
ton today, attired in poor garments
which he and his humble followers
wore, there is every reason to believe
the.v would be refused admission by the
churchmen and turned into the street."
Foster's Condition.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.—Secretary
Foster lias continued to improve during
the day. The symptoms of his case

The North Dakota liuomer'g Scheme to
Populate the State.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Colonel O. M.
Towner, a leading citizen of North
Dakota, is in the capital. He is making
a tou* of the couutry in the interests of
a big immigration company, of which
he is the llead. His associates are mostly
Chicago capitalists and they have sub
scribed $1,500,000 to assist German
fa-iners to establish themselves in
North Dakota. Their plan is to deed a
quarter section of land to each settler,
build a comfortable dwelling and thor
oughly equip the farm with live stock
and machinery, allowing the emigrant
t) pay for it from the proceeds of his
crops in moderate annual installments.
So far about 750 sturdy Ger
mans of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana,
Ohio and Pennsylvania have signed
agreements to join Colonel Towner's
colony next spring. The land which
has been selected by the company em
braces great deal of the most fertile
roil in the state, as well as many good
|:ock ranges. The country is well sup
plied with streams of fresh water and
hus vast natural hay meadows. The
scheme is taking Xiko wild Are and not
iesN than 1,000 families will take ad
vantage of the offer. North Dakota
people in the capital pronounce the
scheme unit of the most feasible that
they Imve aver known for populating the
frontier. Among the leading inemlmr«

Of the men at work beneath tlie wall
at the time it fell eight were taken o-.iv
dead and seven badly injured.
Removing tlie Dead and Injured.
Immediately after the accident, oc
curred all the patrol wagons in the city
were summoned, and Chief Clark, wi:h
Chief Jackson and Assistant Chief fiar
tin, made an attempt to organize the
laborers who were net under the wall
and get them to work.
The men were wild with excitem: if.
however, and it was a long time he'o.v
more than half a dozen could be ind o.-ed
to go to work. The others ran bae'e and
forth around the building shouting to
each other and uttering imp ec:it:..i
against the contractors, or stood j,-a/.in
blankly at tlie ruin.
Tlie group that went to work iu less
than half an hour had taken out ten
men,
Five of Whom Were Killed,
and live injured, one so severely that
the physicians on the ground
that he could not live until lie reached
the hospital. By this time a larger
gang had been put to work and tile
work of removing the debris w-.-nt on
rapidly. Finally the contractor, Wil
cox, was taken out dead and ma:.gieu
beyond recognition, his head appar
ently mashed to a pulp.
Tlie wounded were taken to the city

limbs being visible. His head and body
appeared to be crushed out of all shape.
There were men wich all their limbs

Cause of the Accident.
Tlie cause of the accident, as near us
can be learned, is that the wall, which
was much weakened by the fire, became
top heavy from the large amount of
debris removed from the bottom, and
fell over of its own weight. For some
time it has been considered dangerous
by people who frequented the place, but
the contractors, who examined it, pro
nounced the wall sound and the men
continued to work without fear of acci
dent.
The wall had appeared firm and gave
no sign )f weakening up to the time ot
the fall, when it came down iu a heap
without a second's warning. The ex
cavations about the base have been car
ried on very rapidly and the greater
part of the debris had been removed.
