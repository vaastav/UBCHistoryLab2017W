A remarkable review of American poll:
tic, sard to have emanated from a
high professor at Harvard university
and which- has lust appeared la a
radical paper over the initials, "H. W
B. M.," is creating oonsiderale attea.
(Ion and furnishing abundant material
for tbe essayist! and editorial writers
The writer says that a crisis is taking
place tbat is . bringing the United
States into line wltn other parts of the
English-speaking world. 1 "The wirk.
ing men are slowly becoming con
vinced tbat tb republican and demo-
praliq parties, representing respective
ly the northern manufioturers and the
aristocratio southern planters, -oare not
one jut for their welfare Further
more, tbat tbe third great , American
political party, tbe populist, wblob
claims to represent tbe interests of tbe
people at large and to De Opposed
briberv and corruption in which tbe
older parties are steeped, is aoting the
part of a "gay deot-lvef" when It en
deavors to represent -itself as a labor
piny, it Has, in tact, oecome imea
with tbe so-oalled fdemoorats over lie
silver question, Tind no distinct labor
planks appear in the platform wnicn
they have adopted." .- - '
The professor is of tbe opinion tnat
I be socialist labor party is working its
wav to tbe front as the party which
really has reform at heart. In con
elusion, be believes in the future there
could be liitle doubt that all the
branches of plutocracy would merge
into one republican party, and all the
branches of tbe democracy, except the
gentleman farmers of tbe west, into
one labor party, if it were not for the
oourse tbe aucitllst labor party have
taken in demandirg, as an absolute
condition of membership, an aanasion
to tbe doctrines of collectivism, There
are many bona nde labor men woo
cannot, as yet, assimilate this doctrine
owing to tha economic regime wbioh i
advocates being so very unlike anything
to which they bave been accustomed
