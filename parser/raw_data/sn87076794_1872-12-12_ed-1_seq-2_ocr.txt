The "Liberal" Presidential Electors
of Tennessee and Maryland, cust their
votes for Governor llendricka. That
was liberal Indeed. Those of Georgia
divided the vote between Horace
Greeley, Gratz Brown, and Charles
Jenkins, of Georgia.
General Grant has be& accorded
the Degree of Doctor of Laws by Har
vard Unl"erslty. There is considera
ble humbug about this matter of con
ferring degrees and we confess being
unable to tell why they are given to
those not entitled to them.
The people of Fremont voted aid to
the L. E. 4 L. R. R. on Tuesday of
last week. The vote stood in the city
and township, yes 873; no, 51. The
McMtenger opposed the measure and
the Journal advocated it As a rule
it does not pay to oppose public im
provements. The Cincinnati Commercial contin
ue, to congratulate itself upon the
fact that Sumner and Sohurz are
great men. Considering that that is
all the consolation that extremely
"Independent" Journal can find In
the Liberal movement we gracefully
submit to Its good feeling.
It baa been reported that Harper A
Brothers are discussing a project for
purchasing the Tribune and making
Geo. Wm. Curtis editor-in-chief, and
it Is understood that they are ready to
offer $1,000,000 for the establishment
as It now stands. The last sale of
stock In the Tribune was on an esti
mated value of $1,100,000, and shares
are still held at that figure.
The Boston Relief Committee esti
mate that not less than $150,000 fur
ther will be required to afford relief
that will be needed to sufferers by the
fire, Independently of the special fund
for firemen. Of this sum, they have
$30,000, which will be exhausted in
ten or twelye days, and the $100,000
more they hope to raise in Boston,
without appealing for aid to other
cities.
Some of the Democratic papers are
growling because the Senate does not
see fit to continue at the head of its
Committees Liberal Senators. It
would be just as proper for them to
insist that old line Democrats should
have these places, for the Literals
worked as faithfully to defeat the Re
publican party and Republican Con
gressmen as did the Democracy and
are therefore entitled to just as much
consideration.
Aa a matter of "conciliation," Gen.
Banks was continued at the head of a
House committee, after be bad ten
dered his resignation. His head ought
to have been cut off "quicker than
chain lightning," and some one in
vested with the position who was not
a renegade. Refusing this resig
nation was called a "graceful act,"
by some milk-and-water correspond
ent We don't like that kind of
grace.- Banks visited this District to
make speeches, at the special Invita
tion of the Democracy and Rush R.
Sioane, for the sole purpose of defeat
ing the Hon. Charles Foster. Was
that a "graceful act ?"
Asarpecimen of political dodging,
the offer of the Democratic Senators
to withdraw one of their number
from the Committee on Foreign Rela
tions and replace him with Carl
Schurz can not" be excelled. Schurz
refused on high moral grounds, and
the Democrats insisted on principles
equally as grand and Schurz took the
position. Bjth claim that there is no
surrender of principle in the act. and
the poor iunocents out of the ring
must believe that the movement was
made and the correspondence bad for
the purpose of keeping up the idea
that while Schurz acts with the De
mocracy be does so aa a Republican,
with the purpose of Injuring the par
ty that the Democrats accept of him
ti strengthen themselves.
;
This is Sumner's first "Liberal"
movement upon the reassembling of
Congress :
"Whereas, National unity and
gxd will among fellow-citizens can
be assured only through oblivion of
past differences, and It is contrary to
the usage of civilized nations to per
petuate the memory of civil war;
therefore, be it enacted, etc., that the
names of battles with our fellow-citi-r.ena
shall not be continued in the
army register, or placed on the regi
mental colors of the United States."
This resolution may suit Sumner's
"new light" ideas, but we presume
that the soldiers that took part in
the war will not approve of it
Tbeir bravery and suwss are worthy
of lasting recognltion.while the lesson
taught to rebels should not be wiped

[From the New York Times.] The Age of Public Men.
Mr. Greeley was much " younger
than many men whose names'are as
sociated with bis own in American
political history, or who have been on
tbe stage of public life during the
whole or a portion of bis career. Mr.
Seward lived to the age of seventy
one, and Mr. Thurlow Weed till lives
at the age of seventy-five, Mr. Web
ster was seventy when be died, and
Henry Clay, to whom Mr. Greeley
was devotedly attached, was seventy
five. "Old Ben. Wade" enjoys very
fair health at the age of seventy-two
Mr. Chase is sixty-four, and Mr. Sum
ner is only Mr. Greeley's age. The
late James Gordon Bennett was seventy-one
when he died, and Martin
Van Buren was eighty. The newly
elected Governor of New York is old
er than Mr. Greeley by thirteen years.
If we lock to other countries, and
turn to tbe men who have led very
active and hardworking lives, we find
the comparison equally striking. Mr.
Thiers is aeventy-ive. Lord Broug
ham lived to the age of ninety-three
no doubt an exceptional instance;
but the present Premier of England,
Mr. Gladstone, is sixty-three, and his
great opponent Mr. Disraeli, is aixty
eeven, six year. Mr. Greeley's senior.
Palmers ton lived to tbe ace of nirhtv.
one, and the present Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Robert Lowe, is only Mr.
Greeley's age, and is expected to do a
great deal of bard night work, to say
nothing of bis inoeseant attention to
offiM doties doriag tha day.

The Cost of British Royalty.
The Blue Book, containing
"finance accounts" of the British gov
ernment for 1S71-2, shows that ex
cluding the civil list, which amounts
to 406,233 17s. 9d., the grants to the
royal family show a total of 125,986
8s. lid. The odd figures in this total,
which will at once arrest attention,
are explained by the circumstance
that in the past financial year only
a portion of tbe allowances made
Princess Louise and Prince Arthur fell
due. The grant to the former is tf,
K), and to the latter 15,000 a year.
The Crown Princess of Prussia takes
8,000; the Princess Alice, 6,o00
the Prince of Wales, 40,000; the
Princess of Wales, 10,000 ; the Duke
of Edinburgh, 15,00; the Princess
Christian, 0,000 ; the Duchess
Mecklenburg Strelitz (daughter of the
Duchess of Cambridge), 3,000; the
Ddke of Cambridge, 12,000 (apart,
course, from his military pay), and
the Duchess of Teck, 5,000. There
are four ex-Chancellors Lords St
Leonards, Chelmsford, Westbury, and
Cairns who each draw 5,000 a year.
The political pensions are very few.
Under this bead only four annuities
of the first class (2,000) are permitted
to run at one time. This class is full,
and the two parties divide the spoil
equally between them. Tbe annui
tants are Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Walpole,
Sir George Grey, and Mr. Milner Gib
son. It may be noted that the pen
sions for naval and military services
charged on tbe consolidated fund
amount to 38,000 a year. The repre
sentatives of Lord Rodney receive
2,000 ; the representatives of Lord
Nelson, 5,000; and tbe represen
tatives of Lord Amherst 3,000.
These are perpetual, tb others are for
one or more lives. The hereditary
pension, of the old type are now re
duced to four tbe heirs and descend
ants of Wm. Penn, 4,000 ; the Duke
of Marlborough, 1,000; the heirs of
the Duke of Scbomberjr, 2,160; and
Lord Bath, 1,200. Annuitants are
proverbially long lived, and bere is
curious case in point : "Mary Ann
Foster (now Tomes), late housemaid
House of Lords, Ireland, for loss of
emoluments by the Union," 18 Os.

The quarterly session of the Seneca
Educational Association, held at Nor
mal Hall last Friday evening and
Saturday, was well attended by citi
zens, teachers, and students, undani
mated discussions took place on a
variety of topics in connection with
the subject of schoolB and school man
agement. The next meeting will be
held on the flrat Saturday in March.
The Union Schools opened ii Mon

In the Higher department, au J Miss
Alice E. Hillin the Primary depart
ment.
With reference to the Secondary
department there is considerable of a
muddle upon which we do not pur
pose to comment except to briefly
state the facts. Four members of the
Board of Education decided to employ
Wm. H. Bailey to teach in that de
partment. He was examined by the
local examiners, and found reasona
bly well qualified as to mental quali
fications, but a remonstrance signed
by a large number of citizens, made
representations derogatory to his mor
al character, which, with bis conduct
and language in the presence of the
examiners, induced them to reject his
application. Thecontroling majority
of the School Board first proposed toj
appoint new examiners, but at a sub
sequent meeting repolved to put Mr.
Bailey in the echool under tbe Coun
ty Examiners' Certificate, .which was
done ou Monday morning. A meet
ing of citizens, largely attended, was
held at the Town Hall on Monday
evening. A committee consisting of
Philip Griffin, Geo. Karshner, aud
J. II. Knapp was appointed to make
application to the court for an injunc
tion, jestraining the Board from em
ploying Mr. Bailey. A petition to
tbe County Examiners,askingtbat the
certificate granted by them be revoked,
has been extensively signed.' There
is considerable feeling on the:
subject, but we hope it will work out i
to the best interests of the school.

We are using yonr Ferguson's Wonderful
Oil upon the borsosln our stable sick with
the horse disease. We commenced with oar
horse as soon as they were taken, by ap
plying the Oil to their throats and necks,
ruobiug it in well as yon direct. We find
that It relieves the soreness and Inflamma
tion of the throat and relieves the cough.
Our hors-s began to improve almost lmme
dlately after tbe application of the Oil. I
miit say that It gives relief sooner than an)
medicine I have swen nsed for this disease.
We have about 140 horses In our stables.near
Iv all sick, and have used nothing else upon
them but Ferguson's Wonderful oil, and
every horse Is rapidly Improving. We can
confidently recommend It as a valuable

Hair Vigor
For restoring to Gray Hair its
natural Vitality and Color.
A tlressins
which is at
onco agreea
ble, health-,
i
for prcserv
5ing tho hair.
yijftlt soon re
istorcs Jaded
yy or aray hair
to its original
color, with the gloss and freshness of
youth. Thin hair is thickened, fall
ing hair checked, and baldness often,
though not always, cured by its
use. Nothing can restore the hair
where tho follicles are destroyed, or
tho glands atrophied and decayed ;
but such as remain can be saved by
this application, and stimulated into
activity, so that a. new growth of
hair is produced. Instead of foulin g
tho hair with a pasty sediment, it
will keep it clean and vigorous. Its
occasional uso will present tho-hair "
from turning gray or tailing off,
and consequently prevent baldness.
The restoration of vitality it gives
to the Bcalp arrests and prevents
the formation of dandruff which is
often so uncleanly and offensive.
Free from thoso deleterious sub
stances which mako some prepara
tions dangerous, and injurious to tho
hair, the Vigor can only benefit, but
not harm it. If wanted merely for
a HAIR DRESSING, nothing elso
can be found so desirable. Contain
ing neither oil nor dye, it does not
soil white cambric, and yet lasts
long on the hair, giving it a rich,
glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume.
