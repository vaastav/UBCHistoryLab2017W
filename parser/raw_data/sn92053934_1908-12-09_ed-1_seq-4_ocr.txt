Doom of the "Comics"
It begins to look as if the death
knell of the time-honored feature of
American journalism the comic sup
plements of the Sunday newspapers
had struck. A tide of protest is rising
all over the land, and the very exist
ence of "Foxy Grandpa," the "Katzen
jammer Kids," "Happy Hooligan," and
"Buster Brown" those darlings of the
heart of childhood is menaced, says
Current Literature. Mothers meetings
have declaimed and educational' con
ferences have resolved against them.
One lady speaker before the recent
American Playgrounds congress in
New York registered her conviction
that the comic supplement is "debas
ing the morals of the children" by em
phasizing and apparently condoning
"deceit, cunning and disrespect for
gray hairs."

Airships and War.
In addressing the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers several army
officers have just given their views re
garding the value of aeroplanes and
dirigible balloons as adjuncts of war
fare. That their belief in the utility
of these devices for campaign pur
poses after they shall have been more
fully developed is shared by their
superiors at Washington, is asked from
congress for the perfecting of war ma
chines that can navigate the air.
Yet a good many people who are not
to ne ranked with tne peace at any
price advocates will be apt to regret
the apparent assumption that the first
if not the chief use, to which these fly
ing fabrics are apparently to be de
voted is connected with warfare in
the minds of those who are most zeal
ous in urging governmental tests for
them.
bucn a policy might seem more
rational among officials of Europe,
where nationalities are closely packed
together, with the ever present dread
of invasion which causes ships and
forts and armies always to be kept
ready for immediate action. But three
thousand miles of ocean separates this
country from England and the conti
nent. No person in his senses looks
for a descent of foreign troops on the
United States and even the most op
timistic inventor probably would hesi
tate to predict the creation of an air
ship that can cross the Atlantic. If
the secret of successful navigation can
be mastered for purposes of commerce
or of pleasure over the wide expanse
of this republic, it will constitute
notable step in human progress. But
the possibility of such an achievement
surely deserves consideration apart
from the added facilities for slaughter
and destruction which it might imply

confident opportunists, calling them
selves the republican party, and quite
equal to the commercial exigencies of

MISS KILROY INVESTIGATES -BY TROY ALLISON.
Copyrighted, 1908, by Associated Literary Press.
Santa Claus and the Postoffice. It is
a long way from St. Nicholas of Myra,
patron saint of children, the prototype
of Christmas giving, to Dutch Santa
Claus and German Kris Kringle
(Christ Klndlcin). but with all the
changing forms that time and place
have imposed there has clung about
the children's saint a sweet unreason
ableness, a benignant generosity that
has kindled many imaginations and
brought the invigoration of fine anti
cipation. With the privilege granted
last year by the United States post-
office to charitable agencies to receive
on application letters addressed to
Santa Claus there did seem to threaten
a method of treating the Santa Claus
legend that would work its destruc
tion. What seemed to characterize the
newspaper accounts of the letters, and
what was reflected in the letters them
selves, was a commingling of sensa
tionalism, pathos and lack of uumor.
A sense of proportion seemed forfeited.
Children were represented as being in
alarming numbers fatherless, and,
paradoxical as it may seem, fathers, in
alarming numbers, were assumed to be
indifferent to and incapable of taking
any part in the providing of Christmas
cheer for their children. A carnival of
gloom was the impression we got from
reading some of the newspaper state
ments. We should begirj to despair
of the power of Santa Claus to survive
the killing kindness of emotional giv
ing if it were not for our belief with
G. K. Chesterton that "Santa Claus is
an actor who can always have 'a posi
tively last appearance' with advantage
to himself because people really want
him." Mary Willcox Glenn in the De
cember Charities and The Commons.
and more an object of desire. We may
multiply laws and detective agencies,
and build jails, and bar our windows
and double-bolt our doors. and
strengthen our castle walls, but the
treasure within cries out more appeal
ing, "Come and take me."
It has been said, and truly, "You
cannot make men honest by act of
congress." That is to say, social or
ganisms have in themselves no reform
ing power. Every man's character
determined by his own individual
choice. He may be honest, or be
thief, as pleases him.
But organized society, which is an
other, name for government, may mul
tiply, or it may remove temptations,
and according as it does one or the
other will the crime increase or di
minish. We do not affirm that the law
is directly increasing the temptation,
but we do affirm that the social or
ganism, under the form of the law and
with its sanction is pushing that way
with relentless energy. Otherwise how
do we account for the increase " of
crimes that directly concern the poss
ession of money The daily papers
and the court records bear testimony.
A remedy must be sought that will
touch the cause.
It is the orthodox thing to de
nounce socialism, and every- thing that
looks like it as the sum of all wicked
ness. But in a state organized on a
socialistic basis, the possession of
money is an affair of no particular im
portance. A man can use only about
so mucn oi u. ana as it is made or a
material that has no intrinsic value,
he cannot send it over to Europe, and
afterwards retire thither and squander
it. Therefore, it will be no object to
loot the bank, cither to the profess
ional cracksman outside, or to the
trusted official and employe within.
There may be just as many rogues un
hung as now, but if their roguery pro
fits them nothing they will be likely
soon to turn their attention In some
other direction.
Let us give the devil his due.
Socialism may be as black as it has
been painted, but this is one redeem
ing feature. When we have exhausted
our resources along the lines now on
trial we may think it worth while to
consider some other plan.

PERT PARAGRAPHS.
The worst thing about a cold is the
sympathy and the advice and the ama
teur pollices that it invites.
So many people are trying to save
the world much to the world's disad
vantage and to the great grief of their
own fortunes.
If the average man were to receive
the salary that his conceit desires he
would be so busy spending It that he
would have no time to hold his job.
Wraith Is both elusive and delusive
when you 'are in pursuit of It, but
quite and entirely conclusive when you
succeed In harpooning It.
A man likes well enough to stare at
every girl he meets, but he thinks It is
a shame that his wife should imagine
that he would do such a thing.
It Is astonishing how quickly we for

our last winter's overcoats.
A thick hide and a brass nerve often
succeed in the world. There should
be some recompense to the possessor j her one room
of these monstrosities.
To the casual observer Miss Kilroy '
did not seem exactly fitted for-an in
vestigator of soc iological problems. The
government had probably been prompt
ed by some wise head when it appoint
ed wom.-Mi to that branch of work.
Formerly when men, important in
uniforms and brass buttons, or men in
plain clothes, augmented by much pom
posity, had made the rounds of the for
eign settlements such dignity had
frightened or embarrassed the women
and children to such an extent that It
was an impossibility to obtain freely
spokeu opinions as to what they liked
in America, what they did not like,
what they expected Uncle Sam to do
for them or what they themselves could
offer as a just reason for Uncle Sam
doing anything at all for them.
Nobody, however, could possibly take
fright at pretty Miss Kilroy, who.
dressed in the nobbiest white shirt
waist suit, a rather gay ribbon on her
hat, knocked at the humblest door of
the humblest tenements and generally
found a welcome.
Grantley, in charge of the temporary
quarters provided while the investiga
tion was being carried on in this city,
looked up as she entered the office in
the afternoon, tired, but jubilant
'Seems to me I have secured enough
Information today to make a complete
report upon the sociological problem In
America," she said, throwing her notes
upon her desk.
Good work," he answered, wonder
ing why she ever undertook such a job.
"It's strange that the youngest, master"
"Oh, don't mind me! Go on and say

haired that one wouldn't suspect her

it is that she beats the others all hol
low wrben it comes to turning in the
results from a day's labor. Would yon
mind telling me about your methods of
procedure, Miss Kilroy?" Grantley was
clearly interested in knowing how she
did it
Miss Kilroy laughed . somewhat
shamefacedly. "I'm afraid I'm not
really businesslike," she admitted, "but
I proceed upon an instinctive knowl
edge of human nature. Today I went
to interview a great big Irishwoman.
When she came to the door and saw
me, notebook in hand, she positively
glared. There certainly wain't a glim
mer of hospitality In her face. 'What
would the likes av ye be afther want
in?' she demanded.
"When I reeled off my set of ques
tions her indiguation Increased. 'How
long have I bin In America an' what
av the wurrik I have done? Faith, an
think it impudence for a yellow hair
ed chit of a guircl who Ivldently spends
her time dressing up an wearing blue
ribbons on her hat to come an' call an
honest woman from her wurrik to ask
questions about her private family.
Ye might as well be afther taking ye-
stlf oil. Bridget Magulre don't answer 1
no fool questions."
I believe, Mr. Grantley, that if she
hadn't been so scathing about my blue
hatband I would have walked off and
abandoned the Interview, but that hat
band and the "yellow haired chit of a
gurrel' had to be avenged.
"I leaned against her door dejected
ly, tried to turn pale and said: 'You
mustn't think I want to do It for I so
hate to be rude, but I have to do It for
my living. I'm so tired and so warm'
leaning against the door with an atti
tude indicating an early approach of
tears 'and If I don't find out things for
them they will dismiss me and I'll have
nothing to live on.'
"Mrs. Magulre's bark was fiercer than
her bite. Her face changed, she took
hold of my arm gently and led me into
le poor little cray
fav right off. nn you 11 soon be bet-
ther.'"
Miss Kilroy waved her notes payly.
"I folt somewhat hypocritical, but 1
have fitted her into the proper place in
the sociological report."
Her chief smiled approval. "It takes
a woman to boat all. ne saiu. uoni
you ever meet with more serious an
noyances ?'
The girl blushed. "Sometimes the
men stare at me a little more than 1
like. There is a party of Syrians in
Jing's court. One of them is a fine
specimeu. He was dressed In beaded
jackets aud er things aud bad a red
sash and a red fez or something fan
tastic on his raveu locks. He would in
spire an artist to paint a "Son of the
Desert or a "Type From the Orient' I
have had several interviews with him,
bei-ause be speaks less fractured Eug-
lish than the others, and yesterday he
insisted upon presenting me with a
string of red glass beads. He well,
he was slightly effusive and called me
n maid of tiie dawn whose hair was
kissed by ' the rising sun. I decided
that I "wouldn't interview him any
more. He seemed Inclined to be Impulsive.'
Grantley chuckled. "Good thing you
have closed the episode. The next
chapter might have disclosed the or!
ental son of n gun desert bearing away
upon a flying steed the maid of the
dawn, who struggled and protested
tnat sne preferred Auii'nuas ana tneir

tional complications by abducting you.
Even as it is, he may spot your win
dow ledge aud twang a guitar or a
zither, or whatever it U that Syrians
do twang. He may cause you to lose a
whole night's sleep."
Miss Kilroy commenced transcribing
her notes tranquilly. "He's relegated
to the past," she declared airily. "His
song Is sung."
The elevator boy stuck his head
through the doorway. "There arc two
queer lookiug females, fixed up in some
kind of foreign trappings, that want to
see Miss Kilroy," he announced.
"Show tbem in. Tommy that is. If
you don't mind, Mr. Grantley." She
looked at him inquiringly.
"Not at all. I will stop Sato the ad

Mis Kiircy smiied wten h-r visitors

and your pretty daughter."
The old womaa smile-l and nodded
until Ler ear pendants jltgled. "We
come see maiden like dawn, she an
nounced genially.
Miss Kilroy remembered the origin
of the compliment and had the grace
to blush. "Did . you come to tell me
some more about your beautiful coun
try :" she asked graciously.
The woman shook her head. "Come
to tell-a you of my son," she beamed.
Has he succeeded in getting a posi
tion?" interestedly.
No, not on the work we come, is it
Ilareede?" Sue appealed to her daugh
ter delightedly.
The girl's black eyes glowed with im
portance. "We we women it Is al
ways so," she explained Ingratiatingly,
"it is for tis to tell the fair one that
sh3 is beloved"
"An yon marry my son yes?" broke
in the mother eagerly..
Miss Kilroy sank back In her chair
weakly. "Of nil things" she gasfd.
"You like-a my son?" urged Zuiieka,
leaning over and patting caressingly,
the limp hand of the object of her son's
affection. ' ;
Miss Kilroy looked dazed. "I I can't
marry your son," she announced feebly.
"But my son my son! He like-a you,
he marry you. The .way you smile
make him happy." I ask you to marry
my son!" her gestures expressing a fer
vent solicitude that exceeded her vo
cabulary. "But I don't want to marry your son.
I hate your son!" declared Miss Kil
roy desperately. "
The eyes of the two matrimonial
agents flashed aud their voices rose an
grily. Miss Kilroy put her blond head
upon the desk and sobbed. Grantley
considered this an auspicious moment
for interference. He rose and spoke
blandly to the mother, who stood pant
ing with indignation at the slight to
her offspring.
"It is perhaps lest for me td explain
the situation, madam." and he bowed
low in a manner which he hoped would
impress them with an idea that he had
learned his manners in foreign court
circles. "It Is not that Miss Kilroy
