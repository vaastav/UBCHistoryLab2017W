ADVERTISING IOWA.
Instead of making an appeal to the
railroads to cease presenting in Iowa
alluring. advertisements of lands and
opportunities in other parts of the
country, which is said to be one of
the.plans of the Greater Des Moines
committee, the Davenport Tim&s be
lieves it would be more practical to
propose to the railroads that they
change their advertising so as to give
greater publicity to Iowa, to its agri
cultural and manufacturing opportuni
ties. If, says the Times, the north
west Btates prove attractive to so
•many Iowans as a result of the rail
way advertising that is distributed,
why is It not fair to assume that if
the railways will in a similar way ad
vertise Iowa in the states farther east
of here, Iowa may be built up more
rapidly? The Times asks why, for in
stance, should not the people of Penn
sylvania and New York be told of 1he
productiveness of Iowa soil, of the op
portunities for factories, of the numer
ous water power sites, the cheap coal
and the transportation facilities in
Iowa.

James S. Clarkson, the former Iowan,
had been asked to remain at his post
until the expiration of his full term

to retire at once. The Philadelphia
paper points out that crime and

THE 500 CLUB.
The Booster committee of the Com
mercial association has completed
plans for a whirlwind one-day cam
paign by which It is expected to bring
the membership of that organization
up to 500. Tomorrow the committees
wil] make their final effort. They are
ready for the campaign and all they
ask. of the prospective members is to
be ready for them.
By adding about 250 new members
to the Commercial association the
Boosters have done a great work. But
they will not feel that their work is
completed until the association has 500
enthusiastic members, organized to
gether to further Ottumwa's interests.
The other cities in the state have
been watching 'Ottumwa. They have
applauded the spirit of prpgressive
ness made manifest by the success of
the Commercial association member
ship campaign. They will watch the
result of this closing day's campaign,
to see whether the 500 goal is reached,
and Ottumwa must make good.
The 500 mark must be reached to
morrow. Then those 500 members
must be made 500 workers.
President Taft states that his view
of the good roads question is that it
is chiefly a State function, and that
the states ought to unite in an effort
to promote good: roads. The federal
government, however, could render
great assistance in the work. In
arguing for the promotion of a national
department of health in his message,
President Taft pointed to the great
work done by the department of agri
culture, although its functions were
practically the same in a national way
as the state agricultural boards were
to the state. The government could
render-the same aid to the state road
builders as the department of agri
culture renders to the state agri
Cultural organizations.

charges of crime have permeated the
New York custom house, but in all
the mess not a suspicion has rested
upon the administration of Mr. Clark
son as surveyor of the port. Under
such circumstances it feels that it
would be wise to keep Mr. Clarkson
just where he is until such time as
he shall decline longer to serve. The
Inquirer calls attention to the fact
that Clarkson has piloted the
Republican party as its national
chairman, has administered the affairs
of the postofllce department as first
assistant postmaster general, and that
his executive abilities have been such
that he has filled the office of the sur
veyor of the port of New York with
credit. While great ado is being made
over the necessity of, making the New
York custom house a thoroughly busi
ness concern, the Inquirer asks why
Clarkson should be disturbed at all.
A glance at the down town streets
shows that the only thing that can
be done just now is to clear off the top
crust. The freezing weather and
heavy traffic on the streets have
solidified the lower strata until it
would be impossible to reach bed
rock with a pick. After the first thaw,
however, it will be possible. to clean
off the streets and the opportunity
should not be permitted to pass. In the
future when there is a heavy snow fall,
the snow should be taken off before it
has had a chance to pack in the
streets. There is no sensible reason
why the streets should be paved, if
the paving is allowed to be buried un
der snow and ice during the winter
months.
Back in the early days some of the
pioneers wanted to call this city "Ot
tumwanock." More progressive of the
pioneers, however, objected to that
"nock," and they won the day. So you
see that even back there in the spring
of '43 they wouldn't stand for a
"knock" on Ottumwa. If those pio
neers who knocked the "nock" off Ot
.umwa were alive today they would be
the leaders in the campaign to in
crease the Commercial association's
membership to the 500 mark.
John W. Gates, the financial mag
nate, who has figured in enough deals
to know what he is talking about says
that "a mine that has gold or silver
and is worth $1,000,000 can raise all
the money needed for development in
five minutes without having to appeal
to the working man to buy stock."
The best stock Ottumwans can buy
now is stock in the Boost Ottumwa
organizations. It costs $10 a share
and it promises greater returns than
any other investment that could be
made.
It is probable that the Commercial
association boosters were unable to
see all the prospective members they
were looking for in their closing day's
campaign today. All such persons,
however, may have their names
placed on the rolls of the Commercial
association by telephoning the secre
tary or by sending their application in
by mail.

Fame a Funny Thing
Washington Bureau of
The Ot.tumwa Courier,
Washington, D. C., Dec. 16.
The late Richard Watson Gilder,
editor, poet, biographer of Grover
Cleveland and all-round literary man,
had a particularly good story on him
self, which he didn't often tell, but
which his friends were wont to tell
for him.
A younger brother of the noted
literary man became a newspaper
worker, and drifted west. He main
tained very little touch with his fam
ily in the east, and settled down to a
modest career in a Nebraska town,
working on a daily paper. There he
developed a whimsical interest in
Indian mounds and relics, and spent
his spare time digging into mounds.
One day he dug up some remarkable
bones, put them together, and figured
out that lie had a prehistoric man's
skeleton. It was widely written about
within a limited circle of high-browed
scientists, and "Bob" Gilder became
famous as a scientist, in the view of
about two men at every university in
the world. Outside that little circle
he was utterly unknown. His disting
uished brother had never even heard
of his fame.
Traveling in Italy a few years ago,
Richard Watson Gilder called on a
famous savant, and sent in his card.
The great Italian precently received
him.
"I am more than delighted," he
said, "for I feel that you have done
me peculiar honor to call. I have long
wished for opportunity to talk with
you personally about your great
work."
Mr. Gilder bowed his acknowledge
ments.
"I am at. your service, be assured,
in any possible manner," he announc
ed. The savant was more delighted
than ever.
"I shall then feel perfectly free,"
pursued the enthusiastic Italian, "to
ask you about the articulation of the
I l'emur and tibia in your man.
fl believe that is the very crux of this
entire matter."
Mr. Gilder wondered-ii his host was
crazy. "Really," ho said, "I fear there
must be some mistake. I am not
familiar with the articulation of the
femur and tibia, and don't enjoy the
acquaintance of the Loess man."
The savant took another iook at the
card,' of his' visitor.
"Ah," he admitted with some cool
ness, "I see I have erred. You are
not Mr. Robert W. Gilder, the great
American scientist, as I had supposed.

Shaw on the Central Bank
Paragraphs from address before the
manufacturers at Indianapolis: "There
is one other objection which appeals
to me as very serious. Who is to own
this central bank, and who shall con
trol it? If it is to be at allanalogous
to the Central banks of other coun
tries, it must be a corporation, the
shares of stock in which will be held
by individuals or corporations and
regualarly transferable and subject
to representation at stockholders'
meetings by proxies. I do not think
there can be any doubt in the mind of
any one who studies the question in
the light of admitted conditions, that
if a central bank is established in this
country, it will be owned, or at least
controlled, by the Standard Oil com
pany.
"There are two diseases prevalent
in this country,, either of which is
liable to prove fatal. One is Wall
street-mania, and the other Wall
street-fobia. I do not think that I have
been sadly inoculated with either, but
I am frank to say that it seems to me
quite unamerican to place with any
group of men the power to contract
or expand our currency at will and
to grant or withhold credit to any
bank, to any merchant and to any
corporation at pleasure. It was charg
ed, and as vigorously denied, that the
affliated banks of New York during
the panic of 1907 simply withdrew
credit from the group of men who con
trolled the Tennessee Coal and Iron,
called their loans, and finally adjust
ed the matter by taking over the prop
erty at a fraction of its admitted
value, upwards of $500,000,000,, and
paid .for it in United States Steel
securities, without the exchange of a
dollar in money! Assuming the charge
to be libelous, it still illustrates what
could be done were a group of men
possessing the requisite disposition to
be in control of the central bank. Of
a set of New Year resolutions given
out some years ago by Josh Billings,
I remember but one: 'Resolved
That if a man tells me a mule won't
kick, I'll believe him, but I won't go
near the mule.'
"But, lest it be charged that I am
apepaling to popular prejudice, I am
willing to go on record that if we are
to have a Central bank I shall wel
come control by the Standard Oil com
pany or by the United States Steel
corporation, though preferably by both
combined. This is not based on per
sonal friendship, though some measure
"of personal friendship, I hope, exists,
but it is based wholly on the question
of fitness for the task.
"At the risk of being criticised, I am
going to inject a few statements in
commendation of the Standard Oil
people. They rendered by all odds,
the' greatest service of any institution
or any group of people during the
panic of 1907. From October of that
year until Jan. 15 following the Na
tional City bank of New York finan
ced exports of cotton, grain, metals,
and other commodities to the extent
of $250,000,000. If any other institu
tion in the United States- financed a
million in exports during that time, I
shall be glad to know its name.
"It is difficult to over-estimate the
value of this service. These exports
liquidated our foreign bills and paid
for the gold we imported. In addition
to all this without calling a loan, the
same bank granted assistance to in
dividual, firms and corporations to the
extent of $40,000,000. This is a won
derful record, and it must be taken
into the account in considering this
great subject. Capacity to do these
gigantic things and to render these
herculean services is an essential
consideration in the argument in favor
of a central bank. I do not" believe,
however, that it is wise to place a
financial control of the business of the
country in the hands of any one group
of men, and some group of men is
sure to control such a bank if one is
established. As between groups dif
ferent people will have different prefer
ences. I have expressed mine. Cen
tralization of financial power in any
such degree is wholly unnecessary and
to me most repugnant. I will go
further in my judgment any party
which fastens centralized financial
power upon thlB country will never
carry another election, if, indeed, It
ever makes another nomination.
I thoroughly believe, however, that
the Standard Oil company and the
United states Steel corporation coulcr
afford to pay the nationa 1 debt for
such a charter, and I say this inde
pendent of whether such a bank would
be independently profitable or other
wise. The control of it would be
valuable beyond the power of man
to conceive to any group of men who
had independent financial interests
large'enough to justify it and the
ability necessary for its operation.
"We all remember that the control
6t a certain life insurance company
with a capital of only $200,000, sold a
few years ago for $9,000,000 when the
maximum dividend was fixed in the
charter to 7 per cent or $14,000. Cer
tainly that vast sum was not invested
expecting returns of only $14,000 per
annum when the same amount in gov
ernment. bonds, even, would yield
$180,000. No, the company had assets
approximating $500,0000,000, and the
control of such a volume of trust funds
if honest and wise, is very profitable.
It has recently changed hands again
and presumably at a yet higher price.
Taking the price paid for the con
trol of that life insurance company as
a measure of value, I do not think I
overstate the fact when I say that the
two largest corporations in the world,
interested as they are, directly or
through their affiliations in nearly
every line of business, and owning or
controlling probably in excess or one
hundred of our largest financial insti
tutions, with, I suppose, $2,000,000,000
in assets outside of their own capital
ization can afford to pay the national
debt for a perpetual charter for a cen
tral bank, safeguard the smaller in
terests as you may.
Possibly it will be suggested that
the national banks be required to pur
chase and hold the stock in the pro
posed central bank. But what of
that? Are they likely to combine for
the control of such an institution?
And if they did combine, what sort of
an incongruous control would' it be?
The actual control of such an institu
tion must rest somewhere, and it
would be a very easy task for either
of these great corporations, if the
other did not oppose, 'and easier still
for the two jointly to secure control,
although the stock were scattered one
share in a place. In fact, the more
widely the stock is scattered, the
easier could the control be obtained.
"Will it be proposed that the presi
dent appoint or congress elect the
board of governors for the bank?
When this is done you have made the
bank a political football, and have
not prevented actual control of the
men who are to control the bank.
a brother named Robert W. Gilder,"
replied the editor.
"Then," replied the scientist, ex
tending his hand. "I am indeed glad to
meeting you. To meet the brother of
the great Robert Gilder is indeed a
pleasure."
When Richard Watson Gilder had
gone away, much crestfallen, he look
ed up the. scientific attainments of his
brother and decided that fame is a
funny thing, anyhow.

A Christmas Celebration
By ELEANOR ALLYN.
A White Christmas.
A white Christmas is lovely and may
be made safe if the lighting is done by
electricity. To use much cotton where
there are children and candles is to in
vite disaster.
The tree should be placed against
a white or light background. A liberal
use of cotton, diamond dust and white
electric lights will suggest snow laden
branches. Gifts must, be wranpe'd in
white paper and tied either with white
ribbon or silver cord. Soft tissue paper
fringed and twisted into ropes can be
used to radiate from the top of the
tree, where is hung a silver and white
star, having a long trail of the silver
rain or glitter that comes in boxes.
The floor must be spread with a white
cloth, and among the gifts should be a
number of soft balls of cotton wrapped
in white satin ribbon to simulate snow
balls. If there are no candles or un
covered lights these make a delightful
game of snowballs which will delight:
t.he younger children. If the star is not
desired a large softly luminous moon
may be made of thin silver paper or
very pale yellow tissue paper having
an electric light behind it. This should
be a crescent moon and a lovely'lady
doll in long trailing garments may re
cline in it or a group of Teddy bears
will prove amusing. Long strings of
popcorn which has been sugared will
help the color scheme.
A Japanese Plan.
If this color scheme seems too dull
a gayer one may be arranged by a
Japanese plan.
Suspend an inverted Japanese um
brella from the gas jet over the dining
table. Inside it pile all the smaller
gifts, each one having a streamer of
ribbon running to the plate of the one
who is to receive it. Below it on the
table place a small twisted bit of pine
planted in a Japanese stoneware pot.
This is supposed to represent one of
the stunted trees of which Japan is so
proud. Around the base of the pot pile
all the larger gifts tied up in printed
Japanese napkins. If the tree is hard
to find two old wheels from a doll car
riage, several pieces of cardboard and
a little ingenuity may easily'make a
very respectable representation of a
Jin ricksha which will hold a goodly
number of gifts. If a small Japanese
doll is at each plate holding a scroll on
which is a stanza of the clever limer
icks that Americans are so apt at mak
ing, the effect will be all the prettier.
To draw the gifts one at a time from
the umbrella will delight the children.
The idea may be much amplified by
any one with the proper Christmas
spirit. All the members of the family
might wear the comfortable kirnonas
to breakfast. These may he part of
the Christmas giving. No more de
lightful surprise than one of these
pretty garments could be planned by
one skilled with the needle. The
many colored soft cotton crepes lend
themselves to this idea admirably,
while the shops are full of the more
expensive siken and embroidered
fabrics that appeal to the person with
a full purse. Care must be used to
select, becoming colors, as there is no
greater affliction to the average girl
than a garment that is .unbecoming,
but must be worn because It is a gift.

HARRIMAN'S INTIMATE FRIEND.
(Hartford Times.)
In the light of the last great fight, of
the late E. H. Harriman, which ended
in the ousting of Stuyvesant Fish from
control of the Illinois Central railroad
system, one laconic line in a life in
surance policy taken out by the rail
road king 30 years ago is a sad and
significant commentary. It was when
Harriman was worth many many dol
lars less than $149,000,000—quite be
fore either fame or fortune had come
his way, or the lure of power caught
and held him in its clutches.
In the application for this particular
policy, which was issued by a large
company not a thousand miles from
Hartford, among other questions was
asked the following:
"Who is your most intimate friend?"
In Harriman's own hand is written:
"Stuyvesant Fish."

Alabama Anti-Prohibition Vote.
Close on the heels of the announce

himself in the prohibition cause and
that he may make it a Democratic is
sue in the next national campaign,
comes the news of the rejection of a

seems to some observers to indicate
the "high-water mark" of the prohibi

it has been regarded by doctors as the

Do I Advertise?
We have spent years in the study and treatment of chronic or lingering
diseases. These cases are scattered all over the country. They are cases that
the general practitioner failed to cure, because his time and attention has
keen taken up with the acute diseases. He has made no study of this class of
cases. His office Is not equipped for treating them. As these cases are scat
tered over a wide area the only way it is possible for them to know of us
and the wonderful cures we are making Is through the columns of the pub
lic press.
All physicians advertise, some through relatives and friends, some
•through the church, some through the many fraternlal societies, while oth
ers use the press In this way: "Little Willie Jones .sprained his ankle. Dr.
Ethics was called and rendered the necessary? medical attention."
What Constitutes Quackery?
Webster says "a quack is a pretender to medical skill." The higher the physicians medical attainments, the
more thoroughly he has studied and understands the diseases he is treating, the farther he Is removed from quack
ery. If your physician who has had no training in eye, ear or nose diseases, treats your eyes untn you are blind,
or your ears until deaf, or your catarrh until uncurabie, if he treats ANY DISEASE without understanding its
nature or cure, he is guitly of quackery. If your physician, when called Into your home sees at a glance the case
is a trivial one, makes 3 or 4 visits a day, when one was all that was necessary. Is guilty of quackery.
If you are suffering from some obscure or chronic ailment and your physician treats you month after month,
giving you no benefit and assures you he is doing all medical science and skill can do, he is guilty of the lowest
kind of quackery.
Don't doctor month after month
Unless you are receiving some benefit. Don't allow your physician to consign you to an untimely end by telling
you or your friends there is no hope for you or that he is doing all science can do.
THERE ARE OTHERS that may understand, your case better. The medical profession is full of grand broad
minded men. It Is also full of ignorant, narrow, bigoted, jealous hearted men who-would sooner see you go into an
early grave than to be cured by any one else. These are the men that cry down every advance In medical science.
Anything out of the narrow groove in which they have run so long, is worthless. They aro the first to denounce
anyone who advances a new theory or discovery. I am not writing this to hurt any one's feelings, but to make
you think when selecting a physician. There are some cold facts in this article. When your physician uses the
term quack, or cries down another's attainments, LOOK UP HIS RECORD, when and where did lie graduate? Was
it before we had a good four years' medical course? How much time has he Put in, in hospital and post 'graduate
work
If you suffer from any chronic disease and are not getting the relief you should get we ask you to look up the
records and medical attainments of

Cor. Second and Market Sts. Third Floor Hofmann Building,
"backset for prohibition, not only in
that state but also in other southern
states in which prohibition is in force
by legislative enactment and not by a
vote of the people." The Baltimore
News (Ind.) believes it to be "the
most decisive setback the cause of pro
hibition has yet had in the south,"
while the Omaha World-Herald (Dem.)
finds here a deliberate choice on the
part of the people of Alabama, who,
having tried both ways, seem "to have
resolved against prohibition."
We are, however, reminded by many
editors that the "defeat of the amend
ment does not change the situation in
Alabama," for the stringent law passed
two years ago by the legislature pro
hibiting the sale of intoxicants re
mains, as the Knoxville Sentinel
(Dem.) puts it, "precisely as it was
before the election." Thus the Raleigh
News and Observer (Dem.) finds that
Alabama's policy of dealing w'th the
liquor traffic is still defined by this
law, and says further:
"It was accep'ted by most of tlie
state, but in several large cities the.
law was not. enforced and Governor
Comer and other leaders determined to
secure such amendments to the law as
would prevent the open violations 1n
those cities. The legislature passed the
desired amendments. Then the gover
nor and others thought it wottld be
best to make the state prohibition law
a part of the state constitution and
submitted it to the people. On Monday
a majority of the voters of Alabama
declined to ratify the proposed amend?
ments to the constitution, and so state
prohibition remains in Alabama upon
the same basis, as in North Carolina.
The leaders of the opposition to the
Comer amendment everywhere declar
ed that, state prohibition was not an
issue, and that their fight was upon
continued agitation and the incorpora
tion of measnres extra stringent.
Therefore the only result, so far as
state prohibition is concerned, is that
the act is not made a part of the con
stitution. and the weakly amend
ments are not added to the law."—The

AMONG THE ILLITERATES.
(Philadelphia Record.)
Uncle Joe Cannon had an amusing
Experience with a waiter in a Kansas
City hotel during his last visit to that
city. Being in no mood to select his
dinner, he had tossed aside, after a

the waiter, saying.
"Bring me a good dinner."
Incidentally "Uncle Joe" slipped the
man a big tip in advance.
This repast proving satisfactory, the
Speaker pursued the same plan during
the remainder of his stay in Kansas

THE OLD DEMOCRATIC SHIP.
Henry Watterson in the Louisville
Courier-Journal.—The Courier-Journal
has been trying ever since 1906 —it is
trying now and it will go on trying
to save the old Democratic ship of
Zion from shipwreck. Her bottom and
her keel seem not only still intact, but
as sound as oak and iron can make
them. Otherwise, she would long ago
have sunk beneath the wave. Much,
indeed, has gone awry with her steer
ing gear. There have been beneath her
decks some plots to scuttle and upon
her decks- many mutinies. She has
been loaded down at times with
strange, unmarketable cargoes. Selfish
men have fed themselves upon her
slender store of provisions, bawling
their loyalty and screaming "traitor"
at those who exnostul&ted- Yet there

she rides the billows, battered about
the bulkhead, heaten below the bilge,
her fo'castle plates stove in and her
stern sheets hanging over the taffrail'
—to some a kind of phantom ship—to
the Courier-Journal a fine old fighting
frigate of the Constitution class, well
worth saving, but requiring, before she
can be expected to sail effectively
against the Republican squadron, a,
world of outlay and labor, of refitting
and refurnishing—complete renova*

THE CRUELTY OF POLITICS.
Washington, la., Democrat.—One is
impressed daily that there is more in
the old proverb about republics being
ungrateful than a mere passing re
mark. When we note the fights thai
are being waged on men who have
grown gray in the service of their
country, we do not wonder that moat
men balk at being drawn into the
game.
Perhaps one of the worst abused
men of modern political times was
Grover Cleveland, who stood like a
rock for what he thought was right,
but because he did so, he was abused
like a horse thief and a pick pocket.
And yet, practically everything ho
stood for has now come to be popular
and conceded to be right. Read history
as far back as we have a history and
it is the same old story.
And it makes no difference what
kind of politics you enter, whether
Democratic or Republican or Populist
or Prohibition, it is the same old story.
When Roger Q. Mills was speaker of
the house, he was abused as if*Tie had
stolen the pennies off his dead moth
er's eyes. When Blaine was speaker
it was the same story. When Crisp
was speaker it was the same again and
so with Tom Reed, and Col. Hender
son was driven out of office and to his
death by the vultures who hounded
him. Then it was Hepburn, a Republi
can. and then Springer of Illinois, a
Democrat, and then. Lacey, a Republi
can, and Grosvenor, a Republican, and
Dave Hill, a Democrat, and Brice, of
Ohio, a Democrat, and first one party
and then the other, there being no dis
tinction, since calumny is no resiiector
of persons.
And now they are after .Speaker
Cannon as if he had stolen sheep. Tn
his old age, after spending a life timi
serving his country, as he thought, he
is to be hounded to his grave and that
will be the end.
