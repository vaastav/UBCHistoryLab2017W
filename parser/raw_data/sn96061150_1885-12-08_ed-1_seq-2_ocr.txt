ASTORIA. OREGON:
TUESDAY DECEMBER 8. 1885
LEGISLATIVE APPORTIONMENT.
After showing the outrageous ap
portionment of the legislative dis
tricts of Oregon, The Astobian
asks:
Does this look to you just, or reason
able, or fair? Is any farther argument
needed to show the absurdity of the
existing system of mis representa
tion? Exactly! but will The Astobian
advocate a just reasonable, sensible
system of representation? Not this
year in all probability. How long
would are-apportionment of Oregon
bo "just, reasonable, or fair?"
Suppose for the sake of argument
it was just and fair, in two elections
it would not be and would eventually
attain the monstrous wrong of the
present apportionment
Would The Astobian advocate a
system of representation based on the
people and not on- 4,slavepen" dis
tricts? Would it advocate "minor
ity" or "proportional" representation,
whereby Baker, Coos and Multnomah
or any other county could have as
many members in the legislature as
their votes stood in proportion to the
whole vote of the state?
Would The Astobian advocate the
election'of members of each body of
the legislature at large, each list of
candidates, of any party, being enti
tled to one member for each part of
the whole vote it received, equal to
such whole vote divided by the num
ber of members to be elected?
The present system of. electing rep
resentatives to the Uregon legisla
ture, is all The Astobian states, and
the only way to make the legislature
a true representative body, is to
adopt proportional representation.
Salem Vidette,3.
From reading- the above it is
not just clear to our mind whether
the Vidette is desirous of making
a point against The AsTOitrAN, or
is disposed to view the matter in
the same light. Probably the lat
ter of these motives would be the
more charitable to ascribe to our
astute contemporary. Reference
to the constitution of the-state and
the provisions therein regarding
legislative apportionment will an
swer the first two questions and
the accompanying proposition.
The third question we answer in
the affirmative. The fourth ques
tion is unintelligible to any one
except the propounded The
question will be answered if put
in such shape as will allow our
limited comprehension to grasp it.
The same remark applies to the
fifth.
In general Tiik Astobian be
lieves that exact interpretation
of existing statutes would re
move the present injustice, and
that the fault is due more to polit
ical cowardice and the inertia of
mossbackism than to any defect in
statutory enactment. But it does
not believe that it is necessary to
go outside the constitution to find
a remedy for the existing evil of
mis representation.
The following is from an article
by Rev. Lyman Abbott, D. D., en
titled "Danger Ahead," in the
November number of the Century,
upon the social and labor questien:
"All that we can learn from Alex
ander III., Bismarck, and the two
Napoleons is, how not to do it. Not
by making America less demo
cratic, but by making it more so,
are we to perpetuato the republic."
"Politically America is u democ
racy; industrially America is un
aristocracy." "At the ballot-box
the laborer is a king; in the factory
he is a servant, sjine i:u & slave.
Men who make governors, legisla
tors, judges, president-,, are not
allowed to determine how many
hours in the day they will work,
and are able to determine what
wages they shall receive only by
organizing in an unarmed militia
to preserve that right. The com
munity at the same time puts the
ballot into their hand and a man
acle upon it. We must either
take the ballot out or the manacle
off."
It is continually said, "It's
born in the boy, and must come
out." Character is not born in any
body. Forces are. Mould and
fashion these forces in one way
and they become beneficent.
Mould them another way and
they become maleficent. It is
with children as with clay, dif
ferent qualities are all capable of
being moulded. A poorer kind,
with care in shaping and burning,
will make beautiful bricks of great
use; an excellent kind, carelessly
moulded and poorly baked, will
make worthless material, only fit
to be thrown away. - It all depends
upon the treatment tho clay re
ceives whether it becomes of any
use in the work of the world.
Yesterday there was no life be
tween Cleveland and an interreg
num. Now there are two, Sher
man and Carlisle.
Rosecraxs has written a book
entitled "The mistakes of Grant "
This is one of the mistakes of
Rosecrans.
The president's message will be
read in congress to-day.
NEW TO-DAY.
A Card.
Editob Asteeian:
The Democratic mass meeting held at
the court house on Saturday last for the
purpose of nominating candidates for
city offices for the ensuing term, should,
and ought by every fair minded citizen
ana legal voter be repudiated on the
ground of the glaring and flagrant bull-
dosing propensities practiced at the bal
loting lor their respective nominees. The
balloting for street superintendent was
one of the most glaring impositions ever
palmed off on any intelligent communi
ty. The most obtuse observer could not
fail to detect that the whole proceeding
was a preconcerted cut and dried piece
of business, and stuffing the ballot box
was the order of the day.
The meeting being largely represented
by repeaters, sailors, sailor-runners and
the offscourings of swilltown who were
evidently hired for the express purpose
of assisting to demoralize the legitimate
process; and they admirably succeeded in
converting the balloting for the respec
tive nominees into a grand carnival and
enjoyed the joke hugely. In tho confu
sion that prevailed motions before the
house were wholly ignored by the chpir
man of the meeting, which does not re
dound very creditably to his ability as a
presiding officer of a public meeting and
can only be charged to his lack of knowl
edge in parliamentary rules. From the
unfairness in the count of the ballots
cast there are ample and sufficient rea
sons to contest the nomination of street
superintendent. The motion of putting
in nomination Mr. Chas. Shively for au
ditor and clerk, made by Mr. Andrew
Schuring, a legal voter and taxpayer of
this city was wholly ignored by the pre
siding chairman; but stuffing the ballot
box was cheerfully granted and no at
tempt made to check the imposition. All
fair minded, honest citizens and legal
voters should constitute themselves into
a committee of one and exercise the ut
most circumspection on election day, to
guard against a repetition of what tran
spired at the Democratic convention at
the court house, the proceedings of which
in the main, we emphatically pronounce
as a magnificent fraud and also an im
position on the ballot box.
