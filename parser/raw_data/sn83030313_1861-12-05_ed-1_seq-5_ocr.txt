| ^ the Cabinet It is a unit ou the splcudid con
servative policy of the President, as set forth ia
bis Mcssago. The effect of that document will
be worth half a dozen victories in the field, be
cause it reassures the country that the frenzied
efforts of the abolitionists will not succced in
niakinj, a change in the principles on which the
I'reaident declares the war shall bo conducted.
Tub Gamk Neaiilt Up with tiie Rebels a
New Oiii.eaN3. ? The letter which we published
.yesterday from a gentleman juit returned from
New Orleap:,, taken in connection with the in
telligence of the Un:on conspiracy recently dis
covered there, proves that thegnmc of rebellion
I- nearly played out in that city. With pro
vision* of every kind at famine prices, and the
minds of the terrorists distracted by the fear of
insurrection, it is not likely that the feeling of
"loyalty which is known to exist among the
working classes there can be initch longer kept
down. We are convinced that it recjuires but
an effective demonstration on the part of our
fleet to bring back New Orleans to its allegiance
to the federal government. When we have
'finished up with Savannah and Charleston, we
will turn our attcation to the traitors of that
? city.
"Honest Aiie Lincoln" and the Aiiot.itiox
' Ists. ? The President's Message, on the slavery
question, will reassure the country, andghc
new heart and reuewed hope to the loyal men
of the South awaiting their deliverance. Our
disorganizing abolitionists are taken aback,
and will soon begin to show their teeth, no
?doubt; but as "llonest Old Abe" has "scthis
"foot down firmly,'" the two houses of Congress
"will sustain him. The only trouble to be ap
prehended is from such abolition disturbers of
the public harmony as Sumner. But let the
?conservative men in Congress be Arm and de
cided, and everything will come out right. We
?ha!l soon put down this rebellion, restore the
Union, and resume with a new impulse of grea^
power our glorious career of peaceful prospe
rity.

OPERATIONS AT THE OITI'OSTS OP TUB AUSIY.
General Fitzjohn Tortor reports to headquai tors that

?Coiouel Varncy, and one hundred sharpshooters of fio
Twenty -socoud Massachusetts. under Major Tliton, to ho
?peeially stationed. Gimsral l'crter followed them at n
later hour with the Third Pennsylvania cavalry, all uudT

tho country, and beyond Vienna to Hunter's Mill-:,
ao enemy was seen except two small partlw ?
one of three persons, beyond Vienna, and one
[??nearly two miles beyond Hunter's Mills, to neither of
which could h ' get closer. No er.cniy has boeu in the ro
lon visited by Colonel Averill slnco Ptmdajr. He ex
presses groat satisfaction at the manner in which nil i nif
ties acted to-day, and thinks Captain Hell was fortunate
in not lotting his whole a piadrun upon his recotiuoissanco
last week, as thu party which attacked and pursued him
s kn'iwn to have been over five times his number.
General WaJsworth guarded the road from near Fair
'ax Court House to Vienna; General Hancock near Wal
Fer's Mill, and General McCall had a foraging party on
?illlcult run , and discovered no enemy. A dense smoke
camp fires was recti rising from Gormantown, to thu
groat' of Fry ing Pan.
Gonerul Hancock telegraphs from the headquarter? of
?General Smith's division to hoaiiquarterB, that on yestor
Iday a boy, working at Mr.: Walters', near Walters' Mill,

luirod to nmkn a scout after coming off picket duty. Ho
ilso states that there was one regiment of Infantry of
ibout one thousand men at Gorman town one week since,
tut no considerable force this side of Cenlrcvlllc
fTbey often come down in force and go back
tgain. Thu regiment at Gwmantown, with the cacalt y , he

was at Centrcvlllo, tlir '<> woikB since, tho report among
iheau troops w us that they had seventy or eighty thou"
land won, all between Centreville and Bull run, with a
"ew troops on a road lotdlng to Manassaa. At that time
;wo South Carolina regiments and a battery were to go
South on the following Saturday. There was a great deal
>f ill feeling existing bet wen the Virginia and South Ca
rolina troops, in eonsoquenco of the determination <>' the
Jt.tt., tr. return homo. The boy states that there were no
,roop8 at Fairfax at that time. General Hancock thinks
,ho boy slates the truth.
Our scouts up to last nlglit report that no enemy
could bo seen iu the vicinity of Waiters' Mill.
No enemy has been In that direction since Pun
day night, and then at the Union schooihouse
this flklo of the turnpike; and between Peacock Tlill and
General Mc( ail's lilies there was a considerable forc<?,
which remained all ni|;ht.
One week uco to day a large force of cavalry and in
Gantry nniThe l from Hunter'? Mill, passed Walters' Mill,

and then to the tolignto, and still another In the ro.ir to
wards Coneral McCall's lir.fp. The people in the neigh

Information has reached this city to-night that some of
ojr advance pickets were driven i:i at Annandale this af
ternoon. A force was immediately seut in pursuit of the
rebels, but they but they had <li?appcared.
TUB 8LAVEKY QUESTION IM CONGRESS.
The irrepressible nicker has occupied most of the at
tention of the Senate and House of Representatives to
day.
Senator Trumbull will offer his bill to-morrow, and
support il in a speech, providing for the confiscation of
all properly belonging to rebels, and protecting all pro
perty liolonglnjj. to loyalist.*. Tho radicals in Congress
will Anally eetlle down upon the principles of this bill
notwithstanding some of them arc now shouting for the
entire abolition of slavery overywliero.
THK IlKrOKTKD DISAGRKEMIOT IN TUB CABINBT.
There in a class of people is this city who employ their
time in inventing falsi hoods and circulating them, and
when any of these reports reach the newspapers the in
ventors thereof chuckle in their sleeves, and boast that
Lhey havo sold somebody. Yesterday and last night the
:las* of persona alluded to started tho absurd report that
thero had been a row in the Cabinet, and that the quarrel
was chiefly between Seward and Cameron; that the
former announced his intention to resign if Ca
meron's report was not changed, and that Cume*
?on swore he would resign If it was; and, finally
hat it was agreed that It should be partially al.'
ered; that Cameron submitted gracefully , and h.irmony
was restored. This whole statement was an invention of
1 fellow who bad been snubv,ad by Gen. Cameron, be
jausc the latter had refused to comply w'th the former's
lemands for contracts. The falsifier was sent for by a
tovernment officer and properly reprimanded. That tho
tessaft and reiorts were examined and properly dis
missed, as Is the practice In such cases., is true: some
irere, perhaps, modified; but that the best of good foeliug
irevaiioil between the President and different members
if tho Cabinet, and that such fueling exi ts now, Is a
KMitivc and well known fact.

At eleven o'clock this morning an engine and olegan1

altering about. Thoy gazed at the occupants of the car,
upposing thom to be some dial inguished strangers from
broad.
The train arrived at Baltimore, where the parties were
o meet friends from the West. An explosion of a locotno.
ive on the Western road, causing the ln?iant death of
the englnoer uO fireman, delayed their f penis, and Kept
the stranger! Id Baltimore several hours. /* pOftlOtJ of
the time w?s occupied Id the room of the President of the
Korthern Central Railroad. The stranger, fiuilmn the/
thoy had no time to spare, proceeded to tho SSutaw IHmse
and dined, Dot booking their names. Mi*. Fiiiith,Suj orin
tendeut of the Hall more and Ohio Railroad, ncted as a
cicerone. After dinner, conducted by Mr. Smith, the
lady and gentleman drove quietly through Baltimore In
an oi'en barouche.
At lust their friends came from the West, and the strange
gentleman greeted hia wife, and gazed for tho first
time upon his first born. Tho whole company ww s1 on
conveyed to tho Washington depot, and being safily
seated in the splendid parlor car, provided by Superin
tendent Smith, the engineer started the train, aud the
party arrived safely in this city about oight o'clock this
evening.
The mysterious gentleman in black, with his precious
charge, alighted from tlie car, accompanied by the rest
of tho party, al! of whom took carriages and proceeded to
a splendid mansion, corner of R and Fifteenth streets.
This strango gentleman in black was no let-s a person*

army of tl<e United States, lie procoeded on this quiet
mission to meet his wife, daughter and mother-in-law,
Mrs. Man y, and their friends. The Genoral waa accom

several poinu where the train stopped, at Annapolis
Junction iind the Relay House, some of tho soldiers recog
nized the General Just as tho train moved on, and the
greatest anxiety waa Instantly manifested In each case to
get a look at tho young chieftain. This being impossible,
the troops would shou t and awing their hats high In air.
In Baltimore ho was not rccognixod by the masses, and
enjoyed the diivo through the i lty unmolested.
Thin is the first tiwo the General h.-is left Washington,
except lu the strict line of military duly, since he came

TO TBB EDITOR OF THE HERALD.
Nkw Yohx, Dec. <71881.
In your issue of Saturday last, In noticing the sermons
that were delivered on Thanksgiving Bay, you say: ?
"Rev. Mr. Putcber proclaims that beforo God .is done
with us thero shall not be one who Ehalt woar tho
shackles of the slave." Giving It without qualification,
you muko me ontirely re i*>nslblc for the sentiment. My
language waa:? "It has boon said by somo tbat such
should ho the case; but, whatever Is God's will, we will
look up and say:? Even so. Father, for so it seemed good
in Thy sight." Tho thought, as you soe, i.j altogether
different. From childhood, taught to lovo the Hag of my
country , 1 expect always to live a Union man. My politi
cal creed has ever and shall ever bo, no party but tbe
country no bond butthoUnion.no charier but the con
stitution, and no obligation bat the law.
Will you be kind enough to oorrect the mistake?
