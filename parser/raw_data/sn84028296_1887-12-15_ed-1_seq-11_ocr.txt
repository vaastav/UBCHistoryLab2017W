THE DEMOCRATIC NORTHWEST, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1887.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
THE SURPLUS AXDTHE TARIFF.
. ie Danger of Too Blnch Cash In tb
Vaults Re-adjustment Recommended.
The President's message was seat to both
i' -ousn o Congress Tuesday. The President
opens with the statement that tb rereoot
receipts frora all sources largely exceeds the
turn necessary to meet the expenses of the
jrovamment; that during the year ending
- June 30, the exoess was over fifty-lire mit-
lions. The President then shows that it be
came necessary to cell in the three per cent
bonds, also 4 and i per cents, interests on
other bonds were anticipated and banks se
lected as depositories of public money were
permitted to increase their deposits. Not
withstanding all this the surplus continued to
Increase, and by June SO next, it is expected
to amount to one hundred and forty mil
lions. The supposition that the secretary of
the treasury may make further bond pur
chases seems to be the only relief in the pow
er of the executive. The only provision of
law from which such a power could
be derived is found in an approprittion bill
pawed a numter of years ago; and it is subject
to the suspicion that it was intended as tem
porary, and limited in its application, instead
of conferring a continuing discretion and au
thority. The President therefore wants legslation to
provide checks and limitations, and at the
v same time relieve the Secretary of the Treas
ury from undueresponsibility. The President
savs:
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation
the surplus money accumulating in the Treas
ury, it should be borne in mind that premiums
must of course be paid upon such purchase,
. that there may be a large part of these bonds
held as investments which cannot be pur
chased at any period, and that combinations
among holders who are willing to sell, may
reasonably enhance the cost of such honds to
the Government.
Of course it is not expected that unneces
sary and extravag nt appropriations will be
made for the purpose of avoidingthe accum
ulation of an excess of revenue. Such ex
penditure, beside the demoralization of all
just conceptions of publio duty which it en
tails, stimulates a habit of reckless improvi
. denes not in the least consistent witu the
mission of our people, or the high and beneit
ent purposes of our government
It need hardly be stated that while the
present situation demands a remedy, we can
only be saved from a like predicament in the
future by the removal of its causes.
It must be conceded that none of the things
subjected to internal revenue taxation are,
strictly speaking, necessary; there appears to
be no just complaint of this taxation by the
consumers of these articles, and there seems
to I nothing so well able to bear the burden
without hardship to any portion of the peo
. pie.
But our present tariff laws the vicious,
inequitable and illogical source of unneces
sary taxation ought to be at once revised
and amended.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the
B""' "leountry of this taxation. It must be exten
tively continued as the source of the govern
ment's income; and in a readjustment of i-ur
tanif the interests of American labor en
gaged in manufacture should be carefully
ousidered, as well as the preservation of our
manufacturers.
' But this existence should not mean a con
dition which, without regard to the public
welfare or a national exigency, must always
insure the realization of immense profits in
stead of moderately profitable returns.
As the voluu.e and diversities of our nation
al activities increase, new recruits are added
to ttiose who desire a continuation of the ad
- Vantages which they conceive the present sys
tem 01 urui taxation airecxiy aaoras mem.
So stubbornly have all eftorts to reform
the present condition been resisted by those
of our fellow citizens thus eneaeeJ, that thev
can hardly complain of the suspicion enter-
UUiieu sv im uuu ejhuciib, tuut buere exreus
an organized combination all a'oug the line
to maintain their advantage.
Bv the last census it is made to appear that
of the 17,bU2,099 of our population engaged
in all sons of industries, there are actually
8,ciW,UDS persons employed in such manufact
uring iuuustrits as are claimed to be bene
fited by a high tariff. To those the appeal is
made to save their employment ana main
tain their wages by resisting a change.
There should be no disposition to answer such
suggestions by the allegation that they ore in
- a minority among those who labor, but the
reduction of taxation deanuded should be so
measured as not to necessitate or justify tha
toss of employment by the workingman, nor
tLe lessduuig of his wagej, and the profits still
remaining 10 the manufacturer, after a neces
sary readjustment, should furnish no excuse
. tor the sacrifice of the interests of his em
ployees either in their opportunity to worn or
in tne diminution of then- compensation. Nor
can the worker in manufactures fail to under
stand that while a high tai-Uf is claiiuei to be
necessary to allow the payment of remuner
ative wug.s, it certainty results in a very
large inc. ease in the price of i.early all sorts
of manufacturers, which, iu almost countless
forms, lie needs for the use of himself and his
family. He receives at the desk of his em
ployer his wages, and perhaps before he
reaches his home is obliged iu a
purchase for faith of an article which em
braces b.s own labor, to return in the pay
ment of the increase in price which the tariff
permits, the hard earued compensation of
many days of toil. The farmer and the ugri-
culturist who manufacture nothing, bat who
pays the increased price which the tariff im
poses upou every agricultural implement, up
on alt -s wears ana upon all he uses and owns,
except the increase of his flocks and herds
and such things us his husbandry produces
lrom the soil, is invited to aid in maintaining
the prtsant situation, ana he is told that a
high duty on imported wool is necessary for
tiu) benefit of those who have sheep to 8ne.tr,
in owner iba the prica of their wool may be
mcreosed. The President then attempts t j
prove the fallacy otaucli an argument, intro
ducing facts and figures, and says: Wueu the
number of farmers engaged iu wool raising is
- compared with all the farmers in ihe country,
' anu die small proportioirtbey bear to our pop
ulation ia u$ulxL iihftu.it is. maik. sg'Jdr
: rent that, in the case of a large part of thtse
who own sheep, the benefit of che present tar
iff on wool is. illusory and above all, when it
must be vonceeded that the increase of the
cost of living caused by such tariff, becomes a
" burden upou tuose with moderate means and
. the poor, the unemployed and employed, the
sick aud well, and tue young and old, and that
it constitutes a tax which, with relentless

In speuKiiig of the increased cost to the
coiisuiudr of our home manufactures, requit
ing Horn a uuty lnd upoii imported articles
' ot tue sameucscriptiou, the taut is not over
looked tuut competition among our Uomestin
producers sotueum.es lius tuo vifectof keeping

i rious that ih.a coinpctiuou .s . lot- ofwii
. strati gled hy combinations quite prevalent as
this tune, and frequently called trusts, which
r. have for their object the regulation of the
supply and price of commoiities made and
sold by members of the combination. The
people can hardly hope for any consideration
m the operation of these selfish schemes. The
: necessity of combination to maintain the price
of any commodity to the tariff point, furnish
. es proof that some one is willing ,to accept
lower prices for such commodity, and that
' such prices are remunerative; and lower
prices produced by competition prove the
y sime.thing. Thus, where either of these con
ditions exist, a case would seem to be present
ed for an easy reductian of taxation. The
considerations which have been presented
touching our, tariff laws are intended only to
enforce an earnest recommendation that the
surplus revenues of the government be pre
vented by the reduction of our customs du
ties. ' Under our present laws more than 4,000 ar
ticles are subject to duty. Many of toeae do
not in any way compete with our own manu-
ucuires, ana many ar uruij atten
tion as subjects ot revenue. A considerable
reduction can be mm in the aeeiezata bT

The question of I reo trade is absolutely Ir
relevant and the persiitinc diim mtdo ia
certun quarters, that all efforts to relieve the
the peopie from unjwt anu unnecessary tax
ation are schemes of so-called free traders; is
mischievous and far removed from any con
sideration for the public good. The simple an t
plain duty which we oe the people is to re
duce laxuuou to the necessary expeiu.sot an
economical operation of the government and
to restore to (be uusiuau oi tad country the
money which we hold iu the treasury tnrough ;
the perversion of governmental powers.
These things can ami should be done with
safety to all our industries, without danger
to the opportunity for remunerative labor
which our worsingmen need, and will benefit
them and all our people, by cheapening tueir
mains of subsistence and increasing the
measure of their comforts.
HOW THE BANK." WAS WORKED.
More of the Story of the Wreck that
Harper Made.
In tho Harper trial William Leuchter, in
dividual book-keeper of the German National
Bank, testified that the check of Swift's Steel
and Iron Works tor $63,000, ot May 23, 1887,
could not have been paid, as there was only
$45.29 to their credit. Frank Marshall, in
dividual book-keeper of the First National
bank, detailed the chocks and balances of
Wilshire, Eckert Sc. Co., since October, 1888,
showing their acconnta to be frequently
overdrawn. Ebene-sr Gay, individual
book-keeper of the Merchants' Bank, swore
that on May 7, J. W. Wilshire drew a check
for $15,000 against a balance of $3,281.40.
More testimony showed that Wishire's and
Swift's accounts at these and J. Kuhu &
Son's banks were often overdrawn.
Mr. Hoy t said Mr. Harper was his .princi
pal in the wheat deal, Mr. Hopkins having
told him so, C. A. Hinch told how the three
drafts of Wilshire, Eckert & Co. for $100,
000 each on the First National Bank were
not entered on the book; how two checks of
Benjamin E. Hopkins for $70,000 and $40,
393.75 were found in the cash, were replaced
by checks of Wilshire) Eckert & Co. at
Hopkins' instance, and traced the drafts from
the Fidelity to bolster up the wheat deal

The New Postmaster-General. .
: . DON M. DICKINSON
' Mr. Dickinson will be the youngest mem
ber of Mr. Cleveland's Cabinet He was
born at Auburn, N. Y., in 1845. His father
Asa Dickinson, was a distant relative of
Daniel S Dickinson,, but belonged to the
Massachusetts Dickinsons. He went to
Michigan when Don was a small boy. The
new Postmaster-General was educated at the
State University at Ann Arbor, graduating
in 1808. . Three years later he received his
diploma from the law school and began to
practise. . At first he had a desk in his older
brother's office. When the latter, already a
rich man, went to New York to accept a re
tainer of $10,000 a year from one of the
largest dry-goods firms there, he gave his
business to Don. ) s m
On receiving this encouraging gratuity Don
took into partnership" another Dickinson,
Julian G., who was no kin whatever to him,
but' knew how to collect debts. The two
prospered and separated, but Don held to
gether the large collection business, fn winch
he had made a good deal of money. The firm
is now Dickinson, Hosmer & Thurber, and
the senior- partner is said to have an income-all
told of over $40,000 a year. A
large part of this comes from his collection
bureau, which he runs independently ot the
firm. He hires two or three good lawyers
and a big corps of clerks am! pushes the busi
ness with an energetic hand. He is famous
for promptitude and never stops when he
gets after a debtor until he nolle 'ts his judg
ment and hands over the cash to hit client.
He is said to be worth half a million, and
Mrs. Dickinson, who was a Grand Rapids
girl, has a fortune ot $150,000 in her own
right They have only one child, a little
girl three years old.
Mr. Dickinson is a slender, black-haired
man, with black side-whiskers flanking a thin,
pale face. He has been a delogate-atHargti in
every National Democratic Convention since
1876. He was- an enthusiastic Cleveland man
long before the Chicago Convention, and
never saw the President until he met him
bv invitation- in Buffalo in December,
1884, when Mr." Cleveland had gone there to
arrange his affairs preparatory to making his
home in the White House. Then, in company
with Judge Lothrop, now Minister to Russia,
Mr. Dickinson called on Mr, Cleveland. The
two took a fancy to e&ch other which time
has only strengthened.
