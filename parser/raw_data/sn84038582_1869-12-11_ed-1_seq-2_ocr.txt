President's Message.
Washington, lfcip. 0.
Tolhf Senate and IIoiihs oMVj'recn'ft!ive
Iii coming before you for thui4t lime a
the chief maVistraK- of the nation,, itfy with
gratitude to the giver of nil ' good or the
many benefits we erj v. We are Wisscd
with peice at homo find an withont cut-aug-lin?
alliances nbroiid to loivbodc Trouble.
With a territory uiiMirp ussed in fertility, of
an area equal to t lie libundant support of
5O0.WK),0l)0 pcea . , ami abounding in every
variety of ust fin ihicval in quantities sufli
cieiit to supply the world lor generations;
with luxuriant crop's; with a variety of cli
mate adapted to the production of every
species of earth's riches, and suited to the
habits, tates and rcc.ui.'em'Mits of every
living thing; with a population of 40,IMW-U0l)
ol free people, nil speaking one InngU'irre,
with facilities for every mortal to acquire
an education; with institutions i closing to
rone the avenues to fame or any blessings of
fortune that may be coveted': with freedom
of the pulpit, the pressandthe schools, with
a revenue flowing into the treasury beyond
the requirements of grver nneiit supply;
lmrmony is being rapidly restored within
our own borders; manufactures hitherto
unknown in our country are springing up
in all directions, producing a degree of na
tional indi pendenee untqualled by that of
any other power. These blessings and
countless others are entrusted to your care
and mine for safe keeping for the brief pe
riod of our term of oilice. In a short time
we must each of us return to the ranks of
the peeple who have conferred upon us our
honors, and account to them for our stew
ardship. I earnestly desire that neither you
nor I may be condemned by a free and en
lightened constituency nor by our own con
science. Emerging from a rebellion of gi
gantic magnitude, aided and assisted as it
was by the sympathy and assistance of na
tions with whom we" were at peace, eleven
states of the Union were loft lour years ago
without legal Mate government; a debt had
been contracted ; American commerce was
almost driven from the sens; the Industry of
one-half the country had been taken from
the control of the capitalist and placed
where all labor rightfully belongs, m the
keeping of the laborer ; the work of resto
ring Hie state governments loyal to the
Union; of protecting and fostering free la
bor, and providing means fur paying the in
terest on thepubhc debt, has received ample
attention from congress. Although your
' efforts have not met with the success in all
particulars that mig'.t have been desired,
yeton the whole they have been more suc
cessful than could have been reasonably
anticipated. Seven states which passed or
dinances of secession have been fully resto
red to their places in the Union ; the eighth,
OE01W.il A
Zicld an election at which she ratified her
constitution, repuplican in form, elected a
Governor, members of congress, a state leg
islature and all oilier ollicci required; "the
legislature met ami performed all the acts
then required of them by the reconstruction
acts of congress. (Subsequently, however,
in violation of the constitution they had
. just ratified, as since decided by the supreme
court of the state, they unseated the colored
' members of the legislature, and udmitted
some members who are disqualified by the
third clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
lo the constitution, un article which they
themselves had contributed to ratity. Under
; these circumstances, 1 would submit to you
whether it would not be wise to pass with
out delay, a law authorizing the governor
of Georgia to convene the members origin
ally elected to the legislature, requiring
. each member to take the oath prescribed by
the reconstruction act, and none to be ad
Biitted who are ineligible under the third
clause of the fourteenth amendment.
THE KKEF.DMEN.
Under the protection which they have
received are making rapid progress in learn
inc, and no complaints are heard of a lack
of industry on their part when they receive
fair remuneration for their services.
THE PUBLIC DKRT.
The means provided for paying the interest
on the public debt, with all other expenses
of the government, are more than amplo. .
COMMENCE.
The loss of our commerce is the only re
sult of the late rebellion which has not re
ceived sufficient attention from you. To this .
subject 1 call your earnest attention. I will
not now suggest plans by which this object
may be i filcted, but will, if necnessary, make
It the subject of a special message during
the session of congress.
ViKGlXIA, MISSISSIPPI AND TEXAS
At the March term, congress by joint res
V ion, authorized the Executive to order
at. election in the stales of Virginia, Missis
sippi and Texas. He submitted to them the
constitutions which each had previously in
convention framed, and submitted the con
stitutions either entire or in separate parts,
to be voted upon at the discretion of the
Exceptive. Under this authority elections
were called. In Virginia the election took
place on the tith of July, 1869. the governor
andl' jtenant governor elected have been
Installed, the legislature met and did all re
quired by this resolution and by all the re
construction acts of congress, and abstained
from all doubtful authority. I recommend
thai her senators and representatives be ad
mitted and that the state be fully restored to
its place in the family of states. Elections
were called in Mississppi and Texas, to com
mence the 30th or November, 1801), to last
two days in Mississippi and four days in
eX!ls- The elections have taken place but
the result is not known. It is to lie hoped
that the acts of the legislatures of these
states, when they meet, will bo such as to
receive your approbation and thus close the
work of reconstruction.
bi'lWIB PAYMENTS.
Ouu of the evils arising out of the rebellion
ami not yet u fi r red to is that of irredeemable
currency. It is an evil which I hope will
receive your most earnest attention. It is a
duty and one of the highest duties of the
Sovermneiit, to secure I o thu citizen a me
ium of exchange of tixed unvarying vulue
This implies in return to a specie basis, nnd
uosubsUtutc foril can be devised. It should
be commenced now, and reached at the ear
liest practicable moment consistent with
.a fair regard for the interest of the debtor
class. Immediate resumption, if practica
ble, would not bo desirable; it would com
pel the debtor class to get pay beyond their
contracts, the premium on gold at the date
of their purchase, and would bring bank
ruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctuations,
L'.vr:ver, la the paper value of the measure
of all values of gold, is detrimental to the in
terest of trade. It makes the maa of busi
ngs an involuntary gambler, for in all sales
Where future payment is to bo made, both
parlies specula to as to what will be the value
of the currency to be paid and received. I
cum-My recommend toyou,thon, such leg
Ration oh UI lnure a gradual return to
specie payments, and put nn immediate
stop to the fluctuation in the valuation of
currency. The methods to secure these re
sults are s numerous as are the speculations
of political ttconomv. To secure the latter
I tee but one way, and that is to authorize
the Treasury tq redeem its own paperut a
fixed price whenever presented ; to withhold
from circulation ali such currency redeemed
until bold aain for gold.
The vast resources of the nation", both de
veloped and undeveloped, ou;lit to make
our credit the best on earth, with a less bur
den of taxation tlmi thecitizen has endured
for six years pat. Tin- entire debt could be
paid in ten years, but it is not desirable that
the people should be taxed to pay it in that
time Year by year 1 1 i ; ability to pay in
creases in rapid ratio, bni the bur len of in
terest ought to be r.tluc d as rapidly as can
be done without the violation of contracts.
The public debt is represented in great part
by bonds having from live to twenty and
ten to f)rty years to run, bearing interest at
the rate of six percent, and live percent,
respectively.
It is optional with the government to pay
their bonds at any period after the expira
tion of the last time mentioned upon their
face. The time lias already expired when a
great part of them may be taken up ; the
time is rapidly approaching when all may
be. It is believed that all which are now
due may be replaced by bo.uls bearing a
rate of interest not exceeding -13 a per cent.,
nnd as rapidly as t lie remainder becomes
due they may'be replaced iii the same way;
to accomplish this it may be necessary to
nutnorize the interest to be paid at cither
three or four of the moncved cities of Eu
rope, or by any Assistant Treasurer of the
United States, at the option of the holder of
the bond. I suggest this subject for the con
sideration of Congress; also, simultsneously
with this, the propriety of redeeming our
currency as before suggested, at its market
value at the time the law goes into effect,
increasing rate at which the currency will
be bought and sold from day to day, or from
week to week, and at the same rale of in
terest as the government pays upon its
bonds.
TAXES AND TAJUVKS.
The subject of the tariff and internal tax
ation will necessarily receive your attcn
attention. The revenues of this country
are greater than the requirements, and mav
with safety, be reduced ; but as the funding
of the debt, on a four, or a four and a half
ficr cent., would reduce the annual expenses
argcly, thus after funding, justifying a
greater reduction of taxation than would be
nonexpedient. I suggest the postponement
of this question until the next meeting of
Congress, when it may be advisable to mod
ify taxation and tariff in instances where
unjust or burdensome discriminations are
made by the present laws, but a general re
vision of the laws regulating this subject, 1
recommend the postponement for the pres
ent. I also suggest the renewal of the tax
on incomes, but at a reduced rate, say of 3
per cent., and this tax to expire in three
years, with the funding of the national debt
as here suggested. I feel safe in saying the
taxes and revenue from imports may be re
duced safely from sixty to eighty millions
per annum at once, nnd still further reduce
from year to year, as the resources of the
country are developed.
FINANCIAL STATITK8.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury shows the receipts of the government
for the fiscal year ending June o(), 18(5!), to
be $37u7.ll;t,?47, and the expenditures, inclu
ding interest, etc.. to be $:isl,4t),o!7. The
estimates for the ensuing year are more fa
vorable to the government, and will, no
doubt, show a large decrease of the public
debt. The receipts in the Treasury beyond
expenditures, have exceeded the amount
necessaiy to place to the credit of the sink
ing fund, as provided by law. To lock up
the surplus in the Treasury, and withhold
it from circulation, would lead to such a
contraction of the currency as to cripple
trade, and seriously affect the prosperity of
the country. Under these circumstances,
the Secretary of the Treasury and myself
heartily concurred in the propriety of using
all surplus currency in the lieasury in the
purchase of government bonds, tlnis redu
cing the interest bearing debt of the coun
try, and of submitting to Congress the ques
tion of disposition to be made of the bonds
so purchased. The bonds now held by the
Treasury, amount to about 75,000,000, inclu
ding those belonging to the sinking fund.
our attention is respectfully invited to
the recommendations of the Secretary of
the Treasury for the creating of the office
of Commissioner of Custom Revenues ; for
the increase of salary to certain classes of
officials ; and the substitution of increased
national bond circulation to replace the out
standing 3 per cent certificates, and more
especially to his recommendation for the re
peal of laws allowing shares of fines, penal
ties, forfeitures, etc., to the officers of the
government, or to informers.
TUB KEVEKUE BUREAU.
The office of Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, is one of tho most arduous and
responsible under the government. It falls
bnt little, if any, short of a Cabinet position
in its importance and responsibilities. I
would ask for it, therefore, 6uch legislation
as, in your Judgment, will place the ofliceon
a footing of dignity commensurate with its
importance, nnd with the character and
qualifications of the class of men required
to fill it properly.
THK CUBAN 0,1'KKTION.
As the United States is the freest of all
nations, so, too, its people sympathise with
all people striking for liberty and self-government;
but while so sympathising, it is
due to our honor that wc should abstain
from enforcing our views upon unwilling
nations, and from taking an interested part,
without invitation, in the quarrels between
diticrcut nations, or between governments
and their subjects. Our course should al
ways be in conformity with strict justico
and law, international and local. Such has
been the policy of the administration in
dealing with these questions. For more
than a year a valuable proviace of Spain
and a near neighbor of ours, in whom all
our people cannot but fed a deep interest,
has been struggling for independence and
freedom.
CUIJA AND CANADA.
The people of the United states entertain
the fcjime warm feeling and sympathy for the
I'vi'iueoi Luna iu uicir pending struggle
that they manifested throughout the pre
vious struggles between Spain and former
colonies, in 1,,'half of the latter, but the con
test at no time iissumcd the conditions which
amount to a war in tho senseof internation
id law, or which would show tho existence
of a ik fttclo political organization of the in
BtircentH sufficient tu justify a recognition of
belligerency. The principle is maintained,
however, that the nation is its own judgo
when to accord the right of belligerency
either to a people struggling to free them
selves from a government they belicvo to bo
oppressive or to independent nations atvr r
with each other. The United States have
no disposition to interfere with the existing
relations of Spain to her Colonial possesions
on the-Ccntuient They believe that in due
time Spinn.nnd other European powers will
Jind their tfitJeriUt in terminating those rela
tioni find establishing their present depends
encit s ns independent powers, umiibf r of ?
me jamiiy or nations, inese ucpenuvucirs
arc no longer regarded as subject tojtransl'ejr,
from one European-power to another:- "When
the present relations of colonies cease, they
are to become independent powers, exercis
inir the right of choice and of self control
in tho determination of their future Condi
tions and relations with other powers. The
Unit ed States In order to put ft stop to blood
shed in Cuba, and in the interest of neigh
boring people, proposed their good offices
to brilis the existing contest b a termina
tion. The offer not being accepted by Spain
on a biisis which we believe could lie receiv
ed by Cuba was withdrawn ; it is hoped that
. the good offices of the United States may
vet prove advantageous tor the settlement
of this unhappv strife Meanwhile several
illegal expeditions against Cirtw have been
broken up.
It lias been the endeavor of tho adminis
tration, to execute the neutrality laws in
good faith, no mailer how unpleasant the
task made so bv the sutTerins we have endur
ed from lack of like good faith towards us
by other nations on the United States,

was arrested on the high seas by a Spanish
frigate and two passengers taken from it and
carried as prisoners to Cuba. Representa
tions of these facts were made to the Span
ish Government, soon a official informs,
tiou of them reached Washington. The
two passen cits were set at liberty, and the
Sianisn tnmrmvior.t assured the United
States, that the captain of the frigate in
making the capture had acted without law,
that he had been reprimanded for the irreg
ularity ol his conduct, and the Spanish au
thorial in Onb would not sanction any act
hat could riolatethe rights or treat with
disrespect the sovereignty of thia nation.
M ART LOWELL.
The question of the seizure of the brig
Mary Lowell, at one of the Bahama Islands,
by Spanish authorities is more the subject
of correspond rroe between this government
and those ot Spain and Great Britain. The
Captain General of Cuba about May last
issued a proclamation authorizing a search
to be made of vessels on the high seas. Ira
' mediate remonstrance was made against
'. this, whereupon the CapVain General issued
a new proclamation, limiting the right of
search of vessels belonging to the United
States, so far as authorized under the treaty
of 1793. This proclamation, however, waa
immediately withdrawn. I have always
felt that the most intimate relations should
be cultivated between the republic of the
United States and all independent nations
on this continent. It may be well worth
considering whether treaties between the
United States and them may be not profit
ably entered into to secure more intimate
relations, friendly, commercial or otherwise.
DAM EX CANAL.
The subject of the inter-oceanic canal to
connect the Atlantic and Pacific ocean
through the Isthmus of Darien is one in
which commerce is greatly interested. In
structions have been given to our minister
to the republic of the United States of Co
lombia, to endeavor to obtain authority for
a survey by the government in order to de
termine the Dracticability of such an under
taking and a charter for the right of wsy to
build by private enterprise such work. If
the survey proves it to be practicable, in
order to comply with the agreement of the
: United States as to a livied commission at
Lima for the adjustment of claims, it be
came necessary to send a commissioner and
say to Lima in August last. No appropira
tion having been made for this purpose, it is
now asked that one be made covering the
past and future expenses of the Commission.
SOUTH AMKRICAX RELATIONS
The good offices of the United States to
( bring about a peace between Spain and the
South American republics, with which she
is at war, having been accepted by Spain,
Peru and Chili, a Congress has been invited
to be held in "Washington during the pres
ent winter. A grant has been given to Euro
peans of an eiclusive right of transit over
the territory of Nicaragua to which Costa
Rica has given it assent, which, it is alleged
, conflicts with the vcated rights of citizens of
the United States. The Department of the
State has now this subject under considera
tion, the minister of Peru having made
representation! that there was a state of war
between Peru and Spain, and that ' Spain
was constructing in and near New lork
thirty gunboats which might be used by
Spain in such a way as te relieve the moral
force of Cuba so as to operate against Peru,
orders were given to prevent their depar
ture. No further steps having been taken
by the representative of the Peruvian gov
ernment to prevent the departure of these
vessels and 1 not feeling authorized to re
tain the property of a nation with which we
are at peace, on a mere executive order, the
matter has been referred to the courts to de
cide. The conduct of the war between the
allies and the Republic of Paraguay has
made the intercourse with that country so
difficult that it has been deemed advisable
to withdraw our representatives from there.
Tna ALARAMA CLAIMS.
Near the close of the last administration
a convention was signed at London for the
settlement of all outstanding claims bo
tween Great Britain and the United Statea
which failed to receive the advice and con
sent of the Senate to its ratification at tb
time, and the circumstances atteading
negotiation of the treaty were unfavor
to its acceptance by the people ot thf ai
ted Statea, and iti provisions were wholly
inadequate for the settlement of grave
wrongs that had been sustained by thia
government aa well a by its citizeur,. Tho
injuries resulting to the United Slates by
reason af the courae adopted by Great
Britain duriag our late civil war, increaatd
rates of insurance in the diminution cf ex-
parts and import and other obstructions
to domestic industry and production, in its

COLLECTION OF TUB REVENUE.
On my assuming the responsibilities of
Chief Magistrate of the United States, it was
with the conviction that three things were
essential to its pesce, prosperity and fullest
development. Eirrt . among these is atrict
' ittleiriifr In fulfilling all our obBgatipns.
rtJecontt, TO Secnre protection to tlic person
and property of the citizen of our common
country, wherever he may chooso'to move,
without reference to original nationality, re
ligion, color or politics, demanding 0f him
only obedience to the "lawsand proper Ye-"
siH-ct for the rights of others. Third, A
' union of all ' the States, with equal rights,
indestructible" ""by any unconstitutional
means.
To secnre the first of thesd Congress has "
taken two essential steps : First, in declar
ing by joint resolution that the public debt
should bo paid, principal and interest, in
coin. Second, by providing means for pay
ing; providing the means, however, could
not secure the object desired without proper
administration of the laws for collection of
the revenues and economical disbursement
of them. To this subject the administra
tion hns most earnestly addressed itself,
with results, I believe, satisfactory to the
country. There has been no hesitation in
changing officials in order to secure the ef
ficient execution of the laws. Sometimes,
too, where, in a mere party view, undesira
ble political results were likely to follow
for any hesitation in sustaining efficient
officials against remonstrances wholly poli
tical. It may be well to mention here em
barrassments possible to arise from leaving
on the statute books the ao-called tenure-of-office
act, and to earnestly recommend
its total repeal. It coald not have been the
intention ot (be framers of the Constitu
tion, when providing that appointments
made by the President should receive the
consent of the Senate, that the latter should
have the power to retain in office persons
placed there by Federal appointments'
against the will of the President. The law .
is inconsistent with a faithful and efficient
administration of the government. What
faith can the Executive put in officials
forctd upon him, and those, too, whom he
has suspended for reason ? How will such
officials be likely to serve an administration
which they know does not trust themt
For the Becond requisite to our growth and
Erosperity, time and opinion will affirm ;
ut a humane administration of existing
laws, amended from time to time, as they
may prove ineffective, or prove harsh and
unnecessary, are probably all that are re
quired. The third cannot be attained by
special legislation, but must be regarded as
fixed by the constitution itself, and grad
ually acquiesced in by force of public
opinion.
TUB INDIANS.
From the foundation of the Government
to the present the management of the ori
ginal inhabitants of this continent, the In
dians, has been the subject of embarrass
ment and expente, and has been attended
with continuous robberies, murder and
wars. From my own experience upon the
frontiers and Indian countries, I do not
iol! either legislation or the conduct of
tht. whites who come most in contact with
Indians blameless for these hostilities. The
last, however, cannot be undone, and
the question must be met as we now find
it. I have adopted a new policy towards
these warda of the nation they cannot be
regarded in any other light than as wards
with fair results so far as tried, and which
I hope will be attended ultimately with
great aucceat. The Society ef Friends is
well known aa having succeeded in living
in peace with the Indians in the early set
tlement of Pennsylvania, when their white
neighbors of other sects in other sections
were constantly embroiled. They are also
known for their opposition to all strife, vio
lence and war, and are generally noted for
their strict integrity and fair dealings.
Thue conaiderationa induced me to riva
the management of a few reservations of
Indians to them, and to throw the burden
of the selection of agents upon the society
itself, and the result has proven most satis
factory. It will be found more fully Bet
forth in the Report of the Commissioner of
Indian - Affairs. For superintendents and
Indian agents not on reservations, officers
of the army were elected. The reasons for
thia are numerous. When Indian agents
are aent there or near there, troops must be
sent also. The agent and the commander
of the troops are independent of each oth
er, and are aubject to orders from differ
ent departments of the Government. The
army officer holds a position for life, the
agent one at the will of the President. The
former is personally interested in living in
liarmony with the Indian and the estab
lishment of permanent peace, to the end
that aome portion of Lie life may be spent
wuuin me limits oi a civiiizea section ; tne
latter has no such personal inttrest. An
other, reason ia an economic one, and still
another, the bold which the government has
upon a life officer to secure a faithful dis
charge ofdutics. In carrying out a given
policy the" building of railroads and the ac
cess thereby given to all the agricultural
: aid mineral regions of their country ia rap
idly bringing civilized aettlemeote in con
tact with all tribes of Indians. No matter
what ought to be tho relations betwecu
such settlement and the aborigines, the fact
is, they do not harmonise well, and one or
the other baa to give way in the end. A
system which looks to the extermination
of a race is toohorible for a nation to adopt
Without entailing upon itself the wrath of
all Christendom, and engendering in the
citizen a disregard for human life and the
rights of others dangeroas to society. I see
no substitute for sach a system except in
placing a!l the Indiana oa large reserva
tions, as rapidly as can be done, and giving
them absolute protection there as soon as
tkey are fitted for it. They should be in
duced to take their lands severally and set
up territorial geveramenta for their own
protection. Tor full dettila on this subject I

j THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
' The report of the Postmaster General
furnishes a clear and comprehensive exhibit
of the operations of the potl service, and
of the financial condition of this part of the
post office department. The ordinary postal
revenues for the year ending the 3oth of
June, 18C9, amounted to f 18,344,510, and
the expenditures to $'23,6&!t,l Jl, showing an
excess cf expenditures over receipts of 53,
630,30, the excess of expenditures over re
ceipts for the previous y e-r, was $8 1,379,92 ;
the increase of revenue of 1809 over those
of 1808 was $2,031,909, and the increase
ot expenditures was f 907,538. The increas
ed revenue in 1SC9 exceeds the increased
revenue in 18C8 by $Wb,336, and the in
crease of expenditures in 1S09, was $2,r27,
570 leas than the expenditures in 1807,
showing by comparison, this gratifying fea
ture of improvement, that while the increase
ot expenditures over the increase of receipts
In 1808 was 12,439,525, the increase of re
ceipts over the increase of expenditures in
1809 was I,04.371. Your attention is
lespectfully called to the recommeudationa
made by the Postmaster General, for au
thority to change the rate of compensation
to the main trunk railroad lines for their
services in carrying the mails, for having
post route maps executed, for recognizing
and increasing the efficiency of social
agents, for the increase of mail service on
the Pacific, and for establishing mail ser
vice under the flag of the Union on the
Atlantic, and mobt especially do I call your
attention to his recommendation for the
total abolition of the franking privilege;
this is an abuse from which no one receives
a commensurate ail vantage. It reduces the
receipts for postal service from twenty-five
to thirty percent., and largely increases the
service to be performed.
POSTAOK O PUBLIC MATTERS.
The method by which postage should be
paid upon public matter is set forth fully in
the report of the Postmaster General.
ITHLIC LANDS.
The report of the Secretary of the Inter
ior shows that the ouantitv of Dublin land
disposed of during the year ending the 30th
. C T 1 UPft -- w .... .
n June, xouj, was i,w),iiz acres, exceed
ing that of the proceeding year bv 1,010,
400 acres. Of this amount 2,897,544 acres
were sold for cash, and 2,737,365 acres
under the homestead law?. The remainder
was granted to aid in the construction of
the work of interna! improvements, approv
ed to the States aa swamp land, and located
by warrants and scrip. The cash receipts
lrom all sources were $4,472,886, exceed-
ing tnose oi the previous year, $2,840,140.
TENSION LI8T.
' During the last fiscal year, 23,196 names .
were added to tho pension rolls, and 4,886
dropped therefrom, leaving at its close,
187,963. The amount paid to pensioners,
including the compensation of disbursing
agents, was, $28,422,884, an iacrease of
$441,192 on that of the previous year. The
munificence of Congress has been conspicu
ously manifested in in its legislation tor the
soldiers and sailors who suffered in the re
cent atruggla to maintain that unity of gov
ernment which makes us one people. The
addition to the pension rolls of each succes
sive year since the conclusion of hostilitiea
results in a great degree from the repeated
amendments of the act of the 14th of July,'
1862, which extended its provisions to cases
not within its original scope. The large out
lay which ia thus occasioned is further in
creased by the more liberal allowance be
stowed since that date upon those who, in
the line of duty, where wholly or perma
nently disabled.
Public opinion bas given an emphatic
sanction to these measures of Congress, and
it will be conceded that no part of our pub
lic burden ia more cheerfully borne than
that which is imposed by tbis branch cf
the service. It necessitates for tho next
fiscal year, in addition to the amount justly
chargeable to the naval pension fund an ap
propriation of $30,000,000.
During the year ending April 30th, 1800,
the Patent Office issued 13,7.12 patents, and
its receipts were $086,389, being $213,929
more than the expenditures.
. TUB FKXSDMKN.
I would respectfully call your attention
to the recommendations of tho Secretary of
the Interior for uniting tho duties of super
vising the education- of freedmen with the
other duties devolving upon the Commis
sioner of Education. If it is the desire of,.
Congress to make
THE C1ANHUH,
vrhich must be taken during the year 1870,
more complete and perfect than hereto
fore, J. would suggest early action upon any
plan that may tie agreed upon. As Con
gress, at tho last cession appointed a com. ,
mittco to take into consideration such
lijcasurea ee might be deemed proper in t& ,
foresee to tho cenouc, nnd te veporl a plan,
