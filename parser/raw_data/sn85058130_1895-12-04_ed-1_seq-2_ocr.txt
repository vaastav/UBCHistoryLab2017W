ATLANTA Ga Dee SCord as was
the weather tonight the welcome extended
tended to Secretary of the Interior
Smith on his appearance before the
general assembly to discuss the finan
cial question wa of the warmest
Standing room only was available in
the hal of the house of representatives
tives where both branches of the leg
slature sat and loud and lengthy ap
T4ause made frequent interruptions Jn
Ins remarks
The secretary had been invited to
Jiscuss The Issues of thE Day t
like exSpeaker Crisp who spoke be
fota the same body two weeks ago ho
tonfiied himself to the money ques
tion taking strong ground against the
free and unlimited coinage of silver
and defending the course of the admin
iStration In financial matters Mr
Smith gave a running review of the
history of currency in this country
Ii3 was not against silver He wanted
just a many gold and silver or paper
dollars circulated in this country as
could be kept as Rood as any other
dollar He endorsed the bimetallic pol
icy of Thomas Jefferson he said but
ho did jiot agree with the bimetallic
fallacy of Coin Harvey and he ar
gud elaborately to show that the free
atd unlhnited coinage of both gold and
silver at the present ratio would re
bult In the establishment of the silver
standard and the disappearance of all
our gold The tide of population and
of capital was now setting toward the
south and the southern people of all
others had occasion to dread a revo
lution
Free coinage will benefit no one and
work vast hardships to all and espec I
ially to the cotton planter of the
south who would have to sell their
cotton at a gold standard price and
buy their goods at an inflated silver
Standard valuation
The most significant part of Secre
tary Smiths address was his refer
ence to state banks The repeal of the
10 per cent ta on their circulation
would he believed be one remedy for
our nancial ills He took pleasure
in tPlung nis auditors that of a great
number of great lawyers In the na
tioral cltl with whom he was a
sociated all were agreed that the pro
hibitory tax was unconstitutional
Prfsident Cleveland and Secretary
Carlisle had both recommended its re
peal ta the last Congress and their
recommendations would have been re
newed but It would have been use
less to appeal to the present Congress
for such action
The secretary closed by announcing
h assurance that the next national
convention would take advanced
ground against free coinage and coun
seliug calmness of discussion and har
m with party lines ro that after
tie battle was over there might not
be too many scars

BILL XYES FARCE
Collaborating with anl Potter
Flayivrltlne la Prisons
Bill Nye Is going to try again to
utilize his humor in a farce His first
attempt was an utter failure He talk
ed the other day about the second
which has taken the form of A Stag
Party and is in rehearsal for early
production It Is a collaboration with
Paul Potter lometlmes I fancy
said Mr Nye that Potter looks upon
humor as a sort of literary varnish that
can be applied with a brush whenever
and wherever it may be deemed neces
sary I know he has a pleasant habit
of handing me the manuscript of a
scene and saying Here old man just
put a littel repartee in that will you
Sometimes I have fancied from his
manner that he expected me to do it
while he waited just as If he were hav
ing his hat blocked I have found out
already that there is a great deal of
difference between a joke that is in
tended for the stage and one that is
intended for publication In a magazine
or newspaper In the theater you have
no time to roll a good bit of humor
under your tongue or to hear it over
again whereas if you come across
something funny in a book you can go
back and read it over again and study
Us subtleties and enjoy it at your lies
ure Dr Holmes whose humor by the
way was of the kind that will bear the
closest of study said that a lecture was
never thoroughly successful until it
had been delivered about 100 times and
had been shorn of all the things that
the man who wrote the lecture and de
livered It considered clever and en
riched with all the cheap and obvious
jokes that he could pick up in the
course of his travels
Well I have conscientiously tried to
put some original jokes into my work
although It has been a sore temptation
to get even with the farce comedies
and comic operas which have been us
ing my stuff for the last ten or fifteen
years Potter and I have worked to
gether very harmoniously although we
have been separated from one another
during the period of our collaboration
by a great many hundred miles of
space He does the trunk and branches j
of the dramatic tree and I put on the
foliage You must really see Potter
and get some of his ideas on dramatic
construction He claims that every
man can become his own dramatist if 1
he will only study the Potter rules of
Instruction I must say too that he
Is always willing to let other people
profit by his experience and his latest
scheme is to teach in Cooper union
What do you mean by that
Well he has a very praiseworthy
and charitable plan for helping the
citys poor A great many intelligent
young men are either out of employ
ment or else working for very meager
wages and Potter purposes to open a
class at the night school and teach
them the trade of play writing He
tells me that at the end of the winter
he will have several dozen strong and
healthy young men hard at work writ
Ing plays for Palmer and the Froh
mans and making excellent wages
and that in the course of a few years
there will be a chair of dramatic in
struction in every trade school In the
land Now I like his idea very much
but there is one thing that fills me
with grave apprehension I am afraid
that in the course of time playwrit
tog will be introduced Into the prisons
and that managers in need of new com
edies or farces will go to the prison
contractors for them and they will
send up to Sing Sing where they can
be made more cheaply than by work
men who go free and obliged to pay
board bills As a humorist I have
never suffered from this sort of com
petition and I hope I shall not be If I
become a dramatist New York Sun
CCTTIJTGS
Quite a number of plants are readily
propagated from cuttings These can
be made in the fall after the leaves j
have fallen With a large number of
trees and plants in the fall or early
winter is a good time to do the neces
sary pruning or cutting back and
when this is done much of the beat
wood can be saved for cuttings Only
sound healthy young wood should be
selected cutting Into suitable lengths
six to ten inches long according to
the variety There should be three or
four eyes or buds on each cutting tie
Into bundles each variety and kind to
itself and properly label One plan
of keeping is to store In boxes filling
the space between them with sand and
then store in a cellar A very good
plan of management is to bury them hi
a loamy tract of well drained soil
leaving one bud above ground anti
then carefully mulching or covering
with straw or forest leaves Then In
the spring they can be > taken up and
set where they are wanted

A THOUGHT
I i THAT KILLED
A MAN
He thought that he could trifle with
disease He was run down in health
felt tired and worn out complained ot
dizziness bllllousness backaches and

out of order He thought to get well
by dosing himself with cheap pUs
And then came the ending He frit a
victim to Brlghts disease The nKney
he ought to have Invested in a safe
reliable remedy went for a tombstone
The thought that killed this man
HAS KILLED OTHERS
I Statistics shoW that SO per cent of
the deaths from pneumonia Brights
disease and similar complaints are
I caused from derangements of the liver
and kidneys These great organs keep
the blood pure and in healthful mo
tion When they get put of order the
blood becomes poisoned the circulation
Impeded and the whole system speedily
breaks down I Is
A DANGEROUS DEAsS
to Imagine that pills can strike sS the t
root of these diseases I has been
thoroughly proved that such remedies
are worse than useless There is only
one remedy which can always be de
pended upon This remedy alone can
act on the liver and kidneys when
they are out of order clear out the
system and build up the healtbJThe
name of this remedy is Warners Safe

In the world for kidney and liver com
plaints I is tire only remedy which

KENTUCKY HUMOR
Some Anecdotes of Hiimplircr her
shall Soldier and Conprreviman
Edward J McDermott In an article
entitled Fun ore the Stump ln the
Century relates the following
Just before the war Humphrey Mar
shall was a great debater in Congress
During the war he was a confederate
general He was very large and stout
a veritable Falstaff At the breaking
out of the war he wrote to an officer
of the north and warned him not to
invade the sacred soil of Kentucky
for if he did he would have to pass
over the dead body of Humphrey Mar
shall The northern officer replied
Dear general we wont pass over
your dead body We prefer to Ci el
through
After the war the general hid a
good practice bat he was extravagant
and often In need of money Once he
was dogged by a collector who had
been put off dozens of times At last
the collector said General you have
said to me time after time I cannot
pay you this week Come next Now
I cant afford to be coming here all
the time You must fix the day When
will you be able to pay me Dn
it sir said the general do you think
I am a prophet
When the general was running for
j Congress against Mr Blank after
j the war he tried to draw out Mr
I Blanks exact opinions by a close de
bate on the stump In such an intel
lectual conflict few men could com
pete with Humphrey Marshall Mr
Blank parried and fenced as well as
he could Finally Marshall said one
evening in his ponderous tones and
Impressive manner r
Fellow citizens I have tried pin
Mr Blank down and make him give
mp a fair statement of his opinions
and principles but he flits about so
nimbly that it is Impossible to follow
him In an argument In dodging a
debate he reminds me of a bobolink
flitting along a zigzag worm fence
hopping or flying first on one side oC
the fence and then on the other until
the mind is bewildered and It Is Im
possible to tell on which side he is at
any moment
