HiCkey, Lennon etAl. Hot "Afraid of
Action Western League May y
Take at Meeting
Today.
Today the magnates of the Western
| league ef 1901? meet at St. Joseph,: and, if
William Rourke, president of the Omaha
; club, is to be believed, ; these , aforesaid
magnates, or a party of them,? will kick
into smithereens the American associa
tion dream that Thomas Jefferson Hick-
I ey, George Lennon^ A. B. Beall, George
..Tebeau and several others have been en-
Joying. - ~?" ?A ?? -A '?/"*?.
A Rourke's position at this period of the
game appears a peculiar one/? Last week
:.the' Omaha man appeared? in : Chicago,
with the other men V who formed the ■
American association, and,? according to
excellent authority, Rourke,'/.'with, the
other men, deposited $500 forfeit to go
through the season as a member of the
I new association. Now Rourke is back
in Omaha, and to the newspapers there
he has announced that he wants the old
': .Western ? league .".- to be continued, - and
. .thatf he, with Van. Brunt, . Burns and
'"others,* Intends to fight? the new associa
tion organized by Hickey, Lennon and
Tebeau.- A..- .-;■:... ?-'?: -?":'.
O'Ronrke In ('notions. "
The natural supposition is that Rourke
is playing the cautious boy in this little,
baseball war,, if. it may be styled ?a; war.
The Omaha magnate was not at all anx
ious to. push Omaha into a stronger cir
cuit. Omaha fan..tics turn out to see
Western league ball, and a wise magnate
would not care to increase his yearly ex
: pense to secure the money that will bs
..his with a Western league outfit. '"-A" A
y Rourke wans to continue in the base
ball business. He could not anticipate
the future of the old Western league
: when the new association talk started, so
he went in with the promoters of the
A new circuit. This move assured, the
I Omaha man a landing place, no matter
r what' nappened, but he was still of the
"opinion that he' could make good money .
with cheaper ball and he turned to the
men, who were pushed . into a second
class, minor league by the birth of the
new association. -"'A
$ -All. this is Rourke's supposed position,
and now the question is, will the play
come out right for.William Rourke? At
the present" writing, just before the meet
ing of the old Western league magnates,
.Bourke looks the loser.
..- The new association was not overanx
ious to take. Omaha into the new organi
zation, and, even if Omaha was to go in,
there? were several other Omaha business
men waiting to take Rourke's place In
-the Pat Crowe village baseball world.
Rourke was taken into the new organi
zation mainly because Hickey,-Lennon,
. T. •iii anil l>ali wanted to take care
of as many of the old. associates as
possible Also, he may: have been taken
in because' his \ote might be. needed
when the magnates of the old Wester** ■
.mo:}' tfi \< tc/ ijon the- question of dis
banding. ?'/
■ r.turke may have figured out this last
supposition himself, and bis :>s*- :res may
. have demonstrated to him where he held
the situation in his hand. It is now evi
dent that if Rourke figured thusly he
made a serious mistake, and a mistake
that may land him and his Omaha fran
chise where he insists he desires to be—
in' the Western league,; with .Colorado
Springs, Denver, Dcs Moines, Lincoln
and the other smaller towns.
Have Enough Votes.
7 At the meeting today Rourke will dis
cover, if he attempts to desert the new
association," that he does not hold the
balance ' of- power. The Western league
promoters of the new association appear
to have enough votes to control the situa
tion. Tebeau will vote for Kansas City,
and, as the press dispatches announce
that Packard has turned.over the Denver
franchise" to the Kansas City man, Te
beau will also vote for Denver. Beall,
of Minneapolis, appears to be with the
new association, and he? will vote for
that town. George Lennon's vote will
make the total four, and Hickey will
thus have the vote to decide " things.
There is no ? question as to which way
• the league president win? cast his ballot.
But even admitting that Rourke and
! his friends control the meeting, it is im
possible to see where Rourke will be
able to stop the new association and save
the $500 that he must forfeit if he does
not. go through the season in the new
league. Lennon .Tebeau, Beall and other
" magnates of the old Western, cannot be
;stopped If they desire to withdraw from
the old league. The business of the
league has all been closed up. -here
are no deposits or forfeits up, and if
the magnates looking for advanced base
ball, desire to leave the old league, there
is nothing apparent in their way to pre
. vent them.

fer of : the franchise 7was ? announced to

March :6,' at Detroit, for the v. schedule

This . question occupied the . greater .' part
of today's session, which began at noon
and /continued, with two ? recesses," until
10:30 tonight., A: Henry Killilea took a firm
stand ""against ' continuing ?in "; baseball Aif
Milwaukee was dropped from the league,
deemed advisable by a majority :of z the
magnates.V?He7wished his .brother,- who
has been in poor, health, to .do likewise
andir retire from baseball. That was the
programme originally outlined, but .MAR;*
Killilea ? showed a marked.' antipathy." to
retiring, and, ?as a ..result,.?_his| brother,
Henry, who- had . not -previously j attended
the meeting, came from % Milwaukee j. oh
an : afternoon ' train. -Both brothers \ felt
strongly on 7 the j subject, but ?M. .R. /Killi
lea, who has "always-been connected with
the club in Milwaukee, refused -to give
up his holdings. 7"Accordingly, • Henry said
he would sell? his interest, as Milwaukee
was his home town and: he did not wish
to jbe interested ? else where; The terms of
the sale were/not- made r?public.AM.7 R.
Killilea .will, make St. Louis his head
quarters during the. playing: season," and
McAleer? will continue as manager. yA
Besides discussing. 7 the 7various' phases
of the St. - Louis club; the league took a
firm stand on the question of betting on
the result of games by spectators. This
was reported to have' grown almost to a
practice in 'some cities, "notably.';: Boston.
At the # close of the meeting Ban Johnson
announced that every effort would be
made toy suppress the evil; and that spec
tators caught ?in the act would be led "to
the ; gates, their money refunded - and ; their
absence.thereafter solicited. - ■'-'■'.. ;-~ ■-,AA.
"■ | President Johnsoji admitted" that he had
received a letter from,:Manager..Collins,
of Boston, asking that Pitcher Dineen's
name be taken from the blacklist.??- ?7y. .
• Johnson said he was | willing to do ?so
.and" that if Collins wanted Dirieen?7 he
.would be free to sign. ; He-explained his
action by saying. that he had the highest
regard for : Collin's, who had been offered
a large salary by. the Boston -National;
League club to jump his American -league
contract, but . had -? remained" - steadfast.,
Therefore,. Johnson argued: he was 'en
titled \to consideration, and | as j Boston
.was the club from' which • Dineen. jumped 7
back to the National 7 league, he was will
ing.^to-forgive him if 7 Collins did. it Is
understood: that Baltimore has offered
Boston the '■ choice of J either Nops or
Foreman gratis. Managers Mack ' and
McAleer were in conference i the great- \
er part of the afternoon and it was sup-
posed a trade was likely, but nothing was
accomplished. *? It ls * said | trie: two man
agers agreed upon \ what - players to 7go
after and. divided the.' list;-AA .7
; While > the rr regular 7 season will ~ open
April 23, Baltimore will probably begin
the 1902 baseball year ;at . Boston, * April;

--Comiskey - stated 7 today that he - had
signed-ai third, baseman for the' coming

..The; excuse of Heidrick and. Wallace
for their desertion of Comiskey last? year
became known 7 today.. -1 They | asserted
that ? Griffith was ;to keep the ' matter - a
secret j asl at - the time Heidrick ' signed a

such,action was" contrary to rules of the

The story became known 1 and both "men
