Berlin, Dec. 6. The negotiations be

nounces. Returns Loan for Roumania.
Washington, Dec. 6. The Russian
ambassador has returned to the treas
ury the $5,000,000 given to him for ad
vance to Roumania. K
It was explained at the Russian em
bassy that it was impossible to have
the money changed into rubles by the
Russian State bank at Petrograd.
The original plan was to have the
Russian ambassador here receive the
funds in dollars and then to Issue an
order on the Petrograd State bank to
transfer to the Roumanian account the
value In rubles, Reports of the Russo
German armistice extending to Rouma
nian troops probably will defer dispo
sition of the money. .
Acted Without Instructions.
The state department officially de
clared that both Lieutenant Colonel
Judson, head of the American military
mission in Russia and MaJ. M. .C.
Kerth, military attache at the Ameri
can embassy, acted without Instruc
tions from this government in present
ing communications to the bolshevik!
government on the attitude of the Unit
ed States toward the effort to effect a
separate peace with Germany. ,
Major Kerth's communication was a
protest to the Russian ,comrnnt?:?er in
ernei . uganifct an armistice.--., uoionei
Judson's communication was co'uthed
in more Umient terms. The action of
the two officers was taken in view of
circumstances and not on Instructions
from Washington. " J
The state department had no dis
patches from Russia. It has previous
ly announced that the attitude of this
government toward the bolshevlkl Is
one of tolerance, hoping to preserve
what progress has been made toward
democracy In Russia rather than risk
throwing the country back Into the
hands of an autocracy by drastic ac
tion. Says Russia Will "Come Back."
London, Dec. 6. The situation In
Russia is unique In history, according
to the Petrograd correspondent of the
Morning Post, writing Saturday, but It
Is not yet advisable to attempt to raise
the curtain upon the "mysteries of the
tragl-comlc drama."
The correspondent Insists that "Rus
sia will right herself if generously al
lowed the necessary latitude by, the
puzzled allies, and next spring will put
new armies In the field to fight the In
vader with the success that marked
the Russian efforts earlier In the war."
"In the meantime," he adds, "the sit
uation Is extremely curious. Some
force which is above or beyond all the
contending parties Is putting the
spokes into the wheels of all of them."
The correspondent Instances the va
rious Interferences with the adminis
tration without, however, elucidating
his suggestion. -
1 Kornlloff Escapes Foes.
General Kornlloff, the former com
mander In chief, who escaped from the
bolshevlkl at Mohllev, according to a
Petrograd dispatch to the Dally Mall,
was accompanied by 400 Caucasian
troops. He was at Orsha, north of
Mohllev, on Monday.
The military revolutionary commit

general advance of 15 per cent in
freight rates."
In a special communication transmit
ted to the congress, the commission
declares that one of two things mus
be done to put American railroads fl
an operating basis that will expedll"
the winning of the war:
First The pooling of every railros 1
In the country Into one mammoth sy.--tern,
to be operated under the direeth n
of some central body to be designate
by congress, and the temporary ' si
pension of anti-trust laws now prohib
iting such mergers.
Second The taking over of the i n
tire American railroad system by tin
president and Its operation as a win'
measure. ,
Speedy action Is demanded by the
commission. This Is no time for "tem
porizing," the lettpr states. .,
" Action Absolutely Necessary.
It is absolutely necessary, the com
mission's report says, that the rail
roads of the country be operated as
a unit. One proposal Is that the rail
roads themselves might pool their in
terests and operate them as a unit.
But the real proposal of the commis
sion Is that the carriers be operated
as the road by President Wilson. The
commission's report, snys it follows
that the government must finance the
railroads and 'extricate them from
their present entanglements.
It adds it will be necessary, what
ever course is taken by congress, that
the government regulate Issues of se
curities. In the event of the seizure
taking place the commission affirms
that the government should take steps
to guarantee proper return to all In
vestors' on all present outstanding
stocks and bonds of the roads.
It had been rumored about Wash
ington that the commission would
hand down a decision in the freight
rate increase case and the communi
cation, when It was made public, came
as a distinct surprise.
' Sabath Would Include Mines.
For many weeks government owner
ship and operation of the carriers has
been talked of but none supposed the
commission was ready to recommend
such action. The letter followed close
upon the Introduction of a resolution
In the house by Representative Sabath
of Illinois thot proposed that the gov
ernment take over not only the oper
ation of the railroads but of coal mines
as well.
Secretary McAdoo to control vessels.
Washington. President Wilson
gave Secretary McAdoo absolute au
thority over every vessel moving in
territorial waters of, the United States.
In a proclamation the President em
powered the Secretary of the Treasury
to control the movements and anchor
age of any vessel, foreign or domestic.
Customs officers or other agents of the
treasury may board such vessels at
any time, search them, place guards
on them, or, when necessary, take full
possession and remove the crews and j
others on board. "

London Papers Approve Peace
Based on the Exclusion of
Selfish Claims.
fffiY YET SAVE THE RUSSIANS
If Message Does Not Influence Ger
man Opinion, Only Resort Is to In
flict Such Military Defeat That
Rulers Will Be Convinced.
London, Dec. 6. President Wilson's
message to congress has the fullest
possible prominence in the newspa-
pers, but It reached London too late
I for much considered comment.
The Daily News receives warmly the
president's declaration that peace
should be based on generosity and Jus
tice to the exclusion of selfish claims.
It adds :
"It would be affectation to pretend
that this Inngunge echoes the declara
tions of the European spokesmen of
the alllnnce. It Is the voice of a states
man whose vision comprehends the
world, while theirs comprehends only
half a world.
Might Have Been Saved to Allies.
"If President Wilson could have
said earlier what he said yesterday,
and if in Great Britain, France and
Italy the responsible leaders had made
his language their own, Russia might
be today driving the enemies from her
borders. It may be too late to con
vince Russia of the Identity of aim
of herself and the allied democracies,
but it must not be tod late for those
democracies to learn from their great
est representative how democracies
should comport themselves In war and
how they should attain peace.
"In the light of President Wilson's
speech, a statement that will mean the
wiping otf the , slate of much that
Is Imperative, There is no kinship be
tween the spirit of yesterday's speech
itid the spirit of knockout blows or
economic warfare or after the war
boycotts."
No Half-Tones in Address.
The Times says there are no half
tones in the president's address, add
ing: "Thorfl ni- n n nmhtminnQ nlirnapci nn !
which militarists may feed the Illu
sions of their dupes, no hints of coin
promise and no suggestion of faltering
or doubt to raise the spirits of the
pucilic . . . With this straightfor
ward and logical statement of Amer
ica's war aims the last hope of the
pacifists must founder."
The Times reiterates that formerly
it expressed dissent with President
Wilson's distinctions between the Geiv
man people mid their ruler and snys it
can no more distinguish between them
than the president cnii any longer dis
tinguish between Germany and Austria-Hungary,
believing them willing
accomplices of their ruler.
The editorial of the Daily Chronicle
Is mainly a paraphrase of the speech
In a sympathetic tone and without a
definite expression of opinion.
Doubts Effect on Germans.
"Whether this restatement," says the
Dally Graphic, "so lofty in spirit, so
forward looking in effect, will have
any Influence on German opinion is
doubtful. Then the only resort Is to
inflict such a military defeat upon Ger
many as to convince the Germans of
the lnfamousness of their rulers. In
this connection It Is ah excellent omen
that the conference In Paris reached
such a complete unanimity. America
was represented at that conference and
there follows that the war alms of the
allies no longer can be described In
any sense as Imperialistic."
None of the editorials dwells espe
cially on the request for a declaration
of war against Austria-Hungary, but
brief references Imply that it Is regard
ed as logical and desirable.

London, Den. 6. Cardinal Bourne,
archbishop of Westminster, has com
municated to the Morning Post a
statement from Cardinal Gasparri, the
papal secretary of state, answering the
Post's accusation that the Vatican was
implicated in disruptive propaganda in
Italy and is unneutral.
Cardinal Gasparri declares that the
accusation Is an "atrocious calumny"
and that the heirarchy and clergy In
Italy have given the most open and
most' generous help to the country's
cause, and have received unreserved
praise from the Italian parliament and
government.
Long before the issuance of the pa
pal peace note, which is said to have
been among the chief causes of the
army's lowered morale, the clergy gen
erally and the army chaplains partic
ularly, he says, were laboring against
the destructive propaganda which had
been begun and was reported to be
giving unrest to the civil authorities.
The Post, In an editorial examining
Cardinal Gasparrl's statement, virtu
ally reiterates its original accusation
and cites Incidents which it regards as
proofs.
