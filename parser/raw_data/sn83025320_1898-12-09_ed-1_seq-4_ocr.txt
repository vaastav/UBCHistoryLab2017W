FRIDAY. DE('EMIIEIl 9, Io.
T TIE PR IEIDIENT' MESSAG~iE.
The annual message of President
McKinley to congress was presented
last Monday. It is an able document,
reviewing briefly all notable events
that transpired during the war, and
clearly states the present existing con
ditions. Everything is set forth
clearly, in plain language, and on
broad and non-partisan lines. The in
crease of the standing army and the
interests of labor receive brief recom
mendations, but the scheme of the In
diauapolis monetary convention is en
tirely left out, and no mention is
made regarding it. The message is a
straightforward presentment of the
affairs of the nation, in a business
like manner, and is characteristic of
the firm and impartial position which
marks the past record of the president.
The state board of canvassers has
completed its labors and Judge Brantly
has been declared elected chief justice
by a majority of 157.
TIlE ENDI O(i TIliE '.At.
Spain will sign the treaty. Every de
mand of the United States is conceded.
The protocol stands exactly as written.
The Philippines are ours. 'Their control,
disposition and form of government
have been determined and will be Amer
ican. Porto Rico is a part of our terri
tory, and Cuba is entirely released from
Spanish sovereign'y and claim. Thus
ends the war of 1898 with supreme tri
umph on the field of battle and in the
treaty nego iations. The power of the
people of !he Uni ed States in a right
eous cause has again been shown to the
world, and more impressively than ever.
It was no par y or faction that forced
the war. The people decreed it. Their
indignant sentiment swept over all bar
riers. They asked that the reign of
atrocity in ('tba be ended and, united in
nil! 'lo stat cs. pressed forward to fill the
reitirecnents of the governmen'. On
April 23d c'war was declared: on May 1
]) :.wey won a marvelous victory in Ma
nilla bay; on July 3 the Cervera fleet
was destroyed; before the month was
out Santiago surrendered with 24,000
men; on August 12 the protocol was
signed, and on November 28 the Spanish
peace commissioners assented to the
treaty proposed. The war lasted 219
days, a few days beyond seven months.
Among the ballots rejected at Garnet
was one where the voter had marked
circles in place of crosses opposite the
names of the several candidates on the
Silver Republican ticket. The court
held that the ballot was legal and
should be counted. Judge Durfee jok.
ingly remarked that this voter must have
been an A. P. A. and opposed to the sign
of the cross.
The president's message is before
congress and Charlie Hartman has
proclaimed his disapproval. Mr. Hart
man is subject to a chronic desire to
fnd fault with or object to everything
done in congress, and if his influence
would be as far-reaching as his gall,
we should not be at all surprised to
learn of the message being referred
back to the president for correction, to
meet Mr. Hartman's views. How
ever, our Charlie is one of those un
fortunate . amples who kick about
everything but accomplish nothing.
WILL ADVANCE SILVEIR'S CALME.
Several Democratic papers have just
discovered what The Mail has claimed
and advocated for months past. Now
that the acquisition of the Philippine
group of islands by the United States is
a certainty they admit that silver is the
chief medium of exchange in our new
colonies and that for the be.t interests
of the peop'e and commerce ths islands
must remain on a silver basis. Just so;
their geographical situation, the pecu
liar needs of their residents and the
commercial rela ions exis ing with silver
using countries of the far east demand
that silver be used as money, and under
Republican rule it is safe to predict that
such will be the case. Not alone will
silver be used as money in our new colo
nies, but the cause of bimetallism will
also be advanced materially in the
United Sta'ee and the acquisition of the
Philippines is an Important step in that
direction. The success of the Republi
can party is also a victory for silver.
The residents of this state have cer
tainly no cause for complaint as far as
the conditions of the weather are con
cerned. For several weeks the Atlantic
coast and middle states have been sub
jected to the most terriffic storms known
in history, a; d many lives were lost
through sutffering from the intense cold;
while here in Montana we have enjoyed
excellent heather. Almost every one of
the old set lore of the state experience
the fac. when away from home that no
other state or country can beat Montana
cilmate at any season of the year, and
the remark is often heard that Mon
tana is a Paradise compared with many
other parts of the country.
VAI.UAIII.E IUSHIES.
An eastern paper prints an extract
from the director of the mint which
claims that silver has bean produced by
the Granite Mountain mining company
at a cost of 121 cen's per ounce. The
next thing we expect to learn is that sil
ver can be grown on bushes at consider
able less than the above figures since
the expense of mining would be saved
entirely. Over in the Philippines a
shrub has been discovered which pro
duces precious stones, and by some sys
tem of grafting it might be made to pro
duce silver. For an experiment, our
silver miners should import some of this
gem-growing shrubbery and by plant
ing a bush or two in the lower levels of
the Granite mine the product might be
silver instead of opals or diamonds. In
time the whole Granite hill cou'd be
covered with this kind of shrubbery and
all the expense attached to producing
silver would be the gathering in of the
crop.
BSALLOTS THAT WlER.E C'OUNTEI).
For the benefit of the public generally
and for the guidance of judges of elec
tion in the future we publish a few rul
ings that were made regarding the
marking of ballots in the contest case
or F. J. McDonald vs. George Metcalf,
involving the office of sheriff.
A ballot marked with a cross in the
circle at the head of the Democratic
ticket and also with a cross in the circle
at the head of the Populist ticket was
counted for Mr. McDonald, the Demo
cratic-Populist candidate, whose name
appeared on both tickets.
A ballot marked with a circle within
the circle, instead of a cross, at the head
of the Democratic ticket, was counted
for Mr. McDonald.
A ballot marked with small circles iL
stead of crosses, opposite and to the
right of the names of tLe
several candidates upon the Silver Re
publican ticket, was counted for Mr.
Metcalf.
A ballot marked with crosses oppo
site, but to the right of the names of toe
several candidates upon the Silver Re
publican ticket, was counted for Mr.
Metcalf.
A ballot marked with crosses opposite
the blank spaces just below the names
of the several candidates upon the Sil
ver Republican ticket was counted for
Mr. Metcalf.
A ballot marked with a cross in the
circle at the head of the Silver Republi
can and with a cross in the circle at the
head of the Republican ticket was
counted for Mr. Metcalf.
A ballot which had the names of
every candidate on the Silver Republi
can ticket (except Mr. Metcalf, whose
nanme was substituted by that of Mr.
F. J. McDonald) written in the blank
spaces below the printed names on the
Silver Republican, Democratic and Pop
ulist tickets, voting the same names on
all three tickets, with a cross opposite
each name, was counted for Mr. Mc
Donald.
The Democratic and Populist tickets
were a fusion upon the county offices

and the Silver Republican and Populist
tickets were fused on state officers. The
Republican tieket had only the state
officers upon it, there being no county
ticket under that head.
Col. Wilbur F. Sanders and W. E.
Moore appeared for George Metcalf, the
Silver Republican candidate, and Judge
D. M. Durtee, Wingfleld L. Brown and
Governor Bob Smith, represented Fin
lay J. McDonald, Democratic-Populist
candidate. Judge Woody, of Missoula,
acted as referee, and deciled what bal
lots should be counted.
TIHE ENEMIES OF BIMETALLISM.
John Lind, the recently elected Demo.
cratic guvernor of Minnesota, is quoted
as saying that the silver question was
settled in 1896, and that he proposed to
give the gold standard people a chance.
Mr. Lind is the first Democratic gov
error who has been elected in his
state in forty years, and during
the campaign his especial efforts were
directed against the principles of bimet
allism and he ooenly expressed his
views on that subject while a umping his
state. This is just another verifica'ion
of the assertion that silver was used
as an issue only in certain localities or
geographical spots by Ihe Democrats,
and for a double purpose. In silver
producing sections the Democrats ad
vocated free coinage and in other parts
of the country they were opposed to
free coinage ana in this manner they ex
pected to meet the demands of all and
carry the election. Now that the elec
tion is over they call this double dealing
good politics and glory in the result ac
complished in this state. There will be
other elections coming, however, in the
future. and the voters of Montana will
need no instructions as to which party,
if placed in power, will do most for the
cause of bimetallism, Which is wholly a
Republican issue, and will only be at
tained through the continued success of
that party.
KILLED A LARGE MOOSE.
A Rock Creek Resident Secures an El
egant Specimen.
The first moose killed in this county
this season is reported to be a prize se
cured by Mr. P. A. Shilling, of Ross'
Fork. The animal is said to be a very
large bull and an extra fine specimen.
Moose are pretty scarce, and a good
head is quite valuable.
Thomas Treveaille came up from
Missoula last Tuesday, on business that
required his attention.

Philipsburg, Mont., Dec. 7. 1898.
SCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT.
It Was Largely Attended and Proved a
Success in Every Way.
The entertainment given at the school
house last Friday evening proved a
complete success, financially and other
wise, and only about $89 more were
needed to pay for the piano, which is
already at the school house. The
school board decided to contribute the
missing $89 dollars, so the entire
amount may be paid at once. thereby
getting the benefit of a cash discount of
$25 The school will repay the amount
subscribed by the trustees from pro
ceeds of entertainments to be given in
the future.
Following is the condition of the
piano fund:
Proceeds of Bob Burdette entertainment.$ 6 50
Donated by Mrs. A. A. MoDonald ........ 500
Receipts from entertainment ............ 204 20
Donated by Mrs. Tessy Weinstein........ 10 00
$225 70
Less expenses for entertainment....... 14 60
$211 10
Contributed by trustees .......... ..... 8 90
$250 00
The original cost of the piano was
$315, but after deducting special and
cash discounts the net price is $250,
which amount has been provided as
above.
A throng of people filled the rooms
and corridors of the spacious school
house and all seemed anxious to con
tribute their share to provide a piano
for the high school. Our institution of
learning is rapidly establishing for it
self a reputation of which not alone the
district but the entire county may just
ly be proud, and the residents of the
district deem it a privilege to be per
mitted to contribute individually to
wards its success.
The special features of the entertain
ment were presented alternately in the
different recitation rooms up-stairs. In
the southeast room, Mrs. Darby's Wax
Works attiacted the attention of the
large audience. This department was
under the directorship of Miss M. C.
Ryan, and called forth no small
amount of commendation. In the north
east room the Ruggles family, in charge
of Mrs. R. Lee Kelley, was engaged in
entertaining the audience, and many
compliments were heard to the credit
of those taking part, and the able man
agement of the department. Another
feature of the entertainment that cre
ated considerable amusement, was Un
cle Sam and his recent acquisitions.
Mr. C. W. Cross, dressed in the regular
striped pantaloons, bespangled coat, and
white hat, acted the part of Uncle Sam,
and Miss Florence I aylor as Queen Lil;
Johnny Wilson, dressed like a Cuban,
and Carl Jacky as a Philippino, repre
sented his new colonies. They all re
ceived their share of praise and their
several parts were well carried out.
A candy department in one of the
recitation rooms did a flourishing busi
ness and the supply of the sweets was
exhausted long before the audience
commenced to disperse.
A flower booth, where bouquets were
sold, was equally well patronized and
the stock of posies was hardly sufficient
to meet the demand. Exceilent music
was furnished in the hall by Miss Piper,
of Pioneer, and Mrs. W. E. Moore and
J. T. Pardee, of this city. Delicious re
freshments, consisting of ice cream,
cake, coffee and sandwiches were served
in the southeast room on the first floor.
This department did a land office busi
ness, and the management deserves es
pecial mention and much credit for the
very satisfactory manner in which its
many patrons were entertained and
served. Prof. Cook and his corps of
teachers deserve much credit and the
highest praise for the, able manner in
which the entertainment was planned
and successfully carried out, and to the
generous public which so liberally con
tributed and assisted, either financially
or otherwise, are due the thanks of the
entire district.
COURT PROCEEDINGS,
Court convened Monday afternoon
and several important cases were tried
Tuesday and Wednesday, afrer which
adjournment was taken until next
Monday.
In cases of J. T. Cadle vs. F. J. McDonald et
al. and George W. Morse vs. Granite county,
