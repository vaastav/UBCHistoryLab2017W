THE REFORiltya of wall street.
Governor Hughes has appointed a
committee to collate facts, receive
suggestions and make recommenda
tions as to "what changes, If any, are
advisable in the laws of the state of
New York bearing upon speculation in
securities and commodities, or relat
ing to the protection of investors, or
with regard to tha instrunfentalltles
and organizations used in dialing with
securities or commodities which are
I the subject of speculation." In other
words, the governor has decided to
have Wall street probed, preparatory to
legislation designed to correct finan
cial and other abuses that may bo dis
covered to exist in the great specu
lative center.
There is some prospeet, but not
much hope, that the proposed inquiry
will result in putting an end to spec
ulative gambling In securities and
commodities, but much good may be
accomplished if the Investigation shall
result In exposing the methods by
which markets are "manipulated" and
worthless stocks unloaded upon an
uninformed public. In the abstract,
the Stock exchange is simply a com
,mon center where men buy and sell
ownership In the obligations of
cor
porations, Just as other men trade in
boots and shoes and sugar. In prac
tice, however, shrewd stock gamblers
often flood the market with bogus se
curities, while those who have large
holdings In corporations frequently
use their power to dominate financial
institutions and thus manipulate the
P.f 8 of their securities to the hurt
money market.
It is notorious, as illustrated in the
Morse case and in many others but
little less sensational, that various
abuses, which urgently demand re
form, have grown up in' connection
with the buying and selling of stocks
in the New York market. The action

AS VNFORTUNA1E DECISIOy.
uy decision of the state supreme
court, the law making extortion and
blackmailing a crime ln Nebraska has
I han AtrnrfA tnonnatftiitinnal ftnrf In-
I ud- Th, reaon by the
for its conclusion is that he law dis
criminates between cltlieus of this
state and other states. It is, there
fore, hold to be a class of legislation
prohibited by both- the state and fed
eral constitutions.
It happens that the particular case
ln which this decision is rendered
came up on a successful attempt by a
Lincoln lawyer to extort money from
a saloon keeper and, as we all know
the line of demarcation between
straight and crooked transactions dis
guised as lawyer's fees has t always
been very hazy. Had the law been
tested ln a case involving some rank
outsider caught red-handed in a black
mailing plot instead of a professional
gentleman pretending to demand
money for a client, the Judicial per
pectlve might have been clearer
I The overturning . ot -Nebraska's
criminal law Against extortion and
blackmail la unfortunate from what
ever viewpoint It Is loked at. . It la as
serted that this law is an exact copy
of a similar law enacted ln another
state, where it has been enforced apd
upheld in the courts. Be that aa it
jmay. the need ot auch a law Is clear,
and made clearer by tht, escape of the
blackmailing lawyer who has gotten
away from his Just deserts through
Judicial technicalities. If there Is any
wt of reconstructing this law so as
to make it air-tight and burglar-proof,
it should be done and put back on the
statute books in a perfected form by
the coming legislature.
IXDVSTRIAL WASTE.
Statistics Just compiled show that
more than 80,000 persona were killed
and more than 2,000,000 Injured in
industrial work In this country last
year, making an appalling list of
casualties, nearly one-half of which, it
is contended, might have been avoided.
The federal bureau of labor, which
makes the report, admits that the data
has been difficult to secure and that
the list aa given is probably much
smaller than the actual number of
deaths or Injuries In such accidents.
The report shows that in five years
over 10,000 men have been killed in
the steel Industries and the fatal ac
cidents among the anthracite miners
in Pennsylvania have averaged nearly
four to every 1,000 men employed.
The death roll from Industrial acci
dents for the year amounts to the
equal of thirty full regiments of sol
diers while the roll of the injured is
larger than the number of men en
gaged in the civil war. The bureau
charges that reckless disregard of or
dinary safeguards, the violation of
safety appliance laws and the pro
tective principles of everyday life have
made the laborer's share In this tre
mendous sacrifice of human life a very
heavy one. "While many of our in
dustrial accidents," says the report,
"may be the result of ignorance, reck
less Indifference or carelessness (of
the victim), the fact remains that an
immense amount of human life is
wasted."
Two important problems present
themselves as the result of this show
ing one relating to the needed re
forms for lessening accidents in indus
trial establishments, the other having
to do with ways and means by which
suitable insurance can be afforded to
workers in the Industries. President
Roosevelt has urged the general ex
tension of the employer's liability
laws for the benefit of the injured em
ploye, but preventive laws are also
needed. When Industrial establish
ments are made to bear the financial
loss ensuing from such accidents, the
responsible heads may be expected to
devise measures by which industrial
accidents will be reduced to a very
marked extent.
INTERESTING.
The report of John C. Wharton as
financial agent for the republican na
tional committee for Nebraska 1b In
terestlng. Mr. Wharton raised and
turned over to the assistant treasurer
at Chicago a little over $4,000 in a
period of scarcely four weeks and un
der restrictions that prohibited him
from soliciting corporations, office
holders and candidates for office. The
amount raised by Mr. Wharton and
put Into the national campaign fund
la properly to be deducted from the
amount which was given over by the
national committee to the state or
ganlzatlon.
It is to be noted that more than half
ot the money raised In Nebraska for
the national campaign, or to be more
exact, $2,362, was contributed by re
publicans ln Omaha and Douglas
county, while only $2$ was contribu
ted from Lincoln and Lancaster
county. Some of the smaller counties
made most creditable contributions
and the results, considering the condi
tions under which the money was
raised, prove beyond doubt that the
national campaigns of the future can
be successfully financed on a basis of
popular subscriptions without depend
ing on the corporation hand-outs and
big donations that made up the cam
paign funds ln former presidential
contests.
The rank and file of the republicans
are willing to pay the legitimate ex
penses of a political campaign and
want nothing in return except the as
surance of the benefits which all en
Joy alike under republican policies ap
plied by republican administrations.
TELEPHONES AND TRAIN DISPATCHING
The announcement that a number
of railroads contemplate the adoption
of telephones to replace the telegraph
in the dispatching of trains brings
the charge from the telegraphers that
the movement is designed to evade
compliance with the federal law re
lating to the hours of telegraph
operators and signalmen and that the
new plan, while it may be cheaper for
the railroads, will increase the risks
of travel. A railroad telegrapher, in
a letter to the Interstate Commerce
commission discussing the new plan,
says:
It would be ludlcroua, If It were not for
tbe aeriouaneaa of the matter, to aea how
audUenly the rallroade woke up to the fact
that the telephone la ao much superior to
the telegraph in the aafety and prompt
neaa of service, also how auddenly they die
covered the auperlorlty of the Inexperienced
$35 to 140 telephone operator to the experi
enced 100 to tti& telegraph operator.
Aa a matter of fact, the awakening lm
mediately followed the going Into effect
of the "hour of aervlce law" the 4th of
last March, which compelled the roada to
employ three operatora at aome atatlona
Inatead of two, aa formerly. By puttln
In three 'phone operatora at about $33 each
they aave the aalary of a third operator
at V& and aave $20 or $25 from the original
expense of the two men at 6i each. Tills
la a fair average. This ta the aecret of the
much-boasted success of the telephon
servlc that they claim haa been achieved
where It haa been experimented with. As
a matter of fact, the 'phones have proven
to be far from aurcessful. The 'phones on
long distance currents are nolay, difficult
to keep adjusted and unsatisfactory ln
many waya.
In opposition to this view, the rail
road managers cite the Burlington
which has been operating its Chicago
jdlrl.loa train by telephone tor some
time, reports satisfactory results. The
public will not be particularly con
cerned in the matter except to demand
that the safety of travelers be guarded
to the utmost. Competent train dis
patchers, whether telephone operators
or telegraphers, are Just as Important
to the traveler as the airbrake and
other safety appliances. However the
service may be changed or cheapened,
the public has a right to demand that
it shall not be Inefficient.
As chief of the army signal corps,
General Allen makes earnest recom
mendations for improvement and en
largement of that branch of the mili

terested In the signal corps branch of
the army because of the signal corps
post and training school at Fort
Omaha, and General Allen may count
on the moral support of our people in
his desire to make the signal corps
grow more efficient and more serv
iceable. The South Omaha live stock market
shows up a far greater per cent of In

CIRBEST POLITICAL COMMENT.
Sosne New aad Old Method of
Voting.
Philadelphia Press (rep.).
Our elections have come' to t-xhlblt a
variety and Inconsistency In the voting
which wer entirely unknown to our father
who used the single rrt poster ballot
In voting that ticket It was necessary to
vote for all the candidate ot th party
unless the voter mad erasures or covered
names with "stickers." This was done to
son-. extent, but It never created th wide
olscrepancle In the total vote of th sev
eral candidates that the Australian blanket
ballot ha brought upon us.
OrJy two state. New Jersey and Con
necticut,, retain th old style of ballot
Th ballot that ha to bo marked allows
th voter to vote for th candidates he Is
Interested in and to neglect th rest. If
he wishes to vote a split ticket h can do
so much more easily by the blanket ballot
than with the old single party ticket, and
it sticker. This Is true, even when th
single square or circle at th head of the
ticket facilitate straight party voting.
Th Massachusetts plan, by which all
candidates' name are listed alphabetically
and tha voter has to select and mark each
separate candidate for whom he desire to
vote, shows the widest discrepancies be
tween tha vote for the important and th
unimportant offices. It 1 th fairest plan,
as no votes ar cast by it except those tha
voter wants to cast and for Just those
person he wish to support Considera
tions of convenience do not make him vote
for those In whose political success he
feels no Interest
Th voting machines In us In fourteen
state Introduce another variety In voting.
There ar some who aea evil In this and
think there should be legislation to compel
uniformity In voting In all th states. There
la no merit in this suggestion. Each stats
is guaranteed a republican form of govern
ment, but tha manner of voting Is a detail
which each state Is free to make Its own
experiments with. We are Just now ex
perimenting on a large scale with blanket
ballot and In some state with th voting
machines. Neither ar free from objec
tions. Uniformity may bo desirable, but
It Is far better than uniformity that each
stat should have a voting system which
suits It and Is suited to It, and this system
It must work out for Itself.

Advice to th democratic party Is now
pouting forth Trom every after dinner pro
fessor of government. One say that the
party Is too radical and runs after falsa
gods, and another that it cannot get on
without the radicals; they agree that there
must be reorganisation, stability In Its
councils and a sane, progressive policy.
Mr. Bryan must walk th plank. Mr. Bryan
must be conciliated, and so on. On healer.
at his wits' ends, suggests a a-ood sov
ernment trust of prominent democrat to
watch the republican administration, and
secure th confidence of the peopl for tha
democratic party.
It Is true that stability, sanity and char
acter are the need of the aimless and
wandering democracy. Leader It must
have, but they cannot b appointed or
forced upon It. Leadership must grow out
of tha political condition of th coming
four year; tha occasion must produce the
matf, and the man must be worthy of th
summons. Else there will be no leader
whom the party can follow with spirit.
and It will be idle to make a campaign In
mi with any hop of success.
Sine 1872 the democratic party haa nut
Its best foot forward and achieved the most
satisfactory .results when it nominated for
the president a man of executive ability
and experience In each case the success
ful governor of a state. If th party can
not develop such a man before the next
national convention It chances of obtain
ing posesalon of the government will be
slim Indeed. Reorganisation cannot make
such a man or after dinner speeches; he
must be evolved and grow to tha requisite
stature.

Both the Bryan vote and the democratic

Boston Transcript (rep.).
Though the popular wot thrown In No
vember was th largest in our history, and
came within 147.000 of touching th li, 000,000
mark, it Illustrates th indifference of
many voter to the exercise of th free-
man's privilege. There must be more than
1,000,000 stay-at-homes at th lowest com
putatlon assuming that tha United Btates
ha approximately 90,000,000 inhabitant, and
making allowance for disfranchisement
and unnaturallsed alien. Th popular
vote does not keep pace with th Increase
of population, and to this circumstanc Is
due the fact that the total last month
waa but 893,000 in excess of that caat in
November. 1900. In 1904 tha popular vote
waa but little in excess of 11,511,708.

as well a the legal neceealty ot legislation
which ahall empower th commission or
another body to exercise a broad but defi
nite surveillance over combinations and con
solidations among carriers, intercorporate
stock purchases, and similar operation of
the directing talent at work with publlo
service corporations. If proper legislation
of this character ta obtained It I greatly to
be preferred to the extension by construc
tion of the inquisitorial powers ot the com
mission under the present Interstate com
merce act, a prooesa of great uncertainty,
unjust to tha Individual and unsatisfactory
from the point of view of the publlo in
terest.
The president's proposals for removing
carriers from the operatlona of th Pher-
man law and for new legislation which
hall -provide for publicity and regulation
as to their capitalisation, combination and
management undoubtedly ha directed and
crystallised publlo opinion along these lines.
Tha president-elect is In general accord
with theas policies and undoubtedly will
exercise hi great Influence toward their
enactment on safely constitutional lines.
It Is during Mr. Taft's admlnsltratlon. In
fact w must look for that Intelligent over
hauling of the law affecting corporations
which now seems desirable. The first legis
lation ln thia new field ha proved defec
tive in many respects, aa Is inevitable in a
period of transition. The nation Is fortu
nate ln the assurance that the experience
of the last few epoch-making years Is to
be made permanently profitable under the
guidance of a legal knowledge so sound
and a progresstvenesa so enlightened as
Mr. Taft's.
WOBBLY ON TUB WORDS.
Battlefleet Crewa Break Dowa on
National Anthem.
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Here Is fresh proof of the unhappy fact
that our country I still In need of a na
tional anthem. Whenever th battleship
fleet reached a stopping place tha natives
Invariably saluted it with a national air.
Everybody had a national air except your
Unci Sam. Of course th visiting officers
and men made an effort to respond with
"The Star Spangled Banner." W are told
that tha first line went vigorously, but at
the second the singers wobbled and at the
third they went vocally broke. A few
voice carried th melody through and (till
fewer sang the words correctly, but If we
can believe the correspondents it was a
sorry effort. It Is said that after several
failures of this kind general rehearsals
were tried, but the men ahowed but llttl
Improvement Th fact Is, tbe air does not
lend Itself to the tuneful manlpulatlona ot
ordinary voice. Nor I it possible to sing
the words with the gltbness that permits ot
tha proper patriotic emphasis.
Perhaps this picture of our sallormen,
strangers In a strange land, wrestling with
an air that 1 beyond the compass ot their
voices, and endeavoring to repeat words
that seem to defy memorising, will rousa
some pitying song writer to renewed ef
forts. Tha additional picture of the natives
gaslng ln open mouthed astonishment at
th battleship chorus and wondering if the
Americana can b aa terrible In fight as
they are ln song, should emphasise these
determined efforts.
SEASON OF ULADNESS.
Deeper Mood of Christina Qaletlaa
to the Pertarbcd Spirit."
Collier's Weekly.
The holiday spirit Inheres In the merri
ment of children, a rellgloua glow for all
participants, a burst of genoroslty for
those less favored, and a sens of universal
peace. Stated more concretely, the deep
concern of the day are th child, the
family, the church and the poor. It active
celebration conalsts in releasing the good
will of each heart through unselfish ac
tion or gratitude. It atmosphere derive
from the old-time attractive belief that at
a certain season of th year there was
a peace ot Qod, with a laying down of
arms and a cessation of 'strife. The hope
of the day I that there shall be an exten
sion of the area and tlme-llmlt of that
peace until It gathers In the nation and
Interpenetrate th daily atnigglo of th
Individual. A holiday season offers ua the
ohance to step out and took at our work,
and th aplrit and purpose of the work.
It Is a aeventh day affirmation of tha worth
of tha slx.daya of headlong creatica ac
tivity. Like tha Gobelin tapestry weavers,
w ar mostly on th wrong side of our
own pattern. It Is profoundly good one
a year to so that the outworking 1 gra

Christmas .1 quieting to th perturbed spirit
of us. We ar permitted' to glimp th
eternal order to know that th near fore
ground I torn and swaying with blind
struggle and muddy turmoil, but that be
hind it for all th reachea of apace, there
is the assurance of a great peace.
Danger of Janrhaadla Decision.
Kansas City Time.
All such Inquiries as that of tha Missouri
rat case, tn progress In Kansaa City, Il
lustrate the wisdom of enlarging tho powers
of commissions to find out the facta con
cerning corporations. These commission
can be provided with expert Investigator,
and such a thing aa a one-sided inquiry
will no longer place the people at a dis
advantage. Great advances have been made
In the last few year In thl regard. Th
frequency of injunction against legislation
haa - shown to th publlo that th law
making power will really rest with the ex
port statistician of th special Interest
unless the people employ om skilled ac
countant of their own.

W hear much In this peaceful' country,
about Germany' burden ot militarism.
Well, our national bonfire woald pay for
th kaiser' whole army maintenance and
leav a surplus annually of $30,000,000 for a
fireworks fund wherewith to sppeaso our
pyroraaniae appetite. If Germany- I op
pressed by wars and the rumors of wars,
how much more sorely la the United States
oppressed by fir and the evils that attend
It. And the worst of It Is that this loss,
ln great part Is superfluous; Incredibly
and Idiotically stupid and shortsighted.
Kurop proves so much. No nation there
but would b appalledby at such a fir bill
aa ours. In the forty-nine principal cities
of Europe there I less than ona fir an
nually (.8. to be exact) to every L000 In
habitant. In this country w maintain a
general average of four and on-half flre
per 1,000 persons. The per capita loss b
flames In Italy 1 13 cents yearly; in Ger
many, 49 cents; In thirty of the largest
European cities, 61 cent; and In 262 Ameri
can cities the per capita destruction aver
ages $3.10. Boston, ln many resnocts the
most scientifically administered and munici
pally progressive rty ln thia country, haa
a yearly bill of $l,oOO.OOO from loss by burn
ing. Tho European city of equal stse got
along with one-tenth of that sacrifice. Our
debit side of the fir ledger sums tip a
heavier total than the combined loe of
any other mx civilised nations In the
