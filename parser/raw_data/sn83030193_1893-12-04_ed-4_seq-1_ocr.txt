WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.--The Prrsl
clpnt'e message, transmitted to Congress
to-day, after a brief introductory para
graph, proceeds as follows:
t'ORKIGN RELATIONS.
Wfcllt our foreign relation hive not at all
1 .in' 1 during the pant yrar been entirely fiea
from prpl sally, no cmbaJTAwlng ait nation re
mains that will not yield to the spirt of falr
naaa and lov of juitlce. whiok, Joioad with con
lattnt Rrmntia, cbargctcrlza a truly American
foreign policy.
Mr pratftcestor Ray In a accepted the offlre Of
arbitrator of the long-atonal ng mtffMons hoUnvl
ary dlapute. tendered to the President by t he
Argentine Republic and Brazil, It haa been my
graablt duty to iecelva the aperial envoys com
fhlulonM by thoe mates to lay before me
evidence and arguments lu behalf of their re-j
apectivo Governments.
BRAZILIAN TROUBLES.
The outbreak of domestic bostllltlea in the Re
public of r.i.iil found the t tilted Statin alert
to watch tbe Interests of our citizens In that roun-
. with which we carry on Important tummerre.
ttaveral vcaaeln of our new navy are now, and
Tor aome time have been, statlnned at ltlu do
Janeiro. The struggle being between tlie -tal-iished
Government, which controls the machinery
or administration, and tth whleh we maintain
friendly relations, and certain om era of the navy
employing the vcaaels of their command In an
attack upon the national capital and ohlef aea
1 it, and lacking, aa it doe, the elements of
divided admlntatratlon. I haw failed to see that
the Insurgents, can reasonably claim recognition
eui belllgerentc.
ThBI far the position of our Government has
t'.n that of an attentive but impartial obaerw-r
of tbe unfortunate ronfllct. Kmpiianlzlng our
Used policy of Impartial neutrality In such a con
dition of affairs as now exists. I deemed It neces
aary to disavow. In a manner not i i be ralsun
derstood. the unauthorized at t Ion of our lalo
nival commander In those waters In saluting
the revolted Brazilian Admiral, being Indisposed
to 'ounienanre an act calculated to give gratuitous
aanctlun to the local Insurrection.

CONGRESS RESUMES.
Regular Session Opens with the
President's Message.
Queer Omission of the Hawaiian
Section in the Senate.
Ilw VarloiM Members I.Mronl
Nol All Stayed Through.
WASHINGTON, Dec ..-The flrsl
regular es!o:i of the Fifty thli.l ur.
Krrss convene. 1 Dt hlKh tioun tO-da.v.
At roll call In the Benata iifty-siy sen:
toi' respond. (I to their mimes. The usual
committee vu appointed to wait on the
Prealdent. nmi pending the cotnmtttee'i
report the Senate, a. 12.ll, took n recess
of one hour.
The roll-call ihowed 240 inenil.i-rs of
the llous present at the opening, and
the spectators' galleries were crowded.
After the format opening the House at
12.2T, took a recess until 1.10.
After receUi the President's meaeage
was presented atuI read In both
branches of Congreaa.
In the Senate all present, tth few ex
ceptions, gave Oloee attention when the
reading was begun. Senator Cameron
eemed at first more Interested In a news
paper, hut soon laid the paper aside, and
afterwards listened Intently for u short
time.
Senator l.olph Kave attention to his old
file of bills for a few moments, hut
pricked up his ear-- as the readlUK reaehe I
the Hawaiian paragraph.
Senator Gordon found opportunity to
prepare a brief bill during the progress
Of the reading, while Senator Hoar was
apparently more Interested In a news
paper than In the first part of the mea
eage. Senators had been early furntslv.l with
printed coplea of the measure, and many
Of them followed the official reading
while scanning the document for them
selves. These Included Senators Voor
hees, Gorman. Mcl-herson, Vilas Cock
rell and others. Senators Manderson
and Lodge rend from the same pamphlet,
and Senators Vilas and White, of Louis
iana, shared another cony.
There was a general cnanKins; about In
the seats of Senators when the portion
of the document dealing with Hawaii
waH approached, and Senator Dolph. who
had dropped ids bills, rnlsed both bands
to his ears, as if anxious not to miss a
word of It.
Many of the Senators had. however,
anticipated the Secretary's reading by
turning Jn their printed copies to thH
portion, so that very few of them appar
ently observed that the page containing
the President's brief communication on
Hawaii was turned without being read
by the Secretary.
Senator Kvle was one of the few Sen
ators who followed the reading suffi
ciently clos" to obaerve the omtaeton,
and he called attention to the oversight
by sending up a note calling attention to
the fact.
After this Incident there was an evi
dent falling off In Interest on the part of
Senators, but attention was briefly re
vived when the paragraph concerning
bonds was reached. When this para
graph was passed. Senators gradually
left their seats and drifted out Into the
cloak-rooms, so that by the time the
reading had been two-thirds concluded
there were only 2". Senators In the Cham
ber, and a majority of these were en
gaged In conversation among them
selves. The galleries followed the example of
the Senators, and while most of the
seats were occupied when the reading
began, there were comparatively few lis
teners at Its close.
The reading of the message was con
cluded at ''. o'clock, having occupied ap
proximated one hour and a half.
Mr. itoiph (Rep., Oregon.) Immediately
arose and said there had been distributed
In the Senate printed coplea of what
purported to he the message of the
President, In which, on page 9. he found
a part of a page devoted to Hawaii and
he did not hear that portion read from
the desk. , , ...
He desired to know, and thought the
country did also, whether that part was
Inadvertently or purposely omitted By
the Secretary, or whether the copies
which h.id ben circulated were not true
copies of th. meaaage.
The Yl-e-Preil.'en. r.. led t"-'! "' '
portion of Ihe message relating to II .wall
had been lllad ertentlv omitted by the
Secretary, mil directed Ihat It be read
This was dpne, and Mr. Holph gave
: notice that he would to-morrow addi'"ss
the Senate on Ihat part of the in. '"sage
In the House, during the reading of
i the first million "f the message, ex-
Bpeaker Th. mas Heed burst through a
1 side door, at.d came rolling ncross the
I area In front of the Speaker's rostrum.
When he readied his seat, he dellberate-
I ly lighted a cigar and snt puffing away
I complacently while the reading pro-
ceeded.
As the reference to the Hawaiian af
fair was reached, the members straight
ened up and gave the closest noaalble
attention, but no expression either of
approval or disapproval was Indulged
In There seemed to 1"' a general air or
disappoint men t. however, that so little
pace was allotted to this question.
I The recommendation! relative to an
' International Monetary Conference and
the requeat for further authority for the
Issue of bonds caused m my significant
shakes of the head on the pari of ex
treme silver men. .
The President's bold Indorsement of
the pension policy of the Interior I)e
nartmont of Civil service Reform, and
! his appeal for ilgld economy In appro
priations also attracted attention
1 When the reference to the tariff was
1 reached the members crowded about
I the clerk's desk. The forceful utter
' ance relative to the duty of Congress
on the tariff ouestion and the hearty In
. dor-o intent wen to the Wilson bill
I seemed to nleaee the Democratic mem
bers greatly, but much eurpnsa was
evident when that section of the mes-
1 sar" was read stating that the V ays
I nmi Means Committee had embraced In
ii plan several additional internal rev-
1 cnue taxes, and a Miiull tax on the lu-
I comes of certain corporations.
I As It was imdersto d the Internal
revenue features mid the income tax
had not been absolutely d -elded upon.
Ihe President's announcement came In
the nature nf a surnrlse.
V roar of applause greeted the con
clusion of the reading of the message
Gen. Hlngham who has been selected
bv the Pennsylvania delegation to make
the announcement of the deaths or
Itenrescntatlvcs O'Neill and I. Nicy, was
