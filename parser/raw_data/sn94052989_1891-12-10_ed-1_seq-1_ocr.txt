Loss of Life at Two Fierce
Fires in Louisville.
I Number of Firemen Canght by Falling
Vails and Crushed.
Several Girls Burned to Death and Others
Badly Injure:— The Search for Eodies
of the Missing— Heavy Losses.
FpeclaitoTHE Horning Call.
Louisville, Dec. 9.— While the firemen
were raking away the luins of tho linone
Paper Company building, at 4:30 o'clock
this morning, there came the sound of a
terrific explosion In Batnberger, Strong &
Co.'s build four stories high. In one in
stant flames broke out from every floor and
shot out through the roof. The fire must
have been smoldering for several hours in
the cellar, and when each of the four
stories bad been filled with heated air and
smoke the explosion followed. The follow
ing firms were burned out:
Bamberger, Strong & Co., boots and
■bees— 8125,000; insurance, £100,000.
Bliss, Wilson & Co., furnishing goods and
notions— £53,000; insurance, $40,000.
Weiler, Woolfolk & Payne, boots and
■noes—Loss, $75,000; insurance unknown.
Johanboeke & Sons, hats—Loss, $40,000;
insurance, $35,0 ■'.
It was with great difficulty that the fire
men prevented the flames from spreading
further. A number of people were sleeD-
Ing In the upper rooms of the building, but
all escaped.
A number of firemen were caught under
the falling wall of Bamberger, Strong &
Co. building. Fire Chief Hughes and
Captain Weatherford are injured. Four
dead firemen arc under the walls and four
others are badly hurt.
AN'OTHEK FATAL FIHE.
At 8 o'clock another fatal fire broke out at
F. A. Menne & Co.'s wholesale candy and
fnucy grocery house, one square above the
Boone Paper Company's buildiuz. Tlie or
igin of the fire is a mystery. Forty girls
were at work on the fourth floor, and all wore
not able to escape. The bodies of six girls
have already been taken out, burned almost
beyond identification.
C. T. Menne, brother of the senior mem
ber of the linn, is supposed to have been
burned to death, and the firemen think at
least five other girls will be fouud soon. A
thorough search is being made.
The fire cut off escape by the stairway
leading from the fourth floor, where the
eirla were at work. Many jumped lrom the
windows to the second-story projection and
escaped witn broken limbs and bruised bod
ies. Others gut out unhurt.
With Its forces weakened and demoralized
by the. accident of the early morning the
Fire Department was called to the disaster
at the candy factory. To add to the confu
sion Slaj ,t Chief Hughes of the Fire Depart
ment was so badly hurt in the accident of
the early niornina th.it he may not recover.
He and Henry Weatherford, the Chiefs as
sistant, while gome to the fire, were run into
by the Salvage Corps wagon and their buggy
smashed. Both were trampled by the
horses but the Injuries of Weatherford
were not so bad as those of his Chief.
A number of other firemen were badly in
jured at the candy-shop tire.
In the face of these disasters the firemen
stood bravely to their work, and within an
other half hour the flames were under cou
trol.
LIVES SACRIFICED.
Within this time half a score of lives had
been sacrificed.
The latter fire Is supposed to have arisen
Irom a candy furnace which possibly ex
ploded and the flames communicated with
a big stock of Christmas firework*. The
first explosion among the fireworks scat
tered firebrands all over the store, the sky
light fell in and the entire stock was blazing
almost immediately.
The bodies of the girls were removed as
Boon as possible to the nearest undertaking
establishments. Two of the pirls have
just been identified as Mary Walsh and
Amelia Dickey.
Great confusion exists. Main street,
where the principal wholesale traffic of the
city goes on, is blockaded, an-l business is
almost at a standstill. The loss on Menne
& Co.'s buiUing and stock is placed at 575,
--000, and the total loss will be n-arly three
quarters if c million. The flames were
stopoed at George W. Wicks & Co.'s cottou-
Luuse.
TIIE DEAD.
The work of searching for bodies in the
buildings destroyed by fire this morning
was still going on at midnight. The miss
ing firemen are now believed to be in the
ruins of the Boon Paper Company building,
wedged between the huee piles of paper
that tilled the cellar. The dead recovered
at Menne & Co.'s are:
KECK, LULU.

James Weinler and Thomas Bechulder,
who worked at Menne's, weie also missing

bathkbfobd, He.vrt.
Fire Chief Hughes has concussion of the
brain.
How the fires originated is still uncer
tain. There were only two office fires at trie
Buone Paper Company's building and it is
certain the flames originated at neither of
these. At Mem c & Co. n number of fires
were burning, but none of them account fur
the starting i,f th* conflagration.
It is now doubtful II thnrn was an explo
sion at lianiberger, Stern & Co.'s, next door
to the Boone Company, at the time the fire
men were caught. The report was probably
Irom the falling walla. It is thought the loss
will reach three-quarters of a million.

CHILE'S COMPLICATIONS.

Harrison's statement concerning Chilean affairs

decidedly menacing a rupture between Hie two

Government will consent to either an apology or
any material indemnity. The majority In Con
giess Is known to be opposed to any concession,
and the Clillesn Government, although possessed
of cieat Influence, would Mud li dlfllcuit to carry
the necessary support for any buuillUliug
measure*.
The Government is progressing actively with
warllKe preparations, ami artilleiy of the latest
manufacture has been m tiered from Germany in
anticipation of hostilities, possibly with other
powers, and probably with I lie lured
elates. The situation Is complicated by Spain's
demand lor a i,.i,-.' Indemnity, which ilio
Chileans nay is presented now in outer
to take advantage* of Ilia, existing dif
ficulties. Tin ■ general sentiment indicates that
they would challenge Si kin II they bad not the
United Mates to deal with. and an A hum lean

Chileans might conclude to settle with America
In order to dels the Spaniards.

SEEKING CO-OPERATION.
State Boards and the National Commission
of tbe World's Fair.
Chicago, Dec. 9.—Thirty-one Slate 'World's
Fail organizations were icpieseuled In a con
vention called to meet to-day with the Board of
Control, Department of Chiefs and the Directors
of Hie exposition. Fully 150 people were present,
about half of them being women delegates f■ mil
the State Hoard. Messrs. De Youug, Massey, St.
Clalr, l.lndsey and Martludale represrnled the
National Hoard ot Control. Tlie proceedings had
not cone far before President Biker of the Local
Directory made a speech that seemingly coninli
eaies Ihe iclatlons between th« State boards and
the National Commission, and may lead to lively
times in Hie convention.
Mr. oeVouug Introduced a resolution, which
was adopted, providing for reports from each
Slate on the work accomplished and Information
desired. At this point Baker was called on to
speak, atio, iv nit* course of hit remarks, said:
" The object ol this coiueullon Is to secure. the
cri-oitiinuiti of tin- Mate boards In dealing with
exbibllois. To do this effectively. stall! organl
zailons must secure authotrty from the Board of
Control. It is dillicult to deal exhibitors
from the States llnoiiKh depaitments of Hie fair.
Theie iiiusi be discrimination In ihe select of
exhibits, ar.d dei iini-iii chiefs cannot Judi;e of
tin- display In a ill-lain Mile, or discriminate
between exhibitors, cause hey have no means
of Jiidtlni:. The lemedy for this would li- in
resulatloos dhecilui: M applications for space
from the Slates lo come through the Slate board,
and YaMlng the Stale authorises with power of
dlscrimiuatlon as to tin- exhibits."
Toe National (.'oiiimi«stnu and its Board of
Control alone have heietofoie had control of
applications for space and the Installation of
exhibits. Bated** speech apparently conveyed
to the Helen.itts.the impiesMoii that they would
urn be hivi-ii power In ihelr iesi ective jini-ilr
lions piactiCHlly lo say who would exhibit and
ho not.
Delegate Graves of Wisconsin at ouce offered
a re-oUiiion in i bat vein. It was laid over until
to-morrow, and, from indications, it will r.ive
rife to a lively dl-cusslon.
EX-Cungieuman Frank of Ml«si>uii offered a
resolution providing [or the organization ot all
th« State delegations present in: o one body.
Some of the iiembeis of Hie Hoard of Control
thought they saw In this a move to demand per
mission to ill-lull Slate exhibits In State build-
Ings, and the lesolutlou was postponed until
in iron, aud li. convention adjourned uuttl
then.
At a subsequent meeting of the Board of Con
trol the matter was considered, and one of the
members said afterward thai, while they wanted
the co-opeiallon of State organization! and were
iucliued to confer some nower on them, they
would nut consent to any such broad uivi-lou of
control.

Opening Statement for the Defense in the
Barnaby Murder Case.
I>| svkh, Dec. 9,-Judn-- Furnian, for the de
fense, made his opening address In the Barnaby
murder case to-day, lie said: "We do not come
before you with any unreasonable theories, but
we come before you withtiuiu. If there wis a
bottle of poisoned whisky pent, 1 say the m:tri
who .sent it was a hell-hound and he Should be
burned at lie sia c. We are confident of being
able conclusively to prove all the allegations of
the prosecution are false."
I'm man denied any Ul-motlves upon the part
of the doctor, ami deuled that he had any but the
best wishes for the old lady, as the management
other affairs by him will snow. He laid John
Com ad after ex mining the accoun's exonerated
the doctor from the eliaree of mtsmanagenent,
and said he would sign a statement to th.it effect.
The doctor Mid he thought it would only be
ilcht. Accmdliig io Kurniau Coniad said:
■'Can't you help me, doctor? I want to be Gov
ernor and United States Senator." They met at
Mr. Conrad's house that night, saltl i'u>mau,
and .Mr. Conrad and he could not fix up the
statement ihen. He added mat he had contrib
uted 125,000 in the last elec ton In Montana aud
expected soon to be Govrnor. II thought lie
could bo back and say it was a mistake to sus
pect the doctor. It would fix Him with his con-
Miiueiiis. "Don't yon think some one sent a
borlle of pure whl<ky?" tilil l.«. -1 believe--
Mori tils put In poison, and If you can prove
that some one aenl the whlky I will fix
the crime on Worrells." The doctor would
not say anything because Ik knew n i'li'iii;. Two
days at er- a partial statement exposing Dr.
Graves was published. On the following Wodnoi
day Conrad sent for Graves to talk about ilie
will. In me His: will Conr.id's children were
each left 126.000. In the second will they wie
only Mi $10,000. Conrad said to him: "Doc
tor, I want you In sic" this paper,
on which you admit you sent Mrs.
Harnaby a bolilr of pure whisky. If you don't
slim tins 1 will take you to Denver In handcutls.
1 will fix a jury to convict you. I am a Western
man." Dr. Graves demanded to bs lot out of
111- bonse, and the next day lelegranhmt District -
Atioi ney Stevens that he was coming io Denver.
At Ilia afternoon session two witnesses were
examined, but no testimony of ImpuiUuc-: was
brought out.

THE COMMITTEES.
Statesmen Contesting for Choice
; Chairmanships,
The Important Vacancies to Be Filled in
the Senate. .
Speaker Crisp Will Nit Discloss His Selec
tions—Springer's Choice—Both Houses
of Congress' Adjourn.
Special to The Morniso Call.
Washington, . Dec. Notwithstanding
the fact that the organization of both
branches of Congress has been perfected In
main details, it still. remains for the mana
gers at each end of the Capitol to supply
the committees before the Fifty-second Con
gress can begin to discharge its proper futic-
Urns. Already the managers of both,
brr.r.ches are struggling with the problem
how to aecotnmodatu each aspirant for a
committee appointment with bis personal
preference without causing discontent, ana
with due regard to public policy. In the
Senate the only contest likely to be ex
pected is otic relating to a committee of
minor importance—that on library—where
nt least three Senators— Stockbrkige of Mis
sissippi, Dixon of Rhode Island arid Wol
colt of Colorado—are anxious to succeed the
late Chairman, Evarts. . A struggle is pos
sible, ever, over the vacancy on the
Appropriations Committee, caused by Far
well's retirement Mitchell, who has been
Chairman of the Railway Committee for
two terms, expects to fill Spooner's place
as Chairman of the Committee on Claim-.
Casey of North Dakota is as good as booted
for Mitchell's present position of Chairman
«f the Committee on Railways. Possibly
Wilson of lowa, though a member or sev
eral hard-worked committees, may be in
duced to accept the chairmanship of the
Committee on Education vacated by 15 air,
but this rather undesirable place may be
handed over to a new Senator. Hoar
Hues, by order and preference) to the
bead of the Judiciary Committee, vice Ed
munds, resigned. Teller takes his place as
Chairman, oi the Committee on Privileges
and Elections. There is some talk of giving
I'ell'er a place on the Agriculture Commit
tee. Sumo politics are Involved in this aud
it may be the Alliance Senator will secure
a more desirable place as the result of the
efforts of the Republican and Democratic
managers to keep him on their respective
sides. Nobody has yet decided to place
Kyle, the South-Dakota Alliance Senator,
hut the expressed views of Irby, the South
Carolina Alliance Senator, caused him to be
assigned to the minority representation.
THE HOUSE COMMITTEES.
It is said upon good authority that Speaker
Crisp had nut, uu to-day, offered a single
committee chairmanship to any member of
the iliiu-e, and for that reason reports as to
his intentions are purely speculative. The
Speaker has, to a lew friends, outlined tire
policy which will covet n him as far as the
individual characteristics of members will
permit in the make-up of the committees.
Hi) will, it is learned, endeavor to give the
West aud North prominence, and avoid as
far a possible the charges of sectionalism.
Mills is expected to be tendered the chair
manship ol the Ways and Means Committee
on account of his identification with the
•turirT-rpformjmovi'nient, but personal cou-
Mderutious may induce him to decline this
honor and prefer a place as simply a mem
ber of that commit c. Ex-Siieaker Reed
and Mr. Uurrows of Michigan are named as
the Republican members of the Committee
on Rules. There is reason to believe that
Springer is almost certain of being a mem
ber of the Ways and Means Committee, if
not Chairman, Jlolman (Ind.) is the most
prominently mentioned Representative for
the cliairmaosbio of the Appropriations
Committee, but the name of McMillln of
Tennessee was to-day also suggested.
Hatch and IJland of Missouri are slated lor
the chairmanship of the Agricultural and
Coinage, Weights and Measures committees.
Amos CuuuniuKS of New York is tlie prob
able head of the Committee on Merchant
Marine and"Eisheries, and Postoffices will
go to lilount of Georgia, Its Chairman in
the Fiftieth Congress. Herbert of Ala
bama has a sort of a prospective right to
the Naval Affairs Committee through being
a former Chairman, In which position he
had an influential part in the building up
of the new navy. Oulhwaite of Ohio is the
probable chairman of the Pacific Railways
» ommittee, unless he should prefer the
Committee on Elections.

lniulalraliun of the customs service.
CONCERNING IMMIGRATION*.
The Secretary devotes much space to the Im
migration question, of which ha says If ever
there was one which oucht to tie tiea ed inde
pendently this Is it. The Chinesa question Is also
considered at some length, dwelling especially on
the MiniKcliiig or tin-in in th rough Canada. The
AH'i Genera!, he says, has expie«sed his
opinion that the act of September 13.1888. Is
not In force, as the treaty i,acl not been ralllied,
«nd thai tin- acts of May. 1882, and July, 1884,
still control. Unless Congress shall enact new
legislation upon Hie subj ct it would seen flint
any Chinese laborer may lawfully enter this
country alter May C, 1892, unless lie shall have
Pii-vlousiy resided here, in which case admission
is piohlliited. Any legislation, however, look
iMß to 11. exclusion will fail of the full purpose
as long as the Cniudini Guveiuiniut admits
Chinese la oreis lo Canada, wh nee, armed
with Canadian permits to leave and return to Can
ad, at pleasure, they are alllbeity to Invade
our tftritory along the entire iiurthe'rn frontier.
In a chapter on the Seal Islands the Secretary
reviews the reports as to the destruction of seal
by pelagic hunting, and says restrictive meas
ures have been Imperatively demauded for the
protection of this valuable ai»nral. Other mat
ters lelalliiu to the Smil Islands he says he will
Invite the attention of Congress to later.
THE POSTOFFICE SITE.
Treasury Officials Glad That It Has Been
Rejected.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. — Those who have
talked with Hie Tieasury Department officials
within Hie last day or mo say Mai the depart
ment was clad to Cud a way by which they
might avoid taking the Harvey property on the
comer of Seventh and Mission sire ts for a Post
tiflice site, a treasury ollicial asked to-day if
Judge Harvey Brown was still In the city, and
being ausweied'ln the afHimsilve, said: "lie
may as well go Home and save ills Washington
lioiel bills." As .Mi. Brown has been here tak
ing a Rood deal of interest in having the Seventh
and Mission streets site retained by ilia Govern
ment, Hie remark of tula official will appear .«lg
ullicaiit. One of the California deleeaiiou said
today: "It >• ems to me the Trcasuiy Depart
ment official! ate glad that they nave found a
way out lit their difficulty. I think the depart
ment will now look alter the matter themselves
without the aid of any local San Francisco com
mission and probably condemn a Bile." An
other Treasury official said to-day: "Of cour-e
we are now free to select any site we pletise, but
1 think It Is no mine than light to say that In
our opinion there has been no 'job' Id this San
Francisco slie mallei; at least Hie circumstances
do uut indicate It. One of the property-owners
tried to clnCO Mr. Harvey, as 1 understand II;
that is to say he wanted an exorbitant price for
the narrow .strip of laud which was needed. • The
fact that the parties moat concerned refused to
pay this price Is evidence to my mind thai there
cannot be much profit hi It for them."

Victims of the November Corn Squeeze
Operating a December Deal.
Chicago, Deo. 9.— December corn Jumped up
about llVa cents today, and another corner on
'Change Is 111 sight. It looks as (if those opera
tors who worked the November squeeze will
nave to take soma of their own medicine.
When the clique was pushing up the price last
month many of the shorts sought to recover
themselves by selling for the year, believing
that there would be plenty of contract corn on
the marKet In December. Hut results have beau
disappointing. For a week or so rumors, of a
big deal have becD itle ami to-day, when »oma
solid names were attached to those rumors, Hie
shoits went wild. Their frantic endeavors to
cover resulted in the advance'mentioned la
less than one hour and a half. The
motive behind the- de.l seems to have been
revenge. Cndahy, Wright, stecver and otben
short in November have. It v asserted, bought
from several linns prominent In the November
deal from three to rive million bushels of ye*r
and December corn, and are prepared to repay
the agony tiny endured a few days ago, when
they bought for 73 cent* corn they nad sold for
GO c ills. It li said the November clique Is
heavily short, not only here but In New York.
Among them are ration lion., Bartlett, Frazier,
Cosier, Martin and others.

syndicate, of which llutcliuiMHi Is the principal

Ideas ol the President's party Ulalue's chances
are ssrionsly diminished.
The Dally News says: "The President's mes
sage leaves nothing desired either In tone of
temper. Harrison Is less exasperating than
Blalne, and consequently more statesmanlike.
He would not apeak so leuderly of reciprocity if
bis protection policy was a success."
The Standard says: "Harrison's message Is
noticeable for Its lame devotion to foreign affairs.
This showing is due to Blalne's fidgety activity.
The I'resideut Elides with customary bland on
timism-, over several mailer', hardly doing credit
to American diplomatist?. It must be admitted
that the figures he quotes, although Justifying
the s,iiii!Ulub bones of the authors of the McKin
