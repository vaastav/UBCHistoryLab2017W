Itepublican6 in that state will have
to go to Bchool pretty steadily

TnrnE is some talk of Gov. J.
D. Porter, of Tennessee, for a
cabinet position under Cleveland.
IIo lias twice been governor of
Tennessee and was assistant secre
tary of state under I3ayard during
a portion of Cleveland's adminis

cabinet ositioa would be well re
ceived iu the south and west.
There was a conferenco of
'democratic senators in New York
city lust week and a conference of
republican tenators in Washing
ton at tho same time. Both
partu s are doing all in their pow
er to secure control of tho senate
after tho 3rd uf next March.
Senators ero to 1 chosen in sev
eral states and the result in some
cf them is very doubtful.
Willi am T. Thor.nto.v, of Organ,
is a candidate for governor of New
Mexico. Col. Thornton has been
a resident of this Territory for a
nunibor of years and is well and
favorably known. lie was for
inerly a resident of Snnta Fe,
w here lie was engaged in tho prac
tice of law, but for como timo he
has resided in Dona Ana county
lie wid Lavo a largo number of
sipportera throughout tho Terri
and will tauko a strong race for
governor.
Sheriff's feos ought to bo re
duced tt least one-half, and other
Comity oflecra ought to receive
less pay than they are getting, ex
cept, iei-hnpH, the County coiiiniis
fcioncrs, tretiHurer, probate judge
and surveyor. There is no justice
in taxing the peeplo of a county
two and a half kt cent to pay
talarles and fees to a few office
holders. J'.educe tho taxes and
let tho officials do their work for
fair pay.
Tiirr.E remains but aliout two
and a half months during which
tiniM claims can le filed in the
laud fourt now in aesion at Snnta
IV. The interests of New Mexico
have suffered to a very great ex
tent on account of the unsettled
condition of lrmd titles but the
beginning of tho end of this dif
ficulty is ia sight The last caso
will have to bo filed ou or In-fore
the 3rd of n xt March and as the
life of the court is limited by the
net creatinir it, the land grant
question will r,oon be a thine of

land tith-s and admission to the
Union, New Mexico will prosper.

in a little sarcasm m h:a h.t mes
sage in rcferenco to tho tariff
question. Iu view of tho over
whelming popular verdict of the
peopb, against tha republican tar
jó" policy it would fc-eio thatlha
President Lad taken this occasion
to get in a little blow for protec
tion after tho battle. His views
on the tariff qtv-stinn are in oppo
sition to those of the great major

The increase during the past

During twelvo months two hun
dred thousand new ttensioners
have lcen added to tho already
enormous list
Is anybody blind to the signifi
cance of this exhibit? If o, let
him go back twenty years to 1872,
when the war had been over for
seven years ami every just claim
upon tho government's bounty had
presumably ln-en presented and
allowed. In that year, 172, Gen.
James A. Garfield, speaking to tho
house of representatives both as a
legislator and as a veteran of the
Union army, declared that the
pension list was then "swollen be
yond all account." "I am the last
man," said Gen. Garfield, "to say
a word against voting pensions to
all jw-rsoiis who deserve them.
Put I wish to my to tho House
thr.t more frauds are Wing perpe
trated on the government by clnim
agents iu different portions of the
country than from almost any
other singlo source." In that
same year while discussing the
general financial situation, Cíen.
Garfield, as chairman of the com
mittee on Bppropriations.expressed
tho opinion that " we may reason
ably expect that tho expenditures
for tensions will hereafter stead
ily decrease, unless our legislation
should bo unwarrantably extravagant."
At the time when Gen. Garfield
leclared that the honest and legit
imate pension exjK-nditure of the
United States government had
reached its high water mark, and
nngtit be oxiH-cteil tteaUUy there
after to decrease, tho number of
pensioners of all classes, as shown
by the commissioner's report then
last issued, was 207,405, and the
aggregate of their pensions fc22,
801,'J'Jl. Twenty years later the
number of pensioners had increas
ed moro than three hundred and
twenty per cent., and the annual
pension expenditure of tho gov
ern meut between four and five
hundred per cent.
Tho expenditure on accouut of
pensions during tho present fiscal
year will use up every dollar of
the appropriation of SH4,í)óti,000,
and occasion a deficiency estimated
by commissioner Kuum at $10,500,-
000.
Tho commissioner's lowest esti
mate of the appropriation required
for next yeur is $105,000, 000.
Competent judges believe that the
fifty-third congress will bo callet'
uj)on to voto pension approprin
tions exceeding two hundred mil
lions annually.
These figures stagger the ima
gination. No other evil whicl
has grown out of republican rulo
is comparable to this. No scanda
that has ever stained tho govern
ment of any country has equalled
this stupendous plunder of tho
taxpayers in the name of gratitude
to tho nation's defenders. Thirty
years afler tho close of the civil
war wo shall bo paying a million
pensions, or as many pensions as
there were Boldiers in the Union
army at any one tino during tho
war. We shall bo paying, on ac
count of a war closed moro than a
quarter of a ceutury ago, a sum of
money threo times greater than
tho total annual expendituro o
the United States government at
tho time when the war began.
Put this is not tho whole btory,
Behind tho army of 870,003 pen
sioners thero is a reservo forco o
altout half a million claimants
waiting for tho machinery of the
pension bureau to "adjudicate
their claims under existing laws
and tho pension bureau is muster
ing them, iu at the rate of two hun
dred thousand a year. An
beniud the reserve forco of actua
applicants whoso claims are on file
at Washington, thvre is 6till anotli
er reserve, an uncounted army
waiting only for the passago of
laws extending the ecopo of the
government's extenditiiro.
How long will it bo before every
survivor of tho Uuion army, bo he
hero or eneak, four years' soldier
or thirty-day recruit, feeble- or
stalwart, rich cr poor, will figuro
ah a bcnefu.-ir.ryuf an eleemosynary
institution which has no parallel
in the history of tho world?
Tho time has come for a chango
cf oliey. Tho pension list is
uiamfettly swollen with fraudulent
ami unworthy pensioners. If the
roll cannot bo purified, and tho
annual expenditure cut down to
the thirty millions or bo winch
Gen. Garfield declared to bo the
maximum ehort of unwarrantable
extravagance, then tho Dependent
and Disability act would bo better
rejK-aled outright

Judge 8. P. Newcomb is np
from Las Cruces, nnd is domiciled
at tho Tremont He informs the
Enterpriso that the democrats
ppent over $23,000 to carry Dona
Ana county and resorted to every
ppocio of fraud and crime. Men
wera openly and publicly bought.
The ballot box of about tho only
republican precinct in the county
was being brought to Las Cruces,
the box was broken opeu and tho
poll book and ballots taken out,
and have not yet arrived at the
county ccat On a good many of
the offices tho voto was close, and
should a contest yet bo instituted
the chances are that enough fraud
ulent votes could bo thrown out
to elect half tho county ticket

Wo, having always given Judge
Newcomb credit for truthfulness,
"believe the obovo to bo a misinter
pretation of his statement For
Judgo Newcomb had no means
whatever for arriving approxi
mately even, at tho amount epent
by the democrats. AikJ he has
absoluutly no data upon which to
base the statement that a ballot
box was taken by forco and rifled
of its contents. He knows simply
that tho ballot box has not reached
íere, and he is too cautious to
mako such an accusation without
ability to sustain himself.

Tho Territorial legislature will
meet a week from licit Monday,
and from that time until tho closo
of tho 6esson all eves in New
Mexico will le turned to Santa IV.
This legislature will have ques
tions of great inqortanco to deal
with and a great deal of good leg
islation is expected.
The chango of venuo law, which
ia ono of tho most pernicious laws
on tho statute books of tho Terri
tory, must be repealed if the will
of the people is to be respected.
A hundred law-abiding citizens of
the Territory cannot be found
who are in favor of tho law. It
was framed and passed in tho in
terest of a few lawyers of the Ter
ritory and their clients and has
operate 1 to defeat tho ends of jus
lice besides being a tourco of great
inconvenience and exjicnso to peo-
i . . .
pie wuo nave to attonU court as
witnesses. Tho repeal of this law
need take but little of the timo of
tho legislature at Santa Fo this
winter.
Tho feo Bystem will need more
attention. A general revision of
tno laws in relation to the pay
mcnt of officials is needed, and in
order to do this properly, consider
ablo time will be consumed. The
erritory has arrived at a point
where retrenchment in the public
expenses is imperative. Taxpay
ers aro groaning under the heavy
burdens now imposed upon them
aud in order to preserve tho credit
of the Territory and the various
counties composing it, there must
bo a large' reduction in expenses,
3oth political parties are pledged
to a reduction of the fees paid of
ficials tin J tho legislator who votes
ainst tí reduction of tho exorbi
tant fees now being paid will have
no political futuro in Nuw Mexi
co. . .
Thero aro nwiny other matters
which will need attention, but tho
feo system and tho change of ven
ue law aro the principal ones and
tho Territory will not suffer if
thero bo no other legislation ex
cept on the two matters mention
cd above aud the regular appro
priations.

The total voto this year was 31,-

tax law.
The teachers in tho public
schools hero havo not been paid
tor two months, aud thero is no
money in the treasury to pay
them. This is the largest schoo
district in Grant County and it
aceñas that thero ought to be
money in tho treasury to pay the
teachers if it has not been applied
to other payments than that of
the teachers. All tho money
raiseü oy special tax which was
voted on property in tho city last
spring goes into tho school fund
of this district and in addition to
this special tax tho district gets
its share out of the general schoo
fund which is raised by a tax of
threo mills on tho dollar ou al

Iroiu saloon licenses, liut one
other district in tho county has
aslargoafuud raised from licen
ses, iu proportion to the schoo

that district has no city nchot

school population, is raised in this
district for school purjnwes than
is raised in any other district in
tho County aud yet tho teachers
aro not paid.
j
TllE annual report of the treas
urer of the Uuited States bhows
nn estimated surplus of $2,000,
000 for the present fiscal year but
it is more than probable that there
will be deficit instead of a surplus,
but, of course, an estimated deficit
would not look well in tho last
annual rejort of tho republican
treasurer of tho Uuited States
and, as ho has only to do with es
timates, it is not a dilicult matter
to bring out a email surplus.
A viGOitors effort is being made
in Washington to get tho bill for
the admission of New Mexico
through the Benate. Several resi
dents ot the .territory are now in
Washington urging the admission
of tho Territory and there appeys
to bo very little opposition from
any quarter. Thero is hardly
reason to doubt that tho Territory
will bo admitted and that the oil
for tho admission of Arizona wil
bo passed at the samo timo. Utah
and Oklahoma may also be admit
ted but there will bo strong objec
tions raised ngaiust tho admission
of these territories at present.
The Santa Fe New Mexican
it "tit
appears to do considerably exer
cised over the prospect of the re
moval of tho capital from the
ancient, city.. Its fears aro we
founded aud it will not be many
moons before tho peoplo of this
Territory will vote on the question
and Santa Fe will bo in tho soup,
The only way that Santa Fo can
remain as a capital city will be for
tho people of that ancient burg to
secure a division of tho Territory
and cut off enough from tho
northern end to make it certain
that Santa ' Fe can retain tho
capital. Poor old Santa Fe!

There is no roanon why interest

TllE international monetary
conference has accomplished
nothing and there is no reason
to expect that it will accomplish
anything. , The idea of having a
conference originated with the
leaders of the republican party
who wanted Bomo excuse for not
coming out tupuart-ly on tho silver
(juestioii. Many republicans who
were in favor of the free and un
limited coinage of silver, support
ed tho populibt ticket because they
had no faith in the conference or
its projectors. The sentiment in
favor of freo coinage is growing
rapidly in this country and the
