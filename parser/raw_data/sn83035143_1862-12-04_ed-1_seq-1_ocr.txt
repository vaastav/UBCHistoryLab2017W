What is Thought of the Message in Washington.
A dispatch from Washington says that
the President'! Message if spoken of on
all hands as the best written and best
considered of any he has submitted. It is
certainly a well-written, concise and in
telligible document.
Illness of Senator Doolittle.
The Madison Journal states that Senator
Doolittle is ljing quite ill of a fever. The
Journal says; "It will be remembered
that some time since he lost a son, who had
contracted a fever while in the army.
8ince then nearly every member of the
family has been attacked with it, and it
has now prostrated Judge Doolittle himself."
Promotions.
Brigadier-General Hartsuff, of Michi
gan, who was especially prominent in the
earlier West-Virginia campaigns, has been
promoted to a Major-Generalship, and
Colonels Mohr, of the 28th Ohio, and Ly
tic, of the 10th, to Brigadiers.
Complete Success of the Passaic.
The new Monitor Passaic made the trial
voyage to Fortress Monroe in a perfectly
oceetaful manner. By an improvement
upon the Monitor, the leakage about the
turret was entirely prevented. Trouble
had been feared at sea from the impossi
bility of using the compass in any ordi
nary manner, without its being affected by
the great mass of iron around it. This
was obviated by the ingenious arrange
ment of a looking-glass reflecting the
movements of the compass to the wheels
man, the compass itself being far removed
from the deadening influence of the iron
house.
As to its sea-going qualities, a corres
pondent writes to the Tribune :
" The third principle tried is the general
sea-going qualities of the new Monitors.
Being water-tight, where alone water
could always come, they are safe. If
waves reached the top of the turret, they
may wash over but cannot drown any
body. The steadiness of the craft is won
derful. Moving through the roughest tide,
she is as free from rolling as one could
well imagine; with fine engines she might
team around the world. We are ordered
to Washington. What is the business on
hand for us it is not for me to say if I
knew. Bnt Monitor No. 2 is successful,
and that is good news enough for one letter."
General Gilmore Again Snubbed.
' We have several times alluded to the
pro-slavery orders of General Q. A. Gill
more, who is engaged in returning fugi
tive slaves in Kentucky. The following
correspondence between the General and
CoL Atkins, of the 92d Flinois, is interest
ing. The General did not make much out
of Colonel Atkins :
LEXINGTON, KY., Nov. 18. 1862.
Coiokel : It is reported to me that a
civil process is to be served in your camp,
and Judge Robertson requests me to drop
you a line, intimating the course I pursue
in such cases.
I invariably recognise the civil law in
all its operations, as martial law does not
exist hare in Kentucky.
We have no right to resist the execution
of any civil prnfu, and an attempt to do
so would render us amenable to the severe
laws of this State. lean give you no or
der, but would for the good of the cause
recommend that the civil authorities be
respected always.
Tour obedient servant,
Q. A. GILLMORE, Brig. General.
Col. Atkins, Present.
To the above document Colonel Atkins
made the following satisfactory and sensi
ble reply :

November 19th, 18G2. J
G Email: I have your note. I beg to
state that I am under orders to proceed
southward with my command, and I do
not know at what moment I may find the
enemy, and I cannot afford to fiddle away
my time in hunting up niggers or in re
plying to bills in chancery filed against
me. When the war is over, and I am at
leisure, I will answer any civil process,
but I beg to assure you, General, that I
am now altogether too busy with a terrible
rebellion and bloody war, to be fooling
away my time in writing answers to bills
in chancery filed by secession sympathis
ers. I have not resisted and do not expect
to, for I have not a single nigger in my
possession at all, but I cannot stop to an
swer formally in court.
Your obedient servant,
SYITH D. ATKINS, Colonel.
Q. A. Giu.-oas. Brigadier-General.
A New Speculation.
A Washington dispatch reports this
latest specimen of fraudulent speculation :
"An enterprising Western chemist has
been attempting to engineer through the
Surgical Department the adoption of gran
ulated beef tea, as an addition to hospital
stores, for the entire army, which he pro
posed to furnish. The Surgeon General
was on the point of giving a heavy order
for it, bnt an analysis being made, it was
found to contain no beef or muscle at all,
and to be simply a preparation of starch.
The speculation would have been one of
very handsome proportion, and it came
very near being successful."
Ohio Democratic Plans.
There was quite a reunion of the lately
elected Democratic Congressmen of Ohio at
Columbus on Thanksgiving day. The fol
lowing dispatch to the New Tork Times is
an intimation as to what wasgdiscussed :
"It is stated that the Democratic Con
gressmen elect from Ohio intend to make
a formal demand upon the President that
the political prisoners from that State shall
either be released or have a speedy trial."
The Sentiments of Russia.
The Journal de St. Petersburg publishes
the following statement :
"We believe that the foreign powers
have no right whatever to interfere in
America. We also believe that no other
Intervention would be possible than one
similar to the advice which Russia has
constantly tendered in a friendly spirit
since the commencement of the struggle.'
. The New York Herald says that so far
as medical supplies and stores are con
cerned, General Banks' expedition will be
well cared for. The steamer Honduras has
been chartered by the Government to trans
port the supplies. Dr. E. H. Alexander,
as experienced army surgeon, has been
appointed Medical Director, and seven
hospital stewards, independent of the or
dinary regimental stewards, are also at
tached. That's What's the Mimi ! The Col
' ambus Crisis, Ohio, says the Republicans
of Iowa have gained their last'vietory.
That's what the Tory sheets of this State
have been saying for the last eight years 1
Meanwhile, the Republican majority has
increased from 1,000 to 13,000. There is
no falling off this year. The army vote
kind o' getsj the Philistines. Iowa State

CLEVELAND, THURSDAY MORNING. DECEMBER

NO. 289.
Application for Pensions.
From the report of the Commissioner of
Pensions we quote the following, which is
of interest to all contemplating an appli
cation for a pension :
i " In this connection it seems proper to
refer to certain erroneous impressions
which have prevailed in eome quarters, as
to the existence of serious obstacles, and
the interposition of needless and burden
some formalities, in the prosecution of a
just claim for a pension. So far are all
such representations from being correct,
that I do not hesitate to say that any
claimant of ordinary intelligence and edu
cation can, on applying directly to this
office for forms and instructions suited to
the particular ease,-establish his claim, .
and secure its prompt admission, without
any other aid than that which will readily
be given him by the magistrate before
whom his declaration is to be executed.
Nothing is required of the claimant which
is not necessary, and, in most instances,
conveniently attainable.
' " The applicant for an invalid pension,
for example, if a private soldier, must (1)
state, under oath, the company and regi
ment in which he served, and the time,
place and manner in which he incurred
the disability on account of which he
claims a pension ; also furnishing proof,
by two witnesses, that the claimant is the
identical person he represents himself to
be. If the papers for his discharge have
been made out as required by the army
regulations, this, in most cases, is all that
will be needed on his part to secure the
allowance of a well-founded claim. The
Certificate of his commanding officer and
that of the Surgeon, who attended him,
furnishing together the best evidence as to
the nature, origin and degree of his disa
bility, are transmitted to this office by the
Adjutant-General, without any interven
tion of the applicant. But if, for any rea
son, these certificates are wanting or not
satisfactory, then on a call from this office,
the applicant must (2) furnish the certifi
cate of some commissioned officer of his
company, if possible, and if not, the affida
vit of his non-commissioned officers or pri
vates who were in service with him, con
firming hisown allegations in regard to
the time, place and manner of incurring
his disability, showing the same to have
been in the service of the United States,
and in the line of duty ; and he must also
be examined by a surgeon authorized to
make such examination, as to the nature
and degree of the disability, whose certifi
cate will be transmitted to this office.
Without this amount of proof it is clear
that no claim can be properly admitted.
Nor is there any difficulty in procuring
such proof, in exact accordance with pre
scribed forms, if the case is a just and hon
est one.
" So, too, of a widow's application for pen
sion. A declaration setting forth the ser
vice of her deceased husband, and other
requisite facts within her own immediate
knowledge, as specified in the printed
instructions, has only to be accompanied
by proof of her identity, of her marriage
and of the death of her husband by reason
of some injury or disease resulting from
his service, and incurred in the line of
duty, to secure a favorable consideration of
her claim. The time, place, and cause of
the husband's death is usually shown by the
record of the Adjutant-General's office,
(and obtained without any instrumentality
of the applicant,) leaving for her to prove
merely, that she is the person she repre
sents herself to be, and the fact of her
marriage to the deceased."
The Shooting Match in Germany.
Letters from Frankfort contains copious
particulars of a great German shooting
match shortly to take place in that city,
and at which four hundred rifle clubs and
upwards of four thousand riflemen have
already announced their intention to be
prtBent. It is expected that six thousand
marksmen will compete. Every rifle club
sends some prise to be shot for; various
other societies and corporations have con
tributed gifts for the same purpose. It is
said that the prises thus received or an
nounced amount to five hundred. Among
them are many rifles, double-barrelled
fowling pieces, revolvers, hunting-knives,
silver cups, gold watches, and objects
of the most varied description. The city
of Fiankfort gives a prize of one
thousand seven hundred fllorins, (about
145.), an anonymous society has sent two
thousand florins to be shot for in two
prises, another nameless donor contributes
a silver basin -containing twenty-five
ducats; oil paintings by old masters, com
plete sets of Goethe's works, choice wines
and kirechwasser in casks and cases, eil-Ter-mounted
yataghans, and a host of
other articles, are among the contribu
tions. The German residents in Amster
dam have sent a costly silver table service
to be shot for, and at Frankfort a number
of ladies have formed a society, and have
produced most magnifioent banner for
the rifle club of that place.
On the first instant, was published at
Frankfort, the first number of the " Offi
cial Festival Journal, for the Universal
German RifleJFestival held at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
in 1862.'.' Up to the first of
July, three thousand five hundred Ger
mans and six hundred and thirty-two
Swiss had announced their intention of
competing. The preparations are on an
extensive scale. A vast temporary hall
has been erected, capable of containing
some five thousand persons, which will be
used for meetings and oratory, judging
from the fact that it is provided with a
tribune for speakers and a table for re
porters; also for dining, for it contains
two hundred tables for twenty persons
each. There is a kitchen two hundred feet
long, ample cellerage and store-rooms.
Extensive contracts have been made with
the Frankfort tradesmen, and much eating
and drinking seems to be reckoned upon.
One brewery furnishes one thousand five
hundred barrels of beer, and the trifling
quantity of eighty-seven thousand bottles
of wine is mentioned by the local journals
as having been contracted for.
Sharon Iron and Steel Works.
The extensive Rolling Mill at Sharon,
Pa., recently purchased by Coleman, West
erman & Cc, was put into practical opera
tion Monday last. They have already
commenced the manufacture of bar and
sheet iron, and in a few weeks expect to
have their nail and spike department in
full operation. In addition to these they
will make railroad iron for coal banks, and
in the Spring will enter upon the manu
facture of steel springe and axles. The
concern, when in full blast, will employ
between three and four hundred hands, and
will be one of the most extensive iron
works in the western country. Success to
the enterprise. Mahoning Register.
The Ambulance Corps of General Banks'
Expedition.
To the Editoe of the New Yoke Tikes
Sim : Permit me to correct a statement
of your Washington correspondent upon
the subject of ambulances for the expedi
tion nnder Major General Banks. The
corps when organized will consist ot 150
ambulances, 86 medical wagons, and from
800 to 1,000 men, with the necessary offi
cers. It has been the practice for the men
to leave their ranks to assist the wounded
to the rear. In future this will be strictly
forbidden. The ambulance corps will be
on the field and in constant attendance, to
remove the wounded and insure them im
mediate aid. -
Nov. 24. R.
terrible Rebel Srasshter at An tie tarn.
j An officer of the 15th Georgia regiment
writes to the Savannah Republican a let
ter, which shows that the slaughter of the
rebels in the battle of Antietam has not
been exaggerated, at least in regard to the
regiments whose movements he witnessed.
He says:
J " The fifteenth were posted in a narrow
path, washed out into a regular gully, and
were fired into by the enemy from the
front, rear and left flank. The men stood
their ground nobly, returning the fire un
til nearly two-thirds of their number lay
dead or wounded in that lane. Out of two
hundred and ten carried into the fight over
one hundred and twenty-five were killed
and wounded in less than twenty minutes.
The slaughter mu horrible. When ordered
to retreat I could scarcely extricate my
self from the dead and wounded around
me. A man could have walked from the
head of our line to the foot on their bodies.
The survivors of the regiment retreated
very orderly back to where General Ander
son's brigade rested. The brigade suffered
terribly. James South Carolina Battalion
was nearly annihilated. The 15th Geor
gia lost nearly all their commissioned
officers." At night only fifty-five men of
the 15th remained fit for duty. They were
over forty-eight hours without anything to
eat or drink.
How Floyd was Foiled.
A Fort Delaware correspondenturnish
es the Pittsburgh Dispatch with the follow
ing little bit of history : ,
"A day or two since, I obtained some
particulars in relation to Floyd's attempt
ed shipment of heavy artillery from Pitts
burgh, which, in the absence of individual
names, might, nevertheless, be of some in
terest. These pieces, ostensibly ordered
for Ship Island, near New Orleans, were
really intended for Fort Morgan, at the
entrance of Mobile Bay. The platforms were
constructed at Watervliet; but, as the en
gineer foresaw treason in the Secretary of
War,they were purposely made three inches
too short, with other defects which render
ed them useless for Fort Morgan, but quite
suitable for a new work at the opening of
New York harbor. Other platforms were
then ordered. The glacis, or outside were
prepared for their reception and Foit Mor
gan was pushed to completion. Floyd had
all things-ready for the great guns at Pitts
burgh, when events were precipitated by
the rash treason of South Carolinians, and
the rebels lost both guns and platforms.
Union Among Common Friends in Congress.
j There never was a party that had so
many reasons for and inducements to con
cert of action as the party composed of the
friends of the war and the General Admin
istration. They have a country to serve
and to save, and they have immense politi
cal interests to rescue from injury and
destruction. If they are not thoroughly
united they lose both country and party,
and give the advantage to partisans whose
hopes are all concentrated in the separation
ot the Union, and whose party is in active
sympathy with the rebellion. The Union
men in the comming short session of Con
gress, as the representatives of the Union
people, should conscientiously consider the
relation to their vast constituency, and
their duty in the premises. If they can
move in serried columns, they may accomp
lish much before the 4th of March, 1863;
but if they are divided, fatal and irrepar
able evils will ensue. The only basis of co
operation is the policy of the President of
theJUnited 8 tales in all its details. Those
who oppose or embarrass that policy can
of course be regarded as the epen adver
saries of the Administration. There are
decided majorities in both branches of Con
gress in favor of this policy, and if these
majorities can be vitalized and made to
move in harmony, the happiest results will
follow. Washington Chroniale.
A Connecticut Secessionist Outdone.
A secessionist, who lives between Shef
field and Canovan, Connecticut, attempted
to raise a flag, but a loyal neighbor was
resolved that he should not Getting all
ready for hoisting, he seized the rope and
began to pull, but the patriot pulled also
on the other rope.. The secessionist thought
to tire the Union man out, and hung on; the
neighbor sent for his supper and the seces
sionist for his lunch. When the Union
man called also for a buffalo skin for his
bed over night, the secessionist gave in,
bundled up his flag, and went home amid
the cheers of a crowd. Ar. Y. Post,
"Nothing to Take Back." An incident
occurred on the occasion of the recent visit
of Vallandigham to Mansfield which is
worthy of being put on record. After the
speeches had been made in the afternoon,
three gentleman entered an omnibus, at
one of the hotels, to ride to the railroad
station, and seated in it was another gen
tleman unknown to them. After these
gentlemen were seated, one of them remark
ed to another: "did you hear Vallandigham
this afternoon 7" "iTo" replied the other,
indignantly, "it would be more creditable
tolisten to Jeff. DaviB himself than to
that contemptible traitor Vallandentootin
ham." Hen the Btanger started up and
putting on a severe look, and an extra
amovnt of dignity, said fiercely: "am Mr.
Vallandigham!" "It don't make a bit of
difference, nrmly replied the gentleman;
" I have nothing to take back." This com
pletely cowed the pint of butternuts, and
he slunk into his seat, and remained en
tirely dumb during the remainder of the
Irip.Bucyrtu Journal.
A Naval Curiosity.
The New York Poet says: "Sometime
since the Ensrlish naners ftnnnnn that -
'dashing steam yacht' was preparing for

- . jrvA, u iuuuimicu lUtt L
she ' would soon be heard from in Amer
ica.' She was described as 'a splendid
little craft, swift as a deer, and trim us a
hunter.' There is now at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard, a vessel which is supposed to be the
one alluded to. She is called the Ouchita,
and was captured in trying to run the
blockade. She is a beautiful model of na
val architecture, and will make a service
able companion for the diminutive man-of-war
America, another swift little craft,
which has been seen in England at
Cowes."
The report of the Adjutant General will
show that there are about 600,000 men in
the field, and nearly 15,000 in hospitals.
Operations of draft are not alluded to as
very satisfactory.

Ma. W. K if abC, Baltimore, Dear 8lr:I have great
vleaaure In certifying that I have tried yon fcauare
rianoa, anu nna ineiLrtMjuAi, n n. supenur, m u
ii. thio country. Among their great qualities which
dUtioKuifb them, is the even new of tone, the agree
able aud easy touch, and volume of tone. Wishing
you all the success you so highly deserve,
I am, Sir, yours very truly,

Translation From tbe French.)
After having piayed.on the Pianos oi Messrs. Enabe
k (Jo., it is impossible not to boar testimony to their
tioalitif s, which have acquired fur them the eminent
reputation which they enjoy. Tbe Pianos ot their
manufacture, on which I havt played, are eTcoedin'
ly rptnarkaMe for their qualities ot rout. The Bxo
Upnwe.-fol, without harshness, and the apper notes
vUtfU- Uid harmoniously mellow, (chrystilian,)
and I do not hesitate to express in regard to tberte in
struments my entire at inaction, and to declare that
they are equal if not saaerior to the best manufac
tured in ur'tor this country by tho mmt ceii-bra-ted
makers. IbiguW I. At. OOTTbCHA LK.
To Mosars. Wi. Khavb k CO., Baltimore : I can
not bnt congratnlate you upon th Imuwwe pronrreas
Improvements which you continually make on
yoar Pianos, which in my opinion, r&MK among toe
vary uoab iu uiwuiuj!
Mr. Geo. A. Bablow : These noble Instruments
possess Immense resource oi power ana expression.
Th baas is sonorous and taTand : the middle red ister.
rich and sympathetic ; while the high notes are brit
taot, clear and pore as silver bells.
The scale Is even without a single Saw; the action
hissDOOtband marvelou-lyeasy ; and the pedal etlects
the Soest of wnicn toe nanoiorte is suscepiiDie.
la a word, Knabe'e Pianos are worthy of the great
est Artists, and are capable of rendering the hnest
oomtvositions known in this realm of Art,
ELIZA bHEr-HKBD,

Mr. O. A. Basxow, Dear Sir : It (rives mo pleasure
U7tate that 1 consider ine ivnaoe riano oquai voany
and auperior to most imtrumoots made in thiscoon
rrw sssr-i.vilT In richness and volume of tone.
IlBTing osdd one of the same for ten or more hoars
of each day, lor two years, 1 feel confident in rocom
tnondlng them to all who are unacquainted with their
"great quamiea, a aiu, o5Mx.uim , uum,
" tCc. P. LKltNKT),
Teacher of Music, Cleveland Female Seminarr.
O. A. Baklow, Dear Sir: It gives me much pleas
ure to be able to say. that I considor Knabe's Pianos
he finest, both In volume and swwtness.wbich I have
vtver played npoa, either in America or (Europe.
The pdals operate with better effect than in any
.ttLerinstramenU: and in fact, Knabs's motto may
trui - "JtxceUior." Mrs. O. 8. DOUGLAS,
- Teacher of Music, Cleveland.
prtf- H. J. NoTHJf AQLW, Teacher of Mnsle In the
Ohio Btaw Blind Asylum, writes: "After examining
a lark v a amber of VVm. Knabe k Oo's Piano Fortes,
1 uiih wsttaliiiffty pronounce them superior to any I
have st-. Their tone is grand and noble; they have
rrvt oj wStr fcr sustaining the sound ; and their
vol arne of tons or power 1 have never heard excelled.
They ees, bina with a fine touch, depth, sweetness of
tone, pun 7 and durability."
"That th t Knabe Piano Is superior to all others
made in th. s country, tor brilliancy, sweetneaa, and
volume of U me, needs only to be heard to convince fo
the tact." Ute Journal, Columbus, Ohio.
