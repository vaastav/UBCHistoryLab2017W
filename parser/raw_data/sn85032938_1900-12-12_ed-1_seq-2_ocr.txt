EDITORIAL NOTES.
Senator Stewart, who did active
work for the party during the late
campaign, has had his name put back
on the republican caucus list.
Senator Hanna says the republican
motto at this session of congress is
"Do business."
Hon. Benjamin Harrison is in
Washington, as a lay member of the
national committee of Presbyterians
now in session there to consider the
creed question.
Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt scored a
scoop when she declined to become a
candidate for the presidency of the
daughters of the American Revolution
Perhaps it was only to convince his
new father-in-law that there were no
frills on his ducal coronet that the
Duke of Manchester went through a
"cake walk" in Xew York.
If the French are not careful they
may find themselves Krugered into
trouble with England.
Wisconsin proposes to pass a law
requiring all applicants for mar
riage licenses to pass a medical ex
amination before being permitted to
marry. The experiment will be
watched with interest.
Ocm Paul Kruger has decided to
take up his residence at The Hague.
Congress has made an excellent
start toward making this a strictl
business session.
Senor Degetau, Porto Rial's first
delegate to congress, said of his con
stituents: "My people want to become
root and branch Americans. We can
not do it too quickly."
If it pleases the sultan of Turkey
to pay those American missionary
claims in a round about way, this
government was not disposed to ob
ject. Our demand was that the
claims should be paid.
The democratic leaders iu congress
are showing a very commendable dis
position, in their talk, to put no fac
tious obstructions in the way of legis
lation in line with the mil of the peo
ple, as expressed at the polls.
President McKinley's message to
congress furnishes more proof, if it
were needed, of the wisdom of the
people in re-electing him.
Italy isn't getting its share of pros
perity. Its government is wrestling
with a deficit, about two-thirds of
which its minister of the treasury
soys to its participation in the China
expedition.
The bill for the reduction of the
war tax contemplates a lopping joff of
about 510,000,000 annually. The list
of articles from which the tax is to be
removed is quite lengthy and includes
conveyances, mortgages, shipping re
ceipts, bank checks, money orders
and telegraph messages.
Chas. A. Towne has been appointed
as United States senator from Minne
sota, to succeed Senator Davis, de
ceased. Congressman Boutelle, of Maine,
who has been hovering between life
and death for some time has resigned
his seat in congress.
Dr. 0. L. Geer, of this county, is
being talked of for speaker of the
house of representatives in the next
legislature. Dr. Geer is eminently
qualified for the position.
Ooin Paul shed renl tears of sor
row on account of the snub given
him by Emperor William of Ger
many. His reception at The Hague
was so cordial and enthusiastic that
he was moved to tears of joy.
A telegram from Washing says that
Brigadier-General Chas. P. Eagan,
commissary general who was suspend
ed during the Spanish war, has xen
restored to duty by the president and
immediately placed on the retired list.
General Egan's many Arizona friends
will be rejoiced to learn of this.
One of our contemporaries asserts 1
that that western girl who let a kiss
on every state carried by McKiuley,
has refused to pay up. That will do
to tell. Xo girl who bets a kiss where
she is dead sure to lose, will refuse to
pay, and jMrticularly no western girl.
The papers announced the other
day that Jones and Bryan had had a
long talk over the telephone. LateJ
they announced that Jones declared
that Bryan wouldn't run again. Evi
dently, the wires got crossed. It was
Graver that Jones was talking to.
Judging from the election returns,
the fifteen millions or so increase in
the country bince 1S90 were nearly all
republicans.
South Dakota has just reiKMled its
state disixjnsary law. Neither it nor
Pettigrew has turned out to Ixj as
irood as they were cracked up to be.
Th tVuKXjnits are claiming that
..oeut wonderful export trade of
the United States, which can no
longer be denied, just "hapKmed''
and that tho McKiuloy administration
had nothing to do with it. This is a
little too thin. Such things come
about by, wisdom and management
and not by chance.
The Sultan of Turkey will find
himself dancing a livuty jig to a tuuo
whistled by Uncle Sam before he is
much older.
Senator Pettif jrew has been keeping
quiet, but his sou, who was with the
Boer army, has bobbed up to say that
the Boers will win yet. But he
wasn't sure enough of it to stay over
there to participate in their trimiipln
The mid-road pops, who are to hold
a national conference, might make a
scoop by nominating Bryan for 1901.
Chicago's manufacturing growth
may be judged from the fact that it is
now consuming 20 per cent more coal
than it did one year ago.
Congress would do well to follow
the recommendation of Fourth As
sistant Postmaster General Bristow
for additional legislation against
green goods and lottery swindlers,
which will close the express and tele
graph companies to the swindlers.
General Jos Wheeler said in a
speech the otherday: "I believe that
under a good government the Fili
pinos will become a race of which we
may be proud. I think they are
vastly superior to the Mexicans."
The country already controls the
iron and steel trade of the world, and
present indications are that it will
soon control the coal trade also.
Of course congress will provide for
the necessary increase iu the army.
While the democrats will probably
nearly all vote against the bill, it is
not likely that nuy considerable num
ber of them will dare to attempt to
otherwise obstruct its passage.
Miss Helen Gould very modestly
said when asked to write an article on
"How to Make the Most of Wealth"
that she was not well qualified to
speak, although willing to tell what
she knew. Thousands of tho soldiers
of the Spanish war. Who t-hared in her
noble benefactions, think that she is
living the answer to the question.
Dave Hill hasn't been doing any
talking for publication since the elec
tion; he has been too busy chuckling
and shaking hands with himself.
Xow that even Hoke Smith has
given him a few kicks it looks as
though Mr. Bryan is down for keeps.
Chairman Jones has recovered the
use of his tongue sufficiently to an
nounce that the country's prosperity
was what re-elected McKinley. His
eyesight must also have improved, as
he said before election that he could'nt
see the prosperity.
A bill has been introduced iu con
gress providing for the admission of
Oklahoma as a state.

The czar of Russia is reported to bo
convalescing and there is hope yet
that the peace of the world may not
bo shattered.
Possibly Germany is opposed to
the partition of China for the same
reason that Russia is. Each of Ihom
wants the whole thing;
Iu was most unkind of Oom Paul to
n -gleet to mention Webster Davis in
his speech at Marseilles. But perhaps
it would only be throwing bad words
after good to do so.

This government's hint pcems to
have had a good effect upon the for
eign ministers at Pekiu, who are now
really trying to agree instead of to
disagree, It is their last chance. If
they fail, the work will lie put in more
capable hands.
According to Jones of Arkansas
Bryan will henceforth decline nomi
nation for the presidency. He has
sworn off, says Jones. Xow we kuow
beyond a doubt that the Xebraska
man has already begun to lay his
plans for the next nomination.
We knew it would come! As soon
as the United States gets prosperous
Sarah Bernhardt comes over for an
other farewell tour and carries off its
surplusage.
Tho death of Hoyt, the farce writer,
will leave a gap hard to fill. In the
words of Shakespeare, the world
could have better spared a t tetter

alizes the debt it owes to its fun mak

At the city election held in Los An

elected nearly all of the other officers
having a majority in the cit3- council

nil the other officers except one. The
republican candidate was named Sil

"The Courier does not believe that
Govomor Murphy is sincere in his
statehood talk," so says our contem
porary. Xow really that is too
awfully bad, but Governor Murphy
will go right along working for state
hood just the same as though he had
the implicit confidence of the Courier
iu his work. Men who are not iu
favor of statehood, under present con
ditions, and be it known that there
are many such, find fault with Gover
nor Murphy, being too much in ear
nest, and have unbounded confidence
in his sincerity, as well as in his abil
ity, to secure statehood if any one
can.
NEW WAR SHIPS.
The secretary of the navy on Satur
day opened bids for tho construction
of naval vessels which will cost up
ward of $r0,000,000. H. L. Scott, of
the Union iron works, San Francisco,
and representatives of the Cramps
and other ship building concerns were
present. The bids call for the con
struction of five first class battle
ships and six armored cruisers. The
battle ships are expected to take front
rank iu Uncle Sam's fleet. They will
lie known as the Xew Jersey, Penn
sylvania, Georgia, Virginia and
Rhode Island. They will have a dis
placoment of 1G.50G tons each and
will equal in xoint of fonnidalrility
any war craft afloat.
The crusiers will have a total of
sixty two guns rouging iu size from
8-ineh breech loaders, of which there
will be four, down to machineand auto
matic guns. The limit of the cost of
three of the cruisers is placed at
000,000 each, and of each of the other
three at 51,250,000. The maximum
time allowed for completion is thirty
six months for each vessel. If the
number and amount of the bids justify
it. the contracts will probably be dis
tributed among the leading ship
builders of tho country.
AN AZTEC MUMMY.
An
Alleged Discovery cf a Dried Up
Pre-Historic Man at Jerome.
The Jerome Xews gives an extend
ed account of the alleged finding of a
mummy in the United Verde mine.
The finding of a mummy is n pos
sible thing, but this alleged discovery
coining so closely on the heels of the
finding of the bogus petrified man
will make the story to be received
with a large dccoctioil of salt.
After giving a very plausible account
of the discovery the Xews spoils tho
story by claiming it to be that
of Montezuma, tho Aztec chief. The
plausible story of the find as given in
the Xews is a follows:
"The finding of a mummified man
somewhat similar to the shotgun used

of such weight that the average man
of today could not pose it for shoot

near him working tools all of which
were manufactured of tempered cop

during the first age of copper. The
body is well preserved but has evi
dently shriveled, yet man of the
mot important parts have undoubt

"The numerous articles found with
the body would signify that he was a
kiug of some renown.
"The find was made in a cave ex

HE TOOK THE CAKE.
What Our Society Editor Found on
tour of the Railroad Offices.
Mrs. Henry Collins made the cake
which was in itself a guarantee of
its goodness. Its appearance, how
ever, as it rested on tho desk of Mr.
Sarmiento's charming assistant (Mr.
Edwards is not referred to) was elo
quent of its merits. Its goodly pro
portions, and rich brown coloring car
ried most satisfactory suggestions to
those who expected to partake of it,
and furnished a proposition that soon
provided takers for a limited uumler
of opportunities to secure possession.
The event was called for the noon
hour, and Mr. Collins doubled the
amount he received for the cake, in
fees for privato instructions as to the
peculiar turn of the wrist calculated
to bring the six, uppermost.
All interested were on hand at the
appointed time, and the casting be
gan. Courtesy gave the charming as
sistant referred to, representation in
the affair, and casting by proxy, she

NEW PRESCOTT HOUSE.
An Instiution that Reflects Great Credit
on the City.
Among tho number of good, sub
stantial buildings that were destroyed
by the July fire was tho Prescott
house, a splendid brick structure, that
was of recent erection, but there has
sprung up from its ruins a new Pres
cott hotel that far exceeds tho old in
every way, being about twice the size
and modem in every particular.
Tho new Prescott hotel has just
thrown open Its doors to tho public,
and the Journal-Miner man was shown
ail through the building by its genial
and accommodating proprietor, Mur
ray Mclnernay.
The building is three stories high
with a frontage of fifty feet, contain
ing in all fif ty-seveu rooms, all new
and handsomely furnished, aud each
supplied with electric lights and call
bells. There are bath andtoilet rooms
on each floor, supplied with hot and
cold water. Also baggage and store
rooms for each floor. Two nicely fur
nished parlors front on Cortez street
and connect with verandas from
which a magnificent view of the city
can be had.
A metallic fire ecapfl has .been
placed at the rear of tho building
conveniently connected with the rear
verandas, thus insuring the safety of
the guests.
But the department in which Mr.
Mclncrnay takes most pride is the
dining room and kitchen. The
kitchen is probably the best equipped
of any in the territory, while tho din
ing room is the very ideal of coziness
and shows a master hand in arrange
ment. There are twelve tables with a
seating rapacity of about seventy
five. The tables are provided with
everything that tho market affords,
and the public is assured that no ex
pense or pains will be spared to make
this a leading feature of the new
Prescott hotel.
The new bar and office fixtures
which were furnished by the Chicago
Store and Office Fixtures company
are a marvel of beauty and stability.
The' are of high grade mahogany
finish, hand carved and decorated
with the fiuest French plate glass.
The bar mirror is one of the finest
ever brought to this country, being
50x1-1-1 inches, the largest size single
glass manufactured, and is of the
finest French plate, while everything
else in the office and bar room corre
sponds in beauty. The bar room is
presided over during the day by jolly
R. E. (Dick) Atkinson, who is well
known all over this section as a first
class mixologist and an all 'round
good fellow who has hosts of friends.
John Heck, late of Colorado, presides
behind the bar at night, and has al
ready made a large number of friends
by his courteous treatment of patrons
of the house.
Everything taken into considera
tion, the new l'rc&cott hotel starts out
with the brightest prospects and best
wishes of the citizens of Prescott for
its unlimited success.
A Shooting Woman.
The former Mrs. Thomas Fitch Jr.,
who formerly resided in Prescott, and
who will be remembered by many of
the old citizens of the plnce, shot a
man recently in Oakland, California,
with whom she had been living for
about two years. The man's name is
Conway, aud he is a tailor by trade.
The woman claims to be his wife, but
Conway claims that while they had
lived together for two years they were
never married. Tho woman claims
the shooting was done in self defense,
as she claims that Conway was ad
vancing toward her with a murderous
kuife in his hand, and as a warning
of what he might expect from her she
fired two shots in tho ceiling. These
having no effect she aimed the third
i at Couwaj- and it took effect in his
side, producing a wound from which
he may die. Since being divorced
from Tom Fitch Jr., several years ago,
Mrs. Fitch was married to aud di
vorced from a man named Peck, after
which she took up with Conway.
J. P. Dillon's health is improving
aud he is able to be up and around
some now.
