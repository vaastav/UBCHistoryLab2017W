COHON MARKETS
Continued Pressure and Little
Support Brings Further
Sharp Decline.
Monday Afternoon, Dec. 2.
further easiness was shown by the
speculative cotton market today, and
from the spot deparinifnt there came
nothin which mil til to offer much en
couragement to bullish effri? The
decline up to a short while before the
clone vas approximated $7.SQ a bale
from the htfh level made Just after
the opening, the lattr having come
without much explanation and lasting
but a few minuter. It was reported
that a threatened investigation by the
bureau of markets into the character
of the recent selling which hus broken
the market so much was responsible
tor some of the temporary display of
strength.
The general situation appears very
much the same as tt hag been There
is but little news coming to hand to
influence values and in most circles
apparently there is acceptance of the
th ory that commodity values must
work lower. That cotton should be no
exception is evidently the view of the
people who for the time being are
dominating trading The security mar
ket nr not wo weak as cotton, yet
i hey nr" gradually working dow nward
The strength in grains and provision
is apparently based on the statement
from official sources that demanda on
this country for food will for a long
time be larger than the have been.
The raising of the ban on exports
to allied and neutral countries, effec
tive today, scented of no effect, as
other tiungs of more Importance on
values art' rt to be done. The ex
pected granting of through bills of lad
ing has yet to materialise, but an
nouncement regarding thin is looked for
any day now In the meantime there
is little or no change in the rxwrt
situation and buyers are holding off,
which mean.- that storks in this coun
try sre Accumulating.

tame through about thru time and it
required but little pressure to start the
trend downward The dip extended
about 88 points, after which a moderate
amount of buying came from trade in
terests. The recovery extended about
N points, following wnlch a spell of
dullness came, followed by more liqui
dation and reported hedge selling In
the late afternoon, resulting in January
dropping to -4 53 and the list off in
proportion That was a break of about
I6rt points, yet buyers appeared to be
doing very little
In the belt there was little that was
new and definite ideas about the effect
on spot holders were not to be had.
Or) the surface there was little to In
dicate that anxiety prevailed, yet there
was probably much or It. Buyer.t were
holding off and the weather conditions
were such as to help enlarge the sup
ply. Opinion, however, seemed Influ
enced but little by estimates.
