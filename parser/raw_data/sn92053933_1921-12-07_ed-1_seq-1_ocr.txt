as Reason.
New York. Drc. 7. Dr. Adolpii

the opposit-ion u tis professional
activities in this country from the

my plans and reiurn to my beloved
Vienna.
"I harbor no malice against the
American prutes-jon and hope they
will soon rccousder and accept the
proffered hand of friendship with
their Austrian Vrethren. If once
the ice is broke, the current will
do the rest, and in the near future
a reconciliation must take place
anyhow.
Tried iu aln; Sorry".
"First, my grail mission was to
thank the American people for all
they have dona for the starving
Utile children cX Vienna. 1 did
not fail in this. My endeavors to
conciliate the profession failed. I
made super-huuim efforts; I tried
in vain; I am sirry."
Dr. Lorenz, hovever, did not dis
appoint the crippts who had gath

be carried oat by American doctors.
One of the firr. examined was
Marion Bird, 7-vf.ir-old niece of

When he was asked to comment
on Dr. Ixrenz' ;eception in this
country Father ruffy said:
"A nrsiii and a chaplain have
Arties that lie outride of the strange

When Dr. Lorcrz stopped to rest

to him:
"Dana Fools," ays Copeland.
"We have in America, a type of

DE VALERA HAS
NOTHING TO SAY
ON PEACE PACT
Carson Calls It Ab
iect Humiliation' for
England,
BULLETIN.
Belfast, Dec. 7. (By the As
sociated Press.) In a messajre
from Sir James Craig received
by Lady Craig at Katbeiland,
county Down, today, the Lister
premier said:
-It now appears to me that
peaoe may possibly be within
t-ifrul it' ail werk together to
that end with paiteflce and
g'ood will.'
Sir James told Uie Ulster
parliament today be did not
tnink it expedient to make any
statement with regard to the
details of the new Irish pro
posals, as there were ambig
uities "here and there in the
document".
London, Dec. 7. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) Ulster attitude to
ward tho establishment of the Irish
free state was expected to be de
fined today at a meeting of Sir j
James Craig's cabinet. j
A copy of the treaty, signed by !
the British and Sinn Fein peace j
delegates, reached Belfast yester-j
day while parliament was sitting,
but the premier delayed its presen
tation until he had time to study it.
Ulster Consent ot Jiecded.
Ulster's consent, however, is not j
necessary, as under the treaty .
terms .she is given the option of j
retaining her present status, after I
revision of her boundaries by a I
commission. j
Favorable action by the Dail :
Eireann is thought to bo fairly!
well assured, and that of the im-j
perial parliament, which has been 1
summoned to meet Dec 14. is a!
foregone conclusion should the!
Dail approve the treaty.
TrouMw Is Forecast.
Here and there, amid the gen
eral chorus of praise for the
agreement, however, are to be
heard sounded notes of Warning
that trouble may yet break out be
fore a final settlement is affected,
and this warning does not come
from quarters opposing the agree
ment. It is pointed out that nobody
has yet drawn from Lamona de
Valera, Irish republican leader, a
statement as to his attitude to
ward the plan,
In this connection tho Westmin
ster Gazette says:
"He (de Valera) will not openly
oppose the agreement if he can be
persuaded that it is for the perma
nent peace of Ireland."
"Not Out of Woods".
The newspaper also learns. If
says, that the government view is:
We ara not out of the woods
yet: there may still be trouble and
difficulties ahead.
In other quarters it is said that
the attitude of the Irish extremists
is causing anxiety to the delegates.
Those warnings, however, are ac
companied by expressions of hope
and belief that the difficulties can
be overcome.
The only opposing voice of con
sequence thus far is that of Sir
Edward Carson, former Ulster lead
er, who is quoted by the Morning
Post as derfaring:
"I never thought that I should
live to see a day of snch abject
humiliation for Great Britain."
The Westminster Gazette ex
presses the opinion that the Irisfi
republicans now in internment may
be g-fven amnesty immediately.
TRIAL OF BURGH

Introduction of 46 Letters From
Madalynne to Kennedy Is High
Spot In Murder Case.
Los Angeles, Calif., Dec 7. The
state's case against Arthur C
Burcn, on trial for the murder of
J. Belton Kennedy, insurance bro
ker, "has reached its peak" in the
opinion of attaches of the court
where the presentation of evidence
to a Jury is continued today.
The "peak," it waa declared, was
reached with the introduction of
46 letters, alleged to have been
written to Mr. Kennedy by Mrs.
Madalynne Obenchain, jointly in
dicted with Burch.
The prosecution, hoittwi, has
still to present evidence tend fug to
connect Burch wfth the actual

The government of President Car-

Berrera Is Prisoner.
Washington, Dec 7. Carlos Her

thrown in Guatemala in a revolu

was reported in advices to Ameri
can officials today to be a prison
er in his residence. Members of
the Herrera cabinet, the advices
said, were being held in the mili
tary prison.
About a dozen persons were
killed in the revolution, the official
advices received here today said,
and many have been arrested. The
Guatemalan capital was reported
quiet at the time the dispatches
were filed yesterday.
Revolt licsin Monday.
The revolution, began last Mon
day at midnight and waa accomp
lished by 5 o'clock Tuesday morn

The Guatemalan legation here
had received no word of the revolt
up to 11 o'clock today. Persons
here in close touch with conditions
in Guatemala, but outside official
circles, said the revolt was no sur
prise as the Liberal party, which
is believed here to have brought
about the revolution, has long been
opposed to the Herrera govern
ment, particularly in its action in
adopting the pact by which Gua
temala entered the recently created
Ceneral American Federation.
Adoption of the pact, Liberali
leaders claimed, was unconstitu
tional, as there was not present a
quorum when the Guatemalan leg
islature ratified the treaty.

Harding Speech One of Most
Remarkable Given Congress
By President, Lawrence Says
BY DAVID aVATYKEICE.
(Copyright, 192L)
(Special to The Argus.)
Washington, Dec 7. President
Harding's . address to congress is
in many respects one of the most
remarkable documents ever scut
by the executive to the legislative
branch of the government, remark
able for the many significant cir
cumstances which have made nec
essary an appeal for the solidarity
of political parties in America as
well as the plea for more executive
power with the promise that it
will- be prudently exercised.
Didn't Mention Party.
Mr. Harding didn't mention the
Republican party nor did he make
reference to the "agricultural bloc"
which threatens to become an in
surgent movement not unlike the
famous revolt which led to the Taft
Roosevelt split in 1911'. The fact
that the president devoted the very
beginning of his address to a plea
for party harmony as against sec
tionalism, is due to the tendency of
the agricultural west and south to
unite as against the manufacturing
east,, undermining the hold which
Democratic as well as Republican
leaders have hitherto had upon I
tneir respective followers of the
same political party in congress.
Presidtnt Harding has seen a coali
tion of Democrats and Republicans
become, so powerful as to force the
Republican majority to accept a
tax revision bill for which Mr.
Harding, with characteristic frank
ness, now says he would be insin
cere if he "accepted responsibility.
"It would suggest insincerity,"
says Mr. Harding, "if I expressed
complete accord with every ex
pression recorded in your roll
calls." and a sentence further the
president teils what is in his mind
when he adds: "Later on, when
other problems are solved I shall
make recommendations about re
DISORDERS ARE
SERIOUS THIRD
DAY OF STRIKE
South St. Paul Pack
ing Plant Patrolled
by Guardsmen.
Chicago, 111., Dec. 7. (By The
Associated Press.) The strike of
union packing bouse employes in
the larger centers outside of Chi
cago appeared more serious than
was at first anticipated, as the
third day of the strike began. The
walkout has already been marked
by disturbances in which a few
men were injured and authorities
in some places are preparing to
cope with any situation which may
arise.
"100 Per Cent Effective!
Union leaders insist that ths
strike is "100 per cent effective"
while the packers, although ad
mitting work is hampered In som
quarters, say that production, has
been only slightly affected.
Four hundred national guards
men patrolled the South St. Paul
packing district today, having been
ordered out after Adjutant-General
W. F. Rhixtow said the pickets at
the Armour plant failed to keep
their promise to permit employes
to enter the plant.
Mayor Burton of Kansas City
ordered all pickets off the streets,
saying they would not only be ar
rested at the yards, but anywhere
they might be carrying on activi
ties supporting the strike, in ac
cordance with the Kansas law for
bidding of picketing of places by
strikers.
Three Wounded In Ft. Worth.
Greater efforts were made by po
lice in Fort Worth, Texas, today to
control the situation, following the
serious woonding yesterday of
three men.
Two alleged strikers were shot
by a negro when they attempted to
stop him from boarding a car, and
the negro was beaten by a crowd.
Little disorder was reported from
the strike in Omaha, union leaders
there claiming that the plants will
be soon shut down, and packing
house officials saying the strike
will be broken.
No change in conditions has
been reported from East St. Louis,
111., or St. Joseph, Mo, but many
additional employes remained
away from the Chicago plants on
Tuesday.
DYNAMITE KILLS
100 IN PRUSSIA
Berlin, Dec 7. (By The Asso
ciated Press.) The bodies of only
13 of the more than 100 persons
killed in an explosion yesterday at
the Nobel dynamite works, at Saar
louis, Rhenish Prussia, have been
recorered, according to the latest
reports received here. The num
ber of injured has not been ascer
tained. The explosion, which occurred in
an o'l tank, destroyed the greater
part of tbe factory.

fered badly, roofs being blown off
and the walls collapsing. lire,
which started in the ruins spread to
newed considemtioii of oar - tax
problem."
Tax Bill Displeases.
This is the first public indica
tion that Mr. Harding isn't satis
fied with the tax bill which con
gress passed and which he signed.
There is of coarse a renewed dis
cussion of a sales tax as a new
method of taxation altogether but
Mr. Harding's address to congress
is the outgrowth of executive dis
content which has been known on
the inside for several weeks and
which has Just come to a head in
his message.
The president feels deeply on the
subject of the "agricultural bloc"
and the way it exerted its influence
in the making of the tax bill, and
here is his rebuke:
"I believe the political party in
power should assume responsibil
ity, determine upon policies in the
conference which supplements con
ventions and election campaigns,
and then strive for achievement
through adherence to the accepted
policy."
This was the doctrine of Wood
row Wilson, too, except that the
latter believed in the function of
the elected president as the party
leader and initiator of party poli
cies, a view which Mr. Harding
also shows signs of accepting.
Asks More Power.
The president made it clear that
he had no desire to encroach upon
the legislative branch of the gov
ernment or "to dictate" to con
gress but his meseage contains the
following requests for more author
ity and power to the executive than
is now possessed :
.First, the right to negotiate with
foreign governments concerning
the funding of war debts. Mr.
Harding promises that he will sub
mit the agreement reached to con
gress but must not be hindered by

MINERS ACCUSE
FARRINGTON OF
'BRAZEN FRAUD
Local at Springfield
Asks Lewis to Pros
ecute State Head.
Springfield, 111.. Dec. 7. Charg
ing action "which amounts to se
cession from the United Mine
Workers of America," two appeals,
aimed - against State President
Frank Farrington, and his admin
istration, were forwarded today to
International President John L.
Lewis by miners of local No. 413
of Springfield.
Criminal prosecutions are asked
against "these men in Illinois who
have brazenly defrauded district
No. 12."
Attacks Kansas Assessment.
The first appeal denies the right
of the Peoria convention to assess
Illinois miners $1 per month for
the help of Kansas miners in the
fight against the industrial court
on the ground that district 13 (Illi
nois) "has do power to levy assess
ments for any purposes other than
its own needs."
The local calls attention to the
fact that two months have passed
since the convention met and state
officers have taken no action obey
ing the request for the accounting
of funds spent in pressing the
"wild cat strike," although "they
have admitted they could do so."
This, the appeal says, amounts
to secession.
The international had also de
manded the accounting. The local
asks that steps be taken to compel
the accounting, and to protect the
funds of district No. 12 from diver
sion to private use. "We further
ask the international nnion to bring
all its influence to bear to have
these men in Illinois, who have
brazenly defrauded district No. 12,
by padded expense accounts and
other illegitimate means, and those
officials of district 12 who aided
them m such fraud, criminally
prosecuted."
Appeal is also lodged by the same
local against maintaining a 1 per
cent assessment on the grounds
that the district strike or defense
fund has been abolished and there
is now over 2,000,000 at the dis
posal of the board for general pur
poses and no necessity fo- such

FOUR POWER
PACT IS NOT
'ALLIANCE1
Nations Merely Agree to
Consult on Pacific
Matters.
Washington, Dec 7. (By the
Associated Press.) The four-power
agreement being considered by
tho United States, Great Britain,
Japan and France, it was learned
today from official American
sources, would be an agreement for
joint consultation on any matters
affecting interests of those nations
in the Pacific Islands and not an
alliance or technical ententes
WIU Go to Senate
The agreement is in process of
being reduced to treaty form, it
was said, and if accepted is to be
submitted to the senate.
The proposed undertaking is de
signed to do away with the Anglo
Japanese alliance and proposals
have gone to Japan for renuncia
tion of that alliance if the new
agreement should be consummat
ed. As now under negotiation the
agreement is to be limited to the
Pacific Islands.
Under the tentative proposals
each of the powers would agree
to consult each other before going
to war on any differences that
might arise relating to those is
lands. China, Yap Jfot Affected.
The agreement, American offi
cials said, would not deal with
fortifications in, the Pacific nor
with questions relating to the is
land of Yap.
Neither would it deal with any
matters affecting China but only
those relating to islands of the
Pacific
The questions at issue between
the United States and Japan re
lating to the cable facilities and
other matters affecting the island
of Yap are to be dealt with in a
separate treaty, which was said to
be near completion.
British Approve.
The proposed four-power agree
ment to deal with the Pacific Is
lands is said already to have been
given approval in principle by Brit
ish representatives at the Washing
ton conference.
The substance of the proposed
treaty also, it was said, has been
cabled to Tokio and Paris. The
formal responses of the British,
Japanese and French governments
still remain to be received, how

SMALL CASE IS

Park (11L) banker, today renewed
the attack on the conspiracy, em,-ot-z&leiueut
aud cunhaunce game

with misappropriation ot slate
funds. 1
The indictment should be quash
ed, Mr. Ltlorgee declared, because
Uiey are improperly drawn, vague,
uncertain and uupiiciiotis.
Small at ilotoi.
Governor Small remained at his
hotel again this morning to look
alter state business.
The hearing was delayed for an
hour while Judge Claire C Ed
wards called a chancery docket and
heard three young women who are
seeking divorces.
Mr. Leforgee said the indictment,
as drawn, places the state of Illi
nois in the position of participat
ing in an alleged unlawful trans
action. The state claims, be said, that
Fred Sterling and Len Small, as
treasurers of Illinois, turned over
$10,000,000 of state funds to an al
leged fictitious and non-existant
bank the Grant, Park bank of
which Vernon Curtis and the late
Edward Curtis were supposed to be
officers.
Stale Guilty, Tool
The indictment then charges, lie
said, that the Curtis brothers loan
ed the money to various indivld
uals and corporations, collecting
interest, a part of which they are
charged with pocketing, while the
remainder, approximately 2 per
cent, was turned over to the state.
If the first part of the indictment
is true and the loan of the money
to the Grant Park bank was illegal,
Mr. Leforgee argued, then the in
dictments charge that the state par
ticipated in the fruits of an illegal
conspiracy.
The defense then took up the em
bezzlement indictments in which
Governor Small is personally ac
cused of embezzling $500,000 and
the governor, Mr. Curtis and Lieutenant-Governor
Fred E. Sterling,
jiontly with taking $700,000.
Host Show Illegality.
The statutes expressly provide
the only manner in which money
can be legally removed from the
state treasury, the governor's coun
sel said, and there is nothing in the
indictment to show that it is charg
ed the money alleged to have been
embezzled was illegally removed.
If the counts of the indictments
alleging the defendants obtained
money under false pretenses are to
stand, he added, it would be nec
essary for them to show the money
was removed from the treasury in
an illegal manner.
Governor and Mrs. Small arrived
at the courthouse at 11:30 o'clock,
the governor taking a seat at his
attorneys' table.
The defense expects to complete
its arguments late today or tomor
row morning.
The state will then ask for an
adjournment until later in the
month to give time to prepare an
answer.
The governor complained of in
digestion during the noon recess
and did not return for the after
noon session.

London, Dec. 7j (By the Asso

to London from Sandringham today
to preside at a meeting of the privy
council and sign a proclamation
calling for a special meeting of
parliament for Wednesday next to
consider the agreement reached
yesterday between Great Britain
and Ireland for ths establishment
of the Irish Free Stat.
Sessioas Will be Brief.
Should the agreement be approv
ed, of which little doubt is enter
tained, the session will last only a
few days, and the parliament will
adjourn until the regular session
in February, when a bill embody
ing the agreement will be dealt
with.
The king is expected to open the
special session in person, in which
case the ceremony will assume tha
dignity and magnificence of a reg
ular opening of parliament. The
king's speech will deal entirely
with the Irish question, and the
debate, which ordinarily on such
an occasion touches on every sub
ject with which the parliament has
to do, will likewise be limited t
Irish affairs.
