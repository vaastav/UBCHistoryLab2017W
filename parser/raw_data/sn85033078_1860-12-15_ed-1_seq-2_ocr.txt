with no such discretion, and he possess

a mere Executive officer with the pow

to submit to Congress the whole qucs-|

The course oi events is so rapidly;
hastening lor ward that the emergency
may arrive when you may be called I
upon to deed 1c the momentous question
whether you possess the power, by
force of arms, to compel a State to rc
inain in the Union. I should feel my-:
xdi recreant to mv duty were T not to;
express myself on thy important sub-’
ject. The question fairly stated is:
lias the Constitution delegated to Con
gress the powei to force a State into 1
submission which h attempting to \v ith
draw, or has actually withdrawn from |
the* Con fed era y? If answered in the
affirmative, it must be on the principle I
that the power has been conferred up- j
on Congress to declare and make war i

tive oi the force of the whole against a
lehnqucrt State ■ unc up for consider
ation. Mr. Madison opposed it in a
brief, but powerinl speech, from which
1 shall cxtiact but a single sentence. —
Ife obsen cd : Jbe use oi force against
a single State wmkl look more like a
declaration of war than an infliction of
punishment, and would probably be
considered by li e parties attacked as
;i dissolution of all previous compacts
by which it might be bound.”
I pon Ins motion the clause was unan
imously postponed, and was never, I
believe, again presented.
Soon all or, on the Bth of June, 1787,
vvV.cn ir.ci ting to this sub
ject, lit; said : “•Any Government for
Lie 1 mica States, formed on the sup
pose.l practicability of using force
against unconstitutional nrocee.di ugs
oi any ol the States, would prove as vis
ional y and lalhudoua as lire Covern
ii-'eni ol Congee .- s, evidently Jiioaniiic
the then existing Congress of the old
Confederation. \ \ itiiout descending
to particulars, it may be safely assert
ed that the power to make war against
a Slate is at variance with the whole
spirit and intent, oi ihe Constitution,
Suppose such a war should result in
the conquest o; a Slate, how arc wo to
govern it afterwards? Shall wo hold
ri as a province and govern it bv des
potic power? In the nature of things
wc could not by physical force control
the will ot the people, and compel them
to eh ct Senators and Representatives
I'> ' ■ id mu all the
in lie; depending upon their own obli
gation, and required from the free oil
mens oi a live St-d.o as a constitutional
member of the Confederacy.
’•hb if wo pos;.; w lb.- power, would
it bo wise to exert iso it under existitw
circumstances ? Phc object would be
doubtless to preserve the I mon, which
would not mtly pr* vest the most effect
ual menus of defraying it. but would
ban . bio recon
struction. oosi.les, in the fraternal
conflict, a vast amount of blood and
treasure would be expended, rendering
future reconciliation between the States
impossible. In the meantime, who can
foretell wind would ’no the sufferings
and privations ot Use people during its
existence. The fact is that this Union
rests upon public -'pinion, ami can nev
er be cemented by the blood of its cit
izens shed in civil war. If it cannot
live in the affections ot the people, it
mimt one day perish. Congress pos
sesses many means ot preserving bv
conciliation : but tlio word was not
placed in their hands to preserve it bv
force.
Bat may I be permitted solemnly to
invoke my countrymen to pause, and
deliberate before they determine to de
stroy tills, the grandest temple which
has ever been dedicated to human free
dom since the world begum. It has
been consecrated by the blood of our
Fathers, by the glories of the past, and
by the hopes of the future; and the
Union has already made ns the most
prosperous, and ere long will, if pre
served, render us the most powerful
nation on the face of the earth.
In every foreign region of the globe
the title of American citizen is held in
the highest respect, and when pro
nounced in foreign lands it causes tlio
hearts of our countrymen to swell with
honest pride. Surely, when we reach
the brink of the yawning abyss, wc
shall recoil with horror from the last
mtal plunge. By such a dread catas
trophe the hopes of the friends of free
dom throughout the world would be
destroyed, and a long night of leaden
despotism would enshroud the nation.
Our example for more than eighty years
would not only be lost, but it would be
quoted as a conclusive proof that man
is unfit for self government. It is not
every wrong, nay, it is not every griev
ous wrong, which can justify a resort
to such an alternative. This ought to
bo the last desperate remedy of a des
pairing people, of every other constitu
tional moans of conciliation had been
exhausted.
Vv o should reflect that under this
free government there is an incessant
ebb and flow of public opinion. The
slavery question, like everything hu
man, will have its day. I firmly be
lieve that it has already reached and
passed the culminating point: but if,
iu lac midst oi the existing excitement,
the Union shall perish, the evil may
tnen become irreparable. Congress
can contribute much to arrest it, by rc
; osing and recommending to the Leg
islatures of the several States the rem
edy for existing evils which the Con
stitution has itself provided for its own
preservation. This has been tried at
different critical periods of our history,
and always with eminent success. It
is to be found iu the sth article, provi
ding for its own amendment. Under
tills article amendments have been pro
poso<i by two thirds of both Houses of
Congress, and have been ratified by
the Legislatures of three-fourths of the
several States, and have consequently
become parts of the Constitution.
To tliis process the country is indebt
ed. for the clause prohibiting Congress
from passing any law rcspectirm an es
taodi.-hmeiii, of i. dig’,on, or abridging
' no ireeyoni oi speech or of the press,
or the right of petition. To this we
arc also indebted for the bill of rights
which secured the people against any
abuse of power by the" Federal Gov
ernment. Such were the apprehensions
justly entertained by the friends of
State rights at that period, us to have
rendered it extremely doubtful wheth
er the Constitution could have long sur
vived without these amendments.
Again the Constitution was amended
by the same process after the election
of President Jefferson, by the House
of Bcprcsentatives, in February, 1803.
This amendment was rendered neces
sary to prevent a recurrence of the dan
gers which had to seriously threatened
| existence of the Government dur
ing the pendency oiTiiat election. The
ariicdo for its own amendment was in
tended to procure the amicable ad just
ment of the Constitutional questions,
like the present, which might arise be
j tween the governments of the States
I and of the United States. Tins appears
| from contemporaneous history.
Iu this connection, I shall merely call
1 attention to a few instances in Mr. Mad-
ison-s justly celebrated report, in 1779,
to tii© Legislature of A irginia. In this
he ably and conclusively defended the
resolutions of the preceding Legisla
ture of Virginia against the strictures
oi several other Stats Legislatures.
These were mainly founded upon the
protest o i tii o \ irginia Legislature
ngamst the alien and sedition acts as
palpable and alarming infractions of I
-he Constitution. la pointing out ifio j
peaceful and constitutional remedies
-and ho referred to none other-—to
v tile n tne rotates were authorized tore
soi ton such occasions, he concludes
by saying that the Legislatures of the
States might have made a direct rep
resentation to Congress with a view to
obtain a rescinding of the two offensive
acts, or they might have represented i
to their respective Senators iu Congress I
their wish that two-thirds thereof would j
propose any explanatory amendment i
t o the ,Constitution ; or two-thirds of
themselves, it such, had been their opin-!
ion, might by an application to Con
gress lmvo obtained a convention for
the very same object.
This is the very course which I earn
estly recommended, in order to obtain
an explanatory amendment of the Con
stitution on tlio subject of slavery,
This might originate with Congress or
Uo Stale Legislatures as may be deem
ed most advisable to attain the object.
1 no explanatory amendment might be
confined to the final settlement'of the
constructions of the Constitution on
these special points: First, mi express
recognition of the right of property in
slaves i:i the States where it now exists,
or may hereafter exist.
Second, me duty of protecting this
right in .all the common territories thro’-
out their territorial existence, and until
they shall be admitted as, States into
the L nion, with or without slavery, ns
their Constitution may prescribe. Third
a like recognition of the right of the
master to his slave, who lias escaped
from one State to another, to be restor
ed and delivered up to him ; and the
validity of the Fugitive Slave Law, en
acted for this purpose, together with a
declaration of all State laws impairing
or decreasing this right are violations
of the Constitution, and consequently
null and void.
It may be objected, that this con
struction of the Constitution has al
ready been settled by the Supreme
Court of the I idled States, and what
more ought to be required? The an
swei is that a very large proportion of
the people of the United States still
doubt the correctness of this decision,
and never will cease from agitation !
and admit its binding force until clear
ly established by the people of the sev
eral States in their sovereign character.
Such an explanatory amendment
would, it is believed, forever terminate
the existing dissensions, and restore
peace and harmony among the States, i
It ought not to be doubted that such i
an appeal to the arbitrament establish- j
cd by the Constitution itself, would be
received with favor by all the States of
the Confederacy. In any event it
ought to bo tried in a spirit of concili
ation before any of these States, shall
separate themselves from the Union. <

Tbo President’s Message.
We devote considerable space of this
issue to that portion of tbo Message
which relates to the affairs in tbo South
because the public have been very cu
rious to see the position of the Presi
dent on secession.
Buchanan deplores the present state
of affairs—unjustly attributes the pre
cipitate action of South Carolina to the
non-compliance of some northern States
to the execution of the Fugitive Slave
Law and to having personal liberty bills
on their statute books, —says secession
is synonymous with revolution and trea
son—can’t conceive how he is to pre
vent or punish? the secessionists, be
cause the District Judge, District At
torney and Marshal of South Carolina
have all resigned, and therefore pro
cess cannot be issued and served. A
Jackson could issue a proclamation
that the Carolinians were traitors and
‘would be suspended on every tree in
the State unless they desisted in their
revolutionary movements, within a pre
scribed time. Bat old Back is too im
becile, cowardly and nerveless, to take
any decisive stand. He is like Jehu
Lewis, our State Marshal, who replied,
when asked what ho was going to do
about Booth's escape, “I bed and if
J know!"’ Old Buck don’t know what
Lo do.
The President then discusses oiti 1
foreign relations. lie reiterates his
recommendation for the acquisition of
Cuba by a fair purchase. He recom
mends to Congress the passage of a
law T appointing a certain day previous
to the 4th of March of each year of an
odd number, for the election of Rep
sent a lives throughout all the States, for
the reason that some of the States have
no Representatives in Congres between
the 4th of March and the following fall.
Should an extra session bo called at
such times, fifteen States would be dis
franchised, Tie proposes a change in
the tariff law, from ad valorem duties
;to specific duties. Ho recommends a
Pacific R, R. Congratulates the count
ry upon the apparent diminution of
the slave trade and the extinction of
the fillibustering sentiment, and in view
of the destitution in Kansas recom
mends to Congress that if any constitu
tional measure of relief can be devis
ed, that the subject should be duly
considered.
The extreme length of the message
forbids its publication in full in our pa
per. It is the last one which Mr. Bn
: chanan will indict on the country, and
the people are gratified for that fact.
A Righteous Verdict. —The Burch
Divorce Case has drawn to a close. —
The jury retired at 3 o’clock on the af
ternoon of the 10th, and in one hour
and a half returned with a verdict in
favor of Mrs. Burch. It was received
with great rejoicings.
Enlarged.— The Madison Arg us
has been enlarged to accommodate its
increasing patronage in the way of ad
vertisements. It is a neat-looking and
! spicy sheet.
Pen and Scissors.
—One of the latest novclities—per
fumed ink.
—The U. S. Supreme Judges are
all against secession.
—-Thriving—those merchants and
mechanics who advertize in the Im
porter.
—The Prince of "Wales completed
his nineteenth year on the ninth of
November.
—One of me attractions at a late
agricultural fair in California was a
camel race,
the official vote of Missouri shows
that Douglas has really carried that
State by 429 majority.
—The official vote of Missouri stands
Douglas 58,891 ; Bell 58,372 ; Breck
inridge 31,371 ; Lincoln, 17,026.
—The depot buildings of the Illinois
Central R. R. at Duulcitb, were de
stroyed by fire on Monday night. •
—Hon. D. D. Littlejohn has prosecu
ted Mr. Greeley, of the Tribune for
libel utt 1 red during the last canvass.
—Senator Clay, of Alabama, lias
tendered his resignation to Gov, Moore,
to take effect the 4th of March next.
—Kewaunee county, which but three
or four years ago was a dense wilder
ness, has now a population of 5,530.
—The city of New York alone con
tains as many white inhabitants as the
States of Georgia and South Carolina.
• —Mrs. Betsey Hartwell, of West
minster, Mass., a lady over 80 years
old, has seated over 400 chairs within
a year.
—The Great Ersteru Is to remain on
her gridiron all whites’. It will require
anew loan of 100,000 pounds to fit
her out again.
—The Prince of Wales lias arrived
home safely. The manner of his re
ception by Brother Jonathan Isas de
lighted Jonny Bull.
—Two of the Detroit Brewers drank
lager beer on a wager on Saturday
last.— One worried down 84 glasses
and the other 93. They were doubtless
full if not tight.
—The House of Representatives re
fused to excuse Mr. Hawkins, of Florida
from serving on the special committee
on the state of the Union, by a vote of
95 against 101.
—The number of votes polled in
Missouri at the late election was up
wards of 102,000, which is an increase
0f54 per cent since 1854. This fact
attests a wonderful growth in popula
tion.
—Prince Napoleon’s proposed trip
to this count.iy is again talked of in
Paris, and now appears to be fully de
cided upon. As upon the occasion of
his trip to the Arctic Sea, he will be
accompanied by several men of letters,
professors and artists.
—The Louisville Journal pertinently
asks can any statist tell how often
Toombs has seceded or threatened to
leave the Union in disgust. We have
counted on every finger and thumb,
and our recollection still holds to sever
al more of his crises, but we would like
to be numerically corrected. Who
has time to make the calculation. It
would afford pleasant recreation for
some gentleman of leisure with a math
ematical turn of mind.
Resignation of Secretary Cobb.
—Mr. Cobb, Secretary of the Treasu
ry, having brought his department into
bankruptcy, and being, besides, a dis
unionist at heart, resigned yesterday,
as he might profitably, to himself and
country, have done long since. If it be
true that James Guthrie, of Kentucky,
is to be his successor, we shall rejoice
in the change. Mr. Guthrie is honest,
competent, faithful to the Constitution,
and loyal to the Union.
Kew Pater. —We have received
the first number of the Marquette Eagle
published at Oxford, by Wm. 11. Farn
ham, Esq., and edited by Wm. 11.
Earn ham &L. B. Xoyes. It is Re
publican in politics, and presents a
beautiful typographical appearance.
Either the new paper or the Express
will “go up” within a year. Oxford,
no more than Grand Rapids, cannot
support two papers.
T>- I
The Vote of the Country.—Ac
cording to the latest returns received,
the whole number of votes cast is
4,000,000 ; of which Abraham Lincoln
received 1,800,000; Stephen A. Doug
las, 1,300,000; John C. Breckenridge,
800,000; and John Bell, 000,000.
Newspapers in the Family.
A child beginning to read becomes
I delighted with newspapers, because he
j roads of names and things which are
[ very familiar, and will make progress
I accordingly. A newspaper in. the
family one year, is worth a half a
year s schooling to the children, and
every father must consider that sub
stantial information is connected with
this advancement. The mother of a
family, should herself be instructed. A
• mind occupied becomes fortified against
the ills of life, and is braced for its
emergencies. ( hildron amused by
reading or study, are of course con
j siderate and more easily governed.
How many thoughtless voting men have
I spent their earnings in a grog-shop
who ought to have been reading. How
many parents who have never spent
twenty dollars for books or papers for
their families, would gladly have given
thousands to reclaim a son or daughter
who had ignorantly and thoughtlessly
i fallen into temptation.
The New York Century, one of the
ablest journals in the country, in an
article on the influence of newspapers
in the family, savs :
“It is possible that wo overrate the
influence of tin? newspaper as an edu
cator, but wc think not. It is the
voice of the living world. It is histo
ry, art, philosophy, science, truth, jus
tice, retoric, grammar, and everything
| else—not unmixed with falseood and
nonsense, but not more so mixed than
the home infant schools for girif?, from
which the boys break awnv before their
bones are out of the gristle* Take Gram
mar, Natural History, Rhetoric, and
Composition. Where are those so well
taught ns in the carefully edited news
paper? What better lesson in Rhetoric
than to see some popular writer or fa
mous scholar roasted alive on the hot
coals of criticism? Whore arc better
examples of tasteful composition ?
A hero Is a bettor cabinet of natural
history? What in all the world es
capes the newspaper editor? And if
lie commits blunders in grammar or
logic, or fact, or philosophy, is he not
forthwith served up on a gridiron bv
another editor'? Where, "but in the
newspaper, will bo found a running
history of all the literature of the day ?
Whore else are you told what books
you may safely buy, what arc not
worth putting on your shelves, and
what would boas hurtful to the mind
of your coildren as henbane to their
bodies ?

Ax Indignant Wife’s Retaliation
upon a Fkee-Love Husband.—The
Cleveland (Ohio), Plaindealer relates
this story in its usual elegant style:
An influential man, who resides near
Cuyahoga Falls, has been absent from
home a good deal the past year. He
told Ins wife that he went off to buy
cattle. Ho never brought any cattle
homo with him, and his wife wondered
“what under the sun” he did with them.
It perhaps lias never occurred to some
people, but women know a few tilings.
And this particular woman, in course
of time, snuffed a large mice. She pos
itively ascertained,"indeed, that her
husband was mingling with loose crin
oline in several adjacent places, and
that “buying cattle” was a false and
wicked pretext. She was indignant,
but she did not arise and howl. On
returning from cattle buying ( u m mv
mind’s eye, Horatio,”) tour- not lontr
since, tne man was rather surprised not
to find his wif'j ?A homo, and was some
what more surprised to learn that she
had been absent for three days, and
was a good deal more surprised to learn
that site had gone off with a man with
black whiskers. Ho started in pursuit.
Ho scoured Lite country round. At last
he met her. She was in a buggy with
Mr. W hiskers. They were returning
home. “Where in*—— have you beeig
Maria?” shouted the husband, boiling
with indignation. “ Oh, Tve been off
buying cattle!” she sweetly replied,
while Mr. "Whiskers lashed the horse
into a furious pace, and they dashed
away. There was a reconciliation, but
wc do not know how it was bro’t about,
but of the truth of the principal features
of this item there is no doubt. The
man don’t go off buying cattle nowa
days. In Bowery classic, “he was
quiet.”
Best Time for Painting Houses. -
According to the Scientific Artizan ,
the best time for painting the exterior
of buildings Ac, is late in autumn or
during winter. Paint then applied will
endure twice as long as when applied
in early summer, or in hot weather;
In the former it drys slowly and be
comes hard, like a glazed surface, not
easily affected afterwards by the weath
er, or worn off by the beating of storms.
But in very hot weather the oil in the
paint soaks into the wood at once, as
into a sponge, leaving the load nearly
dry, and nearly ready to crumble off. ;
This last difficulty, however, we should j
think, might in a measure be guarded I
against, through an increased expense, :
by first going over the surface with ,
raw oil. By painting in cold weather, (
one annoyance might certainly bo es
caped, namely, the collection of small
flies on the fresh paint—a thing very
common in this region in summer.

Lakes four propellers and some thirty
