WATTERSON'S PLATFORM.
SINCE Colonel Watterson decided to cease being
Warwick and concluded to be King; since he
looked upon the Governors he has made and
called them bad and decided to be Governor himself,
he has gone into retreat, far from the sound of the
distiller}- whistle when it gives shrill notice that the
worm is in order, and remote even from the tele
phone bell, which heeds no hours and has no set time
or season.
In this seclusion our interesting Mahatma is think
ing out a Democratic party, conducting it to glorious
victory and handing dov.'n party, victory and all the
offices and muniments of power to the Svvamis that
watch by night on the political plains below his
perch. He has selected the constitution of the United
States as the new platform of his triumphant Democ
racy. He has recently looked that document over,
and after the most careful inspection and trial of
every section as carefully as a wheel-tapper tries the
underpinning of a train decides that it is good leather
and any party that takes it for a platform will go
under the wire while the other is foaming down the
backstretch.
The colonel seems to think that there can be no
dispute about the constitution, and that the party
which adopts it entire will have the other on the hip.
If he will some day revisit his birthplace, Washington
City, and go to the law section of the Congressional
library, he will find a bewildering array of books con
taining the cases decided by the Supreme Court to
settle disputes over the meaning of the constitution.
He will discover that different constructions of his
proposed platform have generated legal controver
sies over Federal and State rights, over person and
property, and cover the whole range of the science
of law, from admiralty to eminent domain, from the
dominion of the sea to dominion of the land. He
will find that," from the beginning, members of the
same party have differed about the meaning of the
constitution, and members of different parties have
agreed with each other/ * .
After he has looked over the index of all these
volumes and read several syllabi he will conclude
that all differences of construction have been recon
ciled by the court, and will cry, "Go to! What if
my countrymen have been dull of apprehension and
have differed about this, the court has made it all
clear, and damned be he who cavils further!" But
if he will go to the Capitol he will find sitting in the
old Senate chamber, in a dim, religious light, nine
gentlamen arrayed in black silk gowns, cut full in the
skirt. He stands before the Supreme Court of the
United States in its working dress. Before it is a
docket, so long that it is never cleared and finished,
filled with cases arising in differences of opinion and
construction of that si me constitution. He will see
;.' the bar of that court the legal talent of the coun
try, arrayed, giant against giant, in a mighty conten
tion about what his platform means. Then he will
go back to his Himalaya and say, "Boys, let's fall
back on the familiar, home-made article. Let us con
tinue to view with aversion and alarm the policy of
the other party and point with pride to our promise
to pay, if we win 1 .".
And .that is what it will come to. With that un
quenchable enthusiasm of youth, which time cannot
touch. Colonel W2tterson cries out now: "The Dem
ocratic party is nothing if it be not the party of the
constitution. In that character, adequately equipped
and skillfully marshaled, nothing can resist it. In
Kentucky all is well. ; How is it elsewhere? Watch
man, tell us of the night!"
Well, Henry, outside Kentucky the boys continue
to water it a little.
When the British get tired of chasing the Boers
they sit down and try to think out how the Boers
manage to keep on hand so many fresh horses and
such a supply of ammunition. In the end, however,
they have to give up the problem. They find it about
as tiring as any other feature of the war.
General Buller shows about as much strategy in
bluffing the British War Office as he did in trying
to storm the Boer intrehchments, and he may yet
have an experience as sad as that which befell' him
on the romantic banks of Tugela River.
RECIPROCITY WITH CUBA,
DISPATCHES from Washington announce
that strong efforts are being made to procure
from Congress an act granting many of the
products of Cuba free access to the markets of- the
United States. The movement is supported par
tially by arguments of an economic nature, , but
mainly by appeals to sentiment. It is urged that
since we have done so much for Cuba we should do
something more; that having given her people free
dom we should now make a sacrifice of ourselves" in
order to make them rich.
It has. long been known in the world that business
and sentiment do not mix well. The combination is
always hurtful to some extent, and not infrequently
it is disastrous to both sentiment and business. The
peculiar' plea made for Cuba is therefore in its very
nature open to objection and subject to suspicion.
It may .be fairly asked if the proposed freedom of
trade with Cuba will be beneficial to American in
dustries why talk about the alleged "moral obliga
tion" to grant it? If it will not be beneficial to our
interests why not confine the plea strictly to appeals
to sentiment and leave business out of the question
altogether?
The business argument is invalid. Reciprocity with
Cuba would expose to the competition of the cheap
labor of the island many of the largest of our indus
tries, and even if they were not large the objection
would be just as strong, for the protective system
would be unfair and unjust if it did not protect all
home industries without 'respect to their magnitude.
The study of the reciprocity treaties negotiated by
Commissioner Kasson has given the American peo
ple a wider understanding of the policy of reciprocity
than they had before, and the difficulties of applying
the system in practice are now generally recognized.
The consequence has been the development of a pub
lic sentiment in opposition to the scheme as a whole.
Reciprocity with Cuba as a business proposition
would not be essentially different from reciprocity
with any other nation. It will have to be studied
with respect to its effect on American industries, and
when so studied is found to be objectionable from
every point of view.
The sentimental plea is well nigh as weak as the
business argument. It is a familiar experience that if
you help a man once you will have to help him again.
The more you help him the more he relies upon you,
and by and by you will either have to support him
altogether or quit helping him at all. We have helped
Cuba, and because we have done so it is now argued
we must continue to help her. It is therefore perti
nent to ask how far the help is to go and how long
it is to continue. To what extent are the Cubans to
have a moral right to ask our assistance in promot
ing their business because we gave them assistance in,
establishing their independence? Are the Cubans to
become, like the Indians, "perpetual wards of the na
tion," with an increasing expectation of favors to
come year after year?
If it be insisted that we are bound to help the
Cubans get rich, then the question arises how that
help shall be given. To expose a few of our indus
tries to unrestricted Cuban competition while leav
ing ether industries fully protected would be to throw
the whole burden of helping Cuba upon the exposed
industries alone. That would not be fair. If we are
morally bound to help Cuba the obligation rests upon
the whole people and not upon a few industries. The
help, therefore, should be given in the form of a sub
sidy and not in the fcrm of free trade for her prin
cipal products.
The people of the United States have freed the Cu
bans, and now the Cubans should be left to work out
their own salvation. The plea made in their behalf
is invalid, whether made a^ a business proposition or
as a sentimental appeal. Whatever duty we owe to
Cuba, our first duty is to our own people, and one of
the cardinal features of the home duty is that of pro
tecting the industries upon which our wo-rkingmen
depend fcr a livelihood. As the President himself
has said, "that is the prime consideration of our
entire economic legislation."
Colonel Bryan repeats that he does not agree with
President Roosevelt on matters of politics, but he
commends his disapproval of dock-tailed horses; so
it will be seen the Colonel is getting slowly round to
a friendly and appreciative frame of mind. By and
by he may approve of other things.
GERMAN DEPRESSION.
LET him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest
he fall applies to the pride of nations and of
men alike.
Up to eighteen monfhs ago Germany was enjoying
the greatest period of prosperity she has known in
all her history. Profit was High, her staples found
a ready market, her labor was employed, its wages
were greater than ever, and speculation, which is an
inseparable attendant upon national prosperity,
lustily rioted on the Berlin boerse. Bankers had to
enlarge their premises to accommodate customers,
and the Paris edition of the New York Herald, in its
Berlin correspondence, says the brokers became so
suddenly affluent that they bought estates for them
selves and set up establishments that rivaled the no
bility.
In the general exuberance this thick buttering of
bread on both sides was attributed to Germany's ap
pearing in "welt politik" — to her springing into the
ring as a world power. She had seated herself with
out let or leave in a Chinese seaport and had blandly
assumed the head of the table in Asia, ready to ask
Russia and England whether they preferred white or
dark meat at the feast of partition of China.
Now it has all faded like the mirage. By the subtle
operation of that law of reaction which nothing
seems able to exclude from human affairs, the tide
stopped, stood still and began to recede, carrying ruin
on its ebb.
Bankers are left loaded with stocks that are shrink
ing to nothing. ' Brokers find themselves with no
money to support the state and circumstance of their
estates. Manufactories are closing down, shipping is
idle, and in Berlin alone nearly 50,000 laborers have
no work and the harsh winter is piercing their rags.
Men marvel at it and seek the cause. One says over
speculation, another over-production, a third "welt
politik." Combined, these all may be the causes of the
cause. That is the giddy sense of danger that comes
to men when they fly tod high. Sometimes satiety
figures among the causes. A group of men feel that
for the present they have enough. They begin to
"cash in," as it were. Immediately another group
sees in this some hidden meaning and take it as a
sign to get from under, and they cash in also. The
\ first group illustrate prudence and moderation, but
their prudence runs into a panic and the wheels stop,
the sails are furled, and all credit, legitimate' and
speculative, comes to liquidation. In that day of
judgment Asiatic seaports and far islands buffer noth
ing. The pains and penalties of.ovef-conndence must
be suffered, and men must wait until the law, of re
action restores confidence, picks trade out of the

A VANISHED BUGABOO.
DURING the whole of the past summer and
fall a fear of a possible reopening of this
country, to unrestricted Chinese immigration
has been upon a considerable portion of the people.
The Chinese Minister had the floor, as it were. He
began with a Fourth of July speech at Philadelphia,
diplomatically preparing the way for a sentiment in
opposition to exclusion. Thereafter he went on at
different times to speak more boldly and to suggest
special reasons. why Chinese immigration would be
beneficial to the East and to the South. His utter
ances were taken up by influential papers in the East,
and, while they were hot directly commended, they
were neither refuted nor condemned. Consequently
there was good reason on the surface of things -to
fear that the fight for exclusion would be difficult
and the victory by no means certain.
The poll of Congress by The Call correspondent
at Washington shows that after all there was more
talk than danger in the diplomacy of the astute Chi
nese Minister. Public sentiment all over the coun
try has been too firmly formed to be shaken by his
specious arguments concerning the advantages ' of
Chinese labor to the South or Chinese trade to the
East. The arguments of the Minister were taken in
the East as good subjects for midsummer discussion,
and a special interest was given to them by the fact
that they came from a Chinaman capable of making
not only witty after-dinner, speeches at American ban
quets but a first-class Fourth of July oration. The
effect of them, however, v/as virtually nothing. The
people remained steadfast in the resolve that Ameri
can workingmen shall not be exposed in their own
homes to the competition of Chinese, and that re
solve is well understood by Congressmen of all par
ties.
The firm declaration in the President's message in
favor of the immediate re-enactment of the exclusion
law so amended as to make it entirely effective, taken
together with the declarations of members of Con
gress, puts an end to all fears that may have been
felt upon the subject. It is now clear the American
people have had ample experience with race
problems and are not going to expose themselves de
liberately to the coming of another. A Chinese ex
clusion bill will be passed and it will be so drawn as
to provide for exclusion as the permanent policy of
the country.
Such being the situation there is no need to send a
delegation to' Washington, no need to raise money^.to
defray its expenses. The fight for exclusion has been
won and the, issue is settled. We shall have a better
law on the subject. than ever before, and the only
thing required of the people in future will be to see
that it is strictly and honestly enforced.
The French Government is talking abput putting
a tax upon pianos, and it is. scarcely necessary to say
there is music in the air that sounds dangerous to
the Ministry.
EUROPEAN IDEAS OF US.
THE United States is bound by treaty to keep
the Panama railway open to commerce.
Colombia, like all the isthmian and South
American countries, lias the revolutionary habit as a
chronic ailment. There seems to be no remedy for it
but phlebotomy, but bleeding rarely accompanies
revolution down there. The casualties in one . of
those frequent outbursts are hardly equal to the car^
nage of a football game between the students of two
American universities. A revolution among those
people is simply the means of changing an adminis
tration. In Salvador, for example, there has not been
a Presidential election for twenty-six years, though
the constitution of that country requires that such
election be had every four years. An administration
stays in power and stands at the point where the pub
lic revenues are lost by "friction" between the collec
tion and the public treasury, and when some ambi
tious, impecunious patriot concludes that the ins have
fattened enough on friction he strikes an attitude,
raises his voice for purity of government, gets^a few
musketeers together and chases out the incumbent
and proceeds to place himselfj at the friction point
and prospers until his turn comes. The United States
has no desire to interfere with this rotation in the en
joyment of friction, but only to protect the interests
of civilization. For this purpose it placed jackies to
guard the Panama' railway and forbade the bombard
ing of Colon, which .would have destroyed the terj
minus of that road. Thereupon European journals
saw our intention to permanently occupy the isthmus,
and indulged in serious reflections upon our imperial
purposes, and upon the Monroe doctrine in general.
We have no wish to occupy the isthmus. We are
Dy treaty the trustee of the right of the civilized world
to commercial transit of the isthmus, and' we have
asserted our responsibility in the only possible way.
When- the nickel revolution is over and the new or
old beneficiary of friction has his pocket under the
hopper, and is able incidentally to keep the isthmus
open, we will withdraw and go about- our business
elsewhere. •■..■"■
Perhaps we cannot too much wonder at the mis
construction put upon our action by European jour
nals. After all, they are only paying us back in our
own coin. When England sent a warship into Co
rinto to capture the custom-house and collect,rev
enue to pay a British subject who had been flogged
on K his bare back by the temporary tyrant of that
country Senator Morgan, then chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, to vent his spite on Cleve
land's administration, said in an interview that ; our
supineness had admitted England into Nicaragua and
she was there to stay, and henceforth that country
was to become a dependency of the British crown.
v'. Of course this was rot, for Great Britain was only
doing that which we might with frequent profit imi
tate. She was teaching one of these little irrespon
sible.'tyrannies to keep, its; hands off her people, and
if the lesson had involved blowing up the Corinto
cuartel it would not have been too severe.
