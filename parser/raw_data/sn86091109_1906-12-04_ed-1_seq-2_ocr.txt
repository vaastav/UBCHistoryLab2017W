THE PRESI DENT'S MESSAGE.
The president's annual message Is
now officially before the people—hav
ing been read in congress today and
released for publication by the Asso
ciated Press. It will be read with In
tense interest because of the great im
portance of the many questions it
touches upon. As a whole the message
is direct and forcible, the treatment
of the seevral toffies bearing the im
press of the president's characteristic
.views so well known to the public
through other agencies that there is
nothing startling in the presentation.
It is an earnest, urgent request for
action along lines already blocked out
in previous messages, Unes along
which the administration has been
trending throughout its term.
The president loses no time in pre
senting argumenta In favor of furth
ering the policy of government control
for the big corporations. He believes
thoroughly in efficiency of the "big
stick" and asks congress to help make
its application more powerful. In
asking for the passage of a bill giving
the government the right to appeal in
criminal cases tbe president Is very
frank to say that the need of such a
law has been made manifest in the
trial of the trust and interstate com
merce case criminal proceedings have
been properly begun and conspicuous
failures noted because of lack of this
power.
Tbe laws already passed with the
Idea of securing proper supervision
and control are cited and their bene
ficial results noted with a recommend
ation that in specific Instances that
congress. enlarge the powere of the
interstate commerce commission. In
this regard It will be noted that the
president has taken no backward step,
hut has a progressive view that, "One
of the most efficient methods of avert,
lng the consequences of dangerous
agitation, which is 80 per cent wrong,
is to remedy the SO per cent of evil
founded." To secure, by proper legis
lation and executive action, an aboli
tion of the grave abuses which do ob
tain in connection with the business
use of wealth is the sum and sub
stance of the Roosevelt doctrine. The
message is particularly strong along
this line. t
•
In pursuing the course dictated by
his convictions President Roosevelt is
no respector of persons, as his action
in the dismissal of the negro com
panies follow as it has been by an or
der calling for an investigation of
the alleged remarks of Colonel William
L. Pitcher, who is .accused of having
cast slurs upon the negro soldiers.
Colonel Pitcher was in command at
Fort Sheridan, near Chicago, and is
reputed to have said that the employ
ment of negroes was a disgrace -to the
service. Tf it should prove true the
officer will probably receive the same
sentence for his guilt as did the of
leiiding companies.
A Chicago man is out with a finan
cial scheme to -take over the entire
postal system from the government
contending that under private owner
ship it could be made to pay. Here
is food for thought for those who are
contending that government owner
ship la due under a process of natural
evolution.
There is an excess of nearly $15,
000,000 in the receipts from Internal
revenue In the fiscal year Just ended.
The government still continues on the
highway of national prosperity.
THINK it over.
The car shortage seems to have put
a crimp in everything except'the alae
of the fuel bills.

Boise, Dec. 3—The decision of the
supreme court In the case of Moyer,

with great satisfaction by the state

prosecution. Beyond expressing his
gratification because of the uphold
ing of the state's contentions by the
court of last resort, Governor Good
ing declined to talk of the case. At
torney J. F. Nugent, resident counsel
for the accused men, said that he
was unprepared at this time to make
any statement on the case. Just what
would be done by the defense he did
not know and could not until he had
consulted with his associates, both
of whom were out of the city. While
Mr. Nugent said he expected that the
defense would move for a rehearing
of tha ewe, that being the usual pro
ceeding In cases of such great Im
portance. he declared he could give
definite information on the sub
ject.
James H. Hawley, chief counsel for j
the prosecution, declared the decis on j
v as no surprise as he had anticipated
It and expressed his satis, action at U,
the action of the court. Mr. Hawley
raid the way was now clear to bring
• he accused to trial and while he was
not In a position to say just what
move the defense would make he said
he did not expect any further delay
in the trial. The state, he said, was
ready and he stated that It was more
than probable that the trial would
be started early in January.

London, Dec. 4—The Daily Mail
publishes an editorial this morning
on tha difficulties of the United
States with Japan over the school
question in San Francisco. The pape
er 1» of the opinion that In spite of
the gravity of the situation, owing
to the fact that President Roosevelt
has no power to coerce California, it
is foolish to suggest that Japan
would enforce her rights at the can
non's mouth. Japan certainly has
no Intention of picking a quarrel with
the United Sates, the paper says
Amèrtca, has been her firm fr|end
in the past, her rulers will he able to
make large allowances for the diffi
culties of America and as President
Roosevelt is certain to meet Japan's
request in a fair and friendly spirit,
the Incident will pass and be for
ivotten.
''Yet, sooner or later," the Dailf
Mail concludes, "the west will have
to reckon wth the fact of Asiatic
claims to perfect equality with the
westerner."

junction.''

FEW LAWS IN
SHORT SESSION
Washington. Dec. 3—Senators and
members of the house began to arrive
early in the day and there were many
cordial • greetings in tbe oorrtdorr. and
on the floor. The experiencea of the
late campaign were a fruitful source
of remark, but although many of the
meetings were between republicans ana
democrats, there was no evidence of
any but the best of feeling. The new
comers generally expressed the opin
ion that the short session would wit
ness little legislation beyond the pas
sage of appropriation bills.
"But if anyone thinks that we will
not find something to talk about, he
has another guess," said one of them,
and there was general acquiescence.
The question of spelling will un
doubtedly receive attention at the
hands of congress this week. The sub
committee of the house committee on
appropriations, which provided the
executive and judicial appropriation
congressional record will contain both
styles of spelling. Representative
Charles Landis, chairman of the house
committee on printing, in discussing
the question, said: "The congressional
record will continue to be printed as
heretofore. I mean that the simplified
spelling rules will not apply to the
record. Of course in reprinting the
president's message in the record the
simplified spelling forms thst appear in
the document will be printed, but
otherwise the rdcord will continue to
be the same old fashioned fireside com
panion as of yore."
The Japanese situation was dis
cussed quite generally by the mem
bers, and the opinion was expressed
freely that measures affecting the Jap
anese may be Introduced in tne house
at any time. Representative Kahn, of
California, said he doea not think the
California delegation will take im
mediate steps to push any legislation
affecting the Japanese. He said that
the California delegation will hold a
meeting within two weeks for the
discussion of the situation and doubt
leas will act as a unit la case the de
liston is reached to urge the passage
of any special measure. Two Japanese
exclusion bills, one by Representative
McKinley, of California, and tho other
by Representative Hayes, of Cali
fornia, are now pending in congress.

Famous Act«: at Temple Next Friday
Night.
The announcement of the coming
engagement in this city of John
Griffith on next Friday night at the
Temple carries with it a great deal
of interest to the beet class of thea
tre-goers and this interest Is Intensi
fied by the fact that he will present

Richard the Third."
Mr. Griffith's presentation of it will
have most adequate aid in the very
excellent company he has selected,
and the splendid fireproofed scenic
equipment furnished by his manage
ment. Many novel and thrilling elec
trical effects and chemical illusions
have been added and the performance
in Its entirety will be tbe most im
portant event in the season's theatri
cal history. Mr. Griffith is person
ally a most Interesting character, a
combination of the mental and phy
sical. In appearance he suggests the
peer leas Edwin Forrest and has the
frame and strength of the champion
pugilist, James J. Jeffries, while men
tally he la one of the greatest students
of the day of classic literature, and
is fairly a crank on rhe works of the
divine bard, Shakespeare.
