LET THE QUESTION BE DEIDED.
A year ago, when the Legislature
met. it was found that the House of
Representatives was nearly equally
divided between the two political par
ties, and it was evident there would
be a hot contest between the Kepub
lican3 and Democrats as to which
party should organize the House.
And it was still more evident that a
fierce contest was about to take place
between the parties over the election
of a United States Senator. The fact
that the United States Senate was
equally divided, and that the result of
an election in Tennessee would pro
bably decide which political patty
should control the Senate, intensified
the interest in that election, and at
tracted the attention of the whole
country to' the contest.
Now, our readers will remember
tint there was a contest from Polk
County as to whether Foute, a Re
publican, or Stewart, a Democrat,
was entitled to a seat in the Legis
lature. In a political point of view
all could see how important it was to
the two political parties as to
which of these men should be seated,
and seated t early enough to partici
pate in the organization of the
House of Representatives and the
election of a United States Senator.
It will be remembered that the case
went to the Supreme Court on a
petition for a mandamus, and that
the court came promptly to the front
and advanced it upon the docket,
taking up the case which had been
cut and dried for the purpose, put
ting aside all other suitors, many of
whom had been begging for years to
have their cases tried and their rights
adjudicated. It was taken up with
out delay. The court.decided, not only
to take it up at once and out of its
place? but with the least possible tie
lay decided that Stewart was entitled
to a certificate of election. He got
his seat and voted with his party
in the election for United States
Senator. Now it is not our
object to especially criticise
this action of the Supreme Court,
though we are prepared to say that
there -are a many good lawyers in the
State who were surprised at that de
cision, and who still believe that the
executive authority of the State are
under our Constitution given the ex-'
elusive power of settling who are en
titled to certificates of election, and
upon failure or refusal to settle that
question, that the Legislature alone
has jurisdiction of the question. Nor
have the legal profession ever been
able to reconcile the decision made
by that court in the Foute-Stewart
case, with a prior decision made by
the same court on a similiar question.
Again the Supreme Court is in ses
sion at Nashville. There is upon the
docket a case involving the execution
of the laws passed at the last
session to settle the State debt. No
c ise was ever before a court in this
state where so much that was ma
terial to every citixen of the State,
especially to every tax-payer was at
stake. The .interest on the State
debt as it now stands is about four
teen hundred thousand dollars per
annum, in round numbers. The car
rying into effect of the law passed to
settle the debt, or, in other words,
the taking up and decision of the
case now pending before the Su
preme Court, if decided one way,
will reduce the amount of interest
one half, or about seven hundred
thousand dollars per annum. The
State gets a uew loan, or rather
further time on her debt and gets
the rate of interest reduced from
eix to three per cent.
Nor is this.alL We learn that
there is now about two millions of
dollars collected from the people by
taxation, which wnen levied by the
Legislature, was intended to be ap
plied on the new three per cent
debt, which they had made possible.
This money is scattered throughout
the State in a number of banks
owned by private individuals. "What
sort of security has the State against
the loss of this large sum ? We con
fess we do not know, but hope that
the proper authorities are giving the
matter rigid attention. This money
is not on special deposit. It can,
and no doubt is, being used f or
speculations. Now, if our Supreme
Court fails to take up and decide this
case, then it must wait and take its
place on the docket, which means
that it will be two or three years, if
not longer, before it will be decided.
Moreover, the amount of tax
to be levied and collected next
year is fixed by law, and
fixed on the same basis as now col
lected. This will increase the de
posits, possibly double them, .before
the case can come regularly before
the court.
True,- this will allow a few individ
uals to get very rich, speculating,
handling and manipulating the mil
lions wrung from the people by
taxes and intended to be paid on
their debt, but how much of it is to
be lost ! How many b nks which
are now depositories are to " sus
pend ?" How much fraud, specula
tion and corruption is to grow up
before the settlement of tie
State debt case is decided, no man
can tell. Should a " financial
crash " come in the meantime, or
even a "stringency in the money
market," it needs no prophat to
tell that the loss sustained by the
failure of Butler's Memphis bank a
few years ago, was a mere bagatelle
compared with what may be possi
ble in the future.
Painfully apprehensive, the peo
pie of Tennessee are watching and
waiting to see what action their Su
preme Court will take in this case.
The honor, the credit, the material
interests, the millions on deposit,
all and more are involved in their ac
tion. Let them not say after the
precedent furnished in the Foute-
Stewart case, that this is a political
question only, therefore they will
not advance and decide it. Let
them ia the face of threats to turn
them out by a constitutional con
vention, discharge their duty and
leave the consequences to the people
of Tennessee.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Owing to the lateness of the hour
when the President's Message was
received yesterday morning, we had
no opportunity to comment upon it.
The verdict of the country will be
that it is one of the ablest State
papers that has ever emanated from
the White House. No paper of a
similar character has ever been writ
ten, that was more universally read
than this will be. It is no disparage
ment to say that President Arthur
went into office under such circum
stance?, that a great many good men
looked with deep concern to his
course and policy. His whole bear
ing, from the sad nineeteenth of Sep
tember, we may say the second of July,
when a terrible calamity brought him
prominently before the country, has
been such as to win the confidence
and esteem of the people. His in.
augural address inspired confidence
throughout the land, and the people
were preparedto see in his first mes
sage to Congress a creditable state
paper. But we undertake to say that
he has more than met the expecta
tions of his most sanguine suppor
ters. If his message may be taien
as an index to his administration, the
country will never have reason to say
that the Republicans at Chicago made
a mistake when they nominated him
for the Vice-Presidency.
He . has a clear, frank, vigor
ous way of putting things,
which is most admirable. He. gives
forth no uncertain sound on any
question, but makes himself thor
oughly understood on all and by all.
His clear cut style in stating propo
sitions is something absolutely re"
freshing in a public man. 1 e can
not be misconstrued, as he leaves no
room for doubt as to his" meaning.
jWd while we admire his style, his
soundness on public questions is no
less worthy of approval. On finan
cial questions he dodges nothing,
but places himself fairly and square
ly upon the platform upon
which he was elected The state
ment of his foreign policy leaves
no room to doubt that it will be
bold and at the same time prudent
arid discreet. His expressions in re
gard to Indian affairs show that cn
this vexed and difficult question he
is humane and practical. His . sug
gestions touching the Mormon
question are pointed and practical.
He sweeps away the cob webs be
hind which civil service reform is too
often obscurely discussed and ap
proaches the subject in the light of
common sense. It is an admirable
paper in every respect, and no intel
ligent man of any party, will have
any doubt after reading it, that Pres
ident Arthur is endowed with the
ability to successfully administer the
affairs of the Government.
Gen. Hood blamed Gen. Cheatham
for tke loss of the battle at Franklin,
and Gen. Cheat ham says it was
Hood's fault W happened to be
thereabouts, and our opinion has
been that it was Schofield who caused
these Confederate Generals to loe
the battle. .' ' -
A IEBTOK'S STRANGE DEATH.
Clutching Hi Iteristoad to Keep Persecat
Ing Officers From Taking It.
Wilmington (Del) News.
In a broken voice, Mrs. A. H-Jilc-Glinchey
said that on the 16th inst.,
at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, while
up stairs attending her husband, who
was ill with fever, she was called down
by a strange voice. Upon going
down she found the constable in the
house. He had clambered over the
fence and gotten in through the kitch
en door. He said to her : " I have
got you at last." . He then unlocked
the front door and let in Constables
Hickman and Dillin. Mr. Pritchett
levied on the goods down stairs, even
to the playthings of the child, and as
he was about going up stairs 6he
stopped him with the exclamation :
';For God's sake don't go up there ;
you will kill my husband." The
conversation was carried on in a loud
tone of voice, and every word was
heard by the husband in the room at
the head of the stairs. She detailed
the goods, including the bed upon
which her husband was lying. As
she did this she remarked: "Why,
you wouldn't take that, would you?"
and he gruffly replied : "Yes, I can
take that bed, and if you don't get
the money in two hours I will take
everything from the house."
When she went up stairs after they
had gone, her husband, who had
heard the conversation between her
and the officer, exclaimed, despair
ingly: "Maggie, it is all up now;
they will take everything, and what
will become of you?" He soon after
became delirious, and remained so
until he died. In grief-stricken tones
the poor woman told of his ravings;
how he would clutch the bedstead to
prevent its being taken from under
him.
