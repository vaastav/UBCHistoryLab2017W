This Ih nil KlKlit liigd City
Concluding a reluctant compliment to this
journal yesterday morning thoestecmed Post
of this city unconseiously opened to view the
reason why it loiters lu tho dark of unsucccss
Admitting that Tun PrruiiitcAN is well
mado up tho iV proceeds to say that
doubtless as is given out it has plenty iff
money to hack it a most necessary adjunct
when nn cflort Is mado to print nn eight pago
paper for a four pago constituency
So long as tho Pol considers this a four pago
constituency tho marvel will ho less that it
languishes lu the four pago stage than that it
lives at all To say that n city of 1F0000 pco
pie nil of whom nro newspaper leaders can
not support and docs not for its business and
pleasure require a Jinper metropolitan in slzo
ami form as well as In contents is to at nnco
oifend tho city itself nnd advertiso
tho dullness of tho person or paper
that says so Tho business men of
Washington havo this lack of perception to
thank if they havo failed to draw from tho
territory which is their legitimate field tho
full share of trade Hint of right belongs to
them Tho reading people of tho city havo it
to blame for tho shreds and patches that havo
been laid upon their breakfast tables in lieu
of newspapers
Washington Is neither a country town nor
a place devoid of commercial possibilities It
is becoming tho social and urtistie as well as
tho political capital of tho Nation Its growth
has been permanent and substantial as well as
rapid and tho accretions to its population
especially during the five yeais Inst gone
havo been from the wealthy and educated
classes of the whole country a sort of pcoplo
accustomed to the belter things in lifo nnd
literature to offer whom tho journalism of a
stagnant vlllago must bo to provoke n quality
of neglect not wholly freo from contempt
Firmly established nmong these people and a
necessary complement to their presence here
is a mcrcantilq interest fully equal in
importance to any similar interest in
other cities of like size Open to
their trade and waiting for the advent
of such a newspaper as Tun Itrluml
can has become is a rich and populous coun
try stretching to tho Ohio Klver on tho west
and to tho Carollnason tho south crossed by
many lines of rail and nearer to Washington
by from five to ten hours of travel than to nuy
nther important center A newspaper that
will penetrate this region and open runways
of trade through it will give Washington n
greater Impetus In six months than nil the
four page weakliilgs that over languished
hereabout could impart in a century
It is a mistake to publish an eight pago
paper for a four page constituency hut Till
ImUiincVN is making no such mistake It
Is an equally serious mistake to attempt to
satisfy an eight pago constituency with n
four pago inner and to that mistako the
1usi is wedded fast

That portion of the annual message of tho
President which treats brlelly of civil service
reform has called forth from press and public
univeisal praise even from those who havo
been tho persistent enemies and opponents of
hisadmliiislratiou It is worthy of note that a
nunihcr of papers which have habitually hurled
at the President the vilest of epithets and In
nuendoes from the beginning of his tcnuroof
office until tho piesent aro now compelled
to grant that meed of praise which lii3
wiso and conservative course Bliould havo
long since evoked Those who have charac
terized all of his better acts as hollow
pretentious and niuretrielous aro now
freely and witli seeming earnestness pro
nouncing ids utterances to be thoso of a can

tonotothis favoriblo reception of the opin

It excites tho liopo that tho party of progress

The Moimtnlit Cnmiimicf g Lnlior
Senator Illicit has introduced a bill to in
vestigate the matter of political assessment
This might he and It may lie a veiy small
matter indeed seniccly worthy if inoio than
passing notice without tho waste nf space for
editorial comment Yet to ono who would
forceasto tho near future this lceolmhui
Is significant It Is not to bo presumed that
tho senator has any Idea nf thoroughly in
vestigating tho conduct of tho committee nf
his own party which excrtid every in
tlueneo which it could bring to bear upon
the friends of bourbonlsm who aro em
ployed by this republican administration
as well as upon those nf its suppnrters who
sue living in hopo of nn office in tho event
of democratic executive ascendancy It
might lie regarded ns piesumptuous to oven
mention in connection with assessments
tbo vigorous nnd rlgorousilcmnuds liuidoupon
the brewers und saloon keepers of Ohio
which brought to tho treasury of tho demo
cratic committee more than three hundred
thousand dollars of a coiruptloii fund On
tho contrary it Is given out that the animus
of tho senator is that tho affairs of
tho republican congressional campaign com
mittee shall bo Investigated especially in ita
relations to Maiionj Mr Ilixic desires to
know beyond poradventuro of a doubt how
ninny of tho disfranchised nogroos within tho
boundaries nf tho Commonwealth of the Old
tloinlnloii wero uidedin tho payment of their
capitation tax by tho freo and voluntary con
tributions of patriotic republican yeomanry
If the senator pushes this matter hu will
ate post df wo may judgo of tho futuro con
duct of that party which Is ic ponslblo for
tho invoitlgntlons of 73 to TO by tho history
which It made during thoso years wo may
well fnrcseo what Its policy will probably bo
when It ngain commences operations with a
majority in tho popular House In this light
tho first effort uf Fcnntor Unfit becomes
worthy of moro than pawing notice becauso
it is Indicative of tho spiilt of modern De
mocracy It leads us to suspect and antici
pate a renewal of tho disgraceful nnd costly
scries of investigations of tho past Wo may
fairly prusumo that tho democratic majority
will spend 111 force in laboring for tho Ming-
lug forth of very tsmnll mice Tho firat nolo
of this really nhlo leader of leaders it tho
democratic party was not sounded thought-
lessly nor did its dulcet tones fall upon un
willing or startled cars in his own party It
is tho result of Hint peculiar process of ratio
dilation comnlon to democratic statesmen
which inevitably constrains them to follow
the mental processes of their antiquated sires

A Hold Scllcmc
A schemo is said to boon foot for lifting ten
millions of dollars from tho National Treasury
as a free gift to certain entcrprlsiug individu

upon tho United States They havo novcr

priation of that amount by Congress and to
havo it paid to persons who can pioduco ccr
tifleatesof tho Statu of Virginia declaring tho
StutoofWost Virginia to ho indebted to tho
holders thereof in thu amounts therein named
Tlicso certificates were not issued by the Ko
adjuster government but by tho Hoiiadav
government under tho far famed McCul
liOH bill passed by tho interest compounding
debt increasing fundcr bourbons Thoy de
clared one third of tho State debt of Virginia
fully discharged by theso dishonored drafts on
West Virginia Tho latter State says sho
knows nothing about them and will pay noth
ing To speak plninlyWcst Virginia fairly owes
ten millions of tho debt of old Virginia con
tracted bofore tho division and flatly repudi
ates it Tho reader can well Imagino how
easily a small syndicate could secure theso re
pudiated certificates for a song Indeed their
original holders would readily give up ninety
dollars In every hundred to any enterprising
lobbyists who would undcrtako the job6f
having them benevolently paid out of tlio
Treasury of tlio United States And wjiy
not Section 8 of artlclo 8 of tlio constitu
tion under which West Virginia was admitted
into tlio Union in 1602 reads as follows
An equitable proportion of ttie jublfe debt of
tho Commonwealth of Virginia prior to the 1st
day of January 1851 shall bo assumed br this

This plain provision has up to this day licon
wholly disrcgaidcd nnd the cicditors of Vir
ginia find themselves unablo to persuade Wijst
Virginia to pay any portion of tlio debt of
which tho old Stato has just agrocd to pay two
thirds Is it strange that tho holders of re
pudiated Stato claims should accopt an invita
tion to mako a raid on tho United States
treasury when the invitation is extended by
a great statesman whoso fair fame has never
been sullied hy any association with tlio Vir
ginians wiio mo called rcadjustcrs
The ten million bill is aald to bo already
framed and ready for presentation in con
gress Tlio projectors aro a littlo uncertain as
to whether it should como from tho republi
can or the democratic side Thcro will bo no
bribery of course unless It 10 bribery to give
away worthless certificates which tlio succoss
of tlio raid would mako wortli par Tho
bchcnio would not ho formidable had it not
tho indorsement in advance accompanied
with a vigorous argument of ono who has
twice been biiatchcd from tho jaws of tho
Presidency As to who would got tho ten
millions well that would depend on who has
gobbled up tho most of tho certificates issued
against West Virginia hot us hopo that this
modest sum will not bo dished out hastily
mid that if tlio haul must bo mado it may bo
attended with as littlo scandal ns possible
