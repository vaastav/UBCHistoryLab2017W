SEES PEACE DELAY
AS UNREST CAUSE
President Wilson So Declares in
Message Read Before Both
Houses of Congress.
BUDGET SYSTEM IS URGED
Necessity of Increased Production to
Help Decrease Cost of Living—
Imperative Need of Definite
Program Concerning Labor.
Washington, Dec. —President Wll
tion's message, which was read to both
bouses of congress today, only Inci
dentally mentioned the peace treaty,
blaming the delay iu ratification as
one of the causes of nation-wide un
rest. The president said:
1 hope that tun grass will bring to a
conclusion at tin* session legislation look
ing to the establishment of a budget sys
tem. That there should be one single au
thority responsible for the making of all
appropriations and that appropriations
should be made not Independently of each
other but with reference to one single
comprehensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's income there
can be no doubt. 1 believe the burden of
preparing the budget must. In the nature
of the case. If the work Is to be properly
done and responsibility concentrated In
stead of divided, rest upon the executive.
The budget so prepared should be sub
mitted to and approved or amended by a
single committee of each house of con
gress, and no single appropriation should
be made by tlie congress, except such as
may have been Included In the budget
prepared by the executive or added by
tlie particular committee of congress
charged with tlie budget legislation.
Another and not less Important aspect
of tlie problem is the ascertainment of
the economy and efficiency with which
the money s appropriated are expended.
Under existing law the only audit Is for
Hie purpose of ascertaining whether ex
penditures have been law fully made with
in the appropriations. No one Is author
ized or equipped to ascertain whether
the money has been spent wisely, eco
nomically and effectively.
Taxa ion Question Taken Up.

linnieUiale consideration to tlie problem

“O Henry." whose real name was
William Sydney Hotter, wjm horn at

from or are connected wlift the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and permanent
peace permitting return to normal con
ditions, from the transfusion of radical
theories from seething European cent.-rs
pending such delay, from heartless
profiteering resulting In the Increase of
the cost of living, and, lastly, from the
machination" of passionate and malev
olent agitators. With the return to
normal conditions, this unrest will rap
idly disappear. In the meantime It
does much evil.
It seems to me that In dealing with
this situation congress should not be
Impatient or drastic, but should seek,
rather, to remove the causes. It should
endeavpr to bring our country hark
speedily to a peace basis, with ameli
orated living conditions under the min
imum of restrictions upon personal lib
erty that Is consistent with our recon
struction problems. And II should arm
the federal government with power to
deal In Its criminal courts with those
persons who by violent methods would
abrogate our time-tested Institutions.
With the free expression of opinion
and with the advocacy of orderly polit
ical change, however Rundamental.
there must be no Interference, but to
ward passion and malevolence tending
to Incite crime and Insurrection under
guise of political evolution there
should be no leniency.
Should Extend Food Control.
I renew and strongly urge the neces
sity of the extension of the present
food-control act as to the period of
time In which It shall remain In opera
tion, The attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing for an exten
sion oi this act for a period of six
months As it now stands It Is limited
In operation to the period of the war
and becomes Inoperative upon the
formal proclamation of peace. It Is
imperative that It should be extended
at once. The department of Justice has
built up extensive machinery for the
purpose of enforcing Its provisions; all
of which must he abandoned upon the
conclusion of peace unless the provi
sions of this act are extended.
Haring Ibis period the congress will
have an opportunity to make similar,
permanent provisions and regulations
with regard to all goods destined for
Interstate commerce and to exclude
them from Interstate shipment If the
requirements of the law are not com
piled with. Some such regulation Is
Imperatively necessary The abuses
that have grown np In the manipula
tion of prices hv the withholding of
fnnelstnffs and other necessaries of life
cannot otherwise be effectively pre
vented. There can he no doubt of
either the necessity or the legitimacy
of such measures.
The presielent ronewpel his recoin
mediehithins thnt n Inw lie passed reg

gooels destined for Interstate com
merce should he markeei with the
price nt which they left the hands of
the producer. He also urged the fed
eral llcens'nc of corporations engag
ing In Interstate commerce. Coming
■o the question of Inhof, the message
said;
Labor and Capital Peace Renewed.
No one who has observed the march
of events In the Inst year can fall to note
the absolute need of definite program
to bring about an Improvement In the
condition of labor. There ran be no set
tled conditions leading to increased pro
duction and a reduction In the cost of
living if labor and capital are to be an
tagonists Instead of partners.
Sound thinking and an honest desire
to serve the interests of the whole na
tion, as distinguished from the interests
of a class, must he applied to the solu
tlon of tins great and pressing problem.
The failure of other nations to consider
lids matter In a vigorous way has pro
duced bitterness and Jealousies and an
tagonisms, i lie food of radicalism The
inly way to keep men from agitating
against grievances is to remove the griev
ances An unwillingness even to discuss
those matters produces only dissatisfac-
II m and gives comfort to the extreme
elements In our country, which endeavor
tu siir up disturbance in order to provoke
governments to embark upon a course Of
retaliation and repression. The soed of
revolution Is repression.
Toe remedy for these things must not
lie negative in character. It must be con
structive U must comprehend the gen
eral Interest. The real antidote for the
unrest which manifests Itself Is not sup
pression but a deep consideration of the
wrongs that beset our national life and
the application of a remedy.

Collective Bargaining Right.
Governments must rusogntza the
rignt of men collectively to bargain for
humane objects that have at their base
th< mutu.ii protection and welfare of
those engaged In all industries. Labor
must not be longer (✓mted as a com
modity. It must be regarded as the
activity of human beings, possessed of
deep yearnings and desires. The busi
ness man gives his best thought to tlie
repair and replenishment of tils ma
chinery. so that Its usefulness will not
be Impaired and its power to produce
may always be at Its height and kept
In full vigor and motion.
No less regard ought to be paid to
the human machine, which, after all.
propels the machinery of the world
and is the great dynamic force that
lies back of all industry and progress.
Return to the old standards of wage
and Industry In employment are un
thinkable The terrible tragedy of war
which has Just ended and which has
brought the world to the verge of
chaos and disaster would be In vain It
there should ensue a return to the con
ditions of the past.
taibor not only Is entitled to an ade
quate wage, but capital should receive
a reasonable return upon Us Invest
ment and Is entitled to protection at
the hands of the government In every
emergency. No government worthy of
the name can play these elements
against each other, for there is a mu
tuality of Interest between them which
the government must seek to express
and to safeguard at all cost.
The right of Individuals to strike ts
Inviolate and ought not to be inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment but there Is a predominant right
and that Is the right of the govern
ment to protect all of Us people and to
assert Us power and majesty against
the challenge of any class. The gov
ernment. when It asserts that right,
seeks not to antagonize a class but
simply to defend the right of the
whole people as against the Irreparable
harm and Injury that might be done by
the attempt by any class to usurp a
power that only government Itself has
a right to exercise as a protection to
all.
Hour of Test and Trial.
This Is the hour of test and trial for
America. By her prowess and strength
and the Indomitable courage of her sol
diers, she demonstrated her power to
vindicate on foreign battlefields her
conception of liberty and Justice. Ls-t
not her Influence as a mediator be
tween capital and labor he weakened
and her own failure to settle matters
of purely domestic concert be pro
claimed to the world.
There are those In this country who
threaten direct action to force their will
upon a majority. Russia today, \f<ith its
blood and terror. Is a painful object les
son of the power of minorities. It makes
little difference what minority It Is;
whether capita! or labor, or any other
class; no sort of privilege will ever be
permitted to dominate this country, We
are a partnership or nothing that is worth
while.
We are a democracy where the ma
jority are the musters or all the hopes
and purposes of the men who founded
this government have been defeated and
forgotten. In America there Is but one
wa.- by which great reforms can be ac
complished and the relief sought by
classes obtained, ami that ts through the
orderly processes of representative gov
ernment Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies of
this country.
America will not be daunted by threats
nor lose her composure or calmness In
these distressing times. We ran afford,
in the midst of this day of passion and
unrest, to be self-contained and sure.
The Instrument of all reform In America
is the straight road of Justice to all
classes and conditions of men. Men have
but to follow this road to realize the full
fruition of ttielr objects and purposes, 1-et
those beware who would take the shorter
road of disorder and revolution. The
right road is the road of Justice and or

Ohio’s Plan for 25 Per

OPPOSE RAISE IN PRICES
Declares Government Will Not Object
if Increase Can Be Given Without
Boosting Cost of Coal—South
west Outlook Brighter.
Washington, Dee. 9. —“Not one cetft
can be added to the price of coal to
finance any increases In the wages of
miners," Fuel Administrator Garfield
declared, after reading press dis
patches that Gov. Cox of Ohio had pro
posed that miners and operators in
tlint state compromise on the basis of
a 25 per cent advance in pay for the
men.
I>r. Garfield Indicated that the gov
ernment would Interpose no objection
If the Increase could be given without
advancing coal prices.
“There will he no Increase In the
present price of coal as fixed under
the Lever act," Lr. Garfield said, "no
matter what local arangements and
agreements are put Into etfect.”
He added that his position was ab
solutely unchanged from that taken
on Nov. 20 with the authorization of
the cabinet.
I)i. Garfield explained then, In sug
gesting the 14 jier cent advance, which
the miners promptly rejected, that he
was not fixing wage scales, and hud
no authority to do so. He Indicated
that the Increase suggested was merely
‘.hat which the operators were able
•o grant withe <:t advancing the price
}f coal which the government has
fixed.
The government has under consider
ation additional suggestions for reliev
ing the acute coni shortage in those
parts of the country where industries
are reported ns facing a paralysis of
activity.
Dr. Garfield Is In control of the coal
situation. Through him the various
governmental departments have been
co-ordlnaied in an effort to make the
most of a bad situation created by the
soft coal miners’ walkout.
Columbus, 0., Deo. 9. —Industries

CUT TRAINS ONE-THIRD
DRASTIC STEP TAKEN TO SAVE
COAL ON RAILROADS.
Administration Decides That North
west, Central West and Southwest
Shall Be Affected.
Chicago, Dec. 8. —Train service out
of Chicago to all points west, north
west and southwest was cut one-thlrd
by a drastic order of the United brutes
railroad administration for the con
servation of coal.
The order, which was directed to
It. H. Ashton, Hale Holden and B. S.
Bush, regional directors of the North
west, central West and Southwest re
gions. respectively, also called for the
immediate removal of parlor cars, the
curtailment of switching and the
lengthening of schedules to meet the
demands which the reduction- of the
number of trains will make upon the
service.
Increase In mall and express train
service, customary to care for the
Christmas traffic was forbidden, and
railroad officials were Instructed to
care for the rush with added cars.
Washington, Dec. 6.—An increase In
miners’ wages described as greater
than the 14 per cent suggested by Doc
tor Garfield was agreed upon by the
scale committee of the operators In
Ihe central competitive field. The com
mittee’s announcement said It had
been decided to advance the rates per
ton for mining coal to pick and ma
chine miners 11 cents In the “thin
vein" district. This, It was said, would
result In giving the machine miners a
rate of around 81 cents per ton. and
the pick miners a rate of around 97.04
cents, though It necessarily would vary
in all fields.
Reports of miners drifting back to
work were received from various parts
of tbe country, but conditions in tbe
central fields In the main appeared
unchanged. The new o,ffer. the oper
ators believed, would break down the
stubborn holdout of the miners and
ere long soft coal again would be is
suing from (he shafts In volume and
relieve tbe country of tbe disastrous
effects of a coal famine.

Proctor becomes effective today. By
its provisions Industries not on the

This provision throws from 150,000
to 300,000 wage earners out of work
