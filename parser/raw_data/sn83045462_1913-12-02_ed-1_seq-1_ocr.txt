FATE OF OUTLAW
IN MINE A SECRET
No Message Comes From
Ralph Lopez. Mexican
Slayer of Six Men.
NOT UNTIL WEDNESDAY
WILL SEARCH BE MADE
Sheriff Will Take No Chances of
Further Losses in Hunting
Fugitive.
T>iX'?HAM. I'tah, December i-The fate J
"I Ra!ph Lopez, slayer of six men. today
remained a question wli^li only the re
in<I of the bulkheads am! a search of
the I tali-Apex mine, where he took ref
ute. would answer. All night sulphur
smudges poured d?-adl\ gases into the tun
nels. and deputies watched each exit to
shoot the desperado on sight.
Fumes from wet gunpowder were also
(Greeted into the underground corridors.
These fumes hang close to the ground be
neath the lighter gases that have been
pouring into the mine since yesterday
morning. It was expected the powder
fumes would settle into the slopes not yet
penetrated b> gases of less density.
Think Cranovich Escaped.
The seven sheriffs in charge of the man
hunt are convinced that Mike Cranovich,
who recently shot and seriously wounded
his wife, is not in the mine. They found
e\ idences. however, that he had hidden j
then before I.opez entered the Andy tun- j
ne! last Friday.
The failure of Lopez to attempt a I
dash from the mine led some to the
belief thai the resourceful Mexican has
found a secure retreat from the gases
and would live to fight another under
ground battle.
Sheriff Andrew Smith said today that
he would not allow his men to take
;tny more risks of being shot and that
he would not open the mine for another
search for Lopez for forty-eight hours
from the Uine the fires were startled.
If this plairis carried out the bulkhead
ivhich now bars the passage into the
mine will not be removed until Wed
nesday afternoon. Until that time the
<ulphur fumes will continue to be
poured into the mine.
Silent Throughout Night.
A hundred deputies remained on guard
throughout the night, but no sound came
from the mine. The last word from the
fugitive was heard yesterday, when he
called faintly for his former comrade and
partner. Julius t.'orrello. Twice be called
Mulio." in a voice that indicated pul
monary trouble, but when he was an
swered some time later there was no re
sponse from within, and it is the belief
that the deadly fumes have accomplished
their purpose.
Only such work it? has been necessary
has been carried on here in the last few
Jays and business affairs generally are
iit a standstill, so IntcKse has become the
interest in the man hunt. The streets
and hills In the vicinity of the mine
which holds the murderer are filled with
men anxious to lend whatever assistance
they can to capture Lopez.
Countrymen Against Him.
His own countrymen have turned
against him, and threats were made that
Lopez would never reach prison alive,
even though he escarps death in the mine
and surrenders.
T.opez began his outlaw career Novem
ber -j!, when he killed a fellow Mexican.
Later that day he killed the chief of
jMjIiee and two deputies who pursued him.
After a chase through the mountains of
several counties he returned to Bingham
and took refuge in the mine, where he
kill?-d two more deputies Saturday.
Discussing the Ohio Floods.

board of army engineers appointed by
Secretary of War (iarrison to investigate
?h?- <i'iestion of floods and flood preven
tion in the Ohio valley met b^re today to

FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE
READ BEFORE CONGRESS
Joint Session of the Houses Held
This Afternoon to Receive
the Document.
President Wilson read his first annual
message to Congress today at a lolnt
.~>ssion of both branches at I o'clock
Jn the House chamber. The message,
among the briefest of documents of its
kind from any President and some ft.OO!
words long, required less than thirty min
utes for reading, though it treated upon
a variety of subjects.
Probably the most striking feature of
the message Has the recommendation for
presidential primaries. Mr. Wilson pre
sented a suggestion that legislation be
promptly enacted providing for primary
elections throughout the country at which
tiie voters of the several parties "may
choose their nominees for the presidency
without the intervention of nominating
conventions."
Party conventions, the President
urged, should be retained. "l?ut only tor
the purpose of declaring and accepting
the verdict of the primaries and formu
lating the platform of the parties."
Suggestion Regarding Delegates?
I r
The President suggested. however,
that the delegates consist of the nom
inees for Congress, the nominees for
the vacant seats in the Senate, the
senators whose terms have not yet
closed, the national committees and the
candidates for the presidency them
selves "in order that platforms may bc
rramed by those responsible to the peo
ple for carrying them into effect." That
's essentially the system which Mr
\\ Hson introduced in the New Jersev
Siate conventions.
The Mexican situation President Wilson
dismissed with brief comment, reiterating
the sentiments he expressed in a special
address to Congress upon the same sub
ject some time ago and expressing the be
ief that the Huerta government slowly
was crumbling and that the I'nited States
probably would not be obliged to alter its
policy of waiting.
No program for trust legislation was
present, d, lurther than mention of the
desirability of an early amendment to the I
. herinan law "to prevent private monop- '
oly more effectually than it has yet been
prevented. and an announcement that
the President would later address a spe
cial message to Congress dealing solely
with that subject.
Features of the Message.

the President indorsed; the ne.'d for con
centration by the Senate on the pending

THE ESTIMATES.
Address of President Wilson
At Joint Session of Congress
Gentlemen of the Congress: .
? 1 (
In pursuance of my constitutional duty to "give to the Congress information of the state of the
Union." T take the liberty of addressing you on several matters which ought, as it seems to me. particu
larly to engage the attention of your honorable bodies, as of all who study the welfare and progress of
the nation.
1 shall ask your indulgence if I venture to depart in some degree from the usual custom of setting
before you in formal review the many matters which have engaged the attention and called for the
action of the several departments of the government or which look to them for early treatment in the
future, because the list is long, very long, and would suffer in the abbreviation to which 1 should have
to subject it. 1 shall submit to you the reports of the heads of the several departments, in which these
subjects are set forth in careful detail, and beg that they may receive the thoughtful attention of your
committees and of all members of the Congress who may have the leisure to study them. Their obvious
importance, as constituting the very substance of the business of the government, makes comment and
emphasis on my part unnecessary.
The country. I am thankful to say, is at peace with all the world, and many happv manifestations
multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of interest among the nations, fore
shadowing an age of settled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the nations
manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes
of frankness and fair concession. So far the United States has stood at the front of such negotiations.
She will, I earnestly hope and confidently believe. gi\ e fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause
of international friendship by ratifying the several treaties of arbitration awaiting renewal by the Sen
ate. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the Department of State to gain the assent, in
principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing four-fifths of the population of the world, to the
negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences <>f interest or of policy
ari^e which cannot be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy ihcy shall be publiclv analvzed.
discussed and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by ihc parties before either nation determines its
course of action.
TO MAINTAIN PRESENT MEXICAN POLICY.
There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the United States
and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations
to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establish
ment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already assumed.
There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over
Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his
usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on all hands, indeed, thai such pretended govern
ments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United Stales. We arc the
friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than its friends, we are its champions;
because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every wav to make proof of
our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has 110 government. The
attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has
been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the
-urpation of Victoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to plfey-~tk6" part, of constitutional presi
dent. has at last cast aside even the pretense of Ic al right and declared himself dictator. As a con
sequence, a conditions of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it^ doubtful whether even the
most elementary and fundamental rights eithert)f her own people or of the citizens of other countries
resident within her territory can long be successiully safeguarded, and which threatens, if long con
tinued. to imperil the interests of peace, order and tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south
of us. Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purpose, in despite of the constitution of the republic
and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which
could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a
more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the
moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has
been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the col
lapse is not far away. We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting.
And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional order restored in distressed Mex
ico bv the concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own
ambitions.
HOPES FOR EARLY CURRENCY LEGISLATION.
I turn to matters of domestic concern. You already have under consideration a bill for the re
form of our system of banking and currency, for which the country waits with impatience, as for some
thing fundamental to its whole business life and necessary to set credit free from arbitrary and arti
ficial restraints. I need not say how earnestly I hope for its early enactment into law. 1 take leave
ARGUES NEWMAN
CONTEST IN BRIEF
Frizzell Insists on Right to
Question'Eligibility of
Commissioner.
FACT OF APPOINTMENT
NO PROOF, HE CONTENDS
Insists Court's Refusal to Review
|
Would Be to Confirm Arbi
trary Power.
Declaring tliat Justice Anderson in sus
taining the motion to quash the writ of
quo warranto Issued against Oliver P.
Newman to show by what warrant of law
he held the office of District Commis
sioner and attempted to exercise its func
tions, ignored the opinion of his associate.
Justice Wright. counsel for William J.
1-rizzell. a taxpayer who questioned the
eligibility of Mr. Newman, today liled
in the District Court of Appeals a printed
brief of thirteen pages.
W hile it is conceded that Justice
Anderson had the power to adjudge that
the court was without jurisdiction in the
cause, counsel for the petitioner denv his
power to reverse the decision of the court
upon an* questions which eould arise
upon a motion to quash. As to these
questions; it is contended, the order of
Justice \\ right that the writ should is
sue was linal and conclusive.
Insists on Right to Sue,
The other general objections made to
the decision of Justice Anderson that Mr.
Newman is eligible to hold office and
that the court would not review an ex
ercise of executive discretion are three
fold. It is claimed that the right to sue
out a writ of quo waranto for usurpatior
of a public office is not confined to the
I law officers of the government; that Mr.
i Prizzell. being a citizen and taxpayer, is a
| "person interested" in tie office of Com
! niissioner within the meaning of the code,
! and that the action of the President and
, the Senate on the nomination of Mr. New
1 man is not conclusive as to liis qualliica
tions, and constitutes no bar to a judicial
examination of such qualifications.
Attorneys William J. Neale. Arthur A.
Birney and Joseph W. Railey in their
i brief on appeal urge that "in the case at
, bar Congress did not submit to the Pres
ident the decision of any question of fart,
but laid down a peremptory rule of quali
fication. within which any appointee must
come. Had the statute required that none
but women should be qualified* for tlie
office, would it be held that if the Presi
dent appointed a man such ap{>ointmenl
would conclusively determine him to be a
woman?
| "We respectfully submit that to deny
! to the courts the right to inquire if ar
! appointment to public municipal office ii
' in violation of law is to declare the ex
istence of that arbitrary power in tin
executive for which the opinion declares
there Is no room in our theory of govern
incnt."
Not Directed Against President.
The point is also maoe that the writ ir
the Newman.case is not directed against
President Wilson, but seeks to oust Mr
Newman as "one disqualified by law t<
receive the executive appointment.'
Dwelling on this viewpoint the briei
reads:
"The power to appoint to office is no"
inherently an executive function and be
longs to the President only when con
ferred by law. It may be exercised as
well by either of the other departments
of government if a statute so provides.
"The office in question was created h\
the act of Ih7n and the executive power
to appoint Commissioners came only from
that statute. Discretion in selection was
given the President subject to two lim
itations which required: That the ap
pointees must be citizens of the I'nitej
J States: that they must have been 'actual
residents of the District of Columbia for
three years next before their api?oiiit
ment.*
'"?The right of choice was thus con lined
to a class. an?l persons not within that
class were and arc disqualified from seek
ing or discharging the functions of civil
Commissioner. The non-resident is as
much disqualified as the alien: no more.
The writ here is not directed, against
the executive, but seeks to oust the re
spondent as one disqualified by law to
receive the executive appointment. Con
gress has declared that the alien or the
J non-resident may not exercise the func
, tions of that particular office.
Cited as a Parallel.
?*l?o the appointment and eontirniation
j establish qualifications which did not ex -
j ist and render him capable to receive ap
I pointment whom the statute disqualifies
J from receiving it'.'
j "To affirm this is to declare that the
? disqualified alien candidate for elective
! office, may point to bis majority at the.
polls a.s a conclusive answer to a quo
? warranto on the ground that the voters
I have by their ballots determined that he
j is qualified. We submit that there is no
i w arrant for the iK>sition assumed."
j Counsel for Mr. Frizzell ?leny that
; there is involved any question of
j judicial invasion of executive discretion
l in a review of the courts of the eligi
. biiity of Mr. Newman The statute did
not Impose, It is claimed, on the l'resi
: dent a duty to determine facts from
1 evidence. It prohibited an unqualified
| man from taking office, it is asserted,
i On the question of "interest" which
! would entitle Mr. Krizsell to sue out

in the three sections of the eode pro
viding for quo warranto proceedings
is there a word or phrase to distinguish
