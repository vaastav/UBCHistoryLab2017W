An article appeared in yesterday'
Union, containing several forms of Bonds
fur Good Conduct, ()th of Allegiance,
Guarantee of Trotcction, 4c.,' follovty;
by some remarks from General J'.Oh't-
CHANS. T;io article was preceded by
few brief paragraphs, which should have
-appeared as a communication, but, throug
n oversight of the compositor, they ap
pearcd as editorial We correct thic, be
cause ono of these jircfatory remarks
was directly contrary to what we have
stated before, namely: "The form of
Bond and Protection, heretofore publish
cd, is intended for loyal citizens only.
We have positively stated the contrary
on a previ ins occasion, and if we under
stand the inclining of plain language
Governor Johnson and General Bosk
cbanh, tnke the panic view of the matte
that we do, and certainly they ppeak by
authority, inasmuch as the Bonds, etc
are issued by their authority. Loyal
citizens are not required, nor desired, to
give Bond, or t.iko tho oath of allegiance
The Government asks no oath or bond of
.such, unless no other evidence of their
loyalty exists. We sincerely hope that
all who have departed from the path of
loyalty, w ill take the oath and observe
it, faithfully. A bleeding .State asks it
of her misguided citizens.

significant in iiiiiiUnth, and in character
Tho diflVulty in removing this system
which looms up among us, like a dark and
flame-crowned volcano, i;i the midst of a
flow ery idand, originates in that universal
timidity which men feel in assailing an
inveterate and ancientcvil. Loudly as we
oulogizp martyrs there are but lew of us
who aro willing to rUkthc perils of

approve it," but dread to reach it by
traveling thorny paths, and climbing pre
cipitous steeps. Wo indulge the hope,
that by some unknown process, "tho evil
will remedy itself," and natural indo
lence, combining with timidity, per
suades us to let it alone. Slavery is a
great evil it is a great misfortune that
ever a slave was In ought here it would
bo an excellent thing if every slavo was
removed from the country, hut vow is
an unpropitioti.4 time to agitnte the pro
priety and mode of its extinction,

which m i iiih riidlcrs, but when wo sug

we nre pinvely told that there i.-t danger
of excit iog t l.e people! Of all seasons
the present set tns to us, the most favora
ble for discussing the slavtry t-ucbtioti
fully, freely and honestly.. .' other
species of property is exempted from the
most liberal discussion. Nobody con
tends that t:ii ill's should not be discussed
for fear of .ciiing lnanufai liners ; and
nobody coiiteiiils that tin; policy and

dreds of millions of capiiol are concern

trammelled discussion must be protected
on every topic 1 iscussion must be as
free as IhougU itself. If the nation were
perfectly pacific, (hire would be much
greater plausibility in )!, plea that wo
ought not to excite or agitate the public
mind ; but r.s the people are already ex
cited, and excited by the unprovoked act
of 111" flav interest itself, we cannot
but think that this is a peculiarly lining
time fr ttimigning sl.vvi ry at the bar of
common sense, juMice, and patriotism,
and trying it to bee whether it will die
or live. If innocent, let it lite,- bnt if
guilty, let it die.

luiiuiy, in Hi ii nuuiu, vv iuu inuov mu-
strous outrage imaginable, to commenco
the discussion of so delicate a question
al a time when the land had just found
peace. Such men will never discuss the re
moval of slavery. These will never discuss
the removal of anything. They have but
one idea, and that is compromiie. They be
lung to that class of men who when pal-
riots pitched the tea into Boston Harbor,
aid that it was an unjustifiable
trespass upon private property; ant
who 'insisted that General Warren
should withdraw his Continentals from
Bunker Hill, and send a peace Comtuis
sioner to tho British General. Bnt we
desire to see slavery discussed some day,
says these self-styled conservatives
When ? When there are 8,000,000, in
stead of 4,000,000 f slaves to remove,
and the obstacles in the way of
their removal are twice as great; and
twice as numerous as they are now. We
doom our children to grapple in a death
struggle with a monster, in its matured
aud full-developed strength, which wo
fear t- striko in its infancy. Wen of the
Union Irienda of American nationality
everywhere fhall we act tho part of
bold nnd resolute patriots, or shall we
skulk like faint-hearted and selfish time
servers from tho contest? If the first,
we can make this the brightest era in
tho history of our country ; if the last,
then all posterity will curge us as imbe
ciles and cowards.
Tho great benefactors of the human
race, who have immortalized themselves
by their original ideas in politics, sci
ence, in mechanics, and in art, havo all
been called fanatics by their contempo
raries. Tho Savior was crucified, and
his disciples martyred by men who
dreaded their innovations in religion.
Galilko, Columhus, and Fulton were
regarded as visionary madmen. J kffkr

Affairs in Kentucky.
The Legislature of Arkansas lias as
sembled at Litllo Bock in tho early part
of this mouth. Gov. ltector, for some
time a refucee from the capital, was pre-
sent and delivered his message, and then
resigned his lost. Mr. r letcher, Presi
dent of the Senate, thereby became acting
Governor, Col. 1' ianmgan, who had beat Â¬
en Gov. IJector in the race for that oflice,
being in the army and not having made
his appearance.
I'orsomo time a very animated con
test was kent ui for the Senate of the
Confederate States in place of B. C. John
son, who was opposed by Mr. Garland.
Johnson was elected. In a spew h de
livered by him ho is said to have con
fessed that lie had assisted in destroying the
best (hvenmient that ever existed, but that he
had joined his destiny with tho South
and would abide tho result.
One cannot but be reminded of the
sad soliloquy of Maciikth, after ho had
murdered his king and benefactor, and
the family of another of his friends; in
which he exclaimed :
11 I Kill
In M- o 1 h-i .t-e--d, that nhoulfl I w.-idn no nioto
H- turning iv,r,- ih t,Uon-i iu y uYr."
The rebel Senator feels that lie is 6teep
1 in the blood of his country men, and
that he has assisted in the ell'ort to des
tiny the government, w hich is the inild-
st and most blameless of all upon tho
arth. Still, (hough racked with remorse,
he is goaded onward by despair. Who
would h wo the mental tortures of such a
self-convii ted traiti r for all t lie wealth
and bonus of the world? Better be a
lave under the lash of a cruel taskmas
ter.
Vni.TAUt, speaking of law, said : "I

The seceded Stales might make a sinii-
ar remark in reference to the rebellion
They will be nearly ruined, if they fail
in their revolt, and they will bo utterly
ruined if they succeed. Lawsuits and
rebellion are pci illous niethodt of obtain

It appears that JaiT Davis is endeavor

facture of turpentine and rosin has bren
commenced by a firm in Maryville,
Eight thousand pine trees hav been

California abounds in vast pine forest
and tho manufacture of rosin, tar and
turpentine, iitberto confined to the alavo
Slates, will no doubt be exceedingly
profitable to her citizens. Without pre
tendingto possess tho gift of prophecy
we may safely predict that these pro
due's of the pine forests of California,
manufactured by her intelligent, frae,
white laborers, will hold a far higher
place in the market than those produced
by the stupid and barbarous slaves of

If we remember rightly, Richard tho
Third, found such great difficulty in ob

Richmond, that he offered his Kingdom for
one. But then what do asses want with

WASiUNaToNjPec. 2 General Halleck,
the commander-in-chief, in his report to
tho Secretary of ar, states that he start
cd on the 2iih of July to visit the army
of tho Rotomac to ascertain if there was
a possibility of an advance upon Rich
mond from Harrison' Landing, and if
not, to fjrm some plan for uniting the
armies of Pope and McClellan, tho latter
of whom was of the opinion that it
would require 50,000 more men. Halleck
replied that there could not possibly bo
more than 20,000 sent.
General McClellan asked time to con
sider the matter till morning, when ho
agreed to go on with that number. On
Halleck's arrival home ho received a dis
patch that at least "5,000 would bo re
quired. The report slates that such re
infurccments could not bo sent without
leaving Washington and Baltimore al
most defenceless ; and an order for the
withdrawal of the army of the Potomac
was issued on the 3d ot August.
A previous order having been given for
the removal of the sick, and transports in
vast numbers supplied. But a protest
was received from General McClellan on
the 5th, and that tho order was not put
in lorce Tor eleven days. On the 1st or
ders were issued to General Burnsidc to
embark at Newport News lor Aquia
Creek, who arrived promptly on the 3d.
A review of tho movements before
Washington is made. He says a part of
the Army of the 1 otomac was ordered
forward from Alexandria, and that Gen.
Cox was ordered by rail via Washington
from Western Virginia wi'h the main
portions of his force. Of General Pope's
order on the 27th to General Porter to be
at Bristow Station the next morning, he
says : For some unexplained reason Por
ter did aot reply, and his corps was not
in the battks of the 28th and 29th, in
which General Pope gained some ground,
although the battles were not decisive.
Of the reinforcements from Alexandria,
embracing at length the whole Peninsular
army, it is laid that some of the corps
moved with becoming activity, but the
delays of others were neither creditable
nor excusable.
The soldiers actually eniratred in these
battles fought with treat bravcrv. but
many thousands straggled away from
lueir commands, and it is said not af.'w
voluntarily surrendered to the enemy so
as to be paroled. It is added that had
the Army of Iho Potomac arrived a few
days earlier the rebels could have been
easily defeated and perhaps destroyed.
The losses at South Mountain and Antie
tam are put at 1,742 killed. 8.0150 wound
ed, and !I13 missing; a total of 10,721.
The rep rt states that the armv rested
on the north bank of the Potomac, near
Sharpsburg, from the 17th of Septemb.r
to the 2d of October, and sava that thn
long inactivity of so large an army in
tue lace ol a defeated foe, during the
most favorable season for ranid marches
and vigorous campaigns, was a matter of
great disappointment and regret.
uen. iiaiieclv says no telegraphed Gen.
McClellan on the Gth, to cross the river.
Gen. McClellan disapproved the nlan of
crossing south of the Blue Bridge, but
proposed to cross at Harper's Ferry and
move on Winchester; but he did not cross
until October 2(5, and then at Berlin,
tho passage occupying till November 3.
