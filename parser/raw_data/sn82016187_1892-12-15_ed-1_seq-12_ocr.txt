Mr. Eeed (Me., E.) This is to distribute
our speeches a very small sum for such an
advantage as that.
Mr. Eichardson If all of tho speeches weie
as good as those of the gentleman from Maine

Tho call of committees for reports was barren
of results.
In the consideration of the morning hour tho

against tho bill, and quoted the rule that pro
vides that busiuess unfinished at tho end of

day of the subsequent session of that Congress.
Mr. Outhwaito suggested that if thero was
any force in the point the House would not bo
able to transact any business uutil the six days
had elapsed.
Mr. P.urrows (Mich., R.) remarked that tho
whole dilliculty aioso from tho failure of this
Congress to adopt the rules of tho last Congress.
Tho Speakor said that ho could find no de
cision of any kind of his predecessors bearing
on the question. By implication the rule pro
vides that business unfinished at tho close of
onesession of a Congress could not be consid
ered during the first six days of a subsequent
SLSsion. So the chair would sustain the point
of order.
Mr. Boutollo (Me., R.). Then tho Houso can

out action.
The anti-option bill was then taken up, but

into Executive session, and when the doors
were opened adjourned.
Speaker Crisp received an ovation when he
ascended the step3 leading to his desk to-day,

other in cheering. This was because of tho

tion reciting that a certain newspaper in New
York charges that clerks in the Postoflice
Department at Washington are in tho habit of
excluding newspapers from the mails as second
class matter without previous notice to tho
publishers, and it has been discovered that there
arc persons residing at the Capital who will at
tempt the adjustment of difficulties of this sort
for a money consideration, and seek employ
ment on account of influence possessed with
persons occupying responsible positions; that
men holding important offices under tho
Administration have received tho same privi
leges permitted to campaign committees, but
pronounced illegal when ordinary citizens
would seek for them. ThoPostmastor-Gencral

each taken personal advantage of tho opportu
nity to use the mails in a manner that tho De
partment pronounces illegal for other citizens.

POLITICAL
i
Doings of the Different Parties :and
Their Representatives.
A Klvnl tine to Colon.
Tho Panama Eailroad Company propose to
establish a new lino of connections with tho
Atlantic and Pacific ports of tho United States
as soon as its present contract with tho Pacific
Mail Steamship Company expires. It is pro
poscdito establish a lino of steamers between
New York and Colon to connect with another
line operated from Sah Francisco to Panama.
This lino of steamers will bo in operation very
shortly. It is iutendod to mako three depart
ures a month from San Francisco, giving a
service every 10 days.
Tho same advantages accruing to tho dry
goods trade will be shared by cutlery, hardware,
provision, and tho grocery trades. Heretofore
the service between San Francisco aud New
York has requiiod some 42 or 45 days to trans
port freight. Under tho new regime it will not
take moro than 30 or 32 days from New York
to San Francisco.
Tho fact that Speaker Crisp was snubbed at
tho dinner given last week by tho Eoforni
Club in honor- of tho Democratic President
elect, has been an absorbing topic, for several
days past Speakor Crisp had received an ,in
vitation from tho club to bo- present on.Sat
urday night, and couched in such language as
led him to believe that ho would be expected to
speak. Consequently he had prepared an ad
dross, aud on arriving in Now York, gave out
copies to the uewspopcr mon, who sent it all
over tho country with tho regular reports of
tho proceodiugsat Madison Square Garden. It
was not only bolioved by tho Speakor that ho
was to address tho gathering, but all tho papers
which printed the advance notices of tho
affair treated Mr. Crisp's prcsouco in this
capacity, and at the banquet Mr. Crisp occupied
a prommont place at tho raised table whero tho
orators of tho evening wero.
It was after ho had listened to tho eloquence
of all tho great Democrats, and when the hands
of the clock pointed to a quarter to 12, that
Mr. Crisp sprang to his feet with an angry
flush on his face, and without a word to any
one walked hastily to tho cloakroom, put on
his hat and overcoat and abruptly left tho
building. A rumor was started that ho had
been taken ill, but to a reporter who followed
him Mr. Crisp denied that his health was in
tho least affected.
"Aren't you going to speak?" ho was asked.
"I am not," Mr. Crisp icpliod.
"Why ?" was tho next question.
" Because it seems that I havo not been in
vited to speak," was the Speaker's answer.
"But your speech hasaheady been sent out
to all tho newspapers of tho country, just as
you prepared it to be delivered hero," returned
the astonished reporter.
"That is true enough," said Mr. Crisp, with
a tremor in his voice, which showed that his
effort at calmness was not wholly successful.
"I was invited to the dinner, and my invita
tion was worded in such a way that I under
stood that 1 was to be called upou to mako an
address. I prepared one and gave it to mem
bers of the press, at their request. Tho impres
sion seems to have been general that I had been
asked to speak. However. I havo uot been
asked to speak to-night." With this he closed
tho interview, strode out into the street, and,
entering a carriage, was driven to tho Hoflmau
House.
It was said that a friend of Mr. Crisp who
was at the dinner in the expectation of hear
ing tho Speaker's address, seeing one after an
other on the orators' rostrum introduced as tho
night was waning, and fearing from an intima
tion that he had heard that Mr. Crisp was to
bo ignored, induced n member of tho Reform
Club near him to send a noto to Mr. Anderson
inviting his intention to his omission to call
upon the Speaker. .Mr. Anderson, however,
took no notice of the hint, and his manner at
tho moment of reading tho noto convinced Mr.
Crisp aud his friends that the slight was in
tentional. This will enhauco the bitterness of tho
Speakership fight, for although denials and ex
cuses havo been made all around that tho con
trolling element of tho club and Mr. Crisp's
bitterest opponents in tho Houso wero present
at the dinner, is well known, and tho whole
object of the affair, tho Speakers friends claim,
was to humiliate Mr. Crisp and glorify Mr.
Cleveland.
The Montana Democrats havo lost tho Cho
toau County case, and"in consequence tho Legis
lature. Justice Black issued a writ of manda
mns during tho vacation of tho Supremo Court
ordering tho canvaBsiug board to Choteau.to
count the Box Elder precinct. Last weokmW
tornoys for Hamilton, the Democrat to whom
the legislative certificate was issued, made mo
tion to quash tho writ. Chief Justice Black
delivered an oral decision on the case, saying
the majority of the court had decided against
the motion. The Democrats filed a demurrer
to the writ, but Leech got the certificate. The
Legislature, with Leech seated, will stand:
Democrats, 35; Republicans aud Populists. 35.
With tho Populists tho Republicans will'bdabkr
to orgunizo the lower House,"w,here,,il,is .'un-7
derstood, two Democrats with majorities of less
than 10 votes will be unseated.
It is likely that a caucus of the Domocra''-.
Representatives at Washington will soon jc
called to consider the proposition embodied in
bills now before the House for the change of
the date of the meeting of Congrofa from tho
first Monday in December to tho first Monday'
after the 4th day of March of eaclt year. Tho
matter is receiving tho serious attention of
some of the Democratic members of the Com
mittee on Judiciary. t
The opinion has been expressed that although
the proposed change might be a valuable one,
yet it is well to be cautious and conservative in
taking such a step. The suggestion has been
also made that it might bo desirable to obtain
the opinion of the Democrats generally by
holding a caucus. If such a change us that
proposed should be made to apply .to the 53d
Congress just elected, the object aimed at by
tho advocates of a special session of tho new
Congress would be practically attained.
It is now stated that tho California Legisla
ture, which meet? Jan. 2. will be unablo to
electa Senator to succeed Senator Felton. Tho
People's Party, from the latest returns, holds
the balance of power, and it is said that its
eight representatives in the Assembly will vote
as a uuit for the Populi9t candidate, who shall
bo chosen by a majority of these eight. This
will leave to Gov. Markham, a Republican, tho
duty of filling the vacancy in the United
States Senato uutil the Legislature meets again
in 1893.
Tho Kolb mon are making trouble in Ala
bama. They have made up their minds to fight
Gov. Jones to the end, and they are now con
ducting tho fight on tho line of economy. This
has proved attractive to many members who
bcloug to the regularly organized Democracy.
Indeed, the leader in the light for ecouomy is
a regular. Many bills making reductions havo
beeu introduced. The salary of tho Attornoy
General of tho State is now fixed at $1,800.
"I am having a bitter fight to save my State
from dishonor," said Gov. Jones to-day, "and
I am going to win in tho end. 1 will block
the State Government, shut up the schools, and
close tho courts before I will consent to nulli
fication and repudiation on tho part of tho
Legislature."
Tho People's Party conference in Topokalast
week closed without anything startling hap

they attempt to organize the Kansas House.
"Jeff" Hudson, Congressman-elect from tho
Third District, said iu an interview in Topeka:
"Wo do not really expect to organize the

A New Religions Sect.
E. Loney is creating quite a disturbance in
the vicinity of Raleigh, N. C. and is the
founder of a now religious sect who style them
selves tho "Holy Oues." Ho claims to bo sent
of God to give tho last warning to tho saints,
nud admonishes his hearers to sell all their
property and give it to tho sustenance of tho
Gospel, which Gospel is represented by Lonoy.
With this man camo four women, and they
havo been preaching in the suburbs of tho city.
Lonoy teaches that unless both mon and
women aro sanctified by tho Gospol before
marriage that when married thoy aro violat
ing God's law, and that those who married bc
foio they wero sauctified must loavo thoir
wivos and husbands or thoy will ho lost for
ever. This now sect has rapidly increased, and
now numbers several hundred. At their meet
ings it is usual to call upon all present who be
long to the "Holy Ones" to givo -up all their
jewelry, and they pile it up on tho floor in the
middle of tho church, and frequently on tho
ground whon thoy gather out of doors, and
then Lonoy and his four women take posses
sion of it and it is never seen auy more. Thoy
teach that it is wrong to call in a doctor when
any ono is sick, and onu woman is known to
havo permitted her child to dio of pneumonia
rathor than commit a sin by calling in a doc
tor. They also teach that tho men of their sect
may have as many wives as they choose, if the
women belong to tho sect, and that a member
may barter with another male member of tho
Beet for a now one, provided the woman he
longs to tho sect. Many silly women have
been infatuated and have sold their personal
property and given it to tho leader. Somo

A Philadelphia Paper Humeri Oat.
Tho building occupied by tho Public Ledger
in Philadelphia, Pa., caught on firo on Dec. (J,
and was damaged to tho extent of $200,000,
$150,000 of which is suffered by tho paper, and
$30,000 by tenants. The house was a five-story
brownsteue building with a mansard roof, aud
tho fire is supposed to havo originated in tho
basement. Tho flames in this part of tho build
ing wore quickly subdued, but shortly after
the firo appeared in tho top Btory, occupied as
tho composing-room.
Tho place was completely burned out before
tho firo became controllable, and the torrents of
wator which were poured on it dripped through
tho building, damaging tho whole place, and
leaving nearly 10 iuchc3 of wator around the
presses in the basement. 'The work of getting
tho paper out was begun at another place,
whero typo and everything but presses were in
readiness for such aniexigency as the prcsonfc.
Every daily and weekly paper published in
tho city kindly tendered the use of their presses, .
but those of the Record, wore accepted, and tho
paper appeared the next day the same as usual.

Tho Nicaragua Canal.
Tiio report of the Nicaragua Canal Company
sont to tho Senato by tho Secretary of tho
Treasury states that since tho organization of
the company 10,145 shares, aggregating $1,014.
500, havo been subscribed for at par, of which
amount $1,001,450 havo been paid into tho
Treasury in cash, and from other sourcos tho.
Treasury has received $39,300. The other as
sets consist of concessions, rights, privilogos.
Ninotoon miles of tho ronto havo beon
cleared; CO milos of telegraph line orected; a
tolophono system established ; six mile3 of
railroad'constructed through swamps to cnablo
thd contractors to begin work on tho big cut at
" tho eastern divido." It is claimed that tho
.demonstration has been mado of tho salubrity
of 'tho climate, tho'ofliciency of labor, and suf
ficiency of tho estimates of the Chief Engineer
for the- harbor, canal dredging, and railroad
work. Tho Government of Nicaragua, Nov. 8,
1890, officially declnred that tho company has
more than complied with tho provisions of tho
concession, requiring the expenditure of $2,
000,000 during the first year of tho work. This
confirms tho company's titlo to the concession
ary rights for a term of 10 years in which to
complcto tho canal.

Tho Itcport of tho Attorney-General.
Tho business of the Dcpartmeut of Justice is
largely and continually increasing, as is shown
by the report of Attornoy-Gcneral Miller. The
most noticeable incroaso is in the businoss be
foro the Court of Claims. The reference to that
court, for investigation and findings, of claims
for tho taking and injury to property of por
sons assumiug to have beon loyal during tho
war, such claims being alroady 9,000 and 10,
000 in number, and in an amount aggregating
nearly $400,000,000, and still more rccontly,
tllo duty imposed upon tho Court of trying
claims for Indian depredations, such claims al
ro:tdy filed being over 8,000 in number and ag
gregating over $33,000,000. aro vory suggestivo
of tho growing work of tho Department.
Tho Attorney-General says that, as tho re
sult of the organization of tho Circuit Court of
Appoals, tho number of cases iu the Supreme
Court is being reduced. Ho again calls the at
tention of Congress to tho bill passed by the
Fifty-first Congress authorizing tho construc
tion of three United States prisons, to ho lo
cated onu north aud another south of the 39th
degree of north latitude and east of tho Rocky
Mountains, and tho third west of the Rocky
Mountains, but for which work no appropria
tion was made. Ho says tho need of such
prisons is very urgent.
Distress in 3'urone.
In England and Germany tho signs of dis
tress among tho poor people and the agricul
turists arc increasing daily. During the last
week the small British farmers gave utterance
to their troubles at tho agricultural conference
in St. James Hall. The speeches for protection
and bimotalism, aud such other panaceas as tho
spokesmen suggested, give an inadequate idea
of tho feeling of tho majority of the men pres
ent. Among the groups many bittor com
plaints weie hoard. "Are we to be starved for
a theory?" shouted one man when Franci3
Smith mado his plou from tho platform for free
trade.
In Germany, even tho rich Provinces in the
Rhino country have their thousands of unem
ployed aud half-fed families. This fact ha3
moved tho Chambers of Commerce in Munieh,
Stuttgart, Strasshurg, Cologne, and Manhoiui
to protest against the bill before tho Reichstag
to retard emigration.
In Berlin the Minister of Trade, Herr von
Borlopsch, lias three Secretaries answering tho
written complaints of Boards of Trade, miners'
.committees, and agricultural societies. From
tho remote famine-stricken Provinces of Russia
and tho agricultural Provinces of Austria
Hungary como the appeals of the half-starved
peasants to swell the cry of distress.
,-Auothor lirooklyn Bridge-Jump or.
Daniel McLaughlin, 37 years of ago, from
.Roanoke, Va., jumped from the Brooklyn
Bridge on 'Dec. 8, and camo out unhurt. At
one end of the bridge he secured a ride with a
truckman, and when near the center of the
bridge, and tho highest point above tho water,
McLaughlin jumped from the wagon, was over
tho parapet, and made his terrible leap.
Tin's was all dono so quickly that no one could
stop him. As luck would have it the polico
boat happened to be around, and reaching the
scene. ju3tas the man was about to strike out,
'ptfHcdVlU'in' iii'tld'hoat. Ho appeared to bo
su'lfenhg Wi'a chlil' after he had been pulled
out of tho icy wator, but beyond that ho was
uninjured. When asked why ho had jumped
from tho bridge he said that when ho was
crossing on tho truck ho saw a scaffold on the
bridge (one of those used by painters at work
thero), and, thinking ho was going to bo
hanged, ho jumped into tho river to escape,
lie is at present a prisoner in the hospital,
land' will shortly be taken to court.

The Cost of tho IVorlrt's Pair.
Moro nfoncy bin already been .paid out in
creating the World's Fair than the Directors
thought would bo necessary to complete it
when Congress voted to send the Exposition to
Chicago. Ton million dollars was thought to
be the limit them Auditor Ackerman's report
shows that tho expenditures to Dec. 1 havo
been $12,400,235.01. Tho receipts have been
$13,229,451.98. The available balance on hand
J)ec. 1 was $('G3, 006.33, about enough to last two
weeks at tho present rate of expenditures.
But tho souvenir coins aro coming soon, and
tho Directors have nearly $2,000,000 yet iu Ex
position bonds, from which no capital has been
received, so that tho machinery will bo kept
well lubricated.

A .Monument for "Wisconsin Soldiers.
A writer in tho A3hland fWis.) 1'rcss thinks
it the doty of tho citizens of that State to erect
a monument commemorating the deeds of the
Wisconsin soldiers in the lato war, aud sujiRCSts
that July 4. 1898, the State's 50th birthday,
would be the proper time for its dedication. He
thiuks the hill overlooking Camp Baudall,
Madison, from which nearly 50,000 soldiers
were organized for the field, and whero some
500 Union and Confederate soldiers lie buried
in tho cemetery close by, wonld be the proper
place to erect the monument, which should be
of Wisconsin Rrauite. Ho also thinks the Grand
Array of the Republic should take hold of the
matter and work it to a successful conclusion.

One Kind of Saving.
Detroit Free Press.
A thrifty woman had joined one of those co
operative saving societies whoso earthly func
tion is to protect its patrons against cxtortion
ato prices by securing to them a reduction of
10 per cent, at tho stores belonging to the com
bination. She was enthusiastic over tho op
portunities for economy tho scheme presented,
and her husband wa3 rather disposed to be
skoptical on tho subject.
At the close of tho first week she had a talk
with him.
"You don't believe in the society?" shesaid,
tentatively.
" Not altogether," ho confessed.
" Well, whotbor you do or not, I've saved $10
this week ; over $1.50 a day for sir days." ,
"How?" ho inquired.
"By using my tickets, of course. I bought
$100 worth of things and only paid $90 for
thorn."
"Ah ! " ho said, beginning to figure.
"Yes; I did, and next week I'll save $25, or
over $A a day," aud she was more enthusiastic
than over.
" No, you won't, my dear," he said, emphati
cally. "You aro altogether too economical.
This business of spending $225 to save $25
won't work. You throw that ticket in the
firo and begin to rotrench and reform in somo
other direction, ploase," and she began to cry.

Thero are hundreds of thousands of immi
grants in this country who havo never re
nounced their allegiance to the Governments
of tho countries from which they came. Ono
of tho propositiops before tho Senato Commit
tee on immigration is for the enactment of a
law requiring all alien immigrants to renounce
thoir allegiance to every foroign power as soon
as they arrive here, if it be thoir purpose to re
main here. Wo had troublo with the Italian
Government over tho New Orleans afTair be
causo tho Italians in whoso behalf that Gov
ernment claimed damages wero subjocts of the
King of Italy, and thus under his guardian
ship, though residents of this country. Tho
Senato Committeo will probably incorporate
tho proposition presented to it upon this sub
ject in tho bill for the bettor regulation of im
migration, which it is now proparing for tho
consideration of Congress.
