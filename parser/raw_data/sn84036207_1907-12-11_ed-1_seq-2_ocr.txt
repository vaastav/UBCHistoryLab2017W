Third Birthday.

widows were the guests recently of W.
C. Brown, a pioneer of 1847, who cele
brated his 83d birthday with a banquet
at a local hotel, and thereby en
trenched his reputation as "the gallant
of Dallas."
"Uncle Bill" is himself a widower.
All the widows of Dallas are not old.
but distinguishing lines of every kind
were wiped odt at this little dinner.
Old and young, infirm and dashing,
somber and picture-hatted, wealthy
and struggling, sat on a common level.
Their laughter and conversation made
melody that was musical to hear.
Passing widowers looked on longingly.
The host occupied the place of honor.
Many a sparkling eye, and some from
which years have stolen luster, lin
gered just a moment on him. Mr.
Brown is handsome.
Mr. Brown was called on for an aft
er-dinner speech, in which he wished
that the widows of Dallas might have
long life and prosperity.
SPORTING NOTES.
The list of winners on the English
turf during the season just closed
shows Richard Croker in ninth place,
with three winnings to his credit, all
made by one horse, the Derby winner,
Orby. Colonel W. Hall Walker, M. P.,
leads the list of winners with 12
firsts, made by seven horses, the total

lost to the Oregon Agricultural col
lege for the football season of 1908.
They are the retiring captain, Frank
Pendergrass; Emily, left end; Bennett,
left tackle, and Rhinehart, right half.
Carl Wolff has been elected captain
of the team for another year, and with
such stars as Barber, Jamison, Dunlap,
Kelly, Cany, Gagnon, Cooper and
Wolff to form a nucleus for the 1908
team, prospects are bright that O. A.
C. will retain her position at the front.
Rube Waddell, (he crack pitcher of
the Athletics, denies that he has been
released by the Philadelphia American
league team.
There will lie no post-season game
this year between Oregon Agricultural
college and Washington State college.
Having still a well-preserved sup
ply of enthusiasm left over from the
showing made by the Whitman team
this last year and the fact that but
two men will leave, supporters of
Whitman college, both in that institu
tion and on the street, are ready to
predict great things for 1908. That
Whitman will win the championship
next year is regarded as a conclusion
to be affected only by the whims of
chance.
"Packy" McFarland's recent victory
over "Kid" Herman gained him a
perch on the topmost rung of the
lightweight pugilistic ladder, and he
refuses to be removed from that perch
without a battle. *
Fight promoters and club managers
of Philadelphia do not want the Jack
O'Brien-Jack Johnson limited round
bout, and the chances are that the
contest will fall through.
President Comiskey of the White
Sox is planning to leave for California
within the next week. The "Old Ro
man" practically has decided that the
former world's champions will go to
the Coast for the spring training.

will be with the New Yorks; that is all
there is to that."
Mike Donlin will be hack in center
field for the New York Giants next
season. He wired from Champaign,
111., to a Chicago friend that he had
just signed, Manager McGraw having
submitted a fancy contract which
could not be turned down.
Walter Miller, the most successful
jockey in America, this year, at least,
has received from James R. Keene a
check on the National City bank for
$12.090.38, this being 5 per cent of
the money the jockey won for Mr.
Keene this year. Miller has ridden
50 winners for Mr. Keene, and the
total amount of money won in these
races was $245,497.75. Including the
fees from Mr. Keene, this hoy will
have earned before January I next
not less than $50,000. He has ridden
852 races and won 224 since the com
mencement of the season. Miller will
leave for California, there to resume
riding for Thomas H. Williams.
The National Baseball commission
has decided that the New York Na
tionals must pay the Now Orleans
club $1000 for damages sustained by
the latter through the refusal of the
Giants to finish their series with the
Philadelphia Americans last spring.
The commission again refused the ap
plication of Jimmy Sebring for rein
statement. he being obliged to remain
in the Tri-State league for life.
The greatest tighter in the west to
day is Young Ketchel, the Butte lad
who knocked Joe Thomas out in 32

Ketchel is one of the toughest and
best two handed fighters he has seen
in years.

COAL MINE DISASTER
OVER 500 LIVES DESTROYED
DY AN EXPLOS ION.
Terrible Calamity in Coal Mine at
Monongahela, W. Va. —Two Ex
plosions in Different Mines at Same
Time From Cause Unknown—Prop
erty Loss Over a Million Dollars.
Pittsburg.—A terrific and disastrous
explosion occurred Friday in mines
Nos. 6 and 8, of the Consolidation
Coal company at Monongah, W. Va.
Mine Superintendent Malon says at
least 500 men are entombed.
It is believed a majority of the en
tombed men were killed.
Mine No. 6 is located on the east
side of the Monongahela river and
mine No. 8 on the west side.
How the explosions occurred simul
taneously in both mines can not be
explained.
The explosion was heard for eight
miles.
After the receipt of the news physi
cians and special cars were despatch
ed from Fairmount to the scene. The
mine was too full of gas and smoke
for rescuers to enter.
It is said the explosion started in
No. 6 and spread to No. 8 mine, the
two being connected.
Another special says the first ex
plosion was followed by the blowing
up of a boiler in No. 8.
Some idea of the force of the explo
sion may be gained from the fact that
props from the mine were not' only
blown out of the entry, but were
hurled clear across the west fork of
the Monongahela river. Wires are
down.
It is feared that the accident will
turn out to be the worst in the his
tory of mining in this country.
Superintendent Malon telephoned
that of the 500 men who were in the
mine at the time he does not think
any could escape with their lives
from the force of the explosion. The
fans were started to clear out the foul
air and the rescuers were expected
to reach the men by 2 o'clock this aft
ernoon. The management declares
that it must have been dust.
A hospital was arranged at the
opening of the mine, where the wound
ed will receive attention. Several men
were practically blown out of mine
No. 8 through the force of the gas
explosion.
Possibly the largest coal-producing
mines in the state are located at
Monoftgah. The mines are both shaft
and slope mines, being worked by the
rope and haulage systems. They lie
on both sides of the West Fork and
are connected by a steel pier bridge
owned by the coal company. Until
about 10 years ago only American
miners were employed. At that time
the miners of Pennsylvania, Illinois
and Ohio were on a strike.
The coal company is one of trie
largest companies of the kind in the
country and is capitalized at about
$20,000,000. They have upward of 100
producing properties. Clarence W.
Watson is the president, with head
quarters in Baltimore. Superintend
ent Malon is said to be one of the
most practical men in the mining in
dustry.
Latest Report.
Known dead, 500.
Estimated dead, 558.
Estimated property loss, $1,000,000.
Number of rescuers, about 300.
At least 400 families affected.
Three hundred widows made in the
twinkling of an eye.
Over 1000 orphans result from dis
aster.
All but three of total number in
mine dead.
All machinery at both mines totally
destroyed.
Not a single official of the company
injured.
SAYS HELEN MER WAS PAID.
Colonel Cody Claims Testimony of No
Account.
Denver, Col., Dec. 11.—"Miss Helen
Mer was paid so much a word for her
testimony in the Howard Gould divorce
case, when she testified against Mrs.
Gould in New York," says Colonel
William Cody.
"After the lawyers for the defense
are through with her the evidence she
gave will not amount to anything,"
Colonel Cody added positively.
"As for reports concerning Gould's
offer to me to testify against the cha"
acter of his wife," he added, "I w r as
offered, not $25,000, but $50,000 to testi
fy and 1 refused the offer. I had an
idea that the stage needed cultivation
and advancement a few years ago, and
believing that Miss Clemmons would
be able to fill the job, I backed her for
that position. The results of that ex
periment are well known and I see
that I played the wrong card. It was
a business proposition; she lost out
and so did I. That was all there was
to it and and all that there was
between us."
Taft on Way Home.
Cuxhaven. —Secretary Taft, the pic
ture of physical vigor, sailed upon the

proceed.
Great disappointment is felt in Nel
son at the refusal of the Boundary
miners to accept the wage scale pre
vailing in other parts of the country.
In order to settle the dispute it is felt
that the Lemieux act should be in
voked, so that the grounds of the
miners in asking for a retention of the
old scale despite the tremendous drop
in the price of copper may be placed
before the general public.
The directors of the Amalgamated
Copper company have voted to con
tinue curtailment of the products of
the mines as near as possible on a
parity with the present basis of con
sumption. It was also decided to close
each or continue in operation such
mines and smelters as they deem best.
This latter action was taken with a
view of conserving the output at some
mines and smelters.
