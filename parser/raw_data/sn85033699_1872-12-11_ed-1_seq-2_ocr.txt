The Humboldt JburnaZ urges Hon. W
I. McFurland for Speaker of the Housa of
Representatives.
Poor Gbebley has' been buried jbufc a
'week, and nw tha telegraph informs us
that a suit has been commenced to contest
his last will.
The Secretary ot the Fertilizer Compa
ny of Cincinnati reports the receipt of 306
dead horses from the timo the epizootic

erage of about sixteen perday.
A contract. .has .bsenjdqsod.wlUj Jdr.
Froudo to lectare-in Cincinnati. His first
appeararce will bo on February 13, other

interesting, Father Burke should bo on
hand to reply to him.
It Is reported from Washington that the
United Spates Centennial Commission has
made an estimate of expenses, fixing them
at $7,500,000, and receipts of $5,000,000,
and that the commission will ask Congress
to guarantee the remaincler, 52,500,000; If
this bo correct, where are the profits on
the.stock to come from?
In the estimation of the Cincinnati Com
mercial, the mijqrity of the United States
Senate is composed of rather small men.
For instance, it sy: "The numerical ma
jority of the United States Senators find : it
extremely difficult to discipline .that pon
derous political criminal, Charles Sumner,
lie looks down upon them from an ellva
tion so prodigious that they are astounded
and appalled."
The Washington correspondent of theCin
clnnati Gazette writes:
"The mission to Ecuador was tendered
to Gen. Croxton, of .Ky., wholly without
his knowledge, and it is not known that he
has even yet heard or it, as he is traveling
for his health in Southern Colorado. Bum
sey Wing," of Ky., who now holds the
place, is the gentleman who brought can
durango to the attention of the. State De
partment." If Rumsey Wing is as great a humbug as
cundurango, the Government will be bene
fitted by his retirement.
The Philadelphia JPress (Forney's pa
per) says in its issue of Dec 7:
v "A conflict rages between the United
States authorities and the State government
of Louisiana, of which the redoubtable H. C.
Warmoth is the bead. This prince of ad
venturers desires to go to tho United States
Senate, and to be succeeded bj a Democrat
ic administration. In the furtherance of
these ends he defied the United States
courts and violated the laws of Louisiana.
Hence the difficulty."
That is it precisely. There would have
been no difficulty if Wanaoth had not been
willing to be "succeeded by a Democratic
administration."
Comments is being made on the finan
, c:al recklessness involved in tho hints and
recommendations of the Presidents mes
sage. According to a Washington corres
pondent of the New York Tribune a prom
inent Western Representative, discussing
this point and others in the midst of a
knot of his party friends, remarked that if
the message hsd been published before the
election it would have defeated Grant by
its extravagance. A Pennsylvanian, who
was one of the company, replied that the
President had bceu so strongly urged to
make the recommendations by Southern
and Western men that he had yielded to
them, well knowing that the temper .of
Congress was such that no such extrava
gant recommendations would be acted up
on. EFFECT OF THE BOSTON FIRE.
The Cincinnati Commercial has been
permitted to read a Boston letter that gets
"down to hard pan" in respect to the fire
a month since. The writer says:
The Assessors have gone over the books
and find 552 estates destroyed that were
occupied by 991 persons, firms and corpo
rations. The last appraised valuation of
the property burnt was set enty-five millions,
about one-tenth of the assessed valuation
of the city. The salvage, insurance, etc.,
will be at least thirty millions. The loss of
insurance stock falls very heavily on old
ladies and professional men."
In the Merchant's Insurance Company
the stock was worth about $175 per share.
In this company Longfellow, the poet,
held 37 shares, and Motley, the historian,
12. This was wiped out. There are a
multitude of such cases. The insurance
stock was 60 good thatsome of the banks
held large amounts of it, and have suffered
accordingly.
THE AXABA31A CONSPIKACV.
There Is some sense of propriety left
among Radical editors touching the course
pursued by some of their political brethren
in the South. The Cincinnati Gazette, a
Grant organ, cays:
" We sincerely hope the United States
Senate will not recognize the election of
Spencer to that body, from the State of
Alabamba. Spencer would be a disgrace to
tho body, anyhow a,fact that is fully un
derstood at Washington, but aside from
this his claim to an election by the Ala
bamba Legislature is ridiculous. Better
the seat should be vacant than have it filled
by Spencer or any other man chosen as ho
was."
If the little rebellion that has been gotten
, up by the Radical minority of tho Alabama
Legislature, had been perpetrated by Demo
crats, and a newly elected Democratic
Governor had pursued tho course towards
them that Gov. Lewis has, is there a man in
all this broad laud who doubts what
the Grant administration would have done
in the premises? Is there a man who
doubts that the military would long since
have dispersed these Rebels at the point of
tho bayonet, and have hustled Gov. Lew's
and his co-conspirators ofTto a military bas
tilo to bo tried for conspiracy and treason?
There cannot bo a doubt that this would
have been the course of tho Government if
they had been Democrats. Yet President
Grant calmly sita in tho White House and
allows these secessionists and conspirators,
who constitute a minority of the Legisla
tore of Alabama, tojgo through the farce
of organising fa Legislature and electing a
United States Senator, and the Governor
elect to ignore the regular Legislature hold
ing its sessions in tV place designated by
the Constitution T -" o t.!e, and recog
nising and co-opcx'it.iug with the rebeliious
members as the Legislature of Ala
bama, sotely because they aro Republi
cans. According to Radical logic, these men
aro guilty of rank treason, yet Grant dof s
not stir a finger to suppress the traitors,
and enable the regular Legislature, acting
under warrant of the Constitution, and
recognized by the out-going Governor a3
the lawful Legislature, to assert its author
ity and to transact the business for which
the Legislature was elected. Such episodes
as this could not occur in other times and
under other rulers than tho Radical party
have given us, and they ought to consign
to merited infamy the party that upholds,
in the conspirators.
POSTAX TECIXJKAPil.
We are pleased to see thatr very many of
our exchanges are decidedly opposed to thq
proposed scheme for tha. government to put
the telegraph under two management of tho
PostolB.ee Department. In cur estimation
It is one of tho most dangerous of those
centralizing projects that have been suggest
ed in the past few years. The Western
Union Telegraph Company is undoubtedly
a great, grasping and exorbitant institution.
But it Is unconnected with the politics of
the country. It Is a prlvato company, and
there is no legal let or hindrance to free
competition. If in the possession of the
government, besides being a monopoly,
would doubtless soon , become, like
the Postoffice Department, an annua)
buidea upon Lho treasury, and with its
numerous officers iu every States
would greatly increase the power of
the Federal administration iu controlling
both the Federal and State elections. Wo
have enough of that now under our pre
sent Internal Revenue system. Upon this
subject we have the following from tho
New York World:
"Auother scheme of a different nature
which will be pressed at this session, is the
purchase by the Government of the Western
Union Telegraph, to put it under the man
agement of the Postoffice Department
Tnere are many other objections to this
job besides the opportunities It would give
tho Government agents of practicing an
odious espionage over the business inter
course and private correspondence of citi
zens. They could in some me isure pro
tect themselves against this espionage by
sending their messages in cipher; .but
they would rather pay double or treble
rates than be subjected to this retard
ing, bothersome inconvenience. In
deed it would operate as a prohibition of
confidential communications by telegraph
except between persons who had already
established a cipher of which each possess
ed the key. Ail the rest of the community
would be deprived of the use of the tele
graph foe confidential messages, and would
have to send them by tho slow course of
the malls protected by sealed envelopes.
Bat there are other objections. Our mail
service is dilatory and inefficient, and the
telegraph service would be equally vexa
tious in the same incompetent hands. If
the Government cannot properly administer
one of these branches, the business being
too extensive far its capacity, with what, face
can it asp're to manage both? We should
simply have in the telegraph the post office
confusion worse confounded its delays
more dilatory,it3 imbecility more provoking,
and its evils more irremediable. There is
yet another consideration. The Post-ofllce
is not self-supporting; the country is taxed
some seven millions annually to make the
deficiencies in its income. Is it expedi
ent to run the risk of paying several othsr
millions iu the same way to keep the tele
giaph going? Moreover, when the tele
graph and Post office are made parts of the
same system, under the same management,
the franking privilege will be extended
alike to both. This may not bo dono in
the original bill; but it would pretty surely
be done in the next session of Congress af
ter its passage, for there is no distinction in
principle between free letters and free mes
sages when both are conveyed by the Gov
ernment. This scheme will be strongly
pressed, but we hope It is destined to fail."
From the Memphi3.ieagrer;
5iThe only orginal proposition in th3
President's message is that favoring the
purchase of the telegraph lines of the coun
try a dangerous scheme to extend tha
pDwers of the central government and ig
nore the rights of private citizens; a monop
oly which can be used against the opposlj
tion press and corrupted in favor of thti
managers, whenever they choose to engage
In gigantic speculations directly or through
their agents."
The Clarksville Chronicle says :
"The effort at centralization is strength
ened by a recommendation of the purchase.
by the government, of the telegraph lines, n
wnicn means a supervisor-ship ot the press
by theofficere of the Administration and the
consequent suppression of all dispatches'
that may reflect, justly or unjustly, upon
the policy or character of the Government
under Radical control. If the people en
dorse this dangerous measure, they will
sign the death warrant of their political lib
erties." The Trenton Gazette says:
"We are opposed to any such plan being
executed by he Federal government.
There is nothing in the constitution author
izing it, unless it be in that clause which
g.ve3 Congiess the power to establish post
offices and post roads. We do not think
this clause would empo ver Congress to es
tablish a system of telegraphs. Simply ap
pending the name "Postal telegraph,"
would not bring it within the clause. The'
framers of the constitution contemplated
no such system as this.
This would be but another step towards
centering all power at Washington. If wei
go on, and still on, in this policy, MUq
lines will yet be totally obliterated." When
a system is thus inaugurited we will bo in
the raid oceau of experiment, and cut loose
from our moorings. Men may smile at
such suggestions, but when changes in the
policy of a government set in, the history
of the world prove3that they nearly always
become more radical than at first anticipat
ed. Onr children "may yet read of tho
States registered on the pages of history as
among the things that were."
AMEXDJ1EVT OF THE CONSTITU
TION. The New York World favors anamond
ment of the Constitution containing the
following propositions:
1. Abolishing tho machinery of Presi
dential Electors, and letting the people voto
directly for President and Vice-President.
2. Limiting tho President to a single term
or (say) six years.
3. Giving all the appointed Federal offi
cers a term equal to that of the President,
but commencing and ending at the middle
of the Presidential term3. This would en
able the Prerident to become acquainted
with the merits of each officer, ana to de
cide intelligently whether the public service
would be promoted by his reappointment;
and, what is more important, it would pre
clude appointments as the mere reward of
party service in the elections, which is one
of the most corrupting things in our
politics.
4. Requiring all the State elections to be
held on the same day when the people vote
for President, and thereby facilitating an
honest expression of tho public judgment,
uninfluenced by the estimation of chances
which degrade our Presidential elections to
the level of betting on a horse-race.
The first and second propositions will do.
The third would be better if it were to
exempt from its application Cabinet
appointments and fixed the commencing
and ending of other appointments twelve
months Instead of two years after the in
auguration of the President. To the fourth
proposition we object, as it would be an
unnecessary interference of tho present
rights of the States to fix the time of hold
ing their own elections. Tho general gov
ernment has enough power now In inter
fering with local legislation. Many of the
State elections are now held upon the same
day with the Presidential election. We
think it would be better that all should be
so. But that can best be left to tte judg
ment of the several States.
Mr. Henry L. PiEncE, the Republican
candidate for Mayor in Boston, has declined
the nomination because the Republican
Central Committee determined that the se
lection of all officers of tho City Govern
ment should be controlled by national poli
tics. Mr. Pierce refuses to ba a candidate
on these terms, claiming that, as every citi
zen has a deep interest in tho welfare, of
the city, all are entitled, irrespective of their
political opinions, to a fair representatfSu
in the Municipal Government. This senti
ment, however just, is precisely what mere
office-traders refuse to understand. To
them the welfare of the city is a matter of
party ascendancy, and party ascendancy
means a distribution of public offices among
those who manage party nominations.
THE EDITORSHIP OF THE NEW
YOIIK TRIBUNE.
The New York correspondent of the Cin
cinnatl Commercial writes under date of
the 8th inst. as follows:
"H. 0. Bowen, editor of the Independent
and BrooElyn Union, who is intimately r-c
qualnted with th'e stockholders of the Tri
bune, prints the following report, which, in
the shape of a credited rumor, has been
afloat Tor several days:
" We aro ii formed on tha best authority
that the vacant edito'i I chair of the Tri
bune has been tend -red to Vice-President
Colfax, who has tho matter under considv
oration. It is probable tbst Mr. Colfax
will feel it to be bis duty to accept the po
sition, the most tempting pecuniary offer
now made. It is proper, iu this connection,
to say that Mr. Colfax, for some time past.
has been preparing to retire entirely from
public life to his quiet home at bouth Bend.
His income iu the future would have heeu
comparatively small; yet with his accus
tomed economy and rigid princi
ples of using within his means,
ho would have proceeded very com
fortably. He had many liberal business
offers made to him recently, but has de
clined them. all. The sudden and unex
pected death of Mr. Greeley has suddenly
and unexpectedly opened tuts new and in
viting fiaid to him. We sincerely hope and
expect he will promptly accept it.'
,;Mr, Colfax will, therefore, probably re
sign his oflico of Vice President ot the
United Statee, and step up to the hiher
office of Chief on the New York Tribune."
The Commercial expresses the opinion
that the rumor is incorrect, and adds: "Mr.
Colfax has neither tho local acquaintance
nor the experience for (be position. If the
stockholders were to offer him the position,
it would indicate their humble repentance
for the sins comrultteeVfigainst the Repuhli
can party, and their abject petition to be re
ceived again into tho ranks of tho faithful
followers of the Caucus."
A "MONEY CHANGER" SEEKING
OFFICE.
The "wild hunt for office" under the so
condcrm of the Grant administration has
already begun. The latest patriot who
thinks he is peculiarly fitted to wear Boutr
well's old clothes, is Mr. Henry Clews, ol
:xew lorir, wno is mixed up in an un
enviable way with the finances of Georgia
under the Bullock regime. Tho Washing
ton correspondent of the Cincinnati
Gazette, a Grant organ, writes, Dec. 8, as
follows:
"The friends and agents of Henry Clews
are iu this city urging his claims for the
secretaryship of the Treasury, which i3

WHAT 3IK GREELEY THREW
In rerly to a Utter written by State Sen
ator Palmer, of New York, to Mr. Greeley
after the Cincinnati Convention, in which
Mr. Palmer alluded to the fact that he had
called upon Mr. Greeley, in December,
1865, to persuade him not to publish the
celebrated article upon General Amnesty
and Impartial Suffrage, because its publica
tion would preventhis election to tho United
States Senate, and also to other insUnces
when he was in advance Of public senti
