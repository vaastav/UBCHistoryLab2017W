"Washington, Dec. 3.—The message of
President Cleveland was sent to Congress
to-day. It is as follows:
Tt> tin- __mgr_B» of tin: ( rnited iStatefi:
The assemblage within the nation's
legislative halls of those charged with
the duty of making laws lor the benefit
of a generous aud free people, impress
ively suggests the exacting obligation
and inexorable responsiblity involved iv
their task at the threshold of such labor,
now to be undertaken by the Congress of
tho United states, aud, iv the discharge
of au executive duty enjoiued by the
Constitution, I submit this communica
tion, containing a brief statement of the
condition of our national affairs, and
recommending such legislation as seems
to me necessary and expedient.
""-Phe history of our recent dealing with
other nations, and our peaceful relations
with them at this time, additionally dem
onstrate the advantage of consistently
adhering to a firm bul just foreign policy,
free irom envious or ambitious national
schemes, and characterized by entire hon
esty aud sincerity.
BEL ATIONS WITH HKI.iiH.M.
During the past year, pursuant to a
law of Congress, Commissioners were
appointed to the Antwerp Industrial Ex
position. ■ Though the participation of
American exhibitors fell lar short of
completely illustrating our national in
genuity and industrial achievements, j*et
it was quite creditable, iv view of the
brief time allowed for preparations.
1 have endeavored to impress upon the
Belgian Government the Heedlessness
and positive harmfulness of its restric
tions upon the importation of certain of
our food products, and have strongly
urged that the rigid supervision and in
spection nnder our laws are amply sulli
cient to prevent the exportation from this
country of diseased cattle aud unwhole
some meat.
PEACE IN* BRAZIL.
The termination of the civil war in
Brazil has been lollowed by the general
prevaieuce of peace and order. It ap
pearing at an early stage of the insurrec
tion that its course would call for un
usual watchfulness on tho part of this
Government, our navai force in the har
bor ol Bio de Janeiro was strengthened,
This precaution, I am satislied, tended to
restrict the issue to a simple trial of
streugth between tho Brazilian Govern
ment and the insurgents, and to avert
complications which at times seemed im
minent our firm attitude of ueurality
was maintained to the end. The in
surgents received encouragement of
eventual asylum from our commanders,
and such opposition as they encountered
was for the protection of our commerce,
and was clearly justiiied by public law.
A serious tension of relations having
arisen at the close of the war between
Brazil and Portugal by reason of tho
escape ot the insurgent Admiral lie Gama
and his followers, the friendly oiiices of
our representatives to these countries were
exerted lor the protection of the subjects |
of either within the territory ofthe other.
COMMKIU.TAL RELATIONS WITH BliA/.IL.
Although the Government of Brazil
was duly notilied that the commercial ar
rangement existing between the l'nited
States and tbat country, based on the
third section of the Tariff Act of Its .
was abrogated on August 28. \J__4, by the
taking ellect of the tariff law in lorce,
that. Government subsequently notified
us of its intention to terminate such ar
rangement on the Ist day of January,
lt-'.i.t, m the exercise of the right reserved
in tne agreement between the two coun
tries. 1 iuvite attention to the corre
spondence between the Secretary ol State
and the Brazilian Miuisier on the sub
ject.
CLAIMS AUAINST CHILE.
The commission organized under the
convention which we had entered iuto
witii Chile for the settlement ol the out
standing claims of each Government
against the other, adjourned at the end of
the period stipulated for its continuance,
leaving undetermined a number of
American cases which had beeu duly
presented. These cases are not barred,
and negotiations are in progress for their
submission to a tribunal.
TREATY WITH CHINA.
The 17th of March last the new treaty
with Ciiiua in further regulation was
signed at Wasningtou, aud ou August
l.'th il received tho sanction ofthe "senate.
Ratification on the part ot China and
iormal exchange are awaited to give ellect
to this mutually beueiiciai convention.
Till. WAR IN* TITE OKII'NT.
A gratifying recognition of tiie uni
form impartiality of this country toward
ail foreign States was manifested by ihe
coincident request of the Chiuese and
Japanese Governments that the agents of
tho United States should, wituiu proper
iinit, atlord protection to subjects of the
otner during the suspension of diplo
matic relations due to a slate of war.
This delicate ofiice was accepted, nnd a
misapprehension, which gave rise to the
belief that in aflording this kindly un
otlicial protection our agents would ex
ercise the same authority which the with
drawn agents of ihe belligerents had ex
ercised, was promptly corrected. Al-
THE RECORD-UNION.
though the war between China and Japan •
endangers no policy of the I nited States,
It deserves our gravest consideration by ,
reason of its disturbance of our growing
commerce interests in the two countries
and the increased dangers which may re
sult to our citizens domiciled or sojourn
ing in the interior of China.
Acting under a stipulation in our treaty
with Coiea (the lirst concluded with a
western power), I felt constrained at the
beginning ol the controversy to tender
our good oiiices to induce an amicable
arrangement of the initial difficulty
growing out of tbe Japanese demands for
administrative «•♦'• rm- In Cores, but the
unhappy precipitation of actual hostil
ities deieated this kindly purpose. De
ploring the destructive war between the
two most powerful of the Eastern nations,
and anxious that our commercial interest
in those countries may be preserved, and
that the safety of our citizens there shall
not be jeopardized, I would not hesitate
to heed any intimation that our friendly
aid ior the honorable termination of hos
tilities would be acceptable to both belli
gerents.
JAPAN Ol*' THK PRBSKNT.
Apart from the war in which their Em
pire is engaged, Japan attracts increasing
attention in this country by her evident
desire to cuilivate more liberal Inter
course with us, and to seek our kindly
aid in furtherance of her laudable desire
for complete autonomy in her domestic
atlairs and full equality iv the Janiily of
nations. The Japanese Empire of to-day
is no longer the Japan ofthe past and
our relations with this progressive
nation should not be less broad and lib
eral than those with other powers.
THE DISPUTE Willi ECUADOR.
A convention has beeu finally con
cluded for the settlemeui by arbitration
of ihe prolonged dispute with Ecuador,
growing out of the proceedings agaiust
Emiiio Santos, a naturalized citizen of
the L'nited Mates.
&EI__.T_ONS with FRANCE.
Our relations with the Republic ol
France continue to be such as should
exist between nations so long bound to
gether by friendly sympathy and simi
larity in their form ot government. The
recent cruel assassination of the Presi
dent of this sister republic called forth
such universal expressions of sorrow
aud condolence irom our poople aud
Government as to leave no doubt of the
depth and sincerity of our attachment.
The resolutions passed by the Senate and
House of Representatives su the occasion
have been communicated to the widow of
President Caruot.
OKi'MAN V's rUoHIBITION AGAINST IM
PORTATION OF AMKEIC'AN i All I.E.
Acting upon the reported discovery of
Texas lever in cargoes of American
cattle, the Germau prohibition agaiust
importations of live stock and fresh
meats Irom this country has been re
vived. It is hoped that Germany will
soon become convinced that the inhibi
tion is as needless as it is harmful to
mutual interests.
DUTY ON SrUAK.
The German Government has taken
exceptions against that provision of the
Customs Tariff Act which imposes a
discriminating duty of one-tenth of a cent
a pound on sugars coming from coun
tries paying au export bounty thereon,
claiming that the enaction of such duty
is in contravention of Articles V. and IX.
ofthe treaty oi 1870 with Russia. In the
interests of the commerce of both coun
tries, and to avoid eveu the accusation of
treaty violation, 1 recommend the repeal
of so much ol the statute as imposes that
duty, and I invite attention to the ac
companying report of the Secretary of
Stato containing a discussion of the ques
tion raised by the German protests.
THE SEAL QUESTION.
Early in the present year an agreement
was reached with Great Britain concern
ing instructions to bo given to the naval
commanders of the two Governments in
Behring Sea and the contiguous .North
Pacillc Ocean, lor their guidauce iv ihe
execution of the award of the Paris trib
une of arbitration and the enforcement of
the regulations therein prescribed, for ]
the protection of seal life in the waters J
mentioned.
An understanding has also been reached I
for the pay meut by the United States of ;
r&425,-JuO, in full satisfaction of all ciaims
which may be made by Great Britain for |
damages growing out of the controversy
over the lur seals in Behring Sea or the I
seizure of British vessels engaged in tak
ing seals in these waters. The award aud
findings ofthe Paris Uibunal, to a great
extent, determined the facts and princi
ples upon which these claims should be
adjusted, and they have beeu subjected
by both Governments to a thorough ex
amination upon the principles as well as
the facts whicn they involve. lam con
vinced that a settlement upon the terms
mentioned would bo au equitable and ad
vantageous one, and I recommend that
provision be made for tho prompt pay
ment of the stated sum.
Thus far ouly France and Portugal
have signified their willingness to adhere
to the regulations established under the
award of the Paris tribunal of arbitra
tion.
ALASKAN BOUNDARY.
Preliminary survey ot the Alaskan
boundary and a preparatory examination
of the question of protection of food lish
in the contiguous waters of Canada, are
in progress.
Tne sealing interests of Russia in Behr
ing Sea are second ouly to our own. A
tnodus rite.uli was therefore concluded
with the Imperial Government restrictive
of poaching on tho Russian rookeries,
and of sealing in waters which were not
comprehended in the protected area de
fined iv the Pari3 award.
BRITISH VKNK/.IKLA DISPUTE.
The boundary of British Guiana still re
mains in disputo between Great Britain
and Venezuela. Believing that its eariy
settlement on some just basis, alike hon
orable to both parties, is in the line of our
established policy to remove from ihis
hemisphere all causes ol differences of
powers beyond the soa, 1 shall renew the
efforts heretofore made to bring about a
restoration of diplomatic relations be
tween the disputants and to induce a ref
erence to arbitration, a resort which Great
Britain so conspicuously favors in princ- !
cipie and respects in practice, and which
is earnestly sought by her weaker adver
sary.
Hawaii's xew government.
Since communicating the voluminous
correspondence in regard to Hawaii aud
the action taken by the Senate aud House
of Representatives, certain questions sub
mitted to the judgment and wider direc
tion ot Cougress, the organization of a
Government in place oi the provisional
arrangement which followed the deposi
tion of the <meen, has been announced,
with evidence of its effective operation.
The recognition usual iv such cases has
been accorded to the new Government.
i:\IRADITION TKEATY WITH ITALY.
inder tho presont treaties of extradi
tion with Italy miscarriages of justice
occurred, owing to the refusal of tbat
Government to surrender its own sub
jects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate
an amended convention obviating this
difficulty have beeu unavailing.
RKLATIONS WITH MEMO.
Good will, fostered by many interests
! in common, markod our relations with
: our nearest Southern neighbors, and peace

of the late disturbers of her tranquillity.

[Copyrighted, 1894, by the Associated Press.]
Athens, Dec .*!.— Tho "£ Associated
Press, exclusively, has been able to give
to the world the lacts of the terrible
atrocities perpetrated upon Armenian
Christians in Asia Minor, and to-day a
representative of the Associated Press
succeeded in securing additional informa
tion confirming the previous statements
made.
The representative to-day mot twenty
Armenian refugees who arrived hore
from Armenia ailer a journey full of
hardships and sullering. Securing the
services of a first-class interpreter, he
gathered the Armenians together at a
.convenient place, aud having relieved
their pressi tur necessities, the interpreter
questioned the refugees concerning the
terrible events ot which they had iv a
number of cases been eye-witnesses.
This party of Armenians is tho lirst
that has escaped from the districts where
the massacres occurred, aud it is be
lieved that eveu worse remains to be
told, as the horrors described are under
stood to havo lasted for a loug time after
this party left. Most of the persons \\ in
told their stories to-day escaped from
Moosn, Bitlas aud Saiaonn. taking with
them what little thoy couid carry, and
making their way with the greatest ditli
cully to the Husso-Turkish frontier, ai i
going to Eryvan and i£tchmisdzin. Sev
eral Armenian women escaped Irom the
villages with this party, but when near
Frzoroum thoy died irom the effects ol
saber wounds indicted upou them belore
their escape.
For about eighteen months, tho Ar
menians say, tho Province of basso uu
has beon surrounded by f urkish troops,
uutil nobody has been allowed to enter
or leave. About four months ago tne
Turkish authorities learned that the in
habitants of \ artemis, a village outside
the frontier of Sassoun, wero sending for
the necessaries of me to tho village of
Dalvorig. Such communication between
the two villages being prohibited, tho
Turks massacred nearly all the inhabi
tants of Vartemia, This wss the second
massacre to occur. 'Fio hist took placo
about a year ago.
Una of the refugees, a man named
Khadjik, state.*: that iiis undo and aunt
were both killed, the latter being violated
previous to being put to death. An Ar
menian priest was killed for refusing to
celebrate Turkish rites in his church at
Vartemis. Tiie village contained d'2T. Ar
menian houses be:ore the Turks attacked
it, but when tho fugitives left only
twenty-live houses remained standing.
Dalvorig, it appears, is the largest vil
lage iv tue Province of Sassoun, and its
inhabitants, when they learned of the
norrors perpetrated by the Turks at Var
temis, attacked the Turks ou tho frontier.
The Turkish commander eventually sent
twelve soldiers iuto Dalvorig to learn
what had occurred. Tho Armenians, tilled
with indignation at the atrocities com
mitted by the Turks at Varteinis, at- J
tacked this detachment of Turkish sol-j
diets aud put them all to death.
When the Turkish commander heard j
of the death of his soldiers he deter- i
mined on vengeance in tho most bloody \
manner possible. A strong force of
Turkish troops was scut to the village
with artillery and the massacre begun.
The guns kept up a continuous lire upon
Dalvorig until practically not one stono
was lett standing upon another.
Selo, tho Bey ol luit/.oun, a Kurd, with
a detachment of Kurdish cavalry, went
with the Turkish soldiers to the village
ol Scmal, and lorcibly took the Armenian
priest from his church, after disgustingly
deiilmg the sacred vestments and the
priest's hands. They then bound him
ou a douko3', which thoy drove a distance
of a few yards. The soldiers then lired
at the priest, aud killed him and tho beast
he was bound to. In tho samo village
the Turkish soldiers entered an Armen
ian house aud violated a woman and her i
daughter, the latter being 14 years of age. !
From this village Selo forcibly took eight
Armenian girls and scut them to his
harem at Init/.oun.
Further atrocities wero committed by
tho Turks at tho village of Keliebueseu.
Before dawn this place was surrounded
by soldiers, and while the inhabitants
were still asleep it was set on lire. The
brutal soldiers entered tho residence of a
mau named Araket, who was asleep with
his wife, and tortured them both In a hor
rible manner with red-hot irons. At
this village the soldiers killed ttie Ar
menian priest Margosa, witii twenty
other inmates of a house. They were
burned to death, the soldiers preventing
anybody Irom escaping from the burn
ing building.
'The chiel of the village of Cheneg was
captured by the soldiers and bound to
his two daughters. All tliree were then
scalded to death with boiling water. A
detachment of twenty-five regulars of
the Turkish cavalry after committing in
expressible horrors at tho village of
Sebghauk, went to the village school
and ravished the girls found there, and
then devastated the building.
lho Boy, the notorious Kurd brigand
of the village of Djibran, and a Colonel
in the regular army, went with a detach
ment of Turkish troops to the villages of
Bahlou, Hatezgent and Komoka, and at
each place committed every crime there
is to commit. Alter driving out the mon
they collected the female children of
Bahlou together, about -.00 iv all, and,
after ravishing them, killed them all
with guns aud swords. Alter this massa
cre the Turkish soldiers regaled them
selves with wine and whatever else they
could find in the village.
The Kurdish regular troops Kizan and
Bahran entered the Armenian villages of
Allanozig and Aghleg, killed the inhabit
ants and wrecked their houses.
The number of villages devastated in
this manner is said to be over thirty-two.
The Armenians lied in every direction!
but many of them were captured by the
Turkish troops before they could g«t
away, and were taken to prison.
Khadijak. who was the principal spokes
man lor the Armeniau refugees, told the
whole story in a most convincing man
ner.
Dr. G. Thoumain, a well-known Aruie- <
nian. has just received a letter written on
September 2Mb from Todorian, a villago
near Erzeroum. The writer says: '-flow
can I write such horrors of our life for
the days since the 14th. Mounted rob
bers rode up to this village an hour after
sunset, and immediately began an indis
criminate attack upon the Armenian in
habitants. Over 2.0 shots were tired at !
the house ofthe Rev. Mr. Zookia, pastor
of the Protestant community, who was
| absent from Erzoroum. Three balls
struck the pastor's wife in the face. She
subsequently died from the effects of her
wounds. Some poor peoplo from Khuoos,
who were living in the basement of the
pastor's hurried up-stairs when the tiring
was going on, and all of them were
wounded. Mr. Kichardsou, an Amer
ican missionary, came from Erzeroum to
attend the tuueral of tho pastor's wife.
On September 25th a band of robbers
committed murder at Andag and carried
oil' cattle. At Dody they broke into
houses aud plundered thorn of their con
tents."
Dr. Thou main was formerly a pro
fessor at the American college of Marso
van, and has himself beeu the victim of
cruel persecution at the hands of tho
Turks in lfei'.'3, when serious disturb
ances occurred in various parts of Ar
menia, aud scores of innocent Christian
people were thrown into prison and tho
Christian college burned. On repre
sentations made to the Turkish Govern
ment by the Department of state ol the
United States Dr. Thoumain was par
doned.
A KMKNIANS STAIIT THK REVOLT.
Washington, Dee. 3.—The Turkish
Legation to-day furnished the Associatod
Press with an official telegram received
by the Minister from Turkey relative to
the trouble in Armenia. He says it has
be^n ascertained that the agitators, origi
nally from Konmanis and Greece, and re
cruited in the Caucasus, took an import
ant part in the Sassouu rebellion. It was
tho Armenians of the Talourie district
who started the revolt, attacking Mussel
man villages. Troops were immediately
sent, who never employed more than
BSVsnty or eighty Kurds. The facts show
that far from committing auy cruelties,
the regular troops succeeded iv restoring
peace aud order. Further proof that thore
was no persecution of any sort is the fact
that peaceful Armenian villages, not par
taking of tho revolutionary movement,
were left in perfect security and unmo
lested.
IM POUT ANT MINING SUIT.
Action in nn Idaho Case Transferred
to the U. S. Supreme Court.
Washington, Dec. '".-— The action of
the l'nited States Supreme Court ln
granting the application of the Fast
Chanco Mining Company for a writ of
certiorari in the case of The Fast Chance
Mining Company vs. The Tyler Mining
Company w ni have the ellect of transier
ing to this court a litigation which has
attracted much attention in Idaho the
past live years.
The case is important, not because of
the large values in. dyed, but because ol
the questions in mining law which aro
raised, the moat consequential being as
to the rights of raining claimants tc fol
low their ledges beyond the lines
of their claims iuto the claims of
tiieir neighbors. Tiio 'iyler Company
demanded the right to follow its ledges
beyond vertical lines into Fast Chance
territory, and brought suit to enjoin Iho
latter company from taking out ore
which, whilo within its territory, was
within a ledge having its apex in the
Tyler claim.
The case has been tried in several States
and tho Federal Courts. This last de
cision was by the Circuit Court ol Ap
peals for tho Ninth Circuit, which sus
tained tho contention of the Tyler Com
pany.
Ordinarily the decisions of the Circuit
Court oi Appeals are final, but tho Su
preme Court has an option on reviewing,
which tho Circuit Court has now decided
to do in tho case. Tno Tyler Company
claims the ownership of "*_*uo,ooo worth of
ore extracted by the Bast Chance Com
pany, while the latter slates it has ex
pended ¥700,066 in the development of ore
bodies now claimed by tho Tyler Com
pany, and nad expended f_00,600 In their
development before auy claim was made.
STEAMSHIP I'KOIi.M'.IA LOST.
Collided With Another Vessel and
Thought to Have Foundered.
London, Dec. 3.—The steamer Albort
ino, from Shields to this port, arrived at
Yarmouth to-day with her bow com
pletely stove in and leakiug badly. Hor
commander reported that she was in col
lision yesterday with a largo passenger
sjteamer. The Albertiuo struck the
steamer amidships, and the latter disap
peared in tho fog which enveloped that
part of the coast all day yesterday. The
Albortine, in spite of her damaged condi
tion, returned to the point where the col
lision occurred and searched for the ves
sel with which she had collided, but no
trace of the steamer could be found, aud
it is supposed she foundered.
A life buoy aud four hatches marked
"Konmore" were washed ashore near
Yarmouth to-day. Tho steamship Ken
more loft Shields on -November lsth for
Carthagena. Several other collisions of
small steamers are reportod.
"WESTEKN RALLROAJDB
Fail to Make Progress ln tho Settle
ment of Their Differences.
CHICAGO, Dec. 3.—The transcontinental
lines have so far failed utterly iv making
any progress which will lead to a settle
ment that will enable all of the Western
roads to got together in one agreement.
Another general meeting of all lines is
slated, but it is dillicult to see how it can
amount to anything so long as tho trans
continental lines have agreed on nothing
tending to stop the demoralization in
their territory.
The Western roads held a short meeting
to-day to consider tho question of remov
ing tbeir order from Eastern territory.
The Bock Island has already taken its
orders out, but some of the other lines,
notably tho Alton, do not see their way
clear to lollow tho load. Nothiug definite
was decided upon.
Third Vice-President Truesdale ofthe
Elock island has assumed the duties of
General Manager of tho system, because
of tiio resignation of Mr. St. John.

TIIE CONSPIRACY CASES.
Sensation Created lv tho United statos
District Court.
San Francisco, Dec. 3. —A sensation
was created this morning in the United
] States District Court, before which Mayne
: and Cassidy, American Bailway Union
men, are on trial for conspiracy.
Attorney Monteith, their counsel, for
mally moved to have United states Dis
trict Attorney Carter and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Samuel Knight removed
' irom tbeir positions as prosecutors in
: the case, on tho ground of mas and undue
j irioudiinos*-. for the Southern Pacific Rail
road Conipany. Two aliidavils by tho
I defendants were Introduced.
It is charged tbat, through all the recent
j strike trouble, the District Attorney and
i his assistants conspired with tue Southern
' I'acitic ollicials, and that they took such
unwarranted action on behalf of the raii
road interests and became so biased that
the conviction of the mon now on trial is
essential to tho vindication of tue District
Attorney.
lt is further chargod that the District
Attorney and his assistant have a per
sonal interest in suppressing evidence on
i bobali of the accused men, and that when
the matter was under investigation be
lore the United States Grand Jury the
District Attorney'sinlluenco was wrong
fully used to prevent the Grand Jury
from hearing material evidence on bo
half ofthe strikers.
It is also charged that District Attorney
Garter owes nis appoint•__-£_.t to me late

HATCH TRIAL.
I>ofc*ndauir*s Mother Placed on the
"Witness Stand.
Woopi.anp, Dec. 3.—The Hatch case
was resumed to-day. Several witnesses
testified as to Hatch's previous good
character, and as to the time he was last
seen on the day ol" July 11th.
Gonoral Hart's method of questioning
B. H. Buckingham, one of his own wit
nesses, brought out many objections from
Attorney Cook, whicn were sustained by
the court.
(.eueral Hart wanted witness to state
positively when ho had last seen Hatch
on July 11th, but witness would only say
"About three-quarters of au hour before
the train went out."
The defendant's mother was the last
witness. Mrs. Hatch's testimony was to
the ellect that she had married twenty
one years ago, and that her son was not
of age.
Attorney Cook tried to prove that
young Hatch had sworn falsely w ben he
said he was tweuty-oue years of ago when
ho procured his marriage license. This
brought Geuoral Hart to his foet with an
objection, which was sustained by the
court.

for the Second Time.
Tacoma, Dec. 3.—The Tacoma Xational
Bank, which closed its doors during the
panic of July __", 1898, and reopened on
December f*th, closed again to-day. Its

mit it to go into liquidation. At the timo
of the Baring failure its deposits

pended iv 1893 its liabilities had been re
duced to 1510,000. When it closed to-day

MURDERER HEALY.
Believed to be Implicated Iv Another
Cold-Blooded Crlmo.
Los Angei.es, Dec. 3.—lt is highly
probable that L. T. Healy, one of the self
confessed murderers of Camille Kiikan
at Long Beach, will havo lo answer to
another murder charge, this time in com
pany with a certain well-known young
man now in Long Beach. It will be re
membered that after the cold-blooded
murder of John Hawkins, the Wilming
ton baker, on the night of April l'Uh last,
; many clews were followed to intercept
I the criminals, but at the time wero uu-
successful. Since the arrest of Healy and '
Feeler much startling evidence has beeu !
found, and the oilicers now firmly believe
that they are on the right trail aud that
the crime can be fastened ou Healy.

ing the State Treasurer from making pay
ment of salaries of Supervisors of Elec

LONO AND UNINTKRi:sTIM*.
Louisville (Ky.), Dec. 3.—The Cou

almost as uninteresting aa it is long.
Asido from tbe indorsement and synopsis
of Secretary Carlisle's plan for currency
reform, with one or two other recom
mendations, tlie message has but little
oiher significance than attaches ton clock
like condensation of the various depart
mental reports. In this respect it is very
different Irom some of the preceding
messages of Mr. Cleveland.
A DKNVER EDITOR'S OPINION.
Denver, Dec. d.— The Republican
(Bep.) will comment ou the President's
message to-morrow as lollows: In July,
1893, when I'resident Cleveland, at the
dictation of tiio money power, and in ac
cordance with sn evident agreement with
the English Government, called thn
Fifty-third Congress together in special
session to repeal tlie purchasing clause ot
the Shermau law, ho boldly declared iv
his call that its repeal was ail tbat wm
necessary to restore prosperity in this
country. He accomplished his purpose
by tho coercion of tbe cuckoos of his own
party, by bulldozing and a shrewd uso of
tho patronge of his otlice, but although
ho has made many public utterances since
that time, he has never taken occasion to
notify tho country that his prophesy re
garding tho best method of secur
ing a return of prosperity iias
beon fulfilled. The reason is ob
vious. Tho times have grown worse
instead of betier since tho repeal biil
passed in tho fall of 1893, and even Presi
dent Clovclaud does not possess tiie hard
ihood to attempt to justify that stupend
ous criminal blunder.
CONDITIONS OF PEACE.
Japan Would Accept 100,000,000 Yen
and a Cession ot Territory.
Yokohama, Dec. 3.—According to tho
semi-official press Japan has decided to
insist upon heavy conditions of peace,
which wili bo increased as tho war is pro
longed. If tiio war is concluded now
Japan would accept _00,000,000 yens and
the cession of the territory now occupied
by her forces. If Toku and Shan Hai
Kwan cannot be attacked this winter be
cause of the climate, and war will be
pushed to other parts ot China. No ar
tnistice is to ba granted, unless China
formally sues for peace and surrenders
Pekin, or gives other pledges in propor
tion to tho demand of Japan. It must bo
stipulated that Japan's powor is absolute.
The war now in progress between
China and Japan has roudorod it neces
sary or expedient to dispatch eight ves
sels to those waters,
