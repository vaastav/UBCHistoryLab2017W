NATIONAL PARANOIA.
The committee on public Information
at Washington has been compiling a
comprehensive lot of evidence showing
tlif spirit and alms of the Ian-Oerman-Ists.
In Its report on "Conquest and
Kultur," we find Prusslanlsm blandly
admitting Its merits after (liis fashion:
liernhardl expunds the theme: "We
!ermans have a fur greater and more
urgent duty toward civilization to per
form than the great Asiatic power.
We can onjy fulfill It by the sword."
A Herman manual for school children
declares that "Uermuny's mission In
history-is to rejuvenate the exhausted
members of Europe by a diffusion of
(iermun blood."
"We feel ourselves to be the beurers
of a superior kultur," announces the
kaiser's pastor. "Germany" says an
other pastor, "is now about to become,
mentally and morally, the first nution
of the world."
Says Adolph lesson, a distinguished
professor of philosophy: "Either one
must consider Germany as the most
perfect political creation that history
has known, or must approve her de
struction, her extermination. We are
morally and intellectually superior to
all. without peers. It is the same with
our organizations and with our Institu
tions.
And so on, to the point of nauHPa or
incredulity.

Political Observations.
It's the knitters, not the plcketers,
who are winning the ballot for women.
Six states will vote on prohibition
next year California, Nevadu, Minne
sota, Wyoming, Missouri nnd Florida
even If the federal amendment should
not be submitted.
Governor Gardner's declaration for
woman suffrage will no doubt prove
very heartening to Missouri women who
are about to make another appeal for
the ballot to the electorate of the state.
Notwithstanding his. repeated asser
tion that he will not be a candidate for
any office after his term of governor
expires, a strong effort will be made to
Induce Governor Gardner of Missouri
to seek the Democratic nomination for
United States Senator.
Pennsylvania Republicans are at
preeent at loggerheads and the Demo
crats are preparlnn to take advantage
of the situation In an effort to win
political control of the state. However,
the Pennsylvania Republicans are well
disciplined, and after a family row re
unite easily. When united they are In
vincible, showing several hundred thou
sand to the good In presidential years,
and especially when the tariff Is an
issue. The word protection acts like
magic on them.
Disloyalty got another wallop at the
polls at the recent election for commis
sioners In Newark, N. J., notwithstand
ing the city's large foreign descended
population. One of the candidates was
Benedict Prieth. editor of a Germun
American newspaper. At the tune oi
his candidacy he was under Indictment
for treason by a federal grand Jury and
wus out on bail awaiting trial. Plieth
made an active campaign for election
the disloyalty Issue being clearly drawn,
but he was badly defeated.
There Is a whisper that Colonel
Roosevelt's friends are of the opinion
that he could wrest the Republican
nomination for governor of New York
from Governor Whitman, e elected,
and thus dominate In his own behalr
the next Republican national conven
tion. No boom for him has as yet
been launched, but there is time. It
will be remembered that he was gover
nor of New York when nominated for
vice-president, and it was through the
vice-presidency he reached the White
House.
Senator Thomas W. Hardwick of Geo
rgia, one of the senators who has op
posed almost ull legislation recommend
ed by the president, and whose votes
and speeches have given aid and com
fort to the country's enemies, is to have
opposition in the coming primaries.
William J. Harris, chairman of the fed
eral trade commission, and one of the
strongest friends of the president. It is
said, will resign his federal office in
order to dispute the senatorial Issue
with Hardwick. and that he will have
the sympathy and support of the presi
dent. If the big men of the political parties,
and not the petty politicians, have their
way. polities will be sulwidinated to pa
triotism in -the coming congressional
campaign. It has been uuggesieo. inui
nnmri-pHsman with a clean record
of hearty support of the president and
the war should be re-elected, regardless
.... Tho whose records are not
clean, or are even doubtful, should be
beaten, again without regard u pun.
If It is necessary in any districts for
Republicans and Democrats to combine
on a war candidate, they should by all
means do It. There should lie no
thought of the elections this year as in
fluencing the result or tne eiecuon mu
years later.

WILLIAM K. CHANDLKR.
St. Louis Globe-Uemocrat: Although
holding a great variety of offices and
having done much constructive service
as secretary of the navy under Presi
dent Arthur as to win the proud title
of "Father of the American Navy,"
William E. Chandler was most popu
larly known as un Insurgent. A few
years ago a Washington correspondent
quoted Chandler's son as saying to a
companion, as the veteran walked away
with an elastic step that belied his
years, "there go.-s an honest seeker
after trouble."
He lived at a time and under circum
stances that gave abundant exercise
for his controversial proclivities. Grad
uating from the Harvard law school In
1N54, at the age of 19, he was soon re
porter for the supreme court of New
Hampshire. He was speaker of the
house at 27. He served as solicitor and
Judge advocate g-neral of the navy, as
assistant secretary of the treasury,
four terms as member of the New
Hampshire house, as secretary of the
navy, as member of two state consti
tutional conventions, fourteen yeurs as
United States senator and seven years
as a member of the , Spanish war
claims commission. He was one of the
most ardent advocates of radical rail
way regulation, and ascribed his retire
ment from the senate to "undue influ
ence of railroads in New England poll
tics," a theme on which he ever after
harped. But this subject by no means
monopolized his attention, for he al
ways hud a few burbed wordslfor all
the men and causes that happened to
win his displeasure.
After spending a normal lifetime
largely in public affairs, ne en;ered the
piactice of law at the age of 73, an al
most unprecedented . undertaking, but
he succeeded. Even after he was 80
the vigor and alertness of his intellect
made his associates' marvel. There
was something refreshing even In his
asperities and eccentricities.
