MR. TAFT OS DISFRANCHISEMENT.
President-elect Taft has won the re
spect of the southern people by talking
very plainly to them in the discussion
of certain political and social condi
tions peculiar to the section south of
Mason and Dixon's line. In his tour
of the south before election he was
bluntly frank In his suggestion that
the southern people seek a divorce
from the old question of race, preju
dice and begin planning to vote In ac
cordance with their Judgment and
their best political Interests. He re
peated this advice in an address at a
reunion of North Carolinians In, New
York the other night, when he clearly
defined his attitude on the plans being
tried in southern states to secure the
disfranchisement of the negro. In the
course of his address Mr. Taft said:
In all the southern states It Is possible
ty election laws proscribing proper quali
fications for the suffrage which sqjare
with tho flftenth amendment, and which
shall bo equally administered as between
he black and white races, to prevent en
tirely the possibility of a domination of
southern state, county or municipal gov
crnmenta by an Ignorant electorate, white
or black. The sooner such laws,
when adopted, are applied with exact
equality and Justice to the two races the
hotter for the moral tone of state and
community concerned.
This is a clear recognition of the
right of each state to fix its own
qualifications for voters. On this
proposition there is no room for ar
gument,, but Mr. Taft makes It plain
that he is not In favor of the repeal
of the fifteenth amendment and la
strongly opposed to discrimination
against the negro solely because he Is
a negro. If the south wants to keep
the Illiterate negro from voting, it may
do so by applying an educational test
that would make ignorance, rather
than color, a bar to the franchise
privilege. The election laws now on
the statute books of many of the
southern states make a pretense of
such a test now, but they are in
variably framed to operate as a dis
crimination In favor of the illiterate
white voters, who are practically as
numerous as illiterate negro voters In
some of the southern states. Every
state has the right to make laws that
will proscribe the venal and the il
literate, provided that all venal and
illiterate are placed on the same foot
ing. THE COLONIAL TRADE.
Flgurea furnished the federal bureau
of trade statistics show a marked and
gratifying Increase in the trade be
tween the United States and its colo
nial possessions. The statistics are
for the ten months of the present
calendar year and Indicate a volume
of business much larger than bad
been expected or thought possible by
students of trade conditions.
When the Philippines came under
the control of the United States ten
years ago, it was predicted that it
would be halt a century before the
people of the islands were advanced
sufficiently to have demands for any
considerable amount of such goods as
would be naturally expected to be Im
ported from the United -States. The
progress of the Filipinos has been
demonstrated by the fact that, al
though several years were required to
restore order In the islands, the ex
ports of that country now amount to
almost $1,000,000 a month, being in
excess of $8,000,000 for the ten
months, and growing larger every
month. Hawaii, while the smallest of
the colonies, has been the most liberal
buyer of American products, our ex
ports for the ten months amounting to
$40,500,000, as compared -with $22,
665,000 to Porto Rico, $10,500,000
to Alaska and $8,4 50,000 to the Philp-
pines.
The 'American exports to Hawaii
comprised ljreadstuffs.'iron, steel, cot
ton cloth, mineral oils and manufac
tured wood and tobacco, in return for
which we bought a alr share of the
Hawaiian sugar '. crop. We bought
sugar, tobacco and fruits from Porto
R'ico and sent that country rice, pro
visions, breadstuffs and manufactured
Iron and steel. We Imported sugar
and hemp from the Philippines and
sold them iron, breadstuffs, cotton
and mineral oil. Alaska sent salmon,
copper and furs to the United States
and bqught liberally of cottons, woolen
goods, manufactured iron and steel,
tobacco, breadstuffs, meats, liquors
and wines.
Altogether, the trade with our non
contiguous territories is Increasing
most rapidly and promises, with the
development of those countries, to
have a potent effect on the eommer-.
cial Industrial enterprises of the
United States.
THE NEBRASKA BUDGET.
Just at present the incoming admin
istration is concerning itself very
largely with the needs of the institu
tions in Nebraska and is planning for
the continuation of the careful man
agement that has effected marked
economies during the last two years.
So far Governor-elect Shallenberger
bas shown no disposition to interfere
seriously with the control of the sev
eral Institutions maintained at the
state expense, and it is reasonable to
presume that whatever step he takes
In this direction will be carefully con
sidered before it is made. Giving the
governor and the leglblature credit in
advance with a desire, at least, to di
rect the affair of the state of Ne
braska Jn such a way aa will aecure
the maximum of effictency'wlth a min
imum of expense, it may not be out of
place to suggest some of the extraor
dinary expenditures the incoming leg
islature will be asked to provide for.
The most important of these Is the
step that must be taken to secure a
more commodious and appropriate rap
Itol building for Nebraska. The pres
ent structure is little short of a dis
grace. In appearance and accommoda
tions It la not fit to house th govern-
merit of a great and wealthy state, and
while it may be possible to stow away
the several departments of state gov
ernment under its roof for another to
years or four years, it Is equally cer
tain that the new building must come.
This will be the greatest duty, per
haps, that will devolve on the new leg
islature. Another extraordinary expense will
be the making of proper provision for
the National Guard of Nebraska. The
amount of money now expended by
the state on its citizen soldiers is piti
fully Inadequate. Only by the most
strenuous effort and the greatest of
personal sacrifices on the part of offi
cers and men has the guard been main
tained at a point where it would pass
muBter and come' within the purview
of the national law. In Omaha and
Lincoln the work of keeping up the
guard has been especially difficult,
owing to the great expense for "main
taining suitable quarters. Governor
Sheldon has expressed himself ns being
favorable to the erection of armory
buildings throughout the state, but es
pecially in the larger cities, where they
are so greatly needed. These two
items will constitute the most pressing
needs aside from the requirements of
the established institutions, and de
serve the earnest consideration of Governor-elect
Shallenberger and the leg
islature. A'EIF STA1ES AND THE SENATE.
The effort that will be made to pass
a bill at the present session of con
gress admitting New Mexico and Ari
zona to statehood is scheduled for very
considerable opposition, despite the fact
that the party' is pledged by Its plat
form to such legislation, that Presi
dent Roosevelt has recommended it
and that Mr. Tnft is strongly in favor
of it. It is reported from Washing
ton that if the statehood bills are not
passed at this session, Mr. Taft will
ask for statehood In the message he
will send to extra session to convene
in March.
The opposition to the proposed legis
lation is personal and political on the
part of the senators from some of the
New England Btates. It will mark
their final stand against loss of their
dominating part in senate affairs. For
many years a coterie of New England
and eastern senators has practically
directed the work of that body. Their
domination was largely responsible for
the delay In the admission of Okla
homa and Indian Territory and their
final admission as one state, instead
of two. This eastern, clique objected
to the admission of the territories as
separate states, as that would add four
western senators to the body and in
crease the power of the western mem
bers who were fighting, against east
ern opposition, for forest reserves, ir
rigation and the advancement of in
terests in which the west has a 'deep
concern. It was this same spirit that,
when the admission of Oklahoma and
Indian Territory could no longer be
denied, defeated the admission of New
Mexico and Arizona by insisting that
they come in as one state. The bill
providing for such Joint statehood was
passed by congress, but the territories
both rejected it.
It is hardly probable that the east
ern members will be able to longer
prevent the admission of New Mexico
and Arizona. The combination has
lost Its dominating control. The
deaths of Senator Hoar and of Sena
tor Piatt of Connecticut robbed the
clique of two of Its strongest mem
bers, and its force was further seri
ously impaired by the retirement of
Senator Spooner and the death of
Senator Allison, both western men
who worked with the "conservatives"
from New England. The changes that
have been made in the senate In the
last five or six years have added
greatly to the prestige and power of
the west. The younger men have
taken a more active part and the old
leaders, from the eastern states, have
not been replaced with forceful con
servatives. On this account, while the
admission of the two territories to
statehood may be opposed, it cannot
be long postponed. Politically, the ad
mission of the territories would prob
ably add two democrats and two re
publicans to the senate, thus not dis
turbing the political complexion of the
body, but it would be of Importance
to the west by adding four votes to
the support of measures and policies
of special Interest to the west.
Secretary Mellor of the State Agri
cultural society will be pardoned for

The prospect for another year of

to constitute a boom in a less progres

Perjury la the Courts.
Philadelphia Record.
Whether the fading belief in a place
of future torment be responsible for It
or not, there Is a lamentable Increase of
perjury according to the testimony of
many trial Judges. Supreme Court Jus
tice Hendrlck of New York sent the
plaintiff In a slander case to jail In de
fault of a bond for $1,000, saying: "I
am convinced that Mobs has shamefully
perjured himself. We must atop perjury
in our courts." If men do not fear hell
as their grandfathers did, there Is all
the more necessity of making them fear
the penitentiary.;.

Basing his estimate upon the remark
able progress made by Brazil since it
became a republic, John Barrett, director
of the Bureau of American Republics,
predicts that before the end of the pres
ent century Braxll will have a popula
tion of 160,000,000 and will be one of the
greatest sources of food supplies in the
world. The -country Is larger than the
United States, and Is wonderfully rich in
natural resources. .With an Immense pop
ulation, a stable' government and a high
and varied civilisation, Brazil, even be
fore the end of the century, will be close
to the head In the rank of the great
powers. It may mean the shifting of the

Opposition to the postal savings bank,

tinues to stand on misrepresentation of the
plan. The misstatements, whether due to
Ignorance or intent, are Inexcusable. The
smaller national banks and the savings
banks are said to be opposed to the plan
because they fear government competition.
But the postal savings bank docs not dpi
template competing for funds now de
posited in existing banks. A low rate of
Interest on deposits is provided fn order
that competition . may be avoided. Tho
postal savings bank would be auxiliary to
the existing system, drawing on horded

Specimens of the Tart and Sound
Judgment of the President-elect.
"Washington I'ost (ind.).
The bearing of the rrosldcnt-elect is win
ning golden opinions from all claws and
conditions of men. In bis private and pub
lic utterances Mr. Taft Is displaying tact
and sound Judgment. In his "eloquent
flaslies of silence" his Judgment Is equally
good. He seems to have a happy faculty
for taking advanced ground and asserting
himself without arousing antagonism. Al
ready several questions of profound Im
portance, affecting his forthcoming ad
ministration, have come up for his con
sideration, and he has disposed t them In
such manunrr ns to reveal elements of
strength which had not been disclosed dur
ing the campaign. No one who knows Mr.
Taft was in doubt as to his possession of
this strength, but his easy exercise of
mastery over situations as they arise Is
a gratifying assurance that the next presi
dent. Uko the rresent one, will be himself,
solely, the president of tho United States.
One of the little incidents showing Mr.
Taft's spirit was his refusal to bo mode
an honorary member of the Red Cross so
ciety. Ho is an active member, and be
Intends to remain active. He has accepted
the. presidency of tho society, and doubt
less he wjll find time to serve faithfully
In that position to Its great advantage. It
would have been ensy for tho president
elect to shirk tho duty which he bad pre
viously performed, and the press of greater
duties would have been a sufficient ex
cuse. But It was not In his nature to shirk
a task once assumed, nor Is ho so dazzled
by his honors as to becomo blind to humb
ler things.
Every day that brings Mr. Tnft nearer
to th presidency serves to sharpen and
solidify tho Impression he makes upon
the publlo mind. The people are more and
rgoro Impressed with the fact that here
Is a real man, who Is to do great things
In a great way. . And the people do not
forget that President Roosevelt precelved
tho true quality of Mr. Tnft long ago,
and did his best to place him where he
could serve his country tho best. Here
after, when the account is reckoned up.
It Is probable that the historian will note
with amazement the fact that Theodore
Roosevelt was criticised for preferring Wil
liam II. Taft abova all others for his suc
cessor. Peril In the Itnllot.
Philadelphia Press (rep.).
In Iowa, at the recent election, tho re
publican elector-at-largo heading tho list
received 8,852 more votes than the second
elector-at-large, and the district electors
showed a still further falling off, tho last
elector being the greatest sufferer. The
vote for the democratic electors was on a
similar sliding scale, the first on the list
receiving 0.246 more votes than the second
candidate for elector.
With a republican majority of 75,000 this
made no difference in the result, but
had the republican majority been only 6,000
for the' highest elector of that party, the
reduction in the vote for the other electors
would have let In one or more near the top
of the list of tho democratic electors. The
republican majority of 6,000, Imperfectly
recorded under the complexities of the Aus
tralian ballot, would not have been given
full effect, because of badly marked ballots.
This Is what happened in Maryland, and
Taft loses six electoral votes there be
cause the ballots were not marked so as
to give tho republican majority Its full
weight. It has caused the election of one
republican elector to be challenged In Mis
souri. His vote, though greater than the
democratic elector for the samo district, is
less than that counted for the highest
democratlc-eleetor-at-large. , Tho question
whether that vote shall ho counted for
Taft or for Bryan will probably be carried
to congress. If the result of t'ho election
turned pn that ono vote the conditions
would be present for an acrimonious and
bitter controversy and a disputed succes
sion to the presidency.
The evil of tho present method Is fully
demonstrated at a time and In a manner
which makea Its cure possible without rais
ing any partisan questions. The voting of
both parties .Is confused and falsified by
the present method. The majority does not
rule when accurate marking and not plain
intention determines the election. There
Is danger In the present method, which
elementary statesmanship and common
prudence should cause to be removed.
An Astonishing? Confession.
New York World (dem.).
Mr. Bryan in a Commoner editorial on
"The Growth f Socialism" warns the re
publicans that "they may boast of their
victory," but that "just as the populist
party grew until It compelled consideration
of the abuses that led to Its organization,
so the Socialist party will grow until it
forces those at the head of the government
to look into the wrongs that are done
and to apply remedies."
What an astonishing confession of demo
cratic Impotence under the Bryan leader
ship! It is the democratic opposition that
should compel the party In power "to look
Into the wrongs that are done and to apply
remedies." That Is what an opposition is
for. Yet Mr. Bryan surrenders this func
tion to the socialists, apparently convinced
that the great democratic party is power
less to do its own work.
The socialists at leant do not support
republican measures and pose as "heirs to
my policies." They stick to their princi
ples. When the democratic party begins
to stick to its principles and nominate only
democrats for office there will be no oc
casion for Mr. Bryan or anybody else to
glorify socialism as the effective opposi
tion to republican mlsgovernment.
The XfW Political South.
Boston Herald (rep.).
Mr. Taft believes in the new south poll
tics as well as in the industrial activity.
The incongruity of the commercial aspira
tions of that section of the country and
Its bondage to political prejudices is be
coming more apparent each year of Its de
velopment The purpose of the president
elect to shape the policies of his adminis
tration, bo far as they relate to the po
litical situation in The south, to the end
that sectional divisions may be eliminated
is of more than partisan Interest. The
passing ot the solid south will be a step
toward national unity and welfare, the
Impotepee of which will not be measured
by the gain of .congressional seats or of
electoral votes by any party.
Just Enough Harmony.
Springfield Republican (lnd.).
The harmony conference between Mr.
Taft and Speaker Cannon looks like the
prelude to another of those amazing ex
hibitions of "get together" which the re
publican party has grown fat on, and which
are the despair of the storm-tossed
and distracted democracy. Harmony Just
enough, but not too much has become the
finest of the political fine arts, as practiced
by the national republican party of our
time. .

parishioners. The reverend doctor ssys
he has forbidden the use cf trees or ever
greens In his church this holiday season,
lie even goes so far as to denounce the
ie of these as a beathen custom that
ought to be discontinued.
"How came we to adopt this custom,
which Is one of the many taken from the
heathen?" asked Dr. MacArthur. "We are
deforesting many portions of our state and
country. We ought to save ths trees to
prevent floods and to give ths proper
amount of shade. To do my share In the
work, I have forbidden the purchase of
evergreen trees by this church for the
coming holidays."
So the doctor In his reasoning works
around from the heathen to the forest pres
ervationabolish the Christmas trees and
save the forests. This Is rather farfetched.
For every treo that is cut down to make
Christmas greens the ax of the lumberman
slays a thousand. The holly with Its pretty
berries, the cedar with Its rich green leaves,
must, of course, be preserved to Rive pleas
ure to the future generations aa thoy have
to ours. But they are here for us to use
and to enjoy and why shouldn't we use
thi'm?
The forces that are destroying our forests
are not the Christmas tree hunters. They
are the greedyi lumber speculators, who
sweep a tract clean of big trees, and In
place of the forest leave denuded lands
that will wash away, and furnish a drain
to feed the floods that carry destruction
down the rivers. Perhaps more care should
be exercised in cutting holly and cedar and
mistletoe, in order that the growth may
not be destroyed; but this Is so small a
part of forest destruction that it does seem
we might be allowed our evergreens for the
holidays.
Abolish the Christmas tree? Not while
the houses hold troops of merry children
that look forward with eager eyes to ths
little tree in the parlor that, with its hun
dred lights and gifts, looks like a bit of
fairyland. Not while the oldest of us al
most bear the stamping of tho reindeers
and the jingle of tho sleighbells. Abolish
tho Christmas tree? Not while It lights
up the happy home with Its glowing
tapers; not so long ns It Is the sign and
sybol of the season of good cheer and
merriment; not so long as bright-faced
children stand around it with glowing
faces, radiant with the happiness it brings
Abolish the Christmas tree? You might
as well stop the sleigh, unharness tho rein
deers, confiscate the toys, shave off Santa
Claus' beard, and send him back home to
lead the lonely life of a crusty old bachelor,
Parson, spare that tree; It would be well to
pause before you fight the million friends
of Mr. Santa Claus.
AMRRICA.V TROOPS I CUBA.
Plan of Gradual Withdrawal Con
sidered a Wise One.
Cleveland Plain Dealer.
There will be general concurrence In the
wisdom of the plan announced at Washing
ton for the gradual, instead of instant,
withdrawal of American troops from Cuba
at the expiration of the American occupa
tion. It had been known for some time
that both Provisional Governor Magoon and
President-elect Gomes thought it wise that
some of the troops should remain on the
Island after the new government assumed
control, but each for obvious reasons hes
itated to mako the overt suggestion. Now
the authorities at Washington have acted
In accordance with their opinion.
Conditions on the Island appear at tho
present time tranquil 'and without definite
suggestion of hidden dangers, yet enough
is known of the Cuban character to make'
this seeming quiet no adequate Indication
of what might transpire within a few weeks
If the American soldiers were withdrawn
from the island when the new president
assumes office. Gomez has reason to sus
pect the loyalty of some of his more prom
inent followers, even of some of those who
for the sake of policy went upon his ticket
and were carried Into office with him. A
brand new revolution following the inaugu
ration of the new government would be
regrettable from every worthy standpoint
and If the continued presence of the Amer
ican soldiers will discourage such an un
happy development the precaution would
be well worth while.
In the adoption of the new policy of with
drawing the troops President Roosevelt
recedes from his former position of Insist
ing that the work of the United States on
tbe Island should be completed before he
leaves office In March. When he first an
nounced his Intention of thus withdrawing
completely from Cuba before the end of
his term . objections were raised that the
time was too short. It was supposed, how
ever, that he would persist. ,

That wily purveyor to the whims nnd
humors of the times, Minister Wu Ting
fang, originally of China, but at present of
all creation, says that meat causes crime.
The governor of this state la assured that
It is horse racing that makes the trouble.
Defeated Candidate Swallow will have It
that demon rum is the author and finisher
of most improved brands of crime. Dr.
Parkhurst places crime upon a feminine
foundation, and Commodore Oerry finds
youth full of opportunity. Anthony Cora
stock holds all nature as a crime and hu
man nature as the crimest crime of the
lot. Every man to his own choice, although
It appears that Minister Wu, with his
simple declarative, meat. Is perhaps nearer
the fundamentality of crime In tho abstract
than any of the American specialists.
Meat may cause crime. But it is lament
ably on record that the lack of meat causes
crime also. Not a great deal of crime Is
committed on a full stomach, and when
prices are high, prosperity low, soup
kitchens are plentiful and honest work
scarce we usually enjoy what the pseudo
therapetlstlo psychologists call a "crime
wave." Personally we Incline to the opinion
that more than anything else, opportunity
causes crime.
The South and the Party,
Charleston News and Courier (dem.).
Has It occurred to our friends in the
south who are making such a stir about the
failure of the democratic party In recent
years how much they have had to do In
fact with this failure? Take the last four
presidential elections, for example. Is the
southern democracy less responsible for tns
failures which have attended the party con
tests than their northern confederates? It
seems to us that the first thing the south
ought to try to do is to save Itself from
Itself. We would have been In a sorry con
dition. Indeed, during all the years of our
material uplift If It had, not been for our
political friends en the ether side of the
old sectional line.1 '

SCPPRR9SRD rATRT.
Amendment of Present l.arr la the
Interest of Progress.
Pittsburg Dispatch.
Since the United States supreme court
has decided that under our patent laws
a valuable Invention may be suppressed
by thA owner of the patent an amend
ment of the law would be In order. The
ease In which the decision wss rendered
was an action to restrain Infringement.
The defendants pleaded willingness to
pay a proper royalty on production of the
patent article, but contended It was con
trary to good publlo policy to have the
use of a valuable patent withheld from
the public.
While the supreme court did not pass
upon the public policy of such suppres
sion It ruled that It wss the obvious pur
pose of congress to confer that power.
In support of this reasoning It cited the
clause of the original lew since re
pealedrequiring the prompt develop
ment of foreign patents. In the opinion
of the court If such development of do
mestic patents had been desired It would
have been as specifically enacted.
The point now Is that If the American
people desire development. Instead of
suppression of valuable Improvements,
they must demand of congress the en
actment of a provision similar to that
of the original law affecting foreign
patents. There Is ample reason, now,
why there should be such provision.
Great corporations have arisen which
monopolize certain fields. They buy new
patents merely to prevent better device
from superseding those In which they
deal. It Is an abuse of the broad princi
ple of the encouragement of Inventive
genius by patent protection.

WORRIES JK Till:; KAHLY SHOPPER
J. M. Lewis, in Houston I'ast. '.
I took this shopping curly hunch ,
To heart this year, and went
From street to street, and store to store
Till all mycasli was spent;
I bought two dolls, two bLggles, too,
Two phonographs to sing
On, 1 am wixe, 1 have learned to
Buy two of everything!
I had a splnerola, and
A gyroscopic top
Thai spun and spun and spun and sutUa,
As if 'twould never stop;
I had a large projectoscopa,
I had a four-wheeled cart,
I wus the goods, was the wise guy,
The big noise! I was smart!
And then I started home with them
In pockets, arms and paws,
I would have shamed a Christmas tree.
Or frightened Santa Claus;
Four blocks from horns a thought cam
Blng!"
Into the mind of me,
I'd got to sneak that load Inside
The babies mustn't seel
If they should run to meet their dad
What would their daddy dot
I fairly tiptoed from there on.
And slow my foostepa grew.
And far my eyes bulged out to see.
And geel but I was glad
To sneak those things safely inside)
Darn this year's "shop now!" fad!
For now I've got the things' at home-.
Stacked full are all the shelves
Whenever the baits looks around
We scarce can fiold ourselves,
For fear she may espy some thing
From Its concealment poke I
Oh, we have got our shopping dons.
But life now Is no Jok '
