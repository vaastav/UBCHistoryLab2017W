In Advance of the Constitution.
One ' of' the Abolition revolutionary
newspapers, in referring to the Emancipa
tion Proclamation, pats Lincoln on the
shoulder in the following atyle : It says
of hint:1 .... ,..
"Jl cast! loose from all political entangle-
menu and than the moulbe of all partisan
caviller, by taking a ate 4a enhance of the
constitution and drawing the nrord to defend
it tie attack) only rebellion; he make wnr
upon no institutions and no political or social
rights. Ha presents to treason the alter
native of nabmiatioo or puniahrnetit, not by
the law, but by the sword.''
Not by the law, but by tho sword ;"
that's the idea. Mr. Lincoln has cut the
gordian knot ; he has crossed the Rubicon;
he baa advanced, beyond the constitution,
and drawn the sword to defend his posi
tion. By usurpation he presents the al
ternative of submission or punishment.
By an act of treason to the government he
proposes to punish treason. - Both being
traitors, it is only a question of brute force
between them-t-the strongest must con
quer and the weakest must yield. ' It is no
longer a cohtest for Union, constitution or
government of any kind, but a gladiator
ial struggle for supremacy, to be decided
not by the law but by the swonl. For
this conflict Mr. LitroLS, by the voice of
his partisans,- is no longer - President he
waa only President tinder the constitution
-but having taken a step in 1 advance of
the constitution and draw the sword to de
fend it. ha has abandoned the government,
and is now only . the big bully uf the
crowd. ' " ..
JQTThere is no word in tho Luglibh
language which has bceu more abused thuu
the term loyol. It is a good, honest word,
meaning faithful aud true, sincere and con
sistent. It is a catholic word not a sec
tional, sectarian or party designation ; it
expresses frank, bold and open' adherence
to principle not a blind devotion ot ser
vile submission to power, A loyal uihu is
notlieCefsaTfly a loyalist to fie lrfjTrl' is
to be true to himself, true to his obligation
to tivialiows, to society aud to his tiouu
try ; the loyalist is simply an adherent of
kingly power, and may be false to every
principle which governs tho truly loyal
man. The distinction between the two par
ties at the present time is that between the
loyal and the loyalists the one believing
they have fullfield all their obligations to
the government when they have met ull
the requirements of the constitution nnd
the laws ; the other holding every man
disloyal who does not yield unqualified
submission and approval to the ruling
party.'-' When a man becomes a loyalist,
he parts with everjr prerogative of a soy.
ereign citizeu'and becomes a subject. Ve
belong to a party which has ever been loysl
to t,h government, but wa aire no loyalist
no blind subservient of party or power.

JEaTln looking over the bistoiy of the
war, it becomes evident that the destruc
tion of life has been beyond t any calcula
tion not based upon actim) facts. Of the
800,000 or more in tho field last full, wc
have seen no circumstantial account of the
resent condition of a regiment which rlocs
not represent it as almost annihilated. The
Milwaukee ..Vsim says of the second Wis.
consul, all that remains of the eleven hnn
drad ivhojaft Wisconsin a little more ilum
twelve months ago, are fifty-nine war-worn
and battle grtnmed-oien.' Almost every
blood stained field of Maryland and .Vir
ginia' is enriched by the bones of the dead
froto that nopls regiment. .There were tea

plausible pretext tor variance or alienation.
Ths Union was formed with a perfsct know
ledge on tbe one hand thai slavery existed at
the South, and on the other that it was utterly
disapproved anddiscounteoancedatlhe North.
Bui the frsmers ot the Constitution saw no
reason for distrust aud diasenaioo in this cir
cumstance. Wisely avoiding all discussion
of a subject so delicate and exciting, they
proceeded to the formation of a mors perfect
Union, which, leaving each section the pot
essiou of its undoubted right of regulating
its own internal Uoveruuieiil and enjoying its
own speculative opiuions, .provided only for
the comaiQB Itoelit and msiural well using ol

men t lis satis lucLart and perfect t. .YY liv should
not even ths existing evils of one section be
left to the correctioa of its own wisdom, an J
virtue, when pointed out by ths finger of ex
perience ?"
. January 28, 18C2, Mr. Greeley said :
"Speaking for ourselves we can honestly say
that, for that old Union, wkich was kept in ex
istence by Honthsrr menaces and ' Northern
concessions, we have no regrets and nrrwisb
for its reconstruction. Who wants any Union
which can o;:ly bo .preserved by Systematic
wrong and organized political hluders? Who
Wants any Union which is nothing but a senti

Seward and the Elections.
The New York Herald, In speaking of the
recent letter of Secretary Seward to the Ameri
can Minister at London, explaining the recent
elections in the Northern and Western Status,
says: ' "-i .;v-
"Mr. Secretary Seward, in bis letter to the
Hon Charles Francis Adams, our Minister at
London, explaining the elections in the loyal
States fur the Information of the English
Cabinet, .throws out the idea that these elec
tions do iiotatnoeat to much In their politic!
party results, as applied to the important quss
tions of this war. We can tell Mr. Seward,
however, that in this idea he is very wide of
the msrk, and that the late remarkable popu
lar reaction in the loyal States amounts to
nothnsj less Uiau a condemnation by the peo
ple of the way in which the war, under the
evil counsels of ths Abolition radicals, has
been mi'mnnnged down to this time. ' The
people, with the pressure : upon them of war
taxes, war prices, and a depredated shinplaa
ter currency, kc, Ac , have simply declared
that their blood and treasure must no longer
be squandered under the foolish and ruinous
instructions of the Abolition taction. Let
this faction continue, therefore, to guide the
parly in power, and next year there will be
great improvement upon thesu late elections;
and in ltf'it, with the Presidential olection,
every vestige of Abolitionism, with the domi
nant party of this day, will be swept off. Such
is the meaning of these lata Northern, elec
tions, which, Mr. Seward , unfortunately has
failed to discover."

The President's Logic.
Ths Boston Cburirr, In an article nu that
portion of the President's Message which at
tributes the cause of the war to the existence
of slavery, says: - . . i : "
"Mr. Lincoln's ingenious, though not origi
nal . obsurfatiouj that, if there had ti
o slavery there would have been no re
bellion, bos somotitneg 'been compared with
the equally logical sequence, thut if no one
travelled on the high-ways with money in his
pockets, there would be no highwaymen
The truth is, we msy begin in such a chain
of reasoning just where we ' see tit If the
world bad not been created, with various races
vpon it, of diverse characteristics, ' capacities
and dispositions ; if the necessities, or opin
ions, or prejudices of society were not such
as they are; we should have had no freesoil
party, no Chicago platform, no division among
the Democratic party, giving the opportunity
for the Republican minority to succeed, uud
Consequently, no Mr, Lincoln for President.
In tbe latter case we should, of course, have
bad no rebellion."
The Dubuque Herald.
, Said Dr. Olds to "Judge Advocate" Tur
ner :
"The Administration may persecnte me
eveu unto death, 1 am iu its power, but it
cannot take from me my hohor.or self-respect."
Thu world need Dot look further for true
heroism, for it has it here. It need uot re-in.
state Bomba in order to feel (ha heavy hand
of tyrranny, for it has it here. There are but
two figures in this picture the one, Abraham
Lincoln, or some one of tho many creatures
to whom he has delegated his own usurped
power, and his victim. The Government, em
ploying all the power legimately within its
employ, und failing iu thut overstepping lim
its which it has sworn to observe, to punish
one ol its citizens whom it does not dare to
put upon trial for any oll'ausa ; whatever.
Wrilhing under the punishment which this
betieficeiit Government is, without aggrava
tion, indicting, the victim calmly declares,
"I am in ilt puKer ; i'Iimm jtertecute me even
unto ileal h, but it cannot take away from
me my honor or my telf-respeet."
Glorious Dr. Olds. As the reculleetion of
the Administration which oppresses you shall
become a slink in the uostrils of men, your
memory rising higher in our estimation day
by day, shall prove to us a valuable exemplar
teaching us how to aut, when an nnworthy
deed is demanded from us as the price of
liberty or ease; and these words of yours,
while they shall be branded upon the forehead
of the usurpers, as the sentence of their con
demnation shall be to us apples of gold in
pictures of silver. Dubuque Jferuld.

Mormonism and Double Love.
Not long since a company of Mormon
emigrants arrived at Boston oa their way
to Ltah. Among them was noticed a young
man more distinguished in bis appearance
ttoan the remainder of the company, and
ne r fciro -two young, femalos deeply veiled,
whose delicate grace Snd reserve indicoted
them as belonging to a superior social posi
tion. Their history merits relation. Lud
wig Keroe was the son of a rich land owner
in 6woden; and the two young ladies were
two orphans who were brought op with
him in his father's family,' until he left for
College at Dou the im, where ho remained
several years, and afterwards traveling over
the greater part of Europe, his former play
mates were forgotten. ' Returning at last to
his home, ho ' was astonished to find two
beautiful women, dazzling as the Undine of
. tie was struck to the boart as with an ar
row. Love conquered him at first sight
He was in love, but with which one? Both
Were splendid! v beautiful. He was enam
ored of both. Ila was in a whirlpocl of
doubt, indecision, and perplexity. It was
necessary to come to some decision, and he
naturally came to the most droll one. In
an excess of despcrsto frankness he related
to tha two young ladies the state of his feel
ings. They laughed at him at first, then
they reflected, and the result of their re
flection was that they both loved Ludwig,
and were as embarrassed as he. About this
time ens of the Mormon; apostles, passing
through the plsoe.sought to make proselytes
to the doctrines of the riaintu, and converted
the young man and the two girls. Thus
Ludwig Feroe and biscompaiiions,Mina and
Kvohe.form a part of the Mormon emigrants
on their way to Salt Lake, where their ro
mance of love and duplication of wives will
be 8eedily divested of all charm by the low
associations sround them. ' i.
"Poor" Children.
There are philanthropic ' people in New
York, who make it their business to look af
ter the half-clad, shivering children of the
poor. ' This is all right. I propose now,
that there be another set of philanthropists
started, to look after tbe half-clad shiverme
children of the rich,, It is a novel ides, I
know, but if you jutat use your eyes as you
pass about tbe streets, you will acknowledge
that I am not so crazy after all. See the
fur-border that forms the trimming of thut
little live year old-ei's velvet coat, reaching
with a beautiful consistency, hmt tn thnealvnu
of her little bare purplo legs, with a rim of
ttiiu wnite stocking peroeptiblo just above
her fairy foot. See the jaunty little crown
of foathors and velvet perched on the very
top of ber head, leaving the entire back of
it, as well as tho red ears, exposed to the
biting cold winds. Look at the thin, white
embroidered Crock, appearing Just below the
utiia veivot coat, ana see it there is not
work hsro for a ."city missionary," as well
ss a good fouudatian laid in earlv life for
rheumatism, neuralgia, croup, and forty oth
er pleasant things most agreeable to the
medical fraternity, and undertakers general
ly. To be euro tho children of fashionable
mothers, who porpotrate such -folly, were
better, porhsps, for their own sakes, under
ground thsn above it, and thsl is the only
reason I haven't before this orgsuiaed the
philanthrypio society I have above alluded
to, for tho amelioration of thoir suffering.

Our "Turret Batteries" VS. Foreign
Intervention.
appears from a experiment that
a fifteen inch gun, charged with thirty-flvo
pounds of powder, snd a solid ball, the force
of which no marine armor at present is use
can resist, csn be fired from the turret of one
of our new first-class gunboats without pro
ducing much mora noiso inside tbe turret
than would be occasioned by the discharge
of a muket in the open air; and furthermore
that one of these enormous weapons can be
served and managed by three men ! The
idea of firing guns of a smaller bora than the
oue referred to, from Iron cupolas, was re
cently given up in Mngland, partly from fear
of the effects of the conclusion, and partly
bcrausa it was deemed impossible to crowd
into ths enclosed space a sufficient number
of men to work the pieces! '. Our transatlan

that we have overcome the -obstacles they
deemed insurmounable, and are prepared to

would under these circumstances be rather
