THE SCHOOL BOOK QUESTION,.
The text book question will undoubt- m
edly come up at the next session of the t2
state legislature with renewed energy. of
At the session two years ago it was al
one of the most interesting questions. rt
Whether the apparent interest mani- "
fested by our representatives was due
to the fact that there were rumors of O0
the ptobable expenditure of a wealth
of money by the several monopolies b
that desired to secure the contract for n
exclusively furnishing the people of the fi
state with school books at a rate that b
guaranteed them big profits, or whether ti
the representatives of the people ex
hibited this concern simply because I
they knew everybody in the state re
garded it as one of the rarasmount
qnestious of the day The Mail it u lable
to state. To be charitable, however, r
we will accept the latter as being the f
case. Already this year the agents of
the big book houses are getting things
in shape for the battle for supremacy.
It is known that in Montana we are
paying more for school1 1inks than we
shounl. vastly mn, re than is the case in
other stat(e-, and tlih olbject should be I
to get as ccl l1-,ks as p~taicc at the
lowI.t po-'sible rates. Last session the
c hlcators of the tate attenpNted to dt'e
termine which i ,k were the best and t
thev sadly dii-ur e.d when it came to
making a s'ectI, ti. In f.wt. s.me very I

. ti in that line on the school
t que;stion
\h ile discusiung the question of
,b lks for the schools of the state, there
i- another matter that might be con
-idered. and that is, whether or not it
would be a paying proposition to the
state to establish a state printing office
and to create the t dice of state printer.
In many of the states of the union this
has been done. and. we underst;rnd,
that in California they print their own
school books as well as perform all
other printing that is necessary for use
by all state oftticers. Of course, it is a
nuwstion whether M..ntana is populous
, hough to make such an undertaking
pay. and if not. The Mail would be
averse to the expenditure of public
funlds for the establishlllelt of a
<in'cure. even if it would be for a
printer.
Miss Maggie ioughtiln is spoken of
as a candidate for a deputyship under
Clerk and Recorder Daniel Arms. 'Miss
Magagie writes anl excellent hand, and
if she should receive an app. intinent
we believe she would !ill it with credit
to herself and the ccuuty as well.
REGARDING BUTTE WAGES. re
A writer, signing himself "Sub. th
scriber," in the Butte Mining World, w
takes up the wage question of Butte B
and attempts to show how it would be m
possible to operate the silver mines be
there in a cheaper manner insofar as co
wages of miners are concerned without at
affecting those of the copper miner. be
He says that this may be accomplished la
"by the contract system, such as is ai
now in vogue in the Homestake mines it
in the Black Hills in Dakota. There hi
the miners get from 80 to 90 cents per em
ton for ore broken on the sill floor and it
delivered on the cage, and from 45 to at
60 cents for ore broken in the stopes. 0'
The company furnishes timbers framed lo
at the station-the miners place them c'
- nd pay for all powder, candles, fuse, e:
and any unusual breakage on drill 8'
machines. In fact, without this sys- a
tsm, the great Homestake properties
could not operate. Again, their mills 0
are practically automatic, and in this a
respect great improvement could be P
made in our Butte mills. " h
Further on, in advancing his prop- t
osition, he remarks: e
"If the miner and mill owner could J
be induced to work hand in hand, E
many properties now idle could be ran n
full force, and no more complaint need 2
be heard of scarcity of work or hard P
times. Who will make the proposition? d
For every mine owner there is a
hundred miners, each more deeply in
terested than the capitalist. Therefore,
it should be the Miners' Union who
should take up the matter and so ar
range it that it would in no way con
flict with their interests, and at the
same time would looseu the chains that
now lock many idle stamps in MIon
tana, and the cage of every idle silver I
mine in the west." ;
The Mail cannot see how the pla t
Sui2gested could be male to work. In
Bntty l.ost of the mines carry copper I
as well a. silver. and it would be a
delicate matter t, idetturine whichi
Smine- would be allowedl t> work under
the c.mtract system and. which ones
would be compelled it pay the $d. 7
per da.y wage. If the Butte Miners"

SA'. : t all the plans are mere stepping

Stick-headed enough to be blinded by
v any such schemes. The only question
t to -t will ever come up in any definite
t -inrm will be whether or not the miners
e: : state will consent to a general
-r reduction of wages, and the prospect
- f this move is, in our opinion, buried
in the dim. distant future.

referred to in the Mining World struck
the keynote to the present problem pr
when he stated, in discussing the
Black Hills proposition, that "their j
mills are practically automatic." We wa
believe that there are many ways in All
connection with the operation of mines an
and mills where improvements could we
be added wherein a large amount of 1
labor could be saved by the addition of all
automatic contrivances as well as more Co
improved methods of reduction. We g$
hardly think that the question of We
economy in this line is studied by min- 21
ing men as it should be. Then there
are leakages of various kinds around Gr
our mines and mills that could be J.
looked into w ith profit, such as the ex- $11
cessive con.aumption of fuel, and other d
expenditures that are not nearly so es- a
sential as the payment of miners' ml
wages. to
This wage question will be worked foi
out in time by the natural condition of
affairs, and we cannot see that news- Ri
paper talk of t:e kind referred to will m
have any tendency to help matters in W
the least. The miners know just m,
exactly how things stand, and The in
Mail inclines to the belief that if the i
Butte mine owners have any talk to C
make they had netter do it with the
Miners' Union rather than with the Pt
public, as the miners are the ones most K
directly affected. m
th
A WALL STREET ECHO. of
to
President Cleveland's message to of
Congress was read last Monday. It m
has caused a great deal of comment, to
principally of an uncomplimentary f
character, except in Great Britain, ol
where it was received, generally, quite hi
favorably. If there is a man on earth
who can throw together a greater
number of wor.!l and mean and say less n'
than Grover Clc veland, he has not yet
cropped out in ::aerican politics. His ti
reference to t!e Cuban question is
I highly disapp:"'tiung to Americans:
in fact. his idea is to actually do noth
inc toward alleviating the distress on
the "Gem of the Antilles." He ad
vises the government to hold on until
so:methiuc of more importance turns
f up to warrant interference, not con
sid,.ring the attempted extermination c
,f a people ,women and children in- h
clndeo , as a sufficient cause for inter- 1
ftrence on the Dart of the greatest
lib-:rty-loving nation on earth. That f
p.part which deals with the financial
qp,,estion is but a reiteration of past f
- nessages of the President, and recom
mends the withdrawal of greenbacks i
Sanud the increase of national bank cir
1 cn:ation. In fact. the whole nlmesage
is but an echo from Wall street and
3 there is no one important topic that re
g ceives any merited recognition or
e ree )mmendation, except, possibly, that
if part which deals with the trusts and
' monopolies. The whole document can
best be summed up in the words ut
, tered by Senator Tillman. who. upon
y being interviewed regarding it, said:
"s "It is commonplace. The best thing
I about it is, that it is the last we will
11 have from that source-at least the last
in annual message."
