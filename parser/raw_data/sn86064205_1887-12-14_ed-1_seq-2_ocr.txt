Texas has 25000000 acres of the
finest public lands which will be
sold to actual bona fide settlers at
from S2 to S4 an acre on forty
years time at a low rate ofinterest
Immigration or retrogression
Let us have good county roads
Another railroad will soon reach Port
Worth
Let the dead past bury its dead and all
work for Texas now
Hon W S Pendleton seems to have
struck the key note on the county road
question
The railroads of Texas would be the
first to realize benefit from an influx of
people into the state
Tennessee has a town named Wart
race Ifyoulikeit call it Wartrace If
not call it Wartrace
The unanimity of the press and people
of Texas on the question of immigration
means that a boom is coming
It is painful to note that no one will be
deterred from running for the Legislature
by the insecurity of the capitol building
A one cent rate to Dallas for people
who wish to engage in an effort to build
hd Texas ought to be as profitable to the
f ra i l w
railroads b a six dollarroundtrip ticket
from Fort Worth to Galveston in the sum
mer season
According to Mr Blaine tobacco is a
necessity and woolen fabrics are luxuries
to the working man and his wife and
children
A one cent a mile rate to the coming
Dallas convention will fill our sister city
with more people than she has 6een in
many a day
John Sherman strange to sayis not at
all satisfied with Clevelands message If
it is such a sorry document Mr Sherman
should be pleased
Any good hand who can form a minis
try that will hold water can secure a good
paying job by apolying to President Sadi
Carnot Paris France
The waterworks are all right With
competent management the service can
as satisfactory as any private
corporation could make it
One cent a mile fare to the Dallas
meeting would be an earnest of the sym
pathy of the railroads with the people in
this movement to benefit the state
If thk tariff protects American labor
the coal diggers of Pennsylvania ought to
be millionaires by this time instead of
being hard pressed to exist on their
wages as they are
As long as human nature is human
nature there will be mistakes made As
long as human nature is human nature
no mistake can be corrected or remedied
by another mistake
The negro who is held in Dallas charged
with the sensational assault on the now
Mrs Barlow ought to be liberated in all
conscience Making a farce of justice is
wrong
Do not confuse the discussion in Texas j
by charges and countercharges We all
know that the depression is a fact and
we should all cooperate in a movement
to put the state in a situation to compete
with Kansas California and other states
The whitesouled Hoar wants the
women to be allowed to vote If his bill
becomes a law The Gazette will nomi
nate Francis Folsom Cleveland for
President and move the nominations for
President close Do we hear a second
Did it ever occur to anyone that Con
gressman Martin has expressed himself
sir as being entirely satisfied sir with
the Presidents message sir A motion
to have Mr Cleveland hold over and save
the expenses of an election is now in
order
That competition is
the life of trade
is a maxim as old as business itself
Pools prevent competition Texas is
stagnant and if the pool stands in the
way of an effort to unite the railroads
and the people let the pool rather than
Texas die
When the fact that certain Texas rail
roads were placed in the hands of receiv
ers is urged as a reason why those roads
could no longer expend money for adver
tising Texas let it be remembered tbat
the people of Texas did not forcethe
roads Into the hands of receivers
We have the authority of the Louisville
CourierJournal for the statement that
the man who is accustomed to whisky
wants ii just as much as the man who is
accustomed to tobacco wants tobacco
The Kentucklau who would not throw
away a chew of tobacco In order to secure
a threefinger drink of whisky is a libel
on his state
Republican members are already in
troducing buncombe bills They want the
men who fought in the Federal army
during the war to receive 8 per month
pension As thousands of theGe soldiers
were ninety day men who never saw the
smoke of battle the proposition to pay
them and ruin the country is not likely to
meet with much favor
Like a thunderbolt from a clear sky
comes the announcement that Higgins is
going to resign The man that the entire
Republican party tried to drive from
office and who withstood an almost na
tional opposition is going to do of his
own accord what the world could not
compel him to do It is like a man com
mitting suicide after successfully dodging
the bullets of a whole army
Kansas City has a gentleman named
Corrigan who has undertaken to whipout
beat and walked over one of the local
staff of the Times and afterwards sent the
editor home with a badly broken up anat
omy besides taking his pistol away from
him What Kansas City editors require
Is not a pistolbut one of the paper weights
used by Waco editors during the prohibi
tion campaign
If the railroads are not too much en
gaged in providing transportation for
people leaving Texas for California at
115 cents per mile they would do a
handsome thing by giving the people of
Texas a rate of 1 cent a mile to Dallas
on the 20th inst At that meeting It is
proposed to discuss ways end means to
bring people Into Texas from other states
and thus benefit the railroads as well as
the people of the state
The advocates of a nation with a big N
are again heard from this time as advo
cates of a national marriage law The
state is not to have anything to say in the

matter Of course the idea is to make
the intermarriage of the races legal in the
southern states If the eastern people
desire to absorb the colored element they
must do so by giving their own daughters
in marriage The southern people will
never submit to it The colored people
of the south who have any race pride at
all do not desire Intermarriage neither
do the whites It is an election
that will never materialize
dodge
The railroads lost one opportunity at
the time of the New Orleans exposition
when they were requested to make ex
cursion rates to Texas from the Crescent
city They should not lose another The
people of Texas are wrought up over the
matter now being discussed Do the
roads ever consider that If the public en
treaty Is denied legislation may be in
voked to destroy that whfoh destroys com
petition II Texas can have an equal
chance with other states the people will
care nothing for the pool but if the pool
stands in the way at this juncture and
insists on discriminating against Texas
then it will be all the worse for tne pool
The present immigration movement in
Ttxas is no war on railroads and rail
foad men who seek to create that im
pression are very unwise Some of the
best friends Texas railroads ever had are
prominent in this movement men in
deed who have been denounced as rail
road hirelings for opposing excessive
verdicts and harsh legislation against
railroads The bestj and truest and
wisest friend to railroads is he who di
rects their attention to the terrible earn
estness of the people in the present
movement to lift Texas up and place it
on a plane of equality with competing
states

The United States Postal Improvement
Association is the name of an organiza
tion that has been formed to promote the
reissue of fractional currency and also
to secure a reduction in the postage on
seeds and plants Every planter now has
to pay a tax of sixteen cents per pound
on seeds bulbs and cions as that is the
postage on this class of mail matter It
is desired to have seeds and plants classed
as thirdclass mail matter and subject to
a rate of postage of one cent for each two
ounces or eight cents per pound The
rate in Canada is only four cents per
pound Any plan that will facilitate
the dissemination of plants and
seeds is for the universal good of
the nation and will be supported
by ninetenths of our population Inci
dentally it is desired to abolish the pres
ent postal note system and substitute
therefor money orders for 5 or less at a
charge of > cents The value and im
portance of this great facility to the mail
business of the country will be generally
recognized
We heartily indorse this movement to
increase our postal facilities We urge
all of our readers to immediately write
to their representatives in both branches
of Congress to give this matter their
earnest and cordial support The value
of these personal letters to Congressmen
from their constituents cannot be over
estimated If this is followed up by
all the in the He I
newspaper men country circulation
of petitions in be
half of these measures success will be
assured The National Grange in session
at Lansing Mich unanimously voted on
Monday to help this work for postal im
provement in every possible and legiti
mate way Success is certain if every
one in favor of these ideas will take hold
in earnest
There is continually an increasing evi
dence that the people desire the reissue
of fractional currency At present a large
mcjority of our citizens are hindered in
making remittances in sums less than 1
very much to their discomfort and dis
satisfaction Either postage stamps or
postal notes must be used In most
cases distance from the nearest money
order postoffice renders it difficult to
secure the postal note while postage
stamps are not intended as a circulating
medium and are noF negotiable
Moreover postal notes being issued at
only about 14 per cent of the postoffices
in the country are difficult to obtain
f fe 1S v

They are no safer than a fractional cur
rency bill while those who have experi
enced the delay necessary in our large
towns and cities to secure one of these
notes as well as to collect the paymen
on it will be in sympathy with the pres
ent movement to secure from Congress an
early reissue of fractional currency
All who are interested in this matter
are requested to apply at this office by
mail or in person for circulars giving fur
ther information blank petitions to Con
gress etc These may also be obtained

SOMETHING IS IVBONG
The people say something i3 wrong
with Texas but that the railroads are to
blame
The railroads say something is wrong
with Texas but that the people are to
blame
Since both admit that something is
wrong let both work together to rectify
the wrong and not wsste precious effort
in crimination and recrimination
Something is wrong The railroads
are in position to begin the work of recti
fication and to lead the people The peo
ple are ready to follow any lead for the
betterment of the condition of the state
TO OUE FAIB SISTEBS
The Gazette knows fall well the
peril in speaking of the ladles God
bless em in any other than complimen
tary terms and praise But the Gazette
must do its duty to Texas regardless of
peril or consequences and this paper de
clares that certain lidies of the state are
doing great hurt to the state in the man
ner of their strictures and comments on
Texas life and conditions
Of course the Gazette speaks of those
who are brought here by Texas husbands
and not of the native Texan These im
ported wives leave older states where the
accumulated comforts and luxuries of
years are to be found and come with
their liege lords lo this new land where
fortune is to be won by energy and
industry The husband invests his all
and prepares to swim or sink survive or
perish financially speaking on the ven
ture made
When the heated term comes on the
husband sends his wife to visit relatives
and friends in her old home and she com
pares again the old with the new and
this very comparison of the acquired
comforts of the former with the hope of
comforts to come in the latter impel her
to dwell on what Texas has not and i3
not rather than on what Texas is and has
every hope of becoming
Texas Is a hard state on women all
new countries are so but women who
have linked their fortunes and lives with
men beloved should consult his
interest in all things as of
course the husband should consult
that of the wife And Texas women talk
ing to women in other states can do Tex
as good or harm as such Texas women
choose It Is not necessary to exagger
ate the advantages of life in this state
any more than it Is to ignore the advata
ges and dwell only on the disadvantages
In making or choosing a home man is
more irfluenced by his wife than in aught
else and if Texas women disparage Texas
to women in othef states they are work
ing against their own interests Is there
any lady in Fort Worth amenable to the
charge of working to render the efforts of
her husband more difficult Is there any
one In any other town or city If so let
her consider this suggestion and bear in
mind that as long as her husband makes
this state his home hi3 worldly interests
are here and his interest is her interest

To the Editor of the Gazette
I find that the interest you so nobly in
augurated in behalf of immigration and
which voices my sentiments so often ex
pressed at many places in this state is
having a very salutary effect on the minds
of the people over the entire state The
recent great effort so systematically made
by those in position to secure the benefit
sought by our sister state California has
done much to cripple our varied interests
and we are now feeling the sore effects
created thereby and something was nec
essary to be done to stop such inflox of
people and capital who should locate in
our great country and thereby prevent
the great exodus from leaving whose4h
terests are being blindly sacrificed H
I am certainly in a position to knoWj
and am very frank and honest in saying
that Texas as a country presents more
inducements for the investment of capi
tal and for the comfort of home seekers
than any state in the Union and if they
would only think for a moment many
would look before they leap for if effort
Is coupled with desire Texas is the coun
try after all and boasts of being able to
raise everything that is being produced

Is what Bishop Barrett of Northern Texas
who was one of the delegates to the
Church Temperance Society said at the
meeting yesterday Then he told his
story A year ago I was one of the
principal actors in a strange comedy I
had to make a journey of a little over 303
miles to a part of my district which was
sparsely settled Knowing that the trip
would be long and4onesome I prepared
to meet emergencies by carefully Ail
ing my little black bottle and
wrapping it in brown paper Then I
secreted it in the bottom of the buggybe
tween my feet out of sight but st all
times safely within reach I will be frank
and tell you that In making long journeys
I bad always thus supplied myself

was a hard lot of citizans there On the
porch of the hotel sat several gentlemen
with their trousers tucked into their boots
and liberally ornamented with revolvers
and bowie knives They were loudly con
versing in a style which would not extct
1 be considered proper in a church meet
ing and punctuating their remarks with
expletives and tobacco juice
Howdy parson1 they cried as the
landlord hastened out to help me from
the vehicle As luck would have it the
big Texan discovered the hidden bottle
in the bottom of the bugav There was
no help for it I was discovered He
gave me a meaning glance and with a
loud laugh seized the bottle and waved it
in the air crying Why boys look the
parson takes his bitters like the rest of
us There was a loud burst of laughter
aod the crowd cried Give us a drink
parson Yes said 1 turning desper
ately to the landlord take a drink and
you can treat the whole crowd
The gentlemen and their bowieknives
and their revolvers came gravely down
from the porch The landlord gravely
unwrapped the bottle and held it up to
the light with the air of a connoisseur
He loofeed perplexed the liquid was
lighter than that he was accustomed to
sample Then he gingerly opened the
bottle and smelt the contents The looks
that came over his features I cannot de
scribe WaJ by gosh he exclaimed as
hefwrapped up tne bottle Boys its fur
the wheels
Yes in long journeys the wheels
need it I said and the roar of laughter
that went up completely overwhelmed the
landlord
This was the Bishop3 story ana he did
not conclude it by saying what became of
the bottles contents All the reverend
gentlemen seemed to know
