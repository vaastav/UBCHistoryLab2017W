COPPERHEAD ASI7CB TO REBELS.
In the course of an article opposljgthe
President’s amnesty proclamation in con
nection with the alleged Union movement
in North Carolina, the' Chicago Times
says;
Perhaps tbe South will consent to those terms.
If she do t*,tM degradation they ofer trill not be

'their donee, and governed only by the oversea-'si ash.
No true American could propose such degradation
to fcllow-dtirens, and tbe fact that they have been
made is proot that their, author is either insane
with fanaticism ora traitor who Rloriea In his conn

.. by aboQttouista, before they will think qf submission
to the President's terms.
We are told that under Lincoln’s despo
tism “free speech” has been strangled.
The above is a sample of the remnant that
yet remains.

\was written for circulation in the Sonth. It

the common people in the revolted States;
that it would do the rebel cause great harin
unless it could be misconstrued} and the
rebel rank and file made to believe that its
acceptance would be degrading and dis
honorable. He therefore denounces it in
the most violent words possible to invent

What is treason ? Giving aid and com

it be committed by speech or print ? Is it

the amazing grace of the President who

LOSSES OF THE WAS.
■ The loss of life to the - Union armies
since the war began to the present rime, is
vanoudj estimated. A careful cal eola
tion of the aggregate number killed and
wounded in all the battles and skirmishes
during the past two years and a half give
these figures:
Kffied....
Wounded
It is asserted that
**Of the wounded received into hospital* not
■one-llfih die, and of all the wounded not more
than one-fourth either die or are seriously dis
abled. This is proved by the statistics of hospi
tals. The highest estimate of losses by fighting,
then,la; Killed outright, 25,372; died or ’dis
abled by wounds,* 27,527. Thus wc have 52,799
men holed or disabled.” -
The next thing is lo ascertain the loss by
disease. - This is hard to get at until the
war is over and tbe Burgeons 1 reports are
all sent In and footed up.: But from tbe
best lights before us, it is safe to estimate
tbe number at double those that are killed
or die from the effect of wounds. Recapit
ulating the losses of tbe army since April,
1861, we bare this result:
Killed in tattle and died from the effects of
wooiide
Died of Diseases of all kinds.
'Aggregate of men lost by war.
This number is, in round numbers, one*
sixth of all the soldiers who hare enlisted,
omitting the three months’ men. On the
other hand, it is admitted that the Increase
of able-bodied men, bj alien immigration,
and of youth arriving at sufficient maturity
to bear arms, since the rebellion broke out,
exceeds 400,000 mem If this be true, the
increase of fighting men is more than
twice as great as the loss occasioned by
the tremendous effort to put down the re
oeUion. • '
GEN* BLUNT.
If the report fortunately proves true
Brigadier General Schofield has been in
duced to tender his resignation, in other
words, has been removed from the Depart
ment of Missouri, we may hope that some
Justice will be done agaHauisoldier, whom
that Incubus never failed to insult when
an opportunity presented. We refer to
Major General Blunt This latter is now
at Fort Smith, Arkansas, engagedin organ
izing a colored regiment It will be re

fidd relieved Major General Blunt from
command of the District of the Border and
substituted Gen. McNeiL Gen. Blunt has
quietly proceeded with the next duty en
trusted to him, that of recruiting the 11th
B. U. C. colored vols.
We hope that he will now have a suita
• able command. There is force enough in
the Districts of the Frontier, and the Bor
der, and Arkansas, to give Blunt a small
column, with which to operate, against
Marmaduke, Shelby, Cabell, Cooper and
the whole crew of raiders, with “Pap
Price-' at their head, now rendezvousing
in Southwest Arkansas, the Choctaw Na
tion and Ked RivcrValley. Reports reach
ns that a raid is on foot against Kwwqag
c and Western Missouri; through the Indian
Territory.
Pot Blunt at the head of eight or ten
thousand troops, white and colored, and in
place of such rumors, wo will speedily
hear of a foot race South. • That's Blunt's
style. It isalwaysa ' fight or a 4 foot race,
and generally both, with Union success,
where the Kansan Major General leads.
Schofield’s jealousy and Missouri Conserv
atism cost us the Lawrence massacre. Do
sot Jet its traditions bring a repetition of
' the salne tragedy in other localities. Give
. Blunt & command and we shall soon see
the old flag in Northeastern Texas, and
hear of Union men rallying under its sacred
folds.
K9~As soon as Congress gets to work the Dem

committees. They are determined to show np the

Republican masses desire this investiga
tion—no matter who may suffer by the
result of it. Since the war began the Re
publicans in Congress have been vigilant
and industrious in searching out frauds
and peculations committed - against the

but exposed them without mercy. They
have gone on the principal that it was bad

we read of frauds, here and there, among

that somebody is after them with a sharp

justice means.
We need not expect the knaves and vil

nor that they, will all. emigrate, together.
A country as large as ours will continue
lo have its share; and at any time, the
stock runs low, all Europe is ready to dis
embogue an abundance of recruits upon

through when they show themselves, and
that is about the best we can expect
The alarming feature of the times before
the incoming of the present Administra

among us; nor even that it did climb into
high places, but it was that it went wholly
unwhipped of justice._lt seemed, indeed,

sin. The more astounding the theft, the
higher the thief held his head.
It is gratifying to see that it is no longer

shady and cover their tracks; and every

As long as this is so we need not fear.
LITEBABV.
The Round Table.— This new paper has
made its appearance. It is a sixteen page
sheet, edited with unusual ability, and filled
with articles of the character one would ex
pect io find In a review. It is devoted some
what to political, but mainly to literary, art
and musical matters. The present number
contains quite a readable and discriminative
article on the Chicago Art Gallery daring the
Fair. It is modelled after the style of the
AVtujxum and Spectator , and is. fully up to
them in point of merit It ought to succeed.
The Hasp of Jddail— This is the title of
a new singing book, filled with a very choice
selection of anthems, sentences, chorosses
and chants suited to every occasion requiring
this class of music. It is a real live music
book, replete with all those features thattend
to render snch a book pleasing and popular.
The author is L. O. Emerson, and the pub
lishers Oliver DiUon & Co., Boston.
Myetle Blossoms, bt Mollt Mtbtle.—
A rather fanciful title for a collection of brief
prose sketches and verse, written by a young
lady of this city. We presume we violate no
confidence in stating that she is the daughter
of Dr. Leonard, and has long been a contrib
utor t) magazines and papers. Some of the
efforts ore very pretty, and of considerable
literary merit The proceeds of the sale of
the book will be devoted to the Union sol
diers* of Kentucky. The excellence of the
cause, as well os the fact that it is in every
respect a Chicago book, should command for
it a large sale.

oil attention to the literary enterprise of
Madame 6. F. de Vlngut, a lady from New
York, now on a visit to this city. Madame
de Vingnt proposes to publish a compilation
of her recent writings, in a volume of 500
pages; the collection ranging from the ro
mantic to the philosophical and political, and
Issued in a costly and elegant edition, con
taining a finely executed portrait of the au

distinguished American poet, and the widow
of an cmlnentprofessoroftheNewYorkUni-'

in the literary world. She brings the high
endorsement of William Cullen Bryant’s
name; counts on her list of subscribers some
of the most distinguished people of New
York, Canada, and Detroit, and possesses
many testimonials of high personal worth,
from numbers of warm, appreciative friends,
both East and West. We commend her to

on Monday sight, of last week, to discuss
the subject of enlisting In the navy. One of
the grievances brought forward was the de
lay in deciding prize cases, the still long
delay in paying over the money after the de
cisions, and the large share of it grabbed by
the middle men. There was considerable
strong talk, and resolutions were passed not
to ship in government vessels until the grog

MISSSOURI AFFAIRS—OEN. SCHOFIELD HERE.
There was considerable excitement among
the Missouri members of Congress yesterday
respecting Gen. Schofield, and one of them
reported that he bad certainly been removed.
This is not* so, however, although it is true
that he has been sent for and is nowhere,
whether to receive his walking papers or
more definite instructions for his future guid
ance, is not known with certainty. There
arc conflicting opinions on this point Some
*say positively that his removal has been de
termined upon, and that Gen. Bosecrans has
been selected as his successor. A gentleman
from Missouri informed me last evening that
Schofield attempted to influence the election
of United States Senators from that State,
and, indeed, mode* it a sine qua non that B.
Grata Brown should not be elected.; If this
be true, it alone is .cause sufficient for his
removal What earthly business had he with
the election of Senators, except It be to help
his own confirmation in the Senate? Another
reason for Schofield’s removal lies in tbe tact
that the enlistment of negroes from that State
hasproved a bad failure, because of. the in
competency or traitorism of Schofield’s Pro
vost Marshal and deputies. Whilst there
should have been six thousand, there are not
as vet sixbundred enlisted. I have no doubt
tb&t.ihe' President' is thoroughly reviewing
the acts of Gen. Schofield, and that If he finds
he has not been acting properly, will prompt
ly remove him.. In the mean time, there is
& most determined opposition to Schofield’s
confirmation as Major General, in tbe Senate,
.and! very.much doubt If he can pass the
ordeal of that body. , ,
DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
The wording of Tbaddens Stevens’ resolu
tion, referring the various subjects of the
President’s Message, and the motion of Mr.
Cox concerning a committee of inquiry into
tbe various departments, have caused a shak
ing among the dry-bones. The contractors
especially have taken alarm. The cotton
agents and speculators have also been con
siderably stirred up. Let the committees
seed for persons and papers, and -there will
’be disclosures of fraud and rascality of a
most alarming character, of which even some
heads of Departments can, with difficulty,*
clear their skirts. Some contractors in your
Stutc are among those considerably alarmed
at the threatened exposures. The truth Is, it
is the duly of the Union partv to make these
investigations as thorough as' possible. The
copperheads, if the Union men do not make
tbeproper inquiry, will be but too glad to
assault the Administration In this its most vul
nerable point. Achilles finally losthis life by
being wounded in the heel. May not the Ad
ministration. triumphant in its policies and
acts on all other points, suffer to a very alarm
ing extent in this.
THE NATIONAL BANE SYSTEM.
A good many of the old hanking compa
nies of New York,-Pennsylvania, and other
Slates, I learn, are being gradually driven
out of ihe field of enterprise by the new na
tional banks. I also leam that many of these
would elect to do business as national banks
were they permitted to retain their orig
inal names. A gentleman of Philadel
phia Illustrated this feeling of opposition
tou friend of mine very forcibly a few days
Bu-cc. Bo said: “There is our celebrated
merchant Horace Blnney. Now I have no
doubt that every time he walks the streets he
is proud of his name. What would he think
were some military officer to order that all
the citizens should have their names changed
to numbers, like the new banks—National
Banks No. 1, No. 2, &c. In that case, in
stead of Horace Binney, he would for the
future be addressed as citizen No. 500.”
Allow these old institutions to retain their
names and many of them would organize
under the new law. The idea is worthy of
consideration.
TRFMOiDOUS RUSH FOR PROMOTION FROM
THE ARMT.
There is a tremendous rush for promotion
hcie, on thcpait of Brigadier Generals and
Colonels in riic army, at the same time that
there arc no vacancies In the rank of Major
Generals, and but six in the eight armies
now in the field in the rank of Brigadier.
Mr. Arnold, of your city, bad an Interview
with Mr. Stanton a lew days since, to present
the cases of a number of Colonels from
Cook county, all brave and worthy officers,'
and all entitled to promotion. Indeed I be
lieve nearly all of them are in command of
brigades at the present time. These officers
are: Cob Ducat, late Chief of Staff to Gen.
Bosccrans, an able and intelligent officer;
Cob Osborne, who bravely led our forces at
the storming of Fort Wagner; Cob Sherman,
of the Railroad Regiment:- Cob Loomis,
Cob Bradley, and Cob Gamble, the gallant
cavalry officer now in command of General
Farnsworth’s late regiment, .So here - are
seven officers In Cook county worthy of pro
motion to the rank of Brigadier, and only six
vacancies in *ll the armies of the Union.
The pressure is consequently Immense, and
there will he an imperative demand that a
large number of Major Generals and Briga
dier Generals who are not in the field, shall
be mustered ont to make way for meritorious
officers, who have been fighting the battles
of the country since the commencement of
the war.

OAKEETT DATIS SHOWS BIS HAND, AXD A POOS
OXE AT THAT.
Garrett Davis, of Kentucky, during all last
session, was spiling for a chance to make
a speech and a fool of himself at the same
time; hut did not get, as he considered, a
fair chance. So daring the recess he studied
his piece with a great deal of care, and yes
terday fired it off in the Senate. Like the
militia man, however, in the sham-fight, he
put too many charges into the old musket,
and the result was, when it did go off it
kicked him dreadfully—ln fact, laid him flat
upon the ground.
.'While he was in this unlucky plight, It was
hardly Mr—indeed, it may be said to have
been ciuel—for Revetdy Johnson to inflict
such a castigation upon a prostrate politi
cian. Mr. Day Is offered the following reso
lution:
Sa&tid) That the refusal of the rebel authori
ties to exchange negro soldiers or their officers, or
any class of prisoners from the United States ar
my, should not prevent or suspend exchanges by
onr military authorities for any other class of pris
oners; and justice, policy and humanity demand
that, as fast as it can be done, our brave and Buf
fering countrymen should be delivered from their
captmty.
In the. course of his speech he denounced
the Administration, and charged that, in its
anxiety to protect colored prisoners, it al
lowed white men to perish. He said it was
part of its object for perpetuating its power
as a party and for making capita for the next
election. He denied that the President had
any authority to enlist negro soldiers or to
issue proclamations of emancipation. In do
ing so he charged that the President had
usurped imperial and despotic powers. He
also charged that some Major General had
said that if Mr. Lincoln was defeated in the
nest election he did not intend to
surrender his office. [Was this Gen
eral McClelland] In replying to Mr.
Davis, Senator Johnson, of Marvland,
made a very excellent speech. He said that
if the refusal of the rebels to exchange cob
ored men were the only obstacle, he would
deem it proper that it should proceed, man
for man, as far as it might He should also
provide for the remaining cases by retainin'”
a number of rebel prisoners and subjecting
them to the treatment visited upon onr cb£
ored prisoners in the South. He showed
that the authority of Congress to suppress
insurrection was the same as that to repel
invasion. If colored troops could not be
employed to put down insurrection, neither
could they to repel invasion. The Consti
tution, gives Congress the power to raise
armies. Does It prescribe that they shall
not be colored troops, if necessary? .Surely
not On the contrary, in the revolution
they were, employed in the army and navy,
and in the last war in the navy. And in the
present war our navy has some six or seven
thousand of them, who are capital sailors.
As to the power of the President, Senator
Johnson called the attention of the Senate to
the fact that the “executive power shall be
vested in the President of the united States.”
Some of onr greatest statesmen have held
that by this single provision all authority of
an executive character is vested in the Pres
ident He is required to see that the laws
are properly executed. Should Congress
have omitted to provide for the suppression
of the rebellion, was it not the right and
duty of the President to do so? And how was
he to do it ? by calling out the physical lorce
of the country—slaves, cattle, material re
sources of all kinds, powder, steam, ma
chinery, &c. The Senator went on to show
that if slaves were property in some States,
they were persons also. ■ Though they may
not ho citizens, they arc subjects by birth.
They have the protection of the Government
to some extent, and they should contribute
to its preservation. There may ho just com
plaints as to compensation, and as‘ to tbo
manner in which the law Lad been executed;
but this should not induce the Senator to lift
up his voice in the Senate, or his arm out of
it, to weaken or embarrass the Government
in its efforts to suppress the rebellion.
As to the slave nlfnsplf, compensation cer
tainly divested the owner of all his rights
and conveyed them to the public. And his
employment In the military service, he hod
no doubt, emancipated Imn. He said it
would he disgraceful after the employment
by the Government of colored lucn to defend
its existence, it shoaldpermit them to be re
turned into slavery. He thanked God they
never could be re-enslaved. In a debate on
this floor in 1847, it gave him great pleasure
to remember that he declared then that
slavery was wrong. As a system, morally,
politically, and especially economically.
Slavery was indefensible. The people oftthis
country were rapidly becoming wiser upon
the subject
Messrs. . Hale, Lane of Indiana, and Davis
of Kentucky, continued this very interesting
debate. ■
Now, If slaves are merely property, why
should Hr, Davie be so anxious about them t
Is it not better to expose black property than
white life in defense of the country ? We
have, at this moment, 7,000 colored sallow
and colored soldiers fighting for
the country. But we want more soldiers and
sailors. Yet, Mr. Davis and old fogies like him
tfould prevent the enlistment of colored
troopß. Ho docs not want tho poorfcUowa
hurt. There ore vessels now in our dock
yards ana in oar harbors which cannot be
manned for want of sailors, but Mr. Davis
will not let the Government employ colored
troops. We could not enforce the blockade
effectually without them. Is Mr. Davis for
or against enforcing the blockade? Is he
for or against the war? He who prevents
the enlistment of one white man is subject
to fine and imprisonment Why so? Be
cause he gives old and comfort to the enemy.
What should be done with a Senator of the
United States who would disband nearly
CO,OOO soldiers and sailors now fighting in
defense of the flag? -Is not the man. either a
fool or a traitor? Is not a negro more use
ful than a horse ? A horse cannot fire a gun,
cannot point a cannon, cannot climb a mast
fori a sail, stoke an engine, or do a thousand
things a negro, can do. -As an animal,' even,
a negro is more useful than any other. Then
why refuse to pul him to account in this
awlul struggle to preserve the nation's life?
The truth is, it is a mere question of dol
lars and cents now with Kentucky. Her
slave property has so far been preserved that
sheclings to it with the tenacity of a drown
ing man to some object to lay hold of. And
not only so,' but she has traded in slaves
which had been freed by the President's Pro
clamation. She has thus added to the only
thing which keeps her ini such an anomalous
position In the present contest, as to greatly
neutndizehcrpower on the side of the Uniom
On these accounts, I anticipate much trouble
from Kentucky—more trouble than from
Missouri, Arkansas, and - Tennessee put to
gether.' Her representative in .the Senate, !
,am sorry to - say,- does not speak as a loyal
man 'should. But he has had his say, and
now we know that he stands with those who
prefer to save slave it rather than the Union.
So standing, it is only a question of time that
he will go down to the oblivion or infamy of
those who have not in this fight placed their,
country above all considerations.
THE PACIFIC RAILROAD' COMMITTER.
A place in this cojnmittco of thirteen (you
have the names by telegraph) was eagerly
sought by. members, numbers making per

Colfax considerable difficulty and delicacy In
Its solution. The Speaker, ! may here add,
has given general personal satisfaction in the
selection of his committees, although some
of our Western members complain of the
Middle States being too strongly represented
on committees, in the composition of which
Western interests "are Involved. But a

The Present Situation and What must
be Done Before an Advance can be
Ordered—Backing and trilling by the
War Department, In the Case ofGcn.
Palmer—lnteresting Indian Dlscov*
erles at Bridgeport.
[From Our Own Correspondent.]
2s bar Bridospobt, Dee. 14,1663.
Since the recent battles, the army has set
tled down to the conviction that fighting is
ended for the coming months, and that those
who prepare winter quarters and lay in a
stock of enjoyment for the next three months,
ere serving their country most faithfully.
There will be no more marchings and no more
campaigns until the spring opens, and bat
little interest will attach to our movements.
There is an abundance of heavy and necessary
labor, which can only be accomplished by a
long season of general inaction. The bridge
across tbe Tennessee, the bridge across Run
ning Water, and the railroad hence to Chat
tanooga must be rebuilt, and a vast accumu
lation of supplies secured, before the army
will be in condition to move. This cannot
be done in less thiyp three months.
The bridge at Bridgeport is nearly comple
ted, but that at Running Water hangs heavily.
This is occasioned partly by the delay of tho
military authorities lu furnishing transporta
tion for the bridge, which la now in Nash
ville ready to be set up, and partly because
many of the workmen wove detached to
build the “crab,” by tbe help of which
steamers can get through the “Suck.** at
Kelley's Ford.
Government transportation must be re
newed. Dorses and mules are worn out and
killed, and not a forward movement can be
taken until they are replaced. I presume I do
not overstate the fact, when I say that from
the first to the last in the campaign just end
ed, we have lost not Jess than ten th onsand
ronlesandhorses. Thesennbarled deadline

■Whitesides. At least three million dollars
worth of this kind oftransportatibnhasgone 4
into Uncle Sam's great sinking fund. To re
place this immense qoadrepedal army and to
provide an accumulation for it, is no light
undertaking.
Soon after the battle of Ciilckamanga, Gen.
Palmer tendered bis resignation, giv&g as a
reason that the arrest or Gencnls McCook
and Crittenden and the subsequent absorp
tion of theSOth and 21st army corps, seemed
to reflect upon bis conduct as one of the di
vision commanders who fought that battle,
and to give to the statements of fugitives
from the battle-field the dignity of history.
That resignation ‘was forwarded with the In
, dorsement.“disapproved” by Gen. Rosecrana.
Since then, Palmer has been placed in com
mand of the 14th army corps, end bos prop
erly performed his duties. Tr.o or three
days ago, he received from the Depart
ment notification of the Tacceplancc of bis
resignation, and he immediately turned over*
his command, disposed of his effects andpre
pared to return to private life in Illinois. He
had yesterday reached this place on his way
home, when he received a telegram from
Gen. Hallcck, to the effect that the accept
ance was a clerical error, and intended for
some other Genera), and ordered him back to
Chattanooga to the command of the 14th
corps as heretofore. • Palmer left for Chatta
nooga this morning. The War Department,
by this backing and Ailing, and the general
way in which this business of the olficc is
conducted, docs not especially impress out
siders with the belief that its claim for dig
nity and impartiality in the conduct of its
affaire is well founded.
» IXPIA2T BEMADfS.
Within the last few days several very enri
ons and Interesting mementoes of a racelpng
• since passed away, have been discovered on
the island in the Tennessee, opposite Bridge
port This Island is between two and three
miles long, and a third of a mile wide, and,
like all the bottom lands along the river, pre
sents the appearance of having been tie
dwelling place of a race of Aborigines ante
rior to the later Indian tribes. The soil is an
alluvium, peculiar to the Tennessee Valley,
-and is composed largely of the debris of
fresh water shells.
Many mounds exist, of greater or less ex
. tent, which are wholly composed of these
shells, and are known by tho inhabitants as
shell mounds. The railroad station of Shell
Mound Is built upon one of these hillocks,
sis miles above ns, on the Tennessee. These
mounds seem to have been thrown up by tho
Aborigines, who appear to have gathered
them Irom all directions, many of them hav
ing evidently been brought a long distance
from their original place of deposit They
are of many varieties, the ordinary fresh wa
ter bivalve, or muscle shell, predominating.
I have seen some of these which give evident
marks of salt water origin, hutthey are com
paratively few and insignificant. •
Recently military works have been project
ed and finished across the Island, whose line
led through one of these singular mounds,
and others have been removed altogether to
Macadamize the roads.
These tumuli bear unmistakable evidence
of having been the burial places of Indians.
Thirty skeletons of a race which must have
exceeded seven feet in height, have already
been found, and some very perfect and rare
specimens of ancient pottery. They, contain
no iron or metallic implements ornaments or
tools which are found in the graves of In
dians after acquaintance with the white race.
These mounds are evidently of great age, as
is shown both by the absence oimetollc arti
cles ns noted, and by the discovery upon one
of them of the decayed stump of a walnut
tree, *"■ our feet in diameter; a tree evidently
three to four hundred years old. The mounds
are from six to fourteen feet above the sur
rounding plateau, vary considerably in size,
but all alike conical in shape. The alluvial
deposits covering the shells,'arc of the same
average depth as the rest of the island—three
feet.
Gen; Cruft baa made a collection of these
specimens of ancient pottery; carefully got out
bv some of the workmen, which be Intends
to send to the Sanitary Fair at Cincinnati for
exhibition. and disposition. There are
five ol these, Tajying in size from
three to twelve inches in diameter.
They are constructed of unbaked clay and
appear to have been moulded by the dosin’
fingers of unskilful artists, and, with one'ex
ception, without any attempt dt ornamental
inn. In this one case, there is a border of
indnets or- scollops made with a shell or
sharp stick. These pots arc provided with
cars to which strings were probably attach
ed and placed in the hands of the deceased.
-AH were empty except one which contained
a quantity of wampum or Indian money.
There were also a few stone arrowheads, and
one of these round stones Indians tie to the
end of their talista or battle clubs, and several
rough shells with indistinct tracery upon
them, evidently amulets or chums of the
medicine man.
I should have related in its order, that the
skeletons were in an upright sitting posture,
facing the west, and that each skeleton was
accompanied by the skeleton of a dog, pot
tery, wampum, etc.
The Indians bury their warriors in a sitting
posture, attended each by his favorite dog.
Dls principal occupation is the pursuit of
game in the happy -hunting grounds, and
with his dog they bury his arrows, a pot of
food and a string of wampum to pay LJs fer
riage over Indian Styx.
These remains, their position and sur
roundings, prove that probably they are the
oldest Indian monuments of which we have
knowledge, and open up a field for antiqua
rian inquiry and research.
Is the Negro Fit ft>r Freedom*
The Boston Courier , ono of the moat in
tensely copperhead sheets in the United
States, publishes a communication from a
gentleman, whom it endorses as a long resi
dent at the South, and thoroughly acquaint-,
od with the slaves, who gives the following
•tpllcit testimony as to their capacity to
take care of themselves: ,
They »re , c«v« of prstlicftl mj expert-
enccd agriculturists. Hardly a plantation is
found where there arc not black men" who
ore as com'pcicut to conduct with 'succcsrthe
whole practical agriculture of the place os
their masters were, for whom they once la
bored. I venture the assertion, that, begin
ning with the bumbler classes in northern
communities, there cannot be found five mil
lions of farm laborers who have more practi
cal skill with fanning tools and more direct
knowledge of cbndnctlngthe main operations
in agriculture than these five millions of ne
gro-Americans. Large numbers of them are
touud, also, to understand all tho main fea
tures of that system of religion so wonder
fully adapted to every grade of human Intel
ligence, that system in which faith in a
crucified and arisen Saviour is more than a
substitute for every other knowledge and all'
other rites. I suppose we are safe m assum
ing that there are nve hundred thousand of
these blacks, who, in point of Christian light
and Christian practice, will compare favorably
with the converts from paganism made by
the labors of our foreign missionaries."-
Gen. Burnside at Cincinnati.
Gen. Burnside, the hero of Knoxville, ar
rived at Cincinnati on Saturday, .During his
brief stay he was serenaded, and In acknow
ledgement spoke as follows:
Mr Friends— :l can only thank you for tho
very kind manner in which you have wel
comed me, lam not gifted with the power
of speaking to an audience like this. But,
gentlemen, though lam unable to fully ex
press myself as I truly feel in respect to the
great events that are transpiring, al
low mo to assure yon that
no one can feel more thankful than
I • do to the loyal people of the country
for t eir devotion to the great cause in which
we are struggling. lam thankful for your
kind estimation of the value of my services,
and can only say that I have endeavored to do
my duty and shall endeavor to do still better
in any future position to which I may be call
ed. I sincerely hope that peace may soon be
restored to our beloved country: but as long
as these troubles continue‘and I can bo of
service, lam ready to do all in my power.
[Applause.] I have tried to do my best; and
what I have done in East Tennessee baa been
dne to the full cooperation of the subordi
nate officers and privates of my command.
Not a single officer or a man has for a single
moment intimated that in his opinion I was
making mistakes or erring in my movements;
and not one has at any time hesitated to
render a full, faithful, and energetic obe
dience to orders in each and every ; thin".
But notwithstanding this happy union of ef
fort on the part of the officers la command
of the field, tho chief praise of onr success
is due to the subordinate officers and men
In the ranks. .Thousands of men in
the ranks deserve tho credit that is given
to the leaders. Many of them have no
relations in this-country—foreigners—who .
will never hear of them again. And they
fight for thtf country they love, being actua
ted by genuine patriotism. I owe all my
success to this patriotism in the ranks, as al
so do all other generals who have been suc
cessful. The principal achievements of this
war are chiefly to be credited to the subordi
nate officers and the devoted fighltng men in
the ranks, who endure all, and dare all, with
little other object In view than the defence of
onr common country. I have never been
more conscious of this fact than during my
last campaign. For one 1 shall never lorget
what is one to the men in the ranks. [Ap
plause.] •
Allow.me, then, to return you my thanks
for the compliment you have paid me, and to
withdraw, expressing the ardent hope that
onr country may soon he at peace with her
self, and continue forever In the enjoyment of
peace within and with tho external world.
[Great applause.]
The Cincinnati' Commercial says the ap
pearance of Gen.. Burnside is that of robhst
health. The illness with which he is report
ed to have suffered since the siege of Knox
ville was raised, was a slight attack of rheu
matism. The General's opinion is that the
rumors of reverses in East Tennessee, and of
the resumption of a menacing attitude by
Longstrcct, have very little foundation in
fact. Gen. Longstrcct and army retired from
in front of Knoxville sorely troubled in mind
and body, and lost largely, as reported, in
deserters and stragglers, and siege guns
abandoned. The enemy is in no position to
undertake an offensive campaign, and the Fe
deral force in East Tennessee is much larger
than Gen. Burnside had there. The news
paper reports of the siege of Knoxville have
been full and accurate.
pen. Burnside has not resigned his com
mission. Be tendered his resignation, and it
was not accepted. He was relieved of the
command of bis department and ordered to
report at Washington, which he Is proceed
ing to do promptly, leaving for that city on
the ten o'clock train Friday night
Atrocious Outrage in Washington
County—BXyMerltms Abduction or a
Young auu Beautiful Girl,
[From the Illinois State Journal, 19th.]
A private letter from a lady at Richview,
Washington county, in this State, gives the
particulars of a most misterions outrage
which was perpetrated at the residence of
Mr. M. A. Linton residing about four miles
from Richview, on the night of the sth lust.
The writer states that a party of thirteen
men, disguised by handkerchiefs tied over
the lower part of their faces, and armed with
navy revolvers, presented themselves at Mr.
Linton's house about half post two o'clock
at night and demanded admittance. On
being refused they threatened to break down
the door. The spokesman of the party was
recognized as a man who had taken supper
at Mr. Linton's the same evening, under pre
tence of having lost his way to Hajleton, tho
next town.
On being admitted, tho party demanded
Gincvra, a daughter of Mr. Linton’s, by a
former marriage, a beautiful and amiable girl
sixteen years of age, who had just returned
home from a boarding school in Ohio. She
having just run down stairs to see what was
the matter, was seised by three ruffians and
-told that she must go with them, dead or
alive. Her father being totally unarmed was
powerless to defend her. The girl was
dragged to her room, and after being allowed
to dress herself, was forcibly carried to a
buggy and driven off As she was borne out
of the door, she turned towards her lather,
raised her hands and exclaimed •“ Oh God I”
A party of eight men were left to guard
the house till daylight, to prevent any alarm
being given. During the- night they paced
around the house, knocking at the door,
looking In at the windows, rattling the glass,
and taunting the wretched inmates by asking
how they liked evening calls, etc. No cine
has been obtained to the abductors, or to the
course token by them, although a
whom Mr. Linton met at a store at Richview
the same day is suspected to have been one
of them. Another statement is to the effect
that a woman who Dad been prowling around
the neighborhood for some time past Is one
of the abducting party.
Mr. Linton Is a Quaker by profession, and
it was well known that he was unarmed.
Forsometlmepastaperfcctrclgnofterror
has prevailed In the region referred to above.
It was within a few miles of the same neigh
borhood (at Ashley) that a number of robber
ies were perpetrated recently, of Which we
gave some account a couple of weeks ago.
Tho vicinity is overrun by deserters and rebel
sympathizers, readers and admirers of the
Chicago Tiriif.f, who are undoubtedly the per
petrators of the outrage.
Hydropliotln—A Horrible Coup
I [From the Watertown (2?. Y.) Journal, Ifith.]
I A ten- horrid case of this disease occurred
in the town of Adame, not far from what' is
known as Tnlcott’s Tavern stand. Mr.
James H, Kenyon, a man 42 years of age,was
rotten by a mad dog last June, In the town
of Redfield, Oswego county. At the tlmehe
thought very little about ft, not knowing
that the dog was mad until several days a£
l cr ;, f^P e^P a£scd on 1112(1 Kenyon said
but little about It to any one until about five
or six days before his death.
~H e fimnotlced an itching sensation on the
thumb which had been bitten by the dog;
■whenever he rubbed the sensitive portion!
cold chills would instantly pass over his
whole body. This was on Sunday. On Mon
day he felt cold chills 'ogam; he then mis
trusted that he was having the hydrophobia.
He took a sweat and on Tuesday went out
and worked some. On Wednesday he was
taken with vomiting, which continued near
ly all day.
. Thursday he was cross and “snappish” to
those about him, and that night Mr Jere
miah Parker was called. At this time Ken
yon was having slight fits once in S or 4 min
utes; he talked rational, and said that he
was unable to control himself, and did not
know what he might be led to do: and there
fore he wished to be tied to the bed; this
was done os he requested.
In his convulsions he tore the feather and
straw beds into pieces and threw’himself
from one side of tne bed to the other seem
ingly as quick as lightning—movidg at the
same time 32 or 18 inches each way—this
while he was lashed to the bed. He could
not endure to haye a drop of water even in
the room, and if any was offered him he im
.mediately went into convulsions. He now
was in the greatest agony and plead with the
Doctor to bleed him to death. He died
about 7 o’clock on Friday mording.six months
from the time he was first bitten.
Colored Soldiers Murdered by the Reb
els—Fate of the Heroes of IfUlLikcn’s
Bend.
Our readers tv ill remember the capture, In
June last, of a company of colored soldiers at
Milliken’e Bend, Mississippi, "while General
Grant "was Investing Vicksburg. They were
taken while fighting bravely, with the odds
fearfully against them* It was the first in
stance of note in which colored soldiers had
been in action, and the men proved their bra
very and capacity to the admiration even of
those who doubted the ability of the freed
men to make soldiers. Thccngogemcnt took
place at Millikcn’s Bend, a few miles north of
Vickeburrf A Captain, First Lieutenant and
about eighty men were taken prisoners.
Since their captivity their fate has been In
volved in profound mystery. Nothing offi
cial could be-learned concerning them, and
from the well-known vindictiveness fo the
Rebel military authorities the worst was ap
prehended.
‘-Information has been received at the War
Department, by way of Texas* stating that
these apprehensions were too well founded.
It appears that the prisoners were conveyed
into the country several miles and placed in
close confinement No Intimation of their
fate was given them. After several days the'
two officers were taken out at dead of night,
and word given out that they bad escaped.
It now appears that they were hahgcdiwith
out previous notice or even a semblance‘of
trial, in obedience to a secret order from the
Rebel Secretary of War. A few days'after
wards the other prisoners also disappeared
mysteriously, and there la no donbt bat they,
also, were secretly murdered by direction of
the Richmond authorities. What retaliation
shalll>c inflicted for these moat barbarous
atrocities is yet to bo determined. It does
not appear as yet that any colored soldier has
fallen Into the hands of the Rebels who was
not cither put to death ou the spot or subse
quently assassinated in secret by order from
Richmond*

Alleghany l.ivo Stock Market—Bee. IS.
There was a. marked decline in the prices of all
grades of stock this week, and the market was doll
throughout. The demand was almost entirely local
and with a large snpply, we have to record a decline
of shoot Me* a, as compared with last week. There
was hot a limited inquiry for government stock
though a few bead were sold for this purpose, at a de
cline of at least Xc V ft. This same stock was after
wards sold at a loss, the owner preferring to sell
rather than ship and risk the chance oi selling In the
cast. The best price that can be obtained for this
grade of stock fn Baltimore is *l,lO * cwt, subject to
a close Inspection. * J
There w ere more really good cattle on sale than for
many weeks, the best qualities of which retailed at
from 4@4jfc, and some few extra lots at sc. The im
prcralon prevails among dealers that cattle will not
uo any higher during the coming month, as there vin
bi hut little demand for shipment, ’ WIU
We Rive a few of the leading sales, sufficient, how
ever, to Indicate correctly the range of prices:

Fittsburgh Oil Market—Dec* 19*
Wc have nothing new in regard to this article. The
demand wbr purely local, and confined entirely to
email lots. Buyers do not acem to have any confi
dence in the r&i ca demanded by holders; besides, they
are watting to ece the extent of the present ran of oil,
which, from appearances, will be large. The ship
ments weat. by steamers, were large, amounting. In
the aggregate, to 1.400 battels, divided among the va
rious Coats that have departed.
The imports by rail and river wore crude, 3.500 brio:
refined MO brls. The exports cast were Crude, 3X50
brUj refined 1,109 brls, Grade holders were asking
cce price, and topers were aatlnk another. The only
pairs that came coder oar notice wen tat brie erode
at 15c, and SCO brls la balk at 20c. Bodned was un
changed as retards prices or demand. The nominal
rates were, bonded 40c; free, 50c.
Bt. Louis Markets—Dec. 15,
Floor was quite dull, and nothing of Importance
transpired. wheat wasln email receipt and firmer,
with sales of SCO eks fair to choice fall at ft to St.'S
V bushel. Corn was higher, sales being reported of
1,010 sk* new and old at |L2S to 51.30 Pouihel. Oats
were held higher, bat oarers declined paring the
prices asked, and bat little was done. A tot of asosks
at&Kc IP bushel was the only sale reported. Tnero
was no change In barley, fnL- fall selling at $1.13, and
prime spring at 8150 V bushel, exclusive of sacla. No
sales or rye were reported. A fair business was trans
acted in beans, mostly at {2.40 to 8280 ? boshel.
Whisky was held at 90c 7 gallon, with no buyer*.
Timothy hay held at 31.53 ? 100 bs. tildes were steady
at 18c v b for flint. Salt was lower, with sales of Ohio

Toledo Bog Market—Dec* 15.
Dbeesed Hogs—There is no change to n >te. The
weather Is favorable for shipping, oat receipts are
light. Prices range from for medium and
choice heavy: Ugh; and inferior are neglected.
CHICAGO CATTLE MAUKET.
Monday Etskeco. Dec. 21. ISG3.
DOGS—The receipts of Hogs since Saturday, ac-
cording fo the returns published on 'Change,
amount to 6,445, besides which two or three of the
trains that had heen delayed by ice and snow, ar
rived during the day. One of these we saw par*
tially unloaded at the Southern Tarda. Hose of
the Hogs it contained must have been on the road
for a considerable period, the dead ones being
wholly putnd, and tboM that were still living
were In a terrible state of filth, and emitted such
•on odor that we were glad to run away With all
speed after some fresh air. The greatest care on
the part of the railway officers would probably be In
sufficient to prevent the recurrence occasionally of
this state of things, especially at such seasons of
the year as the present, when our railways are
overburdened with excessive freight; bnt surely
the greatest efforts should be made topreventthenx
as faras possible. The yards—have generally been
active—the entered sales since Saturday eve
ning amounting to >12,841 Hogs, the bulk
of which have been sold at $3.00®5.65
per one hundred pounds for prime and extra
qualities the market baa been much firmer to-day
than it was on Saturday last, at the quotations
then given. Advices from Hew York thta morn
ing were very favorable. Indicating a considerable
improvement in the market, and prices better
than they were last week—this has stimulated our
shippers. We are pleased to hear that the ob
structions on the Mississippi, through floating Ice,
and which have kept back a large quantity of
stock, exist no longer : the ice being now suffici
ently thick for crossing. Several of our corres
pondents have written us within tnc past few
days on the subject. George Bligh, who Is on his
way to Chicago with live stock, writes from Bur
lington on Friday last, and informs us that west
of Burlington the train ran off the tract, In a heavy
snow storm, and that at Burlington they were
still detained on the western bank of the river*
unable to cross. The picture is rather a gloomy
one for drovers thus kept hack on their Journey,
with bay and corn at such high prices ; bat we
hope ere this all is right again.
