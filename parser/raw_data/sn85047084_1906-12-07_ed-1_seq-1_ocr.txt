Advanee sheets of the "Report of the Governor of the Territory of Ha
waii to the Secretary of the Interior" for 1906 have been received by the
Advertiser from Washington.
It makes a volume of 122 pages. Governor Carter's own remarks, gen
eral and special, occupy nineteen pages at the beginning. Besides discussing
the reports of others appended, the Governor gives trade statistics, figures of
electoral registration, statements of progress in wealth, a resume of the sea
fisheries question and so forth, concluding with suggestions on needed legis
lation. For the rest the volume is taken up with reports of officials, Federal as
well as Territorial, and articles by special writers. Of such this is the list:
"Agricultural Experiment Work." by Jared G. Smith; "Federal Quarantine
Problems," by L. E. Cofer; "Improvement of Harbors," by Lieut. J. R. Slat

To accompany the descriptions of counties there will be handsome maps,
prepared specially for this report, which have not come with the advance
sheets. They will show the different classes of lands by distinguishing tints
and have schoolhouses, postoffices, roads, etc., indicated.
An interesting feature of the printed work is the "reformed spelling,"
in which everything now emanating from the Government Printing Office,
Washington, has by Presidential edict to be executed. "Discust" strikes the

GOVERNOR'S UTTERANCES
THE
Secretary Jack Atkinson was present
at the meeting of the Promotion Com
mittee yesterday afternoon, enlisting
the cooperation of the committee in
the proposed New Year's Day regatta
at Waikiki. The Secretary addressed
the meeting on the matter, pointing out
that a very successful day's sports
cculd be had at a very small cost.
The idea of the Secretary is to have
the events limited to Hawaiian aquatic
sports, canoe racing, surf riding and
surf steering contests between canoes.
Such an affair, said Mr. Atkinson.
would be a pleasing novelty and would
be almost certain of success. The res
idents along the Waikiki beach and a
number of others have already prom,
ised to give substantial support to the
movement and the hotels at Waikiki
had also promised to go down liberally
on a subscription list to raise funds
for the purchase of prizes and the pay
ment of expenses. It was expected that
the Inter-Island Steamship Company
would help by giving free passage to
the canoe crews from the other is
lands, as they had done before.
In conclusion, Mr. Atkinson said he
hopes tne committee would approve
of the plan and cooperate in carrying
it throueh. The affair misht also be
made an annual one and would help in
attracting tourists to Hawaii.
This proposal was heartily received
by the committee, of which the full
membership was present, and a com
mittee consisting of J. F. Morgan and
F. Li. Waldron was named to push the
matter. The only objection advanced
was that there possibly might not be

WASHINGTON, D. C, November
The status of railroads in the Hawai
ian Islands has been informally but of
flclally defined in several interesting
particulars during the past week by the
Interstate Commerce Commission. This
followed a hearing before Commission
ers Knapp, Clements and Harlan a few
days ago, at which Mr. Sidney Ballou.
attorney for the Oahu Railroad and
Land Company, appeared. He was ac
companied by Mr. L.. A. Thurston and
Mr. F. M. Hatch. The three commis
sioners were all of the opinion that the
railroads of Hawaii are subject to the
railroad rate regulation law, as it is
an organized Territory of the United
States. Mr. Baliou fully acquiesced in
that view. It is understood that the
owners of the Oahu road have been of
the same opinion.
The commission held also that the
Oahu road should file all its tariffs,
both general and special, with the In
terstate Commerce Commission and
post the same at the several stations
along its line, just as railroads on the
mainland are doing. The tariffs ac
cordingly have been filed with tha
commission, Mr. Ballou having brought
them with him from Honolulu.
Chairman Knapp, during a talk with
the Advertiser's Washington cor
respondent yesterday, indicated fully
what the attitude of the commission
will be with reference to questions aris
ing with the Oahu road. It. seems that
the d. sectors of the road have had
doubts about matters of tariffs. As
is pretty well understood among Ha
waiian shippers, the road has contracts
with numerous plantations by which
sugar and merchandise are shipped at
special rates, differing in some cases
from the general public rates. These
contracts in many instances were
made before annexation and for long
terms of years. Most of the contracts
have a considerable time yet to run.
Some of- them were on a sliding scale.
A certain rate was to be charged for
the first ten years, a lower rate tor
the next ten years and so on.
Mr. Ballou explained these contracts
to the commission, and Chairman
Knapp said
