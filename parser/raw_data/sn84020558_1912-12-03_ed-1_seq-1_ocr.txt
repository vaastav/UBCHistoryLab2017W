WASHINGTON, Dec 2. The senate
and house settled down to work today
for the high pressure session that is to
nd the sixty-second congress. Speak
er Clark, wielding the emblem of order
with ever increasing force, succeeded
in breaking two gavels before he
brought the enthusiastic members
through an hour and ten minutes busi
ness. The session of both houses served to
complete the preliminary work of or
ganization and loft congress ready for
legislative business tomorrow.
The senate depressed by the recent
death of Vice-President Sherman and
Senators Heyburn and Rayrier, was in
session twenty-two minutes. Both
houses adjourned as soon as the pre
liminaries of organization were con
cluded out of respect to the officers
and members who had died since ad
journment in August. The house will
convene at noon tomorrow. The roll
call of the houses showed G senators
present out of a membership of 93 and
275 representatives out of a member
ship of 391. There are three vacancies
in each branch.
President Taft's message will come
to both houses tomorrow. The senate
will meet at 11 o'clock, an hour before
the customary time, so that the mes
sage may be received and read 1 if fore
the proceedings are begun in the court
of impeachment which is to try Judge
Robert W. Archbald of the commerce
court.
Boisterous enthusicasm greeted the
return to the house of Speaker Clark
former Speaker Cannon tnd other
members whose names have long been
associated with the important affairs of
that body. Former Speaker Cannon
was ttiven a rousing greeting when his
name was reached. Democrats and re
publicans who had joined in the ap
plause for Speaker Clark when he ent
ered the chamber at noon, jumped to
their feet and joined in the cheering.
Four governors-elect who will go from
the house of representatives to their
respective state capitols were also vig
crously cheered as the roll call pro
ceeded. They were Representatives
fiutzer of New York. Cox of Oh!o, R1
inson of Arkansas and Hanna of Xoitn
Dakota.
No business was transact" u 1 the
senate, but a number of bills and reso
lutions were Introduced in the house
A joint committee was named by the
two houses to notify President Taft
that congress i.s ready to receive com
munications. Senator Bacon, the pre
siding officer of the senate, appointed
Senators Cullom and Martin and
Speaker Clark named Representatives
Underwood, of Alabama: Mann, of Il
linois and Johnson of Kentucky.
The senate republicans neld an in
formal conference in the effort to solve
the tangle that has prevented the se
lection of a permanent presiding offi
cer in the senate. It Is expected that
a republican caucus will be held before
the end of the week and that an ef
tort will be made to secure enough
support from the progressives and in
surgent republican senators to brim
about the election of Senator Gallin
ger.
The first bill introduced in congress
was bv Representative DeForrest of
New York, to pension former presi
dents and the widows of former presi
dents. The secretary of the treasury
submitted an estimate of expense for
the fiscal year of 1912, the rand total
of w hich ia $223,415,455, which is an in
crease of $72,078,248 over that of the
year 1911 and includes $56,766,992 for
river and harbor improvements. The
investigating committee will resume
hearings on December 10.
While the present session is merely
the expiring stage of a congress soon
to go out of existence and to be su
perceded in political control and policy
after March 4, yet today's sessions in
the senate and house bring together
for the first time since the recent over
turning those leaders and elements of
the various parties who have been most
prominent in public affairs. The oid
faces and figures are again in evidence
today, although some of them, like Ex
Speaker Cannon, will soon pass off the
congressional stage, while others lik-3
Speaker Clark and Chairman Unvier
wood, have had their tenures renewed,
and strengthened.
As a whole, however, the dominant
note as both branches of congress as
semble is hat new conditions, new
policies and new men have been ush
ered in as a result of the recent elec-i
tion ami that about the only function
of ..the present short session, lasting

DEFENSE TAKES
After Examining Its .")49th
AY i t n e s s, Government
Closes Case Against Al
leged Conspirators After
Moving Dismissal of 4.
r ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATClll
INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 2. Argument
that those who have already confessed
alore caused the illegal transportation
of explosives on passenger trains to
blow up non union iron and steel jobs
was advanced to-day in the examtnn-
tion at the "dynamite conspiracy trial
of John M. Ryan, president of the in
ternational association of bridge and
structural iron workers. After hear
ing the testimony of its 549th witness,
the government closed its ease anel on
Us own motion had four of the forty
five defendants dismissed on the
ground that the charges against them
had not been sustained. Before taking
the stand as the first witness for the
defense, F. M. Ryan, announced the
resignation of Herbert S. Hockin as
secretary-treasurer of the union.
The discharge of the four defendants
leaves forty-one still on trial.
Charles W. Miller, United tSates dis
trict attorney, moved the dismissal of
these defendants this morning when
he announced that all the government's
evidence against them had been dis
missed. The men dismissed are: William K
Benson, former president of the De
troit federation of labor: Milton II.
Davis, Westchester, Pa., former mem
ber of the executive Hoard of the inter
national bridge and structural iron
workers; Surgeon P. Meadows, Indi
anapolis; business agent for the local
council of the international brother
hood of carpenters and joiners, and
John R. Carroll of Syracuse, N. Y., a
former official of the iron workers.
The government declares ;he release
of the elefendant will not affect the
merits of the remaining eases said At
torney Miller. The government has
no desire to punish the innocent defen
dant and have concluded that while
Carrol Benson and Meadows have a
guilty knowledge to the conspiracy to
illegally transport explosives. The evi
dence does not connect them with the
unions conclusively. Davis retired
from the union in 1907 and has taken
no part since.

Realty Securities Company
Secures Additional Front
age on Monroe Street
Adjoining Site of Propos
ed Kight-Storv Structure.
With the consummation yesterday of
a deal whereby the Realty Securities
company secures from George D.
and James S. Day, the 100 foot
frontage on West Monroe street im
mediately adjoining on the East the
100 foot corner holdings acquired by
the same concern some weeks ago,
an epoch in real estate deals was
marked in Phoenix. The Days had
been in possession of the property
but a few weeks over two years, se
curing it a"t a figure approximating
$22,00(1, and disposed of it yesterday
for the round sum of jr.OiOO. Within
an hour after the deal was consum
mated, an offer was made to the
Realty Securities company of a con
siderable advance over the price paid
for one of the lots with fifty foot
frontage1. The offer was refused.
Possessed of 200 feet on West Mon
roe street, 100 leet or which runs
back to the alley, a distance of 137 Vi
feet and the remaining 100 feet runn
ing back TTVs feet to the Mohn
building, the concern is now in con
trol of a site more than sufficient for
the handsome $200,000 eight-story
steel and concrete structure planned
and the construction of which will
begin Just as soon as the neces
sary structural steel can be secured.
Six im nths from the time the steel
! is received and construction commenc
ed, it is asserted by the promoters.
the huliding will be ready for oc
cupancy.
As planned but twenty-five feet of
the property secured yesterday will
be utilized with the corner 100 feet
in the erection of the proposed
office building. The remaining sev
enty-f.ve feet, it is planned' to hold
as an investment. The offer made
yesterday for fifty feet of the 100
feet just transferred would have nett
ed a neat profit, but it is the policy
of the Realty Securities company to
give tile stockholders of that concern
every penny of profit to be lealized
from the enterprise and it was felt
that there is about to be a further ad
vance in realties values in that sec
tion and that the stockholders might
ist as well profit by that advance as
some individual.

LONDON, Dec. 2. That Dr. Von
Bethmann-Hollweg's declaration that
the solidarity of a triple alliance, which
it is reported, has just been renewed
for another term of years, and the an
nouncement of Germany's determina
tion to uphold Turkey in an economic
sense, is likely to influence the dele
gates of all countries concerned to dis
cuss peace conditions in a spirit of
moderation is already shown in the
armistice negotiations. According to
the Greek minister in Paris, Greece op
poses the proposal that the besieged
garrisons be provisioned during the
armistice.
No doubt jealousy exists between
Greece and Bulgaria, as Greece asesrts
that the Greek fleet played an im
portant role in the war, especially pre
venting Turkey from moving troops by
sea and that without her naval assist
ance the allies could not have achieve!
such a brilliant success. The race be
tween the Greeks and Bulgarians for
l the occupancy of Saloniki and the in
cidents following this has increased the
ill feeling. The Greeks noT consider
the interests are being sacrificed In the
peace negotiations. It is expected that
the armistice protocol will be signed
sometime tomorrow, but it is possible
it may be further delayed.
Peace Delegates Meet.
SOFIA, Dec. 2. The plenipotentiar
ies held a meeting1 at 3 o ciock tnis
afternoon at Paghtche, but it Is con
sidered doubtful whether any definite
conclusion regarding an armistice will
be reached before Tuesday night or
Wednesday.
An important point of the armistice
has been settled, such as the retention
of the respective armies positions they
now occupy. The question of the Bul
garians using the Adrianople railway.
it is asserted probably will not be
dropped, as will the Turkish counter
demand for permission to send food to
the garrison there. This is regarded
as utterly impossible. The Adrianople
railway is no less indispensable to Bul-
garie, because great supplies of wheat
have been discovered in Dedeaghaton
with a mill capacity of many tons of
flour daily, which can be sent by rail
way direct to the troops at Tchatalja.
The third clause of the protocol re
lating to the blockade of ports on the
Black and Aegean seas is not consid
ered vitally important. If further de
lay accurs in the completion of the ar
mistice it is felt here the blame rests
with the Greeks who for some inscrut
able reason wish to continue the war.
Bulgaria, Servia and Montenegro favor
peace. Turkey it is believed to be ac
tuated ith the same desire.
According to reliable information re
ceived here. Great Britain and Russia,
as well Germany, have counselled Tur-
( Continued on Page Eight)
the Realty Securities company "will
necessarily advance the value of prop
erty adjoining. We feel that while
we really do not need that land for
our building, the time will come when
it can be disposed of at much greater
advantage to our stockholders than
at present." He said that the diffi
cult in obtaining steel shipments was
one of the principle causes of the de
lay in the beginning of immediate
construction work.
