TUB rilESIDBNT'S M.E3BAOB.
We received the President' Message about
two hours toefone going to press too Lite fur
iti insertion this week. Had it como to hnnd
on Tuesday we should Hm c :given it in full j ns
it is it will go over .to next week.
The message is n model of compact statement
nnd of brevity. It gives n salisfa'tory stntc
ment of the progress made in suppressing the
rebellion, and of ifhe prospect for the future.
The relation of the war to Slavery the Frcst
dent evades, except to recommend thu acquisi
tion of territory upon which to locato the con
fiscated contraband, and such freo negroes as
choose to leave the country. Uy his silence he
signifies the determination of the administra
tion to leave slavctproperly to the natural nnd
inevitable effects of a statu of war. Tlj"loio
of events" is more potent in the solution of
difficult problems than til the theories of the
most distinguished theorists.
"The President's message was unaccompanied
by anyiileparltnent documents. In consequence
of the estimates of the depaitmcnts coming in
later than usual this 5 car, thu teport of the sec
retary of the trcaniTj w.'dl not be sent to Con
gress till Friday or Saturday.
T1IB LAWS.
On the outside of to day's paper we publish
all the acts of the late session of the Legisla
ture, designated by the Secretary of Slate for
publication. In the net numbered "0," and en
titled "An Act 'for the protection of the treasu
ry," n manifest error occurs in the last two
lines of -section fout 1 the word "second" be
fore the word "section" should lead "third s" as
the error was in the original act as it passed
both Houses and wot approved, we did not
feel at liberty lo make the required change. In
the act numbered "03," and entitled "An Act
providing jury for -certain soldiers, ond in rela
tion to the support of fiimillcs of volunteers,"
reference is made in the Jib and 8th lines of
the first section "to the acts to -vv Inch this is an
amendment j" the act now stands (his is ob
scure, but if'itli borne in mind that the origin
al title of the bill befoie it was amended was,
"An Act In amendment of acts entitled, 'An Act
to provide for laising six special regiment for
immediate service for protecting and defending
the Constitution and Union,' and 'An Act to
provide for citizens of Vermont mustered into
the service of the United States,' Approved
April 20, ISO," the obscurity vanishes. This
act as it now stands was the result of a confer
ence rtcluccn committees of the two Houses,
and in changing the title of the original bill, of
which the 1st section of this act was a pait, the
phraseology of the section aforesaid was inad
vertently overlooked. Thcie can, however, be
no reasnnalde doubt as to the construction ot
this act, and entmnly -pone as to the intention
of the Lcgisloturc.
In reference to the multiplicity of acts, in
which provision and referc .ce to the pay of vol
unteers and aid to their families are made, the
following abstract ot' the law 011 that subject as
it now stands, ban lxcn prepared and it is be
lieved to be accurate mid to cover the whole
ground :
All troops hereafter r .ised, except the Duller ! R0"t Co. and Ilrnwn & Tnggard, has estah
Kecimcnt and Sharp Shooters, will be entitled "'d himself ot Xo. L'O Washington street,
to the same pa- V re the State as is provided
in the "Six ll;:.nrat Act," of last Spring, for
thu full term of their enlistment, viz: for non
commissioned ollicrrs musicians and piivates
$20 per month until mustered into the service
of the United States and $7 per month thcre
nftcr. All non-commissioned officers, musicians and
privates, who art citizens and residents of tin's
State, and who enlisted pieuous to November
20th, lb'Gl, and all who enlist subsequent to
that date who nt the tints of their enlistment
had been citizens and icsidents of this State
sixty dais, are entitled to the benefits of the act
"providing for the support of families of citi
zens of Vermont mustered into the servicoof
Ihe United States."
All Vermont troops now in the service of the
United States, including the Sharp Shooters,
Col. Plan's Cavalry Kejlmcnt, and Col. Thom
as' Ki glment nro entitled to $7 per month on
ly from this State.
The $7 per month pay be; 51ns in all cases
from the date of mustering into tho service of
of the United Slates.
TUB STATU TAX.
Among the laws designated by the Secretary
of State for publication we do not find tho net
which provides for the support of government.
We can conceive of no icaon fur its omission,
for it is an act of more consequence lo the pub
lic than almost any other that was enacted by
the General Assembly. It is of itself nn ir
resistible appeal to the pockets of every man,
and one that is nlteu made in a touching man
ner. The comforts nnd enjojments nt life nrc
evanescent nnd uncoil iln, but taxes, like death,
are sure to overtake t very man of any means'
whether visible or invisible. Xo plea in abate-1
mer.t will ward off the constbale, for be uliiavs 1
goes armed with a document that provides for j
the distraining of goods, chatties, Sec, and "in
default thereof to tako tho bodv," Arc. It is n
weapon that never misses firn nor (ails to bring
Uown the game. And this j ear Ibis fact is like-
ly 10 uc appreciated. j
Tho tax imposed by the net refericd to is fit) 1
per cent of the Grand List, This Lift for Slate
taxes amounts to $070,. '590,05 ; 50 per cent of
which is about 8483,450. Dedtielinir abate-I
mcnts and 2 1-2 per cent for collection and it I
is believed that this tax will vield ft iso (inn mi 1
revenuo. Ut this tax the proportion for Wind-1
nam Louniy amounts 10 nearly 10,000 j and
for the town of llrnttlehoro, $7,222.
Tho fees for the collection of this tax nro re
duced one half on the ground that ii is but lit-
tlo more labor to collect 11 large than a 6mall
tax. In most cases, however, the towns and
not the constables will bear the loss, at the con
stable seldom receives the entire per cent nl
lowed for collection.
The State has assumed its share of tho direct
tax imposed by the general government, ntnou ti
ling to $211,000 less 15 per cent, nnd will pay
tho lamo Into the Treasury of the United Stales,
Consequently this lux is not lo be nsscsscd and
collected in the manner provided by the United
States for the collection of taxes in the Slates
that do not assume their rcspeclivo quotas of
this tax, but is to be paid out of any moneys
in tho Treasury not other wiso appropriated.
Hence the State tax of 50 per cent covers all
the taxation, except local taxes, for the ensuing
year.
Good, Hr.TTF.n, Df.st. The capture of those
nrch-traltors, Mason nnd Slldell, was an act
that sent n thrill of joy through the heart of
overy Union man in the country, nnd caused
its pulsations to llirob with n quicker and
stronger beat. It is still further gratlljing to
learn thai the President approves nnd thut
Congress applauds the act, and recognize in the
chief actor a man who decries well of bis
country. Hut it is best nnd most fitting of all
that Mason and Slldell should be held ns host
nges for tho treatment of two of our gallant
Colonels who are in the hands of the enemy ns
prisoners of war, nnd who two confined in
felons' cells. These old, purse-proud aristo
crats, who have long lorded it over their fellows,
nnd who, in attempting to lord It over the
country and failing therein, labored to get up
the present rebellious attitude of the South,
nrc to be treated in nil respects as our men are
treated by tho rebels.
Only think of James M. Mason in n Yankee
jail, nnd of John Slidell where he ought to
have been years ago if reports do not lie the
Knvoys Kxtraordinary and Ministers Plenipo
tentiary to Kngland nnd France sleeping on the
soft side of an oak plank with nn nnti-phlogistic
diet of brcud and water. Well, it is altogether
tho best use tho old traitors weie ever put to
this protecting the lives nnd health of our
brave men in the power of the enemy.
TilK Cavamiy Kr.aiMr.ST didn't go last
week as advertised; and it isaltogether uncer
tain when tho boys will leave. It may be that
they arc not wanted at Washington, and it may
be that somebody is making "a big thing" nut
of the job of furnishing rations lor men nnd
horses. The regiment looks well, but looks
change, nnd it is barely possible that it may
look like nn unmitigated humbug before the
Winter is over. It is reported there is a strong
probability that the regiment will be qunrtered
in the State nil Winter. Perhaps they will be
retained ns a reserve force until our Northern
frontier is assailed.

geant. Mr. Smith had nearly tho whole charge
ol fitting out the Oth Kegiment, and bus been

that duty has proved him lo bo 1111 energetic
and capable business man. Mr. HurMmv was

and gentlemanly deportment, the refpect and

In treasonable politic, monthly obituaries

Village Moating.
The annual meeting of the corporation of the
Village of Hrnl tlcliorn, was held at tho Town
Hall Monday evening. The past year has been
one of comparative freedom from expenses, tho
village officers have given general satisfaction,
nnd there bns been no exciting cause for pas
sion or purjtidlce 1 consccquently the meeting
was not so largely attended ns usual, and the
board of officers were elected unanimously, as
follows!

During the year past there has been but one
or two alarms of fire, we believe, nnd these were
of no great account. Tho Chief Kngineer re
ports that the Kngines nro in excellent condi
tion 1 that tho Hook & Ladder apparatus isun
wieldly nnd inconvenient for use, nnd that an
nppropiialion of $150 to nut tho same in nn ef
fective condition is necessary) and that all the
Cisterns, except tho one at the junction of Main
and Klliot streets nro in good order.
Tho direct expenses of the Tire Department
during the jcar, including Ihe pny of the men
nt $100 each, have been as follows:
Engine Co. Xo. 3, (54 men, $08,31
Do Xo. 1, 88 men, 125,;)1
Hook & Ladder Co., 12 men, 30, 40
Expenses of Kepaiiing Cisterns 21,00
" " Limps 0,00
The other expenses of the village, ncaily all
of which are chargeable tn tho same Department,
nnd include rents, repairs, Sit., amounted to
$G18,ofi making the etltiro umount expended
$91)0,57, leaving n balance in the treasury of
forty-six cents. This sum was provided for by
the 10 per cent tax of last jcar.
Tho umount to be raised thu current year for
village purposes, is 5 per tent on the Grand
List, which will vield nearly $500 a sum suf
ficient, it is believed, to meet the ordinary ex
penses of the village. The matter of building
new cisterns was passed over.
iNcr.NlilAlusM. The dwelling house, lmin
nnd other out-buildings on the place commonly
known ns Ihe "Mixer Farm," situated nhnut
two miles west of tho village of We t llrnttle
horo, were discovered lo bo on fire nbout four
o'clock Saturday Morning, X'ov. 30, and weie
entirely consumed with nil their contents before
assistance could bo rendered for their preserva
tion. Upon examination it appeared that there
were tracks in Ihe newly fallin snow of ahorse
leading to and from the piemises, which tracks
were followed over ihe hills nnd on cross roads
until they struck the stage road toFuvetteiillc,
and thence to the house occupied by Thomas
Manning, about n mile north of this village.
In Manning's barn his horse was found quite
wet except such portions as had been covered
with a saddle or blanket and the bridle, indica
ting that the nnitnnl had been but recently
used. Tho title to the aforesaid farm vested in
said Manning, who n few weeks since was
placed under guardianship as a spendthrift, but
there was a riiortgnge on tho premises of $2000,
and the policy of insurance was in favor of the
morlgagec. From these and olhcr collateral
circumstances, including threats made by Man
ning, be was arrested for setting fire to the
buildings with intent to defraud the insurance
company, and after nn examination before
Charles K. Field, Ksq., wns held to nnswer be
fore the grand jury therefor, in the sum of
$500, in default of which he was committed to
the county jail. The insuiance on the build
ings and contents was $800, in thu Farmer's
Mutual, which will fully cover all the loss.
Li;ttkb. rnoM A PisIsonf.ii From n private
letter written by Corporal CltAlti.r.s It. Kick of
Company C, 2nd Vermont Kegiment, nnd dat
ed nt Kichmond, Va., Xov. 11th, we learn that
Private Kdward P. Gilsou of the same compa
ny, died in the General Hospital at Kichmond,
Oct. 12. He had been sick a long time with
dysentery and was very low spirited which help
ed to shorten his davs. Streeter, Graves nnd
Wheeler are in the prison at Kichmond, but
they had not been seen by Kicc since the 21st
of July. Of himself Corporal Kicc thus wriles:
"You may be surpi ised to hear that my wound
i tint as well as it was when I wruto jou last,
although it is better than it was three weeks
ago. Five weeks since my leg was almost heal
ed nnd bid fair to be well in n week, but in a
few days gangrene made its appearance, and in
a short time my wound was much worse than it
ever had been. It is is impossible to describe
the pain I endured for three weeks, but I am
much better now as the gangrene has disap
peared and my wound is healing. 1 still keep
my bed as I nin quite weak. I am in the gan
grene hospital which is kept quite neat and
cdean. There are only 13 patients here at pre
sent, and all but one or two arc improving fist.
The surgeon that has charge of us very suc
cessful with this disease."
SiNClNn-Sciinoi.. The term of lessons in
singing, under charge of Prof. Kimball, closes
on Wednesday evening of next weekt upon
which occasion the classes will give a freo pub
Ho reheat sal in the Tow n Hall. The school has
been eminently successful in point of numbers,
there having been more than one hundred
scholars in nttenda cc upon the two classes;
and a good degree of advancement in tho tnu
sieul art is apparent with both juveni'es and ad
ults. A general wish has been expressed that
another term of lessons should succeed the pre
sent, in which further progress may be made by
the old pupils, while new ones can also parti
cipate. Those who chooic lo attend this sec
ond course, will find a list of pupils at Felton's
book store.

being the only company that will be recruited
for that special branch of the service, those who

Louisvnxr, Ky., Dec. 2.
Southern papers to the 2Sth silt, contain
scattered accounts of the Fort Pickens affair.
The bombardment commerced on the 21st
and continued with occasional interruptions
night nnd day until the 21th, when Col. Drown
ceased firing. The rebels did not respond un
til after Fort Pickens opened fire. The fire of
the fort nnd thu outside Santn Kosa Island bat
teries was iliiected against Fort Ilarrnncas and
the other rebel Inltcries, thu rebel steamers
'time nnd Xelms and the Navy Yaid, while the
Federal vessels engaged Fort Mcltae.
The rebels admit 10 killed nnd wounded.
Considerable damage was done to Foit McKne,
including ihe caving in of the powiier maga
zine, and Ihe partial destiuction of the Xavy
YariUnd Warrington. A rebel train hauling
provisions in the rebel army was destroved.
The icbels seemed to be strictly on the defen
sive. The stories about disabling the Colorado
and Niagara appear to be unfounded. '1 he steam
ers Time and Nclms weie somewhat damaged
but finally got out of the reach of Col. Drown's
fire. Coi. Drown lcceived no leinforcements.
Tho InTasion cf GcorRin.
The mvy depaitment is in receipt of n dis
patch fiom Cap'. Diipnnt, containing the rcpoit
of Commander John lingers, of the Pucnhoii- j
tas, dated Sunday, November 21, off T.vbee!
Island, slating that on that mnining, hy n'ribr
of Cap. Dupont, be arrived, wilh a detachment
of the squadron off Savannah river, and on ap
proaching llu fortifications 011 Tjliee Island,
which consisted ni a marieuo tower nnd sluing

the forci: of the enemy, he proceeded to throw
a few shells into the fortifiratiuns, to which
thcie was 110 reply, and thereupon sent his boats
uith n fnrcu to tuUe posiMiin, itnd found thu
place entirely evacuated. He states that this
point entirely contiols the ship channel to the
Savannah river, which is mil) within five hun
dred vards of the fori, and the possession of 1
it, to use Commander Kogcrs' own expression,
close the harbor of Savannah "as tight as a
cork," and that Foil Pulaski is nt the mercy of
our forcis the moment the Litter desire to take
it. Also thai reliable accounts informed him
that Savannah was being evacuated by the peo
ple as fast ns possible, fearing, prob'ably, that
Commander Kiyers would attempt to taiv pos
session of it. He further states that Commo
dore Talnall, of the rebel fleet, had given it ns
hisrninion that the entire repel defenses of thu
Southern coast must be adaudoned, as they
cannot stand the armament of our fleet.
Great FiEht Expostpd at Columbus.
A great battle is probable at Columbus, Ky.
'Ihe rebels rightly coiistdei' it the key of their
position on the Mississippi, and if they are driv
en from it they will find it dillieull to make a
stand nt any point bdow. . Large reinfoicc
ments ar' chilly arriving from the South, togeth
er with heavy batteries, ammunition, kc. The
timber for miles around has been cut down and
is being used in the construction of immense
breastworks and fortification. Kvery coin
mauding and defensible point is being thorough
ly fortified, Thcie arc now, it is said, 50,000
troops between Columbus and Memphis. A
St. Louis letter in the Cincinnati Knquiter says:
"Gen. Halleck and Com. Foote lire fully post
ed, and do not design making the attack urrtil
they are well prepared fur a successful issue.
They expect a fierch contest, and will bring in
to the engagement 75,000 men, ten gunboats
nnd a large number of field batteries. It will
be two or thiee weeks before the forward move
ment will take place, but when made it will be
one of the brilliaiil maneuvers of the campaign.
My secrsh friend is sanguine of the success of
the confederate aims, and the ultimate capture
of Caiio. Paducah, I.miisviilc and St. Louis.
The confederates will bring into action at Col
umbus, several of their iion-plated gunboats,
now on their wu) up from New Orleans. They
will also have on hum! a large number of traps',
port steamers, so that in ease of defeat of the
federal forces Ihev can pursue our retreating ar
my to Cairo) if they are defeated, that their re
treat toward Memphis can be expedited. At
Memphis there arc also innumerable fortifica
tions, the entire city being protected by 11 hea
vy wall of cotton, with small opening's for in
gress and egi ess. At these openings sentinels
ure stationed, nnd nobody can pass out without
a special permit. In the' tear of the city inula
hove and below are a number of redoubts nnd
fortifications. Tho ciliens of Memphis feel
themselves snfe from invasion, although Ihey
entertain tho conviction that if Columbus is re
duced and Ihe confederate army defeated, there
and at Hickman, an attack on Memphis will
speedily follow."
Important Order Itospoatlns Enllstmonts.
A most important order will soon be issued
from hcadquaitcrs, informing the Governors of

Cavalry.
"Carleton," tho well informed correspondent
of the Doston Journal, in wilting from Wash
ington thus speaks of cavalry.
Your readers will remember that Gen. Scott
was not much in favor of cavalry except for
scouting purposes t but the service rendered by
the rebel cavalry at the close of Ihe battle of
Dull Kun, which w;as greatly magnified, started
11 tide of public sentiment in favor of that arm
of Ihe service. Keceut events, however, have
.shaken the faith ol ome if those who have
strongly advocated nn incre.isu of cavalry.
The disastrous skirmish of Wednesday shows
that Gen. Scott's views were well founded.
lie maintained that c.ivalry could be of no
great service only nftcr long training 1 that It
wns not reasonable lo cxpt-ct much from raw
horses nnd men 1 that under fire the men would
have quite ein.ugh to do lo lake cu e of them
selves and their horses. In the skirmish near
Vienna the horses were badly frightened and
lliu whole force was thrown into complete con
fusion. As an offset to this wc b ivn the gallant
charge of c.valryat Springfi.dd, Missouri. Af.

It is suipiiiiig that papers which support the
iidminislraliou should continue to misrepresent
t lie eh irncler and effect of the Morrill tariff.
Undoubtedly much foriign hostility lias been
excited, not by the tariff itself, but by the mis
representations of it, some of them iuteiestcd
nnd malicious, and some of them only ii'imraiit.
We have more than once, and at considerable
length, defended the revenue laws of the coun
try us compared with tlioe of Kuroue, nnd we
do not propose to go over the ground again.
llie existing taritl, whether good or bad, is low
er in its rales, simpler in its details, and more
leberal in its provisions, than the oriil's of the
countries whose hostility towards it his been
excited by misrepresentations nt home. It is
the lowest tariff of its predecessors except the
tariff of 1857, which was so inadequate to the
w ants of llie government thai it piled up a debt
ol $80,000,1)00 in four years, and the public
credit ran so low that money lor the absolute
needs of the treasury could be hired only at
twelve per cent.
What would tho objectors have? Would
they have us go on with tho revenue svstcm
that welded onlv three-o'iatlers the ordinal v ex
penses of llie government? The tariff of l.S JG
vielded loo lame a revenue, nnd the tariff ot
1857 was enacted to cut it clown. The tariff of
1857 ) aided too little a revenue, and llie turiff
of 1801 was enacted to ! ling it up. llie rates
are between those of 1810, which were found
too .HL-h, nod tlmse of 1857. which were found
loo low. If it is not right, it can be temedied j
unci if the men who denounce it will devise a
plan whereby the ordinary expenses of thcerov
eminent cm' lie met by llie duties on imports,
leaving the wnr expenses to be met by loans
nnd extraordinary taxes, they need havo no ap
prehension concerning its nnmedi'ite auojition
This would be belter employment than in d
pouncing our own eovernment and, inflaminjj
the hostility of the commercial nations against
us. And if they are not equal to a task which
they buuie others lor not nccomptisbing, ine
part of patriotism, for the present, would be si
leiicc. I'rurideui e Jam nnl.
