A dispatch from Memphis to the

in Arkansas. Tho Liu la Hock Demo

The Navy Department is in receipt of
a dispatch from Captain Dupont, con
taining tho report of Commander John
Rogers, of tho Pocahontas, dated Sun
day, November 2jth, ofTTybee Inland.
lie states this point entiruly control
the ship channel to the Savannah river,
which is only within 500 yards of the
fort, and tho possession of it closes the
harbor of Savannah, and that Fort I'u
luski is at the mercy of our forces the
moment the latter desire to take it.
Also, that reliable accounts inform him
that Savan nali was being evacuated by
the people a fast as possible, fearing
that Commander Holers would attoinpt
to take possession of it. He further
tates that Coin. Tatnall, of tho rebel
fleet, had given it as hid opinion that
tlm entire rebel defences of tho South
ern coast must ba abandoned, as they
could not stand tho armament of our
fleet.

New Yobk, Nov. 30. The United

Commander Dupont had transferred his

sunk two vessels between Tybeo Inland
and Fort Pulaski, in tho narrow part
of Savannah river, to prevent tho Fed

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.

in to Congreeion Tuesday, nnd im
mediately tele graphed to tho princ'i-
pal oiti.'s, B,p, i-fin in full in the pa
pers r.r Wcdntslny morii'.ng. It Is a
tf'nsrkably brief, plain nnd business
like document, being less than half tho
usual length of Presidents' Messages. Its
brevity is a most cominen lablo merit,
which iho people generally, and tho
newspapers particularly, will net fail to
appreciate.
Wo nre unaldo to give the entire doc
ument this week, but present n full sy
nopsis of its most important points.
The Message opens as follows:
I'rllnw ritizrns nf fi" S' ivite tuitl House
of Jitjrr$r)ttittic( s:
In the midst of unprecedented polit
ical troubles, wo have causo of great
gratitude to (iod for unusual good health

RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN NATIONS.
You will not be surprised to lesrn
tint in the peculiar exigencies of tho
times our intercourse! with foreign na
tions has been attended with profound
solicitude, chiefly turning upon our own
donicstio nffairs.
A disloyal portion of the American
peoplu have, during tho wliolo year,
been ennjcd in on attempt to divide
and destroy the Union. A nation which
endures factious domestic divisions is
exposed to disrespect abroad, and nno
party or both is suro, sooner or later, to
invoko foreign intervention.
Nations thus tempted to interfero aro
not always able to resist the counsols
of seeming expediency uad ungenerous
ambition, although measures adopted
under such influences seldom fail to be
unfortunate and injurious to those
adopting them.
The disloyal citizens of tho United
States, who have offered the ruin of our
country in reward for the aid and com
fort which they havo invoked abroad,
have received less pntronago nnd en
couragement than they probably ex
pected. If it were just to suppose, as tho in
surgents havo seemed to assume, that
foreign nations in this case, disregard
ing all moral, social and treaty obliga
tions, would act solely and selfishly
for the most speedy restoration of com
merce, including spocially tho acquisi
tion of cotton, those nations appear not
yet to havo seen their way to thoir ob
ject more directly or clearly through
the destruction than through tho pre
servation of the Union.
If wo couM dare to believe that for
eign nations are actuated by no hi'hor
priuciplo than this, I am quito sure a
sound argument could be mado to show
them, that they could reach their aim
woro rapidly und easily by aiding to
crush this rebellion than by giving en
couragement to the principal lever ro
licd on by tha exciting of foreign na
tions to hostility against us, as already
intimated, io tho embarrassment of
cotnmorco.
Those nations, however, not improb
ably, saw fiom the first that it was the
Unian which mado as well our foreign
as our domestic commerce.
They can scarcely fail to perceive
that tho effort for disunion produces
the existing difficulty, and that ono
strong nation promises more dur-i'dr
peace, nnd a more extensive, valuable,
and reliible commerce, than can the
samo natioa broken into hostile frag
ments. It is not mv purpose to review our
discussions with foreign States, because,
whatever mL'ht bo their wishes, or dis
positions, tha integrity of onr Govern
ment mninly depends, not upon them,
but upon the loyalty, patriotism, virtue
and iritolligenco of the American people.
The correspondence itse'f. with the
usual reservations, is herewith submit
ted. I venture to hope it will Mppear
that wo havo practiced prudence and
liberality toward foroin powers, avert
ing causes of irritation, and with firm
ness miutainiug our own rights and
honor.
OUR COAST DEFENCES.
Since, however, it is apparent, that
hero, as in every other Stato, foreurn
dangers necessarily attend domestic dif
(jeiiltiep, I recommend that adequate
and ample meassires ho adopted for
maintaining tho pnhlin defences on ev
ery sido. While under this general
recommendation, provision for defend
ing our coast lino reudily oceuis to the
mind.
I also, in the same connection, sk
tho attention of Congress to our great
lakes and rivers. It is believed that
somo fortifications and depots of arms'
nnd munitions, with harbor and nnvi
"af'un improvements af well selected
-'. , , r,
reints upon these, would Loot great',

WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THE CONFISCATED
SLAVES?
In regard to tho disposition to bo
made of slaves of rebels forfeited under
tho provisions of the Confiscation act, tho
President makes tho following sugges
tions: Under and by villus of l.ho act of
Congress, entitled "an act to confiscate
property used for insurrectionary pur
poses, approved August Gih, 18(11," la
gal claims of curtain persona to tho la
bor and service of ce.rtaiu other persons,
have becomo forfeited; and numbers of
tho latter thus liberated aro already do
pendent, on tho United States and must
bo provided for in somo way. Pesides
this it is not, impossible that, somo of
tho States will pass nimi!ar enactments
for their own benefit respectively, and
by tho operation of which, persons of
the same class will bo thrown upon them
for disposnl. In such case, I recom
mend that Congress provide for Accept
ing such persons from such States ac
cording to some mode of valuation, in
"lii u ro twili" of direct taxes; or upon
somo other plan to be agreed on with
such States respectively; that such per
sons on sneh acceptance by the General
Government bo at onco deemed free;
and that in any ovent, steps bo taken
for colonizing, with classes, or the one
first mentioned, if tho othor shall not
bo brought into expedience, in some
place or places in n climate congenial
to them. It might be well to consider,
too, whether tho free colored people al
ready in the United States eonl.l not, so
far as individuals may desire, be inclu
ded in Buidi colonization. To carry out
tho plan of colonization may involve
tho acquiring of territory, and also the
appropriation of money beyond that to
bo cxpeuded in tho territorial acquisi
tion. Having practiced tho acquisition of
territory for nearly fifty years, tho ques
tion of Constitutional power to do so. is
no longer an open ono with us. The
power was first questioned by Mr Jef
ferson, who, however, in tho purchase of
Louisiana, yielded his scruples on tho
plea of great expediency. If it bo laid
that tho only legitimate object of acqui
ring territory is to furnish homos for
white men, this measure effects that ob
ject for the emigration of colored men,
and leaves additional room for white
men remaining or coming here. Mr.
JcfTcrsnn, however, placed the impor
tance of purchasing Louisiana) more on
political and commercial grounds than
on providing room for population. On
this whole proposition, including tho
appropriation of money, with tho acqui
sition of territory, does not tho expe
diency amount to absolute necessity
that without which tho Government
cannot bo perpetuated?
POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWARD
THE REBELLION.

. . , , , , , ,
I hered to tho blockade of tho ports held
On the general subject of tho rebel
lion, and tho means adopted for its sup
pression, the President says:
In considering the policy to be adopt
ed for suppressing the iusurreotion. I
havo been anxiou.1 and careful that the
inevitable conflict for this purpose shall
not degenerate into a violent and re
morseless revolutionary strugglo. I
havo heretofore iu every ease thought
it proper to keep tho integrity of the
Union prominent na the primary object
of the cutitest on our part, leaving all
questions winch are not of vital military
importance, to tho moro deliberate ac
tion of tho legislature. In tho oxer-
ciao of my best discretion, I hsve ad-
by the insurgents, instead of putting in
force by proclamation the law of Con
gress enacted af, the lato session for
closing those ports. Also, obeying tho
dictate of prudence, as well as tho ob
ligations of t bo law, instead of trans
cending, I havo adhered to tho act of
j Congress to confiscate property usod
for insurrectionary purposes. It n now
I law upon tho same subject shall bo pro
posed, its propriety will ha duly consid
ered. Tho Union must be preserved,
and hence nil disposable means must bo
employed. ,
Wohheuld not bo in haste to deter
mino what radical and extreme meas
ures, which may reach the loyal ns well
as the disloyal, are indisptnsnldo.
The inaugural Address at the begin
ning of the Administration, and the
Mocsag'i In Congress at the Iste special
session, were both duvoled to tho domes
lio controversy out of which the rebel
lion and connequent war has sprung-!
Nothing now ficeurs to ud 1 or subtract

PROGRESS MADE TOWARDS SUPPRESSING
THE REBELLION.
The la-t ray of ' lioj o for preserving
tha Union pem oubly expired at the as
sault upon Fort tuiiiter, and a g. iieiiil
review of what has occurred hinco may
not be unprofitable.' What was painfull?
evident then is much hotter defjuod and
more distinct now, and thn pron ri of
events is plainly in the ri'ht direction.
The i nsu r ;nt i confi 1 Mitty elaimel
strong support from north of Mason
and Ditou's line, and fiends of tho
Union were n..t free fi oui apprehension
on this point. Thi ), however, wad aouu
settle. 1 definitely and on the richt side"
South nf tiia lino, tmblo littlo Delaware
led off ri.ht from tho fust. Maryland
Hs inadii.fi pcem against thn. Union.
Our" olJicvs wero assaulted, bridges
Were burned and railroads wero torn up
within her limits, nnd we were tunny
days at one time without the ability to
bring a single regiment over her soil to
tho capital. Now her bridges nnd rail
roads ore repaired ami opeiied to the
Government. Sho nlrcndy gives seven
regiments to tho cause of tho Union,
and none to the enemy, and her pooplo
at a regular cleetion luivo sustained Iho
Union by n, large majority, nnd a larger
aggregate vote than they ever before
gavo to any candidate on any question.
Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt,
is now decidedly , and I think unchange
ably, ranged on tho side of tho Union.
Missouri is comparatively quiet, nnd I
believo cannot bo overrun by tho insur
gents. These threo Slates, of Mary
land, Kentucky nnd Missouri, neither
of which would romiso n singlo soldier
nt first, have now an aggregate of not
less than 40,000 in thn field for the
Union, while of thoir citizens not more
than a third in number are among the
insurgents, und they of doubtful where
abouts and existence.
After a somewhat bloody struggle of
months, winter closes on the people of
Western Virginia, leaving them mas
ters of I heir own oountry. An insur
gent forco of about 1,500, for months
dominating tho narrow peninsular re
gion constituting tha counties of Aeco
luac and Northampton, nnd known as
the Eastern Shore of Virginia, together
with some contiguous parts of Maryland,
have laid down thoir arms, and the peo
ple there havo renewed their allegiance
to nr?l accepted the protection of the
old flag. This leaves no armed insur
rection north of tho Potomac, or liast of
the Chesapeake.
Also we havo obtained a footing nt
each of tho isolated points on the south
cm coast, of Hatteras, Port Koyal, Ty
beo Island, near Sava n nah, a '.id Ship
Island, and wo likewise havo noine gen
eral accounts of popular movements in
behalf of tho Union in North Carolina
and Tennessee. These things demon
strate that thn cause of the Union is ad
vancing steadily southward.
VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS.
The President recommends tho im
mediate construction of a railroad to
connect Kentucky with tho loyal por
tions of Tennessee and North Carolina;
tho recognition of tho independenco of
Ilayti anil Liberia; also somo leiala-
tion by Congress to cnublo citizens of
loyal States to collect dabts ofcitizons of,
rebel States, in portions of Gio latter
whero the Federal power may bo To-established;
also a ro-orgnnjzation of the
Supremo Court, and of tho Navy, ren
dered necessary by a due regard to the
puhlio interests.'
Tho Presfdcut notices tho retirement
of Gen, Scott, and recommends Con
gress to make a suitablo acknowledg
ment of his distinguished services. Tho
Message concludes as follows:
From the first taking of our national
census to tho last, ore seventy years,
and wo find our population nt tho end
of the period eight times as great as it
was at the beginning. Tho increaso in
other things which men deem desirably
has been even greator. Wo thus have
at ono view what tho popular principle)
applied to Uovornment through tho
machinery of the States and the Union
bay produced in a given timo, and also
what, if firmly maintained, it promises
for the future. There oru already nmoii"
us those who, if the Union bo preservod,
will live to see it contain 2."0, 000,000.
Tho strugglo of to-day is not altogother
tor to day; it is fi r a vast futnro uls".
lth u firm reliance on Providence, oil
the more firm and earnest, let us pro
ceed in the great tank which ovents
huve devolved upon us.

Tho 2 Mi Ohio passed down tho river
to Louisvillo last week, and is now in
Keutucky. Tho Cincinnati Gazette
says that tho Lieut. Colonel and Major
of tho regiment have botn resigned, for
what reason is not stated.
The 12th Ohio is elill in Western
Virginia, nnd it is now thought will be
assigned winter quarters at Charleston.
Capt. Sloans arrived at home on
Monday evening of last week, having
resigned his captaincy. It will bit re
membered that Captain S. had ono of
his legs broken and was otherwise so
vorcly injured a few years Bine, by be
ing thrown from a lugpy. Although
the broken limb healed without causing
ljIUnfls. h always bn weak since
the accidont, and during his recent
arduous mjlitary scrvieo has troubed
him greatly, in tho rough marcho
which he hag boon compelled to make
on loot. ' for this reason ho reluctant
ly tenderod Ms resignation, which was
but recently accepted. While wo wel
come the gallaut Captain back to his
home nnd friends, we most regret the
necessity, which has deprived the coun
try of his future services in the war, in
which ha had already acquitted himself
so honorbly, and given such promise of
distinction. It is his intention, we be
lieve, to resume tho practico of the
law.
