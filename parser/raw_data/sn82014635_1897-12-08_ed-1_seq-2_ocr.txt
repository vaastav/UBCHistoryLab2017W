PJedfre In the Message as Spanlshly
Constrned, While Dtterlns Warnlnc
That the United States Shall Never Even
, Indirectly Interfere Cuban Junta
Officers Kcad Into the Message All
Hope for Cuba.
Havana, Dec. 7. El DIarlo De La
Marina, commenting' upon President
McKinleyy message to congress, says:
"It contain impressive, declarations
calculated to strengthen, were that nec
essary, the Spanish cause in the island
of Cuba. It will dishearten the separa
tists. Facts are always the most ener
getic and decisive arguments; and the
facts in the presidential message can
not be any less satisfactory to tihe Span
iards than the American legislation. Ac
cording to the .solemn statements of the
American chief magistrate to the Ameri
can congress, there is no reason that
will justify American intervention in
the Cuban question. This undobted fact
is confirmed by the executive of the
American TJron.
"In view of the absolute sovereignty
of Spain over Cuba, and of the absence
of such conditions as would entitle the
insurgents to claim recognition as
belligerents, facts acknoweldeged in the
president's message, as was to be ex
pected, because reason, justice and
right required, -we -protest with all our
energy against declarations aiming to
show that the "United States would 'be
justified in assuming another attitude in
certain contingencies In the future.
"Such declarations may be intended,
as they probably aie, to console the
jingoes for their failure, -but there is not
a Spaniard who will net snow his In
dignation at all suci suggestions.
"Spain, in any event, will repel any
demonstration looking to the inteiven
tion of a foreign state in affairs abso
lutely her own; and the United States
shall never, under any consideration,
take even an indirect part in the settle
ment of our particular concern."
El Pais, the organ of the Autonomists,
thinks the message very favorable to
the interests of Cuba, and believes that
the attitude that President .McKinley
assumes "will calm the fury of the
partisans of independence."
It adds:
"The radical change in Spanish policy,
the establishment of autonomy and 'the
release of political prisoners is working
a. rapid and most surprising transforma
tion. It demonstrates that Spain, while
resolved to maintain iter sovereignty at
any cost, to put 3pwn the rebellion and
to destroy the forces that support It, will
use also the practical arguments- that
must appeal to the "sympathy of the
American people."
COTTNTER-CLAIMS OP CUBANS.
New York, Dec. 7. T. Estrada Palma,
representative of the Cuban provisional
government in the United States, com
menting upon President McKinley's
message, according to the Herald, says:
"I did not expect any recommenda
tion to congress for immediate action
but the president -has left congress to de
cide the time within which an enduring
peace must be established in Cuba and
intimates the necessity of haste by the
use in this connection of the failure of
Spain to pacify Cuba with the scheme
of autonomy, American Interests, hu
manity and civilization will demand
forcible intervention. As .Captain Gen
eral Blanco himself -admits that the Cu
bans In arms will not accept autonomy,
the time the president speaks of has
arrived.
"It -will be noticed 'that The president
does not even suggest the acceptance of
autonomy by the Cubans and it is evi
dent he would not have written the last
paragraph in the terms he did if he be
lieved that autonomy would bring peace
to Cuba."
Mr. Senjamin Gi'berga, formerly a
merchant of this city, but at present
connected with the Cuban delegation
and a brother of Senor Eliseo Giberga,
the Cuban senator, said to a reporter:
"The granting of autonomy to Cuba
by Spain proclaims to the world the jus
tice of the Cuban rebellion and the right
the Cubans had to appeal to arms, since
only through force would Spain have
been compelled to grant to Cuba wnat
is but a mere semblance of home rule.
But it is too late, even for the most am
ple iform of autonomy, which is not what
Spain is ready to concede. Spain's au
tonomy will 5e suah in name only and
for the exclusive use of the residents of
the -ports and of the few interior towns
hold by the Spaniards. The Cuban pa
triots now in arms, who are the only
ones to decide, will never accept au
tonomy; they have declared it time and
again; they are fignting for absolute in
dependence and the offer of autonomy
they consider a plain avowal by Spain
that her cause is lost.
"At the beginning of the war, when
Marshal Martinez Campos suggested re
forms for Cuba, a prominent (Madrid
newspaper replied to him, voicing public
opinion, that they would send to Cuba'
'notreforms, but guns.' General TVeyler
went soon after to Cuba to cany out
the policy then in vogue. Xow, when
all Spaniards see Spain's cause is irre
vocably lost, as she has no money and
no credit, no more men to nd to Cuba
and is threatened with a Carlist war at
home, besides that waged against her
in the Philippines, they are exceedingly
anxious for the- Cubins to accept au
tonomy. "Why did they refuse it before?

strong and invincible. TVhy do they of
fer it now? Because they are convinced
of their defeat. This is aN signal victory
for the Cuban arms, since through force
Spain concedes at present what she for
merly refused to grant willingly.
"Spain desires to end the war in
Cuba quickly, bat she can only do so
by acknowledging the independence of
the island. Never before was Cuba so
strongr as she is now. Spain "has never
been so weak since the war began. It is
ridiculous to ask the Cubans to give up
when victor', final and decisive, is about
to crown their efforts."
THE MESSAGE IN MADRID.
Madrid, Dec. 7. The cabinet today
considered dispatches from Senor De
Lome, "Spanish minister at Washington,
containing extracts from President Mc
Kinley's message to congress. The min
isters agreed in considering the mes
sage generally favorable to Spain. Its
tone has produced a good effect in offi
cial circles, but Jt is pointed out that
"the paragraphs relating to the alleged
rights of the United States to intervene
in the Cuban question are calculated to
displease the Spanish people."
The message pleasantly surprised the
majority of Spaniards, who hardly ex
pected that President McKInley would
go so far in his approval of the new col
onial policy or ihis recognition of Spain's
right to be allowed the time necessary
to carry out the same.
They are especially satisfied to see the
United States executive state so power
fully the precedents in International
law regarding belligerency and disclaim
any intention of interfering with Spain's j
rights. They are less satisfied with the
censure passed on the previous colonial
policy, and with the contention that the
United States has tried to check filibus
tered. The council, however, has noted with
satisfaction "the fact that the message
affirms the amicable relations between
the two countries which, in -some quar
ters, were supposed to be endangered,
and tne respect expressed tor tne sin
cerity of Spain's initiative."
Spain declines to admit -this conten
tion, but on the -whole the prevalent im
pression, is that President McKinley's
attitude. Is more favorable than was
President Grant's In the former Cuban
insurrection.
Financial and political circles welcome
the -prospect of less tension between
Spain and the United States and of a
truce giving time to test the new policy.

London, Dec. 7. The St. James Ga
zette this afternoon, commenting upon
President McKinley's message says:
"It has disappointed everybody in the
attempt to give universal satisfaction.
President McKinley is in an unpleasant
position, having to lt on the fence. As
a whole, it looks like an early confession
of a great failure."
The Pall Mall Gazette takes a favora
ble view of the presidential message and
criticizes the comments of the Times, re
marking th2t it 5s as impossible "to deal
with the Cuban question without'Offend
Ing Spain as It Tvould be to deal with
Armenia without offending the sultan."
The Globe is of the opinion that it
"would have taxed the abilities even of
a great statesman," to deal with the
question satisfactorily, adding: "Al
though all the arguments against the
annexation of Cuba are equally applica
ble to Hawaii, the United States is de
termined to have the latter, though
America, a fourth-rate naval power as
it is, can only hold Hawaii on suffer
ance. In the event of war she would be
bundled out, neck and crop, by and first
rate power which finds it necessary to
occupy the island.
Paris, Dec. 7. The Bpublique Fran
caise today says the tone of President
McKinley's message to congress "is con
ciliatory, but not exempt from ambig
uity." The Journal Des Debats regards the
message as "little reassuiac.ee to Spain,
who has the world's sympathies." .
Berlin, Dee. 7. President McKinley's
message to congress ras beGn received
quietly here. I'ts conservatism is
praised.
Figaro declares that President Mc
Kinley's message is "act of war," and
says: "Should it pass from "words to
deeds, it is possible that Spain will not
sustain the ficht alone."

Pekin, Dec. 7. The Chinese govern
ment has caused it to be known that up
to the time of the German occupation of
Kiao-Chau bay no claim was made by
Germany for reparation as a result of
the murder of the-two missionaries, Nies
and Hennle, and that there were no oth
er differences between the two govern
ments. Consequently, the government of
China points out, the missionary ques
tion is regardes as a pretext to obtain a
naval station, which, it is shown, Ger
many has long coveted. Tne Chinese
government will never consent to the
Germans remaining at Klao-Chau bay as
their presence there deprives China of a
harbor which, since the war with Japan
has been regarded as the most suitable
naval base of operations.
Berlin, Dec. 7. Emperor "William has
ordered the number of volunteers for the
China expedition to be increased to 1,000
merr.
Prince Henry of Prussia will visit
Prince Bismarck at Fredericksruhe to
morrow and will spend several hours
with the great statesman, in order to ob

Dr. Stubel, the German consul at Shang
Hal, has been ordered to go to Kiao
Chau and establish a regular German
administration.
The Komische "Voiles Zeitung says that
the coal deposits in th eprovince of Shan
Tung, which will become available to
Germany with railway and mining con
cessions are most valuable.
London, Dec. 7. A special dispatch
from Shang Hai says:
On Friday last Captain Becker, with
310 German marines left Kiao-Chau bay
to occupy the surrounding villages,
whence they proceeded to capture the
city. The Chinese forts opened fire and
the Germans replied, killing three of the
garrison, which thereupon fled in disor
der. The Chinese general in command was
captured, but afterwards liberated. Sev
eral German soldiers were injured by
stones flung by inhabitants of the vil
lages. In return for this the head men
of these villages were beaten with bam
boo sticks by order of the German com
mander." It is reportedMiere'that China is will
ing to pay an indemnity of 1,000,000 taels
(about $785,260) and to grant all the Ger
man demands, including the temporary
cession of Kiao-Chau bay and adjoining
territory.' - - '
Adispatch to the Times from Peking
confirms the report that China, hoping
for the evacuation of Kiao-Chau, agrees
unconditionally to all demands of Ger
many. The Times, dealing editorially with the
situation at Kiao-Chau, notes that the
goregoing telegram enumerating the Ger
man demands does not include the per
points out that the evshrduletaoindlun
manent occupation of Kiao-Chau, and
points out that the evidence is conflict
ing as to whether this was officially de
manded. It says:
"In any case, now that the other de
mands have been conceded, what will be
the groundsfor insisting upon a perman
ent occupation? The double success in
Hayti and China, demonstrating the
practical value of a strong fleet Teady to
act at short notice in any part of the
world, woll probably give a coup de grace
to the clinging opposition to the naval
bill.
HAYTI CBINCES TO GERMANY
And the Incident of Herr Sneder's Impris
onment Is Abont Settled
Pert Au Prince, Dec. 7. The trouble
between Germany and Hayti appears to
be settled. The Haytian government
has saluted the German flag and the for
eigners -who had sought refuge on board
ships in the harbor have returned to
their home3.
It is understood that the question of
indemnity demanded by Germany for
the alleged illegal arrest and Imprison
ment o fHerr Lueders has been settled
to the satisfaction of Germany and that
all the demands of that country have
been agreed to by the government of
Hayti in the face of the display of force
made by Germany and under the threat
of a bombardment of the defensive works
of the port unless these demands were
agreed within the eight hours following
the time the German ultimatum was de
livered yesterday morning, shortly af
ter the arrival at this port of the two
German cruisers sent to back up the de
mands of the German minister here.
Tne fir.?t part of the settlement took
place at 6 o'clock last night, when the
Hytian fleet formally saluted the Ger
man flag from the flagship of the fleet of
Hayti, the Crete A. Pierrot, a smell ves
sel armed with a few guns of light cali
bre. Admiral Kfiyek, the Haytian comman
der, "had charge of the formal salute of
the German flag. While "the flag of the
republic was being dipped on board the
Crete A. Pi eriot to the standard of Ger
many the band of the Haytian navy
played the German national anthem and
the Haytian flagship fired 21 gnns, which
were answered by the German flagship
Charlotte, which is used as a schoolsaip.
The second part of the settlement will
take place when Count Schwerin the
German minister to Hayti is formally
and solemnly received by the Haytian
officials. The iatter, it is understood,
have assured the German authorities
that summary justice will be promptly
meted out to those of the officials of

September 21, in a boarding house on
John "Wolfarth's farm, near here. Ac
companied by her 12-year-old son, she
