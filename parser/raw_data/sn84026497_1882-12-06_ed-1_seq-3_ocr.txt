Congress President's Message.
Congress met on Monday and about
the only buoinesa transacted was the
reading of the President's Message.
This document is very highly com
mended by the press of the country.
We have neither time nor ppace to
give it this week, but will endeavor
to lay it before our readers in the form
of a supplement next week.
And bow the English have a new
cause for complaint against Turkey.
It seems that it has been discovered that
the Turkish soldiers aro carrying on a
large contraband trade of tobacco. It
would be altogether too bad if the sol
diers should beat the English tax gath
erers out of a little cash by their sly
tricks.
The necessity for a special session of
the U. S. Senate after the 4th of March
next lies in this fuct : That as the term
of office of David Davis, who is now
the President of the Senate, will ex
pire on that day, unless the Senate is
called together and elects a successor,
there would be no one to act as Presi
dent of the United States in the event
of President Arthur's death.
The debt statement shows the exact
reduction of the public liability during
November to be $5,534,542. The cash
in the treasury is the comfortable little
sum of $287,867,113 The government
is still able to meet its obligations, and
therefore has no reason to be at all
anxious for the future. As every one
of ns is interested to a greater or less
extent in these euperbundant millions,
all naturally watch the monthly figures
closely and in their minds hold our
representatives to a strict accounta
bility. Derrick.
The Philadelphia Times thinks that
there will no longer be any uncertain
ty as to the meaning of the phrase "a
tariff for revenue only" should Demo
cratic advocates succeed in incorpo
rating it into the law. It would mean
the American market flooded with for
eign products, and the American man
ufacturers and producers of all grades
unable to compete, except by reducing
wages to the foreign level. It would
mean no new industries springing up,
and one after another of the old ones,
especially those of recent growth, suc
cumbing under the stress of foreign
competition, and yet this is the teast
to which the Times invited the people
of this country previous tj the elec
tion. "The ignorance of the editor of the
Republican is proverbial." Com
monweallh. And the prevarications
(not to call them by a plainer name)
of the manager of the Commonwealth
are legion. He said that it was "now
demonstrated beyond a doubt that the
next Congress will contain ten or
twelve Greenback Congressmen," and
we asked him to name one besides
Patton and Crumm, who were princi
pally elected by Democrats and Re
publicans respectively, and would vote
with those parties right along, where
upon ho took his penholder and after
stirring up the debris, found that out
in Iowa a poor disgruntled Democrat
Greenback fuBioniet bad been elected
over Updegraff, Republican, by a mis
erable majority. To show what part
the Greenbackers played in that elec
tion, it is only necessary to give the
vote in Updegraff's district, (which
Jasper says has "hertofore given about
6000 Republican majority" and which
is nearly three thousand of a prevari
cation,) at the last Congressional elec
tion, in 1880 ; it was as follows : Re
publicaus 17,359, Democrats 13,968,
Greenbackers 2,193. Don't it look
just a little bit absurd to see the latter
party claiming a victory in the face of
such figures?" Again; he claims the
election of Begole, Govornor of Mich
igan, as a Greenback victory, when in
reality that party had but 34,895 votes
in 1880, when it polled its biggest
vote, against 131,597 Deraocratio ;
pretty hard run, arn't you? And yet
the Commonwealth manager does not
scruple to asserts that "there will be
tea or twelve Greenback Congress
men in the next Congress." Now Jas
per, the editor of the Republican
may be very ignorant, but Le always
makes an honest endeavor to get as
near the truth as possible, and won't
auj don't btve to resort to lying to
bolster up Lis party.
,t. E. WKSK, -
Beginning of the Harvest.
It is to bo expected that parties who
took great interest in the election of
Pattison and a democratic congress
will deny that the fear of tho advent
of that party into power has caused
the stagnation in the manufacture of
steel rails. Indeed, it would not be
surprising to find tho inauguration of
an absolute free trade policy followed
by a stout assertion that the resultant
destruction ot the iron interest had
nothing whatever to do with it. The
Pittsburgh Dispatch which labored so
efliciently in the Pattison viucyard,
has published several interviews with
manufacturers of steel rails, for tho
purpose of explaining awBy the reduc
tion of prices in that branch of indus
try. Mr. E. F. Ilartfield, president
of the Lackawaca Iron and Coal com
pany, says: "The question of tariff
has nothing whatever to do with it."
The same gentleman in the same in
terview when asked : "Has an antic
ipated reduction of tho tariff on steel
rails anything to do with the present
low prices?" replied : "Only so far as
causing railroad companies to hold
back from buyiag, in the hope of get
ting lower prices if tho tariff is re
duced." Here we have the whole truth con
firmed by one who is tr)ing his best
to hide it. How could a democratic
success affect the price of a protected
product except to induce buyers to
hold off for lower prices in the hope
that the tariff on that product would
be reduced by the success? The pro
fessions of democratic sympathy with
a tariff for protection are not believed
by anybody. That complete demo
cratic control of all branches of the
national government would be followed
by such an adjustment of the duties
on imports as would beggar every
home industry which needs protection,
is firmly believed by every intelligent
American citizen, as well as by free
trade Europe. It is because of this
that democratic campaigns have been
supplied by British gold, a plan
considered by them to be so much
more honorable than contributions by
American office holders. We felt
this in the Tilden campaign, and the
plethoric pockets of the democratic
bosses, in the late campaign in this
State, makes it a reasonable supposi
tion that the hand ot the Free Trade
League scattered its British gold even
within the limits of Crawford county.
The Philadelphia North American,
one of whose owners, as the indepen
dent candidate for Congressman-at-Large,
helped elect a democrat to
that office, gives the following frank
opinion of the result of democratic
success : :
"Should the worst happen, the
misfortune will be largely attributable
to the success which the democrats
achieved at the late election. Of
course the fact that the democrats
have been placed in power is not the
only reason why the companies men
tioned are thinking about stopping
work. Several causes have combined
to lay upon them the necessity of
suspension. What alarms manufac
turers more than the skrinkage of the
demand and the decrease of prices is
the fact that a Congress has just been
elected which is hostile to the mainte
nance of the tariff, and that (he as
cendancy of the Democratic party is
the signal for an assault upon the sys
tem whoso protection alone the manu
facture of steel rails in the United
States can be carried on."
In this connection it will be of in
terest to the laboring man, irrespect
ive of politics, to know that the presi-'
dent of the Lackowana Iron and Coal
Co., in the interview from which we
have quoted above, says of the cheap
ening of Bteel rails : "It is true that
the present cost of production to us is
over $40 per ton, but wo hope to get
lower by some reduction in wages and
the cheapening of materials." We do
not know that the wages of steel work
ers is excessively high just now, but
rather incline to the opinion that it
is already too low.'but, as the manu
facturer cannot pay more for making
an article than he can sell it for, the
price he gets for it must control the
price he is able to pay for materials,
labor, Ac. This brings the question
of the tariff home to the laboring
man. It touches him in the tenderest
spot. It appeals to him by tho mouths
of bis wife and children. It is pro
tection and plenty against free trade
and fenury.Meadville Republican.

The exports of wheat and flour from
t!ie Atlantic ports in the week ending
November 22 were equal to 17,000,000
bushels of wheat against about 14,500,
000 in the preceding week. The pros
pects aro favorable for an increasing
foreign market for wheat in view of
the material reduction in the area of
the 1883 wheat cron in Endand. Pri-
ces in this; country are advancing and
the demand will very much increase

If two-cent postage is to be a success
in this country it will not he made so
by introducing canned fruits, potted
meats, dried prunes and other grocers'
supplies into the mails. Next we ex
pect to hear of bottled beer, Hoofland's
Bitters and Winslow's Soothing Syrup
going through at so much a pound.
The mail system is primarily for the
distribution of intelligence, and every
step beyond ought to be taken caq
tiously. Noth'ug but injury can nccrue
to our postal service by introducing
the business of express companies into
it. If the Government chooses to or
ganize a national system of expressago
for small packages, that is a wholly
different question, but that it should
open its mails to the transportation
from Portland Maine, to Portland,
Oregon, at 16 cents a pound, of all
sorts of provisions that can bo canned,
is a prostitution of the service, and can
only retard its progress. llarrisburg
