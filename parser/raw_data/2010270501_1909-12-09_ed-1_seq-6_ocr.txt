Situation, but Disposition Is to Let
President Taft Handle It.
Washington, Dec. C Tho ilrst reg
ular session ot tho Sixty-first cougiess"
owned today. Vice President Sher
man presided in the senate and Speak
er Cannon wielded the gavel In the
bouse.
Following a time-honored custom,
both houses adjourned soon after their
convening at noou out of respect to
the memory of those members who
have died during the recess of congress.
Senator Johnson of North Dakoi.
died several weeks ago and his suc
cessor already has been chosen and
probably will take the oath of office
tomorrow. Fountain L. Thompson of
Cando, N. D., the new senator, Is n
Democrat, although his predecessor
was a Republican. Senator Thomp
son was appointed by North Dakota's
new Democratic governor to fill out
Johnson's unexpired term, which ends
Jan. 1, 1911.
The deceaseu representatives aro
David A. De Armond of the Sixth Mis
souri district, who met death in a fire
which destroyed his home at Butler,
Mo., only a tew days ago, and Francis
R. Lasslter of the Koarth Virginia dis
trict. Succecaois have not yet been
elected In either district.
Tomorrow w.tll be devoted In both
bouses to the reading ot President
Taft's message to congress, and after
that the lawmakers should be able to
get down to business immediately, as
all the committee appointments and
other details of organization have
been completed.
Much Interest Is felt In the Nlca
raguan situation, hut tho general dis
position Is to permit the executive
branch to deal with It w,lthout legisl
ative interference, at least In the
present stage. Congressmen generally
express no apprehension as to thu out

auxiliary cruiser Dixie. It Is probable
that the latter vessel will get under
way today and continue to tho original
destination of the Prairie.
Two more vnln attempts were made!
to free the Prairie. Lighters had re
moved more than 800 tons of coal
ahd all the 800,000 rounds of ammu

warship did not budgo from the shoal
and when tho tide begun to recedo

OMMONS STARTS WAR ON PEER3
Votes Budget Rejection Was Usurpa
tion and Breach of Constitution.
London, Dec. 3. By a majority of
210, after a brief but exciting sitting,
the bouse of commons recorded its
claim to exclusive control of tho na
tion's purse a cinlm never before
challenged in modern times.
The vote wns taken on a resolution
offered by Premier Asqulth, which de
clared "thnt the action or the houso
of lords In refusing to pass Into law
PREMIER ASQU1TH.
the financial provisions made by tho
chamber for the expenses of tho year
was n breach of the constitution and
a usurpation of the rights of tho
house of commons."
The resolution wns passed by a vote
of 349 to 134. By this vote the oppos
ing forces of tho lords and commons
nre placed In battle array for ono of
the greatest constitutional struggles
that has come before the country's
Judgment for centuries.
The scenes of onthuBldshi which ac
companied the voting on Mr". Asqulth's
resolution wore in marked contrnst to
those witnessed during the recent de
bate in the house of lords.
No prominent member from tho gov
eminent side arose In the house of
commons to utter solemn warnings
against the course tho ministers were
pursuing. The ministerial ranks were
closed In a complete unanimity of pro
test against tho action of the lords.
LOST TRACK OF STEALINGS
Warrlner Can Only Account for Half
$643,000.
Cincinnati, Dec. 3. More than half
of the $043,000 which Charles L.
Warrlner, former local treasurer1 ot
the Big Four railroad, udmlts to havo
been stolen from the railroad, cannot
be accounted for. Tho Indicted treas
urer has furnished a statement, which
accounts for $318,000; $84,000 of which
he said was paid in blackmail, and
claims that tho balanco of $225,000
was lost in speculation.
According to Warrlner ho carried on
his stock market operations through
the New York brokerage firm of Hen
ry Clews & Co., but an examination of
the books of that concern shows thnt
In the entire course of his transac
tions with them he could not have
lost more than $17,000.
Tho question which still perplexes
tho railroad officials Is: "What be
came of the money?"
Tho gtand Jury resumed Its Inquiry
Into the case today.
