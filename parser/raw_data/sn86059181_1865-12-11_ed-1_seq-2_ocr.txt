Cent as of 1860 Barley.
The ": total product of Barley., in the
United States and Territories in 1860
r was 15,825,998 bushels.": Barley .is said
to be more widely distributed and more
generally "used' than ' aDy other grain
,:and an important , article of food for
man in remote times. . Pliny speaks of
it as the first grain cultivated for nour
- ishment It is adapted to hot and cold
climates. : It is not . known where it
Originated, j The plant is said 1 to grow
wild Sicily and tbe interior of Asia,
. and a common species is said to occur
'In a wild state in some parts of the
- United States. ' " ''-'
The barley cultivated in this country
' is of two species, the Htolgare and the
H distichon.'' A third species is culti-
- "valed - in Europe, called1 the 1 1I 'Xenas-
- tichon, or Fall and Winter barley.
It was sown in -Palestine in 'Autumn
and reaped' in the Sping. At the the
. Passover the. Hebrews frequently used
barley bread. It was aisoj used es food for
cattls. It is principally-cultivated in
the United States for the purpose of
' manaiactoring beer, it is more pro-
ductive than any other, kind of grain.
; It succeeds well in almost any bind of
' The climate of the United States is
aid not to bo very well adapted the
. production of a superior article of bar
ley.'j It requires a moist climate, con
vz seqaently the EDglish barley is superior
to oura L ..i.. it'. ! .;.
"i . There is quite a' contrast in regard to
the production of barley in the different
States.' compared with that of other
grain. : California -ranks second small-
, ,'est in the production of Indian corn in
1860, the 11th in wheat, and 4th in rye,
find' 4th 4n Oata and first fa 6arley, hav
ing produced in 1860, 4,418,426 bushels
of barley. 'Next in. order is New York
lr producing 4,186,668 bushsls.i Ohio is
third, and Illinois is fourth in order.
The increase in the production ot bar
ley in the New England States, in I860,
"was 300 per cent.; producing in' 1860,
1,199,119 bushels, Maine having ' the
largest increase, being 500 per cent.
, The increase in the Middle States was
about 33 per cent. ' New York produces
ever 85 per cent, of the barley produced
in the Middle States.
rj-M Tbe increase in the Western States
over that of 1850 was more than 600
pet' cent ; The Increase IrfHHnbia was
j. 1,000 per cent, and in Iowa about 1,800
per cent. The increase in the Southern
States' was nearly 400 per' cent , pro"
"ducing ;, 19,930 bushels in 1860 to,
56,132 bushels in 1850. r i "
ViO It will be seen that the prodaction of
Barley in' the Southern States, is very
Ismail, ' The single State of ; Maine pro-,
''dncca nearly four times as much as the
" entire Southern States. It is also worthy

The produot in 1860 is more than twice
that ol-1850- to each person. It" was
mora than doable - in the New England
States, nearly. four times as great in the
Western 'States, and about five times as
great in the Paoifio States. In the M

The Treasury Report.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury we priut in full elsewhere; in
this column we present a synopsis of its
most important statements of fact and
opinion, including the three Jopifs of
Currency, Public Debt, and Revenue,
and pursuing the order in which they
are treated by Mr. McCulloch.
I. The Currency The key to tbe
policy which the Secretary advocates
may be found in the declaration of his
belief that tbe authority of tCongress to
make the obligations of Congress a legal
tender resides outside of the Constitu
tion, and that the inflation which has
followed npon the necessary exercise ?f
that authority during the war is preju
dicial to both public and private inter
ests. While, therefore, he does not
advocate the repeal of the legal tender
acts, ncr believe it possioie to reauoe
the volume of the currency by violent
measures, be is of opinion that those
acts should be regarded asonly -ted-?
porary, and that the work of retiring the
notes which have been issued uodaY
tbem should be commenced without d$
lav. and carefully and persistently con
tinued nntil all are withdrawn.- ; The
rapidity of the process will depend npoh
the ability to dispose of securities; .The
specific measures recommended -are as
follows: f- "ir ',;
First: That Congress declare that the
compound interest notes shall eease to
be a legal tender from the. date of their
maturity. These notes were . intended
to be a security rather than a circulating
medium, and such a declaration.-? Con
gress would be neither injurious tQ;the
public nor an act ot bad fattnltor the
holders. . r c, C : o j ,
" Second: That the Secretary be author
ized in his discretion to sell bonds of the
United States, bearing interest at a rate
not exceeding six per cent.rand -redeem
ab'.e and payable at such periods as may
be conducive -to the interests of. the
Government, for the purposes! retiring
not only compound interestnotes but tbe
United States notes. u
Th amount ' which the Secretary es
timates as necessary to be retired in or
der to bring the currency within proper
limits 'is" from one hundred to two hun
dred millions;, iui addition to -the com
pound notes, tbe amount of which latter,
Oct. 31. was $173,012,141; all' dae in
1867 and 1868. The total-Taper circu
lation of Jhe Unfttd -States at that date
was $704,218,038', to &(hioh rshould be'
added : fati.OUU.OUO, -,the: -estimated
amountot compound, interest- notes
actually v in circulation. The total i
likely tc be still i further increased by
the issue of notes to tbe National banks
now daily, going On, and destined 'tor con
tinue till the limit of $300,000,000 an
thorized by law shall Save been reached,
ai it will be at no distant date As but
$185,000,000 of National Bank notes
are included m tbe estimate of $7a4y
218,038 20, there remain $115,000,000
to b added, and the aggregate amount
of circulation wiu then be $849,213,
038 20t"tIf the recommendations of .tbe
Secretary in regard, tc contraction be
fully carried ut by -retiring $200,000,
000 of United States notes .and the
$30,000,000 of compound interest notes
actually . In circulation, there will -still
remain a total circulation of $019,218,
038 20, even supposing that no exten
sion of the amount of National Bank
notes now authorized to be. "issued be
granted by Congress. It is, perhaps, in
view of these , or similar calculations
that the Secretary adda to his suggei
tions ths remark that neither . the
amount of n t action; nor tbe time that
will be required to bring up the currency
to: the specie standard can now be esti
mated with artydegr6e of accuracy,
The.firtt thing to.be done is to establish
the policy of contraction. : '-r

'special corn mission expected early in
f P' senoiorM In reference to the
i Southern States, tha. Secretary recom
mends that tbe collection of taxes ac
cruing before the establishment therein
of revenue offices be indefinitely post
poned; that sales of property for direct
taxes be postponed till the States have
an opportunity of assuming those taxes,
as the loyal States did; and that all
transactions invalid for want of stamps
be legalized so far as lies in the power
of Congress. For a great variety of
statements and suggestions on other
points the report itself may be consulted.
Beport of the Controller
of the
vurrcuij.
The Hon. Freeman Clarke presents a
compact statement of tba year's work,
which m present in full. - The report is
accompanied by about 140 pages of sta
tistics relating mainly to the condition
of National Banks. - Since the last re
port, ztii new banks have been organ-
zed, and 731 State banks converted
Into 'National.- Whole namber of Na
tional banks to Nov. I, is 1,601, of which
679 were new, and 922 conversions from
State institutions. Two banks have
failed.' The result of the conversion has.
been rather id diminish than to increase
tbe circulation. The National bank
notes in circulation Oct. 1, were $17!,
321,903; State banks,. $78,667,575; le
gal tender .and fractional currency,
(04,584,658. Including bank notes
not issued, the whole amount of the
nouinal circulation .at that date was
$1,083,452,233; from which the Con-
troller makes large deductions in order
to arrive at tbe actual circulation. Na
tional bank notes not delivered to banks
are $109,152,945; legal tender held by
banks, $193,094,365; compound interest
notes, mostly held in investments, $121,
314,195; currency in U. S. Treasury,
$56,236,440; ..altogether, $499,323,097;
leaving the actual circulation 94bU,oV
229.
It is recommended that as tbe most
efficient means to curtail expansion, a
system of compulsory redemption at tbe
financial centers be adopted. Tbe em
ergency which required an irredeemable
paper -earrency no longer existing, re
sumption of specie payments should en
sue at the earliest possible moment. As
one step toward it, the tariff should be
-- . . .
so aojaeieu as io discourage inorainaie
importations;-increasing-the tanfi as
gold and foreign exchange recede in
price. Internal taxation at the same
time should be simplified. In . addition
to $120,000,000 from the tariff, the Con
troller s 'estimates are $100,000,000 on
bisky. malt" liquors, " and domestic
ines; $15,000,000 on tobacco; $125,-
000,000 on cotton; $15,000,000 from
stamps ;1$20.0OOlOOO from licences; $10,-
000.000 from premiums on surplus of
goldi ih'fbe aeregate $405,000,000, a
sum probably $100,000,000 in excess of
expenses, the whole or part ot which
could bo to tbe yearly reduction ot tbe
debt.-, . By restricting the Internal Reve
nue tax to a few articles the cost of its
coUecUou would be greatly diminished,
and dissatisfaction with the law be abat
ed. The Controller protests warmly
against all schemes of State taxation of
National securities as a violation of
public faitb, and proposes the transfer
of the bureau which he administers from
Washington to New York, as demanded
by. economy nd convenience..
