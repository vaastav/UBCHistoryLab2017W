Saturday, December 17, 1887.
The prospect now is that the decisive
itand Blaine has taken in favor of abolish
in the taxes upon tobacco and retaining
them upon the necessaries of life will
cause a split in the republican parly, es
pecially in the west The Chicago
Tribune, the most powerful organ of the
party in the whole country, openly re
pudiates this policy, and if the idea is in
corporated into the next republican
national platrorm the Tribune can hardly
support the ticket without stultifying it
self to a humiliiitinii extent. In this
position it will be supported by many
thousands of republicans throughout the
west, who are unable to consider tobacco
any less a luxury than beer or whisky.
In fact it ny well be doubted whether
the popr man, for whose welfare Mr.
Blaine manifests so much solicitude, does
not extract fully as much, peibaps more,
comfort out of bis glass of beer or whis
key as he does trom his fibacco. Be
sides the tax upon tobacco ia very linbl
and scarcely felt by the consumer. How
ever that may be. the proper articles up
on which the taxes should flist he reduc
ed or abolished are upon what all admit
to be necessities, siirh as food and cloth
Hiiiifter H!n;Avertiter.
The recent retirement cf Mr. Robert
Bonner, one of (lie few men in this coun
try who have achieved fame and acquired
fortune in the publication of lilt rmy pa
pers, has revived interest in the nu-ib.Hla
by which he made the jjedgtr success.
A little less than fifty years ao Bon
ner wan an apprentice in the cnmjvosing
room of the Htirilnril Cmintnt, ami for
five years he wa nn insiirnflcant factor
in the daily composition of that then
rattier humble journal, Hie average ciiru
Ik t inn of which did not exceed 5iHJ copies.
Me looked upward, however, and in 1S55
he transformed the Merchants' Ledger, of
NeW York, a comparatively unknown
trade journal, into the Lttlgtr, the family
paper now so welt known throughout the
country.
It w generally known that the great
agent in Mr. Rnnuer'a success was judic
ious advertising. Had It not leen for
the fact that be made the ledger known
through other pipers it would probably
have long strutted feebly to maintain its
very existence, no matter what lis merits
werv.
Mr. iionncr was an extensive advertis
er. He was called an extravagant and
even reckless patron of the press. He
was neither extravagant nor reckless,
however. He simply invested his money
where experience and observation bad
taught him it would do the moat good.
He did not fritter away bis slender means
in advertising in Cheap John newspapers
and hand-bills, but selected the very best
mediums. In them lie would secure
space, no matter what the price was.
He put about all the monev he had after
fitting up his little office into a column
one time in the New "ork Herald, then
just acquiring a national reputation. It
paid, and he increased the investment in
arithmetical progression, and it was not
long before the circulation of the ledger
was bo larL'e that it was its own adver
tisement. He says he spent $25,000 iu
advertising the Ledger in other papers.
That it paid him a hundred, even a thous
and per cent., no one who knows of
Robert Bonner's remarkable career can
for a moment dnuM,
Bonner's success as in advertiser is far
from bein? an isolated instance. In every
city and town in the land there are men
who have made fortunes by investments
in printer's ink. It has come to be
recognized fact th&t judicious advertis
ing always pays and that injudicious ad
vertisin rarely brings any adequate re
turn. The best advertising is that done
in legitimate, established papers. Bonner
was one of the pioneers in extensive ad
twtising, and there are now men who
invest hundreds of thousands every year
in reaching the people through the pub
lie press.
One reason why cases terminate fatally
that at oral were not believed to be .sex
ious is because patients neglect disease
in Us first and faint attack. They wait
until the enemy is well into the citadef
and then they find it very difficult to dis
lodge him. it is the height of folly to
treat illness as a matter of small imports
ance, for we know not what may be de
veloped. A man who has a family to
support; a woman who has children and
a house to care for in fact, no one who
thinks life is worth living yields to sick
new until they feel that it is going to
get the best of them, and then is the time
for a prompt, thorough and , effective
meuicine. with Simmons Liver Kegola-
tor you can always relieve and never do
harm. Little may be needed, but still
when you have a simple and prompt as
sistance many dangerous forms of dis
ease may be arrested and removed st the

in season, often develop into serious dis

A PLAN FOR BUSINESS; "
Abo Platform la Which Ttnp-KH
Has a Plank A Reaolatioa Against
Lamar Sent to Committee Th "Dry
People at Syracuse Serve ft Notice Fry
and Him! Tnlk Politic.
New York, Dec 17. The national Re
publican cub convention was callrd to order
Friday at 10:45 a. m. by Chairman Ryan,
and the reports of too organixatioB com
mittpea were read, the first being that of the
committee oo rule The ootaaiitvM a per
manent organisation, as wu expected re
ported Senator Evarts for chairman. The
roll of clubs was then called and as their
names were announced those which waraluf-
geeCire were loudly cheered.
This
case when such names of John Sherman,
TJ. a Grant, Chaffee Sumner, John A.
Logan, Ben Wade, Abraham Lincoln, and
James G. Blaine were read.
The hut name was greeted with tremen
dous cheering, but it was noticed that some
delegates did not join in it. The Ohio dele
gation was silent and motijnleesa. What's
ttw matter with Ohio!" was naked, and the
cheering was repeated.
The number of clubs represented was 350,
by over 1,800 delegates, and there were
auventy-five clubs which bad swot in creden
tials, but whose deloatM did not co:oe.
A resolution was offered by J. C. Robin
son, of the Grant club, Binhamton, N. V.,
to the effect that a large portion of the sur
plus should be devoted to the fortification of
harbors ami building of a navy worthy of
the country. This with other resolutions
as referred without debate
Then Burdsall. of Binehamton, said he had
resolution, and the chairman mistaking the
name said Mr. "Burcbcad" had a resolution.
and a roar of laughter ensue! The resolu
tion declared in favor of the Blaine proposi
tion to distribute the whisky and tobacco tax
to the states according to population.
The next resolution read created a sensa
tion, and its reading resulted in a motion to
refer all resolution to the committee unread.
It was offered by Grosveuor, of Obio, and
was as follows:
Whkreah, It is the opinion of this national eon-
tmtioo ot KepubhVan Huha that no man who at
any time dtMiouinHHt Abraham Lincoln whit ha
was prwtulmit of thw lmtu states an a "iHimK.ii

outcbt to be apointed to or bold th high office
ot justice of the supreme court of the Uuiuxl
States; there lore.
fcsoWel, That L. Q C. Lamar ought not to
have Iweu appointed justice of said court.
The permanent chairman, Hon. n llltam
. Evarts, then took the chair and proceed
ed to address the convention. Ue began by
conzra tula tine the convention on ite work
and said the difference between the Repub
lican party and the Democratic party was
that the former never admitted that a candi
date could be greater than the party, while
the latter prided itself on selecting men wno
were its superiors. ibis was an illusion
which had been dispelled by the election of
Cleveland. Ue recited the advantages to be
derived from organizations like the Repub
lican clubs, criticised Cleveland's message,
and protested against permitting the Demo
crats to disown or explain it away. 1 be Re
publicans wanted that message and would
hold the Democracy to it
The report on club organization was then
presented, it consisted of drafts ota constitu
tion for a national organization to be known
as the "Republican Laague of the United
Sratea," and one for itata leagues. The
officers of the former are a president, vice-
presideuts, a secretary and a treasurer, ibe
latter are to hold annual conventions, but
an not to exams any preference for any
candidate before any political convention.
Any club having twenty members and duly
organized is entitled to membership ia state
leagues. A convention of th - league during
the year SS is also provided for.
The report was adopted: resolution
passed thattbedelegations meet during
and select men for officers of the National
league, and a vote of thanks tendered Ryan
for his services as temporary chairman. A
recess was th. n ordered until 3d, m.
It was 4 p. x before the convention reas
sembled. During recess the Mew York dele
gates had selected as their nominees for na
tional officers the following: President,
Cbaunoey M. Depew; vice president, James
E. ttlancbard, executive committeeman.
Edgar T. Brackett,-!! of New York.
As soon as Chairman Evarts called the
body to order there was loud cries of uGoff I1
and (ien. Nathan Ooff, of West Virginia,
responded by a speech in which he told why
the Republicans south of Mason and Dixon's
line were Republicans. It was because the
party represented protection to American
labor and industry, and universal education.
Mr. Goff referred twice incidentally to Mr.
Blaine in naming the possible candidates of
the party, and both times there was a
uonal demonstration or approval.
The committee on platform then made its
report, the substance of which is as follows:
It declares that the Republican party has
always appealed to the noblest and highest im
pulses of human nature. It has devoted itself
to the education of the masses, believing that Intel
ligeot knowledge of political institutions is requia-
Ue for aeU-tf-varume&L. it bus m gnuranfed
human liberty. It recounts the vast growth of
the country, ascribing it to Republican rule.
Civil-service reform is eulogiaed as a sample of
unselnsb work of a party of pure instincta. If
restored to power the party would continue Its
work of combating the remaining relics of bar
barism namely, polygamy, iguorance and Intern'
perance.
In reference to the president's message the
platform declares that the president has descend
ed from the dignity of his high office so far as to
convert his constitutional duty into a partisan
speech for the overthrow of a policy recom
mended by tun rounders or the government; gives
toe history ot protective larur, and ascribes the
growth if tbe country to its beneficent effect.
The Republican party refuses to abandon the
protective policy, as to do so would rum our b
dustrifiR and throw laborers out of work, far the
benefit of tbe British. Tbe president's
Is further described as an invitation to the Ajner-
can people to support tbe laborers and manu
facturers of Europe tnstead of our own. The Re
publican party would render America independ
ent of Europe, As to the surplus, tbe Republicans
kept it down when In power by reducing taxa
tion. Tbe Democrats have shown themselves un
able to do so, but now proposed to reduce it by
making us the commercial slaves of Europe.
The Democracy is then condemned for refusal
to admit tbe territories, and to pass educational
A free ballot is demanded, an honest
count, and an efficient navy. The platform
charges the Democratic administration with cul
pable weakness in protecting tbe rights of our
merchant vessels in foreign ports. It also accuses
the administration with prostituting tbe civil
service to partisan purposes, and with trampling
on the soldiers and reopening strife by proposing
to restore the battle naga.
The resoiutions as read were approved in
speeches by Maria, of Maryland; Wolff, of
Washington; CoL Snowden, of Pbiladelphia:
Speaker Noras, of Massachusetts; John
Mitchell (colored), of Vlrsinia. and others.
W be tbe question on adoption of the re
port was reached, Jfiastn, of Minnesota,
called for action first on the resolution op
posing Uimar's confirmation as supreme
court justice, bat be was ruled out of order
and tbe report was unanimously adopted.
Mr. Eustis then tried to attain offer the
Lamar resolution, bat Chairman Evarts said
the resolution was in the hands of tbe com
mittee, and Mr. Eustis was oat of order.
Brackett, chairman of the New York delega
tion, moved that the Lamar resolution be re
called from the committee. Rice, of
chosetts, said the convention should not
throw imid at any man. Others expressed
the some .view, and Capt Cunningham, of
wasnmgton, moved to adjourn. Kasson,
of Iowa, seconded the motion and It was car
ried with a rash.
An audience of moderate number listened
at Chiekering hall at night to speeches by
Col. John Atkinson, of Michigan; Galusha
A. urow, of 1'ermsyivania; Hon. H. -. Hott,
or Michigan; Judge iunne, of Ohio; U.
Wallace Bruce, of New York; A. 4. Lester,
ot Illinois, and others. Morr in his speech
favored local option, and declared that the
condemnation of intemperance inserted in
tbe ciao platform placed the Republican
party right on the liquor question.
ANT 1 "SALOON 1ST 8 RJESOLVE.3
Republicans Mast Aooept the Temperastes
- laswe or Mint Up.
Syracuse, N. T., Dec. 17. There was an
increased attendance of delegates at tbe
Anti-Saloon Republican league convention at
music nau nday morning. The committee
oo permanent organisation reported Noah
Davis, of New York, for president; Frank
JSoss, ot xtew York, for secretary, and
James Thurston, of New Tork, treasurer.
A list of fourteen vice-presidents and
state committee were named. The report
Judge Davis . said - that if wishes
were to control be would peremptorily de
dins the office, bat on account of his interest
in the league and its eventual success he
woald not decline. He made a ringing
speech and encouraged ail to continue in the
work began and look for certain recognition
from the Republican party at its national
convention.
The report on platform was then read and
adopted unanimously. It reiterates the grounds
of hostility to tbe drinking saloons, and declares
that the saloons ought to be utterly extirpated,
and then states that tbe conflict between law and
good order and the saloons, brewers and distillers
has now reached a point where the Republican
party must either accept the issue, and declare
Its position of determined hostility to these or
ganised enemies of the good morals and the
sacred institutions of eur land, or abandon
its claims to be the party ot law and order. Tbey
must be opposed to vice and crime. Anarchy,
Nihilism and Socialism, and their attendant
evils. It approves of the declarations of the
Republican party heretofore made in favor of the
submission of a prohibitory constitutional amend
ment and In favor of local option by counties,
towns and wards, and tbe restriction of traffic by
taxation In such localities as do not prohibit the
sale of liquor. It urges the legislature to pass
such measures as shall give tbe declarations
practical effect; demands tbe repeal of certain
state laws that operate unsatisfactorily, and
closes by call lug upon all citizens to co-operate
with them in securing tbe objects set forth in this
dociaration.
Jude Davis, of N;w York; Professor
Cook, of Potsdam, and Dr. Warren, of Syra
cuse, were chosen as a committee to attend
the national Republican convention at Chi
cago in June, to present the resolutions.
x-dudge Davis has been elected chairman
of the state committee. The conference ad
journed sine die.
Bare Blafae Don't Want It.
Washington Citt, Dec. IT. In an inter
view with a correspondent Friday, Senator'
Frye, when asked if he thought Blaine does
not want tbe presidential nomination, said: I
don't think it I know it. I know what he
thmtrs and how be feels about it Think of
the personal suffering of the last campaign;
of all his political career, of course, but es
pecially of tbe last campaign the false and
malicious and scandalous and vile charges
made against him. No wonder the man
shrinks from another fight will all that it im
plies. But, tbe senator said there was just
as tittle doubt that Blame was the choice of
the party, Mnot a shadow of a doubt of it."
Frank Hard Says Free Tratfo.
Toledo, O., Dec. 17. Hon. Frank Hurd
talked to a reporter Friday. He said: I do
not believe there is any doubt about the ac
tion of either convention. The Damocrats
ill renominate Mr. Cleveland, and the Re
publicans will nominate Mr. Blaine."
"And the roue will be-
Free trade on the part of the Democrats
and protection on tbe part of the Repub
licans. '
Mr. Hurd thought that the president
would carry Michigan, Wisconsin, Minne
sota, and low owiug to his position on the
tariff question.
A Republican Gets Very Dry.
Wabash, lnd., Dec 17 Jesse T. Hutchius.
one of tbe leading Republican politicians of
this county, has stampeded and gone over to
the Prohibition ranks. Mr. Hutching is city
attorney at present, and until Friday was
looked upon as the leading candidate for
mayor before the Republican convention.
Last spring Uobuu uushard, a Republican
county commissioner-elect, renounced his
party m the seme manner, and pitched bis
tent with the rVohibitionists.
TRADES UNION LEGISLATION.
Proceedings of the Cof T.U . Ooupers Re-
Elected The Irish Question Bobs lip.
Baltimore, Dec. 17. Consideration of
the constitution was the order of the day
Friday in the federation of labor conven
tion. It was proposed to alter the instru
ment so as to permit the general officers to
each member & cents a week to help
strikers and allowing the general officers to
pend any union refusing to pay up. This
was opposed as a measure of centralization.
and tbe proposition was finally remanded to
the unions to vote on, a two-thirds vote be
ing necessary to its adoption first, and then
the next convention to consider it again.
The principle of boycotting was endorsed in
another amendment; and an attempt to in
crease the president's salary to $),.r0 pel
year was defeated.
A committee recommendation that tbe
constitutional requirement ot a majority of
ail the unions to change the constitution be re
pealed was voted on, resulting: ayes, 36; noes.
ia. ttompers dec tared it lost, as it reqaired
a two-thirds vote to change tbe constitution.
bat those in favor of a change said the vote
not on a change but on tbe report of a
committee and aDpaaled from the decision.
and the appeal was sustained. Gompers then
left the chair, declaring that he would have
nothing to do with such business, and the
report was adopted. The treasury committee
reported that many unions have not paid
their assessments. A motion to send two
delegates to the trades union congress in
London was defeated, and it was recom
mended that any union desiring to sand dele
gates do so.
A long report was adopted bv a rising vote
declaring that the K. of I fails because it
does not let each trade run its own business
and that its strikes fail because after local
funds are exhausted the men are ordered back
to work by men not posted in the wants of the
strikers. Also that secret organizations are
no good, and that tbe knights are fighting
tbe trades unions and should be met on
their part with unralentimr opposition.
resident Gompers introduced a resolution
expressing satisfaction at the efforts beiug
made to establish a treaty between the
United States and Great Britain, looking to
the settlement by arbitration of all questions
difficult of solution through the ordinary
diplematio channel a, and thanking William
R. Creamer, M. P., for his exposition of tbe
object of his vuit to this country. Mr. Jo
seph Wilkinson tacked on the following
amendmeut:
'And we also extend our sympathies to tbe
people or Ireland m then- struggle for self-rov-
eminent, and condemn the present policy of tbe
Unusb government in the coercion of the Irish
people." "
Ibe resolution was referred and then tbe
following officers were elected: President,
Samuel Gompers, New York ; first vice presi
dent, Daniel McLaughlin, Bra id wood. Ills.
second vice president, William Martin, Pitts
burg, fa ; secretary , r. J. McGuire, Phila
delphia; treasurer, Gabriel Edmonston,
Washington. John McBride, of Ohio, per
sistently refused to permit tbe use of hit
taame in connection with the presidency, and
uopipers was the only candidate.
oL Louis was chosen as the place for hold
ing the next annual convention, and the con
vention adjourned lor the day.

Mrs. Robinson went to the jury Friday after
noon uua inere were a lew witnesses ex
amined in rebuttal by the state, the testimony
being as to the relations between Been and

GOT THEIR LITTLE BILLS.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IMPATIENT
LY WAITING FOR BILL DAY.
A Regular Avalanche of Paper Proposi
tions Looked for and What Will Become
of Them The Holiday Beeeas Decided
Upon Talking Over the Tariff Piam
for Car Heating.
WAsnrtroTOir Crrr, Nov. 17. The Re
presentatives just now are engaged in two
things in indeavoring to conviuce the
speaker of the wisdom of appointing them to
pieces upon the committees to which they
desire to be assigned and. in preparing to
deluge tbe bou-e with bills the moment that
consent shall be given to introduce then. An
impartial observer who has only the interest
of the public service and a desire to retrench
expenditures at heart would be amazed to
witness the preparations which are being so
generally made for bill day. Five
hundred bills aavd mote have already
been introduced in tbe senate. It is
not extravagant to estimate that the number
of bills likely to be introduced in tbe bouse
at the first time set apart for the reception of
bills will be 5,000. There were more than
15,000 bills introduced in the last congress.
of which 12,000 failed. A very large pro
portion of these 12,000 bills are to be rein
troduced in the Fiftieth cox agrees, and if one
doubts it, a glance at tbe deuk of almost any
representative would soon dispel those donbta
Tbe desks are full of old printed bills, with
the numbers erased. In other respects tbey
are the same old familiar faces, and are
ready to be sent to the clerk's desk wheu the
call of tbe states shall begin.
It is now expected that that
ominous roll will be called Monday and
there is vary little probability that it will be
much more than finished at the time fixed
for adjournment. Tbe experienced clerks at
the desk who have taken some pains to in
form themselves as to the tremendous ava
lanche of printed matter which will be show
ered upon them soon, have estimated that
three days will be necessary to call the roll
of the states for the introduction of bills.
The printers are delighted because the pub
lic printer will be able to recall some of the
furloughs, and the old unk men are pleased
because they know that a little later on they
can obtain these bills from tbe refuse vaults
of tbe capitol for from Jtf to X a cent per
pound, and can sell them to the butter
in tbe market at 1 cent a pound.
The comparatively small number of
these bills which don't find their way
to tbe butter tub and the pulp vat
will be loaded upon the out-going postal
trains, franked to admiring constituencies.
and the dockets of tbe Fiftieth congress will
be lust as full as those of the Forty -ninth.
and the percentage of bills which failed to
become laws will not be less; and there ia
do more probability now than there has been
at any time for twenty years that there will
be any reform in the public printing in this
respect so long as it costs members of con
gress nothing to send it to their constituents.
Meanwhile some of tbe large storerooms be
neath the terrace which have been recently
finished are already overflowing with ac
cumulated stores of public documents, and if
terraces are to be built for storerooms more
will soon he needed.
Plana For Heating Railway Cars.
Washington Citt, Dec. 17. In response
to a resolution adopted last January, the
secretary of the treasury has sent to the
bouse suggestions as to the construction of
heating apparatus for passenger cars and
steamboats, so as to preveut the loss of prop
erty and life by fire. The secretary says he
sent out a circular calling for suggestions on
the subject, that kilo letters and communica
tions were received, and the different
methods suggested by tbe correspondence
are classified as follows: 1 beating cars
by use of steam from locomotives; 3 beat
ing cars by hot air from locomotives:
heating cars by heat from independent car;
4 beating and lighting cars by electricity
6 beating by improved heaters or stoves in
cars; o prevention of disaster by fire by
means of specially constructed safety cars;
heating and lighting cars by gas; 8
miscellaneous, not classified under the pre
vious classifications. The supervising in
spector general says the fact that congress
did not appropriate money to pay expenses
of practical experiments prevents it being
settled whether the pi vis proposed are prac
tically ethcienL Many of them are theoreti
cally efficient.
Republican Talking It Over.
Washington Crrr, Dec. 17. The Repub

is true however of Santa Claus Soap, because when it isonce
fairly tried it is found to be better than promised. For all
