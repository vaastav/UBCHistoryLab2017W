THE LAST CHANCE.
The second session of the Forty-seventh
Congress assembled in Washington on last
Monday. The Democrats have a majority
in both branches of the. present Congress,
but after the fonrth of March next the Re?
publicans will have a plurality in the lower
House, the Independentstind Greenbackers
holding the balance of power, with the
probability that on all political questions
they wi&affihate with the Republicans. If
lbe.Seb.ate should be Republican, that party
will have control of the Federal government
for the next two years. It is not probable
that any measures of a partisan character
will be brought before the present Congress, I
and it is more than likely that the present
session will be eminently practical and do
voted to the consideration of measures pro
motive of the general interests of the whole
country. The tariff and revenue laws need
revision, and now when the country and
Congress rest from all Apolitical excitement
13 the time for statesmen of both parties to
give to the country a just and equal tariff,
one which shall protect the industries of
the. country alike without unjust discrimi
? nation'in favor of any industry or against
any class of consumers, and one which at
the same rime shall raise the largest amount
of revenue, and thereby enable Congress to
reform and reduce the Internal Revenue
taxation. If the Democratic party in this
tho last session of its supremacy in both
branches of Congress shall secure to the
country a sound currency, ignoring repudi
. ation and Greenbackism, adopt a tariff for
revenue, and at the same time have regard
to a just protection of the industrial inter?
ests of the country, arid so reform the Inter?
nal Revenue taxes that they shall' not oper?
ate unjustly against thn industries of limited
.portions of the country, it will receive the
commendation of all sections and parties.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Hayea on last Monday com
- mnnicated to both Houses of Congress
his last annual message. It is quite
lengthy, and if it were not for the recom?
mendation of a new crusade against the
South which it contains, would strike the
publio as containing suggestions emi?
nently wise and national. The President
assumes that "continued opposition to
the foil and free enjoyment of the rights
of citizenship, conferred upon the colored
people by the recent amendments to the
Constitution, still prevails in several of
the late slayeholding States," and asks
Congress to pass firm and well- considered
measures to enforce the Fifteenth Amend?
ment, which means that "the Federal
Government shall control all Federal
. elections' in the Southern States. The
President further recommends the House
. of Representatives and the Senate to see
to it that every case of the violation of
tbe letter or spirit of the Fifteenth Amend?
ment is thoroughly investigated, and
that no benefit from such violation shall
accrue to any person or party, which
means that the next Congress shall ex?
clude such members of Congress and
Senators as the Republicans may deem
expedient The President further asks
Congress for sufficient appropriations to
prosecute unsparingly all who have been
engaged in depriving citizens of the
rights guaranteed to them by the Consti?
tution. Whatever may be the merits of
the remainder of the Message, this por?
tion of it is a dark spot which mars the
whole, and identifies the President with
the stalwarth element of bis party, and
that instead of seeking at tbe close of his
administration to heal all sectional feel?
ings, it is his desire to kindle afresh the
fires of sectional hate and animosity.
We are satisfied that every reader of tho
Intelligencer will be gratified to learn
of the great increase in the shipping
business of our "City by the Sea," which
is shown by the following comparative
statement, taken from the News and Cou?
rier: "The total value of the exports from
this port for tbe first three months .of the
business year commencing September 1,
1880, is $7,709,635 against $6,726,313 for the
same period last year, an increase of
$1,083,322 in tbice months. Tbe value of
tbe imports for the same period were
$14,171.26 for 1SS0 and $11,787.83 for 1879,
an increase of $2,3S3.43. during the three
months just closed there were 23 foreign
steamships entered at the custom house
with an aggregate tonnage of 34,127 tons,
against 1G vessels with an aggregato ton?
nage of 20,761 tons during the same
period last year." Every South Caro?
linian should feel a deep interest in
Cnarleston, aud rejoice at her increasing
prosperity. When she gets that long
coveted direct connection with the great
Northwest by tbe completion of the Blue
Ridge Railrood, she will becomo without
a doubt the Queen City of the South.
Notwithstanding the great hue and cry
raised by the designing stalwart* of the
Radical party about tbe frauds commit?
ted by the enumerators in taking tbe
census in this State, Superintendent
Walker, in a rocent report on the subject,
says that "no specific allegation of fraud
in the enumeration of South Carolina
has ever been made at this office." Pie is
at least one Federal officer, appointed by
a Radical President, that seems to have a
spark of honesty in his heart.
There are four colored Domocrats in the
Legislature, one from Colleton and three
from Charleston. They are all intelligent
men, and by uniting and co-operating
with the only political party in this State
that can command the rospect of honest
men, reflect credit upon their raco. They
are all quiet, unobtrusive business men,
and are highly respected by tho people
of their counties.
Messrs. Sample and West more, of
North Carolina, were in Columbia last
week for the purpose of perfecting
arrangements made some time back with
the Board of Penitentiary Directors for
the manufacture of shoes in the Peniten?
tiary. These gentlemen propose to enter
largely into tho business of manufac?
turing shoes within the prison walls with
convict labor.
Rufus Henry and W. F. Anderson have
discovered a vein of silver on Mr. Frank
Anderson'.?*, place, near Mt. Carmel, in
Abbeville County, and have gono rcgu
< trly to work, and the Medium says the
?-sin is rich and a fortune is sure. In tho
?tme section rich deposits of gold have
baen found on tho places of W. H. Brock
. nd A. O. Grant.
Peter Paschal, colored, voted the Dem?
ocratic ticket at Due West at tho late elec
:">n. He is represented to be 120 years

Klieves "in tho principles for which Lee

Mr. J. R. Penitt, a white man about 26
years old, living near Branson, in this
State, attempted suicide on the 30th ult.
by shooting himself twice, severely ii
uot mortally wounding himself, while in
a fit of insanity. Ho has a wife aud five
children, and has twice before attempted
to take his own life.
The Presidential Electors for South
Carolina met in Columbia on Wednes?
day, the first day of December; and cast
the seven elec^ral votes of the State for
W. S. Hancock for President, and W. H.

000.)

favorable report.

missioners to proenro and establish in

lars far an argument.

would pass. It was killed by a vote of
72 to 43.
In tho night session of tbo House the
time was engaged mostly in alenghthy
discussion over the bill to repeal the lien

the bill, on tbe ground that the present
lien law was a necessity to three-fourths
of tbe farmers of tho State, and that the
time had not yet arrived when it could
safely be repealed.
Mr. Tindall favored tho bill, taking the
ground that the lien law was extraordi?
nary, and adopted at a timo when the
people were imperished by war and un?
able to secure credit by reason of the
unsettled condition of affairs. The State
is now piosperous and in a Stato of peace,
and be thought that the peoplo would bo
far better olf without tbe law. They
would bo encouraged to build up credit
on their own business integrity, and
would not be forced to nccopt the ruin?
ous rates charged for supplies by the por
sons making advances.

orders was upon tho joint resolution re?
ported by tho Committee of Ways and
Means favoring an appropriation of ?2,000

speeches were made on this resolution,

The reports (majority and minority) on
the sent of the Hon. T.* B. Jeter was, ?n ac?
count of the absence of senators interested,
made a special order for to-morrow.
The following bills passed second read?
ings :
Bill relating to the duties of county com?
missioners (changing the time for their an?
nual reports from September to November.)
The report of the agricultural committee
on the report of the State Agricultural So?
ciety was adopted. (This allows the usual
$-2,500 appropriation from the State.)
The House bill ratifying the amendment
to Section 32, Article i of'the Constitution,
relating to the homestead, was passed?yeas
25, nays none.
The bill amendingthe Act prohibiting the
traffic in seed cotton, while only making the
present law more explicit, created a lively
contest on its second reading to-day. Sena?
tor Perry moved to amend by totally pro?
hibiting the sale. Senator Wylic thought
that would operate against those who did
not make enough to pack a bale, and kept
landowners front taking seed cotton lor
iant. It waa too sweeping a remedy.
Senator Perry thought the present law
was nullified by thieves selling in daylight
what they had stolen at night.
Senator Fishburnc moved the indefinite
postponement of the prohibitory amend?
ment. It operated against the poorer
classes, was unjust and totally unconstitu?
tional. They might as w%U prohibit the
sale of corn or other agricultural products.
No law which was too harsh could be en?
forced.
Senator Perry then withdrew his amend?
ment.
Senator Miller then opposed the bill in
Mo, as a great hardship on the people of
Beaufort County, at least, where cotton was
raised in small lots.
Senator Wylic said that restrictions for
moral reasons were already placed on the
sale of other commodities, and if this pro?
hibition diminished larceny it would be a
boon to the people.
Senator Miller's motion to strike out the
prohibitory clause was defeated.
Senator Lartigue moved to recommit iho
bill to the committee, with an amendment,
allowing traffic in seed cotton in t!<e day
time only to licensed vendors.
Senator Callison offered a substitute that
no person deal in seed cotton in less quanti?
ties than five hundred pounds between the
1st of September and the 1st of January.
Senator Miller said that this was class
legislation of tho worst kind.
Senator Fishburne moved the indefinite
postponement of amendments.
Then there was a good deal of personal
sparring and several personal explanations
before the bill was finally recommitted to
the committee with all the amendments
This was the first time that the Senate
has seemed warmed up this session.
house of representatives.
During the Speaker's absence Mr.
Simonton occupied his chair.
Among the new measures introduced
were the following:
A concurrent resolution that 10,000
copies of the report of the Commissioner
of Agriculture bo printed for distribu?
tion. Adopted.
A bill to amend the Act of 187S amend?
ing the school law.
A bill to change the present system of
working tho roads.
A bill to establish a uniform system of
registration of deaths, marriages and
births in South Carolina, und a bill regu?
lating tho licensing of physicians and sur?
geons. These bills aro introduced at tho
instance of the State Board of Health.
A bill to prevent double taxation of
real property. This bill seeks to exempt
mortgages on real estate from taxation.
The Committee on Privileges and Elec?
tions recommended that the bill to redis
trict the Congressional Districts of tho
State be continued to next session. The
report was placed on the Calendar.
The Committee of Way? and Means
submitted majority and minority reports
on the bill to simplify tho collection of
taxes.
The concurrent resolution providing a
commission to amend the State Constitu?
tion, and the bill to provide for the ap?
pointment of a commission to consider
and suggest amendments to the Consti?
tution of tho State, which were made
special orders to come up together to-day,
?were postponed until Wednesday next.
This action was taken in consequence of
the absence of certain members specially
interested in these measures.
The bills which passed second reading
on Saturday passed third reading and
were sent to tho Senate.
Thirty-eight measures on tho Calendar
were disposed of without debate of inter?
est. Among these the following wore
killed. Bill to amend an Act for the fur?
ther protection of landlords in the collec?
tion of moneys due by tenants for rents
and advances: bill to amend tho Act to
alter and amend tho school law so as to
reduce the salary of school commission?
ers; bill to regulato tho appointment of
trial justices and to limit their jurisdic?
tion as to tho trial of causes.
Among tho bills which passed second
readings was: A bill to amend an Act
to prohibit persons living together in
adultery and fornication and to define
these crimes. This bill was supported
by Messrs. Dargan of Darlington, Mur?
ray of Anderson, and Robinson (colored)
of Beaufort. It provides a fine of from
?100 to $500 or imprisonment up to one
year, or both, in the discretion of the
court.
The bill to reduce the salary of tho ad?
jutant and inspector-general was tabled,
and tho bill to compel executors to give
bond was indefinitely postponed.
THE NATIONAL CAPITAL.
Waiting for tho Opening of Congress.
Tho Session Likely to he Uriel lmt Busy
Speculation on the Garneld Cabinet.
Washington, November 30.
Comparatively few members of Con?
gress ate their thanksgiving turkey
in Washington, but now that festival is
over, the}' aro dropping into town in dai?
ly increasing numbers. There is a
marked lack of excitement about politics,
and tho general feeling seems to be that
we are going to have a comparatively
quiet winter. Tho Republicans are, of
course, entirely satisfied with tho situa?
tion, ami do not seem disposed to attempt
anything out of the ordinary line. The
Democrats in turn arc somewhat sub?
dued by the result of the election, and
such of them as have put in an appear?
ance favor a strictly business session.
The first Monday in December this year
will not come until the Gth of the month,
and that will leave only seventy-six
working days before tho *4th of March.
The holiday recess will reduce tho num?
ber to about sixty, and this will not suf?
fice lor much work outside the regular
appropriation bills. Gen. Walker will'
havo tho census figures ready, so that
thereapportionmentof Concrjss might be
made if it were desired, but the Republi?
cans can bo trusted to tight it off. Thoro
is scarcely any chance to secure a parti?
cle of partisan advantage out of this busi?
ness, but tho Republicans profess to fear
that the Democrats would not do the job
fairly. The really important subject to
come before Congress this winter is
THE QUESTION of REFUNDING.
Several hundred millions of bonds fall
duo next summer, and provision must
bo made for them before that time?if not
during the winter, by an extra session
in the spring. It is only a question of
tho rate of interest, however. A year
ago Secretary Sherman opposed any?
thing less than four per cent., but every?
body now sees that n 34 per cent, bond
would bo snapped up readily, and a good
many people think a 3 per cent, bond
could be floated. Neither party has any?
thing to gain by deferring action on this
subject, and there is every reason to bo
lievo that a satisfactory bill will bopassod.
There may bo some trouble about the
appropriation that will be asked for %o
pay
THE deputy MARSHALS
employed in various parts of the country
at the recent election, but even if tho
money should bo refused, it would not
constitute a sufficient reuson for an extia
session. Everybody knows that the
next Congress will allow tho bills, and
the marshals could wait a few months for
their pay without any Buffering. The
inlluence of all tho Democratic officials
of the House will be thrown against an
extra session, inasmuch as that would
involve their immediate displacement by
Republicans, whereas otherwise they
would continue to hold their places and
draw their pay until December, 18S1. On
the other hand some of the Republican
aspirants for their positions will urge
a:; extra session
so that they ma}' get their names on tho
payroll at onco. Still no party would
think of forcing an extra session for such
a purpose, and thoro is now an excellent
prospect that the country may have a
long rest from Congress after the Senate
has confirmed President Gartield's ap
poiniments next March.
TIIE rR ks id EXT ELECT
got off to Ohio yesterday, aftet nearly a
week in the capital, and does not expect
to return until a few days before his in?
auguration, lie had a very busy time of
it while he was here, what with crowds
of callers and breakfasts and dinner* out
almost every day. The President gave a
big dinner in his honor Saturday even?
ing, and on the morning of that day Levi
P. Morton, the rich Now York banker,
entertained him at an elegant breakfast.
Senator Edmunds, Bob Jngorsoll and
Gen. Schcnek were among others who
had the Garlields as their guests. A
great many people had conversations
with tho President-elect, but he kept Iiis
own counsel very well. Tho only thing
clear about his Cabinet is that ho has
decided nothing as yet, and will wait till
after the senatorial elections before he
makes out tho list. One result of Gar
field's visit is a rise of
SHERMAN STOCK
in the Ohio senat >rial market. There is
no doubt whatever that tho secretary of
the treasury is very anxious to resume
bis old place in thj Capitol, and it is
equally evident that his transfer would
relieve Garliold of a .crave difficulty. If
Sherman were not elected senator, ho
could not well refuse to offer him a
chance to remain in tho Cabinet, and
whatever the secretary's real feelings
toward him may be, there must be mora
or less constraint always in their rela?
tions to each other. Besides if Garliold
wcro to keep Sherman it would bo hard
for him not to retain other members of
the present Cabinet. It will therefore be
much more satisfactoiy all around to
elect Sherman as Thurman's successor,
and the only serious opposition will
como from Governor Foster, of Ohio,
who has had his heart set upon the place
But Foster can be provided for other?
wise, and iL is apparent that he cannot
count upon GarfieUi's assistance in his
attempt to capture the scmttorship. The
Presidetit elect will hold aloof from the
tight himself, but his next friends?men
like Congressmen Townscnd, of Cleve?
land, and Butlorworth, of Cincinnati
have gone actively to work in Sherman's
interest.
VACANCIES.
The death of Congressman Farr, of
New Hampshire, which is repnrtod by
telegraph to-day, will make a vacancy
in the House. Thcro aro three other
vacancies now, but they will bo promptly
filled by the swearing in of the members
elect. Ezra 13. Taylor to succeed Gen.
Garlield, Jonathan 'Scoville of New York
to succeed Ray V. Pierce, and G. W.
Hewitt of Alabama to succeed B. B.
Lewis, all three resigned. There is also a
vacancy among the House officials,
caused by the death of Postmaster Stew?
art during the recess, and a Demo?
cratic caucus will be called to decide
upon his successor.
GEN. JOE JOHNSTON
got a bad fall while going down the front
steps of his residence on Thanksgiving
morning. Ho was nicked up uncon?
scious, and it was at first feared that ho
had suffered sorious injuries, but ho is
recovering rapidly and hopes to resume
his seat early in the session. The gallant
and genial old gentleman is heartily
liked and universally respected by both
parties, and much regret was expressed
among Republicans at his determination
to retire from Congress after serving out
his present term.
? A snake-charmer at Rock Hill met
with a terriblo fato last Thursday morn?
ing. Mr. John M. Howe, a citizen of
that place, and a liquor dealer, was
known as a snake-charmer. He had no
fear of tho most venomous snake, and,
indeed, hail a rattlesnake for a pet. Ho
took the snake out of its cage and was
amusing himself by allowing it to coil
about his arm, as he had been in the habit
of doing, when suddenly it became
vicious and sank its fangs into his linger.
In thirty minutes he was dead, despite
the inost persistent efforts to save him.
? On the 27th ult. J. C. Hayes and
Rcddick Richardson, colored, who wero
acting as constables for Trial Justice
Cannon at Foreston, Clarendon County,
went to the house of Cupid Cooper, col?
ored, armed with a warrant of arrest is?
sued by Mr. Cannon. Upon their ap?
proach to the house Cooper grabbed up
his riflo and deliberately shot Hayes a
glancing shot in the forehead, tho ball
entering tho flesh to the skull, where?
upon Hayes returned the shot with his
pistol, hitting his friend Richardson
through the hand. Cupid escaped.
? Under the now codo of Mississippi,
any citizen has tho right to arrest or car?

of Magistrates to commit such tramps to

out as other convicts arc.
? The Piedtnout and Arlington Life

rapid mortality among policy holders.
Its exact oondition is unknown, and no
decision has been arrived at as to bow it
