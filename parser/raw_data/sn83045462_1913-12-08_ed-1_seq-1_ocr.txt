says Gen. Bixby. in continuing the work
of improving the Anacostia river from

ed in June. IfC. and an estimate made I
of Sl."Jly fur its completion. Already j

Gen. Bixby, "has been of great benefit to

version of considerable traffic from the
Washington channel, where conditions
were rapidly becoming congested. Health

These estimates include |20,000 for re- ?
pairs to the Conduit road. ?5 U00 for
emergencies. for improvements at
McMillan Park, Ill-'.bUO for lining sections
of the Washington aqueduct, for
water meters and $1.00u for a dwelling
for the assistant overseer at Great Falls.
(Jen. Bixby says he believes that the j
installation of meters will assist in the t
prevention ot leakage and In a material i

Maintenance ot Puolic Buildings.
I' timates :-sgr<.gutiiU are sub
ii ii'. d for the maintenance a?id improve

These include appropriations for the de
velopment of Potomac lJark. especially
the liewtv opened eastern section; also
for new roadways to the Highway
bridge and for beginning the im
provement of Meridian Hill Park.
i Jen. Bixby -av- it is apparent that the
Aqueduct bridge over the Potomac at
Georgetown is wholly inadequate to the
present and prospective traffic, and that
the time has arrive.1 when a new and
substantial bridge should be constructed
which will provide for this traffic and
any future increase.
IU recommends that an appropriation
?<f SP?,o??o be matle, with a view to Inves
tigation and presentation of plans atid es
timates for a bridge which v. iii hr ude
nuate to the demands which may be
brought upc>? it. This appropriation is
considered urgent, yi view of the con
tinual deterioration of the old piers. Cien.
Bixby says that the balance at present
fc.vaua.ble should not be encroached upon.
in view of the liability of its being neeaed
t<? make repairs to the old piers in the
i pr. seat structure, which are at any time
liable to serious accidents which may in
volve a suspension of traffic over the
bridge fur a time, if not its destruction.

FOR ElYllON
ON CURRENCY BILL
Senator Swanson Says the
Measure Will Be Beneficial
to Legitimate Business.
INSURES TO THE B/\NKS
A VIGOROUS CO-WORKER
Prevents Accumulation of Money for
Speculative Purposes, He Declares,
Addressing the Senate.
Declaring that the currency system con
tained in the pending democratic currency
bi i gives the banks of the country
"neither a master nor a slave, but a i
strong, vigorous co-worker and assistant," i
Senator Swanson of Virginia today urged
the Senate to speedy action on the
measure.
The senator said the measure was wise,
prudent and conservative; that it retained
all the good features of our present cur
rency and banking system and only
eliminated acknowledged evils and sup
plied confessed additional needs; that it
was advantageous in that it continued our
present currency without diminishing its
volume, aggregating $.*t.G0o,000,000; that it 1
continued the country's system of inde- j
j endent banks, which has been most!
tenelicial in Ihe dev ilopment of this coun
try.
Objects to Central Bans.
The evils of a central bank were point
out by Mr. Swanson, who claims that the
advantages of a central bank were far
exceeded by the objections to such a
bank. He claimed that under the pro
posed system about one-fortieth of the
banking capital of the country and about
one-fortieth of the banking resources of
the nation would be included in the sys
tem, and that the vast amount of bank
ing capital and resources unaffected bv
the system would be left for business ;
and accommodation as now existing. He '
as?T'ttd that while the capita! and r< - 1
iources of the federal reserve banks
created under tiie biil were small, in !
comparison to the capital and resources i
undisturbed by the bill, yet it was ample
for the purpose sought to be obtained, I
and made the federal reserve banks far !
greater in capital and resources than the '
Rank of England, the Lank of France j
or the Reichsbank of Germany, and thus i
would be more potential in correcting
panics and money stringency than are
those banks.
Accumulation Classed as Evil.
Senator Swanson maintained that one
of the greatest evils existing under our
banking system today was the vast ac
cumulation ox the reserves of the banks
in New York cit.v, which were used large-j
ly for stock speculation to the detriment
of business. !
ile approved of the provision of the bill
which limited the loans of tiie federal
reserve banks to commercial, industrial
ar.d agricultural purposes, saying that a
great advantage would accrue to all these
interests when the $tC;u,oOO,OUO of re
sources which would be provided for
these banks would, be dedicated to this
purpose and not used, as now, for" specula
tive ventures. He claimed that this would
insure accommt>dation to legitimate busi
ness and enterprise.
The advantages' which accrue to the
j country from requiring the deposits of the
j United States Treasury to be put in these
bank, were pointed out by Senator Swan
son. He ^aid this would give from $125 -
ou?,0uo to $210,000,000, now locked up, for
legitimate business purposes, much to the
advantage of commerce and trade.
I '
Yield Government Profit.
The senator claimed that the banks
would be very profitable, and from con
servative estimates made by experts
would yield the government annually in
i profit between $12,000,000 and $20,000 000
after paying 0 per cent interest on the
stock to the member banks.
The duty of the democratic party to
; pass this bill was clear, he said. He com
| rr ended the President for his courage and
insistence upon this legislation, declaring
that statesmanship consisted of both the
wisdom to discern the right pathway
and also the valor to follow it. He said
that the President possesses in a pVe
, eminent degree this capacity and courage
, which make real statesmanship.
Eastern Roads' Rates Attacked.
The New York Produce Exchange be
i fore the interstate commerce commission
| today attacked east-bound rates and
! regulations of the eastern railroads on
| grain, llaxseed and like commodities
I from western and northwestern state*.

Gen. Bixby Urges That Appor
(

to Let Down Bars.
MINIMUM SALARY, $1,000;
PENSIONS ON RETIREMENT
Chief of Army Engineers Says Best
Clerks Cannot Be Kept in
the Service.
| Retired pay for superannuated clerks,
the abolition of the nine-hundred-dollar
grade and the repeal of the statute ap
portioning appointments among the states
and territories on the basis of population
in order that more appointments may be '
given to residents of the District of Co- ;
| lumbia, are advocated lv Brig. Gen. i
j W. H. Bixby, in bis last annual report as
I chief of engine* rs of the army.
"The chief of engineers," he says, "has
received from the c ivilian employes of j
the office most loyal and efficient sup- \
port ami assistance in the transaction of ,
the duties devolving upon him. and takes
this opportunity to express the hope
that sorie provision will speedily be made
for their financial relief, when they be
come superannuated in the public service,
to which many of ther.i have devoted the
best years of their lives, the salaries of
the office clerks as fixed by law, and
practically unchanged for fifty years,
being too small, excepting in rare in
stances. to have permitted such accumu
lation as will provide for their support
when they become incapacitated for
active duty.
To Equalize Pensions.
It is believed, moreover, that In order
to give due credit to long years of serv
ice and to avoid undue credit to short
service under high pay, the annual com
pensation of retirement should be based
upon either the total compensation dur
ing all years of service (equal to number
of years multiplied by the average an
nual pay) or upon average pay multi
plied by some number varying with the
length of service.
"The recent experience of this office
in connection with appointments to the
clerical force appears to warrant my call
ing attention to the desirability of a
repeal or modification of the provision of
law requiring that appointments in the
departmental service shall be apportioned
to the several states and territories and ?
the District of Columbia in porportion i
to the population of each. The lower
clerical positions in the departments no
doubt appeared sufficiently inviting to
competent men throughout the country
thirty years ago to warrant this pro
vision of law, but conditions in this re
spect have completely changed with the
marked advance in the cost of all neces
sities of life without any compensating
general advance in salaries in the de- !
partmental service.
"Positions in the entrance clerical and
technical grades of the classified service
in Washington are not now, as a mle, so
sought after as to require their being
apportioned among the states as a matter
of equity or justice to the inhabitants
thereof, and the entrance salary in these
grades is as a rule too low to offer any
special inducement to a competent clerk
living at a distance to leave his home to
accept such a position.
Glad to Take Places.
4,On the other hand, there are many
well qualified individuals in Washington
and the neighboring states who would
be glad to accept such positions, because
they could live at home or at least near
their homes; but such persons cannot uow
be appointed on account of the apportion
ment.
"It is believed that ordinarily the lower
grades of service could be better filled
from the immediate vicinity than from a
distance, and that the better of these ap
pointees would be more likely to remain
in the service than they do under presen:
methods. Under the existing law it is
necessary for the civil service commis
sion to certify for appointment in many
casts individuals from distant states who
have barejy secured a sufficiently high
mark to render them e.igib.e, while eligi
bles from otb?.r states who have passed
much more creditable examinations may
remain uncertified until their period of
eligibility has expired. This corditon tends
to reduce the efficiency of the service, and
without any material compensating ad
vantage to the citizens of any state or
territory.
"Past experience demonstrates that it
is very difficult to secure the services of
suitable, efficient clerks at a salary of
fiKH), and owing 10 the slowness of promo
tion to the higiier grades, it is even more
difficult to retain the best; and as the up
per grades must, as a general ru.e, be
tilled by promotion from the lower grades,
a retention of the present nine-hundred
i dollar grade is decidedly detrimental
rather than beneflciat. It is be.leved to
be for the ultimate good of the service
that this grade be abolishe.d in this office,
and that the number of clerks at |1.00J
provided for the office of the chief of en
gineers be correspondingly increased. This
change is asked for in the estimates tub.
mitted this year."

HOUSTON, Tex., December 8.?Ninety
six persons were known to have perished
up to noon today in floods that have
swept through several sections of Texas.
Twenty-five of those drowned last night
or early today were in territory where
warnings have been posted for several
days.
The crest of the flood today v. as neiring

Cold weather that set in during the
night added to the discomfort of thou
sands of refugees in the south Texas
flood territory.
In Trees Awaiting Rescue.
Throughout the water-bound districts
of the Brazos, and Colorado rivers flood
victims waited in ginhouses and trees
for rescue boats to take them to concen
tration camps on the levees that re
mained above the tide.
While the Brazos crest reached the gulf
Saturday, its fall today wau slow, and the
territory along the river luo uiiles up
from the gulf exerienced u record over

ing was called yesterday on the receipt
of a telegram by Mayor Henry W. Kiel
from the mayor of Lagrange, Tex., ap

five-thousand-dollar contribution from
the Union Oil Company, a California
corporation, for the use of the democratic
state campaign. He was given until De
cember 1!2 to change or withdraw his
plea. Bail was flxed at *1,300, and the
bond was quickly f urn'shed.
Returning from the south Saturday
alter a trip in the tropics, McGuire last
night issued a long statement saying that
the charge against him was "a frame
up, hatched by interests whose materials
were rejected by the state."

United States Supreme Court
Refuses to Direct Review
of the Case.
Three Times Convicted of Embez
zling Funds of Co-Operative
Building Association.
The .Supreme Court of the United States
today refused the application of attorneys
for John Barton Miller, formerly secre
tary-treasurer of the now defunct First
Co-Operative Building Association of
Georgetown, for a writ of certiorari for
the review of his conviction by the Dis
trict Court of Appeals. The refusal of
the Supreme Court to grant the writ re
moves the last hope ente: tained by At
torneys Henry E. Davis and John E.
Laskey of saving Miller from a term in
prison.
The case against Miller has been one
of the most bitterly contested legal
battles ever waged in the courts of
the District of Columbia. Following ti^j
collapse in l'J'ts of the building asso
ciation in which he was seoretar>-treas
urer. Miller was indicted, the ind ctment,
which contained thirty-three counts, al
leging the misappropriation of more j
than $100,000 ol' the association's funds,
in addition to the destruction of many
of its books and records.
Twenty Years in Prison.
Tried first before Justice Stafford, a
verdict of guilty on two counts of the in
dictment, Involving the misapplication of
about $1,000, was returned, Justice Staf
ford thereupon, imposing a sentence of
ten years' imprisonment on each of the
counts, or twenty years in all. On tak
ing the case to the District Court of Ap
peals a new trial was ordered.
The verdict of the jury In the second
hearing was practically the same as that
returned at t!'e tirst trial, and Justice
Wright imposed a sentence aggregating
twenty years in the penitentiary. An
other appeal and a third trial followed.
Justice Gould this time passing sentence
of twenty years' imprisonment after the
jury had returned a verdict of guilty on I
J.he" two counts In the indictment.
Efforts to have the case again re
viewed by the District Court of Appeals
proving fruitless, Attorneys Davis and
Laskey prayed the Supreme Court of the
United States for a writ of certiorari to
compel the local court again to review
the long-pending case and to direct a
fourth trial for their client.
Wipes Out Final Hope.
The issuance of the writ was opposed
on the ground that Miller had been three
times convicted on the charges against
| him; that the sentences in each convic
i tion were the same?twenty years' im
i prisonnient?and that no new evidence;
i and no evidence of irregularities in the
! conduct of the p.evious trials had been
introduced or could be shown.
Touay's action of the Supreme Court
of the United States removes the final
hope for Miller and leaves the local
court free to enforce the prison sentence
imposed upon him by three separate
justices and as the result of three trials.
Attorneys Davis and Laskey were not
inclined to say what further steps would
be taken in behalf of their client, though
it was believed a brief delay will be
asked in order to permit .atller to close
up his business affairs here before enter
ing upon his prison sentence.

MYSTERY OF SEA FIRE
1 HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED
No Confirmation of Reported
Rescue of 197 Passengers
From Rio Grande.
NORFOLK, Va., December 8.?Mystery
surrounding the reported rescue of 1U7
passengers from the Mallory liner Rio
Grande during a lire at sea north of the
Diamond shoals early yesterday remain
ed unsolved today, and though the wire
less of the south Atlantic coast was
reaching out for information none was
obtained to clear up several conflicting
reports.
Although a wireless from Virginia
Beach to New York late last night re
ported Capt. Dodge of the British steam
er Swanmore having made the rescue, the
Swanmore is at her wharf at Baltimore.
Suwanee Has No News.
The captain of the Merchants and
Miners' liner Suwanee, which was in the
vicinity, was spoken late last night by
the Charleston. S. C., wireless and knew
nothing of the affair.
Agents of the Mallory line say the Rio
Grande was not licensed to carry passen
gers, and therefore- the passengers could
not have been taken from that ship.
Fire Under Control.
The following wireless report was re
ceived here early this afternoon:
"Steamer Swanmore at 11:34 a.m. today
reports steamer Rio Grande proceeding
south under her own steam. Fire prac
tically out. Does not need assistance."
It now appears quite certain that the
steamer Swanmore is the steamer Quern
more, which passed out of Cape Henry
Saturday, and which has been mistaken
over wireless and reported Swanmore.
The Quernmore is fitted with wireless.

NOT BY HIS ORDER
President Wilson Says Depart
ment of Justice Is Not
Responsible.
CHARGES OF UNFAIRNESS
AGAINST LABOR CHIEF
Dissatisfaction Expressed With
" Course of Secretary Wilson?Clem
ents May Be Reappointed.
i
Replying to inquiries today. President
W ilson stated that the Department of i
Justice hud nothing to do with bringing
the indictments in Colorado that ha\e
been returned against a number of high j
i officials of the United Mine Workers. As
| the President understands the matter, the
i indictments were returned by the grand
jury on its own initiative, and without
| suggestion from the United States attor
i ney or any one else connected with the
' Department of Justicc.
T'ne President, however, did not shed
any light upon the question that must
ultimately come up on the assistance that
may or may not be given by the Depart- j
ment of Justice to the prosecution of tne ;
I indictments. ' j
1 The President, It is known, takes the i
position that the prohibition of the sun
dry civil bill against using any of that
appropriation to prosecute officials of
labor unions under the Sherman anti- i
trust law does not interfere in any man
ner with the ?usual processes of jus
tice." The sundry civil biil simply pre
vented any of the three-hundred-thou
sand-dollar appropriation from being used
against labor organizations. There a-e
other funds that may be used should the
department desire to lend its aid in prose
cutions.
Keeping President Advised.
The presumption is strong that the
indictment of the officials of the mine
workers will be fully reported to the
Department of Justice by the. I nited
States attorney of Colorado, and that
Secretary Wilson of the Department of
Labor, Who has been in Colorado a long
time, will also report all these ^mat
ters, as he has been doing others, oireot
to the President. A decision must be
reached as to whether the administra
tion will offer the usual processes in
criminal indictments, which will mean
the legal machinery of the Department
of Justice. Almost the same situation
arose some time ago in West \irginia
and has not been settled. . .
Indictments were returned there against
officials of the mine workers' organiza
tion but these indictments were suggest
ed by the United St^teaattorney of tne
southorvriiitrtet.?*-wpjWBean.
Charges are openly being made that
Secretarv Wilson of the Department or
Labor, formerly secretary-treasurer of
the United Mine Workers of America, is
! using his power against employers of ?a
bor and Iu behalf of strikers.
Storm Likely to Break.
Dissatisfaction is being voiced against
the methods of the department from va
rious directions, it is said, and a storm
is likely to break at any time when or
ganizations of employers of labor finish
investigations now going on. if these in
vestigations corroborate the charge that
? he Department of Labor as at present
operated seeks to bring about settlements
of strikes favorable to one Side and show s
prejudice against the other. . .
President Wilson is disposed, it is
isaid. to feel that his cabinet officer is
uniustly criticised, but he will, if it be
i comes necessary, give consideration to
facts laid before him by reputable ni^n
i Senator Thomas of Colorado. who has
several times talked with the Presi
dent about the Colorado coal strike
situation, visited the President today.
The situation is said to be
more seriouB, with little prospect that
ihe administration will be abie to ef
fect a settlement.
Trust Message After Holidays.
President Wilson will adhere to his
position of many months that Congress
ought to work out ome big problem at a
time before another is injected, and he
will not address that body upon the sub
ject of additional trust legislation until !
the currency question lias been disposed!
of. Inasmuch as the President is d.s- j
i nosed to believe tnat currency legislation
: will be accomplished before Cnnstmas
he will advise Congress of his views on
currency after the holidays. The Presi
dent is hopeful tnat he will have oppor
tunity to enjoy a vacation during the
Christmas and New Year period. If there
is such a vacation he will go away from
Washington, but is not decided where
Jhe place will be. He has intimated that
Mrs. Wilson will have much to say on
^^Conferences on proposed trust legisla- !
tion will fake place between now and
the adjournment of Congress. In "com
mon counsel" with Senate and House
leaders of his party the President will
ascertain sentiment and the administra
tion measure will be an outcome of this
counsel. There will be an administra
tion measure, as there has betn with t- e
tariff and currency, and it will follow
=ometh.ng of the same course these other
measures have followed.
Backing Commissioner Clements.
Further pressure in behalf of Jud- j
son C. Clements as hie own successor ;
on the Interstate commerce commis- j
sion was exerted at the White House j
today, when Representatives Adam- ?
c0n and Stevens, representing the
Ilouse committee on interstate and j
foreign commerce, called on Presi
dent Wilson to tell him that the en
tire membership of the committee be
lieved that the great experience and
wisdom of Commissioner Clements j
should insure him another term iu j
I office The President has found an |
enormous sentiment in behalf of Mr.
foments. The White House, it is I
i has never had objection to the
commissioner as a man and official,
but the policy of the President, in
,-ases of this kind has been to name
comparatively young men. Commis
sioner Clements' age has been against
him under this policy. The belief to
dav is that the President may make
an" exception in Mr. Clements' case and
trive him another term.
The Texas democratic congressional
delegation came forward today with a
candidate in the person of Allison May
tield a member of the Texas railroad
commission. The delegation told the
President that Mr. Mayfield was fully
equipped to take up the important work
of this commission.
Presented to President Wilson.
Sir Robert Hadtield of Sheffield, Eng
'and, called upon Secretary Daniels today,
and later was presented by Mr. Daniels
to President Wilson. Sir Robert and
l^ady Hadfleld plan to visit the Naval
Academy at Aanapoli* before returning
I to England. _
Inquiry Committee Fails to
Find Foundation for Lob
byist's Story.
McDERMOTT GETS REBUKE
FOR "GRAVE IMPROPRIETY"
Censure Is Based on McMichael Te?
timony in Loan Shark and
Liquor Matters.
In the report on the Mulhall charges?
that a lobby of the National Association
of Manufacturers has been at work
among the members of the* House?to be
presented by Chairman Garrett before
the House tomorrow, the committee ex
presses the view that "the. most serlou*
question of propriety affecting Repre
sentative McDermott of I'lifJois is not in
connection with th.- N. A. Nl ., but grows
i out of his acts and dealings with the
j Liquor Dealers' Association of the Dis
trict of Columbia, and George Horning,
j one of the pawnbrokers to which allusion
I has been made."
The committee fails to find that the ac
[ cusations of Col. Mulhall have besmirched
the characters of the members of th??
: House, but it sharply raps the methods
employed by the legislative agents of the
National Association of Manufacturers.
' It. states that the one tanglb.e allegation
\ concerns Repr>-s< ntative McDeruiott. 1 lie
committee, however, makes no reconimcn
1 dation to the House in the case.
I
McMichael Testimony Cited.
I In covering the McDermott case the
report gives the testimony of I. It. Mc
: Michael that McDermott said he had re
ceived $7,300 for fighting the anti-loan
! shark legislation in this District, and that
j McDermott met Horning in Ne.w York to
! arrange for the deal. This testimony.
? stoutly combated and denied by McDer
j ir.ott, was one of the crucial j*>ints in
the case.
' The report a'so outlines the borrowing
of *.V*> fro in Hugh Harvey, president of
1 the Liquor Dealers' Association of the
! District of Columbia at that time. '1 he
i loan was not repaid at the time Mr.
1 Harvey appeared on the witness stand.
I It also states that McDermott borrowed
S1.0<m from George Horning. together
with McDermott's denial that these loans
had to do either with loan 6hark legis
lation or the then pending excise bill.
Charges "Grave Impropriety."
The report states:
"Tour committee can go no further
than upvtain a*4 t-eporyto the House
the facts as it finds them<
"We cannot read tSie'heart and con
science of Mr. McDermott and those with
j whom he dealt in tb* various transae
! tions ?nd affairs that have been related.
"There is not upon our part the slightest
feeling against him and under no cir
cumatances would we do him any in
justice Undoubtedly his training hM
not given him the standard that char
acterizes public men generally.
"We cannot say that he has been cor
i rupted in his legislative duty or that
I his official acts and votes ha\ e been cor
i ruptly Influenced, but we shouid feel that
we have shirked a duty which we owe
the House and the country did we not

Minority to Submit Report.
A minarity report on the subject, to
be submitted tomorrow from Representa

than the report by Representative Garrett
of Tennessee. It states that the popular
branch of government must be kept abo\ e
