iHfUIE DEFENCE
IS DISCUSSED
Intelligence Officer Says'
RffimnK Shmild Rallv to I
Home League.
Plans lor increasing the member
ship of the Bl Paso Home Defence
league were discussed Tuesday night
at a directors' meeting in. the court
house, at which Lieut. CoL Harry O.
Willard. district Intelligence officer
of the army, and Judge F. E. Hunter
made addresses, and the constitution
and by laws were amended to permit
an increase In membership from MO
to ISM.
1 don't suppose any man in El
Paso has taken more interest in the
Home Defence league that I. said
Lieut. Col. Williard, "and 1 don't see
how any one who ealls himself a pa
triotic citizen can fail to identify
himself with the league. 'Let George
do it,' seems to be the watchword
with many when It comes to a mat
ter of effective action and organ na
tion." More Troops Slar Leave
Lieu t. Col. Williard referred to the
possibility of more troops being taken
away from El Paso as the war goes
en and to tie limited power and
number of local police, and showed
the advantages of a strong defence
league in case of invasion, or attempts
at looting by organized bands. Under
the rule of the military in crises, he
said, those who bad drilled and
served in the league would be allowed
in the streets.
Judge Hunter said. that as citizens
had subscribed to two Liberty loans,
and would have to subscribe to two
more, and that as they had subscribed
to the Red Cross and to the T. M. C.
A, it did not seem quite logical that
they should neglect to subscribe for
something that promised the im
mediate protection of homes.
Sngirest Ways to Get Members.
B. J. Zabrlskle and Roy D. Barnum
suggested ways of increasing the
membership during the campaign, and
R. Burt Orndorff. chairman of the
board of directors, told of his inv
tigation of defence leafme work being
carried on in New York.
An expense fund for the league was
started by A- Schwartz, and it was an
nounced that checks were to be ac
cepted hereafter, though prior to this
time such offers had been rejected.
Fewer Directors Called For.
Instead of 12. as formerly, there are
to be six directors under the redrafted
constitution. Two of the directors are
said to have been dropped for failure
to attend the meetings regularly, and
two resigned on account of business
which interfered with their work as
directors. From now on, it was said,
they would be seen as "buck" privates
In the racks,'
The work of placing posters about
the city soliciting membership is soon
to be under war, it was. stated, and
the league is to be discussed from the
n-jipits of the city Wednesday and
Sunday. 1

1600 FIRMS 0
0. S. BLACKLIST
Large Number in Mexico;
Americans Forbidden to
Trade With Them. j
Washington D. C . Dec. 5. The I
names of many firms in Mexico are
contained "n an official blacklist of
1600 firms promulgated last night by
the war-trade board. Citizens el the
United States are forbidden to do
business with the blacklisted firms.
It Is officially styled the "enemy trad
ing list" and is the first section of a
list which eventually will include the
names of firms in most of the coun
tries of the world, including the
United States itself.
Latin-America is dealt with first
because of the large numbeu. of Ger
man firms in the southern republics
active in aiding German's cause. Evi
dence put before the war trade board
has shown that many of these firms.
Including public utilities companies,
have financed to a large decree Ger
man propaganda work in the United
States. All those named in the list
have been charged with secretly or
openly assisting America's enemies.
Is for Guidance of V. S. Firms.
The action is taken under autbority
cenferred on the president by the
trading with the enemy act and is
designed solely for the guidance of
American concerns to enable them to
observe the provisions of the law.
Any licenses issued for trading with
firms named in the list will be apart
from the regular export and import
licenses which must be obtained for
shipment in or out of the United
States of most commodities.
It is possible that in many instances
licenses may Jje issued as it may be
found that trading in certain com
modities with these named in the list
will not work to any advantage for
Germany or her allies.
Will Classify Tton-Enemy Firms.
To minimize inconvenience to mer
chants tn this country, arising from
the declaration, the war board will
classify the names of non-enemy firms
dealing in the same commodities who
may serve as substitutes for the
blacklisted concerns.
In issuing the list officials make it
plain tflat it cannot be maue com
plete and that merchants trading with
enemy firms not named are in no
measure relieved from prohibitions
and penalties contained in the trading
with enemy act. Most of the firms
named in the list issued last night
bear German names, although others i
evidently are of English. Spanish,
French and Portuguese derivation. !
The list as it applies to Brazil con- I
tains the greatest number of firms, I
with Mexico second. I

SRITISH PRAISE
WILSON SPEECH
Consider It a Lofty State
ment of Ideals, Represen
tative of Allies.
London, Eng.. Dec. 5. President
Wilson's, message to congress has the
fullest prominence in the morning
newspapers nut it reached London too
late for much considered comment
The Daily News received warmly the
president's declaration tflat peace
should be based on generosity and
Justice to the exclusion of selfish
claims. It adds:
"It would be affectation to pretend
that this language echoes the
declaration of the European spokes
men of the alliance. U is the voice
of a statesman whose vision com
prehends the world, while their eyes
comprehend half a world.
Slight Have Saved Russia.
"If president Wilson could have
said earlier what he said yesterday
and if in Great Britain. France and
Italy the responsible leaders had
made his languege their own. Russia
might today be driving the enemies
from her borders. It may be too late
to convince Russia f the identity of
aim of herself and the allied demo
cracies, but it must not be too late
for those) democracies to learn from
their greatest representative now
democracies should comport them
selves In war and how they should
attain peace,
Xo Afier War Boycott.
"In the light of president Wilson's
speech a statement that. will mean
the wiping off the slate of much- that
should never have been written on it
is imperative. There Is no kinship
bettieen the spirit of yesterday's
speech and the spirit ot knockout
blows or economic warfare or after
the war boycotts."
o Half Tones In Message.
"There are no ambiguous phrases
on which, militarists may feed the Il
lusions of their dupes, no bits ot
compromise and no suggestion of
faltering or doubt to raise the spirits
ot the pacific. With this straight
forward and logical statement of
America's war aims the last hope of
the pacifists must founder."
o Distinction Between Foes.
The Times reiterates that former
ly it expressed dissent with president
Wilson's distinction between the
German people and their ruler and
says It can no more distinguish be
tween them than the president can
any longer distinguish between Ger
many and Austria-Hungary, believing
them vllling accomplices of their
ruler.
Statement Lofty In Spirit.
The Daily Graphic says:
"Whether this restatement, so lofty
in spirit, so forward looking in ef
.'ect, will have any Influence on Ger
man opinion is doubtful. Then, the
only resort is to inflict such a mili
tary defeat upon Germany as to con
vince the Germans of the Infamy of
their rulers In this connection it is
an excellent Omen that the confer
ence in Paris reached such a com
plete unanimity. Anrertda was repre
sented at the conference and there
follows that the war aims of the
allies no longer can be described in
