Washington, Dec. 7.—The first dsy
of the second session of the Fifty-fourth
congress presented no remarkable feat,
ures. There were 71 senators In their
seats and 18 absentees. The president s
message was read without apparently
evoking any special Interest, the onlt
exception to that rule being to the por
tions of the message devoted to Armen
ian outrages and to the revolution In
Cuba. On the first of these subjects
the president states his belief "that the
present sombre prospect In Turkey will
not be long permitted to oBend the sight
of C'iristendom,"
The president's discussion of the
Cuban question Is extensive and Impar
tial but Its summing up Indicates the
temper and views of the administration.
It Is these words:
"When the inability
ol Spain to deal successfully with the
Insurrection has become manifest, a
situation will be presented In which
obligations to the sovereignty of Spat
will be superseded by higher obligation
which we can hardly hesitate to
nize and discharge."
These declarations appeared to obtain
general favor and approval,
sage covered 18 printed pamplet pages
and Its reading occupied one hour and
fifty minutes.
