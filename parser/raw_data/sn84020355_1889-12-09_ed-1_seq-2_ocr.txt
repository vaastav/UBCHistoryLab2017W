Hell is an likely to go Methodist
an Mi'Kutmn or Morrow's districts are
to go for thorn for unother Congres
sional term. [Times Review.
When the above named citizens re
turn to tiieir constituents, burdened
with the onros of their arduous labors
in Congress, it will only he necessary
tor thetu to proclaim their fealty to
llepuhlicau principles, tell the voters
of their respective districts that the
force of circumstances compelled
litem to vote for Heed, who is a friend
of silver in disguise, that, the Demo
crats are enemies to silver uud "pro
tection," and the Times-Review will
learn that its prediction is based up
on the theory that the people think
more of principle than they do of
party* which Ib not trus. McKenna
and Morrow will be re elected in spite
of hell, Methodism or high water,
"and don't you fail to forget it." j

!)nna ou The Message.
The Now York Sun, which rather
favored the election of Harrison, und
which bitterly opposed Cleveland,
??illumines" the President's message
in this manner: I
"For originality, grasp of public
questions, sense of perspective in the
statement of the condition of natural
affairs, Harrison's message compares
unfavorably with the llrst message
sent to Congress by President Hayes.
This is saying rather a severe thing,
but it is strictly true. Tho weakest
man who ever occupied the White
House hud more to offer Congress in i
the way of information and sugges- ?
tions, offered with more vigorous
individuality of expression than the
present chief executive of the United
States can exhibit or command."

Servants are M unmanageable I*
Buenos Ayres ns they ere every where
else, end In many respects more trying.
General house workers ere unknown. I
For the smellest family one needs e
cook, e housemaid end. Instead of a
maid-of-all-work, e boy of any age from
ten years, and 1 have seen even younger
on duty In native households. Besides
these no washing can be done at home.
There was, 1 am told, at one time even
a law against the drying of olothes In
one's own patio or on the roof. Af any
rate a laundress is an almost impossible
person to get and olothes are given out
to the lavandaras, who support them*
selves by the pursuit of that profession
alone. They wash in the river, which
is very wide, and very shallow on its .
southern shore, and rising only when
gales are blowing from the Bea leaves
on Its retiring great pools of water in
the hollows of the beach. These pools
are the wash-tube for the whole city and
flat stones are used as boards, the
clothes being rubbed between two such;
so it Is not to bo wondered at that all
kinds of wash goods want frequent re
placing. The same women who wash
do not iron. They are themselves em
ployed by the person engaged by one's
self, who usually Is the ironer and who
receives the pay fpr the whole. 1 found
* ? i _ ... - * ' *
*ms arrangement very unsatisfactory,
for them was no one person who seemed
to be responsible tor the return of the
things and for the manner in which
they were done. It in a fault found by
every one, but thorn neetnn to be no way
of remedying It. 8omo few families
have nunooeded in getting regular
laundresses to join their retinue of serv
anta, but it in still a hard thing to
manage and the cooks object to it.
Wages are high. Cooks get from 81ft to
f?25; these am not remarkable servants,
but only ordinary ones. Men* French
or Italian oulslniuA, are much bettor
paid. The merest slip of s housemaid
will get from 913 to 818, and the neces
sary munhaoo gets nearly the same.?

FEASTING IN SARDINIA.
Home Curio** Feature* of Mr* In an Itaft.
Inn Province.
f If religious festivals make a people re
ligious, the Sanies are among the most
religious of nations. Seldom did wo en
ter a town or village without finding
the placo either in the midst of a festa,
anticipating a coming festa or discussing
the festa Just ended.
Scattered over the Island are a multi
tude of small chapels, dedicated to ob
scure salats, and to which tho villagers
for miles round (look with provisions
and bedding once or twice a year. They
camp out In tho open or sleep in adja
cent caves; a priest says mass in their
midst, and they all eat and drink as if
| they had never before had a good moai*
| or as if tho rest of their lives was to be
one of long fast.
A disagreeable litter of ox bones, ribs
of sheep, orango-poel, bean skins and
stones of olives, strewn amid tho grass
near the hermitage, or on tho lovol earth
at tno very cnurou aoor, dears constant
witness to tho travelor of this sort of re
ligions Junketing up and down tho land.
The following statistics of food con
sumed at a traditional gathering, mere
ly to celebrate the ordination of a priest
tn the district of Mamojada, shadows
forth the magnitude of the Sardo festas
in general
Two thousand five hundred people
were present, and between them they
ate 32 cows, 20 calves, 28 door and wild
boars, 740 sheep, 800 lambs, kidllngs and
sucking pigs, 000 fowls, 00 measures?of
what size indeterminate?of sugar, 00
pounds of popper and sploos, 280 meas
ures of corn, a hundredweight of rioe, a
hundred weight of dates, AO sugared
cakes, 8,000 eggs, 28 large barrels of
wino, 8,000 fish and a vast quantity of
confectionery.?Chambers* Journal.

the dllTorcnt nations Is said to he as

spoken by 22,00*000 of people, Is now
spoken by 100.000,000; Russian is now
spoken by 68,000,000 against 80,000,000
at the beginning of the century. In
1801 German was only spoken by 85,
?00,000 of peoplo, to-day over 70,000,000
