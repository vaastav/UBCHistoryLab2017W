THE "WXLMINGTON MESSENGER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1907.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
(Continued from Page 6)
had been reached, and resolutions
were adopted marking the progress
made in. matters upon which agree
ment T.vas not yet sufficiently com
plete to make conventions practi
cable. The delegates of the United States
were instructed to favor an agree
ment for obligatory arbitration, the
establishment of a permanent court
of arbitration to proceed judicially
in the hearing and decision of in
ternational causes, the prohibition of
force for the collection of contract
debts alleged to be due from gov
ernment to citizens of other coun
tries until after arbitration as to the
justice and amount of the debt and
the time and manner of payment,
the immunity of private property at
sea, the better definition of the
rights of neutrals, and, in case any
measure to that end should be in
troduced, the limitation of arma
ments. In the field of peaceful disposal
of international differences several
Important advances were made.
First, as to the obligatory arbitra
tion. Although the conference fail
ed to secure a unanimous agreement
upon the details of a convention for
obligatory arbitration, it did resolve
as follows':
"It is unanimous: (1) In accept
ing the principle for obligatory ar
bitration; (2) In declaring that cer
tain differences, and notably those
relating to the interpretation and ap
plication of international conven
tional stipulations are susceptible of
being submitted to obligatory arbi
tration without any restriction."
In view of the fact that as a re
sult of the discussion the vote upon
the definite treaty of obligatory ar
bitration, which was proposed, stood
32 in favor to 9 against the adop
tion of the treaty, there can be lit
tle doubt that the great majority of
the countries of the world have
reached a point where they are now
ready to apply practically the prin
ciples thus unanimously agree upon
by the conference.
The second advance, and a very
great one, is the agreement which
relates to the use of force for the
collection of contract debts. Your
attention is invited to the para
graphs upon this subject In my mes
sage of December, 1906, and to the
resolution of the Third American
Conference at Rio in . the summer
of 1906. The convention upon this
subject adopted by the conference
substantially as proposed by the
American delegates is as follows:
"In order to avoid between na
tions armed conflicts of a purely pe-;
cuniary origin arising from contract
ual debts claimed of the government j
of one country by the government
of another country to be due to its
nationals, the signatory powers agree
not to have recourse to armed force
for the collection of such contractual i
debts.
"However, this stipulation shall
not be applicable when the debtor
state refuses or leaves unanswered
an offer to arbitrate, or, in case of
acceptance, makes it impossible to
formulate the terms of submission,
or, after arbitration, fails to com
ply with the award rendered.
"It is further agreed that arbitra
tion here contemplated shall be in
conformity, as to procedure, with
Chapter III of the Convention for
the Pacific Settlement of Internation
al Disputes adopted at The Hague,
and that it shall determine, in so
far as there shall be no agreement
between the parties, the justice and
the amount of the debt, the time and
mode of payment thereof."
Such a provision would have pre
vented much injustice and extortion
in the past, and I cannot doubt that
its effect in the future will be most
salutary.
A third advance has been made in
amending and perfecting the conven
tion of 1899 for the voluntary set
tlement of international disputes,
and particularly the extension of
those parts of that convention which
relate to commissions of inquiry.
The existence of those provisions en
abled the governments of Great Brit
ain and Russia to avoid war, not
withstanding great public excite
ment, at the time of the Dogger
Bank incident, and the new conven
tion agreed upon by the conference
gives practical effect to the experi
ence gained in that inquiry.
Substantial progress was also
made towards the creation of a per
manent judicial tribunal for the de
termination of international causes.
There was very full discussion of
the proposal for such a court and a
general agreement was finally reach
ed in favor of its creation. The con
ference recommended to the signa
tory powers the adoption of a draft
upon which it agreed for the organi
sation of the court, leaving to be
determined only the method by
which the judges should be selected.
This remaining unsettled question is
plainly one which time and good
temper will solve.
A further agreement of the first
importance was that for the crea
tion of an international prize court.
The constitution, organization and
procedure of such a tribunal were
provided for in detail. Anyone who
Tecalls the injustices under which
this country suffered as a neutral
power during the early part of the
last century can not fail to see in
this provision for an international
prize court the great advance which
the world is making towards the
substitution of the rule of reason
and justice in place of simple force.
Not only will the international prize
court be the means of protecting the
interests of neutrals, but it is in
itself a step towards the creation of
the more general court for the hear
ing of international controversies to
which reference has just been made.
The organization and action of such
a prize court can not fail to accus
tom the different countries to the
submission of international ques
tions to the decision of an interna
tional tribunal, and we may confi
dently expect the results of such sub
mission to bring about a general
agreement upon the enlargement of
the practice.
Numerous provisions were adopt
ed for reducing the evil effects of
irar and for defining the rights and
duties of neutrals.
The conference also proTlded for
the holding of a third conference
within a period similar to that which
elapsed between the first and second
conferences.
The delegates of the United States
worthily represented the spirit of
the American people and maintain
ed with fidelity and ability the pol
icy of our government upon all the
great questions discussed In the con
ference. The report of the delegation, to
gether with authenticated copies of
the conventions signed, when re
ceived, will be laid before the sen
ate for its consideration.
When we remember how difficult
it is for one of our own legislative
bodies, composed of citizens of the
same country, speaking the same lan
guage, living under the same laws,
and having the same customs, to
reach an agreement, or even to se
cure a majority upon any difficult
J and important subject which is pro
posed for legislation, u Decomes
plain that the representatives of
forty-five different countries, speak
ing many different languages, ac
customed to different methods of
procedure, with widely diverse in
terests, who discussed so many dif
ferent subjects and reachel agree
ments upon so many, are entitled to
grateful appreciation for the wisdom,
patience and moderation with which
they have discharged their duty.
The example of this temperate dis
cussion, and the agreements and ef
forts to agree, among representa
tives of all the nations of the earth,
acting with universal recognition of
the supreme obligation to promote
peace, can not fail to be a power
ful influence for good in future in
ternational relations.
CUBA.
A year ago in consequence of a
revolutionary movement in Cuba
which threatened the immediate re
turn to chaos of the island, the
United States intervened, sending
down an army and establishing a
provisional government under Gov
ernor Magoon. Absolute quiet and
prosperity have returned to the is
land because of this action. We
are now taking steps to provide for
elections in the island and our ex
pectation is within" the coming year
to be able to turn the island over
again to a government chosen by
the people thereof. Cuba is at our
doors. It is not possible that this
nation should permit Cuba again to
sink into the condition from which
we rescued it. All that we ask of
the Cuban people is that they be
prosperous, that they govern them
selves so as to bring content, order
and progress to their island, the
Queen of the Antilles; and our only
interference has been and will be to
help them achieve these results.
TIIK JAPANESE EXPOSITION.
An invitation has been extended
by Japan to the government and
people of the United States to par
ticipate in a great national expo
sition to be held at Tokyo from
April 1 to October 31, 1912, and
in which the principal countries of
the world are to be invited to take
part. This is an occasion of special
interest to all the nations of the
world, and peculiarly so to us; for
it is the first instance in which such
a great national exposition has been
held by a great power dwelling on
the Pacific; and all the nations of
Europe and America will, I trust,
join in helping to success this first
great exposition ever held by a great
nation of Asia. The geographical
relations of Japan and the United
States as the possessors of such large
portions of the coasts of the Pacific,
the intimate trade relations already
existing between the two countries,
the warm friendship which has been
maintained between them without
break since the opening of Japan
to intercourse with the western na
tions, and her increasing wealth and
production, which we regard with
hearty goodwill and wish to make
the occasion of mutually beneficial
commerce, all unite in making it
eminently desirable that this invita
tion should be accepted. V heartilly
recommend such legislation as will
provide in generous fashion for the
representation of this government
and its people in the proposed ex
position. Action should be taken
now. We are apt to underestimate
the time necessary for preparation in
such cases. The invitation to the
French exposition of 1900 was
brought to the attention of the con
gress by President Cleveland in De
cember, 1895; and so many are the
delays necessary to such proceedings
that the period of four years and a
half which then intervened before
the exposition proved none too long
for the proper preparation of the
exhibits.
GERMAN TARIFF AGREEMENT.
The adoption of a new tariff by
Germany, accompanied by conven
tions for reciprocal tariff concessions
between that country and most of
the other countries of continental
Europe, led the German government
to give the notice necessary to ter
minate . the reciprocal commercial
agreement with this country pro
claimed July 13, 1900. The notice
was to take effect on the 1st of
March, 1906, and in default of some
other arrangements this would have
left the exports from the United
States to Germany subject to the
general German tariff duties, from
25 to 50 per cent, higher than the
conventional duties imposed upon
the goods of most of our competi
tors for German trade.
Under a special agreement made
between the two governments in
February, 1906, the German govern
ment postponed the operation of
their notice until the 30th of June,
1907. In the meantime, deeming it
to be my duty to make every pos
sible effort to prevent a tariff war
between the United States and Ger
many arising from misunderstand
ing by either country of the condi
tions existing in the other, and act
ing upon the invitation of the Ger
man government, I sent to Berlin
a commission composed of compe
tent experts in the operation and
administration of the customs tariff,
from the departments of the Treas
ury and Commerce and Labor. This
commission was engaged for several
months in conference with a similar
commission appointed by the Ger
man government, under instructions,
so far as practicable, to reach, a com-
mon understanding as to all the
facts regarding the tariffs of the
United States and Germany mate
rial and relevant to the trad rela
tions between the two countries. The
commission reported, and upoa the
basis of the report, a further tem
porary commercial agreement was
entered into by the two countries, pur
suant to which, in the exercise of the
authority conferred upon the presi
dent by the third section of the tariff
act of July 24, 1897, I extended the
reduced tariff rates provided for in
that section to champagne and aK
other sparkling wines, and pursuant
to which the German conventional
or minimum tariff rates were ex
tended to about 961 per cent, of
all the exports from the United
States to Germany. This agreement
is to remain in force until the 30th
of June, 1908, and until six months
after notice by either party to ter
minate it.
The agreement and the report of
the commission on which it is based
will be laid before the congress for
its information.
This careful examination into the
tariff relations between the United
States and Germany involved an in
quiry into certain of our methods
of administration which had been
the cause of much complaint on the
part of German exporters. In this
inquiry I became satisfied that cer
tain vicious and unjustifiable prac
tices had grown up in our customs
administration, notably the practice
of determining values of imports
upon detective reports never dis
closed to the persons whose inter
ests were affected. The use of de
tectives, though often necessary,
tends towards abuse, and should be
carefully guarded. Under our prac
tice as I found it to exist in this
case, the abuse had become gross
and discreditable. Under it, instead
of seeking information as to the
market value of merchandise from
the well-known and respected mem
bers of the commercial community
in the country of its production, se
cret statements were obtained from
informers and discharged employees
and business rivals, and upon this
kind of secret evidence the values of
imported goods were frequently rais
ed and heavy penalties were fre
quently imposed upon importers
who were never permitted to know
what the evidence was and who
never had an opportunity to meet it.
It is quite probable that this sys
tem tended towards an increase of
j the duties collected upon imported
goods, but I conceive it to be a vio-
J Istion of law to exact more duties
than the law provides, just as it is
a violation to admit goods upon the
payment of less than the legal rate
of "duty. This practice was re
pugnant to the spirit of American
law and to American sense of jus
tice. In the judgment of the most
competent experts of the Treasury
Department and the Department of
Commerce and Labor it was wholly
unnecessary for the due collection
of the customs revenues, and the
attempt to defend it merely illus
trates the demoralization which nat
urally follows from a long continued
! course of reliance upon such meth-
J ods. I accordingly caused the reg
ulations governing this branch of
the customs service to be modified
so that values are determined upon
a hearing in which all the parties
interested have an opportunity to be
heard and to know the evidence
against them. Moreover, our treas
ury agents are accredited to the gov
ernment of the country in which
they seek information, and in Ger
many receive the assistance of the
quasi-official chambers of commerce
in determining the actual market
value of goods, in accordance with
what I am advised to be the true
construction of the law.
These changes of regulations were
adapted to the removal of such man
ifest abuses that I have not felt that
they ought to be confined to our re
lations with Germany; and I have
extended their operation to all other
countries which have expressed a
desire to enter into similar admin
istrative relations. -. '

NATIONAL BISCUIT COMPANY
crrrxA.
I ask for authority to re-form the j
agreement with China under which ;
the indemnity of 1900 was ffxed, by ;
remitting and cancelling the obliga- !
tioi of China for tse payment of all j
that part of the stipulated r&demn- !
ity which is in excess of the sum j
of eleven million, six' hundred1 and '
flfty-ffve thousand, four hundred and (
ninety-two dollars and sixty-nine '
cents, and interest at four per cent, j
After the rescue of the foreign Ie- .
gations in Peking during the Bczier .
troubles in 1900 the powers requir
ed from China the payment of equi- ,
table indemnities to thr several na- !
tions, and the final protocol under i
which the troops were withdrawn, .
signed at Peking, September 7, 1901r;
fixed the amount of this indemnity i
allotted to the United States at over
$20,000,000, and China paid, up to
and including the 1st day of June,
last, a little Over $6,000,000. It
"vas the first intention of this govern
ment at the proper time, when all
claims had been presented and all
expenses ascertained as fully as pos
sible, to-revise the estimates and ac
count, and -as -a proof of sincere
friendship - for- China voluntarily to
release- that "country from its legal
liability for all payments in excess
of the sum ' which ' should prove, to
be necessary for actual indemnity to
the United States and its citizens.
CHINESE STUDENTS.
This nation should help in every
practicable way in the education of
the Chinese people, so that the vast
and populous empire of China may
gradually adapt itself to modern
conditions. One way of doing this
is by promoting the coming of Chi
nese students to this country and
making it attractive to them to take
courses at our universities and high
ed educational institutions. Our ed
ucators should, so far as possible,
take concerted action toward this
end.
MEXICO AND CENTKALi AMERICA.
On the courteous invitation of
the president of Mexico, the secre
tary of state visited that country in.
September and October and was re
ceived everywhere with the greatest
kindness and hospitality.
He carried from the government
of the United States to our south
ern neighbor a message of respect
and f:ocI-will and of desire for bet
ter acquaintance and increasing
friendship. The response from the
government and the people of Mex
ico was hearty and sincere. No pains
were spared to manifest the most
I friendly attitude and feeling toward
I the United States.
In view df the close neighborhood
of the two countries the relations
which exist between Mexico and the
United States are just cause for
gratification. We have a common
boundary of over 1,500 miles from
the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific.
Much of it is marked only by the
shifting waters of the Rio Grande.
Many thousands of Mexicans are re
siding upon our side of the line and
It is estimated that over 40,000
Americans are resident in Mexican
territory and that American invest
ments in Mexico amount to over sev
en hundred million dollars. The ex
traordinary industrial and commer
cial prosperity of Mexico has been
greatly promoted by American en
terprise, and Americans are sharing
largely in its results. The foreign
tra,de of the republic already ex
ceeds $240,000,000 per annum, and
of this two-thirds both of exports
and imports are exchanged with the
United States. Under these circum
stances numerous questions neces
sarily arise between the two coun
tries. These questions are always
approached and disposed of in a
spirit of mutual courtesy and fair
dealing. Americans carrying on
business in Mexico testify uniformly
to the kindness and consideration
with which they are treated and
their sense of the security of their
property and enterprises under the
wise administration of the great
statesman who has so long held the
office of chief magistrate of that re
public. .
T4
The two govern men Li have been
uniting their efforts for a consider
able time past to aid Ceatral Amer
ica in attaining the degre of peace
and order which have niatie possible
the prosperity of the northern parts
of the continent. After the peace
betwreen Guatemala, Honduras and
Salvador, celebrated under the cir
cumstances described in my last
message, a new war broke out be
tween the republics of Nicaragua,
Honduras and Salvador. The efi'brt
to compose this new difficulty has
resulted in the acceptance of the
joint suggestion of the presidents of
Mexico and of the- United State for
a general peace conference between
all the countries of Central America.
On the 17th day of September last
a protocol was signed between the
representatives of the five Central
American countries accredited to
this government agreeing upon a
conference to be herd in the city ni
Washington "in ordr to devise the
means of preserving the good rela
tions among said republics and
bringing about permanent peace in
those countries." The protocol in
cludes the expression of a wish that
the presidents of the United States
and Mexico should appoint "repre
sentatives to lend their good and im
partial offices in a purely friendly
way toward the realisation of the
objects of the conference." The con
ference is now in . session and will
have our best wishes and, where it
is practicable, our friendly assist
ance.
INTERNATIONAL BUREAU OF
AMERICAN REPUBLICS.
One of the results at the Pan
American Conference at Rio Janeiro
in the summer of 1906 has been a
great increase in the activity and
usefulness of the International Bu
reau of American Republics. That
institution, which includes all the
American republics in its member
ship and brings all their represen
tatives together, is doing a really
valuable work in informing the peo
ple of the United States about the
other republics and in making the
United States known to them. Itf
action is now limited by appropria
tions determined when it was doing
a work on a much smaller scale and
rendering much less valuable service.
I recommend that the contribution
of this government to the expenses
of the bureau be made commensu
rate with its increased work.

QUESTION OF laAVT.
Is There Distinction Ilotwcen Hotel
Hoarder and Guet?
In the meaning of the law, is a
boarder In a hotel a guest, or l
there a distinction between them?
An interesting question Is raised in
the case of Holsteln vs. Phillips and
Sims, argued before the supreme
court during the past week.
This is an action brought by te
plaintiffs to recover for the loss of
jewel rv which disappeared from the
room "of the ferame-plaintiff In the
Imperial Hotel In HendersonvlUe,
during the summer pf 1905. It was
mutually agreed that the facts as
set out In the record should consti
tute the casv on appeal, after having
submitted them to Judge Gulon. who
decided adversely to the defendants.
From this Judgment the defendants
apjoaled to the supreme court.
The defendants Insist that there Is
a distinction In law between a
"guest" and a "boarder." and that
the femme-plalntlff was a boarder In
the place of a guest, having contract
ed for her board by the week and
paid board by the week.
"In this country." the defendants
contended, "hotel ktvpers act in a
double capacity. being both inn
keepers ami hoarding house keej
ers." They also hold that the keep
er of a summer resort is not an Inn
J keeper, and is fixed with no extra
ordinary liability as an Insurer of
t)ii fn n1 itf i.Mif hiil .nt lht most
is liable only as an ordinary bailee,
when negligence be proved. They
declare that In the preent cast there
was no evidence or negligence. I ne
last contention of the defendants Is
that an inn keeper Is not liable for
goods of a boarder stolen from the
Inn. except upon proof of gross neg
ligence, being liable as an ordinary
bailee where negligence is proven.
The plaintiffs contend that the de
fendants should be treated as In
surers and liable for all losses and
damage except those due to the acts
of God, and the public enemy, with
out proof of negligence. The plain
tiffs argue that the femme-plalntiff
was not a boarder but a guest, and
quote from authorities. News and
