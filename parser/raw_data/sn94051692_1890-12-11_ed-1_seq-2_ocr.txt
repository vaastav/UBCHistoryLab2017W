The United States Senate, by a
vote of 41 to 30, took up the Lodge
force bill for consideration on the
2d instant.
The two Senators from Wyoming,
Cary and Warren, were sworn in on
the 2d. Warren drew by lot the
short term.
Judge Kibbey recenti3r decided
that Ingalls had no authority to
draw the salary of J. H. Behan as
Superintendent of tho Territorial
prison,
Through the order of General
Miles, Buffalo Bill was prevented
from arresting Sitting Bull. It was
feared that his arrest would precip
itate hostilities.
Ose out of every 47 persons in
Indiana draws a pension, one in 65
in Ohio, and in Kansas one in 70.
The pension agents in these States
had a "fat take."
The Deming Headlight says that
Mormons from Utah are passing
through there by thousands bound
for Mexico, and that they are creat
ing a thrift' looking country down
there, where a desert was visible be
fore. The Prospector says : A car fixed
up especially for the use of the gov
ernment is now in Nex Mexico dis
tributing spawn of various kinds of
fish which are being distributed
through this part of the country.
Arizona will be supplied also.
Washington advices regarding
the threatened hostilities of the
Sioux are much less favorable. It
is reported that two thousand In
dians have reached Rose Bud and
have started for the Bad Lands.
Four thousand Indians are now
there, . and there is little hope of
quelling the uprising without blood-

An exchange says there is a prune
orchard of forty acres nt Grangcr
.ville, California, which bore this
year 2S,200 pounds of iruit, an ave
rage of 705 pounds to the tree. One
tree among the number produced
1,140 pounds. The fruit has sold
in that locality this season for 9
cents a pound.
A bill has been introduced in
Congress b' Representative Vande
vere of California, giving the pub
lic lands in the arid regions in the
west to the different states and ter
ritories, the proceeds of same to be
applied to the schools. The pas
sage o siich a bill would be of great
henefittoArizona.
The cattlemen met in Tucson the
other day, says the Nogales Herald,
and organized the Southwestern
Cattle Association, the largest or
ganization of the kind in theTerri
tor3r. It will take in the entire south
ern portion of the Territory and in
all probability the greater portion
of the central part. Among the ob
jects in view are securing the enact
ment by the legislature of better
cattle laws and also establishing a
trail to California for the purpose
of driving feeders to that market,
Ix speaking of the White Moun
tain Apaches, acting governor Mur
phy in his report uses the following
language, which, if acted on by the
Government would be of incalcula
ble benefit to Arizona : "Whether
these Indians are removed or not, I
nost earnestlyrecommend that they
be disarmed and prohibited, from
the possossion of rifled guns and
fixed ammunition, and that- it be
made a felony for any person who
shall be convicted of selling or fur
nishing to said Indians any such
arms or ammunition, under such
penalties and provisions as are now
in force in reference to selling liquor
to Indians."
The cattle claims department of
the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad
which has heretofore had its head
quarters in General Manager D. B.'
LRohinson's office at Albuquerque,
has been removed and will hereafter
be known as the claims division of
the law department, under the
charge of Judge W. C. Hazledine,
eceneral attorney of the road, and in
his absence will be looked after by
Karl A. Snyder. C. C. McKinney,
law clerk in Judge Hazledine's of
gce, will have charge of the books
in the office. Carl F. Hoi ton will
hold the position of traveling ad
juster of claims. All cattle claims
should hereafter be addressed to W.
C. Hazledine, general attorney of
the Atlantic and Pacific.
Five indictments for libel are
standing against Ed. S. Gill, who is
said to be editor of the Phoenix Re
publican. Four of them are for
libeling Ex-Governor Zulick, the
other for libeling Ex-Chief Justice
Wright. Believing Gill to be a tool
in the hands of other fellows, we
are sorry that they, too, are not in
it. Prescott Courier.
The Republican, at the time it
was publishing the scandalous arti
cles about the two gentlemen named
above, challenged them to com
menco action against the paper and
it would prove every charge made.
It appears now that it will have an
opportunity to do so, and the Her
ald predicts it will most signally
fail. It will, however, prove a val
uable, even if it bo a costly lesson
to Mr. Gill. It will teach him in
the future to be certain that those
furnishing him information derog
tory to others, whether as an offi
cial or a priyate citizen, are them
selves responsible, and that they
arc not imposing on a comparative
stranger for the gratification of
their own base designs.
The Durango (Col.) Herald says :
the excitement continues to grow
regarding ihe placers and other
mineral wealth in the Sierra Car
rizos. That there is immense wealth
in these mountains is positive. It
is equally certain that these moun
tains are on the Navajo reservation
at the northern end and on the un
used portion, but still on the reser
vation, ihe distance from Duran
go is, b' the wagon road to -Farm-ington,
fifty miles, and thence to
the Carrizo mountains, twenty-five
miles. The Rio Grande Southern
railway is now making a grade sur
vey straight toward the country.
It is now impossible to keep par
ties from going in. The whole Uni
te 1 States army could not protect
these mountains now that it is
known to a certainty that gold ex
ists. It will be the Black Hills over
again and as utter a failure on the
part of the government to main
tain titles where paying minerals
are found. Better much for the
general government to arrive at the
conclusion at once to treat with the
Indians. Probably it will require
the sacrifice of many lives and much
prnpgfly to do this. The gold is
there and the gold will be had in
spite of all obstacles.
J. P. Welles has just brought in
some promising specimens from
his mine on Mineral Bill, mostly
of decomposed quartz. He has
sunk a shaft to the depth of 40 feet
and has struck some good ore.
Some accompanying specimens
from the adjacent mine of Mr. Por
ter, principally silver sulphuret,
consist of high grade ore. The
gentlemen fully believe the locality
a rich mining district. Florence

W. R. Patterson esterday made
a shipment of eight cars, 15S head,
of beef steers purchased from E. R.
Monk. Tho average weight was
from975 to 1000 pounds, and were
considered a choice bunch of cattle.
Mr. Patterson again accompanied
the shipment but will soon return
for further purchases. Wilcox

I
Points in the ftlessagc.
A President's message, dry read
ing as it is commonly considered,
always contains a number of inter
esting points, and the present one
is no exception to the rule.
It is interesting to know, for in
stance, that Mr. Harrison is think
ing of making an attempt to secure
an international agreement for the
free coinage of silver. That is
something he has never thought of
before, and nothing but theimmi
nent pressure of an independent free
coinage bill would haye driven him
to it. His opposition to such
bill is plainly indicated in his pro
test against ''impulsive legislation
in the supposed interest of silver."
The President springs upon the
country the information that Min
ister Mizner's conduct in the Bar-
rundia case is disavowed, and that
the Minister has been recalled. Mr.
Mizner might reasonably have ask
ed that his disgrace should be con
summated in some less ostentatious
way.
It is a curious example of the
reckless haste with which the Mc-
Kinlejr bill was rushed through
Congress that the President is ob
liged to call the attention of the law
makers to the fact that they inad-
vertenly imposed duties upon
Hawaiian goods in violation of the
reciprocit' treat7, thus laying the
Uuited States open to a charge of
bad faith.
It will please Californians -to
learn that negotiations are on foot
with Mexico and Great Britain to
regulate the passage of Chinese
across our northern and southern
frontiers. If some way can be
found of stopping these leaks
there will be a possibility of
making exclusion effective.
We are informed that the Beh
ring sea difficult)7 has not yet been
settled and is not even in the way
of settlement, but 'it is sincerely
hoped" by the Administration that
something will be done about it be
fore the beginning of another seal
ing season. -We hone so too, since
if it is left open any longer there
will be no sealing question to set
tle; but as Jong as the Administra
tion leaves the poachers to do as
they please it is hard to see what
object England has in worrying
about it.
The present message is note
worth' as being the first indication
that the element in power at Wash
ington thinks it possible that pen
sion expenditures may be carried
too far. Mr. Harrison expresses
the opinion that the "liberal en
1 a r g e m e n t o f I h e p e n si o n 1 a w "a d o p t -
ed at the last session "should suggest
a more careful scrutiny of bills for
special relief, and also to the cases
to which relief is granted, and as
to the amount allowed." It may be
well to remind him of the fact that
his predeQGSsor used to give that
'careful scrutiny," to special pen
sion bills, ind .vetoed the unworthy
ones, for which he was scandalously
abused. Mr. Harrison has carefully
avoided any similar discomfort.
Examiner.
ga. g iq
The people of this Territory as
well as Arizona, can thank a Dem
ocratic President and administra
tion for removing the hostile
Apaches from their borders. For
years, before the Democrats went
into power these Indians were mas
sacreing people on every hand, yet
the Republicans paid no attention to
the demands of the citizens of these
Territories. When Cleveland was
elected president he not only heed
ed their demands, but ordered the
remoyal of the hostile Indians
from this section of the country.
Shortly after President Harrison's
inauguration he wanted to have the
Apaches brought back and turned
loose to continue their wholesale
butchery of human souls, and he
would have done so only for the
fact that the strongest kind of pro
tests were sent to him urging him
not to carry his wish into effect.
The Democratic party protects the
people while the Republican parly j
only protects the few and the rich

Trouble Among Whites.
The whites in control at San Car
los have had a quarrel which may
not be ended yet, and until further
developments are made the follow
ing from the Valley Bulletin will
prove interesting reading, as those
connected with the white outbreak
are so well known all over Arizona
where Apaches have set foot :
"The store of Indian trader E.
W. Kingsbury has been closed by
Agent Bullis :
Al. Seiber, the veteran scout, has
been discharged and is now in
Globe.
The cause of Kingsbury's trouble
and the dismissal of Seiber are
given as follows: Agent Bullis has
for some time known that whiskey
was being smuggled on the reserva
tion and had. spotted a negro sol
dier as the one who was receiving
it. He went to Kingsbury's store,
where the stage office is also kept,
and found a box addressed to the
negro suspicioned of the crooked
whisky work. He asked Mr. Kings
bury to hold the box until the ne
gro inquired for it, and then notify
him. The next day Mr. Kingsbury
was called to Bowie on business
connected with his mining interests
there. While he was away the ne
gro, who had evidently scented
trouble, called at the stage office
and asked that the box be sent on
to a man in Globe, which was done.
This action was construed by
Agent Bullis as a contrivance of
Kingsbury or rather his clerk, to
assist the negro to escape the dis
cipline and consequences of smug
gling whisky to the Indians. Just
what Seiber had to with the matter
was not stated by our informant,
but his dismissal was on account
of this transaction, so the natural
inference would be that the clerk
got permission from Seiber to for
ward the box to Globe. This how
ever, is only speed ative, and the
cause of Seiber's discharge may
have been something else.
Further, it is teamed that Lieut.
Watson, who has proven himself to
be the best officer ever stationed at
San Carlos, interfered in Seiber's
behalf and telegraphed to head
quarters, over the head of the com
manding officers at San Carlos ask
ing that Seiber be retained. For
this Watson was placed under ar
rest." Night before last, about 11
o'clock, as Councilman Coi.nell
wended his way home and was
about to pass the vacant lots north
of his place, an animal about the
size of a large bear stepped on the
sidewalk a short distance ahead of
him. Thinking it a trespassing
heifer, the councilman give a city
pound whoop, when the animal fled
up the sidewalk, which shook under
its weight, while, instead of the
hoof beats of the supposed heifer,
the unmistakable scraping clatter
of heavy claws could be distinctly
heard. Mr, Connell's two dogs,
oyer ready to vociferously bark at
any ordinary animal, fled in silence,
and could hardly be induced to
leave thier place of hiding. The
councilman is at a loss to know
what description of beast it was,
but thinks it might have been a
stray, bear that had lost his reckon
ing. Courier.

F. II. Merritt Killed.
Frederick H. Merritt, book keep
er for the New Mexico Cattle Breed
ing company, was killed near the
ranch of Messrs. Mcintosh Bros.,
in south Santa Fe county, on the
evening of December 2nd, by the
accidental discharge of a pistol.
His wife is prostrated by the shock
and fears are entertained of her re
covery. He leaves two children,
a girl and a boy, who are at school
in the east. Mr. Merritt was at the
San Felipe hotel Monday, jolly and
agreeable to everyone he met, ap
pearing to be more than usual, and
no doubt little dreaming that a vio
lent death for him was near at hand.
He left yesterday moring for home,
but before reaching the ranch he
was killed. His many friends ot
this city are pained to hear the trag
ic end of his life. His body was
brought to the city this afternoon
and now lies at Strong's undertak
ing room. Albuquerque Citizen.

Robt. Cannon of this city has in
his possession a few pounds of ma
terial, calcarenous in appearance
and rather friable which he intends
sending to San Francisco, to be
tested as to its properties as ingre
dient for mineral paint, which he
thinks may result in something
rich. It is brought from Pinal
county, where he reports to be a
bed or mine of 150 feet thick and
at least two miles square. Arizona's
resources are limitless, and it is
to be hoped this will materialize in
something remunerative. Tucson

Keller, who has a ranch below
the line, about three weeks ago sold
a band of 1,100 sheep to Cummings,
the butcher, and the Erie cattle
company. The former took 700 of
them and the latter 400, The cus
tom house authorities said they had
been inspected and duty paid, but
upon investigation it was proved
that only a portion of them had
been passed through satisfactorily
and the whole band was seized and
have been in charge of the United
States Marshal over since. He will
sell them as confiscated property
and somebody will have a chance
to buy them. Tombstone Prospec

much inconvenienced for want of
stock cars in which to ship their
cattle. They are urging the A.&.P.

business has increased to such an
extent within the past few months
that the company's motive power
is run to its utmost capacity, and
much freight is delayed to such an
extent as the inconvenience our

testation of the loftiness of his
prices are nnayailing, knowing as
he does that his heat producer is
the scarcest article in this city and
that he can name his price. The
high prices are due to the lack of

. General G. Andrade writes his
son Edward, who is well known in
Yuma. "The wild hemp you sent
me measured when received here 22
feet in length. I placed it in the
hands of the German, English and
American experts, and they all tell
me that it is the best fibre that has
ever fallen into their hands and
they confirm all that the Sentinel
has said concerning it for fabric,
paner, rope, cordage and matting.
That which you sent me is all gone,
get and send me the largest and
longest stalks you can find, I can
use it to advantage." Edward An
drade visited the Lerdo Colony last
week and on his return brought back
beautiful samples of the wild hemp,
corn and cotton, which he will send
to his father to shhw San Fr moist o
