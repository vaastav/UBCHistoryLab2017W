HOYAL BAKJNO POWDER CO.. NEW YORK- :
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.
Pome time ago Congressman Reeder
declared himself boldly and above
board that he is in favor of the Presi
dent's railroad policy. The Toneka
Capital hardiv "noticed it at all."
Now Congressman Curtis, after "wab
bling" around almost as bad as Sena
tor Lone, troes to Washington ' TV n
and rushes into an interview, and the
Capital" "stands up" and puts out
abont a half column of "Curtis' Pat
Stand." O, how fair and honorable(?)
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Roosevelt has departed
from his first policy of writing short
messages. The address laid before
Congress today is one of unusual
length, even as long messages go
But it must be remembered that con
ditions in this country are undergo
ing marked changes none the less rad
ical because they are gradual and
unattended by popular clamor. Few
Presidents in timesof peace have been
called upon tq give such consideration
toconstructive policies as Mr. Roose
velt. This fact is reeogmzed after a
moment's reflection on his extraordi
nary administration. It is more fully
borne home on reading today's mes
sage to congress, which is largely a
reiteration and elaboration of former
addresses to the national lawmakers.
The President is justified in giving
much attention to the subject Of cor
porations, more especially the regula
tion of transportation rates. He re
mains inflexible in his plan for em
powering a national commission to
adjust disputed rates and, fix the max
imum in a contested case. He favors
the legaization of pooling, but only
after the power of rate adjustment
has been vested in a commission. His
recommendations to regulate private
cir lines, terminal railroads and other
rebating devices are well known, and
he formally urges the opening of rail
way accounts to government inspec
tors as the best means : to determine
whether the laws are violated. The
President is against over-capitalization.
In fact he takes note of all the
flagrant evils or corporation .lire, but
without hostility to just license for
these institutions and to big shippers.
He proceeds on the lorty plane of the
Square Deal.
The President's foreign policy as
revealod in his treatment of The
Hague conference, the Monroe Doc
trine and the Santa Domingo case, is
an especially strong feature of this
message. It shows that the . country
has never' had a more earnest or a
mure consistent conservator or peace
than the man whose few enemies are
wont to call him a war "lord or, more
properly speaking, were wont to do
this. - .
No specific plan for insurance regu
lation is proposed, but Congress is
again urged to ascertain, its powers to
deal with the insurance business and
to act within those powersand accord
ing to its lights to protect the policy
Holders or the country. Apparently
the President does not think now is
the time to make a live issue of the
tariff possibly in the beliet that
what he regards sis of more immedi
ate importance iniglit be jeopardized
Dy. urging revision at. this time. He
asks the removal of the Phiilippines
tariff exzept on sugar and tobacco and
the reduction on these articles to 25
per cent or the Dirigley rates.'"
The whole realm or national condi
tions and needs" is covered,, not per
functorily, but with evidence of tre
mendous earnestness, much thought
and. sound' judgment. Kansas City

i Women certainly don't love their
husbands as they used to love them.
A few years ago a woman would spend
the whole morning '-doing- up"' his
tine shirt so lie, could go -meeting
Sunday, and the afternoon she would
spend darning his socks.' Now the
laundry 'does up" the fine shirt, and
the rag man igets the holey socks.
THE WETZEL MURDER.
From the Hill City RepnWIran.
The adjourned preliminary hearing
of Charles Keleher, charged -with be
ing implicated in the murder of Wet
zel on the afternoon of Wednesday,
November 15, just east of the city,
was called ,in. Judge .Poston's court
Wednesday morning at 10 o'clock. -.
Leland Roberts, wlio says that he
alone killed yimng Wetzel, and that
Keleher was present and ent part of
the murdered boy's roonev, was on
hand, having been brought t' the city
on the morning passenger train from
Hoxie by Sheri ff Ashcroft and depu
ties, where he had . been confined n
the Sheridan county jail ti.ice la t
Saturday night.
Couuty Attorney ITarwi called Rob
erts to l lie witness stand.'who went
into detail as to the killing of Charley
Wetzel, relating about the Fame etory
of the awful crime as was published
in the last issue of the Republican,
save and except that he yielded the
blows with the singletree tbat-endtd
the life of Charley Wetzel; that Ross
or Rose (colored) was in no way con
nected with the crime, he (Roberts)
claiming that his first confession as
told in the jail, at Salina was a story
made out of whole cloth to protect
himself.
. The defense put nine witnesses on
the stand to prove an alibi, showing
the whereabouts of Keleher betwee i
the hours of 1 and 4 o'clock p.m.-on
the day the murder was committed,
Roberts claiming the crime was com
mitted between the hours of 2 and 3
p. ni.
Considerable stress lias also been
thrown on the proposition why Rob
erts has made two confessions. Pray,"
which "one of- these confessions are
the people to believe?
The preliminary! hearing or Kele
her was held late into the night, when
Judge Poston bound him over to the
next term of the district court, which
convenes Tuesday next, December 5,
Roberts waived a hearing, and vester-
oay morning was taken on the up
freight to Hoxie, where he will be
kept .in jail until his case comes up
before Judge C. W. Smith.
.. It may be expected by the readers
ot" the Republican that a long .article
would appear in this issue, giving the
evidence of all the witnesses in full,
and as it is conceded by many that a
newspaper js, to a certain extent, a
moulder of public opinion, for such to
appear at this time we opine would
be unwise and not practical. ...The
evidence in this case will have . to
come out at the. December sitting of
the district court, and it would be un
wise on our part to publish the same",
for such might make competent men
incompetent jurors In the district
court, and to this end we withhold
anything from our columns.
The board of county commissioners
have secured the services of "ex-Chief
Justice Doster to assist County Attor
ney Harwi in the prosecution of Rob
erts and 'Keheler for the murder or
Charley Wetzel.
Edgar Watson Howe writing from
tire bosom or the Pacific ocean, says:
"Four days west of Honolulu w will
lose a day. Tyesday night we will go
to bed, as usual, and when we awake
at the usual time, it will be Thursday
morning; we will have dropped Wed
nesday entirely. Get the children in
the high school to explain this to you;
I can't. The captain . tried to get it
through my head to-night, but railed.
I can understand that we are losing
twenty to twenty-four minutes every
day, but since leaving home, we will
have lost less than six. hours, at a
point four days -west of Honolulu,
whereas we will drop twenty-four. It
is .because time isreconed from Green
wich, and not from Atchison? ir the
world's time, is ' reconed from Green
wich. It should be changed to Chicago
or Kansas City." Star.
