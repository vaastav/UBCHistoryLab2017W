message to Congress was sent to that

losw in part:
"The people of thi country continue
to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubt
edly there will be ebb and flow in such
pro-tperity, and thi ebb and flow will
lie felt more or less by all member of
the community, both by the deserving
and the undeserving. A general failure
of crops would hurt u all. Again, if
Ute folly of mati mar; the) general
well being, then those who are innocent
of the folly will have to pay part of
the penalty incurred by those who are
guilty of the folly. A panic brought
on by the speculative folly of part of
the business community dwould hurt
the whole t-nsines community.
Man of Capacity Becomes Rich.
"In our industrial and social system
the interest of all men are so closely
intertwined that in tSe immense ma
jority of case a straight dealing man
who by hi efficiency, by hi ingenuity
and industry, benefit hiimtelf must also
benefit other. Normally the man of
great productive capacity who becomes
rich by guiding the labor of other

and they share in the benefit, which

SENT FOR INVESTIGATION
Says the Only Way to Remedy the
Troubl in to Reaciad the Exclusion
Lawn, and Ho la Certain that This
Will not Be Done.
San Francisco, Dee. 5. Captain A.
C. Bnfcrr, of the cruiser Raleigh, who
has been detached for several month,
to study conditions in China, arrived
Unlay on the Manchuria, en route to
Washington, here he will lay the result
of hi investigation before the Presi
dent. Captain Baker say all talk of the
boycott dying out is nonsense. The situ
ation in China i controlled by 71
guilds, who have given orders not to
tfindle America good-. Yjrel4u
in Canton, be says, are full of American
flour. In the meantime Australian are
rushing in inferior flour, to take ad
vantage of our difficulty. Chinese mer
chant admit our flour is superior, but
are prepared to make the sacrifice for
principle.
Baker state the boy cot U just now
reaching the interior, and if it were de
clared off now, it would take a year for
the news to reach the province up the
river.
Captain Baker goe on to any that
not only Australian, but the Japanese
are taking advantage of the boycott.
The Japanese are establishing cotton
mills in China and cheap labor i in a
position to drive u out of the field.
He expect our vast kerosene and
steel business will be talen over by the
Japanese as well. The only thing would
bo to rescind the Chinese exclusion laws,
and thi, be say will not ge done.
Captain Baker conclude by saying the
boycott i getting worse every day.
