Questions of Vital Interest to the
WhoU People ';
- The following is the substance of
i&e annual message of. President
IZoosevelt to Congress, as read in both
bouses: - ;
Introductory.
To the Senate and House of Repres
entatives :
As a nation we still continue to en-
Joy a literally unprecedented prosper -
it?; and it is probable that only reck -
less speculation and disregard of ligi
tnnate busmess methods on the part
cf the business world can materially
mis prosperity.
No Congress in our time has done
good work of importance than
the present Congress. - There - were
reral matters left nnfinished .

to may not be in real conflict with
aeh other, but it is unfortunate that
there should even be an appearent
conflict. At present there is no way
ly which tbe Government can cause
such a conflict, when it occurs, to be
solved by an appeal to a higher court
and the wheels of justice are blocked
-without any real decision of the ques
tion. I can not too strongly urge
the passage of the bill in question.
-Setting Aside of Judgments and
nonrt. mnviVtJn t.;naj J. u
Granting of New Trials.
In connection with this matter, I
wuld like to call attention to the
yery unsatisfactory state of our crim
inal law, resulting in large part from
namt ot setting aside the ! judg
naents of inferior courts on technical
ities absolutely unconnected with the
merits of the case, and where there
m no attempt to show that there has
leen any failure of substantial ju.
xt wowa De wen to enact a law
providing something to the effect
uat:
No judgment shall be set aside bv
w iriai grantea in any case, civil
w; criminal, on tne ground of misdi'
eetion of the jury or the impropei
"amission or rejection r evidence, or
lor error as to any matter of plead-
as or proceaure unless, in the opin-
ifle court to which the appli
cation is made, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall aflSr
raatively appear that the errorcom
friained of has resulted in a miscar
riage of justice.
Injunctions.
- In. my last message I suggested the
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
liaving been sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
:gr altogether the use of injunctions
m such cases would stand the test of
the courts; in which case of course
the legislation would be ineffective.
Lynching.
;Jn connection with the delays of
the law, I call your attention and the
attention of the nation to the. prev
alence of crime among us, and above
all to the epidemic of lynching and
anob violence that springs up, now in
nse part of our country, now in an
other. Each section, North, South:
ana west, nas its own faults; no
Bwtion can with wisdom spend its
time jeering at the faults of another
section; it should be busy trying to
amend its own shortcomings. To
deal with the crime of corruption it
la necessary to have, an awakened
public conscience, and to suppliment
this by whatever legislation will' add
speed and certainty in the execution
ef the law. When we 'leal with
lynehing even more is neeesa-ary. A
sreat many .white -men ' are lynched.

existing cause of lynching is the per- ire ls as vital to the welfare of thG
petration, especially by black men, whole country as is the "welfare of
of the hideous crime of rape the the wageworkers are the tillers of the

of crimes, even worse than murder: to 'say that no. "growth lof cities, rfo
Mobs frequently avenge the eommis- growth of wealth, no industrial de

turing to death the man committing off in the character, and standing of

Of

corporations' and trades unions, there
is one matter more important to re
member than aught else, and that
of mere discontent. These are : men
who seek.to excite a violent class hat-
red against all men of wealth. ' , They
seek to turn wise -and proper move-'
ments for the better control of cor-
porations and for doing, away with
the" abuses connected with wealth, in-

Wageworkers of the United States are
of so high a grade that alike from
the merely industrial standpoint and
from the civw standpoint it should
be our object to do what we can iu
the direction of securing the genera!
observance of an eight hour day.
Employers ' Liability.
Among the excellent laws which the
Congress past at the last session was
an employers' liability law. It wa3
marked step in advance to get the
recognition of employers' liability on
tne statuts boots; but the law did not
go far enough. In spite of all precau
tions exercised by employers there are
unavoidable accidents and even
deaths envolved in nearlv everv line
of business connected ; with the me-
cnanic arts. This. is inevitable sacri
fice of life may be reduced to a mini
mum, but it can not be completely
eliminated.
Investigation , of Disputes . Between
' uaptial and Labor.
The commission appointed by the
r;resiaeni uctober 16, 1902, at the re
quest of both the anthricite coal on
erators and miners, to inquire into,
consider, and pass upon the questions
in controversary in connection with
the strike in the anthracite regions of
Pennsylvania and the .causes out of
wmcn tne controversary arose, in
,UC11 cpori, nnamgs, and award ex
prest the belief 'fthat the SUte and
Federal governments should provide
the machinery for what may be call
ed the compulsory-in vesigation of
controversies between emnlover n.l
employees when they arise."
.Corporations.
The present Coneresa has
long strides in the direction of secur
ing, proper supervision
by the National Government
corporations engaged in interstate
business and the enormous majority
of corporations of any size are engag-
cu iu interstate business. Tne pas
sage of the railway rate bill, and only
to a less degree the passage of the
pure food bill,' and "the provision for
increasing and rendering more effec
tive national control "over the beef-
packing industry, mark an important
adyace in the proper direction. In
the short session it' will nerharja be
difficult to do much further along this
line; and it may be best to wait until
the laws have been in operation for a
number-of months before endeavoring
to increase their scope, because only
operations will show with exactness
their merits and their shortcomings
and thus give opportunity to define
what further remidial degislation is
needed. Yet in my judgment it will
in the end be advisable in connection
with the packing house inspection law
to provide tor putting a date on th3
label and for the packers. All these
laws have already jutified their enactment.

matter of the eniciency of our army
and
gratified at the progress we are makj.
xiie : jrresiaent is mucn
iug iu ooin orancnes oi our common
defense. In the matter of rifle prao-
nve tne rresiuent says:
The Congress has most wisely pro
vided for a National Board for the
promotion of rifle practice. Excellent
results have already come from this
law, but it does not go far enough.
Our Regular Army is so small that in
any great war we should have to
trust mainly to volunteers; and in
such event these volunteers should
already know how to shoot; for if a
soldier has the fighting dge, - and
ability to take care of himself in the
open his efficiency on the line of bat
tle is almost directly proportionate
to excellence in markmanship. We
should establish shooting gallaries in
the IaSe public and military schools,
should maintain national target
ranges m different parts of the coun
try, and should in every way encour
age the formation of rifle clubs
inrougnout all parts of the land. The
little Republic -of Switzerland offers
us an excellent, example -in all matters
connected with-building, up an effic
ient citizen soldiery. '

has agreed to accept the new Caswell
