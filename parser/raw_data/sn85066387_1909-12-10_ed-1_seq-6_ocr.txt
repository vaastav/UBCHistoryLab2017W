General of Marine Hos
pital Service Lauds Eradica
tion of Plague
-Says Disease in West Indies and
Azores Still Menaces This
Country
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. — Attention to
\u25a0 plaguo conditions on the Pacific- coast
S is given by' the surgeon general of the
| public health and marine hospital serv
' Ice in his annual report made public
; today. Xo rases of human plague oc-
L-curred in San Francisco in 1909, he
; says, and there were only four cases
f of rat plague. The effect of the lnspec
i tions by the service In San Francisco,
i he continues, has been to place San
.' Francisco in a satisfactory sanitary
| condition.
| iI'AR OF EXTERMINATION'
The service has been engaged in a
j war of extermination on rats and
1 ground squirrels, and, while many
t rquirrels have been killed on the coast,
only in Contra Costa county, Cal., wa.^
« serious condition of infection found
among them.
In India, according to the report, the
plague has shown a noticeable decrease.
For the fiscal year 1909 there were
l«M03 cases, against 730,720 for the
previous fiscal year and more than
3.022,000 for the fiscal year 1907. The
I'nited States continues to be menaced
toy the plague in the West Indieß as
•well as in the Azores.
The Burgeon general discusses the
liook worm disease at some length and
says that "the failure of required legis
lation has prevented a campaign of
education In connection with the state
boards of health, which has been con
templated."
He says that while the eradication of
the disease within a state is primarily
The duty of its sanitary authorities the
federal government should co-operate.
' LESS YELLOW FEVER
The marked improvement In the yel
• low fever situation is attributed by the
t #urgeon general to the greater atten
tion being paid to sanitation.
It was demonstrated in the year, ac
cording to the report, that the foot
and mouth disease may be transmitted
to animals through vaccine virus.
310RSE SAYS JURORS
WERE DRUNK AT TRIAL
Convicted Banker Expects to
Secure New Hearing
NEW YORK. Dec. 9. — "If the grovern
' inent has a. good case it can prove it
\u25a0 again, bat if I am denied a new trial
there is no remedy for me against the
•wrongs and misconduct' of which I
think the special officers and jury were
cnilty."
This is what Charles W. Morse, con
victed banker, who faces a 15 year
term in the federal prison at Atlanta,
faid tonight. A motion for a new trial
has been set to be heard tomorrow in
the United States circuit court, but the
argument may be postponed.
••You ask me." added Morse, "what
misconduct of the jury I refer to.
Well. I refer to the fact that a ma-
I Jority of them, instead of keeping their
heads clear, and their blood cool, drank
: enough to prevent them from receiving
or understanding and clamly weighing
" the complicated facts of my case." •
"There is not a Judge in the United
States 'who would knowingly permit
paid agents of the prosecution to take
charge of the Jury and conduct them
selves as these men did. I shall await
the result end abide by it."

I Ui\iAul\ German Chancellor^
SEEKS TO GOVERN
AS A BUREAUCRAT
German Chancellor Makes Maid
en Speech inßeichstag De
fining His Policy
BERLIN, Dec. 9. — Dr. Bethmann-
Hollweg, the chancellor, delivered his
maiden speech in the relchstag today.
In simple language he set forth that
the government's policy was to stand
aloof from parties and groups of par
ties — in short, that the government
was not a government by party. \u2666
Governmental measures would be
submitted to the reichstag for adop
tion, said the chancellor, but he was
i not disposed to define the constella
tion of parties which he thought would
support the measures.
The recent political crisis over the
taxation bill had made no change in
German Institutions, the chancellor
continued. Radicallsts strove to divide
all Germany Into two political camps;
but the existence of such a dualism
was a fiction, devised for party objects.
It could not contribute to the sound
development of the country, for every
proposal to be classified as either radi
cal or reactionary.
Germany, the chancellor said, needed
continuous and steady policies, both
at home and abroad, to satisfy the
people, to the eitd that their work,
either material or Intellectual, might
be undisturbed by disorders or experi
ments. * ' . '
Dr. Bethmann-Hollweg gave an im
pression of strength. His 'view of a
government without permanent party
connections and his manner of ex
pression were those of a strict bureau
crat. \u25a0>
During the speech the clericals and
conservatives applauded* a*nd the radi
cals and socialists from time to time
uttered exclamations of dissent and
protest.
CHINESE REFORMER IS

pected that a line will be established
shortly.
News was brought from Port Arthur

China Protests Against Russian
Interference in Affairs of |
Manchuria
\ - \u25a0 .___ -\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0-• : A;-- ; ; - '
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 9.—The-de
tailed protest (of China against 'the
Russian memorandum sent to the pow
ers in, October ha 3/ been, received here,
in it China declares that the adminis
tration of affairs at Harbin V and other
points. in Manchuria does, notr concern
Russia. \u0084„••
The protest also contends - thatrttha
agreement: of 1596 between China" and
the Russian-Chinese bank, creating tha
Chinese Eastern : railway, as. well? as
the . Harbin '^agreement of £ last May,
yielded no administrative '» rights \~ to
Russia.. On the contrary, the contract
of 1896 entrusted the" defense of j the
railroad ; to China. .-.
It Is thought the protest may'fbe
preliminary to a ; demand by China; for
the withdrawal., of;< Russian^- railroad
guards In ' Manchuria. ALVKokovosoff,
Russian minister of finance,: has \ long
urged such a withdrawal, which would
save " the , government;; $50,000,000 an
nually; but the war and foreign offices
have objected. -
The protest . corresponds with the
text of the United States', answer to
the Russian memorandum early" in No
vember, which was delivered to, M.
Kroupoaky, counsellor of - the Russian
embassy at Washington, who, in : the
absence of Ambasador Rosen, was
charge d'affaires.
TAFT'S MESSAGE MEETS'
APPROVAL IN GERMANY
Utterances Regarding Nicaragua
Considered Rather Vague
BERLIN, Dec. S.— Official and jour
nalistic comment on President Taft's
message to congress notes "with ap
proval what he says regarding the
likelihood of trade wars between\the
United States and other countries as a
consequence of the maximum duties
clause of the new tariff law.
Taft's utterances respecting
ragua, .. though considered In ofllcial
quarters as rather vague, are taken to
mean that the United States will re
store order in the republic, which will
be an advantage to German trade.'
Commentators observe that the .mes
sage deals with foreign affairs to an
extent not-hitherto- done, in a presi
dent's message to congress.
