The correspondence from Randolph

Which statement we have found to be
true. Only a slight t-auvass has been
made, and we already have the names
i eight ciuzeus who are ready to
swear that they voted- for Walter S.
Payne for Secretary of State. Nolo.
ing could be dearer than that the men
whose duty it was to ina&eout tbe le
turns, and wno were sworn to do so
fully and truly, have taken upon them
elves the responsib.lity of leaving out
those - votes or tneir fellow citizens
which for some reason they did not
aee lit to honestly count, record and
report; and the consequence, is the
Prohibition vote of Pottage County
lor Secretary or State Is officially re
ported and recorded as being 264, when
it really is jmu.
This is a question in which evtry
good citizen sneuid have an t qual tu
terest. if men can tamper with I hi
returns of one party, they can with
those of another. It they will do this
in one case, tbey will in another, if so
disposed. In view or tbe certain fact
that the Prdhibiuou vote for Sheriff
is falsely reported, who can have any
assurance mat tne .Republican or uem
ocratio vote for Sheriff has been truly
recorded and reported ? The false re'
turns in tbe oue case create the as
sumption of false returns in the other.
The real question is not at an wnetn
cr the Prenibition vote shall be cor
rectly counted and recorded, but wheth
r every citizen of Portage County can
deposit his legal vote in tbe ballot box
and nave it nonestiy reported, it a
Prohibitionist can net do tnat, there
is no certainty that any other citizen
can. -
The question whether the Prohibl
lion vote shall be a few more or less,
may be one of slight importance, but
the question whether every legal voter
hall be allowed to vote any ticket he
pleases, and have that vote counted
and recorded, lies at tbe very founds
tion of all our rights as citizens. , If
that can not be done, law aud order is
at an end, and Anarchy is at work al
ready among us.
The election officer of Ranrlnlnh
bave either been guilty of a crime that
lays them liable to a fine of not less
than fiity dollars or imprisonment not
less than ten days in tbe county jail,
or both, or they have committed a
blunder that shows their utter unfit
rises for the position they have tried
to fill.
Tne supposition that it was an in
tentional fraud is strengthened by the
lac i tnat tne omciais made no correc
tion of the returns, even after being
notified of the error. And still u.or
toea it seem like a case demanding le
Sal investigation, when we remember
that this Is not the first time that Pro
hibition votes have been counted out
in Portage County.
But whether a fraud or a blunder, it
is a case which demands aud is likely
to get an investigation.

Portage Co. Prohibition Ex. Com,
Yesterday, Deo. 6tb, an officer from
Sent appeared to us with warrants for
tk. arrest of seven of our boys. We
were somewhat surprised. He didn't
wet them, but tbey appeared today
with their bondsmen to plead not guil
ty and waive examination. We don't
know what tbey were charged with,
but as far as we can learn the trouble
srew out of a republican Jollification
.held here some ten days after tbe late
lastion. They made a bonfire and
borrowed two anvils, one from each of
oar blacksmiths, and commenced to
boot. It looked like a quiet and tame
lfair, as the republicans of this place
ean make only a slim turnout without
democratic assistance, and they, the
latter, didn't feel jolly. Soon one of
the republican managers supplied the
boys with fish horns, and told them to
make all tbe noise they could. Boys
like noise, and soon, as far a the b
wera concerned, all party feeling was
set aside, and tbe musio was enchaut
Ing. After a while they were rein
lorcedfrom tbe direction of Mogadore,
M party of republican leaders, with ex
Senator Wolcott to make a speech, aod
a couple of ladies in tbe crowd. They
beaded for the Ball at the hotel, but it
was bard to get tbe boys in the street
quiet enough for tbe elite to hear the
Senator's eloquence. However, he
boldly commune d, and got so far as
to tell them that Buffleld was like
Texas, each went about two thirds
democratic. The boys in the street
were working as tbey were instructed:
J. ., making all tbe noise tbey could.
31 -re tbe Senator got ma ', aod said a
gentleman friend of mine, a Judge of
tne Supreme Court, who is well ac-
tainted in Texas, told me in conver
au,tir" ht, if he owned Texas and
were getting vary no'sy, the ladies
ioaide wera getting embarrassed, and
the Senator was getting mad- He said
that the reason there were ao many
democrats in SutHeld was because they
were brutally ignorant, they d'dn't
read any papers, and consequently
knew nothing. Of the two stores oue
be dubbed democratic headquarters.
be stores don't want to be partisan
and don't thank the Senator for draw -ing
the line. He alluded to your hun-
! correspondent in the mocking, sar
castic manner peculiar to him, and
boldly charged him with being at tbe j
bottom of all the mischief, when, in
reality he was at home in his own
room, reading the papers, ana neitner
knew nor cared wht-ther the Senator
was in Hell or Texas. The Senator
should not be so personal. I have also
I-arnea that in tne republican process
ion on their way home, had a sick
democratic rooster tn a very promi
nent position. He didu't look well, i
and someone, with a club or a stone,
my informant couldn't tell wnicn,
made a good shot at him and put him '
outof;his misery. Query. What is
the senator going to charge tne ooys
witnT Tuey were making an tne
noise they could, under the instruction
of tbe department, and helping along
tne jamboree to the best or tneir acu
ity, it would hardly be fair to pumsn
them for that And if they are charg
ed with killing the rooster, tbe boys
will otter by way or defense, tnat it
was an aot of humanity, and besides
tie poor" bird was in bad company.
What does Senator Woloott want with
a democratic rooster, anyway? But
tbe (Senator is a great lawyer ana a
Keurleman of great influence, and he
doubtless kuows how to fix 'em. True.
Senator, the voters of tiumeld are two
thirds democratic, but can the less
than one-third republicans, or any one
of them, charge their democratic
neighbors with being any way an
friendly or unfair to them or not usu g
courtesy with them, either in business)
or politics? Neither are they so igio
rant or benighted as you seem to think
iney are men wno mostly uave w
work for their living and are as iutel
igent as men of their class. Th.y
uave intelligence enough to believe
lth their whole heart, that the prln
iple of Jefferaonian Democracy is the
best form of popular government the
world ever saw, and more than one
half of tbe people ef ihiB great country
believe so too, regardless of Senator
Woloott, Hell or Texas. 8ir, if you
are tbe gentleman that your education
and profession would lead people to
believe you to be, you will come to
Nuffield and beg pardon from those
honest,, good citizans you so grossly in
sulted . - We have here four or five lit
tie republican .dudes who want to run
ihe whole business, who no doubt
kve you your instructions, borne of

Washtugtou Letter.
. Washington, Dec. 7. 1888,
Senator Blackburn, owing to the
wide advertisment of his recent mis
understanding with Judge Rucker,has
been the center of attraction to tbe vis
itors in the Senate gallery this week.
He positively refuses to talk about the
matter, but his friends regard it as
ended at least that is what they say
Senator Harris, by a motion to lay
the Senate tariff bilP on th9 table,
brought out the fact that the republt
can Senators will vote solidly iu favor
of that measure, notmithsiautiiug the
fact that several of tbem are kuowu to
be bitterly opposed to certain tactions
of the bill. Heveral explaua'i iiiH are
given for this action by partif who
profess to know. Oue is that H tn ison
has stated that he wants the bill passed
at this session, and tbat tuo-e r. publl
cans who are opposed to it are afraid
to vote against it. lest they then by
lose their thareof patronage under the
t-ew administration ; mother is, that
tbey know the bill will uot pass the
House and only vote tor it to krep up
the. appearance of harmony in tbe
republican ranks UDtil after Harrison
is
inaugurated, leaving tne quarrel
that is believed by many people to be
inevitable over tbe tat iff, until tbe next
session, when tbey will control both
House and Senate.
The President's message was an able
statement or- the position or the demo
cratic party on the tariff and other
matters cf importance ; the ideas ex
pressed there could not have been im
proved. Statements like the follow
ing from the message are ponderous
with statesmanlike wisdom : " He
mocks the people who proposes that
the government shall protect the rich.
and that tbey in turn will care for the
laboring poor. Any intermediary be
tween the people and their govern'
merit, or the least delegation of the
care and protection tbe Government
owes to the humblest citizen in the
land-, makes tbe boast of free institu
tions a glittering delusion and the pre
tended boon of American citizenship a
shameless imposition " ' .Extrava
gant appropriations of publio money
with ail their demoralizing conse
quences, should not be tolerated, either
as a means or relieving tne Treasury
of its present surplus, or as furnishing
pretext for resisting a proper reduction
in tariff rates." " It cannot be denied
that the selfish and private interests
which are so persistently heard when
efforts are made to deal in a just and
comprehensive manner with our tariff
aws, are related to, if they are not
largely responsible for, the sentiment
largely prevailing among tne people.
tbat the general Government $ the
fountain of individual and private aid;
that it may be expected to relieve with
paternal care the distress of citizens
and communities, and tbat from tbe
ullnees of its Treasury it should upon
tbe slightly possible pretext of pro
moting the general good, apply public
funds to tbe benent or localities ana
individuals. Nor can it be denied tbat
there is a stowing assumption tbat as
against the Government and in fav. r
of private claims and interests, tbe
nsualrules and limitations of business
principles and just dealings should be
waived. These ideas have been much
encouraged by legislative acquiescence
teener from contrasts maoe witn tne
government is too easily aocorded in
favor of the citizen, the failure to sue-
port claims against the UovemmeLt
By proof is often supplied with no bet- !
ter consideration than the wealth f
iuo uuvvruiuvut auu tuv uutkiivui
the claimant ; gratuities in the form of
pensions are granted upon no otbtr
real ground than the needy condition
of the applicant, or for reasons less
valid ; and large sums are expended
for publio buildings and other im
provements upon representations that
are scarcely claimed to be related to
publio needs and necessities."
Tbe House yesterday by unanimous
consent took up tbe direct tax bil
which caused the long deadlock last
spring. It is expected that it will be
passed, but nopes are expressed by its
opponents that Mr. Cleveland will
veto it.
Mr. Harrison's backbone Is likely to
suffer a aevere 'strain between now and
tbe fourth, of March The republican
leaders here have determined upon
having an extra session of the Fifty
first Congress called to meet late in
March or early in A pril. There is not
the slightest necessity of an extra ses- j
Sion'; the republicans acknowledge!
Ihat their Olily object in havioe it
oilled is to gain the six Senators and
as many Representatives as South Da
kota. Montana and Washington, wbtn
admitted as States, chall be entitled to.
They have decided that owing to their
very narrow margin in both Houses.
this action is necessary iu order to en
able tbe new States to organize and
send their Senators and Representa
tives in time for the beginning of tbe
regular December session It-remaii
for Mr. Harrison to decide if he will
allow his party leaders to compel him
to call a needless session for the sake

We glean the following from the report of the
proceedings of ihe N. W. C. T. U., at its session
held in New York, October last.
A most pleasant episode was the presentation
of two beautiful clocks one to Mrs. Mary A.
Woodbridge, Recording Secretary of the Union;
the other to Mrs. L. M N. Stevens, of Me. is
a slight recognition by the Convention of their
more than ten years work as Secretaries.
The presentation to Mrs. Woodbridge was
made by Miss Henrietta Moore, and that to
Mrs. Stevens by Mrs. Frances Barnes, both ad
mirably done, and the responses were equally
happy.
M'ss Moore accompanied the presentation
with the following words, expressive of the ap
preciation of the work which the gifted recipi
ent has accomplished by zealous and eloquent
labor and utterance :
Madam President, Si.trr, Brothers and Prienda.
At one time upon the throne of Russia sat
two brothers, Peter and Ivan. Every thing that
was brought before them was disposed of with
wonderful wisdom and judgment. There seem
ed to be the clear-headedness and mercy of the
Great One on the throne. AU suppliants were
listened to with that patience, and mercy, and
gentleness, that we generally take on after we
have lived some time in the world. And so
there seemed to be this maturity of thought and
this maturity of wisdom in all the judicial de
cisions and renderings. . And it was ever so, for
just behind the throne was the Princess Sophia
and she was really ON the throne. Her brain
was there, her wisdom, her knowledge and her
pity wei e there, and so was everything save her
person. She was simply personated in those
j boys.
Dear Sisters and Brothers: In the revolu
tions of the world, and in the revolving of the
people with it, woman can no more be kept be
hind the curtain, can no more be hidden. Jus
tice is beginning to draw aside the curtain of
separation, and we find woman with her feet
upon the first steg that reaches upward to con
troling power, and whoever shall wear the crown
in the coming time, will be that boy, or that
girl who is best God-endowed, because best
mother-made ; will be that boy or that girl whose
mother was a queen. And one of the women
who has been foremost for years and years in
the work of organiiing this Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, which is doing so much for
the making of this future royalty and this royal
future, is with us tonight. The highest honor
that I can pay her, the grandest that I can speak
of her, is to say that she is a woman of my own
State of Ohio. I wish I might say that she was
a citizen. We WILL say this one of these days.
She has kept pace with the times. I have just
Slid she has been one of the foremost, and she
has been one of our most faithful ones. She
a woman of many titles.for this Woman's Chri:
tian Temperance Union has called her to mai
places of trust, ' But I shall speak of her simp
by that name by which we best love to call hei
for she has the sweetest name ever given to wc -man.
Her name is Mary. She stands tonig t
wit.i her foot on this first step. She is here with
her two hands reaching upward, and she is here
with her brain as clear and strong as the brain
of any man, and we want that it should never
fail. We want this brain to continue to think,
and think quickly; and so we have concluded,
we of the W. C. T. U., to give her tonight this
clock, which I think is the prettiest dock I ever
saw; and it is in agreement with this organiza
tion to kei-p the best time of any clock in the
United States. So we give this to our Mary
(but I guess we will be polite, and call her Mrs.
Mary A. Woodbridge), (Applause) This is
the woman to whom I could make no more
honorable mention than by saying she is the
Queen among women of my own State of Ohio!
Mrs. Woodbridge responded as follows :
1 am surprised beyond expression, having no
thought, even when the word " Mary " was spo
ken, that it could be me, of whom the previous
words had been said.
I looked into the face of this woman, years
ago, as I stood before an audience in the city of
Cincinnati, and as her eyes were fixed upon me,
I felt the earnest, unspeakable reaching out of
her heart for the good of humanity, and when
that meeting closed, I extended my hand to her
and welcomed her as my sister, though I knew
not her name. . Whenwe went to the restaurant
near by. we sat down and talked of what we
each hoped mjght be the future. I saw in her
what you have heard tonight, and as I said, my
sister, God hath called you to a service of which
you have never dreamed, she put her hand in
mine, she reached out her heart to God, and
I she said to me, and to Him, " Here I am, do
unto me as. seemeth unto thee good." And
then the days came when we stood together as
officers of the W. C. T. U. of Ohio. Then,
teaching all the day long, she waited anxiously
for the night time to con.e that she might do
service for the cause she loved so well. A little
later, I heard ber at one of our State Conven
tions pay the sweetest tribute to the husband of
my love and home, to which I have ever listened;
and as she told of the flowers that day after day
as I sat in that home, were laid beside my plate
at tne table, that were plaeed at my breast, that
I might carry with me, step by step, evidence of
love and faith, as I was called to go through the
nation up and down, I said, God bless that wc
man for what she has done for tne, and my be
loved. I have watched her as she has gone on,
standing upon the one step, but going higher
and higher, step by step, until she has come
sear the top of the ladder. I have seen her
sometimes when the flesh has grown less, and
weariness has come into her face, and I have
prayed, O, God, spare Henrietta Moore. He
has spared her, and has given her victory on
earth, and it is assured her in the kingdom be
yond. And tonight she has stood here, and
spoken the words to which we have listened-
Sisters; why have you given unto me this gift,
which will be tome verily a time-keeper, as day
by day, I strive to do service for you, for hu
manity, and for "God? Not alone do I bring you
thanksgiving, but reach out to each of you. and
ask my Infinite Father, your Father and your
God, to bring unto you for this thought, for the
many thoughts which you have worked out into
such deeds as these; a blessing such as He
alone can give. Then, dear sisters, I ask that
in His spirit we may work on, until we reach
that future which we today see with eye of faith
when regulation of the liquor traffic shall be a
tiiiig of the past, for Prohibition will have been
obtained: and with united hearts we will sing
praise, and thanksgiving, and honor, and glory,
untoHim who has delivered us from thts iniquity
forever and forever.
Thanks unto you. my sisters, and (turning to
Miss Moore) thanks to you, my beloved.
General Clinton Fisk being upon the platform,
and recognising that neither lady had in her
presentation mentioned tbe fact that these Sec
retaries had patiently worked on from year to
year, widyaut a penny of remuneration, came
forward and" made the statement, and said.
' When the women of the Organization began
. to realize this, they sought in some measure to
express their regret and their appreciation of
sttch faithful, sacrificing service, and could find
no gift so appropriate as a cloek, ever holding
its hands before its face."
The clock is of onyx, and l model of artistic
design and finish, fully meriting the reference
made to its beauty by Miss Willard. in her felic
itous presentation, and is one of the most perfect
in every detail of completion, we have ever had
pleasure of examining.

CHILDHOOD'S HOME.
Home, our home, t at ijlorioi t word,
Kromshore to shore tne sound is heard
1 1 passes o'l r the m ghty dei p
From land to land it teems tu sweep ;
Hear the voice in the running brook.
And on the laughing waters look ;
We see the bubbling waters flow
To reach the larger streams below.
We saw the brook in childhood's view.
And wondered where the waters grew;
We watched it running down the stream.
Our happy hoarts wnh joy would beam.
Those footsteps in our dreams we hear.
Of our loved ones that were so dear;
We received their fond caressing.
With their arms around us pressing. .
A true home has pure affection, "":' ?
For childhood's first recollection ' . . j
Is of those youthful, happy ways, , . ,
Where passed -so many pleasant days.'
Happy home, where there's joy and mirth, J
Language fails to describe its worth ; '
Love vibrates from the mind to heart,
And plays an influential part.
As the mower cuts down the grass.
We hear the music as we pass, " " '-.
And while the reaper cuts the grain, . ' -
We hear the whispered glad refrain.
We see the cattle on the hill.
As they are grazing by the rill ;
We see tl e garden, house and barn.
As we look on the good old farm.
Or o'er the glittering snow white track,
Pleasure and fi-.n we did not lack,
As we were riding in our sleighs,
In that way passed some winter days f
The pleasure was not for a few.
As o'er the road we quickly flew; r
In those sleigh rides we took delight.
The world to us was fair and bright.
We love home, like an angel song.
The word is heard passing along ;
Brightly it glows, as setting sun, - '
And with our lives it seems to run, "
It glitters like a shield of gold. " -
As on our hearts it has a hold.
Home, sweet home, how sweet is the sound.
Where the richest melody is found.
There is a home with Christ above, -Where
joy will fill our hearts with love ;
That blessed home, Go.i has given ... -.
To the righteous there in heaven.
When our time on sarth is ended.
And our joy with theirs is blended,
We will sing with the loved ones there.
In that heavenly home so fair.

the railroad wharf, with the Washing
ton Express on board, fire was discov
ered on the uppei deck of the boat.
The burning timbers, falling on the
roof of the oars Bet them on fire, and
the passengers were aroused. There
were two sleeping coaches, with about
60 passengers. An engine stood ready
to pull the cars off the boat, and the
passengers escaped with their lives,
though scantily clad. Col. A. L. Con
ger, of Akron, was among the passen
gers. The fountain of perpetual youth waa
one of the dreams ofantiquity.lt has
been well-nigh realised in Ayer'a Bar
sapsrilla, which purifies the blood,
aud thus restores 'the age much of the
vigor and freshness of youth.'
