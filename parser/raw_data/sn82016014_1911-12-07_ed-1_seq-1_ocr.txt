On lwo subjects included under
"foreign relations" the president
spoke only in brief fashion. He in
formed congress of the conferences be

question of passports in Russia for
American Jews, and explained that
after the Christmas holidays he ex
pected to send a special message on

their ratification.

Washington, Dec. 7. Oscar Under
wood of Alabama, majority leader of
Washington, Dee. 7. The general
business of the country, as reflected
in banking operations, was "quite sat
isfactory" during the year ending Oc
tober 31, last, according to the an
nual report of Lawrence O. Murray,
comptroller of the currency, submit
ted to congress today. Mr. Murray
records a steady growth in the vol
ume of business and the establish
ment of some high records in this
connection. He points out, however,
that while augmenting some of the
important elements of banking during
the year, business did not reach the
average of increase for the last ten
years.
The comptroller makes the startling
declaration that "the dishonest prac
tice by officers of national banks of
receiving personal compensation for
loans made by the bank is a growing
evil and has already reached such
proportions as to call for criminal
legislation on the subject."
"In this manner," he adds, "either
the bank is defrauded of lawful in
terest which it would otherwise re
ceive or usurious interest is exacted
of a borrower by a corrupt officer.
A secret reward to the officers is
sometimes a deliberate bribe for ob
taining a loan on insufficient se
curity." Mr. Murray urges that the taking
of money or other valuables in this
connection by a hank officer be made
an offense punishable by imprison
ment in the penitentiary.
Assets Increased.
The aggregate amount of assets of
the national banks increased during
the year approximately $553,258,000,

president recommended to congress
the following legislation:

for the fulfillment of obligations as
sumed by the Cnited States in connec
tion with the settlement of the fur

to forbid the carriage of opium and
other "habit-forming drugs" in inter

would keep all such organizations In

Governor Stubbs dares to issue a call

Chamber of Commerce.
Outlining the idea of a central
"chamber of commerce," Mr. Taft
nuggested such an organization might
be managed by a committee composed
of a small number of those now ac
tively engaged in carrying on the
work of some of the large associations
of this kind with members ex-officio
fiom the state and commerce and la
bor departments. In leading up to
this suggestion, Mr. Taft showed that
in the fiscal year ending June 30. 1911.
the value of American exports In
creased $300,000,000 over the previous
year, but Indicated that further in
crease was possible.
The president's explanation of the
sudd'en dispatch of one-quarter of the
army to the Mexican border agreed
with the unofficial reasons for that
troop movement given last spring, but
he showed In a confidential letter to
General Leonard Wood, chief of staff
of the armv, that there was no doubt
In his mind as to what he would do
if he had found American lives and

"It seems my duty as commander-in-chief."
said the president, in this let

The statement was made at the close

NOT ENOUGH TROOPS
The Army Is Short 37.352 Men, Says
Genera Weaver.
Washington. Dec. 7. With a splendid
and enormously expensive system of
coast d"t'ense fortifications almost com
pleted there are not enough soldiers by
37.352 to provide for even one manning
etail. according to General E. M. Weav
er, chief of the coast artillery, in his an
nual report.
General Weaver declares that unless
the necessary trained troops are provided
for this purpose the vast expenditures
for coast defense alreaUy made will be
worse than wasted, since ther people will
have been lulled into a false sense of se
curity. Therefore he wants to Increase
the regular artillery by 75 officers and
14.584 men and the coast artillery militia
by 902 officers and 21.2tM men.

evidence not directly connected with
the death of Colonel Thomas H. Swope,
for whose alleged murder Dr. B.
Clarke Hyde is now on trial here for a
second time. Is causing the defense no
little worry. When the case was re
manded for new trial by the supreme
court. Dr. Hyde's attorneys felt that
only evidence relating to the alleged
murder of the philanthropist had been
left for the state to build its case on.
But the prosecution is not content
with this evidence alone. It is fight
ing hard to get before the jury prac
tically all of the testimony given in
the former trial.
Twice within as many days the
state has been victorious. Witnesses
have been permitted to tell how Dr.
Hyde gave Stella Swope a capsule for
her sister Sarah. The inference which
the state seeks to leave Is that this
was a poison capsule, although there
is no direct proof of this.
Miss Klizabeth Gordon, a nurse, to
day resumed her story about how Dr.
Hyde injected what the state asserts
was pus Into the arm of Margaret
Swope under the guise of camphora
ted oil. The defense objected to all of
this testimony.
The victories of the state have
caused Dr. Hyde to take a more ac
tive part in the conduct of his case
than he has heretofore. He consults
frequently with his attorneys and
prompts them constantly when nurses
or medical experts are on the stand.
All of this collateral evidence has

The route to the camp was lined

a number of high military and civil
officials.
After a series of presentations their
majesties proceeded to a pavilion
within a wall of the fort where 150
ruling chiefs were Introduced. This
ceremony occupied considerable time.
Meanwhile the provincial legislator
had gathered on the ridge by the Dur
bar camp to greet the royal party.
The PrcH-csslon.
Then began the great procession to
the camp four miles away. Through
out India holiday had had been de
creed and great numbers of native
had gathered to get a glimpse of
their emperor and empress. They
formed a striking background to the
gorgeously uniformed procession
which was headed by lancers with
bands playing. Then came General
Peyton, the herald In silk and gold
tabard emblazoned with the royal coat
of arms and sixteen British and na
tive trumpeters all mounted on black
chargers. Next followed the native
escort of the viceroy. In scarlet and
gold preceding the imperial cadet
corps, composed entirely of nrlnees
and their sons. Their majesties and
the viceroy's suites succeeded.
As their majesties approached, tha

spectators took off their hats and the
natives bent deep towards the crowds.

All along the route the Impression
seemed to be profound and the recep

the camp the troops defiled past the
Imperial carriage, receptions followed
and the king-emperor was presented
with a brief address of welcome to
which he replied in a few words.
Their majesties and the vice regal
party then repaired to their camp, of
