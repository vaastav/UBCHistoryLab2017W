There la no rout in Bucharest, despite
the spelling of it.
The prospective arrival of state ofll
rials and state offices in Montpelier por
tend the, biennial trek to the place
which should be tho capital in fact ag
well as in name.
It is to be noted that Pussia isn't send
ing any more troops to the western Eu
rope war front. Reason: Russia needs
all her available men for her own war
operations on half a dozen fronts. Rus
sia is really carrying a, tremendous load
at the present time.
" Comes a follows Falls nmn with the
statement that J. G. Ullery of Brattle
boro had no more than a "Chinaman's
chance" of becoming national bank ex
aminer to succeed the late J. H. Kellehcr
of Montpelier. As events tinned out,
L'llery seems to have had several Chinese
companions.
One of the joys of the new Congress Is
the resumption of the Congressional Rec
ord, a daily chronicle of things which
happen and do not happen in the halls of
Congress. Much of the printed word nev
er was a spoken word, at least by the
congressman who is supposed to get cred
it for it in the pages of the Record. The
publication could stand a whole lot of
blue penciling and become a readable
journal of proceedings.
The Vermont supreme court should
give a very interesting interpretation of
the phrase "in operation" as relating to
nn automobile, when it renders opinion
on the case to be taken from Barre mu
nicipal court. Locally, there has been
more or less ' difference of opinion for
several years regarding the correct inter
pretation of the two words, some persons
claiming that a car, though standing be
side the curb in the highway, is not "in
operation" unless the engine is running,
following up the claim with the declara
tion that the vehicle need not, therefore,
be lighted at night as it stands by trie
curb. Hence, the opinion expected from
the supreme court will be received with
interest.
President Wilson's message to Con
gress on Tuesday was of the sort that
tries to even up with the other side.
Having been influential in securing the
passage of the Adanmon eight-hour law
at the recent long session of Congress.
Wilson now comes back with proposals
for legislation which is opposed to the
wishes of a part of labor organizations
and which is favored by the great major
ity of the business interests of the coun
try. At the same time he took a stand
in favor of the business interests by de
claring that it was not necessary for
Congress to pass an act giving expressed
authority to the interstate commerce
commission to grant increased rates on
railroads, thereby giving his tacit sanc
tion to the proposal. Wilson undoubted
ly is trying to even up, as between labor
and capital.
One of the handiest manuals of Ver
mont administrative activities published
in a long timers a little booklet pre
pared by John XT. Avery, the state's leg
islative librarian, covering in brief form
the various state boards, officials, com
missions and institutions and also giv
ing the summaries of the reports made
by the aforementioned agents. The in
formation relates to the important facts
In connection with the state's administra
tive machinery and it is so concisely stat
ed that one can turn to the book and in
stantly gain what is desired. For in
stance, the salaries of the state's officers
ran be learned at a glance, and at the
same time the duties which they are sup
posed to perform. Taken all in all, the
manual arranged by Mr. Avery will prove
of very great value to the members of
the legislature assembling at Montpelier
next month. Moreover, the publication
of it could not have been very expensive.
It must be a shock to Great Britain to
be informed that the entente allies are
not winning tho war. The British have
been comforting themselves for two years
with the thought that eventually the en
tente forces would be so vastly superior
and the armament at least as good as the
enemy's so that there would be nothing
to it but to sweep up the remnants of
the central powers. That opinion has
been heartily subscribed to by all per
sons who have returned to the I'nited
Mates from the countries of the entente
allies, the reports being especially rose
ate in the belief that there really was no
question as to the ultimate winner how
ever much Germany and her allies may
have been winning victories at the time
of the report. Therefore, it come? as a
dreary enlightenment to have those same
Briti-hers admit, or part of them at
least, that little or no real progress is
being made toward the great con-summation
so gloriously promised.
STIRRING IT RUSSIAN" DISCONTENT
The Herman estimate of the losses sus
tained by the entente allies are calculat
ed to impress upon Kuia and France
that the former has uMained seven
times as great lof as the British and
the latter three times as many as the
British. AH of which is intends! to stir
tip discontent in Russia and France be
cause of the belief that Great Hritain
was not doing her part in carrying on
the war. A casual consideration of the
war does not seem to fasten the con
viction that Russia has lost 8,500,000
men, the figures which the German esti
mate gives, although. It l quite possible
that 3,700,000 French have been put out
of the war either permanently or m
porarily. At, the same time the German
estimate of a British casualty list of
1,200,000 in the two years and four
months seems somewhat too low, while
Italy's 800,0(10 loss is also too high. It
must be borne in mind in the considera
tion of the figures that they were com
piled by an organization in a nation
which is fighting against the other coun
tries mentioned and with particular ani
mus against Great Hritain. Truth and
accuracy would undoubtedly demand an
important revision of the estimates.
AMBASSADOR GERARD.
Ambassador Gerard is now on hin re
turn trip to his post as ambassador from
the United States to Germany. He has
spent several weeks in getting in touch
with American ideas and particularly
with the ideas of the government oflicials
in Washington. Therefore, he goes back
to carry on the very important work
which is to devolve upon official repre
sentative of the largest neutral nation of
the world to the largest belligerent on
the side of the central powers. While
sojourning in the United States, Gerard
kept his own counsel so far as the gen
eral public was concerned; he said little
or nothing that could be construed as
bearing on the relations of Germany and
the United States and, indeed, practical
ly nothing on tho progress of the war,
although he has been in a position to
study the conditions in Germany thor
oughly. For his silence, on those matters
Gerard is to be commended. He haB not
jeopardised his own position a a possible
intermediary when the nations come to a
desire for peace nor has he jeopardized
the position of his own nation ag one of
the possible arbitrators. In that respect
Gerard has shown himself eminently fit
ted for the responsible work he is called
upon to do.
SUSPICIONS OF RUSSIA.
There are various indications of un
easiness among the western members of
the present entente alliance over the re
ported peace overtures made by Germany
to Russia, the important eastern ally of
the entente. The latest indication is the
expression of relief in Paris newspapers
over the statement made by Premier
Trepoff of Russia to the effect that the
alliance, of which Russia is a part, has
promised the czar the gateway of the
Dardanelles as soon as the war is com
pleted. From time to time published re
ports in France and Great Britain have
endeavored to show that Russia waa ir
revocably bound to the entente and that
any efforts of the kaiser to break those
bonds would prove of no avail. Under it
all, however, there seemed to be an under-current
of suspicion that perhaps,
after all, there might be something to
the stories of secret negotiations between
Germany and Russia. Hence the use of
the i jeney of publicity to thwart those
negotiations if possible. There can be
no doubt that the revelation to the peo
ple of Russia of the secret pact and prom
ise between the entente alliance and Rus
sia as to the spoils of war was the out
come of a desire to hold the people of
Russia to the policy of continuance of the
war and, perhaps, to Are their enthusiasm
to fresh efforts and to greater sacrifice.
Inasmuch as the promise to Russia was
made more than a year ago, it would
seem that the present announcement by
Premier Trepoff is very belated indeed if
it were intended merely as the dissemina
tion of news.
Along the Smooth Road.
This country is moving alone a strange
road and without signs of hesitation or
concern. Thus far nobody has foamed at
the mouth because the allies nave re
f,.t,i u'hat the 1'nitfM States had a
right to demand a safe conduct for the
Austrian ambassador.
When this country was young and
raw. such a refusal would have been fol
lowed by an ultimatum, coupled with the
plain announcement tliat it it was neces
sary safe conduct would be provided by
an American man-of-war. We do such
things better now, and the doing does
not interfere with the stock market and
Liu business. We cite historical pre
cedents, pro 'and con, we express hope
that the allies will see the error of their
way, and we are at least told that as
"a concession to a friendly neutral," the
allien MV irrant what, only a few years
ago, this country would not have per
mitted to be classed as a concession.
We have no doubt that the Austrian
ambassador will receive his safe conduct,
anA we have no doubt that it will be
charged again-t our account by the al-
ies as one more striking testimonial oi
their esteem for us! Neither have we
any doubt that it will be accepted in the
same spirit by many patriotic ,raen-
an citizens! Boston 'traveler.

Helpful Luncheons.
The series of luncheons inaugurated
by the Rutland Business Men's associa
tion promises some excellent results be
for the winter is over. Apart from the
value of the get-together spirit engen
dered by breaking bread together, ad
dresses "by men like President Thomas
of Middlebury college and Dr. Hillegas,
state commissioner of education, have
a deep educational and informative mer
it. Busy business men are notoriously
poor students of public problems. The
exacting nature of their vocations, the
urgent demands of shop and office, such
social duties as they have time for and
their desire to devote some small amount
of time to their homes and families con
spire to take up the time of business
and professional mcti to a degree little
realized by those whose time is less cir
cumscribed. To such men, the clear and straight
forward exposition of school progress and
school problems, given yesterday by Dr.
Hillegas. gives them in an hour's talk a
better idea of what the educational con
dition really is than weeks of such cas
ual reading as most men find time for.
Incidentally, it was something of a
revelation to learn how well some fea
tures of Vermont's school system are re
garded outside the stW and in general,
it was highly gratifying to know that
the taxpayers of Vermont are getting
something worth while for their biennial
expenditures of about f2 .000,000 for the
schools and colleges, nearlr one million
of which must be raised by taxation.
These noonday luncheons hoiiid ne

professional man in the city, but by ev
ery taxpayer who desires to know the

BALANCE THIS YEAR,
BUT DEFICIT NEXT
Secretary McAdoo Figures the Nation'i
Finances National Defense Esti
mate Are Causes for Expec
tation of Deficit.
Washington, J). C, IVc. ,-Secretary
McAdoo'a annual report of the govern
ment's finances, presented to Congress
to-day, estimates that the fiscal year
ending .lime 30, 1017, will show a bal
ance of $113,000,000 in the general fund,
but that the figure a year later Juno
30, 1H1N. will how a deficit in the gen
eral fund of $183,000,000.
Preliminary estimates place the cost of
conducting the government for the com
ing fiscal year 101H, exclusive of the post
al service, which ia expected to be self
sustaining, and other deductions, at $1,
278,021,000. The ordinary receipt for
the fiscal vear 1018 he estimates at
$093,350,000! which is $282,471,000 less
than the estimated expense.
Estimates of large expenditures for
national defense carry the estimated
outlay beyond the estimated income.
For the" fiscal year 101(1 now drawing
to a close, the secretary reports great
prosperity and expresses greatest confi
dence for the future. "During the past
year." the secretary says, "the prosperity
which set in so strongly during the fiscal
year 1015 has grow n in strength and
volume, and is now widely diffused
throughout the United States. Funda
mental economic conditions have never
been more sound. In all ines of indus
try, efficiency of organization and pro
duction have" reached the highest point
in the country's history. General cofl
denee in the future, healthful enterprise
and development have been marked char
acteristic of the year.
"The financial strength of the United
States the greatest in our history
gives us a commanding position in world
finance. We have been transformed from
a debtor into a creditor nation. On No
vember 1, 1910, the stock of gold coin
and bullion in the I'nited States was
estimated at $2,700,130,970. an increase
I of $714,507,804 in the past lti months,
j This is the largest stock of gold eu r
j held in the United States or in any
j other country of the world. Through the
! operations of the federal reserve system
and with our abundant supply 01 goiu a
a basis, the credit resources of the Unit
ed States have become more than surfi
cient for home demand, and we have
been able to finance our great domestic
I and foreign trade -without strain and to
j extend vast amounts of credit to other
nations throughout the world,
j "The cxpei ienco of the past two years
j has brought into strong relief the value
jof the federal reserve system. It is not
too much to say that our great prospcr-
ity could not exist without it. The use
fulness of the system has been broad
I ened recently by the amendatory act of
' Sept. 7, 101 , which renders it more at
tractive to member banks and increases
;the scow and services of the federal re
; serve banks. Due to the transference of
vault and other reserves to federal re
'serve banks, authorized by th! original
iax-t and amendatory act, the resources of
Isaid banks are now more than $30,000,
:000, while the total reserves held are over
I 41)0,000.000. and, in addition, more than
$23t),000,000 is held by federal reserve
(agents as special security against federal
reserve notes. About one-Iourtli 01 trie
country's stock of gold is thus mobilized
in the hands of the federal reserve banks
and agents.
"The increasing strength and efficien
cy of the federal reserve banks have en
abled tliom to enlarge their direct service
to the business community through the
introduction of a definite and compre
hensive system for the par clearance of
checks throughout the country.
"Rates of discount at federal reserve
banks have continued low throughout
the year, and most of their open-market
paper, consisting largely of acceptances
growing out of foreign trade, has been
taken below a 2 '.'a per cent, basis. Rates
of interest throughout the country have
been reduced and stabilized, with great
advantage to the business of the coun
try. "It would have been impossible to
finance our vast domestic and foreign
trade without the facilities provided by
the federal reserve system. Not only
has it met the normal'and extraordinary
needs of business, but it has established
confidence securely. Business has ben
able to go forward without apprehension
and the several crises which the country
has faced in its international relations
during the past two years have been
accompanied by no flisturbances and
have caused not even a tremor in the
financial world. The crops of 1913 and
1916 were financed without difficulty and
to the great advantage of the farmers,
and the industrial troubles, which at one
time seemed imminent, because of the
threatened railway strike last summer,
were not accompanied by the slightest
financial uneasiness.
"Happily the country has been at peace
i-.nd business and enterprise have had the
largest opportunity for favorrble devel
opment under the most auspicious con
ditions. "If we make intelligent use of our
great power and exceptional financial re
sources, we can cop successfully with
any conditions the future may develop."
"One of the features of the report is a
discussion of present methods of con
structing public buildings.
"I am convinced," says the secretary,
"that the methods pursued by the Con
gress for the past 13 years of providing
federal buildings through so-called omni-bus-public-bnilding
bills have resulted in
the construction of many public build
ings in small towns and localities where
thev are not needed, and at a cpst which
is clearly unjustified by any actual re
ouirements of the communities in which
thev are erected. Th" conclusion is irre
sistible that authorizations for public
buildings in these small communities are
too frequently dictated by local reasons
and without regard to tli best interests
of the goernment. The most serious
aspect is this: The annual operation
and maintenance of these buildings im
pose on the treasury a permanent and
constantly increasing burden.
"Common sense and business judgment
would seem to demand that structures
for the transaction of government busi
ness should be authorized only in locali
ties where they are imperatively needed,
and that buildings should not be er.-cteil
where no public necessity can be shown.
This result can 1 aeco.-nplished by di
vorcing the public-building question from
all local or political considerations and
authorizing so public buildings until a
thorough and intelligent investigation of
ach proed building or project ha
bo-n made to this department ar.d a full
report thereon ha been submitted to
Congress. If such reports were followed,
