ANNUAL BILLS.
We will, in a few days, be sending out
our annual bills, ami earnestly request im
mediate attention to them by the receivers.
Those who may not be ready on the receipt
of them to remit the amount, will confer a
favor by addressing us a note stating the
shortest time which must elapse before they
are prepared to honor the same. But an
immediate reply, enclosing the amount,
will, in all cases, be the most acceptable
return. The bills are generally small, and
the instances will be exceedingly rare that
the parties will not bo able to meet them if
they desire to do so earnestly.
JURIES.
Twenty-live men from a selection of 000
of the most intelligent and competent citi
zens of the county are drawn to serve as
jurors, whose duly it is made by the law,
to hear and determine, without favor or par
tiality, all cases brought before them. But
it would be matter of astonishment to a
stranger, unacquainted with “ways that
are dark and tricks that are vain,” known
to the present generation of lawyers, in
looking over the list in the annual county
statement, to find the number of “tales
men ” accredited there. For the trial of
all important cases, judging from the cus- j
tom, there is scarcely a man to be found on j
the regular panel who is lit to sit in a jury
box. Now mark you, it is the duty of the
circuit judges and clerk in the presence of
the members of the bar, first to select COO
of the must intelligent, honest and discreet ;
men from the assessment books and poll (
lists of the county, from whom to draw 48 j
names, to constitute grand and petit juries
for each term of court. Now in the perform
ance of this grave and important duty, the ,
ends of justice and the public interest are j
willfully ignored, or the bar is allowed a
privilege which stultifies the former act of j
the judge, and greatly increases the county
expenses. But all who are familiar with j
the proceedings of our courts, know that
the juries are as a general thing, judiciously
selected, and represent a fair average of the
intelligence and ability of the best popula
tion of the county. Twenty-five of these
men are selected as petit jurors, ostensibly
for the purpose of hearing and deciding
according to the law and evidence cases in
litigation. It is reasonable to suppose that
any cases brought before court for adjudi
cation, for the trial of which it is custom
ary for juries to be impannelled, that twelve |
out of these 25 select men could be readily
chosen, who would hear and adjudge the
case legally and justly, as it were possible j
for such a tribunal to do, barring any j
amount of sorting and challenging. It has
been noticed, we doubt not, by every one
who has attended the county court, even
though such visits to the seat or temple of
justice may have been but occasional, that
the tallies brought up to take the place of
the regular panel, are often composed of
very objectional material, and that the very
best of these “ tallies ” are never an ini
provement in any particular, on the regu
larly summoned jurors.
It is dear to every one, however, without
the necessity of further analysis, that the
custom of going outside of the regular pan
nel to find Jurors, when the members of
the panel are unemployed, has grown into
a grave abuse, the object of which is not to
insure justice; but, if possible, to defeat
the ends of justice.
The practice pursued in almost every
grave criminal case, in selecting juries, is
an insult to the integrity and intelligence
of the panel summoned to hear and deter
mine causes for the session.
The counsel for the defense, by long cus
tom, has been allowed to abuse a privilege
which originally grew out of a mistaken
charity toward the criminal. The very
best men on the jury are “challenged,”
because they are sufficiently intelligent and
conscientious to form a correct judgment
from the law and the facts in the case, and
because it is feared that the attorneys for
the defense would be unable to confuse and
lead them astray; and the merest ninnies
are frequently selected as tallies, whom no
judge or sheriff would ever think of select
ing to make up the jury for the term.
Now it is a fact so notorious that none ever i
think of denying it, that the object, in
ninety-nine times out of every hundred, in
much challenging jurors, is to defeat the
ends of justice. Unless a judge was a
relative of the party whose case was before ,
court, or had been his counsel formerly in
the case, who would ever think of chal
lenging him on the score of untituess, be
cause he had perhaps read a newspaper
account of the case, or heard from eye wit
nesses at the time of the occurrence, the
incidents of the case? And it is equally
absurd to challenge a respectable juror,
such a man as has been selected in the legal
manner to try such causes as may be brought
into court, for a less weighty motive; and
this outrage upon justice and insult to
intelligence and competency should be
abolished, and all jury cases bo tried be
fore the regularly constituted panncl. The
ends of justice would be much better sub
served if such a reform were effected and
the costs of our courts would be greatly
lessened. The expense which is entailed
on the county at every term of court, by
the custom of calling in outsiders to try
cases, while the regular jurors arc stand
ing round idle, is very heavy.
As the land pays the largest share of
taxes to defray court expenses outside large
cities, such abuses, as we have been point
ing out, will never be reformed until the
laud holders, the farmers, by association
and cultivation, become fitted for legisla
tors, and make themselves familiar with
abuses which rob them annually in taxes
to the amount of thousands. At present,
through want of proper organization and
their deuse ignorance of public matters,
they are as helpless as children. They arc
making some progress toward a reform in
this direction and we trust the day is not
very distant when they will be able to dic
tate reforms that will result in substantial
benefit in furthering the ends of justice,
and curtailing the public expenses.
Light Wanted.— The following para
graph appears among the minutes of the
School Board published in to day’s Whig:
“ The Treasurer reported that in accord
ance with the order of the School Board,
passed at the last meeting, he had mado a
demand upon the County Commissioners
for the sum of $10,4:19.97, the amount of
arrears due on the various levies made fer
tile support of the public schools, since
1808 u|fto Ist of December, 1874, and also
interest on these deficiencies previous to
18(13, amounting to $1,554.62.”
This is a very remarkable demand on the
part of the School Board. A claim of
$12,004.59, made by them on the County
Commissioners for money levied for public
school purposes, and withheld by the Coun
ty Commissioners. This claim, it will be
noticed, dates back to ’6B, about the time
the party in power got possession of the
county government, and control of its
treasury, in order to meet this alleged de
ficit retained in the hands of the County
Commissioners, the School Board has been
compelled to borrow money at a rate of
interest ranging from 9 to 12 per cent. —
Messrs. County Commissioners, it is in
order to rise and explain what you have
done witlr this missing twelve thousand
dollars.

THK CAUSE OF EDUCATION.
The honored Board who has the educa
tion of the rising generation in charge,
w re in session on Tuesday last, and among
their proceedings will he found a resolution
j censuring the “ Model Teacher.” Forget
ful, it would seem, of the first principles of
her profession, to learn to obey superiors,
she failed to answer the summons of the
j Board to appear before it as a witness in
some important matter, which resulted in
this black mark. This is the second reso
lution of censure which has been passed
upon the Model, and a third wo understand
is ominous, resulting in nothing less than
dismissal. This vote of censure may have
been a little harsh or hasty as we have been
creditably informed that the teacher under
ban had a severe attack of mental rheuma
tism, which had it been known to the
Board, would have gone far toward extenu
ating. or mitigating Hie sentence. Or the
name of her academic groret may have
inspired her with a thirst to enjoy that
liberty which is so dear to every female
heart; and tempted her to brave the dis
pleasure of that awful tribunal, which
holds the destinies in its hand, of so many
piiests and priestesses who minister in the
temple of wisdom. But be this as it may
we feel like venturing a word of advice to
our Model Teacher, which is to beware of
that third resolution, and let other teachers
light their own battles. W’c feel our edi
torial cars being boxed smartly for intrud
ing such a piece of advice, hut we have the
| welfare of our Medcl Teacher so deeply at
heart, that wc cauuot help such au indis
cretion.
The Fourth “deestrict,” and that far
farmed “Jackson School” had another
case before the Board on Tuesday, which
provoked the use of some strong English
between the rival parties. The fair bone
of contention, we believe, was a teachercss.
There is generally a woman iu the fence at
those school rows. Nothing else is so pot
ent to set men by the ears. The Fourth is
proverbially a fighting “ deestrict,” and is
loth to give up its honored by time, election
day custom, which clings to it, despite the
softening influences of education.
TROUBLE IN TIIE RING.
That carnivorous animal the Elkton Ring,
having picked pretty much all the meat oil'
the carcass of poor Cecil county, bids fair to
have a regular wolf low over the hare hones.
Having had unrestrained freedom to par
take of the fat and choice pieces, through
a series of years, the Ring, like Jeshurum
waxed fat and kicked, so that no Board of
County Commissioners dared to stand be
fore it. And it came to pass that the pres
ent Board came from remote parts, and were
frugal men, and not acquainted with the
Ring and the luxuries of the chief city of
the county, and they sought to restrain the
Ring from greedily devouring the substance
of the people; so they cut down their ac
counts and pared off’ the excrescences from
their fee bills, and brought the Ring down
to “short commons,” and sought, by all
means, to institute the practice of economy
in the exp< uditure of the people's money;
and they rapidly grew into disfavor with
the Ring, and the Ring did blaspheme and
use profane language, and declared that
these guardians of the people's treasure
had been fed on asses’ milk.
And it came to pass on the fourth day of
the week, he, who is I’resideut of the Board
of Commissioners, and surnamed Doctor,
was accused of pronouncing some of the
accounts “irregular,” to which charge he
plead guilty without exceptions, and was
smote on the cheek by the offended party
with a stave; when he, who is called Presi
dent of the Board and surnamed Doctor,
girded up his loins and strove against the
enemy. And when the battle waxed hot
and the enemy was unable to withstand
the ouslought, one gentile appeared, who
dealeth in gold from Opher, and precious
stones from the isles of the sea, and trink
ets and rubies brought by merchants from
the far countries of the East, and poured
oil on the troubled waters and stilled them,
and peace was restored.
But thtre is a cry of peace when there is
no peace, for if the Ring’s sustenance is cut
off by these men who were nourished on
asses’ milk, it must surely die; for the pangs
of hunger have made it desperate, and a
writ of “ man dam us” lias been sued out
and sent for the men who would worse than
damn the Ring, even starve it, to appear
before Ciusar and show cause why they
seek thus to despoil the Ring of its accus
tomed sustenance, that it may be griped by
famine, so the people’s taxes may be re
duced: and when Ciesar has heard the com
plaint of the Ring and adjudged the case,
wo will send out a herald through all the
laud to apprise the people of the decree of
Ciesar.
Elected for the Seventeenth Term.
John W. Garrett was unanimously elected
President of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road by its Board of Directors on Wednes
day for a seveutceth term. Ho positively
declined an increase of his salary, and it
was fixed at the old rate of $4,000. Mr.
Garrett’s management of that great road
has been an example of success, honesty
and business capacity which it would have
been well for other roads in the country to
have copied, lie has steadily avoided un
wise ventures and speculations, and kept
the expenses of the road always within con
trol of its earnings, so that when the crash
came the Baltimore and Ohio Road found
itself not only in possession of most valua
ble franchises, but untrammelled by debt
that it could not control without sapping its
vitals, as so many other roads find themselves
at present circumstanced. The interest ami
improvement of Baltimore, the great city
at the road’s terminus, has been steadily
advanced, and although weak politicians
have kept up a constant light against Presi
dent Garrett’s efforts to open up and in
crease the needful facilities of his road, no
charge of extortion or injustice has ever
been sustained, that have so frequently
been made, at the instance of jealous par
ties, against the President and corpora
tion. When a great national combination
of railroad companies was sought to he
formed that looked to a giant monopoly,
powerful for evil, more than for public
good, Mr. Garrett utterly refused to be
come a party to the enterprise, for which
the country owe him a debt of gratitude.
The refusal of President Garrett to have
his salary increased is a noble contrast to
the prevailing epidemic of the times, for
increasing Hie pay of officials, iu about the
same ratio that the scale of ability and
honesty descends.
Selection of a Site for the House
ok Correction. —The Governor, Hoard of
Public Works and the Attorney General,
have selected a property of 93 acres, at
$138.06 per aero, on the Washington Branch
of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in Anne
Arundel county, sixteen miles from Balti
more. The railroad company have agreed
to run a switch into the heart of the build
ing where all stores can be unloaded, sav
ing carting and second handling, and the
fare and freight has been put 20 per cent
below the lowest rates. Several other
advantages are gained by the selection of
this site, which will save a considerable
sum annually in expenses incident to such
establishments. Governor Groome could
not prevail on the committee to visit Cecil,
as they had determined from the outset to
locate the building near Baltimore City.

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The message of the I’resident was re
ceived by Congress at noon on Monday
last, and is pronounced without division
of opinion, a strong, sensible document,
couched in plain, direct language.
Beginning with brief mention of the
prostration in business and industry which
has been felt so severely during the past
year, the I’resident calls attention to the
fact that this depression has occurred when
the country is in the full enjoyment of
three groat elements of prosperity, viz: an
abundance of capital to be had at moderate
rates of interest on good security; labor in
abundance at reasonable rates of wages,
and agricultural resources so far beyond
our own wauts as to yield a largo surplus
for other less favored people. The message
then, in a plain, but strong way, proceeds
to trace the causes of this incongruous
condition of affairs, coupling it with the
habits of speculation, luxury and extrava
gance in all expenditures, individual and
national, which have involved us in heavy
foreign indebtedness; and thou connecting
this with a system of currency which it is
impossible to keep on a par witli the recog
nized currency of the world, and referring
to the constant fluctuations in the coin
value of this currency, and the disturbance
and uncertainty which those fluctuations
cause in all business, and the losses which
such fluctuations in values bring to the
working people and salaried people, who,
according to the view taken in the message,
suffer the greater part of the burden caused
by the existing prostration—the President
finally arrives at the conclusion that, if we
would make an advance towards certainty
and steadiness in values, and towards util
izing our idle capital and unemployed labor,
we must take immediate steps towards
returning to a specie basis.
On the subject of finance we give the
words of the message:
Gold and silver are now the recognized
mediums of exchange the civilized world
over, and to this wo should return with the
least practicable delay. In view of the
pledges of the American Congress when
our present legal tender system was adopt
ed, there should bo no delay—certainly no
unnecessary delay—in fixing by legislation
a method by which we will return to specie.
To the accomplishment of this end 1 invite
your special attention. I believe firmly
there can be no prosperous and permanent
revival of business and industries until a
policy is adopted with legislation to carry
it out, lookiug to a return to a specie basis.
It is easy to conceive that the debt and
speculative classes may think it of value to
them to make so-called money abundant
until they can throw a portion of their
burdens on others. But even these I believe
would he disappointed in the result if a
course should bo pursued which will keep
in doubt the value of the legal tender
medium of exchauge. A revival of pro
ductive industry is needed by all classes,
by none more than holders of property of
whatever sort with debts to liquidate for
realization upon its sale. But admitting
that these two classes of citizens are to be
benelittcd by expansion, would it be honest
to give it? Would not the genera! loss be
too great to justify such relief? Would it
not be just as honest and prudent to
authorize each debtor to issue his own legal
lenders to the extent of his liabilities?
Than to do this, would it not he safer, for
fear of over issues by unscrupulous credi
tors, to say that all debt obligations are
obliterated in the United States, and now
wo commence anew, eacli possessing all he
has at the time free from incumbrance?
These positions are too absurd to be enter
tained for a moment by thinking or honest
people. Yet every delay in preparation for
final resumption partakes of this dishonesty j
and is only less in the hope that a conveni
ent time will at least arrive for the good
work of redeeming our pledges to com
mence. It will never come, in my opinion,
except by positive action by Congress or
by national disasters, which will destroy
for a time at least the credit of individuals
and the Slate at large. A sound currency
might be reached by total bankruptcy and
discredit of integrity of the nation and of
individuals. I believe it is the duty of
Congress at this session to devise such leg
islation as will renew confidence, revive
industries, start us on a career of prosperity
to last for many years, and to save the
credit of the nation and of the people.
Steps towards the return to specie basis are
great requisites to the devoutly to besought
for end. There are others which I may
touch upon hereafter. A nation dealing
in a currency below that of specie iu value
labors under two great disadvantages:—
First. Having no use for the world's ac
knowledged mediums of exchange, gold
and silver, these are driven out of the
country because there is no demand for
their use. Second. The medium of ex
change in use being of a nucleating value,
for after all it is only worth just what it
will purchase of gold and silver metals,
having an intrinsic value just iu proportion
to the honest labor it takes to produce
them, a larger margin must be allowed for |
profit by the manufacturer and producer. I
It is months from the date of production I
to the date of realization. Interest upon
capital must be charged and risk of lluctu- j
ation in the value of that which is to be j
received in payment added. Hence high
prices, acting as a protection to the foreign
producer, who receives nothing in exchange
for the products of Iris skill and labor, ex
ccpt a currency, good at a stable value the
world over. It seems to me that nothing
is clearer than that the greater part of the
burden of existing prostration, for the want
of a sound financial system, falls upon the
working man, who must, after all, produce
the wealth, and the salaried man who super
intends and conducts business. The bur
den falls upon them in two ways—by the
deprivation of employment and by the
increased purchasing power of their sala
ries. It is the duty of Congress to devise
the method of correcting the evils w hich j
are acknowledged to exist, and not mine.
But I will venture to suggest two or three
things which seem to me as absolutely
necessarry to a return to specie payments.
The first great requisite is a return to pros
perity. The legal tender clause to the iaw
authorizing the issue of currency by the
National Government should he repealed,
to take clVect as to all contracts entered
into after a day fixed in the repealing act,
not to apply, however, to payment of sala
ries by Government or for other expendi
tures now provided by law to be paid in
currency iu the interval pending between
repeal and final resumption. Provision
should be made by which the Secretary of
tiie Treasury can obtain gold, as it may
become necessary from time to time from
the dale when specie redemption com
mences. To this might and should be
added a revenue sufficiently in excess of
expenses to insure an accumulation of gold
iu the treasury to sustain redemption. 1
commend this subject to your careful con
sideration, believing that a favorable solu
tion is attainable, and that, if reached by
this Congress, the present and future gen
erations will ever gratefully remember it
as their deliverer from a thraldom of evil
and disgrace. With resumption, free bank
ing may be authorized with safety, giving
full protection to bill holders, which they
have under existing laws. Indeed, I would
regard free banking as essential. It would
give proper elasticity to the currency. As
more currency should he required for the
transaction of legitimate business, new
banks would he started, and, in turn, banks
would wind up their business when it was
found that there was a superabundance of
currency. The experience and judgment
of the people can best decide just how
much currency is required for the transac
tion of the business of the country. It is
unsafe to leave the settlement of this ques
tion to Congress, the Secretary of the
Treasury, or the Executive. Congress ;
should make the regulation under which j
banks may exist, hut should not make
hanking a monopoly by limiting the amount
of redeemable paper currency that shall be
authorized. Such importance do I attach
to the subject, and so earnestly do I com
mend it to your attention, that I give it
prominence by introducing it at the begin
ning of this message.
The message then takes up the political
situation in Cue Southern States; and in
relation to Lousiana, the President says if
Congress takes no action he must continue
to support the present government of that
State, believing that the present State
officials received the majority of votes at
the election in 1872.
Referring to the dispute in Arkansas,
the President recites the causes which led
to the rival claims for the Governorship
there, and says that as Congress is now
investigating the political atlairs of that
State lie has declined to interfere. Pre
j reeding this there is a reference to the
White Leagues aiul hands of masked and
armed men with their military drills and
j menacing demonstrations and outrages,
which spread terror among those of the
opposite political party, and intimidate the
colored voters. Further on in the message
it is intimated that the reports of these
outrages may have been understated by
one side, and may be overstated or exager
ated by the other, and that it may be worth
while for Congress to inquire and ascertain
by means of a committee “whether the
alleged wrongs to colored citizens for politi
; cal purposes are real, or the reports thereof
of manufactured fur the occasion.” The
President closes tins part of his message
with the following just and truthful re
mark:
Many a good citizen votes the opposite
not because he agrees with the great princi
ples ot State which separate parties, but
because generally he is opposed to negro
rule. This is a most delusive cry. Treat
the negro as a citizen and a voter, as he is
and must remain, and soon parties will be
divided, not on the color line, but on princi
ple. Then we shall have no complaint of
sectional interference.
The policy adopted for the management
lof Indian affairs, known as the Peace
Policy, lias been adhered to with most
beneficial results. It is confidently hoped
that a few years will relieve our frontiers
from danger of Indian depredations.
On the Cuban question the message is
very plain and suggestive though brief. It
says:
The deplorable strife in Cuba continues
without any marked change in the relative
advantages of the contending forces. The
insurrection continues, but Spain has gain
ed no superiority. Six years of strife give
the insurrection a significance which cannot
be denied. Its duration and tlie tenacity
of its advance, together with the absence
of manifested power of suppression on the
part of Spain, cannot be controverted, and
may make some positive steps on the part
of other powers a matter of self necessity.
In our domestic concerns, the President
invites the attention of Congress to the
legislation necessary to settle our laws con
cerning expatriation, nationality, the status
of children of American parents born in
foreign countries, and of American women
who have married aliens, &c., and also to
the legislation necessary to put a stop to
the procurement of fraudulent naturaliza
tion papers. Apropos to the revival of
shipbuilding, and particularly of iron ship
building, it is suggested that encourage
ment be given in the way of ample com
pensation to steamers for carrying the
mails. In the matter of civil service re
form, the President says the cfleet has
been beneficial, but that it is impracticable
to enforce the rules without the positive
support of Congress, and, unless he gets
this support in the form of law, he will
have to abandon the competitive examina
tions.

Nov. 29, 1574. Agent and Manager.
—Vieksburg, Miss., has been the scene
of another of these Southern State rebel
lions, which so much resemble the Mexican
and South American conflicts. The report
is that a body of armed negroes marched
upon the city on Monday morning for the
purpose of reinstating the colored Sheiilf
who had been removed on account of not
giving bonds. A fight ensued in which 25
or 30 negroes are reported to have been
killed, and only two or three whites killed
and wounded. If the telegraph operator
was a colored man it is probable the ac
count would he colored as highly on the
otherside. The colored Sheriff after hav
ing been arrested resigned, and quiet was
again restored. There was more lighting
near Vicksburg on Tuesday night, a party
of 40 whites being engaged with 200 blacks
at Snyder’s Blulf, about ten miles from
that city. Reinforcements were sent from
Vicksburg, and the blacks were driven
hark with a loss of four killed and three
wounded. The same day the blacks fired
into a funeral procession and wounded a
white man, when the fire being returned,
three of the attacking parly were killed.
On Wednesday the excitement in Vicks
burg subsided, there being no further “ ad
vance,” and there was a general resump
tion of business, although armed negroes
were reported to he gathering at various
points some distance from the town. A
strict guard, by armed whites, was still
maintained. At a meeting of the Board
of supervisors, the resignation of Sheriff
Crosby was presented by General Packer,
and aepepted. An election for another
sheriff will he ordered soon.
While a farmer named Klein was driv
ing through the mountain notch, two miles
from Scranton, Pa., on Monday night, six
highwaymen sprang from the roadside,
seized the horses, pulled him from the
wagon, kicked and beat him, then shot him
through the heart and escaped into the
woods with his watch and money.
—The third and last session of forty
third Congress assembled on Monday and
the Message of the President was received
and read; and business started off very
quietly. On Tuesday hills were offered in
both Houses of Congress to repeal the in
creased salary of the President.
