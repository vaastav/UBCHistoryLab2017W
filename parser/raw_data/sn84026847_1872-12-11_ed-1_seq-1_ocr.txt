>ew Yoac, December 10.? Mr.
Greeley'? will is to be contested. The
last will leaves all to the elder daughfcr,
making the younger literally dependent
upon her sister. That was not Mr.
Greeley's will. But a few days before
his death he convened long and anx
iously with a very dear friend in Brook
lyn, about his estate and his daughters.
The elder is a Catholic, the youuge9t
a Protestant and neither is married
If the elder were to have heirs, her sis
ter could claim nothing, and if the
younger were to die with' heirs they
could claim nothing. The venerable
relatives who assisted Mr. Greeley and
whose matters were left in his name
would be unprovided for, and the faith
ful sisters to whom he was much at
tached would get nothing. Tne elder
daughter says she would do evervtiing
for her sister, and the younger "acq ii

Greeley, know what his de,ire was

$174,000, specie, $464. The Direc'ors
last evening appointed a committee to
obtain a bank to act as its clearing
house agent in place of the Chatham
National Bank. The number of ap
plicants for money at the bank to day
have been much less than vesrerday.
Up to 10 o'clock about $15,000 had
been paid out. The bank is converting
its assets to meet this unexpected de

from any source. The officers believe
that the excitement in regard to the

The Weather.
The thermometer early this morning
registered twenty degrees of frost, and
men could be seen running in all di
rections in a rain endeavor to keep
warm. Tue street cars wer* little better
than ice houses, and the passengers in
them shivered as they tat in their
?eats. The, surface of tbe streets
was as smooth as glass, and well nigh
as slippery in some places. Manv
horses fell on the principal thorough
fares, and pedestrians themselves ex
perienced at limes no small difficulty
in keeping their feet, owing to the
treacherous patches ol ice with which
Ike roads aod gidewalks alike were
covered. The wind baa been blowing
a gale all day and increased in violence
toward evening. The cold weather baa
suspended travel oa the Hudson to all
points near the head of navigation. The

There are several hundred poor
Italians now almost starving in this
city, the dupes of emigrant agents in
Italy. A meeting of Italian citizens
has been called in this city for Sunday
next, to take some action on the sub

evil. These emigrants are brought here
through the false representations of a
swindling emigration association and
the I'a'ian Government, only too glad
to get rid of these men, is winking at
j the frauds thus perpetrated upon them.
Several influential Italian residents vis

A Shnrulng Nnidcr

fifteen minutes a noise was hear! in the
room, and a few seconds afterwards the
man came running down stairs. He did
not appear excited. He said to the
housekeeper, "I have just shot and
killed mv n;ece. and I am going to give

The woman went up stairs and found
Maud lying in her room, near the door,
with her fAce to the floor. Shewasshot

Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, asked to bar#
the Committee on Finaoce discharged
from the consideration of petitions to
prohibit the importation, sale and man
ufacture of spirituous liquors. He said
it was a question of morals and not of
finance, and moved to refer it to the
Committee oo Judiciarv. ?
Mr. Conkling, of New York, said
that the question referred to importa
tions, and. therefore, pertained to tbe
Finance Committee.
Mr. Eimunds, of Vermont, took t'te
same view, and said that as to the
manufacture and sale of liquors in the
States, the States themaelves could
only legislate on the subject as to the
importation of liquors that affected tljf
revenue, and, of course, was not a
proper subject for the Finance Com
mittee. The greater portion of the
revenue of the Government was derived
from the importation of liquors and
the internal tnx on it, and if this wis
given up the Government could not le
carried on.
The Senate refused to discharge toe

Mr Hawley, of Illinois, opposed that
feature of the hill allowi g an assign
rnentof the certificate by the reoipient
when one year has expired, benefiting
speculators onlv, ard antagonistic to
the homestead law, which experience
has shown to be wise and beniticent.
Mr Houghton, of California, defended
the bill, as it was the poliey used
toward the soldiers of former wars and
it should be continued toward* the
soldiers of the rebellion. He urged tha*
the soldiers who conld not go the public
lands should be placed on an equality
with those who can, by being allowed
the right of assigning his certificate
Without disposing of the bill, the
Ilotipe went into Committee of the

Mr Sargent alvocnted the continu
ance of the present Indian policy. One
great reason was, it would prevent the
great expense of a general Indian war
He produced statistics of the condition
of civilized Indians in New York and
elsewhere to show that thev were sus

the present policy was securing a purer
