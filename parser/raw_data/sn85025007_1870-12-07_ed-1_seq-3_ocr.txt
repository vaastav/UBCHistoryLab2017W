Suit.?Ia tho U. S. Supreme Court, yesterday,
Downham et al. vs. The City of Alexan
dria. In this case the oity of Alexandria imposed
a tax ot $200 on all agents, &c., "in ale
and beer by the cask, not manufactured in the
oity,but brought there lor sale." The ts.x was
resis-ted on the ground that it was uuc institutional,
iu that it was a tux ou onuitneice, and
discriminated in lavor ot local manufacturers.
The oourt below sustained the tax, and the
case was brought up, where it was now held
that the questions raised by counsel were not
raised by the record. The record did not show
that the tax was imposod on manufacturers
eat of the State, but on those simply without
the city. No question was raised by the record,
therefore, whioh oould be considered under
the twonty-fitth section of the judiciary act.
The writ of error was dismissed. Mr. Justico
Field delivered the opinion.
Steamboats.?The Secretary of the Treas
ury has jast issued a circular to local inspectors
of steamboats, directing them to enforce in the
strictest manner compliance with the act of
Coogress, requiring that suitable and safe pro
vison be nude throughout each vessel (o
guard against Jo^s or danger by lire. The sco
rctary aids : liAs the see son is at hand when
atoves will he rrquired lor the comtort uf passengers
on board steamboats in your district,
you are hereby directed to examine all steamboats
and nquira the stores to be securely
fastened to the floor, or other fixed support, in
suoli manner as to prevtnt them Irom over
turning or Irom falling to pieces in the evc-Gt
of the boar etreeniog or of tbe occurrence of

Counterfeit Monet?Notwithstanding the
recent arrest of persons in New York, charged
with selling counterfeit money, the business is
still carried on there. A friend at Linden
Station, Fauquier county, has scot us a copy
of one of the. circulars of the fellows engaged
in this swindle, proposing to lurnish the parties
to whom they are addressed with counterfeit
monry. Some time ogo, we published
this, or a similar circular. We presume that
no body can possibly be entrapped by these
scoundre's. These circulars are signed with
different fictitious names. It is very annoyiog

Some occupations of life pradispose to Cos- I

Habitual constipation i* a very obstinate dis- f
