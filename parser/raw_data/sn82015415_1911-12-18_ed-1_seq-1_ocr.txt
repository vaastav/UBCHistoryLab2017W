ALL CUTTING

The order of the Hoard of Health,
that all bananas within the limits of
one mile from the harbor muHt be cut
and that nobody shall be allowed to
grow bananas within that limit is not
worth the paper It Is written on, ac
cording to a preliminary ruling mnde
by Judge Cooper this afternoon in the
Lucas case.
In other words, the order of the
Board of Health and the Civic Sani
tary Committee Is null and void and
all the cutting of bananas has been
In violation of tho law. The banana
crusado must stop.

formal ruling, but he stated to the
attorneys for the Territory this aft-j affalB has been won; that The Star,

ciety just missed it.
It was neither a new style in skirts
nor tho measles. It was the Mumbo

dance of Hawaii that puts the Turkey
Trot, Grizzly Bear, Dallas Dip, Frisco
Flop, St. Louis Todalo, Cubanola Glide,
Walla Walla Wiggle, Apacho nnd Sa
lome dances so far in the shade that
they couldn't bo seen with an X-ray.
Chicago just missed It, because Prince
Kuhlo Kalanianaole, delegate to
Congress from Hawaii, was compelled
to loavo with his wife for Washington
last night, after a short but lively stay
nt tho Congress Hotel, during which
champagne . flowed fast. With tears
In his eyes tho princo bemoaned a'
fate that severed ,hlm from Chicago
beforo he could Introduce Into society
tho dance that replaces tho beads nnd
filmy skirt of Salome with a pleasnnt
stnllo and feathers.
And just to prove that the' Hula
Hula is the concentrated essence of
rhythm, motion, art, science, passion '
and delight, tho prince embraced I
a friend and executed tho wlggly con-
tortlons and steps while his beautiful
nui Amazonian princess approved ana
adored.
"ThliS dance was not naughty," said
the prince, "till Americans demanded
something with local color, and now It
resembles tho Parisian cancan or hoo-
cheo-coochee. I regret to state It Is

this dance Is warranted to prevent

At this point, by way or Illustra
tion, C. W.. Ashford, Honolululze.l
Ahicrlcan. and one of tho prlnco's
