Cold Statistics of tho United
Slates Cousus Reveals th? Above
Fact*,
The cold statistics of tho United1
States census bureau frequently re
veal some wonderful things. Among
these, in a bulletin just issued, isl
that South Carolina ranks second in
the number of cotton spindles in the j
United States, being exceeded only
by Massachusetts, and that during I
the past year South Carolina actual
ly increased the number of spindles I
more than 150,000.
This interesting bulletin says:
Massachusetts exceeds every other
State in the number of cotton spin
dles, haying 9,158,389, or 34 per cent
of the total; South Carolina ranks
second, with 3,609,969, or 13 per cent,
and North Carolina third, with 2,
981,386, or 10 per cent, Rhode Island
has fourth placo, Georgia fifth, New
Hampshire sixth and Connecticut
seventh. Massachusetts increased
its number of active spindles during
the year by 307,443, or 3.5 per cent
of the total for the State, while in
Kvtfw Carolina the Increase amount
ed to 262.652, or ll p^r cent. The
increase in South Carolina was more
than 450,000 and in New York near
ly 100,000. According to Table 3
there were 1,141,661 cotton spindles,
exclusive of renewals, added during
the year, thus indicating no cessation
in the progress of the industry. How
ever, the net increase in the total
number of spindles for the year is
1,127,734. This apparent discrepan
cy is accounted for by the fact that
a few plants were dismantled or
abandoned, and to the reduction of
the spindle capacity in others.
In its annual investigation relative
to the cotton industry the bureau
makes no endeavor to segregate
frame and mule spindles; but if the
proportion between these spindles as
returned at the census of 1905, when
this was done, be applied to the stat
istics of active spindles in 1907 the
ligures would he 20.427,395 frame
and 5,947,896 mule.
In addition to the spindles design
ed primarily to spin cotton, 751,251
have been returned as consuming
cotton mixed with other fibres. The
States which load in the manufac
ture of woollen and knit goods na
turally lead in the number of these
spindles. Of the total number re
ported, 137.190, or 21 per cent, were
returned from Pennsylvania; 110,
862, or 17 per cent, from New York;
70,462 from Massachusetts, 52,630
from Connecticut, and smaller num
bers from several other States.
Massachusetts leads in the con
sumption of cotton with 1,253,856
bales or 35 per cent of the total for
1907, followed by North Carolina
with 14 per cent, while South Care
lina takes third place with 13 per
cent. The fourth position is held by
Georgia with ll percent; New Hamp
shire takes fifth, Alabama sixth, and
New York seventh. As stated above,
a comparison on the basis of active
soindles gives some of the States a
slightly different rating. Although
Massachusetts increased its cotton
spindles by more than 300,000, the
quantity of cotton consumed increas
ed less than 20.000 bales. If the stat
istics for South Carolina be examin
ed in a similiar manner it will bj
found that the quantity of cotton
consumed during the year is 5,705
bales less, while the number of spin
dles operated increased more than
150,000. This would indicate a sig
nificant tendency during the year to
spin finer counts, provided, of course,
that the conditions prevailing in the
two years were similiar and the spin
dies were operated in like manner.
In tho mills of the cotton g-owing
States 970,039 spindles were report
ed as having been idle throughout
the year, which is (5(5 per cent of the
idle spindles returned for the emir.;
country. While the scarcity of labor
is largely responsible for this condi
tion throughout the country, it ap
pears more pronounced in the cotton
growing States However, as stated
elsewhere, a considerable number of
the spindles returned as idle from
the cotton growing States were not
in fact idle throughout the year, but
were new, and bad only been install
ed a short time.

Mrs, Theresa Cal?n? Finds Note<l
Crook In Hov llorac, Turns Hhyi
Over to Police and Faint?.
Mrs. Theresa Calo?o ehnsed a bin -
glar down two flights of stairs in her
home, No..74 Elder street, Williams
burg, Wednesday evening and capj
turcd him af ter a struggle. Then shje
handed him over to a policeman.
Admiring neighbors who called
offer congratulations marvelled at
the pluck of the pretty, slendeV
young woman. They marvelled the
more when they heard that the man
was a desperate crook and that he
h&d been released only recently af ttV
serving a two years1 term at Sing
Sing Prison. ? .
Mrs. Calo?? is the wife of Joseph
Calo?o, a well-to-do commission mer
chant. She is twenty-eight years of
age, and is much admired for he
beauty.
When she returned at 6:30 o'cloc'
from a shopping trip she was suij
prised that her rooms were lighttjd
up. She found every jet burning lb
the dining room.
Hearing a rustling in the next roon!*,
she entered. A man, kneeling/on tne
floor, was packing articles he had
taken from a dresser into a bag. She;
had not made the least noise, and lie ,
went on with his work, unconscio ?
of her presence. j
"What are you doing here?" she
demanded.
Tho startled burglar looked up.
sprang to his feet and dashed into
the parlor. The door leading from
that room to the hall was locked.
The man darted back again toward
the dining room. Mrs. Calo?o hal
preceded him but, before she could
lock the dining room door, he ha\l
overtook her. ?
She grappled with him, but the
man struck her in the face, andi
shaking himself loose, ran along th??
hall to thc stairway and down to tte
ground floor.
Mrs. Calo?o, unmindful of the
blow she had received, followed eios?
at his heels. In the ground floor hal),
she tripped him by interposing her
foot as he was springing for the front
door.
He recovered his balance, and then
she hit him a blow that sent him spin
ning backward. The burglar retreat?
ed to the back end of the hall. Fear
ing he would go down to the base
ment and escape, the plucky woman
cornered him and again grappled
with him. .
Then ensued a struggle that took
them from one end of the hall to the 1
other. The man gradually edged his
way to the front door and manage1!
to get it open,
Ile dragged Mrs. Calo?o through
it to the front step, and was about to
make another effort to jerk himse
loose when the policeman approa/i
ed. He relieved Mrs. Calo?o of *a>"
prisoner, and she sank, almost faint
ing, on the doorstep.
There she was found by neighbors,
who, strange to say, had not heard
her cries during the strugglo in thy*
hall. At least they had not respond
ed. y
Mrs. Calo?o had a bruise on
right cheek. The thief hud piHeiJclm

jewelry he could find in the hou<H:\ '
At the Ralph avenue police station
the man gave the name of Matthew
Endrick. He said he was thirty
eight years old, and hud no home.
The police recognized in him and old
offender.
JUSTICIO Prower seems sorry to
have caused trouble, but he is not
going to take it back. He said the
president was playing a game of
"hide and seek" with the nomina
tion, and adds that that is exactly
what he meant. While we think it
in had taste for a judge to criticise
the President as justice Prower did,
we think he sized up Teddy just about
right.

"Too much fresh air ls just enough
-to prevent pneumonia." After
quoting some excellent authorities
on tho need of fresh air, lt Concluded
Its advice on this subject hy saying:
"Ventilate, ventilate, ventilate--In

It ls a .simple thing to escapo the
peril of pneumonia. One (loos not

must avoid exhaustion from exces
sive exertion without proper relaxa
tion, whether that exertion comos
through work or through dissipa
