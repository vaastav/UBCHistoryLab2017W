fecTwitlT its ratification by the United
States senate on Feb. 23, 1904. The
canal properties of the French canal
company were transferred to the Unit­
ed States on April 23, 1904, on pay­
ment of $40,000,000 to that company.
On April 1, 1906, the commission was
reorganized, and it now consists of
Theodore P. Sbonts, chairman Charles
B. Magoon, Benjamin M. Harrod, Bear
Admiral Mordecai T. Endicott, Briga­
dier General Peter C. Hains and Colo­
nel Oswald H. Ernst John F. Stevens
was appointed chief engineer on July
1 last. Active work in canal construc­
tion, mainly preparatory, has been in
progress for less than a year and a
half. During that period two points
about the canal have ceased to be open
to debate. First, the question of route
the canal will be built on the isthmus
of Panama. Second, the question of
feasibility there are no physical ob­
stacles on this route that American en­
gineering skill will not be able to over­
come without serious difficulty or that
will prevent the completion of the canal
within a reasonable time and at a rea­
sonable cost This Is virtually the
unanimous testimony of the engineers
who have investigated the matter for
tb^ government.
?he point which remains unsettled is
the question of type—whether the canal
shall be one of several locks above sea
level or at sea level with a single tide
lock. On this point I hope to lay be­
fore the congress at an etfrly day the
findings of the advisory board of
American and European engineers that
at my invitation have been consider­
ing the subject together with the re­
port of the commission thereon, and
such commdfcts thereon or recommen­
dations in reference thereto as may
seem necessary.
The American people are pledged to
tiie speediest possible construction of
a canal adequate to meet the demands
which the commerce of the world will
make upon it, and I appeal most ear­
nestly to the congress to aid In the ful­
fillment of the pledge. Gratifying prog­
ress has been made during the past
year and especially during the past
four months.' The greater part of the
necessary preliminary work has been
done. Actual work of excavation could
be begun only on a limited scale till the
canal zone was made a healthful place
to live In and to work in. Hie isthmus
had to be sanitated first This task has
been so thoroughly 'accomplished that
yellow fever has been ^virtually ex­
tirpated from the isthmus and gen­
eral health conditions vastly improv­
ed. The same methods which con­
verted the island of Cuba from a pest
hole, which menaced the health of the
world. Into a healthful place of abode
have been applied on the Isthmus with
satisfactory results. There Is no rea­
son to doubt that when the plans for
water supply, paving and sewerage of
Panama and Colon and the large labor
camps have been fully carried out tile
isthmus will be, for the tropics, an un­
usually healthy place of abode. The
work is so far advanced now that the
health of all those employed In canal
work Is as well guarded as it Is on sim­
ilar work in this country and else­
where.
Quarters For Employee*. W
In addition to sanitating the isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid­
ed for employees and an adequate sys­
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable
priced
has been cre­
ated. Hospitals have been established
and equipped that are without superi­
ors of their kind anywhere. The coun­
try has thus been made fit to work In,
and provision has been made for the
welfare and comfort of those who are
to dp the work. During the past year
a large portion of the plant with which
the work is to be done has been or­
dered. It is confidently believed that
by the middle of the approaching year
a sufficient proportion of this plant will
have been Installed to enable us to re­
sume the work of excavation on a
large scale.
What is needed now ang without de­
lay is an appropriation by the congress
to meet the current and accruing ex­
penses of the commission. The first
appropriation of f10,000,000 out of the
$136,000,000 authorized by the Spooner
act was made three years ago. It is
nearly exhausted. There is barely
enough of it remaining to carry the
commission to the end of the yearl" Un­
less the congress Bhall appropriate be­
fore that time all work must cease. To
arrest progress for any length of time,
now, when matters are advancing so:
satisfactorily, would be deplorable.

THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
which to meet bills coi
ue for ma-
terials and supplies, and. there will be,
demoralization of the forces here and.
on the isthmus, now working so har­
moniously and effectively, if' there is
delay In granting an emergency appro­
priation. Estimates of the amount nec­
essary will be found in the accompany­
ing reports of the secretary of war and
the commission.
The Department Stati."
I recommend more adequate provi­
sion than has been made heretofore for
the work of the department of state.
Within a few years there has been a
very great increase In the amount and
importance of the work to be done by
that department both in Washington
and abroad. This has been caused by
the great increase of our foreign trade,
the increase of wealth among our peo­
ple, which enables them to travel more
generally than heretofore, the Increase
of American capital which Is seeking
investment^ foreign countries and the
growth of our power and weight in the
councils of the civilized world. There
has been no corresponding Increase of
facilities for doing the work afforded
to the department having charge of our
foreign relations.
Neither at home nor abroad is there
a sufficient working force to do the
business properly. In many respects
the system which was adequate to the
work of twenty-five or even ten years
ago Is inadequate now and should, be
changed. Our consular force should
be classified, and appointments should
be made to the several classes, with
authority to the executive to assign the
members of each class to duty at such
posts as the Interests of the service re­
quire instead of the appointments be­
ing made, as at present, to specified
posts. There should be an adequate
Inspection service, so that the depart­
ment may be able to Inform Itself how
the business of each consulate is being
done, instead of depending upon cas­
ual private information or rumor. The
fee system should be entirely abolished
and a due equivalent made In salary to
the officers who now eke out their sub­
sistence by means of fees. Sufficient
provision should be made for a- clerical
force In every consulate, composed en­
tirely of Americans, Instead of the in­
sufficient provision now made, which
compels the employment of great num­
bers of citizens of foreign countries
whose services can be obtained for less
money. At a large part of our consul­
ates the office quarters and the clerical
force are inadequate to the perform­
ance pi the onerous duties Imposed by
the recent provisions of our Immigra­
tion laws as weU as by our increasing
trade. In many parts of the world the
lack of suitable quarters for our em­
bassies, legations and consulates de­
tracts from the respect in which our
officers ought to be held and seriously
impairs their weight and Influence.
Suitable provision should be made
for the expense of keeping our diplo­
matic officers more fully Informed of
what is being done from day to day
In the progress of our diplomatic af­
fairs with other countries. The lack of
such Information, caused by insuffi­
cient appropriations available for cable
tolls and for clerical and messenger
service, frequently puts our officers at
a great disadvantage and detracts
from their usefulness. The salary list
should be readjusted. It does not now
correspond either to the importance of
the service to be rendered and the de­
grees of ability and experience requir­
ed in the different positions or to the
differences In the cost of living. In
many cases the salaries are quite inad­
equate.

Tfce Flshtlnar Gander.
There axe few better lighters than a
goose, or a gander more particularly.
Those ragged white Russian geese bite
like bulldogs. It Is no mere peck with
them. They bite and hang on. The
common old farmyard gander is a capi­
tal fighter when he Is driven to It. At
a certain place In Scotland there used
to be a caged golden eagle Bte pre­
ferred to kill his own dinner, and It
used to be a cruel sport to watcb him
dispose of any unfortunate hen or
guinea fowl that was put Into his. cage.
They tried him, I believe, with every
sort of domestic poultry. Ducks, pea­
fowls, turkeys, the eagle was master of
them alL He had no trouble ln finish­
ing them off, no trouble even with the
"bubbly jock." At length they tried
him with a gander, but he could make
nothing of it The gander crouched
Into a coma, drew back his heuS, pre­
senting nothing but a bzoad, square!ike
bill from which ever quarter the eagle
tried to attack him.
The eagle fumed and fretted and
grew very angry. He made desperate
attempts to take the gander In the
flank, but the wise old bird defeated
them all In the end they had to giye
the gander his liberty as the reward of
hie courage and to satisfy the eagle
with the much more succulent dainty
of a young turkey poult—MacmlBan's

Cleveland, Dee. 6.—Mrs. Cassia h.
Chadwiek was taken into the federal
bankruptcy court upon her own re­
quest for the purpose, as She stated,
of completing her testimony as to
some of her financial dealings. Al*
though she has recently stated that
she could reveal certain facts of im­
portance nothing of that nature was
brought out and the hearing ended
with Mrs. Chadwiek In a: hysterical
condition bordering on collapse. A
physician who was present stated to
the court that the woman was in a
•cry bad physical condition and should
sot have undertaken the task of going
into court He said that she suffered
ivestiy from heart trouble.
