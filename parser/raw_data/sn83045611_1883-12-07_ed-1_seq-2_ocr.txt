So portiou of the President's message I
will be received by the general public
with more hearty approbation than his
refert nee to the Mormon c|U**'.iou and
recommendation wi h respect to the
yovvrnment of I tab. These lo the
wry bottom id' etf »irs. lie uriirs that
under the existing system of territorial ;
government and sofl.age it is "» <**» j
ble to frame, adopt and ex<*c ;te an>
liWS which are effective f sl.t.up out
the abomination of p lygi . . .a- mar
riages, aud. adopting the vi; v- < ; <,ov ;
.Vlurmy in his lite rej-jrt to the S.cre- j
tary of the Interior, recommends the i
abolition of the preieut form of govern
uieiit in L'tab by re eal of the law i»ro
yiding for it, and that the people of
that Territory l>e governed by a com
mission appointed under a special law
enacted for that purpose, which shall
prescribe their duties, powers, etc. In
a word, the President uas come to the
conclusion that acute diseases require
prompt and radical remedies, and that
the present Mormon priesthood and
membership are as litt.e entitled to ex
ercise the privileges of franohise and
enjoy the boon of self government as
are the savages at the Sau Carlos agency
lu Arizona. The whole country is (win*
awakened to the fuct that there exists
in the heart of this ureat country
a living, growiuu cancer, winch,
if not extirpated, will sooner
or later reach the vitals of
the Nation. If Congress, following the
counsel of the President, should pass a
law withdrawing from I tah its pn sent
Territorial Government and in its stead
, rovide as in the District of Columbia,
Commissioners for its management,
there would soon be a different stale of
affairs in that territory. It would not
be very long ere it woul l bo pissible to
conviot and punish a man for a polyga
mous marriage, and the priesthood who
now defiantly flauut their ciim. s in the
face of law and Courts, would sd in
sackcloth and ashes, or l<e'.tt>r itill, be
employed in breakiuK stone it (*>me
prison of the country. Ihe F lumiids
bill has not effected the hoped for re
sult. It has been opposed per* stoutly
by the Mormon priestho >.l aud its pro
visions rendered nuj< itory by various
methods. The reappointment of Gov.
Murray, which it is aunouueed the
President has decidad on, will empha
size the recommendation in the mes
sage and the enactment by (Jongrew of
a law abolishing tie Territorial Gov
ernment, supplemented by a Board of
governing Commissioners with the
Governor as Chairman, would tend to
straighten out the tangles in the Mor
mon question in short order.
|UK POSTAL TKI W-HtrM.
The President in his message dissents
fi-oiu the rec miiuend ition of the Post
muster General Unit the government as
sume the *llllll control over the tele
graph which it has always exercised
over the mail. This might i>erha|»s have
expected. Hut it strikes us that
on a subject of so great importance, and
in condemning a measure so strongly
urged and demanded by the public, and
whioh after thorough investigation had
Iteeii recommended l»y oue of his i/abi
net officers, the people were entitled to
receive some better reasons than those
given in the message. I'iie old objec
tiou of competition with private enter
prise is urged regardless of tlie fact that
it is the duty always of the government
to protect its people against extortion
and outrage, and the further fact that
the mail service of the present day is
in dir«3t conflict with the business of
expressage in one of its formerly licst
paying departments, to wit: small par
eels. The other objection is that it
would add a large number of employees
to the already numerous civil st rvioe
list. This point is not well taken. I'u
der proper regulations. honestly
euforoed, the vital objection to a
large oivil service list, i. e., the partisan
power it gives and aids to perpetuate,
falls to the ground. The employees of
a government telegraph oiiuld be and
should be as abselutely non partisan as
soldiers and officers of the army and
navy. That is to say. there should be
as little partisan preforeuoe in their
nppoiutment; they should be employed
because of fitness exclusively, and
should hold position either for definite
terms of service or during good l>eha
vior. They should be enlisted under
stringent regulations, amply paid and
placed nnder heavy penalties for viola
tion of confidence or ueglect of duty.
There are uo practical reasons why this
plan would not snoceed. and its adop
tion would knock the last peg from un
der the worst monopoly of this genera
tion. The tenderness shown a corpora
tion whioh collects of the public an an
nual tax five times as great a* necessary
to pay fair dividends upon its actual
cost and value, is most remarkable. Ihe
ueeds o. the people seem to be ignored
in the fear that goverun ent competition
may reduoe the dividends of Jay
Gould A Co. The President, while
treating most subjects in his message
with strength, haudles this matter much
too gingerly to suit the general publie,
and his expression of a belief, in con
eluding his reference to the subject,
that the government ought to exercise
some sort of supervision over inter
State telegraph communication will not
satisfy .even someofhis l»est friends that
his sympathy with public needs is all
abeorbiug.
After noting the proposal to erect a
new home for the ('resident of the
luited States, and to surrender the ex
ecutive mansion to public bwuwis. a
correspondent says: " Many people
wunder why it costs s» much to keep
the exeoutive mansion in order. Col.
Itockwell says the wear aud tear of the
furniture exceeds that of any hotel in
the oouutry. The people, to the aver
age of 508 a day. insist upon seeing the
White House. They most tread uj-o»
the carpets and rest tbemselvi s in the
tempting chairs. 1 hey lunst exau-ine,
with their eyes aud fingers, all the up
holatery and drapery. When it is re
membered that this is every
day in the year, it will cease to be a mat
ter of wonder that the wear is so rapid."

A* kce« hi nr.*
i wo reporter* of tbi« yesterday
witnessed the same scene. and. unbe
known to eieh other. both wrote it up
Here are their different account* of it:
Hk Had His Own Wa*.— Among the
s»ll«rs who »b!pjfd on board the Cbai
lenger. going to Ht 'a yesterday, was one
noisy, boisterous fellow, who give a
heap of trouble bef re he was g t on
board. He ranted and tore aroun ♦. and
made a free exhibition of him#-lf fo
cjoite a tini*-. *nd finally, when in the
boat, declared he wanted to j imp over
board. Ca|»tain Thompson toid the
inen to let him jump, which tbev did.
when the fellow planned into tae bay.
Once in he showed no intention of
drewuiny. but swam about the U-st he
was able. He took in considerable
water, and when jus; about readv to
drown wart hauled into the boat. with
which he then gladly went to the ship
If they had not let the fellow have his
own way he'd have been unhappy to the
end of the voyage, but now. on the con
trsry, he will prababiy be one of the
most tractable men on the ship.
A Ijiu nkkn -Saiixjr. —A drunken sailor
from the Challenger created some ex
citement on Yesler'* wharf yesterday
afternoon bv his wild and frantic ac
tions. He was finally forced into a boat
by his companions, and they started to
pall for the ship. They had. however,
takes bat a few strokes when the
drnnktn madman threw himself into
the water and swaiii as rapidly as possi
ble away from the boat. Another boat
put oat from shore to his assistance,
but he fought furiously with the man
who attempted to pull him from the
water, lu tue mean time the tirst uoat
bad caught up, and after a desperate
struggle the fool was drawn luto it and
forced to lie still on the bottom. He
was then takeu out to the ship and
forced on board after another struggle.
Ihe man gave as the reason of his
strange behavior that he wanted an
other drink before going oil Istard, but
the crowd which the disturbance col
lected seemed to l»e prettv generally of
the opinion that the best plan to pursu*
in the case would hive been to allow
the fellow to drown as quietly as jxissi
ble.

Noi K Goon AUOI'MKNT. — it is a bad
argument on the part of the handful of
territorial divisionists tli.it because tlie
interests of ;i section are ldentiOMi there
ottli lie uo antagonism, and, oil thi
otl.er hand, that there must be bitter
and unending antagonism where the
interests are opposed. The general ill
lerests of Seattle and l acoma are the
same. the trade of both is in the same
articles—lumber, eoal, fish, hops, etc.
I'hey are both railroad aud steamboat
towns, on the same lines of travel, hav
lug the same class of citizens, and in
almost every rubied having identical
interests. Aud yel no one will pretend
to say that there is not a real aud 111
teuse antagonism between the two
places, greater than anything of the
sort betweeu Eastern and Western
Washington. I'ortlaud and Aston a are
two similar instances; also .Spokane and
<'honey. Why, some places can hardl}
endur* to be in the mini a county with
other placts, though their interests are
precisely the Same oil ivery but
out). It may be supposed thft the in
terests of the Sound country are the
same, but arc they really so? Ihe lower
Sound wants a pilot law, and at every
legislative session c intends loudly for
it. The middle and upper Sound do
not want it. Is this a ground fur the
division of the I'erritory 't We might
go 011 ludeliuitelv reciting the local Sim
ilarities and differenciS and local
contentious aud strifes, but none of
them would really furnish a single wor
thy argument in favor of division—an
argument that would l>e at all satisfac
tory to the people of the Territory at
large. The people of Washington want
no division, but rather au extension
takui < m North Idaho, as prayed for b>
the inhabitants thereof.
A MUKPKHKU AT LABOK.— There is a
feeling throughout the Couuty that a
greater effort should be made to capture
Stone, the murderer of Hopkins, on
thanksgiving day. A reward should be
offered for him, dead or alive. It is now
stated on pretty good authority that
certain parties iu that vicinity aided
aud abetted Stone in his murderous at
tack on Hopkins. If such is the case,
they should be arrested aud punished.
This community cannot afford to lost
its reputation for hunting out aud pun
ishing villatus and murderers, and
Stone aud his gang are good subjects to
practice on. The offioers have lieen
vigilant aud diligeut, but it would seem
that a good detective should be set t<>
work to get at the bottom facts ot thi*
terrible erime in wbioii a good citizen
was wronged, and then shot dowu iu
his tracks by a man whose hands have
heretofore been stained with human
blood, if reports concerning him ar«
true. Stone is a bad man, aud should
t»e caught and hung, if uot by law. by
the people, who are greater than tbe
law. This same Stone was iudtct>>d at
the last term of by the Grand
Jury, for flourishing a revolver in an
angry aud threatening manner, in a
crowd, but the petit jury acquitted him,
thus turning him l«Hise on the cum
uiuuitv to shoot ami kill whenever his
murderous temper prompted hi iu to do
so, and the result has been as stated
above. No patus or expense should l»-
spared to capture this slayer of his fel
low man. He is probably skulking
alxuit in the vicinity of his murderous
work, waiting an opportunity to cross
the mountains into Kasteru Wash
ingtou.

THK CIIIMICI'M VALLH. — Mr. K. S.

our office yesterday. Mr. ltubinsoii in
out) of the pioneers of the North Pacific,
and served iu the Legislature in 1855
and iu IH.K;, with Arthur A. Denny, of
this city, for wh mi Mr. Kobinsou voted
for Speaker. Mr. Kobinsou took up it
faim iu Chimicuiu Valley, Jefferson
county, where he has since dwelt almost
an ordinary lifetime. His business is
dairying. H* raises two hundred tons
of bay a year, keeps a hundred he id of
cattle, aud makes a great quantity of
choice butter, whioh finds ready sale
any plaoe where offered at the
market rates. The t'hiinicum Valley is
a uardt'U spot of great excellence and
ruucb f»eauty. In it are about twenty
farms, the greater part of which are de
voted to dairying. Upwards of 22,000
pounds of butter were made during the
past reason, aud six or seven thousaud
pouuds of cheese. More cheese would
Have been made had it beeu possible to
obtain the milk, but the farmers would
not sell the milk, preferring to turn
into butter as much of it as possible.
Mutter has averaged then. 40 cents a
pound this year, and has been in extri{
ordinary demand at tnat. The Iron
! works of the Puget Sound Company are
located iu the Valley, from whioh the
ore is obtained, it being bog ore. That
heretofore obtained has contained too
much sulphur to render its making into
pigs profitable. In oonsequence the
works have not been run all tUe time to
their full capacity, and the product has
been small to an extent quite disap
pointing to thoae who had builded their
uopes anou it. A better class of ore
further down has since b©eu discovered,
which itjis thought will insure continu
ous operations during the r.ext two
years and indefinitely thereafter. When
fully eiuploved the par roll of the com
pany amounts to $14,000 a month. A

TNK LOST mtNCB
The steamship Viatoiia rati ou the!
Orford reef daring the night of Oct.
:>th, and in getting off again. she was
beached in Port Orford, in an endeavor
to save her. No lives were lost. It
■ieems a mystery how such an accident
could happen on so tine a night. Cape i
Blanoo is about eight miles north of ;
Port O.ford. being the most western j
|>oiut of land south of Cape Flattery, i
From Cajie HI inoo extends the HI inco ]
reef in a southwest direction about a j
mile, then comes a channel abmt one j
and one-half nul»M wide, and uext the j
Orford reef, extending two or three;,
miles in the s.wue direction as Hlanco |
reef, so that its southernmost rock Fox |
Rock' lies abont west of Fort Orford
he id. and distaut about four and one
half miles. Orford reef consists to sow?
extent, of tall, isolated rocks IU the J
shaj>e of j>eaks md arches, curious and
picturesque in the extreme. Blanco
reef is mostly low rocks, and mo>t of it
slightly nuder water. As there is an ex
cellent light ou Cape Blanco, and as the
night W;LS clear and starry, it seems
queer ho s such an accident could
I happen. So wrote a correspondent,
who wrote a day later Nov. HOth i *as
follows: "The ship is under water from
rift to about amidships. She has ap
parently brok*in two amidships. She
j had OH 1925 tons of coal and salmon.
The crew of forty and tive passengers
! were all saved. The ship will be a total

CANDY MAKING,— A reporter dropped
in at U. Merchant it Co.'s candy factory
yesterday and was muab surprised at
what he saw. He found no less than
six girls and three boys, under the di
rection of a foreman, busily at work
there, making aud putting up candy as
fast as they ceald drive. The reporter
had previously supposed that the candy
makers in that establishment numbered
one, and was considerably taken back
to find ten instead. These ten persons
turn out mo e CMudy in a day than the
average reader would believe was sold
on all Puget Sound. All that they
make is quickly disposed of, though, as
he who frequently passes Wy the store
aad sees the active trade going on, will
readily believe.

purchasers will please call at all the other
real estate offices first, ascertain their low
est prices, then come to us, and we will
sell property adioining as good, if not bet
ter, ten per cent, below the lowest prices
obtained '1 his is an unsurpassed oiler,
and we are in a position to stand by what
we say. as we own Five Hundred and Fif
ty-four lots in our own name, in all parts
of Seattle, ranging in price from SSO to
§IO,OOO per lot We own the following
blocks in Burke's second addition: 7, 8,
19, 20, to. 46, 53, 58, 60, 61 and 77. eleven full
blocks. 132 lots in that addition. We own
four blocks on Jackson street ; those two
beautiful blocks, lit and "20, on the top of
the hill, 315 feet above the lake and level
as a floor, from which the most magnifi
cent view of l>oth the lake and the bay can
be had. 'I here are few places in the world
from which such bodies of salt and fresh
water can be seen. The rich uian can buy
a block and pay for it. The workingman
can pay part and have his own time for
balance; and we will give the poor man a
lot and let him pay for it. if he ever gets
able.
When we had plenty of money we were
always ready to help a poor devil, and
have given our last dollar to him we
thought in greater need than ourselves:
now we haven't a great deal of money
but any God's quantity of property, and
we are ready to give home to the poor
and such bargains to the rich as has never
been ottered in Seattle before. Come one
and ah! Lots of envious idiots will say
this is only a " Phinney blow," but the
proof of the pudding is in eating it. Come
and see for yourselves.
Now is the time to buy real estate, be
fore the spring raise and rush. Look at
the daily records. You will see the long
headed, far-sighted business man quietly
gathering it in.
This offer ceases when we have sold
enough to put us out of debt.
