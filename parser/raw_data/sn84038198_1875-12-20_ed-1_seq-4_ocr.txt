with the facta aud would compel the power gran ting It

the principle* which have heretofore been Its sure and

A recognition of the indcleuulence of Ouha being, In

and even I tie act* of Spain hortell ol this very natare,
might be pointed to In d*fecM of tuch recognition.
Hat now.at In Ita put history, trnUnited State* tbould

LOSS OF HAIR.
Boston, July if.
M?*M. jMtPM BfUNrXTk Co.t
For many month? my hair had been falling off,
until 1 wai fearful of Imine it entirely. The akin
upon my head bccame gradually more and more in
flamed. to that I could not touch it without pain.
Uy the advice of my physician, to whom you had
*hown your proceuoi purifying the Oil, I commenced
in use the Uit week in June. The fint application
allayed the itching and irritation. In three or four
day? the redneu and tendernen ditapneared, the
hair ceased to fall, and! have now a thicV growth of
new hair.
Yourt, very truly, SUSAN R. EDDY.
A REMARKABLE CASE.
Ea*t MinDtKnono', Mass., June 9, iM<.
Messrs. Hfksarr A Co.:
When my daughter'* hair came off she had been
afflicted with neuralgia in her head for three years.
She had u?ed, during that time, many powerful ap
plication*. These, with the intense heat caused by
the pains, burned her hair so badly tha*. in October,
iBflt, it all came off, and for two year* after her head
was as imooth as her face.
Through the recommendation of a friend, she wai
induced, to try your Cocoaixr, and the result was
astonishing. She had not used half the contents of a
bottle belore her head was covered with a fine younc
hair. In four months the hair has grown several
inches in length, very thick, loft and line, and of a
darker eolar than formerly.
With respect, WM. S. EDDY.
