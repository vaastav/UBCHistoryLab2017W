CONDITION OF THE SOUTHERN 8TATES.
OUR MILLEBtEWlE COIBESPOtlKWCt.
Hi. i wmittiiijEf Gft-i Dec. 6, 1800.
The meeting of the Legialature concentrates Informa
tion In reference to all parts of the .-Hate. Milled/eville
la i small place of some two thousand Inhabitants, half
and half, with but one hotel of any prominence, in
which a majority of the members, and those of most
Intelligence and influence at home, are domiciled to
gether for the spaoe ef the six woek* which the session
la-ls. Tno utmost freedom prevullv in tho intercour o
of tho members. All disguise is thrown off, and que
tlous of all klndq nre dlacussed with all tho abandon
that prevailed in the palmiest days of the confederacy.
There Is a disposition, to which I think propor to
allnde, among some who have lost all by the success of
the United States arms, and who ha\ a not entered upon
tho work of repairing their fortunes, or who may have
settled down In a permanent sttle of dospondonoy, to
talk, In a very free and unlicensed manner, against the
measures of the government. This freedom of
speech they sometimes use with a sort of flcndlsh
pleasure, whenever Northern correspondents are pros
ent, little recking how their conversation would appear
In Northern prints. And sometimes this sort of speech
Is need with evident Intention to mislead those whom they
think would gloat over tho revelations they pretend to
make, as evidence of lurking troason In the Southern
?eart. It Is possible that sometlmos Ignorance profound
and depravity unexampled may lead to tho expression
ef disloyal sentiments towards a government all have
?worn to support, and under whose protection they en
joy the very freedom of speech which they so grossly
pervert At home their conduct Is regretted. But wher
ever you see men determined to reinstate themselves in
the atniles of fortune, and to build up for themselves
name and fame, nothing of the kind alluded to occurs.
The deprivation of fortune and the sudden plunging
Into the vale of poverty, If not oT penurv, has ofton
proved a source of demoralization; and not tho lo.sof
property in slaves nor other pecuniary losses so
much excite our pity and commiseration as the
Absence of self-reliance, em rgy and oconomy where
tbmt Is all that can avail for the attainment of cornp"
tency. If you hco a man industriously at work to set
himself up again, and to make use of all the means 10
Ilia power to re-establish the fortune be may have lost,
you may set It down as certain that such a man leaves
the government to go Its own way, and politics to take
care of themselves. Nothing would make a Northern
man more regret the nnn-reMoratlon of tho iftely re
bellious States than the plea that is made by some of
Ihe fact to engage in ho work by which Individual pro"
Klty may be promoted and tho general weal of the
te and of the whole country enhanced.
We do not wish to be understood as implying that any
vary large class of the citizens of Georgia are hopeless
or desponding. The results of the crops this year prove
Uta contrary. In the faco of one of the most baleful
drought* that the Plate has ever seen the crops are such
aa to give the greatest encouragement for future agricul
taral labor. Reasoning man will take Into account the
pbsUclee in the way of successful agriculture this year,
aad will be encouraged by partial success to strive
harder the coming year. Already men have expressed
(heir regrets that they have lost a year in inactivity,
and another year they are determined to dob" tier ; while
(ha feeling of hope has sprung up gouoraily In the Afri
aaa breast, and higher wages are u.-kod and promised the
osxt year.
The Legislature af the State is also Influenced by gene
ral hope which has revived. Railroads have been char
tered to run In evary direction through the State. State
encouragement has been given to foreigners and people
from the North to settle here, aod manufacturing and
mining companies are as abundant as could be dial red.
No |
> papers are shunned because they are radical tf they
are truer A" the principal papers of Now York are
freely circulated, and I even beard the JYibune spoken
ef by a prominent member of tho Leg'hlaturo as one of
Ibe best and ablest papers la the country.
In mauy Instances the transformation of habits among
people Is truly wouderful. I have often seen the
keecl * ' "
i character sticking out so plainly In native born
e Georgians that 1 have wondered myself. Men and even
Woman and children have gone to the field or to appro
priate work, while the African is loft foe to fllTlhe
?eboolhousos t
i with his children, and to refuse to allow
MB children to do menial work. The change will still go
- cbsni
la addition to ttiis a very marked change is taking
Sin thj comparative number of whites and black* in
of the reunites. The counties best adapted to the
J of cotton, whero the best prices for lanor can be
are d'-pluiiug rapidly the grain counties, while
ever the road* thai lead to the more fertile lands of
(be West a constant stream of block population is flow
ing with Increasing volume. A bill will be Introduced
lite the Legislature to tax negro brokers $f>00. as it is
seriously apprehended that under the enticing influence
ef high wages some counties may lose land the loss will
be forever) mure of tho black population than can be
gl spared at tho present time. Under the inspiring
uSnce of hope aDd reviving prosperity the demoral
.ion and marked mortality among the African race
been arrested.
The great incubus on Georgia Is private debts. The
eu
Legislature strongly squints at repudiation ? but it
certain)? will not be attempted in this session,nexcept
py tbe influence of stay and exemption laws of the kind
Indicated formerly.
The bonds of the ra lroad to run from Maoon to Bruns
wick will be endorsed by tbe Mate, and In consequence
frs friends to the measure who have been using ad iheir
Mfrglss to carry the measure through the Legislature
think the road will be tin.*hed In twelve or eighteen
months. The railroad known a* the Alt Lino, whose
President lives in New York, will also have Its bonds
Corsed by the State; at least such Is tbe probability.
Legislature has pasted a hill to that effect, aud tbe
?ly doubt on tho subject Is whether a two thirds ma

The President's Message. or rather a portion of It, is at
baud, but the antloiv to benrfr un Congress overshadows
evervthl g else, and but Utile Internet Is taken In what
thw President has to ray. Tho people ur.< heginnlug to
feel that they arc completely at (ho morcy of Oongr-M,
an l every movement of that body w It .lio looked upon
with the deepest interest. Consequently I am assert
the question a dozen uri.es every dsy, "What la the
news irirm Washington t" Everywhere the hope is crt
prugsed that' Degress will not act precipitately in ilio
matter, and that the Sontbern Stales will ho allowed a
few weeks' gra<'o before any dollnlte plan is agreed
upon Horn of ibe legislatures, among (be re-i llio

few days, as Is Ui>- ru.-;iotn, have de< ided to lake a r cess
until ine l.Ttb of January, so that th" members rnlgut
have uu opportunity ot going home and conferring with
their constituents, and ihcy are anxious (hut Congress
will not decide upon any plan of action before the different
legislatures infer again. There Is no dould the Southern
people siifU bo better prepared to act uiiuit the cons' I1 u
tioniil amendment six weeks h"Bce than they are to
day. Tliey arc becoming more reconciled to tueir pecu
liar-situation day after day, and from the assuraucee I
havo moeived from several of the leading men In the
legislature I liave no hesitation In saying tiiut in less
than six weeks from uow ihe people of Alabama will
be fully prepared to vote for the adoption of the consti
tutional amendment or sumo klndrid meavtro lhal will
he acceptable io Congress and the people of the North.
"Give us a little lune,'' they nay, "to go a ud sue our

they ray, and I have no doubt will act in good faith If
OongTe -a allows them the tow weeks of grace they ask
for.
Judge VCIIev, the member of Congress ot?ct from this
district, leaves for Washington iu fin looming. He is a
staunch Union man. and will, no doubt do wh it ho oan
to induce Congress not to act precipitately in any matter

There are two or three matters of tact which 1 Mud
'you this morning aa no illustration ol what Ih going on
In the ?-Olct North Slate."
The "rogulatotv," or, mora appropriately, "nnhiing
scoundrels," have renewed their work or burning, rob
bing and n^rderiog with vigor as Christmas approaches.
Tlie operation-) are mnDtly eonflneri to the (Custom half
of the >tnte, and their compllmeuts are almost univer
sally paid to negroes and Ventre", thereby indicating
the animus of tlie animal. The devil* who compose the
rank and Oleof these "regulators" are low born brute*;
but they are led by the eons and relatives of former na
bobs, and, inasmuch as the better classes do not cauae
them to oe arrested and hung, therefore I charge that
theee upper classes sympathize with them. It does no
good for them to say thev do not, so long as they remain
passive, while their sons and relatives are encouraging
and leading on the miscreants to their work of dia
bolism.
Recently thev set Ire to the ylu house of a Mr. Col
grove, a Northerner, who had purchased and was culti
vating a plantation In Jones county. Bo idee the sin
bouae they destroyed his ootton prose and quite a large
amount of cotton that he had gathered, pretty much
ruining the rnan'a prospects. And it was lot?uded that
It should ruin him. They don't winl the "damned Yan
