WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS IN
BACK PANEL DECORATION.
Following as a logical outgrowth of
the back trimming effects which have
inundated the entire fashion world
these last few month3 comes the
vogue of the back panel decoration,
which is right now on a decided way
of prominence and favor
Perhaps one special reason of its
popularity is the wld rauge of oppor
tunity It offers to bring into play all
sorts and kinds of handsome and ef
fective dress materials It does not
have to follow the color or material
scheme of the dress any more than
doeB the tunic or panier, and yet It
i is quite as striking and distingue a
mode of trimming
Wider and more varied is the as
sortment of panels being ehown these
days Hand painted panels and pan
els of metal fabrics, panels of elab
orately brocaded Roods, and panels
edged with stunningly dyed furs
which either match or contrast with
the dress material shown are dis
played in the most exclusive shops
From the simplest afternoon frock of
serge and silk to the most elaborate
evening creation of black Chantiih
and jel thpse panels are to be seen
As for their length, there is no uoi
forraity as far as that is concerned
Some of the panels drop to the bot
tom of the gown, while others barelj
reach below the waist line and yet
still Insist on being designated by
the name of back panel The most
popular length, however, is that of the
throe-quarter panel, which comes
down to the knee9 In the back, some
times ending In a point and sometimes
squaring off abrupt h
The tassel fringe on the edge of Hie
panel is a novelty which so far has
only been shown on some of the ex
treme models. From all indications
however, there seems no reason for
believing this special style of trim
roing will not become popular in time
It allows of such an infinite varietv of
styles and fancies that it is bound to
appeal to the heart of every normal,
clothes loving woman.
One charming evening frock of
white chiffon and charmeuse boasted
a narrow back panel which fell from
the edge of the low neck quite to the
hem of the skirt and was caught down
at the belt by a huge Japanese bow,
"mousrae," they call It of vivid s r
let satin This same panel was edg
ed with tiny red rosebuds, a bit of a
rhinestone sparkling in the heart of
each bud Roses edged th" ?mall
puffpd shoulder sleeves and also the
mousme bow
Panels have even made their way
into the most exclusive negligees of
the season. One wine red chiffon
negligee splashed with handsomely
brocaded gold roses had a tln panel
dropping from the neck down and
fastened at the belt line by a huge
amber satin butterfly bow
Some of the smartest shirtwaists
this fall are of washable material, but
are quite unstarched. An exaggera
ted limpness In all Hues of dress is
ttill In vogue
Lace top shoes with patent leather
ramp? and showing a lining of slik
inderneath the heavy lace, to match
Ihe costume worn, are extremely mod
lab just now They are one of the
best examples to show the excessive
, qie to w hich lace Is brought these
present days

AT THE ORPHEUM.
With a company of players whose

changing him from the Indulgent httB
band to a brute having only the prim

The story Is gripping in its dramatic
situations and has running through it
a vein of delicious humor that brings
n smile through the tears and that

MAY AMEND THE

Washington, Dec 2 Heiore con

Bank deposit guarantee treasury
officials prefer 'insurance" to "guar
antee" Is looked upon with favor
bv the officers of the comptroller of
thp currency
Officials declare that deposit in
surance to be effective must be ac
companied by changes In the power
ol the comptroller so that he shall
be given more latitude In tho curing
ol sick banks. Under the present
law the comptroller can only close
n Shakj bank peremptorily or place
It in the hands of a receiver. In
many cases the comptroller finds a
bank solvent and In fairly good con
ditlon but Its management is faulty
To close such an Institution under
the proposed law would mean an un
necessary drain on the guarantee
fund.
Officials believe an enlargement ol
the comptrollers power giving him
authority to replace the management
with men of better financial Juug
mcnt would prevent many failures
and strengthen the guarantee clause.
Guarantee Is favored by trodBUn
officials because of a bel'ef among
