Came to sn End Shortly After a O'clock
Sunday Morning; The Arrange- -ments
for the Funeral.
Canton, O., Deo. 13. Mrs. McKinley
passed from life at a few minutes past
8 o'clock Sunday morning with all of
her children and other immediate rel
atives at her bedside. She did not suf
fer any in her last hours, but gradually
passed from the deep Bleep in which
she had rested almost constantly for
ten days into the sleep of death.
The end was beautiful in its quiet
and peacefulness. Mrs. McKinley
seemed to sleep so soundly that it wa
difficult to tell whether she had yet
breathed her lasj. This condition con
tinued for half an hour. There was no
struggle. She seemed to sleep her life
away.
Funeral service over the remain of
Mrs. McKinley will be held in the
First Methodist Episcopal church of
this city at 1 o'clock Tuesday after
noon. Interment will follow in West
Lawn cemetery, just west of the city,
and Tuesday evening President Mc
Kinley and wife and the officials from
Washington who attend the funeral
will leave for the capital.
Rev. Manchester, the pastor of the
church, will extend an invitation to
the minister of all the churches, of
which there are about SO, to occupy
the pulpit and participate in the serv
ices. '
Pall-bearer have been selected from
among the older members of the
church and those who for years have
been close neighbors of the deceased.
They are: Judge William R. Day, Hon.
William A. Lynch, ex-Mayor Cassidy,
L. L. Miller, W. W. Clark, Judge Mc
Carty, David Zollars and ex-Mayor
John F. Blake.
The First Methodist church is the
one in which Mother McKinley wor
shipped during her residence in Can
ton and in which she was found almost
every Sunday morning. ' Three weeks
ago yesterday she was in her pew as
usual, and though she was nearly 89
years of age her attendance had been
regular all the while. This is also the
congregation with which the president
has always been associated. It was in
this church that he was superintend
ent of the Sunday-school 80 years ago,
and here that he always attended
Bervice when in Canton, usually going
with his mother. They last attended
together last September. The presl
dent is a member of the board of trus
tees of the church.
It is a coincidence that Mrs. McKln
ley died at almost the identical hour
of the dav as did her husband on
Thanksgiving, five years ago.
Mrs. McKinley came of the race of
hardy pioneers who laid the founds'
tion of the American republic. She
was Miss Nancy Campbell Allison and
was born at New Lisbon, O., in 1809.
She was married to William McKinley,
sr., January 6, 1829, and was living in
a two-story frame house, still standing
near Niles, O., when her distinguished
son was born, January 29, 1843. Mrs.
McKinley was frugal, industrious,
pious and proud of her sod.

FEDERATION OF LABOR.
The . Seventeenth Annual Convention I
Held at Nashville, Tenn. President Com
per Tells of the Progress of a Year.
Nashville, Tenn., Dec 14 The Amer-
cap Federation of Labor began its 17th
annual session in this city Monday
with an attendance of more than 100
delegates from different states, and an
equal number of visitors. The federa
tion met in the ball of the house of
representatives at the state capitoL
President Gompers presiding.
Havelock Wilson and Edward Har
ford, delegates from England, were in
troduced by the president Mr. Wilson
is a member of parliament and Mr.
Harford is ex-secretary of the railway
employes' organization. After the
meeting had been called to order, Wil
liam Aimison, of the local Typograph
ical union, delivered an address of ,
1 Ut,l - lnt,nN AWvAn- '
izations of the city, to which President
Gompers responded.
President Gompers then read, his an
nual report He said:
"With two exceptions, all our affili
ated national unions report a large in
crease of local unions and in member
ship There is an increase of about
84,000 in the organizations affiliated.
'It has been the constant aim to or
ganize our fellow workers engaged in
unskilled labor. With .the invention of
new machines and the application of
new forces, the division and sub-division
of Jabor, many workers who have
been employed at skilled trades find
their occupation gone. Thus we see
the artisan of yesterday the unskilled
laborer of to-day. Within this past
year a very large number of federal
labor unions for unskilled workers
have been organized and from them a
much larger number of trade unions.
"There have been a number of strikes
within the past year, but the change
in the causes which have produced
them are worthy of note. The strikes
of this year with few exceptions have
been for hjgher wages, shorter hour
and the extension and reorganization
of union principles. Our organizations
report with gratifying unanimity, the
very large number of successes
achieved, advantages gained and
growth in the power of the organiza
tion enjoyed.
'The movement to reduce the hours
of labor is always one which com
mands the first attention of organized
labor. We hold that no condition is
satisfactory nor any solution complete
which fails to eliminate the curse and
the degrading influences of non-em
ployment and ' so long as this evil
shall be with us our best efforts will
be concentrated to the reduction of
the hours of labor of all until the de
sired end is attained.
"The establishment of a postal sav
ings bank system and' also a postal
telegraph system, long since demanded
by organized labor, seem nearer ac
complishment than at any previous
time.
'It is submitted whether it would
not be wise to modify our position in
60 far as to interpose, no objection to
the passage of a law providing for com
pulsory arbitration in disputes be
tween the organized employes of rail
roads and the railroad companies, and
the giving of an award by such law
ful arbitrators; but we should hesitate
to give our indorsement to any legis
lation, state or national, empowering
the compulsory enforcement of an
award and the specific enforcement of
a contract to labor."
During the year 276 strikes were
officially noticed, involving. 105,407
workers. Of these 189 were won; 81
compromised and 33 lost During the
year 217 charters were issued to na
tional, state, central, local and federal
labor unions. Two charters for state
federations were issued to Ohio and
Missouri. Indications are favorable for
a continuance of the use of labels.
STRUNG THEM UP.
Cnbans Hang Spaniards Who Come to
Them and Ask that the Autonomy
Scheme be Accepted.
Havana, Dec. 14. It is officially an
nounced that the Spanish forces under
the command of Gen. Pando in the
province of Puerto Principe, pursued
Gen. Maximo Gomez so closely that he
was obliged with about 200 men of his
escort to seek refuge in the woods and
mountains.
None of the commissioners sent by
Gen. Pando to different parts of the
island to negotiate with the insurgents
for their acceptance of the autono
mous form of government proposed
by Spain have returned, which seems
to confirm the reports that some o.
them have been hanged by the insur-
gents and others have remained with
the enemy. It is reported that Juan
Delgado, the insurgent leader, hanged
the two commissioners sent to him
with peace propositions.
A dispatch from Madrid says that

THE CUT WILL AFFECT ALU
Redaction of Wages In Fall River Mills I
to Apply Alike to People Drawing Big
Salaries and the Poorest Laborer.
Fall River, Mass., Deo. 14. The man
ufacturers' committee which is con
sidering the proposed cut in the wage
of mill operatives will recommend that
the salaries of the treasurers be re
duced in the same proportion as the
wages of the employes, and each mem
ber of the committee has agreed to
bring about this reduction in the ad
ministrative cost in his own milL The
committee also decided that all over
seers and others not usually included
in cut-downs should come under the
order. .
The price for weaving a cut of print
cloth will be reduced from 18 to lfl
cents, and in departments where the
least pay is received the full cut of 11
per cent will not be made. The com
mittee also agreed that a cut of 10 per
cent was as much as the operatives
could bear.
Notices of the reduction will be
posted in the mill to-day or to-morrow,
but the details of the new sched
ule will not be given out until a day or
two later. If the operatives ask for a
conference the committee will recom
mend that it be granted. The commit
tee is unanimously in favor of includ
ing everybody connected with the
mills in the reduction and also in op
posing a strike in every way possible.
Robert Howard, of Boston, former
secretary of the Spinners' union, says:
'In reading over the names of the
committee of the manufacturers who
are to draft the details of the cut
down and decide how it is to be in
flicted,' I notice seven names of agents
among them whose combined salaries
amount to. 850,000 a year, or nearly
81,000 a week A reduction of 10 per
cent in these salaries would be equiv
alent to a reduction of 125 weavers at
88 a week. ','
LATORRE'S DECREE.,
It Exceeds in Cruelty Anything; that Wey
ler Devised to Exterminate Non-Corn-batants.
Havana, Dec. 14. Don Augustin La-
torre, military commander of the city
of Puerto Principe, has exposed with a
few strokes of his pen the hypocrisy oi
Spain's alleged policy of mildness un
der Gen. Blanca The barbarous de
cree of Latorre exceeds in cruelty any
thing that Weyler devised to extermi
nate non-combatants, women and chil
dren. v
Two hundred families .already have
fled from Nue'vitas panic-stricken.
The decree was believed' at first to be
merely a threat, but a few days ago a
woman was shot in Nuevitas for the
sole crime of leaving her home with
out permission of Latorre, to buy pro
visions for her family, and terror
spread in the city and the general ex
odus 'began. A dcr.en murders have
followed.
Latorre has revoked In his decree all
codes of international law. The foreign
consuls are forbidden to raise their na
tional flags and they dare not harbor
their countrymen who demand protec
tion. The consular agents in Nuevitai
of the United States, England, France
and Germany have written To the con
sul generals of those nations in Ha-
vana, explaining the gravity of the
situation and protesting against La
torre s decree.
The decree prescribes the death pen1
alty for any resident, without distinc
tion of sex or age, who shall leave
home or even stand at the door with
out permission of the authorities.
