An interesting story i read is:
"The Necklace of Truth."
There was once a little girl named
Pearl, who had a bad habit of tell- j
ing untruth.-?. For a long tim her
parents did not know this. At last '
they found that she very often suid .
things that were not true. j
Now at this time there lived
a
wonderful man named Merlin. He
could do such strange things, and
wan so ery wise, that he was called
a vizard.
Merlin was a great lover of truth.
For this reason children who told
untruth- were of'cn brought to him,
so that he might cure them of their
f it.
"Lot us take our child to the won
derful wizard." said Pearl s father.
And the mother said. "Yes. let us
take her to Merlin. He will cure !
her!" .o pearl's parents went to
the glass ,aiace where Merlin lived.
When they reached Merlin's palaco
the wise old man said: "I know
very well what is the matter with j
your child; she does not love the
truth."
Poor Pearl hung her head with
shame and fear. Put Merlin said:
"Vo not be afraid, I am only going
to make you a present."
Then the wizard opened a drawer
and took from it a lovely necklace
with a diamond clasp. This he put
on Pearl's neck, and told her pa
rents to go home happy, for tho lit
tle jrirl would Foon be cured.
As they were solnsr away. Merlin
looked at Pearl and raid: In a
vear from now I shall come for my
necklace. Till then you must not
dare to take it off."
The next day Pearl went to ?chool.
"When her schoolmates saw it, they
crowded around her.
"Oh. what a lovely necklace!
Where did you get it. Pearl?"
"My father gave it to me for a
Christmas present." said Pearl.
"Oh. look, look!" cried the chil
dren, "the diamond has turned
dim.:
Pearl looked down at her neck
Uce and saw that the lovely clasp
was tunica to coarse glass. Then
she was very much afraid and sail:
"I will tell you tue truth. The
Wizard Merlin gave it to me."
At once the diamond

was as '
The children now began to laugh
because they knew that only chil
dren who told falsehoods were sent
to Merlin.
"You need net laugh," said Pearl.
"Merlin sent a lovely coach to bring
us. It was drawn by six white
horse, and was lined with s.uln."
h"he stopped, for all the children
were lauchlng acrain. Then she
looked at her necklace. It hung !

SECOND PRIZE.
Ry I-cvi Llml, Franklin School.
One of the most interesting stor
ies I have read is. "A Tale of Two
Cities," by Charles Dickens, a prom
inent English author. It is an epi
sode of the French Revolution. It
is also about two lovers. The scenes
are laid in those two cosmopolitan
cities, Paris and London. The time
is in the ISth century,
The foundation of the s
story is the
French revolution. that historic
event, when the hunger-maddened
French peasants rose in rebellion
against the aristocracy. They first
stormed the Pastile, a fortress, also
a prison and easily conquered the
small garrison.
S'uon many rich nobles were ex
ecuted by means of the guillotine.
Louis, the XIV, was also executed by
the same means.
Put the revolution is not all. A
rich French nobleman, the hero of
the story, is in love with a young
rnL,Ii:sh girj
In the reign of terror, as the lat
ter part of the revolution was call
ed, her lover is sent to prison by
the rebels, condemned to die. The
girl is frantic
A young English
friend of the nobleman, named
Carlton, resolves to save the young
nobleman. One point in his favor is
that he is the exact counterpart of
the nobleman. ' o he goes to the
prison where the young lover is con
fined, contrives to get in, and sent
the lover away a's himself. He stays
! in place of the lover.
On the morrow he is lear, out to
the guillotine, where he meets his
death bravely.
It is a story everyone should read
It Js, a cias5jC. Much credit is due
its author for giving to the
such a piece of literature.

THIRD PRIZE.
By Anna R. Pinter, Kaley School.
IThe most interesting story I ever
read was about the Teutons and the
j Romans. I like it because it tells
t how brave the Romans were at first.
; Put after a while they had their
; slaves and became lazy. I think
that if people would read the story
about the Romans it would teach
them to do their own work.
If you have read their story you
know what became of them after
they began to use slaves. I will tell
',M A V,l11 f it
They became lazy and when the!
Parbarians began to make war
aK;lin5t them they were unwilling to
fight. Some of them cut off their
fmgers so they would not have to
tight. They hired the Germans or
Teutons to fight for them. They
had to pay them, of course. So to
get the money they taxed the peo
ple. The Teutons fought for them,
but they tricked the Romans by
sending messages to their kinsmen,
telling them how they could win the
war.
If a country does not do its work
it win become lazy like the Roman.,
re destroyed by enemies.
