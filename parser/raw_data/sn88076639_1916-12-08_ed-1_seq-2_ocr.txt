Legislation on Thai? Line la
8trongly Recommended—Bill Giv
ing Foreign Commerce Promo
ters Free Hand Necessary.
Washington, Dec. 5.—President Wil
son today delivered his message to
both houses of congress in Joint ses
sion. The address was as follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution of com
municating to you from time to time
information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legislative measures as may
be Judged necessary and expedient I
shall continue the: practice,' which 'I
hope has been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
heads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which it seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible but there
were some things left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which it seems
necessary in the Interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, it seems to me Im
peratively necessary that thfe earjiest
possible consideration and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of. the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you at the close
of your last session in view of the pub
lic dangers 'disclosed by the unaccom
modated difficulties which then existed,
and which still unhappily continm to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,'
conductors, and trainmen.
Railway Troubles First |7
I then recommended: 7'^
First, immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
in the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate In order that the
«immIsslon may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon it ^rith a prompt
ness and thoroughness Which are, with
Its present .constitution and means of
action, practically Impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis aiike
of work and of wages In the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in Interstate transporta
tion.
Third, the authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
bod of men to observe the actual re
sults in experience of the adoption of
the eight-hour day in railway trans
portation alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by thfc in
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoptldn of the eight
how, day and which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the tacts dis
closed justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that, in case
the methods of accommodation now
provided, for should fall, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
sueh dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And, sixth, the lodgment in the
hands of the executive of the power,
in case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military service of the United
States such train crews and-adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews His Recommendationa.
The second and third of these rec
ommendations the congress Immediate
ly acted On: it established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages in train service and It au
thorized the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed
but it postponed action upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them- The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem it neces
sary to renew. The power of the in
terstate commerce commission to grant
an increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of the com
mission's authority or Its inclination to
Largest Peanut Fields.
•the largest peanut fields in the
world are In Guinea, on the west
coast of Africa, where peanuts are
grown by hundreds of tons. Most of
the African peanuts are shipped to
France.
No Ambulancea in London.
London still clings to a very old cus
tom in case of an accident. The victim
is carried away to the hospital on a
kind of stretcher on two wheels. No
ambulances are used.
When qotd Bath la Beneficial.
Cold bathing is of great value in dis
eases other than fever. In nervous
affections, especially the functional
conditions, as hysteria, St Vitus' dance
or bysterlo-epllepsy (petit mal), a cold
tub is a regular ne plus ultra of a
curative agent—especially when fol
lowed by a brisk, blood-whipping rub
with a course towel.
Agreeable Friends.
Animals are such agreeable friends
—they ask no questions, they pass no
:rlticisms.—George Eliot.
do Justice when there Is no reasoh to
doubt either. 7
The other suggestions—the increase
in the Interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing its manifold duties, th£
provision for full public investigation
and assessment of Industrial disputes,
and the grant to the executive of the
power to control and operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity—I now
very earnestly renew.
*The necessity for such legislation is
manifest and pressing. Those who have
intrusted us with the responsibility
and duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would find it
hard, .1 believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
unnecessary postponement of action
upon them.
Not only does the Interstate com
merce commission now find it practi
cally impossible, with Its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but it is not unlikely that it
may presently be found advisable to
add to Its duties still others equally
heavy and exacting. It must, first be
perfected as an administrative instru
ment.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound industrial disturbances for
lack of additional means of arbitra
tion and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly supply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of the execu
tive to make Immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues its own case in the mere,
statement of it. With regard to one
of its items, the increase in the, effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already acted Its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, and
I dare say the congress would hesitate
to act upon the suggestion should I
makegit, that any man In any occupa
tion Should be obliged by law. to C9n
tlnue In an employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society In do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple into our Jurisprudence which I
take it for granted we are not prepared
to Introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganlzed bodies of men untU a public
Investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the Judgment of the
opinion of the nation is not to propose
any such principle. It Is based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes, of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
an opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
sider all practicable means of concilia
tion or arbitration.
I can see nothing In that proposition
but the Justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety of the necessary processes of
its very life. There if shilling'arbi
trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
ahould be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests and liber
ties of all concerned as well as for toe
permanent Interests of society. Itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital importance
await the action of the senate which
have already been acted upon by the
house of representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country than is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the laws
against monopoly the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough mid systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money In elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act
I need dot labor my advice that these
measures be enacted into law. Their
urgency lies in the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. EVen delay would seriously
Jeopard the Interests of the country
and of the government
Immediate passage of the'blll to reg
ulate the expenditure of money iQ elec
tions may seem to be less necessaty
than the immediate enactment of the
other measures to which It refer be
cause at least two years will elapse
before another election in which fed
eral offices are to be filled but It would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of.
expenditure can be frankly studied in
the light of present experience and a
delay would have the further very se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
and some special object connected with
It might be thought to be in the mind
of those who urged" it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion of partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving'a freer hand In the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will

Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico Is brief and conclusive. The
present laws, governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
its people are not just- We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the Island and even a suspicious
doubt with regard to our intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do In any essential particular. We
ought to do It at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two bouses of which it Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
.and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, 1
hope that .you will permit me to say
with what genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive pol
icy with which you have' enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege to labor in such
company. I take tlfe liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare servlceableness and

The well-dressed stranger stepped
into the drug store and, passing by
the boy who usually attended to casual
customers, approached the proprietor,
who was arranging some goods in the
show case.
••Mr. I presume?" he re
marked, pleasantly, and the druggist
turned and bowed gravely. "I have
heard my friend, Mr. Quorn, speak of
you often," said the brisk man. "He
told me If ever I needed anything In
this line to come to you. He spoke of
you as a man on whoih one could rely
with perfect confidence, who had only
the best of evrythlng and with whom
it was always a pleasure to deal."
"Mr. Quorn is very kind," answered
the other, beaming with gratification.
"He is one of by best customers. What
can I do for you this morning?"
"Well—er—this morning, as It .hap
pens," said the stranger, with just a
little briskness, "this morning I Should
like, If you will allow me, to consult
your directory."
"Certainly," was the Calm reply, "we
also have a good selection of one and
two-cent stamps as well as railway
time tables, if you ne£d anything of
that kind.?

Fall Plowing Completed— Germinat
ing Qualities of Seeds Found High.

the north end that were hit by an
unusually early snowfall, are back
ward In the matter of fall plowing.
Seed tests conducted by Professor
H. L. Bolley at the North Dakota
Agricultural college, have Indicated
that the seed wheat, despite the fact
that much of It ia shriveled, possess
es higher germinating qualities than
might be anticipated. Theae tests are
made by Mr. Bolley as state pure seed
commissioner, and the expense Is paid
by the state.

more shallow than ordinarily, be
cause of ihe.lesser germinating pow
er. This will give the sprouts easier
access to the surface, and Insure btt
ter growth.
