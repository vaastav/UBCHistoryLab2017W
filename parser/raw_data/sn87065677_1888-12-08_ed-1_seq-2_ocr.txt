fact and incidents of Vlinister West's

,. lho most important feature of the
message is his treatment; of the
THrift question,' and in connection
therewith "Tiustsj Monopol'es and
other aggregations of capital which
have been built up by taxes taken
from the people indirectly for the
benefit of the few.
., We. cannot do better than give
I short extracts from the message as
indicative of the- general treatment
of these subjects. Premising, ' that
this treatment is at once compre
hensive, laid upon broad lines, speci
fic, and aggressive, and fhat the
President reinforces his former po
sition with positiveness and great
ability ; and that the echoes of these
and other brave nnd patriotic words of
the rething President will sound
alpng the line whereon the many are
contending with the organized and
powerful few for years to come.
To the Congress of the United
States: As yon assemble fot the
discharge of ihe duties you have as
sumed as the representatives of a
free and generous people, your meet

is not sufficient to assure us that we
no longer have danger to fear in the
maintenance, with all its promised
blessing, of a government founded
upon the freedom of the people. The
time rather admonishes us to soberly
inquire w hether in the past we have
alwajs closely kept in the course of
safety, and whether we have before
us a way plain and clear which leads
to happiness and perpetuity.
When the experiment of onr gov
crment was undei taken,' the chert
adopted for our guidance was the
constitution. Depaituie fiom the
lines there laid down is failuv . It is
only by a strict- adherence to the
direction they indicate, and by res
traint within the limitations they
lix, that we can furnish proof to the
world of ihe fitness of the American
people for self-government. The
equal justice of which we boast as
the underlying principle of our in
tituUons should not be confined to
the relations of our citizens to each
other.
THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF.
is under bond to the Ameiican people
that in the exercise of its functions
and powers it will deal with the
body of our citizens in a manner
scrupulously honest aud fair and ab
solutely just. It has agieed that
American citizenship shall be the
only credential necessary lo justify
the claim of equality before the law,
and that no coudition in life shall
give lise to discrimination in the
treatment of the people by their
govemmen. The citizen of our
Republic in its early days ligidly
insisted upon full compliance with
the letter of this bond, and saw
stietching out before him a clear
Held of individual endeavor. His
tribute to the support of his govern
mcnt was measured by the (ostof us
economical maintaix ACE j tt8K tne nenate to proceed with that
and he wns secure in the enjoyment j ""amess on Tuesday. Chandler de
of the remaining recompense of his j shed io give noi.'ee lhat as soon as prac

those days the frugality of the
people was stamped upon their gov
ernment, and was enforced by the
free thoughtful intelligent suffrage
of the citizen. Combinations, mo
nopolies and aggregations of capital
I were either avoided or sternly regu
i late 1 and restrained. The pomp and

The farmer's sons, not
Satisfied
with his father's simple and labori
ous life, joins the eager chase for
easily acquired wealth. We discover
that the fortunes realized by our
manufacturers are no longer solely
the reward of honest industry and
elightened foresight, but that they
result from the discriminating favor
of the government, and are largely
built upon undue exactions from the
masses of onr people. The gulf be
tween employers and the employed
ii constantly widening, and classes
are rapidly forming, one comprising
the very rich and powerful, while in
anothei are found
THE toilinu POOR.

are re'ated to, if they ttrc not respon

may be expected to le'ieve with

rpon the slightest pretext of pro

nied that there is a growing assump
tion that, as against the govern

and interests, ti e usual rules aud
limitations of business principles just

- THESE IDEAS
have been unhappily much encour
aged by legislative acquiescence.
The last session of the 50th Con
gress met on Monday The Senate,
after the reception of the Presidents
message, referred to the unfinished
business, which was the Tariff bill.

tion to investigate the election in Louis

he suspected that there would be no
objection. Mr. Gibsoji, said he had
strenuously objected to the consider
ation of that resolution and would
continue to lo so.

Gentlemen: ' .
In answer to yours of the 30th
ult. I have to say that I am surpris
ed at the report mentioned by you,
and must attribute its circulation to
willful malice, as it has no founda
tion in fact. So far from supporting
this Bill I introduced II. B. No $22
ia opposition : to it and , urged , its
passage ia a speech, but it was de
feated. This I think was due to the
confusion usual just before adjourn
ment, nnd to the fact (hat the other
i
bill was reported by the V ays and
Means Committee,- had its powerful
support; and was not properly con
sidered by the House. I never did
believe . that the Legislature could
equalize assessments of property and
give satisfaction. '" But on the con
trary, my idea is that every man's
property should be , assessed at 'tis
rnvn mlw, without regsird to his
neighbor's and my bill was aimed in
this direction, and designed to se
cure the just assessment of the
property of all tax-payers, aud thus
'qualiz th burden of taxation.
I have the bill I offered, now in
my possession; and have also letters
from members of the
House, receiv
ed since my return commending ' it
and regretting its failnre to pass, i
The bill that did puss is copied
from a law of 1840, and after one
assessment was . made under it,; it
was repealed w ithout a dessenting
vote, and 1 predict a similar fate for
the present law.
Yours Respectfully.

Convicts and Ship Island It. It.
It is staled that Col. Hardy has
ceased ork on the Gulf & Ship
Island road for the present. The
management, seems unable to pro
ceed for want of funds. A county
on the line refused to aid the road
which Appeared to be the immediate
cause of slopping the work and is
likely to cause the return of the
State's elephant the convicts to
the original owner.
From a private letter we have
another version, which we give for
what it is worth. , It is to the effect,
that the Board of Control has can
celled Die lease of convicts to the G.
& S 1. road on account of persistent
ill-treatment of convicts. . If the
letter is correct the Board of Control
begin to show some justification for
its creation.
