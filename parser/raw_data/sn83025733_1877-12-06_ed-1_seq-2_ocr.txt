M. Dk ltoTHi:iiii., the Croesus of the
world, has been robbed by hi stoward
of one million and eight hundred thou
Hund francs, after which ho left tor parts
unknown. Wo sympathise with poor
Ilotchchild in his great loss, lie is not
quite wrecked however.
Pabsoh Pattkrson, who was in the
eyes of tho republicans a few weoks
ago tho very personification of all that
was honorable, has since his voting to
seat Butler, lost their good opinion,
and now they have discovered all of a
suddon that lie is a consumate scoun
drel.
The tramps are moving upon the
southern states three hundred thousand
strong. They, like thoir more fashion.
able fellowicreatures, are coming south
to winter. The advance guard has al
ready arrived in Texas, and it behooves
her to tind some means of utilizing or
forcing them off. -
Conohehhman Knott of Kentttcl-, in
troduced a bill for the relief of the buis
vivors of the steamship Huron and the

mnce uio recent Kusaian successes,
England has been taking a greater in
teresl in tho eastern war. It is said
that Disraeli on the part of the British
government, has given notice that ho
will not permit the armies of the rzar
to ocoupy Constantinople. It may yet
turn out to be a general European war.
Tuk San Antonio Herald savs: ",For
nando Wood introduced a bill the other
day, authorizing anybody to establish
gas works in the District ot Columbia.
We can't Bee what need thero can bo of
any such enterprise though, with
a prospect of congress sitting for six
to come. ,
Unfortunately the gass is too mean
to be utalized.
It Is true that the recent rains have
caused a slight regularity in the punc
tual arrival of trains, yet not enough to
warrant the irregularity of tho mails
and especially the paper mails, being
laid to that source. It is either the
mail agent or the postmastort fault,
and should be looked into at once, as
it causes unnecessary and great incon
venionce to the public.
Ova farmers who buy tine stock
should be particular in their manago
mont. They should not be exposed to
inclement weather, no matter how mild
the season.' Good food and shelter are
necessary.. The lack of these was what
originated th Talse idea that superior
breeds, especially cattle, would not do
well here. It has been proven, bow
ever, that where they receive proper
care they do as well as in any state in
the union. '
A at hi; a sensational report is going
the rounds of the Texas aa well as the
eattero papers, of a St. Louis drummer

THE PEACE ATTITUDE OH THE RIO

ty, An a iiiritnuru of revenge we don't
beliove lit it, but as u means to secure
Indemnity for losses sufdaini'il at the
hands of an enemy it Is not only jusii
liable hut becomes a pressing and iiui
mediate necessity, as well as duty.
Some of the great papers of the country
took us severely to tank for speaking
out for our remedy, Since that time
two eminent and patriotic men from
Texmlii the senate of the United Slates
ond six in the lower house have placed
before tho country a modnrato but
truthful statement of the wrongs suf
fered by our patient borderers, and have
awakened the sympathy of tho govern
ment and tho people for us.
During the reign of bitter sectional
ism and prejudice, which stretched be
tween tho periods when tho war closed
and when Hayes was Inaugurated, all
the vital facts regarding the Mexican
outrages on tho Kiodrundo were sidu
ously kept from the knowledge of the
people. Iiidilference was the rule.
Even the brave and devoted army made
strong representations to the executive,
and they woro treated with icorn or
indiUbrcuco. It was no part of tho
policy of the president to rudely inter
rupt tho processes by which ho was be-
ing lifted from poverty to power and
wealth, and bring into favorable notice
the people from whoso necessities mon
ey was wrung, and upon whose defeat
and humiliation his own and his com
peers' glory rested.
A short time siuco it was announced
that tho Mexicuu government had sent
heavy force of troops to the Kio
(Iramlo frontier in tho interest! of peace.
Now wo aro told that our government
has ordered strouir reinforcements to
our Jtio (iramlo iron nor also in tne
intercuts of peace. Men on peacoful mis
sions do not take guns in their hands;
but when war is meant they do. If our
government means to repel force by
force, it is surely strong enough to say
so, and stand by the declaration. This
heating about tho bush is unworthy a
great nation confronting a neighbor,
and benides it has no present good
ellVct upon our relations with Mexico,
What wo of tho Texas frontier need is
immediate protection and relief. Let the
government send a force there strong
enough to repel any force the Mexicans
can bring against it, and boldly declare
its purposes, and from that moment the
outrages will coaso.
However, ,tho simple announcement
that reinforcements are going forward,
and the formal notice given the subject
by tho president in his annual message,
are both vast improvements over the
old executive plans regarding the Rio
Orande irritations, and wo beliove pre-
sugo an entiro and radical chango of
policy. In this view of tho case we can
afford to await future developments,
and with some confidence that justice
will at last overtake the greaser thieves
who have eked out a wretched exist
ence in the Zona Libre, by thespolas
tion of the citizens on this sido of tho
Rio Grande. ,
The nation, the people, and above all,
Texas, will applaud the manly attitudo
taken by President Hayes.
