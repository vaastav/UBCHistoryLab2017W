59TH CONGRESS
NO UNUSUAL INCIDENS-WEATH.
ER PERFECT.
CANNON RE-ELECTED SPEAKER.
Formality of Drawing Seats Gone
Through-Minority Leader Wil
liams Made a Speech.
Washington, Dec. 5.--The assem
blage yesterday of the members of
the Fifty-Ninth Congress for their first
session was marked by no unusual in
cldents, but It attracted to the capitol
crowds of spectators who took a live
ly interest in the proceedings.
The day was perfect. The sun
shone brightly and the air was keen.
Society was out in force and reserve
galleries were filled, while visitors,
unable to find seats., roamed the cor
ridors to catch good glimpses of pub
lie men.
One noticeable feature was the ab
sence of flowers, w-hich had been com
mon to the chambers. The absence of
floral tributes was due to a resolution
adopted unanimously by the Senate
and by the order of the Speaker of
the House, and robbed the occasio'i
of much of its picturesqueness.
The only coloring given to the cham
bers yesterday was that of tne gal
leries, where thundreds of handsomely
gowned women gave a splendor to
the event that made it the beginning
of the Congressional social season.
Senators Allison and Morgan were
appointed by Vice President Fairbanks
to notify the President that Congress
was ready for an communication he
desired to make.
The Senate was in session only
twenty minutes. Senators Aldrich,
Knox, Warner and Frazier took the
oath of office and an adjournment
was taken as a mark of respect to the
late Senator Platt of Connecticut.
The preliminary steps to organize
were taken by the House. .loseph
Cannon of Illinois was re-elected as
Speaker, the members of the house
took oath of office and the floor em
ployes of both were re-elected; the
rules of the last Congress were adopt
ed and members went through the
formality of drawing for seats, all of
which was enlivened by the presence
of the crowds in the galleries, t'lhean
imation of the reunion of veteran
members and the interest of new
ones.
In a brief speech against the adop
tion of the rules, the minority lead
er, Mr. Williams of Mississippi, touch
ed upon the interest of tariff legisla
tion and told of the new Republican
"ideas" which were being wafted to
Washington on breezes from every
part of the country. These, he said,
might be properly legislated for should
the "minority of the majority stand
with the Democratic mem'bers in op.
posing the adoption of the old rules
and forming new ones, which permit
consideration of such legislation as
popular opinion might dictate."
Mr. Williams was asked by the
youngest member of the House, Mr.
Wharton of Illinois, for an explana
tron of what he had meant by the word
"kids" in asking for support in op
position to the rule from the new Re
publican members. The retort was
instantaneous and caused a burst of
laughter at the young member's ex
pense. "With that degree of reverence
which tihe personal appearance of my
interrogator excites in my mind, I
should say he would be the last mem
ber of this House to ask that ques
tion," said Mr. Williams.
A committee was appointed to act
with the Senate committee on notify
ing President Roosevelt that Con
gress was ready to transact business.
The rules committee and the commit
tee of mileage were appointed, and the
House adjourned after a session that
lasted three and a ihalf hours, in com
pliance with resolutions on the death
of Senator Platt of Connecticut and
Representative Marshall of Illinois.

made an extended excusion along the
route of the proposed waterway. lie

the project, and has a bill prepared
which will be offered in the House
immediately. lie declares that digging
such a channel would create a new

proposes to make in favor of the pas
sage of his bill.

St. Petersburg, Dec. 3.-Intense
alarm prevails here. Communication
with the outside world by telegraph
ceased yesterday morning when the
Finnish operators joined their Russian
brothers. The Embassies, Legations
and banks are organizing private po
lice services to guard themselves.

of panic, fearing that the police will
fail them and join the stiikers.

m'en may join the strikers.
Stories that the guards of the im
perial regiments are in open revolt
cannot be confirmed.
Yesterday morning newsboys were
openly hawking red-lined sheets head
ed "Down With Monarchy and Autoc

The Associated Press has learned
from a high authority that the situa
tion in the Baltic has grown grave and
that the troops at Reval and in the
neighborhood are in open mutiny. This
was the real cause of tl::e Cabinet
meeting which was 'held at Petershoff
yesterday morning.
According to reports., the troops are
regarded by the Government as the
most dangerous factor that has thus
far developed. A strike of the police
men and firemen of St. Petersburg
is scheduled to take place immediately.
Count Witte continues to refuse to
deal with the strikers, and declares
that the Government would deal with
them as individuals and not as a body.
Instructions are being sent the gov
erns an the local authorities with great
dificulty over the teleghaph lines.
Brokers Held up Bonds.
St. Petersburg: A quieter tone pre
vailed on the bourse yesterday, brok
ers helping to stay the panic by tak
ing all of the Imperial 4s at 78, yes
terdays close. The Government tried
to dispel the gloomy feeling on the
bourse by assurances that the removal
of martial law in Poland would help
the situation.
At the war department it was de*
clared that the outbreak of troops in
the Baltic provinces were confined to
reserves who were insisting on dis
charge. The officials refused their
demands.
Arizona Wrought Up.
Washington: The people of Arizano
who are opposed to joint statehood
with New Mexico are rather wrought

zona and New Mexico as one state and
Oklahoma and Indian Territory as an
other.
Protection for Meyer.
Washington: It is said here that a
number of marines from the gunboat

city crop, and w'hat old cotton may
have been carried over from last year.
He declares cotton wili go to 15 cents
and adds. "I contend that prices are
only relative, and that the world to
day is bet ter abl!- to buy goods made of
15 cent cotton thae it .,s a few years
ago goods made of i and S cent cot
ton. The planters of the South can
market the balance of this crop on an
average of 15 cents if they stand to
gether.
"My investigation shows that we
have practically a crop disaster la
Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and
three-fourths of Texas and Indian Ter
ritory. Oklahoma, Tennessee and Ala

though yield in those states is very
light. Georgia, the Carolinas and Flor

of the situation. Last night a special
train was run from Wichita and a
posse tried to dislodge her from her
private car, but without avail.
There has been no fire in the car
since it was sidetracked here, but this
does not seem to worry Mrs. Berny,

points her revolver and rifle at the
first head she sees. She carries provi
sions for a siege of two or three days.

St. Johns, N. F.: Three of ten
