WEDXEMItAY, DECEMBER 7, 1*70.
Thb two Governors of Alabama still
go through the motions." Each of
them sent a message to th*" Legislature
the other day. The Senate won't act
upon Lixdsay's 'and the House will
have nothing to do with Smith's, and j
no it goes. The President did not say
anything about it iu his message to
Congrep, though it properly comes un
der the head of "operations of the
army." ? j
Tub friends of Secretary Cox, who
was turned oat of the Cabinet for in
augurating and persistently adhering to
a plan of reform ia his branch, of the
civil service, will be no little anms?d
by the President s assumption of zeftl
in that direction. He is a new convert
and must be put upon probation. A
\ery good way of demonstrating his
earnestness and sincerity in the cause
would be the dispensing with the ser
vices of some of the numerous retinue
of Dents and wite's cousins who are
pensioned upon the people.
Some idea of the dreadful carnage of
the late civil war luay be inferred lroni
the fact stated officially that the bodies
of .'>12," 15 dead soldiers have been col
lected and interred at national expense.
In addition to th(*e there are many'
thousands whose bodies were taken
home and buried by their families, and
.probably thousands more whose names
swelled the list of the "missing" after
the battle. It is scarcely an extrava
gant estimate which places uj?on the |
muster roll of the Federal dead 500,000
men. IIow much can be said for the
generalship of the leader who lost more
soldiers than his enemy commanded ?
The carpet-baggers and negro major
ity in the Late Georgia Legislature
passed an act fixing the pay of mem
bers of the Legislature at nine dollars a
?lay. The President of the Senate and
Speaker of the House have twelve dol
lar They have mileage, live dollars
for every twenty miles This is one of
the many ways in which the people of
1 he south have been robbed under the
reconstruction acts. The per diem of
members in the Northern States is from
three to five dollars. ? ('?n^nnaii En
quirer.
But then the Enquirer should remem
ber that the wear and tear of conscience
necessarily incurred by a Radical mem
ber of the late Georgia Legislature must
be compensated for, and it should not
torget the exhaustive qualify of the le
gislation performed. You can't expect
to get such enactments as the Georgia
election law lor the beeararlv pittance of
three dollars per day.
The President nay* "the people of
San Domingo are not capable of main
raining themselves in their present con
dition and must look tor outside sup
port."' At the same time he portrays
in glowing colors the salubrity of the
cliiuate, the fertility of the so:l, and the
immense commercial advantages of the
location. If, under all these favorable
circumstances, the people of San Do
mingo cannot sustain themselves and
must look for outside support, what
does the United States want to do with
-uch a race of paupers and parasites ?
Have we not already a good sized ele
phant on our hands to provide for in
feeding the hungry blacks ? Is there to
be another "Bureau " constructed ? If
so, some more skillful cabinet maker
than President Grant should be em
ployed to do the job. This JSan Domin
go business is too much of a "job for
him
The FiNhcrio*.
We hardly know whether to thank
Mr. Butler or Mr. Grant for the in
formation given in the President's mes
sage concerning the wretched state nnd
miserable condition to which the Ameri
can people have been reduced by the
bloody -minded inhabitants of the Do
minion of Canada. Our people never
knew before the delivery of Mr. But
ler's speech at Eo.-ton and the publi
cation of the President's message, how
sadly they have been abused by these
same Cannucks ami how atrociously
we have' been deprived of our cod ti-h
We never had a realizing sense of our
misery and were utterly unacquainted
with the depths of wictchedness into
which we had been plunged by the
"blue noses on our northern border.
The newspapers (ailed to inform us
from time to time how our coat-tails
had been trodden upon, and how indig
nant we ought to be. We have heard
something of "the Oyster War which
has recently raged between Maryland
and Virginia, and have seen a few para
graphs about "a Duck War'' between
the same high contending parties, but
never, until Bcti.er and Grant informed
us, did we hear of "the Cod-fish War''
which is to summon the nation to arms.
We wonder if it is not just barely
possible that there may be two sides to
the fishery question, to which President
Grant devotes so much of his message
to Congress and concerning which his
language is rather more tart than is
usually employed in State paper*. Is
there not softie possibility that the |
V ankee skippers of those fishing smacks
that have been Beized by the Canadian
Government may have shrewdly "lost
their reckoning" and gone toe e?06e to
the Canadian shore, thus violating the
treaty and becoming trespassers them
selves. Knowing as the people df the
United States generally do. how prone
the average New England man is to re- '
g&rd everything as fish that comes into
his net, the suspicion will arise that the !
'hardy fisnerwen" of whom the fresi- 1
deot speaks, may not have been quite
at careful at they might have been in
calculating tbe three leagues from abort
beyond which it was. lawful for them to
entice the sportive cod.
About fifty year* *go, tbe fisheries
were the bane of the Americaa people.
There was more time consumed and
eloquence wasted over the matter than ,
all the cod fish iu the Atlantic ocean ,
are worth. They came near bringing ;
about a war then, but a tre.ity was
finally agreed upon, and the people de
voutly hoped they had reached the end >
ol" tbe business. Those who have read i
the history of those times or glanced ?
over the voluminous mass of "debates
in Congress" relating to the fisheries, |
will view with dismay the resurrection ;
of the buried controversy. If it be1
found that some of the fishermen haw .
lost their little smacks by tres- j
passing in Canadian waters, let J
a national subscription be taken i
up to pay them off, and let j
us get rid of the matter as quickly lie I
j>ossible. If we could only pay the
Canad:an8 enough to induce them to
capture and keep Bitler we would :
save money by the operation, and we j
wouldn't mind paying a few cents extra .
if they would also take charge of
Grant. The organization, equipment '
and transportatiun of ten thousand
soldiers, or one day of war, or one,
week of non intercourse with Canada,
would cost the United States more thun
the value of all the tithing boats de
stroyed, and more than would atone tor
any insult to our national honor which
has yet been received.
General Aiunenty.
We have looked in vain through the
President's message to Congress for
that recommendation of universal am
i uesty which was so confidently predict
i ed by the Washington correspondents.
I The removal of political disabilities
from thousands of the people is not
once alluded to, and he even fails to
congratulate the nation upon the fact
that, in West Virginia and Missouri,
the people have decided against pro
scription and are about to inaugurate
pence. Possibly the recollection of
! souie iittle interference of his own in
Missouri may not he very pleasant, and
lie has not had time to see Senator
I ScaiRZ anl set the intended recom
mendation of amnesty properly fixed.
I up.
But, it matters little what the Presi*
dent may or may not recommend, or
what the Congress may do or omit to
(Jo in relation to political amnesty and
the return of harmony and good feeling
between those estranged by the war.
; There is a mightier power than the
i President or the Cong re- s at work for
i pacification 'l'he people are tired of
I dissensions and divisions rtbich cripple
their prosperity and embitter their lives,
and they are moving together of their
own accord. The sober second thought
of all sensible men is averse to proscrip
tion, persecution and eternal hate: and
j it matters not how anxious politicians
; may be to perpetuate discord, for selfish
: ends and the gratification of private pur
poses, the people w ill not approve it any
longer. Notwithstanding it hns not
been recommended by the President, an
act of Congress relieving all persons
from |K>Iitioal disabilities incurred dur
ing the war would cause almost uni
versal gratification

"Have you heard the election news?'
i said a proscribed Conservative the other
I day to a venomous Kadical. "Yes,1
I wan the reply. "I learn things have
i taken an oncommon turn 1" "But,"
he continued, "lor my part 1 never was
in favor of diefrancliisin' people!"
"lTow have you voted?' inquired our
friend. "Oh, I always voted the Kadi
I cal ticket, hut 1 ani mightily opposed
to disfranchisin' ; I think all ought to
' vote, and I am aguine for that now!"
j "Ah ! you are too late, my Radical
j Iriend ; we don't need you now !"
"How are you, Mr. A- ?" said an
' other of the proscribed to another Rad
j ical bequet. "The Democratic-Con
servative party has laid you Radicals
out as cold as clay' "Yes, I hear
there has been a most wonderful turn,"
replied the Kad , "but 1 was never very
streenous; 1 always was for allow in' all
to vote; never was streenous ? never
was streenous!''
"Don t look so sad, said another to
i oi, e well-known as a very "streenous
Radical: "We are now in power, and
we intend to allow all the privileges
yon allowed us. The Rad's counte
nenee grew still sadder as he said :
| "Theu you won't allow us to vote any
, more!' "Well, you could not complain j
ot that, could you? Wouldn't that be
giving you your own medicine? Ha
? man was hung on the gallows he erect
ed for Mordecai, the dew, and God and
[ and man approved it as a righteous ret
i ribution.'
"W-e-s! W-e-e-1, I suppose it was
I right 1 and the Kad drew a breath all
the way from the soles of his boots.
"But, sir, continued our friend, "1 i
made a mistaKe. If we were to treat '
you as meanly as you have treated ua.1
we would thereby prove as mean as you ?
have been. We won't do that We
will allow you all the privileges that we
enjoy ourselves ? no less, no more, j
j How will that do?"
"That," replied the Radical, his
countenance brightening; "That will'
bejnetis; and 1 see now that that is,
w hat we ought to have done. I'm in 1
favor of eich as that !"

j To the Editor of the Whig :
Dear Sir: ? We are large holders oft
? the coupon six per cent bonds of the j
j State of Virginia. Nothing has been i
uiore unexpected than the delav of Vir- [
ginia to provide for the payment of in
terest. It is within her means, and
surely for her prosperity. If Virginia
shon id show her readiness to act, j
and would aot, by carrying into ef- ,
feet the funding measures recommended j
by Governor Walker, she would soon
find her reward, not only in a sens? of1
i honorable action, but in the immediate i
advantage to all her material J
interests. With regular pay- j
ments resumed, the old -interest

funded and the necessary legit-la
tion to secure Confidence, very sabn the
flnaneei of the State would be so re
stored that, if tome assistance should
be required to accomplish needed finan
cial objects, no difficulty would arise in
negotiating a loan upon very reasonable
terms in this market. The writer
would not be afraid to guarantee assis
tance to be rendered within on? year
from the proper resumption of pay
ments by Virginia. Such askance
could be" had here on the conditions'
named : but what can Virginia expect
if she still continues to defer so simple
a taealure Qf justice as the payment of
interest upon money borrowed on her
plighted faith ? The writer, never hav
ing doubted theyooe/ faith of Virginia,
only wonders the more at her unac
countable delay. J. B. S. A* V<r.
Another Accident.
A few days ago a fearful as well as
painful accident befel Mr. J. L. Crane, 1
son of Mr. W. H. H. Crane, who lives
in the Meadows in Greenbrier county,
it seems that the young man was out '
deer driving, and whilst standing on a
log- he attempted to change the position
of his gun, and in the act of doing so
the hammer struck against the log,
bursting the cap, thereby causing an ex
plosion. The contents passed partially
through his thigh, making a fearful
hole, but, forttiuafely, none of the lead
ing arteries were touched. Several
buckshot, with which the gun was
loaded, also took effect in one of hid
arm ? Independent.
Palatal Accident.
A small child of Mr. Matthew Hum
phreys, who lives near Edgar's Mill, in
Greenbrier county, fell in tiie tire a few
days ago, and fearfully burned its hands
and arms l>efore it could be rescued. ?

Important to Pulmonary Pa
tients.
To give relief to Pulmonary Consumption
is oftentimes all that it sought for lit the ad
ministration of remedies. We know of ex
treme cases that have been cured? cures are
not common, however, and perhaps for the
reason that few persons believe in its cura
bility, and allow their lungs to be consumed
in a fatal misapprehension. That far gone
cases of consumption have been cured by
Dr. Kkyhkr'h Lcng Cork is hardly to be
questioned, especially when persons who
have been cured can be pointed out to any
who choose to make the Inquiry of them. 1
These. cases arenear at hand In this city and '
within a short walk of the Doctor's office.
The Doctor doubtless does not pretend to
cure every case; nor does he claim that the
lung core will always cure without his per
sonal direction ; In many cases it will. In
every case It will relieve, and It will surely
cure the Incipient symptoms that lead to
that dreadful scourge; In other words, it
will cnre when application is made to it In
time. The Incredulous will not squander
much in in a bare trial either of time or
money. The Doctor will exam lite your
lung* if you will call on him at his ofllce,

hours from 9 A.M. until 1 P. M., and from
3 until 6, and on Raturdays from 7 to 0 at

Habitual Constipation.
HOW TO EFFECT A CERTAIN AND PER
MANENT CURE.
Some occupations of life predispose to
Cofltivenem, especially those which allow
but little exercise. Persons who contract
this unfortunate habit of body, under such
circumstances, might possibly be relieved
by changing their sedentary employments
for others of a more active kind ; but thta is
by no means certain. Habitual constipa
tion fc a very obstinate disorder. All the I
ordinary so-called remedies invariably ag- ;
gravatait. Nothing can be more injurious j
than the continued nse of strong aperients. !
They at first irritate and Anally almost ,
paralyse the bowels? rendering them so
torpid that enormous doses of cathartic
medicines have 90 effect upon them. A 1
mild aperient, combined with a gentle stim
ulant, Is the true remedy ; and a combina
tion in the happiest proportion of these in
gredients Is found in Hostetter's Btomach
Bitters. This famous stomachic invigorates ,
the whole intestinal canal, while quietly I
removing from its convolutions all impedl- 1
menta to a free passage through than. No
mere purgative ha* tkU doable operation.
No ordinary stimulent effects the desired
object. Ones of Constipation abandoned m
hopeless by distinguished medical men have
been cared in a few week* by the Bitter*. To
those who have tried all the medicines of
the dispensary in vain, we say liy this lrre
slstible stimulant and aperient. There ia no
sufficient reason wby conatipation should
lie the consequence of sedeutary habits.
Hostettert Bitters, by supplying the vi#or
which would otherwise be derived from ex
ercise, will in all case* enable the system to
perform lis excretory function regularly
and healthftilly.
