Washington, Dec. 4.—(By Associated
Press.)—The opening of the Fifty-sixth
congress today attracted that wide
spread attention which always attaches
to the annual assembling of the nation
al lawmakers. There was an added in
terest in the event this year, for the
many far-reaeliing questions awaiting
consideration gave an unusual import
ance to the return of congress. Aside
from this the Roberts case introduced
a phase which promised something out
Bide the ordinary developments of the
opening day.
Early in the day throngs began con
versing at the capitol. The outer doors
were open to all, and through these
flowed continuous streams of human
itv until the great corridors, galleries
and routundas were fairly packed. As
early" as 10:30 o'clock the conspicuous
figures of congress began to arrive and
this served to give the waiting throngs
temporary diversion. General Hender
son went direct to the speaker's private
office, vvhere he shared his time with
the house leaders and with those plead
ing for admission cards. Bepresenta
tive Richardson of Tennesee, the demo
crat house leader, was also early on the
scene, conferring with his lieutenants.
Shortly before 11 o'clock, Roberts of
Utah, in silk hat and black frock suit,
wade his way through the crowd to the
members^ private lobby. Here he
?-.':dson, the
two held a short conference, as to
whether (Roberts would seek to address
the house. A buzz of comment follow
ed the gentleman from Utah wherever
he went, but there was no disrespectful
demonstration.
Scattered through tlie galleries were
people, prominent in the political, social
and financial worlds. Very early in the
day the monster petition, said to con
sist of seven million names, protesting
against the seating of Roberts, was
brought into the hall. It had been col
lected by a New York newspaper. It
consisted of twenty-eight rolls of
•names,each about two feet in diameter,
encased in an American flag. These
rolls were stacked up in the area in
front of the clerk's desk and were
viewed with great curiosity.' Later,
Major McDowell, the clerk of the house,
ordered all except two of the rolls ta
ken out into the lobby.
After conferences between the house
leaders on both sides.it became general
ly understood that the Roberts case
would go over until tomorrow, after the
leading of the president's message.
This will permit the formal organiza-.
tion of the house and the selection of
seats to nroeeed today, formal objec
tions to Roberts will be presented to
day, but the understanding is that the
main question will go over. Represent
ative Richardson, the democratic floor
leader, says the understanding is defin
ite and formal, but some republican
members regard the proceedure as
doubtful.
Richardson, of Tennessee, jvlio was
selected as the leader of the minority
on Saturday, came upon the floor ear
lv and was soon surrounded by a
group of democrats. Roberts came in
to the hall shortly after 11 o'clock, but
he was not generally recognized and
he retired to the cloak room almost
immediately. At 11:30 o'clock a slWill
voiced clet-lc directed those not entitled
to the floor to retire and the officers
and pages rapidly cleared out those al
ready, in. Conspicuous on the -floor
were the old veterans Payne, of New
York, leader of the majority General
Grosvenor, of Ohio Hepburn, of Io
wa Dalzell, of Pennsylvania Bailey,
of'Texas McClelland and Sulzer, of
New York. Senator Rawlings, of
Utah, came over,from the senate wing
and held an earnest conference with
Roberts. Lentz, of Ohio, .took part 111
the conference and after it was over,
the report was circulated that Roberts
would not present himself to be sworn
in, but this was immediately denied.
Roberts himself said,he had not decid
ed what he would do, but that he
might desire to be heard when his
case came up. Mr. Taylor, of Ohio,
who represents McKinley's district,
who was to conduct the case.against
Roberts, was conferring with his col
leagues on the republican side. ..
nausea Called to Order.

tion of the blind chaplain, Rev. Henry
Cowden, of Washington, the, reading
clerk began calling. Roberts sat listen
Jng intently for his name, and when
It was called he responded "here," in a,
loud vdice. He looked nervous and ill
•t ease. There were no demonstrations

during the roll call. When it was con
Ijjh'dcd Clerk McDowell announced that

clerk, ^B^.,"tion of a speaker."
Hepburn ^ftpflTered a resolution
which was viva voce providing
that the house proceed to the election
of a speaker for the Fifty-sixth con
gress. Thereupon Grosvenor of Ohio,
as chairman of the republican caucus,
presented the name of David B. Hender
son of Iowa. The mention of the name
of General Henderson was greeted
with a round of applause from the re
nublican side. Hay of Virginia, chair
man of the democratic caucus, nomin
ated James D. Richardson of Tennessee
and his name drew the plaudits of the
democratic side. Ridgley of Kansas
nominated John C. Bell of Colorado,
as the populist candidate, and' Wilson
of Idaho placed Francis G. JJewIands of
Nevada in nomination as the candidate
of the silver party. Each party having
put forward'its candidate, by direction

When Birgham H. Roberts was
reached in the house roll call, the Utah
member-elect proceeded alone to the
area in front of the speakers desk and
awaited the administration of the oath.
At the same time Representative Tay
lor, of Ohio, secured recognition and
protested against the swearing in of
Roberts on the ground'of his being a
polygamist and not a properly natural
ized American citizen. Representative
McRae, of Arkansas, followed with a
protest from the democrat side say
ing that this issue was not involvhig
the sacredness of the American home,
a sentiment that brought out a burst
of applause. Speaker Henderson then
addressed Roberts 'saying: "Will the
gentleman stand aside until tthe i*oll
call is completed," Robfints assented,
with the statement that in so doing he
waived none of his rights, fit wn.s
agreed by unanimous consent that the
consideration of the resolution should

ban—Other War News*
London, Dec. 4.—There is still a lull
in tthe war news. This morning one
interesting item is to the effect that
the Boers had a very bad time at Kim
berley on Tuesday. One of their laa
gers was captured by the* Bechuana
land police. Kiraberley is now in
searchlight communication with the
relief force at Modder river.
From Natal we hear that on Tues
day the enemy was located at Cheveley
Station, on the railway between Frere
and Colenso. The general body of the
Boers fell back on Colenso and crossed
the river.
It- would seem that the great rail
way bridge was scientifically destroy:
ed. The JJoers are posted along Grob
ler's Kloof, on the north of the Tugela
River, which' they evidently intend to
defend at all costs, so that--.it will, be
come necessary to construct a pontoon
bridge for the passage of the British
troops.
Heavy Guns Needed.
This operation, unless the enemy be
first dislodged by superior artillery,
will have to be performed under fire
and amid "considerable difficulties. It
now seems probable that General Clery
is working round the enemy's flank by
way of Weenen, in which case the
Boers may be placed in a very awk
ward position.
Two more batteries.of artillery and
two more battalions of infantry have
reached Durban. General Clery must
now have at least 23,000 men, counting
in the Natal Volunteers. With Gener
al White's 9,500, this makes a cotal "of
32,500 British troops in Natal.

Pullman charges were $2,550, and there

SENATE TO CAUCUS TUESDAY.
Committee Reorganization Will be lta
Principal Worn.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The republican
members of the senate probably will
hold a caucus Tuesday afternoon to
make provision for the reorganization
of the committees. There are many
vacancies on committees caused by
the retirement of senators. These will
be and in many cases where the
republicans are in the minority on
committees, steps will be taken to so
change the membership -as to give
them control. Having so clenrly a ma
jority of the members of the Senate
the republicans are inclined to assert
their privilege of controlling commit
tee work throughout.
No decision has yet been reached as
to what shall be done about filling the
elective offices of the senate, but the
present disposition is to postpone ac
tion upon that subject for the present.
The eeneral interest in the commit
tee changes centers in the committee
on finances. There are two vacancies
in that committee caused by .the re
tirement of Senators Turpie, of Indi
ana, and White, of California, and the
republicans will insist upon filling
both of these places. The friends of
Senator Hanna are urgin™ his selec
tion for one of the places.
The probabilities are that the de
tailed work of filling the committees
will be delegated to a committee and
that no qctual changes will be -iade
for several days or possibly weeks.
