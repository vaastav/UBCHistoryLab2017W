TUESDAY EVENING. DEC. 7. LS97.
In HI3 aonual report, Dr. Benjamin
Biackford, the competent and efficient
superintendent of the Western State
Ho3pital, attributes the increase of in?
sanity to "nervousness," and that, to
several causes, among them, increased
demands of a suddenly and too highly
developed social culture, and competi?
tion in all oscupations of life, and he
takes the correct view when he says :
"The curse of our age is the striving
affer wealth and high position, eveu if
health, family and reputation are sac?
rificed to tbi3 Moloch of ammtion.
Mandslev, one of the most eminent of
Eogli3h physicians a-:d savants, Bays:
Tue practical religion of the day, the
real guiding gospel of life, is raone\
getting; the professed religion isChri
tianity:' and he draws attention to tb>
fact that the offspring of those who
have striveo recklessly for the attain?
ment of wealth and position are fre?
quently mental and physical wrecks,
B?owing that the genera'ive power suf
fen from exi austion, which is the in
evitabie re-ult of tbe viola bn of _the
laws of Dature. Paresis, which visits
the mao of tbe nineteenth century with
frightful frequency, is but tie patho
logical consequence of unheal'hy social
conditions, for which tbe woman of eo
ciety is in no slight de?reeresponsible.*'
In every populous country there
must, as long as human nature -bill bi
unchanged, some disaffected people,
the number varying with circum?
stances. It is no less true that all
countries have foreign enemies. The
depressed business condition of this
country has greatly increased the num?
ber of the former and the jingoism and
presumption manifested both in tbe
executive and legislative branches of
its government have incited the en?
mity not only of nearly all the Eu
ropean, but of some of the Asiatic na?
tions. Added to this, there is the
abiding hatred of ell monarcbical gov?
ernments to republican institutioas. It
is needless to say that all these causes
and the effects thereof are greater now
than ever before, and that they are
rolled by the monarchists like sweet
morsels under their tongues, and that
they presage any thi?g else tbau the
0)untry's peace and prosperity.
General Blanco, the new Captain
Ganeral of Cuba, says:
"i/o day the so-called 'Army of Lib?
erty' is mostly a collection of mulattoes
and blacks, under leaders of every color
and country. Such men do not fight
for a principle."
He also says:
"The duration of the war is simply n
matter you, the American people, to de
cide. If you continue to allow filibus
tering expeditions to leave your shores,
against the eflort3 of jour Kovernmeat,
you will enable trie insurgents to at
least in part keep up the war against
Spain, against their own interest-,
against the interests of Cuba and against
the interests of American citizens."
This is what e\'ery disinterested, in?
telligent man, familiar with the true
condition of affairs in Cuba, has said
from the first. Buc filibusters arc
neither disinterested, intelligent nor
familiar with Cuban effairs.
If Congress would increase the
membership of the U. S. supreme court,
the five to four decision, tbat the rieb,
though willing, should not be taxed to
support the federal government, would
be repealed, and the deficit in the
Treasury be effectively and immediate?
ly stopped. Then, if this were supple?
mented by an act authorizing the Secre?
tary of the Treasury to redeem green?
backs and treasury notes with silver
dollars, the "endless chain" would be
broken at once, and money become so
plentiful that every body would have
some. _
Senator Teller's plan for breaking
the so-called "endless chain," tbat is,
for stopping tbe constant drain of gold
from the Treasury for tbo redemption
of greenbacks, would certainly prove a
short, plain and effective one. It is to
offar to redeem them with silver dol?
lars. It will be recollected tbat ex
Secretary Carlisle once issued an order
to redeem the Treasury notes with such
dollars, but revoked it by command of
Mr. Cleveland, on advico from Wall
Street._
There is plenty of money in the
country, but nearly all of it is con?
gested in the centers, little being in
general circulation. Indeed so plenti?
ful is it in Wall street and so little of
it is among the people of the country
that all sorts of insurance companies
are reducing the cost of their policies,
and investment companies are lower?
ing their rates of interest. The value
of real ?State, too, has depreciated fully
one-half.
Every tux payer ?u the State hopes
that the measures for reducing the
number of officials, now before the leg?
islature, may be adopted as speedily as
possible, and ol course all of them are
opposed to the creation of any more
offices. The tax eaters are becoming
almost as numerous as the tax payers
and such a condition as that is ruinous.
The people should support the govern
ment, not the government, the people.
The President left Washington Jast
night at 7:20 o'clock for Canton, to at?
tend the death bed of his mother.

M nister. Mr. Leger, was without news from

senate.
The invocation at the opening of the
session of the Senate to-day was deliv?
ered by Rev. Charles A. Berry, of Wol
verhampton, England. He prayed that
tho Almighty might take into his care
all the interests of the nation, that from
this notiou may emanate such fealings
of brotherhood as would be a blessing
to'all mankind.
Mr. Walthall presented the creden?
tials of Hon. H. DtS. Money as Senator
from Mississippi, to succeed the late
Senator George.
Mr. Chandler called attention to the
wording of the credentials presented for
Mr. Money, which was that the new
Senator should "have and hold such
o'lice" uncii his authority should be "re?
voked by couijietent authority." He
8 iid the credentials were not in consti?
tutional form. He had no idea of an?
tagonizing tho newly appointed Sena
tor because of tho error in his cre?
dentials, bur. he gave notice that here?
after he would object to the swearing
in of any Senator whose credentials
were not in proper form.
Mr. Wahnall Baid that the point
raided by tho Sanator from Now Hamp?
shire was purely te.-bnical.
Mr. Hoar admitted in a defense of
the poiut raised by Mr. Chandler that
the accredited Senator was a good man,
but insisted that his credentials were
bad. He hoped tbat before the con?
clusion of the present session of Con?
gress a rule prescribing defiuite forms
for all appointments upon which the
Senate had to paes would he established.
Mr. Alien challenged the statement
of Mr. Chandler thai The credentials of
Mr. Money were not in proper form.
He held that there wa3 no prescribed
form and that there was no use cavilling
about the matter.
Mr. Teller contended that the cre?
dentials contained more than was nec?
essary, but absolutely a;l that was re?
quired.
Mr. Mouey was then escorted by Mr.
Walthall to the desk of the Vice Presi- j
dent where he was sworn in.
A flood of bids and joint resolutions !
I was poured into the Senate. Mr. Mor
rill, the venerable Senator from Ver?
mont, having the distinction of intro?
ducing the firs:, providing for the "gild?

which was adopted, fixing Tuesday, i
January 18, at 2 p. m., as a time lor |

Earl, a Senator from South Carolina, j
Mr. Pettigrew secured the passage of
a resolution calling for a list of the
railroad companies which have com?
plied with the law of Congress provid?
ing that safety appliances be affixed to

The contest between the friends of
the immigration bill and those who
favor prompt action with reference to
the sale of the Kansas Pacific railroad
developed at this juncture.
Mr. Carter, ciairman of the census
committee, requested that the measure
providing for the federal census of 1900,
reported to the Senate at the last ses?
sion, be recommitted to the committee.
To this Mr. Coandler, the author of
the hill, objected, but after some ex?
planation by Mr. Carter the bill was
recommitted as requested.
Mr. Lodge then gave notice tbat he
wotidcall up the immigration bill at
the conclusion oi the present unfinished
business.
Mr. Gear announced promptly that
he would contest that motion.
Mr. Allison, in the hope, as he said,
that tbe gentlemen might reach an
amicable understanding moved at 1:35
p. m., that tbe Senate adjourn and the
motion prevailed.
HOUSE.
Rev. Henry Couden, the regular
chaplian who delivered the invocation
to day asked for the divine blessings !
upon the President in bis hour of trial j
and anxiety. After the reading of the
journal leave was asked by several of
the more important committees to sit
during the sessions of tbe House and
for the printing of documents for the
use of the committees.
These were the customary requests
and were granted.
The President's message transmitting
the report of the special commission on
theParis international exposition in 1900
atd recommending a liberal appropria?
tion for represrntation at the exposi?
tion was laid before the House.
Mr. Dingley, from the committee on
ways and means, then presented a reso
lution adopted by tbat committee for
the distribution of tbe President's mes?
sage to tbe several committees having
jurisdiction of the various subjects treat?
ed. Mr. Walker, chairman of the bank?
ing and currency committee, asked for
a rereading of that portion of tbe reso
lution giving the ways and means com?
mittee jurisdiction of all tbe portions
relating to "tbe revenues, the national
finances, the public debt and tbe pres?
ervation of the public credit."
A very considerable debate followed
upon what the language of tbe resolu
tion meant, and tbe issue as to jurisdic
tiou of the currency probltm as between
tbe ways and mean3 and the banking
and currency was sbarply raised.
Before tbe debate, which lasted over
an hour, had been concluded the House
was plunged into a debate on tbe cur?
rency problem. Mr. Walker after the
re-reading of the resolution asked with
some beat wnat wes left to his com?
mittee.
Mr. Dingley suavely that all mat?
ters relating to banking and currency
under tbe resolution would go to the
banking and currency committee.
"Tnere seems to be a decided con
fl.ct of opinion as to what matters refer
to banking and currency," exclaimed
Mr. Walker rather sbarply.
Mr. Dingley protested that the lan?
guage of the resolution was identical
with tbat of former resolutions on the
same subject, but he was immediately
bombarded with questions as to tbe
practical effect of the resolution's lan?
guage.
Mr. Johnson wanted the jurisdiction
of the banking and currency commit?
tee settled and thought this as good as
any other time to do it.
Mr. Dingley said the real question of
jurisdiction would depend on the in?
terpretation of the phrase "nation?
al finances," which he reiterated
bad been used in all ques?
tions relating to banking and currency
would go to the banking and currency
committee. With this explanation
Mr. Johnson appeared content for the
time. Then Mr. Hailey, the minoriu
leader, attacked the flank of Mr. Ding?
ley. He wanted to know specifically
whether a measure to effectuate the
recommendation of the President on
the |currency would go to the wayB
and means or the currency committee.
Dr. Dingley avoided a direct re?
sponse. If it related to the redemp?
tion fund such a bill would go to the
ways and meauh, he said,
"If it is proposed to retire the green?
backs in the manner recommended by
tbe President, where would it go ?"
asked Mr. Bailey.
Mr. Johnson pressed Mr. Dingley
along the same line.
"I would leave the determination of
that question to the Speaker," at last
rppiied Mr. Dingley. The House
liughed.
"It i3 to avoid that very thing," ex?
claimed Mr. Johnson, "that I desire
this question to be made clear now.
Does the chairman of the ways and
means committee think a bill embodying
the principle of the President's recom?
mendation affect, the redemption fund?"
"I think it does," replied Mr. Ding?
ley.
"Then the gentleman indirectly an?
swers our question?" exclaimed Mr.
Johnson.
Mr. Walker indignantly protested
that if the questions relating to legal
tender money were to come under tbe
jurisdiction of the ways and means
committee, the committee on banking
and currency might as well be dissolved.
In the last Congress its members had
cooled their heels in tbe Speaker's lob?
by, and when at last they were allowed
to bring in a bill the previous question
had been demanded.
Mr. Cox 3aid the President's recom?
mendations as to national bank circula?
tion were inextricably interwoven with
the proposition to retire the greenbacks.
He expressed the opinion that tbo ob
ject of the resolution was to so divide
the subject that nothing practical
w >uld result.
Mr. Wheeler.got the floor and used a
few minuws in a plea for government
armor plate plant in Alabama.
Mr. Grosyenor diverted the whole
course of the debate by an attack on tbe
civil service law, which was seyeral i
times enthusiastically applauded both
by members on the floor and
spectators in tbe galleries. He
repudiated it he idea that .opposi?
tion to the civil service law involved an
affront to the President. Congress wa3
empowered to deal with the sunj-ct
and the President ?*d referred it to
Congress.'
"I am tlad," said Mr. Grosyenor, "to ;
go that far with tbe President, even if j

Little Early Risers cure biliousness, constipa?
tion, sick headache. Charlas G. Lennon.
I am compelled to part company from
him when he says the civil service sys?
tem has tbe official sanction of the
people." Mr. Grosvenor declared tbat
he had kept (in touch with the senti?
ment of .the country and tbat if the
question was submitted to the people
west of tbe Alleghany mountains it
would be buried under their over?
whelming condemnation. His remarks
in denunciation of "life tennre in
office" were met with uproarious ap?
plause from the galleries in which
many members on the floor heartily
joined.^
Mr. Dingley then modified the reso?
lution so as to make it agreeable to Mr.
Walker and it was agreed to without
> division and the House adjourned.
THE LEGISLATURE.
senate.
The Senate yesterday adopted a reso?
lution calling upon the auditor of pub?
lic accounts for a statement showing
the normal expenses and revenues of
the State. This is to be used in pre?
paring a basis of proposed reform
measures. One of the plans which
meets with some favor is to place all
the expense of prosecuting misde?
meanor cases on the counties, instead
of the Commonwealth, as now. A plan
which is likely to meet with more fav
orable consideration is for all expense
accounts of courts to be passed upon by
the board of supervisors before being
forwarded to tbe auditor of public ac
counts for payment. At present these
accounts simply have to be approved
by the judges. II they are subjected to
the open inspection of supervisors it is
claimed that a large saving will be ac?
complished.

mittee on counties, cities and towns, and

German-Haytiau Trouble Settled.
Port au Prince, Hayti, Dec. 7.?
The question of the indemnity de?
manded of Haiti by Germany, for the
alleged illegal arrest and imprisonment
of Lueders, a German subject, has been
settled to tho satisfaction of Germany
under the threat of a bombardment of
the defeosive works of the pore unless
the demands were agreed to within
the eight hours. The first part of the
settlement took place at 6 o'clock last
night, when the Haytian fleet formally
saluted the German flag. While the
flag of Haiti was being dipped to the
standard of Germany, the band of the
Haytian navy played the German na?
tional anthem and the Haytian flagship
fired 21 guns. The second part of the
settlement of the trouble between Ger?
many and Hayti took place this
morning, when Count Von Schwerin,
the German minister to Hayti, was
formally and solemnly received by the
Haytian officials. Naturally there is a
strong feeling of resentment against the
government of Hayti on account of
the humiliation inflicted upon the coun?
try by Germany; but it is not thought
tbat anything more serious than a
ministerial crisis will result.

Canton, O., JDec. 7.?The President

and as ho did so she put her arms
nbout his neck and bigoified that she
knew him. She also recognized the
President's wife, and reached her hand
toward her.

London, Dec. 7.?The St. James Ga?

President McKinley's message eays:
"As a whole, it looks like an early con?

The Globe is of the opinion that it
"would have taxed the abilities even
of a greater statesman" to deal with
the Cuban question satisfactorily, ad?
ding: "Although all the arguments
against the au negation of Cuba are
equally applicable to Hawaii, tbe
United States is determined to have
the latter, though America, a fourth
ra e naval power, can only bold Hawaii
on sufferance. In the event of war she
would be bundled out, neck and crop,
by any first rate power which finds it
necessary to occupy the island."
