Discussed.
Washington, Dec. S.—President Roose
velt's message to the second session of
the Fifty-ninth congress deals with a
number of new and important subjects,
chief of which is the government prose
cution of the trusts, the abuse of injunc
tions in labor troubles, the negro Ques
tion, the preaching of class hatred
between capital and labor, additional legis
lation for the control of large corpora
tions, a federal inheritance and income
•tax law and currency reform.
The message opens with a statement
of what the last congress left unfinished,
and of this he says:
"I again recommend a law prohibiting
all corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Such
a bill has already past one house of con
gress. Let individuals contribute as they
desire but let us prohibit in effective
fashion all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose,
directly or indirectly.
"Another bill which has just past one
house of the congress and which is ur
gently necessary should bp enacted Into
law is that conferring upon the govern
ment the right of appeal in criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exists in many of the states it exists in
the ©istrict of Columbia by act of the
congress. It is of course not proposed
that !q any case a verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set
aside. Recently in one district where
the government had Indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy In connection with
rebates, tjie court sustained the defend
ant's demurrer while In another juris
diction an indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under it,
and two defendants sentenced to impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be in real conflict with each other,
but it is unfortunate that there should
even be an apparent conflict. At pres
ent there Is no way by which the gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to
a higher court and the wheels of justice
are blocked without any real decision of
the question. I can not too strongly
urge the passage of the bill in question.
A failure to pass will result In seriously
hampering the government in its effort
to obtain justice, especially against
wealthy individuals or corporations who
do wrong- and may also prevent the
government from obtaining justice for
wagaworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a case where
the judgment of an inferior court has
bee*i against them. I have specifically
In view a recent decision by a district
judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy for violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a single district judge,
ag'ainst what may be the judgment of
the immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law solemnly
enacted by the congress lo be "uncon
stitutional," and then to deny to the
government the right to have the su
preme court definitely decide the ques
tion."
Evasion by Technicalities.
"In connection with this matter, 1 would
like to call attention to the very unsat
isfactory state of our criminal law, re
sulting in large part from the hab't of
setting aside the judgments of inferior
courts on technicalities absolutely un
connected with the merits of the case,
and where there is no attempt to show
that there has been any failure of sub
stantial justice. It would be well to en
act a law providing something to the
effect that:
"No judgment shall be set aside or new
trial granted in any cause, civil or crim
inal, on the ground of misdirection of the
jury or the improper admission or re
jection of evidence, or for error as to any
matter of pleading or procedure unless,
in the opinion of the court to which the
application is made, after an examina
tion of the entire cause, it shall affirma
tively appear that the error complained
01 has resulted in a miscarriage of
justice
Injunctions.
On the subject of the abolition of in
junctions ia labor disputes, he says:
"In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law In connection with the
issuance of injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn lo the matter
by the demand that the right of applv
lng injunctions in labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether the
use of injunctions In such cases would
stand the tost of the courts in which
case of course the legislation would be
Ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would
be wrong altogether to prohibit the use
of injunctions. It is criminal to permit
sympathy with criminals to weaken our
hands in ui'h" ii"i Hie law and if men
seek to def-v.r-y life or property by mob
violence there simuWl be no Impairment
of the power of the courts to deal with
them in the most summary and effective
way possible. But so far as possible the
abuse of the power should be provided
against by some such law as advocated
last year.
"In this matter of injunctions there Is
lodged in the hands of the judiciary a
necessary power which is nevertheless
subject to the possibility of grave abuse.
It is a power that should be exercised
with extreme care and should be sub
ject to the jealous scrutiny of all men.
and condemnation should be meted out
as much to the Judge who fails to use
It boldly when necessary as to the judge
who uses it wantonly or oppressively.
Of course, a judge strong enough to be
fit for his office will enjoin any resort
to violence or intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what his opinion
may be of the rights of the original quar
rel.. There must be no hesitation in
dealing with disorder. But there must
likewise be no such abuse of the in
junctive power as is implied In forbidding
laboring men to strive for their own bet
terment in peaceful and lawful ways
nor must the injunction be used merely
to aid some big corporation in carrying
out schemes for its own aggrandizement
It must be remembered that a prelim
inary injunction in a labor case, if
granted without adequate proof (even
when authority can be found to support
the conclusions of law on which it is
founded), may often settle the dispute
•between the parties and therefore if
improperly granted may do irreparable
wrong. Yet there are many judges who
assume a matter-of-fact course granting
of a preliminary injunction to be the
ordinary and proper judicial disposition
of such cases: and there have undoubt
edly oen flagrant wrongs committed
by judges in connection with labor dis
putes even within the last few years,
altho I think much less often than in
former years. Such judges by their un
wise action Immensely strengthen the
hninlfi of those wha are, striving entirely

members of the white race on
tne other hand should understand that
every lynching represents by just so
much a loosening of the bands of civ-
the
Need for Negro Education.
"There is another matter which has
a direct bearing upon this matter of
lynching and of the brutal crime which
sometimes calls it forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuse for
its existence. It is out of the question
for our people as a whole permanently
to rise by treading down any of their
own number. Even those who them
selves for the moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows will In
the long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can be imagined
than, in the fancied interest of one
class, to prevent the education of an
other class. The free public school, the
chance for each boy or girl to get a
good elementary education, lies at the
foundation of our whole political situ
ation. In every community the poor
est citizens, those who need the schools
most, would be deprived of them if
they only received school facilities
proportionately to the taxeB they paid.
This is as true of one portion of our
country as of another. It is as true
for the negro as for the white man.
The white man. if he is wise, will de
cline to allow the negroes in a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education. Unquestionably ed
ucation such as is obtained in our pub
lic schools does not do everything to
wards making a man a good citizen
but it does much. The lowest and most
brutal criminals, those for instance
who commit the crime of rape, are in
the great majority men who have had
either no education or very litle just
as they are almost invariably men who
own no property for the man who
puts money by out of his earnings,
like the man who acquires education,
Is usually lifted above mere brutal
criminality. Of course the best type
of education for the colored man, ta
ken as a whole, is such education as
is conferred in schools like Hampton
and Tuskegee where the boys and
girls, the young men and young wo
men, are trained industrially as well
as in the ordinary public school
branches. The graduates of these
schools turn out well in the great ma
jority of cases, and hardly any of them
become criminals, while what little
criminality there is never takes the
form of that brutal violence which in
vites lynch law. Every graduate of
these schools—and for the matter of
that every oher colored man or wo
man—who leads a life so useful and
honorable as to win the good will and
respect of those whites whose neigh
bor he or she is, thereby helps the
whole colored race as It can be helped
in no other way for next to the negro
himself, the man who can do most to
help the negro is "his white neighbor
who lives near him and our steady
effort should be to better the relations
between the two. Great tho the bene
fit of these schools has been to their
colored pupils and to the colored peo
ple, It may well be questioned whether
the benefit has not been at least as
great to the white people among whom
these colored pupils live after they
graduate."
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labr.r
the president takes the agitators of class
hatred to task and says "to preach
hatred to the rich man, as such,
to seek to mislead and inflame to mad
ness honest men whose lives are hard
and who have not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate the danger in the doctrines
preached is to commit a crime against
the body politic and to be false to every
worthy principle and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on this
subject he says:
"The plain, people who think—the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, the men to
whom American traditions are dear,
who love their country and try to act
decently by their neighbors, owe it to
themselves to remember that the most
damaging blow that can be given pop
ular government is to elect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy.
Whenever such an issue is raised in
this country nothing can be gained by
flinching from it. for in such case dem
ocracy Is itself on trial, popular self
government under republican forms Is
itself on trial. The triumph of the
mob Is Just as evil a thing as the tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to have
escaped one danger avails nothing
whatever if we sucuumb to the other.
In the end the honest man.whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal justly by his follows, has
as much to fear from tin* insincere
and unworthy demagog, promising
much and performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but evil, who
•would set on the mob to plunder the
rich, as from the crafty corruptionist.
who, for his own ends, would permit
the common people to be exploited by
the very wealthy. If we ever let this
government fall into the hands of men
of either of these two classes, we shall
show ourselves false to America's past.
Moreover, the demagog and corrup
tionist often work hand in hand. There
are at this moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard the public servant who prose
cutes them when they violate the law,
or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as
being even more objectionable than
the violent agitator who hounds on
the mob to plunder the rich. There is
nothing to choose between such a re
actionary and such an agitator funda
mentally they are alike in their selfish
disregard of the rights of others: and
it is natural that they should join in
opposition to any movement of which
the aim Is fearlessly to do exact and
even justice to all."
Railroad Employees* Hours.
I-Ie asks for the passing of the bill lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad employes, and
classes the measure as a very moderate
one. Ho says the aim of all should bo
tp steadily reduce the number of hours
of labor, with as a goal the general In
troduction of an eight-hour day, but in
sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the
conditions are so different from what
they are here that the introduction of an
eignt-liour day on the" canal would be
absurd, and continues, "just about as ab
surd as It is, so far as the isthmus is
concerned, where white labor cannot be
employed, to bother as to whether the
work is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
Investigation of Disputes.
He urges the enactment of a drastic
child labor law for the District of Co
lumbia and the territories, and a federal
investigation of the subject of child and
female labor throughout the country.
He reviews the work of the commission
appointed to investigate labor conditions
In the coal fields of Pennsylvania In 1902,
and refers to the wish of the commission
that the state and federal governments
should provide the machinery for what
may be called the compulsory investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they arise." After
referring to the fact that

Inevitably throws into prominence in
the community all the foul and evil

who have any knowledge of it. and
therefore just so much additional

Americans.

an unwillingness of either party to ac

as to the justloe or Injustice of the mat
ters in dispute. The exercise of a ju

representing the federal government,,
such as would be provided ty. a commis

would tend to create "an atmosphere of
friendliness and conciliation between con
tending parties and. the giving each side
an equal opportunity to present fully Its
case in the presence of the other would
prevent many disputes from developing
Into serious strikes or lockouts, and in
other cases, would enable the commis
sion to persuade the opposing parties to
come to terms.
"In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers nor
employees should be left completely at
the mercy of the stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of the righteousness of
their respective claims. The proposed
measure would be in the line of securing
recognition of the fact that in many
strikes the public has itself an inle.'gsl
which cannot wisely be disregarded an
interest not merely of general conven
ience, for the question of a Just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
it is well to advance cautiously, testing
each step by the actual results the step
proposed can surely be safely taken, for
the decisions of the commission would
not bind the parties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chance for public opin
ion to exert its full force for the right."
Control of Corporations.
A considerable portion of the message
Is devoted to the subject of federal con
trol of corporations in what he refers to
the passage at the last session of the
rate, meat inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these have already justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of the meat Inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to place the
cost of inspection on the packers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
this subject of the control of corporations
by the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securit.g by the actions of

legislatures ar.y thing but. ineffective

not so much to prevent consolidation as
•such, but so to supervise and control it
as to see that it results in no harm to
the people. The reactionary or uitracon
servative apologists for tho misuse of
wealth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of feet it is these reactionaries
and ^ICraconservallvts who are them
selves most potent in increasing socialis

methods of averting the conKequenees of

of evil as to which the agitation is well
founded. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmental
ownership of railways Is to secure by
the government on behalf of the psople
as a whole such adequate control ana
regulation of the great interstate com
mon carriers as will do away with the
evil3 which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper ant:dot6
to the dangerous and wicked agitation
against tho men of wealth as such is to
secure by proper legislation and execu
tive action the abolition of the grave
abuses which actually do obtain in con
'nection with .the business use of wealth
under our present system—or rather _no
system—of failure to exercise any ade

Combinations Are Necessary.
"The actual working of our laws has
shown that the effort to prohibit all com
bination, good or bad, is noxious where
it is not Ineffective. Combination of
capital like combination of labor is a
necessary element of our present Indus
trial system. It is not possible completely
to prevent it and if it were possible,
such complete prevention would do dam
age to the body politic. What we need
is not vainly to prevent all combination,
but to secure such rigorous and adequate
control and supervision of the combina
tions as to prevent their injuring the
ftably
iubllc, or existing in such form as inev
to threaten Injury—for the mere
fact that a combination has secured
practically complete control of a neces
sary of life would under any circum
stances show that such combination was
to be presumed to be adverse to the pub
lic interest. It Is unfortunate that our
present laws should forbid all combina
tions, instead of sharply discriminating
between those combinations which do
evil. Rebates, for instanco, are as often
due to the pressure of big shippers (as
was shown in the Investigation "of Vhe
Standard Oil company and as has been
shown since by the investigation of the
tobacco and sugar trusts) as to the Initi
ative of big railroads. Often railroads
would like to combine for tho purpose of
preventing a big shipper from maintain
ing improper advantages at the expense
of small shippers and of the general pub
lic. Such a combination, instead of being
forbidden by law, should be favored. In
other words, it should be permitted to
railroads to make agreements, provided
these agreements were sanctioned by the
interstate commerce commission and
were published. With these two condi
tions complied with it is impossible to
see what harm such a combination could
do to the public at large. It is a public
evil to have on the statute books a law

more scathing condemnation could be
visited upon a law than is contained 1n
the words-
of
commission when, in commenting upon
the fact that the numerous Joint- traffic
associations do technically violate the
law, they say: "The decision -of the
United States supreme court in the
Transmississlppl case and the Joint
Traffic association case has produced no
practical effect upon the railway opera
tions of the country. Such associations,
in fact, exist now as they did before
these decisions, and with the same gen
eral effect. Iti justice to all parties, we
ought probably to add that it is difficult
to see how our interstate railways could
be operated with due regard to the inter
est of the., shipper and the railway
without concerted action of the kind af
forded thru these associations."
This means that the law as construed
by the supreme court is such that the
business of the country cannot be con
ducted without breaking it. I recommend
that you give careful and early consider
ation to this subject, and if you find the
opinion of the interstate commerce com
mission justified, that you amend the
law so as to obviate the evil disclosed.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer in some way to his belief
In the necessity for the curbing of enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation for both in
come and an Inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should Impose a
graduated Inheritance tax, and, if possi
ble, a graduated Income tax. He says:
"I am well aware that such a subject
as this needs long and careful study in
order that the people may become famil
iar with what Is proposed to be done,
may clearly see the necessity of proceed
ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and
may make up their minds just how far
they are willing to go in the matter
while only trained legislators can work
out the project in necessary detail. But
I feel that in the near future our nation
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing for a graduated inheritance tax by
which a steadily increasing rate of duty
should be put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift, bequest, or
devise to any individual or corporation.
It may be well to make the tax heavy
in proportion as the individual benefited
Is remote of kin. In any event, In my
judgment the pro rata of the tax should
increase very heavily with the increase
of the amount left to any one Individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the desire on the
part of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making the tax very small on moder
ate amounts of property left because
the prime object should be to put a con
stantly increasing burden on the inher
itance of those swollen fortunes which
it Is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly how far the inheritance tax
would, as an incident, have the effect of
limiting the transmission by devise or
gift of the enormous fortunes in question
it is not necessary at present to discuss.
It is wise that progress in this direction
should be gradual. At first a permanent
national inheritance tax, while it might
be more substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, nec-d not approximate,
either in amount or in the extent of the
Increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.
Inheritance Tax Constitutional.
"This species of tax has again and again
been imposed, altho only temporarily, by
the national government. It was first
Imposed by the act of July 6, 1797, when
the makers of tho Constitution wore
alive and at the head of affairs. It was
a graduated tax tho small In amount,
the rate was Increased with the amount
left to any Individual, exceptions being
made in the case of certain close kin. A
similar tax was again Imposed by the
act of July 1, 1862 a minimum sum of
$1,000 in personal property being excepted
from taxation, the tax then becoming
progressive according to the remoteness
of kin. The war-revenue act of June 13,
1898, provided for an inheritance tax on
an7 sum exceeding the value of (10,000,
the rate of tax Increasing both in accord
ance with the amounts left and in ac
cordance with the legatee's remoteness
of
kin. The supreme court has held that
the succession tax Imposed at the time
of
the civil war was not a direct tax but
an impose of excise which was both con
stitutional and valid. More recently the
court, tn an opinion delivered by Mr.
Justice White, which contained an ex
ceedingly able and elaborate discussion
of
as a matter of fact the
competition
the powers of the congress to impose
death duties, sustained tne constitution
ality
of
which
results in a single individual or corpor
ation rising at the expense of all others
until his or its rise effectually checks all
competition and reduces former competi
tors to a position of utter inferiority and
subordination.
"In enacting and enforcing such legis
lation as this congress already has to Its
credit, we are working on a coherent
plan, with the steady endeavor to secure
the needed reform by the joint action of
the moderate men, the plain "men who
do not wish anything hysterical or
dangerous, but who do Intend to deal

the real and great evils of the fPssent

instance, that if logical, we should go
to government ownership of railroads
and the like the reactionaries, because
on such an issue they think the people
would stand with them, while the ex
tremists care rather to preach discontent
and agitation than to achieve solid re
sults. As a matter of fact, our position
is as remote from that of the bourbon
reactionary as from that of the imprac
ticable or sinister visionary. We hold
that the government should not conduct
the business of the nation, but that it
should exercise such supervision as will
insure its being conducted in the inter
est of the nation. Our aim is. so far as
may be, to secure, for all decent, hard
working men, equality of opportunity and
equality of burden.

Is Income Tax Constitutional?
"In its incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revenue, an
income tax stands on an entirely differ
ent footing from an inheritance tax, be
cause it Involves no question of tne per
petuation of fortunes swollen to an un
healthy size. The question is in its
essence a question of the proper adjust

law now stands It is undoubtedly dlffi»
cult to devise a national income tar
which shall be constitutional. But
whether it is absolutely Impossible is an
other question and impossible It if most
certainly desirable. The first purely In
come tax law was past by the congress
in 1881, but the most Important law deal
ing with the subject was that of 1894.
This the court held to be unconstitu
tional.
"The question Is undoubtedly very in
tricate, delicate, and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It is the law of the
land, and, of course, is excepted as such
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens.
Nevertheless, the hesitation evidently
felt by the court as a whole in coming
to a conclusion, when considered to
gether with the previous decisions on
the subject, may perhaps Indicate the
possibility of devising a constitutional
income-tax law which shall substan
tially acccomplisli the results aimed
at. The difficulty of amending the con
stitution is so great that only real ne
cessity can justify a resort thereto.
Every effort should be made in dealing
-frith this subject, as with the subject
of the proper control by the national
government over the use of corporate
wealth in Interstate business, to devise
legislation which without such action
shall attain the desired end but if this
fails, there will ultimately be no al
ternative to a constitutional amend
ment."
He makes a strong plea for technical
and industrial education for the masses,
and while the federal government can do
but little In this line, he asks that
schools of this character be established
in the District of Columbia as an ex
ample to the various states.
Agricultural Interests.
Ho appeals for every encouragement
that the congress can give to the agri
cultural interests of the country. He
points to the good that is being done by
the various forms of grange organiza
tions, and says:
"Several factors must cooperate in the
improvement of the farmer's condition.
He must have the chance to be educated

relationship between the theory of edu
cation and the facts of life. In all
education wo should widen our aims. It
Is a good thing to produce a certain num
ber of trained scholars and students
but the education superintended by tho
state must seek rather to produce a hun
dred good citizens than merely one
scholar, and it must be turned now and
then from the class book to the study
of the great book of nature itself. This
is especially true of the farmer, as has
been pointed out again and again by all
observers most competent to pass prac
tical Judgment on the problems of our
country life. All students now realize
that education must seek to train the
executive powers of young people and to
confer more real significance upon the
phrase "dignity
of
In
the world
farmers for mutual advantage are
partly economic and partly sociological.
"Moreover, while in the long run volun
tary effort will prove more efficacious
than government assistance, while the
farmers must primarily do most for
themselves, yet the government can also
do much. The department of agriculture
has broken' new ground in many direc
tions, and year by year it finds how it
can improve its methods and develop
fresh usefulness. Its constant effort is
to give the governmental assistance in
the most, effective way that is, thru as
sociations of farmers rather than to or
thru individual farmers. It Is also striv
ing to coordinate its work with the agri
cultural departments of the several
States, and so far as its own work is
educational, to coordinate it with the
work of other educational authorities.
Agricultural education is necessarily
based upon general education, but our
agricultural educational institutions are
wisely specializing themselves, making
their course relate to the actual teaching
of the agricultural and kindred sciences
to young country people or young city
people who wish to live in the country.
"Great progress has already been made
among farmers by the creation of
farmers' Institutes, of dairy ".ssocia
tions, of breeders' assoi-h' tlons. horti
cultural associations, and the like.
striking example of how the govern
ment and the farmers cnn cooperate is
shown in connection with the menace
offered to tho cotton growers of tin
southern states by the advance of the
boll weevil. The department is doing
all It can to organize the farmers in
the threatened districts, just as it has
been doing all it can to organize them
in aid of its work to eradicate the cat
tle fever tick in the south. The depart
ment can and will cooperate with all
such associations, and It must have
their help if its own work is to bt
done in the most efficient style."
He urges the extension of the irriga
tion and forest preservation system, and
asks for an appropriation for building a
memorial theater at Arlington.
Marriage and Divorce.
As a means of bringing about, national
regulation of marriage and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amendment, and
says it is not safe to leave these ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
states. Continuing on this subject he
says:
When home ties are loosened when
men and women cease to regard a
worthy family life, with all its duties
fully performed, and all Its responsi
bilities lived up to, as the life best
worth living then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. There are
regions in our land, and classes of our
population, where the birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surely It
should need no demonstration to show
that wilful sterility is, from the
standpoint of the nation, from me
standpoint of the human race, the one
sin for which the penalty Is national
death, race death a sin for which
there is no atonement a sin which is
the more dreadful exactly In propor
tion as the men and women guilty
thereof are in other respects, in char
acter, and bodily and mental powers,
those whom for the sake of the state
it would be well to see the fathers
and mothers of many healthy children,
well brought up in homes made happy
by their presence. No man, no woman,
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for lovo of ease and pleasure,
or for any other cause, and retain his
or her self-respect.
The president asks for the enactment
into law of a shipping bill that will place
American interests on the seas on a par
with those of other countries, and urges
especially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present, currency
laws are asked for, and after showing
that present laws are inadequate because
of tho wide fluctuation of interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system is seri
ously defective. There is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed changes must iio ruled
from consideration because they are
complicated, are not easy of compre
hension, and tend to disturb existing
rights and interests. We must also
rule out any plan which would ma
terially Impair the value of the United
States two per cent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, the Issue of
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press any special plan. Various
plans have recently been proposed by
expert committees of bankers. Among
the plans which are possibly feasible
and which certainly should receive
your consideration is that repeatedly
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secretary of the treasury, the es
sential features of which have been
approved by many prominent bankers
and business men. According to this
plan national banks should be per
mitted to issue a specified proportion
of their capital in notes of a given
kind, the issue to be taxed at so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted In legitimate trade. This
plan would not permit the issue of
currency to give banks additional
profits, "nut to meet the emergency pre
sented by times of stringency.
Need of Automatic System.
"I do not say that this is the right
system. 1 only advance it to empha
size my belief that there is peed for
the adoption of some system which
shall be automatic and open to all
sound banks, so as to avoid all pos
sibility of discrimination and favorit
ism. Such a plan would tend to pre
vent the spasms of high money and
speculation which now obtain in the
New York market for at present
there is too much currency at certain
seasons of the year, and Its accumu
lation at New York tempts bankers
to lend it at low rates for speculative
purposes whereas at other times when
the crops are bing- moved there is
urgent need for a large but temporary
increase in the currency supply. It
must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business men gen
erally quite as much as bankers es
pecially is this true of stockmen,
farmers and business men in the west
for at present at certain seasons of
the year the difference in Interest
rates between the east and the west Is
from six to ten per cent., whereas in
Canada the corresponding difference is
but two per cent. Any plan must, of
course, guard the interests of west
ern and southern bankers as carefully
as it guards the interests of New York
or Chicago bankers and must be
drawn from the standpoints of the
farmer and the merchant no less than
from the standpoints of the city
banker and the country banker.
The law should be amended so as to
specifically to provide that the funds de
rived from customs duties may be treat
ed by the secretary of the treasury as
he treats funds obtained under the in
ternal revenue laws. There shoved be
a considerable increase in bills ofTsmall
denominations. Permission should be
given banks, if necessary under settled
restrictions, to retire their circulation to
a
larger amount than $3,000,000 a month."

Naturalization of Japs.
President Roosevelt scores San Fran
cisco and other Pacific coast cities for
their treatment of the Japanese, and
makes the following recommendations:
Our nation fronts on the Pacific, Just
as it fronts on the Atlantic. We hope
to play a constantly growing part in
the great ocean of the orient. We
wish, as we ought to wish, for a great
commercial development In our deal
ings with Asia and it is out of the
question that we should permanently,
have such development unless we free
ly and gladly extend to other nations
the same measure of Justice and good
treattient which we expect to receive
in renirn. It is only a very small body
of our citizens that act badly. Where,
the federal government has power it
will deal summarily with any such.
Where the several states have power
I earnestly ask that they also deal
wisely and promptly with such con
duct, or else this small body of wrong
doers may bring- shame upon the groat
mass of .their, innocent and right
thinking fellows—that is. upon our
.nation as a whole. Good manners
should be ap international no lesS than
an individual attribute. I ask fair
treatment for the Japanese as I wouldi
ask, fair treatment for Germans or
Englishmen, Frenchmen. Russians oil
Italians. I ask it as due to liumanity.
and civilization. I ask it as due to
ourselves been use we must act up
rightly toward all men.
"I recommend to the congress that
an act be passed specifically provdiug for
the naturalization of Japanese who come
here intending to become American cit
izens. One of the great embarrassments
attending the performance of our in
ternational obligations Is the fact that
the statutes of the United States gov
ernment are entirely inadequate. They
fail to give to the national government
sufficiently ample power, through United
States courts and by the use of the
arrfiy and navy, to protect aliens in the
rights secured to them under solemn
treaties which are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal and civil statutes of the
United States be so amended and added
to as to enable the president, acting for
the United States government, which is
responsible in our international rela
tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un
der treaties. Even as the law now
something can be done by the federal
government toward this end, and in the
matter now before me affecting the Jap
anese. everything that it is in mv power
to do will be clone, and all of the forces,
military and civil, of the United States
which 1 may lawfully employ v.-lll be
so employed. There should, however, b«
no particle, of doubt as to the power 08
the national government completely te
perform and enforce its own obligation!
to other nations. The mob of a singly
city may at any time perform acts oj
lawless violence against some class o\
foreigners which would plunge us into
war. The city by itself would" be power-,
less to make defense against the for
eign power thus assaulted, and If inde
pendent of this government it would
never venture to perform or permit th«v
performance of the acts complained of.
The entire power and the whole duty to
protect the offending city or the offend
ing community lies in the hands of the
United States government. It is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy under which a given locality may be
allowed to commit a crime against a
friendly nation, and the United St-ttes
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, but, in the
last resort, to defending the people who
have committed it against the conse
quences of their own wrongdoing,"
Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion in Cuba and the inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
the provisional government is reviewed,
and the president says:
"When tli" ejection has been held and
the new government inaugurated in
peaceful and orderly fashion of the piovh
slonul government will i-onio to an end..
I take this opportunity of expressing
uijon behalf of the American people,,
with all possible solemnity, our most:
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize the imperative need of pre
serving justice an.l keeping order in thai
island. The United States wishes noth
Ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper
morally and materially, and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save that they shall
be ablo to preserve older among them
selves and therefore to preserve their
Independence. If the elections become a!
farce, and If the insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed In the Island, It Is ab
solutely out of the question that tha
island should continue Independent and
tlic United States, which has assumed
the sponsorship before the civilized world
for Cuba's career as a nation, would'
again have to intervene and to see that
the governme.nt was managed in such
orderly fashion as to secure the safety
of life and property. The. path to be'
trodden by those who exercise self-gov
ernment is always hard, and we should
have every charity and patience with tha
Cubans as they tread this difficult parth.
1 have the utmost sympathy with, anil
regard for, them but I most earnestly
adjure them solemnly to weigh their re
sponsibilities and to see that when thcln
new government is started it shrill run!
smoothly, and with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on the one hand,
and from insurrectionary disturbances on
the other."
Considerable sjjjycc is devoted to Ilia
international conference of American re
publics and the visit of Secretary Root!
to South America, and points to the fact
that our efforts In behalf of the nations
of that country are appreciated by them.
On the subject of the Panama canal he
promises a special message in the near
future.
The Army and Navy.
The message closes with a plea for
the maintenance of the navy at its presj
ent standard, to do which he says wouldt
mean the building of one battleship each
year. Of the present efficiency of the
army and navy he says:
"The readiness and efficiency of both tha
army and navy In dealing with the re
cent sudden crisis in Cuba Illustrate*
afresh their value to the nation. This
readiness and efficiency would have been
very much less had it not been for tho
existence of the general staff In the army
and the general board In the navy botni
are essential to the proper development)
and use of our military forces afioat and!
nshore. The troops that were sent toi
Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was
the swiftest mobilization and dispatch of
troops over sea ever accomplished by
our government. The expedition landed
completely equipped and ready for Im
mediate service, several of its organiza
tions hardly remaining in Havana over
night before splitting up into detach
ments and going to their several posts.
It was a fine demonstration of the valor
and efficiency of the general staff. Sim
ilarly, it was owing in large part to th»
general board that the navy was able
at the outset to meet the Cuban crisis
with such instant efficiency ship after,
ship appearing on the shortest notice at
any threatened point, while the marine
corps in particular performed indispens
able service. The army and navy war
colleges are of incalculable value to the
two services, and they cooperate with
constantly increasing efficiency and im
portance.
"The congress has most wisely provided
for A national board for the promotion,
of rifle practise. Excellent results have
already come from this law. but it does
not go far enough. Our regular army
Is so small that in any great war we
should have to trust mainly to vol
unteers and in such event these volun
teers should already know how to shoot
for if a soldier has the fighting edge,
and ability to take care of himself in
the open, his efficiency on the lino of
battle is almost directly proportionate to
excellence in marksmanship. We should
establish shooting galleries in all the
large public and military schools, should
maintain national target ranges in differ
ent parts of the country, and should in
every way encourage the formation of
rifle clubs thruout all parts of the land.
The little republic of Switzerland offers
us an excellent example In all matters
connected with building up an efficient
citizen soldiery.
