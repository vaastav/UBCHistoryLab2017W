ALF ALES YOUNG EDITOR
t TH PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
I t The Presidents message is at last be
I t j fore the people I is somewhat lengthy
a thins necessary in such documents
The document is straightforward and
statesmanlike and treats all subjects
touched upon in u most comprehensive
LT manner Americans in the peace and
security of their prosperous and happy
i home1 l are apt at times t think that our
country is isolated and far removed from
the world The reading of a Presidential
I message dispels all such ideas for then
we see that we are intimately connected
I with the nations of the earth From the
strifes and ambitions of the nations of the
earth we are happily isolated and no
I greater blessing can ever be vouchsafed
the United States than acontinuation of
t such isolation
President Cleveland has sought to
impress upon Congress and the country
the wisdom of continuing that policy
L which will save us from entangling
alliances j this it is not necessary
that the Me doctrine be abandoned
or that it be bo distorted as to put upon
t the United States the burden of guarantee
ing the ob jations of every nature of
distant and evolutionary countries The
discussion jver the Isthmus lines of I
tj I transit during the past year have given
II I I rise t many false theories regarding the
I rights and duties of the American Gov
I ernment Thc sident has given no
encouragement 0 any such false notions
1 but he calls the people back to the true
and salutary < k ii of Monroe when
he says Our uuty the present
instructs urf to t ir < s ourselves
mainly to the develop nt of the vast
resources of the great sea committed
to our charge and to the cultivation
f of the arts of peace within our borders
though jealously alert in prevsnting the
American hemisphere from being in
I volved in the political problems and com
plications of distant govcrMruits I a
transIsthmian canal or ship railway is to
be constructed it should be for the bene
fit of the world and far removed from
the chance of domination by any one
single Power
The message shows that the relations
I of the Government t foreign Powers are
eminently satisfactory This is so com
i mon a thing with the United States that
the people fail t realize its full signifi
cance Even with China the relations of
the Government are most cordial
although the treatment which the subjects
of that country have received here during I
the past few months has been such that
r it might very easily have brought about
a rupture between the Government of
r Pekin and the Government of Washing
ton For this cordial relationship a
much credit is due China as the United
Stats The reTerence to theKielv affair
4 is dignified and such as to receive the
approbation of all
Among other matters we may mention
i is that part of the message which refers
to the naturalization laws laws of which
1 advantage has too often been taken for
unworthy purposes and without any in
tention on the part of those who take ad
vantage of them of becoming bona fide
t citizens It is this that has broughtabout
f the trouble in Germany over naturalized
t II Americans of German birth The natu
I ralization laws need amendment in vari
ous ways as pointed out by the President
I The matter of extradition is also an
I important one and to which
one atten
tion should be given immediately The
facility with which embezzlers and de I
faulters escape punishment by a trip
c t Canada is I scandal upon our
diplomacy In antebellum days
in the days when the country
I was a seething cauldron on ac
count of the slavery question
Canada was a haven of rest for the
colored refugee and an asylum for the
oppressed Today she is a place of
safety for the unworthy and the criminal
Extradition treaties should remedy this
state of affairs The recommendations
in regard to the consular service are wise
and timely and the recommendations in
regard thereto should receive the favor
able consideration of Congress One
recommendation in particular is right
i and timely We refer to the recommen
dation that the duty on the paintings of
r foreign artists be removed The policy
of discontinuing the appointment of civil
sans to lieutenancies in the army is wise
and proper His discussion of the silver
question is both thorough and from the
right standpoint and the conclusion he
reaches in regard to a discontinuance of
an enforced coinage of silver correct as
we look at the matter I isa knotty
question and one that requires more exact
knowledge and a fuller appreciation of
the laws of trade and com nerce than al
most any other question The question
very nearly approaches true science and
to decide one way or the other requires i
the most exact and logical reasoning I
is the foremost question of peace i all
1 commercial
eommercal countries
l subjects touched upon are ably
treated and show ajjreadth of view on
the part of the President that gives great
hope for the future prosperity and welfare
of the country and shows that the coun
try has not misplaced its confidence I
shows the President to be the true suc
cessor of the great men among his prede
cessors All who have filled the place
he now occupies have not been great
men Ho is hut beginning his career in
a field where greatness can find its fullest
play and i the close of that career shall
be as auspicious and happy as its begin
ning then it will bo one of which the
American people may well feel proud
and will place Mr Cleveland in the front
rank statesmen

UTAH IN THE MESSAGE
The space which Utah occupies in the
Presidents messagejs considerable and
the President has treated of Utah and
polygamy in the same comprehensive
and conservative manner that he has
treated all other matters No specific
recommendations are made although the
President says lie shall be glad to approve
such further discreet legislation as will
rid the country of polygamy What
would constitute discreetlegislation as
contitt discreetlegslaton a
understood by the President can only be
known when bills affecting Utah are sub
mitted to the President for his signature
and he approves or disapproves them
The man who is in the midst of the I
fight does not see so clearly how it is
going as one who watches it from afar
So it is with people in Utah and all par
ties engaged in the conflict in Utah have
their eyes more or less clouded by pas
sion and prejudice But there is some
chance t estimate how goes the bat I
tie even in Utah Look at the field
look at the parties and their respective
positions Every stand that the Gov
ernment has taken in regard to the
enforcement of the Edmunds law and the
suppression of polygamy has been main
tained Not so with those who have
been violating the Edmunds law From
a bold and open defiance of Congress
and the laws of the land they went to the
President with a muling puking petition
and the pretensions of divine right sank
into an insignificant request for an impar
tial enforcement of the laws I has been
clearly demonstrated that men can be
convicted under the Edmunds law for
men are now suffering imprisonment for
violating that law That the evidence in
these cases is difficult to obtain is true
I I is difficult t obtain because of the gen
eral sympathy which violators of the Ed
munds law receive from the great major I
ity of the people of Utah So long as I
this sympathy exists it will always be
more or less difficult to obtain evidence
in prosecutions for polygamy or unlawful
cohabitation and this will be the case
no matter what laws may be enacted for
the suppression of polygamy
Many radical measures have been advo
cated for the solution of the Utah question
Within a week martial law has been ad
vocated for Utah but martial law would
in nowise solve the Utah question
Martial law would prevent any organized
outbreak but we do not think there is
any danger of such aa outbreak Neither
would martial law make the lives of the
citizens secure from the attack of the
assassin On the contrary y martial law
would be an invitation to the assassin
The enactment of any of the recommen
dations of the Utah Commission would
not be a solution of the question because
the adverse conditions which exist in
Utah today would continue after there
had been a complete revolution in politi
cal affairs That which all who have
any sincere desire to see the Territory
happy and prosperous and < jn harmony
with the rest of the country wish to see
is the removal of the adverse conditions
with which the Territory is troubled To
establish martial law or to institute a
Legislative Commision would not be
ipso facto a solution of the Utah question
The question whether the one or the
other of these radical remedies would
hasten the solution of the problem
and bring about that condition of things
which all lovers of the country
so ardently desire still remains
Are not these radical remedies more lia
ble to delay theday of Utahs redemp
tion than to hasten it I is this appre
hension this wellfounded apprehension i
which makes so many hesitate to give I
any countenance to such remedies as
well as their dislike to such a radical I
departure from the true principles of re
publican government
We believe the solution is now going
on but that it may finally be accom
plished there should be as the President
says Uno relaxation in the firm but just
execution of the laws now in operation I
Ally such relaxation at the present or at I
any future time would be looked upon by
the violators of the Edmunds law as an I I
encouragement and invitation to a further
violation of the law The evil under I
which Utah suffers is already great and I
all efforts of the Government should be
to make it less while everything which
would in any way give the violators of
the law hope or encouragement should be
avoided I
THE RUMORS
Tho City Council have brought their
investigation into the rumors which were
afloat the past few days to a close Some
of the reports which gained currency and
credence were of a most wild and im
probable nature although we have good
reason for believing that some of them
and these the most absurd too were
believed at first by some of the Council
who were most prominent in the investi
gation The resolution which was adopted I
does not carry the weight it should and
while it does not contain anything actu
ally false it ignores majiy facts and does I
not state the actual situation Whether
the Federal officials circulated the rumors
falsely and for a pernicious purpose as
intimated in the resolution and a Coun
cillor Junius F Wells desired to specifi
cally say in the resolution we specfI
know An undue credence may have
been given to these various rumor
by some of the Federal officials but 1
certain it is that they erred no more as t
the true condition of affairs than the City
Council have in the resolutions adopted
i
by them It is possible that the City
Counci do not think there is any excite I
i ment at all in Utah but of the pure and
peaceful state of mind which can induce
such thoughts we know nothing One
good will come out of all these rumors I
and their investigation it will help t
bring the people here to a realization of the I
condition of affairs in Utah and
afairs Uth perhaps I I
make them pause and think about where
their cousre of lawlessness leading them
The holding in readiness of some thou
sands of troops to send to Utah in case of
any emergency together with the sending
of a battery will serve as an object lesson I
t the people of Utah to remind them
that Utah is in the United States and not t
the United States in Utah This fact has
been largely overlooked I

The fact that our revenues are in excess
of the actual needs of an economic ad
ministration of the Government justifies
a reduction in the amount exacted from
the people for its support Our Govern
jnent is but the means established by the
will of a free people by which certain
principles are applied which thev have
adopted for their benefit and prothction
and it is never better administered and I
its true spirit is never better observed
than when the peoples taxation for its
support is scrupulously limited to the
actual necessity of expenditure and dis
tributed according to a just and equitable I
plan
The proposition with which we have to
deal is the reduction of the revenue re
ceived by the Government and indirectly
paid by the people from customs duties
The question of free tradeis not involved
nor is there now any occasion for the gen
I eral discussion of the wisdom or ex
pediency a protective system Justice
and fairness dictate that in any modifica
tion of our present laws relating to
revenue the industries and interests
which have been encouraged by such
laws and in which our citizens have large
investments should not be ruthlessly in
jured or destroyed We should also deal I
with the subject in such a manner as to
protect the interests of American labor
which is the capital of our workingmen
I Its stability and proper remuneration
furnish the most
furish justifiable pretexts for a
protective policy Within these limita
tions a certain reduction having been
determined the inquiry follows where I
can it best be remitted and what articles
artices
can best be released from duty in the in
I terest of our citizens I thiiik the reduc
tion should be made in the revenue de
rived from a tax upon the imported neces
saries of life We thus directly lessen
the cost of living of every family in the
land and release to the public in every
home a larger measure of the rewards of

TIE NATIONAL BANKS
During the year ended November 1st
18514 National Banks were organized
with an aggregate capital of 16937000
and circulating notes have been issued to
t
them ameunting to 4274910 The II
whole number of these banks in exist
ence on the day abovementioned was
2727 The very limited amount of cir
culating notes issued
culting by our National
banks compared with the amount the
law permits them to issue upon a deposit
of bonds for their redemption indicates
that the volume of our circulating medium
may be largely increased through their
instrumentality
THE SILVER QUESTION
Nothing more important than the
present condition of our currency and
o nage can claim your attention Since
February 1878 the Government has
I under the compulsory provisions of law I
purchased silver bullion and coined the j
same at the rte of more than 2000000
I every month By this process up to the
present date 215759431 in silver dollars
have been coined siver dolars
ben A reasonable
appro
priation or a delegation of power to the
General Government would limit its ex
ercise without express restrictive words
I to the peoples needs and the require
I ments of the public welfare Upon this
I theorythe authority to coin money
I givua uongress oy tne Constitution if it
I permits the purchase by the Government
of the bullion for coinage in any event
I does not justify such purchase and coin
age to an extent beyond the amount
I needed for sufficient circulating medium
I The desire to utilize the silver product of
the country should not lead to a misuse
or the perversion of this power The
necesity for such an addition to the silver
currency of the nation as is compelled by
THE SILVER COINAGE C
Is negatived by the fact that up to the
present time only about 50000000 of sil I
ver dollars so coined have actually found
their way into circulation leaving more <
mor
than 165000000 in possession of the Gov
ernment the custody of which has en
tailed a considerable expense for ion
I struction of vaults for its deposit Against
this
j latter amount there are outstanding
silver certificates amounting to about
93000000 Every month 2000000 of
gold in the public treasury is paid out for
2000000 or more of silver dollars to be
added to the idle mass already accumu
lated I continued long enough this
operation will result in the substitution of
substtution
silver fof all the gold the Government
owns applicable to its general purposes
It will not do to
I wi rely upon the receipts of
the Government to make good this de
cline of gold because of the thi thus de
coined
having been made legal l tender
for all debts and dues public and private
At times prvate
time during the last six months 58
per cent of the receipts for duties have
been in silver certificates while the aver
ag within that period has been 20 per
cent The proportion of silver and its

I
will probably increase as time goes on
for thereason that the nearer the period
approaches when it will be obliged to
offer
SILVER I PAYMENT OF ITS OBLIGATIONS
The greater the inducement there will be
to hoard gold against a depreciation in
the value of silver or for the purpose of
speculation This hoarding of gold has
already begun When the time comes
when the gold shall have been withdrawn
from circulation then will be apparent
the difference between the real value of
the silver dollar and a dollar jn gold and
the two coins will part company Gold
I being still the standard of value and nec
essary in our dealings with other coun
tries will be at a premium over silver
The banks which have substituted gold
for the deposits of their customers may
pay them with silver bought with such
gold thus making a handsome profit
RICH SPECULATORS WILL SELL THEIR
HOARDED GOLD
To their neighbor whoneed it to liquidate
their foreign debts at a ruinous premium
over silver and the laboring men and
women of the land the most defenseless
of all will find that the dollar receiyed
for the wages of their toil has sadly
I shrunk in its purchasing power I may
be said that the latter result will be but I
I temporary and that ultimately the price
of labor will be adjuste to the change
but even i this takes place the wage
I I maker cannot possibly gain but must
inevitably lose sincete price he is com
I polled to pay for his living will not only
> be measured in a coin heavily depreciated
I i and fluctuating and uncertain in its value
j but this uncertainty in the value of the
purchasing medium will be made the
pretext forAN
AN ADVANCE IN PRICES
eyond that justified by actual deprecia
tion
tionThe
The words uttered in 1834 by Daniel
Webster in the Senate of the United
States are true today The very man
or all others who has the deepest Interest
in a sound currency and who suffers
most by mischievous legislation in money
matters is the man who earns his daily
bread by his daily toil J The most dis
tinguished advocate of bimetallism dis
cussing our silver coinage has lately writ
ten American citizens hand has
yet felt the sensation of cheapness either
in receiving or expending the silver act
dollars and those who live by labor or
legitimate trade never wH feel that sen
sation of cheapness however plenty the
silver dollars may become They will
not be distributed as gifts amongthe
distiQuted a gis among peo
ple and if the laboring man should re
ceive four depreciated dollars where he
now receives but two he will pay in the
depreciated coin more than double the
price he now pays for all the necessaries
and comforts of life 1 Those who do not
fear any disastrous consequences arising
from
THE CONTINUED COMPULSORY COINAGE OP
SILVER
As now directed by law and who suppose
that the addition to the currency of the
country intended as its result will be a
public benefit are reminded that history
demonstrates that the point is easily
reached in the attempt to float at the
same time two sorts of money of different
ratios of excellency when the better will
cease to be in circulation The hoarding
of gold which has already taken place
indicates that we shall not escape the I
usual experience in such cases So i
this silver coinage be continued we may
reasonably expect that gold and its equiv
alent will abandon the field of circulation
to silver alone This of course must pro
duce a severe contraction of our circulat I
ing medium instead of adding to it I
will not be disputed that any attempt on
the part of the government to cause the
circulation of
THE SILVER DOLLAR WORTH 86 CENTS
Side by side with gold dollars worth 100
cents even with the limit that legislation
does not run contrary to the laws of trade
to be successful mnst be seconded by the
confidence of the people that both coins
will retain the same purchasing power
and be interchangeable will
A special effort has been made by the
Secretary of the Treasury to put an
amount of our silver cpi in circulation
but the fact that a large share of the lim
lied amount thus put out has soon return
ed t the public treasury in payment re of
duties leads to the belief that the people
do not now desire t keep it in hand and
this with the evident disposition to hoard
gold gives rise to the suspicion thatthere
already exists a lack of confidence among
the people touching our financial
fnancial pro
cesses There is ceitainly
NOT ENOUGH SILVER NOW IN CIRCULATION
To cause nneasiness and the whole
amount coined and now on hand might
after a time be absorbed by the people
without any apprehension but it is the I
ceaseless stream that threatens to over
flow the land which
fow causes fear and un
certainty What has been thus far sub
mitted upon this subject relates almost
entirely to a consideration of a home
nature unconnected with the bearing
which the policies of other nations have
upon the question but it i is perfectly ap
perecty
parent that a line of action in regard ap
our currency cannot wisely be settled
upon or persisted in without considerfng
the attitude on the subject of other
countries with whom we maintain inter
course through commerce trade and
travel An acknowledgment of the fact
is found in the act by virtue of which our
s lver is compulsory coined I provides
that the President shall invite the governments
ments of
THE COUNTRIES COMPOSING TIE LATIN
UNION
So called and of such other European
nations as he may deem advisable to
join the United Stats In a conference to
adopt a common ratio between gold and
silver for the purpose of establishing in I
ternationally use bimetallic money I
and securing a fixity of relative value l > e I
tween m these metals u 1
xnis conference absolutely failed and
a similar fate has awaited all subsequent
efforts in the same direction and still we
continue our coinage of silver at a ratio
different from that of any other nation
The most vital part of the silver coinage
act remains inoperative and unexecuted
and without an ally or friend we battle I I
upon the silver field in an illogical and
losing contest y To give full effect to the I
design of Congress on this subject I have I
made a careful and earnest endeavor I
since the adjournment of the last Con
gress To this end I delegated a gentle
man well instructed in fiscal science to
proceed to the financial centers of Europe
and in conjunction with our ministers t
England France and Germany to obtain
a full knowledge of the attitude and in
tent of those governments respecting the
establishment of such an international I
ratio as will
rto a wi procure
FREE COINAGE OF BOTH METALS
At the mints of those countries and our
own By my direction our ConsulGen
eral at Paris has given close attention to i
i
the proceedings of the Congress of the
Latin Union in order to indicate our
indete
actions interests in its objects and report its j I
I I may be said in brief a the result of
these efforts that the attitude of the lead I
ing powers remains substantially un
changed t since the monetary conference 1
ot 18S1 nor is it to be questioned that the
views of these governments are in each I
instance separated by the weight of public
opinion The steps thus taken have
therefore only more fully demonstrated I
the uselessness of further attempts at I
present t arrive at any agreement on

the subject with other nations In the
meantime
WE ARE ACCUMUIATTNG SILVER COIN
Btsed upon our own peculiar ratio to such
an extent and assuming so heavy a bur
den to be provided forin any internation
al as will render usan unde
sirable party to any future monetary
conference of nations I
It is a significant fact that four of the i
five countries composing the Latin Union
mentioned in ourcoinage act embarrass I
ed with their silver currency have just
completed an agreement among them
selves that no more silver shall be coined
by then governments and that such a
has already been coined and is in circula
tion shall be redeemed in gold by the
country of its coinage The resort to this
expedient by these countries may well
arrest the attention of those who suppose
we can succeed without a shock or in
jury in the attempt to circulate upon its
merits all the silver we may coin under
the provisions of our silver coinage act
THE CONDITION IN WHICH OUR TREASURY
MAY BE PLACED
By a persistence in our present course is
a matter of concern to every patrotic
citizen who does not desire his Govern
ment to pay in silver such of its obliga
tions as should bepaid in gold norshpuld
our condition be such as to oblige us in a
prudent management of affairs to discon
tinue the callingin and payment of
interestbearing obligations which we
have the right now to discharge and thus
avoid the payment of further interest
thereon
The socalled debtor class for whose
benefit the continued compulsory coinage
of silver is insisted upon are not dish n
est because they are in debt and they
should not be suspected of a desire to
jeopardize the financial safety of the
country in order that they may cancel
their present debts by paying the same
in depreciated dollars nor should it be
forgotten that it is not the rich nor the
moneylender alone that must submit to
such a readjustment enforced by the
government and their debtors The
pittance of the widow orphanand the
incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all
kinds would be disastrously reduced
reduced
THE DEPOSITORS IN SAVINGS BANKS
And other institutions which hold in trust
the savings of the poor when their little
accumulations are scaled down to meet
the new order of things would in their
distress painfully realize the delusion of
their promise made to them that plentiful
money would improve their conditions
We have now on hand all the silver
dollars necessary to supply the present
need of the people and to satisfy those
who from sentiment wish to see them in
circulation and i their coinage is sus
pended they can readily obtained by
those who desire them I the need of
more is at any time apparent their coin
age may be resumed That the disaster
has not already overtaken us furnishes
no proof that danger does not wait upon
a continuation of the present silver coin
age We have been saved by the most
careful management and unusual expedi
ents by a combination of fortunate con
ditions and by a confident expectation
that the commerce of the Government in
regard to silver coinage would be speedi
ly changed by the action of Congress
PROSPERITY HESITATES UPON OUR THRESH
nnTn
Because of the dangers surrounding this
question Capital timidly shrinks from
trade and investors are unwilling to take
the chance of the questionable shape in
which their money will be returned to
them while enterprise halts at the risk
against which care and sagacious man
agement do not protect As a necessary
consequence labor lacks employment and
suffering and distress are visited upon a
portion of our fellow citizens especially
entitled to the careful consideration of
those charged with the duties of legisla
tion No interest appeals to us so strongly
for a safe and stable currency as the vast
army of unemployed I recommend the
suspension of the compulsory coinage of
silver dollars directed m Tw tho law nnoaorl

such disaster was 2439 of whom 2428
were saved and only eleven lost Other
lives which were imperiled though not
by disasters to shipping were also
rescued and a large amount of property
was saved through the aid of this service

year was 82847443
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

Survey was during the last fiscal year

to exist in the management of this
bureau which led to a prompt

Since the bureau has been in new 1 I
hands an introduction

an application of business methods have ad

So faras
A FURTHER SUBVEi OF OUR COAST
Is concerned there seems to be a pro
priety in transferring that work to the
Navy Department The other duties now
in charge of this establishment if they
cannot be profitably attached to some
existing department or other bureau
should be prosecuted under law exactly
defining their scope and purpose and with
the
a careful discrimination between
scientific inquiries which may properly
be assumed by the Government and
those which should be undertaken by
State authorities or by individual enter
prises I i t be hoped that the report
of the Congressional committee hereto
fore appointed to investigate this and
other like matters will aid in the ac
subject complishment proper legislation this
THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR
Is herewith submitted The attention of
Congress invited to the detailed account
which it contains of the administration of
his department and his recommendations
and suggestions for the improvement of
the service
servce
The army consisted at the date of the
last consolidated returns of 2154 officers
and 24705 enlisted men i
The expenses of the departments for
the fiscal year ending June 30 1885 in
cluding 1316439406 for public works
and river and harbor improvements were
4585099954
Besides the troops which were dis
patched in pursuit of the small band of
Indians who left their reservation in
Arizona and committed murders and out
rages two regiments of cavalry and one
of infantr were sent last July to the In
dian Territory to prevent an outbreak
which seemed imminent They remained
to aid if necessary in the expulsion of
intruders upon the reservation who have
caused the discontentamong Indians
but the Executive proclamation warning
them to remove was complied with with
out interference
Troops were also sent to Book Springs in
Wyoming Territory after the massacre of
the Chinese thereto prevent further dis
turbances and afterwards to Seattle in
Washington Territory to avert a threatened
attack upon the Chinese laborers and do
mestic violence there In both cases the
mere presence of the troops had the desired
effect
Tt appears that the number of desertions
from the army have diminished but that
during the last fiscal year they numbered
2927 and one instance is given by the Lieu
tenantGeneral of six desertions of the same
recruit I am convinced that this number
of desertions can be much diminished by
better discipline and treatment but the pun
ishment should be increased for repeated
offenses These desertions might also be
reduced by lessening the term of the first
enlistment thus allowing adiscontented re
omit to contemplate a nearer discharge and
the army a profitable riddance after one
term of service A reenlistment would be
quite apt to secure a contented recruit and a
good soldier
The acting JudgeAdvocateGeneral re
ports that the number of trials by general
courtsmartial during the year was 2328 and
that 11851 trials tookplace before the gar
rison and regimental courts martial The
suggestion that probably more than half the
army have been tried for offenses great and
small in one year marwell arrest attention
Of course many of these trials before the
garrison regimental courtsmartial were
for offenses almost frivolous and there
should I think be a way devised to dispose
of these in a more summary and less incon
venient manner than by courtmartial If
some of the proceedings of courtsmartial I
which have had occasion to examine pre I
sent the ideas of justice which generally
prevail these tribunals I am satisfied that
they should be much reformed if the honor
and the honesty of the Army and Navy are
by then instrumentality to be vindicated
and protected
