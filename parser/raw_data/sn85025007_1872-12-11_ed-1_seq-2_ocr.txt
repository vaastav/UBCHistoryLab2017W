ALEXANDRIA. VA.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 187:1
There is a universal oom plaint of the unne
oessary length of the public documents?Na
tional and State, from the President's Message
down to the reports of the most inferior officers.
These "documents," as they are called, are
uot read by one in a thousand. The public
wait for the newspapers to put them in a small
er space, and to tell the substance of what they
contain. The truth is that very few men are
capable of the condensation of their views and
ideas?an art invaluable in many respects.
Some of them imagine that a long "report" is
a proof of their ability?when, in truth, it is
just the reverse. A tcorJy m;\n in a public
office, is generally an inferior mau. To say
what one has to say, in as few words as possi
ble, shows that more thought is taken of infor
mation then of mere words.
The difficulties iu Louisiana will shortly fat
investigated by the llouso of Representatives,
and the whole matter will come before theiu iu
this way. JLast week Mr. Boardman present
ed his credentials, signed by Warmouth, as a
Representative from the fourth Louisiana dis
trict, to fill a vacancy, and he was sworn ?u.
His competitor before the people was a Mr.
Lott, and who expects to receive in a day or
two credentials signed by Pinch back. He will,
of course, present them, and the committee on
elections will be charged with the investigation,
which will involve nearly all the questions aris
ing .out of the election last fall.
Bishop Gibbons, in the course of bis sermon, I
in Richmond, lasf Sunday, on the subject of
Education said that "it is not sufficient for a
boy to be acquainted with bouk-keeping and to
know how to balance an accouut. He must
learn also some spiritual book keepiog aud un
derstand how to balance his account daily be
tween his conscience and God. A child has to
put in practice daily not the rules of grammar
and arithmetic, hut also the commandments
of God and the virtue of a Chistian life. It is
only by the day study of these duties that he
cau learn to love and practice them."
The ceremonies attending the formal unveil
ing of the statue of the late Roger B. Taney,
Chief J ustiee of the United States, erected in
his honor by the Legislature of Maryland, took
place at Annapolis yesterday. S. Teaekle
Wallis, the Chairman of the Committee upon
its erection, made an eloquent address, eulo
gizing the character of the deceased jurist.
Gov. Whyte made an appropriate response, af
ter which the statue was unveiled. There was
present a large concourse of d'stinguised gen
tlemen from all parts of the Sf'ite.
In the Senate yesterday the Committee on
the Boston Relief bill reported that they were
equally divided upon the bill, and was accord
ingly put on the calendar. A bill appropriat
ing $15 .000 to remove a sunken wreck off Sandv
Hook, New York Harbor, was pas?ed. Mr.
Cooper presented a memorial from the South
ern Methodist Publishing Association praying
compensation for the use of their buildings at
Nashville by United States soldiers during the
war.
The Petersburg Index administer? a well
timed rebuke to the malignity of Harpers'
Weekly (Journal of Civilization), in which we
concur. "The Harpers' Weekly chose to be
ono of the bitterest, most unfair, and most mis
chievous among the journals of the country du
ring the last decade, losing no opportunity to
defame the South aud to deepen the hatred
felt towards Southern ideas and Southern peo
ple by many citizens of the Northern States,
and it still oontinue, its course."
It is nnderstood that the Supreme Court will
hear arguments in the case of the writ of pro
hibition asked for by Gov. Warmoth against
Judge Durell. It is sa;d that the argument
will ex parte be confined to Messrs. Ogden and
Phillips for Warmoth, no one appearing for
the United States. The impression seems to
be that the Supreme Court will refuse to issue
the writ. ____________
A strong desire is expressed to have the valu- j
able documents relating to the early history of
Virginia,now in the rooms over the State libra
ry in Richmond, and recently* arranged by Dr.
Palmer, printed and thus secured for future
use and reference. We wish the finances of the
State would permit a liberal appropriation
for that purpose.

j The commissioners appointed last May to
i make inquiry iuto the depredations committed
on the Texan i'rontier, have submitted their
report to the President. The report confirms
the accounts of the incursions of Mexican ma
rauders into the Statu of Texas. The Presi

and has determined to recommeud Congress to
take vigorous and uflvetual measures to put a
summary stop to those incursions.

What Next??The Port Jervis Tri-States
Union contains an announcement that is enough
to make one's hair stand ou end and every tooth
in his head to rattle a piean of terror on its own
account. It relates to a human phenomenon,
an inscrutable being with a portable heart, re
volving bowels and two sets of ribs. The writer
of the article in the P. J. T. S. U. has seen
this man, who can move his heart to any part
of the body at pleasure; ? "cause a revolving
motion of the bowels, both upward and down
ward, the abdomen undulating and resembling
the corrugating motion of a flag when disturbed
by the wind;" arrest the beating of his pulse
for sixty seconds, bend an iron bur by striking
it over his left arm, and many other awe-sti ik
ing things. lie has a brother six feet three
inches in height, who can contract himself un
til he is but three feet, three inches tall; and a
cousin who "can throw his left hip to his richt
side." This is dreadful!
Mysterious Death.?A few days ago Ben
jamin Coleman, a young maB who resides near
'Etna, Illinois, seven miles south of Mattooo,
called at the house of a near neighbor, Jlr.
Benjamin llvatt, and invited his daughter to
ride a short "distance in a buggy with him.
Miss Hyatt, who was a young lady of twenty
years, and bore a good character, complied
with his request and they started, but in a
short time Colercan returned with the dead
body of Miss Hyatt in the buggy. He first
stated that his horse had ruu off, throwing the
lady out and causing her death, but in conver
sation a few minutes afterward stated that
Miss Hyatt had jumped from the. buggy, aud
was killed by the fall. Coleman fled immedi
ately, and this circumstance, taken in connec
tion" with the variations in his versions of the
affair, has given rise to strong suspicious of
foul pley. An inquest is being held, and fur
ther facts may be developed.

HOARD OF ALDEllMEN.
The report ot' the Committee on Claims, le
commending the payuieut to Hugh Lathum,
ex-Mayor, of a sum of money expended by
him during his administration for special po
licemen, adopted by the Common Council,
coming op as the first busHiess,
Mr. Underwood, at- Mr. Simpson's suggos
tiou, moved that it lie on the table.
Mr. Johnson explained the action ol the
committee. They had put the ex-Mayor on
his oath, and as his sworn certificate was fur
nished, there was no doubt the sum could be
made by Mr. Latham in the courts, iu a prose
cution against the city.
Mr. Simpson (Mr. Markell in the chair)
said he desired the case to be properly under
st od, and proceeded to explain the claim as
due. growing out of the old feud betweeu Mr.
Latham and the Police Bead. lie thought
there was no occasion for the action ot Mr. L.
at that time, and but for the prudence aud
wisdom of the Council then, serious diffi
culty might, have occurred, i he action ol
Mr. L. was solely a a fatter of pride ou his
part, and was, ho thought, illegal. Fie hoped
it would lie on the table aud give time for
thought. His sympathies were entirely with
Mr. Latham, but his judgment, as a represen
tative of the people, was decidedly opposed to
the adoption of the report.
Mr. Johnson reiterated his belief that if Mr.
L. went to law for the claim in question, lie
could certainly gain the case, but
The report was laid on the table.
The report of the committee, recommending
a reduction in the assessment of the foundry
property, was opposed by Mr. French as de
stroying the financial basis of the city.
Mr. Markell thought that these claims
should have come in earlier?the year the as
sessment was made, aud he would offer a reso
lution to that effect.
The report, after further debate, was laid
on the table.
A resolution to award the contract for flag
ging to the lowest responsible bidder, was ob
jected to by
Mr. John?on, who thought it too indefinite;
in which opinion he was joined by
Mr. French, who was opposed to thi# whole
sale irresponsible expenditure, lie thought
the financial mat tors of this city eouid not be
safely managed if this sort ot thing was a!
lowed to go on.
The resolution was recommitted.
On the resolution on the subject of repairing
the sidewalks,
Mr. Johnson thought that if the Superin
tendent of Police would make a speciality of
this repairing, it would be a good plan and an
accommodation to property holders.
Mr. Market' thought that the proposition
would not answer, for these peonle don't want
to pay for these repairs, and will not do it.?
For the city to do it, wili be just what most of
the parties want.
Mr. Johnson thought this people more liber
al spirited than Mr. Marsell's remarks implied;
there would be no d''ficulty in collecting euch
accounts.
M r. Markell replied, showing that he thought
differently from the member from the 3d Ward.
Mr. Simpson, (Mr. Corse in the chair,) op
posed the resolution ou the ground that it was
illegal. The idea that property holders were
not responsible for thti repairing of the pave
ment at the corner of the street, outside their
property lines, wad prepus.erous, and ou his
motion the resolution was laid ou the table.
Mr. French offered a resolution authorizing
the purchase of a pair of steers and wagon for
the use of the city and especially for the use
of the Alms House and advocated it, stating
that the Superintendent of the Alms House
had said that he had sometimes to pay as much
as $1U per day tor ploughing.
Mr. Markell thought that the price fixed
(f 175) was too high.
Mr. French reported Mr. Stephenson as sav
ing that the oxen were well worth the money,and
besides it would be a help to a poor lady who
desired io sell the oxeu to assist in payiug taxes
due by her. The large part of the purchase
money would go as taxes. He did not suppose,
this Council would go to chaffering with the
noorold lady ou the subject of the price.
The resolution was adopted.
A resolution to annull the authority of the
committee to erect a small pox hospital, was
read, when
Mr. Johnson said that he was desirous that
the subject of a hospital for the use of sailors
and others should not be lost sight of. Much in
convenience was experienced here by the soa
fairing elass on account of there being no such
accommodation ami he offered a resolution
that plans be received for a marine hospital for
the city, which was adopted.
A resolution calling attention to the unsafe
condition of the old Belief Kugine house, was
objected to by
Mr. Johnson, who thought that somebody
outside of the Council ought to compose the
committee to examine this building, and offered
a resolution to that efL-ct, the committee to
report at the next meeting of Council.
Mr. French said that parsers by that building
were in hourly danger, lie would rather
amend by giving the Committee on Streets
power to act.
31r. Johnson thought the witnesses in this
case outfht to come from without the Council,
in case of litigation.
Mr. Markell thought it might be referred to
a committee of Council with power to call in a
jury of experts.
Mr. Johnson said that this business really
belonged to the Board of Health, who should
attend to it. The building was certainly dan
gerous.
It was suggested that the amendments would
delay action in the matter, so they were with
drawn and the case stood as at first, referred to
the Committee on Streets.
A communication from F. L. I3rockett object
ing to the grading and paving of Fairfax street,
between Queen and Princess was read, and dis
cussed by
Mr. Johnson, who claimed that it was not
the small but the large property holders who
objected to this work. He proceeded to advo
cate at length the laying of the communication
on the table. He characterized the proposition
to postpone this paving as coming from skin
flints aud moved that it lie on the table. So or
dered.
The Board then adjourned.
COMMON COUNCIL.
The Board assembled at Ilarmonie Hall
without fire last night. The attendance within
and without the bar was unusually good.
A communication from the Mayor was read
relative to the suspension of policeman James
Smith, which, on the motion of Mr. Hender
son, was laid over.
Another communication from the Mayor re
commending an appropriation for wood for the
poor was read, aud $500 appropriated for that
purpose; the wood to be furnished, on the mo
tion of Mr. Finn, by the lowest bidder.
Mr. Rock haviug presented a memorial for
gradine Gibbon street,
Mr. Eichbcrg said he was opposed to more
grading; the Council had done grading enough;
the streets recently graded were all impassible,
the work so far doue being useless; there was
now $13,000 in the treasury, and $30,000 to
be paid on the 1st day of January.
The resolution was, on tne motion of Mr.
Rischiell, laid on the table.
The Committee on the Codification of the
Laws reported that Win. F. Ctrne had been
employed to codify the laws of the city.
An application for a reduction <>f the assess
ment upon the old foundry property on I'itt
street, near Wilkes, 1'roui $j 000 t > $4,000
coming up,
Mr. Kisheill expressed the wi.-h that it was
valued at $10,000 as such assessments would
compel holders of useless property to dispose
of it so that manufacturers froui abroad could
locate here.
The application was referred.
Mr. Finn having introduced a resolution di
reeling the Committee on Streets to inquire
concerning the ownership of the railroad ou
Ileury street north of King,.
Mr. Kvaus said that he could give the infor
mation to the extent of saying that the road on
that street had been laid in ]Sfi5 by the U. !S.
government, and that Council had given the
Alexandria, Washington & Georgetown Rail
road a right of way over that street. The dis
pute now was whether that grant enured to the
benefit of the Alexandria and Washington
Railroad Company. It had cost about $50,000
to find out to whom it belonged, aud it had
not been found out yet. It was useless.to send
the committee on such a search.
Mr. I'inn said that he had offered the reso
lution at the request of sundry citizens of the
Third Ward, lie thought that the railroad
on Henry street belonged to the corporation.
Mr. Hughes saw no necessity for the inquiry;
it would cost a good sum and come to uotliiug.
He moved to lay the resolution o- the tabta.
which was lo-', and the re-o!ut on was agreed
to.
After waiting some time fur the Board of
Aldermen to convene in joint meeting, the
Council at 9 o'clock adjourned.

Injunction.?At the prayer of D. E. DaT
enport to have enjoined the sale of the Kail
road flats and fish bar plates, advertised to be
.void yesterday, and to have said property to
gether with the locomotive "Old Dominion,"
j turned over to hiui, Judge Underwood of the

A Railroad War.?The railroad men and

! and it was said that they were yesterday to hold
I a conference, which would decide whether we
are to have peace or war in this session of the
Legislature over railroad questions. The effort
was to effect a c improinisj of conflicting inter
ests, which if successful, would insuro peace.*
but if'uor would result in a tierce struggle in
the General Assembly over opposing interests
and schemes.?Richmond Whig.

Membership in Fire Companies.?The
attention of members o! fire companies is called
t) the fact that the law of the department re
quires a man to withdraw regularly from one
company bi'f.?re he can join another. I meution
this because 1 understand there is al least one
application pending before one of the com
panies. in which the applicant has already beeu
refused admission to another, for the reason
that he had not been properly dismissed from a
third, and it is even eaid that he was induced
to apply by an offer of gratuitous equipment.
Now, though certain of our city ufficialsare so
very punctilious that they caunot sit in a pub
lic body with a gentlemau whose manuc/s are
not to their taste, and we are, therefore, with
out the governing body which the State law
provides for the enforcement of our regulations,
it is hoped and believed that the good sense
and courtesy of the great majority in all the
companies will continue to execute them. Over
zealous people never benefit associations to
which they belong, and it, therefore, behooves
the thoughtful and law abiding men in the
company alluded to, to scrutinize, carefully,the
antecedents of all who seek to join them.

Old Folks' Convert ?Not the least satis
factory point in connection with the delightful
entertaiunieut at Sarepta Hall on Tuesday
night, is the proof afforded that Alexandria is
not gone, by a good deal. "She is not dead,nor
deaf, nor dumb." As an audience, our pro
found appreciations w^rc given to tho?>e who
had the energy to get up the treat and tho
ability and nerve to carry it through. Our
thauks are divided between the "belles cito
yennes" of our own city, who played so vigor
ous a part, and the visiting ladies and gentle
meo who made us wish we could chain them
and keep them with up. We cannot soon for
get the sweet notes of Robin Adair, Old Folks
at Home, The Mermaid's Evening Song, and
the numerous other very beautifully rendered
pieces. Our tearful sympathies will follow the
"Old 3Jau" in his fe bleu ess. (?) If Jerusha
did not "put the kettle ou," it was from no
lack of ability on Miss P 's part to give the
directions, which ehe certainly did in the hap
piest, most inimitable" and successful manner.

THE BEST PRESENT FOR A CHRIST
MAS GIFT IS A
WHEELER A WILSON
Family Sewing Machine.
The reputation of this Machine stands so high
in all parts of the world aay scarcely to need
comment.
They have been awarded the highest premi
ums in every important contest among Sewing
Machines in this country and in Europe.
They do all kinds of family work, from the
heaviest beaver and felt to the linoat silks, that
other machines will not stitch.
They work easily, rapidly, noiselessly, and
are not liable to get out of order.
Washington, D. C., April 80, lhT'i.
Having bought and used four oi your Wheel
er & Wilson Sewing Machines for the last sev
enteen years in my family, and to the entire
satisfaction and pleasure of every member there
of, we therefore cordially unite, from a sense of
duty, in recommending it to the public gener
ally as being the best, the easieot running, most
desirable and most durable Sewing Machine wo
have ever known.
My two little daughters when they wore
so small that their f*-et, when sitting on a chair,
would not reach the treadle, and were conse
quently obliged to stand on ono foot and run
the machine with the other, which they could
and did do right along, with perfect ease and
comfort. Both of them to day own one, and to
part with them would be like parting with a
aoar friend.
? I bought my Wheeler & Wilson seventeen
years ago, and during that time it ha.- nev??r
needed the least repairs, and is just a* good to
day, to all appearances, as it was when I lir*t
bought it.
Respectfully yours,
