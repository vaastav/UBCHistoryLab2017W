THIS PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
FOBKIQK ATTAIBS FIBST TSKATED.
To the Senate aud House of Representative
of the United States: It i* provided by tfc© oon
•titatios that the president Bhall from time to
time give congreu information of the state of
the Uuiou, and recommend to their considera
tion such measures aa he shall judge neoeaa&rv
and expedient in reviewing the events of the
year which has elapsed since the commence
ment of yoar session. I first call your atten
tion to the gratifying condition of our foreign
affairs. Oar intercourse with other powers has
continued to be of the most friendly character.
•Such slight differenoee as have arisen during
the year have been already Settled or are likely
to reach an early adjustment The arrest of
«itiseos of the United States in Ireland under
recent laws, which owe their origin to the dis
turbed condition of that' country, has led to a
somewhat extended correspondence with the
government ©f Great Britain, and a disposition
to respect our rights baa been Dracitically man
ifested by the release of the arrested parties.
Tbe claim of the nation in regard to the su
pervision and contro o# any tutsr-oosauic
canal across American isthmus has ooutiuued
to be the subject of conference. It is likely
that time will be Uioro powerful thau discus
sion in removing the divergence between the
two nations where friendship is so closely
oemented by the intimacy of their
relations and the community of their interests.
Our long established friendliness with Russia
has remained unbroken. It has prompted me
to proffer the earnest counsel of this govern
ment that measures be adopted for supiftess
ing the proscription which the Hebrew raoe in
that country has lately suffered. It has sot
transpired that any American oitizen has been
subjected to arreat or injury, but our cour
teous remonstrance has nevertheless been
courteously received. There is relief ia the
belief that the time is not far distant when
Russia wili be able to seoure toleration to all
faiths witnia her borders.
INTSBNATIOXAL CONFERENCE.
At an international convention held in Paris
in 1880 and attended by representatives of the
United States an agreement was reached in
respect to the protection of trademarks, pat
Sated article# and the rights of manufacturing
firms and corporations. The formulating into
treaties of the recommendations thus adopted
is receiving the attention wbioh it merits. The
protection of submarine cables is a aubjeot now
nnder consideration by an international con
ference at Paris. Believing that it is dearly
the true policy of this government to favor the
neutralization of this means of intercourse, I
requested our miuister in France to attend the
oonvention as a delegate. I also designated two
of our eminent scientists to atteud as repre
sentatives at the meeting of an international
committee at Pari* for considering the adop
tion of aoommon unit to measure electric force.
In view of the frequent ooourrenoo of confer
ences for the consideration of important mat
ters of oommon Interest to civilized nations, I
respectfully suggest that the executive be in
vested by oongress with discretionary power to
sand delegates to suoh conventions, and that
provision be made to defray the expenses inci
dent thereto. The difference between the
United States and Spain as to the effect of a
Judgment and certificate of naturalization has
not yet been adjusted, but it is hoped and be
lieved that the negotiations now in
progress will result in the establish
ment of the poeition wbioh seem to
this government so reasonable and just.
I have already oalled the attention of congress
to the faot that in the ports of Spain and Spanish
colonies, onerous fines have lately been im
posed upon vessels of the United States for
trivial technical offenses against local regu
lation*. Efforts for the abatement of thesis
exactions have thus far proved unaucdeSafuL
I regret to inform you alec tb&t the fees de
manded by Spanuh consuls in American ports
are in some 'Cases large, when oompared
with the value of the cargo, aa to amount in
effect to a considerable export duty,- and that
our remonstrances in this regard have not as
yet received the attention which they deserve.
The German government has invited the
United States to
"participate in au international
exhibition of domestic cattle, to be held in
Hamburg in 1883. If this country is to be
represented it is important tbat iu the early
4ays *f this mssion congress should make an
appropriation for tbat purpose. The death
of Mr. Marsh, our late minister to
Italy, has evoked from that govern
ment expressions of profound respect fot
his exalted character and for his honorable
career in the diplomatic service of his oountrv.
The Italian gotenftJMfit has raised a question
as to the propriety of recognizing in his dual
capacity the representative of this oountry rto
oently accredited both as seoretary cf legation
and &i consul general at Borne. He has been
received aa secretary, but bis exequater as
consul geaettl has thus far been withheld.
EXTBAD1TI0N.
Tbo extradition convention with Belgium
•which h»o boen in operation sinoe 1874 has
been lately supplanted by another. The senate
has si,'tiifieJ its approval and ratifications have
been c'.uly exchanged between the contracting
eount. ies. To the list of extraditable crimes
•has been added that of the assassination or
attempted assassination of the chief of the
state. Negotiations have been opened with
Switzerland, looking to a settlement by treaty
of the question whether its oitizeus can re
nounce their allegiance and beoome citizens of
the United States without obtaining permission
ot the Swiss governments I am happy to in
form' you that the immigration of paupers and
criminals from certain of the cantons oil
Switzerland has substantially oeased and
is no longer sanctioned by the authorities
The consideration of this subject next prompts
'be suggestion tbat the act of Aug. 3,1882,
which has for its objeot the return of foreign
convicts to their own oountry, should be so
modified as not to be open to the in
terpretation that it in any way effect*
the extradition of criminals on preferred
charges of crime. .The Ottoman porte has not
yet assented to the interpretation which this
government has put upon the treaty of 1830—
relative to its jurisdictional rights in Turkey.
It may well be, however, that this differenoe
will be adjusted by a general rovision of the
system of jurisdiction of the United States in
the countries of the East, and a subject to
which your attention has beon already
oalled by the seoretary of stata
In the interest of justice towards Chili and
Japan, I trust tbat the question of the return
of indemuity funds to the governments of
those countries will reaoh at the present
session the satisfactory solution whioh I have
already recommended and whloh has recently
been foreshadowed by congressional discus
sion. The treaty lately oouo'.uded with Coras
awaits the action of the senate. During the
late disturbance in Egypt the timely presencs
of Americau vessels served as a protection to
the persons and property of many of our own
citizens and of citizens of other countries
whose governments have expressed their
thanks for this assistance.
THE CHINESE QUESTION.
The recent legislation restricting Immigra.
tion of laboArs from (Jbina has given rise to
the question of whether Chinese proceeding to
or from another oountry may lawfully pass
through our own. In construing the sot of
May 6,1882, in connection with the treaty of
Nov. 7, 1880, the restriction would seem to
be limited to Chinese immigrants ooming to the
United States as laborers, and should not for
bid a mere transit across our territory. I ask
the attention of oongress to the subject for
anch action as it may deem advisable. This
government has reoently had occasion to man
ifest interest in the republio of Liberia by
seeking to «BI the amioabie settlement of the
boundary dispute now pending between that
're
public by the British possession of Sierra Leon.
The reciprocity treaty with Hawaii will become
terminable after Sept. 1883, on two months'
uotioe by either party. While oortain provi
sions of that oompaot may have proved oner
ous, its existence has fostered commercial re
lations whioh it is important to preserve. I sug
gest, therefore, that an early consideration be
given to suoh modifications of the treaty as
seem to be demanded by the interests of our
people. In view of our increasing trade with
both Hayii and Sau Domingo, I advise that
provision be made for diplomatic intercourse
with the latter by enlarging to scope of the
missiou. At Poriau Prinos I regret that
certain claims of American oitizens against the
government of Hayti have thus far been urged
uuavailiagly.
MEXTCO.
A recent agreement with Mexico provides for
the crossing of the frontier by the armed foroes
of either country in pursuit of Indiana Iu my
message of last yoar, I called attention to the
prevalent lawlessness on the borders, and to
the neoessity of legislation for suppression.
I again invite the attention of congress to the
subjoot. A partial relief from these mischiefs
has been sought iu a oonvention, which now
asks the approval of the senate, as does an
other touching the establishment of the inter
national boundary between the United States
and Mexico. If the latter is ratified, the action
of oongress will be required for establishing
suitable commissions of survey. The bound
ary dispute between Mexico and Guate
mala, which led this government to
proffer its friendly Counsels to both
parties, has been amioablv settled.
No oh&nge has occurred in our relations with
Venezuela I again invoke your aotion on the
matter of the pending awards against that re
public, to whioh referenoe was made by a spe
cial message from the executive at your last
session. Au invitation has been reoeived from
the government of Venezuela to send repre
sentatives in July, 18b3, to participate in the
oenteunial celebration of the birth of Bolivar,
the founder of South American independence.
In connection with the evnnt, it is designed to
commpuoe the crccctiou at Caraccas of a statue
of Washington, aud to conduct an industrial
exhibition, which will be open to American prod
ucts. I request thjkt the United ytates be repre
sent^!,aud that suitable provision be made for
the elevation of our mission in Central Amer
ica, the plenipotentiary rank of whioh
which was authorized by congress at its late
session and has been since effected.
CHILT, FKHU
AND
BOLIVIA.
The war between Peru aud Bolivia oo the
side, andUhili on the other, began more than
three years ago, on occupation by Chili in
1880 of all the littoral territory of Bolivia
Negotiations for peaoefnl settlement were con
ducted under the directions of the United
States. The allies refused to ooncede any
territory, but Chili has since becode master
of the whole coast of both countries, and of the
capital of Peru a ye&r sinoe,as you have already
been advised by-correspondence transmitted,
to you in January last This government sent
a special mission to the belligerent powers to
express the hope that Chili would be disposed
to accept a money indemnity for the expenses
of the war, and to relinquish he* demand for
a portion of the territory of hor antagonists.
This recommendation, which Chili declined to
follow, this government did not assume to en
force, nor can it be enforced without resort to
measures whioh would be in keeping neither
with the temper of our people, nor with the
spirit of our institutions. The power of Peru
no longer extends over its whole territory, and
in the event of our interference to diotate peace,
we would need to be supplemented by the army
and navy of the United States. Suoh inter
ference would almost inevitably lead to
the establishment of & proteotorate,
a result utterly eft odds with our past policy,
injurious to our present interests and full of
embarassmsnts for the future for the termina
tion of hostilities on terms at once just to the
victorious nation and generous to the adver
sary. This government has spared no efforts
save suoh as might involve the complications
which I have indicated It is greatly to be de
plored that Chili seems resolved to elaot such
rigorous conditions of pdade and indisposed to
submit to arbitration the terms of an amicable
settlement No peaoe is likely to be lasting
that ia not sufficiently equitable and just to
command the approval of other nations.
THE PB0P0SKD fcEACE OONOB8SS.
About a year since invitations ifrere extended
the nations of this continent to send represen
tatives to peaoo congresB to asaomble at
Washington in November, 1882. The time of
meeting was fixed at a period then remote In the
hope, as the invitation itself declared, that in
.he meantime the disturbances between South
American republic would be adjusted. As
taut expectation Beeiised Unlikely to be realized,
I asked, in April last, for an expression of
opinion from the two houses of congress as to
the advisability of holding a convention at the
time appointed. This aotiou was prompted in
part by doubts whioh mature reflection had
suggested whether tbe diplomatic usage and
traditions of the government did not make It
fitting that the executive should consult the
representatives of the people before pursuing
a line of policy somewhat novel in its character
f.nd far-reaching in its possible consequences.
In View of 'the fact that no action was taken
congress in the premises, and
no provision had been made for
the necessary expenses, I subsequently de
cided to postpone the oonvention and so
notified the .several governments which had
been invitee! to attend. 1 am unwilling to dis
miss thfii subject without assuring you. of my
support of any measures the wisdom of con
gress may devise for the promotion of peaoe on
this contenent and througout the world, and I
trust that the time is nigh wheUj with the uni
versal assent of Civilized people, all inter
national differenoee will be determined with
out resort to arms by the benignant process of
arbitration. Changes have occurred in the
DIPLOMATIC BCPBESEHTATION
of several foreign powers. During the past
year new ministers from the Argentine Beptib
lio, Austro-Hungary, BraMil, Chili, China,
Franoe, Jjipan, Mexioo, the Netherlands and
Prussia have presented then Credentials. thb
missions of Denmark and of Venezuela at
this c&pitoi ha*s been raised in grade. Switz
erland has created a plenipotentiary missiou
to this government, and an embassy from
Madagascar and a minister from Siam will
Bhortlv arrive. Our diplomatic intercourse
has been enlarged by the establishment of re
lations with the new kingdom of Servia, by the
oreatiou of a mission to Siam, and by the res
toration of a mission to Greece. The shah of
Persia has expressed his gratification tbat a
charge d'affaires will shortly be seut to that
oountry, where tho rights of on* citizen!) bate
been hitherto courteously guarded by
the representatives of Great Britain.
I renew my recommendation of suoh legisla
tion as will plaoe the United States in harmony
with other powers with reapeot to the inter
national rules for the prevention of collisions
at sea In oonformity with your joint resolu
tion of the 3rd of August last, I have directed
the secretary of state to address foreigu gov
ernments in teepeot to the proposed oonfer
enoe for considering the subjeot of
the universal adoption of a com
mon prime meridian^ to be used in
reckoning of longitude and the correction of
time throughout the civilized world. The re
plies will 1U due time be laid before yon
An agreement was reached at Paris in 1873,
between the principal powers for the inter
change of official publications, through the me
dium of their respective foreign departments.
The admirable system whioh has boen builtup
by the enterprise of the Smithsonian Institute,
affords a practical bads for our co-opperation
iu this scheme, and an arrangement has been
effected by whioh that institution will per
form the necessary labor under the direotion
of the department of state. A rea
sonable compensation therefor should
Uo provided for such sorvices. A
clause on the act making appropriations for
tho diplomatic and consular service contem
plates the reorganization of both bran olios of
licit service osi a salaried basis, leaving fees to
inure to tlie benefit of the treasury. Ior_
dially favor suoh a project as likely to oorr eot
abuses in the present system. Tho Bnoretary
of state will proseut to you at an early date a
plan for suoh reorganization.

SBDUCTION OF TAXATION.
You cannot fail to note with interest the dis
cussion by tbe seerotarjr as to the necessity of
providing by legislation some mode of freeing
the treasury of an exoess of resets in the event
that Congress faiia lo teach nn agreement for a
reduction of taxation. I heartily approve the
secretary's reoommendation of an immediate
and extensive reduction iu the annual revenues
of the government. It will be remembered
that 1 Urged Upon tho aotion of coiigreaa at its
last session th.b impoHahbe of relieving the in
dustry and enterprise of the country from the
pressuro of unneooBsarv taxation. It is
one of the truest maxims of political
eoonomy that all taxed are burdensome,
however wisely and prudently imposed} aud
though there has always been amoaz our peo
ple mJd differences of sentiment aa to the bast
methods of raising the national feVenues—and
indeed, as to the prinetpl8i upou V.-hioli taxa

ment. unato tne puDiic revenuos nave rar
exceeded that limit, and unless ohecked by
appropriate legislation such excess will con
tinue to increase from year to year. £or the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1881, the
eurplus revenue amounted to $100,000*000.
Fortiie fiacal year fcuded ootheStithof JUDO
lastthd surplus was more than $145,000,
000. The report of tbe seoretary shows what
disposition has beeti made of these moneys,
l^hoy have not only answered the requirements
Of the sinking fund, but have afforded a large
balance applicable to other reductions of the
public debt but I renew the expression of my
conviction that such rapid extinguishment of
the national indebtedness as is now taking place
is by no means cause for congratulation. It
is a cause, rather* for serious apprehension.
Jf it Continues it must speedily be followed by
one of the evil results ao clearly set forth in
the report of the seoretary. lather the sur
plus must lie idle in the treasury or the gov
ernment will be forced to buy at market rates
its bonds not then redeemable, aud Whioh, un
der sueb circumstances, cannot fail to. com
mand fenorinotis premium, or thb sftolleh rev
enues will be devoted to extravagant expend
iture, whioh, as experience has taught,
is ever the bane of an overflowing treasury,
It was made apparent in the oourse of the
animated discussion whioh tbe question
aroused at the last session of congress tbat the
policy of diminution of the revenue by reduc
ing taxation commanded the general approval
of members of both houses. I regret that be
cause of tbat oonfliot as to best method ih which
that policy should be made operative* none of
Its benefits hats beeh reaptML. Ihinlfliimeiit
of what 1 deem my constitutional duty, but
with little hope that I can make valuable con
tribution to this vexed question, I shall pro
ceed to intimate briefly my own views in rela
tion to it Upon tbe showing of our financial
oondition at the close of the last fiscal year, I
felt justified in recommending to oongress the
ABolitioN of INTEEMA! EEVENUfiS
except those Upon tobaefco in its Various forme,
and upon distilled spirits and fermented
liquors, and except also tbe special tat upon
tbe manufacturers and dealers in euoh articles.
I vefaturO now to suggest that,Unless it shail be
ascertained that the probable expenditures of
the government for the ooming year
have been underestimated, internal taxes,
save those which relate to distilled
spirits, oan be prudently abrogated.
Boob, accompanied by a simplification of the
maohinery or collection wbioh would theu be
easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be
expected to result in diminishing the cost of
suoh collection by at least $2,500,000, and in
the retirement from offioe of from 1,500 to
2,000 persons. The system of excise duties
has never commended Itself to. the favor of tbe
American people, and has never been resorted
to except for supplying deficiencies in the
treasury when bv reason of Bpeoial exigencies
the duties on imports have proved inade
quate to the ueeds of the government
The sentiment of the oountry doubtless com
mands tbat the present excise tax shall be
abolished as soon as euoh oourse can safely be
pursued. It seems to me, however, for vari
ous ressons, that so sweeping a measure as the
total abolition of internal taxes would, for the
present, be an unwise step. Two of these
reasons are deserving of special mention.
First—It is by no means clear that, even if
the existing system of duties ou imports is con
tinued without a modification of those duties,
they alone will yield euflioient revenue for all
the needs of the government. It is estimated
that $100,000,000 will be required for
pensions dnring tbe ooming year, and it may
well be doubted whether the maximum annual
demand for that objeot has yet been reaohed,
Certainly tbia question woald alone justi
fy, in m^ judgment, tbe retention for tbe
present of tbe portion of internal revenue
wbioh is least objeotionable to tbe people.
Seoond—A total abolition of the excise taxes
would almost prove a serious If not an unsur
mountable objection to a thorough levision of
tbe tariff aud to. any considerable reduction ia
import duties.
UNJUST TARIFF.
Tbe present tariff system is in many re
speots unjust It makes unequal distributions
both of its burdens and its benefits. This fact
was practically recognized by a majority of
eaoh house of oongress in the passase of the
aot creating the tariff commission. The report
of that commission will be ptafcod before you
at the beginning of this senaioai and will, I
trust, afford you such information as to the
oondition and prospects of the various com
mercial, agricultural, mining, manufacturing
and other interests of ihe oountry,
and oontain suoh suggastipus for statu

NATIONAL BANES.
During tbe year there have been organized
171 national banks, and of these institutions
there are now in operation 2,209, a larger
uumbe? than ever befora The value of their
notes in active circulation on July 1, 1882,
was $323,656,458. I recommend to your at
teutiou the secretary's views in respect to the
likelihood of a serious contraction of this cir
culation, and to the modes by whioh that result
may be, in bis 1 adgment, averted.
SILVER.
In respect to the ooinago of silver dollars and
the retirement of silver certificates, I have
seen nothiug to alter but muoh to ooufirm the
sentiments to which I gave expression last
year. A comparison between the respective
amounts of silver dollars in circulation on
November, 1881, and on November, 1882,
shows a slight inorease of $1,500,000 but
during the interval there had been, in the
whole number coined,an increase of $20,000,
000. Of the $128,000,000 thus farmintodlit
tle more thau $35,000,000 are in circulation.
The mass 6f accumulated coin has grown so
great that tbe vault room at present available
for storage ia scarcely sufficient to contain it.
It is not apparent why it is desirable to con
tinue this coinage now so enormously in exoess
6i publio demand. As to the silver certificates,
in addition to the grounds whioh seemed last
year to justifv their retirement, may be men
tioned, the effeot of which is likely to ensue
from the supply of gold certificates, for whose
issuance congress reoently made provision,
and wbioh are now in active oiroulatiou.
and finally, as has been already
stated, $220,000,000. The income from this
service for the fiscal year which will end on
June 30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably
in excess of tbe sum last mentioned. If the tax
on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is
plain, therefore, that largo reduotious
from the customs revenue are en
tirely feasible, While recommending this
reduction, I am far from advising the
abandonment of the polioy of so discriminating
In the adjustment of details as to afford aid
and protection to 'domestio labor. But the
present system should be so revised as to
equalize the public bprden among all classes
aud occupations, and bring it into closer har
mony witn the present needs of industry.
Without entering into minute details, which,
under present circumstances, is quite unnec
essary, I recommend an enlargement of the
free trade list so as to include within it the
numerous artioles whioh yield in considerable
revenue, a simplification of tbe oom
plex ana inconsistent sohedule of duties upon
oertain manufactures, particularly those on
ootton, iron and steel, and a substantial reduc
tion of the duties upon these artioles and upon
sugar, molasses, silk, wool and woolen goods.
If a general revision of the tariff shall bs
fonnd to be impracticable at this ssssion, I ex
press the hope tbat at least some of the more
oonspicuous inequalities of the present law
may be correoteu before your final adjourn
ment One of them is especially reforred to
by the secretary in view of the reoeut decision
of the supreme court, the neoessity of amend
ing the law by which the duties on standard of
color is adopted as the test of tbe saccharine
etron^tii of sugars is too obvious to require

THE ARM'S
ITS DEEDS AMD NEEDS.
From tbe report of the seoretary of war it
appears that tbe only outbreaks of Indiana
during the past year oocurred in Arizona and
tbe southwestern part of New Mexioo. They
were promptly quelled, and the quiet whioh
has prevailed in all other parts of the oountry
has permitted such an addition be made to the
military force in the region endangered by
Apaches that there is little reason to appre
bend trouble in tbe future. Those parts of
tbe secretary's report whioh relate to oar
sea ooast defenses and their armament
suggest grav#., reflections. Our existing
fortifications are notoriously inadequate to the
defense of the great harbors and oities for
whose protection they were built The ques
tion of providiag an armament suited to our
present necessities baa been a subjeot of con
sideration by a board whose report was trans
mitted to oongress at the last session. Pend
ing tbe consideration of that report the war
department has taken no steps for tbe manu
facture or conversion of any heavy caunon*
but tbe secretary expressed the hope that
means to begin that important work will soon
be provided. I invite tbe at
tention of congress to the propriety
of making more adequate provisions for arm
ing and equipping the militia than is afforded
by the aot of 1800, whioh is still upou tbe
statute books. The matter has already been
the subjeot of discussion in the senate, and a
bill which seeks to supply the deficiencies of
existing laws is now upon its oalendar. The
secretary of war calls attention to the fact of
an embarrassment growing out of the recent
aot of oongress making the
RETIREMENT OF OFFICERS
of the army compulsory at the age Of sixty
four, while tbe aot of 1878 is still in foroe,
'which limits to 400 the number of those who
oan bo retirod for disability or
upon tbeir own application. The
two aots when construed together seem to for
bid the relieving, even for absolute incapacity,
of offioerB who do not fall within the purview
of the letter of the statute, 6ave at such times
as there chance to be less than 400 names on
the retired list. There are now 420. It ia not
likely that oongress intended this result, and
con our with the seoretary that the law ought
be amended.
B1VERS AND HARBORS.
VIGOROUS COMMENT.
The grounds that induced me to withhold my
signature from the bill entitled "An aot making
appropriations for the construoiion, repair
and preservation of the oertain workB on
rivers and harbors," whicb became a law near
tho elose of your last session, prompt me to
express a hope that no similar measure will be
deemed necessary during the present session
of congress. Indeed, such a measure would
now be open to a serious objection in addition
to that whioh was lately urged upon your
attention. I am informed by the seoretary of
war that tbe greater portion of tbe sums appro
priated for tbe various items specified in that
aot remains .unexpended. Of the uew works
Whioh it authorized, expenses have been in
ourred upon two only, for which the total ap
propriation was $210,000. The present avail
able balauce is disolosed by the following
table:
Amount of appropriation by act of
Aug. 2, 1882 $18,738,875
Amount of appropriation by act of
June 19,
1882
Amount of appropriation for
10,000
payment
of J. B. Eads 304,000
Unexpended balance of former appro*
priation 4,738,263
Total S23.701.138
Less amount drawn from treasury be
tween July 1, 1882, and Nov. 30,
1882 6,008,194
Total... $17,734^)44
It is apparent by this exhibit that so far as
conoerns most of the itemB to which the aot
of August 2, 1882, relates/ there can be uo
D6ed of further appropriations until after thd
close of the present session. It, however, any
action should be necessary in respect to partie
tilat objects,, it will be advisable to provide
for those objects by apbropfiate legislation. It
is possible, for example, that a delay until the
assembling of the next congress to make addi
tional provision for the Mississippi river im
provement might be attended with serious
oonsequenoes. If such should'appear to be
the oase, a just bill relating to that aubjeot
would command my approval. This leads me
to offer a suggestion, which I trust will com
mend itself to the* wisdom.of congress. 'Is it
not advisable that grants of considerable sums
of money for diverse and independent soharfleS
of ihtefnttl Improvement should bo made
the subjects of Separate and distinct legislative
enactments? It willjscittrtiely be gainsaid, even
by those who favor tho most liberal expendi
tures fof sueli purposes sis are sought to
be aooomplished by what 1B oofnsc'only. Oalled
tbe river and harbor bill, that the pracfir* 6'f
grouping in such a bill appropriations for a
great diversity of objects widely separated,
either in the nature or the locality with which
they are concerned, or in both, is one
much to be deprecated, unless its inevitable
tendency is to eeebre the suoaess of the bill as
a whole,though many of the itetfis if soparately
ponsidgfed could Fcircelv 'fail of rejection.
By tbe fed'option Uf tbe course I have recom

of the oourse I Hav6 redomtnended may per
haps be more effectually attained by
another which I respectfully submit
to congress as an alternative proposition.
It is provided by the constitutions of fourteen
of our States that the exeoutive may disap

proved shall be law, and tbe part disapproved

The StateB wherein some such provision as
the foregoiug is a fundamental law are Ala

Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebras

to your careful consideration, the question
whether ou amendment of the federal constitu
tion, in this particular indicated, would not
afford the beet remedy for what is often a grave
embarrassment, both' to the members of con
gress and to tho executive, and is sometimes a
serious publio mischief.
THE IS'A'VY.
BETTER FACILITIES BEOOMEKDED.
The report of the secretary of the navy states
the movements of various squadrons during
the year, in, home and foreign waters, where
our officers and seamen, with such ships as we
possess, have oontinned to illus
trate tbe. high character and ex
cellent discipline of the naval organixation.
On the 21-st of December, 1881, information
was reoeived tbat the exploring steamer Jean
nette bad been crushed and abandoned in the
Arctic ocean. The officers and orew, after a
journey over the ice, embarked in three boats
for tho coast of Siberia. One of the parties,
under the command of Chiof Engineer George
W. Melville, reached the land, and falling in
with natives was saved. Auother under Lieut
Commander De Long landed in a barren re
gion near tho mouth of tho Lena river. After
six weeks had elapsed all but two
of the number had died from fatigue
and starvation. No tidings have been received
from tho party in the third boat lender the
of Lieut Chippy but a 4ong and
fruitless investigation 'leaves little doubt tha
all its members perished in the sea. As a
slight tribute to their heroism I give in this
communicatiou the names of tne gallant men
who sacrificed their lives ou the expedition:
Lieut Commander Geortre W. De Long Sur
geon J. M. Ambler J. J. Collins, Haus H. Eiick
son, Heiurioh Maacki, Geo. A. Brvde, Walter
Lee, Adolph Drassler,Carl A Gortz, Nels E. Sev
ersou, the cook Ah Sam, the Indian Alexy. Tbe
officers aud men in the missing
boat were: Lieutenant Charles W. Chipp,
commanding William Dunbar, Alfred Sweet
man, Walter Shortoil, Alberto. Kuehue, Edwin
Star, Henry Warren aud Peter E. Johnson.
Lieut Giles B. Harbor and Master William H.
Scheutzekisch are now bringing home tho re
mains of Lieut. De Long and his comrades.
In pursuanoe of the directions of congrcss, tbe
Bodgers, fitted out for tho relief of the Jean
notte, in accordance v/ith the aot of congress
of March 3, 1881, sailed from San Franoisoo
June 16 under command of Lieut Robert M.
Berry. On Nov. 30 she was accidentally de
stroyed by fire while in winter quarters in St
Lawrence bay, but the offioera and
orew succeeded in escaping to tbe
Bhore.
Lieut Berry and one of bis offioerB,
after making a search for tbe Jeaunettc^along
the ooast of Siberia, fell iu with Chief Engineer
Melville's party, and returned by way of
Europe. The other offioera and crew or tbe
liodgers were brought from St. Lawrenoe bay
by the whaling steamer North Star. Mr.
Charles F. Putnam, who had been plaoed in
charge of a depot of supplies at Cade Zdrdaee,
returning to his post from St Lawrence bay
across in a blinding snow storm, was carried
out to sea and lost, notwithstanding all efforts
to .rescue him. It appears by the secretary's
fbpdrt that
THE AVAILABLE NAVAL FOBC*
of the United States consists of thirty-seven
cruisers, fourteen single-turreted monitor,
built during tbe rebellion, a large number of
smoothbore guns and Parrot rifles and eighty
Seven rifled cannon. The cruising vessels
Bhould be gradually replaoed by iron or steel
ships, the monitors by modern armored ves
sels and tbe armament by high-power rifled
guna The reooustruotiou of our navy, which
was recommended in my last message, was
begun by oongress authorizing, in its reoent
aot, the oonstruotion of two large unarmored
steam vessels of the character recommended
by the late navy advisory board,
and subject to the final approval
of anew advisory board to be organized as
provided by that act. I call your atteutiou to
the recommendation of the secretary of tbe
boad that authority be given to coustruot two
more cruisers of smaller dimensions aud one
fleet dispatch vessel, and tbat appropriations
be for high-power rifled caonou. for torpedo
servioe and for other harbor defenses. Pend
ing consideration by congress of polioy here
after to be adopted in conducting the eight
large navy yards and their expensive estab
lishments, the secretary ad vooated a reduc
tion of the expenditures there
for to the lowest possible amounts,
for the purpose of affording the officers aud
seamen of the navy opportunities of exercise
and discipline in their profession under appro
priate control and directions. Tbe secretary
advises that the lighthouse servioe and ooast
survey be traust'erred, as now organized, from
the treasury to the navy department and he
also suggests for the reason which be assigns
that a similar transfer may wisely be made of
the cruisiug revenue vessels. The secretary
forcibly depicts the internal connection and
inter-dependence of the navy and the
COMMERCIAL MARINE,
and invites attention to the continued deoa
denceof the latter aud the corresponding
transfer of our growing oommerce to foreign
bottoms. This subject ia one of the utmost
importanoe to national welfare. Methods of
reviving American shipbuilding and of restor
ing tbe United States flag in the ocean-carrying
trade, should receive the immediate attention
of oongress. We have mechanical ski I and
abundant material for tho manufacture of
modern iron steamships in fair competition
with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage
ib building ships is tho greater oost of labor
aud sailing them, higher taxes and greater in
terest ou capital, while the ocean highways are
already monopolized by our formidable com
petitors. These obstacles should bo
some way ba overcome, and for our rapid
communication with foreigu lands wo should
not continue to depend wiioily on vessels built
in the yards of other countries and sailing
und tlagi«. V.'i'b no United State*
Btoanicrs oo tlm principal oceau lines, or tor
any foreign port*, our facilities for extending
our commerce are greatly restricted, while the
nations which build tho ships and carry mails
aud passengers obtniu thereby conspicuous ad
vantages oi' increasing their trade.
THE POSTOFFICES.
CHEAT EE POSTAGE.
The report of the postmaster general gives
evidence of the satisfactory conditio^ of tbat
department, add contains many valuable data
and aocompanying suggestions whioh cannot
fail to be of interest The information which it
jtffords that the receipts for the fiscal year ex
deeded th'e expenditures must be very gratify
ing to congress and to the people of the coun
try. Aa matters whioh may fairly claim par
ticular attention, I refer to his observations in
reference to the advisability of changing the
present basis for fixing salaries and allowauoea,
of extending tbe money order system, aud of
enlarging the functions of postal establish
ments so as to have under its control tho tele
graph system of the oOuutry, though
,"ra
this last and most important reoommendation
I must withhold my concurrence.
At the last session of oongress several bills
were introduced into the house of representa
tives for the reduction of letter postage to tbe
rate of 2 cents por half ounce. I have given
much study and reflection to this, subjeot and
am thoroughly persuaded that such a reduc
tion would bo* for the best interests of the pub
lic: It has been tbe policy of the government
from tbe foundation to defray, as far as pos
sible, tbe expenses of carrying tbe mails by a
direct tax' in th'e fof of postage. It has never
been claimed, however, that this service ought
to be productive of a siet revenua
As has been stated already, the r66ort of the
postmaster general
showB
that there is now a
very considerable surplus in his department,
and that henceforth the receipts are likely to
inoreaBe
in a much greater ratio than the nec
essary
expenditures. Unless some change is
made in the existing laws, the profits of the
postal service will, in a very few years, swoll
tbe revenues of the government inauy millions
of dollars. The time seems auspicious, there
fore, for some reductions in tbe rates
of postage. In what shall the
teduotion consist? A review of the legisla
tion wbioh has been had upop this subjeot
during tbd last thirty years discloses that do
meetio letters constitute the ouly class of mail
matter which has never been favored by a sub
stantial reductiou of rates. 1 am convinced
that
the burden of maintaining the service falls
most unequally upon that class and that more
than any other it is entitled to present relief.
That such relief may be extended without det
riment to other publio interests will be dis
covered upon reviewing the
RESULTS OF FOBMEB SEDUCTIONS.
Immediately prior to tho aot of
t$43/ the postage upon a letter composed
of a fiiugfe sheet was as follows:
If conveyed thirty miles or less 0 oents, be
tween thirty and eighty miles 10 cents, be
tween eighty and 150 miles oents, be
tween 150 and 400 miles 13^ eents, over
400 miles 25 cents. By the act of 1845 the
postage upon a single letter conveyed auy dis
tance under 300 miles was fixed at 5 cents,
snd for any greater distanoe at 10 pouts.
By the act of 1851 it was provided that a
single letter, if prepaid, should be carried any
distanoe not exceeding 300 miles for 3 oents,
and any greater distanoe for 6 cents. It wili
be noticed that both of these reductions were
of a radical character, aud relatively quite as
important as that Co# proposed. In oaoh case
there ensued a temporary loss of revenue by
a sudden and large influx of business which
substantially paid that lose iu three years,
tfalees the experience of past legislation in this
oountry dttd elsewhere goes for naught, it may
be safely predicted tbat a stimulus of
50 per cent reduction in the tax for carriage
wolnd at once inorease the number of letters
consigned to the mails. Tho advantages of
secrecy would lead to a very general substitu
tion of sealed packets for postal cards and
open circulars, and in divers other ways the
volume of first-clase matter would bo enor
thously augmented. Buch increase amounted
in England, in the first year after tha adoption
of penny postage, to more than 125 ner cent
As a result of a caroful estimate, the details of
which cannot here be set out, 1 have become
convinced that tbe deficiency for the first year
after the proposed reduction would not exceed
7 per oent of the expenditures, or $3,000,
000, while the deficiency after the reduction
of 1845 was more than 14 per cent, and
after that of 1851 wae 27 per oent Anr ther
interesting comparison is afforded by statistics
furnished me by tho postolfioe department
The aot of 1845 was passed iu the face of the
faot that there existed a deficiency of more
than $30,000. That of 1851 was encouraged
by the slight surplus of $132,000. The
excess of revenue in the next fiscal
year is likely to be $3,500,000.
If oongress should approve these suggestions
it may be deemed desirable to supply to some
extent the deficiency whioh must for a time re
sult by Increasing the ohargo-for carrying mer
chancuse, whicb is now ouly lG.jjents per
pound. But without suoh an inorease I am
confident tbe reoeipts under the diminished
rates would equal the expenditures after a
lapse of three or four years.
DEPABTM KST OP JUSTICE
KRLABOKD JUBIBPBUDBXOB WANTS©.
The report of the department of justioe
brings anew to your uotioe the neoessity of en
larging the present system of federal juris
prudence so as to effectually answer the re
quirements of the ever increasing litigation
hiob it is called upon to dsal with.
The attorney general renews the suggestions
of his predeoessor that in the Interest® of
justioe better provision than the existing laws
sheold be ia certain judicial die-
triots for fixing tho fees of witnesses and
jurors. In my message of Deoember last, I
referred to pending criminal proceedings
growing out of alleged frauds in what is known
as the star route service of the postoffice de
partment, and advised you that I had enjoined
upon the attorney general and associate coun
sel, to whom the interests of tho government
were entrusted, the duty of prosecuting,
with the utmost vigor of law,
all persons who might be found
chargeable with those offenses. A trial of one
of these cases has sinoe occurred. It occu
pied for many weeks the attention of the su
preme court of this district and was conducted
with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a
disagreement of the jury, but tbe oause has
again been placed upon the oalendar and will
shortly be retried. If any guilty man shall
finally escape punishment for these offenses
it will not bs for lack of diligent and nrgent
work of the prosecution. I trust that some
agreement will be reacbed wbioh will speedily
aid oongress, with the concurrence of the ex
eoutive, to afford the commercial oommtlnity
the benefit of a.national bankrupt law.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The report of the seoretary of the interior,
with its accompanying doouments, presents a
full statement of the varied operations of that
department In respeot to Indian affairs* noth
ing has occurred whioh has ohanged or seri
ously modified the views to wbioh I devoted
much space in a former communication to con
gress. I renew the recommendations therein
contained as to extending to the Indians the
provisions of law allotting laud in severalty to
snob as deserve it, and making ample provi
sion for tbe education of Indian youth. Such
provision, the seoretary maintains, will
prove unavailing unless it is broad
enough to include all those who are able and
willing to make use of it and should not solely
relate to intellectual training but also to
instruoiion in such manual labor and simple
industrial arts as can be made praotioally
available.
RAILBOAD OSANTS
Among other important, subjects which are
included io the secretary's report and which
wdl doubtless furnish occasion fof congres
sional action may be mentioned* the neglect
of railroad companies to which large grants of
land were made by the acts of 1802 and 18G4
to take title thereto and their consequent
inequitable exemption from looal taxation.
No survey of our material condition can fail to
suggest inquiries as to tbe moral and intel
lectual progress of the people. The census
return discloses an alarming state of illiterucv
in certain portions of tho oouutry where the
provision for sohools is grossly inadequate.
It is a momentous question for the decision of
congress whether immediate substantial aid
should bo extended by tha general government
for supplementing the efforts of private beuefi
cenoe and State and Territorial legislation in
behalf of education.
RAILROAD DISCRIMINATION.
The regulation of internal commeroo has
already been the subjeot of your deliberations.
One of the incidents of. the extension
of the railway system of the country has been
the adoption of such measures by the corpo
rations which own or oontroi the roads as have
tended to impair the advantages of healthful
competition and make hurtfui discriminations
in the adjustment of freightage. These in
equalities have been correoted in several of the.
States by appropriate legislation, the effect of
wmcu is necessarily restricted to tne limits of
their own territory. So far as BUCII mischiefs
affect commerce between tho States or between
any of the States and a ioreign country they
are subjects of rational oonoern, and congress,
can afford relief.
POLTOAMT.
The results which havo thus far attended the
enforcement of recent statutes for the sup
pression of polygamy in tbe Territories are re
ported by the secretary of the interior. It is
not probable that any additional legislation in
this regard will be deemed desirable until the
effect of tbe existing laws shall be more closely
observed and studied. I oongratulatejyou that
the commissioners under whose supervision
those laws have been put in operation are en
couraged to believe that tho evil at whioh they
are aimed may be suppressed without resort
to such radical measures as in some Quarters
nave Deen tnougut luaispensaoie ror sucoess.
The close relation of the general government
to tho Territories preparing to be great States
inay*well engage your attention. It is there
that Indian disturbances mainly ocour and
that polygamy has found room for its growth.
I cannot douot that a careful survey of Terri
torial legislation would be of tho highest
utility. Life and property wouid become mere
secure, the liability of outbreaks between In
dians and whites would be lessened, tbe
publio domain would be more se
curely guarded and bettor progress be
made" in the instruction of the young.
Alaska is still without any form of oivil gov
ernment If means were provided for the edu
cation of ito people and for the protection of
their lives aud property, the immense re
sources of tbe region would invite permanent
settlement and open up a new field for in
dustry and enterprise.
AGRICULTURE.
WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the commissioner of agricul
ture presents an aooouut of the labors of that
department during tbe past year, and includes
information of muoh interest to the general
public. The condition of forests iu the oountry
and the wasteful manner iu whioh their destruc
tion is taking plaoe gives cause for sorious ap
prehension. Their aotion in protecting tbe
earth's surface, in modifying tbe extremes
of climate, and in regulating aud sustaining the
flow of springs and streams is now
well understood, and their importanoe in rela
tion to the growth aud prosperity of the coun
try oannot b8 safely disregarded. They are
fast disappearing before the. destruction of
fires and the legitimate requirements of our
increasing population, and their total extino
tiop cannot be long delayed unless better
methodB than now prevail shall be adopted for
their protection and cultivation. The atten
tion of congress is invited to tbe necessity of
aaditioaal legislation to secure the preserva
tion of the valuable forests still remaining on tbe
publio domain, expeoially the extensive West
ern States and Territories, where the necessity
for tbeir preservation is greater than in less
mountainous regions, and whero tho prevailing
dryness of the olimate renders their restoration,
if they are once
destroyed,
well nigh impossible.
THE CIV1I, SERVICE.
"WHAT SHOULD BE DONE.
A communication which I mado to congress
,.i it® first session, iu December last, coutaius
a somawhat full statement or' my n.
relation to the princinica an I ruita wni'-l:
ought to govern appoiniuients lo public vv
ice. Boferring to tbe various plans whioh
heretofore had beon subjeoted to dis
cussion in the national legisla
tures—plans whicb, in tho main, are
modeled upon the system which obtaius in
Great Britain, but which lacked certain of the
prominout features whereby that system is
distinguishod—I felt bouud VJ intimate my
doubts whether any of them would af
ford adequate remedy for the evils whicb
they aimed to eradicate I declared, neverthe
less, that if these proposed measures should
prove acceptable to oongress they would re
ceive the support of tho exeoulive. Sinco the
suggestions wose submitted for your considera
tion there bas been no legislation upon
the subject to whicb thsy relate, but
there has, meantime, beeu an increase
in tbe publio talk on that subject,
and the people of the country, apparently
without distinction of party, hiqre in various
ways aud upon frequent occasi jps given ex
pression to their earnest wish for prompt and
definite action. Iu my judgment,^such action
should no longer be postponed, might add
that my own sense of its proastpg importance
has been quickeped by observaii® in a prac
tical pba-je of tho piatier to wft«*i attention
has boen more thau ouoe called b/jny prede
cessor. The civil list now comprises about
100,000 pwrsons, far the larger paw of whom
must, under tho
term3
of the coi^titution,
bo pcleetod by tbe president either
directly or through hia own appointees.
In the early years of the administratiousof tho
government,"tlie personal direciiou ot' appoint
ments in tbe civil servioe may not have^been
sn irksome task for tho executive but |0«
that tbe burden has increased fully a huudyoa
fold, it has became greater than he ought to
bear, and it necessarily diverts his time and
attention from the proper discbargo of other
duties no less delicate and responsible, flud
which, in the very nature of tbiugs, cannot be
delegated to other hands. Iu the judgment uf
not a few who have given study and reflection
to this matter, tho nation has out
grown the provisions wbioh the constitution
established ter filling tho minor offices in the
public service. But whatever may be thought
of the wisdom or expediency of changing the
fundamental law iu this regard, it is oertain
that much relief may be afforded not only to
the preeidkut and to the heads of the depart
ments, but to senators and representatives in
congress, by discreet legislation. They would
be protected ih a great naeaisure by the bill
now pending before the senate or by any other
which should embody its important features
from the
PRESSURE OT PERSONAL IMPORTUNITY
and from the labor of examining conflicting
claims and pretension of candidates. 1 trust
that before the dlose of tbe present* session
some deoisive aotion may be taken for the cor
rection of evils which inhere in the present
metheds of appointment and I assure you of
my hearty oo-operation in any measures which
are likely to oonduoe to that end. As to the
most appropriate term and tenor Of tho official
life of tho subordinate employes of the govern
ment, it seems to be geuerally agreed that
whatever tbeir extent or character the one
should be definite snd the other stable and that
neither ahould be regulated by zeal
ia Ik* sarvies of party or fldslity
to the fortunes of an individual.
It matters little to tbs people at large what
Competent person is at the head of this depart
ment, or that bureau, if they feel assured tbat
the removal of one and the accession of an
other will not involve the retirement of honest
and faithful subordinatee whose duties are
purely administrative,'and have no legitimate
connection with the triumph of any political
principles or the success of any political parly
or faction. It is to this latter class of officers
tbat the senate bill to wbioh wo' have already
referred exclusively applies, while ueitlie? that
bill nor any other prominent scheme for im
proving the oivil service concerns the
higher grade of officials who are
appointed by tbe president, and confirmed by
the senate. I feel bound to correct a prevalent
misapprehension as to the frequency with
whiob tbe present executive has displaced the
incumbent of an. office and appointed another
in his stead. It has.been repeatedly alleged
that he has, in this particular, signally de
parted from the course which has been pur
sued under reoent administrations of the gov
ernment Tbe facts are as follows: The
Whole number of executive appointments dur
ing the fotir years immediately preceding Mr.
Garfield's accession io the presidency was

involved the removal of previous incumbents.

THE PRESIDENCY.
NECESSITY OT LEGISLATION.
Among tbe questions wbioh have been tb€
topics of recent debate in the halls of oongress,
none are of greater gravity than those relating
to the ascertainment of the vote for presidential
electors, and the intendment of the constitu
tion in its provisions for devolving executive
functions upon the Vice president when the
president suffers from inability to discharge
the powers and duties of hia office. I trust that
no embarrassment may result from a failure
to determine these questions before another
national election.
BKOR ATION.
GRATIFYING PROSPERITY.
The closing year has been replete with bless
isga, for which we owe to the Giver of all gooJ
our reverent acknowledgment. For the unin
terrupted harmony of our foreign relations,
for the decay of Beciional animosities, for the
exuberance of our harvests, and the
triumpha of our mining and manufacturing
industries, for tbe prevalenco of health
and the conservation of the publio credit,
for the growth of the oountry in all the ele

countless other blessings wo should rejoice
and be glad. I trust that under tbe inspira
tion of this great prosperity our counsels may
be harmonious, and the dictates of prudence,
patriotism, justice wind economy may lead to
tbe adoption of measures in which congress
and the executive may heartily unite.

An Actress Shot by Mistake.
At the Coliseum Theatre, Cincinnati, ou
Thursday afternoon, Frank Fra\n«' and
company were playing Si Slocum. play
had proceeded to rlie end of the fourth act.
Frayne personated Si Slocuru and Miss Annie
Van Brfiren took the role of Ruth Sloenm,
Si Slocum's wife. Just at this point the
villian required Si Blocum to shoot an apple
off his* wife's head and remarked, "It must
be with the backward shot." The arrange
ments were made, the rifle cracked and
Eeth Slocum fell to the floor without utter
ing a sound. Frayne turned almost with
thfi flash of his gun and rushed toward the
prostrate girl and swooning fell by her side
witjh an arm across her bot y. The curtain
dropped and the audience, who saw no blood,
heard do cry, and therefore imagined it was
a new turn in the play, were not aware
of the situation. In fifteen minutes
the girl was dead. On the girl's head
was a bat on which the apples was placed.
The bottom of the apple was four inches
above her head. Frayne says it was an en
tirely safe shot for any ordinary good rifle
man. He says the accident could not have
been possible under any other circumstances
titan the giving away of the catch spring at
the breech. He does not explain how it
happened that he failed to discover this
weakening before appearing with it on the
stage. Frayne was immediately ar
rested. At the polioe station
when he was locked up tbe question was
put by the officers: "What charge shall we
put against him?". He spoke up: "Oh, put
it as bad as you please make it the worst
you can." There is an universal disposition
to condemn the practice of dangerous shoot
ing of this style the stage. People say
that though the marksman may be depend
ed upon for accuracy, which many quos
tion, this case shows the gun may not al
ways be reliable.

In relation to
POLITICAL ASSESSMENTS.
In July last 1 authorized a publio announce
ment that employes of the government
should regard themselves as at liberty to
exercise theif pleasure in making or re
fusing to make poli£i£$l contributions and tbat
tbeir aotion in that regard would, iu uo manner
effect thei rofficial staius. In ihifl announce
ment I acted upon the view
whioh I
had altvays
maintained and still maintain, that a publio
oflioer should be absolutely as free as
any other
citizen to give or withhold a contribution for
the aid of the politics of his choice. It has,
however, been urged, and doubtkeC not with
out foun dation, that by: 1a solicitation of su
periors such eontii' iions have at times
been obtained from .ns whose only motive
for giving has be»n fear of what might befall
them if they refused It goes without saying
that suoh contributions are not voluntary.
In
my judgment tbeir collection must be prohib
ited by law. A bill which wiil effectually
BUS)] ross them will receive my cordial ap
proval.
DISTRICT Oi1 COLUMBIA.
DEPRIVATION OF SUFFRAGE.
I hope that however numerous aud tirgent
may be the demands upon your attention, the
interests of this Distriot will not be forgotten.
The denial to its residents of the great right
of suffrage in all its relation to national, State
and municipal action imposes on con
gress the duty of affording the beet
administration Which its wisdom can devise.
The report of the Distriot commissioners indi
cates certain measures whcfBe adoption would
S9ern to be verv desirable. I instance in pai
tieular those which relate to arrears of taxes,
to steam railroads and to assessments of real
property.

Tbe Founder of Faribault, Minn.
Alexander Faribault, who died last week,
succeeding at an eariy age to the large and
lucrative trade of his father, one of the ol3
school of French gentlemen whose advent
urous spirit carried tbe commerce of
France to the remotest confines of tbe
Northwestern wilderness, and connected by
marriage with the Wapakuta band of Dako
tas, whose hun .ing lodges were located up
on the site of the present city of Fari
bault, he established a trading pest at
tbat point and built a commodious resi
dence before the tide of immigration had
begun to flow. Thus favorably situated
for selecting the most beantiful sites of
the many beautifili ones in tbe vicinity
he became and was, trhen the town pro
prietor's Jaid out the town, the owner of not
onlv the site fleeted, but of many of the
the" finest farms in its immediate vicinity:
and, in 1857, when lhe growtH of the city
eommenced, was by t&t the wealthiest
man in it, and so continued .for some
years. But it was the old gtory Which has
been exemplifie in tbe lives of so many
of the lamilies of mixed blood jwho laid
the foundations of our now pro§per«ps
ccmimonwesHh—the talents which fltteC?
for success in the rnde commerce of the
frontier proved inadequate to compete with
the energy and thrift of the adventurous
Yankee, "who was now pushing into the
coiriiry. His property gradually

years of his lite, in? dependant upon
the charity of hi-- oid friends among the

Death of the Archbishop of Canter
bury.
Dr. Tait, who has been archbishop of."
Canterbury since 1878, died Sunday morn
ing in London.
The archbishop passed away quietly,
and apparently without sufferings in the
presence of his three daughters, Davidson,
his son-in-law, Canon Knollys, and Dr.
Carpenter. Saturday he remained in a
semi-unconscious state, occasionally asking
for water. About 11 at night he spoke his
last words, ''It is coming! it is coming!"
He was then seized with a sharp spasm, and
his voice was not heard again, although it
is believed he was partly conscious to the
end. At 7 in the morning he showed
signs of dissolution. It is understood*the
dean of Westminister, on behalf ofthequeen,
has offered burial of the archbishop in West
minister abbey. The decision rests with the
daughter of the deceased Muffled peals
were rung in the adjacent town ot Croydon,
and the archbishop death was touchingly
referred to at morning service. Jennine's
London cable says the bishop of Winchester
will, in all likelihood.beoonie the primate.
Dr. Edward H. Brown,[who is nearly seventy
two, was always a close friend of Mr. Glad
stone. He is a liberal in politics and per
sonally very popular. Should he be elevated
to the throne of Augustine, Bishop Mac
Kamess. of Oxford, will be transferred to the
See of Winchester, and Archdeacon Palmer,
a yery accomplished classical scholar, will
succeed him as bishop ot Oxford.
A King's Remarkable Confcssioi*
The King of Corea has made an ex
traordinary confession of sin. It is
doubted if the ruler of any nation ever
made one more extraordinary. "I have
been for seventeen years at the head ol
the nation," he
Bays,
'"although I was
wanting in ability. Mv administration
has been a failure, and abuses have arisen
in the government through my fault. I
repent, butit is too late. !Sincc, I occupied
the throne I have made many improve
ments in roads and other things, and
both rich and poor have had to suffer
under the burden. This is my sin. I
have offer, altered the (.urrency and
sacrificed the interests of the people.
This is my sin. I have acted against re
ligious doctrines. I havo-waited the re
venue. This is my sin. Bribery has
been carried on publicly. The com
plaints ofthe victimized have not reacbed
-my ear. This is niv* .sin. The taxes
have been embezzled and tbe business
of the people ruined. This is my sin.
I am ashamed to come before the peo

repent niv former misdoings.
