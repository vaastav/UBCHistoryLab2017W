The Charlotte -Democrat:

CHARLOTTE, N. C.

The President's Message.
The heavy projectile fired by the
democracy of the country on the fourth
day of laat November appears to have hit
somewhere in the vicinity of the Execu
tive Mansion at Washington, The shock
was evidently felt by His Excellency, the
President, and the sensations aie graphi
cally given by that official in his message
to the 51st Congress, at the opening of
that bodys second session . last Monday.
There are two remarkable things, notice
able in'thc document which wo print in
tbis issue of The Democrat, as will be
observed by the readers pf it. First, the
attempt to show by inference what the
Republican party has done tor tbe coun
try. Second, the failure to substantiate
tbe attempt. Mr. Harrison must , bo ac
corded the credit, however, of getting up
a cunningly devised partisan document,
notwithstanding the: injection in the
message of language to the contrary. His
adherence to the doctrine of Protection
shows a dog like tenacity in holding on
to tbe bono of contention. The general
character of the paper is not above the
average messages of his predecessors,
though the widest scope possible has
been given since the adjournment of
Congress to rise above party, and assume
in the high position he holds, an attitude
in the interest of the whole people.
Some portions of the message reads more
like an edict than an appeal, to the
legislative branch of tbe government for
the enactment of laws, which in the
opinion of the President are found neces
sary. . Moro in the order of directing
than soliciting, he points out the necessi
ties for the salvation of tho party to
which he owes his elevation. That por
tion of tbe document, which is most
interesting to tho people of tbis section
is, that which refers to " free and honest
elections."' Seemingly bis Excellency
becomes facetious, but for a fact he is
very serious. As we read we find he
says, " it is gratifying' to. know that gen
erally there is a growing and non partisan
demand for better election laws." Being
interpreted meanB, the bayonet, the hasti
ly deputized United States official and the
party hirelings to carry by force, the
elections in tho interest of the party
which has proven recreant to every trust
reposed in it. It is the "force bill" to
which be refers aud not content with the
dastardly features of it, as it stood before
tho adjournment of Congress, he would
havo it supplemented with methods
which would stifle the will of tbe people
of the South, and perchance make them
offer up their lives on the altar of right,
in their endeavor to down tbe attempts
to overthrow our State governments, and
tbe safeguards thrown around them, by
the Constitution of the United States.
Subsequent events show that the recom
mendations of the President meet with
the hearty approval of his party's leaders
and wo may look for wild legislation
before the adjournment of the sitting
Congress. Let us abide our time in
patience. The day is not far distant
when all these wrongs may be righted,
and peace and good will mark the history
of our country for many years to come.
The message is the notice of the insolven
cy and tbe dissolution of the Republican
party, with Mr. Blaine, as assignee. The
assets, consisting largely of Protection,
Pension frauds, Reciprocity treaties, a
charter for an International bank, and a
plan for governmental supervision of
telegraphy will bo offered at low figures
to any one contemplating going into the
" Protective policy and High Pricod goods
business."
Porter's Census.
It ia time for Charlotte to arise and throw off
the galling yoke of Census Superintendent Robt.
P. Porter and scream, ia loud scream, for liber
ty. What has Porter done? He has returned
the mortuary blanks to the enumerators of that
city for revision, saying that the stathtics as re
turned by the enumerators do not show enough
dead people In proportion to the population. The
idea 1 This confirms the suspicion that Porter's
notion of a census is one that counts the dead
and leaves the living to count themselves Athe
tUU Citizen.
Superintendent Porter has denied to the
people of NewXork, Texas, and other de
mocratic States- the right of equal repre
sentation in Congress and the electoral col
lege. There is a pronounced feeling among
the people .all over the country that the
Federal census has been erroneously taken
and purposely erroneous for political rea
sons. Porter's earnest solicitudo to have
a correct census of the dead is, they will
not figure out a gain in the electoral col
lego in the apportionment bill, which the
Republicans will pa98 lhi9 winter

i PRESIDENTS . MESSAGE.
J Washington, JDec. 1, 1890;
To the Senate and Souse of Representatives:
The report of the several executive de
partments which will be lata Delore uon
trress in tbe usual course will exhiDit in
detail the operations of tbe Government
for the last fiscal year. Only the more
important incidents and results and chief
ly such as may bo the foundation of tbe
recommendations I shall submit will be
referred to in this annual message. The
vast and increasing business of tbe Govern
ment has been transacted by tbe several
departments during the year with faith
fulness, energy, and success. The
revenues, amounting to above $450,000,
000, have been collected and disbursed
without revealing, so far as I can ascer
tain, a single case of defalcation or em
bezzlement. An earnest effort has been
made to stimulate a sense of responsibility
and public duty in all officers and em
ployee's of every grade, and tbe work
done by them has almost wholly escaped
unfavorable criticism. I speak of these
matters with freedom because the credit
of this good work is not mine, but is
shared by tbe beads oi the several de
partments with tho great body of faithful
officers and employees who serve under
them. The closest scrutiny of Congress
is invited to all the methods of adminis
tration and to every item of expenditure.
The friendly relations of our country
with the nations of Europe, and of the
East have been undisturbed, 'while the
ties of good will and common interest
that bind us to the Statos oi the western
hemisphere havo been notably strength
ened by tbe conference held in this capital
to consider measures for the general
welfare.
The revenues of the Government from
all sources for the .fiscal year ending June
30, 1890, were $463,963,080.55 and the
total expenditures for the same period
were $358,618,584.52. The . postal re
ceipts have not been included in the state
ment of these aggregates, and for the
purpose of comparison tbe sum of $60,
882,097.72 should be deudcted from both
sides of tbe account. Tbe surplus for the
year, including the amount applied to
the sinking fund, was $105,344,496.03.
The receipts for 1890 were $16,030,923.79,
and the expenditures $15,739,871 in ex
cess of those of 1889. The customs
receipts increased $5,835,842.83, and the
receipts from internal revenue $11,725,
191.89, while on the side of expenditures
that for pensions ; was $19,312,075.96 in
excess of the preceding year.
The Treasury statement for the current
fiscal year, partly actual and partly esti
mated, is as follows : Receipts from all
sources, $406,000,000; total expenditures,
$354,000,000, leaving a surplus of $52,
000,000,not taking the postal receipts into
the account on either side.
The loss of revenue from custom for
the last quarter is estimated at $25,000,
000, but from this is deducted a gain of
about $16,000,000 realized during the first
four months of the year.
1 For the year 1892 the total estimated
receipts are $373,000,000 and the esti
mated expenditures $357,852,209.42, leav
ing an estimated surplus of $15,147,790 58
which, with a cash balance of $52,000,000
at the beginning of the year, will give
$67,147,790.58 as the sum available for
tbe redemption of outstanding bonds or
other uses. The estimates of receipts and
expenditures for the Post Office Depart
ment being equal are not included in tbis
statement on either side.
The act directing the purchase of silver
bullion and tbe issue of Treasury notes
thereupon, approved July 14, 1890, has
been administered by tbe Secretary of
the Treasury with an earnest purpose to
get into circulation at the earliest possi
ble dates the full monthly amounts of
Treasury notes contemplated by its pro
visions, and at the same time to give to
the market for silver bullion such support
as tbe law contemplates. ine recent
depreciation in the price of silver has
been observed with regret. The rapid
riso in price which anticipated and
followed the passage of the act was in
fluenced in some degreo by speculation,
and tbe recent reaction is in part the
result of the same cause and part of the
recent monetary disturbances. Some
months of further trial will be necessary
to determine tbe permanent effect of tbe
recent legislation upon silver values, but
it is gratifying to know that tbe increased
circulation secured by tbe act has exert
ed and will oontinue to exert a most
beneficial influence upon business and
upon general values. While it has not
been thought best to renew formally tbe
suggestion of an international conference
looking to an agreement touching tbe
full use of silver for eoinage at a uniform
ratio, care has been taken to observe
closely any change in the situation abroad
and no favorable opportunity will be lost
to promote a result which, it is con
fidently believed, would confer very
large benefits upon the commerce of the
world.
The recent monetary disturbance in
England are not unlikely to suggest a re
examination of opinions upon tbis sub
ject. Our very large supply of gold will,
if not lost by impulsive legislation in tbe
supposed interest of silver, give us a posi
tion of advantage in promoting a
permanent and safe international agree
ment for tbe tree use of silver as a coin
metal. ,
The efforts of the Secretary to increase
tbe volume of money in circulation by
keeping down the Treasury surplus to
the lowest practicable limit have been
unremitting and in a high degree sue
cessful. The tables presented by him
showing the increase of money in circu
lation during tho last two decades and
especially the table showing the increase
during tbe nineteen months he has -administered
the affairs of the department
are interesting and instructive. The in
crease of money in circulation during the
nineteen months has been in the aggre
gate $93,866,813, or about $1.50 per
capita, and of this increase only $7,100,
000 was due to the recent silver legiala
tion.. That this substantial and needed
aid given to commerce resulted in an
enormous reduction of the public debt
and of the annual interest charge is a
matter of increased satisfaction. , There
have been purchasod and redeemed since
March 4, 1839, 4 and 4 J per cent, bonds
to the amount of $211,832,450 at a cost of
$246,620,741, resulting in. a reduction
of the annual interest charge of $8,967,
609, and. a total saving of interest of
$51,576,706. ......
1 notice with great pleasure tbe state
ment of the Secretary that the- receipts
from internal 'revenue have increased
during the last fiscal year nearly $ 12,000, i
000, and that the cost 6f collecting this
larger revenue was less by $90,617 than
for the same purpose in the preceding
year. ' The percentage of cost of col
lecting the customs revenue was less for
the last fiscal year than ever before! "
The customs ad ministration board pro-f
vided for by tbe act of June 10, 1890, was
selected Withf great care, andf is cotapdsed
in part or men whose previous experience
in too administration ot tbe old customs
regulations bad made them familiar with
tho evils to be remedied. They are men
whose legal and judicial requirements
and experience seem to fit them for the
work of interpreting and applying the
new statute. The chief aim of tbe law is
to secure honest valuations oi all duitablo
merchandise and to make these valuations
uniform at all out ports of entry. It bad
been made manifest by a congressional
investigation that a system of undervalu
auoa cau peeq ioi.g in ,u wy wwy
classes of importers, resulting not' only in
a great loss of revenue, but in a- most, in
tolerable discrimination against honesty.
It is not seen how this . legislation when
it is understood can be regarded by the
Lcitizensof any country bavins: coromer
cial dealings with us as unfriendly, it
any duty is supposed to be excessive ' let
tbe complaint ., be lodged there. It will
surely not bo claimed by. any well-dis.
posed people that a remedy may be sought
and allowed in a system of quasi smug.
g,inS- 7; i 11 1 i J
Tbe report or tbe Secretary ot Agi-r
culture deserves especial attention, in
view of the fact that tbe year has been
marked . in a very unusual degree by
agitation and organization among the
farmers looking to an increase in . tbe
profits of their business. It will be found
that tbe efforts ot tbe department bave
been intelligently and zealously devoted
to the promotion of the interests in
trusted to its care. A very., substantial
improvement in theTmarket prices, of the
leading farm products during the year is
noticod. The 'price of wheat advanced
from 81 cents in October, 1889, to $1.00
in October, 1890 ; corn from 31 cents to
50 cents ;i oats from 19 cents to 43 cents,
and barley from 63 cent to 78 cents.
The meats showed a substantial but not
so large an increase. ' - ,
The export trade in live animals and
fowls shows a very large increase. , Tbe
total value of such exports for the year
ending July 30, 1890, was $33,000,000,
and the increase over the preceding year
was over $15,000,000.. .Nearly two hun
dred thousand 'more cattle and': over
forty five thousand more hogs were ex
ported than' in the preceding year. J&i&r
The export trado in beef and pork pro
ducts and dairy products was very largely
increased, the increase in the article of
butter alone being from 15,504,978 pounds
to 29,748,042 pounds,and the total increase
in the value of moat and dairy products
exported being 34,000,000. This trade,
so directly helpful to tbe farmer, it is
believed will be yet further and very
largely increased when the systom of
inspection and sanitary supervision now
provided by law is brought fully into
operation.
The information given by tbe secre
tary of the progress and prospects of tho
beet sugar industry is full of interest.
It has already passed the experimental
stage and is a commercial success. . Tbe
area over which the sugar beet can be
successfully cultivated is very large, and
another field crop of great value is offered
to the choice of the farmer.
The Secretary of the Treasury concurs
in the recommendation of the Secretary
of Agriculture that tho official super
vision provided by tbe tariff law for
sugar oi domestic production, snail be
transferred to the Department of Agri
culture. ..... .
I congratulate tbe Congress and the
country upon tbe passage at tbe first
session of the Fifty-first Congress 6fan
unusual number of laws of very high im
portance. That the results of this legis
lation will be the quickening and enlarge
ment of our manufacturing industries,
larger and better markets for our bread
stuffs and provisions both, at home and
abroad, more constant employment and
better wages for our working people, and
an increased supply of a safe currency
for tho transaction of business I do not
doubt. Some of the measures were en
acted at so late a period that tbe beneficial
effects upon commerce which were in the
contemplation of Congress have as yet
but partially manifested tbemseives.
Tbe general trade and industrial con
ditions throughout the country during
the year have shown a marked improve
ment. For many years . prior to 1888 the
merchandise balances of foreign trade
had been largely in our favor, but during
that year and the year following they
turned against us. It is very gratifying
to know that tho last fiscal year again
shows a balance in our favor of over
$68,000,000. The bank clearings, which
furnish a good test of the volume of busi
ness transacted, for the first ten months
of the year 1890 show, as compared with
the same months of 1889, an increase for
the whole country of about 8.4 percent.,
while the increase outside of the city of
New York was over 13 per cent. During
the month of October the clearings of the
whole country showed an increase pf 3.1
per cent, over October, 1889, while out
side of New York the inciease was Hi
per cent. Theso figures show that
tho increase in tbe volume of business
was very general throughout the country.
That this larger business was being
conducted upon a safe and profitable basis
is shown by tbe fact that there were 300
less failures reported in October, 1890,
than in tbe same months of the preceding
year, with liabilities diminished by about
$5,000,000. Tbe value of our . exports of
domestic merchandise during the last
year was over $115,000,000 greater than
the preceding year, and was only ox
ceeded once in our history. About $100,
000,000 of this excess was in agricultural
products. ., j i . f. . : : Ti
The general testimony is that labor is
everywhere fully employed, and the re
ports for tho last year show a smaller
number of employees affected by strikes
and lockouts than in any year since 1884.
The depression in the prices of agricul
tur&l products has been greatly relieved
and a buoyant and hopeful tone is be
ginning to be felt by all our people.
These promising influences have been
in some degree checked by the surpris
ing and very unfavorable monetary events
which have recently taken place' in Eng
land. ; It is gratifying to know that these
did not grow in any degree out of jthe
financial relations of lrondon "waa-ourJ
people or out of any discredit attached to
our securities held in that marke.i,The
returns of our bonds and stocks was
caused by a money, stringency luffing
land, not by any loss of value or credit in
the securities themselves. We could not,
however, wholly escape the Ill-effects of a
foreign monetary agitation' accompanied
by such extraordinary incidents as charac
terized this. (;
It is not believed, however, that theso
evil Incidents, which have for a time
unfavorably affected values in this' coun-
I try, can long wltkstahd the strong, ' safe

The apprehension that our tariff, may
again and at - onee be'' subjected tor im
portant genera! changes would undoubt
edly add a depressing influence of -the
most, serious character. .-The general tariff
act has only partially gono . into opera;
tion,! some of its' important0 pro visions
being limited to take effect at -datesyet
in tho future. Tbe general provisions of
tbe law have been in force less than sixty
day s Its , permanent effect upon trade
and prices still largely stands in . conjeo
tur$. It is curious to note that tbe ad
vance in the prices of articles wholly un
affected by the tariff act was by many
hastily ascribed to that act. Notice was
not taken of tbe fact that tbe general ten
dency of the markets was 'upward from
influences wholly" apart from the recent
tariff legislation. Tbe enlargement of
our currency by, the silver bill ,-undpubt
edly gave an. upward tendency; to trade
and' bad a marked effect on prices, but
this' natural and desired eflEoct ot the silver
legislation was by many erroneously
attributed to the tariff acy ; ;
There is neither wisdom norjd tice in the su
geation that the subject of urin revision shall be
again opened before tbis law has had a fair trial,
It fs quite true that every Urilf schedule is sub
ject la objections. No bill - was ever framed, I
suppose, mat in ail m ua intra ana ciassmomonB
had tbe fall approval ereu et party caucus.
Such legislation is always and necessarily toe
tbe product of compromise as tp details, and tbe
preseai taw is no excppiiuu. iui iu us general
scope and effect I think it willjustify the support
of tnosj who believe that American legislation
should conserve and defend American trade and
the wages of American worklngmea. Toe mis
information as to tbe terms of tbe act which has
been so widely diasemiaated at home . aod
abroad will be corrected by experience . and the
evil auguries as to its result confounded by tbe
market reports, the savings banks, international
trade balances, and tbe general .prosperity of out
people; Already we begin- to near irora abroad
and from our cuttom bouses that the prohibitory
effect upon importations imputed' to the act is
not iustified.
Tiie imDorts at the port of New York for Hi
first three wteKs or ixovemDer were nearly pet
cent, grtaler than that for the same period of
lBbd. and 29 per cent greater than in the tame
period of 1883. And, so far from beiag an act .to
limit exports.. I confidently believe that under it
we shall secure a larger add more profitable
participation in foreign trade than we have ever
enjoyed, and tnai we enaii recover a proportion
ate participation in the ocean-carrying trade of
tbe world- ,
The .criticisms of the bill that have come to us
from foreign sources may wen be rejected for

they should lead the outcry against the authors
of a policy so helpful to their countrymen rand
crown with tLeir favor those whu woutd snatch
from them a substantial " share i f a tradewttn"

ties. Tuere is no ditposiujo among any oi our
people to promote prohibitory orAretaliatory
legislation. Oar policies are adopted not to the
huit of others, but to secure for ourselves those
advantages that fairly, ftfow Out , of our favored;
position as a nation, j'Ou form of government

imperative that we shall save our working people
from the agitations .and distresses which
scant work and wages that have no margin for
comfort always beget, , hot after alMhie is done
it will be found that our markets are open to
friendly commercial exchanges of enormous
value to i he otber great Powers , - ' . .
From the lime of my induction into office the
duty of using every power and influence given
by law to tue Executive Department for the
development of larger markets for our products,
esDeciallv our farm products, has been kept con
stantly in mind, and no effort baa been or will be
spared to promote that end. ' We are under no
disadvantage in any foreign market except that
we pay our workmen ana workwomen oetter
waees than are paid eUe where better abstractly.
better relatively to the cost of the necessaries of
life. . . . i . ..
I do not dottbt that a very largely increased
foreign trade is accessible to us without bartering
for it either our borne market for such products
of the farm and shop as out. own. people can
supply, or the wages of our working-people in
mny of the products of wood and iron, and in
meats and breadstuff's we have advantages that
only need better facilities of luteicourse and
transportation to secure for them large foreign
markets. ' o . .
The reciprocity clause of the. tariff act wisely
and effectively opens tbe way to secure a ianre
reciprocal trade in exchange for thi free admis
sion to our ports of certain products. The right
of independent nations to make special reciproci
ty trade concessions is wen estannanea ana uoes
not impair either the comity due to other Powers
to what is known as the ' favored-nation clause "
so generally found in commercial . treaties.
What is given to one for an adequate agreed
consideration- cannot, be , claimed by-,; another

Tne state of the revenues wai fcuch that we
could dispense with any import rduties upon
coffee, tea, hides, and tbe lower grades of sugar
and molasses; that the large advantage resulting
to the countries producing acd exporting these
articles by placing them on tbe free list entitled
us to expect a fair return in tbe way of customs
concessions upon articles exported by us to
them was so obvious that -to' care gratuitously
abandoned this opportunity to enlarge our trade
would bave been an unpardonable error. ; A here
were bat two methods of 'maintaining control of
this question open to Congress to place all of
these articles upon tbe dutiable list, subject to
such treaty agreements as could be secured, or to
Dlace them all presently upon tbe free list, bat
subject to tbe reimposition cf specified duties if
tbe countries from which we received them
should refuse to give us suitable reciprocal
benefits. Tnis latter method; 1 think, possesses
great advantages. It expresses in advance the
consent of Congress to reciprocity arrangements
affecting these products which must otherwise
bave been delayed and nnascertainea until eacu
treaty was ratified by the Senate and the neces-
siry legislation enacted by Congress.
.Experience has shown that some treaties loos
ing to reciprocal trade have failed U secure a
two-thirds vote in the Senate for ratification, and
others haying passed that stage have , tor years
awaited the concurrence ot the uouae and Senate
in such modifications to our revenue laws as
were necessary to give effect to their provisions.
We now bave tbe concurrence of both douses
in advance in a distinct and definite offer of free
entry to our ports of specific, articles. Tbe Ex
ecutive is not required to deal in conjecture as to
what Congress will, accept . Indeed, this re
ciprocity provision ia more than an offer, Our
part of tbe bargain is complete, ueuvery nas
been made and when the countries from . which
we receive sugar, coffee, tea and hides, have
placed on their free lists such of our products as
shall be agreed upon as an equivalent for our
concession, a proclamation of that fact completes
the transaction and ia the meantime our -own
people bave free sugar, tea, coffee and hides. .
Tbe indications thus far given .are very hope
ful of early and favorable action by the countries
from which we receive our larze - imports of
coffee and sugar, and it is believed that if steam
communication witb tbese countries can roe
promptly improved and enlarged the next year

would begin with free,' bonest elections, and it is
gratifying to know that generally there is a
grewisg sod non-partuan .demand for better
election laws. Bat against this sign of hope and
progress must be set tbe depressing and undenia
ble fact' that election laws' aud methods are
sometimes cunningly contrived to . secure a
minority contro!, while 'violence completes ' the
shortcomings of fraud.
In my last annual message I suggested that
the development of the existing law providing a
X euerai supervision or congressional elections
offered an effective method of reforming these
abuses; Tbe need of such a law has manifested
itself is many parts of tbe country and its whole
some restraints sod penalties wttj be,usef ul in all.
i bb cuusiiiuiion&uiy. ui aacn legislation nas
been' affirmed by the Supreme Court . lt
probable effectiveness is evidenced by ' the
character of the opposition that is made to it. It
has been denounced as if IT were a "new exercise
of Federal power and an invasion of the right of
the States. - Nothing could be further from tbe'
truth: i Congress has already fixed the time for
the election of members of Congress; it has de
clared that votes for members of Congress must
be by written er printed ballot." It has provided
for thi appointment, by the circuit courts ia1
certain' cases and upon the petition of a certain
number of citizens, of election supervisors,- and
made it their duty to supervise the registration
of voters conducted by the State officers, to chal
leoge persons offering to register, to personally
inspect and scrutinize the registry-lists, and to
affix their names to-the list for .the purpose of
identification and the prevention of frauds, to
attend at elections and remain with the boxes
till the votes are all cast and counted, to attach
to the ! registry lists and election returns any
statement touching the accuracy and fairness of
tbe registry and election, and to take and trans
mit to the clerk of the Uouse:of Representatives
any evidence of frandulant practices which may
The same law provides for the appointment of
deputy United' States marshals to attend at the
polls, support the supervisors .in the discharge
of their duties and to arrest persons violating the
election laws. The provisions of mis familiar
title of the Revised Statutes have been ! put into
exercise by both the great political parties,' and
in tbe North as well as in the South by the filing

law. : ' d vl ;; "!!; ;
It is ; not. therefore, a question whether we
Shall bave a Federal, election law,' for we now
bave one, and bave bad for nearly twenty years.
but whether, we shall bave an effective law. The
prtsjnt law stops tust abort ot effectiveness, for
it surrenders to tbe local authorities all control
over tbe certification which establishes prima
facie right to a seat iu the House : of Representa
tives. This defect should be cured. Tbe equal
ity of representation and the parity of the elec
tors must bs maintained or every thing "that is
valuable in our system of government is lost.
The qualifications of an elector must be sought
in the law, not in the opinions, prejudices, or
(ears of any class, however powerful.. The path
of the elector to the ballot box must be free from
the ambush of fear and the entice men ts of fraud;
the count so true ana open that none shall gain
say it. ' Such a law should be absolutely , non
partisan and impartial. . U should give the ad
vantage to honesty and the control to the ma
jorities. Surely there is nothing sectional about
this creed, ana ii it shall happen (bat tbe
penalties of laws intended to enforce these
rights fall here and not there, it is not because
the law is sectional, but , because, happily,
crime is locat and not universal. Nor
should it bii forgotten that every law. whether
relating to elections or to any other subject,
whether enacted by the State' or by the nation,
has force behind it. Tbe courts, the marshal or
constable, the posse comitatus, the prison are all
and always behind tbe law. '" One cannot - be
justly Charged with.unfriendliness to any section
or class wno eeeKS'omy to restrain- violations
of law and of personal right. No community
will find lawlessness profitable. No community
can afford to nave it known that tbe officers who
are charged with the preservation of the public
peace and tbe restraint ot tbe criminal classes
are themselves tbe product of fraud or violence
The magistrate is then without respect and the
law without sanction. Tbe floods of lawlessness
cannot be leveed and mado-toiran in iontf chan
nel. The killing of a United States marshal
carrying a writ of arrest for an election offence
is fml of prompting and suggestion to men who
are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against
lire or property. '
But it is said tbat tbis legislation will revive race
animosities, and some have even suggested that
when tne peaceful methods of fraud are -made
impossible they may be supplanted by intimi
dation and violence. If the proposed law gives
to any qualified elector by a hair's weight more
than bis equal influence or detracts by so much
from any other qualified eleetor it is fatally im
peached, out it tue law is equal and tne
animosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact
that some electors have been accustomed to
exercise tbe franchise for others as well as for
themselves, then these animosities ought not to
be confessed without shame and cannot be given
any weight in the discussion without dishonor.
No choice is left to me to enforce with vigor all
laws injtended to secure to tbe citizen bis consti-

quacies of such laws be promptly remedied; i "i
If to promote with zeal and ready interest
every project for tbe development of its ma
terial interests, its rivers, harbors, mines, and
factories, and the -intelligence, peace, and
security, under the law of its communities and
its homes, is not accepted aa sufficient evidence

North Carolina History.
Tbe State Chronicle at Raleigh renews-
the appeal to the people of the State td
ia in socunnff the "Ubair of History "
at the State University at Chapel Hill.
We. wish to '.add in, this ; connection that
Dr. K. P. Battlo. j President of the Uni
versity, on his last visit here in behalf of
the endowment, made a jvery favorable
impression in regard to the end and aims
of that important Work! The Dfanrfitf A
word, is to organize the department of
History and State Literature into a
number of branch heads and subjects, and
seek to assign one or more special uttd to
each. For instance the w hole subject of
the M Regulators' War" would be put
into the hands of one or ' two ' SDecial
writers. So of the Mecklenburg Declara
tion. On the other hand, the broader
topics of the first immigration, the Indian
wars, and educational ; movements might
be divided, or referred to a committee of
several and by them sub-divided.
It would be seen at a glance that this
method would set to work the whole his
toric life and energies : of our .-people-alike
among students, writers, and the
" curious."
Special provision would also be made
for a " Library of History," a collection
oi art, and a museum of relics and An
tiquities. .
So impressed were our people here in
Charlotto with tbe great value and im
portance of tbis move tbat . they re
sponded quite liberally to Dr. Battle's
call for aid, and be got several hundred
dollars in subscriptions, mostly by
alumni of the. University, but one public
spirited gentleman who had never en
joyed the blessings of a liberal education,
gladly put down his $50. ,
It only remains for all who have the
name and fame ot our good old state
sincerely at heart to come at once to
the rescue and make the Chair of
History" a complete success.
vHere, too, we would again appeal to
Gov. Fowle to impress this matter, also,.
on
the coming Legislature and make
assurance
doubly sure. The time has
come . wben " leading men r. must realty
lead, j The people themselves are ready
if only public men could learn to throw
themselves forward' lit all great. advance
movements.
Thk State Board of Education, at. a
regular meeting in Raleigh, put Mrs.
Spencer's " First Steps in North Carolina
