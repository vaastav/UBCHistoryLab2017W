Tbe President's Message.
One might as well expect to gather grapes
Of thorns, or figs of thistles, as to look for
any broad and statesmanlike views in a
Message, or any other State paper, emanat
ing from the present incumbent of the White
Ucuse. The Message, in the language of
"the New York Sun, a Radical paper, ' is a
poverty-stricken document." Stung to des-.
peratioD by his recent humiliating defeat in
the Southern States, Grant sets out in his
Message with the following flagrant perver
sion of the truth : "It is to be regretted that
a free exercise of the elective franchise has,
by violence and intimidation, been denied to
citizons in exceptional cases in several of the
States lately in rebellion, and tbe verdict of
the people has thereby been reversed." Com
ing from the source it does, this broad and
sweeping declaration is decidedly cool. Who
was it that by "violence and intimidation"
interfered with the free exercise of the elecU
ire franchise at the late election in North
Carolina? It was this same U. S. Grant,
when he sent large bodies of U. S. troops
into that State to overawe and terrify the
people in the free exercise of their opinions.
Who committed the same outrage in tbe city
of New York at the November election ? It
was U. S. Grant. Who quartered troops at
the election polls in Florida, Alabama, and
other Southern States at the same election ?
It was U. S. Grant, who now seems so deep
ly concerned about the purity of tbe ballot.
Who only a few days ago ordered troops
into Georgia, to intimidate the voters cf that
State at the coming election and to sustain
his friend Bullock, who is the vilest fraud
that ever disgraced tbe Executive chair of
any State in the Union? Where is the evi
dence upon which Grant bases this charge
of "violence and intimidation," on the part
of the people of tbe South ? There is none,
nor can any be produced. So far as Ala
bama is concerned, there is a direct question
of veracity between Grant and Gen. Craw
ford, who commandod the troops in that
State at the late election, who knows the
truth whereof he affirms, and who has do
clarod that the election was fair and peacea
ble. And yet Grant charges an outraged
people with the very offence which he him
self has openly committed.
It was to be expected that after the Bignal
failure cf the San Domingo job last summer,
at tbe hands of a Republican Senate, that
corrupt scheme had been consigned to well
merited oblivion. But the prize is loo tempts
ing to be lightly abandoned, and Grant sur
passes all his former efforts, in his advocacy
of this venal project. He calls it "a great
prize' just as Seward, his illustrious pred
ecessor in the purchase of real estate, styled
the acquisition of barren, sterile and frozen
Alaska. To Grant's vision everything in
San Domingo, the land of caulattoes and
chronic revolutions, seems lovely and of
good report. Have the people asked him to
acquire it? lias it ever been made a test
question at any general election, as the an
nexation of Texas was in 1841? The treaty
between him and Baez having failed of a
ratification by the Senate, he is now in favor
of a j jint resolution of Congress to tflect the
same purpose. The Senate committee on
foreign affairs, a majority of whose members
are well known to be hostile to the scheme,
will effectually checkmate Grant in this
plundering job and give San Domingo, in
any shape it may assume, its everlasting
quietus.
These are the only two features of the
Message to which we have room this week
to refer.
Hon. Samuel Gbi7fitu, the newly elect
ed Democratic Congressman from the Mercer
district, is a native of Wales, having been
born in that country in 1816 and emigrated
to this country with his father and the other
members of the family in 1818. His father
was a miner and worked at that business for
a number of years in Mercer county. At
the age of 20 Mr. Griffith left his father's
residence fcr the purpose of acquiring an
education, and in 1842 graduated from Alle
gheny College, at Meadville, with high hon
ors. lie became principal of the High
School in Mercer, studied law and was ad
mitted to the Bar of that place in 1846. As
a lawyer, Mr. Griffiith occupies a front rank
in his profession. In 1849 he was married
to a sister ef Gen. Hem by D. Fostkb, of
Greensburg. Mr. Griffith's majority in the
district was 769. Two years ago it gave a
Radical majority of 1812. He revolution
ized his district even more thoroughly than
Mr. Speer did our own. In this portion of
Cambria county, where the natives of Wales
aod their immediate decendents form so
large a portion of our population, a Welsh
Democrat is regarded as a great political cu
riosity. A Welsh Democratic Congressman
is certainly a flat contradiction of Solomon's
declaration, that there is nothing new under
the son.
At the meeting of the Democratio State
Cential Comraittee recently held at Altoona,
Mr. Mntcbler, tbe Chairman, was instructed
to issue a call for tho next Democratic State
Convention to nominate candidates for Au
ditor General and Surveyor Genera!, at some
time between the 4th cf next March and the
first Tuesday in May, aa he may deem most
expedient. It was decided to hold the Con
vettirn at Earmbarg. The Representative
delegate froca this county is Mr. James
Jusg, of JohsrtowB.
HeW Mexico and Colorado.
According to good Republican authority.
there is now in Washington a delegation of
government officials from New Mexico.whose
business it is to procure the admission, dar
ing the present session of Congress, of that
Territorv as a State in the Union. An effort
will also be made for the admission of Colo
rado. During the administration of Presi
dent Johnson he very properly vetoed a bill
for the admission of the latter Territory, but
as Grant has shown himself to be merely a
willing instrument io the hands of Congress
to register its decrees, no danger of the exer
cise of the veto power is now apprehended.
It is a rare thing that the people of a Ter-
ritoiy desire to change their relations to the
general government and assume the duties
and responsibilities of a State organization.
The reason is obvious. While they are in a
territorial condition all the expenses of the
government are defrayed out of the National
Treasury, but the moment they are admitted
into the Union the taxes are enormously in
creased and bear heavily upon the scattered
and sparse population oi the new State.
Some of the men who are pressing these pro-
ects are ambitious of becoming Governors
of the proposed new States, others United
States Senators, while a majority of them
would be content to serve as Congressmen.
In 1869, at the election of a delegate to
Congress, New Mexico polled 14,407 votes,
only 1,481 more than double the vote polled
in Cambria county at the President election
in 1868, which was 6.493. In 1868 the
vote of Colorado was 8,107, only 1,674 more
votes than were cast in this county at the
same election. The combined vote of New
Mexico aod Colorado in 1868 and 1869 was
22.684, In 1868, at the Presidential elec
tion, Lancaster county polled 24,305 votes,
or 1.671 votes more than the vote of both
these territories put together. In 1869.
Montana polled 9,350 votes, or 1.1S0 more
than Colorado did in 1868. But no Radical
members of Congress would ever think of
voting for the admission of Montana, for the
simple reason that it would be a certain
Democratic State.
The Radical party Is rapidly losing the
power which it has eo long and so flagrantly
abused, and therefore as a matter of party
necessity, four more Radical U. S. Senators
must be obtained by tho creation of two
rotten-boron gh States out of the thinly pop
ulated rogions of New Mexico and Colorado.
Is it fair is it just is it honest that these
two Territories, when transformed into
States, with a population less than that of
Lancaster county, should wield the same
political influence in the Senate as New
York and Feuu6ylvaDia, with more than
tight millions of inhabitants ? And yet this
is just what the Radical majority propose to
do. ' The proposition is monstrous and ab
surd, and without the shadow of a reason or
an excuse. Graot has set his heart on a
re-election, and feels that ho cannot succeed
without some special political good fortune.
New Mexico and Colorado, with their six
electoral votes, might possibly, although we
do not think they would, save him from
being overwhelmed in the coming political
storm, and hence the determination of his
friends to put these two Infamous jobs thro'
Congress may be regarded as a foregone con
clusion. Wheu it is done, it will be a shame
less, unpr.rallekd outrage a low political
device to bolster up a tottering administra
tion and to thwart and nullify the influence
and will of the old and larger States in the
Senate.
Judos Goldtuwaitk was last week elect
ed United States Senator by the Legislature
of Alabama. He is a Democrat and a man
cf commanding ability, and was formerly one
of tbe Judges of the Supreme Court of the
State. He will take the place of Warner,
Radical. Warner is a carpet-bagger from
Ohio a State remarkably prolific of such
men and through the disreputable agencies.
so well known to that class of patriots, sud
denly luomsd up as a grave Audpotent Sena
tor. Alabama has vindicated her integrity
by repudiating this Ohio importation and
electing a gentleman who has resided in the
State for forty years, and who will faithfully
and intelligently represent the interests of
his constituents.
It will be the duty of the next Democrat
ic State Convention to nominate candidates
for Auditor General and Surveyor General
In connection with the first named office we
have seen suggested the name of John Hodo
sos, editor of tbe Jeffersonian, published al
West Chester. We have known Mr. Uodz
son for twenty years. He is a gentleman of
ability and culture a fearless and coura
geous Democrat and is concedeJ by all who
know him to be a man of unquestioned in
tegrity. The Convention might go further
and fare a great deal worse than nomination
John Hodgson. He poseesses in an eminent
degree, all the requirements for a faithful and

These articles are not second handed, but
are perfectly new, never having been used
in any manner' whatever. They were pro
enred by that excellent citizen and patriotic
gentleman. Marshal Sharpe, to be used by
him in subduing his fellow-citizens at the
ladt electioo, but on the eve of the election
Governor Hoffman made other arrangements.
And now these auxilaries of a free and en
lightened government are totally useless to
the present owners at least for the present,
and they cannot afford, to have their capital
therein invested lying idle waiting for an
other election to come around.
Marshal Sharpe, and the "beat goverement
the world ever saw" are unusually and ex
tremely anxious to realize immediately upon
these articles, and they will be disposed Jof
at ruinously cheap prices for ca6h. The
cash is needed at ones to pay about eleven
thousand ex-deputy marshals who performed
heroic services on the day of election, but
who have never received oue cent for their
teivicis, notwithstanding nearly three weeks
have eiapsed.
It is to be hoped that some loyal and pa
triotic citizene, some of those who poured
out their money so freely during the war,
will rush to the rescue cf the government in
this serious emergency. Come up, now, gen
tlemen ; make application at the office of
the United States Marshal. Do not hesitate.
nor be afraid, for these are good articles to
have on your hands, and the sale will be

Judge Pierce, on Saturday, hatched out his
long expected opinion, discharging Alexan
der W. Crawford from all legal responsibil
ity, for killing John C. Nolen. Even the
offence of carrying concealed weapons,
which, one would think, wa3 sufficiently
proved before his Honor, did not prevent
an absolute discharge. The legal doctrine of
tho opinion may be condensed into "shoot !
shoot!" It was tbe author of that doctrine
who was, in fact, on trial, and the coat of
white-wash, which Judge Pierce has been
so long in mixing, was intended for his Im
perial Highness, the King of the Ring. We
find a fitness in the title, from an analogy
that often strikes us. between American
Radicalism and French Imperialism. The
latter's last triumph was the free discharge,
by a partial tribunal, of the Imperial Prince.

General Grant is but the agent of a

War Nw8. War news from Franoe is
amazingly conflicting. The Germans claim
decided advantages in all the late actions.-
A telegram sent by King William to his
faithful Consort says : "Frederick Chaaries
reports the complete defeat of the Army of
the Loire in the battle of Monday, in which
the French had tbe Twentieth Corps, prob
ably the Eighteenth, and portions of the
Fifteenth and Sixteenth Corps engaged. A
thousand French were dead upon the held,
4,000 were wounded and 1,600 taken pris-
oners, Ueuerai u'Aureiies is reported to do
wounded. Tbe German loss was 1,000,
among them few officers." On the contrary.
the French General Chaugy reports that "on
the 9th instant an attack was made all along
the lines from Meung to St. Laurent Des
Bois. Last night and to-dny tbe principal
effort of the enemy was at Beaugency. The
Germans were very strong at that place,
having no less than eighty-six cannon.
Their forces consisted of two divisions of
Bavarians, one division of Prussians, 2,000
cavalry and a strong reserve under the com
mand of l rmce Frederick Charles and the
Duke of Mecklenburg. The enemy were,
repulsed, and driven beyond Grand Chartres.
We sleep to-night on the positions we bad
this morning. The prisoners taken ac
knowledge that the Prussians suffered heavy
losses. Tbe battle lasted till night." This
would indicate that the French army is still
in a fightiDg condition, and able to deliver
blows and win victories. It is said that a
division of the Prussian forces is marching
in the direction of Havre, for the purpose of
isolating that part from Parts and cutting
off the supply of arms from beyond the sea.
If this is done, it will be a bard blow upon
the French. The investment of Paris still
continues, and no sorties have been made
since the fight led by General Ducrot. That
General failed to pierce the Prussian lines,
but inflicted heavy losseB upon that portiou
of the army which bore the burden of the
onset. It is reported that Paris has food
enough for three months. But this cannot
be told. Age, 12th.
A Rai cf Blood. Tbe Sulphur Springs
(Texan) Gazette contains the following tuot
remarkable communiction :
Knowing that you are not given to sen
sationalism, I take this method of giving to
the public an item, the truth of which I can
testify as an eye witness, as can also some
others living in the neighborhood. On last
Sunday, the 2d inst., about eight o'clock in
the morning, some six miles south of Sul
phur Springs, when not a cloud was to be
seen to dim the blue vault of heaven, fell
what can be but termed a rain or shower of
blocd, which lasted 6ome eight or ten sec
onds. Its district was quite limited, and it
fell in specks about the size of squirrel shot,
and in density about one hundred to the
size of an ordinary plate.
This shower was witnessed by Mr. Bussy
and famity, who were seated around the
breakfast table in the yard, at the same
time before stated, when, upon a sudden,
came pattering the drops of blood upon
the dishes, victuals, and all around. Mr
Bussy immediately sect his little son for
me, whose clothes were bespattered with
blood on reaching my. house. An hour
elapsed, probably, before my reaching the
vicinity, yet the leaves, grass and table bore
tho distinctly visible marks cf blood. No
one in the vicinity can give an explanation
of this mysterjous affair. I leavo this mat
ter for the scrutiny of science and the light
of revelation. C. J. dcllivan.

A murder of unusual atrocity was per
petrated near .Now Bedford. Mass., week
Vefore last. The victim was Benjamin How
ard, eighty-two years cf age, who had lived
alouo more than forty years supporting him
self on a 6niall farm, and receiving an occa
sional visit from an aged sister. He had
been missed for several days, and upon
secrh being made bis mangled body was
dfscovered near a newly made hole or grave,
a few feet within a wood. Charles Clupp,
a negro boy, fifteen years of age, has been
arrested, and has confessed that he murdered
the old man, assisted by John Pettis, an
other boy about his own age. who has not
been arrested. The motive of their deed
was robbery, and the amonnt obtained was

A singular fact is noted in connection
with the burning to death of the family of
four persons near Markleville., Juniata coun

no effort to save themselves. At the inquest
physicians stated that before suffocation by
smoke would take place there would be a
struggle in an effort to escape, and the same
thing would occur as soon as they felt the
heat from fire : yet these four persons ap
peared In the same position they would

that gives rise to the suspicion that the fam
ily was first murdered and then the house
set on fire.
