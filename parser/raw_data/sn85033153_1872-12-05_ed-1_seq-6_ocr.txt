PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
To the Senate end House of Representatives:
In transmitting to you my fourth annual
message it is with thankfulness to the Giver
of all good, that as a nation we have been
blessed for the last year with peace at home
and abroad, and a general prosperity vouch
safed to but few people. With the excep
tion of the recent devastating fire, which
swept from earth with a breath, as it were,
millions of accumulated wealth in the city
of Boston, there have been no over-shadowing
calamities within the year to record. It is
gratifying to note how like their fellow citi
zens of the city of Chicago, under similar
circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of
Boston are rallying under their misfortunes,
and the prospect is that their energy and
perseverance will overcome all obstacles and
show the same prosperity soon that they
wonld have had, had no disaster befallen
them. Otherwise, we have been free from
pestilence, war and the calamities which
often overtake nations. And, as far as
human judgment can penetrate the future,
no cause seems to exist to threaten our
present peace.
THE GENEVA ARBITRATION.
When Congress adjourned in June last, a
question had been raised by Great Britain,
and was then pending, which for a time se
riously imperiled the settlement by friendly
arbitration of the differences existing be
tween this Government and that of Her Bri
tannic Majesty, which, by the Treaty of
Washington, had been referred to the tribu
nal of arbitration which had met at Geneva,
in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however,
disposed of the question which had jeopar
dized the whole of the treaty and threatened
to Involve the two nations in most unhappy
relations toward each c*’"* a manner en
tirely satisfactory to this Government,
and in accordance with the views
and the policy which it had main
tained. The tribunal which had convened
in Geneva, in December, concluded its labo
rious session on the 14th day of September
last, on which day, having availed itself of
tbe discretionary power given to it by the
treaty to award a sum in gross, it made its
decision whereby it awarded the sum of
§15,500,000 in gold, as the indemnity to be
paid by Great Britain to the United States
for the satisfaction of all the claims referred
to its consideration. This decision, happily,
disposes of a long standing difference be
tween two governments, and in connection
with another award made by the German
Emperor under a reference to him by the
same treaty, leaves the two governments
without a shadow upon the friendly relations
which it Is my sincere hope may forever re
main equally unclouded.
The report of the agent of the United
States, appointed to attend the Geneva Tri
bunal, accompanied by the protocols of tbe
proceedings of tbe arbitrators, th; argu
ments of the counsel of both governments,
the award of the tribunal, and the opinions
given by the several arbitrators is transmit
ted herewith.
I have caused to be communicated to the
heads of the three friendly powers who com
plied ■with the joint request made to them
under the Treaty the thanks of this Govern
ment for the appointment of arbitrators
made by them respectively, and also my
thanks to the eminent personages named by
them, and my appreciation of the dignity,
patience, impartiality and great ability with
which they discharged their arduous and
high functions.
Her Majesty’s Government has communi
cated to me the appreciation by Her Majesty
of the ability and indefatigable industry dis
played by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named
on the part of this Government, during the
protracted inquiries and discussions of the
Tribunal. I cordially unite with Her Majes
ty in this appreciation.
It is due to the agent of the United State'
before the Tribunal, to record my appi eola
tion of the marked ability, unwearied
patience, and the prudence and discretion
with which he has conducted the very re
sponsible and delicate duties committed to
him. And it is also due to the learned and
eminent counsel, who attended tbe Tribunal
on the part of this Government, to express
my sense of the talent and wisdom which
they brought to bear in the argument of the
result so happily reached. It will be the pro
vince of Congress to provide for the distri
bution, among those -who are entitled to it,
of their respective shares of the money to
be paid.
.although the sum awarded in not payable
until i year from the date of the award,
it is deemed advisable that no time be lost
in making a proper examination of the sev
eral cases in which indemnification may be
due. I consequently recommend the crea->
tion of a board of Commissioners for the
purpose.
THE SAN JUAN BOUNDARY QUESTION.
By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty
of Washington the respective claims of the
United States and of Great Britain in their
construction of the treaty of the 15th June,
1846, defining the boundary line between
their respective territories, were submitted
to the arbitration and award of Ills Majesty
the Emperor of Germany, to decide which of
these claims is most in accordance with the
true interpretation of the treaty of 1846. His
Majesty the Emperor of Germany having
been pleased to undertake the arbitration
has the earnest thanks of this Government
and of the people of the United States for
the labor, pairs, and care which he has de
voted to the consideration of this long
pending difference. I have caused an ex
pression of my thanks to be communicated
to His Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the represen
tative of this Government at Berlin,
conducted the case and prepared the
statement on the part of the United
States with the ability that his
past service justified the public in expecting
at. his hands. Asa member of the Cabinet
at the date of the Treaty which has given
rise to the discussion between the two Gov
ernments; as the Minister to Great Britain
when the construction now pronounced* un
founded was first advanced, and as the agent
and representative of the Government to
present the case and to receive the award,
he has been associated with the question in
all its phases, and in every stage has mani
fested a patriotic zeal and earnestness in
maintenance of the claim of the United
States. He i# entitled to much credit for
the success which has attended the submis
sion, after a patient investigation of the
case, and of the statements of each party.
Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, on
the 21st dav of October last, signed his
award in writing, decreeing that the claim
of the Government of the United States
that the boundary line between the Terri
ritories of Her Britannic Majesty and the
United States should be drawn through the
Haro channel, is most in accordance with
the true interpretation of the treaty conclud
ed on the 15th of June. 1546, between the
agents of Her Britannic Majesty and of the
United States.
Copies of the case presented on behalf of
each Government, and of the statement in
reply of each, and a translation of the ard
arc transmitted herewith. This awa. con
firms the United States in their claim to the
important archipelago of islands lying be
tween the conti .ent and Vancouver’s Island,
which for twenty six years, ever since the
ratification of the treaty, Great Britain has
contested, and leaves us foi the first time in
the history of the United States as a nation
without a question of disputed boundary
between onr Territory and the possessions
of Great Britain on this continent.
It is my grateful duty to acknowledge the
prompt, spontaneous action ef Her Majes
ty’s Government in giving effect to the
award. In anticipation of any request from
this Government, and before the reception
in the United States of the award signed by
the Emperor, Her Majesty had given Instruc
tions for the removal of her troops, which
had been stationed there, and for the cessa
tion of all exercise or claim of jurisdiction,
so as to leave the United States in
conclusive possession of the lately disputed
territory. I am grateful to he able to an
nounce that the orders for the removal of
the troops have been executed, and the mil
itary joint occupation of Sau Juan ha.-
ceased. The islands are now in the exclu
sive possession of the United States. It
now becomes necessary to complete the
survey and determination of thar, portion ol
the boundary line through the Haro Canal,
upon which the Commission which deter
mined the remaining part of the line were
unable to agree.
I recommend the appointment of a Com
mission to act jointly with one which may
bv nanac-d by Her Majesty for Hut purpose.
Experience of the difficulties attending the
determination of our admitted line of bound
ary, after the occupation of the terrritory
and its settlement by those owing allegi
ance to the respective Governments, points
to the importance of establishing, by nat
ural objects or other monuments, the actual
line between the territory acquired by pur
chase from Russia, and the adjoinmg pos
sessions of Her Brittannic Majesty. The
region is now so sparsely occupied that
no conflicting interests of individ
uals, or of jurisdiction, are likely to
interfere to the delay or embarrassment of
the actual location of the line. If deferred
until population shall enter and occupy the
territory, some trivial contest of neighbors
may again array the two Governments in an
tagonism. I therefore recommend the ap
pointment of a Commission to act jointly
with one that may be appointed on the part
of Great Britain, to determine the line be
tween our territory of Alaska and_ the co
terminous posessions of Great Britain.
THE FISHERIES.
In my last annual message, I recommend
ed the legislation necessary on the part of
the United States to bring into operation
the articles of the Treaty of Washington of
May, 1871, relating to the fisheries, and to
other matters touching the relations of the
United States toward the British North
American possessions, to become opera
tive so soon as the proper legislation
should be had on the part of Great Britain
and the possessions. That legisla
tion on the part of Great Britain
and its possessions had not then been had,
and during the session of Congress a ques
tion was raised, which for the time raised a
doubt whether any action by Congress in
the directionindicated would become impor
tant —a question which has since been dis
posed of, and I have received notice that the
Imperial Parliament and the Legislature of
the Provincial Government laws
to carry the provisions of the Treaty on the
matters referred to into operation. I there
fore recommend your early adaption of the
legislation in the same dirditiou necessary
on the part of this Government.
The Joint Commission for determining the
boundary line between the United States and
the British Possessions, between the Lake of
the Woods and the Rocky Mountains, has
organized and entered upon its work. It is
desirable that the force be increased, in or
der that the completion of the survey and
determination of the boundary line may be
sooner attended to. To this end I recom
mend that a sufficient appropriation be
made.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
With France, our earlier ally; Russia, the
constant and steady friend of the United
States; Germany, wth whose Government
and people we have so many causes of friend
ship and so many common sympathies, and
the other powers of Europe, our relations
are maintained on the most friendly terms.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been made of the ratifications of a Treaty
with the Austro-Hungary Empire, relative
to naturalization; also, of a Treaty with the
German Empire respecting Consuls and
trade marks; also of a Treaty with Sweden
and Norway relative to naturalization —all
of which treaties have been duly proclaimed.
Congress, at its last session, having made
an appropriation to defray the expenses of
Commissioners on the part of the United
States to the International Statistical Con
gress at St. Petersburg, the persons ap
pointed in that chaiacter proceeded to their
destination, and attended the session of the
Congress. Their report shall, in due sea
son, be laid before you. This Congress meets
at intervals of about three years, and has
held its sessions in several of the countries
of Europe. I submit to your consideration
the propriety of extending an invitation to
the Congress to hold its next meeting in the
United States. The Centennial Celebration
to be held in 1876 would afford an appropri
ate occasion for such meeting. Preparations
are making for the International Exposition
to be held during the next year in Vienna on
a scale of very great magnitude. The ten
dency of these expositions is in the direc
tion of advanced civilization, and the ra
tion of industry, of labor, and the increase
of human happiness, as well as of the great
er intercourse and good will between na
tions. As this Exposition is to be
the first which will hatfe been held
in Eastern Europe, it is believed
that American inventors and manufacturers
will be ready to avail themselves of the op
portunity for the presentation of their pro
ductions, if cucouraged by proper aid and
protection. At the last session of Congress
authority was given for the appointment of
one or more agents to represent this Gov
ernment at the Exposition. The authority
thus given has been exercised, but in the
absence of any appropriation there is dan
ger that the important benefits which the
Exposition offers will in a large degrre be
lost to citizens of the United States. I com
mend the subject strongly to your
consideration, and recommend that
an adequate appropriation be made
for the purpose. To further aid
American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposi
tion, I would recommend in addition to an
appropriation of money, that the Secretary
of the Navy be authorized to fit up two na
val vessels to transport between our Atlan
tic cities and Trieste or the most convenient
port to Vienna and back, their articles for
exhibition.
MEXICO.
Since your last session the President of
the Mexican Republic, distinguished by his
high character and by his services to his
country, has died. His temporary successor
has now been elected with great uninimity
by the people. A proof of confidence on
their part in his patriotism and wisdom
which it is believed will be confirmed by the
results of his administration.
It is particularly desirable that nothing
should be left undone by the Government of
either Republic to strengthen their relations
as neighbors and friends. It is much to be
regretted that many lawless acts continue to
disturb the quiet of the settlements on the
border between our territory and that of
Mexice, and that complaints of wrong to
American citizens in various parts of the
country are made. The revolutionary con
dition in which the neighboring Republic
has so long been involved, bas in some de
gree contributed to this disturbance.
It is to be hoped that, with a more settled
rule of order through the Republic, which
may he expected from the present Govern
ment, the acts of which just complaint is
made will cease.
The proceedings of the Commission under
the Convention with Mexico of the 4th of
July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have
unfortunately been checked by an obstacle
for the removal of which measures have been
taken by the two Governments, which it is
believed will prove successful.
The Commissioners appointed pursuant
to the joint resolutions of Congsess of the
7th of May last, to inquire into depredations
on the Texas frontier, have diligently made
investigations in that quarter. Their report
upon the subject will be communicated to
you. Their researches were necessarily in
complete, partly on account of the limited
appropriation made by Congress. Mexico,
on the part of that Government, has ap
pointed a similar Commission to investigate
these outrages.
It is not announced officially, but the press
of that country state that the fullest investi
gation is desi-_d, and that the co-operation
of all parties concerned is invited to secure
that end. I therefore recommend that a
special appropriation be made at the earliest
day practicable, to enable the Commission
ers on the part of the United States to re
turn to their labors without delay.
CUBA..
It is with regret that I have again to an
nounce a continuance of the disturbed con
dition of the Island of Cuba. No advance
toward the pacification of the discontented
portion of the population has been made,
while the insurrection has gained no advan
tages and exhibits no more of the elements
of power or of the prospect of ultimate suc
cess than were exhibited a year ago. Spain,
on the other hand, has not succeeded in its
repression, and the parties stand apparently
in the same relative attitude which they
have occupied for a long time past. This
contest has lasted now for more than four
years. Were it seen at a distance from our
neighborhood we might be indifferent to its
result, although humanity could not be un
moved by many of its incidents whenever
they might occur. It is, however, at our door.
I cannot doubt that the continued main
tenance of slavery in Cuba is among the
strongest inducements to the continuance
of this strife. A. terrible wrong is the natu
ral cause of a terrible evil.
The abolition of slavery and the introduc
tion of other reforms in the administration
of government in Cuba could not fail to ad
vance the restoration of peace and order.
It is especially to he hoped that the present
liberal Government of Spain will volun
tarilv adopt this view'. The law of emanci
p*Uon, which was passed were than two
years since, has remained unexecuted in the
absence of regulations for its enforcement.
It was bnt a feeble step toward emancipa
tion, but it was the recognition of right, and
was hailed as such, and exhibited Spain in
harmony with the sentiments of humanity
and of justice, end in sympathy with the
other powers of the Christian and civilized
world. Within the past few weeks the reg
ulations for carrying out the laws
of emancipation have been announced,
giving evidence of the sincerity of
intention of the present Government to
carry into effect the law of 1870. _ I
have not failed to urge the consideration
of the wisdom, the policy, and the justice of
a more effective system for the abolition of
the great evil which has oppressed a race,
and continues a bloody and destructive con
test close to our border, as well as the expe
diency and the justice of conceding reforms,
of which the propriety is not questioned.
Deeply impressed with the conviction that
the continuance of slavery is one of the most
active causes of the continuance of the un
happy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe
that citizens of the United States, or those
claiming to be such, are large holders in
Cuba of what is there claimed as property,
bnt which is forbidden and denounced by
the laws of the United States. They are
thus, in defiance of the spirit of our own
laws, contributing to the continuance of the
distressing and sickening contest. In my
last annual message I referred to this sub
ject, and I again recommend such legislation
as may be proper to denounce, and, if not
prevent, at least to discourage American
citizens from holding or dealing in slaves.
SPAIN AND SOUTH AMERICA.
It is gratifying to announce that the rati
fication of the convention concluded under
the auspices of this Government, between
Spain on the one part and the, allied repub
lics of the Pacific on the other, providing
for an armistice, have been exchanged. A
copy of the instrument is herewith submit
ted. It is hoped that this may be followed
by a permanent peace between the same
parties.
The differences which at one time threat
ened the maintenance of peace be
tween Brazil and the Argentine Republic, it
is hoped are in the way of satisfactory ad
justment. With these States, as with the Re
publics of Central and South Amer
ica, we continue to maintain the
most friendly relations. It is
with regret, however, I announce that the
Government of Venezuela has made no fur
ther payments on account of the awards un
der the convention of the 25th of April,
1866. That Republic is understood to be.
now almost, if not quite,
hoped, therefore, that it will lose no time in
providing for the unpaid balance of its debt
to the United States, which, having origin
ated in injui'es to its citizens by Venezuelan
authorities, and having been acknowledged
pursuant to a treaty :uthe most solemn form
known among nations, would seem to de
serve a preference cv~r debts of a different
origin, and contracted in a different manner.
This subject is again recommended to the
attention of Congress for such action as may
be deemed proper.
CHINA AND JAPAN.
Our treaty relations with Japan remain
unchanged. An imposing embassy from
that interesting and progressive nation has
visited this country during the year that is
passing, but being unprovided with powers
for the signing of a convention in this
country, no conclusion in that direction was
reached. It is hoped, however, that the in
terchange of opinion, which took place dur
ing their stay in this country has led to a
mutual appreciation of the interests there
which may be promoted when the revision of
the existing Treaty shall be undertaken. In
this connection I renew my recommendation
of one year ago that to give importance and
efficiency to our diplomatic relations with
Japan and China, and to further and in main
taining the good opinion of these people and
to secure to the United States its share of
the commerce destined to flow between these
nations and the balance of the world, an ap
propriation be made to support at least four
American youths in each of these countries,
to serve as a part of the official family of
our ministers. Our representatives would
not even then be placed upon an equality
with the representatives of Great Britain or
some other powers. As now situated, our
Representatives in Japan and China have to
depend for interpreters and translation
upon natives of those countries, who know
oht language imperfectly, or procure for
llie occasion Lius BUFVICtJK ul* employes in for
eign business houses, or the interpreter to
other Foreign Ministers.
I renew the recommendation made on a
previous occasion, of the transfer to the De
partment of the Interior, to which they seem
more appropriately to belong, of all the
powers and duties in relation to the Territo
ries with which the Department of State is
now charged by law T or by custom.
Congress, from the beginning of the Gov
ernment, has wisely made provision for the
relief of distressed seamen in foreign coun
tries. No similar provision, however, has
hitherto been made for the relief of citizens
in distress abroad, other than seamen. It is
understood to be customary with other
governments to authorize Consuls to extend
such relief to their citizens or subjects in
certain cases.
A similar authority, and an appropriation
to carry it into effect, are recommended in
case of citizens of the United States desti
tute or sick under such circumstances. It
is well known that such citizens resort to
foreign countries in great numbers, though
most of them are able to bear the expenses
incident to locomotion. There are some
who, through accident or otherwise, be
come penniless and have no friends at home
able to succor them. Persons in this
situation must either perish, cast
themselves upon the charity of
foreigners, or he relieved at the private
charge of our own officers, who usually,
even with the most benevolent dispositions,
have nothing to spare for such purposes.
Should the authority and appropriation
asked for be made, care will be taken to
carry the beneficence of Congress into ef
fect that it shall not be unnecessarily or
unworthily bestowed.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT.
The moneys received and carried into the
Treasury during the fiscal year ending June
SO, 1872, were: From customs, $216,370,-
236.77; from sales of public lands, $2 575,-
714.19; from internal revenue, $130,642,177-
.72; from tax on national bank circulation,
$6,523,396.39; from Pacific Railroad Com
panies, $749,861.87; from customs’ fines,
etc., $1,136,443.34; from fees, pat
ent, land, etc., $2,284,095.92; from miscel
laneous sources, $4,412,254.71. Total ordi
nary receipts, $364,694,229 91; from premi
ums on sales of coin, $9,412,637.65. Total net
receipts, $374,106,867.56. Balance in Treas
ury June SO, 1871, $109,935,705.59, in
cluding $1,823,835 received from
unavailable sources. Total available cash,
$484,043,573.15. The net expenditures by
warrants during the same period were for
civil expenses, $16,189,079.70; for foreign in
terests, $18,409,369 14; Indians, $7,065,728.83 ;
pensions, $28,533,402.76; for military estab
lishment, including fortifications, river and
harbor improvements, and arsenals, $35,373,-
157.20 ; for naval establishments, including
vessels and machinery and improvements at
navy yards, $21,249,809.99; for miscellaneous
civil, ” including public buildings, light
houses, and collecting the revenue, $42,958,-
329.C5; interest on the public debt, $117,-
357,839.72. Total, exclusive of principal and
premium on public debt, $270,559,695.91 ; for
premium on bonds purchased, $4,958,7ti6.76 ;
for redemption of the ' iiblic debt, $99,960,-
353.54. Total, $106,91 ,520.30. Total net
disbursements, $377.47 216.21. Balance in
the Treasury. June 30, 1872, $185,643,569.48.
Total. $484,012,573.15.
From the foregoing statement it appears
that the net reduction of the principal of
the debt during the fiscal year ending June
30, 1873, was *99,090,253.54. .
The source of the reduction is as follows:
Net ordinary receipts during the year, 8346,-
694,329.91; net ordinary expenditures, in
cluding interest on the public debt, 8370,-
559,695.91; total, 894,134,534 00. Add
amount of receipts from premium on sales
of gold in excess of the premium paid on
bonds purchased, 83,454,470,89. Add
amount of a reduction of the cash balance
at the close the of year, accompanied with
sales at the commencement of the year,
8337,346.65; total, 899,960,353.54. This state
ment treats solely of the principal of the
public debt. By the monthly statement of
the public debt, which adds together the
principal and interest due and unpaid, and
interest accrued to date, due, and deducts
the cash in the Treasury, ou the
day of publication the reduction was
8100,544,491.38. The source of this reduc
tion is as follows: Reduction in principal
account, 899,960,003.5-1; reduction in unpiaid
interest account, 83,330,952.96; total, 8103,-
390,956.95. Reduction in cash on hand,
83,746,465.23; total, 8100,544,491.28. On the
basis o$ tie last table, the statements show
a reduction of the public debt from the Ist
of March, 1869, to the present time, as fol
lows: From March Ist, 1869, to March Ist,
1870, 887,134,782.84; from March Ist, 1870, to
March Ist, 1871, 8117,619,630.25; from March
Ist, 1871, to March Ist, 1872, 894,895,348.94;
from March Ist, 1872, to November Ist, 1872 I
696,999.87. W ith the great reduction of
taxation by the acts of Congress at its last
session, the expenditure of the,Qovernment
in collecting the revenue will be much re
duced for the next fiscal year. It is very
doubtful, however, whether any further re
duction of so vexatious a burthen upon any
people will be practicable for the present.
At all events, as a measure of justice to the
holders of the national certificates of in
debtedness, 1 would recommend that no
more legislation be had upon the subject,
unless it be to correct errors of omission or
commission in the present laws, until suffi
cient time has elapsed to prove that it can
oe done and still leave sufficient revenue to
meet the current expenses of the Govern
ment, pay interest on the public debt, and ;
provide tor the sinking fund established by I
law. The preservation of our national cred
it is of the highest importance. Next in I
importance to this comes a solemn duty to |
provide a national currency of fixed, unvary
ing value as compared with gold, as soon as
practicable, having due regard for the in
terests of the debtor class and the vicissi
tudes of trade and commerce—and convert
ble into gold at par.
WAS DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
the expenditures of the War Department for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, to be
835,799,991.88 ; and for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1872, total, $35,372,157.20, showing
a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of
$427,834.62.
The estimates for military appropriations
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1874, are
$3,380,137,879. The estimates of the Chief
of Engineers are submitted separately, for
fortification, river and harbor improvements,
and for public buildings and grounds, and
the Washington aqueduct. The affairs of
the Freedmen’s Bureau have all been trans
ferred to the War Department ; and regula
tions have been put into execution for the
speedy payment of bounty, pay, etc., due
colored soldiers, properly coming under that
Bureau. All war accounts for money and
property prior to 1871, have been examined
and transmitted to the Treasury for final
settlement.
During the fiscal year there has been paid
for transportation on railroads $1,300,000, of
which $80,857 was over the Pacific railroads;
for transportation by water, $62(5,373.52, and
by stage, $48,975.84, and for the purchase of
transportation animals, wagons, hire of
teamsters, etc., etc., $924,650.64.
About $370,000 have been collected from
Southern railroads during the year, leaving
$4,000,000 still due.
The Quartermaster has examined and
transmitted to the Accounting officer for
settlement, $367,172.72 of claims by loyal
citizens for Quartermasters’ extras taken
during the war. Subsisting supplies to the
amount of $8,904,812 have been issued to
Indians,
The annual average mean strength of the
army was 24,210 white and 2,494 colored
soldiers. The total deaths for the year re
ported were 367 white and 54 colored.
The distribution of the medical and sur
gical history of the war is yet to be ordered
by Congress. There exists an absolute ne
cessity for a medical corps of the full num
ber established by act of Congress of July
28, 1866, there being now 59 vacancies, and
the number of successful candidates rarely
exceeds eight or ten in any one year.
The river and harbor improvements have
been carried on with energy and economy,
though many are only partially completed.
The results have saved to commerce many
times the amount expended. The increase
of commerce, With greater depth of chan
nels, greater security in navigation, and the
saving of time, adds much to the w ealth of
the country and increases the resources of
the Government.
The bridge across the Mississippi River at
Rock Island has been completed, and the
proper site has been determined upon for
the bridge at La Crosse.
The able and exhaustive report made by
the Commission appointed to investigate the
Sutro Tunnel has been transmitted to Con
gress.
The observations and report of the Signal
office have been continued. Stations have
been maintained at each of the principal
lake sea ports and river cities. Ten addi
tional stations have been established in the
United States, and arrangements have been
made for exchange of reports with Canada,
and similar exchange of observations is con
templated with the West India Islands.
The favorable attention of Congress is in
vited to the following recommendations of
the Secretary of War: A discontinuance of
the appointment of extra lieutenants,to serve
as adjutants and quartermasters.
The adoption of a code providing specific
penalties for well defined offenses, so that
the inequality of sentences adjudged by
courts-martial may he adjusted.
The consolidation of accounts under whhh
expenditures are made, as a measure oi
economy.
A re-appropriation of the money for the
construction of a depot at San Antonio, the
title to the site being now perfected.
A special act placing the cemetery at the
City of Mexico on the same basis as other
national cemeteries.
Authority to purchase sites for military
posts in Texas.
The appointment of Commissary Ser
geants from non-commissioned officers, as a
measure for securing the better care and
protection for supplies, and appropriation
for the catalogues and tables of the anat
omical section of the Army Medical Mu
seum.
A re appropriation of the amount for the
manufacture of breech-loading arms should
the selection be so delayed by the Board of
officers to leave the former appropria
tions unexpended at the close of the fiscal
year.
The sale of such arsenals east of the Mis
sissippi as can be spared, and the proceeds
applied to the establishment of one large
arsenal of construction and repair upon the
Atlantic coast ; and the purchase of a suita
ble site for a proving and experimental
ground for heavy ordnance.
The abrogation of laws which deprive in
ventors in the United States service from de
riving any benefit from their inventions.
The repeal of the law prohibiting promo
tions in the staff corps.
.A continuance of the work upon the coast
defenses.
The repeal of the 7th section of the act of
July 13, 1866, taking from engineer soldiers
the per diem granted to other troops.
A limitation of the time for presentation
of claims for subsistence supplies, under
the act of July 4, 1364, and a in
the mode of the selection of cadets fo he
military academy, in order to enhance the
usefulness of the academy, which is impaired
by reason of the large amount of time neces
sarily expended in giving new cadets a
thorough knowledge of the more elementary
branches of learning, which they should
acquire before entering the academy. Also
an appropriation for philosophical apparatus
and an increase 'H the number and the pay
of the
MILITARY ACADEMY BAND,
The attention of Congress will be called
during its present session to various enter
prises for the more certain and cheaper
transportation of the constantly increasing
surplus of the Western and Southern pro
ducts to the Atlantic sea board. The sub
ject is one that will force itself upon the
legislative branch of the Government
sooner or 1-ter, and I suggest, therefore
that immediate steps be taken to gam all
available information to insure equitable
and just legislation. The route to connect
the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic at
Charleston, S. C., and Savannah, Ga., by
water, by the way of the Ohio and Tennes
see River and canals, and slack water navi
gation to the Savannah and Ocmulgee
rivers, has been surveyed and report made
by an accomplished engineer of the army.
Second and third new routes will be pro
posed for the consideration of Congress,
namelv, bv an extension of the Kanav.Ua
and James”river canal to the Ohio, and by
extension of the Chesapeake and Ojiio ranal.
I am not prepaied to recommend Govern
ment aid to these or other enterprises, until
it is clearly shown that they aie not only of
national interest, but that when competed
they will be of a value commensurate with
their cost. That production increases more
rapidly than the means of transportation
in our country, has been demonstrated
bv past experience. That the unprecedented
growth in population and products of the
whole country wiil require audit.oual facili
tics and cheaper means for the more bu.ky
articles of commerce to reach tide w ater and
a market will be demanded in tife near fu
ture is equally demonstrable I wovw
therefore suggest either that a committee
or commissioner be authorized to consider
this whole question, and to report to Con
gress at some future day for its better guid
ance in legislating on the important subject.
The railroads of the country have been rap
idly extended during the last few years to
meet the growing demands of producers,
and reflect much credit upon the capitalists
and managers engaged in their construc
tion. In addition to these, a project to
facilitate commerce by the building of a
ship canal around Niagara Falls, on
the United States side, which has
been agitated for many years, will no
doubt be called to your attention this ses
sion. Looking to the great future of the
country, and the increasing demands of
commerce, it might be well, while on this
subject, not only to have examined and re
ported upon the various practicable routes
for connecting the Mississippi with tide
water, but the feasibility of an almost con
tinuous land-locked navigation from Maine
to the Gulf of Mexico, Such a route along
our coast would he of great value at all
times, and of inestimable value in case of a
foreign war. Nature has provided the great
er part of this route, and the obstacles to
be overcome are easily within the skill of the
engineer.
I have not alluded te this subject with the
view of having any further expenditure of
public money, at this time, than may be
necessary to procure and place all the ne
cessary information before Congress in an
authentic form to enable it hereafter, if
deemed practicable and worthy, to legislate
on the subject without delay.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy,
herewith accompanying, explains fully the
condition of that branch of the public ser
vice, its wants and deficiencies, expenses
incurred during the past year, and appropri
ations for the same. It also gives a com
plete history of the service of the navy for
the past year, in addition to its regular ser
vices. It is evident that unless steps aie
taken to preserve our navy that in a very
few years the United States will |Jbe the
weakest nation upon the ocean of all the
great powers. With an energetic, progress
ive business people like ours, penetrating
and forming business relations with every
part of the known world, a navy, strong
enough to command the respect of our flag
abroad, is necessary for the full protection
of their rights. I recommend careful eon
| sideration by Congress of the recoin men d
| ations made by the Secretary of the Navy.
POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The accompanying report of the Post
master General furnishes a full and satisfac
tory exhibit of the operations of the Post
office Department during the year. The
ordinary revenues of the department for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1872, amounted
to $21,915,426.37, and the expenditures $26,
658,192.21. Compared with the previous fis
cal year, the increase of revenue was $1,878,-
380.95, or 9.37 per cent., and the increase of
expenditures $2,268,088.23, or 9.29 per cent.
Adding to the ordinary revenues, the an
nual appropriation of $700,000 for free mat
ter, and "the amounts paid ir. subsidies on
mail steamship lines from special appropria
tions, the deficiency paid out of the general
treasury was $3,317,765.94 —an excess of
$389,707.28 over the deficiency for the year
1871. O ther interesting statistical information
relating to our rapidly extending postal
service, is furnished in this report. The total
length of railroad mail routes on the 30th of
June, 1872, was 57,911 miles, 8,077 additional
miles of such service having been put into
operation during the year; eight new lines
of railway post-offices have been established,
with an aggregate length of 2,909 miles. The
number of letters exchanged in the mails
with foreign countries was 24,362,500, an in
crease ox 4,066,502, or twenty per cent, over
the number in 1871, and the postage thereon
amounts to $1,871,257.25. The total weight
of the mails exchanged with European coun
tries exceeded 820 tons. The cost of the
United States trans-Atlantic mail steamship
service was $220,301.70. The total cost of
the United States ocean steamship service,
including the amounts paid to the
subsidized lines fof mail steamers, was
$1,027,020.97. The following are the
only steamship lines now receiving
subsidies for mail service under
special acts of Congress: The Pacific Mail
Steamship Company receive $500,000 per an
num for carrying a monthly mail between
San Francisco, Japan and China, which will
be Increased to $1,000,000 per asT"n, and a
semi-monthly mail, on and after October 1.
1873. The United States and Brazil Mail
Steamship Company receive $150,000 per an
num for carrying a monthly mail between
New York and Rio Janeiro, Brazil, and the
California, Oregon A Mexico Steamship
Company receive $75,000 per annum, for car
rying a monthly mail between San Francis
co, Honolulu, and Hawaiian Islands. Mak
ing the total amount of mail steamship sub
sidies at present $725,000 per annum. Our
postal communications with all parts of the
civilized world have been placed upon a
most advantageous footing by the improved
postal conveniences and arrange
ments recently concluded with the
leading commercial countries of
Europe and America, and the
gratifying statement is made that, with the
conclusion of a satisfactory convention with
France, the details of which have been
definitely agreed to by the head of the
French Postal Department, subject to the
approval of the Minister of Finance, little
remains to he accomplished by treaty
for some time to come, in respect to reduc
tion of rate, or improved facilities for postal
intercourse.
Your favorable consideration is respectful
ly invited to the recommendation made by
the Postmaster General for an increase of
service from monthly to semi-monthly trips,
on the mail steamship route to Brazil ; for a
subsidy in aid of the establishment of an
American lino of steamers between San
Francisco, New Zealand and Australia ; for
the establishment of post-office savings
banks, and for the increase of the salaries of
the heads of bureaus.
I have heretofore commended the abolition
of the franking privilege, and see no reason
now for changing my views on that subject.
It not having been favorably regarded by
Congress, however, I now suggest a modifi
cation of that privilege to correct its glaring
and costly abuses.
I would recommend, also, the appoint
ment of a committee or commission to take
into consideration the best method, equita
ble to private corporations who have in
vested their time and capital in the estab
lishment of telegraph lines, of acquiring the
title to all telegraph lines now in operation,
and of connecting this service with the
postal service of the nation. It is not
probable that this subject could receive the
proper consideration during the limits of
a short session of Congress, but it may
be initiated, so that further action may
be fair to the Government and to private
parties concerned; there are hut three lines
of ocean steamers, namely: the Pacific-Mail
Steamship Company between San Francisco,
China and Japan, with provision made for
semi monthly service after October Ist,
1873; the United States and Brazil line,
monthly; and the California, New Zealand
and Australian line, monthly—plying be
tween the United States and foreign ports,
and owned and operated under our flag. I
earnestly recommend that suen liberal con
tracts for carrying the mails be authorized
with these lines as will insure their continu
ance. If the expediency of extending the
aid of the Government to lines of steamers
which hitherto have not received it, should
be deemed worthy of the consideration of
Congress, political and commercial ob
jects make it advisable to bestow
such aid on a line under our flag be
fween Panama and the western South Amer
ican ports. By this means much trade now
diverted to other countries might be brought
to the United States, to the mutual advan
tage of this country and those lying in that
quarter of the continent of America.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas
ury will show an alarming falling off in our
carrying trade for the last ten or twelve
years, and even for the past year. I do not
believe that public treasure can be better ex
pended in the interest of the whole peoide
than in trying to recover this trade by an
expenditure of five million dollars per an
num for the next five years, if it would re
store to us our proportion of the carrying
trade of the world, would be profitably ex
nendad. The price of labor in Europe has so
much enhanced within the last few years,
that the cost of building and operating
ocean steamers in the United States is not
so much greater than in Europe, that I be
lieve the lime has arrived for Congress to
take this subject into serious consider
ation.
DETAILED STATEMENTS.
Detailed statements of the disbursements
through the department of justice will be
lurnished by the report of the Attorney-
General, and though these have been some- :
wiiat increased by tbe recast acts of Con* 1
gress to enforce the rights of citizens of the
United States to vote in the several States
of the Union, and to enforce the provisions
of the fourteenth amendment to the Con
stitution of the United States, and the
amendments thereto, I cannot question the
necessity and salutary effect of these enact
ments. Reckless and lawless men, I regret
to say, have associated themselves
together in some localities to deprive
other citizens of the rights guaranteed
them by the Constitution of the
United States, and to that end
have committed deeds of violence, but
the conviction and punishment of many of
these persons have tended greatly to the re
pression of such disorders. Ido not doubt
that a great majority of the people in all
parts of the country favor a full enjoyment
by all classes of persons of those rights to
which they are entitled under the Constitu
tion and the laws, and to invoke the aid of
all good citizens to prevent organizations
whose objects are by unlawful means to in
terfere with those rights. I look with con
fidence to the time not far distant when the
obvious advantages of good order and peace
will induce an abandonment of all combina
tions prohibited by the acts referred
to, and when it will be unnecessary to carry
on prosecutions or inflict punishments
to protect citizens for the lawless do
ings of such combinations. Applica
tions have been made to me to pardon
persons convicted of a violation of said acts,
upon the ground that clemency in such
cases would tend to tranquiiize the public
mind, and to test virtue of that policy I
ara disposed, as fa*as my sense of justice
will permit, to give to these applications a
favorable consideration, but any action
thereon is not to be construed as indicating
any change in my determination to enforce
with vigor such act so long as the conspira
cies and combinations therein named dis
turb the peace of the country. It is much
to be regretted, and is regretted by no one
more than myself, that a necessity has ever
existed to execute the enforcement act. No
one can desire more than I that the necessi
ty of applying it may never again be de
manded.
DEPAKTM9KT OF THE INTERIOR.
The Secretary mf the Interior reports sat
isfactory improvement and progression in
each of the several bureaus under the con
trol of cho Interior Department. They are
all in excellent condition. The work, which
in some of them for some years has been in
arrears, has been brought down to a recent
date, and in all the current business has been
promptly dispatched.
INDIANS.
The policy which was adopted at the be
ginning of the Administration with regard
to the management of the Indians has been
as successful as its most ardent friends an
ticipated within so short a time. It has re
duced the expense of their management,
decreased their forages upon the white set
tlements, tended to give the largest oppor
tunity to the extension of the great railways
through the public domain, and the pushing
of settlements into more remote districts of
the country, and at the same time improve
the condition of the Indians. The policy
will be maintained without any change, ex
cepting such as further experience may
show to be necessary to render it more effi
cient.
The subject of converting the so-called In
dian Territory south of Kansas into a home
for the Indians, and erecting thereon a Ter
ritorial form of government, is one of great
importance as a complement of the existing
Indian policy. The question of removal to
the Territory has within the past year been
presented to many of the tribes resident
upon other and less desirable portions of
the public domain, and has generally
been received by them with favor. Asa
preliminary step to the organization of such
a Territory, it will be necessary to confine
the Indians now resident therein to farms
of proper size, which should be secured to
them in fee. The residue to be used for the
settlement of our friendly Indians. Efforts
will be made in the immediate future to in
duce the removal of as many peaceably-dis
posed Indians only to the Indian Territory
as can be settled properly without disturb
ing the harmony of those already there.
There is no other location now available
where a people who are endeavoring to ac
quire a knowledge of pastoral and agricul
tural pursuits can be as well accommodated
as upon the unoccupied lands in the Indian
Territory. A Territorial government should,
however, protect the Indians from the in
roads of the Whites for a term of jcoio, no
til they become sufficiently advanced in the
arts and civilization to guard their own
rights, and from the disposal of lands held
by them for the same period.
THE PUBLIC LANDS.
During the last fiscal year there were dis
posed ot, out of the public lands, 11,864,975
acres, a quantity greater by 1,090,270 acres
than was disposed of the previous year. Of
this amount 1,370,320 acres were sold for
cash, 389,460 acres located with military war
rants, 4,671,332 acres were taken for home
steads, 693,613 acres located with college
scrip, 3,554,887 acres granted to railroads,
465,347 acres granted to wagon roads, 714,-
255 acres given to States as swamp land,
5,760 acres located by Indian scrip. The
cash receipts from all sources in the
Land Office amounted to *3,218,100. During
the same period 22,016,608 acres of the
public lands were surveyed, which,
added to the quantity before surveyed,
amounts to 583,364,780 acres, leaving 1,257,-
633,628 acres of the public lands still unsur
veyed. The reports from the subordinates
of the land office con tain interesting informa
tion in regard to their respective districts.
They uniformly mention the fruitfulness of
the soil during the past season, aud the in
creased yield of all kinds of produce. Even
in those States and Territories where min
ing is the principal business, the agricul
tural products have exceeded the local de
mand, and liberal shipments ha ve been made
to distant points.
PATENTS.
During the year ending September 30,1872,
there were issued from the patent office, 13,-
626 patents, 233 extensions, and 556 certifi
cates and registers of trade-marks. During
the same time, 19,587 applicators for pat
ents, including reissues and (resigns, have
been received, and 3,100 caveats filed. The
fees received during the same period
amounted to $700,959.86, and the" total ex
penditures to $623,553.90; making the net
receipts over the expenditures $77,400.56,
Since 1836, 200,000 applications for patents
have been filed, and about 134,000 pat
ents issued, the offices being conducted
under the same laws and general organiza
tion as were adopted at the original inau
guration, when only from 100 to 500 applica
tions were made per annum. The Commis
sioner shows that the office has outgrown
the original plan, and that anew organiza
tion has become necessary. This subject
was presented to Congress in a special com
munication in February last with my approv
al aud the approval of the Secretary of the
Interior, and the suggestions contained in
said communication were embraced in a bill
that was reported to the House
by the Committee on Patents at the last ses
sion. The subject of the reorganization of
the Patent Office, as contemplated by the
bill referred to, is of such importance to the
industrial interests of the country that 1
commend it to the attention of Congress.
The Commissioner also treats the subject of
the separation of the Patent Office from the
Department of the Interior. This subject is
also embraced in the bill heretofore referred
to. The Commissioner complains of the
want of room for the model gallery, and for
the working force and necessary files of the
office. It is impossible to transact the busi
ness of the office properly without more
room in which to arrange files and drawings
that must be consulted hourly in the trans
action of business. The whole of the
Patent Office building will soon be needed,
if it is not already, for the accommodation
of the business of the Patent Office.
PENSIONS.
The amount paid for pensions in the last
fiscal vear was $30,759,340; an amount larger
by $3,708,438 than was paid during the pre
ceding vear. Of this amount $23,134.09 were
paid under the act of Congress of February
17, 1871, to survivors of the war of 1812.
The annual increase of pensions by the legis
lation of Congress has more than kept pace
with the natural yearly losses from the ic'is.
The act of Congress of Tune 8, 1872. hes
added an estimated amount of #750,000 per
annum to the rolls without increasing tne
number of pensioners. We cannot, tnere
fore, look for any substantial decrease in the
expenditures of this department for some
time to come, or so long as Congress con
tinues to change the date.- of pensions. The
whole number of soldiers enlisted in the
war of the rebellion was 2,688,533. The to
tal number of claims for invalid pensions is
176,500, being but six per cent, ol the whole
number of enlisted men. The total number
of claims on hand at the beginning of the
Tear was 91,669: the number received dur
ing the year, 26,57*; tlig number flispoied
of, 85,178, making a net gain of 1,204.
The number of claims now on file ie
79,085. On the 30th of June, 1873, there
were on the rolls the names of 9,545 invalid
military pensioners, 113,518 widows, or
phans, and dependent relatives, making an
aggregate of 208,923 army pensioners. At
the same time there were on the rolls the
names of 1,449 navy pensioners, and 1,730
widows, orphans, and dependent relatives,
making the whole number of naval pension
ers 3,179. There have been received since
the passage of the act to provide pensions
for the survivors of the war of 1813, 36,551
applications, prior to June SO, 1873. Of
these there were allowed during the last fis
cal year 30,126 claims, and 4,845 were
rejected during the year, leaving
11,580 claims pending at that date.
The number of pensions of all classes
granted during the last fiscal year was 38,-
838. During that period there dropped from
the rolls for various causes 944 names, leav
ing a grand total of 332,229 pensions on the
rolls on the 30th of June, 1872. It is thought
that the claims for pensions on account of
the war of 1812 will be disposed of oy the
Ist of May, 1873. It is estimated that SBO,-
480,000 will be required for the pension ser
vice during the next fiscal year.
the CEXsrs.
The ninth census is about completed. Its
completion is a subject of congratulation,
inasmuch as the use to be made of the sta
tistics therein contained depends very gree t
ly on the promptitude of publication. The
Secretary of the Interior recommends that a
census be taken in 1875, which recommenda
tion should receive the ready attention of
Congress. The interval at present estab
lished between the Federal census is so long
that the information obtained at the decimal
periods as to the material condition, wants
and resoarces of the nation is of little prac
tical value after the expiration of the first
half of that period. It would probably
obviate the constitutional provision regard
ing the decimal censns-if a census taken In
1875 should be divested of all political char
acter, and no apportionment of Congression
al representation be made under it.
Such a census, coming as it would in the
last year of the first century of our national
existence, would furnish a noble monument
of the progress of the United States during
that century.
EDUCATION.
The rapidly increasing interest in educa
tion is a most encouraging feature in the
current history of the country, and it is no
doubt true that this is due ia a great meas
ure to the efforts of the Bureau of Educa
tion. That office is continually receiving
evidenceswhich abundantly prove its effi
ciency from the various institutions of learn
ing and educators of all kinds throughout
the country. The report of the Commission
contains a vast amount of educational details
of great interest. The bill now pendine be
fore Corigress providing for the appropria
tion of part of the proceeds of the sales of
public lands for educational purposes to aid
the States in the general education of the
rising generation, is a measure of such great
importance to our real progress, and is so
unanimously approved by the leading
friends of education, that I commend
it to the favorable attention of Con
gress.
AFFAIRS IN THE TERRITORIES
are generally satisfactory. The energy and
business capacity of the pioneers who arc
settling up the vast domain not yet incorpor
ated into States are keeping pace in internal
improvements and civil government with the
older communities. In but one of them,
Utah, is the condition of affairs unsatisfac
tory, except so far as the quiet of the citizen
may be disturbed by real or imaginary dan
ger of Indian hostilities. It has seemed to
be the policy of the Legislature of Utah to
evade all responsibility to the Government
of the United States, and even to hold a
position in hostility to it. I recommend a
careful revision of the present laws of the
Territory by Congress, and the enactment
of such a law as the one proposed in Con
gress at its last session, for instance, or
something similar to it, as w r ill secure peace,
the equality of citizens before the law,
and the utter extinguishment of polygamy.
Since the establishment of a Terri-
torial government for the District
of Columbia, the improvement of
the condition of the City of Washington
and surroundings, and the increased pros
perity of the citizens is observable to the
most casual visitor. The nation, being a
iarge owner of property ia the city, should
bear with the citizens of the district its just
share of the expense of these improvements.
I recommend, therefore, an appropriation to
reimburse the citizens for the work done by
them along and in front of the public
grounds during the past year, and liberal
appropriations in order that the improve
ment and embellishment of the public
buildings and grounds may keep pace with
the imrovements made by the Territorial
authorities.
AGRICULTURE.
The report of the Commissioner of Agri
culture gives a very full and interesting ac
count of the several divisions of that de
partment—the horticultural, agricultural,
statistical, entomological and chemical, and
the benefits conferred by each upon the ag
ricultural interests of the _ country. The
whole report is a complete history in total
of the workings of that department in all its
branches, showing the manner in which the
farmer, merchant and miner is informed,
and the extent to which he is aided in his
pursuits. The Commissioner makes one
recommendation that measures be taken by
Congress to protect and induce the planting
of forests, and suggests that no part of the
public lauds should be disposed of without
the condition that one tenth of it he reserv
ed in timber when it exists, and where it
does not exist, an inducement should be
offered by planting it.
CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION. 5
in accordance with the terms of the act of
Oongicoa approved Mar if, 1871, providing
for the celebration of the one hundredth an
niversary of American independence, a Com
mission has been organized consisting of
two members from each of the States and
Territories. The Commission has held two
sessions and has made satisfactory progress
in the organization and in the initiatory
steps necessary for carrying out the pro
visions of the act, and for executing the pro
visions also of the act of June 1, 1871, creat
ing a Centennial Board of Finance. A pre
liminary report of progress has been re
ceived from the President of the Commis
sion, and is herewith transmitted. It will
be the duty of the Commission, at your
coming session, to transmit a report of the
progress made and to lay before you the
details relating to the exhibition of Amer
ican and foreign arts, products, and manu
factures which, by the terms ol the act, is
to be held under the auspices of the govern
ment of the United States in the city of
Philadelphia in the year 187fi. This celebra

the crvrr. service.
An Tamest and airo has been folt to correct
abuses wt ieh have grown up in the civil ser
vice of the country through the defective
method of making appointments to office,
which have been regarded too much as the
reward of political services. Under author
ity of Congress rules have been established
to regulate the terms of office and mode
of apuointmerits. It cannot be expected
that any system or rule can be entirely effect
ive and prove a perfect remedy for the exist
ing evils till they have been thoroughly test
ed by actual practice, and amended ac
cording to the requirements of the service.
During my term of office it shall be my best
endeavor to so apply the rules as to secure
the greatest possible reform in the civil ser
vice of the Government, but it will require
the direct action of Congress to render the
enforcement of the system binding upon ray
successors, and I hope that the experience of
the past year, together with appropriate
legislation by Congress, may reach a satisfac
tory solution of this question, and secure
to the public service for all time a practical
method of obtaining faithful and efficient
officers and employes.
