President William H.Taft's
Message to Congress
IS A VERY TAME DOCUMENT. HE SIDE STEPS MANY
.VITAL OR IMPORTANT QUESTIONS.
WHICH ARE OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE.
IT WILL NOT COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH SIMILAR
STATE PAPERS.
WHICH HAVE BEEN PROMULGATED BY MANY OF HIS
PREDECESSORS.
On last Monday, both houses of con
gress convened for the short or the
holiday session and on the following
day President "William H. Taf fs mes
to congress was read and to say the
least, it is a very tame document and
he side eteps many vital or important
questions, which are of great interest
to the American people:
The president, in what might be
called his maiden message touches
upon the Canadian Boundary Treaty,
the international conference at Brus
sels, he praises Turkey's progress, the
improvements in Cuba. In speaking
of the unrest" in" Central America, the
president sets forth his views as fol
folwB: 31nce the "Washington conventions
of 1907," he says, "were communicated
to the government of the United
States as a consulting and advising
party, this government has been al
most continuously called upon by
one or another, and in turn by all
of the five Central American republics,
to exert itself for the maintenance of
the conventions. Nearly every com
plaint has been against the Zelaya
government of Nicaragua, which has
kept Central America in constant ten
sion or tunnon."
"I need not rehearse here the pa
tient efforts of this government to
promote peace and welfare among
these republics, efforts which are fully
appreciated by the majority of them
who are loyal to their true interests.
It would be no less unnecessary to
rehearse here the sad tale of unspeak
able barbarities and oppression alleged
to have been committed by the Zelaya
government.
"Recently two Americans were put
to death by order of President Zelaya
himself. They were officers in the
organized forces of a revolution which
had continued many weeks and was
in control of about half of the repub
lic, and as such, according to the
modern enlightened practice of clvill
zed nations, they were entitled to be
dealth with as prisoners of war.
. "At the date when this message Is
printed this government has termin
ated diplomatic relations with the Ze
laya government, for reasons made
public In a communication to the for
8HERIFF OAVIS OF ALEXANDER
COUNTY, ILLINOIS REMOVED

GRACE. It is gratifying to state, that Gover
nor Charles S. Deneen comes up with!
the right thing, when, he put one over
on Sheriff Davis of Alexander County,
UL, and removed Mm from office in
disgrace, for falling to bravely and
manfully protect the lives of the two
prisoners whom he permitted to be
mobbed and lynched a short time ago,
by the eminently respectable Christian;
ladles and gentlemen of Cairo.
The badge of shame fastened upon
Sheriff Davis, for yielding to.race pre

mer Nlcaraguan charge d'affaires, and
is intending to take such future steps
as may be found most consistent with
its dignity, its duty to American In
terests, and its moral obligations to
Central America and to civilization.
It may be necessary for me to bring
this subject to the attention of the
congress in a special message."
He successfully plows around the
great scandal In connection with buy
ing and constructing the Panama Ca
nal; he also dislikes to touch upon
the many glaring frauds which have
been committed by some of the cus
tom house officers at New York City,
for the benefit of the American Sugar
Refining Company, and others who
gave up some of their money to as
sist to elect him president of the
United States.
The president, like president like
President Roosevelt, is a etrong advo
cate of speedy Justice, which Is noth
ing more nor less than mob and lynch
law, and ht also favors curtail
ing the powers of the courts; he is
also in favor of compelling congress
men who are candidates for re-election
and their managers, to file a statement
with a proper officer of the United
States government as to the amount
of money they receive and expend In
their campaigns and where the money
comes from, but the president Is very
careful not to ask congress to pass a
law to punish by imprisonment all
the head captians of industry and the
bosses of the gigantic trusts and mon
opolies, who chucked hundreds of
thousands of dollars into his campaign
fund in 1908, and for some cause or
other the president Is silent on this
point.
The president favors a commission
of not more than seven persons to
consider the feasibility of an exposi
tion to show the progress of the Ne
gro since his emancipation.
The other subjects or questions
touched upon by the president are very
shallow not weighty by any means
and they will excite but little Interest
in the hearts of his countrymen.
On the whole his mesage does not
compare favorably with similar state
papers, which have been promulgated
by many of his Illustrious predeces
sors. shoot to kill, regardless of whom the
bullets hit and hill, in order to pre
serve law and order.

WILLIAM BRUNER PUT8 ONE.
OVER ON REV. ELIJAH J.
FISHER.
In the case of William Bruner
against the Rev. Elijah J. Fisher, in
the Apellate Court. Mr. Justice Smith
in rendering the opinion in the
above cause in the Appellate Court
recently found as follows: "After
a careful consideration of the evi
dence we think that the plaintiff in
error E. J. Fisher is justly indebted
to William Bruner in the sum of $108
the 'judgment j)f the lower court is
therefore reversed and the cause re
manded unless the defendant in error,
William Bruner shall remit in ten days
down to $io8jOO in which case a judgment
win be affirmed for this amount" It
seems that Mr. Bnmers attorneys con
cluded that they would be able to show
another jury that Mr. Fisher even
owed more than Judge Smith had
allowed and they permitted the case to
be reversed. '

Poor Consump
tives Cause
Vast Loss
LACK OF HOSPITAL BEDS COSTS
COUNTRY OVER A BILLION.
DOLLARS.
Sixteen states and territories of the
United States provide no place where
the poor consumptive can be treated,
except in jails and insane asylums.
This statement together with another,
to the effect that not one in thirty of
the victims of consumption who want
to get in hospitals can find a place
there, a fact which will mean a loss to
the country of $1,275,000,000 is made
by the National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis
in a bulletin issued today.
The National Association states that
there are in the United States at least
300JXO consumptives who are so poor
that they cannot pay for proper med
ical treatment in tuberculosis sanatoria
and hospitals. Some of them can Pay
jynall. amounts a week for their main
tenance, but the great majority of them
cannot pay anything. Foor this large
class of patients the entire country has
provided only 10,000 beds for the free
treatment of tuberculosis. In Alaba
ma, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Missis
sippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dako
ta, Oklahoma, Oregon, Phllipine Is
lands, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,
West Virginia and Wyoming there is
no place where the consumptive without
means can be treated but in jails or in
sane asylums and in most cases he
will get no treatment there. Sixteen
other states provide less than 50 beds
each for poor consumptives. In only
two states, Massachusetts and New
York have beds for needy tuberculosis
patients been provided, so that at least
one in ten may find a place for treat
ment. In many of the other states, not
one in 50 of the destitute consumptives
can find a bed in a hospital or sana
torium. It costs on an average about $250 to
cure an incipient consumptive or to
care for an advanced case until death.

If he is left in destitute circumstances
without proper attention, he will surely
infect with his disease at least two
other presons, and possibly many more.
Considering that the average life is
worth to society in dollars and cents,
about $1,500, the net loss which would
accrue to a community by not treating
its poor consumptves in proper institu
tions would be for each case, includ
ing those who are unnecessarily in
fected, at the very lowest figure, $450.
On this basis, if the poor consumptives
in the United States who are now sick
were segegated from their families,
and either kept in institutions until
they died, or else cured of their dis
ease, the saving to the country would
be the enourmous sum of $1,275,000,
qoa. Consumption is primarily a poor
man's disease. Dr. Woods Hutchinson,
of New York Gty says: '"Roughly
speaking, the incipient tuberculosis Pa
tient can buy as many chances of fresh
air and cure as he has money." The
percentage of deaths from consump
tion among the poor is 100 per cent
higher than among the well-to-do and
the rich. 65 per cent of the consump
tives in the United States are too poor
to provide proper means for treatment
They must either be placed in a sana
torium or a hospital where they will
be removed from the possibility of in
fecting other members of their fam
ilies, or the loss resulting from neg
lect to care for these poor consump
tives will be the case if they were
properly housed in institutions.
The 'National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis
declares that if every county or town
ship erect an institution for the treat
ment of indigent cases of consump
tion, this disease would be wiped out
in a few years.
