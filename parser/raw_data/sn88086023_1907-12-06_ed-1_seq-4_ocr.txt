Sing of the ties that bind him

THE COI.l'MMA RIVER.
It is not every river in the country
which enjoys the honor of being spec
ially mentioned In a president's mes
sage to congress.
Such, however. Is the unusual
honor which has come to the Colum
bia river, the great river highway of
the Pacific coast and such only came
to one other river, the Mississippi, In
President Roosevelt's message deliv
ered in congress Tuesday of this
ef k.
Tl'te mention of the Columbia river,
peclfically, as a river needing atten
tion from congress, is a recognition
long delayed, and It Is believed that
the presIJent opened the gateway
tor some excellent Columbia river
legislation by this thoughtful and
timely mention.
Dr. X. G. Elalock, that tireless and
splendid pioneer open river worker
ef Walla Walla, said yesterday In the
rivers and harbors congress at Wash
ington, that 1200 miles of the Colum
bia and Snake rivers and their con
fluents could be used for navigation
by 'toper congressional and state ac
tion. The greater part of three great
atates Oregon. Washington and
Idaho, are drained try these splendid
rivers, and yet navigation upon these
rivers Is limited to a few shallow
fcoats which are stranded upon the
projecting rocks In the upper river so
ften that traffic by this means Is well
Igh abandoned during low water.
'lth proper appropriations, with
wise and capable work these mighty
atfreams, now flowing Idly to the sea,
ould be filled with commerce, and
h is hoped that the words of the
president awaken congress to a sense
of responsibility In this matter.
Practically 1200 miles of magnifi
cent river highway unused excepting
for a small dstance out of Portland!
What a vision for the pioneers of
pen river transportation, to pic
ture those great rivers open from the
mouth to the fartherest limit!
The dream is being realized slowly.
Kv-ry year adds a new Impetus to the
work. Every year sees the rocks dis
appearing one by one from the chan
nel. Soon the fullness of the vision
will be enjoyed.
THE BUYING AMERICAN.
Paul De Longpre, the American
painter, in the current number of the
American Review of Reviews, bitter
ly criticises the United States for not
having Instituted a national school of
painting, sculpture, muHlc, drawing or
other of the leading arts.
The government has established
one of these. As a nation little has
been done to build up a national
chool of art. There have been frag
mentary and scattered efforts by In
dividuals and schools here and there,
but the great nation, the richest on
earth, has taken no interest, provid
ed little money and has given little
pabllc encouragement to these efforts.
In Europe every little insignificant
government has Its national schools
of art. Art of all kinds Is encourag
ed as a national asset, as an Incent
ive to good citizenship. But the
American insists on BUYING
EVERYTHING.
The American nation is the buying
nation; It buys paintings, buys music,
buys sculpture, buys books, buys ar
tistic sentiment, buys everything of
an aesthetic nature, Instead of found
lug and nurturing a national school
for the encouragement of these.
Making money, getting rich, piling
up millions to be destroyed and
forgotten and wasted Is the chief art
of the American.
We have art galleries, but they
contain principally European art; we
have conservatories of music but
Kuropean music and European meth
ods are taught almost exclusively.
The American air, the national sen
timent of the American Is lacking In
these institutions, simply, as Do
Longpre says, because the government
has established no national school to
teach a distinctively American art.
GETTING OFT OF DIFFICULTY.
The East Oregonlan has Just re
ceived one of the best Inspirations
which ever came to the office from a
little book published by Elizabeth
Towne, Holyoke;' Mass., entitled,
"Prosperity through Thought Force."
by Bruce McLellan. formerly n hard
working clerk, now an independent
farmer and progressive thinker.
.Like thousands of other young men
McLellan was chained to his occu
pation; he thought there was nothing
else in the world for him but drudg
ery in one narrow channel; he
thought that it was Just a matter of
wearing out his life some how and so
despaired of ever getting out of the
rut.
But finally an awakening came to
him. He made up his mind to get out
of his environment, to climb up to
'bigger and better positions and on to
absolute Independence and now at
less than 40, he has achieved his dear
est ambition and tells how in this
little book.
It Is simply the story of thought
force, determination, vigorous ambi
tion and honest desire for better
conditions. It proves that any man
can improve his condition If he
awakens and tries. Xo man Is bound
down by chains which cannot be
broken by thought force, by determ
ined purpose.
TOM JOHNSON'S YICTOIIY.
Tom Johnson may have a political
machine in Cleveland. He may be
a democratic boss. He may be an
actor In politics, but he gets results
for Cleveland.
The surrender of the Cleveland
Electric railway, the last of the
street car trust of that city, to the
mayor's three-cent corporation, is a
far reaching victory for Johnson's pa
tience, aggressiveness and honesty.
Johnson said five years ago that
the chief object of his political life
was to give the school children of
Cleveland's suburbs three-cent car
fares from their distant homes to
Cleveland's schools.
Then he set to work to accomplish
that result. One by one he whipped
the members of the street car trust
Into line. At first It was slow work,
but the people stood by him and
elected h'lm over and over to the of
fice of mayor and he kept on fighting
the trust.
Yesterday when the last five-cent
company surrendered end Johnson
put the last five-cent street car tick
et out of existence In Cleveland, the
faith of the people In Tom Johnson
was vindicated a thousand times.
GOING "DRY.
Did you ever hear the like? Towns
everywhere going "dry," prohibition
creeping slowly over the land, sweep
ing away prejudice, tearing down old
political barriers, abolishing century
old organizations and establishing a
new order in the land!
Ten years ago you scarce . dared
mention prohibition above a whisper
for fear of being put out of business
and ostracised from "society." To
day every thoughtful man is discuss
ing it, taking note of its vital pro
gress and declaring openly that it is
coming.
Thoughtful saloon men who have
large sums invested in saloons are
earnestly considering the question of
Belling out, of getting out of the path
of the rising tide.
Just as the emancipation proclama
tion destroyed millions of dollars
worth of southern property when It
freed the negroes, so will the pro-
I
hlbltlon vote of the country wipe out
the existence of millions of dollars of
"values" comprised In liquor enter
prises. Eternal Justice takes note of obsta
cles. It knows no barrier.
If some of the new councllmen of
Pendleton are particularly anxious to
cover themselves with glory by solv
ing a knotty problem, let them tackle
the bridge over the gulch on West
High street, the old cemetery on the
north Bide or the removal of the
stockyards from the residence dis
tricts. These are peculiar tests which
are kept standing for the purpose of
trying out the executive ability of new
city administrations. They lire like
the silver dollars which havo been
kept In families for years for all tho
children to cut their teeth upon.
WHATEVER IS IS REST.
I know as my life grows older,
And mine eyes have clearer sight
That under each rank wrong, some
where,
There lies the root of right;
That each sorrow has Its purpose,
By the sorrowing oft unguessed,
But as sure as the nun brings morn.
Ing,
Whatever Is !s best.
I know that each sinful action.
As sure us the night brings shade.
Is somewhere, sometime punished,
Tho' the hour be long delaved.
I know that the soul Is aided
Sometimes by the heart's unrest,
And to grow means often to suffer-
But whatever Is It best.
I know there are no errors,
In the great eternal plun,
nd all thinks work together
For the final good of man.
And I know when my soul speeds on
ward.
In its grand eternal quest,
I shall say as I look back earthward.
Whatever is Is best.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
NO SHADE FOR ARAR'S EYES.
"I shall winter in the Sahara,"
said a traveling man. "With u, cara
van I' shall traverse, under a blinding
sun, an endless plain of snow white
sand, but none of my Mohammedan
attendants will wear any k'nd of a
shade over his eyes.
"Against that dazzling glare the
backs of their necks will be swathed
in white linen, and even their ears
will be protected. Nothing, though,
will keep the sun out of their faces.
"Wondering about this. I said one
day to the caid of an Alger'an vil
lage: "'Why don't you Arabs wear a
cap of some sort? You live In the
world's worst sun glare, but neither
fez nor turban under any circumstan
ces has a peak.'
" 'The Koran,' the cald answered,
forbids nil true believers to shade
their eyes. Obeying the Koran Im
plicitly we dwellers In the desert
ivo'd like poison brims to our head
gear. In consequence there Is more
bl'ndness among our people than any
other people In the world.' " Phila
delphia Bulletin.
HAD A REASON TO GET ROT.
A Washington correspondent ivho
used to run a newspaper in Iowa,
tells how the heavy advertiser of the
town once entered the editor'al off I
ces and, with anger ami disgust de
picted In every line of his face, ex
claimed: "That's a fine break you people
have made In my ad this week!"
"What's the trouble!" asked the
editor, in a tone calculated to molll
fy the Indignant one.
"Read it and see!" commanded the
advti wiot:. t'.nust tig a copy of the
paper In the editor's face.
The latter read: "If you want to
have a fit. wear Blank's shoes:"
Harper's Weekly.
REIT COW ON THE ROOF.
Of all the gratified whims of the
rich, says the December Delineator,
none are more unique and amusing
than that of the little son of W. E
Stokes, who weary of everything else
conceived a longing for a real cow,
As his every wish is law, one was ob
tained. Carefully muzzled. It was
hoisted, via the freight elevator, to
the top of the Broadway apartment
house, the whole roof of which Is
devoted to his play ground. Thtj
small boy was delighted. His pleas
ure was short lived, however, for
the health department of New York
cltv ordered the cow taken down.
NOT-A CHEERFUL BRAND.
"Haven't you any milk that Is
more cheerful than this?" queried the
new boarder as he poured some of
the liquid into his coffee.
"Why, what do you mean by
that?" queried the landlady.
"Oh, nothing," replied the n. b.,
"only this milk seems to have the
blues."

A SAFE MID RELIABLE BLOOD PURIFIES
In the time of our forefathers the forests and fields were the only labor
atories from which they could procure their medicines. They searched out
and compounded the different roots, herbs and barks into remedies, many of
which have been handed down to succeeding generations, and continuously
used with satisfactory results. Atr.onjj the very best of these old time prep
arations is S. S. S., a medicine made entirely from roots, herbs and barks,
in such combination as to make it the greatest of all blood purifiers. This
absolute vegetable purity of S. S. S. makes it the one medicine that may be
used without fear of harmful results in any way. Most blood medicines on
the market contain mercury, potash, or some other strong mineral. These
act with bad effect on the system, upsetting the stomach, interfering with
the digestion, affecting the bowels, and when used for a prolonged period of
time often cause salivation. No such effects ever result from the use of
S. S. S., and it may be taken by children as safely as by older people. For
Rheumatism, Catarrh, Sores aud Ulcers, Malaria, Sctofula, Skin Diseases,
and all other troubles caused by impure or poisoned blood, S. S. S. is a per
fect remedy. It goes down into the circulation and removes all poisons,
impurities, humors or unhealthy matter, and makes the blood pure and rich.
It eliminates every particle of the taint of inherited blood trouble, purines and
strengthens the weak, deteriorated blood, and establishes the foundation
for good health. S. S. S. is Nature's Blood Purifier, and its many years of
successful service, with a steadily increasing demand for it, is the best evi
dence of its value in all blood troubles. Book on the blood and any medical
advice tree of charge. THE SWIFT SPECIFIC CO., ATLANTA, GA.

because the Northern Pacific rail
road company consumes $220 worth
of pins every month, a communica
tion has been sent out of the general
manager's office asking that the many
branch offices throughout the coun
try exercise ns much care as possible
In using the pins, and Incidentally
requesting -that none of them be ap
propriated to personal use.
In connection with the communi
cation there was also Information
given that the consumption of seal
ing wax and rubber bands was moro
than it should be, and the many em
ployes were also cautioned about
using the two latter necessities of a
railroad office In a too freehanded
manner.
The pins for the Northern Pacific
company are put up in one-fourth-
pound boxes by Henry E. Wedel-
staedt company of St. Paul, Minn.
The pins are bought by tho pound
and It Is estimated that the cost is
from 50 to 75 cents a pound. Should
