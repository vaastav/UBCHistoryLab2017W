of the graham, corn and rye flours,
and it was thought that If people
Knew mat the large Maui stores would

large quant'ty it would be possible to
get more sales for the same and a
consequent saving of the white flour
would be effected.
The use of home grown beans, corn

and private gardens would in the near
future be a great help In the matter
o! saving on vegetable.
The possibility of using posters In
the public schools and slides In the
motion picture houses was brought up
and it was voted to ask It. A. Wads
worth, president of the Maui. Cham
ber of Commerce, to endeavor to se
cure four-minute speakers at the pic-
lure houses. The idea is that these
short speeches would be made be
tween the reels. Several men pres
ent at the meeting seemed to be will
ing to ass'nt in this way.
It was decided that Japanese and
English would be the languages used
for all publicity work on the island
of Maui.
It was made very clear that the
whole question of consorvat'on. was
not the question of being able to act
ually save money in using certain
foods in preference to other foods
but 11 was a question of using those
foods which we could without en
croaching upon those that were need
ed for exportation to the Allies.

etc. .
It had been the intention of
Maul Bank, Ltd., to tender for
postoffice. They had In mind
erection of a new home
themselves on the lot at the corner
of Main and Church streets, remod
elling and turning over the present
prem'ses of the bank to the govern

you declare the United States m a state of war with Austna-1 lung;.ty.
that country known to be only a vassal of the German government.
We must face facts existing and act without sentiment in this stern
business. Austria, too, is not acting on her own initiative or in response
to the wishes of her own people, but are instruments in the hands of
.mother nation. We must meet it's force with ours, and regard the
Centra! Powers as one in the war. W ill be unsuccessful otherwise.
The same logic leads to war with liulgaria and Turkey. They are mere
tools, although they do not stand in direct pathway necessary to our
action"
Referring to general legislation the President advocated laws more
drastic to punish spies and traitors; laws to restrict further war profit
eers; to go further in limiting prices. Laws of supply and demand are
now but laws of unrestrained selfishnes, profiteering being still impudent
ly rampant in some industries. If greater legislation is necessary to co
ordinate railroads, will ask for it later. Present session should bend its
whole energy to the task of winning the war. Can act with grealcr
energy because the war is of high principle, undebased by ambition of
conquest or spoliation. 't and the world know we were forced in to
save our institutions from corruption and destruction. Purpose of the
Central Powers strikes directly at the heart of everything we believe in.
Their method of warfare outrages every principle of humanity and
knightly honor; their intrigue has corrupted the thought and spirit of
many of our own people. Their sinister secret diplomacy s .tight lo
take our territories, disrupt our union, and our safety would have been
ended, our honor would have been forever sullied if we had permitted
their victory. Our cause being just and holy, our settlement must be
likewise. We will battle till the last gun is fired and that supreme
moment when the right spirit lias come, the eyes of the German people
been opened and they see the hand of God laid upon their nation, lie
will show them favor, I devoutly believe; but only if they rise clear to
ihe heights of His own justice and glory."
SCENES IN CONGRESS
Washington Senator Martin and Representative Flood announc
ed in the resjective houses that a resolution favoring war on Austria,
Turkey and liulgaria would be ready for presentation on Friday.
There were wild demonstrations in Congress when the President
recommended including Austria, Turkey and liulgaria with Germany in
the war. Everyone applauded when the President entered the door,
except blind Senator Gore and La Follette, and the applause continued
long after he had left the chamber.
Nation-wide prohibition and women suffrage will be voted on by the
House judiciary committee on Tuesday.
