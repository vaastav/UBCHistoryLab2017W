New Toee, Doc 9. The Tribune says
Judge Pierpont don't hesitate to distinctly
affirm that in case of the expected re
lease of Spanish gunboats from the original
Peruvian libel, he does not intend to
entertain the application of the Cuban
authorities for a new seizure of tho vessels
alleged to be designed for tho commission
of hostilities against the government,
colony and pooplo of the Island of Cuba,

Ho dooms it highly improbable that tho
national authorities, as affairs now stand.

of administration will be finally de
termined.

A Few More Sca.rcb.iuir Interroga
tories to the Legislature, and espe
cially Itv "lavcstiffatlug: Commit
tees." To tho Editors of laa Union and American:
When I received yonr paper of Satur
day morning last, I was surprised and
abashed to find that my well-meant inter
rogatories, which you were kind enough
to print in the Union and American
thfr day before, had not only received the
attention of tho Legislature, but, also,
unaccountably to me, involved the free
dom of the press. I have never before
heard of a man being called to account
by any sane person for asking a civil
question such as, the way to a certain
point, or, how do you do? The indi
vidual who propounded this new feature,
social and legislative, I am informed, is
the senior Representative from your own
county, and to you and to the Banner,
(who seems to have a just appre
ciation of his genius,) and to his
other constituents I Ieava him,
The issue now is, What do wcl the
people, justly owe? and how can
it be promptly paid? To answer this
question, which involves our honor as
well as our pockets, it was necessary tha)
the Legislature Bhould ascertain certain
facts. That honorable body seems to
havo realized thi3 necessity, when they
appointed committees of investigation.
When theso committees ware appointed,
the people hoped that the depths of their
situation would be fathomed, and they
would be informed uy the prompt reports
of theso several committees ihe true con
dition of public affairs. We have waited
patiently, but no answering voice relieves
sharp expectancy with its grateful or un
grateful sound. Perhaps if the people
bad access to the reports of the Comp
troller and Treasurer, they could get a
glimpse of the wilderness of debt in
which they are in danger of being lost.
There i3 an all-pervading impression
that the four years of Radical rule in our
State have been a continued courso of
plunder as well as of popular proscriptisn
and injustice. Previous Legislatures since
the warhave not commanded the confidence
nor inspired the respect of the people.
Our taxes havo beon increased to an ex
tent not less onerous than marvelous. Yet
we arc having the burden of debt daily
augmenting its weight upon us, and the
change of Representatives seems not to
promise relief. For the two years ending
with the COth of last September, the peo
ple paid into the Treasury nearly six mil
lions of dollars. This was paid out, and
left still outstanding unpaid warrants upon
the Treasury for nearly $300,000 more
with a large balance of accruing interest
unpaid. For these two years the current
expenses of the State were two and a half
millions of dollars. Yet a large propor
tion of the July interest remains unpaid ;
that for January, now upon us, is not
likely to be paid ; and when an investiga
tion is demanded, the appeal of the tax
payer is treated with contempt, and the
people arc virtually told it is none of their
business they are to pa- the taxes, and
it is the prerogative of the General Assem
bly to state the amount required !
That money has been openly stolen
from the public treasury under Radical
misrule, there is not the shadow of a
doubt The school fund is a notable, but
by ao means a solitary example. The
honest people of Tennessee want to know
wno stole it, and they want the felons
brought to just punishment.
That there has been flagrant misappro
priations of State bonds issued in aid of
railroads, admits of no denial. Thcro
have been peculations and frauds mild
names for theft upon the State in the re
ception and application of its means to
building these highways of commerce.
I make no charge specific, for the reason
that I am ignorant as to who has thus
swindled the Stale. But in-eupport of the
general charge I adduce tho fact that but
ouc road in the State has been completed
by means of the State's Rid. The incom
plete roads receiving aid, arc, so far as the
public know, in worse condition than
when the aid was voted and the bonds
issued. The questions that the people want
answemd arc : What roads havo received
aid ? To what extent ? How many miles
have been built with the people's money ?
How much more, at the same rate, will lie
required ? If any of it has been misappro
priated or embezzled, who that is to say,
what particular persons, by name have
perpetrated the act? Is such robbery
felony and punishablo by the usual penal
ties for such crimes? If not, why? And
is it within the range of human possibili
ties that the agents of the people can pro
tect them against perpetual robbery, night
and day? If government, so-called,
utterly fails of its purpose if it fails to
protect its citizens (in this country, its
subjects) what is their remedy ? Is rob
bery that, in magnitude and frequency of
repetition, would astound the wonderfully
fruitful imagination of the author of the
"Forty Thieves," and make him ashamed
of tho poverty of his fiction to be
legalized in Tennessee, and made
perpetual? Who else than the public
Representatives are to come between
the people and the spoilers? Is the
fable to bo realized that it is more com
fortable to tolerate a surfeited swarm of
flics, than to brush them away and receive
a larger and a hungrier swarm ? Why
the necessity of a change of Representa
tives? If we are not to be benefitted,
why not adopt the theory that "whatever
is, is right," and expire in the faith ? Wo
should certainly appear belter in tho eyes
of our children as martyrs to error, than
as hypocritical friends to truth, and as
skulking cowards in the face of its de
mands. If wo are to toil through lifo to fill
the purses of those "who labor not, neither
toil nor spin," but who aro "clothed in
fine linen and fare sumptuously every
day," in God's name, tell us so, and as
sign us our places; and "when you say, Go,
we will go, aud when you say, Come, we
will come."' But do not tell us that wc
arc a free people that you arc our agents
or servants that this is a republic that
wc live in an age of even partial enlighten
ment, when you adopt wrong by conceal
ing its outrages and endorso villainy by
refusinc: to challenge it, when it stalks, in
mid-day with its glittering trappings of
guilt, in the face of the world.
If the theft of public money is not now
a crime, it is competent for the Legisla
ture to make it one and the people
whose money is stolen would not object
that the penalty should be the extreme
one of death. Our case is becoming des
perate, and without prompt remedies it
will soon be hopeless. Our lwnds are
hawked in the markets at less than one
half their value. In all probability they
will go to a quarter. Yet the people will
be required to pay a dollar for that which
they only received a quarter. For repu
diation, be it remembered, is a thought
that has not yet received form and body
and strength among the people, io
avoid that contincency can only 15
achieved by satisfying tho people that
thev arc onlv required to pay .just debts,
and for value received. But I fear that
I trespass on your space, which I know to
be valuable.
Far be it from me to become an in
structor to tho General Assembly, or to
seek to be. My capacity is humble, and
I should decline such a service, if, for no
other reason, for the all-sufficient one
that a Legislature elected as this one was,
that could not sec its duty in the matters
that I have referred to, would be incap
able of instruction and should 1m; tolcr
ated only as a monumental sign lo those
to come after, that tho road it trod is the
road to perdition. I do not believe this
of the present Legislature. I believe its
nurpose is to do right. I believe the
people of Tennessee have the same esti
mate of it ; but the convictionjs general
that it should enter tipon-itub "work of
xpcctMons,' without
responding to these expecti
further delny.

The City Council met last night in re'ru-

and a half o'clock, President Herriford
being in tho chair. At roll-call a quorum
answered to their names and business was
proceeded with. The minutes of tho
previous meeting were road and approved.
Tho following messago from tho Mayor
was read and received :
Ma yob's OrncE, Dec. 9. 13C0. To the
Honorable Citv Council of Nashville: I feel
it my duty again to call your attention,
bnefiy, to the financial condition of the
city.
The amount ot revenue collected lrom
all sources for tho corporation, since the
appointment of the Kecoiver, is $ 190, 727. CM.
Tho disbursements havo been $187,305.00,
which, after deducting commissions of tho
present revenue collector ($132.02.), leaves
a balance on hand of $9,229.92. Of this
balance, several thousand dollars must be
paid out within tho present month, to meet
positive cnpranemontR. ine collections
during the current mouth must be very
small ; so that we cannot reasonably expect
to havo on hand, at tho close of tho month,
a sum sufficient to pay off the employes,
tho school department, and the current
monthly expenses. Tho reports of the
Treasurer and the Finance Committee will
give you tho details of receipts and ex
penditures, which need not be repeated
hero.
The Chief of the Fire Dopartment, act
ing in concert with the Committeo
of that Department, has made changes
which will work a considerable reduction
of expense ; yet I cannot refrain from sec
onding tho praiseworthy effort of those
gentlemen, by recommending that two of
the steam 1-iro .bngincs bo retired lrom tho
regular service, and kept in their respect
ive houses in such a stato of readiness
that, under the prompt management of our
ablo Chief of the Department, they may be
brought into temporary uso with little de
lay on occasions of extraordinary danger.
This will reduce the Fire expenses nearly
one-half.
Heavy reductions will bo made in tho
Street Department ; and I recommend the
passage of tho bill reducing tho number of
the police. Both these departments are
under faithful management, and it is pain
fui to urge their reduction. Tho police is
composed of competent, efficient men. and
their number is not greater than would be
proper under any but circumstances of
financial distress. Doubtless, the Com
missioners you aro about to elect will find
it difficult to select those with whom they
will part, when all are so well discharging
their duties.
But after these reductions the current
expenses of tho city government por month
will not bo much loss than $20,000. Of
course, 1 do not allude, hi this estimate,
to interest accruing on the debts of tho cor
poration ; but merely to tho running ex
penses of tho various departments.
From this timopntil the first of July next
it is estimated that the collections of rev
enue from all sources cannot exceed
$85,000, exclusive of any amount which
may bo realized from tho collection of
taxes to bo levied for the year 1870, (which
are not generally available beforo that
time,) and including the water-tax of tho
next semi-annual term. The expenses, at
tho rate of $20,000 per month, will amount
from the 1st of Decomber to tho 1st of
July, to $1 10,000 ; and we have engagod to
pay about $10,000 on judgments on old
bonds and interest, in March. Other lia
bilities will havo lo bo met, amounting,
perhaps, to $10,000 more. This will show
a deficiency of $70,000, making apparent
the urgent necessity of Tedncing onr enr
rent expenses one-halt
It is trno that under tho present
law, if onr usual assessment bo com
pleted in time, wo may begin to collect
taxes for tho year 1870 boforo tho 1st of
July; but, on the other hand, there are
judgraonts against the city, in tho United
States Circuit Court, obtained at tho last
May term and previously, on which execu
tions will presently issue, for moro than
fifty thousand dollars. These judgments
have not been enjoined, and a portion of
them cannot be ; it is not certain that any
of them can be. Suits aro also ponding in
that court for large amounts, which stand
for trial at an adjourned term to bo held in
February next ; and if judgment go against
us in theso, execution will issue soon after
on a portion of them which are for amounts
under $2,000, and on the others unless ap
peals be taken and socurity given.
I recommend, thereforo, that we bhould
not depend, to any extent, on the
revenues to arise from the property-tax
of the ensuing year, in making pro
vision for tho current expenses of the next
seven months. But on this point I will
here take occasion to remark, that tho law
fixing the time for the election of Tax As
sessor should bo at onco amended so as to
bring on the election of that officer at the
last regular meeting in December; so that
he may make his arrangements to begin
the work of assossment promptly on the
10th day of Jannary, 1S70. AVo shall need
the property tax to meet tho liabilities
mentioned above, other than enrrent ex
penses, at tho earliest day it can possibly
be collected. And as, under tho present
law, the collection may be hastened by an
early assessment, it is important the assess
ment bo made with all possible dispatch.
As to tho current expenses, I feel bound
to recommend further reduction. It
is feared we shall be compelled
to Buspend the public schools for
a time. This I should regret exceedingly.
Only one other possibility could be moro
painful to contemplate, and this is the fu
tile attempt to carry them on without be
ing ablo to pay those employed in tho work
of public instruction. Whether it were
better to suspend them honestly for a sea
son, tnat we may gather strength to renew
them on a solid basis, or to let them lan-
mush and dio in an attempt to live without
sustenance, is for you in your wisdom to
determine I am willing to join in any
effort which may promise success to sus
tain them; but without unduly oppressing
the tax-payers of the city, I must confess
there is no means apparent if wo should
resort to a loan something scarcely to be
thought of under present circumstances
one could only be obtained for a short tune,
and at ruinous rates of interest
To suspend the pnbjip schools
would suit leave us with & cur
rent expense of nearly $15,000 per
month, and there will still be necessity
lor turtner redaction ol expenditures. Uy
the exercise of the strictest scrutiny, wo
maybeabla to devise other ways and
means of saving tho pnblio money.'
Among other expedients I suggest the pos
sibility of dispensing with one-half the,
gas-burners in the city. In this matter, as:
in that of the schools, it may be better for
a while to content ourselves with a little
light, than to bo compelled by-and-by' to
grope in utter darkness, and La tha help- i
lessnesa of irretrievable bankruptcy. Afur
a long career of extravagant expenditures
it will require Jlns determination and rigid
discipline to. accustom onr own minds even
to the close economy which the present
emergency requires r but we should show!
to the people and oar creditors that we-are ,
determined to redeem the finances of the
city from tho ruin threatened by the reck- i
less policy of our predecessors. '

Balls owe their origin to France. The
first great one mentioned in history was
that given in honor of the marriage of
Charles VI. to Isabella, of Bavaria, at
Amiens, in 1385. Catherine de Medici
gave the first bal masque, and Ueary
VI. of England liked the fashion so well
that he transferred the novelty to his
realm.
Tire Paris Figaro says of a comedian
that "he has but two happy moments in
his life that in which he draws his pay,
and that in which a rival is hissed."
