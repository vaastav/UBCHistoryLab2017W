THE EVENING STAR.
WASHINGTON.
TUESDAY .......... December 3, 1901.
CROSBY S. NOYES ............ Editor.
THE EVENING STAR has a regular
and permament Famfly Ciselation
much m1ore than the combined e1-.
culation of the other Waehlugton
daillies. As a News nd Advertising
Medium it has no competitor.
gri order to avoid. delays on ae
eount of personal absenee, letters to
THE STAR should not he addressed
to any Individual connected with the
O0ee. but simply to THE STAR, or to
the Editorial or Business Depart
meats., according to temor or purpose.
The Mensage.
The fear expressed that the President's
message would be' too long was idle. It is
safe to say that no man will count the
words, but that every one who takes it up
till read it through with relish. From the
first paragraph, with its tender tribute to
the mem iry of Mr. McKinley, to the last,
with its earnest expression of appreciation
of the foreign sympathy offered to the na
tin in its hour of sorrow, the paper is one
of individuality and of interest. It leaves
no important question untouched, and it
discourses of none in any obscure or halt
ing fashion. The man of opinions gives his
opinions in clear and concise style.- and so
as to impress upon the reader the belief in
the author's absolute sincerity. A trained
writer and thinker holds the pen, and he
holds it very firmly. Congress, at any
rate, cannot complain. because the constitu
tional requirement that the President shall
from time to time make suggestions to that
body with relation to the state of public
business and the public welfare was never
more completely complied with. Here are
suggestions enough to last the session. And
all of them are good. Lucky will the coun
try b if even the half of them are fol
lowed.
The President's arrangement of his topics
puts the question of the anarchists first,
There Is no more important question, and
Congress should deal with it in some effec
tive form. Nor will it suffice simply to
suppress the fiends who are now harboring
in this country and openly boasting of their
views and publicly rejoicing when some
ruler is assassinated by one of their num
ber. Our immigration laws are, and for
some years have been, sadly in need of
overhauling, with the view of keeping out
of the I'nited States people without the
ability or the desire to take up and dis
charge the burdens of good citizenship.
And, appropriately enough, the President
clises the paragraph with an appeal for
the renewal of the Chinese exclusion act.
The paragraph with regard to the tariff
and reciprocity, while strictly in line with
Mr. McKinley's Buffalo speech. cannot be
set down as the offspring of that. It will
be recalled that Mr. Roosevelt, then the
Vice President. spoke at Minneapolis sever
al days before Mr. McKinley did at Buffalo.
and in much the same strain as to our in
dustries and foreign markets. The two
men. without a conference. were thinking
along the same lines and to the same ends.
Both were protectionists. Both stood to
their protection guns. But both urged a
logical application of the policy to the new
times and conditions. Mr. Roosevelt, in
biblicai phrase. calls reciprocity "the hand
maidn of protection"-a very just and
happy characterization. And it will not be
overlooked that Mr. Roosevelt agrees with
his predecessor in the opinion that there
are some of our Industries which no longer
need protection, and that it would be wise
and right to shift the favors now bestowea
upon them to more deserving objects. or use
them in making terms of trade with other
mations. And for the reciprocity treaties
now before the Senate he asks considera
tio.-n.
The President speaks for peace, but of
c-urse upon the only line which Insures
peace. We must get, and stay, good and
ready for war. The navy must take rank
with the best. We must have ships of the
most approved pattern. and men enough,
and to spare, thoroughly drilled for fight
ing them. We won against Spain because
we were ready on the sea: and we must be
prepared there at all times and against all
lpssible comers. The army, too, should be
kept smart and fit. Whatever is necessary
to the maintenance of a system working
for the production of capable offiers and
hardy men should be wllingly and abun
dant'y supplied.
Surely the west will like this message.
Her wants are remembered in the warm
est terms. No other President has ever
sp.'ken at such length or so explicitly on the
subject o)f irrigation. It is probably true,
to,. that nto other President evet had so
wide an acquaintance with the subject as
Mr. Rtoosevelt possesses. He is, as it were.
an adopted child of the west, and knows
her wants and sympathizes with them. In
the far east, in early times, the man who
digged a well was listed as a public bene
faotor. His name was recorded with honor.
And it is safe to say that if Mr. Roosevelt
can induce Congress to lay the foundation
for reservoirs which will husband for the
great empire beyond the Mississippi the
water necessary to add the desert reaches
there to habitation anu productivity he need
lose no sleep about the enduring quality of
his fame.
The main argument which some Ameri
cans advance against the re-enactment of
the ('hinese exclusion law is that it does
not exclude. If this be true, Minister Wu
Ting Fang and Consul General Yo How
hav thughtlessiy permitted themselves to
be. m- ,xited. Those gentlemen who de
chire that the exclusion law is a nullity, are
wrong. The fact that the law Is violated
d.>-s no.t prove their case. The Ten Comn
maindmenits are violated, but the Christian
world wil not repeal them because of this
fact.
The. faat that few Congresses succeed in
beig as gil as sonme of the messages they
get fortuintly does not exercise any influ
erce on the men whose duty it becomes to
1-reisare the documentM
President Castro proceeds on the theory

Thse P'resident on Distriet Nieeds.
The President's references to the District
of Culumbia, In the course of his message,
are few but pointed. He recommends the
enactment of a. local factory law, the en
lirgement o-f the habited alleys into minor
streets and the extension of the civil ser
vice law to the District government. It is
natural that he should wish to see the fed
eral capital given the benefit of the best
possible laws. He pleads in his message
in general for a closer study of the welfare
of the wage-workers, as contributing to the
solution of many of the social problems
which now await remedial attention.
Among the needs of this clams is more
careful legislation to prevent injustice and
barsh treatment and to permit the working
class to better Itself mentally and physi-.
eally. The District has no specific factory
Jaws, and despite the general excellence of
industrial conditions here tber, is room
for Improvement, especially in the light of
the contempiated increase In the manufac
tigring Interests of the District. A well
eesid~ered fatory law enacted now will
perhaps prevent the growh of serious corn
ditionm later. when adationl industries
have been estahinaha here and give em
ptorysent to large numbers et people.
Along the -am line of seini bettment
is the Prestent's 1 n=madte tat the
shm as 'the ct. comnetssi witin the
thickly populated alleys, be converted Into
mdnor streets and given the benedt of the
pabIlic improvements pertaining to -much
thoroughfsres. Mdi has already been
done in Washington toward the regenea
tion of the alleys. Model tenements have
been built through the enterprise of public
spirited citinens, and have shown the way
to the solution of some of the sanitary and
moral problems which beset the worker
among. the poorer classes. But much more
remains to be done. in the direction of the
President's suggestion, and an enactment
on this subject will materially faolitate
the transformation of the slums of the cap
ital into places of reasonably .wholesome
residence.
The recommendation as to the civil ser
vice law is the most important of all those
affecting the District. It is the first time
a President has thus specifically urged
that the local government be given the
benefit of the system which maintains the
merit pr4nolple In the general departmental
service. Commissioners of the District have
uniformly urged this measure of good gov
ernment for a number of years, pointing
to the success scored by the merit system
In the federal departments, and empha
sizing the non-partisan nature of the'local
administration. Failing to secure such an
extension of the law they have in a oertain
measure set up a civil service system of
their own, which works fairly well, con
sidering the handicap of political pressure
to which they are continually subject. The
direct Inclusion of the District govern
ment within the scope of the civil service
commission, by either specific act or by
presidential order, authorized by statute,
will greatly relieve the Commissioners from
embarrassmert in the selection of their
subordinates and facilitate the transaction
of the municipal business.
The Commissioners' Report.
The District Commissioners' annual re
port places the needs of the capital before
Congress In such a manner that the case
may be broadly considered in the light of
the actual necessities as well as in view
of Secretary Gage's formal reminder that
the District is in debt to the federal gov
ernment and his perfunctory recommenda
tion that the appropriations be cut below
the estimates. The Secretary in thus call
ing the attention of Congress to the need
of further legislation to meet the existing
and prospective conditions states the case
from the point of view of bare statistics.
The Commisioners' report shows on the
other hand that the sums named in the
estimates are necessary for the mainte
nance of the federal capital upon an appro
priate plane of municipal efficiency. It has
been brought to its present level as a model
city largely through wise expenditures in
the past. Despite the rapidity with which
the annual appropriations have of late been
Increased there yet remain many important
projects reqdiring attention, and the Dis
trict stands ready to assume Its rightful
share of the cost if Congress will but so
order.
More schools, more sewers, more police
men, more firemen, more Inspectors for the
preservation of the public health, more
public servants in almost every depart
ment to ensure reliable results in adminis
tration-these necessities are clearly dem
onstrated by the Commissioners. Their re
port of the year's progress evidences the
requirements of the year to come. They
point to a community well governed, with
great care taken to ensure health and pros
perity, safety and comfort. They disclose
high standards of efficiency maintained In
the municipal service. They express the
reasonable hope that Congress will not now
take a retrograde step.
The sole reason alleged for curtailing the
budget is that the District owes noney to
the federal government, and that its reve
nues are mortgaged to pay such heavy ex
penditures wholly out of Its own resources
that it is impossible to meet the estimates.
The District Is not responsible for this con
dition, and it should not be made to suffer
because of It, as The Star suggested
yesterday. The Commissioners' report is
wisely couched in a spirit of confidence that
the justice of this proposition will be recog
nized by the houses.
The Commissioners urge the construction
of the Memorial bridge and of a national me
morial to the late President In this city, the
improvement of the Anacostia river, the
construction of a worthy official home for
the District government, the proper main
tenance of the Public Library In view of
its approaching occupancy of the new
building provided by Mr. Carnegie, the es
tablishment of a high pressure water ser
vice for fire fighting, the enactment of addi
tional laws to regulate the sale of milk,
and various other changes in the laws to
permit a greater degree of eficiency in the
public service.
This report bespeaks with confidence a
ccntinuation of congressional consideration
for and interest in the development of an
Ideal municipality, such as Washington is
rapidly becoming.
Although this is the long session of Con
gress no attempt will be made to deliver
all those speeches which would appear to
have been delivered. The leave to print
will do business at the old stand and the
Record will continue to be the refuge of
gentlemen with weak lungs, shy nerves,
sore throats and hoapseness. If the rule of
"leave to print" could be so enforced as to
strike a balance between the silent and the
clamorous orators the effect would be
pleasing. But the silent speaker will per
sist in committing pious frauds upon his
constituents and the vociferous gentleman
will continue his efforts to produce rain
with vocal bombs.
The Boers are pegging away with a per
sistency which would indicate that they are
not allowing themselves to depend very far
on the expressions of sympathy once so nu
merous in this country.
No man worthy of the office would refuse
the presidency because of the physical
danger that might be attached to It. But
this fact Is no excuse for a laxity in sup
pressing anarchism.
There Is some disposition to throw diffi
culties in the way of the picturesque, Cin

The decision of the Suapreme Court as to
the status of the Philippines clears the way
for action by Congress along the line of
the President's recommenatioa to legis
late for the Philippines. The mes=sage be
speaks consideration for the welfare of the
Wsand. through the developinent' of their
resources. The court's decision points toE
the need orat least the wisdom of specific
legislation preiing for the cellecsa a

yet it is the short cut to absolute cer
tainty to follow the example set in the case
of Porto Rico. Then there would be no
room for the litigious exporter or importer
t3 stand before the court and embarrass the
Insular administration.
The President's recommendations as to
the islands relate specifically to the enact
ment of laws for the development of their
resources, through the grant of franchises
for a term of years. He is careful thus to
restrict the proposition. He evidently fore
sees the dangers in the wide opening of the
doors to exploiting corporations. He wants
the Islands developed for the sake, pri
marily, of the inhabitants. Yet the In
vestor will not go there without an Induce
ment and Congress should at this session
provide a reasonable course of legislation
which will encourage investments in the
Islands for the sake of the upbuilding of
industries there and the consequent pros
perity of the natives. It is to be assumed
that as far as possible Congress will take
care of the American interests in the fram
ing of the necessary statutes.

We have just opened up
and placed on sale our stock
of holiday footwear, embrac
ing slippers for gentlemen,
boudoir slippers for women
-el carriage footwear
for women.
It is the largest variety ever
shown by this or -any shoe
store in town, and includes
every novelty on which has
been stamped the seal of ap
proval of the most particular
dressers.
The name of "Rich's"
stamped on a shoe, and
meaning as it does, every
thing that is worthful and
fashionable i footwear, is an
assurance of appreciation by
the recipient.
The stock of reception and
evening footwear has again
been renewed and is now per
fectly complete. It is not a
bit too early to think of the
footwear for the New Year's
reception, especially if you
are intending to have them
made to order.
Although we show every
popular shade in satin and
kid, we cannot always match
gowns perfectly without
making up the slippers to or
der.
Those who are intending a
southern trip will find here
all the advance styles in light
weight footwear.
