HAGAN NOT SUSPENDED.
COMMISSIONER LANTRY RE
VERSES HIS DEPUTY.
A STORY WHICH TENDS TO INDICATE
LAXITY OF MANAGEMENT
AT THE TOMBS.
Commissioner Lantry of the Department of
Corrections has refused to indorse the action
liken by his deputy, N. O. Fanning, on Saturday
in suspending from duty Warden James J.
H&car> of the Tombs Prisor on charges of ac
cording unusual liberties to ex-Wardman Bis
sert. convicted of receiving money from the
keeper of an alleged disorderly house. Mr. Fan
nine. when seen yesterday, said:
"Commissioner Lantry took the papers in the
case, and he does not approve of my suspension
of Warden Hagan. When I took the action I
expressly stated thai the whole matter was re
ferred to Commissioner Lantry. That is all I
care to say."
Warden Hagan appeared at the Tombs about
I*i o'clock yesterday forenoon. According to the
keepers it was the first time that the warden
had ■-■-! appeared at his post on a Sunday. He
remained until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
Asked about his suspension, he said:
w "Wliilf Commissions Lantry is in the city,
any act of Deputy Commissioner Fanning is
that of .i private citizen. I shall pay no atten
tion 10 bis suspension of me as warden of the
Tombs. 1 came down as usual to-day to attend
to business, and was not interfered with. Had
I been 1 should have resented such interference.
"It was purely a case of religion, which I de
plore, and I will not say who started it. It
v. as alleged by a certain missionary who comes
uj« sere to the Tombs that I favored Wardman
Blssert and allowed him to <?at at my table
and also to send out for delicacies. Before a
man if convicted of a crime 1 extend to him the
privileges that a man supposed to be innocent
ur.der the law enjoys. If I know a man who is
a prisoner i shall naturally lean toward him.
as any other man will, but during the four years
that I have been here I have never given a
prisoner an unwarranted advantage, nor have I
abus-ed a man.
SAYS CHAPLAIN WAS ANGRY AT HIM.
"Chaplain John J. Munro became angry at me
lor a reason which I will not state, except to
mv that it was a personal matter, and Deputy
Commissioner Fanning took up the fight.
"I am sorry that it occurred, especially as I
will soon be out of office, owing to the change
of administrations, and hate to have an attack
made upon me at this late day. I met Deputy
Commissioner Fanning Saturday afternoon, and
v •- parted abcut 3 o'clock. Then he came around
to the prison about 10 o'clock that night- and left
n note for me saying that I was suspended. Ho
Also stated to a couple of reporters that he could
noi rind mo there, giving them the impression
t'>*i I was derelict in my duty. Ho knew when
hr made this statement that I was on days and
v as not supposed to be. in the office at night."
Commissioner Lantry said ho had received a
-mi on Saturday night from Mr. Fanning,
telling of the suspension of Warden Hagan.
My idea. ".'said Commissioner Lantry. "is that
V- Fanning lost his head. He certainly acted
ill advisedly, for I was in the city, and if there
was cause for Warden Hasan's suspension I
should have been called upon to act in the mat
ter. The charges, as 1 understand them, are
that Warden Hagan afforded special privileges
to Bissert. that Blssert was permitted to dine at
:he warden's table, and enjoyed other special
privileges. The warden of the city prison has
th»> right to afford such privileges to any pris
oner in his charge as he sees fit, so long as the
rules of the- prison are not violated. I under-
Ftand Bissert did dine at the warden's table, as
he had the right to do if the warden granted
him that privilege.
"Warden Hagan is a good officer, and in his
term of four years has proved himself thorough
ly efficient. Mr. Fanning is also an excellent
official, but somewhat erratic. I shall be at my
office to-morrow (Mondavi, and will make a
thorough investigation. Hagan will have a full
opportunity to answer the charges against him,
which, as I understand, originated through %
<:uafrel between Chaplain Munro. representing
the Presbyterian Mission Society at the city
pi hum, and another missionary. It was a dis
pute as to which of those two should have the
righr to deposit certain of his books in an empty
ed!."
Mr. Fanning was seen last night, but would
Bay nothing about the case.
PAROLED MAN KEPT IN A CELL.
.V stery was told yesterday by David Willard
T.hkh would seem to indicate some laxity in the
management of the Tombs. Charles L. Smith,
twenty years old. who was arrested early in No
vember on a charge of stealing a piece of lead
I>ip». was paroled on probation on November 8
aad placed in the custody of Mr. Willard. who is
Maacct«d~ with the University Settlement, and
»h-, i.y special permission of the Department of
Correction, has charge of the boys' department
at tfae Tombs. On Friday he completed his fifth
y-.ir of service there. Although Smith was offi
cially eel at liberty on November S. he was kept
in the Tombs for another month, and might have
remained there indefinitely if Mr. Willard had
not accidentally found him there.
"I was coming out of the Tombs on Friday
morning," said Mr. Willard to a Tribune re
porter yesterday, "wh< n the man who sells
Papers there .said he had got into conversation
with a you-g man locked up in one of the cells
»'bo said something about being in my charge.
The young man said be wanted to see me. and I
■cat in, to look him up that morning. Smith
•sii he wanted to know when his case was com
mit up for trial. He told me he was placed in
my custody by Justice Jerome on November S.
or thereabouts* and he looked to me for' advice.
"•lt seems to Tr.e/ I said, "your case is long
delayed. i will look into it."
"I went to the court and inquired of the clerK
Ear the papers. The papers said plainly that
tlie <-ase had been disposed of on November v
The clerk said there must be some mistake. I
' ok the papers and went to see the chief clerk.
tt.Vt safd that Smith had been released on pro
bation on November S. I told him he was mis
tclrea; that I had seen Smith In his cell. He
••aid the young man must have been rearrested
on son:** other charge, or something of that
kind, because on the original charge' h- hud
•-•-en released. Word was sent over to the
Tombs, and they replied that they had no such
boy there; that Smith had been liberated on
probation on November S.
" 'He isn't here.' they told me. 'He was re
• Hi some time ago and will probably come
around to see you tome time soon.*
"I insisted that he was in the Tombs, and gave
them his cell and tier number, and told them I
bad •en there and had talked with him. They
--!.! for a Tombs record to show what disposi
tion had been made of the case.' The record
showed that Smith had been released on Novem
ber 8, and that officially he was not in the
prison. Finally then sent an officer to the cell,
where he found the boy. He was immediately
brought to court before Judge Holbrook. who,
after examining the papers, said: 'The boy is in
Jour charge. Take him."
Tit is a most remarkable case. Both the
Tombs and the court records showed that the
Ifoy was : discharged, and yet he was ktpt in
prison .for a month. How he came to be recon
lined in the Tombs after he *as liberated no
body twined to know. He was not held by any
minority that we can determine, and there waa
absolutely no reason for the officials holding
him. If I. had not im'estißated the case It If
Possible that they would have held him until
doomsday.
A HOSPITAL IN THE STREET
HOW ORANGE HAS OUTWITTED OBJEC
TION TO ITS PESTHOUSE.
IT HAS ERECTED BUILDINGS FOR ITS
SMALLPOX PATIENTS IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE.
Orange. N. J.. Dec. S (Specials — The author
ities of the city of Orange planned a clever coup
in the erection of a temporary hospital for the
treatment of the ten patients now sick with
smallpox, and to-night the sick persons were
removed to the building and are comfortably
housed there, while the city has no fear of fur
ther injunctions or restraining orders, since no
court would grant an order after patients were
in the hospital. Driven from one place to an
other in attempts to erect a building, and
thwarted at every point, the city finally decided
to close a street one block long and erect the
hospital in the middle of the thoroughfare. In
taking this action the authorities have placed
themselves in a position where they may be in
dicted for obstructing a public thoroughfare,
but every one concerned is willing to stand an
indictment if any grand jury should determine
that in such an emergency a municipality trans
tressed the laws.
The city mad? every effort to erect a hospital
before deciding to use the street. First. an ap
plication was made to the city of East Orange
for pel ml— lon to erect a hospital on the Orange
poor farm, a tract of thirty-three acres in East
Orange. The New-Jersey laws provide that no
hospital can be huilt by one municipality within
the limit? of another municipal corporation
without the consent of that corporation's gov
erning body. The East Orange Board of Health.
and subsequently its City Council, gave the
necessary permission, but this af.tion was
vetoed by Mayor Edward E. Bruen of East
Orange. Then the West Orange Town Council
was appealed to for permission to place the
building in that town on the Orange Mountain.
Pressure brought to bear by citizens resulted in
the West Orange Council refusing the request
It was then that August K. Eckert gave tho city
permission to use his vacant land, at Mosswood
and Hey wood ayes.. for the hospital.
The erection of the buildings whs begun, when
an injunction was obtained by Thomas G. Bar
ber, who owns vacant land near by: J. K.
Wierdsna. of lfosswood-ave^ South Orange: the
Bey. Charies L. Pardee, rector of St. Andrew's
«"hurcb. South drancc rind Mrs. Bertha J.
Chandler and Perry Walton, of Ifosswood-ave.,
( trange.
When this injunction was granted on Friday
night the city authorities looked about for ways
and means, and finally decided to place the.
building: in the middle of Heywood-ave. This
street was deeded to the city by Edward E.
Clapp, manager of the Fidelity and Casualty
Company, of New- York, who owns surrounding
property, and who lives In Washlngton-st., East
Orange. Although accepted by the city, the
street is passable, because the stumps of trees
there have never been removed. The injunction
on the part of residents in the neighborhood to
the use of the Eckert property was granted, be
cause in the deed given by John G. Vose. the
original owner, twenty years ago. there was a
clause providing that the land should not be
used for a stable, stores, circus or anything: else
objectionable, obnoxious -or -detrimental to the
surrounding property.
The extension of Heywood-ave., in which the
hospital is erected, was deeded to the city by
Mr. Clapp. He was anxious to obtain an in
junction yesterday, but no grounds could be
found to warrant the granting of this demand.
Lest some new ground should be found, it was
decided by the authorities to proceed with the
erection of the buildings rapidly. Electric lights
were raised all about the place, and the work
was carried on all night and continued to-day.
Now that the buildings are erected, no court, it
is thought, will give any injunction. inasmuch as
the smallpox patients are all housed in the place.
Mayor Henry Stetson, of Orange, was so in
dignant over the action of the property owners
in getting an injunction, even though the hos
pital is 500 feet distant from the nearest dwell
ing, that he issued a proclamation yesterday,
attested with the city seal, in this proclamation
he said, referring to Mr. Kckert. that •'his soul
is much larger than his pocketbook/" and. con
tinuing, ho said that the residents who had ob
tained the injunction had "no regard for the
interests of their own city." "Just why these
•littlo people' should lend a hand to such a pro
ceeding,'' said the Mayor, "surpasses all com
prehension." He called upon the people of the
city to "sustain by their words and action the
work of the Board of Health in this trying
emergency and give them their moral support
in their almost superhuman efforts to stamp
out the dread disease, instead of allowing it to
become epidemic, as some property owners seem
to desire. They have done the very best they
could, while thwarted in their benevolent work
by the very people who should have come to
their assistance.*'
The New-England Society of Orange last
night directed its committee on public welfare
to report upon the merits of the opposition to
the erection of the hospital. The resolutions
were presented by <"amillus G. Kidder, and de
clare that the spread of smallpox in the country
and the existence of several cases in the com
munity give reason to fear that the disease will
become epidemic this winter. The resolutions
also declare in favor of a permanent isolation
hospital for the Oranges, and attention is called
to the fact that the money spent in the present
outbreak would have provided such a hospital.
Two new cases developed in Orange yester
day. Thomas J. Taylor, a New-York business
man. whose daughter was married only ten
days ago. was taken sick with the disease. He
lived until last week at Palm Lodge, in Centre
st., which abuts on the property where the
Peters family live and where the smallpox, fust
appeared. Last week Mr. Taylor sold Palm
Lodge and moved to High-st..- Orange. Robert
Brennan. a watcher, employed at the Hurlbut
st. house, was also taken with the disease. These
cases make a total of twelve in Orange since the
disease broke out. There have been two deaths.
IM V TOSSED KY A BUFFALO.
THE LAST OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK
ORANG OUTANGS DYING.
Bernard McEnroe, a keeper at the New-York
Zoological Park, had a narrow escape yesterday
from the wrath of Black Beauty, the big buf
falo bull in the park- It was Black Beauty that
so nearly killed one of the smaller bulls in the
buffalo lot a few weeks ago. Yesterday Mc-
Enroe and others were driving him into a
small corral with a cement floor, because his
hoofs were growing too long in the soft earth
of his paddock. The cement floor will wear
them down to their normal length. Black
Beauty was close to the gate leading into the
corral, when he wheeled suddenly, made a dash
toward McEnroe, and, before the keeper could
get out of the big brute's way, jammed one ugly
horn through McEnroe's right boot leg. The
flesh on his leg was torn, but not seriously.
McEnroe turned a somersault on the buffalo's
horn, and landed heavily in a fence corner
twenty feet away, much shaken up. A fellow
keeper brought a stout club down across the
bull's nose, and Black Beauty entered the corral.
Sally, the last of the orangoutangsg outangs in the
Park, has fallen a victim to the same disease
that carried off her companion, and is exceed
ingly ill. Superintendent Hornaday says her
malady is incurable. The disease is technically

|BY TELKGRAr-H TO TIIK TRIIiINK.I
Boston. Dec. X.— Thomas W. Lawson to-night
issued the following statement to the public:
No one regrets more than I the bad break in
the price of the stock of the Trinity Copper
Compangr, which occurred last week. I own
150,000 shares, a short time ago worth at mar
ket prices $6,000,000, and at Saturday's price only
$2,000,000; but as none of it is carried on mar
gin or borrowed on. and as I believe it is worth
much more than it has ever sold for. and will
sell higher than it has ever sold. I will not sell
it, and it therefore can in no way be a menace
to the market.
As I believe th?ro is tittle Trinity carried on
n^aridn outside that carried by my house, which
will carry its customers to a finish on it. I see
no reason for holders to be scared into selling.
The cause of the drop in price was that ev
erything I am, or mi supposed to Vie interested
in has been under savage attack for weeks. I
protected Trinity by buying until, as the on
slaught grew more furious. I might have fatally
weakened myself if i had stood my ground
longer. I therefore decided it best, regardless
of the personal humiliation, to beat a retreat.
I earnestly request those who in the past have
been with me in some pretty light stock market
holes and who then had faith, afterward found
to be well founded, not to allovv any of the des
perate tactics of my generous opponents to pre
vail with them to the extent of causing them to
act t<> their own loss.
Above all. I ask them not to be stampeded by
the rumors, however well "proven" they may be.
that I have capitulated or compromised.
I cive them my word— and they, regardless of
Wall Street scoffs, know whether my word
should bo, as it always has been, at par —
I give them my word I cannot be "gunned out"
or made to capitulate or compromise, and that I
will bo <lc.ing what business I decide to do in the
way I decide to do it when every one of those
who are lighting me has sneaked off the field,
and I will do this, as in the past, without asking
or accepting any assistance from any one.
I do not wish to disguise that since the cut In
the Amalgamated dividend 1 have lost heavily,
or that I will not continue to lose, but I do want
those who through long years of good and bad
times have "been with" roe to know I am now,
as always in thr> past, conducting my affairs on
thos.-' old fashioned business principles which
are absolute guarantees of solvency at nil times,
without the favor of any. ;ind 1 also want them
to know that tho tight now on, and which
started with the coke and g;is Hffair and
climaxed in the cup d^fendine episode, is to ho
to a finish, and that while I expect no quarter I
want none :md will give none.
I just want my friends to know this fight will
be to a flnish.
TO SURVEY ANACONDA MINE.
HEINZE <;ETS PERMISSION FROM THE
COURT TO EXAMINE AMALGA
MATED PROPERTIES.
„ [HT TKI.FC.RAPH TO TITC Tr.lr.isr I
Butte, Mont., Dec. £. — Another surprise was
sprung .n the - Amalgamated litigation
yesterday .by Judge Clancy, of the District
Court, who granted an order permitting Hetuse'a'
men to make a thorough Inspection and survey
of the underground .. workings. of the».Anncondri
mine, one of the 4 lOTtiflTT" ****** largest prop
erties. The order giants permission to the.
Heinze. people to go into the Anaconda and St.
Lawrence properties, and for a period of ten
days, extending from December 11 to •_"_'. to
make an Investigation of the work being done
by the Amalgamated people there
The order Issued by Judge Clancy is the result
of a suit of long standing, wherein Heinze peti
tioned for the permission to make this examina
tion. In the complaint filed in that action Eieinze
claimed that he owned a half interest in the
Fairmount mine, which adjoins the Anaconda
and St. Lawrence, and that lie had reason to be
lieve that his interests were being encroached
by the Anaconda company, and that the latter
was mining "re from veins having their apexes
in the Fairmount and by underground workings
in that claim. The order to show cause why
this permission should not be granted was issued
about a year ago, and the matter has been hang
ing fire since that time until the court made the
order requested yesterday.
Following the order granted to Heinze to in
spect the Amalgamated properties. Judge
Clancy, at the request of tho Boston and Mon
tana company, granted that company permis
sion t<> send six men into the Minnie Healy
mine, over which so much notoriety < amo !"
Judge Hartley and Mrs. Brackett, and to mike
a thorough inspect ion of the workings of <hr.t
property. In this case, the order of the cour*
granted to the Boston and Montana company
permission to survey the underground work
ings of the Minnie Healy and ascertain just
what work is being done hy the Heinze people
there. This order was. however, stayed for a
period of ten days by Judge Clancy.
Following these orders. Judge Clancy ap
pointed Richard Lacy as inspector of the <\>
manche mine while tin- Boston and Montana
company is operating it. The same man was
appointed, on the request of the Heinze people,
as inspector of the Piccolo, <sambetta and Day
ton mines, and his duties are to report to the
court the work being done by the Boston and
Montana company in those properties. The
quick succession of orders made yesterday cre
ated much excitement among copper interests
here, and the next move by the Ilcinze people,
which it is expected will lie in the shape of
further suits and injunctions, is awaited with
keen interest.
HAS MRS. DALY SOLD OUT?
PKRSISTKNT RtMOR THAT SHE IHSPOSED OF
COPPER HOLDINGS DENIED.
Butte. Mont.. Doc. fS. — Persistent rumors have
been afloat here to-day regarding heavy losses
through investment in Amalgamated Coppe!"
stock by Mrs. Daly, widow of Marcus Daly,
the copper king. Mrs. Daly received by
the provisions of her husband's will many shares
in this giant company, and the story, which
comes from reliable sources in Butte, says that
the widow of th? multi-millionaire invested but
a short time ago s?. - eral more millions of dol
lars in tne Amalgamate;! stock at top prices,
ranging from 126 and 127 a share. The stock
began a terrific decline, which carried with it
immense losse.-. and Mrs. Daly, feat ing the
resulU. not only disposed of her new holdings
but als.. (he stock which had been in the Daly
family since the organization of the Amalga
mated Company.
Mis. Daly, it the report be true, is the loser
by her recent investment of nearly two million
dollars, and by her quick determination to sell
out the shares she held in the concern sent the
price of the stock on a downward course, which
stopped only after tho lowest price on record was
reached in the marketing of the stock at T.'V
In the face of the story of the sale of the Dab
estate stock. John D. Ryan, vice-president of th«»
Daly Bank and Trust Company, says to-day that
he had received a telegram from John C. Laior,
manager of the estate, in which he emphatically
denies the n mors concerning the disposal of the
Amalgamated stock. Mr. Lalor further said that
the Daly people had the greatest faith in the
Amalgamated and had no intention of selling
their holdings.
PL ATT TO RE RE-ELECTED.
COLONEL DUNN SAYS THE SENATOR
WILL CONSENT.
DXCI.ARES HE TS A COMPARATIVELY POOR
MAN, AND HAS GIVEN HIS MONEY
FOR THE PARTY.
"Senator Platt will be re-elected to the T'nited
States Senate, despite his present desire to re
tire from that office. There is a tremendous sen
timent in the Republican organization, which
Mr. Platt will not resist when he realizes its
magnitude. This sentiment has been caused by
Senator Platt's sacrifices to the Republican
party and his own personal int< Tlty."
This statement was made yesterday by Colo
nel George W. Dunn, the chairman of the Re
publican State Committee. Colonel Dunn had
come down from his home, at Binghamton, and
he said that he intended to stay in this city
the entire week. He was moved to speak of
the United States Senatorship by the report
that Lieutenant-Governor Woodruff was likely
to succeed Senator Platt. Colonel Dunn went
on to say:
"You can trot out all the candidates for the
successor of Thomas C. Platt that you wish.
The number or the kind of men will make little
difference. If Senator Platt lives until January
' 1, lSiO.*',. and has two legs to stand on, he will
be elected his own successor."
"But he has said that he does not want to
be returned." suggested a newspaper man.
"I know ho has," was the answer. "But he
will be re-elected despite that. There is a senti
ment in the Republican party of this State
which he will not want to resist when he learns
its strength. The sentiment for re-electing
Thomas C. Platt is as strong as the sentiment
which elected him first. His leadership in this
State is as strong as. if no' stronger than, it
ever was."
"What are the reasons for Senator Platfs
immense power as a leader?" was asked.
'"His self-sacrificing and his integrity of char
acter," was the reply. "Senator Platt is a poor
man to-day, although he might have made
millions in a way which many political leaders
would have considered legitimate. Senator Platt
has for the last twenty years drawn a salary of
$18,<MK» as president of the United States Ex
press Company. Part of that time he has
also been a United States Senator, at a
salary of >C..O<K». And yet to-day ho is a com
paratively poor man. I would not give $100,000
for a full and clear title to all that the Senator
possesses. In his place as State leader, with the
great powers that are attendant upon that office,
with the complete control of patronage, and
with all the other Influences that accompany
such a place. Senator Platt might have made
$20.0001000. And ho might have done so In a
way which many political leaders would con
sider as wholly legitimate.
"But instead of building up wealth for himself,
the Senator has contributed his own money to
the work of the Republican organization. He
ha.s always gone down into his pocket in sup
port of the cause of his organization whenever
the call came, and whenever he saw that defeat
was inevitable without his support. He has
often been known to contribute out of his own
pocket toward the candidacy of his friends. I
have seen this with my own eyes many and
many a time. It was always the success of the
Republican arms that was uppermost in his
mind. And thus it is that he hay built up a
wonderful organization, which will stand by him
to "th» last ditch, and will send him back to
Washington."
The election of United States Senator will be
held at the session of th« Legislature in 1003.
The men who will vote at this election will be
the Senators and Assemblymen who are to bo
Chosen at the polls next. fall. Rec.iuse of the
preponderance of the Republican party in the
legislature at the present time, it is safe to as
sume, so the up-State R^punlican leaders say,
that the Repu oilcans will then have control.
Only a Democratic lands-lido will be able, they
say, to turn the scale. It i?: for this reason
that the Republican leaders are at the present
time cautious about making any changes in the
Excise law, which, some of them fear, will
alienate the rural population of the State, upon
which the Republican party depends.

FEARS FOU MISSJyQ VESSEL.
A BUGAB SCHOONKR, WITH A BROOKLYN
CAPTAIN AND SKAMEX, LONG OVEKDUK.
Grave fears an- held in Brooklyn for the safe
ty of tho two hundred ton schooner Cameo, of
which Captain Frederick Coffin is the master,
and on which were seven other Brooklyn men as
part uf the crew. The Cameo, which is owned
by Bartram Bros., of No. t>o Pearl-st.. Manhat
tan, left St. Croix on October Uti. She was
heavily laden with sugar and sugar cane for the
Havemeyer refineries in the -Eastern District.
The voyage from St. Croix. 1,460 miles from
Brooklyn, is usually accomplished in fifteen days,
and the Cameo is now nearly a month overdue.
A sister ship, the Tromer. which left St. Croix
nearly three weeks after the Cameo, arrived in
Brooklyn Saturday.
The Tromer reports a rough passage, and says
that she did not sight the Cameo at any time.
Captain Alden Calbeth is the regular master of
the Cameo, but has been taking a vacation, and
on her last voyage she was commanded by Cap
tain' Cotiin. whose home is at No. 154 Carroll-st..
Brooklyn. It is known that seven of the seamen
live in Brooklyn, but it was not possible yester
day to get their names.
There were no passengers on the Cameo, but
she carried mails for the United States from
the Danish West Indies. The Bi Anchor, a sis
ter ship of the Cameo, was wrecked about two
years ago on her way north. She ran into a
storm off Porto Rico and was never afterward
heard of.

MARX HERE, TELLS HIS STORY.
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO GET HIM Ol.'T THE NIGHI
BEFORE THE SHOOTING— THE TRAGEDY DESCRIBED.
HAS BEEN IX BROOKLYN SINCE LATE FRIDAY' xmHT.
Herbert Marx, the young Brooklynite, who last
Tuesday night, at the family plantation In West
moreland County, Va., shot three men of a
arty of five of his old friends, who had come
with the purpose of treating him to a coat of
tar and feathers on account of a false rumor
hat he had insulted a young woman, -sat last
night in the home of his brother-in-law, Abel K.
lackmar. No. 1,274 Bergen-st.. Brooklyn, and
related his experiences. In spite of the terrible
deal, Marx seemed last night to have excellent
control of himself, and the rumors that he was
suffering from nervous prostration are utterly
groundless. He has been in Brooklyn since
midnight on Friday, but did not reveal his pres
ence until Mr. Blackmar returned.
With Mr. Marx when he told his story were
Mr. Blackmar and his brother. Ernest Marx,
vi ho at the first intimation of trouble went at
once to Virginia. They allowed the young man
to speak for himself, but added some interesting
details which came to light after he had started
for Washington, where he had been since he left
o at the first intimation of trouble went at
;e to Virginia. They allowed the young man
speak for himself, bur added some interesting
ails which came to light after he had started
Washington, wh»*re he had been since he left
Virginia. Mr. Blackmar and Mr. Marx got home
yesterday afternoon. They say that they and
Herbert Marx received the fairest and most
chivalrous treatment from the Southerners, and
had nothing except praise for the attitude of the
best people in Westmoreland County.
On the day after the inquest, last Wednesday.
Herbert Marx started at once for Frederlcksburg
by boat, meeting his brother and brother-in
law at the wharf in Fredericksburg on Thursday
morning. After he had thoroughly explained the
story young Marx went to Washington, where
he stayed with friends, and had a long talk with
Congressman William Jones, from the West
moreland district.
Mr. Blackmar and the brother left Fredericks
burg for Oak Grove by carriage. They stopped
at the home of Colonel Robert J. Washington,
the prosecuting attorney for Westmoreland
County, and mad* a thorough investigation of
the entire occurrence. They say the best senti
ment of the district is that young Marx acted
in a perfectly proper manner, and that the ut
most courtesy was extended to them during
their stay there.
VIRGINIA PLANTATION SOLD.
The final act in closing up the tragedy was
the selling of Cedar Hill, the Marx plantation
of 500 acres, which has been in the family for
eighteen years. Harry Coates, who bought the
place, had. it is said, been wanting to buy it
for some time. During the tim« that Mr. Rlaek
mar and Ernest Marx were at Oak Grove they
had had no communication with the family in
Brooklyn because there was no telegraph line
there, and the only telephone was in the store
of Mr. Stiff, th» father of one of the young men
who was shot. It was therefore a surprise to
the family when th? party arrived home yester
,day. The members of the Marx family were
at the Blaekmar home last night. Herbert says
that he does not know what be will do now. as
his health is far from satisfactory, and it Is
n < re than likely that he will go away for the
winter.
Leaning back in a large arm chair Herbert
Marx told the story of the tragedy that will be
a bitter memory as long as his life lasts. There
was no tone of exultation over the brave way
in which he had defended himself, and scarcely
a trace of nervousness in his manner. The
only time that a choking came into his throat
was when he. was asked if he had any intima
tion of who the members of the attacking party
were.
"No, indeed." It* said, with a quaver in his
voice, "those boys were my friends. 1 knew
them all, except Douglass. Had I seen who
they were I would be dead to-day, for I never
would have used my gun. There was absolutely
nothing as far .-is I knew which would lead
th«*m to bear any ill will toward me. There
was not one of them whom I would not have
called upon on the day of the shooting."
A man was employed to care for the Mam
estate, but hp was living at some distance from
the house in whi<h Marx was staying alone.
This was a small frame two story building, with
only two large rooms on the ground floor. Com
ing in from a small stoop one stepped into a liv
ing room to the right. To the right of that was
a bedroom. Above were two other rooms. Marx
was reading in the bedroom when his assailants
appeared.
PREVIOUS ATTEMPT TO GET HIM OUT.
It seems that on the night before — Monday
night — they had evidently made an attempt to
get him out. but failed. Of this Marx said:
"It was after midnight. I was asleep. I heard
a rap on my window. I got up and answered
the summons. A man was there. I could not
see his face, but he said he was a drummer, rep
resenting a candy store in Baltimore. He wan
ed to know the way to Oak Grove. I told him
but he lingered and wanted to draw me into
conversation. He had a cigar, and whenever
he puffed up the light he would turn away his
face. "Turn around here and let me see who
you are?" I said. He only smiled and turned his
head. Finally I closed the window and went to
bed. I heard him still prowling around, and I
got up again and told him to go away. I" had
called down the dog from upstairs, and when he
saw the dog he got out."
Mr. Blaekmar said that he had learned that
the incident of Monday night was the forerunner
of the more serious meeting of the following
night. Who the "drummer" was has not been
learned, but it is probable that it was R. H.
Douglass, who was not known to Marx. Evi
dently it had been his purpose to get the young
man out of the house. Tuesday was the day of
the tragedy. Herbert Marx told of It as follows:
"Tuesday was a stormy day, and I was in the
house all day with Herbert Raitt, a young man
who formerly cared for ojir estate, but now has
a place "of his own. He left me in the evening,
and I sat down to read at a table near the front
window. It was about 9:.'Ml o'clock, I think,
when I heard a crash of breaking glass from the
window looking out into the rear yard behind
me. I jumped to my. feet, and saw a masked
man standing outside the window. He had a
rifle pointed at me. I made a jump for the bed.
which stood in the corner not far from the back
window. There I got my pistol
THOUGHT IT . WAS A JOKE.
"My first thought was that some one was play- j
ing a practical joke on me. and I cried: "For '
God's sake; are you fooling?'
"I got no reply, and. turning about at another
sound of crashing glass, saw another man with
a handkerchief partly covering his face, in front
of him a rifle which was levelled at inc. I
sprang to tne door leading: into the living room '
and ran to the front door. I opened the spring *
lock and looked out, but saw nothing: it was i
too dark. In smother instant more glass came ,

crashing in around me from the window, whicli
was only a few feet from the door. Before I
could decide what to do I heard a further crash*
and. turning, saw that a man had jumped in
through the window. He was right behind me.
and as he had a gun I could not act too quickly.
I think I put my pistol under my left arm and
fired. The man fell.
"Up to this time I had heard no shots, but
■ had sot firmly over the idea that it was a prac
tical jokt-. and thought probably that my assail
ants were oystermen, whom I knew to be dan
gerous characters. It was learned afterward
that the man I shot first was J. Q. Stiff. -* "rl J "
"Next I went out on the porch and looking;
around saw no on*-. The light from the bed-
I room window was streaming out on me and I
' ran out into the shadow about fifteen feet.
Another man loomed up in front of me. He
1 was carrying a gun and quick as a Hash I shot
at him. There is it. denying that I was thor
oughly scared all the time, as I believed I was
dealing with dangerous characters and did noC
i know but there were a dozen or more of them.
1 I wandered around the yard for several mm-»
utes, not knowing Just where I was, but finally!
I came to the board fence in front and climbed;
j over into the Dear orchard.
"The minute I struck the ground I was con
i fronted by another masked figure. Again £
shot, and the man fell with a groan. It »a«
j William Taylor, as I afterward learned. Will
j iam Heflin was The second man shot. I was
between Taylor and the light, and I wondered,
that he had not shot me as I climbed over th"»
I fence.
"After Taylor dropped I lay in the grass for*
about ten minutes, as I wanted to see how many?
m< re there were in the neighborhood. I thought
that the man in the grass near by was just
I fcoling. and was watching for a chance to hi..
I thinking that if he could get one shot at ma
It would make up. you know, for the shootine
of his friends. As I lay there, with my revolver
rocked. I thought I saw other men moving

AROUSED THE NEIGHBORS.
"Finally I decided to run for it. hoping to gee
j away. I ran for l-"> 0 feet, then fell and listened.
| Not hearing: anything. 1 grot up and made my
way as fast as possible to the house of "Bob*
j Guttridge. who runs th« plantation of David H.
Griffith. "Bob" joined me and went to Mr. Grif
fith's house, which was about half a. mile from
cedar Hill. The family were all up and MOM
I of the neighbors were in the room. I told of
I my experience with what I supposed were rob-
I bers. Mr. Griffith and Guttridge started to gar
I back to my place.
j "I was cold and tired and scared. and did n«t
I want to go back, but they thought I had better.
I I broke my gun to see how much ammunition I
J had. and found only one shot left I must have
j rired four times, as [ usually kept the revolver
I fully loaded, but I do not remember firing ■!■!
I than three shots. I had no more cartridges with
is.-, but Mr. Griffith finally found a. shotgun.
I We had a lantern, but we were a scared lot off
I men. On the way back we found the tracks of
j the two buggies in which Taylor and the others
I had driven to the house.
"When we reached o.ir plantation w<* yell^t

j kept hollaring, and suddenly we heard some on»
I calling faintly, 'Dave:* We went into the living
! room. and found two men lying by the door.

I nized Griffith and spoke to him. Then we recog
1 nized Stiff. Then again I thought that thes*
, men, who had been my friends, had been frying
• to play a practical joke on me, and a feeling oC
horror came over me."
"N>!ther man had much lo ■-.?, v to m<». but
Hefflin said "Yes* when I asked if it was all a,
| terrible joke. Later, after we had fixed the men
j comfortably on two mattre?s*»s and had decided
to take them up the river to Washington. HeiTHn
I looked at me and said feebly 'H<?re, are you
' going to th*» boat with us?*
STRONGLY GUARDED.
• "As soon as we found the wounded m»n I sent
; Paunders for Dr. St»wari. twelve miles away. ; C
1 went for Dr. Washington, who lived only five
■ miW away. It was not until after I came baclc
J that I had any inkling of what the trouble wa<»
< all about. That night Willard Raitt stayed at
j my house. Th»» body of Taylor, which we found
! in th* front yard, was placed in a building a.
■ short distance away. 1 ml M Mr. Griffith's
liou?e. In the morning he told me that I had
better not stay ther«*. as there might be- trouble.
Ha did not say that I might be lynched, but I
knew what he meant, and went to Raitt's hous<*
and stayed there until the constable came for
, me. He did everything as it ought to have been
done. ThTe were eisrht or ten deputies who had
been sworn in. and they walked in front and be
hind the constable's carriage, in which I rode.
I They were all heavily armed.
i "Th" Coroner's jury mt-t iii my iiprirnr.m Th^

body, and the members of the jury had <**-
amined the premises thoroughly. Carroll Thomp
son, one of the jurymen, was ■ br"th<»r of Geors<»
Thompson, who was in th.- attacking party. Tha
hearing took all day. and I was honorabiy ac
• quitted. Rose Taylor, the younff. woman wh.o.
, unfortunately, was mixed up in the trouble, diil
not appear before the jury, (lit hat statemenc
exonerating me from the charge •'■ having of
fered an insult was procured from nor by th»
family physician. Dr. Washington.
"I as advised by my friends to Invt th»
county at once, as 1 was told that an attempt
might be made to lynch in- •. That night. Thurs
day, I drove over to Leedstown. about severe
miles tram Oak Grove, and took the boat for
Fredericksburg. 1 was driven to the boat by i.
son of Colonel Robert J. Washington, the prose
cuting attorney. From Fredericksburg I went *<»
Washington, and then « ame to Brooklyn.
"Why. of course I kissed her." said Mr. Marx,
! when he was asked about Miss Taylor. "She is
i only a little girl, and I have known her for ever
so long. Why. I have often kissed her at her —
) own home. I never culled on her. because sha
: was too young, but 1 was paying some attention,
j to another young iady. and it was on the latter*
account that I happened to be walking to the?
| postoffice with Rose Taylor on the night that, £
I was said to have insulted her. Then was i
Thanksgiving party in the church. I hail askeii
the young lady of whom I spoke to $;<> for a
walk, and she did not respond as quickly as [
thought she should, and I said: "Come. Rose;
you and I will go M the postoffice." So we did.
We did not meet anybody on the way. but I
suppose this itinerant negro preacher. John.
: Bird, who I understand gave out the false state
i ments, saw us. It may have been that I had
! thrown my arm around the girl. I do not re
'■ member that I did. but 1 might have done so.
•It Is absurd to say that Taylor was jealous
• of me. because the- girl was too young for either
of us to think of courting seriously. I have not
seen her since the shooting, but she made a,
statement fully exonerating me."
THREATS AGAINST BIRD.
Mr. Blackmar said that on the night before h«
and Ernest Marx left Oak Grove, the oystermen
were threatening to lynch the negro. Bird, and
that he had hung around the house of the- pros
; ecuting attorney all night for protection. Th*
! brother-in-law also added some further details
i of the story- He said that on the morning after
the shooting on the grounds near Cedar Hill
was found a bag of straw, a bottle of coal oil.
a large can of tar. a bundle of rags saturated
: with oil. and a big blacksnake whip over six
; feet long.
Mr. Blackmar was particularly anxious to
make it plain that the people of Westmoreland
County had treated Herbert as well as himself
and Ernest Marx, with the utmost consideration ;
and kindness. It was on his advice that the
young man did not make his return. to Brooklyn
known until Mr. Blackmar himself returned.' Mr. ; v ;;
Bla<kmar and Ernest "fan have fortified them- ■"
selves with legal evidence concerning the entire m
occurrence in case there should be any trouble -""
in the future. They say. however, that they
believe the case is closed.
