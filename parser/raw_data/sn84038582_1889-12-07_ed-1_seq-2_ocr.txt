SATURDAY.
To-day is the last trading day of the
month, and grain deliveries on the
Board are due on Monday, the 1st.
That fact had seemed to worry very
few traders In corn, even the shorts,
as the fluctuations for the month had
been slight. The breeze, therefore,
that was excited yesterday when
com, opening at 34c, took an up
ward jump, by leaps, reaching
64c. within an hour, became a
whirlwind during the day. Corn
reached 50c. and closed at Mc. With
the biggest crop on record in the crit
this price will hardly be maintained;
but there is enough in it and it will
last long enough to make the shorts
very weary. "Wheat was quiet, open
ing at 741 Dec. and 844 May, touching
J9 and 831, closing ic. above these fig
ures on a rally. Oats slow and steady.
Cattle receipts, 9,000, of which 5,000
were Texans. Business active all
along the line, with prices generally
quoted 10 and 15c. higher than on
Tuesday and Wednesday on prime to
good nati ve steers. Ilecei pts of hogs,
20,000; opened active and higher,
closed weak with the advance lost;
packers paid $3.65(.175 and shippers
$3.753.80; light sorts, $.'Ui5fr3.70. Re
ceipts of sheep, 8,0(K), and ail the best
sold at an advance of 5 and 10c.
The prosecution yesterday in the
Cronin case put on witnesses to prove
that the witnesses for the defense
were liars when they located certain
of the defendants at certain saloons
on the evening of May 4th; and a good
deal of hard swearing was done by
some one, as the defense followed with
witnesses that offset the prosecution.
The latest "queer thing" of the case is
the finding of two of Cronin's jacket
knifes. A police officer named Juynn,
who took Coughlin, along last sum
mer, from the mayor's office, after an
interview, to the jail, reported that he
had forgotten a "little matter," which
was, that on that occasion Coughlin
turned over to him two knives with
the request to put them in the Fidelity
deposit vaults, which he did. The
two knives were found in the vault,
and one was positively Identified as
having belonged to Cronin. As the
testimony for the prosecution has
clowd, and this evidence cannot be
introduced. It Ih presumed the "force"
will make Fly tin a present of a lesither
medal or some other testimonial of his
amazing astuteness.
The origin of the great Boston fire
of Thanksgiving day Is traced to the
crossing of the Time Company's wires
with those of the Electric Light Com
pany, all the clocks connected with
the Time Co.'s wires having stopped
at 0.48, the hour at which the fire
started. The English Insurance com
panies are said to be the heaviest los
ers, the grand total loss being esti
mated now at ten millions.
A furious storm swept over Lake
Michigan Wednesday and Thursday,
and yesterday quite a number of ves
sels were reported lost.

General Gordon was received with
military honors at Chicago yesterday.
He was entertained by the Iroquois
Club last evening, and delivered an
address to the ex-Confederate Associa
tion. The Hurry In com collapsed yester
day after the shorts had settled at 50
and 00c., when it fell back to its nor
mal price of 32c. Wheat was steady,
closing at 7K7!'t Dec., and 841 May.

ment for procuring a divorce by foist
ing perjured evidence on the court.

contempt, being barred by the statute

to prosecution in the Criminal Court.
Doth houses of Congress met at noon

a speaker In the house no business was
done. Reed received 100 votes to Car
lisle's 104. There was great dlsappoint
menton tjie part of the full galleries

understood, will be ready for presen

Postmaster General Wanamaker's
report, of which the press dispatches
give a synopsis, contains some good
ideas and sensible suggestions. or
example, he objects to the custom,
with the advent of every new admin
istration, of changing all the higher
officers of the department. "The
whole organization being changed
from the top," he says, "the work falls
into untrained hands, which so un
settles the service that from a busi
ness point of view It certainly cannot
be beneficial to any department."
In regard to a postal telegraph ser
vice, his suggestions are equally sensi
ble and business like. The sending
and delivery of telegraph messages, he
says, is undoubtedly proper post office
business and would add to the profits
of the department. "The vast net
work of wires covering the country
could easily be made to reach many or
the village post offices and benefit
more people, than by stopping at the
railroad stations, which are often i
mile distant from where people live."
He would not, however, go Into the
business recklessly. "The experiment
could be made at little cost to ascer
tain, firstly, whether such a demand
for cheaper telegraph service existed
as Is claimed. The experiment itself
need not even Interfere with existing
telegraph Interests, as It would be the
creation of a new class of business."
In regard to Sunday mail service, he
says he will make use of all proper
means tending toward the minimis
Ingof post otllco work on Sunday, be
cause he believes the government
should, as far as possible, make no re
quirements which will prohibit Ita em
ployes from the enjoyment of a day of
rest.
Other recommendations which com
mend themselves for their good sensi
are, a double postal card for return
answers; tho establishment of a postal
museum, and the prompt delivery of
all letters on which the postage is not
prepaid, and to collect double postage
at tho other end. Such letters are
now detained at tho ofllce where
mailed until the party addressed,
sometimes a thousand or more miles
away, can be addressed by the post
master and induced to remit a stamp
to cover the postage, wasting another
stamp to do so, a regulation the good
sense of which the public never was
iltle to get on to.

The national silver convention
ri icli met at St. Louis on Wednesday
was attended ny ueiegaies irom mosi
f the southern and western states,
nd was in point of members and tal-
lt a really imposing body. Many able
Idresses were delivered by men like
longressman It. P. Bland, Senator
Stewart, of Nevada, Congressman
Sy mines, of Colorado, Gen. Glnter, of
Mo., Mr. Fitch, of Nevada, the last
named (hithereto unknown to fame,)
positively electrifying the convention
by delivering a speech which in jkiI nt
of force and eloquence far eclipsed all
others.
The sense of the convention, after a
two days' session, Is embodied in the
following resolution, which was unan
imously adopted:
"Resolved, That the List congrses
be requested by this convention to pro
vlilo :t Its tlrst; session for imenimr t he
mints of the United States to the free
and unlimited coinage of standard sil
ver dollars of the present weight and
tlnixu-Hs. toltelcLFnl tender for all debts.
public or private, equal with gold,
and that, until such a provision is
made, the secretary or me treasury oe
r..Miilr.ul tn coin the maximum. LMM)0-
000 worth of silver a month, as now
authorized by law."
Perhaps the strongest paper read to
the convention, and which had great
est influence in guiding its delibera
tions, was that of John Thompson,
Vice President of the Chase National
Rank, of Wall street, New York. He
Insists on the immediate increase of
the silver coinage from $2,000,000 to
$4,000,000 per month, confident that
the success of the augmented coinage
would pave tho way to the adoption
of free coinage by acclamation. The
present gold currency of the country,
he says, is mainly locked up in the
Treasury and our working currency
consists of legal tenders, national
bank notes, coin and sliver certificates.
The latter do not now increase as fast
as the national bank notes are re
tired. The result is a steady contrac
tion while the business demandsof the
country are at an enormous increasi
Hence the rapid depreciation of prop
erty going on, the sheer result of the
demonetization of silver, "which has
been giving wicked preference to the
creditor over the debtor classes of our
entire population, and it is this pref
erence that is driving our middle
classes into poverty and enabling mill
ionaires to multiply their millions,
Nothing in my opinion will save our
people from a social revolution so
surely as tho full remonetization of
silver and giving it all the advantages
we now give to gold, both in law and
in the ruling of our Treasury Depart
ment."
It was confidently stated that one
half of Wall street, that had until
lately been unaminous for the gold
standard, seeing "breakers ahead,"
now endorse the views of Mr. Thomp
son.
TKL'ST.S.
The decision of the Supreme Court
of this state, in the Chicago Gas Trust
case, mentioned In these columns a
few days ago, is attracting wide at
tention, as being quite as destructive
a fulmlnation against trusts as the
late action in Missouri. The gist is of
the lengthy opinion of Judge Magru
der, In which the Court unanimously
concurred, is contained In the follow
ing pregnant paragraph:
"Whatever tends to prevent competi
tion between those engaged in a pub
lic employment, or business impressed
with a public character, is opposed to
public policy and therefore unlawful;
whatever tends to create a monopoly
is unlawful, as being contrary to pub
lic policy. Of what avail is it that
any number of gas companies may be
formed if a giant trust company can
bo clothed v lth the power of buying
up and holding the stock and property
of such companies? To create one
corporation for the express purpose of
enabling it to control all the corpora
tions engaged In a certain kind of
business, and particularly a business
of public character, is not only opposed
to the public policy of the State, but
is in contravention of tho spirit if not
the letter of the constitution."
"Whatever tends to create a monop
oly is unlawful, as being contrary to
nubile nolicv." This language is
sweeping enough to "knock out" cum
ulations and combinations that are
still considerably short of the stage of
a trust, while to every full-blown trust
It Is fatal. Of course the opinion of
Judge Magrader only declares what
the law is, and is not self-executing
It remains for the people, when their
rights or interests are infringed upon
by a trust, to appeal to this law for
protection.
VVIIKKK IS T1IK DKVII.?
New York is just now taking a vast
amount of comfprt from a sermon late
ly preached in Chicago by the Rev. Dr.
Lorimer, a Baptist minister, who arose
In his little pulpit to announce that
the devil cannot be in two places at
the same time. I f that is so, says New
York,-ho must have so much to occupy
his time in the pork-slaughtering
metroiKilis of the bounding West that
New York is measurably exempt from
his presence. With duedeference to
the theological acumen of Dr. Lorimer,
we are inclined to the view of the
Scotch dominie as more orthodox. He
had the Scotch habit of adding the
word "he" after the use of proper
names, and preached from the text,
"The devil icgoeth about like a roar
ing lion, seeking whom lie may de
vour," and treated his subject under
heads: Who the devil he is; why the
devil ho goeth about; whom tho devil
he seeketh to devour; and where the
devil he is now. Omitting, as not
pertinent to the present inquiry, the
good dominie's treatment of the other
heads, his elucidation of the last Is
worthy of the consideration of Dr.
Lorimer. Instead of an omnipresent,
Ids idea was rather that of a pan-
devil. "The devil, my nion,"said he,
is in your heart; in the heart of every
one of you; and It is for you, each one
for himself or herself, to say why the
devil he abideth there, and why the
devil he should not be expelled."

Although as lllinotsans our sympa
thies were naturally with Joe Cannon
In the contest for speaker of the lower
house of congress, it needed little
knowledgeof the composition and gov
erning influences of the Republican
party to forsee that there was no hope
for him. Reed represented the corpor
ate and monopoly Influences that are
now dominant In the party; Cannon
represented the western idea, which is
restive under corporate and monopoly
rule and aims at gradual amelioration
of its vigor. In point of ability and
claim, McKlnley, of Ohio, ought to
have stood before Reed, for did not
the Chicago platform proceed from his
pen and was he not the ablest expo
nent and defender of the principles it
embodied on tho floor of the House?
Rut Ohio is a western state, and the
result of her last November election
was such as naturally to shake im
plicit confidence in McKlnley's firm
ness. So the governinginfluences of
the party were sure of their man only
l)y going as far East for him as possi
ble,' and then found him on the shores
of the Kennebec.
So the house will be run rigidly on
the lines of the Chicago platform,
which means unwavering fidelity to
the interests of the fat contributing
monopolies, liberal subsidies and a
bountiful pension grap.
There was a faint hope, and that
was probably what Cannon built upon,
that the ominous outcome of the last
November elections would give the
extreme protectionists such a hint of
the trend of popular sentiment in the
west that they might let down a little
in their rapacious demands and quiet
western apprehensions by a promise
of amelioration. The nomination of
Reed must dissipate any such hope.
The committees of the house will be
so organized that no tariff legislation
except such as is thoroughly approved
by the protection monopolists will be
possible.
And that is just as the democrats
would have it. They want the Re
publican party to stand in their fort
ress of subsidy and protection, which
the elections last fall having demon
strated not to be impregnable, we
shall in the next onslaught batter
down over their heads.
IMPORTANT ARMY RKCOMMKX
DATION. Gen. Wallace, the President of last
summer's board of visitors to West
Point, has just made his report,
in which he embodies some quite note
worthy recommendations. The prin
cipal one is to abolish the present sys
tem of appointing cadets, and to make
all private soldiers in the army possi
ble students in the Military Acad
emy. The enlisted men, instead of
doing the work of drudgery and of
servants about the posts and camps,
as they now do, are to be instructed
by the otllcers at the posts where they
are stationed in the same branches
that are now taught at West Point.
When the privates have made a cer
tain proficiency in their studies, they
shall be eligible for admission to the
Military Academy, graduating from
which they are entitled to commis
sions as officers of the army in short,
are on the final rung of the ladder
that leads to the top rank.
The plan has no end of arguments
in its favor, the chief of which is that
it would make enlistment sought
after as the opening doorway to an
honorable career instead of, as now,
the last refuge of a man at the bottom
of his luck. It would at once infinitely
raise the grade of the rank and file,
and fill our regular army with a class
of men full of zeal and ambition in an
occupation which, now' to most of
them a badge of degradation, would
bo the opening to a life career as hon
orable, as it would be crowded with
the loftiest hopes and aspirations.
While there would doubtless be many
difficulties to overcome in perfecting
such a system, there is so much to be
said in its favor that congress ought
not to be excused for failure to give it
a careful consideration.
The argument of the Republican,
that because Governor Toole and the
other state officers of Montana hold
their offices by virtue of a certificate
of election from the state returning
board, therefore the members of the
legislature must have certificates from
the same body, does not cover the
case. The returning board was the
creation of the enabling act, under
which Montana adopted a state con
stitution and prospectively elected
state officers, to serve it. case the con
stitution was adopted, and the Presi
dent's proclamation admitted the state
into the union. Put the members of
the legislature were elected under the
territorial apportionment and pur
suant to the territorial laws. If the
constitution had failed of adoption
the state officers elected would have
been fundus officio out of a job, but
the legislature would have remained
all the same, as a territorial legisla
ture. That is the difference. See?
The New York Sun, always a high
tariff organ, though pretending to
Democratic proclivities, had an edi
torial a few days ago, a column and a
half In length and apparently Inspired
from high tariff quarters, outlining
the changes to be proposed in silver
legislation in Mr. Window's forthcom
ing treasury report, and arguing from
these that not the tariff, but the sil
ver is destined to become the all ab
sorbing topic in the next congress, and
going down from these, in the next
campaign before the people. Undoubt
edly that is what the high tariff ad
vocates are longing for, as they are
afraid of another anti-taxatton cam
paign; but the silver business is very
nearly right as It is, and no great
amount of political capital can be
hoped for from an attempt at its se
rious disturbance.

When the presiding genius of the
local newspaper down at Ringgold, in
Georgia, made himself a nuisance by
gratuitous indiscriminate abuse "of
citizens of the town, the people held a
public meeting and denounced him as
"a villian of niastodonic parts and a
falsifier of wonderful willingness, only
lacking the sense and tact to become a
liar of note and distinction," and they
advised him to "git" or he would hear
from them again. Hut Georgia, you
know, is in the semi-barbarous south.
Around here, now, when a blackguard
editor, by indiscriminate abuse of good
citizens, makes himself a nuisance,
people (that is, some people) deprecat

his paper and inviting him into decent

It is a singular and notable fact
about tho great fire which visited

ruins of that conflagration. After all,
are there such things as fire-proof
buildings? It only needs a Are hot
