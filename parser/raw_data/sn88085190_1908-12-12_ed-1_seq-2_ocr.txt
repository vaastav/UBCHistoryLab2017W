ties have voted on the proposition,
49 of them voting out 1,706 saloons.

The cost of taking the next census,
as estimated by Director North in his
annual report, will be $12,930,000
The director points with pride to the
fact that this sum is but $410,000 more
than the cost of the last census. The
increase heretofore from decade to de
cade has been about 50 per cent. The
enormous saving lie attributes to the
existence of a permanent census bureau
and institution of the bureau's own
tabulating machines.
NEWSPAPERS APPLAUD
AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN
Tokyo, Dec. 5. —Following the pub
lication of the official text of the notes
which were exchanged during the week
by the Japanese and American govern
ments, the newspapers generally ap
plaud their contents, but considerable
criticism is made, especially by the op
position organs.
The general tone of comment is
highly gratifying, but the opposition
organs are using the occasion to attack
the government on the ground that
what is called the conclusion of the
note gives Japan no advantage. On
the other hand the most responsible
papers and statesmen enthusiastically
applaud the agreement and say it is a
great diplomatic step.

which such land has heretofore been
sold by the government.

CONGRESS IN
SESSION
BOTH HOUSES MET MON
DAY BUT DID NO
BUSINESS.
Adjourned Out of Respect to De
parted Members—Probable Leg
islation For the Session Out
lined—Leaders Will Put Over
Everything they Can.
Washington, Dec. 7, —At noon both
houses of congress convened for the
second session of the Sixtieth congress.
Vice President Fairbanks presided in
the senate and Speaker Cannon in the
house.
In the senate ex-Gov. Cummins, of
lowa, took the oath of office as succes
sor to Senator Allison, of that state,
and Carroll S. Page, of Vermont as the
successor of Senator Stewart.
In the iiouse seven members elected
in November to fill vacancies were also
sworn in. They are Henry A. Barn
hart, Democrat, who succeeds the late
Mr. Brick, Republican, Thirteenth In
diana district; Albert Estopinal, Dem
ocrat, who succeeds the late Mr. Mey
ers, .First Louisiana district; Otto G.
Foelker, Republican, successor to Mr.
Dunwell, Republican, Third New York
district; Frank E. Guernsey, Republi
can, successor to Mr. Powers, Republ
ican, Fourth Maine dsitrict; Eben M.
Masters, Republican, successor to Mr.
Parker, Republican, South Dakota at
large; O. C. Wiley, Democrat, succes
sor to A. A. Wiley, Democrat, Second
Alabama district, and John P. Swazey,
Republican, successor to Mr Little
field, Second Maine district.
First Business
The two houses appointed commit
tees each to notify the other house and
the president that congress is organ
ized for business. The senate then ad
journed for the day out of respect to
the memory of the late Senator Alli
son. The house also terminated its
brief session with resolutions com
memorative of the lives of Messrs. Par
ker, of South Dakota; Wiley, of Ala
bama; Dunwell, of New York, and
Powers, of Maine.
Tuesday will be given up to the read
ing of the president's message. As this
is President Roosevelt's last annual
message, there is unusual interest in it.
The house will likely begin business
Wednesday by considering the bill pro
viding for the taking of the thriteenth
census. It is the expectation of Mr.
Tawney, chairman of the committee
on appropriations, that his committee
will be able to report the bill making
appropriations for the legislative, ex
ecutive and judicial branches of the
government before the end of the week
and its consideration will be begun at
the first practical moment.
Postal Savings Banks
The senate has agreed to take up the
bill for the establishment of postal say-
ings banks, and Senator Foraker's bill
authoriizng re-enlistment of the negro
soldiers who were discharged on ac
count of the Brownsville riot of 1906.
Party leaders expect that very little
legislation other than the appropria
tion bills will be attempted. There
will be a general effort to hold the ap
propriations down to the lowest possi
ble level, but they will be large at best.
The fact that the managers desire to
restrict legislation will not prevent
other members of the senate and house
from exerting their efforts in behalf of
favorite measures.
The recent agreement between the
United States and Japan will be con
sidered by the senate early. Already
a number of senators have privately
epxressed disapproval of the fact that
the compact was made without consult
ing the senate.
Both houses will receive recommen
dations from the congressional mone
tary commission looking to changes in
the laws regulating the supervision of
national banks, and legislation for that
purpose is likely to be enacted. Agita
tion is made for such changes in the
Sherman anti-trust law as will provide
immunity for combinations, such as
labor unions, which have been held in
restraint of trade and which, it is con
tended, are not injurious.
The advocates of separate statehood
for Arizona and New Mexico will press
the claims of these territories and de
clare they will have the support of the
president. There will, however, be an
effort to pass these measures over to
the Sixty-first congress.
The president will recommend legis
lation looking to the supervision of tel
egraph and telephone lines, and there
will be bills offered bringing them
within the jurisdiction of the interstate
commerce commission.
Ship Subsidy
Ship subsidy will also receive atten
tion.
The revenue deefiit is giving the lead
ers much concern and many would be
delighted if some relief method could
be devised, but this subject is so inter
woven with the tariff that it seems
probable its consideration will be de
ferred until the extra session.
In the house the question of the
change of the rules will be much dis
cussed by individual members, but its
consideration will go over until after
the organization of the next house.
It is understood that early in Janu
ary the president will send in a special
message recommending the protection
and conservation of the country's nat
ural resources, and doubtless there will
be some effort made to respond to his
suggestion. There also will be a re
newal of the effort to create forest re
serves in the Appalachian and White
mountains.
GARDINER ADVISES CHANGE IN
RULES OF NATIONAL HOUSE
Washington, Dec. 5. —Representa-
tive Gardiner, of Massachusetts, after
a call on the president, gave out the
following statement of his stand on
the speakership situation:
"I shall not decide how to vote on
the speakership until I know the names
of the candidates.
"Personally I am more interested
in a change in the rules than a change
in the speakership. If we members
of the house continue to adopt rules
abandoning our power and shifting our
responsibility on the speaker's should
ers we must not go back to our constit
uents and cry because he exercises
that power, while we cheerfully leave
him to bear all the responsibility.
"Heretofore the rules have been pre
scribed by the majority in the party
caucus; in other words by a majroity
of the majority, and the motive power
has been supplied by a still smaller
subdivision of the house. The time
has now come when those of us who
are dissatisfied must do one of three
things—either carry the party caucus,
refuse to caucus on rules or shut up. I
believe that our best chance lies in the
second line of procedure.''
COLVILLE RESERVATION
TO BE ALLOTTED IN 1909
Washington, Dec. s.—The dimin
ished Colville Indian reservation, com
prising 13,00,000 acres which is to be
allotted under the homestead law after
proper survey and classicfiation, is the
subject of the following remark in the
annual report of the commissioner of
Indian affairs:
"During this last year a survey of
the reservation lias been made, of
which the field work is complete, and
the plats are now undergoing examina
tion by the general land office. The
work of alloting will be taken up dur
ing the present fiscal year and will be
well under way by the summer of
1909.
"There are about 2,452 Indians to
be allotted."
The commissioner speaks highly of
the Makah Indians, adding that an
alloting agent was instructed to allot
ten acres of old reservationt to each
Indian The alotment has been fin
ished. The allotments on Quinault
reservation are nearly finished. On
the Spokane reservation 501 allotments
have been made and it is believed that
the work will be completed by the end
of December.
COMPULSORY VACCINATION
UPHELD BY SEATTLE COURT
Seattle, Dec. s.—The right of the
legislature to pass and of the school
board to enforce a compulsory vaccina
tion law has been upheld by Judge
Morris in the hearing in the superior
court of the application of J. Clinton
McFadden for an injunction restrain
ing the Seattle school board from pre
venting the son of the petitioner from
attending school so long as he re
mained unvaccinated. The question of
the validity of the law was raised by
the attorneys for the petitioner not
only on the ground of unconstitution-
ality, but through an alleged defect in
the title of the act defining the powers
of a school board. The court decided
that the alleged defect was not suffi
cient to invalidate the law.
In rendering the opinion, the court
stated that the parents of a child, or
the child who refused to vaccinate,
could not be penalized under the pro
visions of the compulsory education
law, as non-attendance at school would
come through a statutory cause, and
not through a wanton refusal to obey
the law requiring attendance.
PRESIDENT CREATES TWO
NEW NATIONAL FORESTS
Washington, Dec. s—President Roos
evelt has signed procalmations creat
ing the Ocala national forest in Marion
county, Florida and the Dakota na
tional forest in Billings county, North
Dakota. These two states have thus
been added to nineteen other states and
the territory of Alaska, wherein land
is under scientific forest administration.
The Florida forest, the first to be set
aside by the government east of the
Mississipi river, has an area of 201,780
acres, one fourth of which has been
taken up under various land laws, and
is well adapted to the production of
forest growth.
The Dakota forest consists of 14,050
acres, and its creation is important as
it opens an experimental field in a state
having only 1 per cent of tree growth.
TACOMA AND G. N.
AGREE ON FRANCHISE
Tacoma, Dec. B.—The franchise
committee of the city council and the
Great Northern railway representa
tives got together last evening on mat
ters relative to the entrance of that
railroad into the city.
By the terms of the agreement the
city gives the road a triangular piece
of tide fiats an acre in extent, which
the road wanted to complete its freight
depot site.
In return the road agrees to widen
Twenty-first street twenty feet and
gives property for a cross street from
Twenty-first to River street without
grade crossings. The road also agrees
to widen River street. The council
will probably ratify the agreement.
Reduced Postage to Germany
Berlin, Dec. s.—The United States
and Germany have arranged for a pos
tal rate on letters between the two
countries of 2 cents instead of the ex
isting rate of 5 cents. The new rate
will go into effect January 1.
THE BIG RED
APPLE
NATIONAL APPLE SHOW IS
OPENED AT SPO
KANE.
Exhibits Represent Greatest Cen
ters of Production—Spokane Is
Given Over to Spirit of Horti
cultural Event—College Girls
Serve Pies.
Spokane, Dec 7..—President Roose
velt touched a button in Washington,
a steam siren screeched at the central
fire station in Spokane this morning at
10:30, and the National Apple Show,
the first of its kind ever held in the
United States, was on. The blowing
of the siren was followed by the toot
ing of factory whistles, ringing of bells
and firing of cannon, and for five min
utes the pandemonium continued.
While President Roosevelt officially
gave the signal for the opening of the
show in the morning, the formal exer
cises were not held until afternoon.
Then the distinguished guests of the
city were driven to Festival hall, es
corted by the National Apple Show
band.
F. Carter Van Dissel, chairman of
the reception committee, introduced
Louis W. Hill, who is president of the
apple show to an audience of 1,500. In
a short address Mr. Hill pointed out
the possibilities of apple culture in the
state of Washington and briefly com
pared the growth of the apple industry
in this state with orange growing in
California. He suggested making the
apple show an annual event.
Gov. Mead Speaks
Gov. Mead followed Mr. Hill. He
said that in Washingotn, on account
of the intensively cultivated fruit
farms, President Roosevelt's inquiry
as to why the men of the country were
leaving the farms to settle in cities
was answered.
"In Wenatchee and Yakima, farms
are so close together that it is hard to
tell where the city ends and the farms
begin,'' said the governor.
"This answes the question that the
president has appointed a country life
commission to solve. In Washington
farmers may enjoy country life and yet
have all the advantages that life in the
city affords.
"The apple show is a great help to
the future development of the state,
and is bound to be productive of great
good. The state, in showing men how
to use waste land, is performing a mis
sion for the world. '
C. Herbert Moore, mayor of Spo
kane, reviewed the scope of the apple
show and stated its importance to the
people of the Northwest. He prophe
sied that in ten years the apple crop in
the state would be worth more than
the combined output of the lumber
mills, grain fields and mines.
Whole Town an Apple Show
The Spokane National Guard armory
and two adjoining streets, which have
been roofed over for the purpose, house
the apples on exhibition. The build
ings on their outer surface are wreath
ed with grapevines and evergreens,
and flags of all nations are hung from
the flagstaffs. Inside of the buildings,
flags and bunting hide the bare walls,
but apples are the chief decorations.
The apple show is not confined to
the main buildings, however, for near
ly every storekeeper in the city has an
apple exhibit of his own in his show
windows.
The Yakima and Wenatchee valleys
are the two great rivals at the exhibi
tion. Growers from North Yakima
have several cars of almost perfect
apples on show, and the smaller towns
in the valley, such as Prosser, Sunny
side, Mabton and others, are represent
ed with pretty and tastefully arranged
exhibits. Wenatchee has one of the
most original exhibitions at the show,
one carload of fancy apples, 630 boxes,
occupying a rack 108 feet long. The
wrapping on some of the fruit has been
removed so as to spell "Wenatchee"
in big red apples against a background
of white. Wenatchee growers and
apples occupy one of the booths, and
the feature that has been attracting
the most attention is a huge American
flag made of apples. Winesaps, Spitz
enbergs and other apples make up the
red stripes, the pale yellow of the
Winter Bananas serve as white stripes,
while stars cut in blue wrappers ex
pose enough of white apples to make
up the field of the flag.
Ingenuity in Displays
In every booth men have exercised
their ingenuity to make their displays
attractive. In the White Salmon val
ley booth a huge salmon made of Bell
flower apples floats in a sea of red ap
ples. The people about Lake Chelan
are after a prize and in an attractive
exhibit are shown four-tier Jonathan
apples grown without irrigation.
Brewster, the port of Okanogan coun
ty, is well represented and a quarter
box of yellow Bellflower apples, two
and a half tier pack, is the center of
attraction. Louis W. Hill stopped at
the booth long enough to marvel at
the size and coloring of the fruit and
asked that the apples be sent to him
after the show.
Seventeen young women, students
at the Washington state college, are
demonstrating in one corner of the
building how apples should be cooked.
Pies, better than mother makes, are
sold over the counter, and salads,
sauces, jams, desserts and apples cook-
Ed in every conceivable form a™ h ■
shown. -, **"*

OIL EARNINGS AIRED
Testimony Shows Profits of Standard
Reached 115 Per Cent.
New York, Dec. B.—Figures show
ingsome of the profits of the Standard
Oil Company yesterday became part of
the court record in the federal siut to
dissolve the Standard, when John D
Archbold resumed the stand for a brief
examination, and Henry Tilford, p res i.
dent of the Standard Oil Company of
California, testified at some length as
a witness for the defense
The government inquisitor on %.
ures submitted showed that the Conti
nental Company, a Standard subsidiary
in the Middle West, made profits of ] 15
per cent on its capitaliaztion of $300,'.
000, and that the Standard Oil Com
pany of Indiana, on a capitaliaztion of
$1,000,000, earned about $55,000,000
between 1899 and 1906. Counsel'for
the company declared the actual assets
of the company were greater than the
capitaliaztion, as the companies had
turned back large sums from earnings.
Counsel for the government sought
to prove by Mr. Tilford that in Cali
fornia and other Western states the
Standard had made contracts with com
petitors whereby it obtained all the oil
supply.
Referring to oil trade rate cutting iv
Colorado and elsewhere, Mr. Tilford
said the Standard never cut pries to
undersell its competitors, but lowered
rates to meet the reductions of its ri
vals.
THRONE APPROVES
PROGRAMME OF REFORM
Peking, Dec. 3.—An edict of am
netyhas been issued by the crown. It
approves the program of refrom al
ready announced, but does not other
wise define the policy of the new re
gime.
The matter of amnesty is treated in
twenty separate articles. Conventiona.
awards, etc., for long years of servicel
are promised, but amnesty for the ten
original crimes is denied.
To this list is added an eleventh
crime, namely, the harboring of rebels.
The insertion of this clause evidently
is a result of political conditions. "Re
formers formerly banished from the
empire will not benefit by the new de
cree.
FLEET NOT FOR THIS COAST
Roosevelt Has Little Regard for Hobson
and His Opinions.
Washington, Dec. 5. —Representa-
tive Smith called at the White Honse,
and on mentioning naval matters the
president intimated that he did not
wish the California delegation to em
barrass him by urging that the Atlantic
fleet be retained on the Pacific ocean.
He said that the plans for the future
movements of the fleets, ending in its
return to Hampton Roads, had been
fully worked out, and that they could
not be changed. This was in reply to
recent appeals in California for the re
tention of the fleet. Smith made a
jesting remark about Hobson and his
alarms, to which the president gave
one of his characteristic and impetuous
replies to the effect that he had small
regard for Hobson and his opinions.
BARGES MAY TAKE PLACE
OF WHARF AT WADDAH ISLAND
Washington, Dec. 5. —Since contrac
tors announced that it would be im
possibel to construct a government
wharf at Waddah island for the use
of the life saving tug Snohomish, oa
account of the existence of rock bot
tom at that point, the revenue service,
service, under both which the tug and
the wharf should operate, has been
busy considering plans to overcome the
difficulty.
Capt. Ross, chief of service, be
llieves that one or more barges capable
of holding a sufficient supply of coal
and stores for the Snohomish,and to be
anchored at the site of the proposed
wharf, would prove very satisfactory.
The Snohomish will leave for Puge*
Sound within a week and the voyage
will consume three months.
