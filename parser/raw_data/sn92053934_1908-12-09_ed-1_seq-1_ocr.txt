Washington, Dec. 9. An issue ol
government bonds for internal water
ways and if necessary to support con
servation of the country's national re
sources was publicly advocated jester
day by President Roosevelt and tacit
ly assented to by President-elect Taft.
The president-elect presided at the
joint meeting yesterday afternoon un
der national conservation commission
auspices at the Belasoo theater in this
city ' at which President Roosevelt
made the principal address.
Governor Chamberlain of Oregon
voiced what seemed the advanced
ground of the democratic party in ad
vocacy of federal jurisdiction, and an
audience which filled the theater and
which included Andrew Carnegie, John
Mitchell, senators congressmen, and
the governors of ; several states, ap
plauded every sentiment expressed
AildreMM of the Preftldent.
President Roosevelt declared no
service to the nation in time of peace
could be of greater worth than that of
the national conservation commission,
charged with protecting the country's
natural resources of forest, field and
mine. .
"It is the largest national task of
today," said the speaker in reviewing
the work begun by the governors last
May at their White house meeting.
Their declaration at that time, the
speaker said, "should hang on the wall
in every school." .
The president tbeji described the or
ganization of the national conservation
commission, "whose chief duty was to
prepare an inventory of the natural re
sources of our country." This inven
tory, or report, it was stated, would
be the basis of information to congress
from the president.
Depend on Public Spirit.
The commission was stated to con
sist of senators, representatives, mem
bers of executive departments and
public spirited private individuals, fa
miliar with particular resources. "It
is wholly without funds," continued
President Roosevelt, "and it has, there
fore, depended altogether on the pub
lic spirit of its members and the co
operation of the executive depart
ments at Washington and in the sev
eral states. Its results will rank as
by far the most useful statement of
the national resources ever prepared
in any country."
River and Harbor ConRre.
The president made special acknowl
edgement to national organizations
concerned with national resources.
"the great engineering societies," the
southern commercial congress, and
added:
A special word is due the national
rivers and harbors congress. It is the
one organization that is advocating a
waterway policy and not a waterway
project, and is national in its scope
Its work, being strictly national and
in no sense sectional, merits and
should receive the support of our cit
izens."
The president declared that water
ways had been neglected more than
any other natural resource. On this
score he said:
"Our waterways are deserted. The
people are ready for a change. Let
us have it, and at once If we can
pay the cost from current revenues
let us do so. If not, let us issue bonds
By either method, let us have the wa
terways, and that quickly. The plan
and the work can and should proceed
together. While the work we are sure
of is being done, the plan for the rest
can be prepared."
Meet With Governor.
Washington, D. C. Dec. 9. The
natiotial conservation commission to
day began a conference with the gov'
ernors of the different states, with the
probable result that some concrete
plan will be mapped out for the con
servation of the nation's natural re
sources. More than thirty states were
represented.
The conference was called to order
Chicago, Dec. 9. The much talked of
idvance in freight rates in the ten-lory
between the Mississippi river and
he Atlantic seaboard, which has
:aused so much agitation among the
:hippers, has again been postponed by
he railroads, according to W. C.
3rown, senior vice president of the
Vew York Central lines.
At a conference yesterday with FreC
W. Upham, president of the Illinois
Manufacturers' association. Brown said
-hat the roads had not 'yet finished
checking up the rates to ascertain
vhat changes they wish to make, and
hat it will be impossible to file new
'.ariffs with the interstate commerce
commission inside of two months at
least. He promised, furthermore, that
no general advance in rates will be
made without conferring beforehand
with the shippers.
ltoariN Not Heady to Confer.
When Upham called upon 'Brown at
the Annex yesterday and asked an ex
planation for the apparent disregard
of the shippers he was told that the
roads were not ready for a conference
because their plans had not yet been
determined and they were not In a
position to state their attitude in final
form. On his last visit to Chicago
Brown stated that the increase would
approximate 3 per cent and would
probably be made effective soon after
