if the present use of his naino
in Richmond in favor of the readjnst-
-era' candidate instead of n re
publican is by authority , nnd
old that Mnhonu waa helping the
movement. Arthur showed perfect
familiarity with Virginia politics , said
ho thought the republicans were
entitled to a senator and thought
'Mtthpne would support n republican
candidate. The committee sent a
special messenger to Richmond to con
voy the words of the president to Ma-
hone. Pauland Fulkoraon insist that the
logic of the recent campaign in Vir
ginia is tha * Lieutenant Goyernor-
Elt-ct John F. Lewis , republican , is
entitled to bi elected senator and that
iho consideration promised the repub
licans for joining the roadjiuters was
they should have the senator.

What Friction Ban * .
National Associated Prcm.
BOSTON , MASS. , December 8. A
curious and unexpected result of the
new system of gold transaction be
tween Boston banks has just come to
light. Until within three weeks the
Merchants' bank acted as repository
for all others nnd transactions were
carried on by means of certificates ,
but at that time the Merchants' bank
decided to refuse to longer assume the
risk of storing $7,000,000 of gold in
its vaults , ana as no other bank was
willing to undertake the task the ays-
iem was given up and all transactions
since have boon effected by carrying
coin from bank to bank. It has been
found that this transportation of coin
is gradually reducing its weight and
that if the practice is continued the
gold will within less than a month
cease to bo legal tender. It is found
that the average weekly depreciation
of the 87,000,000 is $30 , or at the
rate of $15,000 per year.

cage says I tnko withThun in regard ti (
this case. I don't know the man mid
the statement is false ! ! '
Mrs. Julin M. \ ilson , niece of
Abraham Ouitoau , " , who resides nt
Lendvillo , was the Brat ilnoss for the
prosecution. She staled lior mother
uovor showed nny aij ns of insanity ,
Quo of her sisters was operated on by
n mositiuriat in Ann Arbor , Michigan ,
and w.ia BO much nnd : r the iutluenco
that'nny ono could operate upon hor.
Thu witness could stop hur on the
Btreot by simply hold ng up her fin-
gers.
One of the jurors ( wio colored man )
complained of indisposition nt thm
point nnd retired to consult n physi
cian , ji
Witness continuing , said : Possi
bly some unmnnncwd boy called her
sister. "Foolish Abbey. She never
saw any irrational conduct on the
part of her mother up to thu timu of
the death. Ono of her Bisters wan in
nn insane asylum in Michigan. Her
father was nfllictod with softening of
the brain before ho died.
The pritoner wns unusually quiet
during this\testimony , only interrupt
ing Judge Porter once when ho was
referred to tat a criminal "that word
does not apply to mo ; I am no crim
inal. I was inspired by God to re
move President Oarfiold. "
During the cross1 examination by
Scovillo , the witness said she did not
remember that her mother had any
objection to going lip'stnira during thu
latter part of her lifoj
John W. Quitoau objected to "lug-
ing in persons" who Had no blood re
lation to the prisoner
Scoville-Bald'ho-ob ictod fitronuoua-
ly to John W. CJuitoau interrupting
the proceeding with a view to nho\v
there waa no insanity.
The prisoner got excited , and jump
ing up and pounding the table , exclaimed -
claimed : " 1 take thu same view. I
wish John W. Guitoan would go back
to Boston. Ho haw entered into this
case to gain a little notoriety. lie
has been a nnisnnco during the whole
trial. Ho in not of the counsel and
has no business to open his head here.
Ho presumes on the fact Unit ho in ot
the same name to make liiiiiHelf con
spicuous hero. "
The prisoner's brother paid no at
tention to his harangue.
Geo. G. Maynard testified ho had
known the family of the iirovious
witness for yours and had never
heard of nny member being insane
Recess.
After recosa , Prank Bartlett testi
fied ho knew l\lr. n"d Mrs. Scovillu
and the prisoner.
Prisoner The only thing about
this is the witness met ma in the uum-
mer of 1870 at .Scovillo's place , It
cost the government two hundred
dollars to bring this witnosn hero and
itia an outr.igo for thu public funds to
be expended in thin manner.
The witness said there vviw nothing
in the prisoner B manner to attract
special attention. The prisoner tottk
part in a tub race and conducted him
self as umioly ns the other partim engaged -
gaged in this recreation.
Florence II. Bartlett , wife of the
1'iRt witness , said there was nothing in
Uniteau's notion or demeanor to indi
cate ho was insane.
Howard 0. Dunham , of Boston ,
was called.
"Thm man doesn't know much
about me , " interrupted the primmer.
"Ho thought I was badly cranked
about my book. Ho looked upon it
aa a literary curiosity "
Witness told about the prisoner
engaging an oflice in BoHton , stating
ho would abandon theology lie got
out curds announcing himself as
"Counsellor and attorney at law. "
Theology , the prisoner said to him ,
didn't pay.
Gcoville objected to evidence being
introduced at this ntago an to thu
sanity or insanity of the prisoner ,
and claimed such testimony should
have introduced in the chief exami
nation.
The court overruled the objection ,
saying it is not worth while to go into
particulars.
Scovillu Then I.would like an excep
tion entered to any testimony offered
on the part of the prosecution tending
to uhow the insanity of the prisoner.
The witness did not regard thu
prisoner insane ,
Prisoner The witness was a Meth
odist minister and ho did not like my-
theology. Besides I hnd no money
and ho didn't ' like my style. [ Laugh
ter. ]
Witness , continuingad , | ! ho had a
con vernal ion with John W. Guitcnu ,
who remarked there was no wall au
thenticated case of insanity in thu
Guiteau family.

Corkhill presented a communication
from President Arther in answer to
interrogations of the defence. Thn
document was not road but submitted
to Scuvillo for examination.
John Farmer , of Saratoga Springs ,
wan the nrxt witness. Before ho wan
questioned the prisoner snid , "I ewe
this man ton dollars for board. It
cost the government one hundred dollars
lars to bring him here. I might have
admitted this fact and spared this ex
pense to the nation. "
Witness related the difficulty ho
had in collecting a board bill I rum the
prisoner.
Meantime Guitcnu had road Presi
dent Arthur's answers to Scovillo'n
questions nnd declared in nn emphatic
manner they should be publiiihed at
once. The document wai then road
by Senvillo. The first question w < w
"Do jou know the prisoner in the
"
President Arthur answered in the
nfliimntivo. I lo had seen him tun or
probably twenty times urouml the re
publican headquarters nt the Fifth
Avenue hotel in Now York , but had
no conversation with him except in
ordinary salutations of the day.
"What political service did the
privmor render the republican parly
during the last campaign ? " Wiw the
no A ( interrogation.
"None that I know of , " the preni-
dent wrote in response , "and I do not
know that there was anything in his
relations to myself , General Grant or
Senator Conkling that would entitle
him to believe w would assist him in
bin political prelorompiit. "
PrisonerThat is n matter of
opinion.
The president added by way of
postscript that ho hud received n hit
ter from the prisoner , asking for n
postponement of the trial , in order
to allow him to prepare bin defense.
Rov. It. 8. Me Arthur , pastor of the
Baptist church of Now York , was
then called. Ho testified that the
prisoner brought a hater of admission
to him from thu Chicago church.
Gnitoau complained of poverty , re-
suiting from thu Chicngo fire , and
witness' heart went out towards him
and ho loaned him ninety-live dollars.
There was nothing in the prisoner's
manner to indicate insanity. Ho explained -
plained thu prisoner's wife represent
ed to him that herself nnd husband
would bu placed on the Ride-walk if
they could not raisu a little money ,
The pri.sonur wns expecting to got a
ministry nt that timo. It was the
Swiss mission. It was expected
that , however , it did , not amount
to much , it wnH only § 5,000 n year.
Witness then stated that thepnsoner
was brought up before the committee
ef the church in regard to certain
immoral conduct. His wife claimed
she supplied him with money which
he spent witn other women.
The prisoner again bccamo excited ,
stating that hia conduct in this regard
was prompted by his deairo to procure
sufficient grounds fur n divorce froii
theAvoman whom ho mftrricd on'toi '
hours' notice.
Corkhill said the government in
tended to show that what was claimed
to bo insanity on the part of the pris
oner wan nothing hut outrageous ( le
pmvity.
Thin remark was loudly applauded
by the aiuhoneo and a young man whc
ntnrtcd tlio demonstration was put out
