nanies and all their officials, says ino
RaUway Record. While he reminded
congress of its failure at Its last session
to pass into law all the recommenda
tion, contained in his ng
vear ago. he refrained from urging
Intm proceed further in the matter
thi time. He pointed out very
cleariy thS Buffioient time had not yet
.lapsed to test the benef IU .and uUUUes
of the amendments to the interstati
commerce act which congress at its last
session had adopted, and In his ovtidon
th Interests of all the people of the
country will be promoted by allowing
things to rest as they are until It has
been determined what further changes,
if any, are necessary to be made.
This Is in direct line with the views
which have been expressed by a great
many prominent railway officials since
the adjournment of the last session of
congress. They have lost no opportun
ity of pointing out that one of the
things most needed to restore con
fidence In the future prosperity of the
railways of the United States is to give
them an opportunity of accomodating
themselves to the requirements of the
new law in all Its details, and to de
termine what effect the enforcement of
the law as it now stanas is buiu v
have on the revenues of the com
panies. What railway managers have
most feared is more legislative Interfer
ence They have certainly had enough
of it to last them for a good many
years, and they must have heaved a
big sigh of relief when they read that
part of the president's message recom
lng a cessation of legislative interfer
ence in the management of their af
fairs. .,
Another point in the president s mes
sage which must have afforded railway
managers, in common with all corpo
rate Interests considerable satisfaction
was to be found in its closing words
wherein he said: "I believe it to be In
the interest of all the people of the
country that for the time being the
activities of the government, in addi
tion to enforcing the existing law, be
directed toward the economy of ad
ministration and the enlargement of
opportunities for foreign trade, the
conservation and improvement of our
agricultural lands, the building up of
home industries and the strengthening
of confidence of capital in domestic
Investments." The last phrase of this
concluding sentence of the presidential
message is especially significant. There
can be no doubt that the confidence of
crpital in domestic investments has
been rudely shaken by the policy pur
sued by the government In the last
three years. That policy has been
pretty generally, if not universally con
sidered by capital as a direct attack on
the investments already made by it in
domestic enterprises of one kind or an
other, and it must be exceedingly grati
fying to it to be afforded this oppor
tunity for hope that there Is to be some
cessation at least to the persistent at
tacks made upon it b- the governing
powers of the country.
It is to be hoped, however, that the
president will not remain satisfied with.
furnishing some grounas ior tms nope
tn his annual message, but that he will
go further and see to It that the invest
ments already made by capital In these
domestic enterprises is afforded oppor
tunity to earn for itself reasonable re
turns on the investments already made.
There can be no more certain way
adopted by President Taft and the ad
ministratlve officers who are subject to
his directions of strengthening confi
dence of capital in the greatest of all
domestic investments than by making
it known with the least possible delay
that the railway companies of the
co-.ntry will be permitted to make thi
increase in freight rates of which they
have given notice The probabilities
are exceedingly strong that such an
announcement would be followed inv
mediately by such an increase in all
kinds of business activity as would
demonstrate to everybody concerned
that the restoration of confidence on
the part of capital has been accom
plished.
It is evident that President Taft
sees that the continuance of his own
administration after the expiration of
his present term of office Is entirely
dependent upon the restoration of
confidence of capital. No administra
tion in this country can survive a pro
longed period or general depression.
and it la evident that President Taft is
shrewd enough to admit to himself at
least that such is the fact. If he is to
enjoy a second term in the White
. House, as president of the United
Etates, it can only be by bringing about
such a restoration of prosperity as will
make the people of all sections of the
country happy and "contented. The
prevalence of general prosperity Is
wholly dependent upon railway Droe
perity. General prosperity has never
yet prevailed while the affairs of the
railways nave been suffering from se
vera and prolonged depression. The
scrofulous conditions, ulcers, "fever-sores," white swellings, etc., by taking
Dr. Pierce's Discovery. Just the refreshing and vitalizing tonio needed for
excessive tissue waste, in convalescence from fevers or for run-down, anemic,
thin-blooded people. Stick to this safe and sane remedy and refuse all " just
as good " kinds offered by the dealer who is looking for a larger pro6t. Noth
ing will do you half much good as Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery.
fact is the condition of the railways
may always be taken as the most re
liable barometer of the general busi
ness interests of the country.
There are those who are decidedly
of opinion that the closing words of
President Taft's message, which al
ready have been quoted, may be taken,
as a direct assurance that the railway
companies will get the advance In rates
which they have been seeking, and
with that advance there will at once
come a period of restored activity such
as Is desired by the president and all
who wish for a continuance of his
administration through a second term.
It is earnestly to be hoped - that the
holders of this opinion are not too
eangulne regarding the meaning which
is to be attached to the president s re
marks, and that the country will not
be kept any longer than Is absolutely
necessary In doubt regarding what the
decision of the interstate commerce
commission is to be concerning the ad
vances in rates of which the railways
have given notice.
The waiting policy which is now be
ing pursued Is not calculated to re
store' public confidence in any degree.
On the contrary, the longer a decision
is delayed the more pronounced the
existing depression is certain to be
come, and the more difficult will It be
eventually to recover from it. Popu
lar opinion has very largely adopted
the view that the increase will be
granted. Even the opponents of that
advance have prepared themselves for
submission to such a decision. Ship
ping Interests which have been most
bitter in their antagonism to the ad
vance being allowed are pretty well
satisfied in their own minds that they
have utterly failed to present such a
case as would warrant the Interstate
commerce commission in refusing to
permit the advance. It is safe to as
sume that many of them have become
aware of the mistake that was made
hi the first instance In starting the op
position, and should the results of the
advance be such as Is generally sup
posed, no one will have more reasim
to rejoice at their own defeat than
these same opponents.
MUTRimAD MAKES TXQTJTRT.
Visits Hutchinson In Interests of Bet
ter Railroad Service.
Hutchinson, Kan., Dec. 17. William
Muirhead. assistant to John Dawson,
the attorney for the railroad board, is
in Hutchinson in search of information
regarding the operating of trains from
McPherson to Hutchinson over tne
Rock Island lines. He is being as
sisted by J. U. Brown, a member of
the committee representing the Com
merclal club in the fight to force the
Union Pacific to run trains to Hutch
inson if Dosslble.
Messrs. Muirhead ana Brown in
spected the records with the avowed
view of voting bonds and subscribing
stock to the McPherson, Texas & Gulf
system and the Hutchinson, Oklahoma
& Gulf system In 1889. They nave
secured considerable information, but
have failed to find the agreement that
caused the Union Pacific to begin
operating trains to Hutchinson a num
ber of years ago. If this Information
can be found it is quite likely that
this matter can be settled within
short time.
Mr. Muirhead asserted that if the
attorney general finds any agreement
that can be used in requiring tne
Union Pacific to run trains from Mc
Pherson to Hutchinson and return
that he would require tha railroad
companv to comply with It. Mr. Muir
head will be in Hutchinson today, after
which he will leave In search of other
Information.
He has conferred with the traffic of
ficials of the Rock Island and Union
Pacific companies and !s how In search
of Information. He. will examine the
records of McPherson and other coun
ties involved and interview the county
officers that can be located who are fa
miliar with the facts.
PLEASED WITH WICHITA YARDS
Division Superintendent of Rock
Island Makes Inspection.
Wichita. Kan.. Dec. 17. G. W.
Rourke, division superintendent of the
Rock Island, with headquarters at
Herington, Was in the city for the pur
pose of inspecting the company's new
freight yards and terminal facilities at
Twenty-fifth street. He spent several
hours at the new yards and expressed
himself as well pleased with the prog
ress ot the building.
Several of the tracks In the new
yards are already in use for storage
purposes. There are six of these, each
4,200 feet long. Within a few weeks
they will be used as the general yards
for the city.
The roundhouse is almost finished
and will be ready for use by the time
all other facilities are ready for use.
The work on the oil tanks, coal chutes
and water tanks is progressing nicely.
A private telephone line connectingthe
yards with the freight house down
town is under construction.
"We expect to move the" telegraph
operators to the new yards about the
first of the year." said R. E. Greene,
local agent for the Rock Island. "By
that time things will be in readiness
for us to handle the bulk, of our
freight business there."
BAKER PUSHES RAIL PROJECT.
University Plans Electric Line From
Baldwin to Kansas City.
Ottawa, Kan., Deo. 17. Baker uni
versity would become an electric rail
way magnate. The authorities of the
college, headed by Dr. L. H. Murlin,
president, have decided that an elec
tric line from Baldwin to Kansas City
would be a good thing, and they are
perfecting plans for the organization
of a company to back such a project.
The trustees at a meeting discussed
the proposition and adopted a resolu
tion that such a connection be made.
The plan is to build an electric line
from Baldwin to Olathe to connect
with the Strang electric line to Kan
sas City.
According to' the plans, the electric
line would be brought within twelve

IOWA TO HAVE DAIRY TRAIN.
The Illinois Central Will Furnish One
In January .
Sioux City, la., Dec. 17. Through
the. courtesy of the Illinois Central the
Iowa Dairy association will operate a
dairy train through northern and
western Iowa In January. On the. train
will be a baggage car fitted into a
modern home for dairy cows, with
patent stalls, stanchions and other
equipments.
Efforts now are being made by the
management to obtain the most excel
lent specimens of the dairy breeds to
use In demonstrating at the different
stops, the points to be observed in se
lecting profitable cows and good sires
to place at the head of herds. These
animals will i,s taken from their stalls
at each stop and a regular dairy show
on a small scale will be held. . i
A train was ran over the Burling
ton railroad in southern Iowa last year
and 105 stops made. At each stop,
where the audience numbered from
200 to 1,500, a cow demonstration was
given, excellent specimens of the dairy
breed being used to illustrate the es
sential points that should be observed
in selecting dairy cows for profit and
dairy bulls for the purpose of build
ing up the herd to a more productive
basis. Lectures also were given, as
will be done on the Illinois Central
train that comes to Sioux City, on
silos and silage, testing dairy cows to
dtermlne the productive and nonpro
ductive ones, and to illustrate these
lectures miniature silos. Babcock test
ers, scales, etc., were used.
WHERE CLARK STANDS.
Prospective Speaker Defines His Po
sition on Important Questions.
Washington, Dec. 17. Representa
tive Champ- Clark issued a statement
tonight fully outlining bis platform as
the prospective speaker of the Demo
cratic house of representatives in the
next congress. He proclaims himself
In favor of the appointment of com
mittees of the house by a committee,
rather than by the speaker; and he
states his belief that the tariff should
be revised schedule by schedule, rath
er than In one single bllL Those two
subjects, says Mr. Clark, are the ones
upon which he has been continually
importuned to make some statement.
"There are two theories of tariff re
vision," says Mr. Clark in his state
ment; "revision by one general , bill.
and revision by separate bills for sep
arate schedules. This is a matter not
of principle, but of method.
"Individually, I prefer the scheme
of separate bills for separate schedules
taking the schedules with the most
obnoxious features first, perhaps in
certain cases having separate bills for
particular items."
The statement proceeds to flay that
whatever method Is decided upon, full
hearing, as comprehensive as that
which preceded the framing of the
Payne-Aldrich law, will be had by .the
new ways and means committee.
"The assumption growing out of ig
norance in certain quarters," says Mr,
Clark, "that President Taft or Sena
tor Cummins, or any other Republican
has discovered something new In tar
iff revision by the separate schedule
scheme, is preposterous. As far back
as the fifty-eecond congress, Mr.
Chairman Springer introduces sepa
rate bills for separate schedulesv-and
even for particular items, which were
derisively denominated. "Springer's
pop gun bills, by ribald Republican
speakers and writers; and several
years before Judge Springer was chair
man of tne committee on ways and
means, Mr. McKenzie, of Kentucky,
achieved both great renown and the
sobriquet of 'quinine Jim' by securing
the passage of a bill putting quinine
on the free list, and touching no other
item whatever in any tariff schedule.
Two questions, Mr. Clark says, in
terest the country; how the Democrats
will select their committees and what
the party will do with the tariff. This
last question has been answered, and
proceeding to the first, he says:
"As to the mode of selecting com
mittees In the event of my own elec
tion to the speakership, I would not
care the snap of my finger to exercise
the power of appointing them. I have
stated that to every Democratic mem
ber who cared to inquire my opinion.
The exercise of that power would un
doubtedly have certain unpleasant fea
tures. '
Of the two plans for the election of
committees, by the Democratic caucus
or directly by the house itself, Mr.
Clark favors the last named. This is
based on the fact that in the debatable
states the independent voters appear
to favor it and the future speaker of
the house frankly acknowledges that
it may be adopted because of the In
fluence it would have in returning a
Democratic president and a Democrat
ic congress in 1912.

KATZ F0R THIRD.

Lad at Last Corner.
Young in Professional Ranks
Has Won Attention.
HITS THEM A MILE.
Got 8 Homers, 8 Triples, 21
Doubles in Season.
Bought and Sold by Columbus
Last Season.
The worry of the baseball fans over
the third base vacancy on the Topeka
club will be eased by the announce
ment of Manager Fred Moore that he
has signed Henry Katz, a rising third
sacker of St. Louis.
Henry Eatz, Signed to Play Third tor
xopeka.
With a corps of seven pitchers anfll
two catchers enlisted for the spring
workout, the ever present problem of
the third corner loomed before the fans
once more. The vacancy at the Initial
corner is passed by the bugs in the
belief that any good old scout can play
first. , Whether Kats can fill the bill
is a matter to be determined. Moore
thinks he is a good man.
He was good enough to hang some
time on the Columbus team in the
American Association last spring, his
second season in tie professional ranks,
but was dropped to the Akron, O., club
where he finished the season.
Katz made his professional debut with
the Pittsburg club in the Western As
sociation in 1909. Out of a schedule of
126 games he missed but two, gather
lng a total of 125 hits for a percentage
of .263. In this bunch oi Dingies. ne
counted 40 for extra bases, eight being
homers, eight triples and 24 doubles. He
covered his sack for an average oi ai
The following spring, that of 1910, he
was bought by Columbus but failed to
stick to the classy company and was
sold to Akron.
Hard luck came in a bunch. In the
third game he was injured sliding into
the plate and was kept oft the field for
three weeks, wnen ne got out again
he was spiked at third and laid up for
n. month. In spite oi tnese disasters,
Katz got Into 51 games, hit .240 and
fielded .870.
Being a comer aa his record seems
to Indicate, it is not unlikely that In
Katz Moore has landed a man who will
show to good advantage with the To

race next spring.

A fourth outfield tryout has been pro
