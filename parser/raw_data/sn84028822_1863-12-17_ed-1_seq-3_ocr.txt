Too Bad.
On Sunday night last, Rev. Mowm mado a
prayer at tho M . E, Church and neglected to offer
a single petition iu behalf of the, nigger. This
was too bad, when wo remember that the Rev.
gentleman was paid ?35 by tho abolitionists of
tliis place for his nigger lecture on Thanksgiving
day. And it seems the more unpardonable when
wo recollect that Mr. M. but recently assured his
congregation that tho African was made in the

Assault and Battery.
Au interesting trial tookplaco before Esq". Jos
tick on fast Friday evening. The caso was tho
State of Ohio vs. Win. Aibucklo and two negro
men, who committed au assault and battery upon
tho person of Francis DnunoT,of Saltcreok town
ship. The facts are briefly these, as furnished
to us by one who heard the testimony : Ar-
buckle, a man by the uamo of Geo. W. Hall and
tho two negroes were lcnJinz adrovo of horses.
the negroes in the advance! when' between Mid
dletown and Benton, in this county, tho negroes
meeting Druhot, who was walking, asked him if
ho had any bottle to which ho answered ho had
not. This brought on a dilliculty between the
two negroes and Druhot, when tho lattor mado h
slight effort to pull one of tho negroes off his
horso, Both negroes dismounted aud picked up
two stukes at the side of the road, and knocked
Druhot down, and kicked him several times
hile the two negroes were thus abusing Dru
hot ono of the white men said to tho.negrocs to
"kill him, God d m him." Druhot managed to
get up, aud then Arbucklo approached him and
knockcdhlm down. It was proved that Arbucklo
admitted that ho had knocked Druhot down, and
told tho negroes to pick up the stakes aud scare
Druhot, but that Druhot "would not scare worth
a damn."
Wurrants were issued for Arbuc'tlo and tho
two negroes nnd placed In tho hands of Sherllf
Nelson, who arrested Arbucklo; but the two ne
groes had made their escape.
After hearing tho evidence the Justice fined
Arbucklo f 5 nnd costs, In all ?25,fc0.
Tho negroes mado a practice of insulting wo
men as they passed along the road, and grossly
insulted sovcral women iu this place. Wo hopo
tho black scoundrels may yet bo caught.

nas, over tho Emancipation Proclamation
and tho Confiscation Act !
Such is, in biiof, tho pith and sub
stance of tho President's Message. Tho
intelligent readers of Tun l'utsii:it will of
coiiiso penibo it for themselves. Tho ha
tiou will nover, novor statul tho mon
strous usurpation which is now boldly
proclaimed a tho policy of tho present
administration. Tho Presidont dates lo
nssumo that all the people of tho South
ern States have committod ticasou, aud
are, thcroforo, objects of Exccutivo clem
ency. Docs ho not know that tho poo
plo can read '? And doos not tho Con
stitution plainly Miy that no poison bhall
bo doomed guilty ot treason oxcopt aftor
a fair trial by jury, in open court? Be
sides, does not thu Constitution plainly
say that thoso only aro guilty of troasou
who mako war on tho Uonititutional
government of thu United States ? Tho
verdict of history will read that Abra
hum Lincoln himself aud his political ad
visers, aro in that category, quito as much
as thoso who uro arrayed iu arms.
But what impudence it is in him to as
stimi! that all tho pooplo iu tho South aro
traitors, nuu to declare that they must
tako n tost oath befoio thoy can bo allow-
to voto or to oxorciso any of tho rights of
citizenship! No doubt ho thinks ho is
very smatt in saying that uo man is com
pelled to tako this oath. Yet his procla
mation shows that ho intends, so far as
his power oxtonds, that no citizen of tho
South shall ovor bo. allowed oven to voto
again until ho has taken this oath. Can
anything bo moro monstrous? Look, lor
u moment, at tho terms of the oath. Tho
owner of a plantation, whoso blaves havo
been taken from him by tho emancipation
proclamation, whoso crops luvo been loft
rotting iu tho ground, who sees poverty
and starvation blaring him iu thu face in
consequence., aud whoso daughter was ono
of thoso young ladies at tho bominary at
Athons, in Alabama, who woiObubjectod
to tho brutal lusts of Turchiu'a boldiors,
this unfortunate guutlemau is told that
ho may voto, and that ho shall havo a full
pardon ou tho abovo offenses ( what cruel
mockery 1), it ho will swear that ho op
proves, and is in favor of, tho emancipa
tion proclamation and tlio negro soldiers'
bill; and, if ho roftisos to swear, ho is to
bo regarded as a traitor, and all his ro
tnaining property is to bo confiscated.
Such, your readers will find, is tho plain
Kngliidi of tho moss ago of Abraham Lin
coln, formorly cook, or assistant cook,
for a mess of four honest soldiers in tho
Black Hawk war.
But still moro impudent is that feature
of tho mossago which assutnos to swoop
away all tho Stato Governments of all tho
Southern Sta.tcs by ubtnglo btroko of tho
pen. This relator of vulgar stories docs
not oven tako tho trouble to outer into au
argument to provo that tho Southern
Statos no longor oxist as States, aud of
course havo no lougor any Stato govern
montB. Oh, nol IIo says, virtually, 'Thut
has been so well done by tho letter of Mr.
Solicitor Whiting of tho Wat Depart
ment, and by Senator Sumnor in hi Ah
luntic Monthly article, that wo will cou
bider thoso points bottled. I refer my
discontented fellow citizens, aud my
traitorous subjects in Poland, I moan
iu Alabama, to those documents, Tho
old Slates an.l tlio old Stato governments
boing then so comfortably out of tho
way, it only remains to 'set up' a John

urd, of Delaware, novcr having taken tho

tlio last session, was informally reminded
of the fact by tho Vice-President to-day
and requested him to say whether he was
prepared to tako it, and ho icplicd in tho

ho will keep hi promise.
A Special Joint, Committco will prob
blybo appointed to consider what legis
lation is necessary to euablo tho loyal
pooplo of tho South to restore their States
to tho Union on tho.bosis of tho Ptcsi
dent' message und ' proclamation. To
this Committee probably will bo referred
tho bill now before Contrrosu ou tlio sub.
joct of slavery, and such Othor bills as
may bo introduced which bear upon gen
eral topics.
Tim Time's special says, tho Presidont
has yielded to tho demand of tho Loyal
Leaguo representatives. Gon. Schoficld
has been lomoved, aud ordorod to Wash
ington. Letters havo been received hero from
prominent consorvntivo members of tho
rebel Congress from North Carolina,
asking unofficially upon what terms tho
Southern Statos would bo pormittod to
roturn to tho Union.
Tho inundation of our army with po
litical Brigadier Generals has received
such protestations from Gront nnd Hook
or, that it is not only certain that tho
flood will bo stayed in futuro, hut that
Congress will correct many errors of tho
past in this regard.
Tho clerk of tho Military Committee,
llouso Librarian, aud beveral othor mi
nor officials at tho Capital aro suspectod
of sympathizing with secessionists, and
woro rolioved to-day.
It has recently come to tho knowlodgo
of tho Government that there aro along
the frontier of Canada, upward of ton
thousand deserters, most of them in a
biilTering condition, and aro anxious to
icttirn nnd join thoir regiments. It is
probable that a proclamation will short
ly bo issuod by tlio Presidont offering
pardou to all who will roturn to thoir
regiments within thirty days.
The $300 Clause in the Conseription
Act.
An attempt will bo mado at tho present
sosbion of (jongrcss to repeal tho thrco
hundred-dollar exemption clausoin tho
Conscription Act. Wo havo objocted to
that clauso for tho reason that it favored
tho rich at tho oxponso of tho poor: Wo
think it ought to bo ono hundred dollars,
or porhaps a smaller sum, that would
place it within tho roach of all. But wo
aro opposod to tho repeal, if tho object is
to liavo no commutation prico fixed at all.
If it can not bo reduced let the threo-hun-dred-dollar
clauso stand as it is. A re
peal of it absolutely would allow substi
tutes to fix any prico thoy chooso, and
would work most disastrously to tho
to tho people. All countries, even mon
archical, that havo conscription, fix a po
cuniaiy limit for substitutes, and if wo
Udojit their law wo ought to follow tooir
practice Wo hopo overy Democrat and
conservative moinhor wil voto ugainst tho
repeal of tho threo-liundrod-dollar clauso
if the proposition is not torcduco it. Tho
fact is, tho Administration, with tho sum
raised in money, can induce a lorgor until-
her of tho threo-yoar volunteers to ro-cnlist
than tho service's of tho consctipts thoy
thus would got by the repeal would bo
