THURSDAY. .** : , . . < DECEMBER 7, 1905
THE TROLLEY PROPOSITION,
BY an unfortunate error in making up the forms, only one side
of the discussion at the merchants' banquet was printed
in The Call yesterday by the omission of the able speech of Honl
Frank J. Sullivan. By way of rectification, we publish the speech' this
morning. There is no question of the wish of the people to substitute
electricity for the cable wherever feasible in our street railway sys
tem. Nor is there any doubt of the practically unanimous opposition
to the overhead trolley for that purpose. The overhead wire is a
passing- device for the application of electric power to street cars.
It represents the archaic period of electricity. It belongs ( on the "'
scrap heap with the original dynamos and primitive devices that be
long to the empirical stage of electric development. To permit it on.
the streets of San Francisco will be like returning to the old bobtail,
horse cars. It would put this city among the "ha% beens." \
The overhead wire is an obstruction in all. of its aspects.,, The
Sustaining posts are obstructive of access to the sidewalks. . The !
network of high power wires is not only an obstruction, but a dan
ger of the most serious nature. The trend everywhere is to -the
putting of all wires under ground. There the high power they carry,
if it escape, cannot endanger life, nor cause conflagrations. If the
plan were novel and. untried, objections to it might be heard with
patience. But it is not an experiment. It is a demonstration. The
very extensive electric" road system" of Washington City is run by
underground trolley, and so it must be here if electricity is to take
the place of the cable."* ' n \
The overhead trolley comes definitely under the head of public
nuisances, abatable by judicial process, and the people of San
Francisco should fight it by every legal resource within their reach.
The people are, not inimical to the United Railroads, but they will
not submit to a policy in the interest of that corporation which back
numbers the city and makes its streets dangerous and unsightly.
The Merchants* Association listened patiently and politely to the
proposition of the United Railroads, but its sympathies are with the
views expressed by Mr. Sullivan, "which The Call indorses in their
entirety.
THE MESSAGE.
THE President's message deals almost entirely with the domestic
and internal problems and affairs of the country. Its focus is
the railroad rate question. He somewhat clears the atmosphere
on that issue. Heretofore all of the opposition to his supposed views
has been based upon the statement, not. anywhere , made by him,
that it was his intention to empower the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to make all of the interstate railroad rates. Against this
many valid arguments have been made. The main strength oi the
opposition was found in the fact that it would be giving- to a purely
political body absolute power over transportation, and that the ad
vantage of this would finally swing to the section of the country
that had the greatest political influence. I
The President makes it plain that this view of his policy is
mistaken. He says : "In my judgment the most important provision
which such law should contain is that *conf erring upon some com
petent administrative body the power to decide, 1 upon the case being
brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is
reasonable arid just, and if it be found unreasonable and unjust, then,
after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate,
beyond which it shall not be lawful to go, this decision to go into
effect within a reasonable time and to obtain, from thence onvvard, :
subject to review by the courts."
This makes it- clear that whatever official body is to deal with
the question takes no jurisdiction over transportation rates, except
upon complaint against a specific rate established by a railroad, and
that it will hear evidence and decide upon the reasonableness of such
rate only. It will be observed that the President uses the "term "ad
ministrative body" in describing the official agency that shalltake
such jurisdiction. At that exact point appears the crux of the whole
question. It is desirable to relieve a complaining shipper of the op
pression of delay, and the cost of long, litigation. He is subject to
such dilatory' tactics as may be employed by the corporation of
which he complains, and with which he has joined issue. To avoid
this the President .proposes that the rate fixed by the administrative
body shall go into effect and continue in force, pending appeal to
the judicial courts. ; :
If the body which displaces the unreasonable rate with a rea
sonable rate were called a judicial body, it would be. plain to laymen
even that its judgments cannot be executed pending- appeal, for an
appeal would act as a stay of execution. /The whole Spirit "of. 'our
law, derived from the constitution itself, is that judicial judgment
is not enforcible until it is made a finality. If appealed, it cannot
be a finality until passed upon by the court of last* resort.- The
question therefore is, can the statutory style and title of an official
body as "administrative" give it the right to take jurisdiction, hear
evidence, render an appealable judgment, and execute the ; same
pending appeal? With that the courts will have to deal.' It is a
well Jj understood principle that the character of an official .body is
determined not by its title, but by the functions bestowed upon it
by laSv. The functions of the proposed administrative body are es
sentially and purely judicial. They deal with property.' Property,
the constitution declares, is subject only to due process of • law, and
due process of law is held by the courts to be the judicial process*.
The collection of a public tax , is an administrative function,
whether it be local or Federal, excise or customs. The collector is
an administrative officer, and, though his acts may be appealed from,
he continues to collect in the appealed case until.it is judicially de
cided. The reason for this is obvious. The collection of a tax, excise
or customs, is necessary for support and existence of the Govern
ment. If collection must be suspended during an appeal from the
decision of the collector, it would be possible by general. appeal to
deprive the Government of revenue and embarrass or perhaps de
stroy it by taking away its support. Therefore a purely administra
tive conclusion is enforced until reversed, on appeal, by a judicial
court. It is probable that \u25a0 the President's' suggestion is: derived
from an analogy between the fixing of. a railroad rate by an admin
istrative body, and the collection of taxes by an administrative offi
cer. But is there an analogy between the collection of taxes for the
benefiuof sovereignty and the enforcement of a freight rate for the
benefit of an individual?
The purpose of the President is plain and praiseworthy. It; is
to hasten the hearing of appeals and prevent dilatory tactics.; If the
courtS'hold, as they may, that the .means proposed *are not adequate
to secure this, the same end may be reached by Congress establish-l
ing procedure by statute that will hasten an appeal to *a; finality,
and by providing that the Government .shall appear hi court for the
complaining shipper, at the option of the Attorney General; \u25a0
It is probable, however, that before reaching satisfactory legis
lation the courts must pass upon the' constitutional issues involved,'
and that Congress will hasten results by putting, in an adminis
trative body the powers asked, for. by the President. If the courts
void such legislation on constitutional^ grounds, there is still left
ample means for attaining the same, ends.
