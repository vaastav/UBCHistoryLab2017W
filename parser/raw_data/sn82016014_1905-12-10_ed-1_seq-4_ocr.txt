A SERMOX I OK TODAY.
This book of the law shall not depart out
of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate
therein day and night, that thou niayest
observe to do according: to all that is
written therein: for then tbou slia.lt
make thy way prosperous, and then
tlKu shalt have good success. Joshua
If .the nations of ,the earth would
obey this eighth verse, of the first chap
ter of Joshua there would be far less
wretchedness in this world of ours. Jt
would be reduced; to a minimum. There
would still be differences of opinion and
men would dispute with one another, for
man is not omniscient, nor can every
man see from the" same viewpoint. But
if men would keep" "the book of the
law" the Bible and meditate upon it.
and try to follow its teachings, hatred
and wrong-doing would be a thing of
the past. The Square Deal would be
the rule between man and man, and
every man would do his duty to his
neighbor and to his Maker.
There would be far less use for con
gresses and legislatures and courts if
men obeyed that verse. They would still
have disputes, but they would be friend
ly disputes arising from a difference in
their points of view; each would not at
tempt to get the advantage of his neigh
bor, and crime would be unknown.
There would be no demand for rate reg
ulation, for railroad magnates would be
just and treat every man fairly: There
might be trusts, but they would be or
ganized for purposes of economy and
not to drive competitors out of busi
ness and thus secure a monopoly in or
der to raise prices. Legislation would
still be necessary for such purposes as
digging the Panama canal, for on such
things men might differ in judgment
honestly, but there would be no graft
in connection with the enterprise.
If men obeyed that eighth verse of
Joshua Russia would not now be un
dergoing a veritable Reign of Terror,
for all disputes, both governmental
and private, would be settled on a
friendly basis. There would be a uni
versal disarmament of all nations, for
no longer would blood be shed with
shot and shell. Instead the armies of
the world would turn to peaceful pur
suits and be a help instead of a bur
den to their respective nations; and
battleships would be utilized to carry
merchandise to and fro on the seas.
Just new when men's minds ar.e oc
cupied with problems of government if
they will turn to this old Bible that
has endured for centuries they will
find in it the foundations for all gov
ernments and all laws. In it are the
most sublime teachings ever given to
humanity. The decalogue Of Moses is
the foundation of all law, govern
mental and moral. It is supplemented
by the Golden Rule given by the Great
Teacher and Savior of men. There is
nothing in its principles to which the
slightest objection can be offered by
any man who wishes to deal justly.
The injunction, "Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself," means simply
that no man shall seek an advantage
for himself that he would not be will
ing to give his neighbor.
Those nations which come nearest
to following this "book of the law"
are the ones which are the most ad
vanced in civilization, the ones in
which there is the most liberty and
the greatest justice. If men will fol
low its teachings not the teachings
that somebody may attribute to it,
but the plain, simple teachings that
are really in it there will be no need
for criminal laws. For it is the Book
of the Square Deal, and justice be
tween man and mam
AS TO PRIVATE CARS.
Congressman Campbell's bill which
he has just introduced into congress to
do away with the evils of the private
car system is certain to nrovoke a tre
mendous controversy if it gets to the
point where the beef trust and the
other big owneis of private car lines
fear that it will pass.
From the brief summaries of the bill
that have been received in Kansas thus
far it appears that Mr. Campbell in
tends to abolish private cars- entirely
by prohibiting railroads from hauling
them. This goes much farther than
President Roosevelt's idea evidently,
for he only recommends that the sup
ervision of private car lines and other
methods of indirect rebating shall be
given to the administrative body that
shall regulate rates.
At first thought it would seem that
the Kansas congressman's proposal is
somewhat drastic and it will undoubt
edly be so considered in many quarters.
But the private car evil is one of the
worst possibly the very worst of our
transportation evils, and it will require
heroic "measures to eradicate it. Mr.
Campbell evidently realizes this and
lie is sinking at the root of the trou
ble by moving to abolish the entire
sys itm.
Few people realize just how great a
drain upon transpottation private cars
are. According to u report issued last
January there were then 65.8o8 refrig
erator cars owned by private car lines
and only 1S.6SS owned by railroads. In
addition to refrigerator cars there were
96,849 private cars of other kinds, a to
tal of 162,687 cars of all kinds belonging
to private lines.
Of late years no records have been
obtainable concerning the earnings of
private cars, for their owners claim in
dependence of the interstate commerce
commission and will not report, but
back in 1872 the annual convention of
the international car accountants gave
cut some figures. At that time the rail
roads were paying three-fourths of a
cent per mile mileage on 70,000 private
cars, and the cars earned $30,660,000 In
mileage in 1SP0. The value of these cars
was about $600, and the earnings
amounted to $36 per car per month a
pretty good interest on the investment.
This rate of earnings applied to the
162.687 private cars now in use would
aggregate $71,-r.0,O00 a year. The esti
mated capital invested in these cars is
$100,000,000, so that the car lines are
making at least 71 per cent interest on
their investment just from mileage
alone.
However, it is assetted that the rate
of three-fousths cf a cent a msie no',y
applies only east of Chicago and St.
Louis.'and west of those points the
charge is one cent a mile.
But the mileage is not the only in
come of the private ear lineg. For the
refrigerator cars, which are owned
largely by the beef trust or its sub
sidiary companies, receive millions of
dollars from icing cSiarges, and at least
one contract has been shown . to the
interstate eommeree commission, giving
the private car company a commission
of 12'i per cent on all freight charges
on perishable goods carried in its cars,
which in some instances would alone
amount to mpre than the mileage in
come. THE REWARDS OF FIDELITY.
Readers of the State Journal who
have been following the journeys of
Mr. E. W. Howe across the Pacific, as
described in his letters in this paper,
recall his reference to the Midway is
lands and their inhabitants.
These islands, Mr. Howe says, lie
eleven hundred miles west of Hono
lulu, a eoral reef only a few feet
above the sea level, but sufficient to
afford a cable station. There live a
cable operator with his wife, two as
sistants, and a few servants. All the
cable messages between 'eastern Asia
and the United States are relayed at
that station, and this is what necessi
tates the presence of an operator
there.
You have often noted in traveling,
Mr. Howe continues, lonely railroad
stations in out-of-the-way places, but
you never have seen anything equal
ling in loneliness the cable station out
there in the middle of the Pacific
ocean, eleven hundred miles from the
nearest human habitation. There is
no vegetation on the islands, only sand
and water in every direction. The
"Siberia" 'stopped there for a brief
time on its last trip eastward, and
that was the first time the few people
on the islands had seen other human
beings in five months! Think of the
loneliness of it!
But ttiL-re is another element in the
case that Mr. Howe does not point
out. The very fact that requires the
presence of that lonely operator in
the middle of the Pacific ocean puts
him in instantaneous touch with two
continents. Every word that passes
on the cables under the seas between
Asia and America goes through his
hands. On hn depended the com
munications that passed between the
Japanese ieace commissioners at
Portsmouth and the Japanese govern
ment at Tokio last summer. Through
his hands went the cable correspond
ence between President Roosevelt and
the Mikado, which is credited with
finally bringing about peace. All the
news from the Philippines he must re
peat. Some of this he probably does
not understand, for it is sent in secret
code, but he undoubtedly hears the
great news of the world even before
the people of the most populous
centers.
The moralist can draw a great les
son from the lonely operator on the
Midway islands. He is there because
his duty demands it, and his very fidel
ity to duty brings turn his greatest
privileges.
You can carry out the moral for
yourself.
The Railroad's Side.
From "Railroad Rebates," by Ray
Stannard Baker, in the December
McClure's.
II a man is too conscientious to pay
rebates and break the law at the de
mand of Armour or of Pabst of Mil
waukee, he is eliminated and a less
honest man takes his place a man
who is willing to make terms with his
conscience, to "do as the Romans do,'
or find some shady device that can be
furnished up by the legal department
to look lawful. -The railroad man, in
deed, makes a pretty strong case for
himself, showing that he is the vic
tim of his own defenselessness which
the shrewd trust shippers well know.
I quote from an excellent address by
J. W. Gleed, an attorney for the
Frisco system.
"A railroad must have tonnage;
herein lies Its weakness and defense
lessness. It is an investment that can
never produce but one commodity,
namely, transportation, and that com
modity must be consumed where the
railroad lies. It cannot be stored rn
July to be sold in November. Its in
vestment is permanent and the ex
penses run on, traffic or no traffic.
Bankrupt though it 'becomes. its
wheels still turn in desperate hope:
and the worse its financial plight the
more reckless and dangerous its com
petition. Most western roads could
carry twice their present tonnage,
with comparatively slight increase of
total annual expense. In this fact lies
the great weakness and temptation ot
a railroad. A railroad man says: 'I
can sell this one shipper transporta
tion at a fraction of a cent a ton and
yet not be out anything, because I
can so easily produce more transpor
tation.' "
James J. Hill, undoubtedly the fore
most railroad man in the country to
day, said recently in an interview:
"As the matter now stands and has
stood for a number of years the prac
tice of rebates has enabled the big
shippers to hold a club over the rail
roads. The more this question is
studied, the more it will be found that,
after all, the railroads need some pro
tection." It is hardly surprising, then, with
this natural weakness of the railroads
combined with the greedy demands of
great shippers, that traffic morals
have come to be so easy in this coun
try. And yet, w hen the public savs to
the railroad man, as it is saying now,
"see here, you are the victims of your
own property and of the greed of
powerful shippers; let us pass laws
that will arm us both against the
predatory trusts." the railroad man
takes wild alarm, fearing that his
power and his profits in some way
will be lessened. But until the pres
ent methods of conspiracy breeding
secrecy and wholly irresponsible pri
vate control of the railroads are ut
terly revolutionized we cannot hope to
have a fair system of rate taxation,
we cannot hope to grapple with the
trusts, and, far more important than
that, we cannot secure a condition in
which decent business morals are even
possible!
One of the very worst results of the
payment of rebates to favored ship
pers has been the corroding growth of
suspicion and distrust throughout the
railroad business. It is a hard thing
to say. but one cannot look into the
question at all closely without reach
ing the conclusion that the honor of a
promise, "the word, of a man." has
disappeared in the railroad freight
business. A promise even a signed
contract will not stand for one mo
men! , if by breaking it a railroad
ascnt can secure one car mors of
freight. These are strong words, but
every man in the service, down in his
heart, knows that they are true. I
have listened to these men telling
with absolute glee how they got to
gether, all promising, even swearing
a "gentleman's agreement" not to
give a rebate to certain shipper, and
how, the moment they got out of the
meeting, every man used his best wits
to break his oath as quickly as pos
sible. Surely, a system which pro
duces such dishonesty is wrong,
wrong from the bottom to the top.
Freight Rates in Illinois.
From the Chicago News.
The Illinois railway and warehouse
commission, which has been conaiiier
ing the question of freight rates in this
state for nearly four years, has finally
become convinced that the rates are
too high. It has ordered reductions
of 20 per cent, from the charges now
exacted. In announcing the orderthe
commission presents a number of sta
tistics which on their face Justify the
cut. The evidence, it declares, shows
that the rates in Illinois are generally
higher than those charged for the
same service in other states, higher
even than in Indiana, where the roads
fixed their own rates. Carrying
charges from Chicago to points just
over the line in Indiana, for instance,
are much lower than to points nearer
Chicago in Illinois. Where there is
no competition the rate between Illi
nois towns are higher and in some
cases double those charged for the
same distance from points outside the
state.
Some of the railways evidently are
disposed to protest against the reduc
tion and threaten to take the issue into
the courts. That is their right and
their privilege. The grounds for the
reduction, , as stated by the commis
sion, are questions of fact and should
be easily proved or disproved. If they
are borne out and Illinois rates are
too high the shippers within -this state
have been suffering injustice and the
new order is a necessary, beneficial
measure for their protection. If the
facts are incorrectly stated the roads
will be able to have the order annulled
and their ultimate position will be
stronger than before. Some of the
roads complain that the $10,000,000
cut in their revenues will compel them
to reduce wages or forego dividends.
If under a reasonable rate the roads
cannot earn a fair return on their in
vestment there will be good reason to
go into the question of capitalization,
which will be both interesting and in
structive. Transportation comoanies
that are overcapitalized cannot expect
to be protected from tne consequences
at the expense of the general public.
.Mill, it mere exists any good reason
why the Illinois shipper should not
enjoy advantages equal to those ac
corded to shippers in Indiana. Iowa
and other adjacent states the railways
snouia nasten to make that reason
known and present the facts, figures
and arguments in support of it.

FROM OTHER PEIfS
ALEXANDER FIRST OF RUSSIA.
BY JOHN GREEXLEAF WHITTIER.
This poem of Whittter's was written be
fore anything of his was ever published,
and has never been in print. This was
written, as is shown, by the Quaker
date, only a short time after the news
of the death of Alexander 1st reached
this country, and before Whittier had
any other educational advantage than
the district school. Alexander had the
reputation of encouraging the Introduc
tion of western civilization in his em
pire, and he abolished serfdom in the
Baltic provinces. His part in curbing
the ambition of Napoleon was probablv
uppermost in the Quaker bov'a mind",
when he wrote these lines, which are
- the earliest extant in his own hand
writing. Samuel t. Pickard, Amesbury,
Mass.
The pride of the North to the tomb has
descended.
The glory of Russia hps sunk in decay:
For departed is he whose dominion ex
tended O'er the Tartar and Cossack with abso
lute sway!
Cold and still is the heart of the princely
Commander, j
The star of his glory is set in death's
gloom :
The clods of the valley enshroud Alexan
der, And Azof's tide washes the base of his
tomb:
As a tyrant and despot the world may
upbraid him.
And vilely with infamy his memory
brand.
Unlike to the time when with awe it sur
veyed him.
The wonder of Europe, the pride of his
land.
But look to the records of grandeur and
glory
Of absolute monarch and despotic chief,
How few can be found within History's
story.
More worthy than he of the tribute of
grief?
Long ages may pass, and the distant sun
lling out
Its cold beams on many an Emperor's
tomb,
And the bells of St. Petersburg merrily
ring out
A welcome to others te rise in their
room ;
And there may not be found when the
long record closes.
Of those who have sat upon Russia's
high throne,
A prince more deserving than he who re
poses ,
Where Azof's tide washes his monu
ment stone!

How He Improved It.
"What," asked the spokesman for
the policyholders, "have you been do
ing (recently to improve the condition
of this company?"
"Oh," replied the life insurance pres
ident, "I have done a great deal in
that respect. My wife's brother is no
longer general manager, her fainer has
ceased to he chief medical examiner,
her uncle has been forced to give up
the vice presidency and her nephew is
no longer the company's actuary."
"Splendid! Splendid!" cried the pol-
nvnuiutis. jnree cneers:
The excitement having subsided, the
spokesman for the policyholders asked:
"How did it come about that all these
people were dropped?"
"Well, you see, my wife died about
a year ago."
"Ah ! And who is the new vicej presi
dent ?"
"Hoiatius Van Slaub."
"H'm! I've never heard of him he
fore. Has he had a long experience in
the insurance business?"
"I really can't say that he has. Until
a few months ago he conducted a pho
tograph gallery which made a specialty
of a dozen cabinets for 75 cents. But
he's an able mar really a very able
man."
"And who is the new general man
ager?" "Edgar Van Slaub."
"And the chief medical examiner?"
''Henry Van Slaub."
"What experience has he had to fit
him for the position?"
"Oh, he's an excellant man for the
place, I assure you. He has won four
medals as ,a poultry dresser, and, of
course, knows all about anatomy."
"I suppose the new actuary is well
fitted for his position?"
"Splendidly. He is Francis Van
Slaub, and before being secured at
great expense for this company he had
a position in a broker's office, it hav
ing been his duty to mark up the quo
tations on the blackboard as they were
taken from the ticker. You will see
by this that he is familiar with fig
ures." "Yes. The Van Slaubs seem to have
made quite a hit with you. Is it like
ly that any more of them will become
identified with the company in the near
future?" '
"Well ahem I am to be married to
Miss Julia Van Slaub about the mid
die of next month, after which I sup
pose she will be more or less intimate
ly connected with the concern's affairs."

Omitted for Once.
It was a lazy summer's day in Dead
wood. Here and there a few men were
hanging about saloons, and here and
there a solitary man was rubbing his
back against a corner building and
looking up and down the street in an
absent way. There were no drunken
men, no yelling, no dog fights. Three
or four tenderfoots walked the length
of the main street and back, and es
caped without bullet holes through
their hats.
It was thus when Texas Jack rode
into one end of the town on his cayuse
and Arizona Jim rode into the other.
They had never met, but they had
threatened to shoot on sight. On this
occasion they came tunning for each
other. At the cross streets in the cen
ter of the town they met. Their horses
were stopped within ten feet of each
other's noses, and the two noted men
sat and looked at each other for a long
two minutes. Then they looked around
them. Only one man was near by and
"iving them any attention, and he was
cross eyed. The town was asleep. The
men realized it as their eyes sought
each other again.
"Wall?" queried Texas Jack.
"Wall?" repeated the other.
"You are a gentleman."
"So are you."
"Wall, as one gentleman, speakin' to
another gentleman, I mieht inquar' if
it's wuth doin' any shootin' for."
" Mid as one gentleman answerin an
other gentleman, I should remark that
It heir.'t."
"Then so long."
"So long to yer." ' -
And the great men wheeled their
horses about and rode off without an
other word or a glance backward.
