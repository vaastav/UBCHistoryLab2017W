PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, D. G., Doo. 5, 1870.
To (he -Senate and Hovse of Representatives :
A year of poaoo aod genera] prosperity to
this nation Ima passed ai nco the last assem
bling of Congress. We have, through a kind
Providcnoe, been blessed with abundant crops,
and hayo been spared from complications and
war with foreign notions. lu our midst,
comparativo harmony bas boon rostorod. It
is to bo regretted, however, that a freo oxer
ciso of tho electivo franchise has, by violence
aud intimidation, bcou denied to citizens, in
exception ul coses, ia sovorol of tho States
lately in rebellion, and tho verdict of tho peo
ple has thereby been reversed.
The States of Virginia, Mississippi and
T' ne have been restored to representation iu
out national councils. Georgia, tho only
Stato now without reproscntion, may confi
dently bo oxpeotcd to take ber placo thcro
?Iso at tho beginning of tho new year; aud
then, let us hope, will bo compl?ter/ tho work
jf reconstruction. With an acquiescence on
he part of tho wholo people in tho national
ibligation to pay the publio debt, orcated as
bo prico of our uniou, tho pensions to our
lisablcd soldiers aud sailors, and their wid
?ws and orphans, and in tho changes to tho
costitution, wbioh have been made necessary | ]
y a great rebellion, ti.ero is no roason why
re should not advance in material happiness
s no other nation ever did after so protracted
nd devastuting a war. g
Soon after tho existing war broke out in t
?uropo, tho protection of tho United States t
I i nistcr in Puris was invoked in favor of t
rorth Germans domiciled in French territory. n
ustructions were issued to grant tho proteo- e
on. Thia bas been followed by on extension "
; American protection to citizens of Saxony, tl
cssc, Saxe Coburg, Gotha, Columbia, Por- t<
igal, Uraguay, the Dominican Republic, tl
quador, Chili, Paruguay and Venezuela, io u
uris. Tb? charge waa un onerous one, ro b
liriog constant and severe labor, as well as Q
o oxerciso of patience, prudence and good T
?^?"L/?M^ i?
tisfaotion of tho govcrumeot of North si
ermany. As soon os I learned that a rc- tl
iblio bad bcon proclaimed at Paris, and that ti
o pcoplo of Franco bad acquiesced in tho E
lange, tho Minister of the United States ol
is directed, by telegraph, to recognize it, ol
id to tandor my congratulations, and those al
tho pcoplo of tho United States. Tho rc- oi
tablisbmcnt in France of a system of gov- ti
nmcnt disconnected with the dyuastio tra- {)i
tions of Europe appeared to bo a proper 0
bject for the felicitations of Amerioons.- rt
?ould the present struggle result in attach- b;
g tho hearts of tho bronch to our simple F
rm of representative government, it will bc a
subject of still further satisfaction to our w
ioplo. While wo muko no effort to impose jj
ir institutions upon tho inhabitants of other ot
mntric?, and while wo adhcro to our tra- ci
tional neutrality iivAnvil contests elsewhere, JJ
0 cannot bo indifferent to tho spread of n
menean political ideas in a great and highly c<
vilized country Uko Franco. Wo wore ?<
ked by the now government to uso our good o
bees, jointly with thoso of European pow- | tl
s, in tho interests of pcaco. Answer was
udo that thc established poiioy and tho true
itcrcsts of thc Uuited States forbado them
1 interfero iu European questions jointly
it h European powers. I asocttainod, in
irmally and unofficially, that tho Government
f North Germany was not thon disposed to
sten to Buch representations from any pow
rs, and, though earnestly wishing to seo the
Ie88iugs of peace restored to belligerents,
?Uh all of whom the United States aro on
>rms of' friendship, I deolincd, on tho part
f this government, to take a step whiob could
n|y result iu injury to our truo interests,
ithout advantaging tho object for wbioh our
itcrve.ntion was invoked. Should tho timo
orno when tho action of the United States
an hasten tho roturn of pcaco a singlo bour,
hat action will bo heartily taken. I deemed
i prudont, in view of tho number of persons
f German and Frenob birth liviug in tho
Jnitod States, to ?BSUC, soon ofter the officiol
oticc of a stato of war had bc?n received
rom both belligerents, o proclamation do
ming tho duties of tho United Statis ts A
leutr?l, and tho obligations of persons residing
rithin thoir territory to obsorvo tboir laws
nd tho law of notions. This proclamation
taB followed by Others, as circumstances
eemod to call for them. The poople, thus
cquuintcd in advance of their duties and ob
?gu.'ODS, have assistod in preventing viola
ions of tho neutrality of tho Unitod States'.
lt is not understood that tho condition of
ho insurrection in Cuba hos materially
thonged sinco the olose of the lost session of
Jongrosa. In a? carly stuge of the contest,
ho authorities of Spoin inaugurated a systoui
jf arbitrary arrests, of oloso confinement, and
)f military trial and execution of persons sus
pooled ofcomplioity with tho insurgents,and
>f summary embargo of their properties, and
sequestration of tho revenues, by Executive
warrants. St*eh proceedings, so far OB they
affcotcu the portions or property of oititrans of
the United States, wore in violation of tho
provisions of the treaty ol' 1705, between the
United 8tutos and Spain. Representation* j
of injurio resulting to severa, persons olaim
ing to bo oitlions of the Unitod States, by
reason of suoh violations, weiro tnado to tho
Spanish Government.
From April, I860, to June last, the Span- j
(sh Minister at Washington had beeta ?lethe*
with it limited power to aid in redressing such
wrongs. Thai power was found to be with
drawn it? vlow. bs lb Wa?, of tho favorable sit
?ntion in whioh th? Wand of Cnba'then was j
whloh, howe* orA did not lead to a r?vocation
li
or suspension of tho extraordinary and arito
trary functions oxcroiscd by tho oxeoutilae
power in Cuba, and wo wore obliged to niolou
our complaints at Madrid. Ia tho negotii
tiona thus opened, and still ponding thor?t
tho United States only claimed that, for tlLi
futuro, rights scoured to their citizens bft
treaty should bo respected in Cuba, and tbot
as to tho post, a joint tribunal should bo cs
tubji3hed m the United States, with full ju
risdiction ovor all such oloims. Before such
an impartial tribunal, eaoh olaimant would
bo required to provo his case. On tho other
hood, Spain would bo at liberty to travorsc
every material faot, and then completo equity
would bo dono. A coso, which at ono time
threatened seriously to affeot tho relations
between tho United States and Spoin, bas
already boon disposed of in this way. Tho
olaim of tho owners of tho "Col. Lloyd Aspin
wall, for tho illegal soizuro and dotcntion of
that vessel, was rcforred to arbitration, by
mutual conpont, aud bas resulted in an award
to tho United States, for tho owners, of the
sum of ?10,702.50 in gold. Another and
long ponding claim, of like nature, that off fr
tho whnlcship "Canada," hos been disposers!
of by friendly arbitrament during the prcseb70r

eccnt examples show that tho mode which ai

djusting tho pending claims is just and fea
iblo, and that it may bo agreed to by cither
ation without dishonor. It is to bo hoped

representative from Bolivia, tho conference
as adjourned until tho attendance of a plen

mipnssing its object. Ihe allied and other
Republics of Spanish origin on this oontincnt

3e thom blessed with good governments, ca
able of maintaining order, and of preserving

ur sincere wish to extend our own commcr
ial and social relations with them. Tho timo
i probably not fur distant when, in the natu
?1 course of events, tho European political
onncction with this continent will cease.
Our policy should bo shaped in view of
his probability, so as to ally the commercial
ntorcsts of tho Spanish American States moro
losoly to our own, and thus give tho United
?tates oil tho pre-eminence, and all the ad
antoges which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Adamsand
dr. Clay contemplated, whoo they proposed
o join in tho Congross of Panama. During
ho last session of Congress, a treaty for tho
nnoxation of tho Republic of Sah Domingo
o tho United States, foiled to rcoeivo tho
cquisito two thirds voto of tho Senate I
?ns thoroughly convinced then, that tho best
ntorest of this country commercially and ma
eriolly domnndod its ratification. Timo has
mly coufirmcd mo in this viow. I now firm
y bolicvo that tho moment it is known, that
ho United States havo entiroly abandoned
:he project of aeeepting, ns a part of its torrl
:ory, the Island of San Domingo, a freo port
?viii bo negotiated for by European nations in
>he bay of Samand. A largo oommorcial oity
will spring up, to which we will bo tributary
without receiving corresponding benefits, and
then will bo seen the folly of our rebooting
io groat a prizo. The government of Son
Domingo bas voluntarily sought thia annex
ation. It is a weak power, numboring prob
nbly less than one hundred and twenty thou
sand souli, and yet possessing ono of tho
richest territories under tho sun, capable of
supporting a population of ten millions of peo
ple in luxury. Tho people of San Domingo
are not capable of maintaining themselves in
their present condition, and must look for out
side support. Thoy yoarn for the protection
of our free institutions and laws, our progress
and civilization. Shall we rofuso thom 5"
Tho acquisition of Soo Domingo lo deeirablo
because of its geographical position. It com
manda tho entrunco to the Cariboan Soa, and
th* Isthmus transit of coromerco. It possess
es the riebest soil, bost and most oapaoious
harbors, wost salubrious climate, and vaina
bio products of tho forest, mino and soil of
the West Indi* Islands. Its possession by
us will, to a few yeats, build up a ooastwlso
commerce of immense roognitudo, whioh will
go far towards restoring to us our lost mer
ohant marino. It will give to us thoso arti
cles whioh. wo oonsume to largely, and do not
produce; thus equalizing our exports and
imports. Tn caso of iv fotorfen war it will
give us command of all tho islands referred
, and thus prevent an enemy from ever 1
oin possessing himself of a roodozvous upon i
x very coast. i
At prosont, our ooast trade between the

servation, to rotain their laborors. San
mingo will become a large consumer of tho
?ducts of northorn farmers and manufaotnr
Tho oheap rate at which her oitizens
n bo furnished with food, tools and moobin
y, will tnako it necessary that contiguous
fa nels should have the same advantages, in
der to competo in the production of sugar,
iffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, ?ko. This will
?on to us a still #widcr market for our pro
jeta. Tho production of our own supply
' these artioleo will cut off moro thou ono
iindrcd millions of our annual imports, bo
des largely inoreaaing our exports. With
loh a picture it is oasy to seo bow our^ large
;bt abroad is ultimately to bo extinguished.
ritb a balance of trado against us, including
terest on bonds bold by foreigners, and moo
f spent by our citizens traveling in foreign
ods, equal to thc entire yield of thc precious
ctals in this country, it is not easy to see how
iis result is to bo otherwise accomplished.
Tho acquisition of San Domingo io an nd
srenco to tho Monroe doctrine, lt is a
casuro of national protection. It is assert
ig our just claim to a controlling influenoo

id Porto luco, at onoe, and ultimately so in
?razil ; it is to -settle tho unhappy condition
f Cuba, and end exterminating conflict ; it
to pr?vido honest means of paying our hon
it debts, without overtaxing tho people ; it
to furnish our citizens with tho necessaries
f every day life, ot cheaper rates than over
eton: ; and it is, in fine, a rnpid stride to
ards that greatness which the intelligence,
idustry and enterprise of tho United States
ititlcs this country to assume among nations.
3 view of tho importance of this question,
earnestly urge upon Congress early action,
cprcssivc of its views as to tho bcBt means
' acquiring Son Domingo. My suggestion is,
tut by joint resolution of the two houses of
ongress, tho Executive bo authorized to ap
liut a commission, to negotiate a treaty with
io outhoriticsof San Domingo, for thc ao
lisition of that Island, and that an appropri
ion be made to defray tho expenses of such
emission The question may then be defor
med, either by the action of the Senate upon
c treaty, or tho joint action of the two houses
Congress vpon a resolution of annexation, as
tho case of tho acquisition of Texas. So
nvinced um I of tho advantages to flow
jm tho acquisition of San Domingo, and of
e great disadvantages-I might almost say
Amities-to follow from non acquisition,
ut I believe the subject bas only to be in
stigated to bo approved of. It is to bo re
fitted that our representations in regard to
3 injurious effects, especially upon tho rev
ue of tho United States, of tho policy of
) Mexican Govornmcnt in exempting from

it it is even proposed in that country to

and Europeans. Since the Adjournment of
Congress ?ho ratifications of tho trcafy with
Great Brittan for abolishing thd mired courte
for tho suppression of the slave trade hare
been exchanged. It 1s believed that the slave
trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Af
rica, whence the slaves aro taken to Arabian
markets. Tho ratifications of the Naturalisa
lion Convention between Great Britain sud
thc United States have also boen exchanged
during the recesa, and thus a long standing
dispute between tho two Governments has been
settled in accordance with tho principles al
ways contended for by tho United States.
In April last, while engaged in locating a
military reservation near Penbrina, a corps
of engineers discovered that thc commonly
received boundary line between the United
States and the British possessions, at that
plaoo, is about forty-seven hundred feet south
of the forty-ninth parallel, and that the linc,
when run on what is now supposed to be the
truo position of that parallel, would leave the
fort of tho Hudson Bay Company at Pombina,
within tho territory of tho United States.
This information being communicated to the
British Government, I was requested to con
sent, and did cousent, that the Brittisb occu
pation of tho fort of Hudson Bay Company
should continue fer the present. I deem it
important, however, that this part of tbe boun
dary line should be definitely fixed by a joint
commission of the two Governments, and 1
submit bcrowith catimotcs of the expeuse of
snob a commission, on thc part of the United
States, and recommend that an appropriation
be mado for that purpose. Tho land bounda
ry has already been fixed and marked, from
tho summit of tho Kooky Mountains to tbc
Georgian Bay. It should now be, in like
manner, marked from tho Lako of the Wood?
to tho summit of thc Rocky Mountains. I
regret to say that no conclusion has been
reached for the adjustment of the claims
ogainst Groat Britain, growing out of the
course adopted by that Government during the
pear to.be Willing W cbhcfc?o~i?l?ani?V fftbj?il
ty's Government was guilty of any negligence,
or did, or permitted any act during tho war
by which tho Uuited States has just cause of
complaint. Our firm and unalterable convic
tions sro decidedly the reverso. I, therefor
recommend Congress to authorizo'the appoint
ment of n commission to take proof of amounts
and the ownership of these several claims, on
notice to the representative of Her Majesty at
Washington, and that authority bo given for
the settlement of these claims, by thc United
States so that tho Government shall have the
ownership of the private claims, as well ss
tho responsible control of all tho demands
against Great Britain. It cannot bo necessa
ry to add that whenever Her Majesty's Gov
ernment shall entertain a desire for a full and
friendly adjustment of these claims, tho
United States will enter upon their consider
ation with an earnest desiro for a conclusion
consistent with tho honor and dignity of both
nations.
_ Tho course pursued by tho Canadian au
thorities toward tho fishermen of tho United
States duripg the past season, bas not been
marked by a friendly feeling. By the first
Article of tho Convention of 1818, between
Great Britain and the United States, it was
agreed tbat the inhabitants of tho United
States should have forever, in common with
the British subjeots, the right of taking fish
in certain waters therein defined. In the wa
ters not included in tho limits named in the
Convention, within three miles of parts of
tho British coast, it has been the custom for
many years to givo to intruding fishermen of
tho United States a reasonable warning of
their violation of the technioal rights of Great
Britain. The Imperial Government is under
stood to have delegated the whole ot a share
>i its jurisdiction or control of these inshore
fishing grounds, to the colonial authority,
known as the Dominion of Canada, and this
semi-independent, but irresponsible agent, has
exercised its delegated powers in an unfriend
ly way. Vessels have boen seized, without
notice or warning, in violation of tho custom
previously prevailing, and have been taken
into the colonial ports, their voyages broken
ap, and the vessels condemned. And there
is reason to boliove that this unfriendly and
vexatious treatment was designed to bear
harshly upon thc hardy fishermen of the Uni
ted States, with a view to political effect upon
this Government.
The statutes of the Dominion of Canada as
sumo a still broader and more untenable juris
diction over tho vessels of tho Uuited States.
They authorize officers, or persons, to bring
vessels hovering within three marine miles
)f any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors
if Canada into port, to searoh tho cargo, to
ixaminc tho master on oath touching tbe oar
;o and voyage, and to inflict "non him a heavy
pecuniary penalty if true ..newera are not
given ; and if such vessel is found preparing
to fish within three marine miles of any of
otoh coasts, bays, creeks or harbors without,
i license or after the expiration of tho period
named in tho last license granted to it, they
provide that the vessel, with her tackle, ?co.,
sc., shall be forfeited. It ia net known that
?ny condemnations havo been made under

the claim io founded on an alleged oonbtruc
tioD of the convention of 1819, it oannot be
acquiesced in by the United btates. It is
hoped that it will not bo insisted on by Her
Majesty's Government. During tho confer
ences which prseeded the negotiations*^ the
convention of 1818, the Britibh Commission?
ers proposed to expressly exclude the fisher
men of the United ointes from tho privilege
of carrying on trade with nay of Hb Britania
Majesty's subjects residing within the limits
assigned for their uso, and alco that it should;
not be lawful for the v?asela of the United
States, engaged in said fishery, to have on
board any goods, wares or merchandize what
ever, exoopt Buob ac may be neocosoxy for tho
prosecution of their voyagea to and from said
fishing grounds ; snd any vessel of the Uni
ted States which ?hall contravene these regu
lations, may be Boixod, condemned and confis
cated, with her oargo. This proposition,
which is identified with the construction now
put upon the language of tho convention, was
emphatically rejected by the American Com
missioners, and, therefore, was abandoned by
tho British Plenipotentiaries ; ?nd Artiolo X,
as it stands in the convention, iras substitu
ted. If, however, it be said that thin claim
is-founded on Provincial or Colonial Statutes,
and not upon the convention, thia Govern
ment cannot but regard theta aa unfriendly;
and in contravention of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the treaty for tho faithful execution
of which vue Imperial Government ia alone
responsible. Anticipating that an attempt
may possibly be made by tho Canadian au
thorities in tho coming season to repeat their
unneighborly acts towards our fishermen, I
" recommend you to confer upon tho Excoutivo
tho power to suspend by proclamation
tho operation of tho laws authorizing the
transit of goods, wares and merchandise, in
bond, across the territory of the United
Stfli.es IQ Canada, and further, should such an
pcml uno upenmuu mr t-nj ???n-wnjituj u>_
vessels of tho Dominion of Canada are permit
ted to enter the waters of the United States.
A like unfriendly disposition has been mani
fested on the part of Canada is the mainte
nance of tb? claim of right to exclude the cit
izens of the United ?tstea from the navigation
of tho St. Lawrence. This river constitutes
a natural outlet to tho ocean for eight States,
with an aggregate population ef about 17,
600,000 inhabitants, and with cn aggregate
tonnage of 661,267 tons upon the waters
which disohargo into it. The foreign com
merce of our ports ou these waters is open to
British competition, and tho major part of it
is done in British bottoms. If tho American
seamen bo excluded from this natural avenno
to the ocean tho monoply of the desired com.
moree of the Lake poi ts, with tho Atlantic,
would bo in foreign hands, their vessels on
trans-Atlantic voyages having an access to
our Lako ports, which would be denied to
American vessels, on similar voyages. To
state s?ch B preposition ls io P?fuie it* justice.
During tho administration of Mr. John
Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay unanswerably dem
onstrated the natural sight of tho citisens of
the United States to tbe navigation of the
river, oloitning that the sot of tbe Congress
of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other
rivera to all nations showed lae judgment of
European jurists or of statesmen that tho in
habitants of a country through which a navi
gable river passes havo a natural right to en?
joy the navigation of that river to and into
the sea, even though passing through the
territories of another power. This right does
not ezoludo the co-equal right of tho sover
eign possessing the territory through whioh
the river debouches into the sea to m ak o such
regulations relative to the police of tho navi
gation as may be reasonably necessary j but
t hese regulations should bc Lamed in a libe
ral spirit of comity, and should not Impose
needless burdo un upon th ?oom m oreo which
has the righi of transit. It haa been found
in practice more advantageous to arrange
these regulations by mutual agreement. Tho
United States are ready to moko any reason
able arrangement as to the pol i oo of tho St.
Lawrence which may be suggested by Great
Brittan. If the chum made by Mr. Clay was
just, when tbe population of tho States bor
dering on the shores of the Lakes was only
8,400,000, it now derives* greater force and
equity from thc inorcased population, wealth,
production and tonnage or tho States on the
Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced
hia argument in behalf of our right, the
principle for whioh he contended has been
freuuet:tly, and by various nations; rocognir.c.d
by law or by treaty, and bas been extended io
so voi * I oilier great rivera. By the treaty
concluded at Mayenne in 1831, tho Rhine
was declared free Loin the point Where il if?
first navigable into the sea. By thc conven

in 1886, the navigation of the Douro, through
out its whole extent, was m ado Leo fot. the
