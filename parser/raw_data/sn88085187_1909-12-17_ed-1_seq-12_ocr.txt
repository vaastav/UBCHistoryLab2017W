If we can sell 1,500 Pianos in a few days. This
looks big; it is big. It is the greatest undertaking
in Piano selling that lias even been announced. We
are daily selling more Pianos than we usually sell
in a month. This is a big statement, but it is truth,
every word of it. Do you know the reason why?
Because we have discounted every possible discount,
we have made every possible concession, we have
discounted the amount of advertising allowed us
by the manufacturers. To obtain these prices you
must apply a manufacturer's check. New Pianos are
being sold as low as $125.00; new Player Pianos for
less than the same Piano sells for without the
interior Player. Old Pianos and Organs taken in
exchange, providing we can get them at our price,
but we must have them at a price equally as low as
we are offering our regular stock, for we are selling
good used Pianos for less than $100.00. Several
have been sold as low as $25.00, and we still have a
few at $25.00. When we get short of stock in one
store we reship from another. Remember, we are
closing out from three stocks of 500 Pianos in each
j lot—Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane. Bather than
box and ship to Los Angeles, we are going to sell
every possible Piano. If we do not vacate, we have
I $10,000.00 in cash to pay on January first. This is
! our agreement and settlement with the landlord,
who was suing us for $10,000.00 damages.
