In his report, sent ; to ' Congress on the
14th, the Attorney-General urges that District-
Attorneys be paid by salaries only, to be graded
according to place; that the District of Columbia
be no exception to the law; giving the app .int
ments of Assistant District-Attorneys to the
Attorney-General ; that a uniform mode of select
ing jurors for United States Courts be provided
by law; that ' a law be passed forbidding
the payment of Deputy-Marshals by certificates or
due-bills, and the advance of any money to Mar
shals' whose accounts are unadjusted at the
Treasury for over six months. He refers to the
case of Brigham Young and asks further legisla
tion. The labors of the Supreme Court and the
Conrt of Claims are alluded to, and It is suggested
that such legislation be had as will enable the latter
court, aided by the Attorney-General, to increase
the safeguards against improper testimony by
devising different modes ot taking it, and to
force old cases to early trial or require them to
be dismissed without power of restoration. To
these ends he proposes, after consultation with
the court, to draft a bill and submit it to the
present Congress. ' . , V .

Upon
i The following extracts are taken from
tx-Senator Henderson's speech before the
jury in the - Avery case at St. Louis, and
contain the offensive laneuase for which
the President, unanimously supported by
me uaDinet, ordered ms discharge as as
sistant in prosecuting the whisky cases at
t. JjOuis:
; What right had Babcock to s:o to Douglass
to induce him to withdraw his agents?
Douglass was placed in his position to see
mat ine revenue laws of the Government
were properly enforced. What business,
then, had Douglass with -him? When an of
ficial sroes into office he should be free and
independent of all influences except that of
law, and if he recognizes any other master
then this Government is tumbling down.
What right has the President to interfere
ith Commissioner Douglass iu the proper
discharge of his duties, or with the Treasu
rer?. None; and Douglass showed a lament
able weakness of character when he listened
to Babcock's dictates. lie should either have
insisted that his orders, as they existed, be
carried out, or should have resigned his
offlcew "Now n .why - did : Douglass bend
the supple hinges of the knee and permit any
interference by the President? This was
Douglass' own business, and he stoed re
sponsible for it under his official oath. He
was bound to listen to no dictation from tbe
President, Babcock, or any other officer, and
it was bis duty to see that that order was car
ried out or to resign. Would that we had
officials who possessed more of that sterner
sturf of which the office-holders of olden times
were made. Why do they not leave their
office when they cannot remain there honor
ably? Is it to continue that because a man
holds an office at the hands of another he is
to be a bonded slave ? ;.

A Paris correspondent writes: Almost
all French boys board at their respective
schools, and opening day has created here
new ana singular occupation among
that inventive race, the shabby-genteel
poor of Paris. It is against the rules for
the pupils ot any of the lyceums to return
to school without being accompanied by a
parent, a guardian, or relative, so a num
her v ol respectaolv-aressea men hang
around the aoors oi the ainerent schools,
ready to personate the uncle or the
.guardian of any unaccompanied pupil for
the small sum ol one iranc. A neatly-
dressed and gentlemanly-looking person
can thus amass quite a nice little sum on
opening day.
Ah American ' writer, dating his letter
from Gibralter, says : " The more I see
of Gibralter the less I wonder at the tenac
ity with which it is held by England and
the dislike the Spaniards have for the
English tenure of the place. The strength
of the position is something wonderful.
Nature and military art seem to have
worked together in making ' Gib' as in
vulnerable as it is possible to be.' Nor
does the Engineer Department allow mod
ern progress m either guns or batteries to
pass unnoticed. Of the former there are
some hlty or sixty about to be changed
for others of a much larger caliber. Even
as it is, the army of men has never yet
lived, nor has one of the fleet of ships yet
been built, that could for two hours with
stand the withering fire of the guns now
in position on various parts ol the rock."
The stern inflexibility of British iustice
has never been better exemplified than it
was very recently in one of the Irish
courts beiore which a young man was
brought for violating the Public Health
acts. The offense consisted in attending
a4 spelling-bee; while recovering from an
attack of scarlet-lever, and in exposing
himself in other places of public resort,
Jhereby imperiling the health of the peo
ple with whom he came in contact. The
testimony in the case' was unanswerable
and showed that the defendant was, even
at the time of his appearance in. court, in
k condition to transmit infection, which
must have been pleasant news to the oc
cupants of the crowded court-room. The
young man was promptly convicted, how
ever, and being fined two pounds paid it
in bank-notes which were, in all probabil
ity, quite as dangerous to the touch as he
was. Then he left; and the British Med
ical Journal very ensibVy characterizes
the proceeding as " a ludicrous example
of doing,. the right thing in the wrong
way." .

THE FROST KING.
From out his winter palace
The King has started forth;
Tbe birds have left their summer nests,
The wind is in the north.
-The river and the mountain.
The brown and wrinkled sod,
Begin to show already where
HiB messengers have trod.
The clouds unroll their ermine,
And o'er meadow, lane and street.
Like courtiers, spread their mantles down
Before the royal feet.
Close to the friendly corners
The sheltered ivies cling.
And wear their emerald cloaks despite
The coming of a King.
His mien and look are haughty,
His voice is cold and stern.
And yet his kisses on the cheek
Like crimson roses burn.
Down from the crested mountain.
With grandeur in his tread,
The W inter King is coming, with
A white crown on his head.
Not amid waving banners,
Or to the sound of drums
Beating their gladdest music.
This conqnering hero comes ;
But silently and solemnly
He enters his domain.
With twenty and a hundred good.
Stout yocmeninhis train.
Clasping the old earth tightly
Against his frozen breast.
As if she were his chosen neen.
He says : fc I bring thee rest.
Thon hast reigned long and nobly.
Thy virtues all are known,
And thou wilt not forgotten be
Though I possess the throne 1"
Contentedly resigning
Her scepter and her crown,
Beneath a downy coverlet
The weary Queen lay down.
To sleep with her companions.
Who, at the touch of spring.
Shall rise again in time to see
The going of a King.

STANLEY IX CENTRAL AFRICA.
Henry M. Stanley, the commissioner
sent by the New York Herald and a Lon
don newspaper to continue his former ex
plorations in equatorial Africa, writes a
very interesting letter from Ulagalla,
Uganda, E. longitude 32 deg. 49 min. 45
sec, N. lat. 0 deg. 32 min., under date
April 12, 1875, which appears in a recent
issue ol the Merald ana was published
simultaneously in Europe and this coun-try-
It was written just after an explora
tion of the Great Lake, and to the mind of
Mr. Stanley is satistactonly solved the
problem of the Nile. Speke and Grant-
thought that the Niyanza was a single
body of water, as Stanley has proved it to
be, but Livingstone believed it to consist
of a series of lakes, and in this latter opin
ion geographers have until now generally
acquiesced, it Mr. btanley's lurther ex
plorations confirm his present opinion a
general reconstruction ol the map ot Cen
tral Africa must result.
t Neither Speke nor Livingstone had ever
visited the laite, ana haa derived their
opinions irom conversation with the na
tives. Mr. Stanley says that from Mu
anza, the point from which Mr. Speke
caught a distant glimpse of Niyanza, two
points are seen which the. latter thought
were islands, and which are so designated
in his map, but a faithful exploration by
Mr. Stanley proved that they were lengthy
promonitories of land, extending into the
vast ooay oi water.
His first published letters contain Mr.
Stanley's account of launching a small
boat, the Lady Alice, upon the virgin
waters of Lake Niyanza. Proceeding east
ward along the unknown and labulous
shores with a picked crew of eleven men
and a guide, he coasted along the south
ern coast of the lake until he came to the
mouth of the Shimeeyu. This river at
its mouth is a mile wide, and extends
back a distance of 370 miles. Between
the mouth of the Shimeeyu and Kagehyi
are two countries buna and juagu and i
on the eastern side of the Shimeeyu is
Mayanza, and beyond the last Manasa.
Beyond Manasa he came to Ututwa,
inhabited by a people speaking a different
language, a people slender and tall and
carrying formidably long knives and ter
rible and portentous speais. Then fur
ther progress eastward brought them to
the large island of Ukura, which they cir
cumnavigated, and found to be eighteen
mnes long by twelve wide, and inhabited
by a people strong in charms and magic
medicine. Beyond this lay Shashi, and
beyond it the first district in Ururi, the
country of Ugeyeya. Here, Mr. Stanley
says, are mountains rising abruptly from
the lake to a height of 3,000 feet and
more. This coast is also very crooked
and irregular, requiring patient and la
borious rowing to investigate its many
bends and curves. The people are a
timid and suspicious race, much vexed
by their neighbors, the Waruri, south,
and Wamasui, east, and are loth to talk to
strangers, as the Arab slave-dealers of
Pangani have not taught them to love peo
ple carrying guns.
The Ugeyeyans, having been troubled
bjr the Waruri, have left many miles of
wilderness between their country and that
of their fierce neighbors uninhabited.
BuLSungoro, the agent of Mse Saba, who
prompted the Waruri to many a devilish
act, and has purchased the human spoils,
is constructing in UKerewe a dhow ot
twenty or thirty tons burden, with which
he intends to prosecute more actively his
netanous trade. .Nothing would have
pleased me better than to have been com
missioned by some Government to hang
ail such wretches wherever lound, and.
if ever a pirate deserved death for inhuman
crimes, Sungoro, the slave-trader, deserves
death. Kagehyi, in Usukuma, has be
come the seat of the inhuman slave-trade,
To this port they are collected from Sima,
Magu, Ukewere and Ugeyeya: and when
Sungoro has floated his dhow and hoisted
his blood-stained ensign the great sin
will increase ten fold, and the caravan-
road to Unyanyembe will become hell's
highway.
Sailing along the coast a few miles
from the equator, Mr. Stanley discovered
two islands formed of basaltic rook and
overgrown with tropical vegetation. At
Nakidino he reached the furthest point
east of the Victoria . Niyanza. Unyara
occupies the northeastern coast of the
Niyanza, and then Usoga begins. At the
district of Usowa the navigators met with
the nrst hostile intention though not act.
as the act was checked by show of superior
weapons on the part ot the natives.
Thence westward the districts of Ugamba,
uvira, usaniu ana utamba were succes
sively passed. Where LTtamba begins large
islands again became irequent, the princi
pal o which is Uvuma, an independent
country and the largest in the Victoria
.Niyanza. Mere, says JHr. Stanley, we ex-
perienced treachery and hostility on the
part oi the natives. - liy show - ol mend-
ship on their part we were induced to sail
within a few yards of the shore, while a
mass ot natives were hid in- ambush be
bind the trees. While sailing quietly by,
exchanging friendly greetings with them.
we were suddenly attacked with a shower
of large rocks, several of which struck
the boat; but the helm being quickly
put " hard up" we sheered from shore to
a safer distance, but not before one of the
rascals was laid dead by a shot from one
ol my revolvers.
After proceeding some miles we entered
a channel between the Islands of Uvuma
and Bugeycya. Here we discovered a fleet of
large canoes thirteen in number carry
ing over 100 warriors, armed with shields
and spears and slings. The foremost
canoe contained baskets of sweet-potatoes
which the people held up as if they were
desirous to iraue. i oraerea my peopi
to cease rowing, and as there was but
slight breeze we still held on with the
sail and permitted the canoe to approach
While we were bargaining for potatoes
with this canoe the other canoes came up
and blocked the boat, while the peopl
began to lay hands on everything; but we
found their purpose out, and I warned the
canoes away with my gun. Thev jeered
at this, and immediately seized their
spears and shields, while one canoe
hastened away with some beads they had
stolen, and which a man insolently held
up to my view, and invited us to catch
him. At sight of this I fired, and the
man fell dead in his canoe. The others
prepared to launch their spears, but the
repeating rifle was too much for the
crowd of warriors, who had hastened like
pirates to rob us. Three were shot dead
and, as they retreated, my elephant rifle
smashed their canoes, the result ot which
we saw in the confusion attending each
shot. Alter a few shots from the big gua
we continued on our way, still hugging
the shore of Uvuma, for it was unnecessary
to fly after such an exhibition of inglori
ous conduct on the part of thirteen canoes,
containing in the aggregate 100 men.
shortly alter this attack the boat was
anchored for the night, and next morning
Mr. Stanley and his crew rowed toward
Ripon Falls and the Napoleon Channel,
whence the great Niyanza discharges the
waters which become known to the world
as the perfect Nile which annually re
suscitates parched Egypt. , - - .
mora Kipon Falls they proceeded along
the coast ot Ikiroa until they reached the
irregular shore of Uganda. At Kriva the
travelers secured guides, who offered to
conduct them to Mtesa's capital. Halting
at the Island of Kibibi a short time, they
proceeded to Ukafu, from whence they
dispatched messengers to Mtesa to an
nounce the arrival of a white visitor in
Uganda, who had been most hospitably
received, with fair words, but with empty
hands, along the coast of Uganda. Arriv
ing at Beya they were welcomed by a fleet
of canoes, sent by Mtesa to conduct them
to his quarters.
On the 4th of April, says Mr. Stanley I
landed, amid a concourse of 2,000 people,
who saluted me with a deafening volley
of musketry and waving of flags. Kata
kiro, the chief Mukungu, or officer, in
Uganda, then conducted me to comforta
ble quarters, to which shortly afterward
were brought sixteen goats, ten oxen, an
immense quantity of bananas, plantains,
sweet-potatoes, beside eggs, chickens,
milk, rice, ghee and butter. After such a
royal and bountiful gift I felt more curi
osity than ever to see the generous mon
arch. In the afternoon Mtesa, having pre
pared beforehand for my reception, sent to
say that he was ready to receive me Is
suing out of my quarters I found myself
in a broad street eighty feet wide and half
a mile long, which was lined by his per
sonal guards and attendants, his captains
and their respective retinues, to the num
ber of" about 3,000. At the extreme end of
this street and fronting it was the King's
audience-house, in whose shadow I saw
dimly the figure ot the. King sitting in a
cnair.
As I advanced toward him the soldiers
continued to fire their guns. The drums
beat a fearful tempest of sound, and the
flags waved, until I became conscious
that all this display was far beyond my
merits, and consequently lelt greatly em
barrassed by so flattering a xeception.
Arrived before the audience-house the
King arose a tall and slender- figure.
dressed in Arab costume approached me
a few paces, and held outhis hand mutely.
Mtesa is about thirty-Jour years old. tall
and slender in build, as I have already
stated, but with very broad shoulders
His face is very agreeable and pleasant,
and indicates intelligence and mildness
As soon as he began to speak I became
captivated by his manner, for there was
much oi the polish oi a true gentleman
about it it was at once amiable, graceful
and friendly. It assured me that in Mtesa
I had found a friend, a generous King
and an intelligent ruler.
it vou will recollect that Mtesa is a
native of Central Africa, and that he had
seen but three white men until I came.
you will, perhaps, be as much astonished
as I was. And if you will but think of the
enormous extent ol country he rules, ex
tending from east longitude 34 to east
longitude 31, and from north latitude 1 to
south latitude"3 :30, you will perceive the
immense influence he could wield toward
the civilization of Africa. Indeed, I could
not regard this King or look at him in anv
other light than the Augustus by whose
means the light of the Gospel will be
brought to benighted Middle Africa.
Undoubtedly the Mtesa ol to-day is
vastly superior to the vain youth whom
Speke and Grant saw. There is no
butchery of men or women ; seldom one
suffers the extreme punishment. Speke
and Grant left him a raw, vain youth and
heathen. He is now a gentleman, and,
professing Islamism, submits to other
aws than his own erratic will, which, we
are told, led to severe and fatal conse
quences. .Behind his throne the royal smeld-
bearers, lance-bearers and gun-bearers
stand erect and staid. On either side ot
him are his grand chiefs and courtiers,
sons of Governors of his provinces, chiefs
of districts, etc.
Mtesa asked a number of questions
about various things, thereby showing a
vast amount of curiosity and great intelli
gence. .
The rung had arrived at this camp
Usavara fourteen days before my arrival,
with this immense army of followers for
the purpose of shooting birds. He now
proposed to return after two or three days'
rest to his capital at Ulagalla or Uragara.
Each day of my stay at Usavara was a
scene ot gavety ana rejoicing, un the
first after my arrival we beheld a grand
naval review eighty-lour canoes, , each
manned by from thirty to forty men, con
taining in the aggregate about 3,500 men.

aloud the glory of their monarch or in ex
citing admiration from the hundreds of
spectators on shore. .The King's 30U
wives were present en ' grande teruuz and
were not the least important of those on
shore.
The second day the King led his fleet in
person to snow me ms prowess in snoot

" Murchison Creek," visiting en route a
dhow he is building for the navigation of

When we arrived at this magnificent
breadth we viewed the capital crowning

Arrived at tiie"capital I foundvthat the

which ran five separate palisades and cir
cular courts, between which and the city
-was a circular road, ranging from 190 to
200 feet in width, from which radiated six
or seven magnificent avenues lined with
gardens and huts.
The next day after arriving 1 was in

were by no means comical. The chiefs
were very respectable-looking people,
dressed richly in the Arab costume The
palace was a huge and lofty structure
well built of grass and cane, while tall
trunks of trees upheld the roof, which
was covered with cloth -sheeting inside.
On the fifth day after his arrival Mr
Stanley met Col. Lenant de Bullcfonds, of
the iigyptian army, who had been sent
by uoi. woraon to Mtesa to make a treaty
of .commerce between him and the igyp
tian Government. Col. Bellefonds fully
confirmed the opinion of Mr. Stanley that
the great Niyanza was the true source of
the Nile.
A postscript to Mr. Stanley's letter, writ
ten on the 14th, presents the views of the
writer on Mtesas' Kingdom as a field
tor missionary enterprise, and declares
that country a field and a harvest ripe for
the sickle ot the uospei. What is wanted,
according to Mr. Stanley, is the practical

to become Christians, cure their diseases,
construct dwellings, understands . 'Agri

A little incident came to our knowledge
'f. 1
in 1873 aohvsician in one of the lar -It-
ies, while making his daily rounds, gave
a description to one of his patients of -the
almshouse that day, especially" dwelling
upon the pitiable sight of so many chil
dien to whom Christmas had not been
even a name, but had passed in all the
dull miseryof other days. .The-4ady to
whom he spoke was a helpless invalid, un
able for years to leave her bed;, she. was
straitened, too, in meanii.- But, hearing
the story, she-determined --fhatrthenext
Christmas .should bring a little pleasure
to at least some of the little ones whom
society had thrust out of the pale even at
their birth. She had that inevitable store
house in a family, the "piece-bag,"
brought and emptied on her bed, and be
gan to make rag babies, knitted mittens,
balls, etc., etc. the thousand inexpen
sive little trifles which required only labor
and patience to make them precious to
any child. She had a whole year in
which to work; her courage and zeal
grew with every day ; her friends became
interested and brought in their Contribu
tions of" velvet, "cloth, yarn. 'etc." When
she had provided some little gift for each of
the children she began to work for the in

given from. the unseen friend,r she lying
in the far-off little room which she never
was to leave alive; and with each gift was
some message of Christian kindness

day and of His errand here.
All -.is '-appened last Christmas and

The birthday of Christ is coming again,
and in every town there is an almshouse,
asylum or jail filled with, the miserable,
the guilty,- the "poor the veryxlass to
whom He came first; and in every one of
these towns there are communities ol men
and women who profess to follow Him." J

Ballooning.
The Boston Advertiser gives the follow
in g synopsis ot a lecture recently deliv
ered in max city by the veteran aeronaut,
Prof. Wise:
The lecturer began' with -a few words
about the first ideas of ballooning, saying
that homer had the idea in his mind..
Bishop Wilkins, in the sixteenth century,
spoke of men taking their flying machines
for a sail through the air, and long before
any means or aerial locomotion was dis
covered the idea was Considered feasible."'
After a few words on the uses of a bal
loon, hegpoke. of ian .aeronaut's .first im
pressions. He said the impression of a
first ascension was very much as it the
earth were sinking away from you. There
was no vertigo at all, but one was bewil
dered by the strange ; appearance of the
view beneath. It sank away from you
and appeared nat ; a lew thousand; leet
higher-and it seemed to be coneave so
that the impression was always as if vou
were in the middle .of two concaves. This
was because we were looking from a
rarer medium into a denser1; the effect-was
precisely that ot looking at a stick stuck
into the waters-it appeared bent. It was
perfectly possible to see the earth by night
at a distance of a mile high. There was
always an impression -of profound still
ness and grandeur as one rose high above
the earth. It aroused the mind aud made
it quicker in its action. . The rea'jon for
the absence 01 vertigo was ine enure re
moval of the sense of attraction to the
earth. One soon felt at home, and when
landing, if the balloon touched a tree, one
felt very much like steppmg on. . The
clouds, said he, were- perfect sounding-
boards ; above them the sound of artillery
was heard no more thah if it were a pistol
, . 1 . - - -. 3 . 1 . i 1 ; .
shot, but if it were unde the clouds it
sounded with wonderful 'effect, the
clouds sent back an echo with wonderful
distinctness when theballoon was in' the
midst of them , and the professer thought
that the sound of thunder was due to this
power of the clouds to Te-eChor' When
the professor first , began"' the' practice of
aerostatics there was no gas, and he aid
not know what the ozone was which he
smelled when evolving ; gas from water.
This ozone he had often inhaled when up
in the evening.
The next subject considered ' was the
danger of explosions. No. one was ever
in 1 urea bv the explosion ot a balloon, un
one occasion at Easton, Pa., the speaker
determined to try bursting the balloon
He tied the neck up so that he could do so
if he wished. ' He had got up above, the
elouds, and found that the time when he
must burst it was approaching. The bal-
loon was then full, and was up about two
miles and a half. He looked at his watch
and made a note that his courage failed
him. The watch had just been put in
his pocket when the balloon buret. , Lie
fell fast until the air was packed into
the top, and it had to stop. It began to
vibrate fearfully, and as ho found himself
descending into the woods he threw out
ballast, and descended all right in aclover
field.-He tried the experiment again m
Philadelphia, created an artificial cloud,
made up of a mixture of lampblack and
wool-ashes. Went up two miles and burst
the balloon. It ripped from top to hot-
torn, but it fell gradually and he alighted
without danger on what are now the Cen
tennial grounds.
The next point to be considered, said
Prof. Wise, is the ouestion of transatlan
tic ballooning,!, and, said ie, V I shout!
nave solved tue pro mem nau 11 uuu ueeii
for the second Boston fire." It has been
distinctly proved that there was such a
thing as an easterly 1 current. The upper
ascensions which the speaker had made,
in thirty-nine of them the balloon- had
gone easterly after it had got' above the
clouds. The time would come when cities
would be illuminated . by ., balloons. A
two-horse Baxter engine could - generate
an electric light which could light the
whole city it suspended by a copper
balloon which could be kept up indefi
nitely.
Mr. Wise closed with an earnest, appeal
for a recognition of aerial navigation as a
science, lie felt that the time was coming
when the navigation of the air would be
as much a matter of course as the naviga
tion of the sea. A man had as much
right to sail through the air as on the
water. A plane inclined to the air at the
proper angle will mount upward. ' A Chi-1 board ' the biamese' ship yueen 01 n,n

Domestic Critics.
xour domestic critic is always your
very intimate mend.
You perhaps remember that a certain
wise man of ancient times prayed to be I
delivered from his friends, and when we
loon bade thoughttully over our experi
ence we cannot help concluding that his
was a very sensible petition.
x our domestic critic is generally a !
woman. Men there are who are possessed
of precisely her characteristics, and who
exercise them in
them in their own appointed
sphere, but it is not of them we are writ-
ing. We have at present to do only with
the female critic.

ing hopes you have had time to set things
to rights, and she brings her work, and is
delighted to see you, and seats herself in

and commences her tidy -knitting; for
your domestic critic does not carry out
sewing much, to any great extent.. She
likes knitting because it affords her such
a free use of her eyes in other directions.
She takes in your household arrange
ments at a glance. She sees the spot of
grease on the strve-hearth and the bone
which you gave the dog for his breakfast
under the table, and she notices the place
where the wall-paper is off by the looking-glass,
and she sees the dirty table
cloth sticking out of the side drawer
where you hastily crammed it when you
saw her coming.
You hurry through your work and in
vite her into the sitting-room. She ferrets
out another creaky rocking-chair, and pulls
up the shade for more light, and settles
herself for business.
She squints at your carpet and spies out
the very place where you darned it last
spring, and flattered yourself that you had
done it so nicely that it would never be
observed ; and she asks you why you do
not use black pepper for moths? It looks
so bad to see a carpet moth-eaten! it really
spoils the beauty ot a room to have a bad
place in the carpet! It is a thousand pities
your should have been injured right there
in that particular spot oetore tne nau-
door just where everybody cannot help
noticing it !
You put on your new spring suit which
you thought, and which your dressmaker
thought, so elegant and such a perfect fit,
and your critic scrutinizes it with a keen
eye. It hangs a little too full in front,
she tells you, and the braid on the bottom
is rather light; it will draw in horribly
after it is wet! You ought to have shrunk
it beiore it was put on!
Then she feels the material ot the dress
and assures you that it is lovely but that
it win "cockle" dreadiuiiy. uousin

HANG UP THE BABY'S STOCKING.
Hang up the baby's stocking;
Be sure vou dont forget-
The dear little dimpled darling!
She never saw Christmas yet;
For I've told her all about it,
And she opened her big blue eyes,
And I'm sure she understood it.
She looked so funny and wise.
Dear! what a tiny stocking!
It doesn't take much to hold
Such little pink toes as baby's
Away from the frost and cold.
But then, for the baby's Christmas
It never would do at all;
Why, Santa wouldn't be looking .
For anything half 60 smaUl
I know what we'll do for baby,
I've thought of the very best plan
I'll borrow a stocking of grandma,
The longest that ever f can ;
- And you'll hang it by mine, dear mother.
Bight here in the corner, so,
And write a letter to Santa
And fasten it over the too. .
Write: " This is the Baby's stocking
That hangs in the corner here;
You never have seen her, Santa,
For she only came this year.
But she's just the blessedest bf.by
And now, before you go,
Ju6t cram her stocking with goodies
From the top clean down to the toe." - -
THE OLD SEXTON'S
LUCJET
THOUGHT.
Dolly Hackett, who lived with her
parents in the pretty town of Bellmead,
was one of the dearest little children you
ever saw as pretty as a pink, and every
one in town knew her and loved her. She
was a very sociable little body, and felt it
a duty as well as a pleasure to visit her
neighbors at least once a day; and, though
slie was only three years old, she would sit
down in the most old-fashioned way and
gossip as busily as one of h'er older sisters
might. "!--:
After sitting some time in one neigh
bor's house, chatting away busily about
this and that, telling all the news she had
gathered and getting what other news she
could, she would say:
" Well, you must 'scuse me. I've dot to
do and see Mrs. Brown, 'cause I hasn't
seen her since yesterday."
Then she would go to some other house
and do the same thing. Sometimes she
would tell things that the neighbors did
not want to have known ; but she was so
" cunningj" every one- said, that they for
gave it. They all said she was " a little
dear," and she went round from place to
place like a butterfly.
She was in fact a little busybody, with
a finger in everybody's mesai ana often
she would be gone from Borne half a day
at a time on her visits without causing
alarm. She was such a' grave and prudent
little thing that her parents had no cause
for fear; and when gone the longest she
would come home and tell them every
place she had visited and all that she had
said, heard or suspected. It had rained
one summer morning, and she could not
make her usual calls till the afternoon ;
and then she left her home, from which
moment she was missing. About the time
that she should have returned her mother
went to the door, but could see nothing of
her. Then she went to the nearest neigh
bor's to see if she was there ; but the
neighbor had not seen her. She felt a little
yTJt
uneasy, and when an hour had passed ana
" - . . . .
sent all over the place to una ner, but
could not. Then there was a rallying of
everybody to find the little wanderer. -
There had been lor a month a. band 01
gypsies on the outside of Bellmead, and
. ,ft th - c&mT that verv after-
7 ,-I zl P1..1.7.h .L
noon, going away very hastily; and the
people were afraid that the gypsies had
stolen the little pet. They searched the
woods, dragged the lakes, looked into
wells, and went into all sorts 01 places ;
but could find no trace of the child.
When it became dark they tied a lantern
to the neck of a big dog, and he ran here
and there, so that if she saw the light she
might cry out ; but they heard no cry from
her. Then they went shouting through
the woods for the purpose of letting her
know they were near ; but there was no
reply.
Then they knew the gypsies had got
her, and people went off on horseback in
several directions to fry to overtake them.
But they returned without nnding them,
and everybody was-very sad to think that
they might not see their dear little neigh
bor any more, while her parents and sis
ters were almost crazy with their grief.
There never was a more afflicted town,
and everybody sat up to talk the matter
over ana prepare for a new search in
the morning.
Old Mr. Clapper, the sexton, who had
rung the village bell for church for more
than thirty years, had been very busy in
the search, for the little girl was a great
favorite of his. He had tied the lantern to
the dog's neck, which was a bright idea,
and had made himself very tired. It was
with a sad heart he took his way home
about midnight, recalling in his mind
what a lovely little fairy Dolly was, and
almost crying as he moved along.
His wife met him with a very mourn
ful face, and, after talking the matter over
for a little while, they prepared 10 re
tire. A moment after the old sexton nad
laid down he started suddenly up on his
elbow. - ;
" What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Clap
per.
".Nothing," he replied, nui anjjr
moment he leaped out of bed and began
hastily to dress himself, making all sorts -
ot ria:culovls mistakes, by getting his
l i,-i,. i,;,l nsrt rwfnrn and ar.tinff aa
clothes on hind part before and acting as
if he were crazy. -
" What is the , matter?" ms wue re
peated. .
" Nothing," he replied again. " I've
got to go down to the church. I I I
have forgot something."- s s '
As soon as he was dressed he lighted
his lantern and started out of the door as
fast as he could run. He ran all the way
to the church, which, however, was only
a short distance, and, without stopping to
breathe, he unlocked the door and went
other, swinging his lantern, which made
great shadows on the ceiling and walls,
mi 8t last he came to a big, comfortable
in. He movea up one aisie miu uuwu mo
new. and there he saw. all rolled up in a
ilfiftT) on the cushioned seat, little Dolly,
sleeping as sweetly as if Bhe were in her
own bed. The good old man's heart al-
most rose up into his throat as he saw the
sigUt . an(i this explained the secret of his
qUeer conduct. As he laid his head on
Ujg pillow he remembered that- the choir
had been rehearsing in the church that
very afternoon, and he thought :" What
if ihe little gin haa wauuereu in mere
and got shut in ?" Full of this thought,
no wonder he acted as he did.
I Without waking her he rushed for the
I ViAll-mrm- and the sound of the bell called
1 out everybody in Bellmead, who went to
the church to learn What was uie maiier.
Mr. Hackett, Dolly's father, came first;
and all the sexton said to him, as he pulled
away, was: "Look in Deacon Smiths
pew!" ' ' ,
Then such a time as tney awx anu oucu
rejoicing. VV liy, t ounii 01 j uiy was nom
ing compared to it. The little girl was
taken up, sleeping as she was, and carried
home in her father's arms, with-the whole
town following after, and when they ar
rived the old minister, who was among
them, knelt down and thanked God. B.
