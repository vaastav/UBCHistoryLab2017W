Special Washington Correspondence.
The, coming- tngother of the member
of congress for their regular session
brings to Washington home interesting
news from till part of the country.
The average member of congress is a
better barometer in relation to the con
dition in his own state and district
than perhaps any other man, and when
you get an aggregation of members
from all parts of the country you get
an excellent view of conditions in this
gr at country of ours.
And they come with very favorable
reports. Whether from the north or
south, the Atlantic seaboard, the MIs
r'fslppl valley, or the 1'en nsylvanla
elope, there nre reports of improved
condition!.
Increased earnings among- farmers,
increased earnings by railroads and
railroad men, Increased earnings among
manufacturers; these nre the reports
which members bring- from every part
of the country. From Kansas alone
comes nn oillcial report placing- the
value of farm products in that state this
year at over $('.0,000,000, nn increase of
more than 30 per cent., as compared
vtith last year, while the reports of
mortgages cancelled in that and nil of
Ihe farming- slates nre equally gratifying-.
From the manufacturing and
mining- sections the reports nre quite
ns favorable. Members from the manu
facturing sections of New l'ngland and
the Ohiovalley report large increases
In the number of people employed, and
that an increase in wages is now also being-
had In many cases. Naturally the
ilrst effect of n protective tariff is to in
crease the number of people employed,
and it is not until the second stae of its
work has been reached that the effect
is felt in the Increase in wages. That
Ih now making- itself npparent, for re
ports of Increased wages comes not
nlone from the manufacturing' centers,
but from the great iron mines of Penn
sylvania, Michigan and el-ewhere, and
from other industries of this character
In the Ohio valley.
One subject for which members of
congress of both parties are looking1
with interest is- the Matcment of Sena
tors Pet tig-re w. Mantle and Dubois, who
liurried away from Washington at the
close of the special session to visit Ja
pan. It was unnoiinccd that their ob
ject in making- this trip was to examine
into the causes which led Japan to aban
don the silver standard and fall in line
with the progressive gold standard
nations of the world. Japan, it will be
remembered, was a shining-example of
free silver prosperity during1 the discus
sions of is'.to. and no single Incident
fince the defeat of 1 '. m much dis
turbed the silver advocates as the los
of Japan from their list of silver stand
ard countries. It was because of this
fact that the silver advocates scurried
away to interview these Yankees of the
orient, and find out just how they had
been "taken in" by the gold schemers
of Kurope. These p-etitlemen, although
they returned from Japan weeks ago,
have been absolutely silent, and their
coming- to Washing-ton is looked for
ward to with 'much interest, as there
will be a disposition on the part of mem
bers of both parties to Insist upon either
n definite report, or an explanation of
their silence. The fact that they have
had nothing to say since they returned
Is considered, to say the least, sugg-es-tive
of failure to find in Japan any suf
ficient argument in support of their
silver theory. , . .
Another subject which interos s
members of 00 egress much on their
return is the announcement that all
American prisoner in Cuba have now
been set at liberty.. It will be remem
bered that this administration, wl.n
It came into office nine months ng.
found that very large number o.
American citizen were confined in ( n
ban prisons, and had been so confined
in many cases for months. Within less
Ihnn a single month many of these
were released, and now congress finds
upon reassembling that through the
firm but conservative coune of the ad
ministration every American citien
who was thus confined In Cuban pris
ons and had been so confined for
months, if not years, has been set at
liberty. This fact Is already having
its effect in modifying1 the disposition
on the part of certain people to criticise
the course of the ndministratio.i in re
gard to Cuban affairs and to bad ton
feeling- that the president and his ad
iers"lf permitted to carry out their
plans will shape the matter In a sat
is fac' or v w ay.
The operations of the tariff law .lur
ing the four months since congress
plat ed it -upon the rtatute books and
left U to begin lis career in the face
of Xlverse conditions have been very
satisfactory. With $lon.O iO.ih'O worth
of surplus foreign Importations upon
the markets of the rountry the condi
tio) In which It enferi d upon its work
were, of course, extremely unfavorable.
In the face of that f ne t. however, it
earnings have steadily Increased, be
ginning with a little over l,.noo,o.M) i
it first month, and now reaching more
tr.vn $2. 000, 000 in November, in rne't
month since the tariff bill was placed
upon the statute books the earnings
have increased, anil the treasury olli
ials who have been studying- the n-v
Inw carefully nre thoroughly satisfied
with ifs prospects ns a revenue pro
ducer. Probably no man In the trc:.
ury department is better capable to
judge of these matters than Assistant
Secretary Howell, who has grown u;
In the customs service from a subordi
nate position to the position which he
Iiovv holds -assistant secretary of thi
treasury. He says frankly that he
think the earnings of the ne law wli.
be sufiicitnt after the opening month
of the coming year to meet running
expenses. "The enormous stock of
sugar, wool and other articles which
had been brought into the country be
fore the new law went Into effect," frald
Mr. Jlovvell, talking- to your corre
spondent, "will have been pretty well
used.up by the end of the present year,
and the Importations will be resumed.
When this is done I think the earning-
of the new law will be very satisfac
tory. We nre now petting- $:.'.000,000
a month, and the revenue from sugar
alone will be about $3,r00,0)0, while thf
increase from other sources will alsob
ery considerable. So, it seems to me,
that congress when it looks over the
field and sees what the new law lias
done, and what It Is likely to do in the
near future, will have no occasion to
regret its action or to enter upon any
further revenue legislation at present
at least." CharlcH I). King-.
t-7"Free traders vv ho expected support
for their peculiar views from the 1'ng
lish statistician, Mulhall, will be disap
pointed to know that he has taken pains
to point out the fact that the importa
tions of the United States have in
creased three times as fast as has her
population during- the protective tariff
period. Mr. Mulhall shows in a recently
published article that while the in
crease In. population in the past L'O years
has been 5S per cent., tjic inorens. in the
value of exportation has been 17." per
cent., ami practically all that under a
high protective tariff.
CThe anxious public has not yet
heard from those silver senators who
went to Japan a few months ago to find
cut just how it was that the "gold
powers" had managed to induct the
Ynnkecs of the orient to abandon the
silver standard. Probably they are reserving-
that information for the exclu
sive use .f Mr. Pry an during his visit
to Mexico, so that he may rdvise tho
statesmen of that country how to es
cape the fate of the Japanese, and of
nil ihe other intelligent nations which
hae joined the gold standard In the last
quarter of a cent ury.
C '? Candidate Pryan took occasion
In hi.s St. Louis speech to reiterate hU
adherence to the new-found principles
of democratic faifh, government by in
junction, nni-trut legislation, and ar
bitration in behalf of labor. Somebody
has taken occasion to look up hi" rec
ord dining the four years In which h
served in congress, and finds that dur
ing; all that time, in which he had op
portunity to indicate in a practical was'
his friendship for these subjects, he did
not open his lips in regard to them or
take any steps officially or otherwise
In their behalf.
EJ"And now word comes that China
Is contemplating- an abandonment of
the silver standard ami a falling' in line
with flu progressive nations of th
earth in flu- adoption of the gold stand
ard. If this thing keeps U much
longer, Senator Teller will have no f ur
thcr use for his elaborate argument in
which he holds that the United States
cannot maintain her commercial rela
tions with other parts of the world in
competition with tin nations having' a
currency made of n cheaper metal than
that upon w hi h ours is based.
C 7" 1 1 must be u disappointment to
those low tariff advocates w ho w ere expecting-
to disturb the political atmos
phere with groans about increased
prices to find that tin net average In
crease in juices of article affected by
importation is under the Dingley law
less than one per cent., while the in
creased earnings of those employed In
the manufacturing industries and in
n g 1 ictilt urc, w hit h depend largely upon
industrial net iv Ity, haw been far great
er than that.
C Those- 13 foreign nations whoo
representatives made protests against
certain feat u 11 s t if the hi ngley hill dur

not yet made good their "bluff" to ex
clude American products. On the con
trary, their pun liases from us have in
creased percent, sine the enactment
tif tin Dingley law, while that measuie
has been followed by a reduction f 1
xt cent, in our import at ions fi'iim those

crihe recent visit of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier to Washington in behalf of
closer relations between the I'nited
Slates and Canada is anothir evidence
that the "protests" against our tariff
was inertly a bluff and that we have
gained standing- in the eyes of other
count l ies by protecting our own, dc
Fpitc the fact that numerous protests

Jororao Kern Mot Death at a Ro
vcnt'olul Woman's Hands.
Drllluh l'nlr I'oHfesst-M Ills Murilrr
Ilc Wiu the Author of llrr Kulu,
and 0iMa-d llrr Murrlaitv
lu Ilia Sua,
Waverly, la., Dec. 0. Delilah Fulei
has torn aside the veil that shrouded
the tragic death of Jerome Kern. The
man was found dead in a lonely wood on
the 23d of last August, and the young
woman now confesses that she fired the
bullets that let out his life blood. Her
terrible story one of vengeance for an
irreparable wrong vvus placed before
the grand jury.
As a result of her confession, which
corroborates that of her lover, William
Kern, the ton of the murdered man, the
grand jury of Hrcmcr county returned
into court Wednesday afternoon with
an Indictment charging- Delilah Tales
with murder in the first degree. She
was immediately arraigned before
Judge Clyde, and given 2t hours in
which to plead. She says that idic will
plead g'uilty to-day and ask for imme
diate sentence. She will not ask for
ami tloes not expect mercy.
The murderess Is apparently careless
of results. She only prays that swift
punishment be meted out to her. Put
there are mitigating- circumstances
that will arouse in many breasts throbs
of pity and compassion. Though Miss
Kales hived William Kern, who has be
trayed her into the hands of justice,
she hated his father, her victim, ami
not without good and sufficient cause.
When she wan a mere child of 1'J
years she charges that the elder Kern
accomplished her ruin, ami ihat ever
after he harassed her with his atten
tions. More than that, he sought by
blackening her reputation, as she
states, to keep others from paying
court to her. Twice before she became
attached to the murdered man's son
she had been in n fair way to become
happily married, but as many times
had Jerome Kern poisoned herloveis
against her by his venomous scandals.
At last, when by the same method he
sought to prevent his son from marry
ing her, the pent-up hatred of years
vented itself in the commission of the
dark crime.
Mis Kales' confession covers about
ten closely written pages. It starts hv
telling t.f the love affair of herself anil
young Kern, ami of the opposition of
the father. They discussed the ques
tion of putting him out of the way, and
they agreed that that would be the best
way out of their difficulties. One day
the elder Kern suggested to the young
woman that she meet him. She saw
here th opportunity that she had beer,
waiting for, and she assented, making'
an appointment for the following-morning-
In the woods through which
she usually drove on her way to the
creamery. They met. and he' assisted
her to alight from her vehicle. She
continues:
"He wns on Ms Itnrs befnro mo I saw
my ehaneo to kill Mm. I l,nd the rVvolvr
Just Insl.lo my nMt. which vvns button.-.
up. As lie w as ktif t lint' there I pulled
revolver out and xhot him fjulekly In the
chot. He whirled round on Ms knrrs n
llttlo wnvs. and an he fell forward I shut
Mm In the rlnht slt. of the back. After
thu llrst shot he said: 'Kile'-somet Mrnr
1 don't know vvhnt: I couldn't understand.
I don't know whether his clothes caught
llr or net. I hurried nwny.
"I killed Mm with premeditation find de
liberation. I prayed (bd to nlve me
strin:th to do It with all the ea rncst nr.xs
tfint I could command, as 1 have prayed
lllm for foiK'lvt tit ss. I have surTYrtd no
patiKs of confidence. On the contrary, a
restful calm set tiled to come Into my Hf,.
from the moment I knew lie was dead. I
never slept so well ns I did the nlht nfler
I tired those fatal shots."
Then follows a detail of the plotting
of the two to lay the crime at the door
ttf John Lewis, a former lover of De
lilah's. They even prepared a letter
purporting- to have been written by the
deceased on the day of his murder, am!
which was left where it would be read
ily found, as it was a few days ago.
This letter said that If harm came to
Kern, Lewis must be held responsible.
illiam Kern's eonfes.sion corroborates
that of Miss Kales in almost every tle
ti'.il. I'ublit- feeling- seems at present to
be In favor of t.he woman, but there Is
bitter denunciation of her scheme to
involve an innocent man in the dreadful
a 'fair.

Wushlngtou, Dec. 9. The house com
mittee on banking and curren
cy, which will havo the shap
Ivg of a considerable portion
ot the financial legislation before
the house, held ita flrvt meeting Wednes
day morning and outlined its general
plan of action. In vis-.v of Secretary
(Jage'i recommendation of a compre
hensive revision of currency and bank
ing affairs, a resolution was adopted
lavitlng the secretary to embody his
view in a bill. The committee was
Informed that the secretary was now
at work on a measure and that it would
be available in about a week.
Chairman Walker announced four
subcommittees and assigned to tach a
number of the banking and currency
bills already Introduced. The sub
committees w ill begin work at once on
the bills before them, each subcommit
tee having charge of the bills intro
duced by its members as follows:
The Valktr suhcommlttrw will have
rtiftrtce of th Walker Mil. which hss at
tracted cnnsldrrntdo attention In tar.klnij
circles. It proposes to Introduce the New
l'ngland Suffolk hank system to the whole
country, addlns a Kovernment Kuaruntee
for all notes lasut d by hanks and Imposing
a small tax on hank note as a safety fund.
Tho bill of Mr. J 1 i 1 1 also goes before thli
committee. It provides for an Inert hm? of
bank circulation to the pur value of bonds
deposited; reduces tho taxation on circula
tion to one-fourth of one per cent.; pro
vides for the estuhllshmt nt of small hanks
In rural cumin unities, and does uwny with
tho free l-sue and v. It hdru wnl of nat lonul
bank notes. Kxeept In the last particular
tha Huthor of t tie bill Tefls that he Is In
line with President MeKlnley's recent cur

committee. The main cne Is irctit-rnlly
known ns the "Carlisle 1 .111." which was
originally urged by John (3. Ca 1 lisl? when
he was secretary of the treasury.
The UroHlus subcommittee will probably
deal with secretary Oage's plan of curren
cy nnd banking reform. A bill on tho name
lines has been Introduced by Mr. Mlti-lu-ll
N. Y.). a member of the ubeommlttee.
Its essential feature Is to separate the
funds of t tie government Into two branches,
one relating to fiscal expenditures und tho
other relating to the hroiidi r monetary af
fairs of tho country, the I'etaSls being
much the name as those outlined by Mr.

subcommittee, also has a romprehenNlvo
measure of currency reform. It covers the
features which Mr. Hill sought to have re
ported Wednenday and also a separate re

Tort in Prince, llayti, Dec. 8.The
trouble between Germany ami llayti
appeari to be settled. The Haytian
government has saluted the German
Hag and the foreigners who had sought
rtfuge on board ships in this harbor
have returned to their homes.
It is understood that t he question of
tho indemnity demanded by Germany
for the alleged Illegal arrest and Im
prisonment of Ucrr Kmil Lueders, a
German subject, has been settled to ths
satisfaction of Germany und that all
the demands of that country have been
agreed to by the government of llayti,
in face of the display of force made
by Germany and uudcr the threat of
a bombardment of the defensive works
of the port unless these demands were
agreed to within the eight hours fol
lowing the time the German ultimatum
was delivered Monday morning, short
ly after the arrival at this port of the
two German cruisers sent to back up
the demands of the German milliliter
here. Count Schwerin.
The first part of the settlement to.ik
place at six o'clock Monday night, when
the Haytian fleet formally nalutcd the
German flag from the flagship of the
licet of llayti, the Crete-a-Pierrot, a
small vessel of 010 tons, armed with a
few guns of light caliber. Admiral
Kilit-k, the Haytian commander, had
charge of the formal salute of the Ger
man tlag. While the Hag of the republic
was being dipped on board the Crete-a-Pierrot
to the standard of Germany the
band of the Haytian navy played the
German national anthem and the Hay
tian flagship fired 21 guns, which were
answered by the German flagship, the
Charlotte, width Is used us a school
ship.
The second part of the set tlcment of
the trouble between Germany ami
llayti took place Tuesday morning-,
when Count von Sohwcriu, the German
minister to llayti, w as formally nnd sol
emnly received by the llav tian ollicials.
The latter, it is understood, have ns-t-ured
the German authorities that sum
mary justice will be promptly meted
nut to those of the ofl'miaN of llayti
who caused the cstranrremrnt between
the republic and Germany.
The citizens of llayti are very much
dissatisfied over the outcome, ami there
Is Intense excitement here. Members of
the Preiich colony are tin board Pretich
vessels in the harbor, German residents
have taken refuge on the German ves
sels, while the P.nglish are on the Atlas
line steamers. There are no American
vessels in the harbor, though the Mar
blehead is expected, ami American resi
dents have placed themselves under the
protection of the American minister,
ar.d have taken all their most valuable
property to the legation for safe keep-

London, Dec, 8. Walter Croot, of
Newcastle, l'ngland, who was defeated
for the bantam weight championship
of the world at the .National Sporting
club Montlay night by Jimmy P.arry.of

A PATHETIC SCENE.
I-narlril nt the Ileilsl.tr of the I'rval
dent's 1)Iiih Miillirr.
Cautou, O., Dec. 8. -Once more the
childrtn of Nancy Allison McKinley
have gathered about her couch, made
acred by her tenacious struggle
against death. The reunion is com
plete. The president arrived before the
death angel made his visit and took
with him the spirit of the aged mother.
With the children were other rela
tives, among whom was the aged sis
ter of Mrs. McKinley, Mrs. Abigail Os
borne, mother of Consul W. M. Os
borne. The scene was a pathetic ono that
beggars description. In the midst of it
all there was is joy unspeakable
in the breast of the presidenL lie
had again been permitted to tee
his mother alive. He had an
swered all the obligations of his coun
try, lie had fulfilled his vows to his
people. He had witnessed the assem
bling of congress, and had been cheered
with the news at the snme time that his
mother was better.
In the midst of the deep sorrow of this
family there Is n feeling of joy. Tho
fondest hopes the family has cherished
since the aflliction came was that the
president might be permitted to b
present when the Inevitable dissolution
came and that the mother might again
realize his presence. These hopes haffj
been granted them and they now pa
tiently and resignedly await the end.
The scene in the sickroom when tho
president arrived was touching ami
pathetic. Quietly, under the power ol
the remarkable self-control he is at all
times nhh to exert, lu gazed upon tho
sweet and dearly beloved face, show
ing only an emotion of joy when the
mother's eyes opened and her face
lighted up with a smile of recognition
and of greeting'. Then, as he stooped
to kiss ami caress her, he felt the tender
entwining of her arm about his neck,
the aim that soothed him in childhood
and has a thousand times been his main
stay In times of. trouble that arm,
though weakened by paralysis, was
raised ami placed about the neck of her
beloved son.
The president ami Mrs. McKinley, to
gether with other relatives from the
cast, came early In the morning, the
latter part of the journey being mado
on a rpecial train. They were taken to
the homestead as rap-idly as possible,
ami ns they entered the sickroom Miss
Iltlen McKinley said: "Mother, hero
are William and Ida." The president
w as jit the bedside and. stooping over,
kissed the wan face. It was then that
the most distinct rally of the Illness
came. Then tin enfeebled arms encir
cled ami caressed the son of whom sho
said :
"lie wtit a good boy. I hope he will
'.u as good a president."
At 11:. 10 Mother McKinley was rest
ing easily. Dr. Phillips at his lard visit
reported that she was resting easier
than any time during th? day,

Madrid, Dec. 8. The cabinet on
Tuesday considered dispatches from
Senor Do Lome, Spanish minister at
Washington, containing' extracts fiom
President McKinley's message to con
gress. The ministers agreed in consid
ering the message generally favorable
to Spanish interests. Its tone has pro
duced a good effect In oflicial circles;
but it is pointed out that "the para
graphs relating- to the alleged rights of
the United States to intervene In the
Cuban tpiestinn are calculated to dis
please the Spanish people."
The message pleasantly surprised the
majority tif Spaniards, who hardly ex-
pectrd that President McKinley would
go so far in his approval tif the new
colonial policy or his recognition c-f
Spain's right to be allowed the time
necessary to carry out the same. They
are especially satisfied to fee the
United State executive state so power
fully the precedents in international
law regarding belligerency and dis
claim any intention of interfering with
Spain's rights. They are less satis
fied with the censure pased tin the pre
vious coloiiKil policy and with the con
tention that tlie I'nited States has tried
to cheek filibusters. Spain declines to
admit this contention, but on the whole
the prevalent impression Is thabl'rcsl
dent McKInley's attitude is more fa
vorable than was President Grant's in
the former Cuban insurrection. Finan
cial and political circles we Iconic tho
prospect of less tension between Spain
and the United States ami of a truco
