thrust into the routine testimony at the
impeachment rial of Judge Robert W.
Archbald, of the commerce court today
gave the senate :i moment of excite
ment and brought down on May's head
the censure of Senator A. O. Bacon,
the presiding officer. Mays exclama

of his alleged misuse of judicial pow

May, who is the general manager of
the Erie roads subsidiary to the Hill
side Coal & Iron company, as to mo
tive for recalling the contract for the
sale of the Katydid culm dump which
had been sent to a prospective buyer
secured through E. J. Williams, a busi
ness associate of Judge Archbald. May
said he recalled the contract because
he had received letters containing not
ices of the claims of others interested
in the dump. Worthington remarkei
to the witness the claim had been made
that these letters were ficticious, the
real reason for withdrawing the con
tract was the tip about the Washing
ton investigation of Judge Archibald's
conduct.
' If that claim is made, its a lie"
shouted May. Senator Bacon imme
diately cautioned him that .such lang
uage must not be used in the senate
chamber, whereupon May apologized.

Message Says He Will
Not Occupy Legislators'

Favoring Protection.
associated PRESS dispatchJ
WASHINGTON. Dec. 6. President
Taft will make no further effort to
have congicss reduce the tariff. In
a "general" message to congress sub
mitted today, 'he president clearl
indicated his intention of leaving
further tariff revision to Mr. Wlsson
and the congivss just elected.
"Now that a new congress has
been elected on a platform of tariff
fur revenue only rather than a pro
tective tariff and is to revise the
tariff on that basis." said the pres
ident, "it is needless for me to oc
cupy the time of congress with ar
guments or recommendations in fa
vor of a protective tariff."
This message, the second submitted
by the president since the present
session began, will be his last of a
general character. It dealt with ev
ery department of the government
except the state department, recom
mended much of the lesgislation
which Mr. Taft previously had urged
upon the attention of congress, and
took up and discussed at length
several subjects comparatively new.
Mr. Taft came out strongly against
independence for the Philippines pro
posed, he said, in a bill now. beforo
congress. He deprecated the new
policy of one battleship a year in
stead of two; and indorsed again
the scheme of currency reform pro
posed by the National Monetary
Commission.
Conservation was lightly touched,
the president recommending the
amendment of bills now before con
gress so that water companies which
dam navigable rivers will contribute
to the improvement of these streams
He declared that no radical change

Governors Calculated to

Governors of All States
Will He Asked to Ap

Enact Measures Provid

ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH
RICHMOND. Va., Dec. 6. The fifth
annual governors' congress adjourned
here late today to meet informally to
morrow President Taft at Washington
to discuss rural credits. The congress
will meet next year at Colorado
Springs. The governors ' adopted a
resolution intended to sound the knell
of the ' time-honored mortgages on
farms and pressage the advent of a
new financial era for farmers.
The resolution is intended to lead to
the establishment of a new system of
state banks to be governed by a nui
form state law. The banks, under the
iesolution are to be financied by priv
ate capital and be able to issue bonds
on short or bfng terms upon American
farms in lieu of mortgages.
Myron T. Herrick, ambassador to
France, addressed the conference upon
this topic, as President Taft's represen
tative and said that thrifty people of
France and other European countries
are ready to invest their savings on
these securities.
The resolution provides the appoint
ment of a committee of five governors
to draft th" plan of a bill covering the
ground. The bill must be submitted to
the governor of each state In the union
and upon the approval of two-thirds
of the executives will be sent to the
legislatures of the various states for
enactment.
The conference unanimously repudi
ated today the recent utterances of
Governor Please, of South Carolina,
concerning the lynching of negroes. Fy
a vote of 14 to 4 it adopted a resolu
tion declaring against mob violence
an-d advocating the importial enforce
ment of the law. Four of the gover
nors, who opposed the resolution, de
ciared themselves as strongly endors
ing the purpose of it, but voted "No"
because they thought they had no right
to reprimand their colleague. Governor
Please himself, a target of attack, hot
ly defended his convictions, snapped
his fingers in the face of his col
leagues, told them "go to it" and said
the resolutions would neither keep
him from the governor's chair, nor a
seat in the United States senate. Four
times in as many hours, he asserted,
his life has been threatened because
of his utterance, but this appealed to
Vim as little as the resolution. Four
threatening letters which Governor
Please received were all anonymous.
Please has taken to task a dozen gov ¬
ernors including Hadley, of Missouri,
Goldsborough of Maryland, Dix of New-
York and O'Neil of Alabama.
