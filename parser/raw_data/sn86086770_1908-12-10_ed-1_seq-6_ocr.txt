Washington. —The message of Presi
dent Roosevelt was read in both
houses of congress Tuesday In sub
stance the document was as follows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tative* The financial standing of Ihe
nation at the present time Is excellent,
and the financial management of the na
tion's Interests by the government dur
ing the last seven years has shown the
most sa.isfaofory results. Hut our cur
tney system la Imperfect, and It I* ear
nestly to be hoped that the currency
commission will be able to propose a
thoroughly good system which will do
away with the existing defects.
During the period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 190 X there was an Increase
In the amount of money In circulation of
9902,991,399 The Increase In the per capita
during this period was 17 00. Within this
time there were several occasions when
It was necessary for the treasury de
partment to come l. the relief of the
money market by pur.ha*es or redemp
tions of United Slate* bonds by Increas
ing deposits In national banks; by stim
ulating additional Issues of national bank
notes, and by facilitating Importations
from abroad of gold Our Imperfect cur
rency system hut. made these proceedings
necessary, and they were effective until
the monetary disturbance In the (all of
1907 immensely Increased the difficulty ot
ordinary methods of relief. By the mid
dle of November the available working
balance In the treasury had been reduced
to approximately 95,090,00i, Clearing
house associations throughout the coun
try had been obliged to resort to the
expedient of Issuing clearing house cer
‘flcates, to be used as money. In this
urgency It was determined to Invite
o n . Options fur IBO.oOO.iXMi Panama canal
Ponds, and IIOO.OOO.imX) three per cent
certificates of Indebtedness authorized by
the act of June 13. IX9X, It was proposed
to redeposlt In the national banks the
proceeds of tle-se Issues, and to permit
their use as a haul* for additional circu
lating notes of national bunks The
moral effect of this pro* edure was so
great that It was necessary to Issue only
994.831,9X0 of the Panama bonds and 918.-
00.800 of the certificate* of indebtedness
During the period from July 1, 1901. to
September SO, loos, the balance between
the net ordinary receipt* and the net
ordinary expenses of the government
showed a surplus In Ihe four years 190S.
1903. 1908. and 1907, and a deficit In tfin
year* 1904. 1905, 190*1 and a fractional part
of the fiscal year 1909 The net result
was a surplus of 199,7X3,413 84 The finan
cial operations of thy government during
this period, based upon these difference*
between receipts and expenditures, re
sulted In a net reduction of the Interest
bearing debt of the Polled .States from
9M7.141.040 to 9X97.;: ! 990. notwithstanding
that there hud been two sales of Panama
canal bonds amounting In the aggregate
to 9e4.G31.9Xii, amt an Issue of three per
cent certificates of Indebtedness under
the act of June 13. Ix9x, nmounting to
Refunding operation* of ttie
treasury department under the act of
March 14. I9no. resulted In the conver
sion Into two per rent consol* of 1930 of
9(00,909,400 bonds bearing higher rates of
Interest A decrease of 9 5 .GX7.9M In the
annual Interest charge resulted from
these operations
In short, during the seven year* and
three months there has been a net sur
plus of nearly one hundred millions of
receipt* over expenditures, u reduction
of the Interest-bearing debt by ninety
millions. In spile >f the extraordinary ex
pease of the Panama canal, and a saving
of nearly nine million* on the annual
Interest charge
Control of Corporation*.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged In Interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I ran only ret-eat
what I have already again and again said
In my messages to the congress I be
lieve that under the Interstate clause of
the constitution Ihe United Slate# has
complete and paramount right to con
trol all agencies of Interstate commerce,
and 1 believe that the national govern
ment alone can exercise this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so us both to
•ecure Justice from, and to do Justice to,
the great corporation’, which are the
most Important factors In modern bust
ness I believe that It la worse than
folly to attempt '.o prohibit all com
bination* as Is d< no by Ihe Sherman
anti trust law, localise such a law can
be enforced onto Imperfectly ami un
equally, and Its enforcement works at
moat a* much hardship its good I
etrongly advocate that Instead of an un
wise effort to | rohtblt all combinations,
there shall be substituted a law which
shall expreasly permit combinations
which are In the Interest of the public,
but shall at the same time give to some
agency In the national government full
power of control and supervision over
them One of Ihe chief features of this
control should be securing entire pub
licity In all matters which the public
has a right to kn w, and furthermore,
lb# power, not by Judicial but by ejte Hi
lly* action, to prevent or put a stop to
every form of Improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing
The railways of the country should be
put completely under the Interstate com
merce commission and removed from
the domain of the anti trust lan The
power of ihe commission sleuth! be made
thoroughgoing, so that It could exercise
complete supervision and control over
the Issue of securities as well as over
the raising and lowering of rales A*
regards rates, at least, this power should
be summary . . Rales must be made
as low ns Is compstlble with giving prop
er returns to -ill the employes of the rail
road from Ihe highest to the lowed,
and proper reluru'. I > the shareholder*,
but they must not. for Instance, be re
duced in such fashion a* to necessitate
a cut In the wag,* of the employes or
ths abolition of Ihe proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
Telegraph and telephone companies en
gaged In Interstate business should be
pul under the Jurisdiction f the Inter
state commerce . crnmissum
It la very earnestly to be wished that
our people through their representatives,
should act In this mattei It is to
the Interest of all of us that
there sh*ild be a premium put upon In
dividual Initiative and Individual ca
parity, and an ample reward for the
great directing Intelligences alone com
petent to manage the great business op
erations or to-day. It la well to keep In
mind that exactly as the anarchist Is the
worst enemy of liberty and the reaction
ary the worst enemy of order, so the
men who defend the rights of property
have most to (ear-efrom the wrongdoers
of great wealth, and the men who are
championing popular rights have most
to fear from the demagogues who In the
name of popular rights would do wrong
to and oppress honest business men,
honest men of wealth: for the success of
either type of wrongdoer necessarily In
vite* a violent reaction against the causs
the wrongdoer nominally upholds. . . .
Need of Centralization,
The proposal to make the na
tional government supreme over, and
therefore to give It complete control over,
the rallroa'le and other Instruments of
Interstate commerce Is merely a propos
al to carry out to the letter one of ths
prime purposes. If not the prime purpose,
for which the constitution was founded.
It does not represent centralization. It
represents merely the acknowledgment
of the patent fact that centralization has
already come In business If this Irre
sponslb e outside business power Is to be
controlled in the Interest of the general
public It can only be controlled In one
way; by giving adequate power of con
trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex
erclslng such power -the national govern
ment To abandon the effort for national
control means to abandon the effort for
all adequate control and yet to render like
ly continual bursts of action by state leg
islatures, which cannot achieve the pur
pose sought for, but which can do a
great deal of damage to the corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
There should be regulation by the na
tional government of the great Interstate
corporations. ln< ludlng a simple method
of aci ount keeping, publicity, supervision
of the Issue of securities, abolition of
rebate* and of special privileges There
should be short-time franchises for all
eorporatlons engaged In public business:
including the corporations which get
power from wafer rights There should
be national as well as state guardianship
of mines and forests. The labor legisla
tion hereinafter referred to should con
currently be enacted Into law
To accomplish this, means a certain In
'naae In the use of not the creation of
power, by the central government. The
power already exists, It does not have

whether It shall be used or left Idle—
ami meanwhile the corporations over
which the power ought to be exercised

concentrated, so that no one can be held

Concentrated power Is palpable, visible,

Legislation for Wageworker.
There are many matters affecting labor
ami the status of the wageworker to
which I should like to draw your atten
tion. hut an exhaustive discussion of the
problem In all Its aspects Is not now nec
essary. I believe In a steady ef
fort. or perhaps It would be more
accurate to say In steady efforts
In many different directions, to bring
about a condition of affairs under which
the men who work with hand or with
brain, the laborers, the superintendents,
the men who produce the market and the
men who find a market for the articles
produced, shall own a far greater share
than at present of the wealth they pro
duce, and he enabled to Invest It In the
tools and Instruments by which all work
Is curried on As (nr as possible I hope
to sec a frank recognition of the advan
tages conferred by machinery, organiza

In the ownership by wage- worker of rail

means to Invest his money in stocks.
There must be prohibition of child la

and stock gambling so far as Is possi

progressive Inheritance tax on large
fortunes Industrial education should

should lighten the burden of taxation
on the small man. Wo should put a
premium upon thrift, hard work, and
business energy, but these qualities

ent Industrial system, become killed,
crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular Incidents of e. given busi
ness As far a* concern* those

Urgent Need of Reform.
Our present system, or rather no sys
tem works dreadful wrong, and Is of
benefit to only one class of people the
lawyers When a workman Is Injured
what he needs Is not an expensive and
doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of
relief through Immediate administra
tive action No academic theoiy
about "freedom of contract" or “consti
tutional liberty to contract" should be
permitted to Interfere with this and
similar movements
Pending a thoroughgoing Investiga
tion and action there Is certain legis
lation which should be enacted at once.
The law passed at the laet session of
the congress granting compensation to

all employee of the government and
should be made more liberal In Its

months’ earnings In this respect the
generosity of the United States towards
Its employes compares most unfavora
bly with that of every country In Eu
rope—even the poorest.
I renew my recommendation made In
a previous message that half-holidays
be granted during summer to all wage
workers In government employ .
I also renew my recommendation that
the principle of the eight-hour day
should ss rapidly and as far as practi
cable bo extended to the entire work
being carried on by the government;
the present law Jthould be amended to
embrace contracts on thus. public
works which the present wording of
the act seems to exclude.
Would Double Salaries of Judges.
I most earnestly urge upon the con
gress the duty of Increasing the totally
Inadequate salaries now given to our
Judges On the whole there Is no body
of public servants who do as valuable
work, nor whose moneyed reward is so
Inadequate compared to their work Be
ginning with the eupreme court the
judges should have their eateries dou
bled. It Is not befitting the dignity of
the nation that Its most honored public
servants should be paid sums so email
compared to what they would earn In
private life that the performance of
public service by them Implies an ex
ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.
It is earnestly to be desired that some
method should ho devised for doing
away with the long delays which now
obtain In the administration of justice,
and which operate with peculiar sever
ity against persons of small means, and
favor only the very criminals whom It
Is most desirable to punish. These
long delays In the final decisions of
cases make In the aggregate a crying
evil; and a remedy shouti he devised.
Much of this Intolerable delay Is due
to Improper regard Id to technicali
ties which are a m< . hlnderance to
justice. In some noted iccent cases this
over-regard for technicalities has re
sulted In a striking dental of Justice,
and flagrant wrong to the body politic.
Labor Leaders Criticised.
At the last election certain leaders of
organised labor made a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire judi
ciary of the country, an attack couched
In such terms as to Include the most
upright. honest and broad-minded
Judges, no less than those of narrower
mind and more restricted outlook.
Last year, before the house com
mittee on Judiciary. those same
labor leaders formulated their de
mands. specifying the bill that
contained them, refusing all compro
mise, stating they wished the principle
of that bill or nothing. They Insisted
on a provision that In a labor dispute
no Injunction should Issue except to
protect a property rig, 'it. and specifical
ly provided that the right to carry on
business should not he construed as a
property right; and In a second provis
ion their hill made legal In a labor dis
pute any act or agreement by or be
tween two or more persons that would
not have been unlawful If done by a
tingle person. In other words, this bill
legalized blacklisting and boycotting
In every form, legalizing, for Instance,
those forms of the secondary boycott
which the anthracite coal strike com
mission so unreservedly condemned;
while the right to carry on a business
was explicitly taken out from under
that protection which the law throws
over property. The demand was made
that there should be trial by Jury in
contempt cases, thereby most seriously
Impairing the authority of the courts.
All this represented a course of policy
which, If carried out. would mean the
enthronement of class privilege In Its
crudest anil most brutal form, and the
destruction of one of the most essen
tial functions of the judllcary In all civ
ilized lands.
The violence of the crusade for this
legislation, and Its complete failure.
Illustrate two truths which It Is essen
tial our people should learn. In the
first place, they ought to teach the
workingman, the laborer, the wage
worker. that by demanding what Is Im
proper and Impossible he plays Into the
hands of his foes. Such a crude and
vicious attack upon the courts, even If
It were temporarily successful, would
Inevitably In the end cause a violent
reaction and -uuld hand the great
mass of cltlrens together, forcing them
to stand by all the judges, competent
and Incompetent alike, rather than to
see the w teels of Justice stopped.
The wageworkers, the workingmen,
the laboting men of the country by the
way In which they repudiated the ef
fort to get them to cast their vote* In
response to an appeal to class hatred,
have emphasized their sound patriotism
and Americanism. Such an attitude
Is an object lesson In good citizenship to
the entire nation.
Judicial System Sound.
Our Judicial system is sound and
effective at core, and It remains,
and must ever he maintained. a*
the safeguard of those principles of lib
erty and justice which stand at the
foundation of American Institutions, for.
us Burke finely said, when liberty and
justice are separated, neither Is safe.
There are. however, some members of
the judicial body who have lagged be
hind In their understanding of these
great and vital changes in the body
politic, whose minds have never been
opened to the new applications of the old
principles made necessary by the new
conditions. Judges of this stamp do last
ing harm by their decisions, because they
convince poor men In need of protection
that the courts of the land are pro
foundly Ignorant of and out of sympathy
with their needs, and profoundly Ignorant
or hostile to any proposed remedy. To
such men It seems a cruel mockery to
have any court decide against them on
the ground that It desires to preserve
‘'liberty" In a purely technical form, by
withholding liberty In sty real and con
structive sense
There are certain decisions by various
courts which have beer exceedingly det
rimental to the rights of wage-worker*.
This Is true of all decisions that decide
that men sre, by the constitution, “guar
anteed their liberty" to contract to enter
a dangerous occupation, or to work an
undesirable or Improper number of hours,
or to work In unhealthy surroundings;
and therefore cannot recover damages
when maimed In that occupation, and
cannot be forbidden to work what the
legislature decides Is an excessive num
ber of hours, or to carry on the ork
under conditions which the legislature
decides to be unhealthy Decisions
such ss those nullify the legislative
effort to protect the wage-worker* who
most need protection from those emplov
ers who tase advantage of their grind
ing need. They halt or hamper the move
ment for securing better and more equi
table conditions of labor
There Is also. I think, ground for tha
belief that substantial Injustice is often
suffered by employes In consequence of
the custom of courts Issuing temper\ry
Injunction* without notice to them und
punishing them for contempt of court In
Instance* where, a* s matter of fact,
they have no knowledge of any proceed
ings Organised labor Is chafing
under the unjust restraint which

plan of procedure It* discontent
has heen unwisely exnressed, and
often Improperlv expressed, but there
Is a sound basis for It. and tr or
derly and law-abiding people of a com
munity would he In a fsr stronger posi
tion for upholding the courts tf the un
doubtedly existing abuses could be pro
vided sgslnst
injunction Must Remain.
The power of Injunction I* a great
equitable remedy, which should on no
account bs destroyed. But safeguards
should be erected against Its abuse.
In substance, provision should be made
that no Injunction or temporary re
straining order Issue otherwise than on
notice, except where Irreparable Injury
would otherwise result; and in such case
a hearing on the merits of the order
should be had within a short fixed pe
riod, and. If not then continued after
hearing It should forthwith lapse De
cisions should be rendered Immediately,
and the chance of delay minimised In
every way Moreover. I believe that the
procedure should be sharply defined, and
the Judge required minutely to state the
particulars both of his action and of his
reasons therefor, so that the congress
can If It desires examine and Investigate
the same.
For ptii> of the shortcomings of
Justice in our country our people as a
whole are themselves to blame and the
Judges and Juries merely bear their
share together with the public as a
whole. It Is discreditable to us as a
people that there should be difficulty In
convicting murderers, or In bringing to
Justice man who as public servants
have been guilty of corruption, or who
have profited by the corruption of
public servants. The result Is equally
unfortunate, whether due to hairsplit
ting technicalities In the Interpretation
of law by Judges, to sentimentality and
class consciousness on the part of
Juries or to hysteria and sensational
ism In the dally press For much of
this failure of Justice no responsibility
whatever Ilea on rich men as such. We
who make up the mass of the people
cannot shift the responsibility from our
own shoulders But there is an Impor
tant part of the failure w..ich has spe
cially to do with inability to hold
to proper account men of wealth who
behave badly.
The Modern Corporation.
The huge wealth that has been accu
mulated by a few Individuals of recent
years. In what has amounted to a so
cial and Industrial revolution. Ims been
as regards some of these Individuals
made possible only by the Improper use
of the modern corporation. A certain
type of modern corporation, with Its
officers and agents. Its many Is.- >e of
securities, and Its constant consolida
tion with allied undertakings, finally
becomes an Instrument so complex as
to contain a gr< utcr number of de
ments that, under various Judicial de
cisions, lend themselves to fraud and
oppression than any device yet evolved
In the human brain. Corporations are
necessary Instruments of modern busi
ness. They have been permitted to
become a menace largely because the
governmental representatives of the
people have worked slowly In provid
ing for adequate control over them.
Our great clusters of corpora
tions. huge trusts and fabulously
wealthy multimillionaires, employ the
very best lawyers they can obtain to
pick flaws in statutes after their
passage; but they also employ a class
of secret agents who seek under the
advice of experts, to render hostile
leglsla-lon Innocuous by making It un
constitutional. often through the Inser
tion of what appear on their face to be
drastic and sweeping provisions against
the Interests of the parties Inspiring
them; while the demagogues, the cor
rupt creatur-s who introduce black
mailing schemes to "strike" corpora
tions, and all who demand extreme,
and undesirably radical, measures,
show themselves to be the worst ene
mies of the very public whose loud
mouthed champions they profess to he.
Real damage has been done by the
manifold and conflicting interpretations
01 the Interstate commerce law. Con
trol over the groat corporations doing
Interstate business can be effective only
If It Is vested with full power In an
administrative department, a branch of
the federal executive, carrying out a
federal law. It can never be effective If
a divided responsibility Is left In both
the states and the nation; It can never
be effective if left in the hands of the
courts to be decided by lawsuits.
Respect for Law Must Be Upheld.
The courts hold a place of peculiar and
deserved sanctity under our form of gov
ernment. Respect for the law is essen
tial to the permanence of our Institu
tions. and respect for the law Is largely
conditioned upon respect for the courts.
It Is an offense against the republic to
say anything which can weaken this re
spect, save for the gravest reason and In
the most carefully guarded manner. In no
other nation In the world do the courts
wield such vast and far-reaching power
as In the United States All that Is nec
essary Is that the courts us a whole
should exercise this power with the far
sighted wisdom already shown tiy those
Judges who scan the future while they
act In the present. let them x- r- ise
this great power not only honestly and
bravely but with wise insight Into the
needs and fixed purposes of the people,
so that they may do Justice, and work
equity, so that they may protect all per
sons In their rights, and yet break down
the barriers of privilege, which Is the foe
of right.
Forest Preservation.
If there is any one duty which more
than another we owe It to our children
to perform at once. It Is to save the for
ests of tlds country, for they constitute
the first and most Important element In
tho conservation of the natural re
sources of the country lust as
a farmer, after all his life making his
living from .ils farm, will, if lie is an ex
pert farmer, leave it as an asset of In
creased value to his son, so we should
leave our national domain to our chil
dren. Increased In value and not worn
out. There are small sections of our own
country. In the east and In the west, in
the Ad rondacks, the White mountains
and the Appalachians, and In the Rocky
mountains, where we can already see for
ourselves the damage In the shape of
permanent Injury to the soli and the
river systems which comes from reckless
deforestation. It matters not whether
this deforestation is due to the actual
reckless cutting of timber, to the fires
that Inevitably follow such reckless cut
ting o' timber, or to reckless and uncon
trolled grazing, especially by the great
migratory bunds of sheep, the un
checked wandering of which over the
country means destruction to forests and
disaster to the small home-makers, the
settlers of limited means
Thanks to our own recklessness
In the us of our splendid forests,
we have already crossed the verge of a
timber famine In F Is country, ami no
measures that we now take can. at least
for many years, undo the mischief that
has already been done But we can pre
vent further mischief being done, and it
would be In the highest degree reprehen
sible to let anv consideration of tem
porary convenience or temporary cost
Interfere with such action, especially as
regards the national forests which the
nation can now at this very moment,
control.
The lesson of deforestation in China
Is a lesson which mankind should have
learned many times already from what
has occurred In other places Denuda
tion leaves naked soil; then gullying
cuts down to the bare rock: and mean
while the rock-waste buries the bottom
lands. When the soil Is gone, men
must go. and the process does not take

Plea for Inland Waterway*.
Action should be begun forthwith, dur
ing the present session of the congress,
for the Improvement of our Inland water
ways a. ties which wlil result in gl< ■■.*
us not only navigable but navigated
rivers
Until the work of river Improvement Is
undertaken In a modern way it can not
have results that will meet the needs of
this modern nation Tie plan
which promises the beat and quick
est results Is that of a per
manent commission authorized to co-or
dinate the work of all the government
departments relating to waterways, and
to frame and supervise the execution of
a comprehensive plan. Under such a
commission the actual work of construc
tion might be entrusted to the reclama
tion service: or to the military engineers
acting with a sufficient number of civili
ans to continue the work in time of war;
or It might be divided between the rec
lamation service ami the corps Of en
gineers. Fund* should b provided from
:urrent revenues If It Is deemed wise—
jtherwise from the sale of bonds. The
sssentlel thing is that the work should
go forward under the best possible plan,
and with the least possible delay. The
time for playing with our waterways is
past The country demands results.
The president urges that national
parks adjacent to national forests bo
placed under the control of the forest
service of the agricultural depart
ment; he also points out the benefits
derived from pure food legislation.
The message continues;
Needs of the Secret Service.
Last year an amendment was incor
porated In the measure providing for the
secret service, which provided that there
should be no detail from the secret serv
ice and no transfer therefrom. The
amendment In question was of benefit to
no one excepting to crlmlnnVi, and
it seriously hampers the government In
the detection of crime and the securing
of Justice, The ehlef argument In
favor of the provision was that
the congressmen did not them
selves wish to be Investigated by the
secret service men," Very little of such
Investigation has been done In tho pasf
but It Is true that the work of the secret
service agents was partly responsible for
the Indictment and conviction of a sen
ator and a congressman for land frauds
In Oregon. I do not believe that It is
In the public Interest to protect criminals
In any branch of the public service, and
exft' tly as we have again and again dur
ing the past seven years prosecuted and
convicted such criminal* who were In
the executive branch of the government,
so In my belief we should be given ample
means to prosecute them if found In the
legislative branch. But if lids Is not
considered desirable a spec.a 1 exception
eouid be made In the lew prohibiting the
use of the secret service force In Inves
tigating members of the congress.
Postal Saving;: Banks,
I again renew my recommendation
for postal savings banks, for deposit
ing savings with the security of the
government behind them. The object
Is to encourage thrift and economy in
the wage-earner and person of mod
erate means. It is believed that In the
aggregate vast sums of money would be
brought into circulation through the In
strumentality of the postal savings
banks
Parcel Post.
In my last annual message I com
mended the postmaster-general's
recommendation for an extension of the
parcel post on the re. al routes. The
establishment of a local parcel post on
rural routes would be to the mutual
benefit of the farmer and the country
storekeeper, and It Is desirable that the
routes, serving more than 15,000,000
people, should be utilized to the fullest
practicable extent.
Education.
With tlie limited means hitherto pro
vided. the bureau of e ducation has
rendered efficient service, but the con
gre-s has neglected to adequately sup
ply the bureau with means to meet the
educational growth of the country.
I earnestly recommend that this un
fortunate state of affairs as regards
the national educational offlee be reme
died by adequate appropriations. This
rt commendation Is urged by the repre
sentatives of our common schools and
great state universities and the leading
educators, who all unite In requesting
favorable consideration and action by
the congress upon this subject.
Tho president points out the neces
sity of better organization of the vari
ous bureaus responsible for the public
health, and urges the placing of all
soldiers' homes under the jurisdiction
of the war department.
Statehood.
On the question of statehood the
president says:
I advocate the Immediate admission of
New Mexico and Arizona as states. This
should l done at the present session of
the congress. The people of the two ter
ritories have made It evident by their
votes that they will not come in as one
state. The only alternative Is to admit
them as two. and I mist that this will be
done without delay.
Interstate Fisheries.
I call the attention of I lie- congress to
the Importance of the problem of the
fisheries In the interstate waters. On the
Great Lakes we n> now. under the very
wise treaty of April 11 of this year, en
deavoring to comp id an international
agreement for the preservation and sat
isfactory use of the fisheries of these wa
ters which can not otherwise he achieved.
Lake Frte, for example, has the richest
fresh water fisheries in the world; hut If
is now controlled by the statutes of two
nations, four states, and one province,
and this province by two different ordi
nances in different counties All these
political divisions work at cross pur
poses, and In no . ase can they achieve
protection to the fisheries, on the one
hand and Justice to the localities and In
dividuals on the other.
Foreign Affairs.
This nation's foreign policy Is based
I
between nations precisely as Tret ween
irdividuals, and In our actions for the
lest ten years we have In this mutter
proven our faith by our deeds We
have behaved, and are behaving, to
wards other nations, as in private life
an honorable man would behave to
wards Ills fellows
Latin-American Republics.
The commercial and material prog
ress of the 20 Latin-American republics
Is worthy of the careful attention of
the congress The International Bureau
of the American Republics Is doing a
useful work In making these nations
and their resources better known to
us, and tn acquainting them not only
with us as a people and with our pur
poses towards them, but with what we
have to exchange for their goods
Panama Canal.
The work on the Panama canal Is be
ing done with a speed, efficiency and
entire devotion to duty, which make it
a model for al! work of the kind The
men on the Isthmus, from Col. Goethals
and his fellow commissioners through
the entire list of employes who are
faithfully doing their duty, have won
their right to the ungrudging respect
and gratitude of the American people.
Ocean Mall Lines.
I again recommend the extension of
the ocean mall act of so that satis
factory American ocean mail line* to
South America. Asia, the Philippines,
and Australasia may be established
Hawaii.
I ce’l particular attention to the Ter
ritory of Hawaii. The Importance of
; those Islands is apparent and the need
of Improving their condition and de
veloping their resources Is urgent.

Japanese Exposition.
The Japanese government has p.i,,
polled until 1917 the date of the gre .
nternatlonai exposition, the action be
Ing taken so as to Insure ample tmw
In which to prepare to make the ex->.
sitlon all that It should be made. The
American commissioners have visited
Japan and the postponement wtll mere
ly give ampler opportunity for Amerl
ca to be represented at the exposition.
Not since the first International exp.)-
sitlon has there been one of greater
importance than this will be. marking
as it does, the fiftieth anniversary rf
the ascension to the throne of the em
peror of Japan. The extraordinary
leap to the foremost place among tbs
nations of the world made by Japan
during tills half century ia something
unparalleled in all previous history
I take this opportunity publicly u,
state my appreciation of the way in
which In Japan. In Australia, in New
Zealand, and in all ,he states of South
America, the battle fleet has been re
ceived on Its practice voyage around
the world. The American government
ran not too strongly express its appre
ciation of the abounding and generous
hospitality shown our ships In ev<q-r
port they visited.
The Army.
As regards the army 1 call attention
to the fact that while our Junior iffl.
cers and enlisted men stand very high
the present system of promotion by
seniority results in bringing Into the
higher grades many men of mediocre
capacity who have but a short time tn
serve. No man should regard It as hh
vested right to rise to the highest rank
in the army any more than In any
other profession. It Is a curious anil
by no means creditable fact that th-rs
should be so often a failure on th*
part of the public and Its represents
tlves to understand the great need,
from the standpoint of the service ami
the nation, of refusing to promote re
spectable. elderly Incompetents, ts?
higher places should he given tj the
most deserving men without regard to
seniority; at least seniority should he
treated as only one consideration In
the stress of modern Industrial com
petition no business firm could succeed
If those responsible for Its management
were chosen simply on the ground that
they were the oldest people in its em
ployment; yet this Is the course advo
cated as regards the army, and re
quired by law for all grades except
those of general officer. Asa matter
of fact all of the best officers in the
highest ranks of the army are these
who have attained their present posi
tion wholly or In part by a process of
selection.
The scope of retiring hoards should
be extended so that they could con
sider general unfitness to command for
any cause. In order to secure a far more
rigid enforcement than at present In
the elimination of officers for mental,
physical or temperamental disabilities
But this plan is recommended only If
the congress does not see fit to provide
what In my judgment Is far better,
that Is. for selection In promotion, and
for elimination for age. Officers who
fall to attain a certain rank by a cer
tain age. should be retired—-for In
stance. if a man should not attain
field rank by the time he Is 15 he
should of course be placed on the re
tired list. General officers should be
selected as at present, and one-third
of the other promotions should he
made by selection, the selection to be
made by the president or secretary of
war from a list of at least two candl
datt s proposed for each vacancy by
board of officers from the arm of the
service from which the promotion i
to be made. A bill Is now before the
congress having for Its object t > se
cure the promotion of officers to vari
ous grades at reasonable ages through
a process of selection, by boards of of
ficer s, of the least efficient for retire
ment with a percentage of their pay
depending upon length of service. The
bill although not accomplishing ill
that should be done, is a long step In
the right direction; and I earnestly
recommend its passage, or that of s
more completely effective measure
National Guard.
Now that the organised militia, ft's
National Guard, has been incorporat'd
with the army as a part of the national
forces, it behooves the government to
do every reasonable thing in its power
to perfect its efficiency It should be
assisted in Its instruction and other
wise aided more liberally than hereto
fore. The continuous services of many
well-trained regular officers will b
essential In this connection. A
bill la now pending before the
congress creating a number of extra
officers In the army, which if passed,
as it ought to be, will enable more
officers to be trained as Instructors o
Notional Guard and assigned to tha.
duty In case of war it will be of the
Utmost Importance to have a large
number of trained officers to use o
turning raw levies Into good troops.
The Navy.
1 approve the recommendations of
the general board for ibe
crease of the navy, calling
attention to the need of *'
tlonal destroyers and colliers, md *
all. of the four battleships. It 1 d lr
able to complete as soon as P o *- 1 ® ,
squadron of eight battleahipa of
existing type,
I most earnestly recommend that “
general board be by law turned in
general staff. There la literally no
euae whatever for continuing the I'J
ent bureau organization of the nary •
navy should be treated as a purely m ‘
tary organization, and everything • 0
be subordinated to the one object of ■
curing military efficiency. A W l ”'
of promotion by merit, either oy ■
tlon or by exclusion, or by both
processes, should be Introduced. H
of the qu'-atlon. If the present pnl>>'jP
of promotion bv m*re seniority is 1 '
