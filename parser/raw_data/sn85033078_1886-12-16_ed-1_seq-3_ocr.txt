PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES.
How Lincoln. Johnson’ and Grant Prepared
Their Official Documents— I The Rivalry to
Secure 3lcssages in Former Days.
Washington Post.
The capacity of President Cleveland
for hard work says a correspondent, is
perhaps best illustrated by the fact that
he is writing every word of his message.
His experience last year, when he wrote
with his own hand the longest message
ever submitted by a president to congress
does not seem t have dismayed him in
the least. This year, although the mes
sage will be briefer, it will be of sufficient
length to make the physical task of writ
ing it somewhat laborous. Thoroughly
engrossed in his work, the president sees
as few callers as he possibly can. Ha
takes no recreation except a drive in the
afternoon, and even Thanksgiving day
was devoted to work. From morning to
night he bends over his desk —a histori
cal piece of furniture, made from the
timbers of the ship Rescue and presented
to this government by Queen Victoria
of England. He writes a small
cramped hand, but his pen moves over
the paper with considerable ease, and he
rarely has occasion to revise his matter.
All the phrases in his writings which
have become famous were first thoughts.
Very few persons have any idea of the
great amount of detail which the presi
dent accomplishes. All his veto mes
sages were written by him personally,
and that too, in the longest possible way.
In returning house bill No. 5968, for in
stance, he wrote. “House bill number
five thousand nine hundred and sixty
eight.” He penned his Thanksgiving
proclamation, Many of the letters whicli
other presidents turned over to their
secretaries are answered by him in per
son. He even addressed with his own
hand the envelope which informed Dis
trict Attorney Benton of his reinstate
ment.
In personally writing his messages
President Cleveland differs from any of
his predecessors. Lincoln wrote compar
atively little of his messages, but he paid
close attention to the phraseology. In
those days the “buts” and the “ifs”
counted. He wrote a small, even hand,
easily read, and his manuscript was not
often marred by erasures.
Johnson, who followed him, wrote still
less. His right arm was crippled and he
could not raise it to his head. He used
pen and ink but rarely, finding a lead
psncil less tiresome. It is said that he
did not write a letter in ink after he be
came president. He signed his name
frequently, of course, but an entire letter
in his handwriting is now worth almost
its weight in gold. Ha dictated his mes
sages to Col. William G. Moore, who was
then his private secretary. He thought
quickly, for the impossibility of writing
developed the faculty of dictation to its
highest degree.
President Grant sent eight messages to
congress. They were in the main con
tributions from his cabinet others, writ
ten in the first person and then dove
tailed together. They were not finally
submitted, however, without careful con
sideration, Grant was cautious and con
servative and carefully modified and re
vised the recommendations of his cabinet
officers. He loved to write, and all the
additions and emendations of the mes
sages were in his own handwriting. He
wrote many autograph letters, and his
vetoes were also in his own hand. He
eould dictate, but not easily, and when
ever he wanted to be particularly sorcible
he shut himself in his room and, free
from interruption, wrote out in full what
he desired to say.
Mr. Hayes wrote a sprawley irregular
hand, hard to resd by those who were un
accustomed to it. His message was
largely the work of Mr. Rodgers, his
private secretary, a man of considerable
scholorship. Whatever polish they con
tained was due entirely to Mr. Rodgers,
and many portions, indeed, were written
by the latter in the first instance. The
cabinet officers aided largely in the work
and their contributions were used with
out revision. President Arthur’s hand
writing was bold and large, showing con
siderable force, and th* words and let
ters were joined in an easy running style
as if the writer had done considerable
clerical duty. Surrogate Rollins, of Nw
York, it is not generally known, was Mr.
Arthur’s right-hand man in the prepara
tion of the messages. Together they ar
ranged the topics to be treated upon
and many of the ideas contained in the
documents emanated directly from Mr.
Rollins.
In former days the messages were dup
licated on manifold paper, and when the
private secretary was supposed to have
reached the capitol —for there was no
telegraph or telephone connection with
the white house then —copies were dis
tributed to tke anxious correspondents
and reporters. Then there was a grand
rush for the telegraph and newspaper
offices: “I have seen them nearly break
their necks in getting downstairs,” said
a veterean employe of the white house,
in describing the scene. Many of the
newspaper men did not hesitate to go
through the lower and private part of
the building, and make short cuts to
Pennsylvania avenue, through the
grounds. Others, who had carriages and
the fleetest horses the city could afford
standing at the front entrance, at a speed
far beyond the limits of the law. At the
newspaper offices an extra force of com
positors hurried the message into type.
The public entered into the spirit of riv
alry and large crowds surrounded the
offices, all ready to cheer the first news
boy who appeared with a bundle of papers
under his arm. Nowdays it is different.
The persons who, in these peaceful times,
take even sufficient interest in a message
to stauggle through its long array of
commonplace sentences are in a large
minority.
A president’s message has always been
regarded as the most important piece of
news a correspondent eould secure. In
the days of fluctuations in gold it had its
value to Wall street also. Indeed, it is
asserted at the white house that once dur
ing Johnson's administration a New York
broker, who was anxious to anticipate the
effect of the president's recommenda
tions on the market, offered §25,000 to
an employe for an advance copy. His
offer was declined. Despite this general
desire to get hold of the messages only
two have been prematurely printed, and
both publications occurred during the
administration of Mr. Hayes. The latter
abandoned the old system of manifold
ing, and had his messages printed in ad
vance, copies being forwarded to collect
ors of customs and postmasters for dis
tribution to newspapers at noon of the
day congress assembled. A copy, how
ever, was taken from his desk and sold t
the New York Herald for §SOO. It was
carried by the correspondent up four
flights of stairs to the operating room of
the Western Union Telegraph company
and given into safe keeping of the night
manager. It was then divided among
several trusted operators, and as soon as
the last word had gone over the wiaes it
was returned to the correspondent with
out any of those cabalistic marks which
press matter usually receives, and by him
taken away. But the company, it is
hardly necessary to add, did not lose its
tolls.
BUSTS OF THE VICE PTESIDENTS.
They Arc to Adorn the Gallery of the Senate-
A Good Portrait of Mr. Arthur.
Last April, writes a Washington cor
respondent of the New York Herald, the
senate library committee reported a reso
lution authorizing the payment from the
contingent fund of a sum sufficient for
the purchase of the busts of the vice
■presidents from John Adams down to
the present time. The resolution, which
was adopted without debate, provided
that no more than five busts should be
received within one fiscal year, and that
each should be modeled by an artist re
siding in the same state with the subject.
The matter was then placed in the charge
of Mr. Edward Clark, the architect of the
capitol. —It was finally decided . that the
first five should be the busts of the three
vice presidents then living, —viz., Hanni
bai Hamlin, William A. Wheeler, and
Chester A. Arthur, — and then revert to
Adams and Jefferson, coming down the
line to Mr. Hendricks. The list includes
only the legally-elected vice presidents,
and not those who may have filled the
office ad interim.
It is the intention to place the five
busts of those above-mentioned in the
niches of the north wall of the senate
chamber, where the vice presidents gen
erally sit, but when all shall have been
finished they will be arranged chronologi
cally in their respective niches in the
galleries of the senate. The busts will
be placed on pedestals of a height suffi
cient to prevent being handled by that
class of curiously-disposed persons who
can not be satisfied with anything less
than personal contact with whatever hap
pens to be placed on exhibition. The
pedestal will be chiseled from marble of
a color approximating the general tone
of the wall —that of Sienha marble. The
busts will stand three feet in height.
They will be so arranged that the center
of the face -vill be the point from which
the semiclucular head of the niche might
be descried. They will be executed from
the best portraites obtainable.
The effort will be to secure portraits
contemporaneous with the services of
the subject as vice president. Some
difficulty may be experienced, it is feared
in procuring good representations of
some of the dead statesmen —such, for
example, as these of Aaron Burr and
Daniel Tompkins, of New York. The
only good portrait of burr is believed to
be that in the possession of Princeton
college of which Jonathan Edwards, Mr.
Burr’s grandfather, was at one time presi
dent.
Ex-President Arthur, npon being con
sulted in regard to the matter, requested
that Mr. St. Gaudens, of New York City,
be Given the work of fashioning his
features into olay.
Mr. Wheeler expressed no preferace as
to the sculptor, but regretted that on
account of his health he could not give
a personal sitting. He referred Mr. Clark,
however, to a portrait, of himself at the
bureau of engraving and printing in this
city, which he regards as probably the
best presentment of himself in existence,
Mr, Clark has asked J. Q. A. Ward, of
New York, to perform this work, but it is
not known at present whether he will ac
cept.
To Mr. Franklin Simmons, of Maine,
will be assigned the preparation of Mr.
Hamlin's bust, while Mr. Daniel French
of Massachusetts, and a Mr. Ezekiel, of
Virginia will perform a similar service
for ex-Presidents Adams and Jefferson.
The sum which the artists will receive
for this service will be §BOO, only one
contract being awarded to each sculptor.
A life-size portrait of President Arthur
was made by Leciere, of New York, from
many sittings, representing him as a gen
tleman who had just stepped out of the
main door of a mansion on to the porch
to salute the face of nature on an autum
nal morn. In one hand he was holding a
book, with one finger between the leaves.
A rose, as though fallen from his button
hole, lay upon the step. The artist died
before the picture could be criticised by
Mr. Arthur, and through the aid of an
eminent New York and Washington artist
the changes desired by him were under
taken. They did not relate in any degree
to the face, but merely to the size and
repose of the body. As changed under
Mr. Arthur's direction this admirable
work of art now adorns the white house,
and is esteemed as a striking portrait.
He Certainly Put His Foot In It,
Chicago Tribune.
A prominent Chicago real estate man
and his partner were the best of friends,
and tbeir intimacy extended to personal
as well as business matters. His partner
was a bachelor, and was in the habit ox
reading him letters of an ardent and af
fectinate nature from a young lady who
signed herself “Susie.” The hero of the
story went away on an extended trip and
returned just in time to attend the wed
ding of his partner. Wishing to show
his good will he sent the happy couple a
wedding present, and at the wedding re
ception, stepped gallantly forward to pay
his respects.
“I hardly feel like a stranger,” he said
in his sweetest tones, addressing the
bride. “In fact I feel as though I ought
to be quite well acquainted with my
partner's wife, since he has often done
me the honor to read me extracts from
his dear Susie's letters.’’
The faces of the husband and the
speaker were studies as the bride drew
herself up and said emphatically and dis
tantly:
“I beg your pardon, sir, my name is
Helen.”

A MAX WHO WAS SCALPED.
He Says the Operation Caused Him Consider
able Pain - A Very Xarrow Escape from
Death.
San Franci-co Chronicle.
It has often been said that a man
can not live after being scalped, writes a
Fort Keogh correspondent to the Chron
icle. One of the Crow Indian scouts with
Custer before that brave officer met his
fate was caught by a party of Sioux alone
on the prairie and scalped alive. His
enemies cut a pear shaped piece out of
the crown of his head and left him writh
ing in agony, supoosing he would of
course die. Notwithstanding all which he
endured, the redskin recovered, and at last
accounts was living with his people on
the Crow reservation and doing well.
There is an old hunter in western Mon
tana whose cabin is located on the east
ern slope pf the Rocky mountains, who
had his hair raised some years ago by a
band of savages, and yet he lives and
thrives in most astonishing good health.
The old fellow’s name is Ganzio, and by
reason of his advanced years would, in
the natural course of events, have white
hair now, only that he has no hair at all
to speak of. Still, what little he has got
is whitened or gray, the rest of his head,
“where the hair ought t© grow,” being as
bald as a billiard ball. To be exact, Gan
zio did not lose his entire scalp, but only
a portion of it. The probabilities are
that he could not have survived with the
loss of the whole top of his head. Some
few years ago, when Sitting Bull was
master of this country, Ganzio was the
guide of an emigrant party en route to
Fort Laramie.
The story of that dangerous expedition
is an exceedingly interesting one, and
as related by himself it runs as fol
folws:
“One day we were coming into the val
ley of Hut creek, on our way to Fort
Laramie, -when we thought we saw In
dians coming down the creek to the right.
Instead of camping there, we thought it
safer to water our stock and go on to the
hills and make a dry camp in the
bushes. I had been sent on ahead up the
hill to reconnoiter, and took with me a
boy named Kountze, from Omaha, mere
ly for company. We sat down to wait
for the wagons, which were slowly coming
up out of the valley. When the wagons
reached us I started on alone through the
rocks and pine bushes to seek a good
camp. A few hundred yards further on I
looked down a ravine to the right and
faw five mounted Indiana ride across the
valley. I started to go back to the train,
when at least a dozen ran at me out of
bushes, and you bet I ran and called for
help. In a minute more two or three of
them shot at me. I felt a sharp, sting
ing pain in my right leg, and another in
my left shoulder, and I fell. Then they
were upon me in a minute, and one of
them put his knee on my back, while
another hit me with a club. Another
struck me with the butt of a gun and I
became partly unconscious. Still I had
reason and feeling enough left to know I
was being scalped; for the hair held so
tightly and the pain was so awful that I
could not die then even if I wanted to.
I felt a hot stinging pain all around the
top of my head —the hair being torn out
by the roots, so to speak —and it was too
much. I died, or at least I thought I did,
but as it happened my scalp or at least a
part of it, was saved just as it was being
torn off. The boys at the wagon had
seen me running and saw the Indians and
came at a run —thirteen of them, arriv
ing just in time to prevent the red devils
finishing their work. The Indians, as
well as my friends, thought I was dead,
but I came to again, and what was left of
my scalp was laid back in its place. It
was only half torn off you see, and the
place is pretty well healed now.”
“What did you do with yourself after
ward?”
“Why, I hurried into Fort Laramie, got
the attention of a physician, and went
back to the states a while; but the western
fever cams strong upon me again and I
returned to the mountains, where I have
been ever since.
Calculating the Size of the Earth.
Exchange.
The earlier attempts at calculating the
size of the globe were based on astrono
mical observations. It would be difficult
to-day to say within what degree of ac
curacy the figure then obtained could
have been relied upon, as the units of
measurement used by those pioneers
have been lost, and could not have been
compared with the units now in use.
One of the earlier attempts at obtain
ing the actual length of the earth’s meri
dian by direct measurement of a portion
of the same was made in the sixteenth
century by a French doctor. The means
employed, although very ingenious,
would be considered perfectly clumsy
and inadequate by the modern scientist.
There was in this early measurement no
attempt at mathematical precision as
understood in the present century, and
considering the simplicity of the method
employed by the doctor, it is only to be
wondered that no greater error was ob
tained in its final result. The measure
ment consisted simply in driving from
Baris to Amiens, and counting the revol
utions of the wheels of the carriage, and
from the number of revolutions of the
wheels of the carriage, obtain the dis
tance between the two cities, which could
serve as the basis for calculating the
length of the meridian. Of course this
calculation could not by any means be
considered accurate, but, taking into ac
count the means employed, the result ob
tained has been subsequently found to be
wonderfully precise.
The most curious thing about it is
that what would now- be considered grave
errors and inexactitudes were so distribu
ted that they almost compensated each
other, and the dimensions then obtained
show only slight differences with the
dimensions given by the most recent
measurements, Thus chance and no
better name could be found permitted
of the same results, with only
a small final error, being obtained with
that mude method, that are now obtained
with the most precise instruments and
with the most complicated calculations.
As to Whiskers.
Two fallacies are in vogue regarding the
whisker question. One is that a thin
faced man should support side whiskers
to widen his face; the other that a round
faced fat man should favor long chin
whiskers to lengthen his face. Both ire
adopted on the counter-action and anti
dote principle, but are wrong as wrong
can be. A man with a sharp chin exposed
is thin and appears thin in spite of his
burnsides. And a moon-shaped man
gives himself a humorous and clownish
appearance by wearing a long, sharp
tuft on his chin. The principle of
conformity should be observed and a
wholesale change made. A thin man, for
instance, should not wear chin whiskers,
no whiskers at all, or a beard. He no
more looks well with side whiskers and a
peaked chin than he would t® stuff his
chest and not his cheeks and calves. To
look well he must be uniformly and con
sistently thin, or he may modify it by a
complete beard. A fat man should be
smooth-faced or wear universal whiskers
pretty closely cropped. A well-propor
tioned and moderately full-faced man
may vary the style and quantity of his
whiskers with impunity, so far as the
thin or broad appearance is concerned.
Avery short beard gives an animal look;
if very large it indicates vanity or crank
iness.
A SEARCH FOR A CORPSE.
How the Body of a Young Lady Was Saved
from the Disiusecting-Table.
A novel case, concerning the disappear
ance and recovery of the dead body of a
young woman, and illustrating the facil
ity, with which the medical colleges ac
quire subjects for their disinsecting
rooms, was brought to light recently,
says the Louisville Courier-Journal, by a
reporter acting in the capacity of a de
tective.
On November 14 there died at the city
hospital, of tubeeffiar laryngitis, Mis*
Mollie Grace, aged 26 years. The friends
of the dead woman secured the services
of City Undertaker John Hess, and in
structed him to bury the remains in a
St. Louis cemetery. Mr. Hess intrusted
the funeral preparations to one of his as
sistants and gave no more heed to the
matter. On his way to the health office
to secure a burial permit the assistant
forgot wher® ho was going to bury the
body, or, as an employe of the city un
dertaker, who plants daily 7 a number of
paupers in the potter’s field, he thought
he was burying one of that unfortunate
class, and, as a consequence, seemed a
permit in the almshouse grave-yard, or
potter’s field.
The corpse was conveyed to its resting
place November 19. A few days after
wards some friends visited the St. Louis
cemetery to look at the grave, and were
much puzzled when Sexton John Holland
informed them that the grave was ready,
but that the body of Miss Grace had
never been brought there for burial. They
at once found John Hess and demanded
to know what disposition had been made
of the remains. Mr. Hess found by in
quiry of the assistant who had charge of
the funeral, that the corpse had gone to
the potter’s field. He immediately drove
to the almshouse in company with the
friends of the deceased and the grave
was opened. To the horror of all the
coffin was found to be empty, not a trace
remaining of the unfortunate girl. The
only solution to the problem was that
ghouls had been at work, and that the
body was within th© walls of one of the
medical institutions.
A reporter learned of the circumstanc
es and at once set about to discover the
body. A casual search through the dis
secting-rooms of the various colleges
failed to disclose any clew to the corpse,
and it appeared as though it had been
spirited away or so securely hidden as to
defeat all efforts to recover it.
Finally the reporter got a clew. He
learned that an unusually tine female sub
ject was in the vat of the Louisville Uni
versity of Medicine, on Eighth and
Chestnut streets; that th© body was that
of a finely formed and altogether hand
some woman, and that it was considered
quite an acquisition to the institution.
Two men were secured from John Hess’
undertaking establishment,, and with the
reporter soon found themselves at the
portals of the gloomy old mansion occu
pied by the university.
The janitor ushered the party inside
and afterward into the dissecting-room,
where were found some thirty tables oc
cupied by corpses in various stages of
dissection. These were examined, but
none proved to bo the one sought for.
The party then made their way to an ante
room where the two great vats are located.
One of them was opened, and with a large
hook the bodies, thirteen in number,
were brought to the surface and examin
ined. They were all of adults, six being
women; but Miss Grace’s corpse was not
among them.
The other vat was opened, and the hook
plunged into the mysterious and discol
ored depths. A body with the hook im
bedded in its shoulder rose to the top and
was pulled to view. It was that of a
woman, and was readily recognized as the
remains of Miss Grace. It was taken out
and placed on a table, where it was found
to be in a perfect state of preservation
and unmarked except where the cruel
hooks had made several jagged wounds
on different parts of the symmetrical
form.
The eyes were closed and the face bore
a peaceful expression, quite at variance
with th© somber circumstances surround
ing the sad case. No objections were
made to its removal, and the corpse,
wrapped in a sheet, was removed to a
wagon in waiting, and, after being placed
in a coffin at Hess’undertaking place, was
quitly buried in the St. Louis cemetery.
The relatives of the dead girl were sat
isfied to secure the body in such good
condition, and though much outraged by
the manner in which they had been treat
ed, will make no specific complaint.
A Long Way For S othing.

The crowd was talking on the subject
of traveling on free passes, cheap rates,

‘“Well,” .remarked Maj. Stofah, when
there came a lull, “I went from Washing

“The walking must have been good,”
suggested Roberts.
“I rode all the way in a Pullman,” said
the major.
“Did you have a pass?” asked Cham

“No.”
“You knew all the conductors, per

“Didn’t know a soul,” replied the ma

“Then how in thunder did you make
it?”
“Easiest thing in the woild,” respond

HE PIED OX TIME.
Remarkable Fulfillment of an Old Man’s Pre
dictions.
Little Kock Gazet’e.
‘•Talk about presentiment,” said a
I prominent citizen to a reporter, “I know
of a case coming under that head that
strikes me as being the most remarkable
on record, which occurred at Poinsett
i County in 1885, and was related by Gen-
I oral T. C. Hindman, who was canvassing
that part of the state at the time in the
interest of his candidacy for congress.
While in Poinsett County he stopped at a
double log cabin on Sunday morning,
where he was welcomed by an old, gray
haired man who was surrounded by his
wife and a dozen or more children, grand
-1 children, and great grandchildren of
different sizes and ages, who were accom
panied by their parens. The General
called at the house for dinner, and seeing
such a large crowd assembled inquired
the cause of the family reunion. One of
the women replied by saying:
‘•Dad's got it inter his head that he's
goin' to die at 11 o'clock, and it new lacks
nigh onto an hour of the time. He called
us all over here to see him go off. He's
over 60 years old, and ’twom't surprise any
!cnus if what he says don't come true.
He b lived in these parts over 50 years,
and they ain't nobody ’round here as
can say
HE OVEB TOLD A LIE.’
“About 10:80 o'clock,” said General
Hindman, the old man ordered one of his
sons to wheel an antiquated lounge in the
hallway of the house, and without any
difficulty he stretched himsely upon it.
He appeared to be in perfect health, and
although the eyes of most of the women
assembled were red from crying, there
was no visible cause for it but the nearer
the hour of 11 o’clock approached the
louder and more general became the
weeping.
“My dear friends,” said Gen. Hindman
in a sympathizing tone of voice, ‘I don't
think there’s any occassion for all this
sorrow. I think you are all borrowing
trouble for yourselves. Just wait till 11
o’clock comes and I am sure you will find
out that ’
“Look hyar, stranger,” exclaimed one
of his sons, that old man thar never told
a lie in his life and we don’t want you to
dispute Wis word, nuther, or ye’ll all an
swer for it.
“The General concluded that he would
say nothing and watch the proceedings,
fully confident that in a few minutes the
grief of the family would be turned into
joy. In a few minutes the old man raised
himself in a half weeping position and
said:
“Maria, fetch the old Bible in the front
room that's got all your names in it and
put it on the chair, and John, reach up
on that shelf in the cupboard and bring
me that copy of the Gazette there.
“This was done, and then the aged man
with a great deal of earnest feeling, spoke
to John and said: ‘John open that paper
and read me the democratic platform
adopted at the national convention two
years ago.’
“John did as he was directed, and when
he had concluded reading the platform,
laid the paper on a chair. The old man
then placed one hand on the Bible and
the other on the copy of the Gazette and,
looking in the face of each member of
the family successively exclaimed:
“My children, thar’s the truth!”
“He then lay down upon the lounge,
and without uttering another word,
breathed his last as the clock in the ad
joining room was striking the hour
of 11*”
Arousing His Ambition.
Boston Courier.
“The boy is all right,” said the doctor,
but you want to talk to him and arrous®
his ambition. Promise yon will take him
somewhere when he recovers sufficiently
to go out; There are lots of ways in which
you can interest him.”
Then the doctor addressed the boy,
who wag just recovering from a fever,
saying:
“Come, Mickny, cheer up, my boy.
wouldn’t you like to go and play tag with
your playmates?”
A faint smile stole over the boy’s face,
but that was all.

A Demonstrative Waiter.
San Francisco Post.
It is a pretty hard world, anyway, for
people of refinement. It is no use trying
to be elegant and high-toned and digni
fied. Something is always striking
against you and convincing you that life
is tough. They were talking of restaur
ants, and menus, and dishes with extra
ordinary names that don’t mean much,
and reveling in gourmet jargon. There
was a well-known gentleman of wealth,
position, and taste present, and several
lesser lights, gas-lights emulating by the*
aid of reflectors the brilliancy of the elec
tric, so to speak. There was a fellow
there who was not a gourmet, couldn’t af
ford it, and a vague idea of revenge enter
ed into his head.
“If you want a good dinner —not an
elegant dinner perhaps, because they
don’t go much on French dishes there—
if you want a good steak fit for a king,
and a waiter who will make you perfectly
comfortable, go to ’s.”
“ ’s? ’’ said the gentleman of wealth
and fashion. “Where is ’s?”
“You’ll easily find it. It’s a little out of
the way but if you want cooking and pro
per attendance go there.”
I skip a few days.
The gentleman of wealth and position
recalled this bit of advice and betook
himself to ‘s. It was dingy, but clean,
and he eat down and ordered from a
somewhat rough-looking but lively waiter
a porterhouse steak.
It came. It was about as thick as a
pancake and it was beautifully streak
ed with the Assyrian stripes of a dirty
gridiron.
“Look here, waiter. What do yon call
this?”
“I calls it a porterhousee steak —an’
porterhouse steak it is—an’ you jist eat it
to or blow me if I do’t wear it out on
you.”
The Loveliest Spot-
Texas Siftings.
“ There is no place like home. It’s the
lovelist spot on earth,” remarked a New
York gentleman to a friend.
“ Not always. The loveliest spot I ever
struck was when I was abroad.” *
“Where was it?”
“ On board of one the Cunard steamers
in the smoking room. The loveliest spot
was an ace. I had the other three in my
hand.”
Out of a Job.
From the Philadelphia Call.
“Say, mister, don’t yer want a boy?”
“Are you out of work?”
“Yes.”
“W'hat did you do during the summer?”
“I stuck flies onto fly-paper in drug
gists’ winders; but fly time’s over now.”
There is a Balm.*
Tid-Bits.
“Is there no balm in Gilead?” yelled a
temperance orator at a picnic.
“ No, but there’s some mighty good lic
kor down here behind Pete Riley’s barn,
if you’re very dry,” sang out a stump leg
ged man sitting on a front seat.
Brining John to Terms.
Philadelphia Press.
“Ned’’ Thorne, the well-known actor,
who made a hit in the “Black Flag,” is
one of the practical jokers of the day.
His sister is the wife of John Chamber
lain, of Washington, the well-known club
house man end caterer. Thorne was here
a few days ago and went to the Hotel
Brunswick with two or three friends for
lunch, when he discovered Chamberlain
in an adjoining cafe, and remarked to
his companions that he proposed to have
some fun with him. Thorne called for a
telegraph blank, on which he wrote as
follows:
Mbs. John Chambeblain, Washington,
D. C. — John at this moment is dining
with a beautiful woman at the Hotel
Brunswick. Shall I interfere?
On the back of the dispatch he wrote:
Deab John: —Unless we get a bottle for
our table at once this dispatch will be
filed for transmission. Ned.
A waiter was sent with this dispatch to
Mr. Chamberlain, who promptly caught
on to the joker's work and said to the
waiter; “Give those gentlemen out there
anything they want, from a bottle to a
basket, and charge it to me, but notify
‘Ned’ Thorne that I shall have him ar
rested in the morning for black mailing.”
