FROM WA8HNQT02Y.
COXfcftBM
Met ftt 12 o'clock on Monday, a quorum btv
ingjrt$ent in Lot V houses. The day . was
stormy and disagreeable, and the attendance
of visitors unusually email. None of the hotels
of the city are full, and tliu lobbies are nearly
empty. The ''third house," however, are on
hand, and there is said to be no end of the
jobs they are ready to press upon congress.
After organizinij and sending the usual com
niittecs to the President, both houses were kept
waiting iunriy two liourd beforo the Presi
dent's i:ie.i:Lr arrived, which was read very
quietly, its reading creating no surprise, as
speculation and gossip had anticipated its
leading points. The proposed further perse
cution of Georgia elicited a ripple ol radical
applause, while tho adverse views on Cuban
recognition were received with disgust by the
"Cuban lobby." After the reading, the mess
age was referred to the committee of the whole
in the house, and laid upon the table and or
dered to be printed in the senate.
BILLS.
Among the bills thus far introduced the fol
lowing are the most notable :
In the Benate; by Mr. Drake, a bill to pro
hibit the Supreme Court hereafter from declar
ing unconstitutional any act or joint resolution
of congress. In fact, the bill proposes to make
congress the supreme power in all cases, and
If that body should abolish the office of Presi
dent and set up a king, there would be no
remedy but in revolution. This infamous
proposition was appropriately iollowed by
another from Mr. Sumner, depriving the court
of the right to grant writs of haoeat corpus.
By Mr. Morton : A bill for the reconstruc
tion of Georgia, on the plan shadowed forth
in the President's message.
By Mr. Trumbull : A bill prohibiting mem
bers of congress from signing recommenda
tions of candidates for appointment to office.
By Mr. "Warner : A bill to relieve certain
persons therein named of political disabilities.
An informal debate on this bill in the senate
on Wednesday seemed to leave no doubt that
congress intends to pn3 a bill relieving politi
cal disibilitics generally ia the south, and
abolishing all test oaths.
In the house, about the first bill introduced
was one by Mr. IJutlrr, to repeal the tenure-of-
office law. This was Butler's ret at the last
ssion, and he seems determined to "put it
through."
On the same day a bill prepared by the cen
sus committee was introduced, and as the
passage of this bill before the new year Is al
most an absolute necessity to enable the next
census to be taken during the year 1870, the
houitc has spent the greater part of each day
einec in its consideration in committee f the
whole,
A bill to extend the Hoe Tress patent was
killed in the house- on Tuesday by being
promptly tabled. This may possibly, howev
er, be intended only as an invitation to the
Hoe Tress company, which is Immensely rich,
to "shell cut."
Tm: FINANCES.
It is somewhat singular, that notwithstnnd
ing all the talk about the finances, specie pay
ment, and the like, not a single finance bill,
properly so called, lias yet been introduced.
There appears to be a general hesitaucy on the
part of congressmen to approach the subject,
although in regard to a precipitate resumption
of specie payment, there is among members al
most a universal opposition. This tune, how
ever, may be materially changed when the
bondholders' lobby gets to work.
CAPITAL KKMOVAL.
The St. Louis capital removers are on hand
with quite a formidable lobby force, while the
people of the District are in consternation,
particularly in visw of the fact, that the Presi
dent in his message wholly omitted any al
lusion to their affairs. It is the first message
in 25 years that failed kindly to commend the
District to congress for liberal appropriations.
The citizens of the District count the President
among the removers.
GKOKOIA.
The friends of Georgia are indignant at the
proposed renewal of the political oppression
of that state. Tho Chif Justice who decided
that the negroes were illegally excluded
from the Georgia legislature, for which offence
Georgia is now te be punished, was no oth
er than ex-governor Joe Brown, the very man,
who during the canvass when that legislature
was elected, made stump spent lies to prove
that under the constitution of Georgia then to
be voted upon, negroes were not eligible.
Young Brennaman, tried at Morris during the
present week for the murder of kis father several
months ago, was found guilty, aad sentenced by
the jury te the penitentiary for life. The de
fence net up for him wan insanity, but the jury
couldn't nee it iu t.at light.
The town ef De Kalb, De Kalb oeunty, ou the
4th inst, votod by a large majerity in favor of a
subecriptien of $75,000 te the stock of the Belvi
dero and Ottawa Railroad.
Besides the fact tliat ice is lighter than wa
ter, there is, says an exchange, another curious
thing about it which many persons do not
know perhaps namely, its purity. A lump
of ice molted will becomo pure distilled water.
Water in freezing turns out of it air that is
net water, salt, air, coloring matters and all
impurities. Frozen pea-water makes fresh
water ice. If you freeze a basia of indigo
Hater, it will make ice as clear and as white
as that made of pure raia water. When tfca
celd ia very sudden, theae fereiga matters hate
o time to Utape, th by rising of stoking,
aad ace thus aafcaglti mt&ta ice, but do

The steamer, .Mopwcht witU the remains of
George Peabody, willjwil for America on Son
day, the 12th. Her cabins are draped with
black cloth and white silk. . 'J
For the first time in the world's
history the
President's message and the report of the chief
finance minister of America were transmitted
to Europe by telegraph and published in Lon
don and Paris within twenty-four hours after
their delivery to congress. The English prets
is rather sparing in its comments en the mess
age. L'pon the wholo, its tone upon the Ala
bama question is regarded as friendly. The
Nr infers from It that America wants indem
nity lor her feelings Tatiinr than for her pocket.
This it thinks may be pven.' Diplomacy may
oil the friction and remove a sentimental
grievance without compromising British in
terests or pride. Mr- Boutwell's plan for an
early resumption of specie payments is
generally applauded. '
- Spain,
Rumors of Carlist conspiracies are again
rife. The Carlist Chief, Palo, has been con
victed of treason and sentenced to death.
In the Cortes on the Oth, Gen. Prim stated
that since the commencement ol the Caban
rebellien H vessels of war, two iron clads,and
nearly 40,000 troops had been sent to Cuba.
Half.
The Ecumenical council was opened at
Rome on Wednesday by the Pope. An enor
mous crowd tilled the Vatican aad lined the
streets threugh which the members of the
council passed. Tho pope, followed by 700
bishops, proceeded to the hall of the council
amid the ringing of bells and thundering of
cannon. The holy father was in line health.
The London 1'imet reports from Rome that
"thiigs augur ill for the council Gallicaniam
is rampant. The Austrian and German bish
ops demur to the dogma of infallibility, and
discord is apprehended among the Italians.
Antonelli shakes his head at a procession in
which he never felt any sympathy."
tOn the same day this august council met at
Rome, the congress of Deists met at Naples.
Austria.
Austria meets an unexpected obstacle in the
way of suppressing her Dalmatian insurrection.
She is unable, except at the immense cost and
laber of crossing the Alps, to send troops te
that country without passing through Turkish
territory. To this the Prince ot Montenegro
stoutly demurs, and the Prussian government
sustains him.
