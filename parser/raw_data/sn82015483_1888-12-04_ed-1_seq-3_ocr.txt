DANGER TO PROTESTANTISM.
Three Candidates For
Speaker Of The House.
COmOElIT ON THE DIESSA6E.
Senators' Views Xersely Pnt The
Farmers Will Not Coincide Wltlt
the President's Opinions.
Washington, Deo. 3. A rspreeentative of
the Associated Press to day endeavored to
obtain from prominent members of the Sen
ate an expression of their views npon the
President's message.- The first to speak was
Mr. Hoar, who said: "About all I can say is
that it embodies the utterances of a disap
pointed politioian." i
Mr. Sherman The latter part of the mes
sage consists of a review of the work of the
different branches of the government. There
is nothing striking about it The first part I
did not hear.
Mr. Collom Of necessity he dies game on
his tariff views and in his reference to inter
nal affairs runs into a great scold.
Mr. Frve The only part of the communi
cation whioh interested me was that refer
ring to the fisheries question. I am now try
ing to solve the problem therein, namely, the
President states that there has been nothing
of moment occurring on that subjeot since
March last. Why does he then so severely
criticise us for not passing retaliatory mea
uresf Mr. Manderson I was not particularly
struck with what I heard of the message. I
can say, however, that if Mr. Cleveland will
visit tne northwest when he has more leisure
he will find that oar farmers do not endorse
his ntteranoes on the tariff questions.
Mr. Uockrell I cannot say muoa bdoui
the message until I have read it over. Gen
erally speaking, it impressed me very favor
ably. Mr. Ransom I think it was like all of Mr.
Cleveland's public communications have
been a very able and concisely framed in
strument. Mr. Teller I think that the fitst part of
the message is fall of spleen. There was no
silver lining to the cloud which overhang
Mr. Cleveland when he wrote it. - I do not
believe the country is in so deplorable a
condition as he wonld have us believe. As
to the administration of the different depart-
ments. I want to say, in answer to the Presi
dent, that the postof&oe department was
never in a worse condition man it is to-aay.
Praise Fnm the Ssrlnsnsld Repub
lican.
Springfield, Mass., Deo. 3 The Republi
can says of the message: In its style and
power ef statement and width of view the
message reminds one of some of Mr. Tilden s
state papers and should be given a place by
the bravest of Mr. Clevelands ntter
anoes. It displays something of the
aadasity of leadership, and this quality will
serve to make it more carefully pon
derrd by the people. They will find
that the first third ot the measure
embodies food for serious thought, and we
are far enough from passions of a heated
campaign to face the facts with sober and
candid attention. Tariff- legislation must
continue to be a series of compromises, but the
claims of the plain people will have to be
recognized and enforoed until a wnolesome
revision is achieved.
Comment y tne Press.
Washington, Deo. 8. The Post says:
The President-discusses the tariff with all
the earnestness that characterized his late
specific message on that subject, and in
which, in spite of all his reverses, still main
tains is the great issue before the country.
The silence of the message with re
gard to civil service reform is its notable and
peculiar feature. It is not to be assumed
that the President has lost faith in the re
form, but it is not a fair presumption that he
has lost faith in the reformers.
Ixbiahafous. Deo. J The Journal says of
the president's message: It is very Cleve
landiah in style and temper. Its individual
ity and exhibitions of Mr. Cleveland person
ally mar what wonld otherwise be a fairly
good business message.
Chicago, Deo. 3 The News says of ths
p-esident's message: None but a hide-bound
partisan oan fail to be aronsed to admiration
of the man who, in the hour of political de
feat oan still keep his rudder true and- abso
lutely suppress all personal feeling in his last
offloial utterance.
ratal Collision On tlie New Jersey
Central Read.
Maccm Cavmc, Pa., Deo. 3. This morn
ing at 6 o'olook two freight trains collided at
Solomon's Gap, about 13 miles south of

New Your, Deo. 3. The first of the series
of meetings under the auspioes of Protestant
clereymen to consider the best means of
keeping religious work abreast of the in
creasing population of this oity was held at
Chiokering Hall to-night, a large audience
being present. Hon. John Jay presided and
after the opening exercises outlined the pro
posed movement. It was to be neither sect
arian nor narrow, but broadly Christian and
thoroughly American. A crisis had oome
in the affairs of the city. The influx of the
foreign tide was contaminating onr institu
tions and estranging the rieople. Evangelical
Christianity must be the bulwark to cheok
the flood of unbelief and immorality.
Mr. Jay introduced Bav. James M. King
of the M. E. church, who spoke on the topic
"flew Xork Above Fourteenth Street." tie
displayed a map of the locality named and
showed that while the saloons had kept
numerical pace with the growing population
the Protestant churches had remained nearly
stationary in number. If the saloons ware
represented by small clouds on the map they
would obsenre the 8 tarn which denoted the
churoheB. The saloons controlled 40,000 votes
and were open day and night. Their pro
prietors did not take vacations in ths sum
mer. In 32,390 tenements live 1.100,000
souls. Out of 500,000 Protestant population
only 100,000 are members of churches.
Dr. King defined the evil to be
met as follows in the order given:
Romanism and its machinery, indifference,
Judaism and its excluslveness, inaotiving of
professing Christians, foreign-bred resistanee
to Americanizing influences, the saloon, the
tenement.
These evils were still greater below Four
teenth street. Dr. A. F. Schauffler, vice
president of the oity mission, spoke of "New
Tork below Fourteenth street," and his map
was far more clouded with saloons and less
starry with churches than Dr. King's.
GENERAL FOREIGN NEWS.
Comment, on tbe Presldent'c Message
Other Items ot Interest.
London, Deo. 3. The London Morning
Post commenting on the President's message
says: . If America is really inclined to re
sume negotiations on the Bubjeot of the fish
eries she will find the English ministers ani
mated by a sinoere desire to promote a final
and satisfactory adjustment which Mr. Cleve
land mentions; while unable to hold the
same opinion as Mr. Cleveland as to what the
just demands of comity are, the Post thinks
it would be beater if England would look to
the disposition of American statesmen in the
future than to wrangle over the past.
The Daily Nsws says that it would express
more regret for Mr. Cleveland's acrimonious
ref erenoe to the dismissal ofLord Sackville,
if Lord Salisbury had not set the example.
Mr. Cleveland, it thinks, evidently has Lord
Salisbury's fatal gift of a bitter tongue. In
other respects the message seems to be the
most powertul performance wnion tne freai
dedt has accomplished; namely, the feat of
saying something both new and true " about
protection. Tbe naileries question it thinks
will a smaller cnanoe tor settlement under
Mr. Harrison than under Mr. Cleveland, bat
having only one great party to please the
chances for a judgment on its merits may be
greatly improved.

THE nKSSAVOB in congress.
Tbe majority of tbe Senators Became
Weary and I.aft,trir. mills Tery Atten
tlve.
Washington, Dec 4. The reading of th
message in the Senate occupied an hour and
twenty minutes. The portions ot it which
discuss the questions of tariff revision, treas
ury surplus, fishery troubles snd the West
incident, were listened to with very oloss
attention and apparent interest by fourteen
Republican senators and about an equal
number of Democrats. The other portions
of the message seemed to have but few at
tentive listeners and their reading had tbe
affect of gradually clearing the galleries of
the numerous spectators. When the read
ng was finished the message was on motion
of Mr. Hoar laid on the table and ordered to
be printed.
The Senate then at 2:55 adjourned until
to-morrow after a notification by Mr. Frye
that he would call up the Union Pacific set
tlement bill to-morrow; by Mr. Chandler
tnat be would ask for action on nis resolu
tion to investigate the Louisiana election of
April last, and by Mr. Allison that he would
ask the Senate to proceed with the Tariff bill
and would even (if the discussion became
too protracted) call it up daring the morning
hours of the session.
MIRTH IN THS HOTJSK.
The President's reference to the Saokville-
West inoident provoked a laugh from the
Republican side of the House.but no counter
demonstration was made by the Democrats.
From this point the interest in the message
slackened.
Mr. Mills of Texas was the only member
who paid the slightest attention to the further
reading and tbe noise of conversation was so
great that this was no easy task. When at
3:15 the reading was completed Mr. Mills of
fered a resolution, whioh was agreed to, re
ferring the message to the committee of the
whole and providing for its printing. The
House then adjourned.
Three Candidates for Sneaker of the
Home. -
Washington, Deo. 3. There are now in
the field three open candidates for Speaker
of the House of Representatives of the Fifty-
first Congress McKinley of Ohio, Cannon of
Illinois and Reed of Maine. It is only within
a day or two that Mr. Reed and Mr.McKinley
have acknowledged themselves candidates.
Now they are willing to admit that they are
in the hands of their friends," which is
equivalent to an admission that they will
make the fight. The friends of the other
candidates say that Mr. Reed is handicapped
by the fact that he comes from the East. It
was well enough, they say, to give mm a
complimentary caucus nomination when the
Kepublioans were in' tne minority, Dut they
do not think the Republican party can give
the Speakership to Maine under present con
ditions. The contest between these candi
dates promises to be a lively one and there
are several dark horses in the field ready to
gain and make the race if the leaders are
crowded oft tne track.

RETBHVE COLLECTIONS.
Difficulty of Levvlnz Justly Ad Valo
rem Unties 'The Duty on Opium.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. In his annual
report to the secretary of the treasury James
A. Jewell, supervising special agent of tbe
treasury, states that the amonnt recovered
and paid into the treasury through the direct
services of the officers and employes of his
division exceeds the total oost of such ser
vices by $327,800. This is exclusive of the
amount Involved in suits commenced snd un
determined of redactions of expenses recom
mended and additions aggregating $683,311,
to invoioe values of silk goods from France
and Switzerland reported by the department
experts in those countries as necessary either
to make market value or to equal oost of pro
duction. As to undervaluations he says we have co
operation in the department in efforts to en
force the laws and regulations. In these re
gards the abuses mentioned continue, the
unscrupulous still at the expense of pnbllo
revenue prosper, and it is manifest that jus
tice and equity at the customs cannot be se
cured to all interested without a radical re
vision of the customs revenue laws and a
reformation of existing and administrative
msthods and machinery. All experience has
shown that high ad valorem rates oan not be
collected with fairness and uniformity under
any system of administration laws and regu
lations devised, much less under the present
laws snd inadequate and Ineffective system
of appraisement.
He states that the high duty on smoking
opium, and the faot that it is easily smug
gled, has made it a favorite object of traffic
with those who wished to benefit by viola
tion of the revenue laws. It is highly desira
ble that the recommendations of the depart
ment made last year for the passsge of a bill
prohibiting importation of smoking opium
and providing for the aeisare and destruc
tion of the drug in that form wherever
found should be speedily passed by Congress.

Aa Important Rank Decision.
Chicago, Deo. 3. Judge Shepard rendered
an important opinion this morning on the
application of creditors of the Traders' bank
to have money, ohecks and drafts amounting
to nearly $50,000 returned to them because
they were deposited with the bank when it
known by its officers to be insolvent. The
court denies the petitions in all cases where
the checks were deposited and the money
collected before the actual failure of the
bank, bat grants the prayers for restitution
in cases wherein ohecks were deposited be
fore failure but payment was stopped before
collection, but wherein the collections were
made by the receiver after the bank had
closed its doors. The ruling is that a bauk
is not a trustee for the depositor.
. ANXIOUS TO BECOME STATES.
Tbe Name "Lincoln" Suggested For
North Dakota.
Jamestown, Dak., Deo. 3. A convention
of North Dakota will be held in thia oity on
Wednesday to devise some method to obtain
speedy admission into the Union. This is
the first movement in North Dakota for state
hood and the convention promises to be an
enthusiastic and representative gathering. It
will probably oall a constltational convention
which will prepare statehood machinery that
North Dakota may be ready for admission. It
will consider projeots of issuing a call for an
inter-tenitoral convention of the four north
western territories the two Dakotas, Mon
tana snd Washington whioh shall result in
a nnited demand for admission into the
Union. Another matter to be considered is
the passage of a memorial for the convening
of an extra session of Congress, for the pur
pose of admitting these territories. The
matter of admitting North Dakota under the
name of Lincoln, whioh has been agitated
lately, will presented for the ratification of
the mass convention.

SPORTING mATTBRS.
The New Havens Get Even With tbe
Brldgeporte Score 5 to 3 Hartford
Loses to Sprlngfleld New Haven and
Hartlord Tied Last NIgbt's Game the
Last In Sprlngdeld.
The New Havens are getting in trim to
play polo and any team that defeats them in
their own rink has got to do the greatest
kind of hustling. The home team had not
won a game from Bridgeport before last
night's game, but at the finish the score was
5 to 3 in New Haven'a favor.
During the last half Connors and Perry
were tired out, snd only for the fine defense
work of Vatllant, Phelan and Lations the
visitors would have won. To start with,
the New Havens gave a pretty exhibition of
passing. Then the visitors began to bustle
and didn't give the home team mach of a
show to pass. Several times the New Ha
vens hsd chances to make goals, having passed
the half-back, but they were not equal to the
emergency. Perry does good head work, but
as yet be-is rather wild in driving for goal.
He is working hard. Yalllant. Phelan and
Lations did great work.
ior Bridgeport about the only good work
done was by Smith. Conway, as usual, was
up to his tricky work. He is not a favorite
with spectators. Pierce made some magnifi
cent runs, but hs couldn't get by Phelan.
last Delore the belt rang for the first half
Conway wanted to eo off the floor to fix his
skate, but referee O'Maley wonld not con
sent. This raised the ire of Parsons and
Manager, bat O'Maley explained that before
coming on the floor he had told Conway
about his skate, but he had paid no atten
tion to it. His wanting to go off was only
a scheme to gain time. A minute after,
when the half was up and a rest of five min
utes was taken, Conway did think anything
about his skate.
Those who saw last Friday's and last
night's game do not think that New Haven
will end last. The score:

Bev. Dr. Manger gave the second lecture
of the Phi Beta Kappa course last night on
"Shakespeare from a Warwickshire Stand
point." The leoturer dwelt on the life and
character of the poet, as apart from his
works. Shakespeare was an eminently prac
tical man, whose main object in writing was
to retrieve his fortunes and establish himself
in Stratford as a country gentleman. This
object was persistently followed until attain
ed. Shakespeare's married life, while not
ideal, was probably fairly happy. His chief
characteristic aa a poet was his unconscious
ness of his powers; he simply wrote what he
saw without troubling himself to think about
it. This, Baid Dr. Manger, was his greatest
strength. The lecture was rather poorly at
tended on account of the President's recep
tion, which occurred later in the evening.
