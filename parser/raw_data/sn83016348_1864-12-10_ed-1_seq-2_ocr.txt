President’s Message.
The Annual Message of President
transmitted to Congress on Tuesday last, opens
by expressing the profoundest gratitude to
Heaven for the blessings of health and our abun
dant harvests.
The President says “ the condition of our
foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory.’’ Our
political relations with Mexico have undergone
no change, and this country lias strictly main
tained a neutrality between the belligerents.
The difficulties which caused the closing of
the inner oceanic transit route across the Isth
mus, have been amicably adjusted, and that
great commercial and political improvement will
soon be re-opened.
Telegraphic communication with Great Brit
ain, it is expected, will soon be renewed, and tin
proposed telegraphic, communication with
Europe byway of Behring’s Straits, is also in
prospect of accomplishment.
The relations of this country with Japan,
China, Egypt, the Barhary Powers, the Stales
of Central America, and the Kepublics of South
America, are generally of the most friendly
character.
The President desires authority of Congress
to furnish a gunboat to the Liberian Republic
to aid in arresting tho slave trade.
The President refers to the opening of the
ports of Norfolk, Fernandiuo and Pensacola,
and hopes are expressed that foreign merchants
will consider it safer to resort to those open
ports than to pursue a contraband trade. He
recommends that foreign slave-traders be pre
vented from acquiring domicil, Ac., in this
country. He says that “if it were a new and
open question, the maratime powers would not
concede the principle of a naval belligerent to
the insurgents of the United Stales.” He refers
to the unforeseen difficulties which have arisen
in Brazilian and Brtisli ports, and on the north
ern boundaries of the United States.
The net of the. last session for the encourage
ment of emigration has been nut in partial
operation, hut an amendment of the act is neces
sary to prevent fraud, .Ve. He recommends the
encouragement of emigration as must important
to this government.
The President states that the financial affairs
of the government have been successfully ad
ministered. The receipts from all sources dur
ing the year, including loans and balances in
ibe treasury July Ist, l<*d>3. were $1,394,79(5,-
(•b7.(2, and the aggregate disbursements upon
ilic same basis were tfl 298,05(5,101.89 —leaving
a balance in the treasury of $9(3,739,905.73. —
The public debt on tho Ist of July hist was
5351,740,01)0.489.41); and should the war continue
for another year, the debt may be increased by
about live hundred millions. The President
says, “As the debt is held for the most part by
our own people, it has become a substantial
branch of national, through private, property
and certain suggestions are made to Congress
in connection with its general distribution
among the people.
The National Banking system, lie says, is
proving lo he greatly acceptable to capitalist*
and the people; and he hopes that very soon
there will be in the United Stales no hanks ot
issue nor. authorized by Congress, and no bank
note circulation not secured by the government.
Five hundred and twenty-four National banks
have already been organized.
The reports of the {Secretaries of War and
Navy are referred to for details of military oper
ations. Tho President says “he concurs with
ihe Secretary of the Treasury in the opinion that
the proportion of moneys required to meet the
expenses consequent upon the war, derived from
taxation, shall be still limber increased.”
* The number of naval captures, since hostili
ties commenced, is 1,117'.) —of which 2(57 are
steamers. The proceeds of condemned prize
property thus far reported is $14,39(3,250.51.
The postal revenue for the year ending June
30, 1 H4>4, amount to $12,438,258.78, and the
expenditures to $!2,(344,78(5.20-- , the excess of
expenditures over receipts being $20(5,(552.42.
The report of the Secretary of tin* Interior, in
relation lo Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad,
mineral discoveries, aVc., is commended to the
attention of Congress.
There have been 4,221,342 acres of public
land disposed of during the five quarters ending
30th of September hist, of which J ,538,(314 acres
were entered under the homestead law. The
cash received was $51,011),44(3. There is now
open to settlement about 133,000,000 acres of
surveyed land.
The President refers to the importance of re
modeling our Indian system. Also, to the re
markable feature in the military operations of
the year—being the attempted march of Gen.
Sherman through 300 miles of the insurgent
region. Also to the fact that 12,000 citizens in
each of the States of Arkansas and Louisiana
have organized loyal governments with a free
Constitution.
The present number of army invalid pension
ers is 22.7(37, and of navy invalids, 712. Of
widows, orphans and mothers, 22, 1 OS have been
placed on the army pension rolls, and 248 on
the navy rolls.
Tlie Message concludes as follows:
RESULTS OF THE WAR,
The war continues. Since the last annual
message, all the important lines and posi
tions then occupied by our forces have been
maintained and our arms have been steadily
advanced, thus liberating the regions left in
the rear; so that Missouri. Kentucky, Ten
nessee, and parts of other States, have again
produced reasonably fair crops.
The most remarkable feature-in the mili
tary operations of tlie year is General Sher
man's‘attempted march of three hundred
miles directly through the insurgent region,
it tends to show a great increase of our rel
ative strength, that our General-in-Chief
should feel able to confront and hold in
check every active force of the enemy and
yet detach a well appointed large army to
move on such an expedition. The result not
yet being known, conjecture in regard to it
is not here indulged.
Important movements have also occurred
during tho year to the effect of moulding so
ciety for the durability of the Union. Al
though short of complete success, it is much
in the right direction that twelve thousand
citizens in each of the States of Arkansas
and Louisiana have organized local State
Governments with free Constitutions, and
are earnestly struggling to maintain and ad
minister them. The movements in the same
direction, more extensive though less defi
nite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
should not be overlooked; but Maryland
presents the example of complete success.
Maryland is secure to liberty and Union for
sill the lutury*. The genius of Rebellion will
no more claim Maryland. Like another
foul spirit, being driven out it may seek to
tear Ler, but it will woo her no more.
At the last cession of Congrbsa a proposed
to the Constitution, abolishing
slavery throughout the United States, passed
the Senate, but failed for want of the requi
site two thirds vote in the House of Repre
sentatives. Although the present is the
same Congress and nearly the same mem
bers, and without questioning the wisdom or
patriotism of those who stood in opposition,
I venture to recommend the reconsideration
any! passage of the measure at the present
session. Of course, the abstract question is
not changed,* but an intervening election
shows almost certainly that the next Con
gress w ill pass the measure if this dues not.
Hence, there is only a question of lime as
to when the proposed amendment will go to •
the States for their action, and. as it is to go 1
at all events, may* we not agree that the!
sooner the better ? It is not claimed that I
the election has imposed a duty on niemlifc's
to change their views or their votes any I
further limn as an additional element to be i
considered, their judgment may be affected |
by it. It is tlie voice of the people, now for :
the first time heard, upon the question. In (
a great national crisis like ours unanimity of
action among those seeking a common end
is very desirable, almost indispensable, and
yet no appearance to such unanimity is at
tainable unless some deference shall he paid
to the will of the majority, simply because
it is the will of* the majority.
THE PUBLIC* spirit.
In this ease, the common end is the mum*
tcnaucc of the I nion, and among the means
to secure that end, such will, through the
election, is most clearly declared in favor of
such a constitutional amendment. The most
reliable indication ot public purpose iu this
country is derived through our popular elec
tions. Judging by the recent canvass, and
its results, the purpose of the people, within
the byal Stales, to maintain the integrity of
the Union w r as never more firm nor more
nearly unanimous than now. Tho extraor
dinary calmness and good order with which
the millions of voters mingled at the polls
gave strong assuaranee of this. Not only
all those who supported the Union ticket,
so called, but a great majority of the oppos
ing party also may be fairly claimed to en
tertain and to be actuated by the same pur
pose. It is an unanswerable argument to
• his effect, that no candidate for any office,
however high or low. has ventured to seek
votes on the avowal that he was for giving
up the Union.
There has been milch impugning of mo
tives, and much heated controversy, as to
the proper means and best mode oUat! vann
ing the Union cause: hut on the distinct
issue of Union or no Union, the politicians
have shown their instinctive knowledge that
there is no diversity among the people. In
affording to the people the fair opportunity
of showing one to another, and to the world,
this firmness and unanimity of purpose, the
election has been of vast value to the national
cause.
NATIONAL RESOURCES.
Ihe election has exhibited another fact
not less valuable to be known—the fact that
we do not approach exhaustion in the most
important branch of national resources—t' at
of living men. While it is melancholy to
reflect'Unit the War has filled so many graves
and carried mourning to so many hearts, it
is some relief to know that, compared with
the surviving, the fallen have been so few.—
While corps, and divisions, and brigades,
ami regiments have formed, and fought, and
dwindled, and gone out of existence, a great
.majority ot tlie men who composed them are
still living. The same is true of the naval
service. The election returns prove this. —
So many voters could not else be found.-
The States regularly holding elections, both
now and four years ago, to wit; California.
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois. Indiana.
lowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massa
chusetts, Michigan, Minncssota, Missouri,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, West Virginia,' and Wisconsin,
cast 3,1)82,011 votes now, against 3,870,222
cast then, showing im aggregate now of
3,082,011. To this is to be added 33,7(32
cast now in the new Statesthat did not vote
in 18(30, thus swelling the aggregate to
4,013,773, and the net increase during the
three years and a half of war to 145,551. —
A table is appended showing particulars. —
To this again should be added tho number
of soldiers in tho field from Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, Indi
ana, Illinois, and California, who, by the
laws of those States, could not vote away
from their homes, and which number cannot
be less than 00,000. Nor yet is this all. —
The number in the organized Teritories is a
trifle now to what it was four years ago,
while thousands, white and black, join ns as
the national arms press back tlie insurgent
lines.
So much is shown affirmatively and nega
tively by the election. It iv not material to
inquire how the increase has been produced,
or to show that it would ha*.v been greater
but for the war, which is probably true. —
I he important fact remains demonstrated
that we have more men no v than we had
when the war began, that we* are not ex
hausted, nor in the process c.*f exhaustion,
that we are gaining strength, and may, if
need be, maintain the contest indefinitely.—
Phis, as to men. Material rsources are
mow more complete and abinida it than ever.
THE MAINTENANCE OFTHK UNION -CONDITIONS
OK PEACE.
The natural resources then are n’liexhaust
ed. and, as we believe, inexhaustible. The
public purpose to establish and ma.'ntuin the
national authority is unchanged, and, a * we
believe, unchangeable. The manne rof con
tinuing the effort remains to choc v. On
careful consideration of all the evidt nee ac
cessible, it seems to me that no atte upt at
negotiation with the insurgent leader could
result in any good. He would accept l ath
ing short of severance of the Union, pre
cisely what we will not and cannot gl ve.—
His declarations to this effect are ex elicit
and oft-repeated. He does not attorn o! to
deceive us. He affords us no excuse to de
ceive ourselves. He cannot voluntarily* re*
accept tin* Union. We cannot voluntarily
yield it. Between him and us the issm iis
distinct, simple, and inflexible. It is an
issue which can only bo tried by war and tie*
eidod victory. If we yield we are beaten.-
If the Southern people fail him he is beaten W
Either way it would he the victory and de
feat following war. What is true, however,
of him who heads the insurgent cause, is
not necessarily true of those who follow.—
Although he cannot re-accept the Union,
they can. Some of them, we know, already
desire peace and re-union. The number (if
such may increase. They can at any mo
ment have peace, simply by laying down
their arms and submitting to the national
authority under the Constitution. After so
much the Government could not, if it would,
maintain war against them. The loyal peo
ple would not sustain or allow it. If ques
tions should remain, we would adjust them
by the peaceful means of legislation, con
ferences, courts, and votes operating only in
constitutional and lawful channels. Some
certain and other possible questions are and
would be beyond the Executive power to
adjust, as, for instance, the admission of
members into Congress, and whatever might
require the appropriation of •money. 'lne
Executive power itself would he greatly di
minished by the cessation of actual war.—
Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, how
ever, would still he within the Executive
control. In what spirit and temper this con
trol would bo exercised can be fairly judged
of by the past. A year ago a general par
don and amnesty, upon specified terms, were
offered to all except certain designated class
es, and it was at tlie same time made known
that the excepted classes were still within
contemplation of special clemency. During
the year many availed themselves o'fv.tbe
general provision, and many more wouhL
only that the signs of had faith in some IccT
lo such precautionary measures as rendered
the practical process less easy and certain.
During the same time, also, special pardons
have been granted to individuals of the ex
cepted classes, and no voluntary application
has been denied. Thus, practically, the
door has been for a full year open to all, ex
cept such as were uot in condition to make
free choice —that is, such as were in custody
or under constraint. It is still so open to
all. But the time may come when public
duty shall demand that it bo closed, and that
in lieu more vigorous measures than hereto
fore shall he adopted.
In presenting the abandonment of armed
resistance to the national authority on the
part of the insurgents as the only indispen
sable condition to ending the war on the
part of the Government. I retract nothing
heretofore said us to slavery. I repeat the
declaration made a year- ago, that while I
remain in my present position I shall not at
tempt to retract or-modify the Emancipation
Proclamation, nnr .-hull I return to slavery
any person who is tree hy the terms of that
proelumuticn or hy any of the acts of Con-
Jtt'css.. 11 flic p#>jile should, hy whatever
n.ode or menus, make it an executive duty
to re-enslnve stndt persons, another,- and not*
| L must la- their instrument to perform it.—
In stating a single condition of peace, I
mean simply to say that the war will cease
on the part of the Government whenever it
shall have ceased on the part of tiiose who
began. A input am Lincoln.

Not,Dikiis’ Christmas Dinner.—The
publishers of the Baltimore American hav
ing, in view of the large provision made in
the Northern cities for a Thanksgiving Din
ner for the soldiers of our armies of the Po
tomac, the. James and Shenandoah, reserved
the fund raised for that purpose in this State,
now propose to apply it to getting up a
Christmas Dinner lit* all the Maryland
troops. As Cecil county has unite a number
of her sons in the lield, her citizens should,
and no doub t do, feel it a duty to aid in rais
ing a sufficient amount for this generous
purpose. Convinced thut such is the case,
we have started a subscription, which we
append, and after conference with the citi
zens of this district, propose that money
contributed in the several districts, shall he
paid over to the following persons, and hy
them he handed in to this otiice, on or before
December 20th inst., when it will he for
warded to Treasurer of the Slate Fund in
Baltimore:
Ist district, Henry Hays; 2d district, T.
It. Hopper; 3d district, K. K. Kwing; 4th
district, Joseph Miller; sth district. 1,. W.
Thomas; oth district, Jesse A. Kirk, Ttlt
district, D. C. " ay ; Bth district, .1. S. Chris

It is hoped that our citizens will make tip
a fund that will he sufficient to give every
Cecil county soldier a Christmas Dinner.

Sacking ok a School House.—The

Hiliool House,” in the Eighth election dis
trict of this county, had the windows sraastK,
ed, and the stove, benches and desks car
ried out and broken to pieces hy some
Copperhead rowdies, on Wednesday night,
the 80th ultimo. The motive for this
p iecc of scoundrelism is supposed to be a
w.'iolesome dread on the part of that party,
tin it their children, if taught the rudiments
of a common English education, will desert
live negro faith of their fathers, and really
com 0 to the belief that the while race re
quin £ some care and the benefits of legis
latioi ' ns well as the colored, who have mo
nopo! iz.ed all the anxious solicitude of that
party for years.
Pan iioted. —It is with pleasure we

We congrr .tulatc him on his appointment.
Our friet id Major J. C. Hill has also been

Thing*# about Town.
REPORTED FOR THE CECIL WHIG.
Some one in want of better employment,
contented himself by cutting half off all
tUc young trees in front of the M- E. church,
sometime hist week. The trees were in a
thriving condition, but the injury done to
them will prove quite detrimental to
their growth, if it does not kill them. This,
to say the least of it, is a mean act, and the
perpetrator, if found out, should be dealt
with severely.
—As we pass along tho streets our ears
are greeted with the loud squeels of ye
porker, from the distant pig-sties, as he is
trying to resist the iron grip of the butcher
and the cold steel blade of his knife. Many
of those animals have fallen victims to the
man of* blood, and many are tbo good din
ners that have resulted therefrom. “The
work progresses favorably.” They bring,
without bristles, fifteen cents per pound.
Juvenile Socitiks. —We are glad to learn
that our remarks last week somewhat arous
ed the right-thinking portion of our commu
nity to the awful strides the cause of intem
perance was making. A Juvenile Temper
ance Society has been talked of. This
would be an excellent move, for many of
the boys of this town are sadly in need of
reformation. There can be no doubt but
that the good resulting from it would fully
pay for the trouble which might attend the
getting of it up, and keeping it in operation.
Some ten years ago a very large Juuenile
Temperance Society flourished here, and it
only went down from a dereliction of duty
on the part of the adult the eanse.
If our young friends would like to form a
Secret Society, we would recommend them
to organize a Council of Junior Sons of
America. It is a most excellent tiling, and
Is very largely represented iiv tfie f Northern
States. The leading design of the Order is
to cultivate true patriotism. We do not
think there has ever been a society of this
kind in the State, and we would be glad if
the boys of Cecil would have tin* honor of
organizing the first society iti these parts. —
We believe there are several in operation in
Delaware. Come, boys, try if yon cannot*
do something besides run the streets and loaf
about stores in the evenings. There are a
number of gentlemefi in the town who will
give you assistance in this good cause.
Signs. —We do not mean weather signs,
marriage signs or the signs of the times, but
business signs. We have no data as to when
these first came to bo used : but their origin
is very antique. The sign formerly was
something that was a facsimile of what was
inside, used or kept in the house over whose
door it was posted. Thus we have seen the
tin mortar and pestle, boot, hat, &c. These
Have in a great measure been superceded by
the painted sign with the proprietor’s name
and business on il. All trades and occupa
tions, with one exception, have fallen into
the latter modfe. The exception is the pawn
broker, who persistently adheres to the three
balls. In this matter of signs the painters
have not reached the bight of perfeemm,
long ago attained by the workers in tin, as
the signs now fall far short of being as clear
in the expression of an idea as those of the
former style. In casting our eyes at the
' signs along the street, we are often led to
think tin* “schoolmaster is abroad.” Messrs.
Wit worth A’ Perkins, the enterprising Car
riage Makers of this town, have lately put
tip one of this class. It can be seen far and
near, but it certainly reflects no credit on the
artist who painted it. I( is certainly void of
exquisite taste and artistic skill. We know
it is not a “sign” of the kind of work they
do. Our “sign” literature is in a very de
moralized condition, and is sadly in need of
doctoring. And as signs are a public mat
ter, we call attention to the subject, hoping
painters —if they have not the honor of an
acquaintance with Lindley Murray —will
get some person to properly arrange the
matter to be put on the board for them. As
about a fair specimen of the “signs” of this
town—and they are not worse than those of
other towns —we give this one ;
“C AK Es An I) liEcR EG r SaLK HEhE.”

—We have no later news from General
Sherman. A steamer left Philadelphia on
Thursday with a mail for his army. A num
ber of officers, absent on leave at the time
he started, also go by this conveyance, Gen.
Sherman having ordered them to join their
commands on the coast. The Savannah
Ur publican of the Ist inst. gives some fur
ther particulars of tin* fight with General
Foster’s forces, on tho 30th ult., near Gra
hamsville, South Carolina. General Gusta
vns Smith commanded the Rebels on the
occasion, and the engagement is admitted to
have been a drawn battle. On the night #f
the JOih seven or eight Union transports,
loaded with troops, were reported going* nj
Broad river, S. C. It is evident from this
account that our forces had held the position
they had gained on the railroad, and that
they were being reinforced. We may mo
mentarily expect news direct from Port
Royal, and have little doubt that it will
report General Sherman on the coast.
