FARMERS' NATIONAL
CONGRESS.
Annual Addresnhy Ex-Ojvernor
Hoard cT Vlct.8lii.
Fort Worth, Text. December C.
The Farmers' National Congress be
gan its annual session here tody.
Several h nod red delegates were pres
ent. Ex-Governor Hoard of Wiscon
sin delivered the annual address.
Among other things he said:
"We are just beginning to feel as a
people that agriculture is an ititelltct
nal as well as a manual pursuit; that!
from the humblet tenant to the iordli
est ranchman progress and profit de
pend on mental comprehension of the
principles involved, and an energetic
obedience to that comprthenaion
Comprehension means intellect, obedi
euce meaas ousmess. 'some men are
all intellect and no work; others are
. all work and no intellect.. The true
farmer unites , both. He is both
student and 'doer of the word '
Some tf the questions for this
farmers' congress to ask of itself are:
What can we do in an organized wsy
to help emancipate this great business
: of farming from a lack of comprehen
sionT What can we do to get the
farriers of this continent to see the ne
cessity of more intelle t on the farm?
, How can we contribute as a force, to
. the emancipation of the farm from tu
wasteful effects of ignorance, and help
put in its place tne energizing and en
riching influences of knowledge? In
Other word, what can we do to pro
mote farm education! What can this
oongress do to promote wive legisla-
, tion in the state and national legis
lative to thisendT What can this
congress do as a great force to arrest
the tendency of the American
farmer to destroy the natural fertil
ity of his farm? What can we
do to arouse public opinion and the
great educational forces of the country
to the importance of teaching the ele
ments of agricnltue in the primary
: schools of the land? Our present sys
tem of agricultural education is an im
age with a hoad of bra-s, a body of
iron, and fet of cUjf. V ar dit
, ing all oar energies to the head and
- ot the feet.
'Our common schools recruit the
academy, the collese and university,
and they, in tnrn, recrnit every profes
sion but farming. Our young men
flee to the towns and cities because
we have educated them to -do so.
Nearly every European country
is putting forth strenuous ef
forts to stop this tenden
' ev bv teaching the elements of scien-
; title agriculture in the common schols
It can be done as easily as the teach
ing of the elements of scientific
arithmetic, or chemistry, or philosophy
A great host of farmers who were de
prived of such teaching, now find
themselves barred from an understand
ing of much agricultural literature.
As a " consequence they tarn awsy
from the agricultural college, the bul-
. letin of the experiment station and the
farm paper, that n really worth any
thig to them. Had these men been
taught in their youth
in the 03mmon schools, the meaning
of the terms nsed in agricultural ehem
istry, something ot the principles of
animal husbandry, something of the
true principles which underlie the
preservation of fertility, they would
be, today, in much more harmonious
relation with all that constitutes agri
cultural progress. May we not hope
that this congress will create a senti
ment that will greatly help along this
needed educational rtform.

Ever since the building of the First
Prestyterian church, the beautiful
gray stone structure at the northwest
corner of tenth and north A has had
beneath it a "closeted skeleton" in the
way of an unfinished basement. The
men folks didn't feel so badly about
it, but the women, with truly womanly
instincts, felt as if the most casual
observer could read the signs of the
times and tell after one glance at the
cupola that the cellar was unfinished,
just the same as one can tell the con
dition of the kitchen sink by glanc
ing at the front gate. It worried
them, and the plan to finish that
portion of the otherwise model
structure has been lont in matur
ing. Last spring the ladies of
the Ladies' Aid society said that un
less some definite start was made noth
ing would ever be done. The vague-,,
ness of that stat ment, together witf

pute. Accordingly the ladies got tneir
heads together and went to work
They went forth to solicit, aud alter
about four days of good, bard, ener
getic and faithful work they had rais
ed the money. Then the actual work
began, and today the rooms are fin
ished ready to cook and eat in and to
receive company in too, if you please.
The kitchen is finished in cement and
hard wood, with everything modern and
shining. There are closets and all other
airangements. There is a good cook
ing range, a lavatory with modern
pnuinmentf.. in short everything about
the mechanical part of the culinary
deDartment to insure perfect work in
the way of cleanliness and convenience
An then the dining room, where the
dinner is to be served this evening, is
a beauty. There is an outside entrance
to it that is almost palatial, the tlor is
of hard wool, the mantel is of pressed
brick, there are pi. tures and screens
fit for a drawing room, there are good
chairs and tables, there are beautiful
lights, there is everythicg that would
make it beautiful and pleasant. The
ladies have worked like Trojans, and
well have thev been rewarded in the
elegance of the appearance ot every
thing. They were aided in their ef
forts by the two other ladies' societies
of the church, and by the liberality of
the gentlemen who helped them out
when their own resources had been all
but exhausted. The improvements
cost between $1,900 and $2,00,all told
and over $1,100 of that amount was
raised by the ladies, most of it by di
rect solicitation. ,
ToQaash the Writ cf MandamiB
Now Goin? on in Circuit Court
Btfjre Jodge J. M. Eabb The
1. asons Set Forth forQiashing
Harris Uere.
The cee of David F. White vs. the
City of Richmond, to prevent the rais
ing of rates by the Richmond Natural
Uas company, is on trial in the Wayne
circuit court. The means of its com
ing up was this:
When the case was first filed, an ap
plication was made to Judge H. C. Fox
of the Wayne cireuit for an alternative
writ of mandamus requiring the
natural gas company to com
ply with the request of the
plaintiff in the matter of rates, or to
set forth cause why such compliance
was refused. Tt.e judge issued such
writ, and the return waa made today
in the form of a motion to quash the
writ on the grounds set forth by the
defeadants. The motion to qaash was
read by Mr. Rjbbina this afternoon.
and the argument was begun. The
four reasons set forth why the writ
should, in the opinion of the defend
ant, be quashed, were as follows:
1. The writ was uncertain and in
definite, as it does not set forth or di
rect the company at what price to rell
tteirgasor what rate to establish.
! Bacaase upon the facts st t forth
in the petition and complaint, the
judge had no power or authority to is-
ue such a writ.
3. On the ground that the facts
stated in the pet tion and and com
plaint are not sufficient to warrant the
issuance of such a writ.
4. That the facts stated do "not con
stitute a sufficient cause for action.
The case will be argued from that
standpoint, pro and con, today and to
morrow, and it is expected that at the
end of that time the court will take the
matter under advisement until some
time next week, or even later, as it is
a matter of some complication and
that will require careful work.
Attorney Harris of Indianapolis is
here to lay to work on the
case for the plaintiff, and the
defense will be conducted by Jack
son & Starr, Rabbins and Study, while
Mr. Lindemuth will assist the plain-
1 . 1 s attorney. This way of bridging
n the whole matter, opening the case
n on its merits, was rather nnexpect-
e.'to the public' .The case had never
b n definitely set for trial, and a pop
ni tr misconception had b ten enter-
ta ned with regard to It. It is expeet
ed that there will be a crowded lobby
an huud tomorrow.

Tennyson." While the writer dm
not esteem Tennyson the greatest poet
who had ever lived and written, yet he
believed him indeed a master of the art

the extreme.
The next and last lecture will be in

Williams, alias May field, the rankest
fake that ever struck Richmond, was
in police court this morning charged
with visitmsr a house of prostitution.
He stated that he demanded a jury
trial. When told that if he had a jury
trial he would not be able to be tried
before Saturday afternoon owing to
the fact that the prosecutor is buey
with the grand jury.he said he guessed
he would be tried right away. The
officers testified hat he had told them
he had been in a house of i'l-fame.and
that he had perhaps left his grip
either there or in a saloon. He had
afterward found the grip in a saloon
He testified that he had been blind
drank and that he had not known a
thing that had happened. The Allender
woman on the avenue also testified
that he had been there. He denied
having been there, but admitted that
he did not know where he had been or
what he had done. When he had
finished his story the mayor fined him
$1 and costs and sent him to for
ten days besides. This gives him
twenty days in jail. As he was leav
ing the court room hs turned and
cslled the mayor a vile name, preced
ed by an oath. When he finishes his
twenty days he will be called up again
and recommitted for sixty-fonr days
for contempt of court. The mayor re
marked that the man would not get
to make any more butter this winter
unless he made it by some sort of
magic. In the meantime it is expected
that he will get to go back to Oaio to
answer for his numerous jobs
swindling there.

The report of the carriers on the two

ever may be said of the decrease the
past month, one thing is certain, and
that u that this month will come np
and probably eclipse the record of any
