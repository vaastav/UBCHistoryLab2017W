HORRIBLE MURDER
AT SAN FRANCISCO.
A Grime Recalling the Tragic Death
of Blanche Lamont.
Occurred Near the Same Place and under
Accompanying Circumstances.
Mrs. Mary Clnte Outraged and Her
Head Beaten to a Jelly With a
Coupling Pin—The Tragedy En
acted at Dusk in a Flat She Had
Just Rented in the Mission Dis
trict.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. lo.—A hor-
Jibio murder was perpetrated here at
uu.sk this evening. The victim was a
woman, and the scene of the crime was
in th; Mission district, in the vicinity
of the Emmanuel Church murders,
about Aye blocks from that edifice.
Many of the features of the crime and
Its accompanying circumstances recall
< d the tragic deaths of Minnie Williams
and Blanche Lamont.
It was about o o'clock this aft r
: oon that the dead body was found in
an upper flat at h»>3 Guerrero street ba
ilie tenants of the lower flat. The wo-
Joan had been outraged, and her lo ad
beaten to a jelly with a coupling pin,
which was found in one of the rooma.
The victim is supposed to be Mrs,
Mary Clute, a wealthy resident of Wat
sonville, Cal. She had just rented the
fiat from a Miss Blanchard, and the
noise ot Carpet laying was heard by
the people in the lower flat. The tack
ing ceased, and all was quiet for a
time, then terrible screams were heard.
The occupants of the lower fiat be
came alarmed and started to investi
gate, w hen they saw a man leaving by
un alleyway leading to the rear en
trance. They asked him the cause of
the trouble, but he vouchsafed no re
ply, and made his escape.
On going upstairs the dead body was
found. The position of the body indi
cated that the dead woman had been
outraged. The police are searching for
Miss Blanchard.
Joseph Foley, the carpet layer, who
was working in Mis. Clute's recently
rented fiat this afternoon, has been ar
retted. He says he went to the fiat at
4 o'clock, leaving at 5, but asserts that
lie knows nothing of any murder.
Foley was allowed his liberty after
Iving detained at the prison a short
time. He seems to know nothing about
the case. His assistant, Andrew Jack
son, left the house half an hour before
Foley departed at 5 o'clock.
If the police have any suspicions they
do not divuise them. No arrests have
been made up to midnight.
Foley and Jackson are employed by
the Chicago Clock Company, an "install
ment plan" house. Clute, the husband
of the murdered woman, is a traveling
salesman, and is now on the road for
The lower part of the house where the
murder occurred is occupied by L. A.
Legg, a horseman. His wife and his
aged father, George B. Legg, an invalid,
were the only persons w ho saw the as
sassin after the consummation of his
deadly deed. The eldest Legg says he
heard the sound of a falling body over-
B.ead, followed by two or three screams.
He went to the front door to summon
litlp. He says:
'Just as I and Mrs. Legs reached the
tfront porch a man came out of the small
ci ley way to the south of the house, the
entrance to the rear stairway, and
up the street toward Twenty-
Hirst street at a rapid walk. I called to
'Jiim and asked what the noise meant.
&Ie made no response, but quickened his
«teps, and then I called and asked him
"again, and then a third time, the only
jXesult being that when I made the third
*rall he started to run. He did not turn
*i round once, and I could not see his face
sit all. He was short and thick set, wore
4K dark suit of clothes and had biaek
ihair."
His rail for help "was responded to by
Sin Italian and C. W. Marks. Vice-Princi
g>al of the Everett School, who went up
stairs and found Mrs. Clute lying in a
pool of blood. Around her lay several
hair pins, and the only evidence of a
struggle was the fact that one of the
Idns was broken In two pieces and her
ti .ir was badly disarranged. Her cloth
flng when Marks arrived en the scene
•was drawn nearly up to her knees. A
lurther examination developed that th>
•woman's underclothing was torn to
rtdeces. .A later examination showed
«that nothing was stolen from the apart-
Stnents.
An examination of the body at the
ftCorane revealed the fact that the wo
man's skull had been fractured by a
fceavy blow in the region of the left side
of the occipital bone. There was a
deep cut on the risrht temple, and a
flight one over the left eve. ITer nose
■was broken, this probably being the

TERRIBLE STORMS.
A Ship Captain Tells of His Ex
perience on the Pacific.
TACOMA (Wash.), Dec. 15.—Captain
Stephens of the British ship Whittle
burn, which arrived at Port Townsend
to-day, said:
"Three times the British ship Whit
tleburn was blown out of the straits
before she succeeded in entering. The
vessel has been pursued by storms ail
the way across from Shanghai, but she
was lightly laden with ballast, and rode
through the storm practically un
harmed.
"I never saw such storms in all the
time I have been going to sea. The
gale struck us off the coast of Japan,
and followed all the way across. We
left Shanghai on October 26th, and
never sighted a vessel until about forty
miles off Flattery. There we saw four
vessels outward bound.
"During the past month I have not
had more than three hours' sleep dur
ing the twenty-four. I have lain down
only to be called back on deck again.
We were ten days off the straits, and
three times attempted to enter, but the
gale blew us out to sea again each
time. Twice we were inside Flattery,
but the gale again drove us out. Mon
day the heavy southeaster struck us
I and we were driven within two miles
of Vancouver shore before it suddenly
changed. We had all given up hope
of ever putting foot on land again. I
tell ymi, I thanked God when we
reached Port Townsend."
Captain Stephens believes that the
Cleveland was caught in just such a
j gale, and that the force of the wind
j wa such that it w as impossible to "light
! against it.
"The Pelican Is probably lost," said
Captain Stephens. "I do not believe
that she could live through the storm
that has been raging on the Pacific for
| the last month.
"There is another tramp somewhere
; outside, and I would not be surprised
to learn that she had gone down."
THREE BIG CONCESSIONS.
Granted a Californian by the Mex
ican Government.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15.—Captain
Alphonso Smith, a well known resi
dent of the coast, is in the city, hav
ing returned from the City of Mexico,

valuable concessions from the Mexican
Government.
One concession is to allow him to put

Salina Cruz, the western terminus of
the Tehuantepee Kailroad, to San
Jorge, Sonera. The line will be equip
ped with the steamers City of Mazat
lan and City of Acapulco, and the line
is aimed to make a saving of six days
to San Francisco on Panama trade.
He also has a concession for a railway
from San Jorge to Yuma, through the
Colorado River Valley, and the line will
be extended from Yuma to Kingman,
A. T. Kngineers are now at work on
the route.
The third concession gives him the
right to colonize large tracts of land
alfout San Jorge.

terprises. \

PA X ERS FIELD, Dec. IS. — Sheriff
Bergwardt has returned from Sar.

Randsburg wife murderer. He says

Taking the picture of his wife and
bal>e from his pocket, the child having

He explained to the Sheriff how an

MYSTERIOUS
OAKLAND MURDER.
Patrick Murphy Shot Down by an
Unknown Assassin.
A Bullet Pierces His Heart as He Steps
From His Cottage Door.
Staggers Back Into the Honse and
Dies in the Presence of His Ter
rified . Family, Not Having
Strength Enough to Utter the
Name of His Slayer—The Mur
derer Escapes in the Darkness.
OAKLAND, Dec. lo.—Patrick Mur
j phy, a pioneer resident of TemescaL
j was murdered by an unknown assassin
lat 3:13 o'clock to-night. He was shot
I through the heart as he left his cot
tage to go to a neighboring store, stag
j gered back into the house, and died in
i the presence of his terrified family. He
j lacked the Strength to utter the name
of the man who shot him, if he knew
who he was, and tho murderer, favored
by the isolation of the place and the
darkness of the night, escaped without
difficulty.
The police arrived within five mm;
-; utes after the* Shooting, but wore un
able to supply a motive for the crime,
or to find a clew.
There- were no witnesses to the actual
shooting, and but one man saw the
murderer flee from the scene. He
i caught but a fleeting glimpse of him as
he ran from his bloody work and his
Incomplete description is not sufficiently
accurate for the police.
Murphy, who was a street car em
ploye, reached his home at 7 o'clock
j this evening. His wife and three chil
dren, Antone Glavin, a friend, who
j Lis home with the Murphys,
and Andrew Cunningham, an old ac
quaintance of th-j family from San
Francisco, were there when he arrived,
j and the entire party took dinner to
! gether. About 8 o'clock Murphy went
out of the rear door to get some beer,
j A moment after he descended the back
j stairs the report of a gun, followed
!by groans, was heard. Mrs. Murphy,
| Glavin and Cunningham ran to the
I rear door, and as they reached it Mur-
I phy staggered to the foot of the stairs
I and fell. They helped him into the
{ honse and placed him on a chair, where
j he died without utte-rii.g a word. There
! was no evidence of a struggle.
Henry Smith of 546 Sixth street is
the man who saw Murphy's slayer Hoe
ing from the scene. He was in an
I adjoining house, and on hearing the
| shot rushed to the door in time to see
a man come out of the yard in front
|of the Murphy home, and run rapidly
j south of Tele-graph avenue. He passed
i within fifteen fit of Smith, but it was
too dark to make out more than his
' general outline. Smith says he wore a
j long overcoat and a derby hat, and
; was of medium build.
The crime is thus far a mystery which
balnea the police.
STEIN'S PASS BANDITS.
Taken to Tucson, Arizona, for Safe
Keeping.
TUCSON (Ariz.), Dec. lo.—Marshal
Griffith's posse brought the five train
robbers here from San Simon, instead
of taking thc-m to Silver City, N. M.
It is believed they would be safer here
for the present.
The officers refuse to divulge the
names of the prisoners, or to allow com
munication with them, as it is believed
that the bandits are closely allied with
Black Jack. They inquired for two
parties who have been suspected of
belonging to Black Jack's gang.
The officers claim possession of posi
tive proof that the captives are the
Stein's lass bandits. The prisoners re
fuse to afiirm or deny anything. All
are large, muscular, daring, reckless
men, and are absolutely unconcerned.
NAMES OF THE BAXDITS.
DENVER, Dec. 17*. —A special to the
"Rocky Mountain News" from Albu
querque, X. M., says:
The names of tho five train robbers
arrested Monday by the posse of Dep
uty United States Marshals under Spe
cial Wells-Fargo Ofileer J. X. Thacker
in Eastern Arizona, near the Mexican
line, are W. H. Warderman, T. S. Kcp
part, Henry Marshall, Walter Hoffman

captuie the men were taken to Tucson.
A. I\, for safe keeping, but United
Stats Marshal Foraker to-day went to
Tueson to demand their Immediate re
return to Xew Mexico, as the crime
was committed in this territory. All
the robbers are cowboys, and have no
connection with the notorious Black
Jack gang of border bandits, which has
been terrorising the people along the
southwestern border for the past three
years. They are, however, the same
gang which recently held up and rob
bed the train on the Santa Fe Pacific
at Giant's Station about a month ago,
securing funds estimated at not less
than $30,000, and it is now expected
that a considerable portion of this
money may be recovered.

Protest Against McKinley's Refer
ence to Cuban Affairs.
BIARRITZ (France), Dec. 15.—Mail
advices received from Madrid (tele
grams and telephone messages on this
subject being forbidden) says the Span
ish military journals, especially the
most important, the "Correspondencia
Militaire," declare that twenty Gen
erals have come to an agreement to
engineer a protest against President
McKinley's message to Congress, which
is considered insulting to the Spanish
army.
It is added that a certain Marshal
was asked to co-operate, but he mere
ly replied that he would consider the
matter. General Weyler made a sim
ilar request, saying he desired in the
first place to learn the opinion of cer
tain personages, the law net allowing
military men to send a collective peti
tion to the Minister of War.
Political circles are much excited at
rumors of a manifesto to the country,
which is said to be in course of prep
aration.
The Queen Reg-cnt to-day received
General Weyler, the former Captain-
General of Cuba. The audience lasted
an hour and three-quarters.

A small box, apparently made tc con
tain samples of some description, was
found this morning at Casa Nueva,
where the United States Consulate is
situated. An examination showed it
to contain a tube filled with an ex
plosive. Fortunately, the cover was
not removed in the ordinary way, but
was splintered open. Underneath the
cover was a piece of sand paper, in
tended to light a box of matches, and
thus bring about an explosion.
