THE MK9SAOK.
This document, which we are enabled to lay
before oar reader) this morning, Li a very con
densed, yet lucid, exposition of the detailed
workings of the various branches of the Got.
eminent daring the pat year.
It Is qnlto idle to state tin contents of a
paper Hie this, which will be universally read,
and almost equally ro, to express opinions
upon It to readers, each one ol whom will have
already formed opinions cf his own
If there is any part of tbla meuKge which we
should eelect for especial praise In respect lo
point and style, it Is the opening part, In respect
to the foreign aspect ot our domestic troubles.
It would be Impossible to present, with more
clearness, the considerations which should die
made the Europe in nations from intervening
In favor of the rebellion, and which should Ii -duce
them to desire the early and complete
restoration of the national aalh rlty. At tie
same time, tbe'meesage recognises, with dignity
and firmness, the great fact that we must rely,
In onr foreign relation, not upon the wisdom
or forbearance of others, but upon our strength
and preparation for conlingencies.
A pervading feature of this m-ssage, is the
just purpose of leaving to the legislative branch
of tbe Government tint control of great ques
tlons of public pulley, too often wrested from
it heretofore, by Executive encroachments
This Is particularly true of questions relating
to slavery, which the Pn ld -nt remits to Con
grew wl'.h very few p'e I ecnrnerilill 'ii
and with the rxprrs-iou ol only the elugir
general view, thit extrem menures should
not be hastily resolved upon.
The recommendat'on of measures In aid ot
the colonization of negroes, including, if found
necesry and advisable, the acquisition cf
territory for that purpose, will, we trut, be
promptly seconded by Congrev. It strikes at
the root of the strongest pipular prejudice
against the emancipation of slaves, which is
the appreheoslou (however unfounded in real
ity) of being' ovtrrun," as the phrase Is, by
free negroes. If tbe means of colonizing them
are provided, thU sort of apprehension will be
abated, and perhaps removed. A good deal
may be done in this direction, without the de
lay and dl-cu'slons lnident to tbe acquisition
of territory specially for that purpose. In ad
dition to Liberia, and especially to Hayti, both
offering Immediate Inducements to colored
colonists, th 're are other regions In Mexico
and South America where they would now be
gladly received.
lo what he iays of the Confiscation Act, (so
ailed,) passed at the extra session of Congress,
the President, In one sentence, epeaka of the
slaves tffected by It, as ' liberated," and yet
in another, seems to speak of tbem as trans
ferred to tbe United States, to be disposed
of by the United States. He adds. wbil-
taking this view of th subj-ct, that similar
legislation may be expected from some of the
States, and that the p-nperty which they may
thus acquire in confiscated slaves, miy be pur
chased from tbem, or accepted from them for
taxes, by the United States, with a view to tbe
liberation of such slaves.
Whatever principles of legislation on this
abject may be adopted by tbe States, it Is quite
oertain, we think, that Congress provided, at
the extra session, for the lib-ration of slaves
employed for tbe purpo-ses of tCo rebellion by
their masters. It relieved slaves so employed
from all claims upon their labor from their
masters, and It Is Impossible to nm words which
more unequivocally give freedom to slaves.
Congress intended preci ely that, and not to
transfer such slaves as property to the nation,
to be still held as ekvei. by it.
The President surprises us somewhat by tbe
statement, tbat large Dumbers cf slaves, com
ing witbln the range ol the Confiscation Act,
are now in the baudt ot the United States to
be dispos d of. Ldrge numbers of slaves have
come within our military Hues, and still remain
there, at Fortress .Monroe, Port Royal, and
elsewhere, but we wer not aware that meas
ures had been taken to seperate, by proper
evidence, such as come within the Confiscation
Act, from those-who do not come within it.
Undoubtedly, some additional and remedial
legislation is needed, on tbal bead, to carry
out tbe principle ot the Confiscation Act
Even if not extended, tbat act will liberate
hundreds of thousands of slaved, with proper
measures to facilitate tbe taking and preserva
Hon of the proofs of their tmployment In the
rul lury tervicu of the rebellion. The vantage
ground ibtained in this act, by the friends ol
emancipation, mutt be tenaciously held and ira.
proved. It is a wedge already set, and only
neeas to oe unven by vigorous blows.
The President takes a very favorable view
of the general progress of the war, and a view
eertainly correct In Its main features. He does
not exaggerate the unanimity and steadiness
of the loyal States in furnishing men aid
money lor the maintenance of the Union. As
to the condition of things Insome of the border
States, especially Kentucky and Missouri, we
should be a good deal better eatltfied than we
are, 11 It appeared to us precisely as it does to
tbe President.
The mewage.at Its conclusion, very properly
points out that this war is u war for the preser
vation of the vital principles of the Govern
mint, a-salled by filee theories upon tbe sub
ject of capital and labor. The President vin
dicates the true American principles In a very
bappy, striking, and original maauer. We will
hope and believe that, If he had not been re-
str lined from the eipressiou of bis personal
sentiments by the reserve and caution appro
priate to bis official station, be would Dave
gono one step further, and pointed out that the
opposite theories wbloh he combats with such
fnvlnclb)e. power of. reason, spring, and will
never cease to spring, from tbe system of chattel
levery, and that we'never can become a henr-
i-en uus and republican people so long as tbat
ysirm diseases any part of the body politic

next day, by a force of about five thousand
ineu, which could be easily spared even in, ad

'hat they would be very glad to enter our
lines lor tne purpose generally or obtaining
employment The men ot the steamer McClel
lan, when they were at Beaufort, could have
brought away a full load ot them had they been
authorized to do so. Tbe "contrabands"
crowded around them, begging to be allowed
the privilege of getting on board. Quite a
number assated in loading the lumber, for

worked, the men say, ' like good fellows."
Thirteen of them were: finally taken to Hilton

Oh Monday afternoon, n Rqnadron of rebel
cavalry, ISO strong, chirged on the pickets of
Blenker's division statioaof on Cox's faro, near
Annandale. The vldettes at first supposed
them to be the 'Lincoln Cavalry. When their
real character was discovered, and the alarm
was given, Lieutenant I'urnell.of the New Yotk
Mounted Hides, summoned hit force, only thir
ty-even men, to the assistants of the pickets,
lie dlscove red and captured orfe of the rebels,
and one of bis men another. Company A, ol
the Fdrty.-flflh Pennsylvania reglrient, sop
ported him. A private or tbal company,
named Huloenberg, was shot through the base
of the neck, and instantly killed. His murderer
wan captured while in the ajt of taking the
boot off the feet of his viulim. The fleelness
of the rebels saved them from coming in con
tsct with a strong reinforcement of cavalry,
which left Hunter's Chapel npon tho first news
o. tbe iklrmish. As twelve of oar men were
missing at roll-call, It was thought that they
had been captured by the rebels ; but, yester

turned to camp.
The body of private Huloenberg was con
veyed to the Blenker Dlvi-lon Hospital, and
the prisoners brought to this city, under guard,

Talk on 'Change.
Tbe correspondence between a body of mer
chants in Liverpool and L-jrd John Russell, an
extract of which has been published, took
airnt of the habitues of the fUgs by surprise.
The general feeling li.ii prevailed that the
British ministry would regard tbe restraint on
the exportation of cotton as something worthy
of their immediate attention, but Lord John
coolly replies, as much as to say, tbat ills none
of bis business. Although the stock of Ameri
can cotton my be nearly exhausted by tbe
close of next month. (December.) it miv
well be considered that, with the Increase of
receipts irnm tdsi mm, tne rnlil-t cn be kept
In operation, u.der short time, until tbe first
day of May next, or later. The demand (or
good falls off each succeeding week, and all
the British Government can do to frustrate the
starving of the millions of operatives, who are
denendlni: on coltnn. is to contribnts fnrthnlr
support. In the year 1800, the Importation of
coiioo irom me unitea btaies into Ureat
Britain was 59,253 bales. In 1410, It had In
creased to 310,671. In 1611, there was a slight
Increase. In 1812, war was declared by the
United States against Great Britain, and ex
portation of cotton censed, and were not re
sumed until the month of April, 1813. It will
thus Be seen tbat England got along altbout
American cotton for a space of time of nearly
three years.
There has been some talk of entirely preter
mitting the planting of cotton seed the next
season; tbat It will be tbe wisest pol.oy fjr
cotton fields to be turned Into corn, wheat, and
potatoes. Then we shall have a large over
production, and a complete surfeit of produols
perishable In their nature, while cotton will
maintain Its own without deterioration. A
division of plautlng or raiding can be success
fully carried out that is, raucb less than usual
can be planted, and cereals and esculents In
general be largely Inoreased, also beans and
peas. Among the most unreasonable and un
wise suggestions reoently broached is tbat be
fore the Legislature of illaalulnnl. in nmhihi.
by statute, any ootton seed from being planted'
until the present crop is sold. This reminds us

Georgetown, D. 0., Dec. 2, 1881.
3b tht Editor of IKt Xalional Republican:
8m : I have noticed, from time to time, that
you take a deep interest in tbe welfare of our
sick soldiers, and that you mako inquiries
personal inquiries from your ofilce, as to their
state. I read with great pleasure your flatter,
ing mention of the officers of tbe Union Hos
pital, at Georgetown, one celebrated for its
care and comfort for the sick and for its meagre
mortality lists; but I noticed au omission
among the names of the gentlemen commended,
which you perhaps will be good enough to ul
low me to repair. The Union Hospital It in
debted to Surgeon A. N. McLaren, a leading
oflber of the regular army, and many years in
its service, for the greater part of the comtorts
and the excellent attention which the sick in
that establishment receive.
Dr. McLaren and not Downing is the bead
of the hospital; and bis admirable manage
ment and generous feeling so well regulate
the labors of all those who are In positions
under him, tbat many lives are saved and many
a poor soldier's heart cheered la that house,
by following out the wishes of the kind-hearted
McLaren. Nearly all (heir patients are con
valescing; and you should have seen them
assemble for their tplecdld Thanksgiving
dinner. There were long tables covered
with cloths beautifully set out, and provided
with everything the .market could afford.
Sixteen turkeys, weighing from fourteen to
twenty pounds, all kinds of vegetables, oysters,
rout apples, puddings, coffee, chocolate, bas
kets of fruit in fact, everything harmless aid
good that could be bad, was purchased at Dr.
McL jren's order the day before, by " Leary,"
the Intelligent and efficient hospital steward.
The lady-nurses here, whose devotion to the
fever patients Is one of the noblest facls of tbe
war, took as much pride in decorating the
tables as If their own brothers were lo partake,
and it wo'ild have done your kind heart good
to see tbe poor fellows eat. But turkeys are
no uric thing in this Union Hospital. Tbey
have chickens regularly three times a week,
oysters every elay. and roast apples, egg-oogg,
and brown stuut, without stint. It was other
telle aader the rule of tbe doctors who preceded
Surgeon McLaren, but they happily are gone,
ana tne union Hospital may now oe proua oi
lis sgrgeons and Its nurses.
