PUBLIC BUILDINGS,
The secretary of the Interior asks atten
tton to the want of room in tbe publio build-
logs of the oapitol, now existing and in pro
gress of construction, for the aocommudt
lion of tbe clerical foroe employed and of
tbs public records. Necessity has compelled
tbe renting of private buildings Indifferent
parte of the city for the location of publio
omoea, lor wniun a large amount ot rent la
annually paid, while the separation of offices
belonging to tbe aame department impede
the tran notion of current business. The seo
retary suggeata that the blooka surrounding;
Liaiayetie tqaare on ibo ea.t, north, and west,
be purchased aa tbe site for new edifice for
the aooommodation of the government offi
oes, leaving the aquare ite'f intact; and that
if such building were constructed npon a
harmoniona plan ot architecture, they would
add much to the beauty of tbe national oapi
tol, and would, together with I be treasury
and the new state, 'navy, and war department
building, form one of the most imposing
group of pnblio odifioea in the world.
AaaiOULTUKAL MATIKBS.
The commissioner of sgrioulture ezpreaaea
the confident belief that hie efforts in behalf
ot the production ot out own sugar and tea
bare bee a encouragingly rewarded. The im
portance of the results attained have at
traoted marked attention at home, and have
received tbe apeoial consideration of foreign
nation. The aucoeaaf ul cultivation of our
own tea, and the manufacture of our own
sugar, would make a difference of many mil
lions of dollars annually in the wealth of the
nation.
The report of the commto ione r sake atten
tion particularly to the continued prevalence
of an infectious and contagious oattle disease,
known and dreaded in Europe and Aaiaa
oattle plague, or pleuro-pneumonia. A mild
type of this disease, in certain sections of our
country, is the oocasioa of great loss to our
farmers, and of serious diaturbanoe to onr
trado with Great Britain, which furnishes a
market for moat of our live stock and dreased
meats. The value of neat oattle exported
from the United State for the eight months
ended August SI, 1880, was more than fl2,
000,000, and nearly double the value for the
aame period in lb79. an unexampled inoreaae
of export trade. Tour early attention ia sol
icited to thia important matter.
EDUCATION.
' The oommlaaioner of education re porta a
oontinned inoreaae ot publio interest in edu
cational affair, and that the pnblio achoola
generally throughout the oountry are well
auatained. Industrial training is attracting
deaerved attention, and coll gea for inatruo
tlon, theoretical and prat leal, in agriculture
and the meohanlo arts, including the govern
ment achoola recently established for the in
struction of Indian 3 oath, are gaining steadi
ly in publio estimation. The commission
er aaka special attention to tbe depredations
oommited on the land reserved for the fu
ture aupport of publio instruction, and to the
very great need of help from tho nation for
achoola in the territories and in the southern
states. The recommendation heretofore made,
ia repeated and urged, that an eduoational
fund be act apart from the net proceeds of the
sales of the publio lands annually, the income
of which, and the remainder ot the net annual
proceeds, to be distributed on seme satisfac
tory plan to the states and territories and the
District of Columbia.
TBH DISTBICT OF COLUMBIA.
The buoocm of the publio achoola of the Dis
trict of Columbia, and the progress made, un
der the intelligent direotion of tho board of
education and the superintendent, in eupply
ing the educational requirementa of the die
triot, with thoroughly trained and tffloient
teachers, ia very gratifying. The acta of con
gress, from time ti time, donating publio
lands to the sevetal states and territories in
aid of educational interest, have proved to be
wise meaaurea of publio policy, resulting in
great and lasting benefit. It would seem to
be a matter of simple Justice to extend the
benefits of thia legislation, the wisdom of
which has been ao fully vindicated by experi
ence, to the Diatriot of Columbia.
I again commend the general interests of
the Diatriot of Columbia to the favorable
consideration of congress. The affairs ot the
District, aa shown by the report of the com
missionera are in a very aatisfaotory condi
tion. In my annual messages heretofore, and in
my special message of December 19, 1879, I
have urgad npon the attention of oongress the
necessity of reclaiming the marshes of tbePo
tomao adjacent to the capital, and I am con
strained by it importance to advert again to
the anbjeot. These flats embrace an area of
several hundred acres. They are an impedi
ment to tbe drainage of the city, and seriously
impair its health. It is believed that, with
this substantial improvement of its river
front, the capital would be, in all respects,
one of the most attractive citlea in the world.
Aside from its permanent population, this
city ia necessarily the place of residence of
persons from every section of the country, en
gaged in the pnblio service. Many others re
side here temporarily, for the transaction of
business with tbe government.
It should not be forgotten that the land so
quired will probably be worth the cost of re
claiming it and that the navigation of the
river will be greatly improved. I therefore
again invite the attention of congress to the
importance of prompt provision for this
much-needed and too long delayed improve
ment. The water suyply of the city is inadequate.
In addition to the ordinary uae thrognoutu
the city, the oonaumption by government ia
necessarily very great in the navy yard, arsen
al and the various departments, and a large
quantity ia required for the proper preserva
tion of tbe numerous parks and the cleansing
ot sewers. I recommend that this subject
receive the eirly attention of congress, and
that in making provision for an increased
supply, such means be adopted aa will have in
view the f ature growth of the city. Tempo
rary expedienta for such a purpose cannot but
be wasteful of money, and therefore unwise.
A more ample reservoir, with corresponding
facilities for keeping it filled, should, in my
judgement, be oonstruotcd. I commend again
to tbe attention of congress the subject of the
removal, from their present location, ot the
depots of the several railroads entering tbe
eltyi and I renew the recommendations of
my former messages in behalf ot the erection
of building for the congressional library
the eojapletion ot the Washington monument
and of liberal appropriations in support of
tbe benevolent, reformatory and penal insti
tutions of the District.

IIis Coffin, Some people appear to
find real enjoyment in keeping a coffin,
looking at it daily, trying it on to see
how it fits etc. The irrepressible
Bernhardt, when she feels like having
a little quiet fun, lays down in a coffin
and fancies herself in a graveyard. It
must be extremely edifying, and as
'Artemus Ward would say, -for those
who like that sort of a thing, this must
be the sort of thing they would like."
Now, a West Virginia man carried
this coffin business to the extreme lim
it of felicity. About, thirty-five years
. ago he planted two seeds to raise his
own coffin. One of these died, which
was a pity, for he might have raised a
coffin for his wife at the same time;
but the other flourished and grew.

A Mountain Railway.
A correspondent of the . Denyer
Tlnf, describing the extension of the
Denver and Rio Grande Railway from
Conejos westward toward the San Juan
country, gives these picturesque bits.
lie says:
For miles the railway curved among
tbe hills, keeping sight of the plains and
catching frequent glimpses of the vll
lage. its innumerable windings along
tue brows of the hills seemed, in mere
wantonness, as loth to abandon so
beautiful a region. Almost impercep
tibly the foothills changed into niouu
tains and the valleys deepened into can
ons and winding around the point of
one of the mountains it foubd Itself
overlooking the picturesque valley or
canon of Los Finos-creek. Eastward
was the rounded summit of the great
mountain of San Antonio; over the
nearest height cou.d be seen the tup
of bierra lilanca, canopied with per
petual clouds; in front were castellat
ed crags, art-like monuments, and stu
pendous precipices. Having allured
the railway into their awful fastnesses,
tbe mountains seemed determined to
baffle its further progress. But it was
a strong hearted railway, and, although
a little giddy 1,000 feet above the stiem.
it cuts its way througn the crags . and
among the monuments and bears on
ward for miles up tne valley. A pro
jecting point, too high for a cut and
too abrupt for a curve, was overcome
by a tunnel. The track layers are now
busy at work laying down' the 6teel
rail at a point a few miles beyond this
tunnel: Tbe grade is nearly complet
ed for many miles further. From the
present end of the track for the next
four or five miles along the grade, the
scenery is unsurpassed by any railroad
scenery in North America. Engineers
who have traversed every mile of
mountain railroad in the Union assert
that it is the finest they have seen.
Perched on the dizzy mountain side, at
an altitude of 0,500 feet above the sea
greater than that of Veta pass 1,000
feet above the valley, with battlement
ed crags rising 500 or 600 feet above,
the beholder is enraptured . with the
view. At one point the canon nar
rows into an awful gorge, apparently
but a few yards wide and nearly 1,000
feet in depth, between almost perpen
dicular walls of granite. Here a high
point of granite has to be tunneled, and
in this tunnel the rock men are at work
drilling and blasting to complete the
passage, which is now open to pedes
trians. The frequent explosions of the
blasts echo and re-echo among the
mountains until they die away in the
distance. Looking down the valley
from the tunnel, the scene is one never
to be forgotten, The lofty precipices,
the distant heights, the fantastic mon
yments, the contrast of the rugged
crags and the graceful curves of the
silvery stream beneath them, the dark
green pines interspersed with poplar
groves, bright yellow in their autumn
foliage, that crown the neighboring
summits height, depth, distance, and
color combine to constitute a land
scape that is destined to be painted
by thousands of artists, reproduced
again and again by photographers, and
to adorn the walls of innumerable par
lors and galleries of art Beyond the
tunnel for a mile or more the scene is
even more picturesque, though of less
extent. The traveler leoks down into
the gorge and sees the stream plunging
in a succession of snow-white cascades
through narrow cuts between the per
pendicular rocks.
Saving an Hour's Sleep.
A man living near Bloom Geld, N. J.,
has contrived an arrangement by the
use of which he is enabled to get an
hour or more of extra sleep in the
morning, and in other ways he finds it
of great benefit. In many ways it
takes the place of a domestic servant.
The gentleman has thought out and
put into practical working an idea that
occurred to him about a year ago. He
is awakened in tbe morning by a shrill
whistle. He at once gets out of bed,
for he knows what that whistle means.
It tells him that all is ready for him to
get breakfast. He dresses and goes
into the kitchen, and there he finds a
bright, fresh fire, a teakettle full of
boiling water, and other conveniences
for preparing his morning meal. All
this is accomplished by means of an
alarm clock with weights, a peice of
wire, a sheet of sandpaper, and some
matches. Taper, wood, and coal are
put into the grate of his cooking stove,
and a teakettle filled with water, and
having a tiny whistle fitted into the
nozzle of the kettle, is placed on the
stove. By setting the alarm in the
clock he can have a fire at any time he
wishes, When the alarm in the clock
goes off, a weight falls and hits the
wire ; the wire moves and scrapes the
matches fastened to it on the sandpa
per; tbe matches light the paper in the
stove, the paper fires the wood and
coal, and soon a fire is under way. In
a little while the water in the teaket
tle boils, and then the tiny whistle
gives the note of warning that every
thing is ready and it is time to get up.
"Simple thing, and yet what a com
fort it is," the inventor says. "There
is no getting up for me now ah hour
before breakfast, losing that amount
of sleep, and then waiting around for
breakfast. The arrangement cost next
to nothing, and it is as trustworthy as
anything in this world. I have not
had it patented yet. Some persons ad
vise me to, and perhaps I may. 1
haven't any for sale; got it up entirely
for my own comfort and convenience,
and it has more than repaid me already.
But just think, if it were in general
use it would save many hard words
and do away with considerable domes
tic unbappiness among poor people.
Doubtless it might have a tendency to
make a better feeling between some
men and their wives, by settling the
vexing question as to who should get
up in the morning and build the fire.
Out of this question alone many di
vorce suits grow, and this arrangement
would prevent tnem "
