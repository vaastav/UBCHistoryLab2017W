the balance of the stock subscriptions re
quired to put the big union stock yards
in motion The cattle sea on is coming
on and the people of Fort Worth should
prepare to monopolize this grand trade
by providing facilities to handle it This
city is not asked to donae anything but
those men whose interests are to be pro
moted are asked to take stock in an In
vestment which in every other city has
proved a paying one Anything calcula

Worth should appeal to the sympathy and
active aid of retail dealers and this move
ment to concentrate in this city the live
stock trade of Texas is one in which they
should heartily coop rate
IT WILL PAY
Were the railroads running into Texas
to make a winter tourists ticket of 1
cent a mile it would be no less rate than
ihat given by the Santa Fe and by the
Central to Galveston from interior Texas
points in the summer L st summer
these two roads sold round trip tickets
from Fort Worth to Galveston for 6 00
when the straight fare is over 10 00 one
way If it had not been prcfiable these
roads would not have made such speci 1
rate But it paid the roads to sell a
round trip ticket for only twothirds the
price of the regular fare one way So
with the Frisco that made money carry
ing Texans to the St Louis meeting of
the Grand Army of the Republic
The people are not asking the railroads
to do something lor nothing A special
winter tourists rate to all points in
Texas will pay the railroads as well as
benefit the state

PROTECT TEE BISON
News comes that hunters are at work
in the Panhandle of Texas finishing the
work of exterminating the buffaloes that
remain in the country twentythree hav
ing been killed not long since This
should be prevented if possible There
is no law on the statute books of Texas
Interdicting the killing of these animals
but the people should as much as possi
ble be a law unto themselves Some
years ago a New York firm commenced
this system of slaughter in an organized
and re entless manner Hunters scoured
the prairies and shot down these animals
by the thousand wiile others followed
them taking off the skins and leaving the
flesh to rot in the sun upon
the prairies In this way something
in the neighborhood of 250000
were killed and the race was supposed to
be practically extinct As a matter of
fact however where there was once mil
lions of buffaloes there are now in ail
the United S ates about 500 remaining
Fifty of these are in the Yellowstone
park protected by the government fifty
or thereabouts are enclosed in the Good
night pasture in Texas and are protected
by the cowboys the remainder are scat
tered in small herds of from ten to fifty
in various sections but principally in
the Texas Panhandle By proper csre
and treatment they may again become
numerous and give to America a large
supply of this peculiarly national game
The few that remain should be protected
end every effort should be made
to Insure and speed a large
increase There are lands suitable for
them that will not be invaded by the
agriculturalist for a century and as time
soes on this species of animal must con
tinue to become more and more valuable
The sm of extermination committed some
years ago may be atoned for by proper
efforts and the country enriched by the
multiplication of these animals Will
not our Panhandle friends take the
initiative and stop the slaughter until the
Legislature meets when suitable laws
for their protection may be passed

Gainesville Hesperian The Hesperian
heartily endorses the Foit Worth Ga
zktte in its demand of the railroads to
aff > rd excursion and Immigrant rates to
Texas The railroads have been liberal
to all but TtxiS Excursionists have
been carried through for years to Cali
fornia and to Mexico but no offers are
made to induce excursion or immigrant
parties to come to Texas and inform
themselves or make investments By all
means the railroads should at once
throueh the traffic association start the
tide Texasward
Henrietta Enterprise The Fort Worth
Gazette ever alive to the interests cf
Texas is now urging the necessity of a
cheap excurbion rate for prospectors
This is just now the great need of this
country to induce immigration to come
here ard see the best country on eartb
for the poor nr rich man If just half the
money and effort was spent to advertise
Texas and bring her resources before the
world that has been done for California
thpre would be thousands of home
seekers coming to onr state who are now
soing to the Pacific coast Texas is
truly a grand country Let our people
so advertise her to the world
Corpus Christl Caller The Fort
Worth Gazette wants to know why the
railroads are bringing no passengers to
Ttxas The reason is there are no induce
ments offered by the railroads or the
Ttxis people The former have their
rates bigi while the latter have crawled
into their shells and are as exclusive as
clams
Throckmorton Times The Fort Worth
Gazette is doing good work fir the state
in calling for cheap passenger rates to it
When the attention of the railroads run

and California it would seem that they
would need no further urging in the mat

Belton News The Gazette thinks

Arkansas City Republican The Fort

note
ilium
Thfl Situation
Philadelphia Record
It has been conceded oy all parties that
it is neither prudent nor safe to collect
into the federal treasury as any time a
revenue largely in excess of necessary ex
penditure It has also been generally
agreed that the yearly surplus under our
present tax system will not fall below
aioooooroo
Tnc R publican party proposes to re
duce surplus revenue in the proper
amount by repealing the taxes on whiskey
and tobacco or by the alternative of par
tial r peal and increased expenditure tor
pensions education and internal im
provements There are a few Republi
cans in C mgress who would prefer a re
duction of revenue by tariff revision
Tne Democratic party favors reducing
the surplus revenue by putting the raw
materials of manufacture UDon the free
list and by such further modifications as
shall cheapen the cost of living retaining
the taxes on whisky and tobacco A few
Democrats prefer a repeal of internal
revenue tixes and the retention of tariff
duties without material change
The Democrats have a majority of fif
teen in the House of Representatives and
must shoulder the responsibility of fram
ing a meaure of tax reduction which
both parties concede to be necessary
The President will undoubtedly r < com
mend to Congress a measure of tariff re
vision consonant with the party pledges
and the desire of the me j > rity
In thi3 contingency unless the policy
of the Democratic partv shall be affirmed
by organizing the House to carry it into
effect a surrender of the Democratic posi
tion will nave been made in advance of
any effort to sustain it
It is the old question of whether the
dog shall wag tne tail or the tall wag the
dog If President Cleveland and Mr
Carlisle propose to settle it as it was
settled in the oreanizilion of the Forty
ninth Congress they will take a grave re
sponsibility and manifest a cowardly re
luctance to face the consequences of
doing what they firmly believe to be
right We hope for better things

To the Eallroad Officials of Texas
Gentlemen Please dont waste any
valuable time jne days good honest
work for Texas right now is worth more
than a months yes two months in the
summer season in giving the people ex
cursions What is wanted by the people
of Texas today is business The drouth
is passed and s now considered ancient
history by progressive people and it was
more sinned against than sinned As yon
well know Texas Is not the only state or
section that has been short on rain The
fact is that Texas has fared much better
than many states as far as rain and crops
go and please do not mention
anything about the interstate
chestnut as an excuse for not tklng ac
tion at once We all well know that
other states and sections and the rail
roads running through those states and
sections par no attention to the inter
state law or at least it does not prevent
them the railroads ond people from
taking care of working for their interest
Therefore it la suggested and desired by
the people that we rather co to work
Immediately or have is understood that

The use of my name in connection

Mills I have drawn no bill I have
not been commissioned to draw one I
am cillecting some data to assist me to
conclusions on certain points but I have
authorized no one to put my name to any
bill Mr Mills is all the more sensitive for
the reason that his name is rrentloned for
the chairmanship of the ways and means
committee and it gives him the appear

Presidents message and the conclusions
of the conference now in progress be
