Washington Dec 17The United
States ship Buffalo now at Panama
with seven hundred marines on board
has been ordered to sail at once for
Corinto The action was taken to
day as the result of a telegram re
ceived by the government from the
United States consul at Managua in
which it is stated that Zelaya In his
message resigning the presidency
made unpleasant references to Ameri
cans and on account of a report
there that his followers have been
armed with daggers United States
itlzens have appealed to the consul
ts for aid
Another telegram from the consul
e said that it is rumored that when
driz arrives in Managua tomorrow
laya will formally surrender the
Ice of president to the national
sembly and that body has already
celved Instructions from Zelaya to
te for Iras This varies from re
orts received here that Zelaya him

ere Is that by the selection of Irias
Selaya will still retain hold on the
power and continue to dominate the
situation
The Buffalo on reaching Corinto
will take all necessary steps to safe
guard Americans properly Rear Ad

for the new pavement on Garden
street had been broken and this was
put up to rather reckless lautomobil
driving The chief said tbt the curb
ing had been damaged by an autoist
but he could not tell who it was Then
Mr Williams a member of the board
said that those automobiles come
around corners too dm fast and
some of the other members nodded
In assent The point desired by tho
members was to know whether or
not the autoists had any more privi
lege of the streets than did any oth
er sort of a vehicle They were In
formed by the terms of the ordinance
that they had not While Chief Sand
ers received no instructions the board
will look to him for enforcement 01

of the board said that I saw an offi
