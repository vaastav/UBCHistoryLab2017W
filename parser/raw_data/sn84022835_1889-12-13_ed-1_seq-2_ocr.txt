A THIEVING OFFICIAL.
The Cashier to the Sersieant-at-Arms of
the National House of Representative
Abscond With STS.OOO-l'robably Goae
j to Join the Canadian Colony.
WAsn i ngton, Dec. 6. From present
appearances Edward Silcott, cashier of
the sergeant-at-arms of the House of
Representatives, has fled, carrying off
72,000 of the funds entrusted to his
, care.
t Silcott was a trusted man who came
here from Ohio, and was appointed by
I Mr. Leedom when that gentleman as-
' snmed office six vears ago. He had
, that ho had been detained but would
return Monday night. A similar mes
sage reached his wife in this city.
As he did not appear Tuesday Mr.
Leedom was fearful that he had been
overtaken by somo accident, but to sat
isfy rising suspicions began an investi
gation. The information that Silcott
had drawn his bank balance deepened
the suspicions and the inquiry was
pursued. The enormous office safe
could not be opened at the moment, as
Silcott had the combination, but when
an entrance was finally effected it was
found that somo $:50,00o", set apart for
the use of the paying teller was intact.
The next inuuirv was made at the
. - Treasury Department and Mr. Leedom
was stunned by the result. He was in
formed that Silcott had called there
Saturday and had drawn about $72,000.
It was jiossible for him to draw this
large sum without exciting comment,
as he had for a long time been charged
with the duty of collecting tho money
with which the salaries of the Repre
sentatives are paid.
Silcott is under bonds in the sum of
$50,000, his bondsmen numbering about
fifteen persons. This is, however, an
indemnity bond given to the sergeant-at-arms
and Mr. Leedom, who is him
self bonded in the sum of 50,000, is
directly responsible for the shortage.
Mr. Leedom says that he would have
trusted Silcott to any sum of money.
Mr. Leedom says that it was within
Silcott's power to carry off not less than
150.000 instead of the $72,000 which is
missing. It was suggested by a person
standing near that to have
carried off the balance would have
chaliged the nature of the crime from
emberlenient to theft and have sub
jected the perpetrator to extradition,
even in Canada, whither it is already
rumored tho missing man has fled.
It is stated that Mr. .Leedom was
victimized once before by the iinmeui-
ate predecessor of Silcott, but to an
amount insignificant in comparison
with his present loss.

SALT TARIFFS.
Tan Kaaiu Railroad CommUsloaers Ad
Jiwt the Rate.
Topeka, Kan., Dec. 8. The Kail
road Commissioners have rendered
their decision in the matter of the com
plaint of the Board of Trade and salt
producers of Kingman of unfair dis
crimination in railroad rates on salt.
The Board, after reviewing the facts in
the case, sav:
"We are of the opinion that the salt
tariffs to local points need revision in
the interest of all those concerned.
But this involves so many adjustments,
not only as it respects the salt interests,
but as well those that concern the car
riers, that its final consideration will bo
entered upon at another time, and
further notice to parties in interest.
"Upon the complaint before us Ave
find and decide that the rate on salt
from Kingman, Anthony and Welling
ton should bo the same to all Missouri
river points as the rate on like com
modities from nutchinson, Nickerson
and Sterling, and tho board directs and
orders that such rates be made uniform
from all the points above named.
"The board also finds that tho fuel
used in the manufacture of salt is slack
coal supplied from tho coal mines of
Southeastern Kansas. The cost of this
per ton delivered at Wellington is $45,
and the freight rate is $1.70; at King
man, 2.65, and the freight rate $2; at
Anthony $2.75 per ton, and the freight
rate $2. and Hutchinson $2.40 per ton
and freight rate 81.80. We think that
in justice to so important an industry
as the salt manufacture in this State a
concession should be made on these
rates as follows:
"Kate on coal slack to Wellington
$1.30 per ton and to all the other points
of salt manufacture in the State SI .50
per ton. And believing under existing
circumstances that these rates would
be fair and reasonable the board or
ders and directs that these rates on
coal slack, together with uniform rates
on salt to Missouri river points, be
adopted and made effective upon all
railroads operating to any of the points
named by December 15, 18S9."

MONEY SAVED.
What the Missouri State Board Has SaTed
to the People.
Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 8. Mr.
Downing, of the State Railroad Com
mission, says that a single decision of
the Commission rendered in a coal case
several months ago, in which this city
was interested, saves to the city $750,
COO a year. The figures weregiven him
by George II. Nettleton, who is one of
the most thorough railroad ac
countants in the? country. Ac
cording to the decision the
coal rate was reduced from 55 to 35
cents per ton. Mr. Downing claims
that the State Railroad Commissioners
have saved the people millions of dol
lars since the body was called into ex
istence. As to the effect of Missouri
river transportation ujon freight rates
he was not prepared to talk, but
thought the importance of the enter
prise has been greatly overrated. He
said if it saved to merchants $500,000 a
year it would be a grand success.

Greer and T. P. Young represented
Judge Keller, and W. II. Pope, Alex
ander Pope and James Turner repre
sented the wife. Mr. Greer addressed
the court at length on bohalf of his
client. When ho concluded W. II
Popc arose ami made some remarks, at
which Judge Keller took offense and
replied to Mr. Pope in equally offensive
language that so oflcnded Pope that he
grabbed a gold-headed cane that was
lying on the desk in front and hurled
it at Keller, who instantly drew his pis
tol and commenced firing.
About this time C. R. Weatherby, a
relative and warm friend of Judge Kel
ler, appeared upon the scene and with
pistol in hand opened lire on Tope.
The excitement at this time can be bet
ter imagined than described. Major
James Turner fell early in the action,
but on examination his wound proved
to be only a flesh wound of the abdo
men. W. II. Pope received a ball in
the left shoulder and one through the
fleshy part of the lower right arm.
Three other bullets passed through his
clothes. His wounds, though painful,
are not considered fatal.
Alexander Pope was shot through
the bowels.
Keller and Weatherby were prompt
ly arrested and placed in jail.
Your correspondent was occupying a
seat in the gallery of the court house
while this bloody tragedy w;U? being
enacted. Many ladies were among the
audience. The bar was full of lawyers
and friends of the contending parties.
Many took shelter behind desks and
benches, while others lied. The women
fled, screaming with horror at the ter
rible sight.
Hon. W. II. Tope is State Senator,
while his brother, Alexander Pope,
represented Harrison County in the
Lower House.
State Representative Alexander Pope
died last night at nine o'clock from the
effects of his wound in the court house

NO ACTION TAKEN.
The War Department Takes no Official
Action Regarding the Death of Jeffer
son Davis
Washington, Dec. 7. The War
Department has not lxen officially in
formed of the death of Jefferson Davis
and has taken no action with respect
to it. A large oil painting of the de
ceased hangs on the wall of
the chief clerk's room, which im
mediately adjoins the office of
the Secretary. It is surrounded
by portraits of other ex-Seeretaries,
including Simon Cameron, General
SchoGeld and Messrs. Floyd and Con
rad. It bears the inscription, "Jeffer
son Davis, Secretary of War 185:;-57,
Pierce's Administration." There was
no crape about the portrait and the
flag over the building, which had al
ways been half-masted on the death of
an ex-Secretary, floated fn a good breeze
from its usual place at the top of the
staff.
Secretary Proctor, seen yesterday
morning and asked what course the
department would pursue in regard to
Mr. Davis' death, said: "Iseo no oc
casion for any action whatever. It
would serve no good purpose that I can
see. It is better to let the matter rest
in oblivion, sleep if it will, and to rel
egate it to the p:ist, than to do any
thing that would revive memories
best forgotten."

ritory of Oklahoma.
Washington, Dec. 7. Congressmen
Springer, Mansur, Perkins, Struble,
Peel, Baker and Allen have agreed
upon the draft of a bill for the new

introduced at the earliest day possible.
It is very comprehensive, embracing a
territorial form of government, a com
plete judicial system for Oklahoma and
also the Indian Territory, and also new
town site laws adapted to the situation
in Oklahoma. It extends tho land
laws to No-Man's-Land and provides
that the new Territory shall use the
laws of Kansas until the close of the
first session of the first Legislature.
It provides for commutation of home
stead entries after eighteen months'
residence upon paying 91.25 per acre,
and, in fact, provides for every phase
of the anomalous condition of the peo
ple of that Territory upon the lines and
conditions desired by them as made
known by the visiting Congressmen in
September last.
