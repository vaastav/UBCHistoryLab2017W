The Passing Show Here.
Just now we are witnessing exhibitions
In this town which sweeten things In thi;
vale of tears. and give to American poli
tics the real glory of the game. The fury
of the stump is allayed. Hifalutin guff
which stirs the cross-roads to the center
is put in cold storage. The storm and
strut are suspended, and political oppo
nents meet upon the level and work to
gether upon the square. It is a refreshing
and an Instructive sight. Long may It
continue!
A foreigner might be misled. If un
familiar with our temperamsnt and cus
toms he might appraise us in t*n uncom
plimentary way. Let us suppose him to
havo heard some of the wild-eyed denun
ciation Of the President by a democratic
spellbinder, and yet now viewing that
spellbinder walking into the President's
office and offering and receiving a hearty
greeting. That would puzzle him?be cer
tain to do so If he were a Frenchman.
His shoulders would rise, his eyes would
widen, and by other signs he would ap
pear to give it up.
Or let us suppose such a man noting
the appearance of several big Wail stree^
operators?Pierpont Morgan among the
number?at the President's office for a
protracted conference. That, too. would
puzzle him, and his Confusion would be
tho greater when he picked up the next
day's publications supposed to be con
trolled by WaJI street influences and saw
the President basted in their columns to
the queen's taste. How would he ever
make that out? How, he wou.d ask him
self. did Mr. Morgan managed to keep a
straight face at such a meeting? How d d
he get his consent to come when he knew
that i?iS types were "burn.ng up" the Pres
ident, day by day. and that the hottest
of all the roasts might fo4ow hard upon
his visit?
Puzzled, however, as the uninformed
foreigner might be, the Initiated nat.ve
looks on smilingly and understand;ngly.
It is an old story with him. He is able to
discount both the fury of the stump, and
the perferrid deliverances of the party, or
personal, newspaper organs. When the
curtain goes up he expects an excit.ng per
formance, with every man letter penect
in his part. When the curtain comes down
be expects the fustian to cease, and the
?ctors to get busy with real affairs. And
he is never disappointed. This is an in
tensely practical country, and the people
ask of their representatives practlca. re
sults. They go upon the propos.tion that
there Is a time for making faces and a
time for making up. Now is the time in
Washington for making up.
Ambassador Takahira.
No better appointment could have been
made by Japan to fill the vacancy caused
by the recall of Ambassabor Aoki to
Told? than former Minister Takahira,
whose selection was too ay announced by
cable. Having served here first as secre
tary of legation and then at? minister,
meanwhile acting as consul general at
New York, Kogoro Takahira is at this
time probably one of the best posted of
Japanese diplomats on the subject of
American affairs. He was eminently suc
cessful In all his dealings with the Ameri
can government, In the highest sense of
his mission, maintaining the most amica
ble relations at all times not only per
sonally. but officially. His return to this
capital from Roipe, where he was sent
after being relieved here a few years ago,
will be regarded with distinct satisfaction
oy the members of this government and
also by his numerous personal friends.
An ambassador from Tokio less familiar
with American affairs might have been
l.-d into misunderstandings and difficul
ties by reason of his inexperience with
our somewhat complex system. Ambas
feadorc Takahira will be capable of steer
ing a clear course. His selection may be
considered as a high compliment to him
individually on ...e part of his govern
ment. and at the same time it is a guar
antee that the best possible conditions
will prevail in the diplomatic relations
between the two countries. If proof were
needed of his ability to conduct himself
skillfully in a trying situation it is only
necessary to recollect his bearing during
the trying days of the Russo-Japanese
war, when he was confronted here with
-Count Cassinl and the friendship of the
Un.ted States was an important pawn in
the game.
The announcement that the late Walt
Whitman's brain 1s lost will have little
real significance. It had done its work
and was at best a grewsome souvenir.
With confidence restored and holiday
shopping under way the tribe of money
hoarders may be regarded as extinct.
The Heyburn Bill.
Senator Heyburn's rein traduction of his
bill to purchase all of the land lying be
tween Pennsylvania avenue and the Mall
starts In motion the legislative machinery
for the accomplishment of one of the
most Important objects now in view for
the development of the Capital city. Un
til this land Is taken by the government
the city's chief thoroughfare will remain
one-sided, disfigured and a reproach to
the nation. No private owner can be ex
pected to Improve his land^as long as tho
menace of condemnation hangs over it.
No large corporation will Invest In real
estate in this section as long as It is pos
sible that within a few years the United
States will come along and take the
ground for a bul'di-g site. It stands to
reason that the hard and fast rule of the
territory' will be to spend as little as pos
sible )n maintenance while the chance of
public purchase remains. The effect will
be to ho:d this conspicuous triangle in
its present state of backwardness, with
its unsightly shacks. Its cheap shops. Its
grogserles, its places of questionable
character. Its accumulations of scrap Iron
ami trash, its market houses and sidewalK
tails. Its hundred and on" nuisances suf
ficient to d sgrace a county town, let
ali lie the capital of the United Sta es
While this condition exists the govern
ment needs bui.dlngs. It is paying exorbi
tant rents for privately owned struc
tures and getting an inadequate return of
accommodations. It has long since out
grown Its own provisions for housing the
clerks and keeping the records, and it is
making shift in an extravagant manner
to the detriment of the public service,
while swelling the expense account- Its
delays In providing buildings are largely
due to the fact that whenever a new
structure is needed and seriously advo
cated trouble arises because of conflict
ing site claim? and rival real estate en
terprises. The result is a constant ac
cumulation of needs, to meet which will
call for' a large expenditure, larger as the
years pass.
True economy demands that this land be
taken at once before It has grown in
value through the occasional takli\g of
single squares for public purposes under
the peacemeal policy of building provi
sion. This territory will never cost less
than It will now, and will probably cost
more later than at present. Good busi
ness considerations demand thai invest
ments be made at low tide. There will
never be a lowor tide In the case of the
Mall-avenue land.
The government needs building room.
Here is the room. By taking it now the
United States will save money, both in
purchase price and in rents. By taking
It as a whole. In addition to saving money
the United States will fulfill tardily but
effectively Its duty to its capital, by dis
charging an obligation long since Incur
red, the neglect of which seriously delays
the proper deve opment of the Federal
city. Truly, the argument for the imme
diate passage of the Heyburn bill is un
answerable.
The Rivers and Harbors Congress.
In his admirable and encouraging
address to the national rivers and har
bors congress yesterday Secretary Root
said:
"Now it is time that something should
be done. Something positive anil com
pelling public attention. Making the
public understand that this movement
is no mere bartering of intcvsts be
tween politicians, but is a great matter
of public policy."
For years the river and harbor bill
was considered by the public as a "mere
bartering of interests between politi
cians." It gave merry rise to the
phrase, "the pork barrel." It was a
huge campaign fund, divided among
both representatives and senators seek
ing re-election. In close districts an
appropriation for picking snags out of
a small stream, or for building a wing
dam to wash away a sand bar, some
times turned the scale. Col. Snooks,
who had secured for Qoose creek rec
ognition in the same bill with (he Mis
sissippi river, gcrt another term in the
House, while CoL Noodle got six years
more In the Senate for his herculean
labors in bringing the importance of
the east fork of Little river to the at
tention of the government.
But along with the triumph of many
selfish little schemes went appropria
tions of the highest merit, accomplish
ing much good. Large streams carry
ing important commerce were im
proved. Useful harbors were deepened.
The interests of the people were ad
vanced. Attention was called to pub
lic works altogether deserving of the
government's most generous care.
-The present movemerrt, which Is both
non-sectional and non-partisan?national
in the truest sense?deserves success. It
is In accord with what may be charac
terised as a general awakening to great
national needs, hitherto but imperfectly
appraised, or else entirely neglected. Our
waterways are an asset of incalculable
value, and by the proper care may be
made to solve many difficulties In the
problem of transportation; and every
member of cither house of Congress can
well afford to give his voice and vote for
a comprehensive policy of permanent im
provement.
It is not a matter of a few years, or of
a few millions. A study of the map
shows both the extent and the importance
of the undertaking. The larger rivers are
long, the smaller crooked. All will call
for a liberal outlay if what is in view is
to be accomplished. For tills reason the
greatest Importance attaches, as Mr. Root
points ou-t, to what Is now on the cards.
A beginning means a carrying forward of
work, and money will be wasted if the
beginning is not wisely made. As the
Secretary puts it, a policy, not a project,
confronts us.
Williams and Culberson.
/
In voting to give Mr. Williams full
powers as leader the House democrats
rose to the occasion. It would have been
foolish to hobble him. If a leader Is to
lead he must have leeway and authority.
Mr. Williams is not an experiment. He
has shown his quality and earned the
confidence of his followers. His present
opportunity is greater than any he has
hitherto enjoyed, and probably we shall
all see him on his mettle for the coming
six months. And now i:" the Senate mi- |
nority will deal as justly and intelligently
by Mr. Culberson it w.ll deserve praise,
and add to the joy of the session's battle.
The Texas senator, in a way, Is an ex
periment, but so well known and at
tractive a.e his qualities that his party
lakes small if any risk in making it.
He is entitled to a free hand, and should
uave it from the start.
In a very short time the early Christ
mas shopper will be contemplating the
rush serenely from afar and receiving
congratulations on a great saving of time.
Doubts exist whether Senator Foraker's
ambition to be President is as strong as
his enjoyment of the simple prospect of j
providing notable opposition.
The progress of prohibition makes the
question of water for drinking as impor
tant as that of water for transportation
purposes.
Having looked Washington over, Mr.
Bryan is convinced that a man might live
four years or so in the town very com
fortably.
Ambassador Aoki will arrive In Japan
just In time to give convincing eonfirma
t^>n of Secretary Taft's peace assurances
Some of Mr. Roosevelt's adverse critics
are disposed to lie as extreme as some of
his adverse eulogists.
Mr. Knox's boom has not nearly as
much ginger in it as Senator Foraker's.
From Comic Opera to Hamlet.
There is no accounting for the artistic
temperament. It breaks out In strange
spots and In peculiar ways. The latest
demonstration of its eccentricity is con
veyed in the announcement that a well
known comic opera performer, chiefly
noted for his grotesque characterizations
Is about to Wve the role of the bufToon
!n order to play Hamlet. He is entirely
sincere In his belfef that he Is by na
ture fitted to enact the part of the melan
choly Dane. He has studied Shake
speare thoroughly and feels that he is
called to give a new rendering of the
greatest of English trad^gles. The
theater-going world awaits anxiously the
p oof of his confidence.
Some years ago th* performance of
Hamlet by James Owen O'Connor was re
garded as the acme of thesplan interest.
There was positively no doubting the
man's earnestness or Ills supreme faith In
himself. Though at times compelled, by
reason of the enthusiasm of his audi
ences, to play behind a net, in order to
savo the scenery and hi* costumes frvini
disfigurement, he alwavs went through
his lines with exaltation. But O'Conno
had no comic-opera past to hamper him.
No one was inclined to revive recollec
tions of him as a clown. It was not ab
solutely necessary to remember this. In
this latest case, however, the aspirant
for Shakespearian honors will be com
pelled to struggle against a reputation
for low comedy qual-flcatlona. It will be
hard for even his well wishers to refrain
from scrutiny of his work to detect the
touch of the burlesque.
This comedian proposes to change his
name by readopting his true cognomen
when he steps forth on the boards as
Hamlet. But will a black suit and a
new surname conceal his fun-making pro
clivities? It is possible that this serious
ly Intended Hamlet will be the crown
ing achievement of the comedian's ca
eer. Yet it is only fair to give him a
chance. Maybe he Is the great American
tragedian, the legitimate successor of
Booth for -whom the country has waited
somewhat impatiently through several
stage generations of aspirants for the
place. Other actors have pulled them
selves up by the bootstraps from low
comedy to high tragedy. Why not this
earnest student of Shakespeare? 1
Uncle Joe Cannon seems very proud of
the House of Representatives, and the
House of Representatives se..ms very
proud of Uncle Joe. This is at least one
point of general agreement.
There was enough new material in the
President's message to provide an abun
dance of quotation for subsequent mes
sages.
There can be no further doubt of pros
perity when it is known that radium has
gone down to $1,000,000 an ounce.
No one will deny that the Jamestown
exposition did as well as cou d be ex
pected under the circumstances.
SHOOTING STABS.
BT PHILANDER JOHNSON.
Nothing Wasted.
"Everything in this world Is useful in
some way," said the serenely philosophical
person.
"Yee," answered Miss Cayenne, "If you
don't know what else to do with some
thing you can give it to somebody for
Christmas."
Will Stay at Home.
"Do you expect to go to Europe next
spring?"
"No,'" answered Mr. Dustin Stax, "I
am pretty well convinced that those In
vestigations are about over."
The Besult.
If everybody told the truth
And ne'er indulged in yarns grotesque.
This world would be improved, forsooth;
But nothing, like as picturesque.
Books!
"Do you believe that everybody has one
novel in him?''
"I don't know. But judging from the
numiier of books constantly turned out, 1
should say that everybody believed he
had."
A Serious Problem.
"T suppose you are going to buy your
wife a very handsome Christmas gift?"
"1 don't know what to do about it," an
swered Mr. Meekton. "If I deplete the
family funds to buy Henrietta something
worthy of her I deprive her of the pleas
ure of spending the money."
Ambitions.
I long to be a financier;
One of the kiting kind,
With very little in the bank,
But millions in my mind.
Or else a politician gay
For whom the people shout,
With very little work to do,
But heaps to talk about.
Or. an Inventor I would be
And go mjr. whole life through
Enjoying fame because of all
The things I hoped to do.
Or, I would be a novelist,
And comfortably shirk
And let the man who writes the ads
Do all the real work!
Expenses of National Parties.
From the Philadelphia Ledger.
President Roosevelt's only novelty* in
this year's message is not alarming. The
country's peace of mind is duly consid
ered. The President reduces the idea to
a harmlessly academic position, with the
comment that it will be a long time be
fore the people can be brought to a se
rious consideration of a proposition so
contrary to accustomed habits of Ameri
can thought.
This Is Going Some!
From the Live Oak (Fla.) Democrat.
That degenerate monstrosity, that re
proach to our civilization, that shrunken,
shapeless, tasteless, porcine nightmare,
that hideous dream of hide and hair and
horror, that allegory of starvation, that
specter of want and woe known as the
Florida razorback hog?to sing his praises
is to encourage dcgeneracy; to declare
him toothsome Is to Insult the memory of
Epicurus.
Open.
From the Springfield Republican.
Senator Tillman's meager audience at
Utica last week did not indicate excep
tional drawing power in this part of the
country, but his lecture season in Wash
ington will open today, and. If he uses his
pitchfork, the prospects are that he will
have full galleries throughout the winter
and spring.
Keep At It. . %
From the Chicago Record-Herald. ,
Keep on doing your Christmas shopping
early.
Mr. Culberson's Opportunity.
From the New York Tribune.
In offering the minority leadership to
Charles A. Culberson the democrats in
the Senate have shown commendable
judgment.
Up-to-Date Defense.
From the Louisville Courier-Journal.
The p ea of self-defense is a back num
ber. The 13,000-word hypothetical ques-1
tlon and a tirst-class alienist will suffice.
' "" ?
Not Illuminating!
From the Atlanta Conatitution.
Still, with so many candidates in the
country, the cry for cheaper gas is i
strange.
Motto for Coin.
From the Butte News.
If a motto, devoid of sacrilegious sug
gestion. yet fitting the situation and tne
spirit of the tim-is, is need for our coins,
why not: We need the money?
Wooing Fame.
From the Indianapolta Sun.
Exa<-tly 485 press bureaus started in
the National capital yesterday. 301) in
the House and 92 in the Senate.
This Is Not Winter.
From the Philadelphia Inquirer.
'Genuine winter does not begin until
December 22. Do not accept any prema
ture substitutes that mav be offered.
Undesirable Citizens.
From the New York Herald.
Anarchists are not as dangerous as
the men who make it their business
to circulate sinister rumors affecting
the credit and standing of mercantile
houses and financial institutions.
Doctors Disagree.
IFrom the Pittsburg Gazette Times.
Financial doctors disagree just like the
ordinary kind.
