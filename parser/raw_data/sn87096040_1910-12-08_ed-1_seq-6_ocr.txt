Washington. Dec. 6—President
Taft's annual message to congress
contained 40,000 words, and is said to
be the longest document of its kind
ever written In it he reviews the
work of each of the administrative
departments beginning with the state
department. He devotes considerable
space to the satl-factory settlement
of the fisheries dispute with England
through the medium of the Hague
Tribunal, and recounts both the his
tory of the fisheries dispute and the
establishment of the tribunal.
la connection with the state depart
ment he tells of the important poli
tical happenings of the past twelve
months throughout the entire world,
and the action of this country In con
nection with them.
Tariff Negotiations.
Referring to the negotiation of new
tariff agreements President Taft
says:
"The new tariff law. In Section 2,
respecting the maximum and mini
mum tariffs of the United States,
which provisions came into effect on
April 1. 1910, imposed upon us re
sponsibility of determining prior to
that date whether any undue discrim
ination existed against the United
Slates ana its products in any coun
try of the world with which we sus
tained commercial relations.
"In the case of several countries in
stances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce were
found to exist These discriminations
were removed by negotiation. Prior
to April l, 1910. when the maximum
tariff was to come into operation with
respect to importations from all those
countries In whose favor no proclama
tion applying the minimum tariff
should be issued by the president, one
hundred and thirty.four such procla
mations were issued.
"This series of proclamations em
braced the entire commercial world
and hence the minimum tariff of the
United States has been given univer
sal application, thus testifying to the
satisfactory character of our trade
relations with foreign countries.
"Marked advantages to the com
merce of the United States were ob
tained through these tariff settle
ments.
"The policy of broader and closer
trade relations with the Dominion of
Canada which was initiated in the ad
justment of the maximum and mini
mum provisions of the tariff act of
August, 1509, has proved mutually
beneficial. It justifies further efforts
for the readjustment of the commer
cial relations of the two countries so
that their commerce may follow the
channels natural to contiguous coun
tries and be commensurate with the
steady expansion of trade and indus
try on both sides of the boundary
line."
Ship Subsidy.
The president urges such action as
he believes will increase American
trade abroad, and says:
"Another instrumentality indispen
sable to the unhainapered and natural
development of American commerce is
merchant marine. All maritime and
commercial nations recognize the im
portance of this factor. The greatest
commercial nations, our competitors,
Jealously foster their merchant ma
rine. Perhaps nowhere is the need
for rapid and direct mail, passenger
and freight communication quite so
urgent as between the United States
and Latin America. We can secure
In no other quarter of the world sucli
Immediate benefits In friendship and
commerce as would flow from the es
tablishment of direct lines of com
munication with the countries of
Latin America adequate to meet the
requirements of a rapidly increasing
appreciation of the reciprocal depen
dence of the countries of the western
hemisphere upon each other's prod
ucts, sympathies and assistance.

subject in my last annual message it

tercourse."
Governmental Expense.
To r.o one sub.k-ct does he devote
more «pace than to the expense of
conducting the various government
departments and the urgent need for
economy, and in this connection he
says:
Kvery effort has beer, made bv
each department chief to reduce the
estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June
30. IS 1 say this in order that con
gress t:.»y understand that these esti
mates thus made present the smallest
sum which will maintain the depart
ments. bureaus and offices of tie gov
ernment and meet its other obliga
tions under existing law. and that a
cut of these estimates would result
in embarrassing the executive branch
of the government in the performance
of its duties. This remark does not
apply to the river and harbor es*i
matt-s. except to those for expenses of
maintenance and the meeting of obli
gations under authorized contracts,
nor docs it apply to the public build
in? bill nor to the navy building pro
gram, Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any par* or all
of the estimates for them without in
terfering with the discharge of the or
dinary obligations of these functions
of its departments, bureaus and of
fices.
"The final estimates for the year
ending June 30. 1912. as they have
been sent to the treasury on Novem
ber 29 of this year, for the ordinary
expenses of the government, including
those for public buildings, rivers and
harbors, and the navy building pro
gram. amount to $630,494,013.12. This
is $32.964.SS7 36 less than the ap
propriations for the fiscal year end
ing June 30. 1911. It is $16.SS3.153 44
less than the total estimates, includ
ing supplemental estimates submitted
to congress by the treasury for the
year 1911. and is $5.574.659.39 less
than the original estimates submitted
by the 'reasury for 1911.
"These flugres do not include the
appropriations for the Panama canal,
the policy in respect to which ought
to be. and is, to spend as much each
year as can be economically and ef
fectively expended in order to com
plete the canal as promptly as possi
ble. and therefore, the ordinary mo
tive for cutting down the expense of
the government does not apply to ap
propriations for this purpose.
"Against the estimates of expend!
tures. $*140,494,013.12. we have estimat
ed receipts for next year I6S0.000.009,
making a probable surplus of ordinary
receipts over ordinary expenditures of
about $50.0o0,000. or taking into ac
count the estimates for the Panama
canal, which are $50.920,847 69. and
which will ultimately be paid in bonds,
it will leave a deficit for the next
year of about $7,000,000, If congress
shall conclude to fortify the canal."
of
The Tariff.
The President devotes but little
space to the subject of the tariff law.
and of it he says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty
In the Payne tarifT act have been sub
jected to a great deal of criticism,
some it jus-, more of it unfounded,
and to much misrepresentation. The
act was adopted in pursuance of a
declaration by the party which Is re
sponsible for it that customs bill
should be a tariff for the protection
of home Industries, the measure of
the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of producing the im
ported article abroad and the cost of
producing it at home, together with
such addition to that, difference as
might give a reasonable profit to the
home producer. The basis for the
criticism of this tariff is that In re
spect to a number of the schedules
the declared measure was not follow
ed, but a higher difference retained or
inserted by way of undue discrimina
tion in favor of certain Industries and
manufactures. Little, if any, of the
criticism of the tariff has been direct
ed against the protective principle
above stated but the main body of
the criticism has been based on the
attempt, to conform to the measure of
protection was not honestly and sin
cerely adhered to."
The Tariff Board.
he president refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to investi
gate the cost of production of various
articles included in the schedules of
the tariff, and says:
"The tariff board thus appointed
and authorized haB been diligent in
preparing itself for the necessary in
vestigations. The hope of those who
have advocated the use of this board
for tariff purposes is that the question
of the rate of a duty Imposed shall
become more of a business question
and less of a political question, to be
ascertained by experts of long train
ing and accurate knowledge. The
halt in business and the shock to busi
ness, due to the announcement that a
new tariff bill is to be prepared and
put in operation v/ill be avoided by
treating the schedules one by one as
occasion shall arise for a change in
the rates of each, and only after a re
port upon the schedule by the tariff
board competent to make such report.
It is not likely that the board will be
able to make a report during the pres
ent session of congress on any of the
schedules, because a proper examina
tion Involves an enormous amount of
detail and a great deal of care but 1
hope to be able at the opening of the
new congress, or at least during the
session of that congress, to bring to
its attention the facts in regard to
those schedules In the present tarifT
that may prove to need amendment

request, the secretary of war visited

"It is said," remarked the moralizer,
"that a fool is born every minute."
"And I'm glad of it," rejoined the de

laws, which has opened the markets
of America to the products of the
Philippines, and has opened the Phil
ippine markets to American manu
factures.
he year has been one of prosper
ity and progress Porto Rico.
Panama Canal.
At the instance of Colonel Goeth
als. the army engineer oSicer in
charge of the work on the Panama
canal. I have just made a visit to
the Isthmus to inspect the work done
and to consult with him on the
ground as to certain problems which
are likely to arise in the near fu
ture. The progress of the work is
most satisfactory. If no unexpected
obstacle presents itself, the canal
will be completed well within the
time fixed by Colonel Goethals, to
wit, January l, 1S15. and within the
estimate of cost. $375,OuO.OOO.
Among questions arising for pres
ent solution is the decision whether
the canal shall be fortified. I have
already stated to the congress that
I strcngiy favor fortification and I
now reiterate this opinion and ask
your consideration of the subject in
the light of the report already be
fore you made by a competent board.
"Another question which arises for
consideration and possible legislation
is the question of tolls in the canal.
This question is necessarily affected
by the probable tonnage which will
go through the canal.
"In determining what the tolls
should be we certainly ought not to
insist that for a good many years to
come they should amount to enough
to pay the interest on the invest
ment of $400,000,000 which the United
States has made in the construction
of the canal. We ought not to do
this, first, because the benefits to be
derived by the United States from
this expenditure is not to be meas
ured solely by a return upon the in
vestment. It" it were then the con
struction might well have been left
to private enterprise.
"My own impression is that the
tolls ought not to exceed $1 per net
ton, and I should recommend that
within certain limits the president be
authorized to fix the tolls of the canal
and adjust them to what seems to
be commercial necessity.
"1 cannot close this reference to
the canal without suggesting as a
wise amendment to the interstate
commerce law a provision prohibiting
interstate commerce railroads from
owning or controlling ships engaged
in the trade through the Panama
canal. I believe such a provision
may be needed to save to the people
of the United States the benefits of
the competition in trade between the
eastern and western seaboards which
this canal was constructed to secure."
Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the de
partment of Justice, the president
says
"I invite especial attention to the
prosecutions under the federal law*
of the so-called 'bucket shops,' and
of those schemes to defraud in which
the use of the mail is an essential
part of the fraudulent conspiracy,
prosecutions which have saved ig
norant and weak members of the pub
lic and are saving them hundreds of
millions of dollars. The violations of
the anti-trust law present perhaps the
most Important litigation before the
department,.and the number of cases
filed shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"In a special message last year I
brought to the attention of congress
the propriety and wisdom of enacting
a general law providing for the in
corporation of industrial and other
companies engaged in interstate com
merce, and 1 renew my recommen
dation in that behalf."
The crying need in the United
States of cheapening the cost of liti
gation by simplifying Judicial proced
ure and expediting final judgment is
pointed out and action looking to cor
rection of these evils is urged.
The president recommends an in
crease in the salaries of federal
judges.
Postal Savings Banks.
"At its last session congress made
revision for the establishment of
Ravings banks by the postofflce de
partment of this government by which
under general control of trustees, con
sisting of the postmaster general, the
secretary of the treasury and the at
torney general, the system could be
begun in a few cities and towns, and
enlarged to cover within its opera
tions as many cities and towns and as
large a part of the country as seemed
wise. The initiation and establish
ment of such a system has required a
great deal of study on the part of
the experts In the postofflce and treas
ury departments, but a system has
now been devised which is believed to
be more economical and simpler in Its
operation than any similar system
abroad. Arrangements have been per
fected so that savings banks will be
opened In some cities and towns on
the 1st of January, and there will be a
gradual extension of the benefits of
the plan to the reRt of the country."
"It is gratifying." says the president,
"that the reduction in the postal
deficit has been accomplished without
any curtailment of postal facilities.
On the contrary, the service has been
greatly extended during the year in
all its branches."
Second-Class Mall.
"In my last annual message I in
vited the attention of congress to the
Inadequacy of the postal rate imposed
upon second-class mall matter in so
far as that includes magazines, and
showed by figures prepared by experts
of the postoflice departing lit that the
em-eminent was roiidennj a service

to lie magazines, costing many
lions in excess of the compensation
paid. An answer was attempted to
this by the representatives of the
magazines, and a reply was filed to
this answer by the postoflice depart
ment. The utter inadequacy of the
answer, considered in the light of the
reply of the postofflce department, I
think must must appeal to any fair
minded person. Whether the answer
was all that could be said in behalf of
the, magazines is another question. I
agree that the question is one of fact
but I insist that if the fact is as the
experts of the postofflce department
show, that we are furnishing to the
owners of magazines a service worth
millions more than they pay for it.
then justice requires that the rate
should be increased. The increase in
the receipts of the department result
ing from this change may be devoted
to increasing the usefulness of the de
partment in establishing a parcels
post and in reducing the cost of first
class postage to one cent. It has been
said by the postmaster general that a
fair adjustment might be made under
which the advertising part of the
magazine should be charged for at a
different and higher rate from that of
the reading matter. This would re
lieve many useful magazines that are
not circulated at a profit, and would
not shut them out from the use of the
mails by a prohibitory rate.
"With respect to the parcels post. I
respectfully recommend Its adoption
on all rural delivery routes, and that
11 pounds—the international limit—be
made the limit of carriage in such
post."
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to cer
tain reforms urged by the secretary of
the navy which he recommends for
adoption, and continues:
"The estimates of the navy depart
ment are $5,000,000 less than the ap
propriations for the same purpose last
year, and included in this is the build
ing program of the same amount as
that submitted for your consideration
last year. It is merely carrying out
the plan of building two battleships a
year, with a few needed auxiliary ves
sels. I earnestly hope that this pro
gram will be adopted.
"The secretary of the navy has
given personal examination to every
navy yard, and has studied the uses
of the navy yards with reference to
the necessities of our fleet. With a
fleet considerably ltss than half the
size of that of the British navy, we
have shipyards more than double the
number, and there are several of these
shipyards expensively equipped with
modern machinery, which, after inves
tigation the secretary of the navy be
lieves to be entirely useless for naval
purposes. He asks authority to aban
don certain of them and to move their
machinery to other places, where it
can be made of use."
"The complete success of our coun
try in arctic exploration should not re
main unnoticed. The unparalleled
achievement of Peary in reaching the
north pole, April 6, 1909, approved by
critical examination of the most ex
pert scientists, has added to the dis
tinction of our navy, to which he be
longs, and reflects credit upon his
country. I recommend fitting recogni
tion by congress of the great achieve
ment of Robert Edwin Peary."
Conservation.
she'll
they
aro on straight
"The subject of the conservation of
the public domain has commanded the
attention of the people within the last
two or three years.
"There is no need for radical re
form in the methods of disposing of
what are really agricultural lands. The
present laws have worked well. The
enlarged homestead law has encour
aged the successful farming of lands
in the semi-arid regions.
"N*othing can be more important in
the matter of conservation than the
treatment of our forest lands. It was
probably the ruthless destruction of
forests in the older states that first
called attention to the necessity for a
halt in the waste of our resources.
"In the present forest reserves there
are lands which are not properly for
est, and which ought to be Bubject to
homestead entry. This has caused
some local irritation. We are care
fully eliminating such lands from for
est reserves or where their elimina
tion is not practical listing them for
entry under the forest homestead act.
"Congress ought to trust the execu
tive to use the power of reservation
only with respect to land most valu
able for forest purposes. During the
present administration, 62,250,000
acres of land largely non-timbered,
have been excluded from forest re
serves, and 3,500,000 acres of land
principally valued for forest purposes
have been included in forest reserves,
making a reduction in forest reserves
of non-timbered land amounting to
2,750,000 acres."
Coal Lands.
"The next subject, and one most im
portant for your consideration. Is the
disposition of the coal lands in the
United States and Alaska. At the be
ginning of this administration there
were withdrawn from entry for pur
poses of classification 17,867,000 acres.
Since that time there have been with
drawn by my order from entry for
classification 78,977,745 acres, making
a total withdrawal of 96,844,745 acres.
Meantime of the acres thus with
drawn 1,061,889 have been classified
and found not to contain coal and
have been restored to agricultural en
try, and 4,726,091 acres have been
classified as coal lands while 7.993,239
acres remain withdrawn from entry
and await classification. In addition
337,000 acres have been classified ns
coal lands without prior withdrawal,
thus increasing the classified coal
lands to 10,429,372 acres.

disposal of coal lands in the United
States, the minimum price at which

price and to sell at that price.
"As one-third of all the coal supply
is held by the government, it seems
wise that it should retain such con
trol over the mining and the sale as
the relation of lessor to lessee fur
nishts.
"The secretary of the interior thinks
there are difficulties in the way of
leasing public coal lands, which ob
jections he has set forth in his re
port, the force of which I freely con
cede. I entirely approve his stating
at length in his report of the objec
tions in order that the whole subject
may be presented to congress, but
after a full consideration, for the rea
sons I have given above, I favo* a
leasing system and recommend it."
Water Power Sites.
"Prior to March 4, 1909, there had
been, on the recommendation of the
reclamation service, withdrawn from
agricultural entry, because they were
regarded as useful for power sites
which ought not to be disposed of as
agricultural lands, tracts amounting
to about 4,000,000 acres. The with
drawals were hastily made and In
eluded a great deal of land that was
not useful for power sites. They were
intended to include the power sites
on 29 rivers in 9 states. Since that
time 3,475,442 acres have been re
stored for settlement of the original
4,000.000 because they do not con
tain power sites and meantime, new
withdrawals have been made which,
with other restorations based upon
field examination, result in withdraw
als at present effective of 1,218,356
acres on vacant public land and 202,
197 acres on entered public land, or a
total of 1,420,553 acres. These with
drawals made from time to time cover
all the power sites included In the
first withdrawals and many more, on
151 rivers and in 12 states. The dis
position of these power sites involves
one of the most difficult questions pre
sented in carrying out practical con
servation.
"The subject is one that calls for
new legislation. It has been thought
that there was danger of combination
to obtain possession of all the power
sites and to unite them under one
control. Whatever the evidence of
this, or lack of it, at present we have

"However this may be, it is the
plain duty of the government to see
to it that in the utilization and devel
opment of all this immense amount
of water power, conditions shall be
imposed that will prevent extortion

companiment of monopoly.
"The question of conservation is
not a partisan one, and I sincerely

that action may be taken upon them."
Alaska.
"With reference to the government
of Alaska, 1 have nothing to add to
the recommendations I made in my
last message on the subject. I am
convinced that the migratory charac
ter of the population, its unequal dis
tribution, and its smallness of num
ber, which the new census shows to
be about 50,000, in relation to the
enormous expanse of the territory,
make it altogether Impracticable to
give to those people who are in
Alaska today and may not be there a
year hence, the power to elect a leg
islature to govern nn immense ter
ritory to which they have relation so
little permanent."
Pensions.
"The uniform policy of the govern
ment in the matter of granting pen
sions to those gallant and devoted
men who fought to save the life of
the nation In the perilous days of the
great civil war, has always been of
the most liberal character. Those
men are now rapidly passing away.
The best obtainable official statistics
show that they are dying at the rate
of something over three thousand a
month, and, in view of their advanc
ing years, this rate must inevitably in
proportion, rapidly increase. To the
man who risked everything on the
field of battle to save the nation in
the hour of its direst need we owe a
debt which has not been and should
not be computed in a begrudging or
parsimonious spirit."
Bureau of Corporations.
Referring to the report of the com
missioner of corporations, the presi
dent says:
The commissioner finds a condi
tion in the ownership of the standing
timber of the United States other
than the government timber that calls
for serious attention. The direct in
vestigation made by the commissioner
covered an area which contains SO
per cent, of the privately-owned tim
ber of the country.
"His report shows that one half of
the timber in this area is owned bv
200 Individuals and corporations
that 14 per cent, is owned by these
corporations, and that there is very
extensive inter-ownership of stock,
as well as other circumstances, all
pointing to friendly relations among
tliOBO who own a majority of this tim
ber, relationship which might lead
to a combination for the maintenance
of a price that would be very detri
mental to the public interest, and
would create the necessity of remov
ing all tariff obstacles to the free im
portations of lumber from other coun
tries,".
Bureau of Labor.

Civil Service Commission.
"The civil service commission h?_.
continued its useful duties duri:^ t'..
year. The necessity for the ma!r,r~
nance of the provisions of the civi
service law was never greater than I
day. Officers responsible for
the pu.
icy of the administration, a.i the
immediate personal assistants or depu
ties, should not be included
within tl-
classified service, but in rcy
ju V-:
ment, public opinion has advanced
to
the point where it would support a bill
providing a secure tenure during sj.
ciency for all purely administrative
officials. I entertain the profound con
viction that It would greativ aJd th»
cause of efficient and economical

gress could enact a bill providing
that

Economy and Efficiency.
"The increase in the activities ar.
in the annual expenditures of the
eral government has been so raplj
and so great that the time has co.?:»
to check the expansion of government
activities in new directions until
have tested the economy and efficiency
with which the government of to-Jay
being carried on. The responsibility
rests upon the head of the administra
tion. He is held accountable by the
public, and properly so. Despite the
unselfish and patriotic efforts of the
heads of departments and other-,
charged with responsibility of govern
ment, there has grown up In this coun
try a conviction that the expenses of
government are too great. The fun
damental reason for the existence un
detected of waste, duplication, and bad
management is the lack of prompt, ac
curate information.
"I have requested the head of each
department to appoint committees on
economy and efficiency in order to pe.
cure full co-operation in the movement
by the employees of the governine:.:
themselves.
"I urge the continuance of the ap
propriation of $100,000 requested fur
the fiscal year 1912.
"My experience leads me to believe
that while government methods are
much criticized, the bad results—if we
do have bad results—are not due to a
lack of zeal or willingness on the part
of the civil servants."
Interstate Commerce.
"There has not been time to test th*
benefit and utility of the amendments
to the interstate commerce law con
tained in the act approved June IS,
1910. The law as enacted did not con
tain all the features which I recom
mended. It did not specifically de
nounce as unlawful the purchase by
one of two parallel and competing
roads of the stock of the other. NVr
did it subject to the restraining influ
ence of the Interstate Commerce com
mission the power of corporations en
gaged in operating interstate railroad*
to issue new sitock and bonds nor did
it authorize the making of temporary
agreements between railroads limited
to 30 days, fixing the same rates for
traffic between the same places.
"I do not press the consideration of
any of these objects upon congress at
this session.
"The interstate commerce comrai»
sion has recommended appropriations
for the purpose of enabling it to enter
upon a valuation of all railroads. This
has always been within the Jurisdic
tion of the commission, but the requi
site funds have been wanting. Statis
tics to the value of each railroad wouKi
be valuable for many purposes, espe
cially if we ultimately enact any lim
itations upon the power of the inter
state railroads to issue stocks ani
bonds, as I hope we may.
"For the protection of our own
people and the preservation of our
credit in foreign trade. I urge upon
congress the Immediate enactment of
a law under which one who, in good
faith, advances money or credit upon
a bill of lading issued by a common
carrier upon an interstate or foreign
shipment can hold the carrier liable
for the value of the eoods described
in the bill at the valuation specified
in the bill, at least to the extent of the
advances made in reliance upon It.
"I further recommend that a punish
ment of fine and imprisonment be im
posed upon railroad agents and ship
pers for fraud or misrepresentation in
connection with the issue of bills of
lading issued upon interstate and for
eign shipments.
Except as above. I do not recom
mend any amendment to the interstate
commerce law as it stands. I do not
now recommend any amendment tc
the anti-trust law. In other words, it
seems to me that the existing leglsla
tion with reference to the regulatior
of corporations and the restraint ol
their business has reached a point
where we can stop for a while and wit
ness the effect of the vigorous execu
lion of the law-s of the statute books
in restraining the abuses which cer
tainly did exist and which roused tin
public to demand reform."
