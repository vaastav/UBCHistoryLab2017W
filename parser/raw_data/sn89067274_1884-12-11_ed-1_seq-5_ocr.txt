Relations and of Our Mora
Pressing Heeds.
"The President Expresses His Sense
of Obligation to All Parties
For Their Support.
Washinoton, D. C, December 1.
'To the Congrtu the Ciiitetl States:
Since the close of your hist session the
AimTicnn iieonle in tlio exercise of their
highest right of suffrage have chosen tlieir
Chief Magistrate lor the lotir.yeurs ensuing.
Mhen it is remembered tlmt ut uo period In the
-country's history has the lonir political con
test w hichcustouiuriiypreeedestlieday of the
National election been waged with greater
fervor and intensity, it is a subject of con
gratulation that alter Ihe controversy at the
polls was over, ami while the slight prepon
derance hy which the issue had been deter
inineil was as vet unuscrrtaineil, the public
peace suth-rcilno distuhrance, but tho pco
j)le everywhere patiently ami quietly await
ed the result. Nothing could more striking
ly illustrate tlie temper of the American citi
zen, his hive of order, and his loyalty to law.
Nothing could more signally demonstrate
tlie strength and wisdom oi our iioliticai in
stitutions. THE Kl.KCTOUAL VOTE.
Eight; rears have passed since a con
troversy "com crmng the result oi a National
election, sharply cali-d tile attention of Con
gress to the necessity of providing more
definite regulations tor the counting of the
electoral vote.
It is of the gravest importance that this
question lie solved before contiicting claims
to the Presidency ahull again distress the
country 4 ami 1 am peisua ied that by t iie
people'id large any oi t ;ie incas'ires of lclicf
thus tar proposed would Lie prclened to con--tiuued
inaction.
iokkmn iiixations.
Our relations with all foreign powers con
tinue to be sunn-able. With 11 Igluiu a run
veiition iuw. bee-i signed whereby tlie scope
of tlie present treaties has icen so enlarged
is to secure to the citizens of either country
within the jurisdiction of the other equal
rights and privileges. In the acquisition and
alienation of property a trade mark treaty
has alsi been concluded. Tlie war between
Chili and Peru is at an end. lor t lie arbitra
tion ot tin- claims of American citizens, -ho,
during its continuance, suffered tlirouth the
acts of tin-Chilian authorities, a convention
will soon be negotiated.
CHINA.
The state of hostilities between France and
hina continues to be an embarrassing
feature of our Kastem relations. TheChincse
Government has promptly ait justed and paid
the claims of American citizens, whose prop-
erty was destroyed in the recent riots at
Canton. 1 renew the recommendation of my
last annual message, that the Canton in
demnity fund bu returned. to China. The
true interpretation of the recent treaty w ith
that country, permitting the restriction of
Chinese immigration, is likely to lie again
the subject of your deliberations. It may lie
seriously questioned whetuer tiie statute
passed -.it the last session does not violate
the treaty rights of certain Chinese w ho left
thiscouutrv with return certificates valid
tinder the old law and now" seem to be de
barred from landing from lack of certificates
required by the new. The recent purchase
by the I'inicd Stales of a large trading fleet
heretofore under the Chinese flair has con
siderably enhanced our commercial im
portance in tlie Kast. In view of
the large number of vessels built
Kir purchased by American citizens In
other countries and exclusively employed in
legitimate tratlie between foreign ports un
der the recognized protection of our tiair.it
might be well to provide a uniform rate for
their registration anil documentation, so that
the bona tide property rights of our citizens
therein shall be duly evidenced and properly
.jruurded.
THE ClVSdO COUNTRY.
lu:-suant to the advice of the Senate at the
last session, 1 recognized tlie flag of tlie In
ternational Association of the Con.iro as that
of a lncniily tioveniincnt, avoiding in so do
ing any prejudgment of conflict. In tile ter
ritorial claims in that region subsequently,
in execution of tiie expressed wish of Con
gress, 1 appointed a commercial agent for
the Congo uasin. The importance of tne rich
prospective trade of the Congo Valley has led
to a general conviction that it should be
open'to all nations upon equal terms. An
International Conlerence for the considera
tion of this subject was called by the F.mper
or of Germany, and is now in session at Ber
lin, lielegate's are ilk attendance on behalf
of the United Mutes, of the results of the
-conference, you will be duly adv ised.
LEGATION IMiKMISES IS THE EAST.
The Government of Corea lias generously
nlded the etforts of the United states Minis
ter to secure suitable premises for ttie use of
the legation. As. the conditions of the diplo
matic" intercourse witli the Kast--4tu
nations demand that the legation
premises be owned by the repre
sented power, T advise that an appropriation
be made for tiie acquisition of this property
by the Government. The Cnited states al
ready possesses valuable premises at Tan
gier as a gilt from tlie sultan of Morocco. As
is stated hereafter, they have lately received
a similar irii't from theViumese Government.
rThe Government of .Japan stands ready to
.seil to us extensive grounds at Tokio where
in to erect a suitable, building for the lega
tion, Court-house, and Jail; and similar priv
ileges can probahly lie secured in China and
l'ersia. Tne owning of such premises would
nor only atfect a large saving of present
rentals, out yvould permit of the due asser
tion of extra territorial rights in these coun
tries, ami would the better serve to maintain
the dignity of the United States.
EGYPT.
The failure of Congress to make an appro
priation for our representative at the Auton
omous Court of the Khedive has proved a
serious embarrassment in our intercourse
with fcgypt; and in view of the necessary in
timacy of the diplomatic relationship due to
the participation of this Government as one
of the treaty powers in all matters of admin
istration there affecting the rights of for
eigners, I advise the restoration of tne airencv
and Consul-General at Cairo on its former
basis. 1 do not conceive it to be the wish of
-Congress that the Cnited States should with
draw altogether from tlie honorable position
they have hitherto held witli respect to tlie
Khedive, or that citizens of this Ifepuhlic re
siding or sojourning in Kgypt should hereaf
ter he without tlie aid and protection of a
-competent representative.
THE UAKTIIOLW STATUE.
With France tlie traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. The Jtartholdi statue of
liberty enlightening the world, the generous
gift of the people of France, is expected to
reach New York in May next. I suggest that
Congressional action betaken in relation to
the spirit which has prompted this gitt, and
in aid of the timely completion of the pedes
tal upon which it is to be placed.
GERMANY.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of tiie
best elements of citizenship, continues to
lie cordial. The I'nited states have ex
tradition treaties with several of the Ger
man states, but by reason o; the con
federation of these states under the Im
perial rule, the application of such trea
ties is not as uniform and comprehen
sive ns the interests of the two countries
require. 1 propose, therefore, to open ne
gotiations lor a single convention of ex
tradition to embrace all the territory of the
Impire.
enc.i.axh.
It affords me pleasure to fay that our in
tercourse with Great p.ritain continues to
be of a most lriendly character.
HAWAII.
The Government of Hawaii has Indicated
its willingness to continue for seven years
tlie provisions of the existing reciprocity
treaty. su li continuance, in " view of the
relations of that country to the American
system of Mates, should, in my judgment, be
favored.
n tTTt.
The revolution In Jiayti against the estab
lished Government has terminated. While
it. was in progress It became necessary to
-enforce our neutiality laws by instituting
proeeeiiimrs ngni'ist individual's and ves
.selscbargid witli their infringement. These
zirOfccutions wi.ru lu ail cases successful.
DUTIES OH WORKS OF ART.
Mitch anxiety has lately been displayed by
various F.urojiean Governments, and espec
ially by the Government of Italy, for the
abolition ot our Import duties upon works of
art. It is well to consider whether the pre
sent discrimination in favor of the produc
tions of American artists abroad is not likely
to result, as they themselves seem very gen
erally to believe It may. In the practical ex
clusion of our painters and sculptors from
the rich fields for observation, study and la
bor which they have hitherto enjoyed.
JAPAN.
There Is a prospect that the long-pending
revision of the foreign treaties of Japan may
be concluded at a new conference to bedield
at Tokio. While this Government fully rec
ognizes the equal and independent station of
Japan in the community of nations, It would
not oppose the general adoption of such
terms of compromise as Japan may be dis
posed to offer In furtherance of a uniform
policy of intercourse with Western Nations.
MEXICO.
During the past vear the increasing good
will between our ow n Government ami that
of Mexico has beeu variously manifesteil.
The treaty of commercial reciprocity con
cluded .lunnary sw, lssj, has been ratititd and
awaitsthe necessary tariff legislation of Con
gress to become effective. This legislation
will, I doubt not. be among the first meas
ures to claim your nttentioti. A full treaty
of commerce, navigation and consular rights
is much to be desired, and such a treaty, X
have reason to believe, the Mexican Govern
ment stands ready to conclude. Some em
barrassment has been occasioned by the fail
ure of Congress at its last session to provide
means for the doe execution of the treaty of
July ill, !, tor the resurvey of the Mexican
iKiiindary aim tne relocation ox mu uuuu
dary monuments.
fr.tissiA.
The death of our representative at ltussla.
while at Ids post at St. l'etersburg, afforded
to the Imperial Government a renewed' op
portunity to testify Its sympathy In a man
ner befitting tin intimate friendliness which
has ever marked the intercourse of the two
countries.
8IAM.
The course of this Government In raising
its representation at Bangkok to the diplo
matic rank ha evoked from Siatn evidences
id warm friendship and augurs well for our
enlarged intercourse. The Siamese Govern
ment has presented to the I'nited States a
commodious mansion and grounds for tlio
occupancy of the legation, and I suggest that
bv joint resolution Congress attest Us appre
ciation of this generous gilt.
SPAIN. fr"w-
This Government has more than once been
called upon of late to tnxe action in fulfill
ments ot its international obligation toward
Spain, agitation In the island of Cuha hostile
to the spauisii Crown havingbeen fermented
bv persons abusing the sacred rights of hos
pitality wiiicii our territory affords. The of
licers of tiie Goverment have been instructed
to exercise vigilance to prevent infractions
ot our neutraiiiy laws at Key West and at
other points in ar the Cuban coast. 1 am
hftppy to say that In the only instance when
these' precautionary measures were sueeess
Jully eluded, the offenders when found in
our'tcrritoty were subsequently tried and
convicted. The growing need of" close rela
tionship of intercourse and tratlie between
the pamsli Antilles and their natural mar
ket in the I'nited States, led to tne adoption,
in January last, ot a commercial agreement
looking to that end. This agreement has
since been superceded by a more carefully
trained and comprehensive convention
w liich I shall submit to the Senate for ap
proval. It has been the aim of this negotia
tion to open such a favored reciprocal
exchange of production carried un
der the flag of eittier country as
to make the intercourse between Cuba and
I'orto Kieu anl ourselves scarcely less inti
mate than the commercial movement be
tween our domestic ports, and to insure are
moval of the burdens on shipping in the
pnuisb Indies, of w hich In the past our ship
owners and snip masters have so often had
cause to complain. The negotiation of this
convention has lor a time postponed the
prosecution of certain claims of our citizens
w hich were oeciareu to oe wiuimu me juris
diction of the late Spanish-American Claims
Commission, and which wo therefore remit
ted to dinlomatic channels lor adjustment.
The speedv settlement of these claims will
now be urged by the Government.
SAX UO-MINUU.
Neeotiations for a treaty of commercial
reciprocity with the Dominican Uepublic
have been successfully concluded, and the
result w ill shortly be laid before the Senate
TUKKKY.
Certain questions between the I'nited
States and the ottoman Empire still remain
unsolved. Complaints in behalf: of our citi
zens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The
l'orte has sought to withhold from our com
merce tlie right of favored treatment to
w Inch we are entitled bv the existing con
ventional stipulations and the revision of the
tartus is unaccouipnsneit.
VENEZUELA.
The final disposition of the pending ques
tions with Venezuela has not as yet been
reached, but I have good reason to expect an
early settlement, which will provide the
means of re-examining the Carncus ayvards
in conformity with the expressed desire of
Congress, and winch will recognize the jus
tice of certain claims preferred against Vene
zuela.
T11K CENTRAL ANI SOCT1T AMERICAN COMMI3-
S1!)X
appointed bv authority of the act of July
Ins, will soon proceed to Mexico. It has
been furnished with instructions which will
be laid before you. Thev contain a statement
of the general policy of the Government for
enlarging commercial intercourse with
American States. The Commissioners have
been actively preparing for their resjHinsible
task by hobfing conferences in the principal
cities with merchants and others Interested
in Central anil South American trade.
AS INTERNATIONAL INVENTORS EXHIBITION.
is to be held in London next May. This
will cover a field of special importance
in which our country holds a toreniost
rank, but tiie Kxeeutive is at present
powerless to organize a proper rejireseuta
tion of our vast national interests in this
direction. I have in several previous mes
sages referred to this suhject. It seems to
me that a statute giving to the Kxeeutive
general discretionary authority to accept
such invitations and to appoint honorary
commissioners without salary, and placing
at the disposal of the Secretary of state, a
smalt iiiRii lor ueiraving tneir reasonaoie
expenses, would be of great public utility.
COLLISIONS AT SEA.
This Government has received official
notice that the revised international regu
lations for preventing collision at se:
have been adopted bv all the leadim
maritime powers except the United states,
and came into force on the 1st of Sep
tember last. For the due protection of our
shipping interests, the provisions of our
statutes should at once be brought Into con
formity with these regulations.
FOREIliS EXHIIUTIOXS.
This Government is in fre pient receipt of
inv itations from loreign states to participate
in international exhibitions, often of great
interest and importance, occupying as we
do an advanced position on the world's pro
duction and aiming to secure a profitable
share for our industries in the general com
petitive markets, it is a matter of serious
concern that the want of means for partici
palion in these exhibits tdmulit so often ex
elude our producers from advantages en
joyed by those of other countries during the
past year. The attention of Congress was
drawn tothe formal invitatlonsin this reirard
tendered bv the Governments of Kngland.
Holland, li'elgium, Germany and Austria.
The Kxeeutive has in some instances aii
pointed honorary commissioners. This is,
however, a most unsatisfactory expedient
for without some provision to meet the nec
essary working expenses of a commission it
can effect little or nothing in uchaii ot ex
hibitors.
INTERNATIONAL COI'YRir.HT.
The question of securing to authors, com
posers and artistscopyrigiitprivdeges in tills
country in return lor reciprocal rights
abroad justly challenges your attention. It
is true that "a convention will be necessary
for fully accomplishing this result. Hut un
til Congress shall by statute fix tlie extent to
yvhich loreign holders of copyright shad be
here jirivileged.it has been deemed inadvisa
ble to negotiate such conventions. For
this reason the I'nited states was not repre
sented ut the recent conlerence at ISerne.
NEUTRALITY I.WS.
I recommend that the scope of the neutral
ity laws of the Cnited states be so enlarged
as to cover all patent acts of hostility, com
moted in our territory and aimed against the
peace of a friendly nation. Existing statutes
prohibit the fitting out of armed expeditions,
and restrict the shipment of explosives,
though tlie enactments in the latter respect
were not framed with regard to Interna
tional obligations, but simply for the protec
tion of passenger travel. All these statutes
1 were intended to meet special emer
I 2eneies tiiat had altcady arisen. Other
emergencies have arisen since, and modern
ingenuity supplies means for the organiza
tion of hostilities without open resort to
firmed vessels or filibustering parties. I see
no reason why overt preparations in this
country for the commission of criminal
acts, such as are here under consideration,
should not be alike punishublcwhetuer such
acts are intended to bu committed in uue
own country, or In a foreign country with
which we are at peace. The prompt and
thorough treatment of this question Is one
whit h intimately concerns the National
honor.
KATCBALIZATIO-t LAWS.
Our existing naturalization laws also need
revision. Those sections relating to persons
residing within the limits -of the United
states in I'M aud lTif-1 have now only an his
torical interest section 2712, recognizing
the citizenship of the children of naturalized
parents is ambiguous In Its terms and part
ly olisolete. There are special provisions of
law favoring the naturalization of those who
serve in the army or lu merchant vessels, while
no similar privileges are grunted those who
serve in tlie navy or marine corps. "An
uniform rule of naturalization, such
as the Constitution contemplates.
hould, among other things, clearly
define the status of persons born within the
l ulled States, subject to a foreign power."
Section liBiS: "And of minor children of
fathers who have declared their intention of
becoming citizens, but failed to perfect their
naturalization." It might be wise to provide
font central bureau of registry, wherein
should be filed authenticated transcripts of
eveiy record of naturalization in the Meveral
Federal and state Courts and to make pro
vision also tor the vacation or cancellation
of s ich record In cases wdiere fraud had been
iraeticed upon the court by the applicant
imself, or w here he had removed or forfeit
ed bis acquired citizenship. A just and uni
form law in this respect would strengthen
tlie hands of the Government in protecting
its citizens abroad, ami wouid pave the way
for tlie conclusions of treaties of naturaliza
tion w itli foreign countries.
lllei.OMATIC ANI CONSULAR (SERVICE.
The legislation of the last session effected
in the diplomatic and consular service cer
tain changes and reductions wdiich have been
productive of embarrassment. Tiie popula-
ion ami intei'meuiate activity of our conn
rv are steadily on the increase and are giv-
ng rise to ever varying and olten delicate
relationships with other countries. Our
foreign establishment now embraces
nearly double tlie area of operations
than it did twenty years ago. 1 he
confinement of such a service within the lim
its of expenditure then established is not, it
seems to ine, in accordance with true econ
omy. A community of tiu,iKX,M(iO of people
sho'uld be adequately represented In its in
tercourse wit h foreign nations. A project for
the reorganization of consular service and
for recasting the scheme of extra territoriiu
urls'.lictiou is now before vou. If the limits
of n short session ill not allow its full con
sideration. 1 trust you w ill not fail to make
suit able provision'for the present needs of
the service. It has been eustomary to define
u the impropriation acts the rank of each
lipiomatic ottice to which a salary Is at-
tacaed. i suggest that this course be aban
doi'ed, and that it be left to the .'resident,
with the advice and consent of the Senate,
fix lrom time to time tiie diplomatic grade
of the representatives of this Government
abroad as lnav seem advisable, provision
ag definite! v made, however, as now. lor
the amount of salary attached to the re
spective siations.
FINANCIAL.
The condition of our finances and the op
eration of the various branches of the public
services which are connected witli the Treas
ury Department are very fully discussed in
the report of the Secretary. It appears that
the ordinary revenues for the fiscal year end
ed -June mi, isi, were:

pared with the preceding fiscal year there
yy.is a net decrease of over J21,iKm,rtuO in the
amount of expenditures. The aggregate re

previous Dy aoout s.,tt,iuu. ine iaiimg on
ot revenue from customs made up nearly
S2').0),0ii0 of this deficiency, and about f 23,
oOO.iiOO of the remainder was due to the dim

The Secretary estimates the total receipts
for the fiscal vear which will end June3uth,
lrS5. at SUU.tiiKMIOO. and the total expenditures
at $2,.H,(;2iv.'Ol.lK, in which arc included the in
tt rest on tlie debt and the amount payable
to the sinking fund. This would leave a
surplus for the entire year of about Stft.mw,-

SILVER POLLAIiS AND CEhTIFICATKS.
I concur with the Secretary of the Treas
ury in recommending the immediate suspen
sion of the codiage of silver dollars and of
tlie issuance of silver certificates. This is a
matter to which in former communications I
have more than once invoked tlie attention of
the National Legislature. It appears that
annually for tiie past six years there have
been coined in compliance w ith the require
ments of the act of February 2sth, 1S7S, more
than twenty-seven millionsilver dollars. The
number now outstanding is reported by the
Secretary to be nearly Is.0e0,ti00, whereof
but little more than 4ti,000,iKiO, or less than
twenty-two per cent., are in actual circula
tion. The mere existence of this tact seems
to me to furnish of itself a cogent argu
ment for the repeal of the statute which
lias made such fact possible, but there
are other and graver considerations that
tend in the same direction. The Secretary
avows his conviction that, unless this coin
age and issuance of silver certificate be
suspended, silver is likely at no dis
tant iay to become our sole metallic
standard. The commercial disturbance
and the impairment of National credit that
would be thus occasioned can scarcely be
overestimated. 1 hope tiiat the Secretary's
suggestions respecting the withdrawal from
circulation or the ?i und.s2 notes will receive
your approval. It is likely that a considera
ble portion of the silver now in the vaults of
the Treasury might hud its way into cur
rency.
TRADE DOLLARS.
While trade dollars have ceased, for the
present at least, to be an element of active
disturbance in our currencv system, some
provision should be made for their surrender
to the Government, in view or the circum
Htanees under which they were coined and
ot the fact that they have never had a legal
tender quality, there should be offered for
them onlv a slight advance over their bullion
value. The secretary, in the course of his
report, considers the propriety of beautify
ing the designs of our subsidiary silver coins,
and of so increasing their weight that thev
may bear their due ratio of value tothe
standard dollar. His conclusions in this re
gard are cordially approved.
EXCISE TAXES.
In mv annual message of 1SS2 I recom
mended the abolition of ail excise taxes ex
cept those relating to distilled spirits. This
recommendation is now renewed. In case
ilif tnvfd viinll lie it tnli-,hc(l the revenues
that will still remain to the Government I ily armed gunlxiats, one light cruising gun
will, in my opinion, not only sufllce to meet boat, one dispatch vessel armed with llotch-
Its reasonable expenditures, nut will atford
surplus large enougn to permti sucu rami
reduction as may seem to be advisable when
the results of tiie recent revenue laws and
commercial treaties shall have shown in
what quarters these reductions can be most
iuuiciuuoly effected.
FOREIGN TRADB.
One of (Tie gravest of the problermi which
appeal to the wisdom of Congress for solu
tion Is the ascertainment of the mI effec
tive means of increasing our foreign trade,
and thus relieving the depressiou under
which our industries are now languishing.
The Secretary of the Treasury advises that
the duty of investigating this subject be in
trusted in the. first lustaace to a competent
commission. While fully recognizing the
considerations that may be urged against
this course, I am nevertheless of the opinion
that upon the whole no other would be likely
to effect speedier or better results.
SniPPINO INTERESTS. j
That portion of the Secretary's report
which concerns the condition of ot r ship
ping Interests can not fail to command your
attention. lie emphatically recotimeuds
tout as an incentive to tue investment of '
American capital in American steamships,
the Government shall, by liberal payments
for mull transportation or otherw ise, lend its
active assistance to individual enterprise,
und declares his belief thut unless that course
be pursued onr foreign carrying trade must
remain as It is to-day, almost exclusively in
the hands of foreigners, one phase of this
subject is now especially prominent. In view
of the repeal, by the act ot June , lsst, of
all the salntory provisions arbitrarily com
pelling American vessels to curry the mails
to and from the United Metes. As it is nec
essary to make provision to compensate tlie
owners of such vessels for pertoruilng that
service after April, lstts, It is hoped that the
whole subject will receive early considera
tion that will lead to the enactment of such
measures for the revival of our n: erelmnt
marine as the wisdom of Congress may de
vise. CIltCCLATIOS O KATfONAL BANKS.
The three per cent, bon is of the Govern
ment to the amount of niore than $llx),uue,'MiO
have, since my last annual message, been re
deemed by the Treasury. The bouiln of that
issue still outstanding amount to little over
$2UO.(nKI,ooCi, about one-fouith of whic i will be
retired through the operations of the sinking
fund during the coining year. As these
bonds still continue the' chief basis for the
circulation of the National Ilanks. tae ques
tion how to avert the contraction of the cur
rency caused by their retirement is. one of
constantly increasing importance.
It seems to be generally conceded that the
law governing this matter exacts from the
banks excessive security and that upon tlieir
present bond deposits a larger circulation
than is now allowed mar be granted with
satety. 1 hope that the bill which passed the
Senate at the last session, permitting the
issue ot notes equal to the face value of de
posited bonds, w ill commend itself to the
approval of the House of Kepreseatatives.
THE yVAR IEIAHTMENT.
In the expense of the War Department the
Secretary reports a decrease of more than

fected in the expenditures for rivers ami har
bors and $2,7'iO,i)iio in expenditures for the
Ouarterinaster's Department. Outside of
that department the annual expenses of all
the army bureaus proper (except possibly
the ordnace bureau), are substantially
charges which can not be materially dimin
ished without change in the numerical
strength of the army. Tiie expenditures in
the juurtermaster's Department can readily
be subjected to administrative discretion,
aud it is reported by the secretray of War
that as a result of exercising such discretion
in reducing the nuuthcr ot draught animals
in the army the annual cost of supplying aud
caring for such animals is now $1 ,"lOtt,OS5.yo
less than it was in lss.
The reports of the military cortimander.
show that the last year has been notable for
its entire freedom from Indian outbreaks.
THE INPIAN TERRITORY RAIIU.RS.
In defiance of the President's proclamation
of July I, 1SS4, certain intruders e-ought to
make settlements in tiie Indian Territory.
Thev were promptly reLaoveu pv it detach
ment of troops. During the past session of
Congress a bill to provide a suitable tire
proof building for the Army Medical Museum
and the library of tlie Surgeon-General's
ortiec received the approval of the Senate. A
similar bill renorted liiv-nmblv to the House
of Kepresentaf ives by one of its committees
Is still pending before that body. It is hoped
that during the coming session the measure
may become a law, anil immediate steps may
be taken to secure a place of safe dejiosit for
these valuable collections now in a state of
insecurity'. "The funds with which the
works" for the improvement of rivers and
harbors were prosecuted duringthe past year
were derived from the appropriations of the
act or August 1. ls2. together witn
snch few balances as were on band
from previous appropriations. The bal
anee in tlie Treasury subject to requisition
July 1, 1X83, was $1U,021,M1I.!; the amount
appropriated during the fiscal year isst was
,;tr.i,tj4,to2t, ana tue amount urawn iroin ine
Treasury during the fiscal year was $f,22H,-

SEABOARD CITIES,
Tlie Secretary of War submits the report
ot tne cniet oi r.ngmeers as to tne practica
bility of protecting our important cities on
the seaboards by fortifications aud other
defenses able to repel modern methods of
attiiek. The tune lias now come when such
defenses can be prepared with confidence
that they will not prove abortive, and when
the possible result of d-?lay in making such
preparation is seriously considered, delay
seems inexcusable. For the most important
eities, those whose destruction or capture
would be a National Humiliation, adequate
defenses, inclusive or guns, may tie maue oy
the gradual expenditure of Jiii,i00,uiiO, a sum
much less than a victorious enemy could
levy as a contribution. An appropriation of
about one-tenth of that amount is asked to
begin tlie work, and 1 concur wito the Secre
tary of War in urging that it be granted.

message of F'ebruary sth, 1SS4. in my message
ot March 2iitn, iss4, l cjuieu attention to the
recommendation of the board that the Gov
eminent should encourage tiie production of
private steel works ot tlie required material
for heavy cannon, and that two Government
factories, one for the Army and one for the
avy, snouiu tie estuoiisneu tor tne iaunca
tiou oi guns from such material. N'o action
having been taken, the Hoard was subse
quently reconvened to then determine more
fully the plans and estimates necessary
for carrying out its recommendations.
It has received information which indicates
that there are responsible steel inunufaetur
ers in tills countiy, w ho, although not pro
vided at present with tlie necessary plant,
are wining to construct me same auu to
make mds ior contracts witn the Govern
ment for the supply of the requisite material
for the heaviest guns adapted to modern
warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient
magnitude, accompanied by a positive an
propriation extending over a series of years,
shall be made by Congress. All doubts as to
the feasibility of tue plan being thus re
moved, 1 renew my recommendation, that
such action ne taken oy Congress as will en
able the Government to construct its own
ordnance upon its own territory, and so to
provide the armaments demanded by con
siuerations ot national saiety and nonor.
TUB KAVT.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy ex
hibits the progress which has been made on
the new sieel cruisers authorized by tne acts
of August 5th, 1SS2, and March 3d, lvti. of the
tour vessels unoer contract one, tue etneago,
of 4,500 tons, is more than half finished: the
Atlanta. 3,(AI tons, has beeu successfully
launched, and her machinery is. now fitting
tlie lioston, also of 3,(i0 tons, is ready for
launching, and the Dolphin, a uispatcn
steamer of l.jooton; is read v for delivery.
Certain adverse criticisms upon the designs
of these cruisers are discussed oy tne !ec
retary, who Insists that the correctness
of the conclusions reached by the
Advisory lioard and bv the De
DHrtraeiit has been demonstrated bv
recent developments iu shipbuilding
abroad. '1 lie machinery or the oouhte
turreted monitors, J'uritan, Terror an
Amphitrite, contracted lot" under tlie
uct of March 3d, 1SS3, is in process
ot construction. iNo worK has oeen done
durii,g the past year on their armor, for lael
of tie necessary appropriations. A fourt
monitor, the Monadnock. still remiuus un
finished at the navy j ard in California. It is
recommended that early steps be taken to
complete these vessels, and to provide also
an armament for the monitor niantonomah.
The recommendations of the Naval Advisory
Hoard, upproved by the department, com
prise the construction of one steel cruiser of
..r,'U tons, ono cruiser oi o,iiu ions, iwo neav-
a kiss cannon, one armored ram andtnree tor

which are calculated to niecs tiie existing

The act Of Congress annrnvod Anraxt 7.

Statee of the bodies .of l.imitennta 'om-
mattder George W. Delxmg and his com
panions of the Jeannette expedition. Tula
removal has been successfully accom
plished by Lieutenants Harberanu Scbuetze.
The remains were taken front their grave
in the Lena Delta in March, bus, and were re
taiued at Yakutsk until the following winter.
the season being too far advanced to admit
of their immediate transportation. They ar
rived at New York February 20, 1S&4, where
they were received w Unsuitable honors.
TIIE GREKLY BELIEF EXPEDITION.
In pursuance of the Joint resolution of
onarress, approved February 13, ltl, a naval
expedition was fitted out ior the relief of
Lieutenant a. w . ureeiy, i mica states Army,
and of the party who had been engaged un
der his command in scientific observations
at Lady Franklin Kay. The fleet consisted of
.the steam sealer Thetis, purchased in Kng.
lanu ; ine ueur, purcmiseu at ;i. uonns, New
foundland, aud tlie Alert, which was gener
ously provided by the liritish Government.
preparations ior the expedition were
promptly made by the secretary of the N avy,
with the active co-operation of the Secretary
of War. Commander George W. Collin was
piaceu in comuianu oi tne Alert, ana Lieu
tenant W. 1L F.uiery in command of the Bear.
The Thetis was intrusted to Commander
Wenfleld S. Copley, to whom also was as
signed the superintendence ot the entire
expedition. Immediately upon its ar
rival at Uperuavik the fleet began the
dangerous navigation of Melville Bay,
and, in spite of every obstable, reached Lit
tleton Island on June 22d, a fortnight earlier
than ai,y vessel bad before attained that
point. On the same day it crossed over to
Cape Sabine, where Lieutenant Greely and
the other survisors ot his party were discov
ered. After taking on board the living and
tlie bodies of the dead, the relief ships sailed
for St. Johns, where tuey arrived on July
urn. Aiiey were appropriately received as
Portsmouth, N". II., on August 1st, and at New
fork on August sth. One of the bodies vu
landed at the former place. The others were
put on shore at Governor's Island, and,
with the exception of one which van In
terred In the National Cemetery, were for-
wurueu meuce io me destination indicated
by friends. The organization and conduct
of this relief expedition reflects great credit
upon an who contributed to its success. .
A STRONG SAVr XEEPEU.
In this, the last of the stated messages that !
shall have the honor to transmit to the Con-
gress of the United States, i tan not ton
strongly urge on its attention the dutv of re
storing onr navy as rapidly as possible to the
hiku wi cukktuv; miiicu xoruieriy cnar-
aeterizet it. As the long peace that has
lulled us into a sense of fancied security
may at any time be disturbed, it is plain tiiat
the policy of strengthening this arm of the
service is dictated by considerations of use,
economy, of a just regard for our future tran
quility, aud of atrue appreciation of the dig
nity and honor of the Uepublic
THB POSTAL SERVICE.
The report of the Postmaster-General ac
quaints you with the present condition
and the needs of tho postal service. It dis
closes the gratifying fact that the loss of
revenue from reduction in rate of letter
postage as recommended in my message De
cember, lss.2, and affected by the act of
March 3, ldis, has been much less than was
generally anticipated. Mv recommendation
of tins reduction was naseu upon tne oenef
that the actual lulling on in receipts from
letter postage ror uie year immediately suc
ceeding the change of rate would be J3.000.-
oou. It has proved to be ouly f-2,275,000. This
is a irusiw onny inuicaior mat me revenue
will soon be restored to its former volume
by the natural mcrease of -bealed corre
spondence.
ONE CENT POSTAGE.
I confidently repeat, therefore, the recora
mendation ot my last annual message that
single rate postage upon drop letters be re-
iliweri In one cent: wherever liavment of two
cents is now required by law. Double rate is
only expected at offices where the carrier
system is in operation, and It appears that at
those offices where the carrier system Is In
operation that tue increase in tue tax upon
local letters defrays the cost not only of its
own collection ant uenvery, Dut or tne col
lection and delivery of all other mail matter.
This is an inequality that ought no longer to
exist.
UNITY Ot WEIGHT.
I approve the recommendation of the Post
master General that the unit of weights in
tlie rating of first-class matter should be one
ounce instead of one-half ounce as it now is.
In view of the statistics furnished by the de
partment it may well be doubted whether the
change would result in any loss of revenue.
That it wouid greatly promote the conveni
ence or tne puonc is oeyond dispute. The
free delivery system has been lately applied
to five cities, and the total number of offices
in which it is now in operation is 159. r. y
perience shows that its adoption under
proper conditions is equally an accommoda
tion to the public anil an advantage to the
postal service. It is more than self-sustaining,
and for the reasons urged by the Postmaster-General
may be properly extended.
EXCEPTIONAL DISPATCH.
It Is the opinion of that officer that It is
proper to provide means whereby excep
tional dispatch In dealing with letters in
free delivery offices may be secured by
paving extraordinary postage. This scheme
might be made effective by the employment
of a special stamp whose cost should be
commensurate with the expenses of the ex
tra service. In some of the large cities
private express companies have, under
taken to outstrip the Government mall
carriers by affording for the prompt trans
mission of letters better facilities than
have hitherto been at the command of tne
l'ost-otflce. It has always been the policy
of the Government to discourage such enter-
prises, and in no better way ean that policy
be maintained than in supplying the public
witli the most efficient mail service that,
with due regard to its own best interests, can
be furnished for its accommodation.
ATTORNEY-tiKNERAL'S REPORT.
Tlie Attnrnev-tieneral renews the recom
mendation contained in his report of last !
year, touching the fees of witnesses and
jurors. He favors radical changes in the fee
bill, the adoption of a system by which at
torneys anu marsnais oi mc imicu
should be compensated solely by salaries,
and the erection by the Government of a
penitentiary for theeoimnemeuioi oucnuers
against its laws.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Of the variouo Governmental concerns In
charge of the Interior Department the re
ports of its Secretary presents an interesting
summary. Among the topics deserving par
ticular attention. I refer you to his observa
tions respecting our Indian affairs, the pre
emption and timber culture acts, the failure
of railroad companies to take title to lands
granted by the Government, and the opera
tions of the Pension office, the Patent office,
the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Educa
tion. THE INPIANS.
Allusion has been made already to the cir
cumstances that both as between different
Indian tribes and as between Indians and
the whites, the rast year has been one of un
broken peace. In this circumstance tlie
President is glad to tind justification for the
Fiolicy of the Government in dealing withthe
ndia'n question and confirmation of the
views which were fully expressed in my first
recommendation to the Forty-seventh Con
gress. The Secretary urges anew the
enactment of a statute for the pun
ishment of crimes committed on In
dian reservations, and recommends the
passage of the bill now pending In
the House of liepresentatives for the pur
chase of a tract of lS.uOO square miles from
the sioux reservation. Both these measures
nre worthy of approval. I concur with him
also in advising tlie repeal of the pre-emption
law, the enactment of statutes resolving
the present legal complications touching
lapsed grants to railroad companies, and the
funding of the debt of the several Pacific
llatlroads under such snaranty as shall ef
fectually insure its ultimate puvment.
UTAH.
The report of the Utah Coramlslon
will be read with Interest. It dis
closes the results of recent legislation
looking to the prevention and pun
ishment of polygamy in that Territory.
1 still believe that if tnat abominable prac
tice ean be suppressed by law it can only
be by the most, radical legislation consistent
withthe restraints of the Constitution. I
again recommend, therefore, that Congress
assume absolute political control of the ter
ritory of Utah and provide for the apPr'ln'
menfof a commission with such r( "n:
mental powers as in its judgment may Justl
and wisely lie put into their hands.

that go to the making of good citizens. Our
system of tax and tariff legislation It yieldimr
a revenue which la in excess of the present
needsof theGoverument. These are 'dements
from which it is sought to devise a stHieme b
which, without unfavorably chancing tha
condition of the working men, our merchant
marine shall be raided from its en
feebled condition, and new markets
Erovlded for the sale beyond our
orders of the manifold fruits of industrial
enterprises. The problem la complex
and ean be solved by no single measure ot
innovation or reform. The countrha of the
American continent and the adjacer t islands
are, for the United States, the natu;-al mar
ket of supply and demand. It is front them
that we should obtain what we do not pro

enactment of measures to f ivir th
construction and maintenance of a steam-
carrying marine under tne nag or the United

uniform currency basis for the countries of
America, so that the coined products of our

out the whole system of commonwealths.
This would require a mcnefarv union ot

and mints might thus be utilized,
and a step taken toward the general re
monetijation of silver. To the ac-omplish-tnent

already concluded and now in progress
have been directed, and the favor with
which this enlarged policy has thus tar been
received, warrants the belief that ita opera

of the embarrassing elements In the great
National conflict between protection and free

that the revenue may be reduce 1 so as no

The good results therein foreshadowed
have been more than realized. The sys

its friends in securing competent and
faithful public servants and in pro
tecting the appointing officers ot the
Government from the pressure of per
sonal Importunity and from the labor of
examining the claims and pretensions of
rival candidates for public employment. Tbe
law has had the unqualified support of tha
President and of the beads of the several de
partments, and the members of tne Commis
sion have performed their duties with seal
and fidelity. Their report will shortly be
submitted, and will be accompanied by snch
recommendations for enlarging the scope ot
the existing statute as shall commend them
selves to the Executive and the Commission
