A Hark Backward.
In the light of President Taft's
message to Congress on the subject,
it seems very much like the cry to
repeal the Sherman anti-trust law Is
a wall p behalf of the big interests
I and the monopolists. It is a bark
backward instead of a cry of_
progxessiveness.
The president plainly showed that'
the supreme court decrees in the
Standard Oil and American Tobaccp;
trust cases have been effectual in t
breaking up these monopolies. The.
trusts were dissolved, the holding
companies were required to dlstrib-'
ute stock of subsidiary companies;
among the stockholders and were
forbidden to acquire the stock of
the concerns again, certain parts of;
business engaged In solely b? certain ;
companies were distributed amon?:
various concerns so as To make com-;
petition not only possible but nec-|
essary, and the different corpora-!
tions were enjoined from conspiring:'
|i or combining to restore any monop-;
oly.
?r; It Js not the purpose of the;
law as newly construed to con-,
flscate property, nor to prohibit tlje i
transaction of business merely be-j
cause of its size but simply to prevent
the stifling of competition, the
enhancing of prices and the estab-,
lishment of a monopoly when such
Is the purpose or necessary effect of j
the maintenance of a combination j
of immense size. Even if any of
tl the stockholders of tlie remaining
companies of the dissolved trusts
should attempt by concerted action
of their companies to control the
market they would immediately be;
subject to contempt proceedings!
I and imprisonment or a summary
character.
E The Sherman anti-trust law tan
be amended and the president be- j'
Iicves certain amendments would)
be of distinct advantage. such as
p prohibiting a corporation from bold-j
ine the stock of other corporations
alnd providing for other regulations
and limitations under a federal incorporation
act. But, when any one
f seeks by a repeal of the anti-trusty
I laws to undo all the good work!
that has been done and start all
: oyer again when the experiences Of
two decades have brought us to
actual realization of effectiveness In
the way of legal suppression, it is
well to look to the motives thereof
and see whose axe is be'ng ground.
jl- Those Pipe Dreams.
Certain Washington correspond-,
ents to newspapers in this state arej
imposing on the latter as shown by
what is purely fancy on their part !
Por instance, the last two daysj
those correspondents have had Virgil
iL>. Highland, of this city, chair-1
man of the State .Republican Cora-'
mittee, holding conferences with.
President Taft and others. One of
the correspondents, a protege of
"Jlmmie" VVier, a private secretary'
to a United States Senator, has been j
bold enough to make the declaration
under his own name.
First, they had Mr. Highland
rushing to Washington to tell former
Senator Nathan .11. Scott that ho
must run for governor and then they
proceeded to say that Highland and,
t Scott had actually held a conference
in Washington, not-withstand-,
ing Scott was in Whccl ng at the I
time and Highland in Clarksburg. !
EV Fallowing this they declared that
Chairman Highland had just called j
on the President At the time they
had Mr (Highland dons this, he
doubtless ^yis in his home here,
sound asleep At any rate he **3S|
in ClarkBburg and not in Washing-,
ton.
Some of these correspondents'
[ A Perl
l j i Cent
ins mistaken, unless they resort to
saying they got tfifvrrottg Information.
Such . a statement -wonld convict
them of unreliability in getting
[facts as a 'basis of -their taniry
writing.
Am seen from this angle, the truth
seems to be that they, thought the
state chairman would be in Wa*hingtqp
about the time of the opening
of Congress and it was impossible
to get it from their minds other
than to erroneously declare that he
was there. So palpable is their
misstatements in these instances,
that they discredit their otber political
writings.
The Rainbow (hasem.
A great deal of wind jamming
comes from ^Democratic space killers
,in Washington these days about the,
wonderful things the (Democrats are.
going to do in Congress and about,
the roseate chanc^p their party has:
of riding a candidate into the:
presidential chair at tble next elee-,
tlon. These tales, however, are butj
fantasies that will rapidly be dls-j
pelled.
tin the first place, it Is not likely;
the Democrats -will do much of anything
but quarrel over factional differences
during the present session i
of the Congress. The Democrats
are always going to do something
but never do it, only when they are!
assured that what they do will go
for naught. In the second place, the
most of the Democrats who have already
nominated, elected and Inaugurated
a 'Democratic president
are in the same class with the rain- j
bow chasers.
.Of course, with their majority In
the House and their late Senate ac-;
cessions, the (Democrats have gone
back to Washington in more buoyant
spirits than they have possessed
in many a day. The
sanguine jiembers of the clan, like
Tom 'Hetlin, of Alabama, and Ollle
James, of Kentucky, think they have
already elected a president. Xo sort
of reasoning enters into their calculations.
for they are of the rainbow-?
chasing brotherhood who always
prognosticate a Democratic victory
simply because they want it that
way. The rude jars they have been
getting all these years interfere not]
at all with their vauntings. .
They do not take into account sev-'
eral important factors, first being'
the matter of^tlme. The election of
a .president is nearly a year away,
and between now and then much
water will flow over the dam. With
in a twelve-month the voters cr
America will have time for digest-ng
the record of the present White ,
House incumbent and doing justice
to a singularly pure and broadmined
executive.
Another thing that the rainbow-1
chasers of the James Heflin school
do not take into consideration is that
the American people are dear lover*
of that trait which Mr. Taft is al
jjgrfect exemplar?a candor that is
absolute. The very fact that the
President's want of guile has led
him to say that he has made mis-j
takes is going to be a tower ofj'
strength. The opposition may;
chuckle all it pleases, but the si-j
leiit, thoughtful citizen thinks tremendously
more of the president
who says that he occasionally errs
than of the politician who is ever
hiding things that may be to his
own detriment. The 'President Is'
as honest as the day is long and
knowing his frankness and sincerity.
the mass of his countrymen are
willing to trust the man they know
to one who may be all right and'
-??'? ttiqv not. The Taft who'
iucu aiju.u
is open anil above board, who Is
straight and true and who is faith-1
ful to his ideals "is the man to
whom tha favor and confidence of
his countrymen will revert with
such a watte of sympathetic ac-|
knowledgment that his prolongation
of official life. Is easy to foretell.
Inspector Needed.
A prominent citizen suggests that
Clarksburg should have an inspector
of weights and measures, and he ex-,
presses surprise that a city of so
much uptodateness did not long
since create an oflice of that kind. i
