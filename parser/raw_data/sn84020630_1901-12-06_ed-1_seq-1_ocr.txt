Chicago, Dec 6. The last session of
the 5th annual convention of the Nat
ional Livestock association was held at
Studebaker's theater today. The at
tendance was better than on any pre
..iriio riov ns the nlace for the next
convention was to be selected. Pitts-hiiro-
Portland. Oreeon. Denver and
Kansas City were among the candl
dates. The new executive committee,
F. J. Hagerbarth, chairman, reported

follows: President, John W. Springer;
vice president, F. J. Hagerbarth; sec
ond vice president, John W. Holt; sec

ment inspection; that goat raisers be
protected against Chinese goatskins;
that the association recognize the fight
of Ed. Reed of Colorado, against In

honorary member.
A resolution of Interest to horse
raisers was adopted. It calls for less
rigid inspection of horses intended for

my, and suggests the appointment of
a committee of four army men and
eight horse breeders to act as judges at
shows where prizes shall be given for
horses best fitted for service In various
branches of the army.

officers of the association Is praised

ted, was adopted unanluk dtity.

promptu speech by iSecretary Maxwell
of the Irrigation congress. He said that
water was the very root of successful
cattle raising and told of the ways of
getting water. Chairman Springer fol
lowed with a description of how he se
curea an abundance of water on a
ranch, the previous owners of which
were reputed to have starved owing to
their inability to get drink for their
cattle.

to report favorably on the new Hay-
Pauncefote treaty, providing for the

No votes were cast against the trea
ty, but it was criticized sharply by
Senators Moody and Bacon, who found
In it many objections which they urged
against the old treaty. They took es
pedal exception to the provision con-
tinuing in force tho neutrality provis
ion in the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, also
to the clause specifically authorizing
the United States to police the canal,
and placing a limitation upon the pow
er of this country absolutely to control

effect of the treaty as sent to the sen
ate would be to deprive the , United
States of control of the canal In case of

be pressed in the senate. The commit
tee voted to recommend that the in
junction of secrecy be removed from
the treaty.

THE FORT STANTON SANITARIUM.
What Is Being Doae for the Ealief of Oon
sumptive Sailors.
Surgeon J.. M. Carrlngton is now in
charge of the marine hospital for con
sumptives at Fort Stanton in Lincoln
county. Temperate young men who
are strong enough to work, even though
consumptive, can obtain positions at
the sanitarium as waiters, assistant
nurses, gardeners and mechanics or In
other occupations .thus affording
comfortable home to consumptive
workmen who desire occupation at a
higher altitude. The wages paid range
from 1 to $2 a day. While the sanitar
ium is a most perfect home for the
afflicted sailors, quite a number of the
patients become homesick and long to
see the sea. Some' insist upon leaving
before entirely recovered, but some
times return with, the disease broken
out again.
The marine hospital is not technical
ly a government institution although It
Is under the jurisdiction of the assist
ant treasurer of the United States. The
marine service originated many years
ago from a fund raised by the sailors
on merchant ships who contributed
small sums out of their monthly wages,
Later merchant ships were taxed ac
cording to their tonnage and now the
fund is so large that many marine
hospitals are maintained out of it
throughout the United States, Fort
Stanton being exclusively for consump
tive sailors.
Fort Stanton is about six miles from
the railroad station at Capitan. It is a
picturesque little settlement In the fer
tile Bonito valley, surrounded by pine
covered mountains. The fort is sup,-
plled with a steam laundry, electric
light works,' ice plant, dairy, butcher
shop, pasture, gardens and comes near
being a communistic settlement, self
sufficient and supplying nearly all Its
own wants.
There are a few over one hundred
natients at the sanitarium. There are
six surgeons and thirty attendants,
Each patient is examined upon enter
ing the sanitarium and an accurate
daily clinical record is kept of his con
ditlon. The more advanced cases are
sent to the hospital and the incipient
cases are assigned to the neat rooms In
different wards. Those who are able to
leave their rooms go- to their meals
three times a day and are given a milk
and cracker lunch in the forenoon. The
food consists of meat and plenty of It,
eggs, butter, milk, bread and vegeta
bles and desert. In the sick wards
physicians and nurses are in constant
attendance. All the accommodations
of the fort, including board, room,
laundrylng, medicine and attendance
are furnished free to the patients.
Cleanliness is enjoined upon the pa
tients. They must be temperate and
regular in their habits. They are com
pelled to be In the open air, to exercise
If their condition permits and to eat as
heartily as possible. In fact, upon the
observance of those three conditions
depends the promise of a cure. Intoxi
cants are not allowed on the reserva
tion. Every precaution Is taken to
kill all germs and patients must use
a pocket cuspidor, which is burned ev
ery evening. Outdoor games and par
aphernalia for the inmates are sup
plied. A good library is also main
tained.
Quite a number of cures already
stand to the credit of the institution,
and some of them are nothing short of
the miraculous. Outdoor life in the
peerless New Mexico climate, moderate
exercise, regularity of habits and the
stuffing process as far as diet is con
cerned, are the factors that produce
the cures or in hopeless cases : bring
about an amelioration of symptoms
and a prolongation of life, although no
case can be pronounced hopeless until
death has knocked at the door.

Senator Elkins Wednesday afternoon
Introduced the New Mexico admission
bill.
It is Just 26 years since, as delegate
from New Mexico, he presented the
first of the bills for an enabling act for
that territory, which have failed be
cause of persistent hostility to the ter
ritory's admission. The senator says
he Is going to do everything he can
this year for New Mexico, and there is
undoubtedly a better chance than for
some years. It Is not regarded as
good sign that the president, of whose
support much has been expected, omit
ted all reference to admission of any of
the territories In his message. It
however, certain that Mr. Roosevelt
looks with more favor on New Mexico
than the other aspiring territories.
a bill is passed admitting New Mexico
it will be promptly signed by him.
Delegate Flynn had a long talk with
the president about Oklahoma Wed
nesday afternoon. It is said the pres
ident does not favor the admission of
Oklahoma until the matter of the civ
llized tribes is disposed of. There
so much fear about this territory that
Senator Fairbanks makes an attempt
to Inject sentiment Into the question in
a bill introduced by him today. In this
bill he proposes Oklahoma's admission
and that Its capital shall be named
McKInley.
Representative Curtis of Kansas,
Wednesday, Introduced the bill pro
viding-for establishment of a reserva
tion of 100,000 acres in southern New
Mexico to be fenced and used as graz
ing ground for buffalo.
Senator Culberson and Congressman
Stephens of Texas, have both Intro
duced bills to provide for what is term
ed the equitable distribution of the
waters of the Rio Grande between the
United States and Mexico, and for the
purpose of building an international
dam and reservoir at El Paso. The
bills provide that there shall be no ap
propriation and storage of the waters
of the Rio Grande or its tributaries to
which others have right by prior ap
propriation; and persons guilty of un
lawfully appropriating and storing
these waters Bhall be punished by a
fine not exceeding $5,000, or by impris-
onmentffot exceeding one year, or by
both. The bill also authorizes the sec
retary of state to proceed with the
consultation of a treaty between the
United States and Mexico providing
for the dam.
Senator Hansbrough Wednesday re-
Introduced his irrigation bill of last
session, with various amendments. It
provides for the setting aside of the
moneys derived from the sale of pub
lie lands in the arid and semi-arid re
gions of the United States and the col
lection of these moneys In a fund to be

tails of its collection and expenditure.
