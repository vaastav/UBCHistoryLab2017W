THE STATE'S OLDEST NEWSPAPER
(Established 1873)
VA
The by-products of the farm often are greater than the
main product. Profits from cows,and poultry have put the
earning power of many a farmer's wife above that which
he considers his end of the business. An example. Recently
a
representative was consulting bankers in a western
North Dakota village. The visitor was informed that the
sales of turkeys in that section "would reach $40,000 this
year, more than the wheat sales.
The importance of dairying and poultry cannot be
Stressed too greatly. Noi can one too strongly impress
iipon the prospective immigrant the opportunity offered in
ftorth Dakota for their development.
AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM
Every farmer is directly affeeted by railroad rates anc|
Iherefore has a direct interest in the railroad problem. He ^oryan°dt \lne
is* suffering now from high freight rates, and the rate" ques­
tion is far from settled.
North Dakotans, on the eve of an extended good roads
program, may well afford to consider the relation of the
building of a vast highway system adapted to modern trans­
portation from the experience of many eastern states,
One may now travel, on paved highways on the old Na­
tional Road from St. Louis, Mo. to'Washington, D. C. There
is a motor traffic line operating -ever this road, and also
between New York and Boston, ^fecrease in motor freight
traffice as well as passenger cars have seriously impaired
revenues of inter-city electric lines in the middle west cen­
ters. Long-distance motor tourist traffice has decreased
railroad passenger receipts. The long-distance motor freight
traffic threatens even more to decrease the revenues of the
railroads.
It is hardly conceivable that the railroads will not always
be a necessity. It is plain, hqwever, that if the develop­
ment of automotive transportation continues the income of
the railroads will be seriously impaired. This means high
freight and passenger rates.
It is equally certain that public derpand will cause con­
tinued extension of better highways throughout the
country.
The natural solution,. therefore,* is to cfo-ordinate them,
fhis President Harding suggested in a messagS'to Congress.
The dispatches said: "He inveighs against the system of
paralleling the railroads with thick roads, thus drawing
freight from the steam lines instead of making the motpr
truck feeder to them." ,•
Two separate transportation systems Where one can do
fhe work is bound to be costly. Coordination may avoid
this.excessive cost and'refem the bgftefit of added facilities.

I Business so far this year has been 12 per cent better than
a year ago, judging by freight traffic. From the first of the
yfear to Nov. 1 the railroads moved about 33,000,000 cars of
revenue-producing freight, or 12 per dent above the first 10f
rijonths of 1921.
The figure doesn't seem big. But, according to many
economists, the difference between boom times and hard times

THK JOB AHEAD
The one great cry in this state
is a demand for government
economy. The Xestos regime
93ems to be making a good effort
in this direction but there are
jniany things that could still be
done that would lessen the stute
tax burden materially and not de­
tract from the efficiency of the
government. One of these things
is the reduction in the number of
state employees who are at pres­
ent employed in more or less use­
less positions. As an example we
might draw attention to the fol­
lowing: We are reliably informed
that there are at present two men
in the city who are taking an in­
ventory of state property at the
State Teachers College. It seems
that the duties of these two men
are to measure and count the
«esks in the school, take an m-
state property in the school. Why
is it necessary to have twoj men
employed a good salaries, plus ex­
penses. to do this work? If an in­
ventory of state property is ne­
cessary!, and it undoubtedly is, why
could it not be done with the help
of the employees of the school?
The ordinary taxpayer, wanting
sucfy an ipvqntory, would ask each
•professor in the school-to hand in
•a list of antlcles in his, or her,
room which the state owned.
When these were handed in, and it
shouldn't take but a few minutes
for each person to make out the
list, they could be assembled and
forwarded to the proper officials
at Bismarck. In that way two ex­
tra salaries and the expenses of
two men could be saved. Yester­
day there was a man in the city
checking up the poolrooms, in­
specting the premis.es and jotting
down the numbers of tobacco li­
censes, etc. Is there any good rea­
son why this work could not be
done just as efficiently and a great
.deal more conomically by the lo­
cal officials, either the police de­
partment or the sheriff's office?
Is it economy for the state to have
salaried men doing this work when
it could be done as well by local
men? Two or three months ago
there was a man in (he city who
presented credentials 9howing him
to be the traveling auditor for the
workmen's compensation buireau.
His work seemed to be covered by
the dating and signing of a form
which he carried. His efforts
would not result in on'e penny of
added revenue to the state but his
salary and expense accounts adds
just that much to the tax burden
of the state. We know that many
of these positions were created by

FARM PAPER'S VIEW OF STATE MILL
The following editorial is from Farm, Stock and Home of Minne­
apolis Original organ of the Varmev3 Alliance of Minnesota and orie
of the strongest proponents of cooperation and advanced farm or­
ganization. It appeared Nov. 15.
WHY STATtJ MILLING
On the first of this month\North Dakota extended its
venture into the flour milling business- when it opened its
mill at Grand Forks by starting 'its first unit^f a thousand
barrel a day capacity. The second unit of like size will be
started later, to be followed "with the durum section. This
may properly be considered the real start of state milling,
as its original venture at Drake was on a small scale and in
a disadvantageously situated mill.
I We hope this experiment will prove satisfactory to the
people of North Dakota, but frankly, we have never been
able to see just what real benefit, the farmers are to derive
from this mill. If it should run three hundred and fifteen
days in the year at full capacity, it would use about three
million bushels of bread wheat and half as much durum,
not enough to be a factor in giving the farmers any more
money for their wheat. As a matter of fact, if North Dakota
should build enough mills to grind every bushel of wheat
they raise, it could not pay more for wheat than outside
mills could buy it for, as much of the North Dakota floui*
under those conditions would have to be sold in the open
market in competition with every other spring wheat mill.
Neither do w)e see hew this mill can save m^lch to the
flour consumers of North Dakota, unless it cuts the price
of its raw materials, something it cannot do becatise! farmers
will ship to Minneapolis or Duluth if they can get more
money..
Theoretically, there is a saving in freight on the wheat
to Minneapolis and the. flour back to North Dakota points,
but in actual practice we think the decreased cost of produc­
tion in the mills -'at Minneapolis, with their cheaper power
and larger output, will enable them to put their flour in the
hands of the North Dakota retailers as cheaply as the state
mill can do it. Farmers within hauling distance will bene­
fit by selling directly to the mill on sample instead of dis­
posing of their wheat on grade at a country house, but the
growers so situated from a small percentage of North Pakota
farmers..
If this mill makes enough to, pay the interest on the
$2,500,000 bonds issued to build it, and to eventually retire
I them, the tarcpayers will be lucky. If a portion of the plant
could be run as an experimental mill, to test the flour mak
ing qualities of various sorts and conditions Of wheat on a
commercial basis, much good might result, but it is our
understanding that it is not the intention to do this.,
The only justification we have ever .seen .for st|ate or
government operation is in the. case of natural monopolies,
but flour milling does not, by any stretch, of imagination,
fall into
classification.
