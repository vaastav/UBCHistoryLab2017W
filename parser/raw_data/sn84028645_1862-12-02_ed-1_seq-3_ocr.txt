Synopsis of the President's Message.
71
I
,
He saya tbe correspondence' touching foreien
affairs which has taken plaoe duriog tbe last
rear is herewith submitted, in compliance with
request to that effeot. If tbe oonditlon of our
relatioos with other nations Is less sratifr iocr
than formerly, It Is certainly more satisfactory
than a nation so unhappily distracted might
bave reasonably apprehended. A blockade of
three thousand mile of aeaooaat oonld not be
established and vigorously enforced in a season
of (treat commercial aotivitv like the present
without committing occasional mistakes and
lnfliotlDg unintentional Injuries npon foreign
nations and subjects. In clear cases of
these kinds I have, so far as possible,
nearu ana rearessea complaint by Iriendly
powers. There Is, however, a large and aug
menting number of doubtful oases upon wblch
the Government Is unable to agree with the
Governments whose protection is demanded by
tbe claimants, inure are, moreover, many
oasea in which the (Jolted States or tbelr oltl
aens suffer wronge from the naval or military
authorities of foreign nations, whloh the Gov
ernment or theee Htatee are not at once ore
pared to redress. I have proposed to some of
the foreign States Interested, mutual conven
tions to examine and aduat euoh complaint.
i nis nas neen maae especially to Ureal Britain,
Franoe, Spala and Prussia. In eaoh oase it has
been kindly received, but not yet formally
aaoptea. .
Applications have been made to me by maoy
free Americana of African desoenl to favor
tbelr emigration with a view to suoh coloniza
tion as was contemplated In rcoent aota of Con
gress. Other parties, at borne and abroad,
eome from Interested and other motives, bave
suggested similar measures, while on the other
band, several or tbe Spanleh American
Republic have protested against the
aendlng of inch colonies to their re-
apeotlve territories. Under these circum
stances, I bave deolluod to move any snob
colony lo any State without first obtaining the
consent of its Government, with an agreement
on Its' part to receive ond protect such emi
grants In all tbelr rights as freemen, and I bare
at the same time offered to tbe several States
situated in the tropics, or having colonies there,
to negotiate with them, subject to tbe advioe
and consent of the Senate, to faror
the voluntary emigration of portions cf
that cla-s to their respective territo
ries, upon conditions whloh shall be
equal, just aud humane. Liberia and HaviI
are yet the only countries to which colonists of
African descent from here could go, with cer
tainty of being reoelved and adopted as oltl
aens; and I regret to ear that snob persons con
templating ooloniiation do notseem so willing
to emigrate to these oountciee as lo some
others, nor so willing as I think their interest
demands. I believe, however, that the opinion
Is Improving, and that ere long there will be
an augmented ana considerable emigration to
both these oouatries
Our relations with European States remain
undisturbed, and with the Stales of our conti
nent tbey have improved, especially Mexico,
Costa Rica, etc.
Tbe Presidont favors the projeot of the
Atlantio telegraph, and extending the Paolfio
line to connect with that being extecded across
tbe Russian Empire. He thicks tbe mineral
resources of our territories ought to be devol
oped aa rapidly aa possible. Every step In
that direction would bave a tendency to im
prove tbe revenues. It is worthv of serious
consideration, whether some extraordinary
measures to ptomote that end cannot be adoDt-
ed. The means which suggests Itself as mo;i
likely to be effsotive, la a scientific exploration.
The vast txpenditnres incident to tbe mili
tary aud naval operations required for the
suppression cf the rebellion, bave hitherto
been met with a promptitude aud certainty
uousual In similar eircumstenoes, and the pnb
Ho credit has been fully maintained. The
oontlnuanoe of the war, however, and the in
creased disbursements made necessary, de
mand your best reflections as to the best
modes of providing the necessary , revenue.
The snspenslon or speole payment by the
banks made large taeuea of United States
notes unavoidable. In no other way could tbe
payment of tbe troops and the satisfac'loa of
other jnet demands be so economically or as
well provided for.
It is extremely doubtful whether a oiroulatlon
of United States notes payable In ooin, aud suf
ficiently large for the wants of tbe people, oan
be permanently usefully and eifoly maintained.
Is there any other mode in which the necessary
provision for the publlo wants oan be made, and
the great advantages of a safe and uniform
currency seoured ? I know of none whleh prom
ises so certain results, and at the lame time so
unobjectionable, as the organization of banking
association under a general oot of Congress,
well guarded in its provisions. To euch aeso
dations the Government might furnish circu
lating notes on tbe eecurlty of United States
bonds deposited in tho Treasury. These notes,
Srepared under tbe supervision of proper offloe;-,
eing uniform in appearanoe and security, con
vertible always Into coin, would at onoe protect
labor against the evils of a vlolous eurrenoy,
and facilitate commerce by cheap and safe ex
ohacges. A moderate roserratlon from the In
terest on the bonds wonld compensate tbe United
States, for the preparation and distribution of
tbe notes, and a gener&l supervision of tbe sys
tem, and would lighten the burden of thai part
of tbe publlo debt employed as security. The
publio orodit, moreover, would be greatly Im-
iroved, and ttie negotiation of new loans great
y facilitated by the steady market demand for
Government bonds which the adoption of the
proposed system would create.
It lo an additional 'recommendation ot the
measure, of considerable weight, la my judg
ment, inai u wouiu reconcile as tar as panicle
all existing interests by tbe opportunity offered
to existing institutions to reorganise under tbe
act, substituting only tbe secored uniform Na
tional circulation for the looal and various cir
culation now Issued.
The President then gives a aummarv from
the Secretary of the Treasury's report, lie
refers to the reports of the Seoretariea of tbe
Navy and War, and aaye, though lengthy, they
arc onlv a brief abstract. He ears there is a de-
olded improvement in tbe financial oonditlon of
tbo roatcmce Department, compared with pre
ceding years. Tbe Secretary of the Interior
reports that the publlo lands have oeased to be
r source or revenue.
Speaking of Indian affair and reoent troubles.
ne sayei a suomii lor your speoiai consideration
whether our Indian system shall not be remod
led. He suggest the earliest completion of the
raoino rauroau; aieo laroraoie action bv Con-
Sess on projeot for enlarging tbe great oauals
New York, Illinois and Miohlgan.
The rreeident refer to His compensated
emancipation proclamation of September 9fld,
and says: That portion of tbe earth occupied
by the people of tbe United State Is well
adapted to be tbe home of one national family,
but not for two or more.
In tbe Inaugural addresa I brieflv pointed
ont the total Inadequacy of disunion as a rem
edy lor ainerenoes between the neon e o! tbe
two lections. I did so In language whloh I
cannot improve, rnysicaiiy ipeakiug, we oan
not separate; we oaonot remove onr respective
sections irom eacn otner, nor build an impass
able wall between them. He then remarks at
length on the difficulty of making any natloual
boundary line. , . i .
Tbe President then suggest amendments to
the Constitution: Congress concurring, to be
proposed to the Legislature or convention of
tbe several mates, wniob, ir ratified by threo
lourins oi saia jj-giaiaiures, to be valid as
part of laid Constitution. The first artiole
proposes that all State Rbollsbinir ilaverv ba.
fore January 1st; 1900, shall receive oompenv
(ation from the United States. 91. All slaves
freed by ohanoes of war any time before the
end of tbe rebellion, shall be forever free; but
au owners woo naa noi neen disloyal shall
be compensated. 3d. Congress may , ap
propriate money and otherwise provide
tor colonising free colored person, with their
oonsent, at any plaoe without the United State.
Tbo President discusses these artiole at
acme length, and aake, If then, for a common
object, dave property la to be laorifioed, la it oot
just It should be done at a common oharge?
and if with less money, or money more easily
paid, we can preterro the benefits of the Union
by this mean, than we can bv the war alone
la it not economical to do ltl The proposed
emancipation would shorten thla war, perpotU'
ate ponoe, insure Increase In pornlntion, and
proportiouaUil t' n wealth of tho country.
The President t n puje: The plan conslst-
lug oi loose article . i n eon 'necdel not but
that a restoration of thn n . ior;M authority
would be acoepted without It. adoption, nor will
tbe war or proceedings under the otoolamation
of September 22J, be etaiuJ totalise of tbo
recommendation of this plan, iu timely adopt
ion, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and
thereby stay both: and notwithstanding this
plan, tbe reoommendation that Congress pro
vide by law for compeneatlng any State which
may adopt the emancipation before this plan
shall have been acted npon. Is hereby earnestly
renewed.
Thia plan la recommended as a moans trot in
oonoiuaion of but additional tu all others for
restoring and preserving the national authority
throughout tbe Union. The subject is present
ed exclusively la it econimiaal aspeot. Tho
plan is proposed a permanent constitutional
law. ....
In conclusion, the President iava the dogmas
of tbe quiet past are inadequate to tbo stormy
present. The oocaalon is piled high wltb dim
eolty, and we must rise with the occasion, The
fiery trial through whlob we pass will
light us down In honor or dishonor to
tbe latest generation. We say that
we are for the Union. The world
will cot forget that while we say thia, we do
know bow to nave tbe Union. In giving free
dom to tbo slave, we inauro freedom to tbe
free bonorable alike in what we give and
wnai we preserve. We shall nobly save or
meanly lose the last beet hope of the earth.
Otber means mar eocoeed: thla could not fail.
One way la plain, peaceful, generous, lust a
way which, if followed, the world will forever
appiaua, and uod must forever bless."
