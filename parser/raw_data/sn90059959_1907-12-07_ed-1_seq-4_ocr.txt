What a sad spectacle is Goldwin
Smith in his beclouded old age! He is
looking for "a new dawn" with the
bright light shining all around him.
says the Newark, X. J.. Monitor.
Blinded by the fumes of his pride, his
aged eyes once in a while, but alas,
only once in a while, catch a glimpse
of the streaming light. He imagines
that it is the first faint streaks of "a
new dawn." -whereas the light of God's
glorious truth is shining in splendor
around about him but he alone is un
conscious of it. The darkness is his
own the intervals of light are the
flashings of truth through the mists
and the clouds. "What a pitiable fig
ure this old man, groping along and
muttering his despair and his blas
phemies! In his oride he will solve
the riddle, and in his own way. Does
it not seem as though he were resist
ing grace? How else can we explain
these exhibitions of feeling, this half
acceptance of the truth, these constant
changes and inconsistencies? At one
time he is almost plunged into black
infidelity at another, his hand seems
almost uplifted to knock at the door
of the Church. Let us suggest to the
aged historian that instead of giving
himself to bootless inquiry and vain
reasonings, he spend some time in
earnest prayer in all humanity before
Almighty God. And we hope and pray
that from it "a new dawn" may rise
for his much-tossed soul.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The one idea more prominent than
all others in the presidential message
is, more power to the centra! govern
ment. One cannot read the message
without becoming impressed with the
idea that Theodore Roosevelt is a firm
believer in a strong, centralized gov
ernment. He asks for the extension of
the federal power over subjects that
have heretofore been considered mere
ly matters of the state and in some
cases of the individual. There is in
the message no indication of a retreat.
Apparently he was apprehensive that
people might believe that our present
financial troubles had led him to
change his mind and to order a cessa
tion of hostilities against such male
factors, for in the second paragraph
of the message he begins to quote at
length from the radical declarations of
the. 1905 and 1906 messages, thus say
ing to the country, "so I said then, and
so I still say." He disclaims any re
sponsibility for present troubles in these
words: "The administration is re
sponsible for turning on the light, but
it is not responsible for what the light
showed." And in the very next sen
tence lie makes the demand that char
acterizes the whole message: "I ask
for full power to be given the federal
government, because no single state
can by legislation effectually cope with
these powerful corporations engaged
in interstate commerce."
The message covers a great variety
of subjects and is evidence of the great
activity of the man who wrote it. It
treats of subjects from the financial
question to woodpeckers.
He recommends an inheritance and
income lax. He dismisses the tariff with
a paragraph and, as heretofore, refuser
to commit himself to any positive plan
for revision. He submits no plan for
financial legislation but suggests one
or two as possible solutions of our
imperfect money system, which is
blame for some of the present diffi
culties, but it is observed that even
the wisest legislation cannot save peo
ple from their own extravagance.
Speculative folly and individual ex
travagance calls forth the following
statement:
"When an individual mortgages hl»
house to buy an automobile, he invite.'!
disaster, and when wealthy men, o»
men who pose as such, or are unscrup
ulously or foolishly eager to beconin
such. Indulge In reckless speculations,
especially if it is accompanied by dis
honesty, they jeopardize not only their
own future but. the future of all thei»'
innocent fellow citizens, for they dis
pose the whole business community to
panic and distress."
After recommending an Inheritance
tax and referring to the German law
which imposes an imperial tax on in
heritances and allotting a portion of
the tax to the several states of the
empire, he calls attention that such a
measure is not socialistic and makec
it plain in the following words that
he has no sympathy whatever with the
propaganda of socialism:
"We have ijot the slightest sympathy
with that socialistic idea which would
try to put laziness, thriftlessness, and
inefficiency on a par with industry,
thrift and efficiency which would
strive to break up not merely private
property, but what is far more im
portant, the home, the chief prop upon
which our whole civilization stands.
Such a theory if adopted -would mean
the ruin of the entire country. A ruin
which would bear heaviest upon the
weakest upon those least able to
shift for themselves. But proposals for
legislation such as this herein advo
cated are directly opposed to this class
of socialistic theories."
One of the most interesting recom
mendations made by the President is
that some automatic method of ad-
1
1
justing personal injury cases should be
devised. The great loss of life and
limb caused by the railway accidents
draws forth the observation that law
suits provide an inadequate remedy
for the personal injuries, and the Pres
ident says that, "the law should be
made such that the payment for acci
dents by the employer would be auto
matic instead of being a matter of law
suits. Workmen should receive certain
'and definite compensation for all acci
dents in industry irrespective of negli
gence." This appears at first thought
to be extremely radical, but after all
there is a great deal of merit in the
contents. "The employer is the agent
of the people and on his own respon
sibility and for his own benefit he
serves the public. When he starts a
motion and agencies which create risks
for others, he should take all the or
dinary and extraordinary risks in
volved, and the risk he thus at the mo
ment assumes, will ultimately be as
sumed, as it ought to be, by the gen
era! public. Only in this way can the
shock of the accident be diffused in
stead of falling upon the man or
woman who is least able to bear it."
The President means, evidently, that
the employers should assume liability
for all accidents to their workers, ex
cluding presumably willful destruction
of limb or life, and that the product of
the industry should be sold at a. price
to enable the employer to pay the dam
age, thus shifting the load upon the
general public. If there is a practical
way of fixing the liability and the
amount of damages, such a method
would certainly relieve poor litigants
of great trouble and expense and take
away from our courts, and incidentally
from lawyers, a very considerable por
tion of the work that they are now
called upon to do.
The message ought to be very gen
erally read. It contains a great deal
of information and the person who
starts to read it will find it interesting
enough to call for its complete perusal.
Forestry, public grazing lands, mining,
the Panama canal, public waterways,
agriculture, irrigation, postal savings
banks, Alaska, the army and the navy
are all treated in a very interesting
manner. More information can be
gathered by reading the paragraphs
connected with any one of those sub
jects than can be obtained by a well
studied and well prepared magazine
article.
THE NEW CONGRESS,
The opening of the Sixtieth Con
gress of the United States was free
from any unusual events. It was
marked by fewer changes than Is usual
when a. new Congress convenes. The
Congress that has just assembled is
one elected in an off year. The major
ity of the members of both houses be
long to the political party to which
the President belongs, and the major-
ity in each house is ruled by the
friends of the President. There is no
quarrel between the Houses or be
tween the Congress and the Execu
tive. The Speaker of the last Con
gress was re-elected without a struggle
ami it Is safe to say that the com
mittees will continue about the same
as in the last Congress. The leaders
in the last Congress have been re
turned. Both the Republican and
Democratic parties will be led by the
same men who led in the last Con
gress.
The only remarkable incidents con
nected with the assembling of the
House of Representatives was the ova
tion given to William J. Bryan when
he appeared upon the floor, and the
attack made upon the rules of the
House by Representative Cooper, a
Republican member from Wisconsin.
Representative Cooper made a plea for
the return of the power to the House
that, has in late years been exercised
by the Speaker. This attack upon the
rules of the House recalls what a
change has taken place In the House
of Representatives in the last twenty
years. Before Speaker Reed's time.
Individual members had much more
power than they have at the present
time. Much more of the business of
the House was transacted by the House
and less by the committees and the
Speaker. More freedom was given in
debate. Under the present rules, no
matter -what. a. member's ability may
be, he has vet-y little chance for ac
complishing anything unless he enjoys
the confidence of the Speaker. Repre
sentative Cooper spoke from experience
when he attacked the rules. Way back
in the days when Tom Reed was
Speaker, Cooper was asked to support
a certain measure and refused, and it
is said that Reed never again recog
nized the man from Wisconsin.
In the Senate the greatest change
was occasioned by the admission of
Oklahoma, thus adding two more mem
bers and taking away from the Re
publicans the two-thirds majority
which they have had for some time.
There were a few new senators, but
no commanding figure entered the
Senate for the first titrie. Colorado
sent Gugenheim, whose only recom
mendation is copper. Wisconsin sent
Stephenson, who would have been un
known except for lumber. It cannot
be said that the personnel of the Sen
ate is Improved. The South alone haa
able representatives. The great- Em
pire State continues to be represented
by two old and discredited men. The

sin is replaced by a man, old in years
and unfitted by education, training or
I experience for legislative duties. The
majority in the Senate is
in danger of being left without men
of brains to lead it So many «f the
states in the North have been using
Senatorship to pay men who made
large contributions to political cam
paigns, that there remain few states
men on the Republican side in the
Senate. Senator Foraker of Ohio is
about the only one of the really able
men left. Senator Allison of Iowa is
still there, but his ape is against him.
Other Republican senators who have
gained any reputation at all, such as
Aldrich of Rhode Island, are in the
Senate because they represent some
particular interest and they sit in the
United States Senate very much as a
lawyer sits in a law suit, to protect
the interests of their clients. The Sen
ate of the United States on the Re
publican side is bad!v in need of a few
statesmen.
A JURY'S VERDICT.
Mrs. Bradley has been declared by
a jury not guilty of murder. It was
not denied that she killed a human be
ing. The law furnished a fiction by
which she might escape. The real
reason she was acquitted is that the
jury refused to punish her because of
the character of the man she killed.
Some excuse had to be furnished in
order to allow her to go unpunished.
The character of tha deceased is not
such a legal excuse, therefore it -was
claimed that she was insane, and doc
tors were readily found to testify to
jthat fact. Rules of evidence permitted
I such testimony. Rules of law per
mitted that testimony to go to the
jury, and the elasticity of the con
science permitted the jury to find the
I defendant not guilty. It Is more than
probable that the attorneys who pro
pounded the question to the medical
I gentlemen who testified, and the doc
tors who answered the hypothetical
questions, and the Court who instruct
ed the jury, and the jury who rendered
the verdict, all knew that Mrs. Brad
ley was not insane. It is an applica
tion of the "unwritten law" that we
have read so much about recently. The
whole thing is a lie Mrs. Bradley ia
guilty of murder, but no jury could be
found that -would consent to punish
her for killing sucli a creature as
Brown. So she is turned loose, and no
one seems to fear that her insanity
will cause her to kill other men. It is
not probable that she will be sent to
an Insane asylum. Her Insanity was
that convenient kind—temporary—just
sufficient to furnish the excuse.
BRYAN AND "O'BRIEN."
Mr. Bryan has a peculiarly happy
way of expressing himself. He never
lacks for words to explain his mean
ing ajid he is never at a. loss for a
parallel or an illustration. This is one
reason why he is so wonderfully pop
ular as a public speaker. His hearers
never have to study to follow his
meaning or to pinch themselves Into
attention. Not long ago Mr. Bryan
compared the elephant and the donkey,
used by cartoonists as the emblems of
the Republican and Democratic par
ties, and he made the donkey appear
In a. very favorable light. He pointed
out the fact that the elephant was in
digenous to only one hemisphere and
to only one climate, while the don
key existed wherever civilized man
lived that the elephant, although
known for centuries, has never done
any considerable portion of the world's
work, while the donkey has always
been a burden bearer and that the
elephant was only a dress parade ani
mal, while the donkey was the every
day servant of men. It was a good
comparison and characteristic of Mr.
Bryan.
Last Tuesday while a party of Min
neapolitans were in the marble room
of the United States senate, included
in which were Mr. and Mrs. T. D.
O'Brien and their daughter, Miss Nel
lie, William ,r. Bryan and Senator
Teller dropped in. It was Mr. Bryan's
pleasure to know a number of those
present, from this state and he was
soon introduced to all- Following the
introduction to the young lady a sug
gestion occurred to Mr. Bryan of one
of the. comparisons he always delights
to make.
"You see," he said to Miss O'Brien,
"In the old gap they all spelled the
name as I now spell mine, but finally
there arose a great man among the
Bryans, and he was made king. Where
upon, in order to distinguish his des
cendants from the plebeian members
of the clan, the letter "O" was at
tached to the name by way of pre
fix. This prefix has been retained by
all the descendants of that branch of
the family to this day to show their
illustrious ancestry. The common peo
ple of the clan, however, have contin
ued to spell the name in the good old
way."
"That is a very interesting story,"
replied Miss Nellie, "and prompts me
to say that the day will no doubt
come when your descendants also will
be calling themselves O'Brien."
The story of the meeting was first
related in a Washington special to the
Evening Journal of this city on Tues
day last, with the added statement
that the commoner bowed his best bow
in recognition of the very handsome
compliment.
There are some professed friends in
Ireland, in this country and elsewhere
who do not look with favor upon the
fact that the Irish Parliamentary party
is again united.
I George F. Porter, a prominent lawyer
and business man of this city, died at
the Paxton hotel, Omaha, Friday, Nov.
29, of heart disease. He was but 39
years of age at the time of his de
mise.
The law in New York state providing
that no male child uader 12 years or fe
male under 16 years shall sell newspa
pers on the streets is a good one. Min
nesota ought to have a similar law.
Election of Officers,

from the younger element. T. J. Doyle,
