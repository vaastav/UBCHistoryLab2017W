I'm: Memphis Ledger comes out square
ly and unequivocally for a more liberal
system of frco schools. Wo think that
there is no doubt of the fact that tho Leg
islature which meets next month will give
us such a law. Enlightened public opin
ion demands it.
Tin: President's message was transmit
ted to New York, Philadelphia and Balti
more in about forty-live minutes, which is
tho shortest time ever attained with to long
n document. Twelve wires wero used, and
tho weather was favorable for working
purposes. There were 11,330 words in the
message.
Hon. WahdHum", of Utica, New York,
elected a few years since Justice of the
Court of Appeals of the State, has been
nominated by tho President for Justice of
tho Supreme Court, in placo of Justice
Nelson, retired. Tho nominee is said to be
st man of irreproachable character and un
questioned legal ability.
The President, in his letter accepting
Gen. Horace Porter's resignation as an
officer of tho U. f. A. and Privato Secreta
ry, pays him a high compliment for his
services in war and peace. Gen. Porter
takes ohargo of tho entire business of tho
Pullman Car Compauy. It is a responsi
ble position and wo hope muy provo profit
able, as wo know it will, laborious.
K lkv ono who has any regard for tho
high social position which tho .United
States holds among the .nations of the
world, will endorse that part of the Presi
dent's Message which relates to the Mor
mons. Polygamy is an institution so mon
strous, that enlightened Christian people
must sutler lostt of respect in the oyes of a
civilized world, while it is oven permitted.
We would not favor the adoption of rash
measures such as might bring about un
necessary shedding of blood, but the whole
ountry w'll endorse a policy looking to
the extinguishment of Mormon polygamy.
Inn Memphis Appeal is in a good way.
It i-annot sleep, for a "war of races" is al
ways llagraut in ita vivid imagination. It
-ays that "whenever tho negro attempts to
force himself, under the protection of an
infamous law, into the dining-room of the
I'eabody and Overton Hotels, nnd into tho
-leeplng-cars. occupied by our wives and
daughters, that moment" What do you
-appose, reader? Blood knee deep the
land over'.' No! "That moment," says
the Appeal, "will there bo an intense
hatred towards tho negro, and the strifes,
which tho whole country desires to be
burled, will bo renewed." Tho Apcal
has our sincere sympathies. Wo are en
tirely satisfied that unless speedy and
Htringent legislation prevents it some
plantation woman of color will yet niarry
the Appeal editor.
Wk are glad to see that a bill was
promptly introduced into tho Houso (by
Mr Harris, of Virginia), providing for a
modification of the tobacco tax law as it
now exists. It coutalns odious If not un
just features, of which it should be divert
ed. It is au Inconvenlenco and a hard
ship to ,iay to small planters that they
shall not sell their productions, even in
small quantities to a neighbor, without in
curring a penalty for the violation of the
Jaw applying to retail dealers in tobacco.
A great deal was said about this law dur
ing the late campaign. Those who agitat
ed the question then, did It for political ef
fort. The people knew this and preferred
to leave the matter to a senso of justice on
tho part of Congress, rather than to com
mit their interests into the bauds of those
m whom thoy hail no confidence. We aro
satisfied that' they decided correctly and
that Consrej will do what 'Is right and
just.
MOURNINO FOB THE ED1T0K AND CITIZEN,
Horace Greeley was fortunate hi his
death. He could not havo passed away at
any earlier hour of his life and havo had a
whole' nation to stand mourning at his
open grave. It is not alone tho sad cir
cumstances of his death that provoke the
universal grief that is manifested lu every
section and State of our extended republic.
His last Bad hours were well calculated to
soften the animosities of his political oppo
nents. They bridged over the temporary
chasm that separated him from life-long
friends and over it they passed in
multitudes to express at his grave
the love and admiration they bear for his
unselfish, effective and unceasing battles
for the good of mankind. Blotting out
the unfortunate history of the past ten
mouths, tho American people mourn to
day for Horace Greeley as Editor and Citi
zen. The tears that fill millions of eyes
come forth in remembrauco of the great
work he has done for mankind in the pow
erful journal ho founded and built. He
was always tho friend of the oppressed
aud tho poor, and though in his great life
work, in the zeal ho threw into his labors,
he offended many by tho force and aggres
siveness of his writing and speaking, he
has weeping friends to-day in every creed,
race or nativity in the land.
From the Executive Mansion at Wash
ington, from the halls of Congress, from
the pulpit, from the courts of justice, from
the busy marts of trade, go the best and
most honored of the nation to do honor to
the great journalist. The noisy, bustling
streets of the metropolis of this continent
arc almost hushed in presence of the sor
rowful throng that gather to bear testi
mony to the worth of the philanthropist.
What a popular verdict of the power aud
influence of the press! What striking
proof that Horace Greeley, as editor, was
immeasurably greater and nobler than-
Horace Greeley as the candidate for Presi
dent. In tho latter character he arrayed
against him, and justly too,tho friends of a
life time, men who had battled by his side,
with all the fervor and untiring zeal of re
formers, in many a hard fought campaign
against oppression aud wrong. But to-day
charity covers tlieerrorsof his laterdaysand
lu tho memory of old associations, for the
great work of a noble life, for the sake of
the good that he has done, a great people
grieve for tho death of tho philanthropist
and journalist. In the past decade tho na
tion has mourned over the fall of many of
our great men and tho people have wept
over the grave of many patriots, but thcro
have been but few of them whose names
were more familiar or whose death has
awakened moro general sorrow.
THE CONDITIO!? OF OUR "WORKING CLASS,
If there is any one feature in our condi
tion as a people, upou which we ought to
congratulate ourselves above another, if is
tli condition of our working class as com
pared with the working classes of every
other country in tho world. There is less
of poverty and all its attendant evils
among our working classes, than among
any other working people in the civilized
world. England boasts of her wealth her
inexliaustiblo capital her civilization, but
there capital holds arbitrary sway over a
large portion of her population, and keeps
them in absolute subjection. Poverty,
want, disease and death are the constant
companions of the working thousands in
England. Low wages and uusteady em
ployment is the prime cause of their de
plorable condition, aud yet their misery
adds to this wealth, this capital, to which
they aro abject slaves. We presume that
few people in this country have any ade
quate Idea of the suflerings of the English
working classes. .Thomas Wright, tho
"Journeyman Engineer," published an
article fcome time since in an English peri
odical, on the condition of the working
classes in Eugland, which abounds in de
tails of the most sickening character. We
present an extract:
"Tho home life of a vnt nurabcrof tho work
ing classes is something 'u thing to shudder
nt, not to fee.' It is a life that puts decency,
morality, and religion, ns well as physical
health and comfort, out of tho question : that
so degrades nnd brutnlizes those condemned to
it that they live ns well as dio liko tho beasts
that perish. Indeed, as a literal fact, tho poor
or members of tho working classes often fare
worso than tho boosts of tho field. In every
requisito of health thoir dwolling aro inferior
to most stables ; wo havo scon piggeries in com
parison with which tho same might bo said of
them ; and any master of for hounds would bo
indignant if ho were asked to kennel his hounds
in such foul dons for n singlo night; whilonny
mastor of hounds or owner of horses, who fed
his animals ns scanty as some of tho poor aro
fod would bo in danger of prosecution by tho
society for the prevention of cruelty to ani
mals." Tho writer then proceeds to givo fads re
lative to the crowded and unhealthy con
dition of the miserable tenements where a
largo number of tho working classes lan
guish out a mlserublo existence, and un
folds an almostfabulous story, when taken
into consideration that all this exists in a
country that boasta of its civilization. Wo
might extend these quotations, but have
neither space nor Inclination to do so.
How different with the working jKrople
of tho United States? Here, every man
who is willing to work and is able to do
bo, can almost invariably find employ
ment at fair wages. Tho employment of
working men is. reasonably steady not
subject to spasmodic suspension and
revival of business merely to suit tho eon
veniodce of some arbitrary capitalists.
Our workingnicn.uijualh; occupycpmfort-.
nolo residences and thousands of them aro
as well clad as the manjSf capital or tho pro
fessional man. Who does not rejoice that
such is tho fact! Show us a man who
would so regulate business and social af
fairs that a mcchanleshallbedlstlugulshcd
wherever ho Is seen by tho garb he wears,
and wo will show you one who would
change our form of Government fo an arlB
istocracy We rejoice that tho condition
of American workingmen is such as it is,
and trust that it may improve. We ic
joico that the workingmen have such ex
amples as Franklin, Wilson, Greeley, Bur-
ril'tj aud a host of others, to encourage
them in aspiring to wealth and dlstlnc
tlon. We trust that the financial affairs of
this country will bo so managed, that
wages may always bo reasonable, and that
workingmen will not only live comfort
ably, but that facilities will continue to
bo afforded them for, educating their off
spring, nnd laying up in the prlmo of llfo
enough of the world's goods to keep them
comfortable in old age.
COMMENTS ON THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho comments of the nress on tho Prnsl-
dent's mefsago arc on the whole very
favorable.
The New York 2'imcs savs. nolhinc
could be more plain or business-like and
that not in twenty years has a President
been able to lay before the people a more
gratifying public exhibit.
The Herald find.) pronounces it a irood
message and a valuable State paper, brim
ming over with all the vast and multifa
rious concerns of the country at home and
abroad. ,
The Tribune- ttud.t declares that it is a
plain, business document, pressing some
miscnievous old plans and presenting some
good now ones.
The Sun (Bern.) thinks it coinnion-nlare
and conspicuously encouraging every
measure looking towards centralization.
Ihe II orM (Dem. i thinks the messaire
does not show the President far-sighted.
It pronounces his recommendations as
gatiienng up the tail ends of spent mies-
tions."
The Philadelphia Press savs : No words
of ours need be added in praise of the
message, which is simply a calm review of
tue nation's History In the last year, and a
clear statement of its necessities in the
next from the President's standpoint.
The Missouri Democrat savs : It is
plain, straightforward, business-like pa
per, comprehensive in its scope, and going
sufficiently into detail to convince the peo
ple of tho nation that President Grant is
au honest, faithful aud pains-taking guad-
lan of tho public interests.
The Chicago Intcr-Occan savs of it : It
is marked by that straightforwardness of
statement wiiicli lias characterized all the
messages and public acts of President
Grant, and adds to his reputation as a cnu-
tious, shrewd, far-seeing statesman, who
gains strength as he gains experience, and
giving promise of entering upon his second
term with deservedly largely increased
popularity among all classes of the peo-

DEATH,.0F MRS, ANNA It, FLEMING.
Wohnnotineo with sincere sorrow this
morning tho death of Mrs. Anna H. Flem
ing, wife-of Hon. John M. Fleming, editor
of our contemporary, tho Press and
Herald, which sad event occurred Satur
day nfter'noon at 4 o'clock. Though not
unexpected to tho relatives of tho deceased,
tho newB.wlll bo sad to her many friends
who havo knoVvn her, frbm childhood.
Wo extond Our warmest 'sympathy to the
aflllctedihusband;ln his bereavement and
assure him that tho community, ono and
all, share his sorrows, for but few havo
grown to womanhood in Knoxvillc who
had moro friends than Anna Fleming.
Anna Howard Fleming yrua tho fiftl
daughter of Hon. Samuol Boyd aud was
born in Alabama on tho 1st day of July,
1840. Of a cheerful spirit, always pleasant
and attractive and possessed of remarkable
beauty, she was from her chllhood a
great favorite. As a young lady
she was remarkably fascinating in her
manners, aud by reason of her beauty
was universally conceded to bo tho belle
of the city. She was fortunato in having
several sisters of great worth and similar
high social endowments, so that her
mother's home for years was tho center of
attraction for a large clrclo of admiring
friends.
She was married to Mr. Fleming in May,
18C0. He was then ii practicing Attorney
in this city. The fruits of this marriage
wero five children, ono of whom died
a few months ago. A babe of about
four months survives her. She was an
affectionate mother, ever watchful of her
children, to whom sho was most thor
oughly devoted. Though engrossed in
her domestic duties, she still preserved
the friendships of earlier years, and
was always a bright and welcome visitor
in many households.
Her life went out peacefully and calmly
as the bark glides into tho placid stream.
Conscious to the last, recognizing every
dear one about her, calmly giving direc
tions as to her children as though prepar
ing for a journey,, her spirit took its ilight
for tho brighter world where she was to
meet near and dear ones who had gone
before her. For long months sho has been
a patient sufferer, but through it all was
cheerful and happy for sho had the con
stant attention and tender caro of her
husband, who, though suffering from an
accident that befell him last Summer, was
ever by her couch anticipating every want
that the tendcre3t solicitude could suggest.
iVnd. thus surrounded by husband, and
children, mother, sisters and brothers, in
full possession of her faculties with tho
spirit land opening bright before her, her
soui 100 k us upward nignt.
SOMETHING ABOUT NEWSPAPERS
At tho late meeting of tho Press Associa
tion of tliis State, held in Chattanooga,
Ira P. Jones, Esq., an old publisher, de
livered au address which contained some
truths in which the public are interested.
In reference to the many calls made upon
newspapers for gratuitous advertlsng, he
says: "o do too much work without
compensation. We pay out too much
money without any return whatever. Wo
establish an eleemosynary institution at
our own expense. Wo keep a charity
school on our own . hook. We conduct
business as if we owo everything to the
public, and the public are not indebted to
us a farthing. SVe aro preyed upon by the
sharpers' and tho innocent alike. We ncZ
vcrtiscgratuitoxtsly. every week, when wo
should havo the money for-it. Tho gene
ral public are entirely Ignorant probably
we ourselves are not fully aware of tho ex
tent to which newspapers aro burdened by
this insiduous drain upon their resources.
It insinuates itself in every conceivablo
form. It does it through reporters,
through agents, through correspondents,
through editors, through business man
agers, through proprietors, and generally
too with as much disadvantage to the pub
lic as to the press. Thcro is not a business,
from the dispenser of gingercakes' and ci
der to the largest manufactory, which will
not advertise with you gratis which will
not if you listen to it, endeavor to convlnco
you that it is your duty to the public to
do so. There is not an aspirant for public
station and when I contemplate the num
ber of these, I experience an overwhelm
ing senso of commingled amazement aud
disgust from Constable to tho Senate of
tho Union, who does not consciensclously
beliove it to be tho imperative duty of tlio
press, daily and weekly, to speak, with a
pen of telescope power of his microscopic
deservings."
Tho distinction the press should make
In tho cases above referred to is, that iu all
matters where commendation or notice of
the undertaking seeking attention will
prove of greater profit to tho person or cor
poration interested in it than to tho public
tho paper should demand pay for tho ser
vice rendered.
In connection with this subject wo have
some things wo wish to say in connection
with the press mid business interests of
Kuoxville, which will reserve for another
occasiou when ho havo more space to de
vote 10 u man wo navo ims morn tug.

Tcnnesseo stands to-dny'beforo tile peo
ple of this country as tho, most promisi ng
of the Southern Slates. Her vast unde
veloped mineral wealth has been widely
discussed and Is everywhere conceded. Wo

people has paralyzed her industrial Inter

our prosperity might bo in tho future, but
who feared it might bo long coming. But
since the fell spirit of Bourbonism
was driven out at the last elec
tion tho clouds have cleared away and
wo aro greatly encouraged to bollevo they
will nover again darken our prospects. Af
a people wo have thrown oil" tho poison--ous
political malaria aud we stand to-day
stronger, moro hopeful, than even Very
few of our readers, perhaps, realize the im'
portanco of this change, but wo aro in a po
sition to see it and appreciate it every day.
Our exchanges, tho wholo country over,
speak moro kindly and favorably of our
people. They seo a cliango hns taken
place and they comment upon it as hope
ful of our future. Peoplo who havo been
looking here for homes but who havo been
waiting for assurances for the future, now
feel moro determined to cast their Jot with
us. Tho ChkonicIjE's articles about East
Tennessee are read with renewed
interest as was stated iu tlio letter publish
ed yesterday from Now York. We received
during tho last half of November and thus
far in December four letters from the
North, subscribing for our Weekly and.
enquiring nbout our lands and climate, to
whero we received ono during tho late
political campaign. There aro three times,
as many strangers in East Tennessee pros
pecting for homes as thcro were before the
election. All this is encouraging and wt
are glad to report It.
But there is, one danger we must now
avoid. These people who aro looking for
homes in East Tcnnesseo know the value
of lands and they will not pay fancy
prices. Wo want to seo our people get fair
prices for their farms and know enough of
human nature to know they will ask it.
ButW0 know. too. of men. lnrrr InmU
holders.whoadvance their price every time
a stranger comes in sight of their farms.
This is not onlvnot business liko. but. If. la
absolutely suicidal., Every sensible man
1 . - .
khow s we nave too much idle land, and
if wo could forco it to bo sold nt fWifl
it would not only bo better for tho public,
nut it would be far better for tho owner.
There aro men about Knoxvillc and otlinr
points in East Tennessee who havo held
real estate for fifty years, waiting foe high
prices, such as thev mli?ht xnprf irhi
city had forty thousand, people, or East
iennessee nad a million. They would wait
fifty years loncer for such nricos if
body would pursuo their policy. Tho
time for us to grow it here. Tho time for
our population and our industries to mul
tiply is at hand, jiroi'ded wo act liko sensi
ble people. The farmer does not harvest
unless ho sows ; and we can nob prosper
unless wo encourage immigration by offer
ing our land at reasonablo prices. Public
sentiment can do much in this mat
ter. We know of men going away
from East Tennessee because thev nro
driven away by liich prices. Wo know
tho valuoof land and we know the prices
uemaiKicu irom them aro too high and
more than would be asked of neie-hhnrn.
Now, if our peoplo can not see that such a
courso is ruinous and wrong, wo have not
yet passed the point whero wo beiri 11 tho
onward march. If we improve the oppor
tunity now ollered, East Tennessee will
increase its population this winter by
thousands and lay tho foundation for a
prosperity as great as any predicted iu
these columns.
