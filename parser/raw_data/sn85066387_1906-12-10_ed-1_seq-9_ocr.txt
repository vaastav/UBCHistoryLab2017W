EDITED BY
The Jurisdictional dispute between
the International Brewery . Workers'
Union and the firemen and engineers
is as fw from settlement as ever, not
withstanding the action of the recent
Minneapolis convention of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor. The ruling
of the federation that the Brewery
Workers should recognize cards of en
gineers md firemen employed in brew
erlee is one that ,is likely to cause
trouble. The Brewery Workers declare
that they .will not stand by the de
cision and that any attempt to force
them to do so will bring on a bitter
fight. ~The talk about a beer famine
may become a reality." declared . a
brewery worker the other day. ' "We
•hall insist that the priority of the
charter grafted us in 18S€ be recog
nized and that no notice shall be taken
of the chfirter granted to engineers
and: firemen employed In breweries in
IES7." The brewery workmen believe
«J1 employes of a brewery should be
under the Jurisdiction of their organ
ization.

• The Sonora, Railroad, which is ' the
southern extension of the Southern
Pacific system from Nogales, Ariz., to
Guayass, state of Sonora, Mexico, is
tied up as a. result of a strike, which
had as Its object the release of an en
gineer held a-t Hermosillo on a charge
of manslaughter. The prisoner ran a
passenger train which killed a Yaqul
Indian while the latter was walking
on. the track. At the preliminary hear
ing the engineer was hew for trial in
default of 55000 ball. By preconcerted
arrangement all trains were pulled
into Hermosillo and abandoned by the
crews, which refused to move any
train until the engineer -was released.
No trainmen can be Induced to cross
the line from Nogales to help break
the strike. American Consul Wood of
Nogales and Vice Consul Hostettor of
Hermosillo are working on the matter.
Washington and the City of Mexico
have been consulted.
