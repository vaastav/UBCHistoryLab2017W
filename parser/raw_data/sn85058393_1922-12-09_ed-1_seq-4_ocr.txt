I PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE.
President Harding, a day or (wu
late, presented his message to con
press on Friday. If his delay brought
' forth his declaration on law enforce
ment, the extra lime was well de
voted. Perhaps the moat Important an
notineument conveyed was that of a re
solve on tho part of the presldenl to
; command respect for the prohibition
nieaaure. The enforcing of a consti
tutional amendment Is a duty which
cannot be ignored without creating a
klegree of contempt for our funda
mental law. Our president giVes cvl-
I deuce, of starting a campaign which
will end the liquor scandals. He has
planned to call tho governd s of the
litates in conference to form i late defi
nite policies of national and state co
'opcration In a crusade against Uic
"bootleggers. The wholo country will
icndorso this move as being essential
I no the vigorous prosecution of those
Who traffic In liquor. At the very be
ginning of prohibition there should
lhave been B close co-operation be
tween the federal and state authori
ties. Here in Utah neither the stato
inor federal officers li;i been effec
tive and a lack of united effort Is
plainly In- evidence. The larger clt
I es are left to work out tho problem
by their own methods when much bi
her results could be obtained if the
touteldo forces were so directed as to
ihe a constant check on the police.
There la no doubt as to what the
.people want. They insist on the
strongest possible enforcement of tho
haw so that a real test may be made
of prohibition. Even where the aw
us most Ignored, and thai is in the
larger cities, tho solid, substantial
home builders are insisting on a. more
(determined line of action in proof of
the good prohibition can do
There Is much in the message of
unusual interest to the American peo
l tple. Any one of the following recom
mendatltons could be made the sub
bed of an extended editorial:
Registration of aliens.
More rigid examinations of r-migrants
at embarkation porta.
Federal assistance, in the educa
tion of aliens.
A constitutional amendment
giving congress authority over
child labor.
A constitutional amtnument re
stricting tho Issue of tax exempt
securities by ihe federal govern
ment, the states, municipalities
and counties.
A study by congress of the wide
spread between production costs
and price to consumers.
The survey of a plan to draft
all the resources of the nation,
human and material, for national
defense.
A fostering interest by the na
tional government in constructive
measures calculated to promote
' tho unification of steam, water
and electric powers in the eastern
industrial region.
Favorable consideration of re
clamation and irrigation projects
where waste land may be made
available for settlement productivity.
Co-operation between tho feder-
j si government, the various states
J and the owners of forest lands to
I the end that protection from fire
should bo made more effective.

The country will approve of tho
registration of aliens and a more rigid
examination of emigrants l ports of
embarkation.
The president's reference to rural
credits and agricultural rolief will be
highly pleasing to tho west. Tho ear
ning out of this policy would do much
to help rebuild the fortunes of tho
farmers, who must bo eared for be
foro prosperity Is on a permanent and
solid basis.
President Harding's appeal should
havo much Influence on tho farm bloc
and evon serve to quiet the progres
sives of the LaFollette type.
Reference to the hlsh freight rates
Is timely, but how lower rates are to
be brought about is not disclosed.
The president's messaso is on of
the most stimulating over presented
to congress.
UU
ASTORIA'S
BIG FIRE.
Sweeping through the business dis
trict and out through' the residential
area, a fire of incendiary origin did
? 15,000,000 damage to Astoria, tho old
est city In Oregon.
Thero are two features to the con
flagration which hold our attention.
One is that a fire of such proportion1?
could not occur In Ogden except under
most extreme conditions. Our w ld
streets and hollow blocks in the busi
ness district give tho firemen a great
adrantage In battling flames and.
only in a strong mountain wind, could
a blaze gain such headway as to gt
beyond control. Kden. lor a period
of years, has had small fire losses.
The other point in Astoria's disas
ter which Is of more than passing in
terest to Ogden is the charge of In
cendiarism and the directlong of tho
accusing finger at the radicals. In the
northwest there has been a growing
restlessness which has been manifest
ed by organized bodies of the discon
tented. Sabotage has been practiced
and other offenses 'icainbt law and
order havo been committed. If this
lawlessness has reached the Ht;U'- pi
burning down cities, there must be ap
plied to the disease a drastic remedy.
That which breaks down, without
thought of building to better purporo.
Is a crime against the laws of self
preservation and should be dealt with
in a most effective way Th north
west soon must dean house, or thero
will be more fires.
YOU OWN THEM ?
Remember those war savings
s;amps and n rtiticatos ihat you
jbought in 1918? Better bunt them up.
They are "duo" January 1. principal
i and interest And Uncle Sam's ready
to pay them otf. or trade them for
new certlficaiea at 4 per cent interest
'compounded twice a year, whichever
'you want.
I Treasury officials estimate that no
less than 15,000,000 Americans own
these war obligations. Aro you one of 1
them? If so, when you "cash In" you
will realize that tho safest inrestment
In the world is Uncle Sam. Hundreds
of thousands of spendthrift? and stock
market suckers are wishing they had
' invested In war savings stamps and
i certificates.
A million doesn't look as big as it
used to. Host of us talk of a million
as If It were a dozen eggs. Neverthe
less, you will admit that $625,000,000
lis considerable of a figure.
That Is the total value of the w.?
(savings stamps and certificates matur
ing January 1, 132.T. If everyone in
islsts on cash payment. Uncle Sam will
havo to turn a few financial hand-:
springs. His loose cash in tho nation
al treasury will be rather low at the j
end of the year.
So he hopes that most of the hold
era half, at least will trado for the
new five-year treasury certificates.
Wise Investors will. It's as good as
money in th? bank some ways, bet
ter. If you want to cash our war sav
ings stamps and certilicaies In full,
you can deposit them with tho postof
flce any day now, for collection, or
turn them in to your bank on or after
January 1.
If you have, say, 25 of maturing
war savings certificates, you can ex
change thom for a new $25 treasury
certificates maturing January 1, 1923,
and get S4-50 caah to boot. And so on,
in iarge quantities.
The new certificates will bo Issued
La. nominations of $25, $100 and
&10M each. No Individual can get
more than $5000 worth of these certifi
cates. They are tax-exempt, by the
way.
In this deal, which involves $625,
000,000, Uncle Sam is doing business
with the people. You, the owner of
certificates, are one of his bankors.
He says to telj you that he would
prefer extending the loan. But he can
hand over the caBh if you feel you
need It more than he does. U. S., you
know, means "us."

GREAT TOTAIjS REAOHED
The total assets of all American life
Insurance companies at the end of

The net increase in their assets dorhiK

Clench st.it (j that more than half of

in meeting the demand for additional

in the Cnlted States
The outstanding city and farm mort-
gage holdings of the life Insurance
companies are now far ahead of their
inve.Mtmnt In roUroad securities. At
the pnd of 1111, the speaker saidi the
railroad securities held by approxi
mately the name companies amounted
to $1,383,000,000. or 3o Vi per cent of

The $350,000,000 that was so invest

CLUB WOMEN WOULD MAKE SPANKING A (3

N 1 Bervloe Starf Writer.
NEW YORK. Have, parents an ln
herent right to punlHh their children?
"They have," decides Justice Salmon
of thf court of special sesplons.
' They haven't," retorts the AWlanf
of Women's clubs of Brooklyn, "and
If Justice Salmon's decision gives par
ents a lKnl right to Inflict corporal
punishment, wo women are going to
!-ee that such 8 medieval law Is wipcJ
'from' the statute books."
Thus the hands that rock the Brook
lyn cradles have decided tho rod must
be spared.
If necessary, the 4S associated wom
en's clubs with their io.ooo members
who have already taken official ac
tion on Justice Salmon's decision are
I ready to carry the matter to the State
(Federation of Women's clubs and
make corporal punishment a campaign
I issue.
WHY cir. SfrjSn go
These are the r apons why corporal
punishment must go, according to Mrs.
R. C Talbot Perkins, president of the
lAlllonee uf Women's clubs ot Brook
lyn: One: Because corporal punishment
It brutal, I relic of the dork ages, en
tirely out of harmony with humani
tarian principles.
Two: Because it makes children
of 1020 and 17.80 per cent, the high
mark set In 101u. This jump of 1 28
per cent in the ratio of policy loans
and notes to reserves last year In the
largest In any JHSI" since the increase
of 1 . 4 1; per cent In 1908, which had
followed the still larcer inTcrujc of
2.39 per cent in 1907.
"Investments In storks and bonds In
creased by nearly J92.000.000 during
1921. notwithstanding a decrease of
$23.00.000 in the amount Invewted In
railroad securities. The gain In stocks
and bonds was the result of the In
creased Investments In government,
state and municipal securities. Dur
ing the first ten months of 1922. how
ever, there appears to bo a dlstlm t
revival of lnterept In r.vliroad obliga

a decrease during 1921 of $28.G0).

"That the railroads of the country
