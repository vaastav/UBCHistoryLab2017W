That the Individual who is really

pect many "knocks" from the "pee

That married women in India are
marked with a spot in the middle of

the custom was adopted in this coun
try, perhaps the men wouldn't make
so many blunders.
Oscar MIschauex's wonderful new
picture, "Within Our Gates," which'
will undoubtedly rival any preachment ,
picture ever produced. Is now before
tho Chicago Board of Censors. Mr
MIschauex is tho producer of "The
Homesteader," an unusual picture
which developed nation-wide popular-
Ity. The new picture deals with the
present tinrest of the races in Ameri
ca, showing things as they exist, and
suggests a remedy. A beautiful ro-'
manco is carried throughout the pte-l

GOVERNOR GARDNER ACTS. t
That tho delegation of Ministers
who were sent to Jefferson City last
week obtained results relative to the
recent lynching at Moberly, Mo., is evi

this city, secretary of the committee.
It Is as follows:
"My Dear Dr. Shaw: Tho Governor
lias addressed a letter to the Prosecut

urging n thorough investigation of the
recent lynching and has also official
ly ordered the attorney general of the
state to assist the prosecutor of the
county in making a complete and
sweeping investigation and hring be
foro tho bar of justice all those who
violated the law. The Governor has
always taken a stron? stand for law
and order and you will find Doctor,
from examination of the records that
there have been very few Iynchings of
oither white or Colored in this state.
For the Governor,

THE PRESIDENT THE CONGRESS
THE HOUR OF TRIAL AT HAND.
Tho annual message of tho Presi
dent of the United States Is before the
Congress. Again as again and again
the nothingness of our particular
group Is emphasized. The year has
been filled with the most dangerous
and delicate happenings, the bitterest
of feeling and the most atrocious acts
In the history of the nation, so far as
we, 15,000,000 are concerned; and yet.
It hao not been regarded sufficient !
for the President to make even a dl-1
rect veiled allusion to tho need of im-j
mediate co-operative adjustment. j
Our position is akward and humiliat
ing, but it is insistent and just Presl-j
dents and Congressess, year after.
year, have Ignored, sidetracked and
"passed the buck" in matters affecting
our constitutional rights. Arthur Bris
bane, noted philosopher and Journal
ist, In a recent "Today" expression
stated that the cause of unrest Is duo
to the fact that the War has taught
tho people to THINK, that in the last
five years there has ben more REAL
THINKING than in the twenty-five
previous years. That applies very par.
tlcularly to our group. We are now a
thinking people and we know that we
know. We have spent a half century
"Praying" and "Requesting" and have
slipped backward In the march of pro
gress. Today we are assuming the
prerogatives of full fledged manhood
and we are "demanding" and "acting"
The results even In so short a time,
are gratifying.

KANSAS CITY'S PIONEER REAL ESTATE
DEALER IS BACK ON THE JOB.
YOU SAY YOU CAN'T SAVE.
You are mistaken absolutely. Don't oxcuso yourself with the
Insane- argument that your case is different. It Is identical to
thousands of cases right here In Kansas City.
Common sense demands that you lay aside a part of your
Income for future necessity, and old age. Why don't you do it?
If you work on a salary, by far tho easiest way is to obligate
yourself to a plan of systematic saving.
BUY A HOME ON PAYMENTS.
The payments can be mot each month Just as easily as you
now pay rent You won't bo able to tell the difference, but there
is a difference, a tremendous difference you will own your home
you will be a citizen In the true sense of tho word, and you will
bo accumulating an estate for yourself, and your family that would
never result from paying rent.
DONT HESITATE.
Look over this list carefully. If you do not see anything that
suits you, come and see me at once. I have many others.
