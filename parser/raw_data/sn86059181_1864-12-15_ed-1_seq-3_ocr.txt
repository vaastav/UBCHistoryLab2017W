it due to tbe people of the frontier towns
to adopt tbe most prompt and efficient
means for the geenrity of their lives and
property. All military commanders on

case further acts of depredation and
murder are attempted, whether by ma
rauders or persons acting under com
mission, from tbs rebel authority at
Richmond, to shoot down the perpetra
tors, if possible, while in the commis
sion of their crimes; or if it be neces

Chandler I see in the mornin? pa
pert tbe following- anaoancement, from
Xoronto: "Tbe St, Albaas raultrs have
been discharged, for want of Jnritvatc
tion. I desire to offer a couple of reso
lutions bearinz upon this subject one
ef them particularly; but I do net ex
pect to make tbe Senate nnderttand the
state of feelice existing oa the border.
I bare a rreat number of letters from
gentlemen living on tbe border. In my
own city, wbicb is within musket rane
of the Canadian shore, thousands of
citizens have been underarms fjr a long
time. We have been in a continual
state of alarm, from incendiaries, btr
glare and robbers.
rrom this announcement it would
seem tbat tba Canadian authorities have
made np tbeir minds to protect these
robbers. As I understand it, a man
comes from the South with a commis
sion purporting: to be issued br Jeff
Davis, lie enlists bis robbing par
lies, crosses the border, murders.
and robs whom he pleases, and return 1
to Canada, where he is prelected. These
letters which I have in my possesaiou '
are ail bearing spun tbia point. The
one in my hand now is from one of the
most respectable cilixens of Detroit, a
jrentiemaa af great wealth, of bigh poli
tical and social position, wbo earnestly
desires to avoid any difficulty with Great
Britain at tbis time. J be anxiety grow
ing out of the mist asd iloubt encircling

endured, and if, upon some slight provo
cation, our people shall bo found en
gaged in Canada ia some act that the
anadtaa Government will say is wronr.
sooner or later war will bo tbe .result.
Lie says, also, Will yoa give this subject
your immediate attention? lor it in
volves, sooner or later, if not properly
managed, war with Great Britain.
Mr. t resident, I bare no expectation
of making the Senate comprehend tbe
state of excitement thus announced and
the state of feeling n tbat border. Ver
mont may, for ought I know, quietly
submit to have ber towns robbwd and
ber fgitixent murdered, but the North
west will not
I offer tbis resolution:
Wbeeeas, llecent raids have been
organised in the Canadas and Nora
Scotia, and mea enlisted ia said British
Provinces by mea purporting to hold
commissions from the rebels, tor mur
dering peaceable cilixens of the I'cited
Slates, for burning cities, and for pirati
cally captunn merchant vessels and
murdering the crews, and for a general
system of murder, arson, robbery, and
plunder of peaceable and unarmed citi
zens of the United States; At Waist
as, The people of the British Provinces
sem disposed to protect these robbers,
incendiaries, pirates, and mnrderers, not
only in their individual capecitiei, but
by tbe quibbles of tbe law; therefore
hetolved, Ibat tbe Committee on
Military Affairs be directed to enquire
into the expediency of enlietio; an ar
my corps to watca aad detend our ter
ritory bordering oa the lakes, aud the
Canadian line, from all hostile demon
strations and incursions.
Johnson I object to tbe resolution
The President, pro tem The resolu
tion will lie over, objections being
made.
Chandler I bad hoped there would
be no objection to it I will now offer
another resolution which I ask to be re
ferred to the Committee on Commerce.
The resolution was read and is as fol

herman Before a vote is taken. I
would like to say a word or two. I bar
no objection to the reference of tba reso
lution, but will stale that the Committee
finance have already this tubieet
uder consideration, at recommended
by the Secretary of the Treasury in his
nnual report and by the President of
tbe United States in hit annual message.
II tbe points at issue wi!l be cocsidur
I by the Committee without anv reso
lution on the subiect
Mieruian explained further, that while
was well eaough for Senators to ex-
rets anxiety oa tbe sabject, all bills to
revenue intit orieiaete in the
House of ItepresenUlivea The Senate
stould remember that at the last session
psseed resolutions for a special in
me tax. aad the House sent it back, on
the ground that all such measures shosld
ongtnsie in the House. Lie thought
tbat this resolution would create a
controvtrsy with the House which
be desired to avoid. The Seaate must
await tbeir action. Be believed there
was a necessity for increased taxation.
There were teveral reasons for it The
soldiers were bow terving in the
field and enduring the hardships of mili
tary service while citixene were reaping
rit-a probtt from tbe war, by engaging
ia bueintta, and were doing belter than
thej bad done during any previous year.
lis thought it waa but right that they
who ar reaping the profits of the war
should pay liberally in tax. If we in
creased our national debt aad put these
tares upon future generations, we com
pelled these soldiers, who bad fought
our battles, to bear tbe expenses of tbe
w-r. This would be unjust
Brown. I bave no objections lo tbe
reference of this rssolultoo lo tbe Com
mittee on Finance, if it waa introduced
simply for se-uing forth the viewa enter
tained by ibe Senator from Wtecoasia
(Mr. DooUtt't), of indicating lis direc
tion in wb.cb be thought inquiry should
be male, btt if it is going to that com
mittee by general consent, aad is to be
taken at tny ingestion that tbe Stoate
coocart in the taggeetioat made, 1
shonid, for one, say that 1 differ very
widely ia regard to the policies be bas
indicated, and tbe erTrcu to follow from
tbat which be seems la anticipate I
iU add but one word more, and say
(bit tbat I tbiak gentlemen are pr
bapt mistaken in regard to live extent
to which Uxatioo can be carried, an 1
tbat we art perhapt nearer to tbe point
to wbich it can properly be borne than
persons imagine.
Mr Brown continued hit remarks, ad
rocetirig a reduction ef expenditures ia
the romiuct of tbe Government
Ma lWtf.U -I sgrea with tba Sena
tor from Missouri entirely in wbat be
tart about tbe necessity of reducing ex
penses in every possible way. I will go
with him in every effort to reduce them,
and to compel the Administration, In
every department of the Goverament, to
eiercise) (be strictest economy possible.
Al the same time, our necessary expen
ses are so great, and net I be to great.
Ibat we are compelled to teiit Bold of
every source that will bring ut revenue.
I do not expect, of aoarse, that these
reasons shall go forth at expressing tbe
views of the Seaate upon tba points I
bare presented, still the points are of
sufficient interest and importance to be
well considered by tbat committee.
Tbe resolution was then referred,
without objection.
Chandler moved tbat tbe resolutions
offered by him to dsy be printed, wbich
was earned.
Brown offered tbe following, wbich
wal adopted:
icetoitea, mat tne committee on
Military Affairs and the military be in
strncted to inquire into lis expediency
of repeating an act of Congress of March
21st, 1S61, entitled aa "Act to remove
the Arsenal Irora the city of St Louia,
aad to provide for tbe sale of the land on
which it is located.
Doolittle moved that all bills, petitient
and memorials wbich were pending at
the close of the last seamen ot Congress
be referred to their appropriate Com
mittee i. This was carriea'.
. A joint resolutioa from tie House was
announced giving notice to Great
Britain of the termination of tbe Reci
procity Treaty.
Foster moved to refer it the Commit
tee on Commerce.
Sumner thought it ought to go to tbe
Committee on foreign delations, and
it was oo motion, so referred.
Tbe Senate went into exentivt session
and soon after adjourned.
Hocse. WUsoo, of Iowa, from tbe
Committee oa Judiciary, renorted a bill
amendatory of an act of July 17th, 1362,
to define pay and ercoiamenls of officers
