MONEY BUNG
I DISTRIBUTE
Reports Show That in Most of the
Counties Tobacco is Pack
ed For Shipment
The District Board of the Burley
Tobacco Society met in this city at
1030 oclock Tuesday morning m
regular session Most of the day was
consumed in hearing reports from the
different counties These reports
show that in most of the counties in
the Burley District the tobacco has
been packed and is ready for ship
ment while the remainder the work
of packing has been hindered on ac
count of dry weather
Work at all points is being pushed X
as rapidly as possible and with fav
orable weather for the next three
weeks the 19067 crop will be dis
posed of
ofSpeculators Are Checked
Some trouble is reported in some
of the counties from holders of pool
ed tobacco selling their certificate to
speculators The Boards of Control
of these counties have knowledge of
the situation and say that they have
put a stop to the practice

The contract signed by the Execu
tive Committee when the big sale was
made to the American Tobacco Com
pany and the independent buyers was
read and ratified by the full commit
tee
teeWhen
When the first big sales of the 1906
crop were made 10 per cent of the
money was held in the different banks
as an equalization fund in case it be
came necessary to sell the remainder
of the crop at less than graded pric
es
As the whole crop has been sold at
full prices this was not needed and
fourfifths of this money is teady
for disbursement which the commit
tee has ordered done and the money
is being distributed as rapidly as
possible
The board is in session and the
manner of distributing the money
will be determined It is believed
that the money will be paid out from
time to time as the tobacco is de
livered instead of waiting and dis
tributing the cash at one time
What to do in regard to the 1909
crop as yet has not been discussed
and there is a disposition among a
great many of the delegates to take
no steps in that direction now as
they say the meeting this week is
one of jollification and congratula
tion FARMERS CLUB TO

SENDS SPECIAL
ARMY MESSAGE
President Wants Larger Volunteer
Fighting ForceCullom
Presents Bill
Washington Dec 9ln ewer
gency volunteer army measure was
advocated by President Roosevelt in
a special message sent to congress
and the draft of the bill accompany
ing the message was introduced in
the senate by Mr Cullom The pres
ident says the bill is intended to re
place the present law which was
placed on the statute books piece
meal and hurriedly partly on the eve
of the war with Spain and partly
after hostilities had actually com
menced
After declaring the present law to
be faulty and wholly inadequate to a
speedy and proper organization of a
volunteer force the president says
the bill proposed which was drawn
under the supervision of the chief of
staff of the army has the nearty ap
proval of the war department
The message says further It is
designed to afford the complete ma
chinery by which should we be con
fronted with a foreign war the ex
ecutive power could proceed at once
to transform enthusiastic and patri
otic citizens into efficient and organ
ized soldiers Happily there Is at
present no cloud upon our horizon
but that very fact affords us the very
best opportunity to proceed with de
liberation and care in the prepara
tion of laws adequate and indispens
able for our possible war needs
It is pointed out by the president
that the proposed measure would not
call for a dollars expenditure during
the years of peace and its enactment
into law now would merely be to
place at the disposal of the executive
power machinery whereby should
I war threaten the means to wage it
could be swiftly brought into being
I The bill is elastic under its pro
visions a force of 2000000 men could
be raided as well as one of 50000
Bills Introduced In Congress
Washington Dec 91n both house
and senate a number of bills were in
troduced and in the house a number
were sent to conference among them
being one providing for a new immi
gration station in Boston For the
first time during the present con
gress there was a call of the commit
tees of the house but no measure
was reported by any of them The
miscellaneous work of the senate
I
consisted in the main of the ref
erence in executive session of
about 1500 recess nominations
which were Sent to the senate by the
president and the adoption of resolu
tions of regret on account of the
death of members of the house who
have passed away since adjournment

t
I
Chicago Dec 9The Issue be
tween the shippers of the country
and the railroads which broadly ilI
said to be whether the plow follows
the locomotive or the locomotive ther
plow was joined at the annual ban
quet of the Illinois Manufacturers
association here W C Brown senior
vice president of the New York Cen
tral lines delivered an elaborate plea
for the participation of the railroads
In the countrys prosperity while
Ohio C Barber president of the Dia
mond Match company vehemently
asserted that Instead of contemplat
ing increase freight rates which per
haps ultimately go through some
American heiress to enrich foreign
noblemen the roads should be cal
culating how great a reduction they
should in fairness make to shippers
Mr Barber in his address referred
several times to Mr Brown declar
ing that the latter in his attempts to
educate the public to a belief that
higher rates are necessary perhaps
Is taking his cue from the late P T
Barnum who said the public was
fond of being humbugged
William H Vanderbilt said Mr
Barber who succeeded his father
the Commodore with the latter
brain and ability recognized tha
public with the words the public be
damned and the public has been
damned eversince
Mr Barber declared that at the be I
ginning of the panic last winter the
railroads discharged a greater pro
portion of men than any other indus
try and accentuated the results of
the panic by cutting off repairs and
purchases in every direction and
tried to blame conditions on Presi
dent Roosevelt whom they accused
of creating them
Mr Browns address presented a
careful review of the increase in the
price of every commodity within the
last ten years save alone freight
rates which he said had lagged be
hind He said that if the expend
itures of the railroads for 1907 could
have been made at prices obtaining
in 1897 the railroads of the country
would have saved 676000000 He
stated that during the past ten
months the railroads have been mak
ing the most painstaking investiga
tion and analysis of their own condi a
tion ever made He confirmed the
charge made a year ago that from
1898 to 1908 freight rates had been
advanced on 897 articles but he add
ed that in the same time they had
been reduced on 876 articles and
that the net result was a reduction
in rates of 1069 per cent y
Austrian Boycott In Turkey
