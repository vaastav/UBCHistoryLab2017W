THE FIFTIETH CONGRESS.
Senator Faulkner S worn In Senator Morrill
on Immigration.
Washington, Dec 14. In the Senate, Mr.
Hoar, from the committee on privileges and
elections, presented a report in the West Vir
ginia ease. lie said that the report was unani
mous. The questions raised were very simple
ones and easily comprehended. One of them
had been, long aeo, determined by the Senate,
and he supposed that all Senators bad had occa
sion to reflect on the other. In order that the
Senator entitled to the seat might enter at once
upon bis duties, be hoped there would be no ob
jection to bavins the report disposed of at pres
ent. The report was read at length. It concludes
with two resolutions, one declaring that Daniel'
H. Lucas is not entitled to the seat and the
other declaring that Charles J. Faulkner has
nen dnly elected Senator from the State of
West Virginia for the term of six years com
xnencine March 4, 18S7. and is entitled to a seat
in the Senate as snch Senator. The resolutions
were agreed to viva voce, and the oath of office
was thereupon administered to Mr. Faulkner.
Mr. Hoar then moved that Mr. Faulkner be
assigned to the committee on claims. District of
Columbia, mines and mining, and pensions.
A r reed to.
Mr. Harris, from the committee on rules, re
ported an amendment to the thirty-first rule.
That rule provides that where an adverse report
is made on a claim, and the report screed to, it
shall not be in order to move to take the papers
from file for the purpose of referring them at a
subsequent session, unless the petition states
that new evidence has been discovered, and the
substance of it. The amendment is to add to
the rule a clause that in cases where there is no
nciYerse report ii miau oo iur uuijr ui mo occm
tary of the Senate to transmit all such papers
to the committee in wnicn sucn ciaimsare penn
ing. The report was agreed to.
The Senate took up the bill introduced by Mr.
Morrill to regulate immicration and was ad
dressed by that Senator in explanation and ad
vocacy of the bill. Its mam object, ne said, was
to have the character of foreign immigrants ex
amined, first, by the United States consuls at
the: ports of departure, instead of by State
commissioners at the ports of arrival. The for
eign idea, he said, was that the United States
invited free immigration regardless of the char
acter of the immigrants; but the American idea
was that it never really offered an asylum to
convicts, to irreconcilable enemies of law and
order, or to the occupants of the old world's
insane asylums and work-bouses. The
doors were left open only to persons of good
moral character. The fact that nearly
5.OO0.00O immigrants had come to this country
within the last tea years proved that the ques
tion was one of very great importance. The
great American principle of free admission of
immigrants was not proposed to be abandoned,
but that principle had always been on the con
dition that the immigrants should be of good
mora! character and should be able to support
themselves. Ke referred to the fact that re
cently the Mayor of the Athens of America had
presided at a banquet given in honor of the
champion slugger of the prize-ring; and that if
not the will, at the least the political necessities
of the Mayor, had consented to that.
He said that 70 per cent of the population of
Boston was composed of persons of foreien
birth and foreien parentage; 80 per cent, of the
population of New Yo-k, and 91 per cent, of
the population of Chicago, and these figures
might be aggravated by future immigration.
D- the census of I860 the population of foreign
birth and parentage was about 15,000.000; and
the immigration since then, 4,344,000, so that,
without including the children born of foreign
parentage since 1880. there was now in this
country a foreign population of 19.3-10,000,
or nearly one-third of the entire population.
This disclosed the ' enormous attractive
force exerted by this country on
the inhabitants of Europe. He had
lately visited Castle Garden, New York, where
a vessel had just arrived from Antwerp with 600
immigrants, and the sight he had witnessed sug
gested the doubt whether this country possessed
the transcendent power to transfer all these im
migrants into good and valuable American citi
zais. He quoted the reply of Mr. Balfour to a
question in the Bouse of Commons as to the
government aiding emigration to the effect
that the government would apply no more
money to that purpose during the remainder of
the year. This, he said, was a negative preg
nant. Mr. Balfour had not said that parishes or
neighbors should not aid emigration. At the
end of the year emigration might be aided by
the British government again, unless the
fishery commissioners should implore Mr.
Balfour to refrain from putting briars in their
path while cunning diplomacy was going on
here. The paupers of Great Britain number
nearly a round million, outside of the uncounted
r,Mtntl and rfiltial TMinnArft- vhfl far ATCeed
the number of so-called paupers. There was
too a strong tendency in Europe to regard the
United States as a cess pool for the Vilest prod
ucts of the old world. Provident husbandry
demanded that young America should not be
wholly deprived of its birthright The measure
introduced by him was intended to regulate
immigration by a scheme so moderate as to re
ceive general approval. It would, of course, be
referred to the judiciary committee. He hoped
that that committee would report some measure
to checkmate the gross imposition from foreign
nations to which this country had been so large
ly subjected. He moved that the bill be re
ferred to the judiciary committee.
Mr. Edmunds suggested that the subject more
properly belonged to the committee on foreign
elation; and he moved that reference.
The latter motion was agreed to, and on mo
tion of Mr. Edmunds the Sepate then proceeded
to consideration of executive business. In
about ten minutes the doors were reopened, and
tha Senate adjourned till to-morrow.
THE POSTMASTERS.
Sketch of a Measure Outlining the Changes
They Desire.
Washington, Dec. 14 The national conven
tion of third and fourth-class postmasters
adopted the following as the basis of a bill to "be
hereafter formulated and presented to Con
gress: "We recommend that the government shall
allow to postmasters of the third class all the
revenue which may accrue from the rent of
boxes in their offices. We also recommend and
request that the expense of rent light and fuel
shall be borne by the government, believing, as
we do, that such items of expense are properly
chargeable to the appropriation for support and
maintenance of the postal service. We further
recommend that the government allow to offi
cers of the third tsiass an amount sufficient to
employ a competent clerical force to properly
conduct the business of the office.
"It is recommended that the expense of rent,
light and fuel of fourth-claes offices be
allowed by the government upon the
following basis: On a salary of $50
per year, and not to exceed $150,
$25; on a salary exceeding $150 per year, and not
to exceed $300, $50; on a salary exceeding $300
per year and not exceeding $500, $75; on a
exceed $750, $100; on a salary exceeding $750,and
not exceeding $1,000. $150. It is also recommended
that clerk hire be allowed in separating offices
where mails are seperated for other offices
as follows: One mail per week, $10 per year;
two mails per week, $20 per year;
three , mails per week, $30 per rear;
one mail daily, $60 per yean two mails daily,
$100 per year; thro e mails daily, $150 per year;
four mails daily, $250 per year; five mails or
more daily. $300 per year. We recommend that
all railway postal clerks be supplied with a suit
able government card on which they may report
to postmasters the amount of mail matter of all
classes that may be deposited in their cars, and
that these cards shall be addressed to the post
master at each and every office where such mail
matter may be placed on mail trains, and that
the postmaster shall be entitled to take credit,
in his quarterly reports, upon the value of the
stamps canceled as reported upon said govern
ment cards.
"It is recommended that no postmaster receive
a less compensation than $25 per year, and that
fourth-class postmasters receive 100 per cent of
the first hundred doilars of stamps canceled,
GO per cent of the next hundred dollars, 50
percent, of the next two hundred dollars and
40 per cent of the balance until the commission
amounts to $250, exclusive of box rent' It is
recommended that when the cancellations
amount to $1,000 per fiscal year, or wfien the
gross receipts amount to $1,900 for any one year,
exclusive of the money-order business, it shall
he declared a third-clans office."
The following resolution was also adopted.
Whereas. The law as it exists at the present time
in relation to the admission of newspapers and other
publications into the mails as second-class matter, is
not tuftcient to protect the government from loss ia
the transportation of illegitimate matter and is a drag
and weight npon our postal fcybtem; it is therefore
Resolved, by the postmasters' national convention.
That the law bhould be so framed as to exclude from
the privileges of second-class matter all publications
not embraced in the order of regular, legitimate
journals; and it is further
Kcoh1, That this convention heartily Indorses
the recommendations on this subject contained in tht
honorable Third Assistant Postmaster-general's last
anunal report.
A series of resolutions was also adopted heart
iv indorsing the administration of President
Cleveland, and expressing their appreciation of
the efforts of Postmaster-general Vilas and
First Assistant Postmaster-general Stevenson to
improve the postal service. The convention ad
journed until to-morrow.
THE SENATE COMMITTEES.
Principal Changes Made In the Composition
of the Standing Committees.
Special to Boston Journal.
The notable charges in the reconstruction of
the committees, so far as the Republican side of
the Senate goes, are these: Palmer of Michigan
follows Warner Miller as chairman of the com
mittee on agriculture, a committee which labored
hard to secure the passage of the oleomargarine
law. Mr. Allison remains as chairman of the
committee on appropriations, and Mr. Far well, a
practical man of business, is given the place on
this committee which General Logan held. Mr.
Hale, of Maine, i3 chairman of ithe census com
mittee, a committee which may have important
duties in this Congress. Mr. Ingalls has followed
recent precedents and has retained the chairman
ship of a working committee, that on the Dis
trict of Columbia, while holding, also, the office
of president of the Senate. Mr. Blair retains
his chairmanphip of the committee on educa
tion and labor, and has promised to renew his
efforts in this Congress to pass the Blair bill.
The death of General Logan and the defeat of
General Sewall have led to a change in the
chairmanship of the committee on civil-service.
General Hawley going from that position to the
chairmanship of the committee on military af
fairs, and Mr. Chace, of Rhode Island, the only
Quaker in the Senate, succeeding him as chair
man on the committee on civil-service reform.
Mr. Spooner, who has risen more rapidly in the
Senate than any new member in recent years,
has been made chairman of the committee on
claims. Mr. Dolph goes to coast defenses, and
will aek for a liberal appropriation for coast de
fenses. Mr. Frye, who has been so long a member of
the committee on commerce, and chirman of the
committee on rules, surrenders the place to Mr.
Aldrich, of Rhode Island, and succeeds Mr. Mc
Millan as chairman of the committee on com
merce. This is the first time in many years that
the chairmanship of this committee has not been
filled by a Western man. Mr. Frye is an enthusi
astic advocate of river and harbor improvements,
but he lives in a country where there are rivers
and harbors and ships, and he does not favor
macademizicg dry mountain streams for the
sake of the votes that may follow in the wake of
useless appropriations. The advance of public
opinion is possibly to be noted in connection
with the committee on transportation routes to
the seaboard, for from a temporary committee
appointed during the recess to make a specific
investigation it has been made a standing com
mittee, with Mr. Cnllom as permanent 'chair
man, and is destined to become one of the most
important committees of the Senate.
The action of the Senate in making this a per
manent committee is a sufficient answer to any
baseless stories that the interstate-commerce
law will be repealed. However much some por
tions of the law may be disliked, there is prob
ably not a member of either house who will
care to so far defy public opinion as to move to
repeal it, and no changes in the law are to be
anticipated, except such as are designed to make
it more equitable or to enlarge its scope by giv
ing to the commission definite powers which
now are matters of construction, doubt or infer
ence. THE VETERANS' RIGHTS UNION
Take the Charges Against Secretary Lamar
to the Senate A Test Case To Be Made.
Washington Special.
The Veterans' Rights Union have taken their
charges that Secretary Lamar has violated the
law in regard to retaining Union soldiers to the
Senate. They have selected a case which they
regard as very strong, and in which they have
the support of two members of the Civil-service
Commission, and placed the details of it
formally in the hands of Senator Edmunds, of
the committee on the judiciary. He has replied
that the charges shall have due consideration.
The case is that of the removal of Captain W.
W. Macy, of the Pension Office, who served in the
Nineteenth and Twentieth Indiana, and who has
a splendid field-service record, and who was sev
eral times seriously wounded. His removal was
recommended by General Black. It was admit
ted that he was competent, faithful, and in every
other respect a reputable and excellent clerk.
He was removed solely because his place was
wanted by Indiana Democrats. This was
agreed to by all concerned as the only reason.
It was freely made known to Senator Voorbees,
who, in spite of his strong partison views, and
his belief in a general removal of Republicans,
interested himself in this case, as be has in
many deserving soldier cases. He went to the
Pension Office and asked for the reasons, and
was informed that the pressure from the Sixth
Indiana District for Captain Macy's place was so
great, that it could not be resisted. Mr. Gray
had been at the pains to take part in the matter,
and represent the determination of the Demo
crats of that district to be taken care of. For
these reasons Captain Macy bad been removed.
The Veterans' Rights Union appealed to Secre
tary Lamar, and brought the violation of the
law that would be involved in his indorsement
of Black's recommendation for removal to the
Secretary's attention. He declined to interfere
and made the removal.
Under the recommendation of two members
of the Civil-service Commission, it has been de
termined to test this case in the courts. The
Veterans' Rights Union have a record of be
tween sixty and seventy cases where Union
soldiers of the best record for field service and
efficient clerical work have been dismissed by
General Black to make room for Democrats.
In presenting the Macy case to the Senate, the
claim is that Secretary Lamar has violated the
plainest provision of law, after the facts of the
case had been made entirely clear to him. His
answer wili be that in these matters he has at
tempted to deal fairly with Union soldiers, and
that he has supposed it safe in such a matter to
follow the recommendations of his Commissioner
of Pensions, whom he selected because he was
a Union soldier.
MINOR MATTERS.
A Circular Which Is Canning Uneasiness In
the Railway Mail Service,
jpeclal to the IndianasoIIs Journal.
Washington, Dec. 14 A mild sort of panie
has been caused in certain sections of the West
among postal clerks by the receipt of blanks
from the division superintendent, calling for the
age, birthplace, etc., of the railway mail em
ployes. Quite a large number of letters have
been written here by the railway mail clerks,
inquiring what this new onslaught means. It
seems to be pretty generally understood that
the older employes are to be removed to give
place to young men. Superintendent Nash told
me to-day that there was no danger to any of
the old employes whose ages and health did not
interfere with their physical and mental abili
ties; that any and all men who performetheir
duties satisfactorily would be retained. Those
whose oges and physical condition interfere
with their work would, of eourse, be dropped.
No appointments are being made now to the
railway mail service of men above about thirty
four years of ace. The idea is to fill up the
service with active young men. The research
for the ages and records of old employes will
have the effect of prodocine some agility, no
doubt, and a material improvement in their
work. Less than half of the old employes have
been removed by this administration, and. tak
ing it all in all, this class of government em
ployes have received more consideration at the
hands of the administration than any other.

Uniform Measurements.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, Dec 14. Mr. Burrows, of
Michigan, has prepared a bill which he will in
troduce, which is of special interest to farmers
of Indiana. It establishes a uniform system of
weights. The present standard of weights of
farm products makes great inconvenience In
Indiana a bushel of onions is 57 pounds, while in
Michigan 54 pounds make a bushel, in Massa
chusetts 53 pounds, and in Illinois 56 pounds. A
bushel of beans varies from 58 to 62 pounds, and
of buckwheat from 42 to 48 pounds.
Discreet Mr. Mills.
Washington Special.
Hon. Roger O. Mills, since it has been settled
that he is to be chairman of the committee on
ways and means, has become wonderfully dis
creet. He was asked to-day if he thought the
House would pass a tariff bill in the line of th
President's message, and he replied:
"When I was in the army I generally followed
the advice of the general and planted the flag
wherever he directed. I didn't go off in a corner
and have a little fieht by myself, for if I had I
would have been licked. No man can afford to
fight by himself, for be is bound to get worsted."

INDIANA AN1 ILLINOIS.
The Trial of the Confidence Men Gradually
Becoming More Complicated.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
Brownstown, Ind., Dec. 14. The third day
of the Rice, Stewart and Mason trial passed
without any incident of particular interest. The
entire day was spent in examining witnesses. A
move waa made yesterday by the defense to
prevent Sheriff.rrne from acting in his official
capacity during the trial, the prisoners making
oath that his bias would prevent them from
having a fair trial, claiming that the sheriff had
publicly declared he would send the defendants
to the penitentiary; that he had gone to
Parker, Forbes and Kearns in prison and had
them sign a release to Deputy against pros
ecution for damages. The complaint presented
by attorney Lamb was quite lengthy. Judge
Collins decided there was no law to warrant the
suspension of Sheriff ;Byrne. One of the strong
est points in favor of the defendents is that
Deputy testified that Parker, Forbes and
Kearns, who are here as witnesses from prison,
are the men who robbed him; while others who
saw him with one of the men clearly identify
one of the other three, and the case becomes
more complicated as the testimonyaccumulates.
This old town, which is called the geographical
center of Jackson county, is filled with witnesses
from Jefferson, Jennings and Jackson counties.
The hotels are fiDed with attorneys, and the
jail is filled with confidence men.

to whom it was to be paid. After standing him
up and taking the money from him young Long
est was allowed to go on his way, the highway
men mounting their horses, which they had
tied near the roadside, and escaping, An hour
later, the alarm being widely circulated, one
hundred mounted and armed men were in pur
suit of the highwaymen, but at last accounts
they had eluded arrest; This bold and daring
robbery has created intense excitement in the
neighborhood, and if the highwaymen are taken
they will speedily dangle at the end of a rope.

THE KEELY M0T0K.
The Inventor Ia Certain of Snccess. but
Needs a Name for His New Force.
Philadelphia, Dec 14. The first annual
meeting of the stockholders of the Keely Motor
Company since 1883 was held in this city to-day,
and was attended by about seventv-nve stock
holders, representing nearly 70,000 shares. The
board 'of directors, in their report, arrive at tha
following conclusions:
First The directors are more than ever satis
fied that the enterprise is absolutely based upon
the application of a new motive power.
Second That Mr. Keely has underestimated,
in many particulars, the time necessary to the
completion of bis work.
Third That notwitstanding tbe doubts ex
pressed in some quarters, tbe board still has
hieb hopes, as they are sure wonderful progress
has been made in Mr. Keely'a work.
Fourth That the chief difficulties have been
removed and we are now in sight of the results.
Mr. Keely made a long report, in which he re
views his work since 1882, when he was engaged
in the construction of a generator for the pur
pose of securing vaoorie or etherio force from
water and air, but which, when completed, was
found to be impracticable owing to impossibility
of securing graduation. After a succession
of experiments he produced, in March, 1885,
what he termed a liberator, which could be op
erated in conjunction with the generator, and
was a vast stride in advance of anything accom
plished hitbertc Meanwhile, phenomena had
been unfolded to him openine a new field
of experiment, as the result of which
he became possessed of a new and important
discovery. Hereafter he shall not. he says, re
quire either the generator or the liberator. His
operations will be conducted without either the
vaporio or etherio forces. What name to give
his new form of force he does not know, but
tbe basis of it all, he says, is vibratory
sympathy. It may be divided into negative
and sympathetic attraction, these two forms of
force bring the antitheses of each other. He
would nx no time for the completion of his work,
but his ultimate success, he still holds, will be
greater than even his most sanguine advocates
have predicted. Mr. Keely admits that it
would have been better, perhaps, at tbe
time he changed base, to have let it be
known than to have encouraged a belief that he
was still engaged on his etherie and vaporia
forces. Among the work yet to be done is the
construction of a syrsDathetio machine of a very
delicate character. While this will be a perfect
vibratory structure itself, its funotion is to com
plete the work of graduation or governing its
force.
KANSAS PROHIBITORY DECISION.
Tbe Snpreme Court Says a Man May Drink
Himself or Give Away Liquor.
Topeka, Kan., Dec 14. The Supreme Court
to-day handed down an opinion in which they
deeided that any person the lawful and bona
fide possessor of intoxicating liquor may use it
as he sees fit; he may drink it himself or give it
away, hut be cannot, by any shift or device in
selling or giving away lawfully evade tbe pro
visions of the statute prohibiting the manufact
ure and Sila of intoxicating liquor. They also
bold that a person cannot be convicted under
Section 16 of the prohibitory act of 1881 for
keeping in his house, store, or in a wareroom
thereof, intoxicating liquor for his own use or
for giving away, if it is done honestly an in good
faith, and not as a shift to evade the provisions
of the act.
The decision was rendered by Chief-justice
UortoD, all the justices concurring. The case
came np in the Supreme Court on an appeal
from Miami county, and the decision of tbe
lower court was reversed. It seems that a shoe
dealer named Standish, of that place, had been
in the habit of sending to Kansas City and pur
chasing beer and whisky for a number of par
ties, they drinking it in the. back room of his
store. He, however, derived no profit, director
indirect, from tbe dispensation of the prohibited
beverage Notwithstanding this fact. he
was indicted by the grand iury. Under Sec
lion 16 of the prohibitory law of 1881, charged
with keeping a place where intoxicating liquor
was dispensed. He was convicted in the lower
court, and the ease was appealed, the result be
ing a reversal to-day.

A Victory for Prohibitionists.
Dcbuotje, la., Dec. 14. Judge Shiras, of the
United States District Court, sitting in this city,
remanded to-day all the brewery and saloon
cases before him to the State courts. This was
done at the request of Judge Brewer, of Kansas.
Fourteen cases, in all, were remanded. Thi3
does not prohibit the transfer of liquor cases
from the State courts, but it means that when
so removed, they will be at once remanded.
Judge Love, of the Southern Iowa District, has
received similar instructions. This cuts off all
hope on the part of the liquor men and brewers
of evading the final issue by delays and appeals.
It is a victory for the Prohibitionists, and will
result in putting to a speedy test the virtue of
the Clark law.

THE EOBINSON POISONING.
Testimony Elicited at Yesterday's Session of
Court The Chemists at Work.
Boston, Dee. 14. The same crowded court
room and eager throng of spectators as on pre
vious days met the gaze of Mrs. Sarah J. Robin
son, this morning, as she was placed in the docli
at her trial for murder. Dr. Emory L. White,
Willie's physician, resumed his testimony by
telling of his visit to Willie with Dr. Durell on
the evening of the 10th. The witness said t
Willie:
'You are a very sick boy, and must die. Tor
have been poisoned."
Willie said: "I know it." ;
Medical Examiner Durell testified to his visit
to Willie with Dr. White and corroborated Dr.
White's testimony.
Charles IL Jose, living in the house with the
Robinsons, said be waa present at tbe interview
just testified to by Dr. Durell, and Willie said:
I know I cannot live." Tbe witness said Willi
afterward replied that he knew he had been
DO isoned.
Dr. White was recalled and said that at the
last interview Willie said, ic response to the
question as to who gave him food: "No one but
my mother and Mr. Smith."
Dr. White further expressed the opinion that
he had received a dose of arsenie before the wit
ness saw him on Thursday; he must have re
ceived another dose between that time and Fri
day morning, when he found him better, and
the Saturday night, when he was worse; repeat
ed doses must have been given him.
Edward Ferguson, druggist, testified to put
ting up the prescriptions of Dr. White in thir
case. Other evidence as to the prescription
was offered to prove their authenticity and
preparation. No arsenic, he said, was put into
Dr. White's prescriptions.
Sergeant Cavauagh. of the Somerville police
force, said that be went" to the Robinson bouse,
Tuesday, to watch with Willie After Mrs. Rob
inson found out that the witness was an officer
he heard her, in moving about tbe bouse, throw
something out of an upper window. The witness
located the place where the object fell, and
found that it was an empty phiaL
Dr. Durell testified further to tbe conversa
tion by Willie's bedside. He said that in re
sponse to tbe witness's statement that he could
not live Willie said: "I know it; the old woman
dosed me."
Mrs. Sarah J. Robinson, sister-in-law of the
defendant, testified to being at the Robinson
house on tbe Tuesday before Willie died.
Officer Cavanagh came that night to watch with
Willie, and when Mrs. Robinson found be was
an officer she seemed much excited; when she
got a chaneeshe whispered something in Willie's
ear and told tha witness that she told Willie the
officer thought, perhaps, that she, his mother,
was trying to poison him.
Dr. John L, Hudleth testified he called on
Wednesday morning. Willie was very sick that
day. and he noticed an erosion of the mucous
membranes of the mouth, cheeks and' tongue;
such an effect would, in his opinion, be produced
by arsenic
The afternoon session was occupied in taking
tbe testimony of several analytical chemists
who had analyzed portions of the viscera of
Willie Robinson. They all concurred in the
statement that death had resulted from arseni
cal poisoning. This finished the ease foth
people. The defense will open to-morrow.

A Change in the Ticket.
Et. l.ouis GIobeiDemocrat.
Recent political events have pursuaded us to
withdraw CoL John L. Sullivan, of Massachus
etts, as a Democratic candidate for Vice-president,
and to substitute for him Col. Joseph Me
dill, of Illinois. Col. Sullivan is something of a
fighter, but Col. Medill is great as a kicker, and
in this capacity is always of service to the side
which he opposes.
But the Windows Are Closed.
Every season brings vexation,
With its joy and jubilation.
And this autumn, recent comer.
Brings the thumping and the pounding
From pianos, now resounding.
That were silent during summer.

It is Absurd
For people to expect a cure for Indiges
tion, unless they refrain from eating
what is unwholesome ; but if anything
will sharpen the appetite and give tone
to the digestive organs, it is Ayers Sar
saparilla. Thousands all over the land
testify to the merits of this medicine.
Mrs. Sarah, Burroughs, of 243 Eighth
street, South Boston, writes : "My hus
band has taken Ayer's Sarsaparilla, for
Dyspepsia and torpid liver, and has
been gTeatly benefited."
A Confirmed Dyspeptic.
C. Canterbury, of 141 Franklin st.,
Boston, Mass., writes, that, sufferings
for years from Indigestion, lie was at
last induced to try Ayer's Sarsaparilla
and, by its use, was entirely cured.
Mrs. Joseph Aubin, of High street,
Uolyoke, Mass., suffered for over a year
from Dyspepsia, so that she could not
eat substantial food, became very weak,
and was unable to care for her family.
Neither the medicines prescribed by
physicians, nor any of the remedies
advertised for the cure of Dyspepsia,
helped her, until she commenced the
use of Ayer's Sarsaparilla. "Three
bottles of this medicine," she writes,
" cured nie."
