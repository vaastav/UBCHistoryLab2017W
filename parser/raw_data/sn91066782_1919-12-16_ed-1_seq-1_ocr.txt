SEE A7 G FOR "LEAKS')
ON DECISIONS
Department of Justice at Washington
Trying to Find Out Who Is Re
sponsible for Giving Out Ad
vance Information.
Washington, D. C, Dee. 16. Depart
ment of justice officials continued to
day investigation of reports of alleged
"leaks'' on supreme court decisions,
which were being used as tips for
stock speculation. A minor official of
the department and an attache of the
supreme court were implicated in the
charges, but Captain Burke, chief of
the bureau of investigation of the jus
tice department, declared that so far
no basis for the charges had been dis
covered. In a verbal statement hist night,
Captain Burke said that " a Mr. B. E.
Moses" with offices in the Munsey
building, Washington, had been report
ed by Martin Pew, manager of the In
ternational News service for an alleged
attempt to secure financial backing
from a friend of Pew to play the stock
market on advance information of su
preme court decisions.
'Moses told Pew's friend." Capiain
Burke said, "that he had, been doing
this for some time, but he did not have
sufficient funds to make rthc profit he
might make if he had financial back
ing. The friend of Pew insisted that
before he -could get the finances which
Moses desired he would have to be con
vinced that advance information on the
supreme court decision was absolutely
obtainable. He told him that on Nov.
It), the man who furnished him (Moses)
with the information was employed in
the department of justice in Washing
ton. Furthermore, that this man was
with Moses in New York on Sunday,
Nov. ItS, and that on Monday morning
t hoy went down town and placed
Southern Pacillc short closing out when
the stock dropped three points. They
made some money but they did not
say how much. Latar Southern Pacific
was being played the other way so ob
viously, they had correct information
on the court's decision in the1 South
ern Pacific oil land cases."
Moses was interrogated by William
Flynn. director of the investigation of
the department of justice, Mr. Burke
said, and denied getting his informa
tion from an employe of the depart
ment of justice as was flaimed, or that
the Utter was getting it in turn from
an attache of the supreme court. Moses,
according to Burke, said he had made
his deduction on the future movements
of the stock a any lawyer might have
done from the general information on
the Southern Pacific oaac. He denied
also there was a leak in the supreme
court.
Captain Burke said the official in
question holds a minor position in the
department of justice and that he de
nies he knew anyone in the supreme
court who would give out any such in
formation or that he had been m any
such deals as were charged.
"The attache of the supreme court
denies also that he had any connection
with the aflair and there is nothing to
show that he did," Captain Burke
added.
However, he said, the investigation
would be continued. (
Clerk Maher Denies Any "Leak."
.James- I), Maher, clerk of the su
preme court, denied to-day that there
wa any "leak" in his office on the
court's prohibition decision yesterday
and said he knew nothing of an inves
tigation being made by tthe depart
ment of justice.
"There was no leak here, if there was
any leak," Mr. Maher isaid.
Associate Justice Brandcis, who
wrote and, delivered the prohibition
opinion yesterday, declined ito comment
on reports of a "leak." i

chase of Food
Paris, Dec. Hi. Initial measures of
relief for Austria were taken by the
supreme council to-day after that body
had heard a lengthy presentation of
his nation's difficulties by Dr. Karl
Renner, the Austrian chancellor. It wa
decided that as a first step in relieving
the Austrian food shortage, 30,000 ton
of food should be dispatched to Triest
to be shipped thence into Austrian ter
ritory. The general opinion expressed in the
council was that the co-operation of
the United States in the Austrian re
lief measures was absolutely necessary
and that the credits for the purchases
which Austria mut make could be ac
corded only by America.
Although it was officially announced
that the health of Premier Clemenceau
was perfectly satisfactory this morn
ing, and no bulletin was issued, the
meeting of the council was held at
his residence.
The council took up the question of
the desire of Vorarlbcrg, the principali
ty in the northwest Tyrol, to detach
itself from Austria. It was decided
to use every means to as-sure the unity
of the principality with Austria, as
provided for by the treaty of St. tier-

LIQUOR MEN
IN NEW FIGHT
Attack Prohibition Amend
ment in Action Before
U. S. Supreme Court
SEEK INJUNCTION
ON ENFORCEMENT
Want the Amendment De
clared to Be Uncon
stitutional Washington, D. ft, Dee. 16. Permis
sion to institute original proceedings to
have the national prohibition amend
ment declared unconstitutional and
New Jersey and federal authoritiet en
joined from enforcing it was asked- of
the supreme court to-day by the Retail
Liquor Dealers' Association of New
Jersey. '
This was the first question as to tho
validity of the constitutional amend
ment "to reach Jjio supreme court.
George W. Tucker of New York pre
sented the motion, together with a
printed brief prepared by the associa
tion, and the court will announce later
whether permission to institute the
suit will be granted.
In addition to enjoining enforcement
of the lSth amendment, the associa
tion Also would ask an injunction
against enforcement of the Volstead
prohibition enforcement act.
Defendants named in the proceedings
were the state of New Jersey, which
re-fused to ratify the constitutional
amendment. Attorney -General Palmer,
Joseph L. Bodine, United States attor
ney for New Jersey, and Commissioner
of Internal Revenue Daniel C. Roper.
The association's bri'f alleged that
the constitutional amendment was" an
interference with the state police pow
ers, n violation of the fifth constitu
tional amendment, which prohibit the
taking of private property without just
compensation, that neither Coiigros
I'nor the state legislatures had authority
to propose or ratify the amendment,
and that the amendment when passed
by the House does not receive the sup
port of two-thirds of the membership.
as the constitution provides, but only
of two-thirds of the members present.
LIQUOR MEN MAY
SUE GOVERNMENT
Claim That Decision of Superior Court
Virtually Confiscate Liquor
They Hold.
New York. Dec. 18. Lawyers repre
senting large liquor interests in New
York intimated to-day that a civil ac
tion against the United States govern
ment might be the next step in the
fight against prohibition, and that com
pensation for losses estimated at
$300,000,000. would be sought. The law
yers asserted that the decision of the
supreme court virtually confiscated the
liquor held (.here.
Local banking circles will be but
little affected by, the court's decision, it
was said. Large loans were outstand
ing on warehouse receipts earlier in
the year, but nearly all have been liqui
dated in recent months. .
The dismay with which the liquor
trade received the news yesterday in
creased to-day. So confident were the
"wets" that a favorable decision would
be handed down that preparations were
complete for delivery of thousands of
dollars' w-ortli of liquor at short not ice.
The dealers said it would now lie physi
cally impossible to ship the liquor in
stock to foreign countries before Jan
uary 16. , , '
The man who has been cultivating a
highly educated thirst in anticipation
of resumption of the sale over the bar,
bemoaned to-day the probability of exor
bitant prices for a drink "op the quiet."
Some quotations on the "unofficial"
market were: Champagne .$22) a case;
imported brandy $l.Mi a case; Scotch
whiskey f&V a case: rye whiskey $p
a bottle, and benedictine $30 a quart.
Individual prices in saloons depended
entirely upon the bartender.

NEW RECOMMENDATIONS
ON RAILROAD RETURN
There Is No Hint as to What Director
General Hines Favors Nor Does
Pres. Wilson Say What
He Plana to Do.
Washington, D. ft, Dec. 16. New rec
ommendations from Director General
Hines as to the return of the railroads
to private control are before President
Wilsin " Tnil Uer fr ITinna tmr Wllitl
House officials will sav what the recom
mendations are or whether they advo
cate a departure fwfff the president's
announced, purpose to return the roads
by Jan. 1. Nor has there been any in
dication as to when the president will
issue a proclamation surrendering the
roads or announce a change in his plans.
Some administration officials believe
the fate of railroad legislation in Con
gress will be a determining factor in
whatever is done. Many oflicials think
it would be disastrous industrially to
surrender the roads without adequate
legislation to meet their changed status.
Meantime, however, preparations are
going forward at the railroad admin
istration for turning the roads back m
accordance with the decision announced
by President Wilson in his message to
Congress last May.
(surrender of the roads would make
very little difference in actual operation,
in the opinion of officials, as the lines
now are being operated by their own
employes and except for a shift in re
ports there will be little change. The
legal ana accounting divisions ot the
railroad administration probably will
be materially increased when the rail
roads are surrendered, to wind up the
government accounts with the corpora
tion; but the other divisions will go
out of existence quickly, officials said.

EE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SIGN.
Case in Barre Illustrates How Badly
You May Be Fooled.
Business people should be very care
ful in signing their name to any docu
ment presented by strangers as in giv
ing money. A case in point occurred
this year when, during the late spring,
two young women appeared in Barre
and vicinity soliciting advertisements
for a certain publication. Some of the
advertisers paid at the time, and in
addition to signing an application
blank for the advertising, also signing
a plain sheet of paper. A number of
other business names appeared on the
latter. So far aa known, the advertise
ment never appeared in the publication
in question.
Four months after the original solici
tation a iiiun appeared collecting for
the advertisement even from those
who had originally paid and exhibit
ing a loose leaf copy of what was sup
posed to be the firm's advertisement.
When a copy of the publication was re
quested by the advertiser, some excuse
was made about it being sent later, etc.
The third act came shortly after when
unother man appeared with the large
plain sheet with the various names
thereon which he claimed represented
applications for advertisements in an
entirely dilferent publication, which, by
the way, was found to be non-existant.
He also had no copy oMhe alleged pub
lication to deliver. Thus, some of the
advertisers paid three times for some
thing which they never ootaincd.
While the character and nature of
the publications solicited for are skill
fully changed to harmonize with the
spirit of the times, the general method
of procedure remains the same. So be
careful what yrtii sign. The quarry
owners and granite manufacturers now
refer all such solicitors to their secre
tary for investigation.
HOSPITAL NEEDS:
ENDOWMENT
Executive Committee Re
ports Growing Need of
Financial Support
1919 EXPENDITURES
NOT QUITE MET
Although Public Was Gen
erous in Rendering
Support
The annual meeting of the Barre City
Hospital association was held in the
city court room last evening, when re
ports for the year were made and offi
cers eleetcdr The reports submitted by
the executive committee, the treasurer
and superintendent are printed below
and show the work of the hospital for
the year. The executive committee's
report says:
To the Trustees of the Barre City Hos
pital: "The year 1010 has been an unevent
ful one in the history of the hospital.
There have been no epidemics, but only
the usual routine of caring for the sick
and injured, though the number cared
for has been larger than in any normal
year since the opening of the hospital.
Through the aid given by the public
the year's finances are in better shape
than they were a year ago, though the
income has not fully met the expendi
ture of the year.
"The number of patients cared for
during the year just closed was 480, and
the number of days' nursing was 6,703,
or a daily average of 18-- patients.
The income from patients was 13,
350.00. The call for free service has
not been as large as in some years, but
a free bed was furnished for 316 days.
"In addition to the funds received
from the drive of last Deoemlier the
hospital has received a donation of ma
terials from the local Red Cross society,
the gift of several hundred dollars'
worth of gauze from the national Red
Cross, and larger than usual donation
of materials and supplies and food on
bag day. One gift of $100 from a for
mer citizen has been added to the en
dowment fund.
"The late Dr. Prentiss Kent of Mont
pelier provided in his will that event
ually his home place shall come to the
Barre City hospital, and the will of
Mrs. R. -W. Fowler of Worcester, who
passed away last April, provides for
a Stillman Wood fund of $1,000 to be
paid out of the estate to the hospital
and other contributions contingent
upon family linage. The ladies' aid has
continued its activities in behalf of the
hospital and is deserving of much praise
for its continued efforts.
"Nearly all public institutions are
to day seeking larger endowments to
meet the growing expense t-f maintain
ing them: Some move should be made
to secure an endowment sufficient to
permit the Barre City hospital to meet
its annual expenses and at the same
time allow of the hospital's extending
its usefulness to the public of Barre
and surrounding towns."

amendment becomes effective so that
people of small means might lay in a
stock for medicinal Uses, and the gov

the war-time act is constitutional, w
must submit to the inevitable," said

laid in (rtocks to run them for years,
and those of less means should' have
some opportunity."
