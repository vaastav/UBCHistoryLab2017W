Mr. fowler hs ptopow1 bill for the
ptirpoM of adding the elerneM of elas
ticity to the enrrency system, bat none
of his meainres have been enacted Into
law. Ills addreee at the Chicago meet
ing shows that he Is very mnch per
tnrbed over the present system, and
would have It changed radically, If
oongrees could be brought to his way
of thinking. .
Mr. rowlef. Insists that both the sliver

premncy, and he would have them both
retired. II declare that ft great cen
tral batik Is polttlcar Impossibility
and not ft gdentiflo aeoeeelty. He pre
dicts that disaster will follow unless
the country abandon Its system of
bonrt-seenred currency. On that point
he says:

The remedlea suggested by Mr.
fowler sre along the line of the m ens
ures tirged tinsaccpssfnlly by hint at
former sessions of congress. Borne
features of hie plan have been en
dorsed by the American Banker' asso
ciation, while others sre opposed by
that organlratlon. Ills plnn provides:
The rlsht. slioufll be elven to tiatlohal

rency eaunl at least to their cepltnl. Those
two poWMra would have the effect of br I tiff

If ouf banks were authorised to Corivert

A credit currency cannot In any wsr

Aside from any merit that may rest
I ft Mr.' Fowler's plafi, the country hs
been educated to place Its faith In cur

the recent experience with clearing

huhtor, It will require much more edu

Whatever may be said about defects
of the Atneilcun army It cannot be
charged with truth that It is not lit
fighting trim, or nt leant In fighting
humor. It bn been In that rondltlon
since It read this paragraph from the
president's latest message to congress:
Anton- the officers there should be se
vere examinations to weed out the unfit Up
le the grads of major. Front that position
en the appointments should b solely by
selection, and It should be understood that
a man of merely avcraae capacity could
never let beyond the position of major,
While every man who serves In any ataJe
a certain length' of time prior to promotion
to the nrxt rrade without gettln the pro
motion to the next grade should be forth
with retired. ,
The recommendation has already
aroused the opposition of practically
very commissioned officer of the
army, and while they are prohibited
from taking any part In influencing
legislation It msy be accepted as cer
tstn that all of thetr friends will be ral
lied to the work of bringing pressure
to defeat any measure that may be of
fered In congress In line with the pres
ident's suggestion. Th proposition
Is an assault upon long established
and revered precedent of the service
and the basis of nope of every West
Point graduate. As soon as a man geta
his second lleutenaht'a grade he knows
thet, In the ordinary course of events,
at the ago of 6i he may be retired as
ft colonel, even It he Is not more highly
honored by reason of some apodal ee
vice. Recognition of seniority In pro
motion Is accejited end approved by
the army as the fairest method of mak
tag such selectlonss. This Is recog
nised by the protests evoked 'by the
promotion of officers like General
Wood, Oenerwl Funston, General Per
shing aed others over the heads of
many officer of Ilk grade and much
longer servtc. . ,
Theoretically, the president's sug
gestion la without flaw, as It would
b highly desirable to hav the off!
cere of higher rsr.k elected by reason
of their special fltnesa, but even par
tial application t the plan of making
promotion by merit t generally erd
lted, ta rmy circles at least, as being
th chief source of discontent among
Officers. It Is charged, too, that th
weeding out frox-ess recommended by
th .president ts already being wccom
pllshed nder existing lawa regulating

A OOVT ttSDA r CLOU .to.
Considerable apprehension exist
throughout the city on account of the
threatened enforcement of th long
forgotten bin Jaw by th city authori
ties. Mahy people are much disturbed
over th situation, ftod some of them
with good reason. To check all city
actlvltle on Sunday would result la
hardship and privation beyond under
standing. In th matter of jnUX
wsgocs, alone, suffering would be en
tailed to an extent that Is scarcely con
templated even by the xealots who sr
pushing the movement. Shutting
down the street cars would cut off
means of communication and travel
would bo limited to such excursions
could b don on foot. In many other
way tUe cltitens would. bo hamporsd
without any return In th way of In
creasing good morals or good be
havior. Chief Donahue, acting under direc
tions of Mayor Dahlman, has devised
ft plan which will result eventually in
giving the Sunday law a thorough test
without unnecessarily embarrassing
anybody, On Sunday he will plaoe
under constructive arrest ft representa
tive of each of several occupation and
turn over to City Prosecutor Daniel
a list of name of these individual.
What proceeding will be taken by Mr.
Daniel has not yet been outlined, but
he will undoubtedly move with U due
expedition to secure an early test of
the law. in th meantime the busi
ness of Omaha will go forward with
out Interruption until th caso I
finally determined by th .court.
The effort In the first place was' so
manifestly Intended to harass th pub
llo that the determination of th au
thorities to defeat this phase of th
program Is commendable. It was not
alleged that the csus of morality or
good citizenship was .suffering In any
way through the bonobservanco of ft
law which has been neglected forever,
nor Is It expected that Omaha will b
any better In any regard through It
enforcement. Mayor Dahlman and
Chief Donahu are acting wisely In
taking steps to, teat the statute with
out unduly disturbing conditions that
exist. Whatever else may happen, the
enforcement of the statute In Omaha
will not be attended by th spectacular
sensational episode that have .marked
proceedings In Kansas City.

The dogged optimism of the public

The announcement of the December
dividend disbursements and the bank
ctcarlnae of the Country for last week
sre two significant Indication ot th
tact that buslnees I again on th up
grade. The December dividends and
Interest payments will aggregate $87,
011,240, as compared with til, 174,
701 In December of l0t and $55,
485,641 In December of 1805. The
total Is th largest on record foe De
cember in spite of the fact that aev
eral'of the largest dividend paying
companies have passed their dividends,
owing to th stringency la the money
market. Nearly all ot the copper com
panies, whose dividends amounted to
nearly $5,000,000 last December, have
passed their dividends thla year. This
deficit has been made up and an In
crease over the rcord shewn by the
dividends ot smaller companies that
have had ft most prosperous year and
did Vot figure In the paying list last
j;ear. Railroad companies pay about
$40,000,000 ot the total December
dividends.
Bank clearings tor the last week re

country for the first week In December
showed a Increae ot $740,000,00 a

The Blxtloth congress contains th
largest membership In th history of that
body and bas an unusually large Injection
of new men. Th senate, which will soon
contain nlnety-tw member. Is larger than
tho house waa for some year after the
beginning of constitutional government,
and It haa lost many of Its original char
acteristics. ' The senators are no longer
"ambassadora from the atatca," no Ion per
are men, whose namea ar on every tongue.
It would take an unusually well Informed
man some time to name one-third of -the
membership. The old leaders have almost
entirely passed away. ThS veteran are
now Allison, Aldrlch, Hale, Frye. Cullom,
Taller, and Daniel, the two latter being
democrats. All tha rest have taken their
seats since 1890, and only twenty all told
have Served mora than ten years.
In the house the veterans are Cannon,
Bingham, Payne and Dalaell, while Kelfer
la back from Ohio after a long- absence.
It Is a rare distinction for a man to serve
twenty yeara consecutively In the house,
and in the last two yeara death and other
causes have removed a number of the
veterans, while there are more than 100
absolutely now merw--It would be a hard
task for any one to nam fifty men who
have seata, and perhaps 'the average per
son could not mention score. -In these
days there Is less Chance for personal dis
tinction than formerly. The work ts
largely 'Hone In commute and the foren-
relc debates are seldom exoltlng. '" i
Forty yeara or ao ago congress waa
largely composed of veterana of tho civil
war or men who had come Into civil prom
inence during that conflict; Th men wer
mostly bearded and full of passion. Th
slightest spark would set off a volcano
et excitement, the bloody shirt waa waved
and vituperation was Indulged In with
great cheerfulness arid In unlimited quan
tities. Visitors to the galleries alwaya
asked to have polnteed out such men as
Blaine, Conkllng, Butler, Stephens, lunar,
and others who had become prominent.' In
tha aenata wer Sumner, Bherman, An
thony, Burnalde, Morrill, Ingalla, Edmunds,
Logan, Cameron, Brown, and at varloua
times two negroes. These men were the
leadera tn politics and statesmanship, and
they hav left no successors of their own
type.
Not on of th veterana In either house
ts a noted 'speaker. Few of, them ever
talk at all, except In explalntMr aomejblll.
Tlia senate has beoom the deliberative
body, but the tloquenoe comes from ths
younger men from the prairies and th
far west, men eoms of whom were scarcely
born forty yeara ago, and th rest were
tn knickerbockers at school.
These changes are notable, but tho pass
ing away of th ancient regime ia not to b
lamented. There are, perhaps, fewer. In
tellectual giants, fewer forensic orators
than formerly, but, on the whole. It I a
body of able men. who are la Waahlngton
tor business. The lobby Is discredited and
the work of legislation la carried on per
sistently and, on the whole, very well.
