An Income and an inheritance tax
are certainties of the near future.
President Roosevelt in his message
advocates these very vigorously and
Congress will be compelled to heed
his advice for it knows that the people
are behind the President in his senti
ments. With a change on the Su
preme Court bench since It declared
an Income tax unconstitutional, there
Is every reason to believe that a well
drafted law providing for graded tax
ation of Incomes and Inheritances will
pass review by that tribunal. Both as
a source of revenue and an equaliza
tion of the tax burden not to speak
of it as a preventative of vast accum
ulations of wealth among a few, an
income and an Inheritance are meas
ures that meet with popular approval.
THE
PREVENTION OF RAILROAD
ACCIDENTS.
Mien may come and men may go
and railroad accidents, as well as
great, loss of .human live ami prop
If misery loves company, Santa Fe
ought 'to 'be happy In 'the fact that
there are some very great and big
el'tiea in the country that -are being
hurt by their own administrations
erty go with them. Th'i record grows and by the knockers and tax dodgers
more appaling and awfiil yew by year
und the ratio of fatal accidents grows
more than apace with the construction
and oporatlon of new railroads and
the extension of older lines. When,
whore and how this holocaust Is to
bo stopped cannot at this time be
Imagined even by the ibest imsted
men in governmental and railroad
'circles.
The Brooklyn Stamlard-t'n-liin ior
trays the situation vividly and cor
rectly In a recent editorial when it
says that the old-time English dic
tum, "these railway accidents will con
tinue till t)- kill a bishop," ghastly
as is the epigram, may give a ray of
hope just now for the passing of the
continual butchery on American
roads. They have killed a railroad
president on his own line. Will what
might be called the public sentiment
of railroad management be Impressed?
Railroads ihave now been operated
in this country for three generations,
and there is never anything new in
train accidents. By classification,
nearly half sudi accidents are collis
ions, more than any other one kind;
and of collisions, nearly half are rear
end collisions, far more than any
other kind. They happen with the
block svstem; such was the case yes-
terdav It will sometime be realized
that whoever is underpaid, and who
ever must be overworked, tlie em
ploye 'responsible for passing a train
into a block must never have wis iac-
ulties dulled 'by overwork, and that it
will ,1m economy to hire only mien of
the class who can demand good pay.
The old lesson of the Importance
of stability in car construction is
again emphasized. Next to never
having collisions, the best thing Is to
.have trains of such great and equal
soliditv all through that When they
do come together the result will 'be a
.hnnvn inRteni! of a rending and a
splintering. The rear car in which
President Snencer was traveling was
atruiMhpd: no construction short of
that of a .battleship could stand the
immediate impact of such a projec
tile. But the strongly-built cars ahea
of it repelled the shock backward
and nassed it along forward, them
selves undamaged. Forward, and just
behind -tlhe postal car, was the "Jim
Crow" car, with baggage In front and
nezroes were crushed under tne ava
lanche of trunks. It Is Impressive,
though, merely illustrative of fatniliaT
principles of physics, to see how, In a
collision, the shock leaps along a line
of cars, unerringly picking out the
nno which is weak anJ spending the
furv of the stress in crushing that
one.
it cost so much money, and so
much life, to demonstrate w'tat is well
known theoretically, that doti'btloss in
time the principles which inhere in
railroad accidents will ibe regarded as
established without need of further
practical proof.
who Hive within tikdr li'inils. lo be
sure, such a comparison may be called
unjust (by some, but in a 'ratio It can
be used to advantage right here.
What has been and Is now the rule
In San Francisco tor Instance, never
:is been and could not happen in
Santa Fe, 'but that 'this city nas ueen
rlously injured by inefficient, inei-
fective and worthless city administra
tions Is too patent a fact, to lie suc-
ssfully denied. That there ha not
been very much grafting or very much
corruption is easily explained by the
fact that there lias been littlo for a
ticcessful graft or for insidious cor
ruption.
The Atchlwn, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway has built magnificent hotels
several of the cities along its route
New Mexico and Arizona. That is
nil right, commendable and appreciat-
Right 'here, it is well again to
the attention of the management
to the fact that a modern and new
brick railroad depot is very much
needed in this city. The present
structure was erected by the Santa
Fe Railway upon the first arrival of
Its tracks In this city 2" years ago.
It has certainly paid for itself several
times over. The prosperity of the
mad Is unmet edented and there is
no reason for the hesitancy and hold
ing back displayed in this case. The
ciity of Santa Fe is entitled to a new
depot from the Atchison, ioik-iui
Santa Fe Railway and this should he
supplied this winter.
Vncle fain does not want Mo turn
the Pacific coast into a Japanese coio-
y, for lie has race problems enougli
to deal with already and tlie Japanese
are as clannish and more fanatic than
the Chinese, but nevertheless, sucli
Japanese as are in the United States
must -be treated with respect and he
given a square deal, if not on senti
mental grounds then for selfish com
mercial reasons. The United btates

and has tremendous Interests on the

OPPOSITION BASED ON LIES,
A couple of yellow sheets sailing
under Democratic colors are howling
themselves still yellower by charging
that the sum of $25,000 of the Terr!
torial funds will be thrown away were
a constitutional convention 'to 'be held
next January in this city. They do
not know what they are talking about
as usual, or they are lying malicious
ly as is also often the case. There
lias been no demand made for .money
and it is believed 'that were a consti
tutional convention to be lield every
member would be willing to do with
out his per diem and pay his own ex
penses. Tlie great good that would
come to the people of the Territory
bv the adoption of a modern, fair
progressive and strong constitution
by Its promulgation and iby its sub
mission to Congress can well be
thought out by any fair minded and
patriotic citizen who wishes 'to do so.
On the other hand those opposed
manv of them tax dodgers and knock
ers, are heralding forth all sorts of
misfortunes that would befall the
Territory and are objecting strenu
ously to the squandering of territorial
funds when they have nothing at all
whereupon to base their assertions or
to make these charges.
Oklahoma statesmen have sug.
gested a new idea in the way of locat
ing the permanent capital of the state
of Oklahoma. One of the delegates
to the constitutional convention has
introduced a proposition empowering
the state railway commission to
created, to select 2560 acres at the
geographical center of the new state
to divide this area into town lots and
to sell these, the proceeds to pay for
the erection of the Capitol and other
public buildings. This might work all
right except that' the geographical
center of the state may be a swamp
or a barren hilltop or forty miles from
the nearest railroad, In which case
there would be some nice difficulties
to overcome. From this distance
looks that Oklahoma could do nothing
wiser than to leave the capital where
it is. at Guthrie, thus saving expense,

that necessarily follow a change

Uneasy lies the head of the man
who owns a coal claim or two these
flays' In the Southwest.
The President Insists Chat the
$148,000 'contributed to the Republi
can campaign fund in the last Presi
dential campaign by the Mg insurance
companies be turned back immediate
ly and with Interest, Postmaster
General Cortelyou, chairman of the
national committee, and Treasurer
Bliss of the same committee, demur,
not because the committee is unable
financially to return the money, for it
has a balance of $400,000 in bank, but
because of important legal questions
that have arisen In. connection with
these contributions and the decision
of which is pending. However, tlie day
of big campaign contributions by life
insurance companies Is gone forever.
If this city must tolerate licensed
iniorallty, it should by ordinance con
fine the red light distance within
narrow limits and the city authorities
should arouse the district attorney to
a sense of duty to prevent houses of
ill repute from being established
within the distance of houses of pub
lic worship defined by law. As a
tomrist and health resort and educa
tional center, Santa Fe cannot anoru
to tolerate open vice, except at a cost
of Its future prospects. It may be dif
ferent in other cities but in Santa
Fe. the elearner the city, morally and
otherwise, the greater the n unifier of
well-to-do residents who will be at
tracted to Invest their money hero.
The traveling public and the city
of Sana Fe, owe thanks to General
Manager J. E. Hurley, for ordering
direct connection with mail line
trains 3, the Flyer, and 10, the fast
mall train from the south, preventing
long and tedious waits to passengers
who have business at the Capital or
come for pleasure or sightseeing pur
poses. It sliows that Mr. Hurley takes
an interest in the welfare or this city
and perhaps, In tlie not far distant
future, hi.-? interest will go so far as
to result in a modern depot for San
ta Fe.
PRIZE MONEY NEVER CLAIMED.
British Admiralty Hat 8umi on Hand
for Destroying Slave 'Ships.
The days when prize money was
looked upon in the navy as an ordi
nary source of income are recalled by
a notification from the British ad
miralty of money waiting to be claimed
the proceeds of bounties for the de
struction of pirates and of the sale of
stave ships.
There is a sum of $25,000 from the
sale of Blaving vessels captured in the
'60s awaiting claimants, also a goodly
amount of naval prize money and
bounty for the destruction of pirates
which nobody applies for.
Some of those to whom money is
due are, no doubt, still alive, but i(
they are dead they probably left de
scendants who if the names were ad
vertised would be forthcoming to sub
stantiate their claims. '
As it Is, there Is little demand for
ihe money In hand. During 12 montha
dealt with in the statement issued
from Whitehall under $40 have been
paid out. Court Journal.
DAYS OF MALE DANDIES.
Feminine Display Outdone by Duke oi
Buckingham.
Until the last century, In variety
and magnificence, the human male
followed the rule of the lower animals
that the male shall predominate In
brilliance. No woman has ever ruled
through pure modishness; there
has never been a feminine counter-
oart of Beau Brummel. All varieties
of exquisite are male, whether dandy,
macaroni or beau and not because
they are exceptions to a general rule
of sobriety, but because of a superior
originality aid more forcible and dis
tinguished expression.
In the point of extravagance there
never has been (until the last cen
tury) any difference between male
and female costume. The duke of
Buckingham took 27 suits of clothes
to Paris in 1C25, one of white uncut
velvet set all over with diamonds,
worth 14,000. He also wore a dia
monded feather and diamond buttons
and earrings. A curious fashion for
men prevailed in 1612 of ornamenting
the ear with strings of black velvet
ribbon, also of placing a rose behind
the ear.
ORIGIN OF POSTAGE 8TAMPS.
Secret Sign on an Envelope the Cause
of Present System.
Quite recently there has been more
or less discussion as to the origin of
the postage stamp.
Perhaps the most authentic story is
lhat which comes from the post office
department at Washington,
It appears that about 65 years ago
Rowland Hill was traveling through
one of the northern districts of Eng
land and for a time was sojourning at
an inn where the postman came with
a letter for a young miss, who turned
It over and over in her hand and after
examining the envelope minutely In
quired the price of the postage, which
was a shilling. She sighed sadly and
returned the letter to the postman,
saying that it was from her brother,
but that she had no money.
Mr. Hill was an onlooker and was
touched with pity. He paid the
postage and his action seemed to em
barrass the girl. When the postman
had gone she told Mr. Hill that some
signs marked on the envelope con
veyed to her all she wanted to know
and that as a fact there was no writ
ing Inclosed. In extenuation she said
that she and her brother bad con
trived a code system of communicat
ing, as neither of them were able to
pay post charges.
Mr. Hill thought of the results of a
system which made such frauds pos
sible. Before another day he had
planned a postal system upon the pres
ent basis. Harper's Weekly.
PLANT8 THAT TAKE PILLS.
The Pecos Valley complains of a
coal famine even worse than that of
central New Mexico.' With enough
coal in sight in the Territory to sup
ply any conceivable local demand for
a thousand years. It is an anomaly
indeed that, there should be a short
age of coal so early in the winter. Af
ter the government, gets to operating
coal -mines or coal mines are operated
under federal supervision the chronic
coal shortage may cease but it will
be tedious and cliiHy waiting until
that day. To parody a well known
couplet: "Coal, seams, coal seams ev
erywhere and not a pound to burn!"
The passenger department of the
Denver & Rio Grande Railroad Is not
devoid of humor, even though it Is
grim humor, as the following reply It
sends to applicants for passes Indi
cates: "Everybody walks but father;
He rides around all day.
Big mogul on a railroad, ,
He don't have to pay.
Little Johnny's walking;
Also Brother Will.
So's the Whole Dam family
Since Hepburn passed his bill."
Senator Beveridge's amendment to
the meat Inspection bill requiring
that, all packed or canned meat be
marked with the date of Inspection,
will fee a good thing for the newspa
pers if passed. It will compel every
dealer to advertise In order to keep
his goods moving. The dealer who
does not advertise, generally findsliis
goods remaining on the shelves in
definitely. As long as they were not
marked with date of InsHctlon or
manufacture they were not a dead
loss but no one will buy meat or oth
er canned goods that are known to be
a year or two old.
The 37t.h Legislative Assembly
should see to It. that, the rights and
interests of people who desire to car
ry fire insurance, lie somewhat 'bet
ter protected than they are at pres
ent. The fire insurance companies
are a great power unto themselves
and the people "pay the freight,"
Their premium charges In New Mexi
co are exorbitant; indeed, beyond
reason. Relief should be had. Hero
Is a hint to the 37th Legislative As
sembly.
The Las Vegas Optic has come
around to see the wisdom of holding
a constitutional convention. It said
editorially in last evening's issue:
"And what would Congress think of
New Mexico's sincerity in Its plea for
statehood, if told that a solemn and
explicit plntform pledge of the Repub
lican Party to hold a constitutional
convention has been disregarded for
trivial or weighty reasons?"
The President broke a 'precedent by
sending to the Senate his vacation ap
pointments before the reading of ills
message and the Senate got even by
'breaking another precedent 1n refus
ing to confirm Hie cabinet appoint
ments on the day they were sent in.
These are some of the little amenities
of life that are the cause of the
strenuous times at the national capi
tal of the past few years.
Missouri makes $30,000 a month
from Its beer Inspection law. Here is
a suggestion for New Mexico poli
ticians. Vh() wouldn't be beer inspec
tor rather than coal oil inspector, es
pecially if the Territory could make a
few thousands a month on the side by
having such an official with a sum
clent number of deputies?
The next Legislative Assembly will
not suffer for lack of good advice. Its
principal task will be to discriminate
among the advisors and the advice
given. It. is a good sign when tlie
press and the people discuss before
hand tlie nature of the legislation
wanted and needed.
There is this much comfort In the
fact that the cost of living is getting
higher and tlhait is that It Is a sign
of prosperity and that every one who
cares to work 'can have work. No
able bodied person need to go hungry
even if there has been an increase in
the price of the necessaries of life. In
China, staples are cheap, dirt cheap,
and yet there are at present twenty
million Ohinamen who are starving
for lack of food.
Tlie Japanese tempest In a tea
pot will help President Roosevelt's
plans In one direction, at least. It
is already making Congress favor
able to a larger naval establishment
and to the ship subsidy bill. Not be
ing disposed to kowtow to the Mika
do, the nation will have to strengthen
itself on the sea in order to prevent
Japan from becoming overbearing.
The county of Santa Fe hlsl enjoyed
an economical and well administered
county government during the past
few years. The New Mexican believes
this will be the case during the com
ing two years when the new Repub
lican officials elected last November
assume office.

The long and short of it is that
there are too few railroads and too
few cars and the remedy Is to build
more railroads and buy more cars. It
seems simple does it no?

Old Man Made a Guees.
Prof. Brander Matthews, along with
his belief in spelling reform, believes
in short words and in simple con
structions. The simplicity of his
prose style as it is manifested in his
books is only equaled by Its grace.
Apropos of simplicity, Prpf. Mat
thews said the other day: "In my
youth I once passed the summer In
the country. One of my friends, an
elderly farm hand, visited New York
during my country visit and on his
return I said to him, employing a
word needlessly complex and long:
'Well, Jabez, how did you like the
metropolis?'
" 'Wot say?' asked the old man.
" 'How did you like the metro po.
lis?" I repeated.
"'Twa'n't open,' said he."
Latest Wrinkle Devised by the Art
of the Florist.
A very large and sturdy orange
tree was growing in a small pot.
"If that tree," said the florist,
"didn't take pills it would require
a pot as big as a bathtub to grow In.
But it takes pills like a hypochron
drlac.
. "Chemists, agricultural experts now
make plant pills pills no bigger than
chestnuts, that contain sustenance for
six months, a kind of tabloid food.
These chemists analyze a plant's ash,
and make pills of the constituent
salts. The pills, Inclosed in a
metal cover, are burled In the earth
at the plant's roots, and the salts
gradually dissolve and diffuse through
the metal, giving the plants day by
day the sustenance that they re
quire.
Pills are also applied to weak,
sickly plants, which they help wonderfully.
Ignorance at a Premium.
Education, according to Comman
der Gambler, wag not valued in the
British navy In the '60s. The future
commander began his life at sea
aboard the Retribution with an edu
cation wktch Included Greek, an ac
quirement of which "our second mas
ter, -who had joined the navy straighl
out of a merchant ship," made light
'We don't want none of this here
kind of hogwaBh at sea,' said my
friend. I also quickly discovered
that to know anything about musk
beyond being able to sing a comic
song or play a hornpipe on a tin
whistle was likewise an offense;
while the crowning Infamy was tc
be able to talk French or any for
eign tongue."
Safety In Coupling.
A new and useful invention is now
being tested on the railroads and
tramways of Belgium, which promise?
to do away with the most prolific
cause of accidents during shunting.
The apparatus is in two parts, the
first an automatic coupling ar
rangement, and the other an aut
matic brake whereby if a coupling
snaps the detached vehicles are at
once brought to a standstill.
On a trial trip in which nearly all
the chief railway officials participated,
all sorts of testa were made and the
arrangement was declared to be
complete success.
Effect of Jealousy.
"It's such a good joke on the Pitts-
burgs," says the first lady.
"What is? That they are on the
verge Of separation?" asks her friend.
"Indirectly, yes. You know each of
them has engaged a private detective
to watch the other, and day before
yesterday their two detectives put in
a whole afternoon following them in

other one, It costs them $40 apiece
to learn that they had taken, an auto

Derivation of Words.
Arnold White remarks that "an ad
mlral Is an emir of the sea. "Ad
miral," or rather the older "aralral"
(the "d" Is an Intruder), is one of
many familiar words of Arabic origin.
It represents "amlr-al-bahr," com
mander of the sea. The dropping of
the "baar" has left in this case a
mutilated form meaning literally only
commander of the ." In other
words the Arabic definite article and
the following substantive still trana-.
lute together. Thus there is "alge
bra," the reduction; "alkali," the plant
es; "alembic," the cup; "alcohol,"
for "alkohl," literally "the burned
thing;" and "elixir," which stands for
allkslr," the philosopher's stone or
powder.
How the Noblemen Rank.
"After royalty comes dukes. - The
premier duke Is Norfolk, the fifteenth
lof his line. After dukes come mar
quises. After marquises come earls.
After earls come viscounts. After
viscounts come barons. After bar
ons come baronets. After baronets
come knights.
"This, then, is the order: Duke,
marquis, earl, viscount, baron, bar
onet, knight. I don't mention lords.
A lord is an earl the earl of Craven,

Craven or else the title la only the

use of Hertzean waves. Miniature
wireless telegraphy plants are to be
installed on vessels, effective within
a thousand yards radius. Two ves
sels fitted with apparatus approach
ing each other in a fog and with the
mechanism set would at 1,000 yards

Reason for Madness.
Richard Mansfield at a dinner party
in New York contributed an anecdote
to the old question ot the sanity of
Hamlet.
"One morning In the west." he
said, "I met a young friend of mine
and asked him where he bad been
the night before."
" 'I went,' my young friend replied,
'to see So-and-so's Hamlet.'
" 'Aha, did you?' said I, 'Now, tell
me do you think Hamlet was mad?'
'"I certainly do,' said he. 'There
wasn't $100 in the house.'"
Love.
"Yes," said the Chicago girl, "I'm
engaged to Mr. Rocks. It was really
hard to decide because I like Mr. Bul
lion quite as well and they're equally
wealthy."
"What decided the thing?" asked
her friend.
"Well. Mr. Rocks promised me the
most alimony If such a thing should
become necessary."
