THEY MAKE A FINAL
PROTEST
Spanish Cummissoners Ask
For an Investigation.
Paris, Dt'C. 9 Rios, president of
rhe Spa.ni.sh peace commission, and
Pjeda the seet-Ptary, are still confined
to their beds. Ojsria's sickness
delays the ent'rossintr of the treaty,
and it is doubiful whether it will be
signed before Monday. The Ameri
cans held the usual tension this morn-
ng. The Spaniards continue roaKing
birtor comments concernine President
McKinley's reference to the Maine.
The SDaniards tns.de a last coDtribu-
tioit in the recent a.semblinir of the
commissions when Rios presented a
vigorously worded protest, in which
tbe SDaniards declared they had
yielded to force, but they invoked the
conscience of the natioos against the
abuse of the rights of a nation, of
which they were the victims Tbe
protest was for the purpose of record,
and consisted of an argument in sup
port of every concession demanded by
the Spaniards and which the Ameri
cans refused. The protest concluded:
But these concessions which we
were obliged to make touches us less
than tbe insult which has been afflicted
on our nation by President McKinley j
in bis message. We agim protest
against the accusation hurled at us in
regard to the Maine, and we intend to
lisuin submit the matter to an inter
national tribunal, composed of Eng-
I land; France and Germany, to deter-
mine who shall bear the responsibility
for the catastrophe."
In spite of the secrecy ' observed by
! the Americans, it is learned that, the
trodty in substance consists of 3 or 14
articles. The principal articles pro
vide for the cpssion and evacuation of
Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philippine
islands, and the political, udministra
tive and financial vesulis thereof, and
acquisition by the United Stats of

Articles of secondary importance de

CHICACO, Dec. 9. A special to the
Tribune from Washington says: Gen
eral John R. Brooke will bo male the
military governor of Cuba, and he is
now on -his wy here-to.-cofjeulB rfie
president in regard to the policy to be
pursued.
General Brooke wrote a letter to a

;ed General Fiubuh Lee for jfov. i-uoi

General Brooke ii expected to arrive

I
I DISCONTENT IN
PORTO RICO
Reside atsDisatisfied With
Brooke's Appoint
ments. Washington, Dec. 12. A San Juan
de Porto Rico correspondent to the
Associated Press, writing under date
of Dec. i. says:
Tbe p:ist week in San Juan has
shown certain developments in tbe
general situation of the islands, and
drifting straws havo been seen to in
dicate the current of growing discon
tent. There has b.en much trouble
all over tbe island since the American
government assumed a military protec
toiate, concerning tha appointment
of mayors and couacilmen of the 'dif
ferent municipalities of which there
are id all 72. Men so uDpointed and
those already iu nrflce have been re
signing and pquabling among them
selves, and expressing their displeasure
at the eppointmeot of some colleague.
The fact that General B.-ooke declined
to grant to the council at Ponce the
privileges of the autonomist constitu
tion,, which they were arrogating to
themselves, Is what rankles ever pres
ent in th minds of tbo defeated
autonomists. The accordance of tnis
privilege would have been for them a
great victory. The best judgment
here sustains General Brooke in this
action.
Tbe autonomist party set9 np a pro.
longed howl of discontent in . which,
among other things, they declared
that f.Iunoz Rivera, leader of General
Brooke's cabinet, had betrayed them,
inasmuch as be bad used bis influence
to bring about the decision against
their demands. Rivera is an element
of political discord. Six months ago
ha theatrically, declared he would die
wrapped in the fla of Spain, and
he was the first Porto Rican to
swear allegiance to the United States.
Tie is at present secretary of state, and
since October 17 the bead of General
Brooke's advisory board io tbe insular
affairs He is a capable man and a
schemer. He probably long ago de
termined to become the political ruler
of Porto Rico.

Washington, Dec. 11. Tu vi-w ..'
the siirnaiurts of the po''. - u-tt.
tbe government will tie obliged vrt
speedily to take steps looking to tne
restoration of tbe diplomatic machin
ery necessary to friendly relations
with tspain. The recent visit, to the
White bouse, of General Woodford,
late mit:i stereo, .MarVid, has been er
roneously construed to indicate th
determination on the part of the
president to return the minister to
Madrid.
As a matter of fact that 'a itnprob
able, as tbe whole line of diplomatic
precedent is in the direction of wiping
out all the old issues and senrtmg
afresh after tbe war with new minis
ters on both sides. The reappoint
ment of Woodford might -mean ibe
return to Washington of Polo y Ber
nabe, whose residence in Canada dur
ing the war rendered him so obnox
ious to the American public.
If custom is followed, either the
United States minister to Midrid or j
tbe Dext Spanish minister to Wash
ington will be accredited tia special
enyoy to exchange the ratification of
the treaty just completed at Paris.
Having fulfilled this function, he will
then present bis credentials aa minis

sion, another wait ensued. At e:dU
the engrossing had been completed,
and 15 minutes later it was signed.
The long session Saturday afternoon
and the subsequent recess were due
only to the fact that each article of
the treaty had to be carefully read and
compared in Spanish and finglisb, and '
to the fact that tne engrossing of the
last article in Spanish was incomplete.,
It is expected that the session which
has just reconvened will only last a :
few minutes. :

Two O K & Trains t ullide VVlttout
killing Anybody.
A remarkabio railroad r.rvid-.'m oo
curreu mi the O. Iv. oi . iir.w six
miles east of Pendl ton Saturday
mgbt, remarkable because it whs S'i
serious, arid noboilv was killed. When
the overland pasenger. train No. 1,
was coming alo.;g at a lively rate over
V-down grade leading from the Blue
mountains to Pendleton, it ran into a
band f horses that gave it a pretty
bad shaking up. and while damages
were being, rjpaired a wjst bound
'eight came gliding along down the
incline, expecting a clear track. Just
as tbe freight rounded a curve, the
engineer saw the passenger a few
hundred yards ahead. He reversed
bis engine, applied the brakes, and
just before he struck the passenger
be and tbe fireman jumped from the
oi1), saving themselves.
, Fortunately the speed of the freight
was checked, and all it did on striking
the passenger was to jam the rear car
so hard as to force the train ahead so
that nearly all the car platforms were
mashed. Fortunately there was no
one in the rear end of the last car, else
some one would have been killed, for
tbe rear of. tbe car was mashed
In, but as it was tbe passengers
were . badly shocked, and most of
hem we're .hurled to the floor with
considerable violence. Oae boy was
quite severely hurt and a large num.
ber of the passengers were more or
less bruised.
. When the train arrived here Sunday
If evening, 13 hours late, it was a dilapi
dated looking affair, and tbe passe n
I gera presented a sorry appearance.
J By the accident the connection with
tbe beating pipes were broken, leaving
the passengers tit the mercy of the
elemen's, and most of them were about
frozen.
PECULIAR P0IM3.
UKNKRATKD IN THE HUMAN BODY.
The Result of Imperfect Digestion of
Food.
Every living thing, plant or animal,
contains within itself the germs of
decay and death.
In the human body these germs of
disease and death (called by scientists
Ptomaines, are usually tne result of
Imperfect digestion of food; the result
of indigestion aod dyspepsia.
!l The stomach, from abuse, weakness,
iXtea cot thoroughly digest the food.
The result ia a heavy, sodden mass
which ferments (tne first process of
decay) poisoning the blood, making it
thin, weak and lacking in red corpus
cles; poisoning the brain causing head
aches and pain ia the eyes.
Bad digestion irritates the heart,
causing palpitation and finally bring
ing on diiease of this very important
organ.
Poor digestion poisons the kidneys,
causing Brigbt's disease and diabetes
And this is so because every organ,
every nerve depends upon the stomach
alone for ; nourishment aud renewal,
and weak digestion shows itself not
only in loss of appetite and flush, but
in weak nerves and muddy complex
ion. Tbe great English scientist, Huxley,
said the best start in life is a sound
stomach. Weak ston-acbs fail to di
gest food properly, because th:y lack
the proper quantity of digestive acids
(lactic and hydrocnlorir) aod pepto
genie product; the most sensible
remedy in all cases of indigestion, it
to take a'ter each meal, one or two cf
Stuart s Dyspepsia Tablets, because
they supply In a pleasant, harmless
form all the elements that eak stom
achs lack.
Tbe regular use of Stuart's Dyspep
sia Tablets will cure every form of
stomach trouble except cancer of the
stomach.
O They increase flesh. Insure pure
blood, strong nerves, a bright eye aod
a clear complexion.
Nearly all druggists sell Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets at 50 cents full
sized package or by mail by enclosing
price to Stuart Co.. Marshall, Mich.,
