WASHINGTON.
Opening of the fewlon of CoMffrca*.
Washington, December 5. ? The
; third and last session of the Forty-first
! Congress opened to-day. The day was
a magnificent one, the air being as
warm and balmy as a day in Jane. At
an early hour the avenue was thronged
with people wending their way to the
Capitol, and long before either House
was called to order every available seat
in the galleries was occupied. The
large number of colored people present,
especially in the lower house, where the
first representative of their race waa to
be sworn into office, was a marked fea
ture of the occasion. But in this the
colored people were disappointed, as the
successor of Whittemore did not make
his appearance during the dav. The
diplomatic gallery was well filled, the
most prominent in that quarter and oc
cupying front seats being Ministers
Thornton, Trellhard, Gerolt and their
ladies. The roll call in the House
9howed 173 members present, while in
the Senate but few members were ab
sent
The N?tM(f and Its H?c?*pilon.
The reading of the President's mes
sage occupied an hour, and was listened
to with marked attention. The effect
was better in the House than in the
Senate. In the latter body the general
dissatisfaction was very evident. The
oulv part of the message which appear
ed to put everybody in a good humor
was that concluding portion relating to
preserving the purity of elections? that
every man entitled to vote can vote just
once at each election. At this little.al
lusion there was a broad smile on
the faces of every member, lhe
pat-ages re/erring to revenue re-,
form were not well received
and were not "considered in the best of .
taste. So far as protection is concerned ,
the protectionists are in very good spir- 1
its over the Presidents statement of
their position. The eagerness to catch
all that was advanced with regard to
the Ababama claims was very great.
When that portion of the message was
reached, the members looked earnestly
toward the clerk, while the representa
tives in the diplomatic gallery leaned
forward with their their hands to their
e irs as if anxious not to lose a word. ^
The iortion relating to the fishery ques- 1
tion took everybody bv surprise, and it
was the general remark that ^the author
ship thereof was too much of the Butler
Mtvle not to be easily recognizable.
The general comment to-tight on the
message is that it is more of an elec-j
tioneering document than a State paper,
and that where it does not make a |
plausible statement it succeeds in evad
ing issues most ingeniously. I he mass
of glittering generalities contained in
tljedocument.it is said, will ma ei
strong paper with the people, and if it
is not anv more logical than a stump
speech, it will prove equally as convinc
ing. The document is generally summed
up as adroit in its statements, ekillful in
it* arrangements, and forcible, if not
logical, in its arguments, lhe only
portions which have given anv general
surprise are those relating to the hsber,
question. It is thought that here a
very strong case indeed is made out
against the provinces.

A Personal ExplBn?ilon.
Representative Roderick R Butler,
of Tennessee, is here but did not an
-wer to his name yesterday. His
friends say he will appear in the House
to-dav and make an explanation, during
which he will refer to the damaging
charges which have been made against
him in connection with the pension
trauds, and demand an investigation by
Congress into the whole subject.
Loeaii ?o Nncc^ed^y-te* in the Hen
The election of General Logan to the
United States Senate from Illinois, in
p'.ace of Yates, is regarded as certain.
Of one hundred and twenty-five Repub

lature, eighty are claimed by Logan ?
friends as pledged to him. The re
mainder are divided between
Palmer, (General Oglesby and Genera
Romer.
Senator .Sumner's Bill
Senator Sumner states that the ob
ject of hie bill, introduced yesterday,
but upon which he could not claim ac
tion, is to stop the pre-wes in the T reasury
Department and prevent future printing
of L'nited States currency in the place
of worn out notes. He believes this
course will gradually contract currency
and bring about specie payments. The
bill also provides for amending the
funding law by increasing live per cent
bonds from two hundred million to five
hundred million dollars. The Senator
due9 not believe that bonds bearing
lower rates of intere.-t can be negotiated
under the present condition of finances.
A Kill to AbolUb the Oflkf of Ad
miral.
General Logan will introduce, as soon
as possible, a resolution abolishing the
0 lice of Admiral of the Navy at once,
and the office of Vice Admiral as soon
at* a vacancy occurs. This will rflieve j
I the navy to an equality of rank with
the army grades of General and Lieu
1 tenant General, in which are. by rir
j tue of the army reduction in October of!
last session, to be discontinued as soon 1
a* a vacancy occurs. Mr. Logan in- ;
tends to press this measure before any \
confirmation is made by the Senate of

! sioned by the death of Admiral Farra

Minister Motley
Writes that he has received an auto
graph letter from the Queen of Hol
land, offering him free use of her ele
gant mansions at Hague, to enable him
to complete the history of the Nether
lands. This offer Mr. Motley accepted
and will proceed to The Hague to com
mence hie literary labors as soon as he
receives instruction to turn over hip of

Manhattan tiaalight Company.
Ir? response to a letter from Charles
Roome, President of the Manhattan
Gaslight Company, New York, announc
ing an appeal from the assessment of
$26,538.73 for gas sold during the month
of October last, upon the ground that
October, 1870, respecting all laws ini"
posing taxes on sales, repeals the tax on
gas sold, Acting Commissioner Douglass
say that the liability of the Manhattan
Gaslight Company, in common with all
gas companies in the country, should be
assessed and pay taxes on all gas manu
factured, consumed or sold by them. It
is too plain to admit of any question;
but if the Manhattan Gaslight Com
pany are of a different opinion, and such
is the decision of the Court, the Internal
Revenue office wili oppose no obstacle
except to make such defense before the
court as maybe necessary to protect the
interests of the government in collecting
the taxes Congress has imposed.
Credentials Aeceplcd.
Viscount Trielhard at noon to-day,
in accordance with previous arrange
ment, called at the Executive Mansion
and presented his credentials, which
were accepted by the President.

Of the Senate held a brief session this
morning, at which a committee was
appointed to nominate members of the

Senate.
Admiral Porter's I.ant Letter.
The last Porter letter is much talked
about and is the sensation of the hour.
Grant will hold on to the Admiral's
nomination and so be avenged unless
mutual friends change his mind.
Roderick R. Roller,
Who was charged with committing
frauds against the Pension Bureau, has
arrived and was in his seat in the
House to-day and busy trying to induce
members to aid in preventing his arrest
until a committee of Congress can in
vestigate the charges.
; So Change to be Made.
No disposition is manifested to trans
fer Senator Schurz from the committees
he is now on to those of lees importance,
and those who have predicted that he
would be turned out of the party now
find their mistake.
Well Organized Effort.
There will be a well organized eflort
made to defeat the confirmation of Ad
miral Porter and Rowan in the Senate.
Tllncellaneou*.
The committee on Ways and Means
will, as requested, give Mr. Boutwell
power to issue.three hundred million five
per cent, bonds, the Secretary having
acknowledged his four and a half jkt
cent, bonds scheme a failure.
The free ship hill proposed at the
close ot last session, ami now on the
Speaker's table, will be sent to the com
mittee on Commerce. There is now,
however, hut little disjnjsition apparent
to press action on this bill.
Comment* of the New York <lty
i*reMn on the PreNtden i"w Me*?aice.
New Yoke, December 6. ? All the
Metroplitan journals have elaborate
comments upon the President's message
and accompanying State documents
tii is morning.
The Tribune thinks that the promi
nent features of the Administration had
already commanded popular approba
tion, but this message will still more en
dear the President to the hearts of his
countrymen. The writer thinks that,
in regard to San Domingo, the Presi
dent was clearly right in his position, if
not misinformed as to material facts,
and submits that Congress will be_ con
strained by public sentiment to admit
San Domingo into the Union, unless ii
can be made to appear that her people
are preponderously averse to such an
union. He thinks the President's pa
tience is almost exausted by Cuban out
rages, regrets the silence 01 t lie message
as regards the Alabama claims, and es
teems the President's suggestions and
recommendations with regard to public
lands and land grants as wise and
timely.
The HeraLi thinks the Pre^ilent's
message a good state paper and a
staunch party platform ; that as an ex
hibit of the management under his su
pervision of the Government in our
foreign and domestic affairs, there is
much in it that is good and encouraging,
and as a foreshadowing of the general
policy of his administration there is j
nothing in it calculated to disturb the '
general confidence of the country.
The Times says that the message is
the best answer to those who insist that
the misaien of the Republican party is
ended, or impugn General Grant's fit
ness for interpreting the wishes or pro- !
moting the interests of the people; and J
that the policy set forth is at once posi- [
tire and practical. The writer thinks j
it is clear that the President has no 1
idea of plunging the nation recklessly
into war as a means of manufacturing j
party capital ; yet that there is, never- j
theless, rather a striking suggestivenesi <
in the brief paragraph which is devoted
to the Alabama claims, and the mild
ness of the President's reference to that
question renders it more significant than
the fi.mness of his remarks in regard to
the fisheries.
The World severely criticises the
message and thinks it is a document
i which needs a good deal of winnowing
j to separate a small amount of grain
from the heap of chaff, in which it is
buried. The writer says the request of
the President for authority to appoint a
oommission to inve?tigat? and audit ths
damages of individuals by the Alabama
depredations with a view to their pay
, ment by our own government is A pro*
' ceeding entirely without a precedent
and that if his advice is accepted a pre*
cedent will be set for making the Gov
| eminent responsible for the reparation
I of damages sustained by our merchant
( men by foreign powers as incident to
wars.
The Sun can find little merit or satia
j faction in the message and terma it a
j poverty-stricken document
THE WAR.
To Prevent ft* Bombardment th*
I'rrnrh Evarnalf the City of Or
lean*.
Toms, December 5. ? An official com- j
: munication annunces that General
D'Aurellesde Paladines, on the night of
i the 3d of December, advised the gov
ernment of the necessity of evacuating
Orleans and retreating to the left bank
of the Loire. The government, how
ever, was of opinion that it would be
better to hold firrhly to Orleans, but
General D'Aurelles de Paladines retain
ed his views of the necessity for retreat
and the government decided to
act accordingly; but at noon on
the fourth of December De Paladines
I telegraphed to the government
that he had changed his opin
ion, and would hold Orleans. There
uj?on Mr. Gambetta started for Orleans,
but when the La Chapelle train wap
rired upon by Prussian cavalry, Gam
betta returned to Tours, where he found
a dispatch from General Pelliere, an
nouncing that the enemy demanded the
evacuation of Orleans under the threat
that they would bombard the place, ar.d
that Pelliere had agreed in the name of
General De Palladines to comply with
the demand. Accordingly, the marine
batteries were spiked, powder destroyed,
and at midnight the Prussians occupied
Orleans. Dispatches from the chief of
i the corps d'armee announce that the
retreat was made in good order. No dis
patches have been received from General
De Palladines.
i
IXxpatrh from King: William.
Bkkli.v, December 5. ? Queen Au
gusta has received the following die
patch from the King dated Versailles,
Sunday, midnight: After a two days
battle in which the army of the Grand
Duke of Mechlenburg was mainlv en
gaged, Manstien's corps captured St.
Jean, a railway station in the suburbs
of Orleans, thirty gune and a thousand
prisoners were taken. The Prussian
loss was moderate. Wrangal's division
Buffered the most. The Prussians found
nine cannon and much amunition on
the field before Orleans.
[.Signed,] William.
The I .a test from France.
Torus, December .r>. ? The Govern
ment has received by balloon from 1
Paris official reports to the 4th inst.
of the progress and results of the move
ment made by General Ducrot against
the Prussian lines of investment. They
r-tatc state that Thursday was passed in
burying the dead and succoring the
wounded. Friday morning the Prus
sians attacked with great impetuosity
the French at ('hampigny and Villieres.
After seven hours fighting the enemy
tailed to carry the positions of the
French and retreated, leaving their
dead and wounded on the field. Their
losses were from Jifteeu to twenty
thousand.
General Ducrot greatly distinguished
himself in the battle on Friday.
Among the killed is General La Cha
rier, and General Renault is badly
wounded.
General Sonnetz, in hi* report, says
that the troops who attacked the French
w ere Saxons and W urtembergers. Their
number exceeded 100,000. Their losses
must have been extraordinary, for the
next day they were so weakened that
they suffered the French to cross the
river unopposed.
The success of the French troops has
created the wildest enthusiasm in Paris.
IIavke, December 5 ? 6 P. M ? All
communication with the interior of
France is severed.
('Aimilian Opinion or Ihf I'rmiilfnt'i
.Meiunyc.
Tou?xto, Ost., December 6. ? The
papers this morning, commenting on
the President 's message, say, in refer
ence to the enforcement of Canadian
rights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, that
the President does not found his objec
tions against the action of our govern
ment upon the seizure of vessels actu
ally engagad in fishing within the
forbidden boundaries, but on seizures
and examinations of vessels suspected
of a design to violate the regulations of
the Canadian government. He states
that while the Canadian act permits
such seizures and examinations the
Jaw has not yet been put in force, and
is resolved to postpone action until
actual offense has been given.
Whether such seizures and exam
inatioi s form the necessary part of
police duty of the navy, is a question for
the government to consider. We need
hardly say, however, that if these pro
ceedings are necessary to drive out in
truders in our waters, the law ought to
be enforced, whatever objections may
be made by the American Government.
The threats of retaliation which the
President holds out, that Canadian ves
sels will be refused a. imi6sion to Ameri
can ports, and the bonded system as it is
called, under which the Canadian mer
chandize passes through the United |
States, l e suspended, will n>t have the i
slightest effect in preventing the j
assertion of the just rights of Canada
in the waters of the gulf. The number
of Canadian vessels entering America* j
port* is quite insignificant. The \
stoppage of the bonding system raigl t
cause some inconvenience toindividuals j
in Canada, but would enormou lj ben
efit other parties, and the chief injury j
would full upon the American transpor- 1
tation lines. President Grant may try 1
I measures of coercion whenever he
likes, it will not cause the people of
i Canada to abate the claims one jot or
| title. The President asserts the
J right of the United States to
' the free navigation of the St. Lawrence.
, It is hardly worth while to dispute
^ this claim. Whatever rights the Am
' ican people may poseees to the oaviga;

Whenever a request has been ma<le to

allege, therefore, that the eight States
on the lakes which he makes so much
of, have been seriously injured by the
