OVER BODY OF W. HEACOCK
No One is Suspected of the
Crime.
CLOTHING WAS DISTURBED
So Father Believes Son Was
Murdered.
A coroner's inquest to Inquire into the
cause of the death of Walter Heaeock
was held yesterday morning. The jury
was sworn over the body of the young

Gore, being old soldiers.
After reviewing the body the coroner
explained the course of the bullet in the
head. The bullet is lodged in the back of
the head, a little to the left of the center
lino. The ball entered the head at the
right temple and passed diagonally back
ward and down. It is about on inch lower
than when it entered the head.
The jury was then taken to the spot
where the body was found. It was ex
Plained to the jury where the lody lay.
It was in the sort of trough caused by the
dripping of the eave3 of the house. It
was lying on the left side. On the side of
the wall were several splotches of blood.
Tiuse were strung along the wall in a
S'rt of circle, showing the way the body
!!!. There was a big pool of blood where
the head of the young man lay. It was
stated that the hat was about three feet
from the body, and there were no powder
burns, on ic The revolver was several
f'-ft awav from tho body. The jury then
adjourned to the coroner's office at the
ciurt house, where the witnesses were
examined. County Attorney Conley con
ducted the examination.
Air. K. K. Heaeock, the father of the
''iing man, was the first witness called.
H stfitpu that his son's wife and two
. hr h 'lies were going to a social on
Wednesday evening. Airs. Heaeock was
yoing to her friend's home to dress for
the social. While at the friend's house
she was taken sick and returned home.
Soon after she left her father's house Mr.
McColli.iter came and Mr. Heaeock and

How to Prevent and Cure Them.
People who are subject to coughs or
suffering from catarrh, even in its mild
est form, should protect themselves
against catching cold now, for more cases
of consumption are contraoted in Octo
ber and November than at any other time
during the year. Just at this season tho
sputa of consumptives expectorated in the
streets of every city and town during
the summer, has become thoroughly dried,
and, teeming with germs of the disease,
is taken up into the air by fall winds
and' inhaled by every livlns person.
If the air passages are in a healthy
condition, there Is no danger; but let them
become inflamed by coughs and catarrh,
then these germs And lodgment on the in
flamed surfaces, multiplywith astonish
ing rapidity, and the disease consumption
Is contracted.
Heretofore the public, as well as the
medical profession, have been at a loss to
prevent this terrible disease; but now
that government statistics and health re
ports have shown there IS A jWAT, and
ONLY ONE, every person who contracts
the disease has only himself to blame for
the consequences.
It has now been settled beyond all dis
pute that the new Dry Air Germicide,
Hyomei, WILL cure consumption, and
that coughs, catarrh, bronchitis and other
diseases of the respiratory organs CAN
NOT exist where it is used. Hyomei
protects and cures by destroying the
germs which cause the disease, and vhich
cannot be "ached by stomach medicines.
Every weak-lunged or catarrh-affected
person should use it daily.
Hyomei is sold by all druggists, or sent
by mall, for the following prices: Hyomei
Outflts complete, $1.00. Trial Outfits. 25c.
Hyomei Balm, 25c. Send for a free sam

it was. He struck a match and found
that it was the body of his son. The
body was covered with blood. Mr. Hea
eock went into the house to get a lamp,
and then tried to carry the body into the
house. Mr. Heaeock picked up the gun
and his son's hat. He then described the
wounds and where his son was lying. He
was of tiie opinion that it was fully 30
minutes after Walter left the house be
fore he was found. He died about 15 min
utes of 12. He stated that the shells from
the revolver were moved by Officer Sam
Jones.
Mr. Heaeock stated that there were no
powder burns on the hat or on tho. face
of the young man. His pockets were
turned wrong side out and there was not
a cent or a pocketknife in either of them.
The next day Mr. Heaeock said ho went
down town and tried to find out if Wal
ter had spent any money, but could find
no trace of it. He stated that the west
window of the house was covered by a
blind and screen and there were no bullet
holes in either. Mr. Heaeock acknowl
edged that his son used intoxicating llq
ours, but had not touched any that day.
Mr. Heaeock was asked tho direct ques
tion. "Have you at any time since your
son and his wife have been married seen
or heard anything that would lead you to
think that their relations were strained?"
He emphatically answered, "No,"
This concluded his testimony.
Dr. Jordan was then called. Ho was
the physician called to attend the young
man after he was shot. He stated that
he found the young man lying on the
floor, with a pillow under his head. The
doctor then described the wounds and
stated that the ball passed entirely
through the head, and at its exit fhe
brains were protruding. lie said that he
told the people that he could not help the
young man, as he was sure to die within
a few hours.
Miss Elizabeth Moore was next called.
She stated that she and her sister and
Mrs. Walter Heaeock were going to a
party, and that Mrs. Heaeock went with
them to their home to dress. While there
she was taken sick and went to her home.
She said that Walter was to meet them
at the social and take them home.
Mille McCollister, a, sister of the young
man's wife, was next called. She was at
Mr. Heacock's home on the evening that
Walter killed himself. She stated that
Walter came home about 9 o'clock and
asked his father where his wife was, and
saw him look at her from the door. She
did not see him get his revolver. She
said that she saw the revolver lying on a
sideboard about half-past 4 that after
noon, but had not seen it since.
Coroner McColister then stated to the
Jury that he aad Dr. Jordan were fooled
by a piece of cotton on the top of the
young man's head. He and the doctor
thought it was the brains protruding
from the head.
Mr. G. D. Owens was next called. He
is a neighbor, and helped carry Walter
Heaccck into the houw. He stated that
he went to the Heaeock home about 8
o'clock and saw Mr. E. E. Heaeock bend
ing over the body of his son. He was
asked to help carry the young man Into
the houst. He said that he did not notice
anything wrong with the clothing. He,
too, described the young man's wounds.
He said he thought the bullet came out
of the top of the head, and he thought
tin-re wore brjins protruding from the
wound. He siid that the pistol was lying
on the grout.d about tven with the knees
of the young man. Ho also saw Officer
Jones unload ;he revoher. Thfre were
four loadod shells and one empty one. If
was a .32 ealibtr revolver. He stated
that he also noticed a bruise at the oppo
site sl le of the lorehead from the wound.
This was the last witness called.
The jurv vere out out a few moments,
when they returned with a verdict that
the young man met his death from a pis
tol shot iy the hand of some party un
known to the jury. This ended the inves
tigations. 1c loaves the matter in about
as much light as before the inque'rt was
hold. The jury findings did not state nor
was it r-oven by the evidence that the
young man was killed ncciuentally or by
some orio, or whotiirr he kilkd himself.
The lather of the young man is firm in
his belief that the youna man was mur
dered, but has not the least Idea who
woalil no ;t.
