"What do you think of the message1?
The Parnell party in England, hold
the balance of power.

Foreign relations are very friendly.
The people are of course glad that such'

tiunaro6;09'() words.
A democratic presidential combina
tion for 1888, has been made between
Governors Hill, of New York, and
Lee, of Virginia.
The President believes that the In
dians should be turned over to- the
War Department, we' think it a good
plan to catch them first.
John Sherman's thirty years of pub
Ec life, most of it in the Senate, will
make him useful to his party as the
President of the Senate.
Blaine is getting to the front again
and should he want the nomination in
18S8 he will in all probability,, receive
it. He- is the strongest man in the
party-
As read' through democratic editor
is! spectacles the message is a magnifi
cent state paper;- as read through Re
publican it is a humilating exhibition
of intellectual feebleness and cowardly
evasion. S. P. Post.
The Republican minority of' the
House of Representatives gave the
complimentary nomination for Speak
er to T. B. Reed, of Maine, a very
close friend of Blaine's and his selec
tion is, therefore, significant.
When the question of prohibition
comes up in the South, the negro has
the fairest sort of a show to get his
vote in and have it counted, too. Both
prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists
are pleading, for instance in Goorgia,
just now with the colored men to vote
tbeir way.
It is1 estimated that one-nineth of
the golcf produced comes from the sil

Was not wholly independent of silver
and the use of theso two metals to

every age may have a deeper signifi
cance than is apparent.
In a game of draw at the national
capital, a Boston man held four sevens
and gave his1 ftote- for 300, with which
to back his confidence fn the strength
of his hand. He lost, however, and
has been sued on the protested note.
Nobody but a Boston man would have
gone back on a hand like that.
The following reasons are given by
Gov. Ross, of New Nexico, for his re
moval of Attorney General Breeden,
on being asked by that gentleman for
the whys and wherefores: "As to the
cause for your suspension, permit me
to say, and without intention of giving
personal offense, but for the vindica
tion of a public act, and m conserva
tion of the public interest, that you
were suspended for drunkeness, licen
tiousness, gambling, and misfeasance,
malfeasance and nonfeasance in office;
crimes which ought not be tolerated
in a public official.
As a public office is a public trust,
so a public official is a public exemp
lar. The private life of a public of
ficial is as much public property as
his public life. No man who habitu
ally infracts the laws of sobriety or
decency is fit for a public trust. This
you have done therefore I suspend
ed you from office."
Gov. Ross did right to give his reas-
jyfts for the suspension of Breeden, and
jes are true Breeden should

A DEMOCRATIC PRECEDENT,
The Democratic press manifested an
uncalled for anxiety before the election
of Sherman as President' of the Senate
as towho' ought to be elected to that
position, many claiming' that a Repub
lican Senate should elect a Democrat,
because the people willed at the last
election that a democrat should pre
side over the Senate," by virtue of his
ofiice as Vice President of the United
States. As a reason for this unheard
of proceedure they claimed that the will
of the people would be foiled, if a .re
publican should be elected.
The Senate done perfectly right in
following a democratic precedent. Not
iater than for years ago, when Vice
President Arthur became President at
the death of Garfield, the Senate elect
ed a president who would have sue
ceeded to Mr. Arthur's ofiice, had he
died or been disqualified in any way
from discharging the duties- of his of
fice; and the Democrats being in a ma
jority for a day elected Senator Bay
ard to be virtually Vice President of
the United States, though the people
had only a short time before elected
a Republican president by an over
whelming majority both popular and
electoral. Remembering this incident
we cannot understand the logic of the
Democracy when it urged the Senate
to refrain from electing a Republican
lo the ofiice of President of the Senate
when the Republican party has a ma
jority of eight in that body.
To be sure the people expressed
their preference a year ago for a Dem
ocratic administration by a plurality
of 63,983 votes, and as a Republican
has been elected President of the Sen
ate and were Cleveland to die, there
would be a political change in the
country not exactly of the peoples'
making. But the same thing might
have occurred four years ago, when
Bayard was President of the Senate,
although Garfield and Arthur had been
voted in.
The Republicans of the Senate were
authorize! by precedent to elect a Re
publican and they would have been
recreant to their constituencies if they
had failed to do so, for they represent
'constituencies as well as the adminis
tration, and greater constituencies, too,
than do the less number of Democrat
ic senators.

ZULICK'S INDIAN POSITION.
Sbtte of the Territorial press are
very anxious to know how Zulick
stands on the Apache question. For
the benefit of thoso few .the following
dispatch sent by the Governor should
be sufficient:
Hon. S. Q. C. Lamar, Secretary of the
Interior, Washington:
I have anticipated your request.
The article referred to in your dispatch
was promptly recognized by me as in
flamatory in its character, and immed
iately on its publication I took action
to neutralize its bad effect. The gen
eral press of the Territory now con
dem the article and sustain the posi
tion I take, viz: That che strong arm
of the federal government will insure
the people of Arizona the protection
of life and property from hostile In
dian depredations. While" these peo
ple have suffered grently from Apache
outrages, yet being law abiding, ihey
rely confidently upon this administra
tion to right their wrongs. Quiet and
good order will be maintained through
out the territory.
C. M. Zulick, Governor,
NOTORIOUS THIRTEENTH.
The following special to the Tucson
Times, from Prescott, dated the 7th
inst., explains itself:
The grand jury is investigating the
acts of the last Legislature. A num
ber of witnesses have been summoned
from this vicinity and from Tucson,
and a few have been examined, includ
ing members of the newspaper fratern
ity of Prescott. It is rumored that
subpoenas have been issued for a num
ber of members of the now illustrious
Thirteenth. Four or five ex-clerks of
that body are members of the grand
jury, but they have been instructed
by the court to absent themselves from
the jury room during the investiga
tion of the subject. The political
complexion of the jury is 19 Demo
crats and 4 Republicans, but the in
vestigation so far seems to be impar
tial. Rumors aro also current that
the bearers of a certain corruption
fund, known as the Capital removal
sack, from Tucson to the Territorial
Capital during the last session, will be
called upon to tell what they know of
tho price of legislators.
The Tucson Times is mistaken as to
the manner which we read the Tucson
papers. It is the peculiar now you
see it and now you don't style that
they indulge in, that misled us, but
if the Times will look over its last
week's files it will see tho item refer
red to in tho Sentinel about General
Sheridan.
The Pinal-co. district court will con
vene in Florence next Monday.
The Pinal-co. stage robber, James
Shears , is now in jail at Florence.
The A. & P. railroad refuse to pay
their taxes in the northern tier of
counties.
Judge Wm. LovelV, of Tucson, is a
a candidate for attorney-general of the
Territory.
Geronirao, the Apache Chief, is 85
years old. He is to old to be caught
with chaff.
Phenix is digging for artesian water.
We can see no reason why they should
not find it.
Duncan, Graham-co., has put 25
mounted rangers in the field to protect
the settlers.
A Tucson policeman is the proud
father of twins. This indicates good
qualities for a policeman.
We haven't heard of the mounted
police doing any damage as yet. They
will be covered with glory.
Secretary Bayard wasn't wined by
the Prescott leaders. They didn't
want to tempt him we suppose.
Tombstone democrats are going to
start a campaign paper. The old Phe
nix Democrat out-fit will be used.
It is talked that another democratic
paper will be started in Phenix. The
Gazette fills all the want of Phenix in
that line.
Geo. Allen, of Globe, while fishing
in Salt river recently, was-attacked by
a wild cat and severely bit. The wild
cat died afterwards.
Lieut. Gatewood has been relieved
from the charge of the Indians at Fort
Apache, and will report for duty to
his company in New Mexico.
It is said that Tom Weeden wants
to go- to Congress. His friend Hughes,
of the Tucson Star, is advocating him
for that position, we believe.
Passenger traveling over the Atch
ison, Topeka &, Santa Fe railroad, ow
ing to a recent change of time on that
road, now have to lay over one night
at Deming.
The Clifton Clarion favors the meet
ing of the press to discuss the Indian
question. If they don't meet soon the
opportunity to discuss that question
will be lost.
Hon. H. G. Rollms, speaker of the
last assembly, is now editor of the Cal
ico, (Cala.) Print. Gen. Rollin3 will
be a credit to the newspaper fraternity
of California.
A youngman recently appointed to
office appears to think he can bust up
tho democratic party in Arizona. He
is mistaken. Mugwumps aro at a
discount with the frontier democracy.
Tucson Star.
There will be over a hundn'd men
employed on the Phenix insane asylum
after the first of the year. Bricklay
ers will commence work on tho 21st
inst., and the building, when complet
ed, will be more ornamental than useful.
Tom Weeden, Pinal-co. 's honorable
member of the last council, has gone
to Prescott as a witness before the
grand jury, to tell what he knows
about the ways and means of tho late
Thirteenth. Newspaper men don't
make good witnesses.
The Tucson Times wants to know
Gov. Zulick's position on the Indian
question, if he has any. By all means
Governor give the Times your position
on the Indian. It can do no harm
and will be immensely satisfactory to
some of tho press, especially those
who entertain the idea that you should
assmii the responsibility of settling the
Indian question.
The Prescott grand jury are investi
gating the acts of the late legislatuie,
and Prescott editors are telling them
about the way the printing appropria
tion was engineered. The Tucson and
Prescott corruption fund will also be
examined. Prescott will reap in the
shinning shekels from the numerous
witnesses that they will have called
there in this farce.

When a town with the"- maarvelouB
growth of two thousand ia three
months' springs from barren prarie, it
is indeed an item of news that exeites
interest though wo are many miles
from the place of such wonderful
growth. Chadron is tho Leadville of
Nebraska, and one of the growing
young cities of the west. Throe
months ago it started, and to-day
contains two establahed newspapers,
three bank, and other business houses
in proportion. During the last elec
tion, a little over a month since, Cha
dron alone cast over 600 votes. It is
the division point for two railroads
and bids fair to be one of the first cit
ies of Nebraska. This, -like all other
western towns, contains plenty of sa
loons and few'churches, but a more or
derly town cannot be found in that
state.
