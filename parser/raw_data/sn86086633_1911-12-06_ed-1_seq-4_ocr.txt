THE L03 ANGELES ELECTION.
- whose candidate for
ma- r '.',i-i .! ! Harriman. one of the
attorneys for th. defense in the M -N
tmara trial, were badly beaten in
the municipal elections In Los Angeles

dial to do with the outcome of the

IT'S UP TO ENGLAND.
Members of the British parliament
declare Kngland was within three
hours of war with Germany last Sep
tember and the public didn't know
anything about it. And it seems thai
the situation ia not yet satisfactor;
from the standpoint of peace, although
both countries have expressed a wish
for a betterment of relations.
Sir Edward QPafi secretary o state
f, r foreign affairs, voicod this hoie in
Parliament last week when he de
scribed the recent crisis 1m tween the
two countries. Yesterday the English
minister's speech was answered in ttie
Reichstag: by Imperial Chancellor
Von Hethmaiin-Hollweg, who gave a
calm and disiasjslonate exposition of
the Herman case, in which he declared
In the mournful provinces formerly
racked and ruine.1 by Abdul llamid and
now harried and hounded by those who
are manipulating the marionette who
has succeeded him on the Ottoman

THE WALKING CURE.
i:erliody kiows that walking is
the best exercisi there is. It beats till
kinds of Indoor gymnastics by reason
of the fact that it takes those who
pn.cti. e It into the open air. It de
iIops the chest aa well as the limbs.
It is easy, and one who depends up i
i: in a forlorn hope asAasyrof to regain
health can arrange his schedule so a
to begin at any time and cud when ! .
feels fatigue.

NO DIVIDING LINE.
When does the west begin? What
is the dividing Mite? How Is a man
to know whether he Is a westerner or
an easterner? A delegation of west
ern governors and tin ir representa
tives Is engaged in an Invasion of the
enst, but when did it pass out of its
own territory? The governors pre
uncertain themselves. When they
trie,; to discuss tin matter a wide
variance of opinion developed. Sonic
thought the change came at Pike's
Peak, some at Kansas City, some at
St. l.ouls, some at Chicago.
A statesman noted for evasive re
plies was once asked as a test If tha
sun really tomc In the east. He an
swered that east and west are really
purely relative terms. The answer was
not particularly pat as applied to the
sun, but It applies to the question that
has been bothering the governors. To
a New Yorker anything west of Muffalo
is hopelessly western and out of the

J. to fifteen years for blowing up the
lle'.vellyn Iron Work- at Ijo.h An-.eles.
The court bitterly s nred both defend
ant, tikiing particular exception to
the statement of James It. McNi' ni" va
thai In did not Intend to take the. life
of a single person when ho blew up
the Times phi at. PJi gj unng the
, ircums'anccs were such that McNa
mara must have had murder In his
heart. The court made it plain that
the prisoners were not deserving of
leniency, but that for other reasons
the death penally would not be In
Micted. Judge Hordwell undoubtedly
hhpIc Into consideration the fact that
the Mi Niimarns had rendereil some
service to the state by Imparting In
formation which may lead to the
In lining of other guilty men to just
ice. Judge Hordwell took occasii u a i ster
ility, In a statement leaned by hbn
subsv4uent to sentencing the M. Na
inaras' to denoiuice the claims "pa da by
Lincoln Steffi na. magnjiie vi'o-r, thai
It w: s due to hl; (Stelft'is) ami other
outsiders' efforts that the defendants
I
changed their picas from 'not guilty"
to guilty," and gave the OTPdit for th.
outcome of the COM to EMatrtct Attor
ney I 'l cderick.s. W ho, tlM judge lie
lutes, acted entirely without rci-ani
to Mr. Stcffens and n lines dci id. d on
before StelTcns appeared on the scene.
Steffi lis had previously stated that the
men were induced to plead guilty to
end the "war'' between "labor" an I
"capital," and bring about an era Ol
good feeling. In this connection the
notion broached by Stiffens that the
Mi Namaras arc "two heroes" is scored
by Judge Hordwell, w iio deycribi it
as "offensive to common Intelligence
gjld repellent to (he cons teticcs of all
Just men to say nothing of the ph
borrenco of the law for ouch sentl-
incnt; and I am conildeiit ," he says,
"that the district attorney was not
Influenced by any such pap Urn en I in
considering the prppjoapJ that the ilt
fendanta should wtttMhau their ,
of 'not guilty.' "
Attorney Dariow also Issued a i. .
mint on the case late xesterday.
whi.ii pa dpfppdh the action he loo
in ai.i.'iag the HopTpPPPraa to plead
gi iity. He shows in this staleim nl the
defense had ao cape, that tha evidence
