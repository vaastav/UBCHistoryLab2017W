Farmer laaiitate.
"To erery thing there is a season and a
time for erery purpose nnder the heavens."
Granting this sacred truth. Farmers' Insti
tutes have a season. The fitting season it
when the harvests are gathered, when the
farmer closes the page of the year, rests in
the rich enjoyment of his labors and experi
ence, and through frost and blinding snow
looks hopefully forward to the garnerirgs of
another cycle. The present is the dawn of
such a time and season. Its proper improve
ment is of great importance to agriculture.
The subject, though not entirely a new one,
at such a time as this needs re-defining and
a fresh presentation of its claims.
A liberal institute is some precept of law
established a settled maxim or principle.
A farmers' institute is the establishment of
some precept, maxim or principle of agri
culture. Any one familiar with history
knows that past agricultural principles are
in a chaotic state, ine practitioners of this
art, to a large extent, have been men. whose
manual dexterity, from the cradle to the
grave, has been cultivated at the expense of
their minds. They may have had close
contact with nature, and rare familiarity with
its laws, but there has been little recorded
observation, or close comparisons, or search,
ing deduction. The agricultural wisdom of
the past has been a rroping backward
and downward, rather than forward and up
ward; a recovery of something lost, rather
than a discovery; a digging among old fos
sils, rather than penetrating originalities.
A change lias long been demanaed by the
more intelligent and progressive farmers.
inev nave felt tne need of counsel aoa in
struction, and hence have sought agricultu
ral books. This field being narrowly cir
cumscribed, they founded tbe cattle show
ystem, which by its comparisons, in its day.
was potent for good. When the cattle 6how
flagged in interest, the horse, muscular and
gaunt, for speed, was brought in to amuse
the crowd. Amusement not being the chief
end of man, the mere horse race can only
be popular with selfish lovers ot pleasure.
The farmer's club lastly held tbe day, and
is only another effort of the rural mind
in jits search after truth. Wherever these
institutions have degenerated into expensive
dinner parties, t' eir d cay and decline is
; written. Wherever intelligent farmers have
sought chiefly intellectual good, they have
. abundantly proapered. That luxury is the
j bane of intellectual as well at corporeal per
i fection, th-ae olubs testily. Like Josh iran.
more than one has "waxed fat and kicked."
Self-denial and labor are the only stepping
stones to real progress.
Tbere is yet another hopeful movement
for the farmer alrwady alluded to. We
mean the institute. Fanners' institutes are
practically schools of instruction, where
leading minds collect to lead more common
minds in search of Agricultural truth.
They might profitably, for the present, take
the teachers' institute of this State as their
model. Tbe Secretary of Agriculture might
inaugurate these meetings, as the Secretary
of Education does those. They should be
ii .
neia at least annuany, in every county oi
the commonwealth, should continue several
days, if the interest was sufficient, and
should be occupied with lectures, discus
sions, essays, illustrations and familiar con
versations. Who can rightly estimate the
value of such meetings, when once the far
ming mind is aroused to their importance?
Intelligent leading men would be found ;
there, valuable experience would be express- meagre.

disparage either the cattle show or the far
mers club. Both are important in their
spheres, and both have their mission of use
fulness. While we would engiaft the farm
ers' institute upon the former, we would
raio the light of the latter in every village
and hamlet in the land. The farmers'
club would only be a lesser light of the
same great system. It would be a good
time to nave a laimers institute at tbe ap-

This plant is considerably cultivated in
some portions of tha West by many tha
first time the present season. It is grown
for tha root, not or tha herbage. Indeed
the value ot the herbage for food seems to
be little known. One cultivator told me he
had accidentally cut a few stalks of it with
some adjoining clover, for soiling his cows,
and he was astonished to see the kins eag
erly select and swallow the chiccory, leav
ing the fresh-cut clover untasted.
it is said that tbe foliage of cbiccorv may
be cut for fodder early in August, without
affecting tha root product. Tnia does not
seem to be known by most persons with
bom I have talked, who cultivate it in this
country. One gentleman said be had cut
oS a portion of his field in July, and the
second crop of foliage seemed much larger
and grew more rapidly than the first. It
has been cultivated as a forage plant both
in England and in France. Tbe principal
crop is not obtained until the second year
there. The product i abundant, and it U
aaid to be most excellent for milch cows, af
fecting the quality of the milk favorably.
In Eogland.it is more uaed as a pasturage
tor sheep. It ia found most profitable for
this purpose.

hereaway. The tariff, and the consequent
increased price of the foreign product, to

XII E DEAD AT A.Vfl ETAn,
""
We have already published quite a nam-
ber of accounts of the great battle at An
tietam ; but the following, from tbe New
York Times, will, nevertheless, be read with
intense interest :
The living that throng Broadway care
little, perhaps, for the dead at Antietam, but
we fancy they would jostle less carlessly
down the great thoroughfore, saunter less
at their ease, were a few dripping bodies,
fresh from the field, laid along the pave
ment. There would be a gathering up of
skirts and careful picking of the way ; con
versation would be less lively, and the gen
eral air of pedestrians more subdue 1. As
it is, the dead of the battle-field come up to
us very rarely, even in dreams. We see
the list in the morning paper at breakfast,
but dismiss its recollection with the coffee.
There is a confused mass of names, but they
are ail strangers; wo torget me Horrible
eignificance that dwells amid the jumble of
ty pe. The roll we read is being called over
. r- . t . .
in eternity, and pale, trembling lips are an- '
swering to it. Shadowy fingers point from i
the page to a field where even imagination I
is loth to follow. Each of these little names .
that the printer struck off so lightly last
night, whistling over his work, and that we ,
speak with a clip of the tongue, represents ;
a bleeding, mangled corpse. It is a thun
derbolt that will crash into some braiu a
dull, dead, remorseless weight that will fill
upon some heart, straiaing it lo breaking. '
There is nothing very terrible to us, how
ever, in the list, though our sensations might j
be dinerent it the newspaper carrier lett the
names on the battle-held and the bodies at i
ale-held
our doors instead.
We recognize the battle-field as a reality,
but it stands as a remote one. It is like a
funeral next door. The crape on tho bell-
pull tells there is death in the bouso, and in
the close carriage that rolls awav with
muffle 1 wheels, you know there rides a wo
man to whom the world is very dark now.
But you only sea the mourners in the last
of the long line of carriages they ride very
jollily and at their ease, smoking cigars iu a
furtive aud discursive manner, perhaps,
and, wore it not for the black gloves they
wear, which the deceased was wise and
liberal enough to furnish, it might be a
wedding for all the world would know. It
attracts your attenMoo, but des not enlist
your sympathy. But it is very different
when the hearse stops at your own door,
and th corpse is carried out over your own
threshold you know whether it is a funeral
or a wedding then, without lioking at the
color of the gloves worn. Those who lose
friends in battle know what battle fields are,
and our Mary landers, with their door-yards
atrc w a with tbw dead aud dying, and ilieir
homes turned into hospitals tor the wound
ed, know what battle -fields are.
Mr. Brady has done something to bring
home to us the terrible reality an 1 earnest
ness of war. If he has not brought bodies
and laid them in our door-yards, and along
the streets, he has done something very like
it. At the door of his gallery hangs a little
placard, " Tbe dead of Antietam." Crowds
of people are constantly going up stairs ;
follow them, and you will see them bending
over photographic views of that fearful bat
tle, taken immediately after the action. Of
all objects of horror one would think the
battle field should stand pre-eminent, that it
should bear away the palm of repulsive
ness. But, on the contrary, there is a terri
ble fascination about it that draws one near
these pictures, and makes him loth to leave
them. You will see hushed, reverend
groups standing around these weird copies
of carnage, bendiog dowa to look into the
pale faces of the dead, chained by the
strange spell that dwells in dead men's
eyes. It seems somewhat singular that tho
same sun that looked down on the faces of
the hl.iio, blistering them, blotting out from
the bodies all semblance to humanity, and
hastening corruption, should have thus
caught their features upon canvas and given
them Derpetuity forever. But s it is.
these poor suojecis could not give tne '

Objections to Feuiale Printer.
Female printers have now had a loot;
Iani (mir trial in the United State, aui it is
j u last generally confessed tint they are a
tadure. Their practice of the art does not
f x!end. There is no reason ia the world
. why women should not be compositors, if
' hev had not men to compete with. Thev
;an set up types as quickly and correctly as
Tien, but the trouble is, that, with few ex
ceptions, when they become proficient io
the art, they go and get married. There
;ould never be much profit io training men
for compositors, and as soon as they graw
skillful, drafting them from the " case" into
he army or navy. Yet a transformation
as thorough and as wasteful takes place
when the compositor becomes a wite and a
nother. ThU danger of the entire skill of
t long apprenticeship being lost in a day,
would always of itself operate as a high
differential duty in favor of male over female
labor. But iu the work itself the tenacity
and strength of the man gives him many
advantages over the woman. For instance,
a compositor works with more ease standing
than sitting, but a woman cannot stand and
work through a whole day ns a man does.
The physical endurance demanded of com
positors in many newspiper offices alto
gether exceeds the strength of of a woman's
organization. We know compositors who
once a week, and unavoidably, work from
'.he morning of one day through the night
and into the morning of the next. Such a
strain is very exhausting, and as a compos
itor remarked to us, we never feel right
-tfterward till we have been twica through
the sheets," or, in other words, have been
twice to bed. Now, a compositor who is
able to exert himself in this way at a pinch,
will always have the preference over one
who can not. There might be room for
woman as printera if male labor were scarce,
but in America, where such labor is much
scarcer than here, women do not find that
they can compete with men ; and certainly
in England, where there is a superabund
nce of the better article, there is little
providence in bringing the inferior into
narket. The experiment in London which
is going forward under Miss Emily Faith
iull's management is not one, for these and
various other reasons, which we regard with
ny expectation. We are not io the least
surprised that the Victoria Press should
urn out a well-printed volume ; there is
well-printed volume ; there is
nothing to binder. Lsut we see no chance
or women as printers alone side men.

forward 1" to halt 1" Two hundred
artillery-carriages, eight hundred ammuni
tion, baggage, and supply wagons are to be
helped up and locked down the rooky
ravines and along the water-washed gullies
of the worst of Kentucky country roads.
For full fifteen miles the road is jammed.
At a snail's pace we creep along a wag
on's length, a rod, a furlong, a quarter mile
or half, but seldom never more withont
the vexing halt. Thus wears away the
tiresome day, and from coon till night five
miles are made. Five hungry, thirsty,
weary, dustv miles. For the thousands
on before had drank the springs, and wells,
and cisterns dry, and the very gravel was
ground to blinding, choking dust.
The night has come. Tha moon is up.
We are creeping on. We are lying by the
road-side. We march at common time.
We march at slow time. We march at half
pace. We shuffle along at a quarter pace.
Jammed up in the narrow road we stand a
moment, move a yard, stop again five
minutes, ten, fifteen, no room by tha road
side sit down in the shoe-top dust of the
narrow lane forward 1" again. But
men are exhausted and march heavily.
The drums are beat, but the weary foot
refuses to keep the time. Tha camp-song
is sung, but the lively chorus struggles
faintly in dusty throats. The rallying joke
fails to start the stinging repartee ; for it is
ba 1-time now, and the stoutest limbs have
grown sore, the merriest heart is sober, tha
hottest blood is chilled by the frosty air.
But we are trudging on.
It is ten o'clock. Every bushy shrub
shelters a way-worn volunteer. The moon
is getting low. The night is getting cold.
We are baltiug, waiting, waiting, starting,
stopping still, but toiling on.
' ill is eleven o'clock. The moon is down.
The night is dark. Every fence-corner
shows the prostrate form of some soundly
bleeping soldier. Officers, guards, mess
mates are weary waking tho sleepers , so
halting, waiting, starling, and stopping, wa
go creeping on.
It is one o clock. I wait at the root of a
tree. My horse, ray regiment, tke column
is prostrate in tbe road all sound asleep.
ror an hour they hare lain there ofliceiP,
men, mules beitol, armed, saddled, har
nessed all sound asleep. But a distant
bugle, a nearer note, a rattling drum, a
sonorous ' fall in 1 fall in !" shaking har
ness, rumbling wagons, grumbling men
and wo go staggering on.
It is two o'clock. The rumbling of wag
ons has become a dreary roar of babble.
The unsteady ground has become the floor
of a wearying tread-mill. The fog of Uuit
spread through the valley seems a limpid
lake, the wor.u-fence curtain-hangings, the
hite road-track a downy bed, and each
weather-bleached lime-rock a snowy pillow.
Yet, still halting, waiting, starting, stop
ping, we go dreaming on.
It is three o'clock. The solid column
has become a 6traggling gang. The nod
ding horseman is almost thrown by the
stopping of his sleepy horse. The sleeping
mule-uriver is thrown trom his seat by tbe
he
fS-

mother thus concealed her children, ber last
words to the older boy being, to " sava bis
little brother, and never leave him."
On disappearing with their captives and
plunder, the brave lad, with hit brother
baby on Ait back, started for tha nearest
settlement, subsisting on wild fruits and
roots, and reaching New-Ulm iu fourteen
days. About half way on this journey of
sixty miles, he overtook a neighbor named
Ireland, who had lain down to die, having
been struck by do less than eight bullets,
aud who insisted that it was hopeless to
escape.
" But." was the horoie reply of tba boy,
my mother's last words were to sava my
little brother, and I am going to do it.
This devoted courage gave new life to Ire
land, who struggled forward, and all reach
ed New-Ulm without accident. Ireland is
now recovering.
On the next day after tha arrival at New
Ulm, the mother of the children was brought
in by a scoutiog party. The Indiana, find
ing ber an incumbrance to their retreat,
and not being at tba moment disposed to
kill ber, had left the woman on tha prairie,
and after wandering many days, she was
reunited to her children. St Paul Prut.

The democrats of theae times would have

There were many true democrats who ia
Sose first days of the rebellion stood up and
toutly battled for the Union. Those man,

When Buchanan's administration gave ap

There is great danger that they will be da
