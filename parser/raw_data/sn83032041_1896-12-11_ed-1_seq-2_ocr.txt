' Congress met on Monday and the last
message of President Cleveland to thai
hotly was read. The message is lengthj
and deals entirely in statistics but sug
gests nothing of any importance. Oi
the Cuban question, Mr. Cleveland, evi
dently intends to do nothing, leaving thi
Cubans to work out their own independ
ence without any help from him.
Madrid newspapers are greatly excit
ed over their references to Cuba and
Spain contained in President Cleveland's
message and declare the intervention ol
the United States in Cuba would be uu-
lktfvu im f1 v Kuril iliatatine to Spain. Ei
Oorrfxttomlrncia MUiMry says that Spain
has forces more than sufficient to pun
ish an interference on the part of the
United States in the affairs of Spain.
A company with acapitalof $20:000,

Among other purposes in view is said ti

The house committee on banking and
currency at its meeting at Washington
on Wednesday decided that some steps

evils in our banking aud currency 6)8-

More McKinley prosperity. Wages
of all employes of the Illinois Steel com
pany, Chicago were reduced from 10 to
25 per cent, on December 1. Moter-
men and conductors of the Consolidated
Traction company, Pittsburg, have been
subjected to a reduction of wages from
10 to II 57 a day. The extensive
plant of the Roxbury, Mass.. Carpet
company has closed down indefinitely,
it is me largest concern of its kind in
New England and employed 1,200 peo

partment of W. B. Thorn fc Co's. shoe
factory, Haverllill, Mass., have been
paid off and discharged.
Judging from the increasing demand
from foreign countries for American
iron it does not stand in much need of
protective duties. A late dispatch from
Birmingham, Ala., anounces sales of
3,000 tons for Liverpool, and also orders
for Rotterdam, Genoa and other points
in foreign countries. A constant mar
ket for surplus southern iron outside of
the United States seems to be an assured
feature of future business. An order is
reported from Detroit for 2,000 tons of
pig iron for Budapest of a peculiar char
acter, to be used in the manufacture of
car wheels. But the more finished pro
duct of northern manufactories is also
finding a market abroad. The increased
exportation of manufactured goods is
one of the great triumphs of the Wilson
tariff imperfect as it is. Uuder uo form
er tariff law has there been such pro
gress in this direction.
The Philadelphia Recojul is correct,
ssys the New York World, asserting that
while the iron manufacturers of this
country are calling for more protection,
Alabama iron is celling in Europe
in open competition with the
cheapest products of European labor.
CThis is true not only of pig-iron but
of cut and wire nails, of bicycles, sewing
machiens and many other forms of it on
and steel goods which are exported and
sold in Europe at a profit, and without
any protection whatever.
It is also true that the very time our
manufacturers are demanding increased
protection against foreigners they are
selling to foreigners cheaper than they
sell at home.
How is it that American steel rails are
worth Jess a mile ontside of our coast
limit than they are on our wharves?
How is it that our coal is sold for 50
cents a ton less in Hamburg than in
New lork? Instead of an iacrease of
tariff taxes, why should we not have fair
trade prices at home as well as abioad?
Osb factor in the resources of the Uni
ted States for defense or aggression, an
English writer. Mr. Stevens, points out
which no other Englishman has reck
oned with. He remarks:
"At present the United States govern
ment pays $138,000,000 a year to pen
sioners of the civil war. As the men
die these pensions fall in at the rate of
five to eight millions annually; in 20
years or so the pension list will be a
white 6heet of paper. That means over
twenty-six millions sterling a year paid
already for a military purpose which
can be diverted to armaments without a
cent of extra taxation. In 20 years this
country will be easily able to turn out a
dozen battleships a year without taking
a cent out of anybody's pocket. And
that means the naval supremacy of the
world.
"If we started the United States in
this course by some bungling attempt to
get our coaling stations half fortified
then it was the worst day's work ever
did in our lives. But since the mischief
is done, and apparently done irremedia
bly, we had better face the situation
gijuarely and at once."
It appears to be the belief of a great
many men elected to legislative bod ins.
says the Hsrristmrg l'afruX, mat u
their business to introduce bil.s, next to
introduce more bil's and last to hare
bills introduced. Ti such decree ha
'his belief l-en impressed upon the
Hinds of the c h- sen of the people, and
upon some of the people also, that
man who serves through a vhole ses
sion of a legislature without introducing
a few bills it mikes no difference if
they be smothered in committee irn me
diately is looked upon as lacking in
telligence or at leat he is suspected of
sort of crank.
There are naHy fifteen hundred bills,
r ported from committees, awaiting tne
action of the second session of the Fifty
fourth congress. In congress as else
where a large number of bills never get
beyond the committees. The sum total
..f bills introduced is therefore much
larger than the number now awaiting
tction.
Congressmen cover mutn mure
territoiv that is their districts are larger
than do the members of the stUe leg
islatures and they have more valid ex
cuses for the introduction of many bills
Bat the average State legislature wrest
le ;h mnre bills in one session than
congress does in two. Next month eve
ry member of the legislature w o per
colates into this town will have a grip
sack, boots and breeches filled with bills
that the great American people want
converted into laws the said American
people being the Jim Smiths and Sam
innKM. each of whom controls a vote
down at the Corners, or the Bill Flushes
or Tom Kuockouts who run the biggest
saloons in the block.
Very many of these bills are desert
ed as soon as they come into the world,
many are deservedly killed in commit
tee, but the great maj jrity are placed on
ih calendar, worthless as thev are. and
impede action on other measures which
are more deserving or more important
But too many unnecessary bills find
their wav to the st itute books. There
are scarcely six biilj introduced in any
session of the legisature that are worth
a mo nent's attention by men devoted
to the interests of the state. And of
these more deserving six, not less than
three are killed because they are too
honest. The man who does not intro
duce a bill now is the real statesman.
The State convention of county com
missioners of Pennsylvania held at
Reading recently discussed a number of
questions of great importance to the tax
oa vers of the state. Doe of them was
as to whether justices of the peace shotdd
bs multched for costs in the petty case:
returned to court without sufficient
cause. Ihe courts of quar er sessions
of every county in the state have had
numberless cases of this character to
deal with, and if the county commission
ers will secure the pafsage of a law such
as they will recommend for imposing
the costs upon the justices and magis
trates who make return of petty cases on
flimsy or unseasonable evidence, they
will save large sums of money annually
to the taxpayers.
Probably one of the most important
questions discussed was that of registra
tion. The convention decided to re
commend the single annual registiation,
and the doing away with the May regis
tration. This, if passed and it becomes
a law, will save the counties of the state
a great deal of money yearly, as well as
avoid the performance of work that is
really unnecessary.
Among other matters up for consider
ation was that of praying the state leg
islature to amend the state constitution
so as to classify the cities and boroughs
of the state to the end that all public of
ficers shall be paid salaries instead of re
ceiving fees, as at present. The fee sys
tem they declare, has been found unsat
isfactory and burdensome and if the
wishes of the county commissioners are
granted a great and beneficial reform
will have been brought about. Alto
gether the annual sessions of the county
commissioners are certain to work a
great deal of good to the people of the
state.
If anything were needed in addition
to the outgivings of liepublican states
men fresh from Canton to indicate the
intention of the victors in regard to the
tariff, a full blown hint could be plucked
from the list of demands to be made of
congress by the California Fruit Grow
ers' Convention. No doubt there is
plenty of evidence to prove that these
demands are not merely perfectly rea
sonable and proier, but that compli
ance with them will be of great advan
tage to everybody. 1 'ersons who want
goveimental bounties are always pre-
Pa"ed to demonstrate complete unselfish
Dess aud "Otous patriotism.
California is first in the field. Now
let us hear from the wool growers, the
salt miners, the lumbermen, the mill
bosses, and all the noble army of mar
tyrs to the wickedVilson bill. It is an
nounced that Major McKinley intends
to put in the winter framing a tariff bill
to be presented to the extra session be
means to call directly after his inaugur
ation. How can he do it unless the va
rious mendicants of trade make baste to
tell him what they want? Step up ev
erybody, and hand in your list of de
mands! We are going to have a feast
as will be a feast. Walk up to the table,
gentlemen! Nobody shall be sent away
hungry.
Senator Miixe, of Texas, on Wednes
day introduced the following resolution
in the senate:

America in congress assembled, that the

It will, of course, be printed as a matter
of news when it goes to congress, but it
is doubtful whether an advance copy of

will be any less interesting thtn Mr
Cleveland's previous messages, but tie

but it is thought that a paten bar to a
proper extent uuder the jurisdiction of

ly compel the lottery patent solicitors
aud the delusive cicular patent solicitors
to either reform their methods or gel
out of the busiuess. In either case the

would be gainers.
Sjeaking of the probability that one

he would not leave the seuate for any po

There is alarm among the Republi-
oans over a report that "Teddy" Roose
velt is tiring of his New York job and
wants to come back to ashiogton as
assistant secretary of the navy under
the McKinley administration. They
don't want "Teddy" to come back to
ashmgton, but he has a knack of get
ting what he wants; hence their alarm.
They know what a wonderful capacity
"leddy has for stirring things up and
keeping them stirred up. They think
the extra session of congress and other
