The people of Pleasant Township are
still alive especially those near Lynn
dale. The most enjoyable affair of the
season took place on Thanksgiving.
It happened this way Mr. and Mrs.
Moses Shaw had invited quite a num
ber of neighbors and friends to their
tin wedding which came on 'llianks
giving. On Sabbath preceding, Mrs.
Sowerwine and Mrs. Sullivan persua
ded them to abandon the idea of a tin
wedding, on account of the pecuniary
loss they had sustained, promising, to
notify as many as they could of the
change and entertain those who could
not get the notice. As soon as then
proposition was agreed to, these two
ladies with the help of some others
planned a surprise. A Thanksgiving
service had been announced at the
school house near by. The day came.
The services weie conducted by Mr.
and Mrs. S. T. Huntley. Then came a
ailemma. Some that were notified did
not come, and some that did not get the
notice came -unprepared. Mesdames
Sowerwine. Sullivan, Lynn and Wine
gar being the only ones who brought
things for the dinner. After some
consultation between these four ladies
it was thought they had enough for all:
so with boxes, baskets, buckets ami
tinware the crowd (about thirty in
number) marched over to Mr. t'haw s,
they having gone home some time be
fore, The surprise was complete, the
dinner excellent and abundant, enough
dainties remaining to gladden the
hearts of dear little ones that had been
left at home. The afternoon was spent
very pleasantly, all agreeing they had
bad a good t'.ine and wishing such oc
casions would come oftener. There

WASHINGTON LETTER.
(From our Regular Correspondent.)
Washington. Dec. 1th. 1886,
About the time this letter reaches
you the two Houses of the Forty
Nintu Congress will meet and open in
the usual way for the short busy ses
sion. The rush af Congressmen to the
city, and of the crowd that always fol
lows them, began yesterday, and will
continue for the next month. The in
dications are that there will be a pretty
full representation of both Senators
and Congressmen on next Monday,
when the gavels fall simultaneously in
both ends of the Capitol.
The question which excites the most
attention in the minds of the members
who are coming in, is whether any
thing can or will be done with the tar
ill' this winter. The high-protection
ists are bound that there shall be no re
duction of purely protective duties, if
it can be prevented. The reform lead
ers are as anxious that somu deference
shall be paid to the promises of the par
ty to which the majority belong. One
of the things which the President is
credited with saying in regard to the
tariff is that it
should be arranged with
reference to economic interests instead
of political conditions, that as a party
issue it is distracting, and as experience
for several long and fruitless years has
shown, leads to no practical results* nor
even points out practical methods of
reform.
A Pennsylvania member-elect of the
Fiftieth Congress, who has been here
during the week, was talking about
the surplus millions and aboutthe prob
ability of the Administration being a
ble to submit a plan for their reduction.
IIt? thinks a great deal will depend up
on what the President will say and
he thinks the President has before him
now the greatest opportunity of his
life. "It amounts to a crime," said he,
to heap up needless taxes in the Treas
ury in tune of peace, and if the Presi
dent takes a bold stand against it he
will have the country to back him."
list at this time the President is giv
ing the last polishing strokes to the
message with which he has been wres
tling for the last few weeks. He has
had a very hard time with the figures
of those surplus millions, and in trying
to solve the problem for reducing those
taxes,—so hard a time, indeed, that he
has grown nervous and irritable and
explosive over tho work, to the great
consternation of his obsequious atten
dants. Secretary Manning's annual re
port will deal almost exclusively with
the surplus and the best method of re
ducing the taxes, and it will be inter
esting to see whether he or the Presi
dent can produce the better financial
matter.
The report of the Postmaster Gener
al was before the public more than a
week ago, but the report of Secretary
Endicott will not amount to anything
tins year, nor will that of the Attorney
General. Secretary Bayard will make
no report, but will represent the State
Departinentment by sending to Con
gress the diplomatic dispatches of the
vear. He is not discouraged, however,
by the indilliercuce shown at the last
session of Congress to his recommen
dations. Secretary Whitney will ask
for five more millions this yeai in addi
tion to what has already been given for
a new navy, and Secertary Lamar will
reiterate his views ou the settlement
of the Indian problem.
lie advocates a generous policy on
the part of the Government towards
its wards, and at the same time recom
mends such measures as will result in
their becoming independent of its fos
tering care. Our Indian policy, he in
sists. is liased on considerations of na
tional honor and philanthropy rather
than of trade or self defence. Last
year he said the Indians aa a raco are
few, poor and harmless, and they have
a just claim for help and protection
which should be scrupulously respect
ed.
The well worn argument that it
would be cheaper to keep the Indians
at a fashionable hotel than as they aro
now dealt with, is often revived by
western people who come here. The
argument is strictly true,but the troub
le lies in the fact that the United
States has no right to save money in
that way. The Indians enjoy no priv
ileges that are not theirs by right, and
these cannot be taken away because
the country would niaks money by the
act.
M.:\ Lamar's report reflects a breadth
of view and fores of expression which
give the document a literary value not
alxrsys to bo found in stal paper.

mates fur pensions for thy fiscal year
