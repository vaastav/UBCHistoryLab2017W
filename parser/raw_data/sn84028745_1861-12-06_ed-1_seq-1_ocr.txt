Washington News and Gossip.
We glean the following items from the
WashiDgton correspondence of New York
and Philadelphia exchanges. They will be
found quite interesting :
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. 1861.
WHAT IS THOUGHT OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
8AGK.
The Messacre was read in both Houses to
day. The general impression is that it is a
strong document. The coolness with which
the rresidcnt rolled tbe nigger up id a copy
of the act of August 6, 1801, entitled "An
act to confiscate property nsed for iasurrec
tionnry purposes." is greatly applauded. He
lenped the whole Subject wi.h the stride of a
ginnt, and struck the question of capital and
lubor, a theme popular with the masses. This
teems to be me popular verdict.
CONGRESS.
Congress is to-dav in ecol working order.
There are evident indications that tbe slave
question is to occupy a prominent pi ice in
me DUBiness or me session, tnougn in a ait
ferent aspect from that in which it is usually
debated. The prevailing opinion, however,
appears to be in favor of letting the insti
tution take care of itself in the battle for the
Union.
SOLDIERS FOR THE "UNION."
Of one hundred and sixteen marriage
licenses issued here in November, a very
large proportion of the bridegrooms were
eoldirrs. Tbe number of lice uses for the
month is larger than ever before in a single
HEAVY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES.
Immense claims for damages, resultinz
from the occupation of the soil of Virginia,
oy tne teaerai troops, win soon oe lorta-
coming, and to be a claim agent hereafter
will be a profitable business. It is to be
hoped, however, that a law will be passed
discriminating against all who do not earn
estly aBsiet the Government in putting down
the rebellion.
CLOTHING FOR THE PRISONERS AT RICHMOND.
Two thousand suits of comfortable clothin?
and otber necessaries, were sent to onr pris
oners at Richmond last week, by tbe Quar
termaster General. Besides this, Massachu
setts sent three hundred and fifty suits to the
prisoners irom mat mate.
THE CASE OF KERRIGAN.
Tbe statement of tbe conviction and sen.
teDce of Colonel Kerrigan is utterly without
truth. He has not even been tried, and I am
nnable to learn that the charges and specifi
tionB have yet been fully determined upon.
ABUNDANCE OF FORAGE.
The Government has now abundant facili
ties for bringing forage to Washington, and
do fears are entertained of a failure in the
SENATORS POWELL AND BRIGHT.
Considerable feeling is manifested here at
the tact- that Powell, of Kentucky, and
Bright, of Indiana, have taken seats in tho
Senate. Their loyalty is doubted, hence
their position is a dangerous one for the
Union cause, since tney are entitled, if they
remain in that body, to attend the secret ses
sions of the Senate, where the strength and
movements of the army is to be discussed,
and other important information is to be
communicated, which ought not to be known
to the enemy.
A PERSISTENT YOUNG LADY.
For several weeks a very beautiful and in
teresting young lady called daily upon the
Secretary of State, to intercede for her lover.
wno is one oi tne ovuie prisoners ne naving
been arrested three months since, while con
veying dispatches to the rebels. After much
importunity by the lady, and a great deal of
correspondence with her lover, the latter
agreed to ner to take tne oatn or allegiance,
and an officer was sent to the old Capitol
prison, to administer the oath. On its being
read to the caged lover, he objected to taking
it, stating teat ne opjeciea to s part ot it.
On being asked what part he stated that
which denied him the benefit of "any men
tal reservation" as one of its conditions.
CONTRABANDS AT FORTRESS MONROE.
We have now between three and four
thousand contrabands at Fortress Monroe.
Tbe able-bodied men are employed upon for
tifications and other work at $3 and $10 per
month, and rations according to the kind of
labor performed. Tbe money earned is taken
by the Quartermaster for the support ot the
old and infirm women and children; tbe sur
plus, between S3,00v and 4,ooo, Deing placed
to the credit of the contrabands, to be given
to them in small sums as necessity requires,
and to be turned over to them entirely when
it is known what disposition is to be made
of them.
GEN. M'CLELLAN AND FUGITIVE SLAVES.
Gen. McClellan Btands read v. it is under
stood, to carry out tbe suggestions! Secre
tary Welles wun respect to tugiuve slaves.
as many as possible of those for whom the
Navy Department can not npa employment,
will be taken into tne service oi tne uom
mander in-Chief of the army.
COLORADO.
Advices from Colorado Territory, just re-
ceived, state that tbe Territorial Governor,
Gilpin, is acting very strangely, ne is
throwing np fortifications on an extensive
and expensive scale, without the authority
of the government here. He says he wishes
to put the territory in a posture or derense,
and to do it after his own idea of what is
necessary, he issues scrip, promising that In
due time the eovernment will redeem it. At
last accounts this scrip was worth about
sixtv cents on the dollar. It is very doubt
ful whether tbe government will ever redeem
a dollar's worth or it.
CONGRESS.
Various opinions are held respecting the
lenoth of the present session of Congress.
Judge Collamer, of Vermont, who is one of
the shrewdest men in Congress, advises an
early adjournment. He says: ''War is not
a business Congress can engineer. It is
properly txecutivt butineti; and the moment
Congrecs passes beyond the line of providing
for the wants of the Government, and de
ciding tbe purposes of the war, to say how
it shall be conduoted, the whole thing will
prove a failure."
THE ARMY.
The Chroniclt to dav has a aisnificant ar
ticle upon putting the army of the Potomac
into barracks, or winter quarters. Tbe sim
ple truth is that the troops are gufi'ering very
much from tent-life in this cold ana wet
weather. They need the comfort of the
wooden hut. and must have it, unless the
army is really to move on southward at once.
Tbe increase of sickness in tbe army is alarm
ing, and a prudent General will heed at once
the indications furnished by the hospital re
norta. Henoa General McClellan bag issued
orders for the construction ef barracks for
the army.
ANOTHER DESERTER.
A deterter from the FirBt Regiment of
Virginia Volunteers says that Richmond is
converted into a great hospital, so many of
the rebels are sick. Disaffection, disappoint
ment and discomfort prevail among them.
This we learn from various sources. Beau
regard was at Fairfax Court-bouse last week,
end be then assured the rebels that they
should be in Washington this winter, proba
bly intending to imply that they would
tske it. .
JESSE D. BRIGHT.
The Senator from Indiana, Hon. Jesse D.
Bright, is loud in his protestations of de
votion to the Union. He declares that he
has been the victim of newspaper malice
that be baa been calumniated and misrepre
sented, that his loyalty has been questioned,
end efforts made to ruin him. He says that
be will have a resolution introduced to in
quire into the charges which have been made
egainBt him, and pledges himself to prove
that they are false.
HOW THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS RECEIVED
Tbe universal topic of conversation in
Wsshington, to day, is the President's Mes
sage. Opinions about it differ as widely as
do the partisan preferences of the people,
The ultra Abolition clement in Congress is
sorely disappointed by the utter failure of
tbeir efforts to engraft their principles either
on the President's Message or on any of the
Secretaries' reports. This class of politicians
declare the message to be tame and ineffect
ive. On tbe other hand, tbe moderate men
of all parties are highly pleased. They are
quite enthusiastic in praise of Mr. Lincoln.
Knowing the tremendous pressure that has
been brought to bear upon him to swerve
him from his purpose, they declare that he is
now fully tried and found the man of firm
cesB necessary to bis position. Tbe absence
of all passioD, boastipg and threats in the
message, and tbe kind and catholic spirit ex
hibited toward tbe deluded people of the in
surgent States, tire regarded as the highest
evidence of lofty statesmanship. As the
moderate men compose nine-tenths of the
population of the country, the message will
doubtless meet with popularity.
[Washington correspondence of Philad. Press.]
Letter from "Occasional"
Letter from "Occasional" WASHINGTON, December 3, 1861.
A single daj's observation and intercourse
among tbe members of Congress has led to
the conclusion that, with two or three insig
nificant exceptions, the Senutors and Repre
sentatives agree in utter detestation of tbe
whole rebellion, and in the uncompromising
spirit of putting it down at whatever cost.
Among those most urgent and resolute in
taking these positions are Democrats. There
is, indeed, a good dal of difference as to the
means or manner of giving effect to this
policy. Some are for a declaration of emna
cipaton of tbe slaves of the insurgents ; oth
ers for the confiscation of slave property;
and another class for levying a tax upon the
slaveholders, so that they may by such a
process feel the heaviest burdens of tbe war.
But on all sides, as well on the part of Thad
deus Stevens in the House and Lyman Trum
bull in tbe Senate, as well among the ultra
'Ramihlionna na nmnnff tllA nlt.ra riomno-ata
theie is an open expression that the property
ot tne loyai eiavenoiaers Brian oe protected
or paid for. A good deal of unnecessary
clamor has been created by mischievous men
on this subject.
The friends or tbe Administration and the
war have only to keep their eye on the issue
on which tbey really do agree as above
stated, and tbey can not divide. One great
truth stands out prominently, tbat tbe prop
erty of the traitors is forfeited by tbe acts of
traitors, and that it would be un)ust to ex
cept property in slaves from this rule. All
our loyal people ask that the houses and
lands, and gold and silver, and stocks and
securities, and cotton and powder, and can
non and ships, of Jefferson Davis and bis
robber associates should be confiscated, and,
rather than it should be used to damage and
destroy the Union, should be annihilated.
Would it not be monstrous if we excepted
from this rule the slaves of Davis and his fol
lowers? How to dispose of the slaves,
whether they shall be liberated or armed
whether the ownership in them shall be con
fiscated or taxed are matters wisely left by
tbe f resident and secretary ot w ar to tbe
military authorities. No doubt Congress
will pass some law by which these authori
ties may be guided in the disposition of this
vexed question ; but tbeir action will, in my
opinion, be regulated by the suggestions of
the President and the reasoning of his re
spective constitutional advisers.
A Soldier Shot for Sleeping While on
Duty. We learn that the remains of
member of Colonel Farnsworth's Cavalry
Kegiment passed tnrougn inis city, from
Washington, night before last, he having
been sentenced by a court-martial to be shot
for having slept while on duty as a guard.
The sentence was executed, and the body
was sent to his friends in Kane County. We
have not been able to learn the name of the
unfortunate man. It seems very hard to
execute such a penalty under the circum
stances, but the offense is regarded as one
of the most grave that a soldier can com-
pffiit, inasmuch as a whole camp is liable to
be captured rjy me enemy wneu tne guard
neglects his duty. Chicago Journal, 4A.
Bane Vault Broeen Open. Yesterday
woikmen were engaged in breaking into the
vault oi tne isanK ot tne state, not 'or tne
purpose of robbery, but to get at its contents
for the purpose of business. In locking the
vault on Saturdav a misplacement or mis-
numbering ot tne keys oi tne cnamoers

it was found impossible to open the vault

Journal, 6th.
A Washington letter in the New York
Commercial says:
Mrs. Lincoln is a constant attendant at re
views, and often visits tbe camps. There
not. however, tbat attention snown
by the officers which courtesy should dictate
toward the wife of tbe President. Every
Brigadier General has bis escort of cavalry,
but at a review not even an orderly is sent
to place the carriage of the President in
good position, but the driver has to take
chance among the omnibusses, hacks
sutlers' wagons. This is not rignt, even
our democratic land.
A man bv the name of Carnes. from Spen
cerville. lad., and a member of the Eleventh
Reeiment, met with a terrible accident

An Iron-Plated Steamer for the Government.
meat.
A Philadelphia firm is now at work upon
a new iron-plated steamer for the Govern
ment. The Ledger says :
The plates are fifteen feet long, twenty
eight and a half and thirty aad a half inches
wide, and four inches thick. A two and a
half tun hammer is required in their manu
facture. Borne doubt has been e; pressed as
to the ability of any iron works in these
parts to turn out such plates ; but we un
derstand that there is no difficulty about it.
After being received at the foundery the
plates are planed, the edges and ends being
made straight and smooth, and grooved like
a flooring-board. Tbe groove is one inoh
wide by half an inch deep. Screws are to be
used in fastening the plates to the planking
of the ship. They are to be put in from the
inside of the vessel, and are not to go
through the plates. The veasel is to be
covered with the plates four feet under
water, and three feet above it, and they
are to extend eighty-five feet fore and aft of
the center line, which will make one hun
dred and seventy feet of planking. The
iron is to come up to a line with the spar
deck, above which there will be a light rail.
Tbe sides of the ship, with a view to cause
the shot to glance, will have an angle of
thirty degrees from three feet above the
load line.
In order fo carry this extra weight the
ship has to be large. The tunnage of the
one under contract is to be three thousand
five hundred. She will be two hundred and
thirty feet long, sixty feet beam, and have
n draught of fourteen feet. In her construc
tion she will be different from the French ship
La Gloire, about which so much has been
written. The French ship is very doep in
tbe water, while the vessel to be built here
will be almost flat bottomed, which, not
withstanding the additional weight, will
make her of light draught. Her machinery
will be much the same as that of a first
clnss sloop-of-war, except that she will
have four boilers and a blower. The latter
is to make the boilers to steam even, though
the smoke stack should be shot away.
Refined sorghum Sirup
Messrs. Belcher & Co., the well-known and
eitensive sugar refiners in .this city, have
placed on our table two samples of sorghum
sirup. The one is Eorguum in its crude
state, and a sample of a lot of some twenty
barrels made from the Illinois plant of the
present year's growth, and is of a dark, thick,
semi sweetish taste, not, at all pleasant or
palatable. Tbe other sample is refined
sorghum, manufactured from the crude ar
ticle just referred to, and tbe difference be
tween tbe two, as compared, is about the
same in appearance, color and taste as exists
between common sugar-house molasses and
refined sirups. In the process of refininu-,
the peculiar odor, taste and color of the crude
article has been entirely removed, and in
stead of a sirup (by which name the crude
article has been improperly designated) com
posed ot a large proportion of gummy mat
ter, and which is better adapted for the man
nfacture of vinegar than for other uses, we
have a sirup which seems to us almost equal
to the best refined sirups in the market. As
to tbe process of refining, we shall probably
refer to tbat at length in some future article;
our present object being merely to call tbe
attention of those who have cultivated
sorghum thiB season to the fact that, unless
refined, crude sorghum is difficult to keep
and not at all agreeable to use. We have no
means of knowing what amount of sorghum
has been raised in this State this season, but
from items gathered bereand there wn should
infer tbat in some parts of the State its culti
vation bad been carried on extensively, and
that already a large yield has been the result.
The estimated yield per acre, of a good crop,

Religious Exercises on Board a United
States Vessel.
oi
A correspondent on board the United
States friga'o Potomac, off Ship Island, Oc
tober 22, 1861, writes as follows :
On Wednesday our captain started a
prayer-meeting, which is now very regularly
held every day. We begin by singing a
hvmn ; a chapter irom tne uiuie is men read,
her which some remarks are made by those
who desire to participate. Our captain and
most of the officers attend, together with
the crew. The First Lieutenant and Sur
geon are professors of religion and about
twelve of the crew. Sunday-school is also es
tablished, which is progressing well. Tbe
Lord is with us. More than one ot tbe men
have declared their determination to turn to
the Lord; and we trust that many may learn
to follow in the footsteps of the meek and
lowly Jesus.
Uff Mobile, jvovemoer 4. uur prayer-meetinc
is still regularly attended, and the same
interest manifested by all. Mr. J. J. Kane,
who is Master s Mate, is acting as Unaplain,
and is earnest and active in his efforts for the
spiritual welfare of tbose on board. Twelve
of tbe crew have manifested a desire to Join
the Church of tbe Lord, and we nope
soon to be able to chronicle the names of
many more.

who have been driven from their homes, and
whose property hag been plundered by the

derstands that such persons, afterward oomlng

from service or labor.
By the foarth section of the act of Congress
approved Aoarust 6. 1801. entitled "An act to
confiscate property nsed for Insurrectionary
purposes." such employment is made a full
and sufficient answer to any further claim to
servioe or labor. Persons thus employed and

of the United States, and their arrests as fugi

ately followed by a military arrest of the par

Why We do not Follow Up Our Advantages.
The Hilton Head correspondent of the New
York TTorH explains why our Southern army
does not advance :
"The question will naturally ocour to you,
when will General Sherman make an advanoe?
I can only answer this by stating the circum
stances wbion surround us. We are ignorant
of the number of rebels whioh may be but a
few miles Inland, and of the actual position of
the country. Our troops are in good oondition
and spirits, but are not very proficient in drill.
However, 11 orders Should be received lor an
immediate advance upon the Charleston and
Savannah Railroad, I have no doubt our
officers would cheerfully respond. Between us
and the mainland Is an almost Interminable
labyrinth of creek, and river, and Islands, and
an advanoe in foroe would be attended with
difficulties which I do not say, however, are
insurmountable. The probable reason why we
do not advanoe toward the interior Is because
Port Royal is decided for the present to be a
base of operations for another naval fleet des
tined still further southward. The taking of
Tybee Island and tha great prepaxanont
being made here sufficiently prove this.
Wherever the next expedition lands the blow
will be struck immediately Inland, as a large
number of horses are to be taken out for
eavalry."
