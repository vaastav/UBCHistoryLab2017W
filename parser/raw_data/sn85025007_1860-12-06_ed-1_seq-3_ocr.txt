I 'JJSPOKTED FOR THE ALEXANDRIA GAZETTE.]
I la Senate, Wednesday, Dec. 5.
The Senate was called to order at noon by
[be Vice President. After prayer and read
ing of the journal.
Hon. -J. Siidell, of.La., not present here
tofore appeared and took his seat.
Tb? chair laid before the Senate, the re
port of tlie Secretary of the Treasury, which,
Jn motion of Mr. Hale, was laid on the table
33lj ordered ro be printed.
>lr. Powell, of Ky., gave notice that, on to
morrow, he would move to refer so much of
the President's message as relates to politi
cal grievances, to a special committee.
Mr. Gre?n, of Mo., introduced the follow
io2 resolution:
Kesolvod, That the Committee on the judicia
ry be instructed to inquire into the propriety of
providing hy law fur the establishment of an
Briaed police force at (he necessary poiuts along j
tj,e ]ino separating the slaveholding from the I
uon-slavehoiding States, lor the purpose of rnaiu
laiuinj? thu general peace between the States, of
Inventing the invasion by citiaens of either, and,
for the efficient execution of the Fugitivo
Slave laws.
Laid ovu\ under the rule.
Jlr. Lane, ol Oregon, desired to address a
few words to the Senate upon the present!
position of affairs, lie did not think that j
Mr. Lincoln had been elected in accordance I
with the intention of the franters of the Con
stitution. lie believed that if the question
could be brought before the Supreme Court, j
to b? determined hv the intention of our ;
fathers, they would decide that Lincoln was !
aut constitutionally elected. [Mr. Hale?
laughing?No doubt of it.] Unless the
Sooth was allowed her rights in the common
territory of the Union, the Union would
bo dissolved, and it should be dissolved.
He proceeded at some length to comment
upon the positions recently assumed by I
.owe Northwestern Republican Senators, in
speeches and letters, which have been made i
public, and said that the government could
not be maintained on the ground they laid
down. I
Mr. Latham, of California, presented the
credentials of Hon. Edward I). Baker, Uni-1
ted Srates Senator elect from Oregon; and I
Mr. Baker was qualified and took his seat. !
The motion to print tho President's mes
sage coming up.
Mr. Hale, of N. II., said he bad been in
h'?pes that when the message was made that
it would please somebody. But in this he
had teen disappointed. The President fail
ed look the matter in the face, like the
ostrich, who hid his head iu the sand, thus
hoping to esc.tpe danger. If he understood
the President's position it was this. 1st.
South Carolina has just cause for secession.
2nd. She has no right to seccde. ,'ird. We
have no right to prevent her secession. It
was time to look this matter in the face.?
The position of affairs was this-: either un
conditional submission on the part of the
North to the demands of a siave oligarchy or
war. South Carolina understood this, and
was arming for the struggle. Whatever
might be the result of this conflict, whether
closed in peace or drenched in fraternal
blood, the proud little State he represented
would stand acquitted, not by posterity, for,
fur them he cared nothing?but by the ver
dict of the men of to-day?by the civilized
world. lie had nut shared the exultation of
those, who, in their Fourth of July orations
proclaimed our experiment, a success?He
had ever believed that we were but at the
beginning of our experiment, not yet beyond
the lifetime of the soldiers, who fought our
battles. Home had lived as a Republic six
hundred years, and had fallen. This ex
perimeMt was but the culmination of ages of
English conflicts between power and princi
ple, and now that it was to be perilled, he
thought we should look the difficulties which
beset us full in the face, lie spoke for him
self and his State, lie had had no com
munications with Lincoln and knew not his
o-jur-e. lie had been generally opposed to
administrations, and was not certain he
would not be opposed to Mr. Lincoln's ad
ministration. lie certainly would oppose
him, if he shirked looking the question full
in the face as Mr. Buchanan had done.
Mr. B rown, of Miss., said the Senator
troin .New Hampshire had presented the is
sue to the Southerners?you must submit or
we will make you.
Mr. Hale wished to set himself right; he
spoke but for himself and for a very small
State down East, and only half of that, lie
did not say that if the election of Lincoln
was not submitted to, wat ought to take place
but that as a matter of fact it would take
place.
.Mr. Brown, wished to know where the
war would came from. Would the Federal
Government make war upon the seceding
Stares. All they asked, was to be allowed
to depart iu peace. It that be refused, then,
indeed, war is inevitable, if we can not have
peace in the Union and are denied the poor
privilege of seeking it out of the Union, if
you will com pel us to submit to Northern
domination 'or make war upon us, then let
war come, and God defend the right.
Mr. Iverson. oi Ga., said he agreed iu
great part with the doctrines of the Presi
dent's message. He believed that secession
was a revolutionary right, and that parties
on both sides were rightful judges of the jus
tice of the cause alleged to justify secession.
If the other states in the exercise of this
judgment thought the secession of one state
from the Union, cause of war, nothing was
left the seceding state, but to accept the issue
and appeal to the God of Battles. The Sen
ator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Hale] had
tendered the issue of war. lie accepted it lor
his state. South Carolina, would soon be
high and dry out of the Union, Georgia
would not be behind Ler sisters. On the
18th of December, South Carolina would be
out of the Union. Alabama would follow
upon the 7th of January, and Georgia on the
1'ith; then would come other states, so that,
by the time of Lincoln's inauguration, a
Southern Confederacy of five, or it might be,,
sight Stares would be formed. The repeal
"f personal liberty bills would do no good,
Qioh law would still run off the slaves, and
the aggressive anti-shivery spirit be as vic
? ant as ever. All the South must eventual
ly unite outside of the Union. If the hoary
headed Houston continued to stand in the
*ay of the expression of the will of the peo
ple of Texas, some Texian Brutus would rid
fetare of its oppressor. Gentlemen who
were most blatant did not always show
themselves the most brave. The boaster of
|he 18,000,000 men whn were to conquer the
?^>uth, stood himself the next day trembling
before a little switch in the hands of the
j uuisher of his insolence. This difficulty
between the North and the South hid grown
too extensive for reconciliation. There was
a gulf deep as hell between them, lie ad
verted to the want to social relations between
Remembers on the floor from the two sec
tions. Tije North sat on une side and tho
??uth on the other, and he had seen no man
Cro8s the line since the session began. We
two hostile bodies here, and be believed
|n his heart that the North hated the South,
lie told his brethren that there was no
lost. (Seusation.) There was no peace
there never would bo peace botween the
8ectious. If the South was permitted to
() so, she would retire peaceably, if not she
^ouid welcome her invaders with bloody
builds to hospitable graves.
*Ir. Davis, of Miss., said he had no desire
l" take part jn t|ie debate. His State would
<-on:-,tjer the subject herself, and he would
Cj'.m-se in her decision. He hoped, how-'
. f -that as long as th? Senators remained
| '^ether as embassadors from sovereign States
?ey would avoid threats of war, harsh words
^ preserve, a6 leasts tho forma of friendship.
Mr. Wigfnll addressed the Senate in a
constitutional argument, controverting rhe
doctrines of the message and Mr. lverson,
and maintaining the constitutional right of
secession. lie declared that J he President's
i doctrine wan difficult- to comprehend, and
said, so far as he understood it, he did not
agree with it. lie regretted that the Presi
dent had declared his intention to collect
the revenue iu the ports of a seceding State.
Mr. Lane said that he did not understand
the President to declare that he would col
lect. duties in a foreign port?the port of a
j State after she had seceded.
Mr. Wigfall thought his own view of the
j message was the correct one. lie regretted
j the tone of the message in regard to Fort
I Moultrie, and as the President had declared i
: that orders had been given to the officers at
11 ^ I
j that Fort to act strictly on the defensive, he !
: would take occasion at an early day to move '
for a copy of the order, that South Carolina j
might know what to expect. Frederick the j
Great tirst took a fortress, and then negotia- j
ted in reference to ir. When this intelii- I
gence of the determination of the President |
was known in S juth Carolina, the people j
there might imitate Frederick's example, ;
and the conflict be precipitated at once, lie ;
did not think that there would be any l>ru- j
tus to avenge upon Gov. Houston his fail- I
ure to respond to the wishes of the peo- j
pie of Texas, lie thought that the Cover- j
nor would respond at la*t to the people's j
wish ; if he did not there might bo a revolu- j
tion, but there would be no assassination? j
when the people of Texas shed blood, they j
shed it openly. At the conclusion of Mr. j
Wigfall's .speech,
Mr. Lane protested against the idea that
the President intended to precipitate a con
flict. tie had never declared he would malts
any effort to coerce a State. The jnan who
shed the first blood in this contest, would be
the greatest murderer that overlived.
Mr. Salisbury, of Del., said that his State ?
had been the tirst to adopt the Constitution, j
and she would be the last to abandon ir. !
[Applause in the galleries.] He regretted ;
this contest, and had no position to define, j
When the work of our fathers was domol-;
ished, and not till then, Delaware would
prepare to face the evils which would ensue.
I Loud applause in the galleries ]
The motion to print the message was \
adopted.
The President laid before the Senate a I
communication from the Secretary of State, |
which was laid ou the table and ordered to !
be printed.
On motion of Mr. Hamlin, the Senate then, i
at 2^ o'clock, adjourned.
House of Heprsssntativ *s.
The House met at 12 o'clock. Prayer by
Rev. Dr. Stockton, the chaplain.
Mr. Spauldin?; said that Mr. Edward 11.
Reynolds, ofKy., was now present, and ask
ed that he now be sworn in. lie according
ly took the oath.
The Speaker laid before the House a re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury. Laid
on the table, and extra numbers ordered to
be printed.
Mr. Sherman, from the Committee on
Ways and Means, reported a bill making
appropriations for the payment of invalid and
other pensions; and a bill for the support of
the West Point Academy. Referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The House, by a vote of 68 against 125 re
fused to lay on the table Mr. Grow's motion
to reconsider the vote by which the Home
stead bill was last session referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The House then reconsidered the vote on
the bill thus brought up for action.
Mr. Grow, said he did not desire to diseuss
this measure, the principle involved having
been familiar to the country for the j?ast ten
years. This bill, however, avoids the pro
minent objections in President Buchanan's ,
veto message. It does not propose to donate
glands, but it requires a payment often dol
lars for 100 acres. Me might, if necessary,
quote President J.ickson against President
Buchanan, to show that the former was of
the opinion'that the public lands should not
bo a source ol Federal revenue, lie conclud
ed by moving the previous rjuf-stion, undor
the operation of which the bill was passed?

Mr. Colfax moved that the post route bill,
returned from the Senate at the former ses
sion with amendments, lie referred to the
Post Office Committee, lie remarked that
there had been no so such i>iil passed for the
last three years, and it was desirous to have
action upon ic as soon as possible.
Mr. Smith, of Va,, said that the gentle
man knew that many of the post routes did
| not pay, and he would object to any present
action on the subject.
Mr. Colfax?That's true, but Ave draw our
pay. He had performed his duty as to this
matter, and said, in conclusion, that there
were several reforms proposed in the bill and
the P. M. General was anxious to know the
disposition of Congress as to the contracts
with railroads.
The objections to taking up and referring
the bill were persisted in.
On motion of Mr. Grow, the House resolv
ed itself into a Committee of the Whoie in
order to take up the Military Academy ap
propriation bill and the invalid pension hill.
Those bills were ordered i<> he reported to
the House with a recommendation that they
pass, and the committee lose, and tiio bills
were passed.
The House then, at 2 o'clock, adjourned.

DirrrruLTVON Board the Mail Boat.?"We j
j understand that a difficulty-occurred on board ;
! (he Mail steamer from--Aquia Creek, yester
j (]av afternoon, which came near leading to
a serious result. It appear* that a, man Irom :
Connecticut, who has been travelling through ;
a portion oi the South made some remarks j
! at various times, derogatory ol South Caron- |
na and her citizen.-. These remarks were j
lienrd by a Virginian, a native of South Garo- j
! lina, who resented them, calling the man i
irom Connecticut a d n liar and scoutt- !
drel, and challenging him to mortal combat i
in the forward part of the steamer, and oaei- ;
ing to furnish him either a pistol or bowie-j
knife as a weapon. This occurred at the |
dining-table and caused great excitement |
and consternation. The Connecticut man de^!
dined the ehallengo?when the Captain of
the steamer and many of the passengers in
terfered, and any further difficulty was pre
vented. The man from Connecticut was,
however, advised not to obtrude his obnoxious
views in the presence of Southerners, unless
he was prepared to meet the cousequcnces.
On 'Ciianue.?The receipts of flour and j
o-raiu for the past few weeks have been gra- i
dually falling off, and are now very light? .
not more than sufricieot to supply the limi- j
ted demand. Prices have been unsettled j
but low, and to this cause, produced by the ;
present deranged condition ol the country, j
may be attributed the withholding of grain .
on the part of farmers. Should there be an i
improvement in prices, a large increase in ,
receipts could not bo looked lor until alter
the holidays. It is said that the present
state of the wheat market is advantageous
to millers, who have now a margin on low
trades of Hour, while heretofore their profits
have been confined exclusively to the highei
grades. Financially', there is still a great
depression, and business in all branches is
more or less injuriously affected by the pre
sent unhappy state of affairs in the country.

Arrival of Coal Boats.?Forsome weeks
past there has been an almust entire suspen
sion of navigation on the C. & 0. Canal in
consequence of injuries received from a heavy
freshet, and our people had almost given up
the idea of seeing any more coal arrive this
season. Yesterday afternoon, however, those
in the neighborhood of the Canal basin v> ei e
ai'reeably'surprised by the noise of the first
boat from Cumbci land breaking the ice as she
came slowly along, and before night a numb
er of others'had arrived. As there was but
little Coal here, comparatively, the intelli
gence of those arrivals will be ^ratifying_ to
our manufacturing as well as coal snipping
interest.
The latest detention on the canal was can- |
sed by a sunken boat.
The Putnam Phalanx.?This company j
arrived iu Washington yesterday evening, i
and will, without doubt, attract a vast deal
of attention. Their object is to keep alive
the memory id' the patriots of the Revolu
tion. Their uniform is an exact imitation of
that worn by General Washington during
the Revolutionary period. The organization j
is three years old. and it comprise two him- |
dreu and forty active members, of whom the i
Commander is Mr. Horace Oojdwin, aged i
seventy-six years and standing six feet six i
inches high. All the members of this corps
are direct descendants of Revolutionary pa
triots, and it is stated that the "Phalanx"
represents an amount of wealth exceeding j
eight millions of dollars. They will visit
Mount Vernon this morning in the Oollyer.

very thick at the point he fell, he escaped
without receiving any more serious injuries

THE gazette's SPECIAL DISPATCH.
Washington, Dec. ?The debate in the
Senate, to-day, cast a gloom over the heart
of the patriot; few left the Senate without
the most sad forebodings of the future of
the country. The Union men are, however,
determined to make a rally upon the report
of the Boteler-eommittee?if that fails, nil
hope of a continuance ot the Union will be
over.
The low ebb of money in the treasury was
exhibited again to-day in a marked manner
by the refusal of Mr. Cobb to pay the sala
ries of the employees of some of the ouices at
the Capitol.
The standing committee of the House of
Representatives of the last year continue the
same, with the following exceptions:?Mr.
Howard, of Michigan, on Ways and Means,
in place of Mr. Washburne, excused: Mr.
Iventy on Public Buildings and Grounds^in
place of Mr. McPherson, excused; Mr. Me
Pherson on Naval Affairs, in place of
Schwartz, deceased; Mr. Barrett on Public
Lands, in place of Blair, not now a member
of the House.
The Cabinet at its Tuesday evening ses
sion had under consideration a very delicate
question. Col. Anderson in command at |
Fort Moultrie reports that the force there is j
inadequate to hold the fortress against an
attack and asks additional troops. Several
members of the Cabinet fear that a movement
of United States troops in tiiat direction
would at once precipitate civil war. The
matter still remains in .vlulu quo, but know
ing ones say that there will be no reinforce
ment of troops at Fort Moultrie.
.New developments before the House Com
mittee on the Judiciary in tho case of Judge
Watrous, of Texas, will lead to his impeach
ment in the course of ;i few weeks.
THE ASSOCIATED l'Ri S? DISIAfCII.
Washington. Dee. 5.?Among tho propo
sition.- privately discussed here is one loot
ing to the appointment of it delegation by
the conservative members'uf Congress from
the slave holding States, to proceed to the
South Carolina Convention with a view to
conference and an appeal to that State to
pause in her present movements.
The suggestion is made in intelligentcir
cles that when the Special Committee on
Hon. A R. Boteler's resolution shall be an
nounced, the influential and conservative
men in each State shall thereupon communi
cate with ihe members ofthe Committee, thus
contributing to the extent of their power
to some practicable mode for quieting tho
present political excitement. Several schemes
are already discussed with a view to the
adjustment ot the present difficulties?
one of them is to make an effort to concili
ate, at lean a large majority of the slave-hold
ing and non-sluveholding iStat.es, whatever
course the ultra States may choose to pursue.
The President's Message in Virginia.
Richmond, Ya., Dec. 4.?The President'*
Message was received here this evening, and
created a great, sensation on account of the
President's views and intentions regarding
secession. It. goes very much against the
inclinations of the -disunionists. who aver
that they ought to be allowed to sccede
peaceably, if they cim. S ?me are of the opin
ion that the President's instructions to ihe
commander of F >rt Moultrie will cause a
great deal of trouble, and serious apprehen
sions are entertained in regard to it; but this
is altogether an idle conjecture. Public opin
i >n is not yet made up in regard t:> the mat
ter. Comorvatives consider the President's
Message a liiie production.
I learn that Hon. J. M. Botts has writ
ten a long letter setting forth his scheme for
settling th<* slavery quettion. It is an en
tirely original scheme, and if adopted will
give satisfaction to both North and South. It
is anxiously looked for by the public.
