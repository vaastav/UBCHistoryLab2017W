A REPUBLICAN FORM OF 00VERH1ŒIT
From indications that sur found withers
is reason to suppose that the authorities
of Louisiana may be compelled to demand
of the federal government the lawful exe
cution of that provision of the conEtitution
which requires it to guarantee to each
State a republican form of government.
A republican government is that which
has been adopted by the vote of citizens
qualified by law. This government must
be executed by officers and representa
tives chosen by a majority of the voters.
There can be no assurance that all
these voters will go to the polls, and ii
the aggregate vote cast in a State fall be
low the whole number of qualified voters,
there would be no reason for setting aside
an election for such cause. When, how
ever, it shall appear that such portions Of
the voters of a State have been under
duress by fear of life or (under the law of
Congress) by deprivation of employment,
and that officers acting under the law
have been systematically prohibited
from performing their duty in organizing
or executing the official administration of
the government and laws, a case of ob
struction to the representative choice of
the people will have been proven. It
will, in such case, then be apparent that
no government in form republican exists
in such State. It will then become the
duty of the federal government to guaran
tee, by a new election and inaugura
tion of lawful officers and representatives,
such Republican form of government as
was intended aud enacted by those who
framed the federal constitution. In such
case the Stato authorities can give no
relief under the legal judgment on the
returns and election of its own members,
because these State authorities are them
selves held in duress and their legal fane
rions paralyzed by violence.
It is not expected that Congress will act
upon the ex parte statement of a news
paper, nor that it will perform a duty so
grave upon the complaints of Republicans
evicted or excluded lrom office. Congress
may send a committee to investigate the
facts before taking steps in compliance
with any call to be made by the proper
Stute authorities. It is a case differing
from the mere existence of domestic vio
lence. We will, as a guide to this inquiry,
state succinctly the reasons which may be
alleged for this demand on the federal
government by the State authorities of
Louisiana :
1. An appeal has been made to Con
gress to determine between contending
claimants for seats in that body. This
incidentally involves a decision upon the
legality of the State government. ,
2. Disregarding this appeal, one of the
parties on the record has organized a
military force throughout the State with
the effect: 1. Of driving the State gov
ernment from possession of the offices.
2. Of keeping from the polls, or control
ling by threats, voters who desire to exer
cise the right of free suffrage.
3. Holding in fear of their lives officers
appointed by law to certify the list of rep
resentatives and officers prima laeie enti
tled to seats and commissions.
4. Disregarding two proclamations of
the President commanding the same ille
gal organization to desist from acts of
domestic violence.
These allegations will, if proven to the
satisfaction of Congress, form a basis lor
such intervention as will, by new election
or otherwise, assure to Louisia na a repub
lican form of government.
We will only comment upon the third al
legation in the above category. The Return
ing Board is beset by astute attorneys and
beleaguered by armed bands ambushed,
in the ordinary occupations of society, but
ready to execute the orders of their chiefs.
The attorneys for the White League hourly
admonish the Returning Board what they
may do. The organs of the White League
daily inform the board what it must do.
The penalty of failure to obey these or
ders is to be a repetition of the violence of
the fourteenth of September.
The Returning Board is not permitted
to act on its own construction of the law.
It is not allowed to do acts identical with
thoso performed by a preceding board,
composed of members of the present
White League. One example will be given:
The board proposes to suspend considera
tion of the vote of Sabine parish. The
polls show a Democratic vote of 841, and
a Republican vote of *2. The table of
population shows in 1870—whites, 4592;
colored, 1847. Taking one voter to every
five souls as a rule, this would give a
wliito vote of 918, and a colored Vote of
369. Certainly there should have been
more than two colored voters, disposed to
vote, among 1847 persons.
It would be unreasonable to assert that
the colored voters in Sabine voted with
the whites, because the whole Vote of the
whites is short of the white strength. It
is 841 out of 918.
Now what will the public think when
informed that a Returning Board ot 1872,
composed of some of the present White
Leaguers, made the following just ruling
in regard to the parish of Jefferson:
There were 555 Fusion tickets, and not a
single Republican ticket, while it was
known to lie a Republican district. * *
We thought it conclusive evidence ot fraud,
and did not count them.
This honorable decision Was good law
in l'sT J. when declared by a Fusion Re
turning Board. If the Returning Board
should now exclude the whole vole of
Sabine, because *1 is absurd to suppose
that but two persons voted Out of some
thing lest* than two thousand, they are
threatened vith a condign and infamous
death.
We will not repeat the examples her?'
tofore given of the discrepancy between
the White League altornejs anil the deci
sions of the Fusion Returning Board of
1872. Kuongh has been shown to prove
the existence in Louisiana of an illegal
combination which tends to the overthrow
of republican government by means ille
gal aul unknown to the constitution of
the federal or Mtate governments.
If this illegal combination choose to
take the violation of law into their own
hands, defeat the will of the voters and
overthrow the State government, their
triumph will scarcely exceed in duration
that of the fourteenth to seventeenth of
September. A ease will have been con
mmmated in which an outride and illegal
force will have nullified the law; and Con
gre«, upon a formal finding of the facts,
and the application of the State authori
ties, will be reqnired to guarantee a repub
lican form of government to Louisiana.
A88A88IlfATI0H A8 A POLITICAL REMEDY.
We publish in another column a letter
Charles A. DeRudio, lieutenant Seventh
Cavalry, United States army. It is a re
markable historical document, and will
bring again to the notice of Europe a
revolutionist who had forfeited his life
to the power he attempted to overthrow,
now holding an honorable commission
ander the government of the United
States. To ns it comes as a most oppor
tune illustration of the principle dis- -
cussed in these columus. Has the citizen
of a republic a right to overthrow by per
sonal assassination or other violence the
government which he had engaged to
support ?
Lieutenant DeRudio, an Italian sub
ject, lias based the justification of an at
tempt to overthrow an imperial govern
ment in France on two grounds: 1. That
Napoleon III. had attempted to intervene
in the political affairs of Lieutenant De
Radio's then country, Italy. 2. That
Napoleon being, according to Lieutenant
DeRudio's belief a usurper, tyrant and
oppressor, stood as host's humani generis,
and might as lawfully have been killed
by any person as any other pirate. Lieu
tenant DeRudio assumes, therefore, that
himself and associates took upon them
selves this duty of executing a common
obligation of humanity, and that they
stand upon similar pedestals before pos
terity with the slayers of Ciesar, Holo
fernes and Gessner. This reasoning is
very much the same with that employed
by our alien instructors of the Bee. It is
in both cases fallacious because inappli
cable. If Mr. DeRudio had been a sub
ject of a government based on force, his
right to change by force a form of gov
ernment not of his choice would liav e
been undoubted. In such case he would
have had the same right. to overthrow a
government of force by force, as had
either of the heroic types of hiscory. His
right to go out on a general mission of
killing the oppressors of other nations can
scarcely be justified by any improper
intervention of a foreign oppression in
the affairs of his (DeRudio's) own country.
But assuming that he had been the sub
ject of a form of government not of his
choice we repeat that he as a subject
would undoubtedly have had a right to
change that form of government by any
revolutionary act. Captain John Smith,
the founder of an American colony, was
captured somewhere in Transylvania. He
is depicted in the books in irons, with his
head shaven, the slave of the Turk.
Captain John beat out the brains of bis
master and fled on bis horse. In this
John Smith was n® party to this labor
contract, and he terminated it in the
shortest and most effectual manner pos
sible, nor has any publicist ever question
ed his right or criticised his aet.
Personally, we would prefer to any act
of revolutionary violence an assemblage
of the people, with an exposition of the
reasons which justified the proposed
change, the levy aud organization of
troops with some fiscal system that would
relieve the necessity of living by spoils
of the army on free quarters of our own
people. This rather than the poignard,
or poison or explosives. The customs of
nations, however, differ, and in admitting
the principle of individual or associate
right to overthrow any form of govern
ment not the choice of the subject, we
leave the fashion of means to national
usage. Where we prefer Runnymede and
Magna Charta Lieutenant DeRudio would
perhaps choose a bomb and fuse, while a
French communist would possibly resort
to petroleum. Wo excuse, therefore,
Messrs. DeRudio and the Bee man, be
cause of the total difference between the
Neapolitan and Parisian reasoning and
the remedies of our own.
Lieutenant DeRudio has of his own
free choice renounced allegiance to nil
other countries and become a citizen of
the United States. Would ho assassinate
the Preside nt of the United States, even
if he personally thought as badly of him
as he has done of Napoleon? He could
not logically do so, because be, as as citi
zen of the republic, bas agreed that if
any question of legal construction, public
policy or official conduct shall arise, he
will not settle it according to his personal
opinion on the merits by a bombshell or
a stiletto, but will resort to the tribunals
offended, according to bis own agreement,
or to the electoral means of effecting a
change of public agents, as provided for
by the constitution. The whole difference
between the moral obligations of Mr.
DeRudio, the subject of a government of
force, and Mr. DeRudio the citizen
of a republic, lies just in this. The
subject may right himself by per.
sonal means, the citizen must right him
self by the means which the law has pro
vided and pointed out to him. Mr.
DeRudio will thus see that his illustration
of his right to assassinate, predicated
Upon the invasion of the United States by
some oppressive conqueror, has no appli
cation. Meu would have revolutionary
rights of violence under a government to
which they were not parties, which they
w ould not have under a republicau and
representative constitution.
There has been but one assassination in
our federal history- that of Mr. Lincoln.
It was perpetrated by one who acknowl
edged the dastardly character of the deed
by flying. It would have been wholly
unpardonable even as an act of war.
The whole nation and the whole
, Kouth hastened to denounce the aet as a
horrible crime. It affords no precedent.
We express no opinion of the justification
of Mr. DeRndio's act. It was a Euro,
peau act in a European country, com.
mitted under circumstances which w-e can
not appreciate, because we are citizens of
a republic with legal remedies, not sub
jects of a despotism under which there
are no legal remedies.
The reputation of Lieutenant DeRudio
a- a good cilizea and a good soldier, the
indorsement of eminent men in other
countries, and the entire exoneration from
the charge of having abased his acci
dental power over the citizen of a free
country, warrants us in extending entire
confidence to his "irreproachable Euro
pean career." _
THE TAX ON LABOR.
If it be a grievance, as President Grant
truly shows it to be, to compel a man
who has earned a dollar to accept ninety
cents for it, what must we call that system
in New- Orleans which offers to labor no
more than thirty per cent of the ninety
per cent thus excepted to? The President
contends that the money used for the
payment of laborers should be of full
value, incapable of depreciation and
exigible for all transactions between man
kind in which balances are adjusted in
cash.
New Orleans bas its full share of bard
money men, who let their sympathies go
cut in a strong, full current for the poor
factory men, the railroad laborers and all,
aud singular who are compelled to take
greenbacks for pay instead of specie. At
the same time they give the employes of
their own city and State the option be
tween State warrants worth, perhaps,
fifty cents in paper on the dollar, or in
city time, worth about thirty-five or
forty cents in the same currency. Yet
our hard money men, who applaud the
President and revere the memory of Old
Bullion think anything is good enough
for our policemeh school teachers, city
and State employes, and public creditors
of all kinds. Specie payment is vastly
too valuable a principle to be wasted upon
the common herd at home. It is well
enough to introduce it into transactions
between landlord and tenant, perhaps,
where the latter do all the paying, but it
should never be carried so far as to those
between masters and servants. Our hard
money men have one currency for the
poor and another for themselves, though
it looks well in them to approve more
liberal sentiments in the President's
message.
A very large part of the labor of New
Orleans pays not only the ten per cent
difference between gold and greenbacks,
bnt the more appalliDg difference be
tween greenbacks and what they receive.
Poor people have been compelled to suffer
a shave as high as seventy per cent. In
the meantime enormous quantities of the
most productive real estate in tho city
pay no taxes whatever. The Council is
about to move on their works, notwith
standing the feeble attempt of the Mayo»,
who is no doubt s bard money' man, to
stay proceedings. Our half starved, over
taxed laborers are crying for current
money of any sort, soft or hard, while
those who so wickedly withhold it feel
none of the privations so familiar to pov
erty. The signs are favorable for a
change in public sentiment upon this
question, and when that comes it will not
need an honest journal to point out those
who will be distressed by enforcing exact
justice.
The Returning Board is now very near
the close of its labors. The members will
therefore soon cease to be the target for
political abuse and the objects of the
small fry bullying that bas been the staple
stock in trade of the White League jour
nals. With their retirement our sensation
mongers will be threatened with want of
employment. Having been in the busi
ness of abusing somebody so long it is
believed their machinery is not adapted
to any other kind ot work.
There will be little or no canvassing of
votes hereafter. The duties of the board
will be to deliberate upon the questions
which have already been argued before
them and illustrated by such testimony
as was attainable. As there will be no
special need for counsel, perhaps the
meeting» will be more private than those
heretofore held. There is a remarkable
subsidence of bluster, now that the days
of this well abused tribunal have drawn so
near to a close. To an outsider it would
go far to strengthen any suspicions that
may have been formed that there has
been an unsuccessful attempt made at
bluffing.
