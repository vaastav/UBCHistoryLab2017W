PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.
To the Senate and IIou.se of Representatives:
In (joining before you for the first time
iu Chiof Magistrate of this great nation, it
in with Krtititudo to tbe Giver of nil Rood
for tkn mauv benefits we euioy, We ere
blenseil with peace at home.niid are without
eiiWntjliiig alliuDcea abroad to foroboilo
trouble, with a territory uuHurnasaeil ia fer
tility, of iu area equal to the abundant sup
port of five hundred millions of people,
nud abounding ia evory variety of use
ful mineral ia quantity sufficient to
supply the world for generations, with
exuberant crops and vith a variety
of oliniRta adapted to the production of
every specie of earth's riches, and snitod
to the habits, tastes and rqnirmenU of
every living thing; with o population of
forty millions of free people, all spoaking
onelanguafio; with facilities for every uior
tul to acquire an ediioation; with institu
tions closing to none the avonues to fame,
or any blessing or fortune that may be cov
eted; with freedom of the pulpit, the press,
and the school; with a revenue flowing into
the national treasury beyond the
requirements of Govurnoient sup
ply. Uurinony is being rapidly
restored within our own borders. Maun.
fiictiiris hitherto unknown in our country
are springing up inalldireotioDH.producing
a degree of national independence une
qualed by t iat of any other power. These
blowings, and countless others, are in
trusted to your care, and more for enfe
keeping for the brief period of our tenure
of ollice. In a Bhort time we must each ot
us return to tbe ranks of the people, who
have conferred upon us our honors, aud
account to them lor our stewardship. I
earnestly desire that neither you nrr I may
be condemned by a free and enlightened
constituency, nor by our own con
science. Emorgiug from a re
bellion ot gigantic magnitude, aided
as it was by tbe sympathy and as
sistance ot nations with which we were at
peace, eleven Stiitos ol the Union wore
four 'years ago loft without legal state
governments; a debt had been contracted;
American commerce was almost driven
from the seas; the industry of one-half
the country had been taken from the oon-
trol of the capitalist aud placed where all
labor rightfully belongs, in tho keeping of
the laborer. The work of restoring the
state governments loyal to the Union,
of protecting and fostering froe labor and
providing means for paying interest on the
public dubt has ree'd ample attention from
Congress; although your efforts havo not
met wiili the success, in all particulars, that
might have been desired, yet on the whole
they have boon more successful than could
have beeu reasonably anticipated. Seven
states which passed ordinances of secession
havo been fully restored to their places in
the Union. The eighth, Georgia, held an
election, at which she ratified hor consti
tution, republican in form, eleeted a gov
ernor, members of Congress, a state legis
lature and all otlipr ollicers required. ihe
governor was dully iuRUlled aud the legis
lature met ami performed all the acts
therein reauired of them by the
reconstruction acts of Congress. Subse
quently, however, ia violation of the coa-
btitutiou which they had 31M ratmei, as
nines decided by the Supreme Court ot the
state, they unseated tie colored members
of tho legislature, aud admitted to seats
some members who are disqualified bv the
third clause of the fourteenth amendment
to the constitution, an article which tliey
themselves had contributed to ratily, Uu
der these circumstances, I would submit to
you whether it would not be wise without
delay to enact a law authorizing trie gover
nor of Oeoria to convene the members
originally elected, requiring each
member to take the oath prescribed by tho
reconstruct m act, and none to bo admitted
who are ineligible under the third clause of
the fourteenth amendment. The freednieu
under the protection which they have re
ceiveil are making rapid progress in learn
ing, mid no complaints are heard for lack
of industry on their part, when they re
oeivo fair rouiunuration for tuoir labor.
The meruit, provided for payiuj the in
terest 011 the public debt with till other
expenses of tho Government are
more thin ample. The loss of our com
merce is tho only result of the lute rebel
lion which has not received snlfloient at
teutiou from yoa. To this subject I call
your earnest attention. I will not now sug
gest plans by which this object may be ef
tected, but will, if necessary, make it the
subject of a special message during the
soNgioii of Congress.
At the March term Congress, by joint
resolution, authorized the executive to or
dor an election in the states of Virginia,
Mississippi and Texi, to submit to them
the constitutions which each had previous
ly in convention framed and submitted,
the Constitution, either entire or in separate
parts, to be voted upon, at the discretion
of the Executive. Under this authority,
elections were called. In Virginia the elec
tion took place on the Cth of July, 18C!i.
The Governor and Lieutenant Governor
elected have been installed. The Legisla
ture met and did all required by this reso
lution and by all the reconstruction acts of
Congiess, and abstoined from nil doubtful
authority. I recommend that her Senators
and Representatives be recognized, and
that the staU be ful'y restored to its place
in tbefamily of states. Electionswerecallod
in MissisNippi and Texas, to cnmaieno
on the JJOth of November, 10G9, and to last
two days iu Mississippi and four days in
Texas. The elections have token place, but
the result is not known, It is to be hoped
that the acts of the Legislators of these
states, when they meet, will be such as to
roceive your approval, and thus close the
work of reconstruction.
Among the evils crowing ont of the re'
bollion, and not yet referred to, is that of
an irredeemable currency. It is an evil
which, I hope, will receive your most
earnest attention. It is a duty, and ono of
the highest duties, ol the Government to
Bflcore to the citizens a medium of
exchange of fixed, unvarying val
ue, This implies a return to a
specie basis, and no substitute for it can
be dtmed. It should bo commencod now,
and reached at the earliest practicable mo
ment, consistent with a lair regard to tho
interest of the debtor class, Immediate re
sumption, if practicable, would not be de
nimble. It would compel the debtor class
to pay beyond their contracts tho premium
of gold at the date of thoir purchaso, and
would bring bankruptcy and ' ruin
to thoumnls. Fluctuations, howover,
in the paper valuo of tho measure
of all values, gold, is detrimental to the in
terests of trade; it makes a man ofbusi
11 ess an involuntary gambler, for in all
KftlflS when future payment is to be made,
both parties speculate as to what will be
the value of the currency to bo paid and
reueiv d. I earnestly recommend to you,
then, such legislation as will insure a grad
ual return to specio payments, and put an
immmlitite stop to fluctuations in the value
ol currency, The methods to Hucnro these
results are as numerous as the speculations
on political economy. To saanro Die
latter I boo but ono way, and that is,
to authorize the treasury to ruder-mitsown
paper at a llx')d price whenever presented;
to withhold trom circulation alt such cur
rency redoouaed until sold again for gold;
the vast resources ol the nation, both de
veloped mid undeveloped, ought to tnaka
our credit the het on earth, with a less
burden of taxation than the citiznn has en
dured for nix years past, tho pntire pnblio
debt could bn paid in ten ye us. Rut it ii not
desirable that people should not be taxed to
pay it In that time; year by year, the ability
to pay increases in 0 rapid ratio, but the
burden of Interest ought to be reduced as
rapidly as can bn done wttliont tlw viola
tion of contract. The pnllia debt is rep
resented in great part by bonds having Ironi
live to ten and from ten to forty years to
run, bearing Interest at the rate of six per
cent, and Ave per cent, respectively. It is
optional with - the Gorerninmit to.
pay, their bonds at any I period af
ter , the ' expiratitm of the least tirne
mentioned upon their Ihco. The time has
expired when a great part of thcin may be
taken, and the time 1h rapidly approaching
whon all may he. It is believed that all
which are now Jua may lo"replaood by
bonds bearing a rate of interest not ex
ceeding four aud a half per oent , and that
as rapidly as the remainder become due
they may ba Toplaood in some way.
To aooomplish thl t it may become neces
sary to authorize interest to be, paid at
eitbor of the three or four monoy centers
of Europe, or by the Assistant Treasurer
of the United States, at the option
of the holder of the bond. I
snggestthis subject for the consideration
of Congress; also, simultaneously with this,
the propriety cf redeeming our currency,
as before suggested, at its market value, at
the time a law goes into effect increasing
tho rote at which the currency will be
bought and sold, from day to day, or week
to weekt at the same rate of interest as the
government pays upon its bonds.
Tho subjeot of tariff and internal taxation
will necessarily receive your attention.
Tho revenues of the oountry are
greater than the requirements, and
may with safety be reduced, but as the
funding of the debt iu a four or a four and a
half par cent, would reduce the annual
ourreut expense lurgely; thus after fund
ing and justifying a grealer reduction of
taxation than would be now expedient, I
suggest a uostpoaemenb of this question
until the next inoetiug of Congress whon
it may be advisable to modify taxation and
the tivriff in instances where unjust or
burdensome discriminations are made by
the present laws, but a generul revision
of the laws regulating the subjeot, I re
commend the postponement of for the
present. I ako suggest tho renewal of the
tax on incomes, but at a reduced rato, say
of 3 per cent. ; this tax to expuo in three
years with the funding ot the national debt
as hero suggested. I feel safe in saying the
taxes and revenue trom imports may be
reduced safely from (it) to BO millions per an
num at once and still further reduction from
year to year as the resources of the country
are developed.
The report of the secretary or tne treas
nry shows the receipts of the government
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 18(19, to
be 370,913,347 dollars, aud the expenditures
including interest, bounties, Ao , to be
321,'W0,5!)7 dollars. The estimates for the
ensuing year are more tavorable to the Gov
ernuieut, and will, uo donbt.showfi large de
crease ol the publio debt. The receipts in the
Treasury beyond expenditures have exceed
ed the amount neoessary tobeplaood to the
oredit ot the sinking fund as provided by
law. To lock up the surplus in the Treas
ury and withhold it from circulation, would
lead to such contraction of the currency as
to cripple trado and seriously affect the
prosperity of the country. Under these
circumstances, tne secretary or tne ireas
ury and myself heartily concurred in the
propriety of rising all the surplus currency
iu me xrennury in me iiure;uMgu ui uui-
eminent bonds, thus reducing the intorest-
beuring debt of the country, aud of sub
mittiim to Congress the question of the
disposition to be made of the bonds
purchased. The bonds now held by the
Treasury amouut to about $75,000,000
including thone belonging to the sinking
fund. I recommend that the whole be
placed to the credit of the sinking fund.
Your attention is resuectlully invited to the
rocomincndntions ot tho Secretary of the
Treasury for the creation of the oflbo
Counuishionor of Customs aud Kevenue,
for the increase ot salary to certain of
ficials, and the (substitution of increased
National Bank circulation, to replace the
outstanding 3 per cent, certificates, and
most especially to his recommendation for
tbe repeal of the laws allowing shares
fines, penalties, forfeitures, Ac., to officers
of the tiovcrument, or to inf-iruiers.
The office of Commissioner . of Internal

ncations of tho class of men required to
it properly. As the United States is the
freest of all nations, so too
people sympathize with all peoples strug.
gling for liberty and solf-government; but
while so sympathizing, it is due to our
honor Hint we nhould abstain from enforc.
inp; our views upon unwilling nations, and
from taking an interested pint, without in
vitation, iu the quarrels between different
nations or between governments arid their
subjects. Our course should always be
conformity with strict justice and law, in
Urnalional nud losnl. Much has boen the
policy of the administration in dealing
with those questions for more than a year,
A valuable province of spam, and a near
neighbor of ours, in whom nil our people
cannot but feel a deep interest, has been
struggling for indepence and freedom. The
people and government of the United States
entertain the same warm faelings
and sympathies for the people of Cuba
thoir pendirg struggle that they manifest
ed throughout the previous struggles be
tween Spain and tne tormer colonies in be
half of tho latter, but the contest at no
time assumed the conditions which
amount to a war in the sense of internation
al law, or which would show the existence
of a de facto political organization of the
insurgents suihoiont to jiiBtity a recogni'
tion of belligerency. The principle
maintained that this nat on
its own judge when to accord tho right
belligerency, either to a people struggling
to free themselves from a government they
believe to be oppressive, or to independent
nations at war with each other. The Unit
ed States have no disposition to interfere
with the existing re I aliens of Spain to her
colonial posses ions oa this continent,
They believe that in due time Spain and
other European powers will find it to their
Interest to terminate tliose rotations and es
tablish their present dependendencies
independent powers, members of the
family of nations. Those dependencies are
no longer regarded as subject to transfer
from one Euronenn cower to ansther. When
the present relatione of the colonics cease
they are to become indepen tent powers, ex
ercising the right of choice and of self-
control in the determination of their future
condition and relations with other powers.
The United States, in order to put astop
bloodshed iu Cuba and in tho interest
of a neighboring people, proposed
their good offices to bring the existing
content to a termination. ' The offer not
being accepted by Spain, on a basis which
o belcived conld bo received by Cuba, was
withdrawn. It is hoped that the good of
fices of the United Slutes may yet prove
advantageous for the settlement of this
nnhappy strife. Meanwhile a number
illegal expedition! against Cuba have been
broken up. . It has been the endeavor
the Administration to execute the neutral
ity laws in good fiiith, no- matter how un
pleasant the task, made bo by the suffering
we nave endured trom luck or like good
faith towards us by other na
tions. The UniUd Slates . schoon
er Lizzie Major was. arrested
on the high seas by a Spauish frigate and
two passengms taken from it and canned
as prisoners to Cuba. Representations of
these tnctH were lmuie to the Spanish Gov
ernment, as soon m official information
of them pwihed Washington. The two pas
sengers were sot at liberty, and the Spanish
Government assured the United Statts that
the captain of the frigate in making the
cuplnro bad acti-dwitho t law; that be had
been reprimanded for the irregularity ot
his conduct, and that tile fSnnnith authori
ties in cntin, would not (auction any act

ine question of tbe seizure of the brig
Mary LowulLat one ol the Bahama Islands
by the Spanish aathoiitiosi, is now the
subject of correspondence between : this
Government mid those of Spain and Great
Britain. The Captain-General of Cuba.
about May last, issued a proclamation au-
tuonzuig fcoarcij to be made of vessels on

The subjeot of an intor-ooeanio canal to
oonnoot the Atlantlo and Pacillo oceauB
through tha Isthmus ot Daricn is one ia
which commerce is greatly interested. . In
structions have been given to our Minister
to tho Itepublio of the Unitod Statos of
Colombia to endeavor to obtain authority
for a survey by this government in order to
determine tbe practicability ot such an un
dertaking, and a eharter for tho right of
way to build by private enterprise suoh a
work, if tha survey proves it to be prntio
able. In order to oomply with the agreement
of the United States as to a mixed com
mission at Lima for the adjustment of
claims, it became necessary to send a com
missioner and secretary to Lima iu August
last. No appropriation having been made
by Congress for this purpose, it is now
aisked that one be made covering the past
and future expenses of the oommission.
The good ofBoes of the United States to
bring about a peace between Spain and the
South American republics, with which she
is at war, having beeu acoepted by Spain,
Feru and Chili, a congress has beeu invi
ted to be held in Washington during tho
present winter.
A grant has been given to Europeans of
an exolusive right of transit ove:

which Costa Rica has given its assent,
which it is alleged conflicts with vested
rights of citizens of the Uuited States.
The depr.rtment of state has now this sub
jeot under consideration. The minister of
Peru having maJa representations that
there was a (state of war batweeu Peru and
Spain, and that Spain was constructing in
aud near New York thirty gunboats, which
might be used by Spain in suoua way ns to
relieve the naval force at Cuba, so as to op
erate against Peru, orders were given to
prevent their doparture. Wo runner steps
having been taken by the representative ol
the Peruvian government to prevent the
departure of these vessels, and I not feeling
authorized to detain the properly of a
nation with which we are at peace on a
more Executive order, the matter has been
referred to the courts to decide.
The conduot of the war between the
allies and the republio of Paraguay has
made tne intercourse with that country so
difficult that it has been advisable to with
draw our representative from there.
Towards the close of the instaiiministra-
tion a convention was signed at Loudon for
the settlement of all outstanding claims be
tween Great Britain and the United States,
which failed to receive the advice and con
sent of the Senate to its ratification. The
time and the circumstances attending
the negotiation of the treaty were
favorable to its acceptance by the
people of the United States, and its pro
visions were wholly inadequate for the set
tlement of the grave wrongs that had boen
sustained by this government, as well as by
its citizens The injuries resulting to the
United States by reason of tho course
adonUd by Great Britain during our late
civil war, in increased rates of insurance, in
the diminution of exports and imports, and
other obstructions to domestic industry
and production, in its effoct upou the for
eign commerce of tho conntry, iu the do
crease end transfer to Great BiiUtia of our
commercial mariue, in the prolongation of
the wax and increased cost both iu treasure
treasure, and in lives, of its suppression,
could not be adjusted and sntistled as ordi
nary commercial claims, which continually
arise between commercial "notions, and yet
the convention treated them simply as such
ordinary cluims, from which they differ
more widely iu the gravity of their charac
ter than in the' magnitude of their amount.
Grent,even,as is that difference, not a word
was tound in the treaty, and not an inter
ence could be drrwu lroin it, to remove the
sense of the unfriendliness of the courso of
Great Britain in our struggle for existence,
which had .universally impressed itself
upon the people of this country. Believing
that the convention thus misconceived in
its scope and made quite liberal in its pro
visions) would not have produced the hear
ty ud cordial settlement of pending ques
tions which alone is consistent with the
relations which I desire to have establish
ed between the United States and Great
Britain, I regarded the notion of the Sen
ate in the rejection of the treaty to have
been wisely taken in the interest of peace,
and a necessary stop in tho direction
of a perfect aud cordial friendship between
the two countries. A sensitive people, con
scious of their power, are more ut ease un
der a great wrong wholly unatoned than
under restraint of a settlement which satis
fies neither their ideas of justice nor their
grave sense of the grievance they have
sustained. The rejeotion oi Ihe treoty was
followed by a state of public feeling on
both sides, which I thought not
favorable to an immediate at
tempt at renewed negotiation.
I accordingly so instructed the Minister of
tho United States to Great Britain,, and
found that my views in this regard were
shared by Ilur Majesty's ministers. I hope
that the time may soon arrive when the
two governments can approach the solu
tion of this momentous question with an
assurance of what is due to the rights, dig
nity and honor of each, and with the de
termination not only to remove the causes
of complaint in the past, but to lay tbe
foundation of a broad principle of public
law which will prevent future ditforencts,
and tend to a firm and
continued peace and friendship.
This is now the only grave question which
tbe United States have with any foreign na
tion. The question of a treaty for reciprocity
between the United States and the British
provinces on this continent has not been
favorably considered by the administration.
The advantage of such a treaty would be
wholly in favor of the British producer, ex
cept possibly a few engaged in the trade
between the two sections. No citizen of
the United States would be benefitted by
reciprocity. Our internal taxation would
prove a protection to the British produce,
almost eqi il to . the protection which our
manufacturers now receive from the tariff.
Some arrangement, however, for the regu
lation of commercial intercourse butweon
the United States and the Dominion of
Canada may be dosi ruble.
The 00m mission for adjusting the claims
for the Hudson Bay and Fnget's Hound

there Las been no modifications made in
tbe oonipuny'i concession, nor, so far as I

well as tho dignity and sovereignty of the
nation, against such assumption. I shall
also endeavor to secure, by negotiation, an
abandonment of the principle of monopo

of this correspondence are herewith fur

of other countries, less formnute
than cur own, sometimes induces
their citizens to come to the United States

change of allegiance is made known; that
they reside permanently from the United
States; that they contribute nothing to its
resources; that they avoid duties of its cit
izenship, and they only make themselves

On the accession of the present adminis
tration it was found that the Minister for
North Germany had made propositions for
negotiations for a convention for the pro
tection of emigrant- passengers, to which
no response had been given. It was con
cluded that to be effectual, all the mari
time powers engaged in the trade should
joiu in such a measure. Invitations have
been extended to the cabinets of London,
Paris, Florenoo, IJerlin, Brus

and Stockholm to order their representa
tives at Washington to simultnneouBly en

largely due to the industry and efforts of
one of our own distingushed citizens, and
the world is about to commence largely in
creased relations with that populous aud
hitherto exclusive nation, As the United
States have been the initiators in the now
policy, so they should be the most earnest
in showing their good faith in making it a
success. Ia this connection I advise such
legislation aswill forever preclude the land
ing of Chinese upon our soil under the
name of Coolios, and also prevent Amer
ican vessels from engaging in transporta
tion of Coolies to any country tolerating
the system. I also recommend that the
mission to China be rimed to one of first
class1. On my assuming the reiponsibility of
Chief Magistrate ol (he United States it
was with the conviction that threo things
wero essential to peace, prosperity, and
fullest development. First among these
is strict integrity iu fulfilling all our obli
gations. Second, to secure protection to
the person and property of the oltizens of
our common country wnerever tie may
ohoose to move without referenoa to origi
nal nationality, religion, oolor, or politics,
demanding of him only obedionce to the
laws and proper respect for the rights ol
Others. Thirdf, Union cf all cf the States
with eqmd rights indtstructubls by any
unconstitutional means to scoure.
First ' of these Congress has
taken two essential steps ons by declaring
that the public debt should be paid, prin
cipal and interest, in coin; second, by pro
viding means for paying; providing tho
means, however, could not secure the ob
ject desired with a proper administration of
tbe laws for the collection or revenues and
an economical disbursement ol thorn. To
this subject the administration has most
earnestly addressed itself, with results, I
believe, satisfactory to the country. There
has been no hesitation in changing officials
in order to neon re efllcit-nt execution of the
laws sometimes, too, wherein a more party,
view an Indescribable political remit were
likely to follow for any hesitation in sus
taining ffllcient officials nfralnst remon
strances wholly political. It may bs well
to mention here the enubarrascmont possi
ble fo arise from allowing on the statute
books the so-called tonnro of office act,niid
to earnestly recommend their total repeal.
It could not have been the intention of the
framers of' the constitution,.: When
providing . ' that appointments made
ny ' tho ' President should ' rec6lve tha
consent of .the Senate, .that tba latter
should have the powor to r tain ' in office
.persons placed there by fednral appoint
inents against the will cf the President.
The law is inconsistent' with the faithful
and efficient administration of tbe govern
ment. What faith can an executive put in
officials forced npon him, and those, too,,
whom ho has suspended for good reason 7
Bow will each oflltfald be likuly to serve;
an administration wbioh they know does
trust them for a second? ,Jt Is requis
ite to our grpwth and , prosperity. 1 , Time,
and a firm but humane administration of
existing lawi, emended from time to time,
as they may prove ineffectual and nnneceg
wiry, is probably all that are rsqulr-"
ed. The third cannot be attain
ed bv spocial legislation, but
by .tha rmn.
stitutton i soil, nnd gradually aoquiesoea in
by force of publto opinion. From the
foundation or tne government to me pres
ent the managenaeut of the original inhab
itants of this continent, the Indians, fcar
been a subjeot of embarrassment and ex
pense, and hnB been attenaed witn con
tinuous .robberies, murders and wars.
From ' iny -own experience upon
the frontiers and ia the Indian countries,
I do not hold either legislation or the oon
duct of the whites who oome most in con
tact with the Iudians blameless for these
hostilities. The past, however, cannot be
undono, nnd the question must be met as
we now find it. I have attempted a new
policy toward these wards of tho nation,
aud thoy oannot bo regarded in any other
light than as wards, with fair results so far
as tried, and which I hope will be attended
ultimately with great Biiccess. TheBooiotv
of Friends is well known as having succeed
ed ia living at peace with tho Indians in
the early settloraont of Pennsylvania while
their whito noighbors of oth.r sects in
other sections were constantly embroilod.
They tiro also known for thoir opposition
to all strife, violonoe and war, ana are gen
erally noted for their strict integrity aud
fair dealings. These considerations in
duced me to give the management of a few
reservations of Iudians to them, and to
throw the burden of the selection of agents
upon the Society itaolf. Tho result has
provon most satisfactory. It will bo found
more fully not forth in the report of the
Commissioner of ludian Affairs. For su
perintendents and Indian agents, not on
reservations, ofllcers of the army were
eleoted. Tho reasons for this are
numerous. When Indian argents are
sent there, or near there, troops
must be sent also. Tho agent nnd the
commanders of troops are independent of
each other, andure subject to orders from
difl'orent departments of the governmont.
Tho army oiticor holds a position for life,
the agent one at the will of the President.
The former is personally interested in liv
ing iu harmony with the Indians, and in
tho establishment of a permanent peace, to
the end that some portion of bis Jif'e my
be spent within tho civilized section. Tho
latter has no such personal interest. Aud
theie is an economic one, and still another
hoi I which the government has upon a life
officer, to secure a faithful dischargo of du
ties iu carrying out a giveu policy. The
building of roilroads, aud tho access there,
by given to nil agricultural and mineral
regions of their country, is rapidly bringing
the civilized settlements into contact with
all the triors of Indians. No matter what
ought to be the relations between such
settlements and aborigines, the
fact is they do not harmonize
well, and one or the other has to give way.
A system which looks to the extermination
of a race is too horrible for a nation to adopt
without entailing upon itself the wrath of
all Christendom nud engendering iu the
citizen a disregard for human life and tho
rights of others and dangerous to society.
I isee no substitute for such a system, ex
cept iu placing all tho Iudians on large res
ervations as rapidly as can be dono and
giving them absolute protection there. As
hooii as they are fitted for it they should be
iuduced to take their lauds iu severally or to
set up territorially for their own protec
tion. For full details on this subject I
call your special attention to the reports
of tho Secretary of tho Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Tho re
port of Ihe Sccretury of Wur shows tho
expenditures of the War Department for
tho year ending the 30th of June, 1800, to
be $80, Gil, (MS, of which $23,882,310 was
disbursed iu the payment of debts con
tracted during tho war, and is not charge
able to current army expensts. The c.tti
niato of $31,531,031 for the expouses of
tho army lor tho next fiscal year is
low as it is believed . can
bo 'relied on, Tho estimotes of bureau
officers have been carefully scrutinized
wherever it has been deemod practicable.
If, however, the condition of the eountry
should be such by the next fiscal year as to
admit of a greater contration of troops,
tho appropriation asked for will not be ex
peuded. The appropriation estimated for
river and harbor improvements and fortifi
cations nru submitted soperately. What
ever amount Congress may deem proper to
appropriate for these purposes, will be ex
pended. The recommendation of the Gener
ul of tbe Amy that appropriations be made
for the forts at Boston, Portland, New
York, Fhiladelshia, New Orleans and San
Francisco, if for no other, is concurred iu.
I also call special attention to the recom
mendation of the General commanding
the imlitarv division of the PaciUo for the
salo of the Seal Islands of St Paul and St.
Goorgo, Alaska Territory, and suggest that
it either bo complied with, or that
legislation be had for the protec
tion of the seal nsuerioB, trom
which a revenue should bo derived.
Tho ronort of tho Secretory of War oon
tains a synopsis of the heads of bureaus, of
commaudeirs of military divisions aud of
the districts of Virginia, Mississippi and
Texas. The report of the General cf the
Army in lull, aud tho recommendations
therein contained, have been well consid
ered and are submitted for your action. I,
however, call special attoution to the re
commendation of the Chief of Ordnance for
the sale of arsenals and lauds no longer of
use to the Government; also to the recom
mendation of tho Secretary ol War that tho
act of 3d of March, 1800, prohibiting pro
motions and oppintmenis in stuff corps of
tbe army, bo reoealud. Ths extent of

Secreloiy of thu Navy acooinpauying
this shows tho condition of the
navy when this administration canio
Into otllce, and enanges made since

as many vessels in commission or render
them fit for service, if rcqnired, as soon as
possible, and substituting the pail for
steam whilo cruising, thus materially re
ducing tho expenses of the navy and ad
ding greatly to its efficiency. Looking to
our future, I recommend a liberal, though
not extravagant, policy towards this branch
of publio service ...
The report of the postmaster general fur
nishes a clear and . comprehensive
exhibit of . the operations of the
postal service and of, the financial
condition of this part of 'the Post-ofllce
Department. The ordinary postal reve
nues lor the year ending the 30th of June,
18(19, amount to $18,4-15,510, and the ex
penditures to $23,680,131, showing nn ex
c!hs of expenditures ovor recoipta of $5,
35 J, 020. Tho excess ot expenditures over
the receipts for the previous year amounted
to $0,4:17,9!2. The increase of revenues
for 1HU9 over those of 18C8 was $2,051,1)09,
and tho increase of expenditures was, t'JG7,
$907,538. The increased revenue
in 1809 exceeded the increased revouue
in 18C8 by 890(5,330, and tho in
creased expenditures iu 18C9 was
wits $'4,27,C70 loss than the increased ex
penditures in 1807, showing, by oompprl
aou, this gratifying '. feature . of , improve

was $2439,530, the increase of receipts

Th report of the Seoretary of the Inte
rioi haws tba ik qaatityfHpWw
lands'tiriqiosed'oT tlurlhg"" thTear' e ndlfig"
30th of June, 1869, was 7,6(50,152 aores, ex
ceeding that of the previous year by 1,
010,409 acres. Of this amount 2,890,644
acres were sold foi cash, and 2,737,3(13
sores entered under- tbe homestead laws.
The remainder was granted to aid in the
construction of the work of internal im
provements, approved to the states as
stamp lands, and located warrants and
scrip. Tne casn reoeipts irom an sources
were $4,472,885, exceeding those ot the
previous year $2,840,140. s
uunag tne last usoai year sj,j.uo names
were added to the pension rolls, and 4,870
dropped therefrom, leaving at its close
187,953. The amount paid to pensioners,
including the compensation to disbursing
agents, was $28,422,884, an inorease
of $441,192 on that of the previous year.
The munifloence of Congress has been con
spicuously manifested in its legislation for
the soldiers and sailors who suffered in the
reoent struggle to maintain that unity of
government whioh makes us oner people.
The additions to tho pension rolls of each
succeeding year sinoo the conclusion of
hostilities result in a groat degree from the
repeated amendments of the uot of
the 14th of July, 1802, whioh would
extend Its provisions to cases not
fulling within its original soope.
Tho large outlay whioh is thus occasioned
is fuither Increased by the more liberal nl
lowancA bestowed since that date upon
those who, in the line of duty, were wholly
or permanently disabled. Publio opinion
has given au empnatio sancuon to mess
measures of Congress, and it will be oon
coded that no part of our publio burden ia
more cheerfully borne than that which is
imposed by this branch of the service. It
necessitates for the next fiscal year,
in addition to the amount just chargeable to
the naval pension fund, an appropriation
of thirty million dollars.
During the year ending the 30th of Sep
tember, 1869, the Patent Ollice issued 13,
7C2 patents, and its receipts were $633,289,
being $213,920 more than the expenditures.
I would respectfully call your attention
to the reoommendation of the Seoretary of
the Interior for uniting the duties of super
vising the education of the freeduien with
the other duties devolving upon tne uotn-
missioner of Eduoation. If it is the desire
of Congress to make the census which
must be taken during tho year 1B7U more
oeimpleile and perfeot than heretofore, I
would suggest early action upon any plan
that may be agreed upon. As Congress at
the last session appointed a committee to
take into consideration such measures as
might bo deemed proper in reference to
the coming census, and to report a plan, I
desist from saying more.
1 recommend to your lavorauie consider
ation the claims of the Agricultural
Bureau for liberal appropriation in a
country so diversified in climate and soil as
ours, and with a population so lurgely de
pendent upon agriculture, the benefits that
can be conferred by properly fostering this
bureau, are incalculable.
I desire, respectfully, to call the attention
of Congress to ths inadequate salaries of a
number of the most important ofllcers of
the government. In this message I will
not enumerate them, but will specify only
the Justices of the Supreme Uourt Mo
change has been made iu their salaries for
10 years. Witbln tuat time the
labors of the Court have largoly iucrcused,
and tbe expenses of living have at least
doubled. During the same time Congress
has twioo found it neeossary to increase
largoly the compensation of its own mem
bers, and tho duty which it owes to another
department of the government deserves,
aud will undoubtedly receive, its duo con
sideration. Th6reare many subjects not alluded to in
this message which might with propriety
be introduced, but I abstain, believing
your patriotism and statesmanship will
suggest the topics and legislation most
conducive to the interests of the whole
people. On my part, I promise a rigid
