President ltoosovelt's llrst message to

public questions. It Is an exceptionally
long message, but this is Justified by
tho clear and thorough traitjnent of tho
matters considered, and no citizen who
Is interested In these matters will llnd
perusal of tho niessagu laborious or
tedious, tho president's llteinry method
being such as to hold the attention and
maintain the Interest of tho reader.
President IloosVvolt's tribute to his la
mented predecessor Is entirely adnilr-
hie and Ids denunciation of anarchism
nd anarchists will have tho hearty ap
proval of all persons who have respect
for law and government. Tho presi
dent declares that anarchy Is no more
n expression of "social discontent" than
picking pockets or wife-beating., no
haracterlzcs tho anarchist, particularly
In this country, as ono typo of criminal,
more dangerous than any other because
ho represents tho same depravity In a
greater degree. lie thinks anarchists
should not bo allowed at largo and re
gards their speeches, writings and meet
ings as ossontlaMy seditious anil treason-
bio. IIo would havo anarchists kept
out of tho country and If found hero de
ported to tho country from which they
ame. I'or Ihosu who stay, that Is, an-
rohlsls born here, tho president urges
far-reaching provision for their punish
ment.
In regard to dealing with tho great
corporations tho president counsels cau
tion. He holds that they aro not due to
tho tn rill' nor to any other governmental
action, but to natural causes' In tho busi
ness world. IIo says It cannot bo too
fleit pointed out that to .strike with
Ignorant violence at tho Interests of one
set of men almost Inevitably endangers
the Interests of all. "Tho mechanism of
modern business Is so delicate that ex
treme care must tie taken not to Interfere
with It in a spirit of rashness w Igno-
anee." The president'! view Is that tho
Industrial combinations should bo super-
Ised ami within reasonable limits con
trolled, but not prohibited. lie urges
publicity as the llrst essential In de
termining how to deal with tho combi
nations. Tho government should havo
the right to Inspect and examine
the great corporations engaged In
Interstate business. "Publicity," he says,
Is tho only sure remedy which
wo can now invoke. wit iur
ther remedies are needed in tho way of
governmental regulation, or taxation,
can only bo determined after publicity
has been obtained, by process of law
ml In tho course of administration. The
llrst reijuislte Is knowledge which may
be made public to tho world."
The president Is not in favor of tariff
evlslon. He. says there Is general ac
quiescence In the existing economic pol
icy and Its continuity ami stability Is
tlio llrst requisite to our prosperity.
'Nothing could bo more unwise than to
disturb the business interests of the
lountry by any general tariff change at
lids lime. Doubt, apprehension, oncer
talnty aro exactly what wo most wish
to avoid In tho Interest of our cominer
(Jial and material well-being." In regard
to reciprocity tho president says It must
bo Heated as the handmaiden of protec
tion, that "our llrst duty Is to see that the
protection granted by tlio tarilr lu every
use where It Is needed Is maintained
mil that reciprocity Im sought for so
far as It can safely bo done without In
jury to our homo industries." Ho says
that reciprocity must command our
hearty support, "subject to tho proper
protection necessary to our Industrial
well-being." lu the opinion of the presl
dent "the natural lino of development
for a policy of reciprocity will be lu
connection with those, of our productions
which no longer repulro all the support
once needed to establish them upon a
sound basis, and with those others
where either because of natural or of
economic causes wo are beyond the
reach of successful competition."
President Roosevelt makes a strong
argument for an American merchant
marine, pointing out tlio advantages to.
bo obtained lu foreign trade by having
our own ships. Ho de'clares that it Is
unwise from every standpoint for this
country to continue to rely upon the
ships of competing nations for the dls
trlbutlon of our goods. It Is to be In
fcrred that tho president would approve
tho ship subsidy bill If passed by con
gross. The president shows an earnest
Interest in tho matter of reclamation of
tho arid lauds, saying that It would on
rich every portion of the country. He
urges that the policy of the national
government should be to aid irrigation
in tho several states and territories lu
such manner as will enable tho people in
tlio local communities to help them
selves and as well stimulate needed re
forms lu tho stato laws and regulations
governing Irrigation,
In regard to the Important question of
commercial relations with Cuba, Presl
dent Roosevelt recommends a substan
tial reduction lu the tariff duties on Im
ports from that Island. He says that
Cuba should stand, In International mat
tors, lu closer and more friendly relations
with us than with any other power,
"and we are bound by every consldera
tlon of honor and expediency to pass
commercial measures in the Interest o
her material well-being." Undoubtedly
tho position of the administration ou
this question will have a decided lutlu
enco upon congress and It Is safe, to say
that tariff concessions will bo made to
Cuba, though doubtless not to tho ex
tent the Cubitus desire. Tho message
gives extended consideration to the Phil
Ipplnes and suggests that perhaps tho
work of establishing local self-govern
ment thoro has been pushed too rapidly
It is urged that there should be add!
tloual legislation for tho Islands, partle
ularly with reference to the Introduction
of Industrial enterprises.
The construction of tin isthmian canal
Is urged as of the very highest Impor
tauce to tlio Americau people and the
president says of tho now treaty with
Great Ilrltalu that It guarantees to this
nation every right that It has ever asko
In connection with the canal. The presl
dent evidently expects that the treaty
will be promptly ratllled. The message
gives renewed assurauco to the countries
south of us of the cordial fricudshli
THE OMAHA DAILY
of the United States ami says that the
Monroe doctrine should be the cardinal
feature of the foreign policy of all tlio
nations of the two Americas. Tlio work
of upbuilding the navy, the president
says, must be. steadily continued, while
as to the arrti'y lie say's it Ts now large
nough lind it is only necessary to keep
It tit the highest point of ellicicncy. He
recommends tho creation of a general
staff.
The president suggests changes in tho
Immigration law and It Is not liuprob-
ble that Ills suggestions will be acted
upon. He is In favor of it reduction lu
evenue, approving lu tills mutter the
ccomniondatlons of tho secretary of
the treasury. The re-enactment of the
Chinese exclusion law Is urged, with the
ecommeiidatlou that It be made
stronger. In this connection the presl-
lent makes an earnest plea for the pro
tection of American labor. The message
ounsols congress against extravagance
lu expenditures, but it Is to lie appre
hended that this very proper advice will
not be 'iceded.
President Roosevelt has given the
oiiutry a careful and thoughtful con-
(deration of public questions which
every citizen will find It profitable to
read.
TUB STATU TllKASVUEll'S KXIUItlT.
Stato Treasurer Stucfcr has submitted
his seml-auuual report of the receipts
and disbursements of his office, with a
speclllt! exhibit of the funds deposited in
tlit various banks and the cash on hand
lu the treasury vault. Tills report is
certllled as correct by tho governor, sot-
clary of slate and attorney general, as
members of tho Hoard of Kducatloiial
Lands ami Funds, Mr. StueCer In-
hides in his report this declaration:
I desire to state thcra U nothing covered
up or hidden in this olucc and that I am.
perfectly willing to submit every transac
tion to the most thorough examination and
the most searching scrutiny by the proper
authority.
The Ree has no disposition to question
tlio correctness of Mr. Stuefer's book
keeping nor to cast any rcllectlous upon
tlio officers who havo certllled to It.
Wlillo tills exhibit for tlio llrst time coin
piles with (lie demand of the republican
tale convention, it will not be accepted
by Intelligent people as a satisfactory
explanation of Mr. Stuefer's methods of
Investing the school funds and their
speculative use for private gain.
The mere fact that on tho llrst day of
December, 11)01, the treasurer is able to
show that only a fraction over $1S.OOO
remained In tlio vault of thu state treas
ury will fool nobody Into the belief that
tho school moneys previously reported
as "lialauce on Wind had not been de
posited at Interest lu banks, Tho
fact that .S(),(N)U in bank checks signed
by Mr. Stucfcr as treasurer were used
by a middleman lu the purchase of the
Hurt county bonds, of which $70,000 was
in a hank that hud not been a designated
depository, Is proof conclusive that the
school funds have not been kept lu the
vaults of the treasury. Nobody con
tends that this money should be con
stantly in the treasury vault, but It
would havo been more creditable for tho
treasurer to havo made a clean breast of
It mouths ago than to havo pretended
that lie could not legally do what he
and every other stato treasurer had been
doing all tho time.
Mr. Stuefer tells us now that there Is
nothing covered or hidden lu his office
and oilers to submit every transaction
to the most searching examination of tlio
proper authority. This does not meet
all the points at" Issue. Up to tho dis
closures of tho county bond deals the.
demand was simply for Information con
cerning tho amounts ami places of de
posit of the public money In his custody.
Since then the demand Includes the
speculative mlnipulatlou of bond pur
chases with school money. The records
In the bond deals Indicate that the
school fund has been milked for sev
eral thousand dollars and the only offi
cer who seems to be directly Implicated
Is the treasurer, who so far has failed
to give an explanation that would rein
state him in public conlldeucc.
Tho suggestion that the vacant
grounds at St. Mary's avenue and Har
ney street bo set apart for a market
house has stirred up a hornet's nest
among the members ot tho woman s
club, who look upon tho erection of a
market house in tho neighborhood of tho
public library building as a nuisance.
In order to throw oil on troubled waters
Mayor Moores addressed a letter to one
of tho leaders, lu which ho volunteered
the assurance that It was but a remote
possibility that wo "Would havo a market
house anywhere, and in any event there
was little probability of Its being lo
cated at Nineteenth and Harney. This
epistle from tho city hall evoked excla
mations of surprise and distress and It
was broadly hinted that someone had
taken an unwarranted liberty In pre
suming to address the mayor on the sub
ject. The next time Mayor Moores un
dertakes to address a communication to
a member of the Woman's club ho had
better apply to tho club for n permit.
Over $18,000 In gold coin and sound
currency Is stored within tho vault of
the state treasury, but It Is doubtful
whether any enterprising burglar fa
miliar with tho handling of state funds
undor the present regime would take
the troublo to undermine the vault or
blow oft Its doors lu the hope of secur
ing anything for his labor. The chances
aro a thousand to one that tho deposit,
minus a few dimes and nickels,, has
been spirited away between two days
and is now reposing lu the coffers of
one of the local batiks.
The habit of straining at gnats and
swallowing camels seems to havo be

cullarlty was presented recently, when
the board held two meetings lu one night

It Is again announced that the ileal for
tho sale of the Danish West Indies to
tho 'United Stales has been consum
mated, The llrst thing the government
should do on gaining possession should
be to appropriately mark with buoys the
location of the numerous: heavy naval
engagements reported from the Wind
ward passage during the late war.
It will be months and perhaps years
before the proposed plan of municipal
consolidation will be In shape to ma
terialize, and those who earnestly de
sire to bring nbout a reduction of local
taxation will have to concentrate their
Inllucnce upon a more economical ad

The toast to King Kdword of Great Brit
ain, which was proposed and drunk at the
annual banquet of the New York Chamber
of Commerce tho other evening, was a
pleasant courtesy to a great nation over
the sea. "Hero's to your health and pros
pcrlty," tho little convivial ceremony said
to tho Drltlsh people The Idea was excel
lent. But why should the other great na'
Hons havo been Ignored? Unless our con
ceptlon of the toast be wide of tho mark,
there was equal reason for proposing tue
health of the president of France, the czar
of Russia nnd the' emperor of Germany.
It was r banquet which was graced by th
American secretary of state, and nil the
more on that account was It desirable not
to draw distinctions botwecn nations. Tho
secretary's speech was notable for Its
friendliness to foreign countries, without
setting up preferences for any particular
one. Tho questionable taste of drinking the
health of but one foreign ruler, under such
conditions, must he obvious to all.
There Is certainly no country with whom
it Is more desirable to cultivate friendly
relations than with Germany, and there Is
no other country to which the Now York
Chamber of Coramorce could with greater
propriety have paid the compliment of a
toast. For the Gcrmau commerce of the
nort of New York Is an enormous factor
of Its wealth and Importance, while that
nortlon of tho population of New York
which Is German or of German descent ex
erclses a very great Influence In the city's
politics and financial life. From Carl
Schurz to Mr. Guggenhelmer, tho German
factor In Now York plays a conspicuous
part. France, too, Is a country with which
America has every reason, to cultivate
friendly relations. After all, the French
are the great hope of republicanism In
Kurope, while their commerco with the
port of New York Is no Inconsiderable
asset of New York's prosperity. And Russia
may well be the. recipient of an American's
courtesies. The nation of the eiar, in re
tiring from Alaska, voluntarily did America
the service of renouncing Its position as a
power ot the western hemisphere. The
future of northern Asia, however, will be
to a large degree the future of Russia, and
two great Taclfic powers, one of which
controls San Francisco and the other Port
Arthur, ought to deserve the amenities o
international Intercourse. Other powers
too Italy, Japan, even Spain might well
bo the recipients of American good wishes
Yet to the rulers of none of these did the
New York Chamber of Commerce drink
. toait.

The contest for the control of the rail-
roads In tho northwest lids ended la tho
formation of a stock-owning corporation
with a capital stock of $100,000,000. It Is a
banking concern, something llko the llrook
lyn Rapid Transit company. Tbo directors
of tho new corporation, to be called the
Northern Securities company, will glvo Its
stock In cxcliatiRc for tho stock of the vari
ous railroads entering Into tho combination,
and its directors, through its control, will
control tho railroads. This plan lias been
adopted to get around tho anti-trust laws.
Iluslness will bo done In Its own way and In
big corporations or llttlo ones It Is prac
tically Impossible, to frame ft stntute which
will Interfere with this law of trade.
Hut It Is possible to frame n statute
which will prevent the granting of any
franchise or charter to any corporation con
talnlng such a provision as appears In tho
charter of this new company. According to
tho Associated Press summary of that docu
ment, It gives to the directors power to
'determine from time to time, where, when
and how the books of the company shall bo
open to tho stockholders." This really puts
thd control of the railroads Involved In tho
hands of tho directors nml there need not bo
moro than three of them. No stockholder
may know nnythlng about tho conduct ot the
business savo as thoso men are willing to
et him. Whllo there Is a growing demand
for publicity, wo havo hero tho formation
of a corporation whose managers aro seek-
ng privacy. They not only propose to keop
Information from tho public, but can keep
It from thoso who havo a right to know

every Individual who haH "dono" the gov

cough up in like manner all taxes could

It should not be forgotten that the honor
of bringing the franchise)! corporations of
Chicago to their knees belongs to two
sturdy school ma'ams. Miss Catherine Gog.
gin and Miss Margaret Haley. These two
were in tho forefront, of tho fight to force
tho corporations to pay their shnre ot pub
lic toxes and the victory scored Is a splen-
lld tribute to tho "1 will" qualities of
Chicago women.
Tho Miller syndicate swindle of llrook

week, Is clearly outclassed by tho opera

brokers. Thoy offered 105 per cent per an-
uum, gathered la $4,700,000 and went the
way of tho wrecked, leaving about $200,000
for lawyers and receivers to fight over.

Tho announcement Is made ou the au
thority of Senator Millard that Mr. William
Jennings Uryan will receive tho offer ot the
democratic nomination for governor of No
haska next year and that he will accept.
To this stntcment tho senator adds his con
viction that Uryan would bo defeated, say
ing! "The attempt to rcvlvo tho old-line
democratic party la Nebraska has failed
and the democratic organization wilt be tho
Uryan organization. Uryan will depend
upon his pcrsonnl popularity to land him lu
tho governor's chair, but I believe ho can
not win."
That Ilrynn should bo willing to run for
governor of Nebraska will not surprise
thoso who have studied his political career
or who have reached a full appreciation of
his Inordinate dealre to hold office. His two
disastrous failures In his races for tho
presidency do not seem to havo convinced
him that ho cau never sit In tho White
House and It Is undoubtedly his idea that by
keeping himself beforo the people of Ne
braska ns n political leader ho can keep
himself beforo tho wholo country In tho
snnio capacity. Though many ot his old
tlmo associates and backers have deserted
htm, yet ho still hns n certain hold on
'strong elements In bis party. Though tho
national democracy would llko to rid Itself
of Uryan and Uryanlsm, It has not yet
been bold enough to come out boldly, con
fess Us errors and utterly rcpudlato him
nnd his doctrines. Unless there Is a vory
'decided chango before 1004 It will still
have Uryan to count with when It comes to
making Ha nomination to tho presidency.
The present governor ot Nebraska Is a re
publican, elected last year over a candidate
supported by both democrats and populists.
In tbo election this month tho republicans
carried tho atnto by about 10,000 majority.
When Uryan first shot across tho political
sky llko n brilliant meteor, tn 1S96, he won
lu his own state by about 13,000 votes, but
In 1900 McKlutcy took Nebraska by nearly
8,000 votes. Populism, on which Uryan de
pended so largely for his support, had then
begun to dlo out and it has continued to dlo
ever since. It is generally believed In tho
east that Dryan's Commoner, started for
the perpetuation nnd continued agitation ot
his political theories, has been as bad a
falluro oh his national campaigns. This
gives crcdcnco to tho report that ho would
be willing to tnko tho nomination for gov
ernor. IIo finds himself in tho position f
a man by whom small favors will bo thank
fully received and largo ones In proportion.

LOVE'S CQMPANV.
Clrnco E. Cobb In Boston Transcript.
Tho heart that loves, If absent from Its
ThoUKlin'ull tho world urround, Is yet
alono: ...
Naught wakes tho touch of hlRh and sweet
surprise
Llko love-light shining from beloved eyes.
Say not to lxvo, "Heboid, life's second
best,
Find comfort here, and thus thou thnlt
bo blest," "
With far-off gaze Into th' eternal skies.
"'TIs not mlno own!" his passioned voice
replies.
He. lofty solitude, no lesser gift
Hath power to touch, imperious and gwlft
IIo spurns tho offered substitute, his own
Demands, without It walks alone.
Though round him cluster faces passing
fair.
Kyes starllkc 'nonth a mesh of silken hair.
Iiovo doth behold all charms ot featured
grace
Kpltomlzed In ono beloved face.
With car Indifferent, from ardent lay
Of voices half divine, he turns away,
Hut lightest word of Ills beloved's Booms
Tho waking muslo of his fondest dreams.
Should throngs pass by with looks of cold,
disdain,
tovo heeds them not; nor have they power
to pnlu:
Tho heart beloved Is never moro alone
Onco It hns found and, recognized Its own;
nut separate)! from his chosen friend,
Alono his silent way Lovo needs must
wend;
Only In heaven's elected ono can he
Rest satisfied In perfect company.
