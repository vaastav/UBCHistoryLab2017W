Mr. Chamberlain doesn't care much about the

THE Louisville Commercial cays a new
. bridge is to be built across the Ohio river,
: from JeJTersonville to that city, at an esti
mated cost of $1,250,000. Some Louisville
capitalists have purchased a large amount of
property on that side of the river that 13
oxpected to be benefited by the bridge, and
,a the Indiana side, says the Commercial,
"the syndicate is represented by the Hon.
.Jonas G. Howard, member of Congress from
the Third district, Judge John F. Reed,
Judge Charles P. Ferguson, of the Clark and
Floyd Circuit Court and Mayor Luther F.
"Warder." A syndicate of Eastern capitalists
is backing the enterprise.
An excuse for some of the Chicngo Anarch
ists is that they are ignorant foreigner,
.incapable of appreciating the privileges of
American citizenship. No such apology can
be made for Captain Black. During the trial
he appeared not as a mere attorney, but as a
sympathizer with the murderers and their
cause. His utterances in court were enough
'" to brand him as an unprincipled scoundrel,
bat the crowning infamy of his course in the
affair was his blasphemous and incendiary
speech at the funeral series on Sunday. If
the Chicago press and UWv -abiding people do
not make the city too hct to hold this loud
mouthed snd dangerous persons it will ba be
cause they still hold to the cowardly and false
idea that agitation cf the subject is unwise
and unsafe. The Uay market riot was the
result of a long-continued indulgence in just
such timiiitv.
THE REPUBLICAN OUTLOOK.
The Republican conference to be held in
this cit-, to day, will be an informal opening
of the campaign of 18S8. Though no attempt
will be. made to forestall the official action of
the party in regard to platform or candidates,
the free expression of opinion and exchangee
of views among representative Republicans
from all parts of the State will have a ten-'
dency to crystallize opinion. It will be a
conference of live Republicans, held for the
good of the cause, and to prepare the way for
other movements soon to follow. The issu
ance of the call and the general response from
all parts of the State indicate an earnest and
hopeful feeling among Republicans that is
likely to lead to a very active and aggressive
campaign in this State next year. This
is well.. There cannot be too much
earnestness or aggressiveness infused
into the campaign, provided they do
not take the. form of over-confidence. The
Republicans of Indiana have a right to feel
hopeful, but' not over-confident. They can
carry the State next year, but not easily. It
can and must be done,- but it will only be
after a hard fight "in which all our forces will
have to be brought into action and handled to
the best possible advantacre. In short, it will
not do to underrate the strength or the
advantages of our opponents, or to rely too
implicitly on our own. True, we carried the
State last year, aud so far the situation i3 in
our favor. But Indiana is peculiarly subject
to political changes; the margin on either
side is small, and if. we expect to hold the
State next year we must fight for it. Last
year was a sort of off year for the Democracy.
It was tho first State election since the presi
dential, and they were somewhat handi
capped by circumstances connected with the
national administration. The Republicans
had plenty of splendid campaign material,
most excellent leadership, made an aggress
ive, winning fight from the start, and won a
brilliant victory. There i3 no reason why
they should net do the same next year,
though it may take even a harder fight. The
Democracy, so far as their relations with the
national administration are concerned, are,
possibly, in better political shape now than
they were last year. There has been a larger
distribution of . the spoils, and consequently
there may be less friction and more harmony.
They have the prestige of being "in" and
controlling the national government and
patronage. The appointment of , Don Dickin
son, of Michigan, as Postmaster-general,
means that the tremendous patronage of the
Postoffice Department is to beQised for all
there is in it. So with other departments of
the government. The administration will
not be handicapped next year by any civil
service pretensions, and it will fight to win.
This situation must be faced fairly and
squarely.
On the other hand the Republicans have
the prestige of recent vietory, the frame-work
of a thorough organization, the enthusiasm of
a good cause, and incomparably the best of
the argument aad issues involved. In the
opinion of the Journal the campaign in IndU
ana next year should be made largely on State
issues. National candidates and questions
will, of course, demand a full- share of atten
tion, but it would be a great mistake not to
recognize the paramount importance of issues
which played so prominent a part in the last
campaign, and which current events are still
forcing to the front. The outrageously unfair
apportionment of the State still exists by
which one-fourth of its voters are practically
disfranchised. The prostitution of the State
institutions for partisan purposes, and
the gr)ss mismanagement of the insane
hospital, . still continue. The Governor
himself has virtually admitted that the Harri
son gang ought to go by making a feeble pre
tense of removing them, yet the Harrison
gang still holds on. The overthrow of popu
lar suffrage as expressed in the election of
Lieutenant-governor . Robertson, the bold
usurpation of Green Smith and the revolu
tionary proceedings of last winter have made
a deep impression on the popular mind. These
and other State issues furnish campaign
weapons ready for use and as experience has
proved, very effective. ones. Whatever the
national issues may be, and some of them are
already foreshadowed, State issues so impor
tant as those above indicated will come closer
home to the business and the bosoms of Indi
ana people and they must not be swallowed up
or forgotten. It is presumed the discussions
of tho conference on these and other matters
will tend to unify Republican sentiment, and
bring the party into that perfect accord which
should precede entrance on a great contest.
TREATING THE SURPLUS
There is common consent upon the necessity
and propriety of, reducing the surplus.
But, while this is true,' the talk about
the people clamoring for . relief from
the burdens of taxation is largely bosh.
So far as the national taxes are concerned the
people do not. feel them. Their existence is
not burdensome -and their repeal is not de
manded by the people. That demand comes
from politicians, not. from the people. The
present revenue does not represent burden
some taxation, and -is -not greatly in
excess of the legitimate needs of the govern
ment provided it were legitimately used. An
unused surplus is an evil, but an excess of
revenue is not. On the contrary, if rightly
used it may be made a great blessing. The
statement that government has no right to
collect taxes in excess of its actual necessities
is true, but what are its actual necessities?
To confine these to mere current expenses is
a very narrow viev. Shall the government
raise by taxation only enough to pay the sal
aries of its officials, the cost of our insignifi
cant army and nayj, and the necessary ex
penses of executing the laws and administer
ing the government? We repeat, this is a
very narrow view. There artf many works of
national importance and welfare which should
be provided for, and which, sooner or later,
must be. America is far behind every other
civilized country in its .internal improve
ments. We have absolutely no- coast defenses
whatever. The present chief engineer
of the government fixes $40,000,000 as "the
amount that can be profitably expended on
rivers and harbors," yet the President refused
to sign a bill appropriating $12,213,000.
There is not a well-improved harbor in the
United States. Even at New York large
steamers have to wait for the tide to float them
over, the bar. We have not a line of steam
ers to any foreign port, and even the Ameri
can mails are carried in foreign vessels. Other
governments aid in establishing and main
taining foreign steamer lines and thereby de
velop foreign trade; why should not the
United States? We have merely hinted at
spme directions in which what is called "the
surplus revenue" might be profitably used,
and in which judicious expenditures would
prove of permanent benefit to the country
and tend to promote the general welfare. If
it be said that none of these things pertain to
the functions of government, that it has no
right to engage in public works of a national
character, that is an end of argument on this
point, and raises a question as to what are the
proper functions of government. But if it "be
conceded that such works and improvements
fall within the sphere of government action,
then they suggest a tar better way of dispos
ing of the so-called "excessive revenue" than
a wholesale remission of taxes which the peo
ple do not feel and of which they are not
complaining.
Still another matter is likely to demand at
an early day an increase of expenditure
over the present, and an increase which will
continue for many years. We refer to the
pension system. The time is at hand when
the government will have to make even
more liberal provision for surviving Union
soldiers than it has yet done. Just what the
basis of this provision will be cannot be
stated, but it will be liberal and permanent,
demanding a decided increase of expenditure
in that behalf. When it becomes necessary
to meet that demand "the surplus" will come
in very handy. We hold, therefore, that Con
gress had better think not only twice, but
many times, and very carefully, before it re
mits taxes of which the people are not torn
plaining and throws away a revenue that can
be so usefully employed end that may soon
be sorely needed.
The feature of the present situation that
does demand attention is the disposition of
the existing surplus. It is a surplus simply
because it is unused. Lying idle in the Treas.
ury it is not only withdrawn from active cir
culation but becomes a disturbing factor in
our finances and a power for mischief in our
politics. There is no crisis, but there is an
emergency and it calls for action. The sur
plus should be put in circulation and restored
to the channels of trade as soon as possible.
In the vaults of th'e Treasury it is an evil; in
the hands of the people it ceases to be a sur
plus and becomes a dispenser of benefits. In
a former crisis the Republican party, under
the leadership of John Sherman, led the
country out of the 6lough of a depreciated
currency, where the Democratic rebellion had
placed it, on to the high and solid ground of
specie payments. The key-note then was
"the way to resumption . is to resume." The
present problem can be solved by the same
party and the same tactics. The way to dis
pose of the surplus is to dispose of it. As for
future revenue, it would be folly to reduce
taxes so as to place the government at a disad
vantage. There must be enough revenue not
only to pay the actual expenses of administra
tion, but to produce enough of a surplus that
shall provide for needed works of public de
fense and improvement. The present taxes
can be reduced, but they should not be mean
inglessly cut off; and especially in revising the
schedule of tariff duties, the, principle of pro
tection to American industries should be
carefully preserved against the attacks of Dem
ocratic free-traders, led by President Cleve
land. The inefficient service in the Indianapolis
postoffice is a matter that demands public at
tention. The constant complaints, both of resi
dent citizens and non-residents doing business
here, furnish abundant evidence of a state of
things that calls for reform. From the best
information attainable it is believed this state
of things is mainly due to the department at
Washington. To begin with, the service has
been seriously crippled by removing trained
and experienced clerks and substituting inex
perienced ones who have everything to learn,
and are practicing at the expense of the public
The service thus weakened, both in railway'
and city postoffices, i3 unable to do the work.
Meanwhile, the work is eonstantly increas
ing, and the department refuses to increase
the clerical force. We have reason to believe
the department knows the present force is
inadequate to do the work, and yet refuses to
make any additional allowance for clerk-hire.
This throws the responsibility for the poor
service on the Washington authorities, who
are evidently trying to economize for political
effect, regardless of the good of the service or
the public interests. When partisan politics
affects the efficiency of a service, which all
classes and all interests are concerned in
having maintained at the highest state of
efficiency, it is time for the public to protest.
A Republican administration that should
cripple the service, and neglect the interests
of the Indianapolis postoffice in this manner
would deserve the same criticism, but it
never occurred under any former administra
tion. The Republicans of the State who may
remain over until the late, trains to-night
will be interested in hearing the lecture of
Hon. Thomas H. Nelson, at Y. M. C. A. Hall,
on Mexico. The subject is one that should
enlist the attention of every citizen, and
particularly of those who are specially inter
ested in studying the relations between this
country and our sister republic. Colonel
Nelson is thoroughly at home on the theme,
and his address will be full of information
and profit.

It is thought that the death of Governor Bod
well will make a" great difference in the political
standing of the State of Maine, and while it is
early to say much about differences and changes,
nevertheless new methods are already fore
shadowed. Governor Bodwell was the staunch
friend of Mr. Blaine, and Mr. Blaine practically
secured his nomination. Sebastian S. Marble,
President of the Senate, the successor of Mr.
Bodwell. is understood to he an independent
Republican. While it is thought that he will
not be controllad by Mr. Blaine in the least de
gree, it is not expected that he will openly op
pose his management It is felt that he will
take no orders from Mr. Blaine. His quarrel
with Blaine dates back to the time when he was
a candidate for the collectorship of Portland,
and Mr. Blaine prevented his appointment. Mr.
Marble is the iriond of the Hamlins, the veteran
Hannibal being his ideal, which circumstance
indicates a return to political power of the Ham
lins. Before Mr. Marble was chosen to the
Maine Senate his hostility towards the Blainites
was so noticeable and so open that there was
considerable alarm in the Augusta camp, which
fact had a great deal to do with his getting his
seat in the Senate. It is said that had the Blain
ites even dreamed of the event which has taken
place Mr. Marble never would have been chosen
President of the Senate.

One of my daughters is finishing her education
at a French choI. and one thing that I have
noticed about the French educational system is
what I may describe as its somewhat narrow
patriotism. The geography of France appears,
for instance, to be the only geography that the
Frencli teachers seem to think worth knowing,
atid, according ,to them, the eigbty eevin de
partments' of France are far and away more im
portant and worthy of ;tndy than the thirty
e'ght States of America. , As for this patriotism,
I fancy the Germans must feel considerable irri
tation at tre Parisians keeping the statue of
Strasborg i. the Place da la Concorde, and at
the way they go on about Alsace-Lorraine. The
French seem to forget that they originally took
these countries from the Germans, that the
language, customs and ways of thinking and
even paming of those people are German, and.
morover, that it is to the fact cf their having,
the plodding, industrious, go-ahead character of
the German race that they ow their prosperity
and wealth. It is my opinion that in three gen
erations at the most, the people of Alsace-Lor--raine
will once again be German, heart and soul.
"I am not astonished at the verv small
amount of interest which is being taken in
France over the Shakspeare-Bacon controversy.
The French know next to nothing about Ameri
can affair, and very little about the English. I
myself am interested in this question in 60 far
that I know Mr. Donnelly. He is a very inge
nious and subtle student. My own opinion on
the subject is that it is unfair and practically
impossible to argue as to the anthenticity of the
works of a man who died 300 years ago. It
does sound improbable that a man like Shak
speare, a lounger in tap-rooms, a convicted
poacher and ne'er-do-well, who did not even
succeed in any measure in his profession as a
third-rate actor, should be the author of such
works, snd that we should owe the sublimest
literature of anr age and tongue to such a man.
But as 1 nay, argument ab improbable is emi
nently untair. Marlowe, for instance, was a
man of notoriously bad,life. One might, argu
ing ab ituprobabile, state that it is impossible
that he should be the author of his works, but
this has never been contested. Again, look st
Barns. When we hear of him lounging with
louts in village public-houses and putting gin
and wbiskv about, we might by the same argu
ment prove that he was aot the author of the
beautiful poems he wrote. Yes, we are all re
turning to simple poetry. It ia a reaction from
the intense, passionate, dramatic poetry of
Swinburne, for instance. As you say, it is the
soda after champagne."
THE UOOMKI) KN'IUHTS.
Their Downfal Only a Matter of Time Dis
cord Among the Leaders.
New York Commercial Advertiser.
Last July this newspaper showed that the
Knights of Labor had been reduced in number
from 1,000,009 to 500,000 within a year, and
predicted that the dimunition would continue in
the same proportion unless a radical reorganiza
tion of the order was effected. Events since that
time have proved the prediction to be true. The
Knights have gone on in their course, and to-day
it is shown by the rival labor organization, the
American Federation of Labor, and is not denied
by Mr. Powderly or his lieutenants, that the
number of the Knights of Labor is between
250,000 and 300,000. Defections have gone on
steadily since last summer. Nearly every
week within the last six' months news has
come that some Jocal or district Assemblies
had deserted. The arbitrary course of the Pow
derly rice at the Minneapolis convention
virtually destroyed the order ia the West. The
Chicago and Detroit. Knights rose in rebellion,
and it is calculated that folly fifty thousand
members of the organization left it within s
month after the convention. Darin; the last
month great efforts have been made by the Pow
derly court ia the Philadelphia palace to com
bine the remnants of the order and keep up the
court's salaried, but the result of these efforts
seems to prove that the once great order is
doomed. In New York city numerous local as
semblies have lately deserted. Local assembly
No. 5080, paper-hangers, left the order in a body
on Nov. 27, and just now the 'longshoremen,
numbering 10,000 men. are about to go over to
the Federation of Labor. The stationary engi
neers are aleoabout to leave, and the hack-drivers
are in a state bordering on revolt Only about one
fourth of the members of district aesetnbly No.
49 of a year ago remain to-day, and most of
them are in a state of apathy, amounting almost
to revolt. The Home Club, which used to be
the corner-stone of the assembly, has gone to
pieces. It was organized after a Franco com
munistic plan. Seven men met, snd agreed that
each should form a group of seven, the first
chosen of each group to select another seven,
and so on indefinitely. For .a time the groups
thus formed constituted a pAwerful body,-and
eventnallv controlled Powderly and the general
executive board. But, with the genetal decline
of the Knights came tho breaking np of the
groups snd before the Minneapolis convention
only an insignificant remnant of this Home
Cluo remained. This remnant has gone into
active opposition to Powderly.
During this month internal dissensions in the
order have gone further than defections and op
position to the methods prevailing at the Phila
delphia headquarters. Rumors are rife tbat the
order will eo out of existence not by tho quiet
process of inanition, but by a convulsion which
will leave the leaders diereced and possibly li
able to criminal indictments. A week ago the
elements in the ceneral executive board which
constituted the chief opposition to Powderly at
Minneapolis got together as many enemies of
the grand master workman ss they could, and
formed a "t divisional commtttee," whose pur
rose it is to demand from ' Powderly and the
general executive beard an account of the fi
nances of the order since they have reigned,
Powderly, it la said, has promised to appear.be
fore the committee. It is not expected that he
will have any statement ready. He will proba
bly try to stave off the matter as lone as possi
ble. The "provisional committee"' has
hint? nnest ions ready.
Powderly's treasurer, it will be remembered, "
reported at the Minneapolis convention ia
half million dollars had come into the treasury
since the convention at Richmond and that
there was a balance on hand of $3,792. He
rather took away the breath of the delegates by
announcing that nearly $100,000 had been ex
pended in salaries. But this might have been
forgiven if the rest of the expenditures had been
accounted for. No other bill was given except a
hotel bill of some of the officers and their wives
jn Philadelphia. One of these officers'! wires
stayed at the hotel two days, and one of the snb
items in this bill was ?23 for washing. This
wash-bill astounded the delegates acd excited
in tbero a burning curiosity to find out if the re
maining $400,000 was spent in keeping white the
linen of the Philadelphia satraps and Xhsir
families. Bailey and Barry, Powderly's chief
opponents in the executive board, have been
specially curious about the big sura unaccounted
for, and to their efforts is due the existence of
the provisional committee.
The committee is very much in earnest It
proposes to com pal the gentlemen of the gor
geous palace to open their books, even if legal
proceedings have to be resorted to. Last Sun
day evening the conlmittee prepared a formal ,
demand for an itemized account of expenses for
the last year; and resolved that a suit in conrt
should be began if the demand were not com
plied with. This is the most dangerous attack
that has ever been made on the Powderly ring.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to
the treasurer's late report, have been expended
for "secret work." If the books are produced ia
court, it will be seen what this "secret work" is.
No one expects that it will prove to be anything
to the credit of the ring, for it has so persist
ently refused to explain to its associates what
L'seeret work" means that grave suspicions have
been exeitea. -
If it comes to an open war, those men of the
provisional committee propose to leave the
order and form the Brotherhood of Labor, a
rival organization. With the large accessions
which they would gain in an open revolt, they
expect that thev could prosecute a suit with
greater force. They have received assurances
of support from the district assemblies of Chi
cago and Detroit, from the excluded Carpet
workers' Assemb'v. and from the Montanks, of
Brooslvn. The Federation of Labor would, no
doubt, lend a helning hand, too, in remembrance
of Towderly's bitter war against the trades
unions The principles of the Knights are essentially
antagonistic to the first ideas cf American
workmen, and workmen themselves acknowl
edge that. this is the cause of the organization's
collapse. The principle on which it waa founded
was the same that underlies the government
or Russia despotism, a centralization of
power and a total ignoring of the autonomy
of the various interests that entered into
its composition. Just at the opportune mo
ment the American Federation of Lsbor came
into existence and offered a shelter to
the disaffected Knights. The Federation prom
ised a new order of thing?; that the anions
should be recognized in their trade capacities;
that the general organization should assist the
unions in trouble with employers, but should
not interfere; that strikes should be settled
solely by the union affected, and that there
should be no interference in the way of trade
marks or labels. The Federation promised a
democratic government similar to that which
binds the States together. Each union was to be
supreme in all matters not affecting the other.
The Knights, after their experience of despot
ism, found these promises attractive, and went
over to the Federation in large numbers. The
new order numbered 23,000 men at the time of
its organization. It now claims to have three
quarters of a million. The office of the presi
dent is in a little room back of a cigar store
near Franklin square. His salary is (1,000 a
year, and he has uo secretary.
A BIG STEAL.
A Contract- Describe How a Section of the
Union Pacific Was ftullt.
St. f.onis Post-TMppatch.
Henry S. Cameron, at present a resident of
Philadelphia, bnt who for the last twenty-five
vears has been a- railroad contractor and hat-
traveled through the country from the Atlantic
to the Pacific in the line of his profession, ar
rived in the city on his way to California last
night and is at the Southern. A reporter called
upon Mr. Cameron and requested him to give an
account of some of his experiences in the con
struction of railroads in the West. "My first
large contract." began Mr. Cameron, "was in
connection with the construction of the Union
Pacific railroad.
"The constrnction of this road has always
been considered a wonderful feat, and so it was
in its conception, but in Its execution it was one
of the easiest tasks I ever engaged in. From the
Platte to the river Jordan in Utah, the country
F resents fewer engineering difficulties than any
ever saw. and there was scarcely a place be
tween Omaha and Weber canyon, a distance of
over a thousand miles, where any grading was
necessary. Bnt this was not known to the au
thorities at Washington, and one of ths most
coolly impudent robberies I ever heard of was
perpetrated by the Union Pacific Company, in
well-faunded reliance upon the government's
carelessness and lack of knowledge. The gov
ernment allowed the road $16,000 a mile
for work on the plain. and, $32,000
a mile for mountain work. When
the line reached a point just west of Cheyenne,
and work was suspended for a month or two,
agents of the road went to New York and Wsh-in-ton,
and told terrible tales of the frightful
passes to be crossed, and the difficulties tbat
would be encountered in the passage of the
R cky mountains. A number of photographers
were sent to the wildest parts of the mountains,
and Washington wes flooded with photographs
of rocky cliffs, yawning chasms and raging tor
rents. 'This plan bad the effect of preventing
any close scrutiny being made when the
mountain appropriation of $32,000 was de
manded by the railroad, and for 150
miles this amount was paid. As a mat
ter of fact the country west of Cheyenne is a
perfectly smooth prairie with quit an aseent,
it is true, but presenting no engineering difficul
ties whatever. As a matter of fact, the road
pursues a most sinuous path over the Laramie
plains, ia order to secure the appropriation given
only for very difficult mountain work. What
was received from the government, including
tne land grant, more than built and equipped
the road, and those on the inside really received
it in return for their labor in planning and man
aging the construction.
"One fact was moat forcibly impressed upon
me," continued Mr. Cameron, "and tbat was the
engineering skill of the pioneers who crossed
the continent in wagons. For hundrsds of miles
ths railroad runs slong the old emigrant trail,
and whers it was departed from the disadvant
ages of the new line, generally outweighed the
advantages. From the North Platte to ths
River Jordan the old trail is on the best line
that could be laid out, and in most cases where
the railroad diverged from it the object was to
run over a particularly easy country in a zigzag
line, thus securing a larger amount cf money
from the government.
"The lawlessness that prevailed daring the
eonstractioa of the road," Mr. Cameron went oa
to say, "was something unexampled in this
country since the early days of California
The workmen were Irish, for the most part, and
inclined to be violent, but they were not mur
derous. Bat the road gangs were accompanied
by a perfect swarm of gamblers, who robbed
the men of their last cent, and were a fearful
pest. These men were old frontiersmen, who
were accustomed to settling all disputes with
knife and pistol, and the Irish fell like sheep be
fore them. At the right of each dealer at the
numerous faro tables lay a heavy army re
volver, with the barrel sawed off to render
its handling more easy and rapid, and in many
eases the catches on the hammer were filed
"away. The reason for this was that a pistol of
this kind could be discharged, in a second by
simply drawing back the hammer and letting it
fall again, thus saving several seconds of valua
b.e time. Before such men the Irish, unskilled
in arms, were helpless, and many hundreds were
killed before the road was completed. Some
times Judge Lynch stepped in. but generally the
murders went on as if nothing had happened.
The whole road was lined with the wooden bead
hoards of the slain, bearing ths name of the
murdered man and the eim pie but significant
words, 'Killed at sucti and such a date.'
"Cheyenne and Laramie, which were each the
depots of the road for some time, were particu
larly lawless places in those days, but they both
paled before the reign ot terror that broke oat
at Promontory,' in Uth. where the Cnion and
Central roads met Here the lawless elements
of both roads were brought together and a per
fect pandemonium ensued. For fifty miles the
roads were built side bv side, as there was a
dipateas to the territory belonging to each, and
both wished to obtain the point which it claimed
as its terminus. The gangs were guarded by
armed men, between whom deadly fights often
sprung no. and the losses wer. in the aggre
gate, as heavy as those of a eonsiderablo battle,
t he dispute was finally settled and the roads
met at Ogden. which has ever since been the
terminus of each.
"When the construction was complete! ths re
were many thousands of men without em
ployment ia a strange country. Tne suffering
tbat ensaed was great. A few went to the mines
and a few found permanent employment on ths
roads, but ths great majority were in a desper
ate condition. The effect of this was to increase
highway robbery to a most alarming extent, and
for months after tbs men were discharged no
one could move about at night with any feeling
of eafety. Some of the most desperate outlaws
the West has ever seen date their career of
crime from this time. A man lived ia the midst
of excitement ia those days, and I often regret
that I shall never see their like again."
SATED HER FROM MAGAKA,
Sis. Tagliapletra's Drave Rescue of Bliss
Marie Greenwood.
Niagara Falls Special.
A merry party of ladies and gentlemen, en
joying their last view of the cataract, were
thrown into consternation this morning bv a
horrifying cry from one of their number, God
help me. I'm lost."
Mies Marie Greenwood, of Memphis. Tenn..
was seen straggling in the water. A broad
shouldered man had eancbt her arms and waa
exerting his utmost streegth to combat tb
rushing tide which swept against the woman's
dress and threatened every instant to tear her
from h;s grasp. Miss Greenwood's face was
white -nd her lips moved silently while her ra
cuer slowly, bat surely, palled her from the
water. jOnce safe upon the bank the woman
fainted, snd only recovered consciousness an
hoar later st the Spencer House, whither shs
was hurried in a carriage.
Miss Greenwood's rescuer was Sig. Tagiia
pietra. the well-known opera booffa- artist, and
both are members of the Greenwood Opera
Company, which bas spent two weeks in re
hearsal here. Miss Greenwood, who is younrf
and pretty and has a rich father, is ss impulsive
in her actions as in her likes and dislikes. Her
wtim to go upon the operatic stage was humored
by her father, who organized a company es
pecially to support her.
Her fancy for visiting Luna island has bee a
gratified daring nearly evtry day of the com
panv's stay here. The tpot where the party
were gathered this morning is the most danger
ous point in this vicinity. The island is almost
level with the water, which rushes past at torri
ble speed. A few feet away are the American
Falls. Many a tragedy has been enacted here,
and one of th gentlemen recited the story cf m
girl who is thought to have thrown herself luta
the river from thi point lat winter. Mis
Miss Greenwood said, laughingly, that sheceald
not understand how anyone could jump
into such cold water. ,
"It's cold as ice-water, now, I'm sure," she
repeated. - Wait a minute and I'll tell too."
She stepped to the edge and. placing her foci -on
a stone, stooped to put her hand ia the
water. Her foot slipped and as she threw her
self back involuntarily, both her feet went into
the water. The swift current caught her dree
snd whirled her down stream, but Taghametra,
who had stood very near, fearicg an eeejdent.
caught both arms and held the terrified
woman. Only the one cry escaped her. After
recovering from her swoon she was very weak
and nervous. To the World correspondent; who
was admitted to her room this afternoon, Misa
Greenwood said:
"I never was so thoroughly frightened in ail
my life. I thought of all the terrible things I
had read about the Falls, and I was sure I was
lost Th Signor saved my life at a fearfnl
risk, I know. He says be was in no danger, bus
if his foot had slipped, as mine did, we would
both have been swept over."
The thought of such a possibility was too much
for the singer, and she closed her eyes and shud
dered. Tagliapietra was disposed to make light
of the affair, and though showered with compli
ments for bis bravery he oniy sbrngged his
shoulders and said, "It wa nothing. A pair o
wet feet; that is all." To the World correspond
ent, who obtained a detailed description of the.
affair from him. the Signor acknowledged that
he thought be wss taking great chances tor his
life. "I thought of Deforest, snd hang on till I
thought my arms would be palled out," he said.
' Miss Greenwood is very impulsive, and I have
always kept close at her side since we have been,
at the Falls."
Luna island is regarded with particular horrol
bv residents here because it was the scene of s
terrible trsgedy fonr years ago, the participants'
in which were two prominent gentlemen of Sus
pension Bridge. Van R. Pierson was cashier af
the New York Central freight honse. and Janet ,
and Thomas Yedder, who kept the leading gro
cery store in. the section, were brothers of Mrs.
Pierson. All were well-known and respected
middle-aged people, Pierson drank a good
deal bat the Yedders not at sll. Pierson'a
actions were sometimes very erratic. One win- '
teraJternoon Pierson invited his brother-ia-lawi
"to take a drive, and the beccy wns eeen "oitijt
across the Goat "island bridge. The next day
search was made for the men, and the hors
and vehiele were found on Goat island. Ot
Luna island, near the brink, lay the dead body
of Pierson with a bullet through bis heart. An
empty revolver was oa the ground. All aroand
on the snow were drops of blood and evidences
of a severe straggle. Footprints led towards th
water, hut were lost near tbe edge. It war
never known whether there was one auieide o
two. and tbe ease has remained a mystery.
Tbe tragedy that is perhaps best known if.
connertion with this fatsl spot dates back to"
June 21, 1849. Charles Addington accompanied
the Deforest family, of Buffalo, to the Falls, and
they visited Luna island. While they were
standing close to th water's edge, and within a
few feet of the American Fall, Addington ad
vanced playfully to Miss Annette, the little
daughter of Mr. Deforest, saying: "I am going,
to throw you in." He lifted her up and over the-'
water in his arms, and the little one, in an invi
pulse of fear, sprang into fhe river. Addington
jumped after her instantly, and both bodies
were swept over tbe cataract together.
