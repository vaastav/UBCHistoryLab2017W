BATTLE FOR CHILDREN"
STILL FIERCELY WAGED
diaries and Counter-Charges
j of Spicy Xature Made liy Op
posing Counsel.
J'AHIS. Doc. JG. The last day of-the
hearing of the suit brought by Count
Boni do Castellanc acainst his former
wife, the Princess do Sagan, formerly
Anna Gould, in which he "petitions the
court -to award the custody of his three
children to his mother, the Marquise
de Castellanc, brought out t.he fact that
the count had withdrawn his demand
that tho court allow lihn a yearly in
come of $60,000 for keeping the chil
dren. 2d. Bonnet, speaking for tho couut,
read a letter from his client filled with
indignant protests that he should have
been charged with instituting the pro
ceedings to obtain money, and in which
tho count abandoned his claim for the
allowance. Lie insisted that his only
ob.icet in wanting the children was his
I solicitude for their moral and physical
welfare.
Tardy denunciation.
It is evident that tho count has rec
ognized that his claim for the iaruc
allowance has injured his case in the
eyes of the court and tho estimation of j
the public, and his tardy renunciation
is considered a clever move to enlist
sympathv in his favor. Nevertheless
the public is greatly astonished that
the count should go to such an ex
treme. The proceedings were filled with alle
gations from both- sides. Tho public
prosecutor will preseut his conclusions
next week and the court will then ren
der its decibiou. It will cither dismiss
the count's plea or grant him the ens- I
tody of tho children, or, if doubt ex- I
ists. will order the taking of testimony, j
The Princess de Sagan continues to i
be sauguino of a favorable decision. I
After asking the court to tako note
of tho modification of tho petition of
his client, M. Eonnot launched into a
vigorous denunciation of his adversaries.
Ho charged that ou many points the
defendants did not dare to meet tho
allegation that) tho Princess do Sacan
was ready to leave her present hus
band. ''They did. not dnrc challenge this
statement," the law3er said, "because
the- know that tho proposed separation
ba3 been formally- communicated to de
Castellanc !s attorneys."
Counter Allegations.
Contiuuingi 31. Bonnet said that all
the offers of settlement made by. the
Princess, do Sagan were conditioned
upon tho count renunciation of his
children, but tho count refused to sell
cither himself or his children. The
princess had told Jndge Ditto that if
the children were taken from her she
would disinherit them, thus proving that
in her eyes everj'thing was a question
of money.
Peferriug to the charges that, de
Castellano had dissipated his wife's
fortune, 31. Bonnet insisted that the
countess was .iust as much responsible
as her husband for the "royal ex
travagances," such as the 3talakoff
palace, the chateau Marais and tho
charitv bazar, which alone costs $300,
000. The lawyer resented George
Gould's share in tho defense, saying
that now tho question of money had
been eliminated, Mr. Gould was play
ing the mysterious rolo of Crawford m
the Humbert affair. As a matter of
fact 3Ir. Gould always had opposed tho
marriago of his sister to the Prince de
Sayau and he only finally consented on
condition that there should bo a sep
aration of property.
Sarcastic Comment.
"Does Mr. Gould fear that his sister
will get another divorce and make a
more unfortunate marriage'7" asked
31. Bonnet. "No, I can reassuro him;
the princess can find nobody worse
than de Sagan."
Tho lawyer then asko.d the court to
order the taking of testimony on points
which the defense had declined to meet.
In conclusion, he appealed to the court
to withdraw the three children from
the custody of their mother, who had
married a man renounced by one of the
greatest families of France, mid who
"had spent a month in prison," and
place them in the care of the mother
of the. count, whose only purpose was
tn. direct her grandchildren in the right
path.
Speak inc for the princess, 31. Cle-ineiiceaii-
characterized de Castellano s
change of attitude on the money ques
tiou as a "nailery play" induced lu
i his tardy appreciation of Iho unprece
dented character of hi3 demand for :tu
allowance of .$00,000 a year and the
sevcritv with which the public had "con
demned and ridiculed him. Touching
the count's statement that ho re
nounced this claim "with pleasure,"
tho lawyer announced:
"If the count took such pleasure in
ronouncing this demand, why did he
over formulate i:7"
George Gould's Position.
31, Clemcnceau .jutitiod tho interven
tion of Georeo Gould on tho cround of
his sister's interests, and said ho could
not understand why Mr. Gould was the
object of such violent attacks. Jin de
nounced Castellano 's conduct; during
the period of his marriage. Tho count,
he said, should have been irrepronch'
able in order to avoid tho insinuation
that lie had married 3IifiS Gould for her
money. The lawyer then reminded the
court that the real battle was between
two men, Count de Castellanc and
Prince de Sagan, who hated each other.
31V. Clemcnceau concluded that tho
Princess de Sngnn had not forfeited nny
of tho confidence reposed in her when
tho court cave her the custody of her
three children, and he asked tho court
to -maintain his client in his rights. I

! FLUSHING, N. Y., Dec. IU. The
I story of tho slaying of William E.
; Annis as he sat in his catboat and
was riddled with bullets, was today
made part of the record in the trial
of Thornton J. Hains, a magazine
writer, charged with being a principal
with his brother. Captain Tcter C.
Ilains, Jr., in tho murder of Annis
last summer.
Tracing the movements of the prin
cipals at the Bayside Yacht club trag
edy with the aid of miniature iron fig
ures and models of the float and the
catboat, Edward Andrews, a yacht club
member, showed under examination how
tho army captaiu, standing on the
tloat's edge, held aloft the obscuring
boom and sail of Annis 's boat and shot
the publisher as he sat by the tiller.
One Witness Missing,
! There was surpriso when it was
learned that John 'Conning, a Swedish
boatman, who saw the tragdy, could
not bo located.
District Attorney Darwin said he
thought Tonninji was in Sweden, but
that nothing had been heard from him
since last September.
"He was an important witness .for
us," said Lawyer 3iclntyre, "for
through him we would have shown
that Tic struck Captain Hains after
the shooting with a boathook or oar,
and that to protect his brother Thorn
ton Hains drew his revolver."
The cross-examination of Andrews
consumed the major portion of the af
ternoon, and Lawyer 3IcIntyro soucrht
to develop that Thornton Hains had
said after the shooting that he had
tried to dissuade Captain Hains fTom
his act, and that he would hold him
until tho officers came.
I Special Prosecutor White declared ev
idence would be brought out to show
that Thornton Hains had full knowl
edge of his brother's intentions to kill
Annis, and virtually Jed the way to
the yacht club and directed tho search
for the publisher. 3Ir. White declared
that Thornton Hains pointed his re-vohc-r
at 3Irs. Annis and prevented her
from going to the aid Gf her wounded
husband.
PRESIDENT OF RUSSIAN
PARLIAMENT RESIGNS
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. IS During,
an exciting session of the duma this aft
ernoon Nlckola Khomaynkoff. president
of the duma, resigned. Late tonight there
was srill much uncertainty ns to M. Kho
mayakoft's position, as ho did not present
his resignation to the chancellory of the
duma. where it was declared that the In
cident might be regarded as closed. Pos
sibly, therefore. It may bo reconsidered.
Excitement arose over tho discussion of
tho government bill to grant a credit of
$500,000 for the benefit of the employes of
the prisons administrations who were
victims of outrages while on duty, or of
their families. The Socialists nnd Labor
ltcs hotly denounced the administration
and the Inquisitorial torturing methods
applied to political prisoners.
Deputy F.osanoff asserted that as a re
sult of the rigorous rule 60 per cent of
the prisoners died of consumption. The
Right deputies angrily protested against
this, whereupon M. Rosanoft declared that
tho Rightists possess less honor than tho
Russian convicts on the even of execu
tion. President Khomayakoff called upon
M. Rosanofi ti withdraw thJ3 expression.
M. Rosanoff did so to the satisfaction
of the president of tho duma, but tho
Rightists quitted tho house In a body nnd
went to tho president's room, whore they
Insisted that M. Rosanoff must apologise.
Thereupon M. Khomayakoff resigned.

Iry President's Comments on 91
Secret Service Law. R
BITTER COMMENT MADE
BY SEYERAL LEADERS
Senator Culberson Says Mes- B
sage Was "Deliberate, Studied S
Insult to Congress." B
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10. The sen- IB
ate today docidod definitely to enter jB
upon an investigation relative to the
portion of the annual message of the ME
president which criticises tho action of HH
congress in prohibiting tho detail or, Hi
secret service men to duty iu other
departments. BBl
The resolution directing the inquiry jB
! has been in contemplation' ever since KB
the mcEsage was received on Tuesday
of last week, but there had been some
difficulty in arriving at tho terms in B
which it should be couched and iu IK
agreeing upon tho proper person to iu- IB
troduco it. It was at last decided rha-
Senator Aldrich should stand sponsor" HE
for the measure and today, after Sena
tor Lodge had completed his speech ou
tho Brownsville affair, the Rhode Island H
; senator took the floor and presented a
resolution authorizing the inquiry. IffMi
Senator Culberson, the caucus leader HhI
of the Democrats, immediately sent up BMb
a substitute, which was somewhat IHl
more specific. Bi!
Prompt Action Taken. HMj
j Both measures wcro promptly re-,
ferred to the committee on contingent VJ1
expenses, and almost immediately after- IBV
ward Senator Kean, from that commit- BE
tee, reported back tho Aidrich rcaolu- H!
tion with a recommendation that it nH
7as. Senator Culberson made prompt UHV
(ibjcction and it looked for a ttmo as jBj
if tho consideration of tho subject
would be postponed until tomorrow. 9lE
Finally the Democrats made it known Hi
that they would interpose no objection IH
to tho immediate consideration of the flVa
Aldrich resolution if the portion of the flWJl
Culberson substitute directing the com- jjH
mi t tee on appropriations to advise the Vj
senate specifically as to tbo course of jH
action it should takc with reference to IvAl
tho message could be incorporated. in it. ffljB
The resolution was aifa'iu' referred to nVJ
the committee on contingent expenses jB
and Chairman Kean of that committee flB
was prompt in reporting, a rccommenda- V
tion for the adoption of tho Aldrich
resolution with the. addition of the Cul- B
hereon provision. After a very ant- IBI
i mated discussion the resolution was Sfii
adopted without division aud thus wm uVJ
j the inquiry decided upon. Tho r'esolu- IBI
tion as adopted follows: flB
Text of Bosolutiou. B
j "Kesolved, That. that , portion of tho B
annual messago of the president relat- flB
ing to the secret sendee is hereby re- HJ
ferred to the committee on appropria- HH
tions, who aro instructed to inquiro flflj
whether the legislation referred to iu IHH
the message has impaired the efficiency B
or sufficiency of tho force omployed in VJ
the secret service; and such commit- jWfll
tee is further directed to ascertain IBI
what persons other than those included jPfl
in the secret service were paid from the IqB
public treasury for tho fiscal year ended iflH
June 30. 1P0S, for services in conucc- HH
tion with the enforcement of the laws
or for work in the detection or iuves- flfl
tigation of possible crimes or criminal flM
acts or violation of the law, including flf
all special attornejrs, special ageuts, in flflj
spectors, or other employees of any HB
department of tho government, or any jE
branch of the public service, arid also IBI
some information as to all persons pBI
whose employment was authorized b IBf
indefinite or general appropriations; the flH
information to contain the names of all
persons so employed or paid, their pre 9fll
vious occupations, the natiiTO of tho bgM
work in which thev were engaged, In Ircl
whom they were appointed, aud upon MBm
whoso suggestion or recommendation; (jflj
the inquiry, however, not to include of HB
ficers appointed by the president aud im
continued by tho senate, or officers spc mm
eilieally provided by law. or laborers ap 9jK
pointed as such and actually engaged in MM

Tako Swont Testimony. H
The resolution further authorises the. JflJ
committee ou appro-nations to sub BBj
poena witnesses and cxamiuo them nn- HH
dor oath, and further to rcconiineud MB
what action, if any, in the judgment of UB
iho committee tho senate should take
iu the matter. H
Mr. Dailev objected to tho rosolutioa B
because it did not direct tho commit- Btt
tec to inquire into the 4 very gross and
wantou" words of tho prcsidoiit's nics- H
'So far as 1 am concerned, lie B
said, "no action should be taken on
that resolution. Bit Iter congress is tho flf
most infamous body that ever assembled flf
iu nuv country of the world, or it will JA
take some notice of this most wntilon IKh
and gross insult ever giveu any body wM
in Iho world " jfll;
Mr. Aldrich insisted that iho resolu- H
tion provided for just what Mr. Bailey Hi
advocated, but the senator from Texas Hf
retorted that if that was included in IfiSt
Iho resolution it was in mild terms, iHaF
Mr. Hale declared the resolution was
sufficiently strongly worded to permit Wtk
the commit too on appropriations to fff
make tho kind of report desired by Mr. mm.
'I'would like to inquire of tho sena- Rj"
tor from Maine." interposed Mr. Till- HMf
man, "whether ho think Iho scuate has j 111
been insulted'?'' j mj.
Mr. Hale insisted that everyone had flgv
his own opinion on that subject aud mm
anyone was able as ho. to form ati opin-
