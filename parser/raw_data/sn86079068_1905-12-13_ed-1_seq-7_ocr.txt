directs attention to the inef
ficiency of State control, de
claring "the insurance business
has outgrown in magnitude the
possibility of adequate State su
pervision," and asks Congress to .
carefully consider whether
further legislation can be had."
On the tariff he makes no recom
mendation, but suggests that
Congress consider the plan of
"maximum sad minimun rates"
so as "to secure a certain recip
rocity of treatment between
other nations, and ourselves."
