crops from one to ten' i™'es. Good country
roads would therefore be a« great a necessity as

Richmond, Lexington, and other places, and we
have no doubt the entertainment afforded on the
occasion will be highly creditable.
These Ladies are working in behalf of a weak
church and tho congregation have, during its
short existence, expended within themselves
nearly ten thousand dollars for church purposes.
Having done so well, they deserve help.

It will be seen that the Lexington Gazette calls
the "ancestor" of Mr. Robert Garrett, President
of the Valley Railroad Company, "the cornet of
gi -nat coi. Tira « rcial enterprises." As the "cornet-'
|i r wiw i, _nstrunient, this is not very compli

n Jt "tho organizer of success." The Gazette
c: ll.led attention io a typographical error in a
m •n-riage notice published in this paper, and we
mixtion the above error in that journal merely
to hb_~ it of the truth contained in tbe adage,

for the best way to i m p rove t he place; t» draw
attention to its advantages, and to induce

always ready to take hold oi an enterprise, and
push it along, so as to insure its success. People
of a passive or negative disposition never do
anything towards helping on a place; if it grows,
it is without any assistance from them ; they are
mere drones in a hive, and while they may never
do any harm, they never do much good. It is
your bold, active, persistent, self-reliant man
who always succeeds, and it is this class of peo
ple, above all others, that builds up and sustains
every great public enterprise. While others are
planning and getting ready to work, they have
gone ahead and reaped all the Tewards of suc

Miss Jeanie Patterson. — We take pleasure
in stating to tbe Staunton public that this gifted
young lady will give an entertainment of Read
ing and Recitation in this city, one evening this
week—time and place to be given hereafter. —
The following notice, taken from a Southern ex
change, will acquaint our readers with her his
tory and the object of her reading—
"Miss Patterson is a very young lady, but she
has already won no inconsiderable fane thro'-
out tbe South by her talents as a reader and elo
cutionist. Her history is a peculiar one, and
mournful as it is peculiar. The young lady is a
native of Mississippi, her place of nativity be
ing, we believe, "the famous old town of Port
Gibson in that State. Reared in affluence and
tenderly nurtured, she found herself at the close
of terrible years of war, like most people in our
unhappy country, poor and compelled to person
al industry for the support of her aged adopted
mother, to whom this young girl, untried as she
was in the ways of the world, was all that was
left capable of practical exertion. After reflec
ting gravely over her capacities for profitable
industry in some especial channel. Miss Patter
son determined to go upon the stage, and by the
exercise of her talents as a reader, cultivated
when no forewarning voice whispered that their
future application would be for bread, earn for
herself and thoso dependent upon her that sup
port of which the accident of war had cruelly
deprived them.
And the selection, prompted by sharp necessi
ty and filial devotion, has proved entirely suc
cessful. Wherever the young reader bas ap
peared, enthusiastic audiences have greeted her,
and golden words of praise and encouragement
have made bright her arduous way."
Editorial criticisms from a large number of
journals all over the South bear flattering testi
mony to her histrionic talent. In addition, she
carries with her testimonials from prominent cit
izens of the South and of our own State. We
trust she will be received here, as at other places,
with a crowded house.

CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS
XLIInd CONGRESS, 2nd SESSION. "
Senate—Monday, Dec. 4th.—Mr. Blair of
fered a resolution of enquiry respecting the ex
ecutijn of the Ku Klux law, wbich went over
under object ions.
The message was read and the Senate ad
journed.
House—The various committees were ap
pointed.
The calling of the roil showed that 201 mem
bers were present.
Mr. Beck offered a resolution asking the
President certain questions regarding the exe
cution ol the Ku Klux law, which meeting
with a ptorm of objections, was referred to the
Committee on Insurrectionary State?.
Messrs. Conner and Hancock, of Texas, were
sworn in, and the other Texas credentials were
referred.
The President's message was read, after
which the House adjourned.
Senate. —Tuesday, Dec. sth.—Mr. Blair's
resolution of enquiry, covering a detailed report
of the Executive action under the Ku Klux
bill, was defeated. The vote was a strict party
one, except Mr. Tipton.
Mr. Kellogg introducted a bill to reorganize
the I listrict courts in Louisiana; also, a bill
providing for mail service between New Orleans
and several Mexican ports.
A resolution calling for tho Catacazy corres
pondence was adopted, Mr. Cameron opposing
it.
House—There was a sharp discussion be
tween Messrs. Wood and Davis regarding the
continuance of the Committee on Insurrection
ary States, which Mr. Wood maintained was a
trick to continue the Reconstruction Commit
tee.
The Administration sustained its first defeat
of the session on the subject of the postal tele
graph.
Mr. Dawes moved to refer to a select com mil
tee so much of the President's message as re
commended the absorption of the telegraph
system in the postal Berviee of the country.
This was opposed by Messrs. Randall, Farns
worth, Niblack, Beck and Burks, who contend
ed that the subjeci should not be taken from a
standing committee and referred to a select one,
which would necessarily, under the parliamen
tary rule, have a majority in favor of the pro
ject.
After an animated discussion, in which the
scheme was denounced as one that would bleed
the Treasury to the ainouat of $70,000,000, and
add 25 000 employees to the civil service of the
government, the motion for a select committee
was defeated, and the whole subject referred to
the Committee on Appropriations, which is
considered tantamount to a rejection of the pro
ject.
Senate—Wednesday, Dec. 6th.—ln the
Senate to-day, concurrent resolutions calling
Colonel Saunders, of North Carolina, and
Messrs Camp and Gist, of South Carolina, to the
bar of the Senate for contempt, went over un
der the rules.
The House resolutions calling for information
regarding Cuba, and the paper in General
Buell's military commission, were adopted.
Mr. Anthony introducted a bill amending the
election act, making it criminal to use any wri
ting, deybc, token, word or gesture with intent
to intimidate voters, or counseling or indirectly
procuring the use of such means of intimida
tion.
Mr. Robertson endeavored to introduce an
amnesty bill, but was declared out of" order.
A caucus of the Senate appointed a commit
tee of five to nominate committees. It seems
probable that Mr. Morton wili succeed Mr.
Cameron as chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Affair?.
House.—The House considered the appor
tionment bill, but reached no conclusion.
Mr. Stevenson, from the Ku Klux Commit
tee, offered a resolution ior the removal of po
litical disabilities; extending the time within
which the writ of habeas corpus may be sus
pended, and making every member of the Ku
Klux and other treasonable conspiracies respon
sible, civilly and criminally, for the acts of their
feliow-members
Senate. —Thursday, Dec. 7th. —Mr. Sumner
presented a memorial asking the abolition of the
duty on coal. He thought that his supplemen
tary civil rights bill should be taken up and
passed as a Christmas gift to the colored people
of the country. He also gave notice of a bill
to reduce taxation and abolish the office of com
missioner of internal revenue. Bills were intro
duced increasing the pay of the principal de
partment officials and of commanding officers
in the navy. Also an important bill incorporat
ing "The Postal Telegraph Company," design
ed to do government and private business, and
for the latter to charge not. exceeding 25 cents
for the first twenty words over each circuit of
250 miles. The Senate elected its standing
committees, with Mr. Sumner as chairman of
the comuiiitce on privileges and elections—Mr.
Cameron remaining at the bead of the commit
tee on foreign relations—and the other commit
tees composed substantially as at the last ses
sion, the chairmen being the same throughout
the list. After an executive session the Senate
adjourned over to Monday, the 11th.
House.—ln the House a resolution was a
dopted calling upon the Interior Department
for the necessary information a-certained, from
the census, upon which to base the apportion
ment of congressional representation among the
States. The House adjourned until Monday, the
11th. _
: The Speakership.
The nomination ol Major Marshall Hanger,
of Augusta, by the Conservative caucus for the
position of Speaker of the Boose of Delegatzs
is, we presume, equivalent to an election.
Major Hanger was frequently in the Speak
er's chair during the sessions of the last legis
lature, and it was the subject of general remark
that he presided with great ability. His high
character, good sense, and experience are an
ample assurance that he will discharge the du
ties of his high office to the satisfaction of the
House and the public.
His competitor in tbe caucus was General
James A. Walker, of Pulaski, who would have
made an excellent Speaker, and of whom it is
praise enough tc say that he was chosen to suc
ceed Genera! T. J. Jackson in the command of
the Stonewall Brigade, and in the political
campaign of 1868 was placed on the Withers,
ticket for the position of Lieutenant-Governor
of the State. The vote was very close—4l to
38. — Rich. Enquirer.

Attempted Murder and Robbery.
Special tele-rani to the Dispatch.
Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs
December 9. —A daring attempt at murder was
made here last night on the person of Mr.
Sprowl, bar-keeper at this place. The attack
was made by two negroes, who fired two shots,
each of which took effect in the head of their
victim. He was seriously though it is hoped
not dangereusly wounded. It is supposed that
the intenti n of the assaulters was first to mur
der and then to rob Mr. Sprowl. The perpetra
tors of the outrage are still at large, though
the officers are on their track. Mr. Sprowl is
now confined to his bed.

AN Infallible Remedy.— We are now at
that critical season of the year when ex
cessively hot weather, and the free use of ice
water, fruits and vegetables, are most apt to ere
: ate disorders of the stomach and bowels which,
if not checked in time, not unfrequently lead to
! cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery. Whatever
the natural health and vigor of man or woman.
' excessive heat is apt to produce languor as well
as inertness in the digestive organs, and if na
• ture is not speedily aided in tho performance of
her natural functions disease must fasten upon
' tho system. Dyspepsia, one of the most
loathesome and annoying diseases known to the
human family, receives its vitality and gains its
power from disordered digestion. If taken in
■ its incipient stages it is easy enough to subdue,
but when it once gets a fair hold the patient is
forced to endure much before he can get perma
nent relief. Now, under these circumstances,
we ask if it is not passing strange that persons of
ordinary capacity Decome so short-sighted to
their own interests as not to avail themselves of
a certain and speedy remedy when they find
their appetites failing, their stomachs becoming
disordered and their digestion growing torpid?
And yet such cases may be found in every neigh
borhood, notwithstanding the fact that Baker's
Premium Bitters are known to be an infallible
remedy for all such complaints—that they con
tain not a particle of mineral poison—and that
they are the purest, surest and most active tonic
known. When taken as per direction they erad
icate nervousness in all its forms, improve the
digestion, strengthen the stomach, purify the
blood and effectually expel all substances that
tend to produce biliousness or ague and fever.—
As a family medicine they stand unsurpassed,
while they give tone to the most debilitated con
stitution and vitality to the entire human frame.
Try them and test their merits for all diseases of
the blood or stomach. Sold by druggists every
where. E. BAKER, proprietor,
