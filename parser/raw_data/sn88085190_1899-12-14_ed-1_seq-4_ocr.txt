FINANCE BILL BROUGHT IN
Resolution* Offered Providing for an
Investigation of the Polygamy {Jues>
tlon-In the House.
Washington, Dec. B.—Nearly 800
bills and joint resolutions, several im
portant concurrent resolutions and pe
titions numbering hundreds were pre
sented to the senate today. A major
ity of the bills were old stagers. A
few were of national interest and im
portance. Aldrich had the honor of in
troducing the first measure in the sen
ate. It was the financial bill drawn
by the senate committee on finance —
of which Alrdich is chairman—and
probably was the most important mea
sure introduced during the day.
Resolutions were offered providing
for an investigation by the judiciary
committee of all phases of polygamy
recently presented in connection with
what is known as the Roberts case; ex
pressing the sympathy of the senate for
the Boers in their war with Great Brit
ain, and declaring that Senator N. B.
Scott, of West Virginia, is not entitled
to a seat in the senate. Harris, Popu
list, of Kansas, was appointed to a
temporary member of the committee
on privileges and elections. The ap
pointment is important and significant,
because the committee has under con
sideration the Quay, Clark and Scotl
contests.
The Benate spent half an hour in ex
ecutive session, but beyon.l the very
prompt confirmation of Secretary
Root's nomination, sent in today, and
the reference to committees of the
numerous nominations today, it trans
acted no business
Financial Bill Approved.
Washington, Dec. 8. —The Republi
can members of the house of represent
atives gave their unanimous approval
today to the house financial bill recent
ly introduced, and recommended its
immediate consideration by the houso
and passage after reasonable debate.
Overstreet, of Indiana, who intro
duced and who is in general charge of
the bill, will submit a resolution ask
ing that a special rule be reported for
the immediate consideration of this
measure. The terms of this special
rule are practically agreed upon, and
provide that the debate will begin
Monday, with a final vote at the close
of the week.
ROBERTS FOR THE SENATE.
If tho House Rejects Him He May Be
\|>l><iiiit«-i! to the I pill Body.
New York, Dec. 8. —A special to the
Herald from Washington says: If
Roberts is finally rejected by the house,
as seems inevitable, there is a possi
blity that he may come forward as a
claimant for a seat in the senate. His
rejection by the house, it is expected,
will add to his popularity in Utah, and
it is suggested that if Quay is seated by
the senate, the Democratic governor of
Utah may appoint Roberts to fill the
vacancythat exists in Utah's represent
ation in that body.
As the result of a canvass made by
Quay's friend, it is asserted that 46 of
the 85 senators will vote to seat him
as senator from Pennsylvania. These
figures are obtained by counting the 3'i
(senators now in the senate who voted
either for Corbett or Mantle and 16
others from whom, it is asserted,
promises have been obtained favorable
to Quay. Senator Chandler has called
a special meeting of the committee on
elections to consider the case of Quay.
Appliance** of Safety.
Washington, Dec. B.—The interstate
commerce commission gave a hearing
to the representatives of the several
companies asking for a further exten
sion of the time allowed the railroads
to equip their lines with safety appli
ances. Two years ago the commission
granted an extension until January 1,
1900. The further extension asked for
at the present time is one year. The
representatives of various labor organi
zations were also present to offer their
side of the case. Representatives of
about 100 roads were in attendance.
Recent Shelling at Ladysmith.
Ladysmith, Dec. B.—The hottest
bombardment of the siege took place a
week ago Thursday. The Boers got a
new big gun in jxmtion on Lombard
skop, completely commanding the
town, and shelled our camp that day
and yesterday, plauting shells with
great accuracy in the camp of the Gor
don Highlanders and the Manchester
regiment, where there were many nar
row encapes. Today the enemy resumed
the bombardment, doing Rome very
effective shooting. Several of our
guns have been shattered by the Boer
big guns.
German* Are Pleased.
Berlin, Dec. B.—The German gov
ernment and press almost unanimously
welcome President McKinley's message
to congress. Even the agrarian papers,
always opposing things American,
grudgingly admit that the message is
fair and honest. The drift of private
comment is virtually the same.
Customs Laws for West Indies.
Washington, Dec. 8. — Senator
Chandler today introduced bills ap
plying the customs and internal revenui
laws of the United States to the islands
of Cuba and Puerto Rico after January,
1900. Goods between the islands and
the United States are to be exchanged
as between the states.
Boise typographical union declined
to drop the name of Governor Steunen
berg from its Tolls, becaupe of his ac

Pacißc Cable.
Washington. Dec. 7. — Corliss o'.
Michgian introduced a bill for a Pa
cific cable, to be built by the govern
ment, to Hawaii, the Philippines, Ja
pan and China, at a limit of cost of
$8,000,000, of which $700,000 is to be
immediately available. The route and
general control is placed under the Pa
cific cable commission, inlcuding the
postmaster-general and the chief signal
officer of the army.
The Chicago board of trade has taken
the initiative in a movement which
•uns to kill bucket-shops.
ROBERTS EXCLUDED.
The Honit Ordered an Investigation of
IIU Case.
Washington, Dec. 7. —After an in
teresting debate of three hours, the
house today, by a vote of 802 to 30,
adopted the resolution offered by Tay
lor, of Ohio, Monday, for the appoint
ment of a special committee to investi
gate the charges against Brigham H.
Robert*, the Mormon representative
elect from Utah. Previously the house
had rejected a substitute resolution
offered by Richardson, the leader of
the minority, to allow Roberts to be
sworn in and to send the whole case to
the judiciary committee. The substi
tute resolution, however, by no means
commanded the full Democratic
strength. Only 57 members voted for
it. Of the 80 who then voted against
the Taylor resolution, all were Demo
crats except two —Loud and Newlands.
By the terms of the resolution Rob
erts is not only excluded from all par
ticipation in the proceedings of the
house until the committee reports and
the house passes upon his case, but he
is denied a seat in the hall. Whether
this will be interpreted to deny him
admission within the chamber pending
the disposition of his case is yet to be
decided.
The reading of the preßident'B mes
sage was completely overshadowed by
the dramatic proceedings which result
ed in the action of the house today.
The galleries were thronged with spec
tators, mostly women, who sat pa
tiently through the three weary hours
that preceded the debate, and then
waited on three hours more until it was
concluded.
The most remarkable feature of the
debate was the fact that Roberts' pres
entation of his own side of the case,
which lasted almost an hour, became
so absorbing that he won the sympathy
of many of those in the galleries, and
was several times showered with ap
plause. It was evident that he realized
that the house was overwhelmingly
against him, and at times he spoke de
fiantly and fiercely.
During the debate Grosvenor of Ohio
rose to repel indignantly an insinua
tion of Roberts that the. president had
knowingly appointed men guilty of
polygamy to federal offices in Utah.
The Day in the Senate.
Washington, Dec. 7. —Today's ses
sion of the senate lasted two hours and
40 minutes, practically the entire time
being consumed in the reading of the
president's message. The reading was
largely perfunctory, few senators ac
cording it any attention.
The anouncement of the death of
Senator-elect M. L. Uayward, of Ne
braska, was received by the senate
with sincere regret. Although he was
not officially a member of the body, he
was well-known to many of the sena
tors and by them was held in high re
gard. At the conclusion of the reading
of the message, the senate adopted reso
lutions of regret presented by Senator
Thurston, of Nebraska, and as a mark
of respect adjourned immediately.
ATTACK UPON VIGAN.
Filipinos Assaulted the Garrison, Kill-
ing Kight An •'iruii-.
Manila, Dec. 7. —Last night a force
of insurgents, estimated at 800, at
tacked the American garrison of 200 at
Vigan, proivnce of South Ilocos. The
American loss was eight killed and
many wounded.
After very hard fighting the Filipinos
were driven off and through the moun
tains, leaving three dead. Colonel
Bisbee is now reinforcing the garrison.
Fears are entertained regarding vari
ous small bodies of General Young's
troops in the province of Abra.
Manila, Dec. 7. —General Hughes
now occupies Santa Barbara and Cabu
tan, Island of I'anay, his lines extend
ing 35 miles north of 110 110. He has
occupied 20 towns. The inhabitants
are returning with white flags. Their
fear of the Americans is diminishing as
they learn they will be well treated.
It is impossilbe to get the insurgents
to fight. They are retreating to the
mountains, and no more organized re
sistance is expected. Hughes contin
ues advancing north and spreading his
lines.
LINED UP ON THE TUGELA.
Fifteen to Twenty Thousand Boeri
Waiting for Buller.
New York, Dec. 7. —A dispatch to
the Herald from London says:
It is now certain that the Boers are
in great force on the further side of the
Tugela river. The Boer army, which
invaded Natal, was put by good judges
at 25,000 to 30,000 men. If we accept
the latter figure, and deduct 2,000 from
losses which may have been made good
by disloyal Dutch recruits from Natal,
and another 10,000 for the remaining
force at Ladysmith, the total of the
army confronting General Buller may
be from 15,000 to 20,000 men.
In the meantime, some news haa
come through from Ladysmith shoving
that while on the one hand the Boer's
bombardment was becoming severe, on
the other one of the naval guns had
once more silenced the big Boer or
100-pounder.
General Gatacre has occupied and
secured a large quantity of corn which
would doubtless have been command
eered had the Boers been allowed to
make a longer stay.
Train Struck an Electric Car.
Chicago, Dec. 6.—A Wabash rail
road passenger train struck a Thirty
first street electric car at 7 o'clock to
night, killing Charles Shaw, the motor
man, and injuring 10 others, including
Anna Lohr, left shroulder fractured;
Charles Rieman, left foot cut off and
internal injuries, and Frank O'Connor,
left ankle broken and head bruised.
Nebraska City, Dec. 7. — Senator
(Hayward, who has been ill for several
weeks, died at 6:20 this morning.
Voluntary Increase In Wages.
Kansas City, Mo., Deo. 6.—The
Burnham-Hanna-Munger Dry Goods
Company today announced a voluntary
increase in wages of its 800 factory em
ployes of 5 to 12 per cent.
Appropriations Asked for.
In the estimate of appropriations for
the fiscal year ending June 80, 1901,
the war department asks for $90,112,
--851 and the navy $76,469,690. The
grand total is $631,081,994. This ex
ceeds the present year's estimates by
over $38,000,000. The pension de
partment estimate has been reduced.
IFIFTYSIXTH MISS
Senate Adjourned Early as a
Mark of Respect.
HENDERSON ELECTED SPEAKER
Objection Raised to Roberts Taking th«
Oath and Action Poatponrd Pending
Report of Special Committee,
Washington, Dec. s.—Appropriate
tribute to the memory of the late Vice-
President Hobart was paid by the sen
ate today at its first session of the sCth
congress Monday. Tho session lasted
only 33 minutes, and only the most
formal and necessary business was tran
sacted. After the adoption of the usual
routine resolutions and the administra
tion to the new members of the oath of
office, Sewell (Rep. N. J.) presented
fitting resolutions upon the death of
the vice-president, the resolutions were
ordered to be communicated to the
house of representatives, and the ses
sion, on motion of Kean (Rep. N. J.)
was suspended.
As usual on the opening days of con
gress, the senate chamber was a verita
ble conservatory. Pending the actual
convention of the senate, tho chamber
presented a most animated and pictur
esque scene. The galleries were filled
with a brilliant and distinguished aud
ience.
Two protests were filed, one against
the seating of Quay and the other
against Clark, of Montana.
In the House.
Washington, Dec. 5. —Enormous
crowds witnessed the opening scenes in
the house yesterday. The principal
interest centered in the disposition of
Roberts, the Mormon representative
from Utah. Those who anticipated a
sensational denoument were disappoint
ed. The programme outlined by the
Republican leaders at their conference
Friday night was partially carried out.
The objection to the administration of
the oath to Roberts was entered by
Tayler, of Ohio, as predicted, and he
stepped aside without protest except to
ask if by doing so he waived any of his
rights. To this the speaker responded
in the negative. There was not a pro
test from any quarter against the objec
tion to the administration of the oath
to Roberts, but on the contrary the only
voice raised, except that of Tayler, was
that of Mcßae, a Demcorat of Arkan
sas, who joined with Tayler in his pro
test. Tayler offered his resolution to
refer the case to a special committee,
and by mutual arrangement the consid
eration of the resolution Aas postponed
until tomorrow, in order that the rou
tine business in connection with the
organization miy:ht be transacted today.
Although Roberts was not sworn in
today, he secured a seat. This was by
an accident, pure and simple. In the
seat-drawing lottery, no provision had
been made for Roberts, but when the
drawing was completed two others, as
well as himself, had not been provided
with seats, and the speaker asked and
secured from the house permission for
those members who had not drawn
seats to make such selections as they
could. Under this authority, Roberts
got a seat in an obscure portion of the
hall. His daughter sat in the gallery
and watched the proceedings from be
ginning to end.
1 After the election of Speaker Hen
derson and his induction into office,
the appointment of the usual commit
tees to wait Upon the president, the
seat-drawing contest, with the usual
amusing features, went off without a
hitch. The only feature out of the or
dinary was the reception of the Reed
rules as the rules for the present con
gress. They were adopted by a strict
party vote.
Seldom, if ever, have such enormous
crowds swarmed around the house to
witness the opening scenes of the ses
sion as besieged the doors today.
Very early in the day a monster peti
tion, said to consist of 7,000,000
names, protesting against the seating
of Roberts, was brought into the hall.
It had been collected by the New York
Journal. It consisted of 28 rolls of
names, each about two feet in diam
eter, encased in the American flag.
These rolls were stacked up in the area
in front of the clerk's desk and were
viewed with great curiosity.
COAL MINERS STRIKE.
Women Use Guna and Knives to Drive
Men From Work.
Cheyenee, Wyo., Dec. 6.—A week
ago 600 miners employed in the mines
of the Diamondville Coal & Coke Com
pany, at Diamondville, Wyo., struck
for an increase in wages. Their de
mands were refused, and a small force
of non-union men went to work. At
an early hour this morning a mob of
300 women and girls, armed with guns,
knives, clubs and stones, marched to
the mines and compelled the operators
to flee.
The miners at work were dragged
from the mines and alao driven away.
Several were injured by being struck
with clubs, and one man was shot at,
presumably by one of the number of
strikers concealed near the mines. The
piiiiill force of deputies guarding the
company's property was powerless.
The miners have been importing
arms and ammunition and more trou
ble is looked for.
Caught In a Cave-In.
Denver, Dec. 4.—By a cave-in at the
excavation for a sewer at Thirty-fourth
and Downing avenues this evening,
Beveral laborers were buried. The bod
ies of George Holts, C. A. Carlson and
Henry Nelson, have been taken oat.
It is not known how many were in the
trench, but the foreman believes all
are accounted for.
Masons will Celebrate.
Washington, Dec. 6.—Arrangements
are about completed for the Masonic
celebration of the centennial of the
death of Worshipful Master George
Washington, on December 14. Large
numbers of Masons from all over the
United States and from Canada are ex
pected to attend.
Peruvian Cabinet Crisis.
Lima, Peru, Dec. 5., via Galveston.
—Owing to the attitude of the chamber
of deputies, the members of the cabinet
have tendered their resignations to the
president.
Physio Street, Canton, Cain*.
Canton possesses the queerest street
in the world, in spite of the fact that
in nearly all the big towns in China
there are some remarkable streets. The
chief thing of interest attaching to this
eccentric thoroughfart is the fact that
it is roofed in with glazed paper fast
ened on bamboo and contains more
signboards to the square foot than any
other street in any other country. The
next interesting fact about this Can
ton byway is that, though a business
street, it contains no other shops but
those of apothecaries and dentists' par
lors; no professional men but doctors.
It is a sick man's paradise and a Chi
nese physician's Klondike. . They call
it Physic street, which is descriptive if
not picturesque
A New Feature In Western Traxellng.
The Pullman Company now operates
two grades of sleeping cars via the Rio
Grande Western Railway. The ordi
nary sleepers are entirely new, and the
berths, both upper and lower, are fitted
np complete with mattresses, blankets,
sheets, pillowe, curtains, etc., with
stoves arranged for making tea, coffee,
etc., requiring nothing to be furnished
by passengers. Uniformed Pullman
porters are in charge of the cars, who
are requred to keep them in good order
and attend to the wants and comforts
of passengers. The cars are very hand
some and commodious, and while not
bo elegant, are just as comfortable as
standard or palace sleepers. Both first
and second-class passengers are permit
ted to occupy these cars on payment
of the Pullman berth rates, which are
less than half of the rates charged in
the regular Pullman palace sleeping
cars.
The ordinary sleepers are carried
daily on trains via Rio Grande West
ern Railway between Denver and San
Francisco and Portland. On five days
in each week the sleepers are run
through between Los Angeles and San
Francisco, or Portland and Denver,
Omaha, Chicago and Boston.

A typical instance of the effect of a
pension on longevity comes from Lu
ton, where the death has occurred of a
1 man in his 80th year, who enjoyed for
I over half a century an annual allow-
I ance from the war office. He was born
in 1818, in Canada, where his father
was a soldier, and at the age of 8 be
came a drummer boy, subsequently
blossoming into a full-blown private
of a foot regiment. He never did any
fighting, and retired at the age of 30,
with a pension, on accoont of ill
health. A few years later he joined
the Bedford constabulary, and attained
to the rank of sergeant, subsequently
becoming an instructor of fife-and-drum
bands, and holding the post of drum
major in the Luton volunteers.

"How long should mourning gowns

"There is no hard and fast rule," wrote
the religious editor, confidently, "but
