PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Condensed for Busy Readers
His Recommendations In
A Nutshell.
Tlu incssnRe of President Roosevelt,
which may be regarded nsliis valedictory
as President of the United States, beats
all records as to length, containing more
than 30,000 words equal in space to
about thirty columns of Tiik Citizen, if
printed in our ordinary reading matter
tpe. It is however, readable through
out, for those people who have special
interest in govermental affairs, and such
will lind it in full in the bulky daily
papers ; but the mass of the people will
hesitate to burden themselves with the
task of perusing it in its entirety, and for
such we offer its salient points in con
densed form.
Mr. Roosevelt tlrst congratulates the
country on the fact that, during his ad
ministrations, notwithstanding the mill
ions spent on extraordinary projects in
cluding the Panama Canal, the national
debt has been reduced ninety millions of
dollars, and the interest charge cut down
nine millions a year, or about a thous
and dollars an hour.
Corporations, he declares, should be"
under reasonable and linn control, but
he is in favor of the repeal of the Sher
man law, and the allowance of certain
combinations under governmental con
trol. Railroad concerns, employees and
shippers have equal rights, and exact jus
tice most be guaranteed to each.
Interstate telegraph and telephone
lines should be absolutely brought under
the interstate commerce commission.
Unrestrained "individualism" as ex
emplified by captains of finance and in
dustry," and professional and irrespon
sible corporation crushers and wealth
baiters Mr. Roosevelt regards as equally
harmful to the general welfare.
Savings bank insurance, equivalent to
old age pensions, is recommended as
well worthy of study, while stockjobbing
and gambling are roundly denounced.
Federal judges should be paid more
liberal salaries, and Congress is asked to
accept the President's views on this point.
He does not deny that there are bad
judges and deprecates the fact that they
are a menace to the whole structure of
social order and decency, nor does he
fail to condemn judicial hair splitting
and the miscarriage of justice through
legal technicalities ; but he claims that
these Haws in the system furnish no war
rant for wholesale attacks upon the
bench.
Forest waste is a cubject which, as
might be expected, greatly interests the
President, nature lover as he is.' He
shows how China is suffering from the
"appalling desolation" resulting from a
wanton destruction of woodlands, and
declares that we are a nation of fools if
we cannot he brought to realize that the
denudation of the mountains will event
uate in the sweeping out of the Foil of
plains and valleys by Hood, and to know
that "when the soil is gone, men must
go."
Mr. Roosevelt again argues strenuous
ly for a comprehensive, co-ordinated
national system of waterways, but de-'
nounces the foolish, wasteful and futile
expenditures in the ill-advised schemes
which have proved so expensive to the
country.
In discussing the amended law restrict
ing secret service activities, the President
handles Congress without gloves, and
deals out to the members of the House
such a castigation as is without precedent
in the history of the country. He tells
them plainly that the law framed by
them was clearly designed to protect the
"criminals" among themselves, using
the word in its broadest and most of
fensive sense. Then he ironically sug
gests that if the members were really
trying to protect themselves they would
better now make only themselves ex
empt from the detective operations of
the service, and not all the legislative
branches of the government.
Mr. Roosevelt claims that every time
Congress dodges the parcels post prob
lem, the postal savings bank problem
and the government by injunction prob
lem, it finds it much harder to invent ex
cuses for its dereliction.
New Mexico and Arizona, the Presi
dent urges, should be immediately ad
mitted to the Union as new States ; w bile
in behalf of our other dependencies,
Hawaii, he claims, needs harbors ; Porto
Rico, citizenship ; the Philippines a guar
dian, and Cuba another chance at self
government. The Panama canal, he
says, is progressing with"'speed, edlci
ency, and entire devotion to duty on the
part of those in charge of the work, but
no figures relating to cost are given.
Mr. Roosevelt discusses the army, its
condition and needs at considerable
length, suggesting the elimination of
men of "mediocre ability" in the higher
ranks, and declaring that the young of
ficers in the service are able and com
petent. He urges the building of four
more great battleships to form a second
division of a squadron whose first will
be composed of the dreadnaughts North
Dakota, Delaware, Florida and Utah.
Ho denounces the "bureau control" of
the navy and demands that the dead
weight be removed as soon as possible.
On the whole, President Roosevelt's
message is a comprehensive account of
his stewardship, with but little in the
way of suggestions that has not already
been covered in former messages.
Adjustable Farm Gate.
A heavy gate Is very npt.to sag even
If carefully constructed and fairly well
braced. A good plan Is to make an
adjustable brace like that shown In the
illustration. The post B Is mortised
Into the sill A firmly and braced at

cause fog permits tho passage of red

color.

Value of Manure.
While manure may contain only tho
same amount of actual fertilizing con
stituents as a given amount of com
mercial fertilizer, Us benefit to the soil
Is sometimes much greater owing to
Its addition of humus. When manure
Is Incorporated with a soli It greatly
improves the texture, loosening a
heavy, compact soil and binding to
gether a light, leachy one, making the
soil more friable, warmer, more re
tentive of molBture and more congenial
to plants In every way.
Some experiments conducted by Pro
fessor King nt the Wisconsin agricul
tural experiment station showed that
certain manured land contained eight
een tons more water per aero In tho
upper foot of soli than similar land
unnianured and thirty-four tons more
In the soil to a depth of three feet.
Manure exerts a quicker beneficial in
fluence on the texture of soils than
green manures. He concludes that
manures will also aid in equalizing the
supply and distribution of water In the
soils, that they will exert a material
influence In making soils warmer and
that manured land Is less subject to
the denuding effects of wind and rain.
