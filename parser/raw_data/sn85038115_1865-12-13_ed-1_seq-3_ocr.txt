an impartial decision. I regret to inform
you that Great Britain declined the ar
bitrament, but, on the other hand, invit
ed ua to the formation of a joint coni-
Siaaion to settle mutual claims between
a two countries, from which those for
the depredations before mentioned should
be excluded. The proposition, in that
very unsatisfactory manner; has been de
clined. The United States did not present the
subject as an impeachment of the good
faith of a flower wluoh was professing
tha moat friendly dispositions, but as in
volving question of public-law, of hich
the settlement is essential to the peace
of nations, and, though pecuniary repa
ration to their injured citizens would
hare followed incidentally on a decision
against Jreat Britain, streh oemjiensation
w.aa nt their primary objeet. They had
a higber motive, and it was in the inter
ests of peace'and jtftftiee to establish im
peetaa principles o iateraational hrw.
e,'orrepondenco will be placed before
5au. i?he ground, on which the British
MimstBr rests his justification is, sub
stantially, that the municipal law of a
tfWirj,-TT& the domestic interpretations
ifthm kvsf, vtd th measures-of its duty
as a neutral; and I feel bound to. declare
nay opinion before you and before the
World, that that justification cannot be
sustained before the tribunal of nations.
At she same time I do not advise to any
BWek erapt at redress by acts of leg
islation. Fe the "future, friendship bp
tween the two cobntries must Vest on the
basis of mutual justice.
From the moment of the establish
ment of our free Constitutions, -the civ
il Used VorloY has been convulsed by rev
olutions in the interests of democracy or
of monocracy; but through all those rev
olutions the United States- -have wisely
and Jirmly refused to become propagan

IPliea Oti'tBe ttrganrtsatiofa of our Govern -Mtrt,
under th'Goaafeitaticn, the Prssident
eft tnttSeibad'State delivered his Inaugural
Address to the two Houses of Congress, he
gid,4 them, and through them to- the coun
try, and to mankind, that, "the preservation
ofthe sacred fire of liberty and the destiny
of the Republican model of Government are
justly conafEted JUT deeply, parjraps as final
ly, staked on the experiment intrusted to the
American people." And the House of Rep
resentatives answered Washington, through
the voice of Afadisbn:, "We adore the invisi
ble hand which has led thB American people
through bo many difficulties, to cherish a con
scious responsibility for the destiny of Amer
ican liberty." More than seventy, sis' years
glided away Since those words were spoken;
the united States have passed through severer
trials than were foreseen, and new, at this
new epoch in our existence as one nation, with
eur Union purVffesi, llyjeosrows, and strength
ened by conflict, and established by the vir
tue of the people, the greatness of the oeea-
lemnity the pledges of our fathers to hold
ourselves answerable before onr fellow men
for the success of the Republican form of
Government. Experience has proved its suf
ficiency in peace and in war; it has vindicated
its authority through distress and afflictions,
and sudden and terrible emergencies, which
would have crushed any system that had
been teas firmly fixed in the hearts of the
people, At. the inauguration of Washington,
the foreign relations of the country were few,
and its trade was repressed by hostile regula
tions; now all the civilized nations of the
globe welcome our commerce, and their gov
ernments profess toward us amity. Thenoui
country felt its way hesitatingly along an un
tried path, with States so little bound to
gether by rapid means of communication as
to be hardly known to one another, and with
historic traditions extending over Very few
years; now intercourse between the States is
swift and intimate; the experience of centu
ries has been crowded into a few. generations,
and has created an intense indestructible na
tionality. Then our jurisdiction did not ex
tend beyond the inconvenient boundaries of
the territory which had aouieved independ
ence; now, through cessions of lands, first
colonized by Spain and France, the country
has acquired a more complex character, and
has for its natural limits the chain of Lakes,
the Gulf of Mexioo, and on the east and west
the tjnc great Oceans. Other nations were
wasted bv civil wars for ages before they oo'd
establish for themselves the necessary degree
of unity; the latent conviction that our form
of government is the best ever known to the
world, has enabled us to emerge from civil
war within four years, with a complete vindi
cation of the Constitutional authority of the
General Government, and with our local lib
erties add tate institutions unimpaired.
The throngs of emigrants that crowd to our
shores are witnesses of the confidence of all
people in our permanence. Hera la the great
land pi tee labor, where industry is blessed
with unexampled re ward t5, and the bread of
the working man is sweetened by the con
sciousness that the cause of his country "is
his own cause, his own safety, his own digni
ty." Here every one enjoys the free use of
his faculties and the choice of activity as a
natural right, Here, under the combined in
fluence of a fruitful soil, genial climes, and
happy institutions, population has inoreased
fifteen-fold within a century, Here, through
the easy development of boundless resources,
wealth has increased with two-fold greater
rapidity than numbers, so that we have be
come secure against the financial vicissitudes
of other countries, and, alike in business and
in opinion, ate self centered and truly inde
pendent. Here, more and hi ore care is given
to provide education for every one born on
eur soil, Here religion, released from polit
ical oonneotion with the civil government. re
fuses to subserve the craft of statesmen, and
becomes, 'in its independence, the spiritual
life of the people. Here toleration is exten
ded to every opinion, in the quiet certainty
that truth needs only a fair field to secure the
victory. Here the human mind goes forth
unshackled in the pursuit of science, to ool
leot stores of knowledge and acquire an ever
increasing mastery over the forces of nature.
Here the national domain is offered and.held
in millions of separate freeholds, so that our
fellow citisens, beyond the occupants of any
other part of the each, constitute in reality a
people. Here exists the democratic form of
government; and that form of government, by
the confession of European statesmen, "gives
a power of which no other form is capable,
because it incorporates every man with the
State, and arouses everything that belongs to
the soul."
Where, in past history ,does a parallel exist
to the publio happiness which is within the
reach of the people of the United States?
Where, in any part of the globe, can institu
tions be found so Suited to their habits or so
entitled t their love as their own free Con
stitution? Every one of them, then, in
whatever part of the land he has his home,
must wish its perpetuity. Who of them will
not bow acknowledge, in the words of Wash
ington, that "every step by which the people
of the United States have advanced to the
character of an independent nation, seems to
have been distinguished by some token of
Providential agency." Who will not join
with me in the prayer, that the invisible hand
hioh has led us thtough the clouds that
gloomed around our path, will so guide us
onward to a perfect restoration of fraternal
affection, that we of this day may be able to
transmit our great inheritance, of State Gov
ernments in ail their rights, 0f the General
Government in all its Constitutional vigor' to
our posterity, and they to theirs, through
countless generations?

THE SPIRIT OF DEMOCRACY.
Woodsfield, Dec. 13, 1865.
Monroe Co. Agricultural Society
An Appeal ?or Aid. The Monroe
Cbunty Agricultural Soeiety is in debt
to the amount of about $1,250, and tbe
creditors are demanding payment. The
principal part of this debt was incurred
for rent, fences and buildings, and tbe
obligations are in tbe bands of VV. Askew,
at St. Clairsville,and Tallant & Dclaplain,
at Wheeling.
There are but two courses to pursue:
One is to fold onr hands and sit idly by,
and let all the property be sold; the other
is to exhibit a little enterprise, raise the
money, pay the debt, and set the institu
tion on a permanent foundation. Once
out of debt the institution will be self
sustaining. It can hardly be necessary to urge the
importance of pavine off this debt. If
a ev w
the people of this county, and especially
the farmers, do net feel interest and coun
ty pride enough to contribute this money;
it is to be hoped nobody will ever tell out
of this conntv why we hare no more
Fairs.
Tbe Board of Directors has apportion
ed the amount to be raised among tbe
several townships, and appointed collec
tors, as follows:
