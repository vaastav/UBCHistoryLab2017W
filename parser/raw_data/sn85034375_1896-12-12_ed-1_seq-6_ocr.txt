The Late Elections.
e Congress or the United States—

my
At the outset of a reference to the more im
portant matters affecting our relations with
foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction
if I could assure congress that the disturbed
condition in Asiatic Turkey had < uring the
past year assumed a less hideous and bloody
aspect, and that either as a consequence of
the awakening of the Turkish government to
the demands of humane civilization, or as the
suit of decisive action on the part of the
great nations having the right, by treaty, to
Interfere for the protection of those exposed
to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanati
clsm, the shocking features of the situation
had been mitigated.
Instead. however, of welcoming a softened
disposition or positive intervention, we have
been afflicted by confirmed and not unfrequent
and the bloody butchering of men, women and
children, made martyrs to their profession of
Christian faith. While none of our citizens in
Turkey ha\e thus far been killed or wounded.
though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of
danger, their safety iu the future is by no
zneans assured. Our government at home aud

least from $3 *.000,000 to $50.000,<U* of American
capital Are invested'in plantations and in rail

on the island. The volume of trade between

to nearly $06,000,000. Besides this large pecu
niary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United
States findit itself Inextricably involved in the
present contest in other ways, both vexatious
and costly.
Many Cubans reside in this country, and in
directly promote tbe insurrection through the
press, by public meetings, by tbe purchase
and shipment of arms, by tbe raising of funds,
and by other means, which the spirit of our
institutions and tbe tenor of our laws do not

of a friendly power. It follows from the same
causes that the United Stutes is compelled
actively police a long line of
unlawful expeditions, the escape of which the
utmost vigilance will not always suffice to pre
vent. These inevitable entanglements of tho
United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the
large American property interests affected,
and considerations of philanthropy and hu
manity in general, have led to a vehement de
mand in various quarters for some sort
positive intervention on the part of the United
States.
It was at first proposed that belligerent
rights should be accorded to the insurgents—a
proposition no longer urged, because untimely
and Impractical in operation and clearly pe
ous and injurious to our own interests. It:

has
been and is now sometimes contended that the
lndepend^ice of the insurgents should be rec
ognized. But imperfect and restricted as the
Spanish government of the Island may he,
other exists there—unless the will of the mili
tary officer in temporary command of a par
ticular district can be dignified as a species of
government. It is now also suggested that the
United States should buy the island—a sug
gestion possibly worthy of consideration if
there were any evidence of a desire or wi 11
ingness on the part of Spain to entertain such
0 proposal. It is urged, finally, that all other
methods falling, the existing internecine strife
in Cuba should be terminated by our interven
at the cost of a war between the
United States and Spain—a war which its ad
vocates confidently prophesy could be neither
large in its proportions nor doubtful In its is
sue. The correctness of this forecast need be
neither affirmed nor denied. The United
States has. nevertheless, a character to main
tain as a nation, which plainly dictates that
right and not might should be the rule of its
conduct.
Further, though the United States Is not a
nation to which pence is a necessity, it is in
truth the most pacific* of powers, and desires
nothing so much as to live in amity with all
the world. Its own ample and diversified do
mains satisfy all possible longings for terri
tory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and pre
I vent any casting of covetous eye upon neigh
boring regions however attractive. That our
conduct towards Spain and her dominions has
constituted no exception to this national dis
position Is made manifest by the course of our
government, not only thus far during the pres
ent insurrection, but during the ten years that
followed the rising at Y
No other great power, it may safely be said,
der circumstances of similar perplexity,
would have manifested the same restraint and
the same patient endurance. It may also be
said that this persistent attitude ot the United
States toward Spain in connection with Cuba
will unquestionably evince no slight respect
and regard for Spain on the part of the Amer
lean people. They, in truth, do not forget her
connection with the discovery of the western
hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the
great qualities of the Spanish people, nor fail
to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and
their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.
They view with wonder and admiration the
cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of
sent across thousands of miles of
ocean and an enormous debt accumulated, that
the costly possession of the Gem of the An
tilles may still hold its place in the Spanish
crown, and yet neither the government nor the
people of the United States have shut their
eyes to the course of events In Cuba or have
failed to realize the existence of conceded
the present re
volt from the authority of Spain—grievances
recognized by the queen regent and by
the cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and
enlightened of Spanish statesmen without
regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms
proposed by the executive and approved by the
legislative branch of the Spanish government.
It is in the assumed temner and disposition of
the Spanish government to remedy these griev
ances. fortified by Indications of Influential
public opinion in Spain, that this government
has hoped to discover the most promising and
effective means of composing the present strife,
with honor and advantage to Spain, with the
achievement of all the reasonable objects of
the Insurrection.
It would seem that If Spain should offer to
Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home
rule which, while preserving the sovereignty
of Spain, would satisfy all rational rcquire
menta of her Spanish subjects, there should be
no just reason why the pacification of the is
land might not be effected on that basis. Such
result would appear to be in the interest nf
a u concerned. It would at once stop the con
flj Ct which is now consuming the resources of
the island and making it worthless for whlch
ever party may ultimately prevail. It
would keep intact the possessions of
rithout touching her honor, which
will be consulted rather than Impugned by
the adequate redress of admitted grievances.
Id put the prosperity of the island and
the fortunes of its inhabitants within their
■ithout severing the natural and
ancient ties which bind them to the mother
country, and would yet enable them to test
their capacity for self-government under the
most favorable conditions.
It has been objected, on the one side, that
Spain should not promise autonomy until her
insurgent subjects lay down their arms. On
the other side, that promised autonomy, how
ever liberal, is insufficient, because without
ranee of the promise being fulfilled.
But the reasonableness of a requirement by
Spain of unconditional surrender on the part
of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy
is conceded is not altogether apparent
It ignores imnortant features of the situation
— the stability two years' duration has given
to the insurrection: the feasibility of its In

and imminent ruin of the island, unless the

the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all

d es ire to remove.
Facing such circumstances, to withhold the
profer of needed reforms until the parties
demanding them put themselves at merev by
throwing down tlielr arms, has the appearance
r .f neglecting the gravest of perils and invit
j ntf suspicion as to the sincerity of any pro
fussed willingness to grunt reforms,
The objection on behalf of the insurgents
- -that promised reforms can not be relied upon
.-must, of course, be considered, though we
have no right to assume, and no reason for a^
sumtng. that anything that Spain undertakes
to do for tbe relief of Cuba will not be done uc
cording to both the spirit and the letter of the
undertaking.
Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and
precautions on the part of the weaker of two
combatants are always natural and not always
unjustifiable, and being sincerely desirous in
the interest of both as well as on its own ac
count that the Cuban problem should be solved
with the least possible delay. It was Intimated
by this government to the government of
Spain some months ago that, If a satisfactory
measure of home rule were tendered the Cu
p au insurgents and would be accepted by
them upon a guaranty of Its execution, the
United .States would endeavor to find a wav
not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such
guaranty "
While
concede to exist and profess a
definite response to this Intimation
has yet been received irom the Spanish gov
ernment. it is believed to be not altogether
welcome, while, as a treaty is suggested, no
reason is perceived why it should not be ap
proved by the Insurgents. Neither party can
fail to see the importance of early action, and
both must realize that to prolong the present
state of things for even a short period will add
rmously to the time and labor and expendi
ture necessary to bring about the industrial
recuperation of the Island. It is, there
fore, fervently hoped on all grounds
that earnest efforts for healing the
breach between Spain aud the insurgent Cu
bans, upon the line* above indicated, mav be
i inaugurated and pushed to un Imme
diate and successful issue. The friendly of
fices of the United States, either in the man
above outlined, or in any other way con
sistent with our constitution and laws, will al
wavs be al the disposal of either party.
Whatever circumstances may arise, our pol
icy und our interests would constrain us to ob
ject to the acquisition of the island or the in
terference with its control by any other
power.
It should be added that it can not be rcason
ablp assumed that tbo hitherto ezpectaut au
titude of the United States will be indefinitely
maintained While we are anxious to accord
aii due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we
can not view the pending conflict in all its
features and propei fy apprehend our inevitable
relations to it. and possible results, without
considering that, by the course of events, we
may be drawn into such an unusual and un
precedented condition as will fix a limit to our
patient walting-for Sppln to end the contest,
either alone and in her own way, or with our
friendly co-operation.
Wheu the inability of Spain to deal success
fully with the insurrection has become mani
fest, sad it is demonstrated that her sover
eignty Is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its
rightful existence, and wflgn a hopeless strug
gle for Its re-establishment has degenerated
Into a strife which mesas nothing more than

which our obligation to the sovereignty
Spain will be superceded by higher obligstiond
by which we can hardly hesitate to recognise
and discharge.
Deferring the choice of ways and methods
until the time for action arrives,
make them depend upon the precise conditions
then existing; and they should not be deter
mined upon without giving careful heed to
eveiy consideration involving our honor and
Interest, or the international duty we owe to
Spain. Until we face the contingencies sug
gested or the situation is by other incidents
imperatively changed, we should continue iu
the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in
all circumstances exhibiting our obedience to
the requirements of public law and our regard
for the duty enjoined upon us by the position
we occupy in the family of nations.
A contemplation of emergencies that may
arise should plainly lead us to avoid their
creatiou, either through a careless disregard of
i iresent duty or even un undue stimulation and
11-tlmed expression of feeling. Hut I have
deemed it not amiss to remind the congress
that a time may arrive when a correct policy

for the interests of other nations and their
citizens, joined by considerations of humanity

Oar Coast Defens#*
I).'ring the past year rapid progress has been
mads toward the completion of the scheme
adopted for the erection and armament
fortifications along our sea coast, while equal
progress hoc* been made in providing the ma
terial for sVbiagrine defense In connection
with theee works.
This Improved situation la largely due to the
recent geuerous response of congress to tbe
recommendations of the war department.
Thus we shall soon have complete about
fifth of the comprehensive system, the first
step in which was noted in my message to tbe
congress of December 4,1893.
The experience and result of the past year
demonstrate that with a continuation of pres
ent careful methods the cost of the remaining
work will be much less than the original esti
mate. We should always keep in mind that of
all forms of military preparation coast de
fense alone is essentially pacific In Its nature.
While It gives the sense of security due to a
consciousness of strength, it is neither the
purpose nor the efTect of such permanent forti
fication to involve us in
llcatlons, but
rutlier to guarantee us against them. They are
no temptation to war, but security against It.
Thus they are thoroughly in accord with all
the traditions of our national diplomacy.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.
Government Penitentiaries.
The attorney general presents a detailed and
interesting statement of tbe important work
done under his supervision during the last
fiscal year. The ownership and management
by the government of penitentiaries for the
confinement of the convicted in United States
courts of violations of federal laws, which for
many years has been a subject of executive
'ommendation. has at last, to a slight ex
tent, been realized by the utilization of
tbe abandoned military prison at Fort
Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary.
This is certainly a movement In the right
direction; but it ought to be at once supple
mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge
ment of this improvished prison, and the con
struction of at least one more, to be located in
the southern states.
Th« New Salary System.
It is most gratifying to note the satisfactory
results that have followed the Inauguration of
tbe new system provided for by the act of
May 28. 1896. under which certain federal offi
cials are compensated by salaries instead of
fees. The new plan was put
the first day of July. 1896, and already
great economy it enforces, its prevention of
abuies and its tendency to a better enforce
ment of the laws are strikingly apparent. De
tailed evidence of the usefulness of this long
delayed bpt now happily-accomplished re
form will he found clearly set forth lu the at
torney general's report.

TOST OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
Its Operations During the Past Year.
Our post office department Is in good condi
tion and the exhibit made of its operations
during the fiscal year, ended Juno
allowance is made for imperfections in the
laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory. The
total receipts during the year were $82.499,V08. -
40. The total expenditures were $90,626,206.84,
exclusive of $1,559,898.27, which was earned by
tbe Pacific railroad for transportation, and
credited on their debt to the government.
There was an Inerease of receipts over the
previous year of $6,516,080.21.
per cent., and an increase of expendi
ture of $3,830,124.02, or 4.42 per cent.
The deficit was $1,679,956.10 less than that of
the preceding year.
7.1
Abuse of the Service.
The transmission at the rate of one cent a
pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets,
'•house organs" (periodicals advertising some
paitlcular ''house" or institution), sample
copies, and the like, ought certainly to be dis
continued. A glance at the revenues received
for the work done last year will show more
plainly than any other statement the gross
abuse of the postal service and the growing
waste of its earnings.
The free matter carried in the mails for the
departments, offices, etc., of the government
and for congress in pounds amount to 94.48U,
Corrective Leglslatl
If such second-class matter paid merely the
cost of its handling our deficit would disappear
d a surplus result, which might be used to
give the people still better mail facilities or
cheaper rates of letter postage. I recommend
that legislation be at
these abuses and introduce better business
ideas in the regulation of our postal rates.

THE NAVY DEPARTMENT,
Construction of Our New Navy.
The work of the navy department and Its
present conditions are fully exhibited in tbe
report of the secretary. The construction of
vessels for our new navy has been energetic
ally prosecuted by the present administration
upon the general lines previously adopted, the
department having seen no necessity for radi
cal changes in prior methods under which the
work was found to be progressing in a manner
highly satisfactory. It has been decided, how
ever, to provide in every ship-building con
tract that the builder should pay all trial ex
penses, and it has also been determined to pay
speed premiums in future contracts.
The premiums recently earned and some yet
i be decided are features of tne contracts
made before this conclusion was reached.
On March 4,1893, there were in commission
but two armored vessels, the double-turreted
monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since
that date, of vessels (theretofore authorized,
there have been placed in their first commis
sion three first-class and two second-class bat
tleships, two armored cruisers, one
harbor-defense rani. and five double
turreted monitors, including the Maine
and tbe Puritan. just completed.
Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new
unboats have also been commissioned. The
own. another battleship, will be completed
about March 1, and ut least four more gunboats
will be ready for sea in the early spring.
to
The War Collage.
The war college has developed into an insti
tution which it is believed will be of great
value to tbe navy, in teaching the science of
war as well as in stimulating professional zeal
in the navy, und it will be especially useful in
the devising of plans for the utilization, in
case of necessity, of all the naval resources of
the United States. The secretary has per
sistently adhered to the plan he found in oper
ation for securing labor at navy yards, through
boards of labor employment, and has done
much to make it more complete and efficient
Discipline lu the Service.
Discipline among the officers and men of the
navy has been maintained to a high standard,
and the percentage of American citizens en
listed has been very much increased.
The secretary la considering, and will formu
late during the coming winter, a plan for lay
ing up ships in reserve, thereby largely reduc
ing the cost of maintaining tmr vessels afloat.
The Naval Militia.
Tbe naval militia, which wa$ authorized a
few years ago, as an experiment, has now de
veloped into a body of enterprlalng young
men, active ar.d energetic in the discharge of
their duties, and promising great Useful
ness. T his establishment has nearly the same
relation to our navy as the national guard in
the different states bears to our army; and it
constitutes a source of supply for our naval
forces, the importance of which is immediate
apparent.

of
Our Indian Wards,
The total Indian population of the United*
States is 177,285, according to a census made
1803, exclusive of those within tbe state
New York and those comprising the five civil
ized tribes. Of this number there are approx
imately 38 000 children of school age. During
the year 23.398 of these were enrolled and may
be in schools. The progress which has attend
ed recent efforts to extend Indian school facil
ities, and the anticipation of continued liberal
appropriates to that end, can not fail
afford the utmost satisfaction to those who be
lieve that the education of Indian children
a prime factor in the accomplishment of In
dian civilization.
Tho f ive Civilised Tribes.
The condition of affairs among the five civil
ized tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in
the Indian territory, and who have govern
ments of their own, has assumed such an as
pect as to render it almost Indespensable that
there should be
entlre change in the rela
tions of these Indians to the general govern
ment. This seems to be necessary In further
ance of their own Interests, as well as for the
protection of non-Indian residents in their ter
ritory. A commission organized and
powered under several recent laws is now
gotiating with these Indians for the
relinquishment of their courts and the di
vision of their common lands in severalty,
and are aiding in the settlement of the trouble
some ; question of tribal membership. The
reception of their first proffers of negotiation
was not encouraging, but through patience and
such conduct on their part as demonstrated
that their intentions were friendly, and in the
interest of the tribes, the prospect of success
has become more promising.
Utah GUsonlte Deposits.
It appears that a very valuable deposit of
gilsonite or asphaltum has been found on the
reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncom
paghre Ute Indians. Every consideration of
care for the public interest, and every sensible
business reason, dictate such management or
disposal of this important source of publio
revenue as will except it from the general
rules and incidents attending the ordinary dis
position of public lands and secure to the gov
ernment a fair share, at least, of its advantages
in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to in
terested Individualism.
A Permanent Indian Comminlon.
I indorse the recommendation made by the
E resent secretary of the interior, as well
is predecessor, that a permanent commission,
consisting of three members, one of whom
shall be an army officer, be created to perform
the duties now devolving upon the commis
sioner and assistant commissioner of Indian
affairs.

The Pension Boll.
The diminution of our enormous pension roll
and the decrease of pension expenditure which
have been so often confidently foretold still fall
In material realization. The number of pen
sioners on the roll at the close of the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is
tbe largest number ever reported. Tbe amount
paid exclusively for pensions during the year
was 1138.214,761.91, a slight decrease from that
of the preceding year, while the total expendi
tures on account of pensions, including the
cost of maintaining the department and
expenses attending
amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within a very
small fraction of one-third of the entire ex
pense of supporting the government during
the same year. The number of new pension
certificates Issued was 90.640. Of these 40,374
represent original allowance of claims, and 16 ,
878 increases of exisiting pensions. The num
ber of persons receiving
United States,but residing
at the close of the last fiscal year, was 3,781
and the amount paid to them during the year
was $582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the
payment of pensions for tho current fiscal
year, ending June :0, 1897. is $140,000,000, and
for tbe succeeding year it is estimated that the
same amount will be necessary.
The commissioner of pensions reports that
during the last fiscal year 33.* Indictments were
found against violators of the pension laws.
Upon these indictments 167 convictions re
sulted.

Pacific Railroad Obligations.
The secretary calls attention to the public
interests involved in an adjustment of the ob
ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern
ment. I deem it to be an important duty to
especially present this subject to the oonstder
tlon of the congress.
Under section 4 of the act of congress passed
March 3,1887, the president is charged with
the duty in the event that any mortgage or
other incumbrance paramount to the interest
of the United States in tho property of the
Pacific railroads shall exist and
lawfully
liable to be foreclosed, to direct the action of
the departments of the treasury and of justice
in the protection of the Interest of the United
Stutes by redemption or through judicial pro
ceedings, including foreclosures of the gov
ernment ileus. In view of the fact that the
congress has for a number of years almost
constantly had under consideration various
pians for dealing with the conditions existing
between these roads and the government, I
have thus far felt justified in withholding ac
tion under the statute above mentioned.
An Urgent Situation.
In the case of the Union Pacific company,
however, the case has become especially and
immediately urgent. Proceedings have been
instituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon
these aided parts of the main linos upon
which the government bolds a second and
subordinate mortgage lien. In consequence of
these proceedings and Increasing complica
tions, added to the default occurring on the
first day of January, 1597. a condition will be
presented ut that date, so far as this company
is concerned, that must emphasize the man
date of the act of 1887 and give to executive
duty under its provisions a more important
uspect. N
Therefore, unless congress shall otherwise
direct or shall have previously determined
upon a different solution of the problem there
will hardy appear to exist any reason for de
laying, beyond tbe date of the defuult above
mentioned, such executive action as will prom
ise to subserve the public interests and save
the government from the loss threatened by
further inactiou.

From a small beginning it has grown to be
the center of agricultural intelligence and the
source of aid and encouragement to agricul
tural efforts. Large sums of money are an
nually appropriated for the maintenance of
this department, aud it must be confessed that
the legislation relating to it has always been
directed iu tbe Interest of practical farming or
properly guarded against waste and extrava
gance. So far, however, as publio money
been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help
those who actually till the soil, no expenditure
has beeu more profitably made
ally approved by the people.
Exports of Farm Products.

The secretary reports that the value of our
exports of farm products during the last fiscal
year amounted to $570,000,000, an increase of
$17,000,000 over those of the year immediately
preceding.
This statement is not the lers welcome be
cause of the fact that, notwithstanding such in
crease, the proportion of exported agricultural
products to our total exports of ail descrip
tions fell off during the year. The benefits of
~r. increase in agricultural produots being as
sured, the decrease in its proportion to our
total export is the more gratifying when we
oonsider that it is owing to the fact that sueh
total exports for the year Increased more than

THE TARIFF QUESTION.
Baiieitlona Touching the Present
and It* Operations.
I desire to recur to the statements elsewh.—

and expenditures for the purpose of venturFn.

tariff law audita operation. * preseni
This Statute took effect on the »th „#

Those who Insist that the cost to our pconle

meet any such deficit in the treasury, in addi

ment of the expenses of the government, ami
which must, unless expended for that purpose
remain a useless hoard; or. U not extravagant
ly wasted, must in any event be perverted from
the purpose of its exaction from our people
The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in
the revenue from this fund is nothing more
than its proper and legitimate use.
A Matter of Supreme Importance.
I suppose it will not be denied that under
the present law our people obtain the neces
saries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper
rate than formerly. This is a matter of supreme
importance, since it is the palpable duty or
every just government to make the burdens of
taxation as light as possible. The people
should not be required to relinquish this
privilege of cheaper living except under tho
stress of their government's necessity made
plainly manifest.
OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.
Weakness and Vices of Oar Present
Met It od.
This reference to the conditions and pros
pects of our revenues naturally suggests
allusion to the weakness and vices of
clal method.
fiuan
Tbey have been frequently
pressed upon the attention of congress iu
previous communications and the inevitable
danger of their continued toleration pointed
out Without now repeating these details, I
can not refrain from again earnestly present
ing the necessity of the prompt reform of a
system opposed to every rule of sound finance
and shown by experience to be fraught with
the gravest peril aud perplexity.
Withdrawals of Gold Obligations.
Because we may be enjoying a temporary re
lief from its depressing influence, this should
not lull us Into a false security, nor lead us to
forget the suddenness of past visitations. I
more convinced than ever that w
have
assured financial peace and safety until the
government currency obligations upon which
gold may be demanded from the treasury are
withdrawn from circulation and cancelled.
This might be done, as has been heretofore
recommended, by their exchange for long
term bonds bearing a low rate of interest
by their redemption with the proceeds of such
bonds.
This plan of Issuing bonds for the purpose of
redemption certainly appears to be the most
effective and direct path to the needed reform.
In default of this, however, it would be a step
the right direction if currency obligations,
redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed,
should be cancelled instead of reissued. This
operation would be a slow remedy, but it would
improve present conditions.
National Bank Notes.
National banks should redeem their own
notes. They should be allowed to Issue circu
lation to the par value of bonds deposited as
security for redemption, and the tax
circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of
one percent.
In considering projects for the retirement of
the United States notes and treasury notes is
sued under the new law of 1890,1 am of the
opinion we have placed too much stress upon
the danger of contracting the currency and
have calculated too little upon the gold that
would be added to our circulation if Invited
us by better and safer financial methods. It is
not so much contraction of our currency that
should be avoided as its unequal distribution.
The entire case may be presented by the
statement that the day of sensible and sound
financial methods will not dawn upon us until
our government abandons the banking busi
ness and the accumulation of funds, and
fines Its monetary operations to the receipt of
the money contributed by the people for its
support, and tbe expenditure of such money

MONOPOLY.
Trust* and Other Aggregations of Capital.
Another toplo in which our people rightfully
take a deep interest may be here briefly con
sidered. t refer to the existence of trusts and
other huge aggregations of capital, the object
of which is to secure the monopoly of some
particular branch of trade, industry
merce, and to stifle wholesome competition.
When these are defended it is usually on the
ground that, though they increase prices, they
also reduce prices, and thus may benefit the •
publio. It muet be remembered, however, that
reduotlon of prices to the people is not one of
the real objects of these organizations, nor is
their tendency necessarily In that direction.
If it occurs in a particular case it is only be
cause It accords with the purposes or interests
of those managing the ioheme.
Though congress has attemped to deal with
this matter by legislation, the laws passed for
that purpose thus far have proved ineffective,
not beoause of any lack of disposition or at
tempt to enforce them, but simply because tbe
laws themselvps, as interpreted by the courts,
do not reach the dlffloulty. It the Insufficiencies
of existing laws can be remedied by (further
legislation, It nhould be done.
An Appeal for Economy.
In ooncluding this communication. Its last
words shall be an appeal to the congress for
tbe moat rigid eoonomy in the expenditure of
tbe money it holds In trust for the people.
The way to perplexing extravagance la easy,
but a return to frugality ie difficult. Whan,
however, it fa considered that those who beer
the burdens of taxation bave guaranty of
honest eare aave In the fidelity of their pub
lic servants, the duty of all possible retrench
ment le plainly manifest
When our dllferenoea are forgotten, and our
contests of politloal opinion are no longer re
