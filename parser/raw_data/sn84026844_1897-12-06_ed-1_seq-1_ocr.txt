your choice. Many predict that adjournment
will be ordered by May 1, "but most
of those who have spoken think differently.
And It will not be surprising If
the .-essIon lasts until July, it is not beved
that special financial legislation
will bo attempted.
The argument Is advanced *h'at n? the

it will be useless to introduce
a measure looking to a reform of the

Klnley has passed the fourth day of
her Illness, and enters upon the fourth
i night with the spark of life still burni
ing dimly. There has not been a material
development in her case to-day.
Her condition has continued one of
steadily wasting away, the constitution
growing* weaker hour, by hour under
the assault of the disease. Tim family

pared for the end at any moment, and
6<ome time feeling that It hud come,
1 as the patient was seized with sinking
1 spells, such as they yesterday mistook
I for u second stroke of paralysis. Dur;
Ing these attacks she would perceptibly
weaken, almost cease to breathe, nnd
show scarcely a slffn of animation.
, For the most part these spells were
i limited to half an hour, nnd when (hey
wer over ahe would resume the quite
i repose characteristic of the entire 111|
ness. About the middle of the afternoon,
however, a more serious slnkinw
, spell occurred and lasted for two
hours. Several times those keeping the
vigil thought the last flutter o{ life's
i flame had gone. The attack passed
away at last, leaving the patient al,
most the same as before Jt occurred.
There is still a possibility that she
may survive the night, or even longer,
but those who have been at the bedside
most constantly have the least hope of
such a result. They have seen the patient
weaken so steadily that they cannot
hope that she will much longer endure.
Communication was established
with this ivhlrc house as soon as the
President arrived there this morning,
and a telegraph wire is constantly open
to Washington to advise the President
of every occurrence In the sick room.
Besides this he has several times talked
with his brother Abncr by telephone.

nothing particularly new. There
had been no notable change In the patlent
during the day. She had contln1
ued to grow worse In the same manrfer
nt about the same rate as during tin'
* past few days. Tie was satlBfled that
[ ihls condldtlon would prevail to the
. end. Asked as to the prospects of her
I uurviving the night, he said:
"Yes, there Is a possibility of her living
until morning. Indeed. I am inclined
to think that she will. I3ut she
j has been weakening so long that no one
, can make a prediction for the future
, with any assurance ot certainty. The
, case Is one In which we must be pre,
pared for <he end at any. moment.
When the end conies. It will merely be
. the passage out of the comatose condl.
tlon In which she now rests to the sleep
I of death. There will be no rally, no
more conscious periods, no final strugi
gle."

At fl:4D o'clock p. m. Dr. Phillips left

Klrkland, of Brooklyn, who was
fifty years his Junior. To-day Parkhlll
committed suicide at his homo In Brooklyn
by shooting himself through the
brain wPH a revolver.
When the couple wore married the *
families of both parties objected strongly
to the tie on account of the disparity,
.lu their ages. Tho couple were forced
to separate and since that time Parkhlll
has appeared somewhat depressed. Ho
lived with his married daughter and
son. and when the family were at church
to-day ho shut himself. Ho was found
on tho return of his relatives from
church. His relatives give no reason
