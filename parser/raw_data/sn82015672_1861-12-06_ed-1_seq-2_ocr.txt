8onthern News.
From onr Exchanges we condense the
following items, as giving a fair summary of
the condition of affairs in the South:
It is evident from articles in all the
Southern papers that the Confederates de
sign making their groat defense of the lower
country bordering on the Mississippi river
at Columbus, Ky. The Legislature of Mis
sissippi have appropriated $75,000 for the
purpose of raising 1 0,000 men for thirty
days, to be stationed at that point. Thirty
days troops are also being raised at New
Orleans, and all the available gun boats at
that point have been dispatched, under the
command of the great Rollins, to that
point. Notwithstanding the immense force
already concentrated there, they are yet
fearful of nn immediate attack. Every ex
cuse is manufactured for the purpose of
sending a boat with a flag of trnco to Cairo,
in order to ascertain what onr forces are
about, and whether they are nearly ready
to move down the river. General Grant
has become so disgusted with this impu
dence that he will soon object to the recep
tion of flags of truce on any account. Many
rebels come up the river under the pretenBe
of a desire to report themselves at St. Louis
for the purpose of being exebauged. If
permitted to pass through our lines, they
glean what information they can, both at
Cairo and St. Louis, and then return and
thoroughly post the rebel leaders as to our
movements. We think with Gen. Grant,
it is high time this thing was stopped.
Our exchanges speak of an expedition
which left Shawneetown and Paducah for
Casey ville. It accomplished nothing besides
some of our soldiers getting disgracefully
drunk and insubordinate, and the capture
of about eighty fat hogs. No rebel force
was at Casey ville, the small body of cavalry
which were there the day previous having
retired into the interior.
Contraband goods, in large quantities, are
constantly passiug through Caseyville, and
a force for the purpose of blockade ought to
be stationed there permanently.
The Pink Varble, which passed our city
a couple of weeks ago, under a permit from
Secretary Chose, loaded with machinery for
McMinnvillc, Tenn., has been seized by the
rebels as contraband, and the crew im
prisoned. The cargo and boat will, we
presume, be confiscated. Our citizens wero
quite indignant that a permit should have
been granted in the first place. The only
good it did was to place a boat in the pos
session of the rebels, which will make a
most capital gun boat.
The rebels sent about fifteen men to
Franklin, Ky., a few days ago to capture
some Unionists. The latter took refuge in
a house and refused to give themselves up,
firing on the rebels, killing one man and
wounding two others. The rebels then sot
fire to the house after the most approved
style of savago warfare, burning it and all
the men in it except two who mado their
escape. The Indian no longer can claim
t!io firebrand as peculiarly his style of war
f are.
Wo rejoice to learn that the family of
Mr. Charles Anderson, has arrived at
Brownsville, Texas. Mr. Anderson, him
self, was expected in a few days, when the
whole family would take passage for New
York, via Tatnpico. Mr. Anderson is a
brother of Gen. Robert Anderson.
The Governor of Tennessee has com
menced drafting. Apprehending this, GOO
or TOO Unionists had lett Nashville some
for Bast Tennessee, and some tor other di
rections. All tho firearms have been
wrenchod from the hands of tho citizans,
and taken from tho hardware stores, und
deposited in the State Dank. The City
Hotel, with its bods and bedding, had been
taken for a hospital, and several large
warehouses had been taken for the 6ame
purpose
A lady who escaped from Bowling
Green, thinks there are 60,000 effective
men there, and that tho fortifications, five
ia number, are very formidable. Two dis
tinct reviews were made a few days before
she left, each of which, she was told, num
bered 30,000 and even these did not em
brace all tho forces.
John C. Breckinridge is reported to be
qiite ill from an attack of the jaundice
The jaundice ought not to cheat the hang
man of bis due.
The Knoxvillo Tennessee Register, think
the fortifications at Cumberland Gap which I
have been completed, are amply sufficient
to defend itfrom any force from any quarter.
The rebels are becoming convinci-d that
the Northern Slates are terribly in earnest.
FBI DAT MORNING..
The Richmond Examiner emphatically de
clares, that every defeat and sacrifice more
thoroughly unites Um North, and that it
now has a regular army of 500,000 men.
It insists that the South should raise the
same number of men by conscrption, on the
plan of the European States.
The latest news from Charleston, is that
the Union troops have entire possession of
St. Helena Island, and that they had land
ed at the mouth of Ashpoor river, on the
northern side of St. Helena Sound. It is
also stated that an attempted landing near
Buckingham was prevented by the rebels.
The Savannah Republican is gradually
getting over its scare, and rejoices over tbe
wonderful displays of patriotism throughout
the State. Fifty thousand men, says that
paper, would place themselves in the field
within a week, if they only had the means
to arm and equip them. A dozen Lincoln
fleets cannot conquer such a people, thinks
the Republican. We must try, then and
send two dozen.
Camp Cochran, Hbad of Main St, I
Dec. 3rd, 18G1.
Editors Journal : Nothing of spocia1
importance has occured in camp since I
wrote, except that we have enlisted lior 15
more men, and that to us, is a little matter
of special interest. ' Blood will tell," and
so do the boots and blankets that are fur
nished to men who connect themselves with
Capt. Cochran's Artillery. The Captain is
fully acquainted with the necessity of keep
ing men warm and comfortable, and is do
ing all in his power to make the life of a
soldier desirable. He will leave for Indiana
polis to-morrow morning for the purpose of
selecting guns, and thinks he will be ablo
by the last of the week to have everything
on the ground that tho company will re
quire for the destruction of secession. Boys
who are out of theservice, report your'lves
soon, the company i3 nearly full.
We are under many obligations to Mr.
Wm. Paine, who furnished the Union Ar
tillery boys with a lamb neatly dressed.
We had a big dinner, and will doubtless
think of "Bill" often long may he wave.
Archio Sullivan has been very kind to the
boys, and has the thanks of the entire com
pany. We have some of tho finest potatoes

counted for by Captain Robinson, who
swears that "Old Abe" wus under the im

The Panic In South Carolina.
A letter in the Richmond Examinerrom
Charleston, dated November 21st, says:
"Tho amount of cotton abandoned on tho
plantations wss very considerable. It is
not easy to estimate the quantity with cer
tainty, bi i .rueraily said to be about
fifteen bu...!tnl bales. Many of the plant
ers, before quitting, set fire to their crops
and such other combustible property on
their premises as could not be removed. It
is certainly to be regretted that, in the con
fusion that prevailed, this very proper step
was not more generally taken.
"But the first surprise at the invasion has
now died away, and I think the Northern
Government may reckon, without fear of
mistake, that it has obtained the very last
bag of cotton, and also the last contraband
that it can ever hope to seize by pouncing
upon the coast of South Carolina. Con
certed arrangements between the planters
and the military authorities have wisely
been made, by which no plantation will be
abandoned until the crop is utterly con
sumed, the gin-house and other buildings
destroyed, tho live stock driven off, and the
hands removed to the intorior. In the
most exposed localities, 'hat is, the islands
adjacent to Port Royal, on which the ene
my may at any moment make his appear
ance, tho work of desiruction is already
commenced.
"For the past tew days gangs of negroes
from the sea-coast, laden with such effects
as they can carry, and followed by droves of
mules and horses, have been passing through
this city on their way to the back country.
Night before last the whole atmosphere in
the city, and for miles around, notwith
standing the bright moonlight, was hazy
and lurid. Many could not account for the
phenomenon. It was the effect of the whole
sale conflagration of cotton now geing on
at Edisto and other islands intervening be
tween Port Royal and Charleston. Wher
ever the marauders choose to land, and it is
useless to disguise the fact that they can
land at a great many points, they will find
nothing but devastated field?, deserted by
all, save the avenging presence of the par
tisan rifleman. The patriotic sacrifice which
has been made by our planters is nil the
greaterjwhea we consider that the crops of
the past season have far exceeded the best
ever before known.
"In my last letter I alluded to the
strength of the defences of Charleston. Sa
vannah has also been strongly fortified on a
plan for which the conformation of its har
bor affords peculiar facilities, and I under
stand that Gen. Lee says that that city is
now in a condition to make a protracted
and successful dofence. Gen. Lee has gone
to Brunswick, Georgia.
The Canadian papers are beginning
to understand the belligerent right of search.
The Toronto Globe confesses that we have
international law on our side, and the Mon
treal Gazette, referring to the hasty con
demnation by the Toronto papers of the
capture of Mason and Slide! 1, says:
Of course it was supreme nonsense to de
by tho existence of tbe belligerent right of
search of neutral vessels. Great Britain
has been foremost to assert it of nil tbe
nations of the world.
The election of George OpJyke,
Mayor of New York city, is a great triumph
of the Union men. Tho infamous letter of
Fernando Wood to Mr. Toombs, in relation
to the arms which the Southern Confederacy
was endeavoriug to smuggle Southward in
April last, marked the man as a traitor a
heart, and it is subject of congratulation
that he has been deprived of the power of
ruling New York for the next two years.
Mr. Opdyke, the Mayor elect, is one of the
merchant princes of Now York, worth over
$4,000,000, and a man of unquestioned
integrity and honesty.
The Army of thb Potomac. All ac
counts .'rom Washington agree that General
MoClellan is using untiring industry in get- j
ting the army into the best possible condi- j
tlon, while it is more and more evident,
every day, that he does not mean to use it j
to obaiu military glory, but to carry out a
plan similar to that of .Scott to quell this
rebellion by a mighty presntre, and not by a ,
mighty slaughter.
Notwithstanding the grave intima
tions contained in the President's message
that Congressmen had better leave the
management of the army solely to the
military men at its bead, those worthies
presist in introducing resolutions of inquiry.
Mr. Conkliu wants to know who is respon
sible for the disaster at Ball's Bluff. Mr.
Chandler asks a similar question as to Bull's
Run, and Senator Lane wants Springfield,
Wilson's Creek and Lexington explained
away. These gentlemen are impertinently
curious.
86fThe ship Harvey Birch, lately burned
at sea by the Savannah, was a beautiful,
new vessel, worth $102,000, and owned by
loyal citizens in New York. Unfortunately
she was not insured.
The 13th regiment, Col. Sullivan,
have been ordered to Beverly, Virginia. A
part of the regiment arrived there on tho
2Cth ult.
fta-It has been reported for several days
past, that contraband goods continue to
leave Henderson for the Southern Confede
racy. Cannot the Union men of that
place prevent these infractions of law?
8rB,We learn from the Knoxville (Tenn.)
Register that the Union men under arrest
there on tbe charge of bridge-burning had
been delivered over to the military author
ities, and were to be tried by court martial
on Thursday, the 28th ult.
SSafSenator Samuel Pickens, who rep
resents one of the counties of East Ten
nessee in the Senate, has been arrested
again and is now in jail in Knoxville, as
we learn from the Register of the 26th
ult. His offence is loyalty to the Union.
t&TThe point between Charleston and
SaTunnah, of importance next to Port Roy
al, is St. Helena Sound. Our troops are
now in peaceable josession, the enemy
having abandoned their fortifications there,
and taken tbe cannon into the interior.
From Cheat .Mountain.
C. R. Scudder returned this afternoon
from the headquarters of Gen. Reynolds, in
Western Virginia. The object of his visit
was to bring home the remains of young
Bunnell, of White county, a youth of sev
enteen, who went out with one of the regi
ments from this State, and died of typhoid
fever at Cheat Mountain. Mr. Scudder was
unable to execute his mission, owing to the
wretched condition of the roads and the
difficulty in obtaining transportation. The
road between Webster and Huttonville,
sixty-two miles, is lined with the wreck of
government wagons and dead horses. Six
miles a day is the average travel for a four-horge-wagon,
although a six horse team
with a load of straw hats might be equal to
seven or eight miles. Sutlers are compelled
to pay twenty dollars per day for six-horse
teams. The snow is fifteen inches deep on
Cheat Mountain. Mr. Scudder dined with
Captain Miller on Tuesday. He reports him
slowly improving, but with no immediate
prospect of returning home. The gallant
soldiers of the 15th had volunteered to carry
him in a blanket, but tbe severity of the
weather, and the almost impassible condi
tion of the roads rendered it impracticable.
Gen. Reynolds and bis efficient Adjutant,
fated to remain for the winter in undispu
ted occupation of the position they bad so
honorably won and nobly maintained, were
cheerfully discharging the responsible duties
of the post, and the praises of the 'Little
General' and his staff is on every lip. La
fayette Courier Dec. 1.
The Hamulus ot Troops What the
Potomac Army can do.
The Natioual Intelligencer says:
There were some circumstances attendant
on tho recent great review of the army on
the Potomac which may, perhaps, deserve a
special mention, as serving to show at least
the capacity that exists for the speedy mass
ing of troops in that quarter. We under
stand that the seventy-seven regiments of
infantry, the eight regiments of cavalry,
and the seventeen batteries of field artillery
which participated in that pageant were
summoned and gathered for that purpose
from their widely seperated stations on a
notice of only twenty-four hours. The
task of accomplishing this result in the
time specified was committed by Gen. Mc
Clellan to Gen. McDowell, and the efficien
cy with which that accomplished officer
discharged the duty assigned him was suffic
iently attested by the success of tbe review,
which, besides presenting a brilliant milita
ry display, afforded to the young General-in-Chief
a pressage of the reliance he con
place on the expedition that will be brought
to the fulfillment of bis orders whenever it
shall be necessary to combine tbe forces now
in the field for any operations of an active
character.

termanditig the order to lea?e Henderson
and march to Calhoun, did not reach the

on tbe ri.n'.e. Their present encampment
does not aftord a proper place for drilling
the regiment. Lieut. Orr bad beard noth
