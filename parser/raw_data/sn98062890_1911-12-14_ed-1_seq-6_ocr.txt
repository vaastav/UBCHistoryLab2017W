PRESIDENT INFORMS CONGRESS
ABOUT RELATIONS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES.. %.
NEW ARBITRATION TREATIES
United States Helps In Amicable Set
tlement of Disputes—Events Con
nected With the Mexican Revolu
tion—Need for Merchant Marine.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Foreign affairs
are the sole subject of President Taft's
special message, which was submitted
to Congress today. In part the docu
ment says:
The relations of the United States with
other countries have continued during the
past twelve months upon a basis of the
usual good will and friendly Intercourse.
Arbitration.
The year Just passed marks an Im
portant general movement on the part of
the powers for broader arbitration. In
the recognition of the manifold benefits
to mankind in the extension of the policy
of the settlement of international dis
putes by arbitration rather than by war.
and in response to a widespread demand
for an advance in that direction on the
part of the people of the United States
and of Great Britain and of France, new
arbitration treaties were negotiated last
spring with Great Britain and France,
the terms of which were designed, as
expressed in the preamble of these treat
ies, to extend the scope and obligations of
the policy of arbitration adopted in our
present treaties with thse governments.
To pave the way for this treaty with the
United States, Great Britain negotiated
an important modification In its alliance
With Japan and the French government
also expedited the negotiations with sig
nal good will. The new treaties have
been submitted to the senate and are
awaiting its advice and consent to their
ratification. All the essentials of these
important treaties have long been known,
and it Is my earnest hope that they will
receive prompt and favorable action.
Arbitrations.
In further illustration of the practical
and beneficent application of the princi
ple of arbitration and the underlying
broad spirit of conciliation. «m happy
to advert to the part of the United States
In faclllatlng amicable settlement of dis
putes which menaced the peace between
Panama and Costa Rica and between
Haiti and the Dominican republic.
Since the date of their independence,
Colombia and Costa Rica had Been seek
ing a solution of a boundary dispute,
Which came as a heritage from Colombia
to the new republic of Panama, upon its
beginning life as an independent na
tion. In January, 1910, at the request of
both governments the agents represent
ing them met In conference at the depart
ment of state and subsequently conclud
ed a protocol submitting this long-pend
ing controversy to the arbitral Judgment
of the chief Justice of the United States,
who consented to act In this capacity. A
boundary commission, according to the
International agreement, has now been
appointed, and It is expected that the ar
guments will shortly proceed and that
uiia long-standing dispute will be honor
ably and satisfactorily terminated.
Again, a few months ago It appeared
that the Dominican republic and Haiti
were about to enter upon hostilities be
cause of complications growing out of an
acrimonious boundary dispute which the
efforts of many years had failed to solve.
The government of the United States, by
a friendly Interposition of good offices,
succeeded In prevailing upon the parties
to place their reliance upon some form of
pacific settlement.
Mexico.
The recent political events In Mexico
received attention from this government
because of the exceedingly delicate and
difficult situation created along our south
ern border and the necessity for taking
measures properly to safeguard Ameri
can interests. The sovernment of the
United States, In Its desire to secure a
proper observance and enforcement of
the so-called neutrality statutes of the
federal government, issued directions to
the appropriate officers to exercise a dili
gent and vigilant regard for the require
ments of such rules and laws. Although
a condition of actual armed conflict ex
isted, there was no official recognition of
belligerency Involving the technical neu
trality obligations of International law.
After a conference with the secretary
of war and the secretary of the navy, I
thought It wise to assemble an army
division of full strength at San Antonio,
Tex., a brigade of three regiments at
Oalveston, a brigade of Infantry in the
Loa Angeles district of southern Cali
fornia, together with a squadron of bat
tleships and cruisers and transports at
Galveston, and a small squadron of ships
at San Diego. At the same time, through
our representative at the City of Mexico
I expressed to President Diax the hope
that no apprehensions might result from
unfounded conjectures as to these mili
tary maneuvers, and assured him that
they had no significance which should
cause concern to his government.
I am more than nappy to here record
the fact that all apprehensions as to the
effect of the presence of so large a mili
tary force in Texas proved groundless
no disturbances occurred.
The Insurrection continued and resulted
In engagements between the regular
Mexican troops and the Insurgents, and
this along the border, so that in several
Instances bullets from the contending
forces struck American citizens engaged
In their lawful occupations on American
•oil.
Proper protests were made against
these Invasions of American rights to the
Mexican authorities.
The presence of a large military and
naval force available for prompt action,
near the Mexican border, proved to be
the most fortunate under the somewhat
trying conditions presented by this inva
sion of American rights.
The policy and action of this govern
ment were based upon an earnest friend
liness for the Mexican people as a whole,
and^ 1 ls a matter of gratification to note
that this attitude of strict impartiality as
to all factions In Mexico and of sincere
"Jfpoship for the neighboring nation,
without regard for party allegiance lias
been generally recognized and has re
sulted In an even closer and more sym
pathetic understanding between the two
republics and a warmer regard one for
tne other. Action to suppress violence
and restore tranquility throughout the
Mexican republic was of peculiar Inter
est to this government. In that it con
ceded the safeguarding of American life

Honduras- and Nicaragua Treaties
Proposed.
As to the situation In Central America.
have taken occasion in the past to em
phaajn most strongly the importance that
should be attributed to the consumma
tion of the conventions between the re
public* of Nicaragua and of Honduras
and this country, and I again earnestly
recommend that the neoessary advice and
consent of the senate be accorded to
these treaties, which will make it possi
ble for these Central American repub
Ues to enter upon an era of genuine eco
nomic national development.
Hour relations with the Republic of
Panama, peculiarly important due to mu
tual obligations and the vaat interests

sion of our attitude of sympathetic In

"r New Japansss Treaty.
iMffbed $h 389fb. would by a strict1 Inter
PMlailuia of lta provisions have tsrmina't-
•Mfeetoffi.'
ed on July 17, 1912. Japan's general
treaties with the other powers, however,
terminated In 19U, and the Japanese gov
ernment expressed an earnest desire to
conduct the negotiations for a new treaty
with the United States simultaneously
with its negotiations with the other pow
ers. There were a number of important
questions Involved In the treaty, includ
ing the immigration of laborers, revision
of the customs tariff and the right of
Americans to hold real estate In Japan.
The United States consented to waive al'
technicalities and to enter at once upon
negotiations for a new treaty on the un
derstanding that thero should be a con
tinuance throughout the life of the treaty
of the same effective measures for the
restriction of immigration of laborers to
American territory which had been In
operation with entire satisfaction to both
governments since 1908. The Japanese
government accepted this basis of nego
tiation, and a new treaty was quickly
concluded, resulting in a highly satisfac
tory settlement of the other questions re
ferred to.
Europe and the Near East.
In Europe and the near east, during the
past twelve-month,, there has been at
times considerable political unrest. The
Moroccan question, which for some
months was the cause of great anxiety,
happily appears to have reached a stage
at which it need no longer be regarded
with concern. The Ottoman empire was
occupied for a period by strife in Al
bania and is now at war with Italy. In
Greece and the Balkan countries the
disquieting potentialities of this situation
have been more or less felt. Persia has
been the scene of a long internal strug
gle. These conditions have been the
cause of uneasiness in European diplo
macy, but thus far without direct politi
cal concern to the United Stated.
In the war which unhappily exists be
tween Italy and Turkey this government
has no direct political Interest, and I
took occasion at the suitable time to is
sue a proclamation of neutrality in that
conflict. At the same time all necessary
steps have been taken to safeguard the
personal interests of American citizens
and organizations in so far as affected
by the war.
Fur-Seal Treaty.
The fur-seal controversy, which for
nearly twenty-five years has been the
source of serious friction between the
United States and the powers bordering
upon the north Pacific ocean, whose S'lb
jects have been permitted tc engage in
pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds
having their breeding grounds within the
jurisdiction of the United States, has at
last been satisfactorily adjusted by the
conclusion of the North Pacific sealing
convention entered into between the
United States, Great Britain, Japan and
Russia on the seventh of July last.
The attention of congress is especially
called to the necessity for legislation on
the part of the United States for the pur
pose of fulfilling the obligations assumed
undsr tills convention to v/hich scn~
ate gave its advice and consent on the
twenty-fourth day of July last.
International Opium Commission.
In a special message transmitted to the
congress on the seventh of January, 13U,
In which I concurred in the recommenda
tions made by the secretary of state in
regard to certain needful legislation for
the control of our interstate and foreign
traffic In opium and other menacing
drugs, I quoted from my annual mes
sage of December 7, 1909, in which I an
nounced that the results of the Interna
tional Opium commission held at Shang-
February,
m°r®
1909, at the Invitation of
the United States, had been laid before
this government that the report of that
commission showed that China was mak
1F remarkable progress and admirable
efforts toward the eradication of the
opium evil that the Interested govern
ments had not permitted their commer
cial interests to prevent their co-opera
tlon In this reform and, as a result of
callateral Investigations of the opium
question In this country, I recommended
that the manufacture, sale and use of
opium in the United States should be
rigorously controlled by legislation.
Prior to that time and In continuation
of the policy of thia government to se
cure the co-operation of the Interested
nations, the United States proposed an
International opium conference with full
powers for the purpose of clothing with
the force of International law the reso
lutions adopted by the above-mentioned
commission, together with their essen
tial corollorles. The other powers con
cerned cordially responded to the pro
posal of this government, and, I am glad
to be able to announce, representatives
°f all the powers assembled in conference
at The Hague on the first of this month.
Foreign Trade Relations of the United
8tates.
In my last annual message I referred
to the tariff negotiations of the depart
ment of state with foreign countries in
connection with the application, by a se
ries of proclamations, of the minimum
tariff of the United States to importa
tions from the several countries, and I
stated that. In its general operation, sec
tion 2 of the new tariff law had proved
a guaranty of continued commercial
fieace.
although there were, unfortunate
y. Instances where foreign governments
dealt arbitrarily with American Interests
within their Jurisdiction In a manner In
jurious and inequitable. During the past
year some Instances of discriminatory
treatment have been removed, but I re
gret to say that there remain a few
cases of differential treatment adverse to
the conimerce of the United States. While
none of these instances now appears to
amount to undue discrimination In the
sense of section 2 of the tariff law of
August 5. 1909, they are all exceptions to
that complete degree of equality of tar
iff treatment that the department of
state has consistently sought to obtain
for American commerce abroad.
While the double tariff feature of the
tariff law of 1909 has been amply Justi
fied by the results achieved In removing
former and preventing new. undue dis
criminations against American commerce.
It Is believed that the time has come for
the amendment of this feature of the law
in such way as to provide a graduated
means of meeting varying degrees of
discriminatory treatment of American
commerce In foreign countries as well as
to protect the financial Interests abroad
of American citizens against arbitrary
and injurious treatment on the part of
foreign governments through either leg
islative or administrative measures.
It would seem desirable that the maxi
mum tariff of the United States should
embrace within Its purview the free list,
which is not the case at the present time.
In order that It might have reasonable
significance to the governments of those
countries from which the Importations
Into the United States are confined vir
tually to articles on the free list.
The fiscal year ended June 30. 1911,
shows great progress In the development
of American trade. It was noteworthy
as marking the highest record of exports
of American products to foreign coun
tries, the valuation being in excess of
$2,000,000,000. These exports showed a
gain over the preceding year of more
than $900,000,000.
Crying Need for American Merchant
Marine.
I need hardly reiterate the conviction
that there should speedily be built up an
American merchant marine. This is nec
essary to assure favorable transporta
tion facilities to our great ocean-borne
commerce as well as to supplement the
navy with an adequate reserve of ships
and men. It would have the economic ad
vantage of keeping at home part of the
vast sums now paid foreign snipping for
carrying American goods. All the great
commercial nations pay heavy subsidies
to their merchant marine, so that It is
obvious that without some wise aid from
the congress the United States must lag
behind in the matter of merchant marine
in Its present anomalous position.
Improvement of the Foreign Service.
The entire foreign-service organization
is being Improved and developed with
especial regard to the requirements of
the commercial interests of the country.
The rapid growth of our foreign trade
makes it of the utmost importance that
governmental agencies through which
that trade Is to be aided and protected
should possess a high degree of effi
ciency. Not only Bhould the foreign rep
resentatives be maintained upon a gen
erous scale In so far as salaries and es
tablishments are concerned, but the se
lection and advancement ol officers
should be definitely and permanently reg
ulated by law, so that the service shut
not fall to attract men of. high character
and ability. The experience of the past
few years with a partial application of
civit service rules to the dlpulomatic anf
consular service leaves no doubt In my
mind of the wisdom of wider and mort
permanent extension of those principle*
to both branches of the foreign ssri'los
C. J. BACH CH08EN PRESIDENT.
Retail Implement Men End Sioux Falls
Meeting.
Sioux Falls.—The Retail Implement
association of South Dakota and south
western Minnesota and northwestern
Iowa, which is composed of men who
annually sell goods valued in the ag
gregate of many millions of dollars,
has concluded its thirteenth annual
connvention here. The following of
ficers were elected for ttye coming
year:
President, C. J. Bach, Hurley vice
president, L. G. Ochsenreiter, Web
ster secretary-treasurer, E. C. Bar
ton, Vermillion directors, H. C. Mey

E. B. Van Alstine of Mitchell was

Takes Shot at Girl.
Dallas.—After acting strangely for
several days, John Franzel, a home
steader in the Ideal district in the
ceded portion of the Rosebud reserva
tion in Tripp county, suddenly became
violently insane and ran amuck,
armed with a rifle. Catching sight of
a daughter of Charles Putzier, a neigh
boring homesteader, he fired at her,
but fortunately did not hit her. The
authorities were notified and Sheriff
Little and a posse went to the scene
and after a chase succeeded in cap
turing the crazy man. He has rela
tives in Kansas, who have been noti
fied, and if they do not consent to
care for him he will be sent to the
state hospital for the insane at Yank
ton.
Bishop Rowe Speaks.
Brookings.—"Commodore Peary wae
absolutely wrong when he brought
back a report that, the Christian mis
sions are useless among the Eskimo,"
said Bishop Rowe, of Alaska, in an ad
dress before the students of the state
college at Brookings. Bishop Rowe
stated that his sixteen years' experi
ence as missionary worker among the
people of the far north convinces him
that Christianity is worth while
among these people from any stand
point.
The bishop's address on the re
sources, history, and people of Alas
ka was replete with striking experi
ences and clear cut descriptions of
the region above the Arctic. He ex
ploded the common belief that Alaska
is not an agricultural country by say
ing that all important grains and ag
ricultural products can be successfully
grown there. Bishop Rowe quoted the
director of the experiment station of
Alaska as saying that the products of
her soil could feed three million peo
ple. His description of the popula
tion of Alaska, Indians, Eskimo and
whites habits of life of the natives,
their polygamous delations, supersti
tions, accomplishments, was extreme
ly interesting and at times very hu
morous.
Letcher Man Winner.
Aberdeen.—The South Dakota State
Dairymen and Buttermakers' conven

which
J.
M. Rasmussen of Letcher

was tied by Alvid Finstad of Alcester,
with the same score, while E. H. Bald
win of Belle Fourche was third with a
score of 93. The other contestants
were close behind, the average score
being 91.
Water Plant for Chamberlain.
Chamberlain.—At a special city elec
tion bonds for $20,000 were authorized
to be issued for the purpose of estab
lishing a pumping station on the banks
of the Missouri river, with which to
supply the city with water. For 20
years the water of the city has been
supplied by an artesian well, but for
the past several months this supply
has become so unsatisfactory that oth
er arrangements were deemed imper
ative.
j,.
Big Bounty for Wolves.
Deadwood.—As an additional incen
tive to kill off the wolves and coyotes
in this section, which are particularly
bold and numerous this winter, the
county commissioners have just issued
authority for a bounty of ?2 per head,

ANNOUNCEMENT IS MADE BY
BOARD THAT HAS BEEN EX
AMINING WRECK.
fl r"
OF THE BATTLESHIP MAINE
Mystery of Who Planted the Mine
That Caused Wreck Only Deep
ened—Report Not to Be
Published.
Washington, D. C.—The United
States battleship Maine, sunk in Ha
vana harbor, February, 189S, by. an
explosion, was blown up from the
outside. This was announced by the
naval board which has been examin
ing the wreck. The finding confirms
the report of the original investiga
tors who made a superficial examina
tion shortly after the disaster.
The statement given out by the
navy department is brief. Secretary
Meyer does not believe it necessary
to issue any extended explanation of
the board's conclusions beyond the
flat statement that an exterior explo
sion was responsible for the loss of
the warship and the lives of many
men. The statement follows:
"The injuries to the bottom of the
Maine was caused by tlie explosion of
a charge of a low fonn of explosive
exterior to the ship between frames
28 and 31, strake 8, port side. This
resulted in igniting and exploding the
contents of the six-inch reserve mag
azine, A-14-M, said contents including
a large quantity of black powder.
The more or less complete explosion
of the contents of the remaining for
ward magazine followed. The maga
zine explosions resulted in the de
struction of the vessel."
Secretary Meyer announced that
there might be a further statement on
the report of the board after it had
been considered by the president. He
did not believe the report would ever
be published in full, but would be
kept in the confidential archives of
the department. The declaration that1
a "low explosive" was used in the!
outside explosion indicates a belief:
that a mine and not a dirigible tor
pedo was the instrument of destruc
tion.
This only deepens the mystery of
the destruction of the Maine. A mine
charged with sufficient gunpowder to
blow in the bottom of the ship must
have weighed several hundred pounds.
To plant such a mine and lay the elec
tric connections necessary for its dis
charge would have required the serv
ices of a number of men.
BRIDGE FALLS 200 DEAD.
Workmen Drown in Accident on Rus
sian Railway.
St. Petersburg, Dec. 9.—It is be
lieved that between 150 and 200 lives
have been lost by the collapse of a
railroad bridge over the Volga river,
near Kazad. The bridge was in course
of construction and was filled with
workmen when, without warning, the
supports gave way and the men were
precipitated into the icy waters. Only
half a dozen bodies have been re
covered, but the authorities express
the hope that some of the men have
been able to save themselves by
grasping cakes of floating ice.
FAMINE CLAIMS HUNDREDS.
Crop Shortage Causes Fearful Suffer
ing Among Russian Peasants.
St. Petersburg, Russia.—Russia is in
the grip of a famine that threatens to
claim more lives than that of 1891,
when 800,000 died. The Free Eco
nomic society estimates the crop
shortage at 50,000,000 tons.
In Ufa hundreds of children have
lived for months on acorns, but these
are almost exhausted. In the Samara
province, the people are eating dogs
and shrubs, while scores are dying of
starvation.
Officials have prohibited the organi
zation of private relief societies, fear
ing political propaganda. In some dis
tricts, the police have forbidden the
papers to raise funds or to mention the
famine. Even the central Zemstvo or
ganization has received orders not to
attempt relief.
