T
President Baiitlktt, of Amherst Col
lege, has written an historical explanation
of Tt-ihes"' and hazing at colleges,
wherein he points out that this peculiar
barbarism, which is tolerated by public
opinion in some of those very communi
ties whose whole purpose is to promote
enlightenment, is curiously enough "a
far-off relic of the ancient "bent-tit of the
clericiis.' " lie cites a number of striking
-Tiinml,. of the false notion of dutv and j
I l
;n-rals which prevail in some student com
munities to prove this interesting histori
cal fact, lie points out, too, a very effec
tive remedy, and shows how it has worked
in several notable cases. His p.'per Hp
rears in the Foium for December.
THE PRESIDENT'S .MES Y;E.
The Piesident has sent his annual mes
sage to Congress. It is in keeping with
aii other ."State papers that have emanated
from our wise Chief Executive. The
opening words of the message deal with
the subject that is uppermost in the minds
of the people. The President does not
endeavor to evade the great question of
Tax reduction, but iu the first sentence
-titers into its discussion, and declares
th.it the present taxation is "au indefensi
ble extortion and a culpable betrayal of
American, fairness and ju-tice." These
are strong words, but only strong words
can aptly describe the injustice of exces
si . cly taxing the Industry and enterprise
of the people. The President goes en to
.a that -this wrong, like other wrongs,
multiplies a brood of evil consequences."
Present action in the part of Congress is
urged. The using of a portion of the sur
plus to buy government bonds and apply
to the sinking fund is reviewed and it is
shown that, notwithstanding these opera
tions and expedients of the Treasury De
partment. di.-trts.-s iu business was only
temporarily relieved. It is estimated that
on the :10th day of June next the surplus
will be --si 10,000,000. It is now w-j-V-o -701.19.
The President does not think
that the proper way to reduce the surplus
is to continue to buy bonds at a premium,
or to make extravagant at propriations.
The first way is open to the objection that
the bonds are not matured, and that the
government would be at the will of the
h- .Iders of the bonds. Unnecessarily large
appropriations are objectionable because
they stimulate a habit of reckless improvi
dence not in the least consistent with the
mission of our people or the high and
beneficent purposes of our government.
The President dwells upon the gravity
.f the situation and declares that the past
neglect of Congress has taxed to the ut
rnost all the authority and expedients
within executive control. He thus warns
Congress and says "If disaster results
from the continued inaction of Congress
f he responsibility must rest where it prop
erly belongs." He admits that the situa
is fraught with danger, and says that it
grows "'out of a perfectly palpable and
apparent cause constantly reproducing
the same alarming circumstances a con
gested national treasury and a depleted
monetary condition in the business of the
country. It need hardly be .stated that
while the present situation demands a
remedy we can only be saved from a like
predicament in the future by the removal
of its cause."
How .shall taxation be reduced? The
President says by at once revising and
amending the present tariff laws "the
vicious, inequitable and illogical source of
unnecessary taxation." He does not think
that the internal revenue tax ought to be
abolished, and says that nothing is so well
able to bear the burden without hardship
as the articles taxed by the internal reve
nue laws.
The only way out of the present grave
situation, then, according to the President,
is to revise the Tariff. He shows that by
the operations of the present Tariff all
consumers pay the amount of the duty,
whether the articles consumed are import
ed or made in the United .States. This is
what is called Protection to home manu
facturers. The President says that '-in
the read justment of our tariff the inter
ests of American labor engaged in manu
facture should be carefully considered, as
well as the preservation of our manufac
tures." With this premise, follows a full
and clear discussion of the tariff question.
Those w ho demand "protection for our in
fant industries" are ridiculed, and the
President says "we are in the midst of
centennial celebrations, and with becom
ing pride, we rejoice in American skill and
ingenuity, in American energy and enter
prise, and in the wonderful natural ad
vantages and resources developed by our
country's natural growth." "Centennial
infants!" An "infant" one hundred years
old is rather a queer being.
Without affectation or hyprocrisy, the
President says that American labor is en-
titled to the utmost regard, and that they
are entitled to their full share of all our
advantages. He allows that of the 17,-oD'-,
('!! of one population engaged iti all
kinds of industry, only 2,G-2:;,0 persons
are tmployed in such manufacturing in
dustries as are claimed to be benelitted by
a high tat iff. ""To these,"' continues the
President iu the most lucid and strongest
style, "' the appeal is made to save their
employment and maintain their wages b
resisting a change. There should be no
disposition to answer such suggestions by
the allegations that they are in a minority
of those who labor and therefore should
forego an advantage in the interest of low
prices for the majority. Their compensa
tion, as it may be affected by the opera
tion of tariff laws, should at aii times be
scrupulously kept in view. And yet with
slight rctlectiou they will not overtook the
fact that they arc consumers with the rest,
that they too have their own wants and
those of their own families to supply from
their earnings and that the pi ice of the
necessaries of Hie as well as the amount
of their wages will regulate the measure
of their welfare and comfort. Hut the re
duction of taxation demanded should be
so measured as not to necessitate or just ify
either the loss of employment bj the
workingman or the lessening of his wages,
and t lie profits still remaining to the man
ufacturer altera necessary readjustment
should furnish no excuse for the sacriiice
of the interests of his employees either in
their opportunity to work or in the dimin
ution ot their compensation. Nor can the
workers in manufactories fait to under

to be necessary to allow ttse payment of

to return, iu the payment ot the increase
in price which the tariff permits, the hard

The Pre
sidf
recommends the r
movai
or reduction of the duty on wool in the
revision of the tariff and gives cogent and
unanswerable reasons why this should be
done. In next week's Cum ink le we will
publish in full his argument in support of
this reduetiou which he recommends.
The manufacturers are warned that, if ;

ful and deliberate reform of the tariff, j j,
which is offered s.dely because tie- bit- j t
iuess interests of the country demand it. j
that the time may com- when an abus. d . x
and irritated people, heedless of tho-c . e,
who have resisted uiiiejv- hi: a reasonable
warning, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rat ific.it ion i xh-ir wrong-.
Tie- manufacturers are also shown that
an enlighu-ti.-d self-ino rest ought to
prompt them to aid in a n-asunaole ad
justment, even if they art- a.kcd to -ur-rendei-
somethhig for the pablic -;d d.
one. r to avert disaster wnich an over
flowing Tte.i-urv and exc-siv i.x Hi-mi
invite. fin y ought to co-opera.! e to .-e- i
cure reduction, tne President continue-;. !
because ,,f their patriotism as well as on j
account of a gratified recognition ot ad j
vantage a!r'.-ad afforded. The Pre-ident '
shows" them their duty, but th- ir sehi-h- j
ness will not allow them to pert' nn it. 1
"Patriotism be damned. is t!ie:r cry.
We have map protection : we now have
protection ; we will ii.ur proted ion. or
bust tiie government. Tie y cry, "'live,
dive," all the time, and appeals to their
patriotism are a.- l.kcly to move tiieui a- a:i
entreaty for mercy moved the Roman
gladiators. It is milk" they w.iut.
They are getting it, but when the cow
runs dry. and an outraged people, atone
stroke take away all aid, they will break
and go up like a bubble. And then they
w ill cry for mercy !
The "President does not fail to appre
ciate the difficulties attending a w ise and
fair revision of our tariff laws. He thinks
one way of making the needed reduction
is to put some of the over four thousand
articles, now subject to duty, on the free
list. Tax the luxuries ami tree the neces
saries is his paramount idea. "A radical !
reduction of duties imposed upon raw ma
terial used in manufactures, or its f re
importation" is recommended as an im
portant factor in reducing the price of the
necessaries. as well as reducing the present
taxation. Such a change would not. the
President thinks, have any injurious effect
upon manufacturers, but on the contrary
it would help them. It would give them
a better oppoi tunitv to sell in foreign
eoiintries and afford their employees a
more certain and steady libor, with its
resulting quiet and contentment.
The President then points out that this
tariff reduction is Higher than any party
question, and a Do that both parties have
s demniy dcclated against the collection
of a larger revenue than is needed. Pa
triotism and fidelity to party alike require
an immediate ri dtietioti. The quest ion oi
lice trade is iii'el-1 ant. The President
says that, at this crisis, the dwelling upon
the theories of Free Irade or Protection
savors of bandying epithets, and .adds :
"It is a condition which confronts us,
not a theory. Tne relief from this condi
tion many involve a slignt reduction ot
the advantages which we award our home
productions, but the entire withdrawal of
such advantage should not be contem
plated. "The question of free trade-Is absolutely
irreh vant and the persistent claim made
in certain quarters that till efforts to te
lieve the people from unjust and unnices
sary taxation are schemes of so-called
free-traders is mischievous and far remov
ed from any consideration for the public
good. The simple and plain duty which
we owe the people is to reduce taxation
to the necessary expenses of an economical
operation of the government and to re
store to the business of the country the
money which we hold in the treasury
through the perversion of governmental
lowers. These things can .did should be
done with safety to all .-nr industries,
without danger to the opportunity for
remunerative labor which our working
men need and with benefit to them and
till our people by cheapening their means
of subsistence and increasing the measure
of their comforts."
Closing, the President intimates that he
may write again. He explains his failure
in not alluding, m customary compliance
with the executive habit, to the "State of
the Nation," to the fact that he is so much
impressed with the paramount importance
of the reduction of the tariff that he has
given almost the entire message to its dis
cussion. And it is a wise and able dis
cussion, of which the above is the gist.
The Chronicle's advice to the Congress
men is to take the President's wise counsel
and to do what he recommends about this
important question of Tariff Reduction.

The Democratic caucus of the House of
Representatives was held Saturday even
ing about s, o'clock at the "Capitol. The
caucus chose Hon. S. S. Cox as Chairman.
He addressed the caucus in a brief speech,
at the conclusion of which Representative
Breckinridge, of Kentucky, arose and,
amidst applause, nominated .John C. Car
lisle for Speaker. Upon motion of Repre
sentative Scott, of Pennsylvania, the
nomiua'ioi' was made by acclamation.
Mr. Carlisle was brought into the hall
and aeknowled the honor in the following
language:
"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the
caucus: I scarcely know iu what terms
to express my thanks for this second
unanimous nomination for the high office
of the Speaker of the House of Representa
tives. But the generous confidence here
tofore and still reposed in me by my Dem
ocratic associates, requires something more
at my hand than mere verbal expression
of gratitude, and perhaps may be well
omitted. My appreciation of it can better
be shown by "a faithful and conscientious
discharge of ellieial duties iu the position
to which you propose to assign me; not
merely as "a vindication of your own ac
tion, but as a practical acknowledgment
on my part of a high and solemn obliga
tion. " The office for which you have nom

Mr. Hurt had two or three managers, the
most prominent being Ex-Congr-esstuan

During tlie balloting. Messrs. P.reckin
ridge, of Arkansas, and lllount, of Georg
ia, 'enlivened tiie Hall of the House by
having a list fight. Mr. Pdoutit. struck
the first blow and mashed Mr. Breckin
ridge's nose. The blow was promptly re
turned, and the blood came before the
Congressional pugilists were separated.
The members who first tried to part the
belHgerents, 1 hear, were somewhat
scratched also. Tin- casus belli was this:
Representative P.reck in ridge began a
vigorous attack on Mr. Donclson, substan
tially repeating and elaborating what was
contained in his published charges against
the doorkeeper. Mr. Tatilbee, of Ken
tuck v. defended the doorkeeper, as did
Mr. "lUoiiut, of Georgia. The latter was
repeatedly in t erru.pt ed in his remarks by
Mr. Breckinridge, and finally both of the
gentlemen lost their tempers and came to
gether iu a tliieateuiug manner. In the
course of a running colloquy between the
two gentlemen Mr. Blount remarked that
Mr. Breckinridge was of course working
for '-his man." Mr. Breckinridge indig
nantly denied that he had "a man" and
declared that he was actuated in his ac
tion merely by a desire for the good of the
Democratic party. Mr. Blount reiterated
his statement and Mr. Breckinridge turn
ing towards him said with warmth, "the
gentlemen imputes to me dishonorable
motives." Blount misunderstood the re
mark and promptly resented it. Tie
mat1 er was then explained to Mr. Blount,
who instantly, upon learning of the mis
apprehension under w hich In: had labored,
requested that Mr. Breckinridge return to
the floor in order that he might tender
him an apology for his action. Lpon Mr.
Breckinridge's appearance, ;Mr. Blount
apologized, and the gentlemen shook hands
with great c rdiality.

The North Carolina delegation had an
interview with Speaker Carlisle Saturday.
He approves of the repeal of the tobacco
tax and of the reduction of thefruit-hran-dv
tax from 90 to 10 Cints. This pro
gramme may not seem clear when the
skeleton of the forthcoming tariff bill is
given to your readers in this column, but
it will be accompanied by amendments to
that bill. The Speaker thinks this much
can certainly be done this session, and he
is prepared to render every possible a-sist
ance to our Congressmen in carrying out
the expressed will of their constituents in
this particular. You may depend upon
it, the tobacco tax will be abolished, the
brandy tax reduced anil the method of
collect ing t he latter changed for th bet
ter if our Congressmen can effect this
retiult. Mr. Henderson is not as hopeful
about getting justice for our State as J
have seen him on former occasions when
the tariff was under discussion. Buf lie
already has the outline of his tariff bill
prepared and will present it soon after the
House organizes. He will fight the oppo
nents of tariff reform with his accustomed
zeal. Senator Vance says he does not
anticipate any legislation this winter,
judging from the present outlook, that
w ill materially decrease the taxes.

Washington, D. C, Dee. 5, 1 Ssj7. I
spent one hour and a half at the Govern
ment Printing office Saturday morning.
While I was in the ante-room waiting for
Public Printer Benedict, Major Wm. A.
Ilearne, formerly of Raleigh, who was ap
pointed a proof reader in the Government
Printing office a few months ago, passed
the door. I spoke to htm and found he
was very much pleased with his work. He
is in the same room in which John Henry
Boner formei Iy woi ktd. Mr. Boner you
w iii remember w as turned out for "parti
san activity." I find that a kind hearted
politician put Major Ilearne in because he
needed the position, but you and I know
I hat flic yers:-d'!e Major is about as much
of a Dcmecrac ns Jehu Nichols is an Inde
pendent. I suppose while the Democrats
are dominant, Major Ilearne can be class
ed as an Indiqx ndent Mugwump, but he
has strong Democratic influence at his
back. I know all about the modus oper
andi and the mimes personu- involved in
; Ids appointment, but it u one of those
little matters I choose to keep sen rosa
"or the present. I won't tell on him as I
did on Tim Lee and Gorman for reasons
best known to myself, hope he will
ha-eji his place, even if the Administration
- i.ould change and I hereby guarantee that
the fate of political parties cannot be more
mutable than the variable status of Major
Ib-ariie's political convictions. I found
the- Public Printer busy with his foremen
to w hom he was explaining his plans for
the coming winter. He will employ only
I venty additional printers for getting out

t his winter on account of the lara increase
in the t'orcu ni the past years, speaking
of the economical methods now in vogue
Mr. Benedict said:
"Well, the very day I came here in Sep
tember of last year, J intercepted the ship
ment of 12 barrels of stereotype dross that
were just lieing taken out or the yard to
be sold, 1 ordered them rolled back out
of the way and left them, I was pretty
busy, and Ir w a notno weeks before 1 got
around to them. Then I was told that
the regular price obtained for stereotype
dross was it cent and a half a pound. I
knew this was not more than half enough
and it excited my suspicions as ro the con
tents. I ordered the V2 barrels emptied
when, there came to light, carefully hid
den i;i t he dross, large ipiant it ies of waste
brass rules and waile copper shell worth
5 to 10 cents a pound, and set carefully
up in the centre of each barrel were from
one to three new topper anode weighing
about all pounds each, which had been
purc-ha-ed by the office at a eot o gl
cent per pound some 10 apiece. How
nmnj hundred dollar's worth of govern
ment property there was in those oarrels
1 have now forgotten; but I remember
that I sold the dross at 3 cents a pound
twice as much as had been charged for it
the brass at 5 tenia, and the eopper shell
at 7, while the copper anodes were secured
and used for the puipose for which they
were bought.
A great accumulation of paper not need
ed, was here when I came in, and quanti
ties were delivered from time to time on
contract. I rejected a good ileal because
it fell below sample, and cut down the
bills on the rest for similar tv.isous. In
my first three months I rejected more than
4,000 reams of paper on account of its lie
ing below the standard of the contract. I
annulled one contract, entirely. On paper
in the warehouse, when I took charge a
year ago, 1 deducted from 5 to 10 per cent,
from the face of bills rendered, on account
of the inferior quality of the paper. Pur
chases made outside of contract were uni
formly billed at such a high rate that they
were generaily returned with the demand
that they be reduced from 10 to :j;5 per
cent. The demand was always acceded to.
Shortly after coming here my chief clerk
reported to me that the roller composition
was cheap and inferior, and the rollers
good for nothing. The roller maker re
ported that u was almost impossible to
melt it for casting, and that it was only
by tiie use of excessive proportions ot
glycerine and syrup that he was enabled
to melt it at ail. Its appearance was
tough and hat hcry, audit had been cook
ed almost to a candied condition in pro
cess of manufacture. I o not think 1 ever
saw a tpofe mt'erior composition . The fore
man of the press room repurted that he
couldn't work it, and finding that we were
paying a very high price, 1 wrote to the
manufacturer rejecting 1,000 pounds re
ceived on the orders of my predecessor,
because it was worthless to us and about
twice the price paid for the best composi
tion. In reply to this came a letter from
Rounds, protesting against my action. His
letter I answered as follows:
"The composition you refer to as fur
nished by Mr. lieid on your order was
found on receipt and inspection to be in
ferior and nearly worthless, a careful in
quiry developed the fact that the roller
making department and press room had
been for some time embarrassed by the in
ferior composition furnished by Mr. Reid;
and as his prices were double those which
the largest and best roller-making houses
in the country charge for their very best
compositions, Mr. Reid's composition has
been rejected as of no use or value to this
ofliee. and awaits his order for disposal."
"One of the handsomest pres-es in the
press room was not a purchase, but a dis
covery. It was dug up. This Bullock
press was found since I came into office,
discarded and thrown away by my prede
cessor, in the basement of the old Globe
building, where it lay dismembered, and
rapidly rusting and going to ruin. In
another year it would have been only fit
for old iron. Captain liryan and Mr,
Sardo, foreman of the press room, said
that it was a better press than the new
and expensive one which had been bought
to supersede it; so I had it picked out of
the debris last Spring, gathered together
and brought up here. V hen its discon
nected parts were brought to this office
and exposed to view, covered w ith rust,
it looked as if it were injured beyond re
pair and valueless. We proceeded to clean
the pails, and after three months of labor,
including repdrs on journals and cog
w heels. 1 110 parts were declared ready and
worthy of ereetion in th" press you see
before you, and here it stands doing more
and better work and still capable of great
er results in every particular, than the
new press standing beside it, which cost
$22,000 and which was purchased upon
the written statement of the ex-publie
printer that it was necessary. The new
press never met the requirements of the
contract, has been less efficient in work
manship and speed than this, the old one,
which, it is said, was offered for sale for
$1,500, and w hich would now bring in any
market probably $12,000, and is worth
more than the new one, which cost $22,-
000. We have secured t ns of thousands
of dollars' worth of good machiuery in
this way this year.
Just after coming into office the fore
man of the stereotype room sent up a
requisition for 10,000 pounds of stereotype
metal. I sent for the foreman to come to
my room.
"You need stereotype metal," I asked;
"is there none in the building?" "Only
a little but what has been used," he said
"Where are the old plates?" inquired
"Oh, we never melt them over4" he said;
"we keep them."
1 investigated more particularly and
was astonished to find out that It was the
policy of the olfloe never to remelt the
tereotype plates, as is done in all private
printing offices. I wrote to the depart
ments about the works thus preserved,
ascertained that not one in 100 would
ever be needed again, and ordered all
plates not requested to be thrown out for
melting. So I have no stereotype metal,
and need none, and shall want none if J
stay here years. During the. two years
prior to my coming some '2-,000 worth
of stereotype metal was bought; since that
time I have bought none, but am using
old plates, of which the dollars are full.
The contract price for stereotype metal
had been, on an average, before I came,
one and a half cents per pound above the
regular open market price, and an inferior
metal was received, while tons of old
plates were lying in the vaults worthless
for any purpose except for remelting."
'I have before me," continued Mr.
Benedict, "a statement of tl a- expenditures
uf this office during the lineal year ending
June a0 last. While I took possession on
Sept. 13 of last year, there was no change
in the force or methods of the office until
Oct. 1. Practically speaking only four
months' supervision of the office during
the pa -t fiscal year was according to my
ow n methods and management. It should
be observed that purchases under contract
were made, in nearly every case, under
contracts made by my predecessor, many
of which were ;t Kites from 10 per cent
to per cent higher than the same arti
cle could be pu. chased in open market.
The force of operatives has been reduc
ed from an average of 2,400 at the time
of ray taking the office, to an average of
1. 'JaO during the past six months. This
smaller force was paid in wages during
July, August and September past about
lu,000 more than was paid in wages dur
ing the short, term of Congress in 1333,
and my force is now earning the largest
average wages ever earned in the office.
During the pad fiscal year there was
affected a saving of :Jl,75o.4l in miscel
laneous purchases, and $40,143.23 in litho
graphing and engraving. Savings were
made in numerous other directions
amountiug to tens of thousands of dollars,
not withstanding increased work required
by Congressional action, an 1 the obliga
tion of contract prices above current
market ju ices. The increased work of the
office during the last year was performed
at about $100,000 less co.st than the work
of the fiscal year previous.
To explain the savings, and give an ac
count m detail, would be a long story.
In general, jt may be stated that all pur
chases outside of contracts were made
from 10 to 73 per cent cheaper than here
tofoie, and a much larger result in work
produced. For the first time in the his
tory of this office, all trade discounts are
credited in the bill of purchases made,
and where straight prices were paid here
tofore, now discounts of 2i to 40 per cent
are allowed on important purchases.
Another saving has been effected in the
purchase of ink. During the fiscal year
ending June, 1385, the prico of ink ranged
from 30 cents to 83 cents per pound, and
$17. 33.'?. 20 wa paid for ink. Ninety per
cent of my ink purchases were made at
less than 20 cents per pound, and the total
erst of ink for the year was $3,22G.91,
which sum includes the cost of purchases
of over 4,000 pounds of ink by my prede
cessor during the first three mouths of the
fiscal year, for which he paid 40 cents to
$4 per pound.
1 he same is true of roller composition.
Iu 1834, 11,5(19 pounds of roller composi
tion at 45 cents, cost $0,255. During the
past year but 7,775 pounds of composition
was used, costing $2,318, ot which amount
my predecessor purchased 2,103 pounds,
at 43 cents per pound, while the remain
der was purchased by meat prices ranging
from 20 cents to 28 cents per pound.
These savings have not been effected by
the introduction ot inferior material, but
by the use of far better quality of mate
rial, the use of which show.-; that one-half
of the amount heretofore used produces
more and better work.
Aside from these effective results in the
work accomplished and t he savings through
purchases, I have increased the savings
from the gold sweepings in the bindery
from about $1,900 yearly to about $5,000
per year. The waste brass, copper, stere
otype metal and paper, I sell for more
than twice as much as they ever brought
before, netting tens of thousands of dol
lars' saving to the treasury."
Another remarkable statement was given
me by Mr. Benedict, the proofs of which
he can show me if I will spend some morn
ing at the Government printing office
when I have the time to devote to the in
vestigation. He says that during the Re
publican Administration of the office, a
number of Senators and members ordered
dead head work to be done for themselves,
amounting to thousands of dollars. One
Republican Senator hail 100 books rebound
for Lis private library in the handsomest
style, calling for costly material, such as
the Public Printer could not purchase un
der the law. Another had investigations
made, for his private use, by employees in
the office, which would have cost nim
thousands mt dollars if he had honestly
hired his own clerks. He said that other
Congressmen who were in business at
their homes, had their business circulars
and posters printed at the Government
Printing Office, at the expense otthe pub
lie. I shall accept Mr. Benedict's invita
tion to look further into this, and if he
will let me, I will publish the names of
the men referred to above. In justice to
Rounds and the people they ought to be
exposed. Mr. Benedict says:
"I acceposd this position in accordance
with a request of the President so earnest
that it was virtually a demand. He said
to me: "I am living in daily fear of
scandal breaking out in that oil;,.... The-,
must be a change at once." When I cam
here, he of course, expected tne toenl'oic.

I have devoted so much space to the
Public Printer because all the fads given
above were furnished me by Mr. Benedict
Saturday morning, and because 1 think
the. above would make a first class cam
paign document. 1 h ive plenty of other
news for you but none so important in all
its bearings as this. Your paper has been
among the foremost in endorsing the re
forms inaugurated by Mr. Cleveland, and
if the above showing is not the result of
radical reform I do not know w hat it is.
For thi", lea.son, I owe you and your read
ev no apology for occupying so much of
your space with the above facts and fig
ures. After this Congress will be here
and I will, of course, ha ve to take np a
column or two with politics and matter
of an entirely different sort.
One other point I neglected to make.
I have been told by several parties that
w hen Rounds came here he was a poor
man. Now I am told he is rich. His
money was probably made in this way.
He was a member of a firm in Chicago
which furnished printing materials. iVc,
lVc Nominally, he sold out to his part
ners when he became Public Printer, but
he retained interest enough ir. it, so I am
informed by several persons, to order a
great deal of the material specified above
from said firm! The deduction from Cits
statement is evident.

The farmer is often uncertain w hat

and grass that arc on the field, and which
are in his waj". It is more difficult to
pluw land that is covered wirh the refuse
of a previous crop, and it is so much
easier to burn it than to plow 11 under,
that many farmers apply tin- torch, and
destroy the life of their hind. The fol
lowing valuable article on the subject was
written by r. B. Baldwin, of lexas, and
published in the American Rural Home.
He says:
'"I was traveling in Texas and stopped
at night with a farmer of considerable
intelligence and some means. 1 asked
him why he burned his corn stalks. 1 It
replied, I burn them in order to get them
out of mv way. My land is so rich and
the soil so deep that ir does not need t he
assistance of vegetable matter to aid in
making a crop. 1 replied that just as fer
tile lands as his had succumbed to such
treatment in Indiana and Illinois, and
that it was only a question of time when
his)vn fertile acres would weaken under
such treat ment."
"Why," said he, "In the old States thev
almost cultivate their crops with lin-.
Thej- begin b' first culling down and
burning up everything that will burn.
and every year afterward thej burn what
ever stalks and grass that maj' be found.
upon the ground at plaid ing time.
"Yes, 1 answered, and in those Stales
where they once made a bale of cotton to
the acre, this and similar depleting prac
tices have so damaged the soil that it now
requires from two to four aires to make a
bale of cotton."
"He soon saw the truth of my argu
ment, and the following morning he told
me that he had thought much and serious
ly about what I termed his suicidal prac
tice, and that he had determined to banish
fire from his fields."
"There are thousands of farmers North
and South, whom 1 would be glad to con
vert from this wasteful practice of burning
the vegetable matter on their farms. Do
not burn anything, get a stalk of cotton
and a disc harrow, and after putting the
stalks, weeds and grass in proper shape
for plowing under, let j'or.r land have tlie
full benefit of every part lcle. I have seen
acres of excellent coat grass burned which
if turned would have been worth hundreds
of dollars to the next crop. Instead of
burning off anything, haul on more grass
and leaves and turn it all under. A re
cent writer says the torch has wrought
more ruin to farm lands iu the South than
all other causes. Many grain growers
burn their wheat and rice straw. Instead
of planting and plowing under peas, rye,
grass, lVc, they use the torch to destroy
the refuse from the previous crop. Al
most as well burn up the corn and wheat
with it."
All farmers are not so short-sighted.
Many are now now seeking to increase the
supply of vegetable matter instead of de
stroying it, and are making monej'.
It is about settled that "Wadesboro
will have a silk factory.
