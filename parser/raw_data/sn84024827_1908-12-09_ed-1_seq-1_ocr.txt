The southern Appalachian region Is
ot dfrect Industrial consequence, first
J for. what It can nroducc. Its chief
product is hard wood tlmberr- Appa-
lachtan states, north and south, pro
duce nearly all of our hard wood sup-
Pi-. Hard woods in otlior regions;
such as the Iako states and I.i the ow-
or Mfsslsslppi Valley,- grow upon agri
cultural' lands. Those lands will be
cleared' almost as fast as the timber
is cut The Appalachian region"
oa '
the other hand, except for the valleys .
is not
mainly agricultural. There-
fore. It Is the. only region which can
permanently yield hard wood timber.
It Is not now producing anything like
what It can produce, or anything like.
what the country need 4. It Is capa
ble of producing forty or fifty coble
feet of wood per acra per annum. On
account of fires and bad cutting, it is
probably not producing more than
ten. And we must -have hard woods
or sutTer for the lack of them. I could
not enumerate their uses in half a
day. The southern Appalachians fur
nish the source watere of a number
or impcrttnt river systems, fvhich ar
ford the possibilities of immense pow
prodUctlon. Tlte geological survey
finds that the southern Appalachian
streams will produce a minimum, of 2,-

oherpest, but it is most valuable to
those sections which have no deposits
of coal, and its advantages will stead
ily increase as the supply of coal
grows scarcer aud tUe price higher.
All the yvaters gathered in thd south
ern Appalachians llow to the sea
through navigeble channels. The
heavy rainfall and the steep slopes
lead to a very rapid run-off. Further
more, tlrere are no natural lakes for
storage. If the flow wore uniform the
amount of yvater d'scharged by these
streams is sufficient to make their Ini
liortance for navigation very high.
But the run-off is variable. Moreover,
the variability is increasing.
Kyery one of the southern Appa
lachian stream of which we have suf
ficient authentic record shows that
floods are more frequent and of great
er duration since tho watersheds have
been heavily cut and severely burned.
Excessive low waters, too, are increas
ing in length aud frequency! The
foiest was the onlv natural inllueuce
whicli tended to equalize the flow.
Even on steep slopes the forests serv-
ed the purpose of changing the water
from surface to underground drain-
( age. When the forest is cut away tlio
water instead of being absorbed lit
thrown off into streams la floods. With
the rush of water down the slopes the
soil is rapidly and steadily carrion
away. The soil which nature put up
on tbos fields has been washed awa.
and it.j.frecomes more and more dil-

Mr. Ach was vehement in delivery
and eloquent In his address. After
speaking for two hours bo became
exhausted as to be obliged to'agk the
court for the announcement of the
usual recess. In the course of hrs re
marks, 31r Ach saidr

all the testimony In the case.
Of Gal-
lagner he said:
"Mr. Heney Waa'too ablo an advo
cate to permit extensive cross exam
ination of Gallagher, and- he was wise
not to permit the defense to uncover
the souls of such men as Ga'Jagher
and Wilson. Gallagher, mastermind,
rotund, well fed, well educated, asplr-'
Ing to a place on the bench where he
could review the decisions of men
like Judge Lawlor. nothing more than
tire limb of the prosecution why a
parrott could do as well after " ten
lessons that Gallagher has had in
public, to say nothing of the coaching
ine Had from Hums anr Spreckles.
And Wilson, after he had testified
five tinit-". when lie had found that the
immunity contracts were a delusion
and a snare, when h's testimony did
not meet with the views of Heney an'1
the district attorney, when he lu
b-oen three times Indicted, when
found that the lion's maw could n
be filled with what he knew, then '
changed his testimony then he fe
in line.
"Ruef is the victim of a dastardly
plot, supported by the debauched and
.perjured" testimony of Gallagher and
Wilson. After your verdict is render
ed and after you jurymen are dls
charged I am going to. ask you -whether
or not you believed these witnesses of
the prosecution."
Mr. Ach declared that Gallagher
and Wilson still enjoyed tho fruits, of
briberies. In which they admitted be
ing engaged; and said the only reason
they had not refunded thousands of
dollars they had taken was that no
body had asked them to do so.
"Ton- mrve spoken six hours- anu

stituted the most vehement portion o
his address. Ii this connectich -h,,
