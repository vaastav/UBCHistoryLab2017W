THE BUCKET shops.
They are at last setting to work in
earnest in Chicago to enforce the law
prohibiting bucket -bops, and the
_hance_ are that those institutions of
Evil will soon be conspicuous by their
absence, For the bucket shop has no
excuse for existence whatever. It is a
gambling device, pure and .simple, and
as such .should come under the cogni
zance of the law as surely as the poker
room, the roulette tabic or the faro lay
out.
There is no intention or expectation
In the bucket shop of receiving or de
livering the goods which are pretended
to li« bought or sold. Acting in the dual
relation of agent and principal, the
bucket .shop proprietor in ostensibly
taking orders to buy or sell certain com
modities really only accepts a bet that
the prices of those commodities will go
higher or lower within a certain time.
lie differs from ordinary bookmakers in
being willing to bet either way, accord
ing to the fancy of his patron..
in its maintenance and inculcation of
the gambling spirit the bucket shop is
as perniciously active as any other un
lawful device whicii aims to procure
something for nothing for those who are
"lucky," and should be as vigorously
weeded out. Though in many minds
confounded in its operations with the
exchanges and boards of trade which
give opportunity for speculation, it is
radically different. On the exchange
there is actual buying and selling, and
while gambling is also possible even
there, it is only as an incident, and not
as an essential to the transaction of
regular business.
The backet shops have been a- re
sponsible as Goethe's "Weill, Weill unci
gesaiig"' for ruined homes and broken
honor, and the movement toward eradi
cating them has been started none too
soon.
Till] CASE OF -Mil. INGALLS.
"Senator Im. 1.1. now by tin- grace
of the Republican majority presiding
Officer of the senate, is a gentleman
from Kansas, the quality of whose elo
quence can defy the prohibition laws
of his adopted state, and whose more at
less superficial brilliancy, when di
rected toward the denunciation of fan
cied Democratic faults, has afforded
those of his faith much enjoyment .
But the caustic senator's professions
and performances do not well consort.
There was wont to be a time when the
employment by a Democratic official of
a fifth cousin in public place would have
caused the senator from Kansas to
shriek nepotism iv his shrillest tones.
But be is strangely silent now j
upon this particular subject, and
for good reason. The senator's sim
has been given by his indulgent father !
the one appointment he can make be- '
cause of his presidency of the sena le. and
the young man sees no reason win he
should feel ungrateful because little or
no labor accompanies the generous !
salary.
We fear thai by actions of this kind j
Senator Imvi.i.s will hardly swell to ]
goodly proportions the presidential '■
boom lie has been quietly cherishiim.for
the people who make presidents, while
they may not object to the appointment '
of deserving sons to official places by ,
their fathers, at least like to see con
sistency in a politician over-fond of
prating and boasting about that jewel
of a virtue.
IN SLEEPING CARS.
The -late railway commissioners have
been giving lately a gratifying evidence
of tlieir regard for the interests of the
traveling public, and tlieir latest com
munication to the railway managers will
be regarded *as favorably as any that
have have preceded it. The matter of
keeping the unoccupied berths in a
sleeping car closed may be a small one
to invite official attention, but it is not
Insignificant when the personal comfort
or discomfort it may involve is consid
ered.
The inflexible rale of the companies
has been to keep the upper berths
closed, the ions Intention being to
compel i lie traveler who requires only
one berth to purchase a section, or sub-
mil to be half-stifled, when by the exer
cise of a little common sense on the
part of the company the purchaser of
one berth could enjoy what he contracts
lor a comfortable bed. The annoy
ance of being compelled to occupy a
lower berth rendered practically airless
by the letting down of the unoccupied
upper berth is as great in winter, with
super-heated cars, as it is in summer
with an atmosphere stiflingly hot, ami
is at all tunes a nuisance that might
readily be avoided.
In compelling the closing of the upper
berths not in use no injustice can be
done the companies operating sleeping
cars, and the comfort of a vast number
of travelers will be ____________ It is
difficult to see what cause the railway
companies can allege for not ___■_*._ ing
with the -'ingestion- of the commission
ers, and their reply will be awaited
with interest. .-:**_...
THE MESSAGE.
The president's message is a model
state paper. It is commendable a3
much for what it doesn't . contain as for
what it does. The lopping off of the
wearisome details concerning the sev
eral governmental departments which
usually burthen presidential messages
is an agreeable innovation. The report
of the cabinet officers in charge of the
various departments usually contain all
that congress or the people care to
know, and it has long been a wonder
why successive presidents should con
tinue to weigh down their messages
with repetitions of these department re
ports.
Mr. vela x*_> confines his message
exclusively to a discussion of the tariff
and the finances because, as he says, he
is impressed with the paramount im
portance of these subjects at this time.
His arguments in favor of tariff
reduction are positively unanswerable.
lie indulges in no vain theoretical argu
mentation, but plunges right into a
practical discussion of matters which
most concern the public welfare. He
points out what a narrow escape the
country has recently had from financial
ruin. He demonstrates that this
menacing condition was the direct result
of a tariff system which drains the coun
try of money that ought to be in circu
lation and piles it up in the treasury to
lie there in idleness. He tells congress
plainly that the last resort lodged in the
executive to relieve a financial strain
ha. been exhausted. There an
no more 3 per cent bonds to
be called in. and consequently the exec
utive would be powerless to again avert.
an Impending crash by unlocking the
treasury. The peril which overhangs
the country is probably greater than
most i, us imagined, but after reading
the president's lucid statement of our
Guam condition we can have no
doubt of the reality ot the dangers
which environ us. If this message
doesn't cause the scales to fall from
the eyes of congress, then that body
is blind beyond all cure.
A most delightful feature of the pres
ident's message is its complete freedom
from partisan tinge or bias. It is a doc
ument which breathes with patriotism
from iH-ginning to end. Mr. Clkvk
laxii is as fair. too. as he is patriotic
and earnest, in a spirit of "let us sit
down and reason together," he gives
the protectionists the benefit of their
arguments and then proceed- to dissect
and disjoint them. If there is an Amer
ican citizen who. after reading the mes
sage Mr. Cleveland sent to congress
yesterday, is still an advocate of retain
ing the present tariff law, then that man
is proof against conviction.
THE COAL TYRANTS.
The extortionate price of coal gives
the general public some knowledge of
the tyranny exercised by the coal barons,
but it is limited in comparison with
what the miners have learned from their
harsh experience in being brought un
der the direct domination of the black
diamond royalty . Notwithstanding the
extraordinary rise in the price of coal,
the operators not only refuse to advance
the wages of the miners, but it is shown
from an appeal recently made to the
public by the managing committee of
the strike in the Lehigh valley, that
during the last decade the wages
of the anthracite coal workers
have been gradually reduced until
they are now down to an actual
starvation point. Accompanying the
appeal of the miners is a statement giv
ing a large number of cases illustrating
their grievances. Under the contract
system which the coal barons have
forced the miners to adopt the latter are
forced to provide their own .mining ma-
terial out of their earnings. The first
case pointed out is that of a miner whose
gross earnings for the month of Janu
ary. 1887, were $47.50. Under the con
tract system he had to pay out for pow
der, blacksmith bills, labor, the coal
that he used and incidental expenses in
the way of furnishing materials and
keeping his tools in repair, "*"":'. To, thus
leaving him only .14.75 for a full
month's net earnings. A recapitulation
shows that an average miners gross re
ceipts were *...*._._. his expenses in the
mine were .***■_"*. l7, leaving his net earn
ings at .*1.'."*..12, which presented an av
erage monthly earning of "**;•...*__. There
is another case stated where the gross
earnings For the month were $91.90, and
after paying tin* mine expenses under
his contract with the operators left
the miner only $10.55 as the net earn
ings for the month. In many other
cases the miner's cash balance at the
end of the month did not average a dol
lar, idle in more than one instance he
came out in debt to the company.
These startling figures bring us to a
full realization of the fact thai we have
right here iv our country a system of
oppressive serfdom even more cruel and
tyrannical in its operations than that
which curses Ireland and Poland. And
yet these oppressions are practiced un
der the protection of a government
which professes to be the asylum for all
earth's oppressed people. Isn't It about
time thai congress was taking steps to
crush out the revival of forms of feudal
oppression which tire springing up with
such alarming rapidity in our midst?
STRAY SI NT.i:\MS.
The brevity of Mr. ' i i:\i.i. ami's
message smacks of the rough-and-ready
style of (ten* Tayi.oi:. who disposed of

money gets loose it naturally flows in
this direction. .
Bexville, the chief of the Sisseton
tribe of Sioux Indians who is visiting
St. Panl, informed the Globe yesterday,
through Col. Bnowx as interpreter, that
the 1,500 Indians on his reservation had
all availed themselves of the severalty
law and had their lands properly allot
ted to them. The Indians of the Sisse
ton reservation, under the direction of
Bexville, have organized an amateur
republican government. They have
regularly established executive, judicial
and legislative departments. Bex
vij.i.k, the first chief of the tribe, is
governor, and enforces the laws which
his legislature passes. The Indian jus
tices interpret the laws and prescribe
penalties for all minor offenses. There
is also an efficient educational system in
force on the reservation.
*
It will be remembered that Bex ville
and his tribe remained friendly to the
whites during the Sioux outbreak in
1888-____-_d Uexvii.i.e himself rendered
valuable service to Gen. Sibley's com
mand as the leader of a band of Indian
scouts. I.i.n\'ii.i.i: is now an old man,
but still retains the erect carriage and
elastic step of his younger days. His
face denotes character and ability, and
he looks the typical brave that the fic
tion writers tells us of.
"There is only one thing to cloud my
declining days." said the venerable chief
as he sat in the GLOBE sanctum yester
day and communicated through his in
terpreter, "anil I am going to Washing
ton to ask the Ureal Father to clear
that away. There is a treacherous Sioux
we call Exocii who deserted our tribe
and joined in the war against the whites.
He was cruel and butchered your people.
When lien. Sibley captured the other
Indians Exocii made his escape,
and lied to the British dominions,
where he stayed until lately. Now he
conies back tad claims an allotment in
the Sisseton reservation. The agent
gave it to him. We don't want him with
us. He is seditious and gives us trouble.
I go to Washington to ask the Great
Father to take his laud from him and to
send him to the Devil's Lake reservation,
where he belongs. When Es<H H was
young we sent him to Ohio to school.
ii was bad for him. They couldn't
make a white man of him and they
spoiled him for an Indian. When he
came back to us he couldn't chase the
buffalo and he wouldn't chop wood."
The foolish talk which comes from some
(punters about ousting Mr. Ka.nuall is en
tirely out of place. Be occupies a valuable
place in congressional legislution,anda dozen
others could be lietler spared.
It will be observed that, despite the activ

Drought Out Yesterday.
Cincinnati. Dec. G.— The forenoon
session of the Harper trial was spent in

; Hoyt, the broker, made the somewhat
j startling statement that Benjamin E.
I Hopkins became, his creditor last .June

paid it. as Kershaw & Co. could not pay
him. Hoyt's account was transferred
to Wilshire, Eekert __ Co., by Hopkins'

with Harper, it was all with Hopkins.
Counsel for defense asked witness if he
did not know who was the principal in
these dealings. "Yes." said the wit

He Sold a Talking Dog.
Paris Paper.
Credulity has not often been exempli
fied more funnily than in a case which
has just come off in a police court here.
The keeper of a public boose told a long
story of how a customer came Into his
place and asked for a . book, his dog
taking a seat beside his master
and asking in a strange voice for "a
piece of meat"' for himself. The other
customer, astounded at hearing a dog
talk, recommended Boniface to buy the
animal, and to rechrlsteu the place
"The Talking Dog." The complainant
j took the advice and offered 400 francs
for the dog, who, on I hearing the bar
gain, cried out to his master;
"So you sell me, do you? Then I
shall not talk any more!"
The animal kept its word, and Boni
face could not get another syllable out
of him. At last it dawned upon him
that he had been made a fool of, and
happening to meet the vendor in the
garb of an acrobat at a fair, he
gave him into custody. When the "Poor
'layer" was brought up he confessed
that he was a ventriloquist, but pro
tested that he did not offer to sell his
dog. On the contrary, the landlord In
sisted on buying it, and, without any In
citement to do so, went up quickly in his
bids from 200f to _00f, throwing in the
refreshment which had been given to
man and beast. The case was dis
missed.
THE EDITORS' CIRCUS.
Will Appreciate Him Iv Future.
Yankton Herald.
The disposition of the people in some
localities in Dakota, notably the citizens
of Miller, to heap ignominy . upon the
late commissioner of the general land
office, by hanging him in effigy, is a dis
grace to themselves and a foul blot upon
the good name of the territory. While
the commissioner has no doubt com
mitted many errors in his honest and
rugged zeal to protect the public do
main from falling into the hands of
speculators, yet his honesty of purpose
in so doing has never been questioned.
Because a man holds to a distinctive
line of policy in the administration of a
public duty," and has the integrity and
manhood to carry out his honest convic
tions in spite of all opposition, is no rea
son why he should be publicly stigma
tized in such a disgraceful manner.
Sparks lias done many things that the
people will yet come to appreciate, that
will far overbalance all mistakes he has
made through Incompetent clerks, for
whose acts he is held responsible.
Work for McClure's Goddess.
Yankton Herald.
The eyes of the people of all the Da
kotas are now turned toward the coming
Aberdeen convention as the proper
body to settle the vexed question of di
vision and admission. The meager ma
jority in the whole territory for division
proves plainly that had the anti-division
Democrats recognized the validity of
this election and gone to the polls, the
. divisionists would have been snowed
under to the tune of thousands, without
I counting the farmers who did not take
sufficient interest to go to the polls and
cast their ballots against the measure.
To Aberdeen we must now look lor the
materialization of some non-partisan
plan that will enable Col. Met lure's
goddess to complete the tilling in of
those lacking three letters.
Only a Slight Difference.

The St. I'aul Globe has the versatile
ex-governor of this satrapy on the hip,
and continues to drive home the ques
tions about Pierces defiance of law and
disregard of the will of the people in
service of the corporations and rings.
Pierce has not seen lit to deny or apolo
gize, and be can't do either. Hence he
avails himself of the constitutional right
protecting every citizen from bearing
testimony against himself. There is no
doubt that Fierce stabbed the better
part of the Republican aggregation of
Dakota under the fifth rib while be
smiled upon them and saluted them.
He ought to have grown rich— but,
while pursuing the exact tactics of his
shrewder predecessor. Ordway, he
lacked the nerve to rake in the boodle.
That was all the difference.
A New Name For It.
Chamberlain Democrat
Cheeky Pierce cant sleep these nights
because the present administration is
determined to collect taxes from the
railroads. Why he goes to the extreme
of trying to rob the honest taxpayer to
benefit railroad corporations is beyond
comprehension, but it again serves to
illustrate that the Democratic party is
the friend of the masses. Pierce is help
ing neither himself nor his party by
championing the cause of monopolies in
. direct conflict with the best interests of
the territory.
Dakota Must Wait.
Richmond (Va.) Whig (Den).
The Democrats lost the election in
1870 by the admission of Colorado, and
they are not likely to forget that fact
when the strongly Republican territory
of Dakota asks for immediate admission.
The matter can be put off without detri
ment to anybody for another year, and
i t will almost certainly be done.

Swallowed His Teeth.
Buffalo Express.
A short tune since a man was taken
to one of the hospitals suffering intense
pain. He informed the doctors that his
home was down in the country and that
if he should die be wished to be sent
tliere. The physician asked him
what he supposed caused the
pain. "Why, 1 swallowed my plate and
four false teeth while asleep the other
night.*' was the answer. The patient
was put upon liquid food and all the |
examinations made by the medicos
failed to locate the swallowed article.
The man's sufferings were lessened con
siderably and as a test it was decided to
five him a little piece of beefsteak,
This was done and the poor patient was
writhing in agony as soon as he had
swallowed a mouthful. "Oh, my God!"
he exclaimed, "this is killing me! I
know I shall die!" and numerous other
such . speeches. The physicians and
nurses could hardly keep him In bed,
he suffered so much. Again he broke
forth in exclamations. This time he
said: "Oh, how I suffer! I can feel
the teeth tearing my stomach apart!
Oh—,'* he did not finish until a nurse
opened a telegram from his wife. It
read: "Found teeth under bed." The
suffering man, who had swallowed those
teeth, got up and dressed, paid his bill
anil left the hospital without a word.

Whiting had the advantage from the
start, and alter the fourth round it was
simply a question of how long Ryan
could endure the terrible punishment
he was receiving. He was battered
until he seemed a mass of blood, and
finally, in the fifteenth round, was too
weak to regain his feet after tepeated
knockdowns. It was a most brutal ex

GOLD AND SlXiYf.lt NOVELTIES
Anchors, C.irdles, Pocketbook s,
Walking Sticks and Toilet Arti
cles.
Some of the new suspender buckles
are enameled, while others are studded
with gems. Of sj»ecial interest to men
is the new necktie fastener in silver.
with a pin attachment.
Sapphires and rubies are all the rage.
The former, surrounded by brilliants
and mounted on a slender gold wire
setting, are much sought after for finger j
rings." The sapphire also figures con
spicuously in marquise and cluster j
rings.
Silver girdles are out in new and j
pleasing patterns. Many of these bor
row ideas. not actual copies, of the '
Orient, and are decidedly barbaric in i
effect. Enamel in dark red. green and
blue shades figures in the decoration of
many of these girdles, as do moon
stones, garnets and Mexican opals.
The moonstone, which had such a suc
cessful run in silver jewelry last sea
son, is likely to prove equally success
ful during the season to come in gold
jewelry. Fine stones, elaborately en
graved, serve as the central gem to
pendants and brooches, and are usually
encircled with diamonds.
In ladies' pocketbooks the new style
is the medium long, narrow leather one,
slightly curved at the bottom so as to
render it convenient to clasp in the
hand. These pocketbooks are trimmed
with pieced work in silver, and are an
improvement in every respect on the
long shapes, as first introduced.
Silver anchors, introduced abroad at
the time of the queen's jubilee, have
been made here to serve as brooches and
charms. Some seen recently were per
fect copies of yachts' anchors in every
detail. As yet the anchor is more popu
lar as a model in Xew York than is the
old-time cross, but few of the latter
have appeared in stock.
Sliver articles for writing desks
abound. . There are silver rules, muci
lage bottles hi repousse work, silver
stamp holders on the principle of the
old coin holders, etched boxes for hold
ing pens, cut glass ink bottles in silver
stands, letter weights, etc. Writing
pads, portfolio and other leather goods
are out ornamented ;in pierced work in
silver, which is very effective.
For travelers have been provided
many conveniences, among which may
be cited silver folding cups inclosed in
a case, in the top of which appears a
compass. Then mere are silver cases
for tooth brushes, boxes for soap, and
woven silver chain bags for sponges,
lined with oil skin. Match safes, liquor
flasks and tiie like, in silver, show new
patterns and are some of them etched
in suggestive designs.
Walking sticks and umbrella handles
out for the fall trade prove that silver
finish of one kind or another remains in
favor. Nacural crooks and crutches of
wood or buckhorn, covered with silver
deposit, remain one of the leading
styles, it. is quite the fashion this sea
son for gentlemen to have sticks
brought home from their summer expe
ditions, mounted to older. In some
cases the patron draws his own design.
or, if he be of a mechanical turn of
mind, he carves the top of his stick and
has it covered with a silver deposit.
Numbered with toilet articles lik ly
to please everybody, are the new pin
cushions in round, oval and other
shapes, which open and disclose a silver
powder box. or jewelry case. Silver cases
for courtplaster are now made with
folding scissors attached, a convenient
arrangement. Silver boxes, copies of
richly carves old Nurembtirg cases, are
offered as bonbon boxes, hairpin recep
tacles and trinkets. Little pocket pin
cushions that are having a big sale rep
resent a daisy or other flower, in silver,
enameled, the cushion part being neatly
sandwiched inside the flower.
The novelties now being shown in the
retail houses, in silver tableware, bric
a-brac, etc., are numerous enough to re
quire a volume for detailed description.
Only a hint or two about some of the
things that are attracting especial at
tention can be given here. Silver
mounted glassware. Doultou salad
bow Is and claret jugs are out to meet an
increasing demand for these articles.
Cameo glass, which heretofore has been
reserved for purely decorative articles,
is now made in pepper and salts, salad
bowls and the like, with silver trim
mings. These articles clearly indicate
the tendency to combine silver and
glass, and silver and porcelain again in
one article.
RUSSIA!. EXECUTIONS.
How Two Mohammed Were
Put to Death— Seven Out of a
Dot Reprieved at the- Last Mo
nfent — Washed in the Sea After
Death.
I referred the other day to the con
demnation to the scaffold of fourteen
peasants of Penza as an illustration of
the permanent and general character of
the severe measures, which were orig
inally intended by the Russian govern
ment to be temporary and local, for the
suppression of purely political crimes,
says a St. Petersburg correspondent of
the London Times. But ordinary crim
inals are now being executed in all
parts of the empire. This is an
innovation in the Russian criminal code,
and is opposed to the religious feelings
of the masses. It was owing to the re
pugnance felt on this score and the
commiseration expressed by the lower
orders for political prisoners during
their processions through the capital to
the scaffold that public executions for
political crimes were stopped and the
greatest secrecy maintained with re
gard to them. The authorities, how
ever, now make a distinction in this re
spect between political and ordinary
criminals, the latter being publicly exe
cuted.
The following is an account of an
execution of two Mohammedans in the
I Caucasus. Great lawlessness prevails
I in the Caucasus, and traveling iv that
j interesting country is by no means un
attended with danger both to life and
property. Especially does this apply to
he northern part, where the people,
notably the bill tribes of Daghestan,
have not yet become reconciled to Rus
sian rule" and its civilizing influences.
The men in question were natives of
Teyrel, which borders on Daghestan,
and their crime was highway robbery
with murder. They belonged to a band
consisting of nine men. all of whom
were condemned to be hanged. The
criminals, secured by fetters, were
brought to the place of execution under
a military guard, with drum and fife
music, and were accompanied by a mul
lah. The sentence of death was form
ally read and seven of them obtained a
reprieve, their sentence being commuted
to bard labor in the mines for life.
These prisoners were then marched off
the ground, leaving only two brothers
who were to suffer death.
After the inollah had exhorted the
condemned they requested that he
would read out of the Koran the prayers
for the dead, and this request was ac
ceded to. They then took leave of the
inollah and embraced each other, after
which their fetters were taken off by
the executioner, who put shrouds on
them and led them to the scaffold. They
remained hanging for the space of half
I an hour, and their bodies were then
i handed over to their relative- for bur
ial. During the execution these rela-
I tives and friends of the condemned
! men were busily engaged in cutting up
| on the spot the carcass of an ox for dis
■ tribution among the spectators, in ac
| cordance with the custom prevailing
! among the mountaineers of the Terek
j region.
The bodies of the executed men were
! then placed face down on the ground,
and after being washed in the sea— the
execution took place on the seashore—
they were robed in new shrouds and
placed on arbas (native carts) for con
veyance to their native village in the
mountains of Terek. The execution,
which was witnessed by a large and
motley crowd, took place at the town of
IVtrofsk. a small and highly picturesque
sheltered harbor in the Caspian sea.
Should capital punishment in Russia
become general, as seems likely, it
would be well for the authorities to in
troduce a less primitive and more pain
less mode of carrying it into effect.
The last batch of political prisoners ex
ecuted in public in St. Petersburg were
simply strangled by the weight of their
bodies. The condemned was mounted
on a wooden stool and a noose put
! around his neck, the rope being at its
■ full tension. On a given signal tin
stool was kicked away, and the body
swung round, the struggles of the tor
tured wretches continuing in some
cases, according to those who timed
! their sufferings, for over ten minutes.
Buffalo Bill's "Orator."
Most people who have been to the
I "Wild West*' show at Earl's court, says
i the British Medical Journal, must have
been struck by the enormous vocal
power displayed by Mr. Richmond, the
' "orator,"' Tbe voice of this modern
stentor is a physiological curiosity iv
its way, for he has often made himself
distinctly heard by an audience of MO,
--000 persons in the open air. This
throws Mr. Gladstone's famous "record"
at lilackheath in 1874 altogether into
the shade. Some idea of the vast amount
; of work which the -'orator" gets out of
j his vocal organs may be formed from the
i fact that his running commentary on
the show contains more words than
the part of Hamlet, which, as is well
known, taxes the powers of the best
trained actors. This severe effort the
"orator" makes— and makes success
fully—twice a day for months together,
under much less favorable acoustic con
ditions than players even in the largest
theaters. His vocal cords are of ordi
nary length, and not much above
the average in breadth, but the
vocal processes at once strike the
observer by their extraordinary de
velopment. The "orators" vital
capacity is not above the ordinary
standard, but what breath power he has
he utilizes to the utmost with the art of
a trained elocutionist. Mr. Richmond,
we believe, was on the stage before he
occupied his present position, and the
secret of his remarkable delivery lies
more in the perfection with which he
has learned to use his natural advant
ages than in any notable peculiarity of
physical conformation.

A BEAUTY PARLOR.
A Modern Equivalent io Ponce de Leon's
Spring of Eternal Youth.
VENUSES MADE TO ORDER.
Homely Women Transformed Into Pretty
Creatures— Scrawny Forms Devel
oped—Ladies. "Made Up."
Chicago News.
TAKE up over
4.000 persons
every day," said
the genial young
man who runs the
elevator in a lead
ing office building,
"and a good share
of them are wo
men."
Now. though the
elevator boy did
not say so, it is
asily determined that the destination
fa goodly number of these is the fifth
floor, on which a beauty parlor sign is
prominent.
A beauty parlor, as every lady knows,
is a modern equivalent to Ponce de
Leon's spring of eternal youth. It has
not been definitely learned that the lady
with the French prefix to her name who
runs the parlor is in possession of that
stupendous revolving pillar of fire in
whose luminous rays "She*" bathed and
crystallized into perpetuity the trans
cendant beauty of her form and face,
but it is certainly true that though plain
women go into tiiis beauty parlor, none
but pretty ones come out. " It is not as
serted that for the price of $1 a Dame
Durden can be made into a Cleopatra,
but it is certain that Dame Durden can
look much more bewitching than is her
wont.
To begin with. Dame Durden. ten to
one, does her hair up in the awkward
est manner possible, and one of the first
things that will be done to her will be
to take her hair down, comb it out so
that the general shape can be deter
mined, and then undergo a ret wist ing
and combing, a rebraiding and curling,
with the hair massed where it will best;
develop all the beauty she may possess.
It is wonderful what a difference it will
sometimes make upon Dame Durden to
comb her hair in the right way. It may
be possible also — so inconsiderate is nat
tire—that Dame Durden's hair is not of
the most becoming tint, in which un
happy event the guardian of beauty
once more comes to the rescue and
gives Dame Durden golden locks to
match her eyes of blue,or ebony locks to
suit her eyes of black, or auburn locks
to warm her eyes of gray.
Sometimes a bleach is used and some
times a dye. in either case the liquid
is rubbed and brushed well in. until
every hair is of the same tint. The
dyes and bleaches used are not only
harmless, but beneficial, in so much as
they cause the hair to grow more rap
idly than is its usage, and make it nec
essary, therefore, for Dame Durden still
to apply material to the roots of her
hair.
"Ladies arc very apt to overdo tha
matter," said the lady professional,
"and to use the bleach again until their
hair gets brassy in tint. If they would
let me apply it once and stop, there
would be a beautiful blonde color, with
golden lights in it. The eyebrows and
lashes can be made the color of the hair,
of course. We also restore lashes and
brows when they become thin, unless,
indeed, they have been destroyed by
tire or disease, whicii makes restoration
impossible.
''Besides attending to the hair we de
velop the form and beautify the face. A
great many American women are
troubled with a lack of development.
To bring about the desired result it i..
necessary to devote about forty minute.,
a day to the treatment. We will do the
treating if desired, but a lady can do i.
every bit as well herself. All it needs
is perseverance. We sell the entire out
fit for _8.
"There are other ways in which we
develop the form also. For instance,
we have a balm which fills out sunken
cheeks and the hollows above the breast
bone. The balm creates adipose tissue,
and the oft-repeated rubbing soon
makes a healthy accumulation of flesh.
"As to the face, almost anything can
be done with it. If the skin is sallow or
freckled, or disfigured with niolh. wo
can apply a wash which will remove the
entire outer skin and regrow a skin of
line, beautiful quality and of delicate,
pure tint, lt causes more or less pain.
Some ladies stand it very well, but oth
ers go nearly crazy with the suffering.
I always tell them all about it. and hen,
if they want to undertake it, they do it
on their own responsibility. It is no.
injurious in any way, and beyond the
smarting sensation no unpleasantness
attaches to it. Elevated moles we re
move with the electric needle, and that
is disagreeable in the way that all (dee
trie shocks are."
"Do you make up ladies for theater
parties and balls?"
"Ob. yes; constantly. We made up
several ladies for the Cleveland recep
tion the other evening. After the bait
is becomingly done we tint the cheeks
and the lips and whiten the skin. Then
we curve the brows and widen the eyes
by delicately lining the lids with black.
The tii> of the chin and the outer edges
of the ears are daintily touched with
pink. If a lady has a line nose we put
a trifle pink in the nostrils, and a very
little is put on the upper part of the
lids. Then we polish the neck and arms
and whiten the hands. We have a
j balm which makes the hands white,
i and which most of our customers use
continually"'
"We have a set of regular patrons,
'■ most of whom are society ladies. Now
'. that we are open evenings, however,
j the shop girls begin to come— like
| to look as well as any one. In prepar
ing faces for a party we usually go to
I the house, and frequently have half it
■ dozen ladies to operate on at the same
I place. This week we have a bride to
•'beautify and intend doing ; n excep
tionally fine piece of work on her.
"Any one who uses our face wash,'
; said the" beauty maker, "and permits
' the change of skin to take place no
■ longer needs to use cosmetics. We take
! out wrinkles very successfully, and
i always advise our patrons of the best
| way to avoid wrinkles. We can help
1 pimples to an extent, but such affec
tions are apt to need it physician's
superintendence, and should be doc
tored from the inside instead of the
outside. We ate very cautious not to
j injure the health of our patients in any
way.''
Just then a petite brunette entered.
"This lady has used our face wash,"
said the madame.
"Was it disagreeable?" asked the re
porter. -
■•No,'" replied the young lady, sweet
ly; "1 didn't mind it much. I bad a ter
rible complexion, and 1 felt it was worth
while to go to a little trouble for a bet
ter."
Certainly her rounded cheeks were as
clear an olive as could well be found.
She retired behind the pretty screen
that divided the room in twain. and tho

DOUBTED.
When a pair of red lips are upturned to voce
owu
With no oue to gossip about it,
Do you pray for endurance to let them alone?
\\ ell, maybe you do— but 1 doubt it.
When a sly little baud you're permitted to
seize,
With a velvety softness about it.
Do you tbiuk you can drop it with never a
squeese?
Weil, maybe you can— but I doubt it.
When a tapering waist is in reach of your
arm.
With a wonderful plumpness about it.
Do you argue the point 'twixt the good and
! lit- harm -
Well, maybe you do— but I doubt it.
And if by these tricks you capture a heart.
With a" womanly sweetness about it,
Will you guard it . and keep it and act tho
"good part?
Well, maybe you will— but I doubt it.
