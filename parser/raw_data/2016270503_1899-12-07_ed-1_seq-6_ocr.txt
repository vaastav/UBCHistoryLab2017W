"Uncle Tom's Cabin," Gilbert and Sul

Poll's this evening, to take the fore
most place as to phenomenal runs.
This ever blooming show piece starts
in this season on its eighteenth year
before the public; while tne other at

fects, become more and mure a favor
ite each year. The public appreciate
the fact that, while its title may be

WORK IN TBE SENATE
Secretary Boot's Nomination
Confirmed Flood of Bills.
ALDRICH PRESENTS FINANCE MEASURE
Qnay'i Case to Be Considered Reci
procity Treaties Presented Pro
motion Kor Many Army Offlcers
Recommended by McKinley.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. The senate
spent half an hour in executive session
yesterday, but beyond the confirmation of
Secretary Root and the reference to com
mittee of the numerous nominations sent
in yesterday transacted no business. Mi-.
Root's nomination was referred to the
committee on military affairs and imme
diately reported back and confirmed.
There was no opposition to immediate ac
tion. Nearly 800 bills and joint resoh-iions,
several important concurrent resolutions
and petitions numbering hundreds were
presented to the senate. Some of the
bills a majority of them, in fact were
old stagers which had been introduced in
the last eonrre?s or in previous congress
es. A vast number of them wore of mi
nor importance, but a few were of na
tional interest and consequence.
Mr. Aldrich had the honor of introduc
ing the, first measure in the senate. It
was the financial bill drawn by the sen
ate committee on finance, of which Mr.
Aldricll is chairman, and probably was
the most important measure introduced
during the day.
A meeting of the senate committee on
privileges and elections has been called
for today to consider the protest against
the seating of Senator Quay upon the
appointment of the governor of Pennsyl
vania and the memorial urging the un
seating of Senator Clark of Montana and
Senator Scott of West Virginia because
of alleged irregularities in their respec
tive elections. It is improbable that an
order will be made for tlv taking of tes
timony in the Clark and Scott cases and
that there may thus occur, some delay in
their consideration. No evidence will,
however, be taken in the Quay case, and
for this reason a snore speedy disposition
of it will be secured. Only legal points
will be considered in the Quay case, and
both sides of the controversy will be rep
resented by counsel.
The reciprocity treaties negotiated dur
ing the congressional recess were trans
mitted to the senate and in the executive
session wfe ordered printed and re
ferred to the committee on foreign rela
tions. The most important of these treaties is
that between the United States and
France for reciprocal reductions in tar
iff rates. The terms of this and the oth
er treaties" are not yet officially made
public either by the state department or
the senate.
The president sent the following nomi
nations to the senate:
Heaton W. Harris of Ohio to be consul
at Mannheim, Germany.
Brigadier General Leonard Wood, V
S. V.. to be major general of volunteers.
Colonels to Be Brigadier Generals
Edgar R. Kellogg, Sixth United States
infantry; Gilbert S. Carpenter, Eight
eenth United States infantry; William A.
Kobbe, Thirty-third United StRtes infan
try, and J. Franklin Bell, Thirty-sixth
United States infantry.
Minister and Wife Shot.
RACINE, Wis., Dec. 7. Rev. David
Cheney of the First Baptist church and
his wife were shot by a burglar yester
day at their home on Lake avenvie. Mrs.
Cheney was shot in the breast. The ball
glanced downward and is believed to
have lodged in her left lung. Mr. Cheney
was shot in the abdomen and in the cen
ter of the breast. Both are in a critical
condition. The desperate burglar escap
ed. A large posse of police officials and
private citizens is scouring the country
for him. The city is all excitement. If
he is caught, it is believed the law will be
powerless to prevent his being lynched.
Rev. David B. Cheney is one of the best
known Baptist preachers in the state.
He has occupied pulpits at La Crosse
and Superior for several years and was
president of the A. P. A. of the state.
Germans Lllie tbe Message.
BERLIN, Dec. 7. The German gov
ernment and press almost unanimously
welcome President McKmley's message
to congress. Even the Agrarian papers,
always opposed to things American,
grudgingly admit that the message is fair
and honest. The drift of private com
ment is virtually the same. In the lobby
of the reichstag similar sentiments were
expressed without reserve by members of
every shade of political conviction. Em
peror William, it is reliably reported, had
a long consultation yesterday afternoon
with Count von Buelow, the foreign min
ister, and expressed himself as much
pleased with President McKinley's atti
tude toward Germany.
' Juice Johnson Resigns.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 7. The Hon.
C. S. Johnson, United States judge for
the district of Alaska, is said to have re
signed. Trustworthy information to this
effect came on the steamer Dirigo, which
arrived from Juneau, where Judge John
son has been holding court for a month
past. No special reason is. assigned for
his action, though' some of his friends in
this city say he resigned in order to en
gage in the practice of his profession and
mining ventures at Cape Nome.
Mazetters Suspend Operations.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. The Mazet as
sembly investigating committee has held
its last session. Mr. Moss, late yester
day, after a conference with Chairman
Mazet and Mr. Cestello, said that it had
been decided to hold 00 more sessions.
This announcement was made after the
committee's failure to get a quorum at
a hearing in parlor 74 of the Aator
House.
Cooper's Slayer Sentenced.
PENN YAN, N. Y., Dec. 7. George
Shoemaker, who on the night of April 6,
1899, shot and killed Charles Cooper, was
arraigned in supreme court yesterday aft
ernoon and pleaded guilty te manslaugh
ter in the first degree. This plea District
Attorney Kimball accepted. Justice Dun
well then sentenced him to ten years in
Auburn state prison.

COLEMAN'S HORRIBLE DEATH.
Further Details of the Awful Crime at
'' Maysville.
Maysvllle, Ivy; Dec 7. The dreadful
spectacle of burning Richard Coleman
at the Stake occurred on the peaceful
cricket groundd . on tb?. outskirts
of this, one of the oldest and among the
proudest cities of Kentucky. The bar
barities inflicted . upon this young negro
are almost beyond belief and can only be
accounted for by the intense horror cre
ated by long consideration of the atro
cious crime of which full confession had
been made by. Coleman. Just two months
ago Richard Coleman, the trusted em
ploye' of Farmer James Lashbrook, in a
manner peculiarly-atrocious murdered the
woman who had befriended bim.
Coleman was not;only employed on the
farm, but had been installed as a house
servant-and ' was trusted implicitly by
both ;Mr. Lashbrook and his wife. On
the 'day of the murder Mr. Lashbrook
was at . work some distance from the
house.- of which Coleman was left in
charge. 1 , ' f '
The trial was set'fpr yesterday. Sheriff
Ferrine determined to leave Covington
by the Chesapeake and Ohio train which
started at 7:30 o'clock Wednesday morn
ing from .Cincinnati. Sheriff Perrine,
while en route to Maysviile, had been in
formed that a mob. was awaiting the ar-
' rival of the train at the depot, and he
j hastily prepared for, the sweairing in of
deputy ,; sheriffs. As the train pulled
I slowly into the old station the mob
formed on, both sides. Armed men sta
tioned themselves at the platforms of all
the cars and warned the frightened pas
sengers to remain quiet and not to inter
fere. The sheriff and his assistants were
strongly armed, and there was some re
sistance as the leaders of the mob jostled
roughly against thjru and demands were
uttered from. , the ,puter fringes of the
crowd for the prisoner.
Sheriff Perrine made a bold movement
and started walking .swiftly but with no
indications- of panic- from the car. A
step behind him followed the officers
with Coleman in their midst, seeking to
conceal himself behind the forms of his
protectors. - As the officers proceeded the
numbers of the mob constantly swelled
by new arrivals, and through the down
town business streets to the courthouse
they were closely followed.
Hundreds of stones and other missiles
were ' thrown, and revolvers and rifles
were freely displayed. The prisoner was
frequently struck, .and he presented a
frightful - appearance, blood streaming
from wounds on his face and head. At
the courthouse a mob of over 2,000 men,
headed by James -Lash-brook, the hus
band, -had been- hastily formed. The de
mand for the prisoner was made, accom
panied 7 by threats from the leaders.
.there was a brief struggle, in which
weapons were hastily drawn by the offi
cers, and then the, sheriff and his assist
ants were overcome by force of numbers,
and the prisoner, was pulled from their
midst. Up through the center portion of
the town the moJtmarched, the prisoner
being held by the vanguard and dragged
along- with the aid of ropes loosely at
tached to his body. .,.
The, place of ' execution had been se
lected weeks ago, in accordance with all
the other arranged details of . the pro
gramme mapped out by the leaders of the
mob, i . The prisoner was dragged to the
sapling and. strapped against the' tree,
facing the husband of the victim. Large
quantities of dry brush and larger bits
of wood were piled around him. while he
was praying for speedy death. James
Lashbrook, the husband of the victim,
applied the first match.
During -the . process, while his voice
could be heard, he begged for a drink of
water ; At the end of three hours the
body was' practically cremated. During
all that time members of the family of
Mrs.1 Lashbrook. -had remained to keep
up th. fire and keep the body in a posi
tion where it wouldj continue to burn. It
is said. that on the march through tho
city the 'prisoner's- eyes had been burned
out by Cid thrown in an eggshell. In
all the thousands who constituted the
mob -there was not a single effort made
to disguise or conceal identity. No man
wore a mask. .,'.

Grand Army of the Kepnhlic to Meet
In Cnlcaaro Ana-. 38.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. The meeting of
the national, council of the Grand Army
of the Republic and the local general
committee closed last night with a dinner
and a reception to the visitors given by
the department of Illinois G. A. R.. the
Woman's Relief Corps and ladies of the
Grand Army in honor of Commander
Shaw and National President Harriet J.
Bodge of the W. R. C. The dinner was
served at the Palmer House and was fol
lowed by a reception in the general par
lors of the hotel. ' At the dinner Com
mander In Chief Shaw, in speaking of
the next encampment, said:
"Doubtless-the president of the United
States will be in attendance, as well as
other leading men of the nation. Admiral
Dewey, who is a great favorite with the
Grand Army, has been invited and will
no doubt be here as the guest of the city
of Chicago and the Grand Army com
bined. The Grand Army is very proud
especially that portion embraced in the
navy of the great admiral, and he has
become beloved by all members of the
Grand. Army by his great deeds during
the recent conflict."
Commander Shaw said Chicago's cen
tral location, the patriotism aroused by
the success of American arms in the
Spanish-American war, the happy" expan
sion of the flag, the great interest in the
Filipino war, with good business feeling
everywhere; .";will combine to make this
encampment a notable gathering.
The date for the encampment has been
fixed from Aug. 28 to Sept. 1.

tary of the navy has transmitted to the
senate a report made by Rear Admiral
O'NeiL .upon the -subject of armor plate

BOERS VERY ACTIVfc
Heavy Cannonade Continues

J
ESEMY MASSED BEFORE KIMBERLEY.
Details at the Sortie Show It to Rave
Been a," Serlons A flair Jounert
Said to Have Retired From Com- -It)
and on Acoonnt ot Illness. ..
LONDON, Dec 7. Again there is a
complete lull in news from the seat of
war. Ladys'mith has established helio
graphic communication with Frere, and
it is reported that all was well up to
Sunday. A disuatch from the Boer laa
ger by way of Lourenco Marques, dated '
Thursday, Nov. 20, confirms the report
that the commandoes have been closing
in upon Ladysmith and mounting big
guns in new positions. According to the
same advices, a heavy cannonade had
been maintained, and a general assault
had been ordered for Thursday morning,
but was countermanded at the last mo
ment. Modder River dispatches say that the
Boers are encamped amid the hills half
way to Kimberley, but it is also asserted
that a large body of the enemy has gone
in the direction of Jacobsdal. It is pos
sible therefore that Lord Methuen may
endeavor to clear his right flank as far
as Jacobsdal before continuing his ad
vance. He is still wailing at Modder
River for stores, guns and ammunition.
The sortie from Kimberley on Nov. 25
appears to have been much more serious
than had been supposed. Details are
now arriving of a reconnoiseance in force
by mounted troops under Colonel Scott
Turner at dawn in the direction of a
ridge near Carter's farm, where the
Boers were strongly intrenched. Finding
the Boer pickets asleep. Colonel Scott
Turner proceeded along the ridge under
cover and rushed the Boer redoubts at
5:25 a. m. in the face of a hail of bullets.
The Boers hoisted a white flag and
fired at the British under its protection
before surrendering. Owing possibly to
the exhaustion of their ammunition, the
British were unable to follow up the at
tack and to seize a large Boer laager
about 300 yards ahead, especially as
Boer re-enforcements were seen ap
proaching and the enemy was keeping
up a heavy fire from the shelter of the
thick brush.
During the sortie an armored train re
connoitered north and south, while a con
siderable force of British, with field guns
and Maxims, advanced toward Spytfon
tein, holding the Boers in check in that
direction.
The guns were engaged simultaneously
and, viewed from the conning tower, an
artillery duel seemed proceeding in ev
ery direction, except toward Ivenilworth,
the fusillade being terrible. At 8 o'clock,
having no force sufficient to hold the po
sition he had stormed, Colonel Scott
Turner began gradually retiring his men.
He had a horse shot under him, and a
bullet went through the fleshy part of
his shoulder. Several men had terrible
wounds.
It is alleged that the Boers used Mar
tinis and explosive bullets and that they
frequently fired at the British ambulance
wagons. The British captured 28 of the
enemy.
Jonbert Not In Command.
PRETORIA, Dec. 3, via Lourenco
Marques, Dee. 0. General Joubert is in
disposed and has arrived at Volksrust,
across the Transvaal border, not far
from Charlestown, In the extreme north
of Natal, for medical treatment.
A dispatch from the head laager, where
General Schalk Burger is in supreme
command during the absence of General
Joubert. announces that a council of war
was held on Dec. 2 with reference to as-v
vaulting Ladysmith. The state attorney
has arrived at the camp to advise the
Boer commanders. Everything is quiet
at Ladysmith.
Dispatches from the west report that
there was a heavy artillery duel at Mafe
king during the morning of Dec. 2. All
is quiet at Kimberley.
Comfortable wood and iron houses have
been erected at Waterfall, a few miles
from Pretoria,, for the rank and file of
the British prisoners.
Count Deville Leblois, a colonel in the
French army, lias joined the Transvaal
forces as an authorized military attache.
Hot Bombardment at Ladysmith.
LADYSMITH, Dec. 7. The hottest
bombardment, of the siege took place
last Thursday. The Boers got a new big
gun in position on Lombard's kop, com
pletely commanding the town, and shell
ed onr camp that day and Tuesday,
planting shells with great accuracy in
the camp of the Gordon highlanders and
the Manchester regiment, where there
were many narrow escapes. The enemy
has resumed the bombardment, doing
some very effective shooting. Several of
onr guns have been shattered by the
Boer big gun.

QTJEENSTOWN, Cape . Colony, Dec.

In the country around Stormberg Junc
tion, to which General Gatacre will make
his next move. The telegraph lines have
been cut in various places, and commu
nication with Steynsburg, Dordrecht and
Maraisburg has been severed. It is be
lieved here that the Boers have occupied
Steynsburg. Firing has been heard in
the direction of Stormberg, probably be
tween General Gatacre's vanguard and
tbe Boer commando.

Oklahoma and Statehood.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Governor
Barnes of Oklahoma, in his annual re
port, estimates the present population- of
the territory at 375,000, fully 90 per cent
of whom are American bora. He says
that within the past year incoming set
tlers took up nearly 750,000 acres of gov
ernment land. The school population has
increased over 12 per cent. The territo
ry's real taxable valuation is placed at
$75,000,000. . The governor says that it
is best te wait for statehood a reasona
