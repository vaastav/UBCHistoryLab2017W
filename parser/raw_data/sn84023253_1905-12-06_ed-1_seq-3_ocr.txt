THE MESSAGE
president's Recommendations
to Congress
AS TO RAILROAD RATES
Favors Creation of Administra
tive Body to Handle tbe Mat
terDiscusses Trusts, Insur
ance, Revenue Revision, Army
and Navy, Panama Canal and
Many Other Subjects
President Roosevelt's annual mes
sage to congress opens with a plea for
the co-operation of all classes in con
tinuing the country's prosperity and in
correcting existing evils, for a "square
deal" for everybody, and first takes up
the question of corporations and rail
road rate legislation. The president
says:
I am in no sense hostile to corpora
tions. The corporation has come to
stay, just as the
trades union has
come to stay. Each
can do and has
done great good.
Each should be
favored so long as
It does good. But
each should be
sharply checked
where It acts
against law and
Justice. I believe that regulation and
supervision of great corporations, etc.,
can be obtained by the enactment of
law by the congress.
The Immediate and most pressing
need so far as legislation is concerned
Is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of the
government such supervision and regu
lation of the rates charged by the rail
roads of the country engaged In Inter
state traffic as shall summarily and ef
fectively prevent the Imposition of un
just or unreasonable rates. It must
Include putting a complete stop to re
bates in every shape and form.
In my judgment, the most Important
provision which such law should con
tain Is that conferring upon some com
petent administrative body the power
to decide upon the case being brought
before It, this decision to go into effect
within a reasonable time and to obtain
from thence onward, subject to review,
by the courts.
All private car lines, Industrial roads,
refrigerator charges and the like
should be expressly put under the su
pervision of the interstate commerce
commission or some similar body so
far as rates and agreements practical
ly affecting rates are concerned. A re
bate In icing charges or in mileage or in
a division of the rate for refrigerating
charges is just as pernicious as a re
bate in any other way.
There should be publicity of the ac
counts of common carriers. Only in
this way can violations or evasions of
the law be surely detected.
I hope that an employers' liability
law will be prepared and enacted as
speedily as possible.
The remedy Is to regulate the pro
cedure In issuing Injunctions in labor
disputes is by requiring the judge to
give due notice to the adverse parties
before granting the writ, the hearing
to be ex parte If the adverse party does
not appear at the time and place or
dered. What is due notice must depend
upon the facts of the case.
I recommend an Investigation by the
department of commerce and labor of
general labor conditions, especial at
tention to be paid to the conditions of
child labor and child labor legislation
In the several states.
The department of commerce and la
bor should also make a thorough Inves
tigation of the conditions of women in
Industry. Over 5,000,000 American wo
men are now engaged in gainful occu
pations, yet there is an almost complete
dearth of data upon which to base any
trustworthy conclusions as regards a
subject as important as It Is vast and
complicated. The introduction of wo
men In industry Is working change
and disturbance In the domestic and
social life of the nation. The decrease
In marriage, and especially In the birth
rate, has been coincident with It.
Recent events have emphasized the
Importance of an early and exhaustive
consideration of the Insurance question,
to see whether It is not possible to fur
nish better safeguards than the several
states have been able to furnish against
corruption of the flagrant kind which
has been exposed.
It Is Impossible to outline what shape
a readjustment of the revenues should
take, for it is as yet too early to say
whether there will be need for It. It
Should be considered whether It is not
desirable that the tariff laws should
provide for applying as against or In
favor of any other nation's maximum
and minimum tariff rates established
by the congress, so as to secure a cer
tain reciprocity of treatment between
other nations and ourselves.
I earnestly recommend to the con
gress the need of economy and, to this
end, of rigid scrutiny of appropriations.
Every consideration of prudence de
mands the addition of the element of
elasticity to our currency system. In
flation must be avoided, but some pro
vision should be made that will insure
a larger volume of money during the
fall and winter months than In the less
active seasons of the year, so that the
currency will contract against specula
tion and will expand for the needs of
legitimate business.
The president repeats bis recom
mendation In his last annual message
regarding federal elections.
This government will do everything
in its pow r to secure the success of
The Ilagus conference to the end that
substantial progress may be made In
the cause of international peace, justice
and good will.
We must as a nation make Jt evi
dent that we do not Intend to treat the
Monroe doctrine in any shape or way
as an excuse for aggrandizement on our
part at the expense of the republics to
the south. But we must make It evi
dent that we do not Intend to permit It
to be used by any nation on this conti
nent as a shield to protect it from the 1
.uuoc4uuui;es ui us own misueeus
against foreign nations.
Santo Domingo has now made an ap
peal to us, and not only every principle
of wisdom, but every generous Instinct
within us, bids us respond to the ap
peal. The conditions in Santo Do
mingo have for a number of years
grown from bad to worse until a year
ago all society was on the verge of dis
solution. Under the course taken by us
stability and order and all the benefits
of peace are at last coming to Santo
Domingo, danger of foreign interven
tion has been suspended, and there Is at
last a prospect that all creditors will
get justice, no more and no less.
I do not believe that any army In the
world has a better average of enlisted
man or a better type of junior officer,
but the army should be trained to act
effectively in a mass. Provision
should be made by sufficient appropria
tions for maneuvers of a practical
kind, for the promotion of exceptional
ly meritorious men over the heads of
their comrades and for the retirement
of all men who have reached a given
age without getting beyond a given
rank.
Our navy must, relatively to the na
ivles of other nations, always be of
greater size than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and It
has now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency. This standard must not
only be maintained, but increased.
In my last message I asked the at
tention of .the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, and I most ear
nestly request that you pay heed to the
report of the attorney general on this
subject.
To the 6pread of our trade In peace
and the defense of our flag In war a
great and prosperous merchant marine
is Indispensable. We should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
and in case of need to re-enforce our
battle line.
It Is a matter of unmixed satisfac
tion to call attention to the excellent
work of the pension bureau, for the vet
erans of the Civil war have a greater
claim upon us than any other class of
citizens. To them first of all among our
people honor is due.
We cannot have too much Immigra
tion of the right sort, and we should
have none whatever of the wrong sort.
The questions arising In connection
with Chinese immigration stand by
themselves. As a people we have talked
much of the open door In China, and we
expect and quite rightly intend to Insist
npon Justice being shown us by the
Chinese. But we cannot expect to re
ceive equity unless we do equity.
The civil service rule has been amend
ed by providing that where the inef
ficiency or Incapacity comes within the
personal knowledge of the head of a
department the removal may be made
without notice, the reasons therefor be
ing filed and made a record of the de
partment. Our copyright laws need revision.
The agricultural conditions of the Isl
ands enforce more strongly than ever
the argument In favor of reducing the
tariff on products of the Philippine Isl
ands entering the United States.
Immediate steps should be taken for
the fortification of DTawall. This is the
most important point in the Pacific to
fortify in order to conserve the Inter
ests of this country. It would be hard
to overstate the importance of this
need.
I earnestly advocate the adoption of
legislation which will explicitly confer
American citizenship on all citizens of
Porto Rico.
I earnestly ask that Alaska be given
nn elective delegate.
I recommend that Indian Territory
and Oklahoma be admitted as one state
and that New Mexico and Arizona be
admitted as one state.
Active work In canal construction,
mainly preparatory, has been In prog
ress for less than a year and a half.
During that period two points about
the canal have ceased to be open to
debate. First, the question of route;
second, the question of feasibility. The
point which remains unsettled Is wheth
er the canal shall be one of several
locks above sea level or at sea level
with a single tide lock. On this point
I hope to lay before the congress at an
early day. the findings of the advisory
board of American and European en
gineers. In addition to sanitating the Isthmus,
satisfactory quarters are being provid
ed for employes and an adequate sys
tem of supplying them with wholesome
food at reasonable prices has been
created. Hospitals have been estab
lished and equipped that are without su
periors of their kind anywhere. During
the past year a large portion of the
plant with which the work Is to be
done has been ordered.
What Is needed now and without de
lay Is an appropriation by the congress
to meet the current and accruing ex
penses of the commission. The first
appropriation of $10,000,000 out of the
$135,000,000 authorized by the Spooner
act was made three years ago. It Is
nearly exhausted. Unless the congress
shall appropriate before that time all
work must cease.
In conclusion the president recom
mends an Increase In the diplomatic
and consular service and more ade
quate compensation of Its members.

Among tbe many medicines upon the

Hvomei is tbe only method of treat
ment tbat sends by direct inhalation to
the most remote parts ol tbe air passages,
a balsamic air tbat destroys all catarrh
al germs in the breathing organs, enrich
es and purifies the blood with additional

Tbe complete outfit costs SI. 00 and
comprises an inhaler, a bottle of Hyomei
and a dropper. Tbe inhaler will last a
liletitne, and additional bottlesot Hyomei
can be obtained for 50 cents.
Breathe Hyomei for a few minutes four
times a day, and your catarrh will grow
better from tbe first day's use, and will

Sons of Veterans.
Division order No. 5, recently issued
from the headquarters of tbe Vermont
division of tbe Sons of Veterans, by J.
B. Ripley of Lyndonville, division com
mander, contains some interesting infor
mation. It refers to the new camp
organized here on September 29, giving
the officers elected. Division Treasurer,
Allan S. Holbrook has tendered bis
resignation, which has been accepted,
and G. F. Ferguson of Camp No. 75,
Lyndonville, has been appointed and
installed to fill out tbe unexpired term.
Reference is also made to the disbanding
ol Camp No. 7, ol Barre, and there is a
prospect tbat a new and live camp will
be organized there soon.
The commander in-chief reports lor tbe
quarter ending September 30 a net gain
in membership in this division of 56
members. This is the largest gain made
in any one quarter for several years.
ibe annual inspection ol tbe camps in
this division is now going on and it is
hoped ihat tbe assistant inspectors will
complete tbeir work before tbe 15th ot
December.
Tbe annual elections are near at band,
and it is hoped that only the best mem
bers ol the camp will be elected to any
office. Tbe officers should be not only
brothers that are interested workers lor
the best interest of our beloved order,
but they should be men of some business
ability, as much depends on tbem tor
prompt and correct reports once a
quarter to the division headquarters.
Such men will save lots of vexation and
annoyance at division headquarters to
return many reports for correction, and
this causes delay.

A man's mark is his honor. It stands for him and he stands for it.
It's the old Saxon way of signifying good intentions.
The right to be protected in tbe exclusive use of a trade mark has
been long recognized by the common law and enforced by the
chancery courts of England and this country.
The Government puts its mark on a bond to give it value.
The NATIONAL BISCUIT COM PAW puts its trade mark in red and
white on each end of a package of biscuit, crackers or wafers to
distinguish these products and to guarantee, the quality, and it do4t.
To more clearly comprehend the real value of this trade mark, try
