in the worst form, my limbs swelled from
the ankles up. I bloated until 1 was unable
to button my clothing; had sharp pains
about the heart, smothering spells and
shortness of breath. For three months I
was unable to He down, and all the sleep J.
got was in an arm chair. I was treated by
the best doctors but gradually grew worse.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 1898.
At the opening of congress Monday
all the Wisconsin members were in
their seats except Representative
Babcock, who is in the state fixing
up his fences for tbe senatorship.
The Milwaukee wheat market yes
terday was weak, and closed at 66%c
for No. 1 and for No. 2 North
ern, Flour was unchanged. Barley
closed at 4.9}4c, rye at 53c, corn at
32%c, and oats at 58%c. Hogs were
weak, ranging at $3.30@53.45 'for
packing grades.
The president’s message, delivered
to congress Monday, is generally con
sidered a most valuable historical
document. It gives a complete re
sume of the late war and deals ably
with other public questions. How
ever, some expected suggestions as to
the expansion matters were left un
said.
We are forced to the conclusion
that The Waukesha Freeman has no
'‘sporting” editor. Andy O’Dea has
gone to Harvard not as a student,
but as an ‘‘instructor.” He will
teach the boys how to row, and what
ever his intellectual attainments may
be, they have nothing to do with Lis
professional oarsmanship.
Some of the railwaj 7 companies
have signified their intention of dis
tributing annual passes to Wiscon
sin legislators the same as heretofore.
If the lawmakers have the slightest
regard for the platform pledges of
their parties they will return tbe
passes to thecorapanies at once. No
honest man could do otherwise.
C. W. Fraser, of Waukesha, is a
candidate for chief clerk of the assem
bly. He appears to haveetrongsup
port throughout thestate and is high
ly spoken of by those who know him.
It is said he is thoroughly competent,
tor the place. Perhaps it might be well
to pass the plums around this win
ter, instead of electing the same old
crowd to the legislative positions.
Congressman Sauerhering has ex
pressed the intention of having the
Dodge county pension board reorgan
ized this winter. He says thepresent
board is not doing justice to the old
soldiers, not a single applicant hav
ing thus far been able to secure the
board’s endorsement. He further
claims that there is but one member
who rightly considers the matter of a
soldier’s disabilities. He wants a
board that will do justice to those who
deserve pensions.
Pains in the chest when a person has
a cold indicates a tendency toward pneu
monia. A piece of flannel dampened
with Chamberlain’s Pain Balm and
bound ©n to the chest over the seat of
pain will promptly relieve the pain and
prevent the threatened attack of pneu
monia. This same treatment will cure a
lame back in a few hours. Sold by C.

flow Much Scofield Ran Behiud His
Ticket.
Where an election is not close little
interest is taken in official returns;
but this year, owing to the fight made
on the head of the Republican ticket,
the official returns have been anxious
ly looked for to settle the question
as to how much Governor Scofield
ran behind the other candidates on
his ticket. The official count has
been completed and the fact is as
certained.
Governor Scofield’s total vote was
173,137 and that of the Democratic
candidate for governor, Judge
Sawyer, 135,335 —leaving Scofield’s
plurality 37,802.
The total voce for the other candi
dates on the Republican ticket was
as follows:
Jesse Stone, lieutenant-governor,
180,043.
W. H. Froelich, secretary of state,
180,438.
J. O. Davidson, state treasurer,
180,792.
E. R. Hicks, attorney general,
180,073.
L. D. Harvey, state superintend
ent, 180,339.
G. L. Rice, railroad commissioner*
180,106.
Emil Giljohan, insurance commis
sioner, 180,019.
Thus it will be seen that Governor
Scofield’s vote fell behind that of the
candidate for lieutenant-governor,
6,906.
Governor Scofield’s vote fell behind
the average vote cast for the state
officers, excluding that cast for gover
nor, 7,121.
Governor Scofie d’s vote fell behind
the average vote for state officers, in
cluding the vote cast for governor,
6,231.
A reference to the complete returns
shows that about one-third of the
cut on the head of the Republican
ticket came from Dane county and
Milwaukee county.
Washington Letter.
I From our Regular Correspondent.!
Washington, December 2, 1898.
President McKinley is confident that
the senate will promptly ratify the
treaty of peace with Spain. The
treaty will he sent to the senate at
the earliest possible moment, but
there are formalities that may delay
its being sent until after the Christ
mas recess. As three of the Ameri
can peace commissioners are mem
bers of the senate committee on
foreign relations, it is expected that
the treaty will be quickly reported to
the senate from that committee, with
the recommendation that it he rati
fied. The treaty does not involve
the question of a form ofgovernment
for the Philippines, nor does it bind
this government to keeping them per
manently, therefore Senator Lodge
was correct when he said: “Under
the terms of the agreement those op
posing the ratification of the treaty
must take the uncomfortable posi
tion of opposing a treaty of peace
on the ground that the United State*
is getting too much from Spain.”
President McKinley has been assured
by a number of senators that they
will vote for the ratification of the
tiear.y, although they are not pre
pared to commit themselves in favor
of permanently retaining the Philip
pines. That is a question there is
plenty of time to consider; upon
which the president has not yet com
mitted himself, and about which
much more will he known after we
have run the islands under a military
government for a time.
If congress acts as promptly as it
is expected to do on the bill provid
ing tor an increase of the regular
army to 100,000 men, it is not likely
that any of the volunteers will be sent
to Cuba. Nearly every senator and
representative who has come to
Washington has called at the war
department to request that some
regiment of volunteers be mustered
out because the men while willing to
fight are not willing to remain in the
army to perform garrison duty.
The president is anxious to meet the
wishes of the men, but it cannot be
fully done until congress provides
for the increase in the regular army.
Already orders have been issued to
send about 6,000 regulars to Manila,
in order that some cf the volunteers
may be brought home.
Representative DanforL of Ohio,
is one of the millions who oelieve in
our ability* to meet eyery responsi
bility which confronts us, whether it
be assumed from choice or from a
sense of duty and humanity. He
said on the subject: “That the Ameri
can people are competent to own
and manage the territory wrested
from Spain is in the nature of a self
evident proposition. Mr. Carnegie is
making more fuss by the expression
of his fears as to our competency
than anybody else, and I suspect
that if Mr. Carnegie’s doubt were
analyzed it would be found that his
anti-expansion views grow out of his
dislike to seeing England, Germany,
France, et al, admitted to equal
trade privileges with the United
States in the Philippines. If he
could get a shade of advantage for
the sale of his steel products over
these, I think, he would be as good
an imperialist as any.”
This week President and Mrs. Mc-
Kinley were presented by J. D. Robin
son, secretary of the Libby Glass com
pany, of Toledo,|Ohio,with the largest
cut glass punch bowl ever made. Mr.
Robinson is a Democrat, but a
strong admirer of President McKin
ley’s policy, and his personal friend.
The punch bowl is cut to represent
the stars and stripes, and on the
sides are six shields, each with
thirteen stars to represent the origi
nal states of the union. Scattered
around the bowl are forty-five large
stars to represent the states now in
the union. The president has several
reasons for appreciating this splendid
cift, not the least of which is that it
is American-made and a constant re
minder that the establishment of
the industry of cutting glass in the
United States which opponents of
the Republican party once declared
to be an impossibility, and which
now rivals both iti extent and work
manship that produced by any
country on earth, was the direct re
sult of Republican efforts.
One of the first results of American
possession of the Philippines will be
the squelching of Aguinaldo and his
pinchback government and the dis
bandment of his army. Officials do
not anticipate that any trouble will
follow when Aguinaldo is ordered to
disarm his followers and to tell them
to resume their ordinary occupation,
but if there is any trouble it will be
short and decisive, as there are
enough American troops now at
Manila to make short work of whip
ping Aguinaldo’s forces into obedi
ence, should it become necessary.
Waterworks at the Asylum.
At the session of the county board
last week the sum of SI,BOO was appro
priated for the purpose of erecting
waterworks at the county insane asy
lum and poor house. The trustees
had secured an estimate of the stand
pipe system. It was believed by many
that the pneumatic system would be
preferable, and therefore Mr. White,
the inventor of the system, was asked
to come to Jefferson and submit a prop
osition. This he did, proposing to
erect a complete plant for the county,
using separate boiler, furnish the en
gine, together with the pumps, hose,
in fact, everything necessary, for the
reasonable sura of SI,BOO. A special
committee of the board was appointed
to act in conjunction with the trustees,
consisting of Messrs. Whittet, Curtis
and McGolrick. The committee and
trustees were agreed that the White
system was what they desired, be
lieving it better than the stand-pipe
system. When the question came up
before the meeting of the board, Mr.
White repeated his proposition, and
the matter, as it now stands, is in the
hands of the special committee and the
trustees. They will meet in this city
December 8 to decide the matter.—

“ Mrs. Sanders had

W. A. Sanders, Esq., of Hern, Mason County,

iffy there is no time to

from a “slight cold”
to bronchitis ; from bronchitis to pneu

weakened lungs, and from that to dread
consumption itself.
The time to cure consumption is before it
gets a start. Take Dr. Pierce’s Golden
Medical Discovery on the first appearance
of cough or cold, and you will never have a
hemorrhage or a tubercle. The“ Discovery”
is the greatest health builder in the world.
It first straightens out all digestive disor
ders, and aids the body in ridding itself of
poisonous effete matter. It tones up the
stomach, invigorates the liver and in con
nection with Dr. Pierce’s Pellets keeps the
bowels open and regular. Don’t let un
scrupulous medicine dealer foist some
substitute when you want Dr. Pierce’s
medicines. Assert your rights—get what
you ask for, and be well.
