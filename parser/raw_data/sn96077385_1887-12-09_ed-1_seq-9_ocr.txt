1 THE ANNUAL MESSAGE.
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S COMMUNI
CATION SENT TO CONGRESS.
Washington Citt, Deo. 7. President Cleve
land Rent Lis annual message to congress Tues
day. It treats solely of the treasury surplus and
tariff question, and Is as follows :
To the Congress or the United States :
You are confronted at the threshbold of your
legislative duties with a condition of the na
tional flnonoes which Imperatively demands
immediate and careful consideration. The
amount of money annually received through the
operation of present laws, from the industries
and necessities of the people, largely exceeds
the sum necessary to meet the expenses of the
government. When we consider that the theory
of our institutions guarantees to every citizen
the full endowmeut of the fruits of bis industry
aud enterprises with only such deduction as
may be bis share toward the careful aud eco
nomical maintenance of the government whioh
protects bim. it is plain that the exaction of
more than this is indefensible and a culpable
betrayal of fairness and justice. This wrong in
flicted upon those who bear the burden of na
tional taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a
brood of evil consequences. The' publio treas
ury, which should only exist as a conduit con
voying the people's tribute to its legitimate ob
jects of expenditures, becomes a hoarding place
lor money needlessly withdrawn from trade and
the people's use, thus crippling our national en
orgies, usurping our country's development, pre
venting investment in productive enterprises,
threatening financial disturbance, and inviting
schemes ol publio plunder.
This condition of our treasury is not altogether
new ; and it has more than once of late been sub
mitted to the people's representatives in the con
Kress who alone can apply a romedy. And yet
the situation still continues, with aggravated in
cidents, more than ever presaging financial con
vulsions and wide-spread disaster. It will not
do to netdect this situation because its dangers
are not now palpably imminent and apparent.
They exist none the less certainly and the unfor
seen and unexpected occasion may come wheu
suddenly they will be precipitated upon us.
On the SUth day of June, 1833, the excess of
revenue over publio expenditure after complying
with the annual requirement of the sinking-fund
act, was 17,8.i9.73d.84 ; during the year ended
.tune HO, 188J, mch excess amounted to 49,40r,
M3.'20 ; and during the year ended June 80, 1N87.
it reached the sum of $53,007,8itf.54. The annual
contributions to the sinking-fund during the
three years above specified, amounting in the
aggregate to 13H,(i58,320.U4, and deduoting from
f be surplus as stated, were made by calling in for
that purpose outstanding 3 per cent, bonds
f the government. During the six mouths prior
to June 30, 1887, the surplus revenue had grown
so large by repeated accumulations, and it was
reared the withdrawal of this great sum of money
needed by the peoplo, would so affect the busi
ness of the country that the sum of
79.8f4,100 of such surplus was applied to the
payment of the principal and interest of the
:t per cent, bonds still outstanding, and whioh
were then payable at the option of the govern
ment. The precarious condition of financial af
fairs among the people still needed relief. Imme
diately after the 30th day of June, 1887, tho re
mainder of the 3 per cent, bonds thus outstand
ing amounting, with principal and interest, to
the sum of (18,877,500, wero called iu and ap
plied to the sinking fund contribution for the
current fiscal year. Notwithstanding these oper
ations of the treasury department representa
tions of distress in business circles not only con
tinued but increased, and absolute peril seemed
at hand. In these circumstances the contribu
tion to the sinking fund for the current fiscal
year was at once eomploted by the expenditure
of 27,ri84,283.C5 in the purchase of government
bonds not yet due bearing 4!a per cent interost,
the premium paid thereon avoraging about 21
per cent, for the former and 8 per cent, for the
latter. In addition to this the interest accruing
during the current year upon the outstanding
bonded Indebtedness of the government was to
Home extent anticipated and banks selected as
depositories of publio money wero permitted to
eoniewhat increase their dejwslts.
While the expedients thus employed, to re
loase to the people the money lying iu the treas
ury, served to avert immediate danger, our sur
plus revenues have continued to accumulate, the
excess for the presont year amounting on the lftt
day of December to $55,28,871.19,and estimated to
reach the sum of $113,000,000 on tho 30tb of June
next, at which date it is expected that this sum,
added to prior accumulations, will swell the sur
plus In the treasury to 140,1.00.000.
There seems to be no assnrauce that with such
a withdrawal from use of the people's circulat
ing medium our business community may not in
the near luture be subjected to the samo distress
whioh was quite lately produced from the same
causes And while the functions of ournatloual
treasury should ho few and simple, and while
the bent condition would be reached, I believo by
its entire disconnection with the private business
interests, vet when, by a perversion of its pur
poses, it idiy uoias money uselessly suostraotea
from the channels of trade, there seems to be rea
sons for theclaims that legitimate means should
be devised by the government to rostore iu au
mergenoy, without waste or extravagance, such
money to its place among tho people.
If suoh an emergency arises there now exists
no clear and undoubted executive ixwer of re
lief. Heretofore the redemption of the 3 per
cents only, which were payable at the option of
the government, has afforded a means for the
disbursement of the excess of our revenues ; but
these bonds have all been retired, and there are
no bonds outstanding, the payment of whioh we
have the right to insist upon. The contribution
to the sinking fund, which furnishes the occa
sion for expenditures in the purchase of bonds,
has been already made for the current year, so
there is no outlet in that direction.
In the present state of legislatlou the only
pretense of any existing executive power to re
store, at this time, any part of our surplus reve
nues to the people by its expenditure, consists
in the supposition that the secretary of the
treasury may enter the market end purchase the
bonds of the government not yet due, at a rato
of premium to be agreed upon.
The only provision of law from which such a
power could be derived Is found in an ap
propriation bill passed a number of years ago,
and it is subject to the supposition that it was
intended as temporary and limited in its ap
plication instead of conferring a continuing dis
cretion and authority. No condition ought to
exist which would justify the grant of power to
a single ductal upon bis judgment of its neces
sity, to withhold from or release to business of
the people in an unusual manner money held In
the treasury, and thus affect, at his will, the
financial slcuation of the country; and if ilis
deemed wise to lodge in the secretary of the
treasury the authority In the present juncture to
purchase bonds, it should bo plainly vested, and
provided as far as possible, with such checks
and limitations as will define bis official right
and discretion, and at the same time relieve bim
from undue responsibility.
In considering the question of purchasing
bonds as a means of restoring to circulation the
surplus money accumulating in the treasury, it
should be borne in mind that premiums must
of course be paid upon such purchase : that there
may be a large part of these bonds held as In
vestments which can not be purchased at any
price and that combinations among holders who
are willing to sell, may unreasonably enhance
the cost of such bonds to the government
It has been suggested that the present bonded
debt might be refunded at a less rate of interest
and the difference between the old and new se
curities raid in cash, thus finding use for the
surplus In the treasury. The success of this
plan, it is apparent, must be founded upon the
volition of the holders of the present bonds: and
it is not entirely certain that the inducement
which must be offered them would reduee the
nrlnoinal of the debt bv actual cavmeat Instead
of extending it. The proposition to deposit the
money held by the overnmont in banks
throusbout the country, for use bv the people.
(s, it seems to me. an exceedingly objectionable
prineiple as reaching too close a relationship be
tween the operations of the government to the
business of the country, and the extensive com
mingling ofthoir money, thus fostering an un
natural reliance In prlvato business upon publio
funds. If this scheme shorn Id be adopted it
abould be done as a temporary expedient to meet
aa urgent ujttlty. legislative and executive
effort should generally be In trie opposite direc
tion and should have a tendency to divorce, aa
much and as fast as can be done the treasury
department from prlvato enterprises. Of coure
It is not expected that unnecessary and extrara
cant o Derations will be made for the purpose of
avoiding the accumulation of an exoes s of revenue.
Such expenditure, besides tne demoralization or,
all just conceptions of publio duty whioh it en
tails, emulates a reckless improvidence not in
the leaxt consistent with the mission of our poo
pie or the high beneficent purposes of our gov
ernment. I have deemed it my duty thus to bring tq the
knowledge of my countrymen as well as to the
attention of their representatives to the respon
sibility of legislative relief, the gravity of our
financial situation. The failure of the cocpresn
heretofore to provide against the danger which
it was quite evident the vory nature of the dif
ficulty must necessary produce, caused a condi
tion of financial distross aud apprehension luo
their last adjournment which taxed to the ut
most all tho authority and expedients wltlilu ex
ecutive control ; and these appoar now to ho ex
hausted. If disaster results from the continued
inaction of congress the responsibility must rest
where it belongs.
The situation thus far is fraught with danger
which should be fully realized, aud though it
presents features of wrong to the peoplo as well
as to the country, it is but a result growing out
of a perfectly palpable and apparont oause con
stantly reproducing the same alarming circum
stances a congested national treasury and a de
pleted monetary condition in the business of the
country. It need hardly bo stated that while the
iresent situation demands a remedy we can only
e saved from a predicament iu the future by
the removal of the cause.
Our scheme of taxation by means of whioh thu
needless surplus is taken from the peoplo and
put into the ptibllo treasury, consists of a tariff
or duty levied upon importations from abroad
and Internal revenue taxes levied uion tho con
sumption of tobacco and spirituous and malt
lixuors. It must be considered that none of these
taxes relating to things subjected to internal rov
enue taxation are. strictly speaking, necessary,
and it appears to bo no just cauBe of 'complaint
of the consumers of tho articles, and there seems
to be nothing so well able to bear the burden
without hardship to any portion of the people.
But our present tariff laws, the various, in
equitable und illegal source of unnecessary tax
ation, ought to be at once revised and iimcnded.
Tbesolaws.as their primary and plain effoct,raise
tho price to consumers of all articles Imported
and subject to duty.by preclselyjthe sum paid for
such duties. Thus the amount of the duty meas
ures the tax paid by thoso who purchase for uso
these imported artiolos. Many of these things,
however, are raised or manufactured iu our own
country, and the duties now le led upon foreign
goods and products are called protection to these
home manufactures, because they render it pos
sible for tbone of our people who are manufact
urers to mtko thtfce taxed articles and sell them
for a price equal to that demanded for the im
ported goods taat have paid customs duty. Eo it
happens Hat wLile i-iiupmtieJy a
few use the imported article,
millions of our people, who never ue aud never
saw any of the foreign products, purchase and
use things of the same kiud made in this coun
try, and pay tbt relore nearly or quite tho same
enhanced price wbicn the duty adds to the im
ported articles. Those who buy imports pay
the duty charged thereon into the publio treas
ury, but the great majority of our citizens who
buy domestic articles of the Hame class pay a
sum at least approximately equal to its duty to
the home manufacturers. This reference to tho
operation of our tariff laws is not made byway
of instruction, but in order that we may be con
stantly reminded of the manner iu which they
inipobe a burden upon those who ooueume do
mestic productH as well as those who consume
Imported articles, aud thus cieato a tax upon all
our people.
It is not proposed to entirely relieve the coun
try of this taxatiou. It must bo extensively con
tinued as the source of the government's income ;
and in a readjustment of our tariff the interests
of American labor engaged iu manufacture
uhoul'l le corelully considered, as woll as thu
preservation of our manufacturers. It may bo
called protection, or by nny other name, but re
lief from the hardship and dangers of our pres
ent tariff laws, sbou.d be devisod with especial
precaution SRalust imperiling the existence of
uur manufacturing interests. Hut this existence
should not mean a conditiou which, without ro
gard t the publio welfare or a national exigency,
must always insure the realization of immeufle
profits instead of moderately profitable returns.
As the volume end diversity of our national ac
tivities increase, new reoruits are added to those
who desire a continuation of the advantages
which they conceive the present cystem of
tariff taxation directly affords them, So stub
bornly have all efforts to reform the present con
ditiou been resisted bv thoso of our fellow-citi-sens
thus engaged, that tbey cnii hardly com
plain of the suspicion, entertained to a certain
extent, that there exists an organized combina
tion all along- the line to maintain their advan
tage. We are in the midst of centennial celebrations,
and with becoming pride we rejoice in American
skill and ingenuity, in American energy and en
terprise, and in tho wonderful natural advan
tages and resources developed by a oentury's
national growth. Yet when an attempt is made
to justify a schomo which permits a tax to bo
laid upon every consumer in the land for the ben
enrttofour manufacturers quite beyond a rea
sonable demand for governmental regard, it suits
the purposes of the manufacturers end infant
industries still needing the highest and greatest
ttegreo of favor and care that can do wrung rrom
federal legislation. It is also said that the in
crease in the prico of domestlo manufactures
resulting from the present tariff is necessary in or
der that higher wagoa may be paid than for what
Is called pauper labor in Europe. In all, we ac
knowledge the force of an argument which in
volves the welfare and liberal compensation of
our laboring peoplo. Our labor is honorable iu
the eyes of every American citizen, and lies at
the foundation of Our development ; it is entitled
without Affectation or hypocrisy to the utmost
regard. The standard of our laborer's life should
not be marred by that of another country less
favored, and they are entitled to their full shove
of our advantages.
By tho Inst census It is made to appear that of
the 17,.'tW,0Q0 of our population engaged in all
kinds of industries 7,G70,4'.i3 are employed in agri
culture, 4,74,2mh in professional and persoual
services (2,4:t,878 of whom aro domestic servants
and laborers), while l,81t,25tt aro imployed in
trade and transportation, and 3,837,11'J aro
classed as employed at manufacturing and min
ing. For prweeut purposes, however, the latter
number shouldbe considerably reduced. Without
attempting to enumerate all, it will bo conceded
that there should be deducted from those which
it includes 73,)4:i carpenters and joiners, 285,170
milliners, drens makers and seanistresses,172.120
blacksmiths, 131,70(1 tailors and tailoresses, 107,
000 inasoii, 7ci.21l butchers, 41,300 bakers, 22.182
plasterers and 4 sol manufacturing agricultural
implements. Icaviug2,623,069 persons employed iu
manufacturing industries as are claimod to bo
benefitted in a high tariff.
To these the appeal is made to savo their em
ployment und maintain their wages by resisting
a chango There should be no disposition to an
swer such suggestions by the allegations Jthat
they are in a minority among those who
labor, aud therefore should forego an advantage
in the Interest of low prices for the majority.
Their compensation, as it may be affected by
the operations of tariff laws, should at all times,
be scrupulously kept in view ; and yet with '
slight rt flections tbty will not overlook the fact
that thev aro cousvjneM with the rest ; that
tbey too have their own want and those of their
families to supply from their earnings, and that
the prices of the uocossurtes of life as well as the
amount of those wants will regulate the mesBiire
of their welfare and comfort. But tho reduction
of taxation demandod el otild be to measured as
not to necessitate or justify eitUr the loss of
employment by the workingman nor the lessen
ing of bis wages; and tho profits still remaining
to the manufacturer after t necessary readjust
ment should furnish no excuse for tne sacrifice
of the interests of his employers in titht r their
opportunity to work or the diminution ot their
compensation. Nor can the worker in manu
factures understand that while a high tariff is
claimed to be necessary to allow payment of re
munerative wages, it pertainly results in a very
large increase iu the rioe of nearly all sorts of
manufactures, which, in almost tountless.forms,
he needs for the use of hlmse'f awl his family.
He receivea at the 0bk vt his employer bis
wages, and perhaps before he react s Ids home
.s obliged in a purchase for bin family use of an
article which embraces his own labor to return
In the payment of the Increasing price which
the tariff permits, the hard-earned compensation
of many days of toll.
The farmer and the agriculturist who manu
factures nothing, but who pay the lncieawed
price which the tariff irrposes upon every ojtri
cultural implement, upon all be wears, and upon
all he usos and owns, except the increase of his
flocks and herd and such things as his hus
bandry produces from the soil, is invited to aid
In maintaining the present situation ; mind, be Is
told that a high duty on Imported wool is neces
sary for the benefit of those who have sheep to
shear, in order that the price of their wool may
be increased. They, of courso are not reminded
that the farmer who has no sheep is by this
scheme obliged, iu his purchases of clothing and
woolen goods, to pay a tribute to his fellow
f srmer as well aa to the manufacturer and mer
chant ; nor is any mention mado of the fact that
the sheep owners themselves and their house
holds, must wear clothing and uso other articles
manufactured from the wool tbey sell at tariff
prices, and thus as consumers, must return their
share of this increased price to the tradesman. I
think it may fairly assumed that a Inrge pro
portion of the sheep owned by the farmers
throughout the country are found In small flocks
numbering f:oiu twenty-five to fifty.
The dnty on this grade of Im
ported wool w hich these sheep yield Is 10 oenta
on each pound If of the value of 30 ceuts or less,
and 12 cents if of the value of more than P.O cents.
If tho liberal estimate of six pounds be allowed
for each fleece, the duty thereon woul.i be 00 or
72 cents, and this may be, taken as the utmost en
hancement of Ha price to the farmer by reason
of this duty. Eighteen dollar! would thus repre
sent the increased price of the wool from twenty-
five sheep and oo mat rrom tne wool or nny
aneep; ana at present values ims naoiaon would,
amount to about ooe-thitd of its ptfo. If upon
its sale the farmer receives this or h less tariff
profit, the wool leaves his bauds charged with,
precisely mat sum. wmcn m au u oiia iiks win
adhere to i until itrescbeo the eoimuuier.
When manufactured Into cloth aire! oilier odt
and material for use, its cost is no' onl v iaorased
tot he extent ot the farmers' tariff proi hut .
further sum has been added for the leu rit of th
manufacturer under the operation of o. uer tannT
laws.
In the meantime tho day arrives v hen the
farmer finds it necessary to purchase woolen
?oods and material to clothe himseit an I family
or the winter. When be faoes the tnde-maa
for that purpose, he discovers that he u obliged
not only to return in the way ot Increased prices,
his tariff profit on tho wool he sold, a-nl wulch
then perhaps lies before bim In uinuufnctured
form, but that he must add a considerate sum
thereto t meet a further increase in oast caused
by a tariff duty on the manufacture. Thus iu
the end, he is aroused to the fact that he has
paid up on a moderate purchase, as a result of
the tariff scheme, which, when he sold his wool
seemed so profitable, au increase In price more
than sufficient to sweep away all the tariff profit
he reoeived upon tho wool he produced and
sold.
When the number of farmers engaced In wool
raising is compared with all the farmers in the
country, and the small proportion they bear to
our population is considered ; when it is made
apparent that, in the case of a large part of those
who own sheep, tho benefit of the present tariff
on wool is illusory ; and, above all, when it must
be conceded that the increase of the cost of liv
ing caused by such tariff, becomes a burden upon
those with moderate means, and the poor, the
employed and the unemployed, the siok and
well, and the youug and old, and that it consti
tutes a tax which, with relentless grasp, Is fast
ened upon the clothing of every man, women,
and child in the land, reasons are suggested why
the removal or reduction of this duty should bo
included in a revision of our tariff laws.
In speaking of the increased cost to the con
sumer ot our home manufactures, resulting from
a duty laid upon imported articles ot the same
description, the fact is not overlooked that com
petition among our domestio producers some
times has the effect of keeping the prioe of their
Products bslow the highest limit allowed by suoh
uty. Hut It is notorious that this competition
is too often strangled by combinations quite pre
valent at this time, and frequently called trusts,
which have for their object the regulation of the
supply and price of commodities made and sold
by mejsibers of the combination. The people
can hardly hope for any consideration in the
operation cf these selfish schemers. If, how
ever, in the absence of such combination, a
healthy an free competition reduces the prioe
of any particular dutiable article of home pro
duction, below the limit which it inhht otherwise
reach under our tariff laws, and if, with suoh re
duced prico, its manufacture coutlnues to thrive,
it is entirely evident that one thing has been
discovered which should be carefully scrutinised
in an effort to reduce taxation. The necessity of
combiuation to maintain the price of any com
modityl o the tariff point furnishes proof that
some one is willing to accept lower prices for
such commodity, and that suoh prices are re
munerative; aud later prices produced by com
petition prove the same thing. Thus where
either of these conditions exist, a case woujd
seem to be presented for an easy reduction 01
taxation.
The considerations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended only to en
force an earnest recommendation that the sur
plus revenues ot tbegoverument be prevented by
the reduction of our customs duties, and, at the
same time, to emphasise a suggestion that In ac
complishing this purpose, we may discharge a
double duty to our people by granting to them a
measure of relief from tariff taxation In quarters
where it is most needed and from sources where
it can be most fairly and justly accorded. Nor
con the presentation made of snch consideration
be, with anv degree ot fairness, regarded as evi
dence of unfriendliness toward our manufactur
ing Interests, or of any lock ot appreciation of
their value and importance. These interests
constitute a leading and most substantial ele
ment ot our national greatness and furnish the
proud proof of our country's progress. Dut it In
the emergency that presses upon us our manu
facturers are asked to surrender something for
tho publio good and to aveit disaster, their patri
otism, as well as a grateful recognition of ad
vantages already afforded, should lead them to
willing co-operation. No demand Is made that
they shall forego all the benefits of governmental
regard; but they cannot fall to be admon
ished of tbelrduty, as well as their enlightened
self-interest and safety, when they are reminded
of the fact that financial panio and collapse, to
which the present condition tends, afford no
greater shelter or protection to our manufactures
than to our other import aut enterprises. Oppor
tunity for safe, careful and deliberate reforui Is
pow offered; and pone of us should ba unmind
ful of a time when au abusad and irriated people,
heedless of those who have resisted timely ana
reasonable relief, may insist upon a radical and
sweeping rectification of their wrongs,
The ditlloulty attending a wise and fair revis
vlson of our tariff laws is not under-estimated.
It will require on the part of congress great labor
and care and especially a broad and national
content pin tion of the subject, and a patriotic dis
regard of such local aud selfish claims as are un
reasonable and reckless ot the welfare of the en
tiro country.
Under our presont laws more than 4,000 articles
are subject to duty. Many ot these do not in any
way compete with our own manufactures, and
many are hardly worth attention as subjects of
revenue. A com- idcrable reduction can be made
in the aggregate by adding them to the free list
The taxation of luxurios present no features of
hardship : but the necessaries of life used 'and
consumed by all The peoples the duupou which
adds to the cost of living in every uome, should
be groatly chespened. The radical reduction of
the duties imposed upon raw material used in
manufactures, or its free importation, is, of
course, an important faotor in any effort to re
duce the price of these neoesssries ; it would not
only relieve them from the increased cost caused
by tho tariff on such material, but the manufact
ured product being thus cheapened that part of
the tariff now laid upon such product, as a com
pensation to our manufacturers for tho present
price of raw material, could be accordingly mod
ified. Such reduction, or free importation, would
serve besides to largely reduce the
revenuo. It Is not apparent how
such a change can have any injurious
effect upon our manufacturers. On tho contrary,
it would appear to give them a better chance In
foreign markets with the manufacturers of other
countries who cheapen their wares by free ma
terial. Thus our peoplo might have
the opportunity of oxteudlng their sales
beyond the limits of homo consump
tion, saving them from the depression,
interruption in business and loss caused by a
glutted domestio market, and affording their em
ployes more certain and steady labor, with IU re
sulting quiet and oontentment
The question thus Imperatively presented for
solution should be approached In a spirit higher
than partisanship, and considered in the light of
that regard for patriotic duty which should
characterize the action of thoso Intrusted with
the weal of a confiding people. But the obliga
tion to declared party policy and principle is not
wanting to urge prompt and effective action.
Both of the great political parties now repre
sented in the government, have, by repeated
and authoritative declarations, condemned the
condition of our laws whioh permit tho collec
tion from the people .f unnecessary revenue,
and have, in the most solemn manner, promised
lis correction ; end neither as citisens ot parti
Sana are our countrymen In a mood to Comoro
the deliberate violation ot these pledges,
Our progress toward a wise conclusion will not
be Improved by dwelling upon the theories of
protection aud free trade, This savors too muoh
ot bandying epithets. It is a condition whioh
confronts us not a theory. Belief from this
condition may involve a slight reduction of the
advantages which we award our home produc
tions, but the entire withdrawal of suoh advan
tages should not be contemplated. Tho question
of free trade is absolutely irrelevant ana the per
sistent claims mado in certain quarters, that all
pffort to relievo the peoplo from unjust and un
necessary taxation are schemes of so-called free
traders, is mischievous and far removed from
any consideration (or the publio good. The
simple and plain duty whioh we pwe the peoplo
is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses
of an economical oparatlon of the government,
and to restore to the business of tho country the
money which we hold In tho treasury through
tho perversion of governmental powers. These
things can aud should be done wit- safety to all
our industries, without danger to tho opportun
ity for remunerative labor which our working-
men need, and with benefit to them and all our
people, by cheapening tneir means or subsis
tence and increasing the measure of their com
forts.
The constitution provides that tho president
"shall, from time to time, give to the congress
information of the state of the Union." It has
been the custom of the executive, la compliance
with this provision, to annually exhibit to the
congress, at tho opening of Its session, tho gen
eral oondition of tho country, and to detail, with
some particularity, tho operations of the differ
ent executive departments. It would be espe
cially agreeable to follow this eonrseat the pres
ent time, and to call attention to the valuable
accomplishments of these departments during
the last fitcal year, but I am so much Impressed
with tho paramount importanoe of tho subject
to which this communication has thus far been
devoted, that I shall forego tho addition of any
other topio and only urge upon your immediate
consideration the "state ot tho Union" as shown
in the present eondltion of our treasury and our
general fiscal situation, upon which every ele
ment of our safety and prosperity depends.
Tho reports of tho beads of deportments, which
will be submitted, oontaia toll and oipllolt
information touching the transactions ot
ui Duamess intrusted to tnem and sucn recom
mendations relating to legislation In tho publio
Interest as they deem adviseablo. I ask for these
reports and recommendations tho deliberate ex
amination and action ol tho legislative branch ot
um government.
There aro other subjects not embraced in tho
departmental reports demanding legislative con

SHOWING UP A FRAUD.
Grain Swindlers In Mlsaonrl Ban t Kanti
Many Farmers Victimised.
St. Loots, Ma, Deo. .The Southwestern
Grain and Seed company, doing business tor tho
past two years at Springfield. Mo., Is accused ot
obtaining money under false pretonses, and la
being prosecuted under the act. It is charged
with tho famous Bohemian oats swindle, that
was so successfully practiced In Ohio two years
ago. Tho swindle consists in selling ten bushels
ot oats at $15 per bushel to a well
known farmer, taking bis note payable
at tho time of tho harvest ot his first crop, and
making a contract with him to buy all tho oats
ha raises at f 10 a bushel. The first year his
contract is carried out faithfully, and tho honest
farmer Is mado tho tool and his neighbors are
lod to the slaughter. They buy the oats under
similar contracts, giving their notes, which aro
easily discounted.
The Bohemian company had been established
a year, and appeared to be reliable, but by the
time tho contracts of tho second year matured
the company had migrated. It is estimated that
it sold f 100,000 worth of seed in Oreen and ad
joining counties in Missouri, and one
Bpringfleld bank holds 117,000 ot
tho farmers' notes. Hon. H. O.
Mulllngs, a well-known farmer ot Green county,
attempted to warn his neighbors by an open let
ter to the local papers, and was immediately an
swered by twenty equally well-known farmers
who declared that there waa no swindle. The
Bohemian company appeared to have the advan
tage, but Mulllngs continued to peg away and
John H. Bennett, a farmer, waa arrested Monday
on an indictment found by the grand jury. The
officers of tho company left the city some time
ago, and it is believed that they have been in
dicted. Tho offloers are J. X. Btoner of Grand
Island, Neb., and a 8. Cox, of Bryan, Ohio.

blow wblob almost knocked her senseless. She
soon recovered herself, and attempted to make
her escape, nor maniac husband seised a loadod
pistol and pursued her. When about sixty yards
from tho house he overtook her, and placing the
pistol against her breast, deliberately fired two
shots, killing her instantly. He then fired two
shots luto his own body, and died in about ten
minutes. Six little children, all girls, wero left
orphans by this horrible affair.
