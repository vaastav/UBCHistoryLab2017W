with similar institute work in other
states at the present time and show
up better than in . many other states
on the first tour.
The breaking up of the train after
the trip on the L. & N. was done with
considerable regret, even though the
tour from 'the start has been of con
siderable length. A great many pho
tographs have been taken at the dif
ferent places that will serve as pleas-

members of the university staff.

having arrived on the Southern States
Lumber Co.'s excursion. Dinner was
served by the ladles of Muscogee to
the officials of the university and I
& N. officials. Mesdames W. R.
Vaughn, J. D. Trammell, Oscar Wil
liams and Misses Jean and Susie Ne.1l
Patterson and Myrtle Nipe had made
extensive preparation and served a
dinner that was truly a feast. After
dinner Mr. C. K. McQuarrie, in a fev
well selected words, expressed the ap
preciation of the guests. Holly and
mistletoe graced the dining room and
tables, all of which added to the final
day's proceedings that feeling of
gratitude and satisfaction that was
characteristic of the entire trip.
After dinner the visitors passed
through the cars and then assembled
In a nearby auditorium to listen to
the speakers.
Profs. Rolfs, McQuarrie and Spencer
each took up their subjects and held
a splendid institute lasteing one hour
and thirty minutes.
Hon. P. K. Yonge accompanied the
train and gave his usual support to
the proceedings of the day.
The equipment of the train was
packed away after the final stop, the
L. & N. having ' already arranged to
have the equipment returned to River
Junction, leaving Peneacola at 8 p. m.
Mr. Lister, agricultural agent of the
trie- train since it was taicen over Dy
the iL. & N. He has taken a keen In
terest in its welfare and management
and considers it a most successful un
dertaking. Mr. E. O. Saltmarsh and
Mr. J. W. Lurton, while on account of
urgent office duties were unable to ac
company the train but for a short
time, have expressed themselves In a
very favorable manner.
The university officials desire to ex
press their appreciation of the liberal
support given by the L. & N. officials
and the citizens of Florida.
The trip has been a very satisfac
tory one from every standpoint and
West Florida has responded liberally
at every call.
The University of Florida officials
also appreciate the liberal space given
by the press of Pensacola and the
state of Florida.

MEXICAN PAPER PRINTS
PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE
. By Associated Press.
Mexico City, Dec 16. El Imparlal
at this late date prints an editorial
regarding President Taft's message to
congress on foreign relations, -which
was presented December 7.
The affirmations contained in the
message, the newspaper says, "are so
definite that they may be taken as
outlining a policy applicable to all
cases. That policy can be called simply
Intervention, in asmuch as the Madero
government may find Itself shortly
confronting a similar situation to that
in which the Diaz government was
placed."
The newspaper points to the presi
dent's message as proof that the
"phantasm" of intervention confronts
the Mexican nation. It refers sati
racally to Ambassador Wilson's pene
tration, which, at the early date of
his interview with Mr. Taft, enabled
him to perceive a situation which no
Mexican saw and which, only present
ed itself later.

PENSACOLA, ST. ANDREWS &
GULF S. S. CO.
The Pensacola Sunday School Ath
letic League will conduct an "athletic
badge test" In the gymnasium of the
Young Men's Christian Association on
January 1st.
The "athletic badge test" is a kind
of athletics that is planned to reach
every boy and give him a. definite
physical standard toward which to
work. He may win without defeating
other boys. It is necessary only for
him to bring himself up to a pre
scribed standard of physical efficiency.
Many boys who greatly need physi
cal development take no part in
athletics because they feel that there
is no chance for them to succeed in
competition with those of exceptional
ability. In the badge test the compe
tition is against standards instead of
against individuals. These standards
are within the reach of the average
boy.
Xhe exceptional boy are few; the
average boys are many. The athletic
badge test is a form of athletics that
gives the average boy a chance. No
classification as to age, weight or
height is made for the standards here
given, but in the Sunday schools a
satisfactory rating in effort, proficiency
and deportment is required for at least
a month before the official tests are
made. Thus the badges stand for both
good Sunday school work and physi
cal ability.
In order that there may be an op
portunity for advanced attainment,
two grades of standards have been
established which are as follows:
Class A:
Standing broad jump, 5 feet 6 inches.
Pull up (chinning on bar) 3 times.
Running high Jump, 3 feet 3 inches.
Snap under bar for distance, 3 feet j
9 inches.
Class B:
Standing broad jump, 6 feet 3 inches
Pull up (chinning on bar) 5 times.
Running high jump, 3 feet 9 Inches,
