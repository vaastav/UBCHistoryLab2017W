SPANISH PRISONERS REPORT.
Manila, Dec. 12. General Gregorio
Del Pilar, commanding Agninaldo's
body guard, was killed by Major Pey
ton March's batallion of the Thirty
third infantry, in afight eighteen miles
northwest of Cervantes. According to
reports which General Young obtained
from escaped Spanish prisoners at Vi

the coast, where he was pursuing
Aguinaldo, and encountered General
Del Pilar on a fortified trail. They
fought for four hours, during which
time seventy Filipinos were killed and
wounded. The American loss was one
man killed and six wounded. The
Spaniards report that Major March is
still pursuing the insurgents. Del
Pilar was one of the leaders of the

Chicago, Dec. 12. Some time ago a
company was formed under the name

The grading and bridging is completed
and fifteen miles of track laid. This
work is being completed at the rate of
a mile a day, and it is expected that
the entire road from Williams to the
canyon, a distance of forty-seven miles,
will be completed before cold weather
begins. The railroad will run along-
the brink of the gorge for twenty miles
The company will be an independent
enterprise, but closely allied with the
Santa Fe, which will run its trains over
the tracks of the new company. The
new road has a double object in view
the opening of a tourist line to the can
yon, and the development of the rich
copper and other mineral deposits in
the district.

TWO IMPORTANT DECISIONS.
The Law which Prohibits raying Miners
in Scrip and the Eight Hour Lav.
Topeka, Dec. 12. The scrip law met
a violent death at the hands of the su
preme court. It was declared repug
nant to tha fourteenth amendment to
the federal constitution and therefore
invalid.
This law, in substance, made it un
lawful for any corporation employing
over ten persons to pay those persons
in anything other than lawful money
of the United States. The object to be
sought was to deprive mining compa
nies in Southeastern Kansas from pay
ing their employes in scrip or mer
chandise. The court also held the eight-hour
law valid. This decision was made in
a case brought up fr-m Junction City,
where a contractor was arrested for
working his employes more than eight
hours a day in the construction of a
court house. Labor Commissioner
Johnson will now endeavor to enforce
this law cci all public w ork.

Rafter's case be suspended until cer
tain accounts for the provisioning of
sick soldiers onboard the transport are
settled. In a protest which Major
Rafter has filled with the war depart
ment, he represents that he is not re
sponsible for conditions which prevail
ed on the Tartar.

OLDEST MAN IN AMERICA
Tells How He Escaped the
Terrors of Many Winters
by Using Feruna.
Mr. Isaac Brock, the Oldest Man in the
United States.
Mr. Isaac Brock, of McLennan county,
Tex., has attained the great age of 111
years, having been born m 1788. He is an
ardent friend to Peruna and speaks of it in
the following terms:
"During my long life I have known a
great many remedies for coughs, colds,
catarrh and diarrhoea. I bad always sup
posed these affections to be different dis
eases, but I have learned from Dr. Hart
man's books that these affections are the
same and are properly called catarrh.
"As for Dr. Hartman"s remedy, Peruna,
I have found it to be the best, if not the
only reliable remedy for these affections.
"Peruna has been my stand-by
for many years, and I attribute my
good health and my extreme age to
this remedy. It exactly meets all
my requirements.
"I have come to rely upon it almost en
tirely for the many little things for which
I need medicine. I believe it to be espe
cially valuable to old people."
Isaac Brock.
Catarrh is the greatest enemy of old age.
A person entirely free from catarrh is sure
to live to a hale and hearty old age. A free

Track Tanks for Freight Engines.
The use of track tanks by which lo
comotives of high speed passenger
trains may take water without stop
ping is almost universal on the larger
Eastern roads, where fast expresses are
the rule. The B. & O. R. R. has a
number between Washington and Phil
adelphia and intends to equip the en
tire Main Line in the future. This de
cision was recently arrived at through
the use of passenger locomotives,
equipped with water scoops, on fast
freight trains. It was found that much
time was saved, danger from stopping,
being reduced to a minimum and cost
of running lessened. The extra stops
for water take much time and the wear
and tear on equipment is no small
matter. If the experiment on this part
of the road proves successful, track
tanks will be installed on every divi
sion between Baltimore and Chicago.
As a starter, the 50 new Vauclain com
pound engines recently ordered will be
fitted with water scoops.
