HI.K.J This Forty-ninth OungruM Iw an at
noon to-day. In tlic onata urcry ; state was
represented except Nevada. In thuhouso
only live membeis nerc absent. Tlic throng
nf spectators in the house looked down upon
a stirring , noNy cene. In the senate the
v i.sitors saw unreal deal otordor and dignity.
The greatest interest was manifested fn the
proceedings of Uiu house , although people
who loohi'd down > on the grey licndo In thu
Konatc seemed to he highly unlciialncd with
thu rigid ilecoinm they saw theic. There
was a great crowd on the lloor ot the house.
There wcie notorious lobbyists , prominent
ex-members In the laughing and talking
throng , well known ilgntus of the house were
there , and new members who have already
attracted attention either by defeating old
member0 , or for having uttalned fame in
some other \\ny , were there.
Jlr. KasMin , who was minister to Austria
some t line IIKO , was prf-enf , wearing nn over-
eoat with an liniiien > e fur collar , "Itiche-
lieu" llohlnson , with his abundant locks of
waving white hair and benevolent fiiee w.is
present. lie Is not a member "f this con
gress but attracted as much attention as any
limn on thoiloor. .Mr. Kandnll wan early In
the seat he has occupied for ten years , ex
cept during the period he was speaker. He
Mas in a Milt of clerical black , with a piofes-
gionnl crumpled shirt front seeking wider
liberty outside hid vest. Mr. llolmau.
\vilh his clean cut features and
grcv beard , sat quietly In his favorite seat.
Mr. Pulitzer , of New York , with tils keen
fiwo and dark hair brushed up on end alter
the fiiPhlon of a German student , was .read-
i . j his own paper in a corner and was not
much observed by members. Perry Uelninut
looked like a clwart beside a bin New Yorker ,
frith whom ho was talking. Tom ISecd , ot
Maine , who was chosen in the republican
( MUCUS to be the leader of his party on thu
floor , sat on a sola In the lobby , his fat moon
face wrinkled in a laugh. " 1'ig Iron" Kelley -
ley , tattler of the house , was in the -eat he
has occupied for j ears. Hu is not old In
look. " , although he la in yearft. lllsbeaid is a
trllle grey , but his hair is,1111 dark , lie sat
with one leg throw 11 over the other chatting
to his neighbor.
Hetore the clerk began to call the roll he
inked cveiy one not entitled to the privil-
edgcsofthe lloor to rctiie whilu the names
were helm ; walled. The new members sat up
In their seats like new bojs in a strange
school , but the old members dropped into
comfortable positions and many of them read
newspapers. At the conclusion of roll call
the clerk announced tHO members were pres
ent , and the next thins in order was the se
lection ot a * p < > al < er. K.inilolph Tucker
ot Virginia , who sat back near the door on
the democratic side , ro-u lii.s mrdiiun height
with gray hair and beaid and rubicund face.
Ha simply Mated he nominated John G.
Carlisle , member elect liom Kentucky.
/\s / ho took bin seat Frank His-
cock iind ilr. Cannon of Illinois rose. The
eleik recognized Mr. Cannon , and ho stated
that he nomiuated Thomas 15. Heed of
Elaine , and then sat down. Nothing bettor il
lustrates the husincss-like-way the housodoe.s
things. Tlieio were no eulogies of candi
date , and no applause. The clerks began to
cHll the roll at ouce. That took an hour or
more-ami there was a noisy hum dining the
piocess.
At- last It-was iini he It
- - i. wa * announced
that ! U5 votes had been cast , ol whii'h num
ber .Mr. Heed had .obtained 1" S aud ilr. Car

Itandolph Tuekvr of Viiglnia und
Thomas B. Iteed of Elaine to e cert the
speaker-ulectto the the chair. Mr. Carlisle had
reinulned in thu speaker's room
during these proceedings , and lie
now apppcared with .Mr. Tuekcrnn his right
ami .Mr. Heed -on his left. Thu three walked
down the main aisle , and turning to the left
approached the steps to the speaker's desk.
ilr. Carlisle looked like a sick man. There was
jm or on his face. Ho wore a black Prince
Albeit and iiwhltevest , IK * has cue of the
line.st faces in thu whole body. His voice Is
deep ami lieh , but to-day It was tremulous
unu faint at times. Hu has the modulating
of a pieaeher , aud sometimes his enunciation
isIikoMHiio clergyman's half-singing , half-
readintr of a hymn.
Sam Itandall Middled In his -cat , folded
his arms nnd kept his cold grey eyes on Mr.
Citrlisle. Some ol the men on the democratic
yl-.li ! leaned forward and put thu palm of
their bunds back of their ears to catch every
t-vllabli ) of their leaders discourse. When
Mr.Carllnlulinlshcdthciu was heaity cheering
from botli sides.
When he hud taken his seat the doorkeeper
cried out"A me.ssaire from the Fcu.ito" ; in ;
moment thu house was as quiet as night.
Then Anson Jlel'ool ; stood in the doorway
aud read three communications. Ono that
the nenatc was In session ; another ttuit
Sherman had bean elected president
pro tern , mid the Ihiid that a committee had
JxHin appointed to go with a like committee
of the house to tell the president that con
gress was In session. This over , one mem
ber wanted to adjourn , but others shouted
out , "Choose seats now ! " and the hottsu de-
cidbd tfi priH'Ced with mating its mt'mhers.

now arrived when it becomes the imperative
duty of the fennto to elect a president pro

me. 1 feel and ganl that many senators on
either side of the homo are more apt in tliu
discharge of the duties of this position ,
more experienced in tlio i tiles aud
orders of thu emite , than myself ,
still , I accept with a sincere deslixs
that I may be able to enforce the titles with
kindne s and Imuaitfallty. so as to ascertain ,
if possible , the cuse of thu majority ot the
senate , aud give to the minority Its lull con
stitutional lights aud protection. With the
sincere desire of pcrfoi in Ing this duty , 1 ap
peal to each individual for courtesy and for

the bright led carpet lending an air of cheeri
ness and waunlh to thu hall , which has been
thoroughly renovated since last spring , while
a number of desks , including the speaker's ,
wcredecoratcd with llovvers. Heie and there
groups of members werechattiug nnd fatten
ing , politlcalanimosiiles being set aside tor
tlie time being , while membeis took advan
tage ot thu occasion to extend an ac
quaintance among the older and more
experienced colleagues. The chief part of
conversation was the change of rules. The
galleries were crowded , with thu exception
of the executive gallery , which was only par
tially tilled. A majority of thespectatois
were ladies.
At noon the house was called to order by J.
13. Clark , clerk , and the hrst session of "tlie
Forty-ninth congress besran. When order

diminutive basis of grain , the whole being
Inscribed "Hennepln. " As he placed it on
the desk of Jlr. Murphy , of Iowa , the especial

Jlessrs. McDonald aud Itetd as a committee
to conduct the speaker to tlio chair.
On taking the chair Mr. Carlisle said :
Gentlemen of theHoiibOof Representatives :
In assuming the duties and responsibilities of
lids place for the second time 1 beg to icturn
my most profound thanks for the manifesta
tions of your continued confidence. It is a
compliment which I shall always remember
with pride and gratitude. Nowhere else In
the woihl can bo found a legislative assembly
which leprcscnts so great a constituency as
that represented by this house. Certainly no
similar body consisting ol an equal number
of members Is its superior in point of ability
nnd devotion to the inteicsts en
trusted to it. The privilege of pre
siding over the deliberations of such a
body Is a very high and honorahle distinction ,
the highest and most honorably it can con
fer upon any of Its members. I appreciate It
as such ; but gentlemen my lull apmeuiation
of your action to-day can best bu shown by a
conscientious , Impartial discharge of my
olllcial duty. Although it may not be wise
to make pledges in advance , I vent me to
promise that to the fullest extent of my abili
ty , the law governing tliu proceedings of the
house shall bo evenly administered.
Wo are about to enter upon th work nf an
Important session , mom important perhaps
than any that hns preceded it for many years.
Thu political relations heictoforo existing
between the two -ides of thu house and t'te
executive department of Uiu government
havu been reversed and this ot Itself will Im-
po e now duties and obligations. Under a
popular form of government like ours a po
litical change in tlie executive branch neces
sarily to a greater or less c\tuut involveal
tered methods of administration , inaugurates
a nv legislative poll y and eons eminently
prcsitnU now questions for the considera
tion of tin ) pconKi and their representative * .
It It , jioisibfu , therefore , that many suhiecU
not hcietofoio i romiucnt in our delibera
tions will eugage a largo share of your atten
tion during thu present congiess It
may reasonably bu aiithlpatcd also that
wiutt. dltlcumi-cs of opinion will < t\Kl
on ninny of thu questions , resulting in Innr ;
earnest and perhaps exciting contents on the
lloor , and It may bo that these diiferenees
will not always hu dnilucd by reconi/.ed
patty linos. Under these ciicuiin-tanuc : > a
uioper appreciation of the Integrity and
mtriotlsm of each other , a sincere respeotfor
tliu hone.it opinions of opponents in debate ,
and ihu cultivation of n spirit of mutual tor-
hcainucu will b nwe-'wry to enable tliu
house to conduct its prnm-ulngs with order
and deliberation , and avoid unpleasant inei-
' -which am always , in my experience at
; , mo.st seriously regretted by those wno
participate in them.
And now , gentlemen , before taking tlie
o.Uhof olJicp , allow me to lenew thu exme-i-
bloimuf mybiiu-eru acknowledgment of Urn
great honor you Jiavo conterrcd and the great
trust you have eon tided to my hands. I ac

Irlsli Question.
NEW Tout ; , Dec. " . ( Special to the BEE. !
The Herald's Dublin correspondent tele
graphs a long interview with Parnell on the
election. Referring to the position of Ire
land in the new paillamcnt , Parnell says :
"I look for the settlement of the nationalist
qnestlou to the liberals , rather than to tories ,
assuming that the tories and nationalists
combined about equal.to thu liberals. It
will be possible for us , by voting with the
liberals to give them a majority of 170 upon
this or any other question a majority such
as no English government has ever had , and
ona amply sulUclent to niaku up for the
score ol possible whig detections. 1 do not
regard thu formation of a coalition govern
ment as at all likely or that It would last
long. If It were formed. The settlement of
the international question between England
and Ireland will be the only vital question
before thu new parliament. This vital
question may not be settled in that parlia
ment but it not it will be put in trim for set
tlement An early dissolution will leave It
to be the issue upon which the next general
election must be fouuht and decided.
DOWN THE SHAFT.
Four Men Killed In the New Crotoii
Aqueiluur.
MnnniTS ConNnit , X. T. , Dec 7.
Another accident happened on the new
Croton acqueduct early this morning at
Shaft No. : t , and resulted in the death of four
men , ami probably fatal Injiny to the tifth.
The men weie descending In one of the
buckets used for lowering them down the
shaft. The start was made all riirht. but be
foie the bucket had descended far the cros--
beam or billy , as it Is called , caught In thu
shaft aud remained fastened till the bucket
almost reached the bottom of the shaft , when
itshook loo-e and came pushing down , a dis
tance of over one hundred feet , on the heads
of the untortunate men. The following were
killed : Francis Carr , Frederic Dresner ,
Patrick Moran. and George Buardman. The
other man will probably die. When the
cross-beam stinek the bucket he was knocked
out Into a shelving near the bottom , on the
side of the shaft. This probably saved him
from instant death.

closed here last night. Foot passengers
crossed on the ice this morning. The St.

will be necessary to wait for thu ice to be

The Kcmcdy With Congress.
WASHISGTO.V , Dec. 7. The supreme court
to-day decided Case No , 000 , the Northern Pa'
eitic Railway company appellant , from the
Mipicino court of Dakota. The suit was
brought In the district court of Trail countyi
Dakota , by the present appellant against Ivor
L. Bockner , treasurer of the county , to enjoin
him from enforcing the collection of taxes
assessed on tlic lands ot' the company in that
county. Tlie verdict was for thu defendant ,
and the supreme court of theteriltory attirmed
the Judgment. This comt now reverses the
Judgment , and the case Is remanded with
directions to cause u decree to be entered
perpetually enjoining the treasurer of Trail
county irom any further proceedings to col
lect thu tax.
This action is bafed upon the provisions of
an act of eougiess which prohibits thu con
veyance ul any granted landh to thu com
pany until the costs of the simey have been
paid to the government. Until these costs
havu been paid the government retains
title as security , and this security would be
neutralized ii the lands could be told for
taxes.
The court said : "We ore aware of the use
being made of this principle by companies ,
who , having earned the lands , neglect to pay
these coMs In order to pievent taxation. The
remedy lies with congress nnd Is 01 ea-y ai -
pllcatlou. If that body will take htepto en-
torcii its lien tor these costs of sin vey b > sale
ot the | tnds or by foifcituru of title thu
treasuryTit the United States would soon be
reimbursed trout its expenses in making
theMj surveys , and states and territories in
which these lands lay would be lernlttcd to
their appropriate rights pf taxation , "

siding near their iv < ervatlous. The Indian
otitbienks of the year aud the eame * of them
art' considered. The recommendation of the
commissioner of Indl.ui alfalfa that the le 3
guilty of tim rebellions Chlricahuasliould bo

as a penal colony , to earn their own 11 % ing

military prison at Fort Leaxenwyiih is In-
ilor cd. 11 is recommended that th" Pouth-
cm Utes bo located in Indian territory and
that the Plutcsof Otecon besettled on home
steads und given lanu implements and other
assistance. The subject of the leasing of
land by Indians to cattle companies is taken
up. and after showing the p.tssi\p consent of
'hu ' latu secietary to such leases and thu evil
that has resulted from the practice , the secre
tary says :
Kroui all this facts developed on the subject
lam convinced that the assistance rcndeied
by HIM respective Indian agents , In the mak
ing of these alleged leases , was directed more
for thu Interest of the cattlemen than that of
thu Indians placed under their eare aud super
vision. Wlnlo many of the Indians favor
the leasing ot their hinds for grazing pur-
po es , other * opposed and piotesled against
such u--e and occupation of tlielr iv-en-ations
and refused to iarticipate Iu thu making of
the alleged IeaM ! > , or to accept any harc of
the money received theieiindcr. bulllcieut
intliiciiL-e , however , seems to have been
bioiiL'iit to bear upon a majoiity of the ie-
bpeciive tribes to induce tliiiin to enter into
the airangements made , in my judgment ,
not tlie least aiming such intluenccs were thu
encouragements and persuasion of the le-
specuvu Indian agents , or some ot them m
least : and in maiij instances 1 fear they 1m u
shared in the piouts of < hcse speculative
transactions.
Alter speaking of the encroachment of
railroads on Indum tights , theseerctary savs :
It Is evident that lite Indian rare has
reached a cusis in its hitoryTlie Indians
can no longer exist in this country in a sn-
age or semwn Ilized state , nui ean thej

Jlovements of population eastward aud
northward mid soiitnwiiul have pone on with
unprecedented rapidity , until every rcsoi ra
tion is closed in and pressed upon by colonies
of srttU'is. miner : ) , ranelimun and traders
The practice ot movlntr the Indian to mure
distant te-i'ivations can bo Continued no
longer. He mii-t make his nnal stand for ex
istence where he is uoxv. Unless hu can
adapt him-eli to the necessities of tlinse new
conditions and pailaUc of this ail-pt-i vadius ;
civilization his extinction will be sine and
swift. Thu need of a permanent scheme ot
