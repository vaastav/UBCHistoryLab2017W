The subject, of opening diplomatic relations
with lloumania anil Servia, now
become independent sovereignties, is at
present under consideration, and is the
subject of diplomatic correspondence.
There is a gratifying increase of trade
with nearly all European and Ameri- j
can countries, and it is believed that, j
with judicious action to regard to its'
development, it can and will be stili |
more enhanced, and that American pro- j
ducts and manufactures will lind new 1
and expanding markets. The reports !
of diplomatic and consulate officers j
upon this subject, under the system now I
adopted, have resulted in obtaining
much valuable information which has |
been and will continue to be laid before
C'on.rtss and the public lroiu time to |
time.
THE CONDITION Of ALASKA.
The third article of the treaty with
Russia, of March 30, ln>7, by which
Alaska was ceded to the United States,
provides that the inhabitants of the ceded
territory, with the exception of ft*
uncivilized native tribes, filial! ;
he admitted to the enjoyment of all the j
rights of citizens of the United States, j
!j ~i._n u~ nni
mill SilUil Ul" lUUIUlUIU'-U rtlivt .. ,
in the free enjoyment ot their liberty of '
property and religion. The uncivilized
tribes are subject to such laws and regu- {
lations as tlie United States may from
time to time adopt in regard to the ab- j
original tribes of that country. Both
the obligations of this treaty and the
necessities of the people require that
some organized form of government
over the Territory of Alaska be
adopted. There appears to be no law J
for the arrest of persons charged with i
fnmmnn lnw nffptiG^c fill oh UK? !
sault. robbery. and murder, and no !
magistrate authorized to issue or .execute
process in such cases. Serious diffi- I
cultiesjhave alreadj arisen from offences
of;this charaetcv, not only among the |
original inhabitants, but among citizens j
of the United States and other countries j
who have engaged in mining, fishing, j
and other business operations within the ;
Territory. A bill authotizing the ap- ,
pointment of justices ,of the peace ana
constables, and the arrest and detention
of persons charged with criminal offences'
and providing for an appeal to United
States courts for the district Jof Oregon,
in suitable cases, will, at a proper time,
be submitted to Congress.
THE PUBLIC FINANCES.
The attention of Congress is called to
the annnal report of the sec retary of the
treasury on the condition of the public
finances. The ordinary revenues from
all sources for the fiscal year, ended
June 30, 187:), were ?273.827.184 46. The
ordinary expenditures for the same pe- !
riod were 8266 917,083 53, leaving a surplus
revenue for the year of $6,879,300 93.
The receiDts for the present fiscal year.
ending .June 30, 1680, actual andesti- j
mated, are as follows: Actual receipts j
for the first quarter, commencing
July 1, 1879, $79,843,633 61; estimated
receipts for the remaining threequarters
of the year, $-208,156,336 39;
Total receipts for the current fiscal year,
actual and estimated, ?*288,000,000. The
expenditures for the same period will
he, actual and estimated, as follows:
For the quarter commencing July 1,
1879, actual expenditures, $91,683,385
10; and for trie remaining three- i
quarters of the year, the expenditures '
are estimated at $172,316,014 90, making j
the total expenditures ?2t>4,000,COO, ana j
leaving an estimated surplus revenue for |
tile year ending June 30. 1880, of $24,000,000.
The total receipt during the next fiscal
year, ending .June 30,1881, estimated
according to existing .aw/?, will be $208,i
00,000. and the estimated ordinary expenditures
for the same peried will be
$278.097.304.3!). leaving a surplus of
$9,C02.635.(>1 for that year. The large
amount expended for arreq#B of pensions
during the last and the present, fiscal
year, amounting to $21,747,219.00, has
prevented the application of the full
amount required by law to the sinking
fund for the current year, hut the?e ar
rearsnaving oceasuusuimiany pjuv.. u js j
believed that the sicking fnnd '-an hereafter
be maintained without any change
of existing law.
: ? TIIK ARMY AND NAVY.
The secretary of war reports that the
war department estimates for the fiscal
vear ending .Tune .30. I8S1, are $40,380,428.93,
the same being for a Jess sura of
money than any annual estimate rendered
to Congress from that department
during a period of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the general of the arm v
in recommending such legislation as wil
authorize the enlistment of the full mi in
, ber of 25.001 men for the line of the
army, exclusive of the 3,-100 men required
for the detached duty, and therefore not
available for service in the field. He
also recommends that Congress be asked
to provide by law for the disposition of
a large number of abandoned military
posts and reservations, which, though
very valuable in themselves, have been
rendered useless for military purposes
by the advance of civilization and settlement.
He unites with the quarter
master-general in recommending that
on appropriation be made for the construction
of a cheap and perfectly fireproof
building for the s*fe storage of a
vastamount of money, accounts, vouchers,
claims, and other valuable records,
now in the quartermaster-general's
office, and exposal to great risk of total
destruction by tire. He also recommends,
in conformity with the views
of the judge advocate-general, some
declaratory - legislation in reference
to the milttary statute of limitations,
as applied to the crimc of
desertion. In these several recommendations
I concur. The secretary of war
further reports that the work for the improvement
of tho South Pass of the
Mississippi river, under contract with
Mr. Jaines B. Ends, made in pursuance
of an act of Congress, has been prosecuted
during the past year, with a
greater measure of success in the attainment
of results than during any previous
vear. The channel through the South
Pass which, at tlie beginning of June,
1875, had a depth of only seven and onehalf
feet of water, had. on the eighth of
July, 1879, h minimum depth of twentysix
foot, having a width ot not Joss than
200 fcot and a central depth of thirty
feet. Payments have been made in accordance
with the statute as the work
progressed, amounting in the aggregate
to $4,250,000, and further payments will
become due, as provided by the
statute, in event of success in main- i
taining the channel now secured. I
The reports of the general of the
arniyand of his subordinates present
a full and detailed account of the i
military operations for the repression ol
hostilities among the Indians ot the (Jto
and Apache tribes, and praise is justly
awarded to the officers and troops engaged.
for promptness, skill and courage
displayed. The past year lias been one
of almost unbroken peace and quiet on
the Mexican frontier, and there is reason
to believe that the etlbrtsof this government
and of Mexico to maintain order
in that region will prove permanently
successful. This department was enabled.
during the past year, to find tem^
porarv though crowded accommodations
and a safe depository for a portion
of its rrcords in the completed east wing
ofthe building designed for the State, war
and navy departments. The construction
of the north wing of the building, a part
of the structure intended for the use of
the war department, is being curried
forward wita nil possible dispatch, ;uid
the work should receive fioni Congress
such liberal appropriations as wiil
secure its speedy completion.
The report of thescereiaryof the navy
shows continued i.ijprovciueut in that
branch of the service during the last
fiscal year. Extensive repairs have been
made upon vessels, and two new ships
have been completed and made ready
for sea. The total expenditure of the
year ended June 30, 1879, including
specific appropriations not estimated
for by the department, were 813.555,-,
710.09. The expenses chargeable to the
year, after deducting the amount ol
i hesc specific appropriations, were 13.313,317.79,
but this is subject to
a reduction of $283,725.95), tiiat
amount having been drawn upon
wanauts. nut not paid out aunng uie
year. The amount of appropriations
applicable to tho last fiscal year was
$14.538,t>4f> 17. There wsw, therefore, a
balance of $1,479,034 37 remaining unexpcudeu
and to the credit of the department
on June 30, 1879. The estimates
for the tisoal year ending June
30. 1881 are Sl4f8(>4.l47 95, which exceeds
the appropriations for the present
fiscal year $301,897. *28. The reason for
this increase is explained in the secretary's
report. The appropriations availaide
for the present fiscal year are $14,502,250
07. which will, in the opinion of
the secretary, answer all the ordinary
demands of the service. The amount
drawn from the treasury from July 1
to Nov. 1, 1879, was $5,770,404 12, of
which $1,095,440 33 has been refunded.
leaving as the expend
ituret for that period $4,674,963.79.
IT the expenditures of the remaining
two-thirds c& uie year do not exceed the proportion
lor these four months, there will remain
nnexpended at the end of the year
S477.359.30 of the current appropriations, i
The report of the secretary shows the gratifying
fact that among all the disbursing officers
of the pay corps ol the navy, there is not one
who is a defaulter to the extent ot a single i
dollar. I unite with him in recommending
the removal of the observatory to a more j
hcalthlul locution. That institution reflects
eredit upon the nation, and his obtained the
approbation ol scientific men iu all parts ol
the world. Its removal Irorn its present
locality would not only be conducive to the
health ol its officers and professors, but would
greatly increase its nsetulness.
The appropriation lor judicial expenses,
which lias lieretotore been made for the department
ot justice in gross, was subdivided at
t he last session ol Congress, and no appropriation
whatever was made lor the payment ol
the lees ol marshals and their deputies, either
in the service ol process or for the discharge
ol other duties, and since June I/O these officers
have continued the performance of their
duties without compensationIrom the government.
taking upon themselves the necessary
incidental outlays as well as rendering their
own services. In only a low unavoidable instances
has the proj>er execution ol the process
ol the United Suites lailed by reason ol
the absence of the requisite appropriation.
This course ol official eonduct on the part ol
these officers, highly creditable to their fldcl- :
ity, was advised by the attorney-general, who
inlormed them, however, that they would j
necessarily have to rely lor their compensation
upon the prospect ol luture legislation by*

that immediate appropriations be made by
Congress tor this put pose. The act making
the principal appropriation lor the department |
ot justice at previous sessions has uniformly !
contained the lollowina clause: "And lor defraying
the expenses which may be incurred
in the enforcement ol the act approved Feb. |
2S, 1S70, entitled An act to amend an act approved
May 30, 1870, entitled An net to entoroc
the right ol the citizens ol the United
States to vote in the several States ot the
nnH fnr ntlior nurnoscs. or for I
uuy acts amendatory thereof, or supplement j
nry tiioreto." No impropriation was made lot |
this purpose for the current year. As no
general election o! members of Congress
occurred, the omission was a matter ot little |
pniotical importance. Such election will,
however, tak-i place during the ensiling year,
and the appropriation made for the pay of |
marshals and deputies 9hould iks sufficient to
embrace compensation lor the services they
may be required to periorm at. such election.
oti1kr branches op the government.
The butiness ol the supreme court is at
present largely in arrears. It cannot be expected
that more causes can be decided than
are now disposed ol in its annnal session, or
that by any assiduity the distinguished mag- !
istrates who compose, the court can accomplish J
more than is now done. In the courts ot .
many of the circuits, also, the business has j
increased to such an extent that the delay ot
justice will call the attention ot Congress to
an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all
is done in each circuit which can tairly b? expected
lront its judicial force. The evils arising
Irom delay are less heavily lelt by the
United States than by private suitors, as its
causes are advanced by the courts when it i9
seen that they involve the discussions ol questions
ol a public character. The remedy sng- !
gested by the attorney-general is the appoint- !
incnt ol additional circuit judges, and the !
creation ol an intermediate court ol errors I
and appeals, which shall relieve the supreme j
court ol a part of its jurisdiction while a largei i
force is also obtained lor the performance of I
circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to !
the consideration ot Congress. It would seeia
to a fFoiil a 'complete remedy,and would involve (
if ten additional circuit judges are appointed, .
an expenditure, at the present rateot salaries, j
of wot more than $60,<>00 a year, which would j
ccrtainly be small in comparison with the objects
to be attained.
The report ot the postmaster-general bears |
testimony to the general revival ot business
throughout tlie country. The receipts ot the :
post-offlce department lor tlio year ending !
June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, !>oing i
$704,405.91 more than the revenues ot the )
preceding year. The amiunt realized lrom
the sale ot postage stumps, stamped enTcl- j
opes and poital curds was $704,4(>5.91 more J
than in the preceding year, and $2,387,.r>59.23
more than in J S77. The expenditures ol the !
department were ?33,449,899.45, ol which the j
sum ot $370,401.63 wus paid on liabilities in- i
curretl in the preceding year. The expeuJi- {
tures during the year, were $801.21)9.77 j
less than in the preceding year. This i
reduction is attributed mainly to the operation
ol the law passed June 17, 1878, clmng- !
ing the compensation ot postmasters Irora I
a commission on the valne ol stamps sold, !
to a commission on stamps canceled. The
amount drawn lrom the treasury on ap- I
propriations, in addition to ihe revenues
ot the department, was $3,031,454.94,
being $2,270,197-80 less than in the preceding
year. The expenditures loi; the fiscal year |
ending June 30, 1881, at e estimated at $39,- j
920,900, and the receipts from all sources ut
$32,210,(HJO, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated
for out of tne treasury ol $7,710,900.
The relations ol the department with railroad
companies have been harmonized, notwithstanding
the general reduction by Congress ol j
their compensation, by the appropriation lor
special lacilitie*. The railway postoftke line* I
have been ;;reaily extended, especially in the |
Southern States. The interests ol the railway j
mail service and of the public would be greatly [
promote<land the expenditures could be more j
readily controlled, by the classification ot the
employees ot the railway mail service as j
recommended by the postmaster-general, the
appropriation lor salaries, with respect to i
which the maximum limit is already flxecl by
law, to be made in gross. The postmastersencral
recommends an amendment of the
law regulating the increase ol compensation j
lor increased aervice and increased speed in I
star routes, so as to enable him to advertise I
lor proposals (or such increased service and
speed. He also suggests the advantages to
accrue to the coinmercc ol the country Irom
the enactment ot u general law authorizing
contracts with American-built steamers, cariying
the Americw tla^, lor transporting the j
mails between ports ol the United Suites and
ports ot t he West Indict* and South America,
at a fixed maximum price |>cr inile; the
amount to be expended being regulated by
unuual appropriations, in like manner with
the amount paid lor the domestic siai service.
The arrangement made by the |?osi muster- i
general ami the secretary of the treasury lor
the collection of duty upon books jcceived in I
the mail Irom loieign countries lias proved so j
satisfactory in iu practical operation that the
recommendation is now made that Congress j
shall extend the provisions ot theactol March ;
1S79, under which this arrangement was I
made, so as toapply to all othei dutiable arti- i
cles rcccivod in the mails from loreign conn- !
tries.
THE INDIAN WAKOS.
The reports ol the secretary ol the interior >
and ol the commission ol Indian allairs, set- j
ting lorth the present state ol our relations
with Ihe Indian tribes 011 < ur territory, the
measures taken to advance their civilization
and prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them, will be found ol more than
ordinary interest. The general conduct ol I
our inumn population uas ueen so auiiMaciury ,
that the occurrence of two dislurliances, which |
resulted iu bloodshe<i anil destruction ol prop- |
erty, is uli the more lo be lamented. The !
history ot the outbreak on the White river !
ITtc reservation, in western Colorado, lius become
so lamiliar by elaborate reports in the
public press that its remarkable incidents need
not to be slated here in detail. It is expected
that thtj tettlement ot this difficulty will lead
to sucu arrangements us will prevent lurther
hostile contact between the Indians and the
lx>rder settlements in western Colonulo. I he
other disturbance occurred at the Mescalero
agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria, the j
head ol a aiuall bund ol marauders, alter coin- j
mining many utiocities, being vigorously i
chased by a military lorcc, made his way :
across the Mexican border, and is row on !
foreign soil.
While these occurrences, iu which a com- J
parutiveiy small number of Indians wert en !
gaged, are most deplorable, a vast majority oi
our Indian population have fully justified the
expectations ot those who believed that bj
humane and peacctul influences, the Indian
can l>e led lo abandon the habits of savage life
una io uevejop a capacity lor useiui ana civilized
occupations. What they have already
accomplished in the pursuit of agricultural
and mechanical work, the remarkable success
which has attended the experiment ol employing
as freighteis a class ol Indians hitherto
counted nmorg the wildest und most intractable,
and ihe general and urgent desire expressed
by them lor the education of their
children, may be taken hs sufficient prool that
they will be lonnd capable ot accomplishing j
much more it they continue to be wisely and i
iuirly guided, l'he Indian policy sketched in
the report of 'he secretary ol the interior, the
object ol which is to make liberal provision
for the education ol Indian youth, to settle
the Indians upon larm lots in severalty, to
give them title in lee to their farms, inalienable
lor a certain number of years, and when
their wants are thus provided lor, to dispose
by sale of the lands on their reservations not
occupied and used by them, a fund to be
formed out ol tho proceeds lor the benefit ol
the Indians, -which will gradually relievo the
government of the expenses now provided
lor by annual appropriations, must commend
UfAlfAb ?'?of nn/1 KnimflnSn' tn the* In/linno ?m1
as also calculated to remove those obstructions
which the existence ol large reservations
presents to the settlement and development
ol the country. I therefore earnestly
recommend the enactment of a law enabling
the government to give Indians a title in Ice
innlienable lor twentv-flve years, to the farm
lands assigned to them by allotment. I also
repeat the recommendation mado in my first
annual message that a law be passed admitting
Indians who can give eatislactory prool
ol having by their own labor suppoi ted their
families for a number ol years, und who are
willing to detach themselves l'rom their tribal
relations, to the benefit ol the homestead act,
and to gTant them patent* containing the same
provisions ot inalienability lora certain period.
The experiment ot sending a number ot Indian
children ol both sexes to the Hampton Normal
and Agricultural Institute in Virginia to
receive an elementary J?n*;libh education and
practical instruction in tanning and other <seiul
industries, has led to rosults so promising
that it \ttv> thought escodieni to turn over
i
the cavalry barracks at "Carlisle,In Pennsylvania,
to the interior department, lor the establishment
ot an Indian school on a larger
scale. This school has now 158 pupils, selected
irom various tribes, and is in lull opI
eration. Arrangements are also made lor the
education ol a number of Indian boys and
girls, belonging to tribes on the Pacific slope,
in a similjr manner, at Forest Grove, in
Oregon. These institutions will commend
themselves to the liberality ol Congress and
to the philanthropic munificence olthe*Amer|
icon people.
Jjtst. spring information was received of the
i organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, ?ho ohjcct of which was the
occupation, by unauthorized persons, of certain
lands in the Indian Territory ceded hy
the Chcrokees to the government for the purpose
ol settlement by other Indian tribes. On
the twenty-ninth ot April I issued a prcclomation
warning all persons against participation ;
in such an attempt, and, by the co-openuioii
of a military force, the invasion was promptly
chpcked. It is mv purpose to protect the i
rights of the Tndinn inhabitants of that Territory
to the lull extent ol tho executive power;
but it would be unwise to ignore the fact that
a Territory ?o largo and so fertile, with a
population so sparse and so great a wealth o[
I unused resources, will be loundmore exposed
j to the repetition of such attempts as happened
I this year when the surrounding States ore
I more densely settled and the westward movement
of onr population looks still more
J engerly lor fresh lauds to occupy. Undor
! such circumstances the difficulty ol maintainI
ing the Indian Territory in its present state
( will greatly increase, and the Indian tribes
inhabiting it would do well to prepare lor such
a contingency. I therefore fully approved
the advice given to them by the necretary
I ot the interior to divide among themI
selves in severalty as large a quantity ot
their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire
invividual titles in lee, instead of their present
tribal ownership in common, and to consider
in what matter the balance ol their lands may
be disposed ol by tbo government lor their
benefit. By adopting such a policy they
| would more certainly secure lor themselves
the value of their possessions, and at the same
time promote their progress in civilization
and prosperity, tb:ui by endeavoring to per.
petuate the present stat? ol things in the Territory.
Tho question whether a change in
the control ol the Indian service should be
made was, in the Forty .fifth Congress, referred
to a joint committee of both lionses lor i
inquiry and report. In my last annunl message
I expressed the hope that the decision of ]
that question then in prospect " would arrest
further agitation ol this subject, such agitation
being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon '
the sen-ice, as well us the Indians themselves."
Since then, the committee having reported,
the question has been decided in the negative
by a vote in the House of Representatives for
the reasons here stated, and in view ol the
fact that further uncertainty on this point *
will be calculated to obstruct other much- I
needed legislation, to weaken the discipline ol |
the service, and to unsettle salutary measures |
now in progress lor the government and improvement
of tho Indians, I respectfully j
recommend that the decision arrived at by
Congress at its last session be permitted to j
stand.
THE PUBLIC I.AND8.
KfTorts made by the department ol the interior
to arrest the depredations on the timber ,
lands of the United States have been continued,
and have met with considerable suc
? -< ~i .????? I
cess. A large nuinwr 01 ??? m u c-?f#?<?
huve been prosecuted in the courts of the
United States. Others have been settled, the 1
trespassers offering to make payment to the
government lor the value of the timber taken I
by them. The proceeds ot these prosecutions ]
and settlements, turned into the treasury, for j
exceed in amount the sums appropriated by >
Congress for this purpose. A more important (
result, however,consists in the fact that the destruction
ol our public lorests by depredations
although such cases stilloccur,has been greatly
reduced in extent, and it is probable that it
the present policy is vigorously pursnod and 1
sufficient provision to that end is mane by
Congress, such trespasses, at least those on a 1
large scale can be entirely suppressed, except
in the territories where timber lor daily requirements
ol the populations cannot, under :
the present state of the law, be otherwise ob- !
tained. I therelore earnestly invite the atten- j
tion ol Congress to the recommendation .
made by the secretary ol the interior, that a
law be enacted enabling the government to
sell timber from the public lands, without
conveying the fee, where such lands are principally
valuable for the timber thereon, such
snles to be so regulated as to conlonn to I
domestic wants and business requirements, I
while at the same time guarding against a <
sweeping destruction ol the forests. The ;
enactment ol such a law appears to become a <
more pressing necessity every day. j
AUK1C0LTDRE AND EDUCATION, I
My recommendations in former messages <
arc renewed, iD favor ol enlarging the facil- 1
itics ot the department ol agriculture.
Agriculture is the lending interest and the
permanent industry ol our peoplo. It is to the I
abundance ot agricultural production, as compared
with our home consumption and the j
lurgely-increascd and highly profitable market
abroad which we have enjoyed in recent j
years, that we are mainly indebted for our j
present prosperity as a people. We mast look j
lor its continued maintenance to the same
substantial resource. There is no branch of
industry in whic.i labor, directed by scientific '
knowledge, yields such increased production !
in comparison with unskilled labor, and no :
branch ol the public service to which the en- i
eonragement of literal appropriations tan be !
more appropriately extended. The omission <
to render such aid is not a wise economy, but, ]
on the contrary undoubtedly results in losses
of immonse sums annually that might be ]
saved through well-directed efforts by the
government to promote this vital interest.
The results already accomplished with the !
very limited means hevetoloro placed at the '
command ol the department of agriculture is 1
an earnest ol what may be expected, with in- 1
cieased appropriations tor tho several purposes
indicated in the rej>ort of the commissioner,
with a view to placing the department
upon a looting which will enable it to prosecute
more effectively 1 he objects lor which it
is established. Appropriations are needed lor
a more complete laboratory, lor the establishment
of a veterinary division and a division ot
forestry, and lor an incrciise ol lorcc. The
requirements lor these and other purposes
indicated in the report ol the commissioner, 1
under the head ol the immediate necessities
of the department, will not involve any expenditure
of money that the country cannot
with propriety now undertake in the interests '
of agriculture.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau ol
education the extent to which educational i
privileges throughout the United States have
been advanced during the year. No more
fundamental responsibility rests upon Con- (
grt-ss than that of devising appropriate measures
of financial aid to education, supplemental
to local action in the States and 1
Territories and in the District of Columbia. ?
The wise forethought of the founders ol our
government ha9 not only furnished tho basis
lor the support of the cnmmon-9chool systems I
of the newer States, but laid the foundations '
lor the maintenance of their universities and <
colleges of agriculture and the mechanical I
arts. Measures in accordance with this tnuli- <
tional policy, lor tho further benefit of all ,
these interests, and the extension of the same
advantages to every portion of the country, it r
is hoped will receive your favorable consideration.
To preserve and perpetnate the national
literature should 1>o fuuong the lorcmost carcs 1
of the national legislature. The libruiy (
gathered at tho Capitol still remains uupro- )
videil with any suitable accommodations for (
its rapidly increasing stores. Tho magnitude |
unci importance of the collection, increased as s
it is by the deposits made under t':e law of <
copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges, J
and'by the scientific libmry ol'the Smithsonian i
Institution, call for building accommodations
which shall be Ht once equal and fireproof. 1
1 he location oS such a public building, which
should provide tor the pressing necessities ol
the pr<*3Wit, and loi tlie vast increase ot the t
nation's Ux>kf in the iuliiro is a matter which (
addresses itsell to the discretion of Congress. 1
It is earnestly recommended as a measure i
which should unite all suffrages, and which (
should no longer be delayed.
THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT. 1
The joint commission creutcd by the act oi f
Congress ol August 2,1876, lor the purpose of j
snporvimnc and directing the completion of j
the Washington national monument, ol which {
commission the President is a member, has '

The Secretary of the Interior's Repor
In his report of the condition of tl

consequence of the demand for Westei
lands for agricultural and mining pu
poses.
Speaking of the presence of troo]
among the Indians, Mr. Schurz sa;
that it is an error to suppose that tf
constant presence of force is necessary
keep the tribes quiet. Of the seventy-oi
Indian agencies, eleven have militai
posts in their immediate vicinity, an
fourteen with a military post withi
three days' march. Of the four disturl
ances within the last two yearn, thn
occurred in the immediate presence!
military force. He says: "While I ai
by no means disposed to belittle tl
deplorable nature of Indian disturbance
or the great value of a military force i
suppressing them, it is but just to tl
Indians to point out the important fa
that disturbance and hostility is tf
exception and peaceful conduct the rul<
that a very large majority of India
reservations are in a condition of unii
terrupted quiet, without the presence <
a> i uciv iii^ luiuct
Mr. Schurz's " Iiidian policy " is d(
fined thus: " First, to set the Indians t
work as agriculturists or herders, thi
to break up their habits of savatre li
and to make them self-supporting; sei
ond, to educate their youth of bot
sexes so as to introduce to the growin
generation civilized ideas, wants an
aspirations; third, to allot parcels <
land to Indians in severalty, and to gfr
them individual title to their farms i
fee inalienable for a certain period, tin
to foster the pride of individual owne
?hip of property, instead of their formi
dependence upon the tnbe with its ten
Lory held in common; Iouil.'j. when se
tlcment in severalty with odividu
title is accomplished, to dispo^, wil
their consent, of those lands on the
reservations which are not settled ar
used by them, the proceeds to form
fund for their benefit, which will gradi
illy relieve the government of the e:
penses at present provided for by annu
appropriations; fifth, when this
accomplished, to treat the Indians lil
other inhabitants of the United Stat
under the laws of the land."
The report concludcs with remarks c
the generally encouraging state of Ii
iian affairs, and with the recommend
tion that a law be enacted to authori:
the sale of timber from public. ian<
under the direct supervision of gover;
mcnt officers, and that a commission 1
appointed, composed of qualified pe

adopted in other countries for the pr

JtEPEAL OK THE LEGAL TENDER CLAUSE
>. UKGEI>.
>o Mr. Sherman devotes a good portion
is oi his report to resumption, and takes
fe up the question of the retirement of the
> legal-tender notes. He pays:
i. 44 :*. :?
a iu Jtvuiu uli uuuciutility, iu 10 ictg
spectfully recommended that by law
id the resumption fund be specifically de)f
fined and set apart for the redemption of
re United States notes, and that the notes
in redeemed shall only be issued in exis
change for or purchase of coin or bulr
lion..
er It would be only in an emergency, not
i- easy to foresee and not likely to arise,
t- that the power to sell b^nds for resumpal
tion purposes woulc be exercised, but
th it should be preserved to meet any exir
traordinavy demand for the redemption
of notes which might possibly occur.
a The secretary is, therefore, oHhe opinion
that the provisions of existing law
are ample to enable the department to
al maintain resumption, even upon the
1S present volume of United States notes.
;e In view, however, of the large inflow of
es gold into the country, ana the high
price of public securities, it would seem
)n to be a favorable time to invest a portion
of the sinking fund in United States
a* notes, to be retired and cancelled, and
J? in this way gradually to reduce the maxls
imum of such notes to the sum of $300,000,000,
the amount fixed by the re3e
sumption act.
THE SlLVF.lt QUESTION,
e. Tn regard to silver lie says: " It is
impossible to ascertain what amount of
silver coin, based upon the rates of sixteen
of silver to one ot gold, can be maintained
at par with gold, but it is manii
fest that this cnn only be done by the
government holding in its vaults the
preat body at the silver coin. It would
" seem that nothing would be gained by
l0 an unlimited coinage, unless it is desir
? able to measure all values by the silver
standard. The secretary cannot too
j. strongly urge the importance of adjustj.
ing the coinage rates of the two metals
r* ly treaties with commercial nations,
J and until this can be done of limiting
j the coinage of the silver dollar to such a
^ sum as, in the opinion of Congress,
would enable the department to readily
ls maintain the standard dollars of gold
{y and silver at par with each other."
re THE NATIONAL BANKS.
? Of the national banks he says: " The
advantages of this system over any system
of banks hitherto devised are that
rt their circulating notes are secured bers
yond peradventure of loss, they are of
e* universal credit in the country wherever
e' ssued, they are more perfectly prore
tected from counterfeiting, they equally"
ize exchanges between distant parts of
?r tlie country, they are promptly ic1_
deemed on demand at one common
place, the banks are subject to a strict
e" and vigilant surveillance by independl.
ent officers of the government, their cocdilion
is frequently made known to the
ir public, and they contribute a very large
jr percentage of their profits in the way of
r taxes. A system of banking that after
J' an existence of sixteen years, through
war and periods of great inflation and
^ great depression, has produced such resuits,
may fairly appeal fortheconfi
" | aenceanu support 01 oon^ress.
U THE CUSTOMS,
'k Mr.' Sherman, says there has been a
e- marked improvement iu the collection
i- of revenue from customs in the past two
i: years, and a saving of 8818,500.54 has
If been effected. In discussing customs
*s questions the secretary says the duties
rc collected on passengers' baggage at the
e- port of New York during the three
!D years ending the 30th of June, were as
f. follows: 1877. $63,031.11; 1878, ?86,11
750.64: 1871), .9171,857.51. The law does
js not define any limit of quantity or value
e, in regard to either household or peri*
sonaf effects of persons arriving in the
'n United States which may be admitted

Dj TIIE.INTEIIKAT. REVENUE,
i- Alter reciting the figures in the report
of the commissioner of internal revenue,
and alluding to tl.e fact that the chief
t sources of revenue are from tobacco and
spirit, the secretary says: "The very
large proportion 01 iuw revuuuc umtcu
,0 from these sources is of itself an ars/.us'
ment for the stability of the rates of
r.' taxation upon thorn. The simple agig
tation of the question of the reduction
of the tobacco tax caused a temporary
... suspension of operations in various
? manufactures of tobacco, and it is estimated
by the commissioner of internal
jg revenue "to have caused a diminution in
,? the receipts from tax on that articl.
j. during the first half year of 1878 of
jj nearly two millions of dollars. Besides
!(j reducing the income from the tax, the
,r uncertainty arising from an anticipaId
tion of a change of rated by suspending
production, threw multitudes of workj.
ing people out of employment. The
-e change of rates in the tax on tabacco
to ana spirits/or the anticipation of such
B. a change, tends at once to diminish the
e. revenue", disorganize the industries re)f
iating to those commodities, and to des.
range trade."

n How* Many People Have Fifty Dollars
Some one said the other day that in
the entire world the number of people
111 who had $50, or its equivalent in cash,
ir at their command was extremely small
> ?so small, indeed, that altogether they
lt would not outnumber the inhabitants
" of the little kingdom of Belgium, wliich
l* has it population of 6,000,000 souls, i5-.it
this estimate appears to be far below the
mark in the light of the fact that in the
savings banks of France in 1877 there
were deposited no Jess than $153,800,ts
000 by 2,863,283 depositors, the average
sum of ear.h depositor being ?60. Tnc
t, number of these depositors continually
increases, and they are, to a very large
r- extent, members of the working classes.

oofcitors in the postal savings bank is
3_ very large?not less, on the whole, than
i two millions?and their deposits, on an
{ average, amount nearer to ?250, the
| limit allowed than to*$50. In Scotland
;r : and Ireland the savings of the people
are large and constantly incrensing. In

The Way Garibaldi Fought.
"I don't believe," said MacMaho
"that he will ever be a general. E
wants comprehensiveness. He canni
foresee or provide for results in time at
space. But he is an admirable partisa:
When he was in Italy with 5,000 mei
one of his spies told hjm that he had di
covered a couple of leagues off an Au
trian force oi about 3,000 men, wf
were not aware of his proximity, ar
could be surprised and cut off. The sf
was a traitor. There were 12,000 Au
trians, and the spy had been sent to d

trap, marched against the Austrians ar
found when he approached them th;
thev far outnumbered him and we:
prepared. Most men would have r
treitefl, been followed and destroyei
He attacked the Austrians with sue
vigor that they thought their spy mu
have deceived them, and that Garibal*
was in force. He drove them from the
position, and pursued them for a coup
of miles, when they discovered tl
smallness of his numbers and turne
back on him; his troops, active and u:
incumbered, saved themselves in tl
mountains."?Forlniyhtly Review.

it from its hiding place. Thesuplta

cal student. The students pointed out
the spot where the bag was concealed,
i a find the professional threw the bag over
ot his shoulder and set out for the college,
it- The corpse, who had no knowledge of
his whereabouts, straightened out just

in With rare presence of minathe intended
er- victim of the ioke heaved his burden

calmly walked on. Had not the com,,
