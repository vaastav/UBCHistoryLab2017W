MIRRORS.
How inanv runnings up mid. down

must be fixed just right before going
out, you know, and Hall Mirrors are
very fashionable. .
Hardly any room is complete with
out one.
- Perhaps it's the bath room that's
lacking one, or a chamber wherever
it's needed, here's the Mirror to-fit the

at a price to fit the pocketbook.

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1000.
The president's- message has been
discussed more or less by newspapers,
politicians and people generally, and
the verdict1 reached in most cases is
that .the paper was. too lengthy. It
said a good deal without saying much.
If it could only be published as a ser
ial the people who have not read it
could then have a chance to do so, a
little at a time.
The Jackson Democratic association
of Washington Is arranging' for its
annual celebration of Jackson day,
January 8th next, with as much en
thusiasm as its members could pos
sibly have displayed had the party-
been victors in the late campaign. The
Jacksonians are of the same undaunt
ed brand as was '"Old Hickory" him
self, and the result. of the-campaign-
cuts iro figure in their calculations
when compared with the principles
they value far more than triumph.
The amusement committee in Hart
ford refused to grant Manager Par
fcoiH, his regular monthly license the
tirrt of December and as a consequence
i . .V
the manager is running his house with
out a license - since that time. The
committee has brought suit .again;
tile manager. Some of tlie Hartford
papers are unkind enough to say that
the cause of the trouble is because
Manager Parsons cut oil' seme of the
free tickets former! v iriveii to the mem-
. r - . -
bers of the amusement committee. The
affair promises to make a radical
change in the manner of granting
amusement licenses In : the Capitol
city.
.The sensational stories printed in
seme of -the state papers about the
Rev Father Slocum's sermon last Sun
day are so absurd and ridiculous that
a denial of them seems unnecessary.
It only goes to show that some of the
men who follow the profession in Wa
terbury are just as yellow as the. New
York Journal's Kid. Father Slocum's
discourse was highly edifying, as all
his sermons are. Not even once did he
mention th? name Tammany, neither
did he even hint at the organization.
The men who are leading the reform
crusade in New York and elsewhere
had better, while they ar? about it. get
after the newspapers that will delib
erately libil a man who is doing his
duty as he s:es it. Father Slociim
needs no champion in the -Democrat.
He is well able to fight- his own bat
tles, and it would be well for thos?
persons who are constantly distorting
and twisting his sermons to beware.
In ail probability the newsgatherer
that seat out the story never heard
the reverend gentleman preach any
sermon much less the one iu -question.
, The trust magnates are riding high

and increased cost of t evBiythihg he

way "the -full dinner pall'' which
played so prominent a part in the re
cent election is growing beautifully
less; It is only about a month since
William McKinley was re-jeleeted, aud
already the. trusts, t which gave him
such financial "support! are' beginning
to turn the screws. ,sThe steel trust,
known na the Rational Steel company,
of Mighon Junction, O., leads the way
by a sweeping redtiction 'of 33 per cent
and, anticipating trouble', is converting
its works into a sort of a. fortification.

Few events iu the official life--of our
present executive have given him such
genuine pleasure "As this graduation.
Miss Grace stood at the head of her
class, while her recod, during the en
tire course, had been one of praise
worth endeavor. The president.' to
show his appreciation of -her success,
bestowed vm an. niece- a oeuuu
ful diamond pin. ' The: gradua
tion dress, a dainty creation of white
chiffon and lace, was' Mrs McKinley's
gift. It was made at the white house,
under the personal supervision of its
gentle mistress. It . was after this
great event that the president offered
to adopt Miss Grace, formally, and
thus make her the reigning belle of the
nation. the social leader of the capital,
the only young girl ill the great pres
idential niansion.at Washington. This
was surely a tempting offer, but It did
not swerve this beautiful and brilliant
girl from a long cherished -aspiration.
She wished to use her gifts in a tit
tfiig way. in one to which she had
endeavored to train herself during her
long and severe probation at Mount
Holyoke. She chose the arduous pro
fession of a school teaoher, and this

A democratic caucus of the house is
now in session, to decide upon the
party policy to be followed in dealing
with tlie army reorganization bill,
tlie republicans will push at once.
A treaty has been, signed with
Nicaragua,, giving fluted States the
right to eoustruc.t ail: : operate the
Nicaragua canal. " which will be sent
to the senate for ratification, but
whether tlie Panama-lobby will allow
it to be acted upon, only time can tell.
Senator Martin, of -Virginia, said of
the attitude of tiie democrats toward
the legislation of the session: "I see.
no reason for any captious objection or
dilatory tactics on the part, of the
democrats. 1 do not mean that tlie
minority. lias no responsibility but that
the. democrats will be satisfied with a
statement of their objections, and with
recording their votes against bills they
do not approve."

WASHINGTON, Dee. 5 The annual
report f Secretary of the Treasury Gage
shows that the revenues of the govern
ment for the lis :.l year i-iidod June 30
last were $M;!),r;)r.-j3148 and the exp-n:
dituies lor the same period $5UO,00S,371,

with the fiscal year 'lSHO receipts in
creased $oS.13,-12(;.j:i and expenditures
tU-creased $117,35S.3S8.14. .'
The revenues for the fiscal yenr 1901
are estimated at $f )S7,77;V25o.fi2 aud the
expenditures at !f(i07,773253'.tl2. or a sur
plus of $SO.t!00,000.
For the fiscal year 1902 the receipts are
estimated at S71t!.(o3.042 ami the ex
pcnditiu'cs at $;iy0.:i74.804.24, or an esti-
f mated surplus of $2Si,258,237.7G. '
"The net increase dtiring the year of
national bank capital was $19,031,850,
the total authorized stock of all banks on
June 30 beiug $027.ri03.095.
"The imports7 of the year wbre $819,-.

increase of $152,702,(395. This large in

"The operation of the act of March 14
last with respect to these two iniportaut
niatters of our finances hes well exem
plified its wisdom. Confidence in the
purpose and power of the government to
maintain the gold standard has been
greatly strengthened. The' result is that
gold flows toward the treasury instead of
away from it. ,At the date of this re
port the free gold in-the treasury is -larger
in amount than at any. former period
in our history. Including the $150,000,
000 reserve the gold in the treasuiy be
longing to the government amounts to
over $242,000,000, while' the trejsui-y
holds besides more thin $230,000,000,
against whieh certificates have been is
sued. ",,.'.
' "That provision of the act which lib
eralized the conditions of the bank note
issue was lso wise and "timely. Under
it, " as previously shown in this report,
there has been an increase of some $77,
000,000 in bank note issues." . .
In'urghig the passage, of the Shipping
bill Secretaiy Gage says:
" "Our national greatness.. Cannot be
fully rounded out whilo we are so de
pendent as at preseat on foreign ship
ping for our intercourse with the rest of
mankind.' At this time political and com
mercial considerations demand of us a
larger measure of strength and .inde
pendence on the seas than ever in our
history, yet pever before havjj. we been
relatively "so weak in transoceanic navi
gation.' "',-'' . -' '
"A bill for the promotion of American
commerce and for the - crentian of an
American merchant marine in foreign
trade which shnll be worthy of the na
tion now awaits the action of both
branches of congress. . It conforms in
principle and general outlines to l-ecom-mendations
upon the subject in the re

Benjamin Franklin once said: "If: a

"If he has no voice in the government
