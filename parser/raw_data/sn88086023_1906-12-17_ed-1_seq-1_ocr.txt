First 6tages of tlio Strike
Portland. Dec. 17. The street car
strike which has partially tied up
traffic since late Saturday evening Is
still unsettled although no violence or
disorder has been shown. '
A lew of the motormen and conduc
tors remain firm In their alleglenoe
to the company and refuse to go out.
With these the strikers have argued
lncc-rwuntly since the beginning of the
strike on Saturday evening. During
Runduy a few cars were operated.
llauy.df the strikers spent the. entire
day at the car barns pleading with
the men who still remained faithful
to the company, to leave the bam and
Join hi the strike.
The ttreet car men have been assur
ed of the hearty support of the feder
ated trades of Portland. This has
giuen .the strikers a new hope for
success.
The Idle cars have been taken ta
the barns and crowds of strikers and
strike sympathizers throng the barns

among the men who are yet at work.
It is admitted now that had not
the crowd of spectator In the streets

evening, the first attempt wou'd have
resulted In a total failure. The street

Ten O. R. & N. freight brakemen
were discharged here last evening
for carrying hoboes on freight trains,
collecting money therefor In violation
of the rules of the road.
This Is the first trainmen discharg
ed here for this cause for almost two
years. 'I hi men discharged are most
ly nw mvii, or "boomers," as they
are called In railroad circles. They
do not work long In a place, but are
constantly changing locutions, (and
also their names) and make a regu
lar prnctice of carrying men In freight
ears wherever they work.
Owing to the' large numbers of
worklngmen traveling during the ac
tive railroad building In the north
west this year, the "hobo" "passenger
business Is said to have been extreme
ly profitable, brakemen collecting as
much us $25 per trip from this
source.
It ! In strict violation of the rules

Roosevelt to the Canal Zone Brings Out One of His
Ablest and Most Entertaining Papers.
The Work nt Panama Is Reviewed In Detail Health Conditions Are Ex
plainedTechnical Details of Construction Are Given in a Most Enter
tabling Manner Galleries and Both Houses Listen Intently.
Wnshlngton, Dec. 17. The chief
feature of the Besslon today was the
reading of tho able message of Presl-.
dent Roosevelt upon the Panama ca
nal situation. This message Is the
detailed report of the president's trip
to Panama and goes Into every feat
ure of the canal situation with a thor
oughness and technical knowledge
which Is remarkable for a man not ac
tually engaged In the work of con
struction. ,
The message was greeted with
marked attention, the galleries being
crowded and most of the members In
their seats.
After reviewing the tedious pro
cesses by which It was finally deter
mined by the United States to build
the Panama canal, the president's
message was In part as follows, on
the chief topics:
The wisdom of the canal manage
ment has been shown In nothing more
clearly than In the way In which the
foundations of the work have been
laid. To have yielded to the natural
Impatience of Ill-informed outsiders
and begun all kinds of experiments In
work prior to a thorough sanitation
of the isthmus, and to a fairly satis
factory working out of the problem of
getting and keeping a sufficient labor
supply, would have been disastrous.
The various preliminary measures
had to be taken first; and these could
not be taken so as to allow ns to be
gin the real work of construction prior
an January 1 of the present year. It
then became necessary to have the
type of the canal decided, and the
only delay has been the necessary de
lay until June 29, the date when the
congress definitely and wisely settled
that we should have an 85-foot level
canal.
Immediately after that the work be
gan In hard earnest and has been con
tlnued with Increasing vigor ever
since; and It will continue so to prog
ress In the future. When the contracts
are let the conditions will be such as
to Insure a constantly Increasing
amount of performance;
Health Showing Is Good.
Just at present the' health showing
on the Isthmus Is remarkably good
so much better than In most sections
of the United States that I do not be
lieve that It can possibly continue at
quite Its present average. Thus, early
In the present year a band of several
hundred Spaniards were brought to
the Isthmus as laborers, and additions
to their number have been made from
time to time; yet since their arrival
In February last but one of those
Spaniards thus brought over to work
on the canal has died of disease, and
he of typhoid.
Two others were killed, one in
railroad accident, and one by a dyna
mite explosion. There has been for
the last six months a well-nigh steady
decline In the death rate for the pop
ulation of the zone, this being largely
due to the decrease In deaths from
pneumonia, which has been the most
fatal disease on the isthmus.
In October there were 99 deaths of
every kind among the employes of
the Isthmus. There were then on the
rolls 5500 whites, seven-eighths of
them being Americans. Of these
whites but two died of disease, and
ns it happened neither mnn wns an
American.
Of the 6000 white Amerlcnns, In
cluding some .1200 women and chil
dren, not a single death has occurred
In the past three months, whereas In
nn average city In the United States
the numher of denths for a similar
number of people In thnt time would
have been about 30 from disease. This
very remarknble showing can not of
course, permanently obtain, but It
certainly goes to prove thnt If good
care Is taken the Isthmus Is not a par
ticularly unhealthy place.
In October, of the 19,000 negroes
on the roll 86 died from disease;
pneumonia being the most destructive
disease, nnd mnlarlal fever,, coming
second. The difficulty of exercising
a thorough supervision over the col
ored lnhorers Is of course greater than
la the case among the whites, nnd they
are nlso less competent to take core
of themselves, which accounts for the
fact that their death rate Is so much
higher thnn thnt of the whites. In
spite of the fact that they hnvo been
used to similar climatic conditions.
Even among the colored employes It
will be seen that the death rate Is not
high.
Cnro of Employe.
Next In Importance to the problem
of sanitation, and Indeed now of equal
Importance, is the problem of secur
ing and caring for the mechanics, la
borers, and other employes who ac
tually do the work on the canal and
the railroad.
This great task has been under the
t mm
control of Jackson Smith, and on the
whole has been well done. At pres
ent there ore some 6000 white em
ployes and some 19,000 colored em
ployes on the Isthmus. I went over
the different places where the differ
ent kinds of employes were working;
I think I saw representatives of every
type of both at their work and In their
homes; and I conversed with probably
100 of them all told, choosing them
at random from every class and In
cluding those who did not come to
present certain grievances. I found
those who did not come specifically to
present grievances almost Invariably
expressed far greater content and sat
isfaction with the conditions than did
those who called to make complaint.
Nearly 5000 of the white employes
had come from the United States. No
man can see these young, vigorous
men energetically doing their duty
without a thrill of pride In them as
Americans. They represent on the
average a high class.
Doubtless to congress the- wages
paid them will seem high, but as a
matter of fact the only general com1
plaint made to me upon the Isthmus
wns that, owing to the peculiar Bur
roundlngs, the cost of living, and the
distance from home, the wages were
really not as high as they should be
In fact, almost every man I spoke
to felt that he ought to be receiving
more money a view, however, which
the average man who stays at home
In the United States probably likewise
holds as regards himself.
New Records in Excavating.
As soon as the type of canal was
decided this work began In good
earnest. The rainy season will short
ly be over and then there will be an
Immense Increase In the amount taken
out; but even during the last three
months. In the rainy season, steady
progress Is shown by the figures: In
August, 212,000 cubic yards; In Sep
tember, 291,000 cubic yarus, and In
October, 325,000 cubic yards.
In October new records were estab
lished for the output of Individual
shovels as well as for the tonnage haul
of Individual locomotives. I hope to
see the growth of a healthy spirit of
emulation between the different shovel
and locomotive "crews. Just such a
spirit as has grown on out battleships
between the different gun crews In
matters of marksmanship.
Passing through the cut the amount
of new work can be seen at a glance.
In one place the entire side of a hill
had been taken out recently by 27
tons of -dynamite, which were ex
ploded at one blast. At another place
I was given a presidential salute of
21 charges of dynamite.
On the top notch of the Culebra
cut the prism Is now as wide as It will
be; all told, the canal bed at this
point has now been sunk about 200
feet below what It originally was. It
will have to be sunk about 120 feet
farther. Throughout the cut the drill
ing, blasting, shoveling and hauling
are going on with constantly increas
ing energy, the huge shovels being
pressed up, as If they were mountain
howitzers, Into the most unlikely look
ing places, where they eat their way
Into the hillsides.
Answers the Slnndercrs.
Concluding his vigorous and thor
ough report on the canal situation,
the president says of the slanderous
reports and articles which have been
printed by various correspondents
and publications:
So much for honest criticism. There
remains nn Immense amount of as
reckless slander as has ever been
published. Where the slanderers are
of foreign origin I have no concern
with them. Where they are Ameri
cans. I feel for them the heartiest
contempt and Indignation; because, In
a spirit of wanton dishonesty and
malice, they are trying to Interfere
with, and hnmper the execution of.
the greatest work of the kind ever
attempted, nnd are seeking to bring
to untight the efforts of their country
men to put to the credit of America
one of I lie giant feats of the iircs.
Tile outrageous accusations nf these
slanderers constitute a gross libel upon
n body of public servants who, for
trained Intelligence, expert ability.
high character nnd devotion to duty,
have never been excelled anywhere.
There Is not a mnn among those di
recting the work on the Isthmus who
lias obtained his position on any other
basis than merit alone, and not one
who has used his position In any way
for his own personal or pecuniary ad
vantage. Revolutionists Arrested.
