CANADIAN EMIGRATION
OFFICIALS of the Canadian government
have been keeping tab on the movement of
settlers across their southern boundary line
and as a result of their espionage now announce
that in the season just closed approximately
104,000 immigrants arrived in Canada from the
United States, going mainly into the great wheat
country of Alberta and into the Puget Sound ter
ritory. At the same time government officials dis
covered that about 75,000 Canadians left the do
minion for United States points, by far the greater
number of them destined for California, the Pacific
coast and Gulf states.
This latter movement is a recent development.
For several years past farmers have been flocking
across the Canadian line and taking up farms un
der the Canadian law. Most of them, as has been
said, went into the wheat growing districts, and
that, too, in the face of an American tariff on wheat
which was supposed to operate in favor of the
United States and against Canada. During all of
this time few Canadians thought it necessary to
avail themselves of our tariff laws by seeking their
protection.
Now, it seems, the tide is turning, but the tariff
has had nothing to do with it; no, indeed. The
Canadian farmer has learned that in the great
southwest he can find land just as fertile as Al
berta's best and a climate that will make him won
der why he ever willingly endured the rigors of a
Canadian winter. Naturally he is packing up for
a trek southward.
Here's a welcome to him. The Canadian is a
good citizen. California cannot have too many of
his kind.
A curious political situation is the one in Mis
souri, where, although the state went Republican
by popular majority, the congressional delegation
chosen at the same election was Democratic by
thirteen to three, and the state senate is Demo
cratic by twenty-two to twelve.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
ALTHOUGH the average reader may require
some time for the proper digestion and as
similation of President Taft's voluminous
message to congress which is printed in today's
issue of The Herald, there are salient features in
the document that immediately challenge atten
tion. He urges that the tariff revision board be
made permanent and that all future revisions be i
made schedule by schedule. This is encouraging, .
but that the president is not ready to admit that
the last effort at revision was in effect a total fail
ure is evident. Nothing will be done in the way !
of tariff revision until 1911, according to the presi- ,
dent, and by that time congress will have assumed !
a new political complexion, which will doubtless
result in a careful revision, schedule by schedule
and DOWNWARD. Regarding the tariff, he
says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty in the
Payne tariff act have been subject to a great deal
of criticism, some of it just, more of it unfound
ed, and to too much misrepresentation. In order
to avoid criticism of this kind in the future and
for the purpose of more clearly conforming to the
party promise, congress at its last session.made a
provision, at my request, for the continuance of a
board for the ascertainment of the cost of produc
tion at home and abroad of the. various articles
included in the schedules of the tariff."
Not to be taken entirely as a platitude or a
stereotyped form, perhaps, is Mr. Taft's demand
for economy in the administration of the nation's
affairs. The public has been aroused by the "pork
barrel" methods in river and harbor and public
building bills, and the president is but following a
national demand when he states that appropria
tions for these purposes should be based solely on
the report of a commission of experts.
Postmaster General Hitchcock's sorry sop to
the public, which is demanding a parcels post as
the only relief from the greedy clutches of the
express companies, is adopted by Mr. Taft, who
says :
" "With respect to the parcels post, I respect
fully recommend its adoption on all rural delivery
routes and that eleven pounds be made the limit
of delivery in such post, with a view to its general
extension when the income of the postoffice will
permit it."
This is the Hitchcock-express trust program at
a gulp, as the only places in which the business of
the express companies does not flourish are the
rural districts.
Mr. Taft's message does not bear out the report
circulated frequently that the president has gone
over to the progressives. His message is typical
of the cautious, smiling executive, who above all
else hesitates to create a sensation or disturb the
equilibrium of the business world. Note this:
"I believe it to be in the interest of all the peo
ple of the country that for the time being the ac
tivities of government, in addition to enforcing the
existing law, be directed toward the economy of
administration and the enlargement of opportuni
ties for foreign trade, the conservation and im
provement of our agricultural lands, the building
up of home industries and the strengthening of
confidence of capital in business investments."
In brief, the president's message is what was
expected it will not cause surprise or occasion a
flurry; it conveys an excellent mental impres
sion of the man who wrote ita man who first
and foremost is a jurist who prides himself on his
safe, sane and conservative decisions.
The only conclusion we can reach in the mat
ter is that the local dealers in foodstuffs don't read
the telegraph news dispatches.

DOINGS AMONG "WEALTHY IDLERS"
THE other day a Pennsylvania newspaper open
ly accused Los Angeles of being a community
of "wealthy idlers." Industrial and commer
cial things were not encouraged here, it said, and
the humble toiler in coarse working garments is
.persona non grata. If these things are so Los An
geles and Southern California are developing in a
way to cause the idlers great unhappiness. Here
are some of the recently announced incidents of
progress:
The Southern Pacific has purchased the inter
urban electric systems and will spend not less than,
$20,000,000 unifying and expanding them. A fast
new electric express over S. P. tracks to Pasadena.
will be a feature. Meantime the "subway" line to!
the coast and the skyscraper depot on Hill street
will be pushed.
President Diaz has granted the S. P. interests a
concession for a new line that will bring about di
rect railroad connection between San Francisco,
Los Angeles and the City of Mexico. It is said j
that the road will cost $12,000,000 and that work
will begin in 1911.
The immense coast line steamers, the Yale and I
Harvard, brought from New York, and the Ad
miral Sampson, will within a few weeks open a
daily freight and passenger service between Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
Bates & Cheeseborough of New York and San
Francisco will increase their Pacific coast fleet to
seven steamers, four of which will run as far north
as Portland, and all running to Panama.
Traffic on the transcontinental railroads con
tinues heavy. After January 1 the Santa Fe will
double its service from the east.
In the industrial line things are by no means
dull in and around Los Angeles. The George
Gates Concrete Tie Supply company of New York,
it is announced, has selected this city as the site
for a Pacific coast factory to be capitalized at
about a million dollars.
It will require about one million brick to build
the Harvey-Braun fruit cannery now under way
at Ontario.
The Southern California Gas company, with a
capitalization of $10,000,000, has been formed to
lav mains to interior towns as far as San Bernar
dino and extend the suburban supply here. It is a
subsidiary of the i acinC Light and Power.
The City Railway company, a subsidiary of the
Los Angeles Railway company, has been formed
with $5,000,000 paid-up capitalization to take over
the construction work of the parent corporation.
The visit of a group of Standard Oil capital
ists to this city in the last fortnight is believed to
presage large, investments in the Coalinga, Midway
and Bakersfield oil districts.
J. C. McDowell of Pittsburg announces that a
company will be formed to pipe the natural gas
from the Central California fields to Southern Cali
fornia. The advent of this cheap fuel would great
ly stimulate all industries.
Agriculturally speaking, things are not looking
so bad. For example, the Lima Bean Growers' as
sociation has already shipped out nearly 500 car
loads and paid over $600,000 to the farmers of Ven
tura county. Similar tales are told in other fruit
and vegetable lines.
General W. H. Bixby, chief of engineers, has
recommended in his annual report appropriations
aggregating $270,000 for the continuation of work
on Los Angeles harbor. The capacity of the har
bor is steadily being extended with longer channels,
new wharves, and slips.
When we come to the building question things
grow real interesting. The valuation of new build
ings for November, 1910, was $2,228,6630r almost
a million above November, 1909. It is known now
that the total for this year will exceed twenty-one
millions and break all records.
Superintendent J. H. Francis says 5000 new
pupils arc being added yearly to the city schools,
and that 14 new buildings will be required next
year.
The city has grown too fast for the city engi
neer's department and the Los Angeles Realty
board has been compelled to come to its aid with
the offer of outside engineers.
Henry E. Huntington has bought the north
half of tiie old Patton ranch in Pasadena for $200,
--000, and plans to make extensions to his estate
that will make it as fine as any private estate in
the world.
Of new steel skyscrapers a score are under way.
The Los Angeles Investment company will begin
on April 1 the erection of the biggest of all at
Broadway and Eighth; cost $1,000,000.
The million-dollar Chester building at Spring
and Fifth will be under way in a fortnight.
A»new hotel planned for Hollywood by Chi
cago capitalists will represent an outlay of two
millions.
Senator W. A. Clark has given a $100,000 home
for working women.
It is estimated that seventy-five buildings to
cost from $15,000 to $75,000 each are under way
in town.
An estimate of the amount of new building done
in 1910 in the towns of Southern California is
$50,000,000.
These are only the most rapid, 'cursory, thumb
nail references to activities in and around Los An
geles county. But they do very well indeed for a
community of "wealthy idlers," don't they?
Los Angeles welcomes the distinguished dele
gates to the first annual convention of the Califor
nia Bar association which began its sessions yes
terday. It is an ancient and honorable profes
sion that these men follow and their deliberations
give promise of resulting in notable improvements
in the methods of legal procedure.
It may be only a coincidence, but it is noted that
most of the American papers that speak up for the
English 'ouse of lords are of the stripe that think
highly of the Millionaires' club in Washington.,
The police of Berlin have ruled against the long
hatpin as dangerous to the public. Say what you
will, the imperialistic form of government has
some features that are not half bad.
A dispatch says "an operation for appendicitis
was performed on an ocean liner the other day."
In the absence of a statement to the contrary it is
presumed the liner stood it well.
Secretary Ballinger is quoted as sorry his state,
Washington, gave woman the ballot. There is no
reason for his apprehension. It couldn't make him
any, more unpopular than he is.
When You Get Votes, Go After Positions,
Denver Leader Tells California Women
DON'T BE TOO MODEST,
SUFFRAGETTE'S ADVICE
Dr. Mary Bates, a Guest in Los
Angeles. Sounds Warning:
'Beware of Menl'
Dr. Mary Elizabeth Bates, one of
Denver's noted woman physicians and
a parliamentarian and lobbyist of
I abilty, is a guest In Los Angeles, and
i since her appearance at the Profession
al Woman's league has been eagerly
sought by members of her profession
I and also by officers and directors of the
Political Equality association.
"One of the first and most Import
ant items for California women to re
member," she said yesterday after
noon in the Political Equality league
headquarters, "is that when they get
the vote they mustn't be too modest
about asking political positions. The
vote of women may be made a strong
political factor, and this point ' the
men have generally realized more than
the women. When we held our Jollifi
cation upon securing the right of suff
rage I suggested to the women pres
ent that we maintain ourselves as dis
tinctly a 'woman's party' and by that
method demand the passage of such
laws as we required, and the political
preferment to which our training and
qualifications entitle us, but Denver
women, failing to realize that the im
mense / vote which we polled, 49 per
cent of the total, could control, did not
accept my suggestion."
Dr. Bates cited many instances to
prove the logic of her suggestion, and
It Is unquestioned in her mind that
when the law Is adopted here women
will be wiser and more skilled in leg
islative and parliamentary procedure
and will make the franchise • some
thing vital in the political history of
their own lives and the state.
BAUOT HELPS WOMEN
"Having the ballot in Colorado has
made women realize their responsibil
ities, has made them seek to under
stand them and learn • to ..meet them.
The ability to draw and prepare a bill
for the legislature, to make It say the
tilings you want It to say, and not say
the things which will Interfere with
its passage by all the committees and
readings and other proceedings of the
session Is quite an accomplishment,"
said the speaker, "and sometimes I
have prepared a bill carefully and had
It edited and approved by district at
torneys, Judges of the higher courts
and other authorities, only to have It
altered by the change of merely one or
two little words so that its entire
meaning Is changed, and then the leg
islators claim that it is no good be
cause a woman drew and prepared It."
Dr. Bates related In a half humor
ous manner some of the experiences
which surrounded the passing of the
law known ln Denver as the "white
slave" law. The bill was kept in com
mittee until almost too late to allow
its passsage, then it was lost from the
calendar several times; in fact, so
often that ln one day Dr. Bates had
to see to Its proper placing four or

AN ESPERANTO LEMON i
Editor Herald: Reading in your pa- j
per that one Arthur Baker of Chicago,
upon the receipt of sufficient stamps,
would mail a small slip or treatise on
Esperanto, I sent him the stamps, and
after a month's delay received a re
quest to inclose $1.50 for his hook and
his magazine for one year. He must
be engaged in stamp collection, as he
did not return my stamps.

ESPERANTO AND UNITY
Editor Herald: Today's Letter Box
contains a letter signed O. H. Mayer,
claiming that because the Esperanto
congress at Washington was only at
tended by some few hundred delegates
therefore its numerical following can
not be very "strong," and he claims
attention In "fairness" to another In
ternational language. Now on the first
part ho might as well claim that the
United States congress or the Drltisli
parliament'cannot amount to much,
seeing they number only a few hun
dred representatives. Those Esperan
to delegates came from all over the
world and were the representatives
of vast numbers.
Now as to the "fairness." What
fairness (or sense either) is there In
stealing Dr. -Zamenhofs wonderful in-
I ventlon, making a few arbitrary
' changes and transpositions and then
| coming out with a "new" and "Im
proved" International language. Why,
the only excuse or ration d'etre for
a universal language is unification.
What Impudent nonsense it is then to
I pirate the one language—change It
Lnround a bit—and thus defeat the very
basic object by making two—and
three—nd even more— "Ido" has
been followed by "Antldo" and others
—all piracies from Esperanto—and of
course, claiming to be improvements
thereon. They are not improvements
—they are piracies with a few arbi
trary variations; but even if the?- had
succeeded in one or two points in
bettering the present language Esper
anto, is it not & reductlo ad übsurdum

five times. Then, when the gallery
was filled with women who came to
hear-the bill passed, the legislature
admittted a shyness in discussing it
thoroughly in the presence of the
women. , . ■
"These women came.to hear this bill
passed," said Dr. Bates, "and your
discussion will not embarrass them as
much as your failure to pass the bill."
Members of that legislative body
also approached Dr. Bates at that time
and begged her to withdraw the bill.
The child labor laws of Colorado,
about which so much comment has
been made, are eminently practical,
according to Dr. Bates. The' laws
simply provide that "no child shall be
employed at labor of an injurious
character."
: "But the club women of Colorado
have developed a 'child labor pho
bia,' " said tho speaker, "and so fear
ful are they of having their children
do any work that they hesitate to
ask them to help with the dinner
dishes or to bring in an armful of
kindling.
"According to the laws of Colorado
there Is no possibility of any child suf
fering any Injury from working and
history shows us that some of our
great men have had more "child labor'
than they have had of schooling, and
the results are frequently rather In
favor of the boys .who have had to
work."
"Child idleness Is the curse of the
land right now," continued. Dr. Bates,
"Instead of child labor. Children walk
■ to try to introduce division and con- |
flict and variety and confusion, where i
' unity and peace and the facility of i
complete uniformity are the all-in-all.
Fortunately Esperanto is now assured
of its position, but It is a pity and a
shame that people seeking the boon of
unity In language should be perplexed
and confused by the claims of half a
dozen pirated variations.

WILL HISTORY REPEAT?
-Jd'tor Herald: Years ago we were
in the wildwoods of calamity-howl
ing and after an enthusiastic conven
tion of p '".!cal protestants, many of
the b- jkered, overalled rubes in the j
country districts took heart of life and
shouted for oncoming freedom; many a 1
horny-handed American "man with
the hoe," while digging spuds, hoeing
corn, doping Insects with poison, do
ing farm chores or otherwise killing
time sang or whistled, "Good-bye, old
party, good-bye!" The Pops were very
enthusiastic, only the old party didn't
stay "good-byed" very long. After
running Weaver for president, captur
ing a few members of congress, seat
ing a governor or two, etc., the Popu
list party became a political Jonah be
ing swallowed by the Democratic
whale. The most radical Pops Joined
the Socialists, while the more conserv
ative muck-raked with the Democrats.
Years later came the Silver Republi
cans with their 16 to 1 message, and
with the so-called Jeffersonian Democ
racy and a few silver-fringed Pops,
they formed the triangular combina
tion which featured the thorn-crowned,
gold-crossed Bryan for the presidency.
But the people double-crossed the com
moner and elected Bryan to stay at
home. Now, where, oh where, is tho
silver Republican party? Gone into
the Umbo of f'.e unreturnlng dead; and
echo only answers: "Where?''
This Is ancient hlstorj* of the nine
teenth century; now for the future In
the twentieth. After the successes of
1912 will the Socialist party become a
compromising affaair? Will It, like
the people's party, allow old party po
liticians to enter its ranks, confuse its
Issues and sidetrack its policies? Will
the money of capitalism j buy its So
cialist leaders as has undoubtedly been
done with some of the labor leaders?

COMPETITION'S HUMAN EFFECT
Editor Herald: The following is re
spectfully submitted to the considera
tion of Alex. S. Arnold:
As a matter of principle in political j
economy, it does not. do to take the i
figures of a single year In order to de
duce . from them general laws. It is I
; necessary always to take a lapse of j
I time, during which modern industry (
'■■ passes thorough the different phases of j
j prosperity and qf stagnation.
One of the first laws taught by econ- |
omists Is that competition reduces the j
price of every commodity to the mm- I
imum cost of production. Thus j the
minimum wage is the natural price of
labor. What Is the minimum wage? i
All that is necessary" to accomplish j
the production of the objects indispen
sable for the sustenance of the laborer I
and to propagate feebly his race. In
times of prosperity the working class j
will get more than tills and in times j
of stagnation less.
This Is equivalent to saying that the
working class will be preserved as a
class only after many miseries, and
their misfortunes are necessary to na
tional prosperity. ■.__ T. P.

ECONOMIC EQUALITY
OR CHAOS
(Unroln C. Cummlngs. In the Washington
Herald)
The drover Cleveland type of Demo
crats largely believe In "tariff for reve
nue only,'! while the majority of the
members of the Republican party,
spurred on by progressive Insurgency,
are today advocates of a moderate, ra- -
tional protective tariff for the protec
tion of infant Industries and the wage
scale, as against the pauper labor of
Europe. •
Will the Democratic party, as repre
sented' by the progress! of Wood
row Wilson, become sufficiently broad
ened to embrace the progressive ele
ment of the country, not party bound,
who are rapidly approaching, ln the
cycle of events, this standard of pro
gressive Democracy in their advocacy
of lower tariff?
Or will progressive Republicans suf
ficiently modify their fundamental law
of protection as to afford logical shel
ter for advanced and progressive De
-1 mocracy?
These are basic propositions in view
of divided Republicanism, upon which,
! regardless of advance into the merits
of the question of economic advisabil
! ity of either school—l. c., protection or
free tradethe president of the Unit
ed State may be elected in 1912, and
upon which the economic prosperity of
the next decade, perhaps, largely de
pends. f_
I Political economists, who may not be
classed as theorists, because they deal
ln statistical results, have, nine-tenths
of them, became believers in" freer
trade as against high protection as a
, means for tho common prosperity of
the nation. All men can well heed and
listen to such expert diagnosis of the
' ailments of the body politic.
Waiving, for the moment, the spe
cific effect pf protection per se upon
I Infant industries, wages of labor,
I higher cost of living, etc., let us ob
serve the material national prosperity
! and the purchasing power of the dollar
j for the masses and" the paramount
commercial progress of the freer trade
countries of Europe. .
Is there in very fact a condition of
labor more nearly approaching actual
slavery, and nearer actual hardship,
and under worse economic conditions
than we find upon the average In the
United States?
Here we far surpass all others ln
natural resources, agriculture and
manufacture, as well as population.
Yet here we find great riches for a
privileged class and great poverty for
the vast majority of the common
people.
The handwriting upon the wall,
which even he who runs may read, a
warning: Economic equality for all
citizens or chaos! ,-
High protection for special Inter
ests has received its death blow. Hon
est discriminatory protection for the.
common prosperity of all citizens—
all of whom equal opportunity shall be
K lven— ls the tocsin of the battle to be
waged for righteous government of
the people of this free land.
LESSON OF THE NORTH
(_o* Anjelei Mlninr Review.)
The defeat of Congressman W. F. En
glebright ln the First California district
j should furnish food for thought to
those who pretend to believe that mm
' ers, of all people, are unalterably op
j posed to conservation in any form. Tho
•district lost by the stand-pat congress
! man is composed in large measure of
I mining communities, with lumber inter-
I ests second in numerical strength; and
I yet a Republican majority of 7000 has
been turned Into a Democratic majority
of something over a hundred. Mr. En
glebright has been one of the staunch
est of Mr. Balllnger's supporters, and Is
also known as a friend of the interests
behind the Cunningham steal in Alas
ka. Those who know the district well
aver that the latter affiliations have
proved his undoing, and thus, by in
ference at least, we have proof that
j mnlers do favor conservation and that
! they are strongly against special priv
j ilege and Btand-patlsm In any form.
! One of the few arguments that could
! be adduced for Mr. Englebright's return
I to congress was his invaluable work
in connection with the bureau of mines.
That he did excellent service ln secur-
I Ing the passage of the bill is an ac-
I knowledged fact/ doubtless used to the
| utmost advantage in the campaign, but
yet a mining district has returned him
I to private life by a vote that leaves no
question of Its intention.
The fact of the matter is that the
I miner, with every other man who in-
I herently believes in the square deal,
'is in favor of a sane and legitimate
■ policy of conservation, in spite of tho
j fact that special privilege prevents his
unbiased expression of such opinion.
The action of the American mining
congress ln placing itself on record as
opposed to all forms of conservation.
including the leasing system, since
practically 'adopted by the administra
tion, is one of the most serious mistakes
it has ever made, and one that will
militate in a great measure against its
future strength and success. The Min
ing Review has always believed so,
and its opinion is shared by Mines and
