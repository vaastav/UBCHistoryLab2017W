foreign affairs, follows:
"Near the mosque of Hani, where
the medical post of the Twenty
seventh battalion of Rersaglieri had
been located, and in its vicinity
twenty-eight bodies of our soldiers

cut, impaled, torn to pieces and dis
membered. Among them there was
the body of a surgeon lieutenant.
"In the Arab cemetery, near the
place where the Fourth company
was located, seven bodies of Bersa
gilieri were discovered. They had
been interred alive, with the heads
out of earth. The body of one of
them shows that he had been terri
bly tortured.
"A captain's cap has been found
and its owner was identified by the
corporal, Pasqui, who escaped mirac
ulously after remaining four hours in
a ditch. He testified that among
the ferocious ill-treating hordes were
Turks and women. The military engi
neer corps took photographs."

Boise, Idaho.—The death here of
Joseph Morris, the victim of an as
sault committed twenty-four hours
previous, when he was all but disem
boweled by being cut across the ab
domen by his assailant, W. S. Clark,
resulted in a charge of first degree
murder being preferred against Clark

Clark is an unknown character to
the authorities, but is believed to be
a criminal with a record. The story
told by those who witnessed the as

calling the latter a vile name and
when Morris showed his resentment
Clark drew a knife, and, lunging at
Morris, inflicted a horrible wound
across his abdomen.

REBEL FORGES ARE IN NANKIN
Desperate Assault of the Chinese
Revolutionists Drives the Defense
From the City's Four Gates.
Nanking.—The revolutionist troops
entered the four gates of the city of
Nanking at an early hour Tuesday
morning. The fire from Tiger hill, oc
cupied by the rebels, was directed
Monday night against the north gate
of Lion hill and the imperial guns re
plied but feebly. Purple hll was made
the object of a rebel attack early in
the night and several of the gates
were assailed without effect.
The early atacks were evidently
feints. When the final assaults were
made the attacking forces carried
every gate and were soon in posses
sion of the city.
Han Yang has been occupied by the
Imperial forces, which crossed the
Han river twenty miles above that
place. Wu Chang has made a pro
visional capitulation and it is evident
that the government is geting
strong hand in that part of Hu-Peh

8AYS ROOSEVELT MADE BARGAIN
Retired Banker Make« Serious Accusa
tions Against Former President.
Washington.—Wharton Barker, a re
tired banker of Philadelphia, sprang a
sensation on the senate committee on
interstate commerce on Tuesday,
when he alleged that a New York
financier told him in 1904 that the
financial interests would support Theo
dore Roosevelt for president, because
the latter had "made a bargain" with
them "on the railroad question."
Mr. Barker's statement came in the
midst of a vigorous attack on the
"money trust," in which he alleged
also that President. Roosevelt had
been given the details of the impend
ing panic of 1907 several months be
fore it happened, but took no action to
prevent it. He declared the Aldrich
currency plan was the handiwork not
of former Senator Aldrich, but of Mr.
Warburg, of the banking firm of Kuhn
Loeb & Co., of New York, and that
a fund of $1,000,000 had been started
to insure its adoption.

Moose Hunti
in. Minneso
T is a rule among
medical men that,
having made a new
and important dis
covery, it is our duty
to appraise the world
of it and let all hu
man kind benefit
thereby; hence this
report. Having had
splendid luck hunting deer in
Northern Minnesota for two falls
we (when I say we it means Mrs.
B. and myself, as she has accom
panied me on all my hunting
expeditions and enjo.xs the outdoor
idea fully as well a« I do, besides
being a good shot), decided on a
trial for moose. Now, when one is
to hunt moose, the principal thing
is to go where the moose are. So
after a thorough investigation into
the whereabouts of these animals
we concluded that Cook county,
Minnesota, probably had more
tnoose to the square mile than any
other place in America, and I
think that our findings will be
borne out by the results of that
hunt.
Having decided where to go, it
was next in order to secure the
services of someone with a thor
ough knowledge of the country, for
a guide. Through the kindness of
my friend, Dr. F. B. Hicks of Grand
Man is, Cook county, Minnesota, I
was put in communication with Mr.
Gilbert Gilbertson of that place,
whoso personal services we were
fortunate enough to secure. Right
here let me say that Gilbert Gil
bertson is without doubt the most
thoroughly qualified guide in Cook
county, having a thorough knowledge
of the country as well as the habits
and haunts of game. Mr. Gilbertson
las four men, all good guides, and he
has a most unique method of charging
for his services. He or his men will
take charge of one, two or three men
for $10 per day, or he will guarantee
to get you a good, fair shot at a moose
for $25, provided, however, that you
agree to "hike" at least five miles per
day. We are now ready to start, and
leave home for Minneapolis, where
we are joined by Mr. C. Herbert Al
len, thence to Duluth and from Duluth
to Grand Marais by a Booth Line
steamer. Running into a "dead swell"
steamer. Running into a "dead swell"
Lake Superior, Mrs. B. and Herb
had all the Joys of real seasickness.
We were met at the wharf at Grand
Marais by our friend. Dr. Hicks, whose
splendid hospitality we thoroughly en
joyed. We were all up early next
morning to take a look at our sur
roundings, of which it is impossible to
make an adequate pen picture. Im
agine a little village, Just back of a
natural harbor of rocks, against a
mountainside of beautiful evergreens
and white birch, nearly a mile high,
ending in a tremendous promonotory
red-hued rock at one end and miles
and miles of the most gorgeous land
scape at the other. Cook county is
made up of thousands of Just such
scenes, with countless lakes and riv
ers interspersed, all of which abound
land-locked salmon and speckled
trout, making a veritable sportsman's
paradise as well as artists' dreamland.
Our guide'has now arrived with team
and wagon to take all our camp para
phernalia, provisions, etc., and we are
told that we are to drive out five
miles te Mr. H. Gilbertson's, where we
are to have dinner, and then on eight
miles, further to the 13-mlle post on
the Gunflint road, which place we
reached at 6 o'clock, tired, hungry
and in the dark. We soon unload the
big trunk containing our 14x24 tent
and in half an hour have our house
up and a good fire going.
The next day we spent in perfecting
our quarters, hauling up fire wood,
etc., etc., and aB the day therafter was
November 10, or the opening day of
the hunting season, we were all anxi
ous to be ready for an early start. To
get a moose by still hunting, it is im
perative that you get near the feeding
grounds by daylight. We were ac
cordingly on the trail as soon as it
was possible to travel, and our usual
good fortune was with us, for we were
scarcely at the edge of the old burn
ing, now nicely grown up with young
poplars, alder bushes and hazel brush,
when we found a fresh moose track In
the light snow that had fallen the
previous day. Judging by the size of
the hoof-print we at once decided that
we wanted that big bull, and it was
planned that Herb and Gilbert should
follow the track and Mrs. B. and 1
should cross the ravine and go up
along the hillside about a quarter of
a mile away. This was followed out
and we had barely gotten across the
ravine when we heard. Herb's .35
Remington automatic begin to crack
and we hastily ran to the top of a
small ridge, where we stood panting
for breath, when we heard a tremen
dous crackling of brush and timber
and in another moment we saw, about
150 yards away and coming directly
our way, a very large bull moose.
Waiting until he was in a fairly open
spot, I fired with my Winchester .30
cal. G. M. 1903, but shot entirely too
high, as I only pulled a bunch of hair
out of his neck. Quickly throwing in
another shell. I took a little better aim
and planted a ball right home, squarv
iy behind the shoulder blade, tearing
a hale through both lungs and cut
ting oil the large blood vessels, the
bullet lodging Just under the skin on
the opposite side. The moose stopped.

stood still tor a second and then rear
ing up fell over backwards, dead.
We were certainly elated. It was
not yet 9 o'clock and we had a very
large moose, probably weighing 1,200
pounds, but he was quite old and did
not have very {£>od horns. We soon
found the boys, who said that they
had sighted their moose about 400
yards away but had missed and they
hardly believed us when we told them
we . had a big ons down. We found
that there had been two mcose and
the one W'e killed was not the me
they had shot at. We all spent the
balance of the day in dressing this
moose, packing out the head and some
in
it
meat. And right here I want to cor- j
rect a very common notion that the :
meat from a bull moose is too tough
to eat. We ate moose meat every day
in camp and can safely testify to its
fine flavor and tender quality.
Early the next morning found Herb
anxious to get away to recover the
reputation ns a marksman lost the day
before. Mrs. B. and I hunted all the
morning without seeing anything and
returned to camp very tired and hun
gry about the middle of the after
noon. The boys got in after dark and
a satisfied look on Herb's face told us
that they had at least seen something
We were told that they had sighted
a spike bull and killed it and after
dressing that, Epent some time hunt
ting, but saw only a cow and two
calves, which they watched for some
time, even walking to within 200 feet
of them. We all rolled in early and
were up again betimes, and as Mrs. B.
and Herb had each developed a
"Charley-horse" from too careful walk
ing, they decided to stay in camp, and
Gilbert and I accompanied by Mr. H.
Gilbertson, who had come to spend a
day or two with us, started out. We
tramped hard and followed a track for
a couple of houçs in the forenoon, but
this proved to be a very large cow
and we had to let her go. After eat
ing our lunch, which, by the way, con
sisted each day of one large sandwich
and about two ounces of home-made
candy, we decided to try an old burn
ing a couple of miles further north,
and about 4 o'clock in the afternoon
found a fresh track that looked good
to us. Gilbert and I took the trail and
Mr. Gilbertson started for the farther
edge of the large ravine. We had not
walked for more than twenty minutes,
when rounding a little point up Into
the ravine, 1 saw, about 150 yards* dis
tant, standing in a clump of alder
bushes, a splendid big bull with a mag
nificent head. I raised my gun and
fired, and the big fellow staggered,
but did not fall, so I sent in another
ball, and he fell in a heap. He was
dead when we reached him. with two
ragged holes just back of the shoul
der, either of which was sufficient to
have killed him in a minute or two.
About this time Mr. Gilbertson's rifle
began to sing, and Gilbert and I ran
forward but saw nothing. My firing
had started another moose not far
away from us but too far for Mr. G.
to get accurate shooting, and he got
away.
We went back and took stock of our
moose and found that he weighed
about 1,100 pounds, and had a good
head with an actual spread of 57
inches. I don't think that I ever was
so thoroughly satisfied in my life as
at just that time. After dressing our
moose and taking off the head, which
Gilbert, strong as a small horse, car
ried without a pack-strap down to the
lake, we hit the trail for camp as fast
as possible as it was already nearly
dark. At camp of course I swaggered
around some and declared that I
would have to leave my gun in the
tent thereafter or I should have to
shoot all the moose for the whole per
ty, etc., etc.
We decided that we should make an
early start the next morning, despite
the fact that the day was Sunday. We
I
I
were up, and ready but were delayed
in starting because of a heavy fog. As
it was Herb's day, Mrs. B., Mr. Gil
bertson, Sr., and I dragged on behind
the boys, Mrs. B. and I having our
limit. About three miles from camp
and at about 8 o'clock they came upon
fresh tracks and waited for us to come
up. As we examined the tracks we
made up our minds that tws. big bulls
were not far away. Gilbert and Herb
continued on ahead and we followed
very carefully about a hundred yards
back. After a half mile of the most
careful going I evter saw, the boys
rounded a small bunch of jackpines
and just as they were out of sight we
heard Herb's gun crack and Mrs. B.
and Mr. G. started forward on a run.
I turned the other way, expecting one
of those moose to come out on my
side of the jackpines. In less than
half a minute there was the awfulest
cracking of guns that I ever heard,
and in another half minute the firing
ceased; then as nothMig came my way
I went around to see what was do
ing.
Imagine my surprise as I walked
around there to see in less than one
hundred and fifty yards of distance,
four big bull moose, dead. Herb had
secured a splendid head with 48-lnch
spread and certainly was elated. This
gave us each a moose, including one
for Mr. Gilbertson, Sr.
We of course set to work at once
dressing our game, and it was long
after dark when we again reached
camp; a very tired but happy lot. On
Monday we sent Mr. Gilbertson, Sr.,
home to arrange for Albert Gilbertsan
to com« out the next day with a big
team to help get out the game. Four
of us then spent two whole days cut
ting a path wide enough to get in on»
horse to drag out one moose at a time.
Late Wednesday evening we struck
Late Wednesday evening we struck
camp and moved down to Mr. Gilbert
son's. Mr. Gilbertson, Sr., Albert and
I went back the next day and brought
down the whole of the smallest mooso
we killed, which we shipped home. Fri
day we took Allen to town as he was
due in Minneapolis the next day. Mrs.
B. and I so thoroughly enjoyed the
hospitality of these woods people that
we decided to stay over Sunday and
have a try for a deer. There are not
many -deer in this region, but those
that are there move down toward the
lake when snow begins to come.
Gilbert and I hunted all day Satur
day but saw nothing. On Sunday
morning, however, Mr. G„ Sr., found
some perfectly fresh tracks of a deer,
not over a quarter of a mile from the
house. He came back and told Gil
bert and I and we at once accompa
nied him. getting a little way out on
the burning, while Mr. G. took the
trail. It was but a few minutes when
a beautiful yearling buck came out di
rectly at Gilbert. A Winchester .32
Special through the heart was all that
was necessary. We hunted again in
the afternoon and two deer came out
near Albert Gilbertson and a Mr.
Nelson, who were with us, but jthe
shooting was hard and no one was
able to connect.
Scandalous.
"It's positively disgusting."
"What is?"
