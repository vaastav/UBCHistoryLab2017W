By EDWARD W. PICKARD.
Tbe United States is in the war to
the finleh and that finish mast be the
overthrow of tbe Prussian military
despotism, the liberation and restora
tion of the peoples it has enslaved
aad reparation for the material dam
age Its armies have done. Waea this

sist oa a peaee that Is based oa gen
erosity and Justice to all alike, ex
cluding all selfish claims te advantage
even on the part of the victors. Mean
while AnsM43uix?ary most.
"our present and immediate task" Is
to win that war.
8uch In a few words Is the message
of President Wilson to congress, to
America, and especially to the world.
He leaves no doubt of the govern
ment's and the nation's humanitarian
aims, and he makes equally plain the
determinatloa never to make peace .
with the present rulers of Germany
who have doae surfc "deep and aSom
inable wrong." The president ex
pressly disavows any intention to Im
pair or rearrange the Atwtro-Huntra-rian
empire, hut says that te the
Austro-Hungarians should be restored
Independent control of their own af
fairs, and aver; that the Balkan states
ind Turkey should be secured against
foreign opprearton or injustice. Mr.
Wilson's polished diction does not con
ceal bis contempt for the padfiita, the
traitors and other who seek to ham
per the sett ea in the srosectiriaa of
the war. When everyone else wttWn
sonnd of Ms voice arose aod cheered
th president's impassieoed statements,
Senator La Follette, iepresentattve
Mason and oae or two more sulked si
lent in their seats. They are easiiy
classified.
Message Warmly Aspreverf.
Instant approval of the message was
general throughout the United States,
tad It received the' hearty endorse
ment of the British and South Ameri
can press, though some of the London
papers, notably the Tiroes, are skep
tical about the distinction the presi
dent still makes between the German
rulers and the German people. It must
be confessed a great many Americans
also feel the German people are not
se gniltless as Mr. Wilsos represents
them.
Congress lost riffle time In starting
proceeding for formal declaration of
war against Aastro-Hungary, and gov
ernment agents throughout the conn
try at once began preparing to handle
the million and a half enemy alien.
which It adds to the list As tens of
thousands of Austro-Hnnffarians have
been employed in the mines of Amer
ica, there Is danger of a serious short
age of miue labor. It Is likely a good
deal of discrimination will be used in
dealing with twh subjects of the dual
monarchy, as the Bohemians and vari
ous Slavic races, who have no sym
pathy with the autocracy of their
rulers.
Bolehevikl Peace Efforts.
The efforts of the Russian bolshe
vik! to bring about a general cessation
of fighting was not markedly success
ful last week. Large numbers of Rus
sian troops were withdrawn from the
front lines, and Austro-Hungary for
mally approved of the armistice plan ,
bat when the representatives of
the Russian began discussion of de
tails with the Germans they met with
quick check. Their first two stipu
lations were that the enemy should
net underlies to zt-i. forces from
the Russian front to tbe front of Sss
sls's allies, and that the Genua a de
tachments should be withdrawn from

the Russian government did not want

There were reports, which, however, ,
were emphatically denied, that jRou-
mania desired to open negotiations
for an armistice. If their Sank oa

quitting of the Russians, the Rounian

American army gets across in . sufli
, cient force to be effective. 3o f ar the
! result achieved by the enemy has been
the gain of a few rods of ground at
an appalling cost in loss of life.; The
: fighting in the Cpmbral sector devel
: oped into the bloodiest and fiercest
battle of the war, and despite the
' bringing up of great numbers of Ger
; many's best troops, the British In the
; Tmin repulsed the repeated mass at
tacks and held most of the ground
gained the previous week. If Byng
can continue to hang on to his posi
tions, the battle will prove the; best
thing the British could ask, for It has
brought the Germans "out of "their
holes" and not only shown them up
as inferior In open fighting, but cost
them an enormous number of "; their
mot valuable mea. The reckless sac
rifices made by Crown Princes Rup
precht contrast strangely with pie in
, formation that Germany Is training
hoys of fifteen and sixteen to take
I their places soon in the fighting lines.
America has cause for pride and
! ?ri!faction In the reports that come
j of the part in the Cambrai fighting
I taken by American engineers. Caught
; by a sudden advance of the Germans,
these men took shelter until the Brit
ish came up to them, and then, borrow
ing guns, went into the fray with a
gallantry and coolness that won high
praise from the commanding officers of
the British. A few of them were
killed end woundd. but the others
went right on w'th their fighting, pa
trolling and rai'rnsd bul'ding. -Fierce
Fightlnj In Italy.
Alone the Italian front the fighting
has been little less fierce than at Cam
brai. and as the week closed the Aus
trivGermans were making their sec
ond great offensive there. In the In
itial attack by largely Increased forces
the enemy compelled the Italians to
withdraw from some advanced posi
tions between Monte Tonderecar and
Monte Badenecche, but elsewhere the
violent assaults were repulsed. If
the invaders succeed 'In that sector In
fianklne the Piave and Brenta lines,
they might force General Diaz back as
far as the Adige. However, the Italian
commander seemed quite confident he
could prevent this, and his forces were
gallantly guarding the entire line
while Increasing numbers of British
and French re-enforcement continued
to arrive. Among the allies In action
on this front are a number of Ameri
can aviators, and the declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary seems to
make sure the speedy dispatching of
a consiaerable force of American sol
diers to re-enforce the Italians. At
any rate that is what Italy expects,
and ti e entire country celebrated Joy
ously the news that Its. chief foe was
to be included in the enemies of the
United States. ,

It nay be that a considerable part of

The allies Intend to bring out their
full man power, and the troops of the
United States are to be taken to the
front as quickly as it can be done.
There is no doubt that this Is the plan
of the government despite the opinion
of Von Hindenburg and Von Luden
dorff that America was raising a great
army only to protect ltaelf against Ja
pan and would not be so "foolish" as
to send It to Europe. If those gen

Equally satisfactory is the news

Germans had been cleared from that
vast region. All who were not killed
or captured had fled to Portuguese
territory, where they 'would soon be
attended to, he said. Thus Germany
has been stripped of the last of her

Interallied Naval Council.
An important decision of the coun
cil in Paris was to create an inter
allied naval council la order to close
contact and complete co-operation be
tween the navies of the allies. The
council will be composed of the min
isters of marine and admiralty chiefs
of the nations represented. The war
fare on the submarines is proceeding
satisfactorily, but the last British ad
