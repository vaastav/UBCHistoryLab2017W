AFrilOVE THE MESSAGE.
The people at large have voiced
their approval of President Wilson's
message to Congress. President
Wilson gave most attention to the
subject of "preparedness," making
many excellent suggestions and
some that are subject to doubt.
Every question that concerns the
domestic and foreign relations of
the United States has received due
consideration, and the message con
tains enough to keep the present
Congress busy
ends.

ENGLISH FEELING.
The feeling of England against
the United States was manifest In
the House of Commons on Monday,
when Lord Robert "Cecil, Parlia
mentary Undersecretary, replying to
queries regarding the Ford peaco
mission, parried the issue by saying:
"Speaking for myself, I think it
would bo in .the highest degree un
dignified for the Government of this
country to send any Intimation to a
lot of ladles and gentlemen who,
whatever their merits may be, are
of no particular Importance." It
was also urged that the Americans
l notified that their mission would

Tho President's secretary, J. P.
Tumulty, who according to our en
emies Is working harder for tho
Pope than for tho President, has
publicly denied that there Is evi
dence that the Carranzlstas were
guilty of tho cruelties and shameful
atrocities laid to their charge by
Mexican and American Bishops, Dr.
Francis Kelley and others. Now
Dr. Kelley, and Dr. TIerney, of New
York, hold affidavits In proof of
their contentions, but these legal
papers are not accepted as evidence
in the absence of similar affidavits

resentatives. This causes the Sun
dan Visitor to suggest that Tumulty
can not be priest-ridden (?) after
all. The best that can be said for
the secretary Is that he made a' bad

cosreion.

OATHOLIO LITERATURE.
Certain it is, in the words of
Father John Burke, "If wo are to
make ourselves truly Catholic in
our character, our aims, our princi
ples, then we must be readers of
Catholic litorature." Catholic books
and periodicals are staple food for
Catholic minds which without them
Inevitably show signs' of weakness
and disease. A largo portion of the
dally press, many of tho popular
magazines, plays presented every
where, lectures and books lauded on
all sides, even much work done
along sociological lines with sincer
est gopd will, all these are infected
with the poison which broadly may
bo called materialism under its vari
ous aspects, whether we call It
worldliness, humanitarianism, So
cialism, pragmatism, New Thought,
or porhaps the higher criticism.
Against this formidable army is
Catholic literature pitted. Our minds
can not serve God and mammon;
they can serve but one of the two,
and their choice depends largely on
whether they accept guidance from
the church or from the world, from
Catholic literature or from Ibsen,
Mneterllnok, Bergson and Tagore.
Mrs. William Wolfenberger was
last week called to Bowling Green,
wiiere her rather, Gus Bardmaker,
was critically ill, and died soon
after her arrival.
Miss Elizabeth Kremer, who is
attending Dana Hall, will return
next week to spend the holiday sea
son with her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
George W. Kremer.
Miss Susan McDermott, who is
attending school In New York, will
return to spend the holidays with
her parents, Lieut. Gov. and Mrs.
Edward J. McDermott.
Misses Elizabeth and .Frances
Malone, will return from school at
Cincinnati, and Miss Helen Malone
from New York, to bo with their
parents, Mr. and Mrs. John T. Ma
lono, for the Christmas holidays.
MASONIC TESTIMONY.
Cardinal William O'Connell, of
Boston, was flfty-six years old on
Wednesday. The distinguished
churchman was the recipient of
many congratulatory messages, num

mirers. j JJ
TAKE WHITE VEIL.
Hon. Frank T. Walsh, who is
Chairman of the Federal Committee
on Indusrial Relations and owner
of the Kansas City P08t with Mrs.
Walsh and their two daughters,
Misses Marie and Louise, passed
through Louisville on Tuesday en
route to Loretto, where the young
women entered the mother house of
the Sisters of Loretto, taking the
white veil with a large class of
postulants, of which they have been
members. They were accompanied
by Miss Marie Burnett and Miss
;nri .AaiiiHHaiso of Kansas City.

IftYBV
Reynold E. Blight, writing In the
Bulletin of Los Angeles Consistory
of Masons, pays this just tribute: "In
certain circles it is popular to de
nounce bitterly the Roman Catholic
church, and in the condemnation
forget her splendid achievements and
the consecrated service she has ren
dered to humanity. Tho long roll of
patriots, statesmen, philanthropists,
thinkers, heroes and saintly souls
who have drawn their spiritual in
spiration from her communion is
sufficient proof of the real greatness
of her -religious teaching. Among
the priests aro those whose names
have become synonymous with purity
of life and unselfish effort for the
betterment of humanity: Father
Damien, father Mathew, Father
Junipero Serra, St. Francis of
Assist, Savonarola. iHor countless
institutions of learning, her mani
fold charities, tho universality of her
spiritual appeal, must awaken the
admiration of all men. It must not
bo forgotten that at her altars the
common people received their first
training in democracy. Prince and
pauper, peasant and merchant, knelt
together, equal before God. During
the long night of the Dark Ages the
lamp of knowledge was kept, burning
in the monasteries. Tolerance
knows that there are two sides to
every question, and that a picture
that shows only shadows is essen
tially false." Truth commends this
to the -prayerful perusal of members
of anti-Catholic organizations.
