PART I. Marriage and Its Advantages.
Aee at Which to Marry. The Law of Choice.
In the Superior court late yester
day afternoon Sherman K. Hill, the
absconding Atlantic Hotel clerk was
quick to chang-e his "not guilty" plea,
to "guilty." Following a plea tor
leniency by his counsel, Paul Chap
man, Judge Burpee sentenced him to
nine months .in jail. Attorney Chap
man showed to the court that a full
restitution of the money had been
made to the hotel owners by an uncle
of Sherman, and that outside of the
inconvenience no one suffered by the
escapade. The specific charge
against Hill was that of stealing $1,
073 from the cash drawer of the
hotel, belonging to James Callaghan.
The charge of forgery was not press
ed. Attorney Chapman told the court
that Hill had played a trick on the
night clerk and had skipped away
early in the morning, going to Wash-
ington where he met a young Woman
from this city. He was apprehended
on the afternoon of the day of his
escapade. Hill confessed to his coun
sel that he had frequently altered the
figures in the books to cover up his
stealings. Attorney Chapman attri
buted Hill's downfall to the same old
trouble the swish of a skirt he was ,
infatuated with a married woman
named .Cora Dayton of Stratford. He ;
had met her in a local cafe, and put
up the bluff that he was a person of .
means. To carry out his pretense he
had to steal from his employer to
keep up appearances.
Landlord Callaghan of the hotel
testified that Hill came to him four
months ago and was considered a
model clerk. About a month before
his escapade there was a shortage in
the accounts, Mr. Callaghan engag
ing an expert accountant to look over
the books.
Looking toward Hill. Mr. Callag
han provoked a display of merriment
by remarking:
I tnink he ought to be sent to a
lunatic asylum. How could a man
like that, six feet, five inches tall,
get away without escaping attention.
He was bound to be caught as soon
as he exposed his shape. The trou
ble with him was petticoats, and
then it was all off."
Hill was agreeably surprised with
the light sentence he" received. .

Bird's-eye cheviot is one of the fa
vorite materials for autumn suits. It
comes in the fashionable tones of
grape, purple, gray, Diue, taupe ana
green.
A new departure in the manufacture
of the worumbo pele cloth is a plaid
back, making it reversible, an inno
vation that promises to be success
ful.
The general tendency in the suiting
materials is toward roughness, show
ing a greater, coarseness of weave and
of finish than we have seen in several
years.
Black satin evening wraps ana cioaics
for daytime wear are quite the latest
thing, covering the wearer from neck
to heels and even training slightly at
the back. ......
Mushroom umbrella handles may be
had in wood, ivory, horn, metal and
in the new beaded styles. wooden
mushroom handles are sometimes carv-
eu with animal heads.
Short neck ribbons of black moire
in. half-inch width are now worn for
carrying the lorgnon. which is consid
ered more convenient for use when it
hangs only to the bust.
Applique satin Is a new treatment
of satin that reproduces almost exact
ly the higli-priced brocade' satins.' "Its
design is known as applique, and it
comes in all the light shades.
No gown is complete without a scarf
of some, kind since during the last four
months they have been adapted to
street wear with tailor gowns as well
as more-elaborate toilettes.
Much embroidery in a new kind of
beads is being hand done on all classes
of fabrics used for the more elaborate
frocks, and these beads appear to be
enameled and given a metallc lustre
besides.
A Greek bandeau that is fascinating
for a youthful coiffure is made of
French gilt in diadem form with a
row or graauatea naroque pearis
around it. with two very large ones
placed at either end like balls.
One of the loveliest of jeweled but
tons is an olive shape, the elongated
centre in various tones to match the
gown, tne rims set witn Drunanis al
ternating, and among which are placed
rays of the colored stone."
The French are enthusiastic over the
practical ehiffon jumper, which, al
though it originated here, has been so
eagerly adopted by them that it is
now sent back to us in charming treat
ments to go with their latest designs
in suits.
A tfew bag is of dark green moroc
co, nine inches wide, has a mother-of-pearl
frame, held' on by green bands
The lining is gray calfskin with a
change purse, a powder-puff ' pocket
and a mirror. The handle is so made
as to fall ' flat against the bag when
folded down.
In the many combinations of velvet
with other materials, which is a mark
ed departure of the season, .nothing
further is left to be desired in the way
of . magnificence. There are. for in
stance, all-over velvet brocades mount-?
ed on changeable chiffon, which cling
to the figure in long, soft lines.
Karrings have, become so re-established
in favor that the fashion is no
longer eccentric. Circles of precious
stones hung pendant from a single con
trasting jewel such as emeralds with
pearls, or turquoises with diamonds
are commended by the present de
mands of fashion and the low set
hats.
A' simple hair ornament that can be
easily adjusted to almost any coiffure
is made from silver or gold ribbon, an
inch wide, and three rows of colored
beads strung side by side. Milliner's
wire cut to fit the head, with loops at
each end to hold a. hairpin, are then
twisted -with- the beads and ribbon so
that they overlap each other.
It is a pity that so many good-look-'nsf.
women elect to wear a fiat, broad
band of satin across the top of the
head. Such an arrangement is try
ing to the most beautiful modeled fea
tures, and has a harshening effect that
is anything but becoming. By putting
the band under the hair at the back
from side to side one will find the
result much prettier, leaving the nat
ural softness of the hair to frame the
living on the , Converse estate. Dr,
Pierson told of a brother-in-law of
the woman who she fancied was per
secuting her. It also appeared, from
his testimony that Miss Sweeney has
an idea that a wealthy New Canaan
man, a millionaire left her, recent
ly, a large amount of money in his
will. His son destroyed the will, she
believes, and prevented her receiving
the money.

large touring car driven by Charles
Martin, chauffeur for A. L. Fennisey,
collided with a runabout, Peter J.
Rainey, the driver, was thrown out
of the wagon, and suffered injuries
about the head and arms. It is said
that Martin was running his car at a

was on the wrong side of the road
and intends to bring suit for dam
ages. The wagon was damaged to
the extent of $50, Martin figured in

Divorces Granted.
Judge Gager handed down - a de
cision in the superior court at Dan
burj'i Friday granting to John Todd,
of Redding, a decree of divorce from
named Ashworth, who lived in the
house. After he had called for' him
a couple of times, it is alleged, Smith
opened the door, and without warn
ing, fired at him with a shotgun, in-
that resulted in blood poisoning. The
victim was forced to go to the hos
pital at Danbury, where h had to
remain from the 9th of June till the
26th of October. When finally dis
charged he had lost the use of his
right hand and arm, which had be
come withered, and as a result, he
lost his position as a carpenter. The
defense denies the most' of the com
plaint, but acknowledges the shoot
ing; which is claimed to be accident

with chicken thieves, and was within
