swamp lands, President Fowler said
in part:
"In addition to the land area avail
able for reclamation through irriga
tion, there are about eighty million
acres of swamp and overflow lands
not now Inhabitable but susceplble
to drainage:*
"Though these wet lands are most
ly along the Gulf and Atlantic slopes
with considerable areas in the Paci
fic states, they are distributed
throughout every state. Generally
of great fertility they would, if re
claimed, sustain a population of
ninety millions of people. While not
yet settled or cultivated, except in
a small way, most of the wet lands
have been ceded to states and have
passed into private ownership. By
far the greater portion of the area,
(for example, in the lower Mississip
pi region) is so located that drain
age projects would necessarily affect,
several states, so that the drainage
problem is essentially interstate, in
volving federal action with that of
the states.
"It is clear that one of the great
needs is the extension of reclama
over the wet lands, and it is im
portant that the action be taken by
state legislatures and congress in co
operation with private owners at an
early date.
"thus far no attempt has been
made to formulate a policy looking
to the reclamation of our wet lands
by drainage. But is is hoped that
the deliberations of this meeting
will at least point away to the adop
tion of a wise mode of procedure.
"The swamp land drainage cru
sade, embracing as it does, more
than eighty million acres of wet land,
in thirty-five states, is a proposition
so big, involving so many million of
dollars and *uch vast inerests, in
dividual, state and national, that it
must inspire the biggest brained men
who could be interested in its devel
opment."
CHICAGO, Dec. 5.—Experts in ir
rigation from many western states,
including Mexico, Canada* and South
America, and government officials in
terested in the reclamation of arid
and swamp lands, attended the open
ig today of the nineteenth annual
meeting of the National Irrigation
congress.
The work already done and the
problems still to be overcome in the
United States were presented before
congress in these figures:
Twelve million acres already irri-
Thirty-six milUon acres still to be
irrigated.
Eight million acies of swamp lands
to be reclaimed.
"Drain swamp lands, and water
arid lands and thus relieve the con
gested cities of their surplus popula
tion," was the burden of many of the
speeches by experts who are to fill
the program until adjournment Sat
urday. B. A. Fowler, president of the
congress, announced the receipt of a
message from President Taft.
Dr. F. H. Newell, director of the
United States reclamation service
R. P. Teele, in charge of irrigation
statistics, bureau of the census de
partment, and Senator William E.
Borah of Idaho were the chief speak
ers this afternoon.
