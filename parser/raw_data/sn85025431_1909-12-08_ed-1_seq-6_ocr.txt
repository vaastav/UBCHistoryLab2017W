Perhaps the most important ques
tion presented^ to this ^niyhiist|ratloh
is that of economy ih ^expenditures and
sufficiency of revenue.
The report Of the secretary shows
that the ordinary expenditures for the
Ourrenft fiscal year ending June SO,
1910, wi 11 exceed the estimated^ re
ceipts by $34,075,630. If to this deficit
are added the sum to be disbursed for
the Panama canal, amounting to $3$.*
000^000, and $1,000,000 to be paid dx£J
the public debt, the deficit of ordinary
receipts and\ expenditures Will be in
creased to a total .deficit of $73,075,620.
This deficit the secretary proposes to
meet by the proceeds of bonds issued
to' pay the cost of constructing' the
Panama canal. I approve this pro

The policy of paying for. the con

Alaska.
With respect to the territory of Alas-,
ka, I recommend legislation which
to enable it to give to the territory lo
cal laws adapted to its present growth."*
I strongly deprecate legislation looking
to the election of a territorial legisla
ture in that vast district.
Conservation, of Natural Resources.
In several oepartments there is pre-
looking 'to the further conservation of
our national tesources, and the sub
ject is pne^ of such Importance as to
require more detailed and extended
dlsciUK^on than can be entered upon
in thia communication. Fpr. that rea
«pn. I shall tak$van early opportunity
tp send a special message to congress.
White .dlave Trade.
There is urgent necessity for addi
tional legislation and: greater- executive
acdvlty to suppress the recruiting of
'the ranks. of prostitutes from the ...
streams of immigration into this coun
try—an evil which, for want of a bet
ter name, has been called "the white*
slave trade." I
.Bureau of Health.
There seems to be no reason why all
the bureaus and offices in the general
government which have to do with'
the public health or subjects awin
thereto should not be united in a bu
reau to be called the "bureau of pub
lic health."

I urgently recommend to congress

candidates in elections of members ot
the house of representatives and com-"
mittees in charge of their candidacy'
and campaign file in a proper office of
the United States government a state
ment of the contributions received and
of the expenditures incurred in the
'campaign for such elections and that'
fimilar legislation be enacted in re
spect to all other elections which are!
constitutionally within the control of
congress.
