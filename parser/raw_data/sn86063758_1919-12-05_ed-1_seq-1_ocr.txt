Hydro-electric plants will be re-;
quired to show that no coal, wood or

and that no coal, wood or gas

They are wholesale druggists, drug

Mr. Collier asked that the hydroelectric

-as possible without setting a definite
date, as it is not necessary that all
be here at once. After the conference
the coal committee will require
-a a daily report from each plant showing
that no coal is being used, as
only those plants using no coal are
allowed to. operate. j

The president remarks that, while
the riarht of the individual to strike
is inviolable, the government has a
predominant right to protect the
people against "the challenge of any
class." He also recommends arbitration
for ^industrial disputes and warns
against those who seek by direct action
to force their will upon the
majority.
"Russia today," he writes, "is a
painful object lesson of* the power

Democratic nominee for mayor of j
that city.* The proceedings in the!
court were begun at the spring term, I
when the Hyde faction asked the j
court to declare the executive com-1
ir.ittee illegally constituted. Upon
this committee the Grace faction had
a majority of one vote.- This the'
j court refused to do. Th3n the primary
came on the latter part of the
summer, and cn the face of the re
! turns Mayor Kyde was re-elected 1
aver Mi*. Grace.by a majority of one#!
vote. There vas something less than
a hundred challenged voles, however,!
and upci^ consideration of these, the 1
committee declared Mr. Gi*ace the ;
j nomT.ee by a small majority. Then i
; ihs Hyde faction came back to court,
and upon a consideration of the
petitions and the various matters
[presented before it, the court, by a
majority opinion of three to two, derlavsd
the nrimary null and void,
and ordered another nomination.
I Thereupon the city Democratic I
convention was called back into ses- J
[sion, and amended the rules of the
party so as to allow the executive
committee to declare a Democratic
nominee. The committee, following
| this action of the convention, met on (
November 25, and declared Mr. Grace
-the nominee.
The Hyde faction came back to the
court, and asked that this action of
the committee be declared illegal,
i under the former decision of the j
court.,. The court refused the Hyde)
petition, saying in its opinion, hand- j
ed down on November 28:
"The present litigation, first over(
the election of an executive commit- j
tee and then over the doings of that
committee after the primary elec-1
tion, was begun at the spring term
of this court and has lasted until this i
hofar.

not concerned in the contentions of j
the parties hreeto is to be preferred
to personal ambition and strife; it
calls for^the end of litigation and
the composure of the public mind. .In
our judgment, the petition ought to
be dismissed, and it is. so ordered."

Justice Gage, and concurred in by ,
Chief Justice Gary and Associate
Justice Watts, Associate Justices
Hydrick and Fraser dissented.

Last year, though the armistice had
been in effect a month and a half be- '
fore Christmas, the people had not
sufficiently recovered from the shock '
and gloom of war to enter full-heartedly
in the usual festivities. At that
time there were many who had not
yet learned definitely whether their (
sons and brothers and sweethearts
had passed through safely: This year j
it is different, and gay throngs are

The fight for an inheritance tax in v
this state, will probably be renewed n
at the coming session of the general | a
assembly, which meets on January 13. j b
Several years ago the late Mr. George ! n
R. Rembert, then a member of the j fc
house from Richland county, fought j d
for the passage cf an inheritance tax j a
measure.,but his efforts failed. 1t
Inheritance and income taxes, in j
addition to property taxes, have j e
been found to be efficient in equal- j i<
izir.g the burden of taxation, and!v
South Carolina is one of the very few j o
States in the Union which has not an ' 3
inheritance tax at this time. There J o
: re possibly only two other states j J
without such a tax. ' j v
Inheritance and income taxs, in o
addition to property taxes, should a
r.ot increase the general taxation, c
however, because under a proper sys- \
tem they would go to reduce the JS
property tax. Of course under a i
wise system the man with a meagre c
income would not be taxed, and an
inheritance tax law would be based c
on the same principle, and the larger [ ,
the income or the inheritance the a
greater the tax. That is the* basis 3
upon which the government nas c
worked out its plan of income tax. ^
The views of various members of
the general assembly are somewhat t
divergent upon the road question, but s
the great majority of them seem tc s
be in favor of some kind of good t
roads legislation which will be at least p
a starter in the direction of a state ^
system of permanent highways.
With national prohibition an ac- t
complished fact three days after the ?
legislature meets, and with^the fed- ^
eral government providing stringent
measures for the enforcement of the

leston to be had within eleven days j
from this date. The procedure suggested
by the petitioners within scr
short a period of time is manifestly
impossible to be accomplished. Nobody
will deny it. . . .
"There is moreover a third party
to this controversy, that party is the
public of the city of Charleston.
"Further litigation is not only
hrmip-lit to an end bv the bar of the
:aw, U1C 11VJUV/X vjubisvivit nui wv ....... nated
this time, for the first time in
a long, long number of years, except
insofar as the state may provide
for assisting in the enforcement of I
the law. It will be refreshing to 1<
have out of the way a question which \
has taken up so much of the.time of ii
previous sessions, to the detriment of C
constructive legislation. I
The suit of the State for the. re- o
covery of the Columbia canal is set g
for trial at the term of court here in "
December, but it is not known defi- c
nitely wh2ther it will be tried at this V
time. It will probably consume a
considerable length of time, as there ii
i3 a big amount of property involved,
and a number of Acts of'the' legisla- S
cure dealing with the matter. F

SANITARY CLEANING COMPANY
TO DO FAMILY WASH
? 9
The Sanitary Cleaning company
las been organized in Newberry and
vill meet a want that is felt very
icutely by all housekeepers in this
community.
The question of having the wash
lone properly^and at a price that the
1 -VI- A- ~CC J Unt.
iverage lamny is au:e auuiu nao
)een a very serious one and is .get;ing
more so every Jay. The washimomen
for which Newberry has
jeen long famous are getting scarce
:r.d these that are willing to do the
vork want to charge more than the
iverags family is able to pay, and
ret we suspect no more than the
vasherwomen can afford to work for
n these times of the high cost of
vooa and other things necessary to
iustain life.
The Sanitary Cleaning company
v-ili nnprjite a new svstem of wash
ng and if a sufficient number of
families give the company the work /
;he price will be less than it has been .
costing and the work will be done
n ail kinds of weather because by
;he process used it is not necessary
:cr sunshine in order to dry clothes.
The company will have a building
in Friend street which is being es- /
pecially erected for its use and
ground was broken on the new
Duild'ng on Thursday and it is expected
to have the building ready 1
iariy in the new year, if you have
lot already agreed to have your
>vash done by this company better
lo so at once because only a sufficient
will Ko t.n take care
J LCI Ll 1/ VTlll , MV vv
>f the families agreeing to give their
vork done at the beginning and it'
nay be sometime before new machnery
is put in. The plant exclusive
)f the building will cost around
515,000 and will be a great thing for
he housekeepers in Newberry.
Mr. M. G. Sheppard and Mr. Wyche
Dickert are in charge of the new
Hanr.
The building is being erected by
tfr. J. J. Langford and Mr. Fridy
n rear of the new garage that is beng
put on the lot in Main street and
rill front on Friend street.
Julius H. Barnes, United States
vheat director, says that within the
lext two weeks the government will
ilace on the market "straight flour
n small packages at a nominal cost.'*
["his flour, he asserts, is being sold in
rder to get the "individual consumer
ind our bankers to readopt their conup
nation 10 use the product which is
n ample supply this ye?r." Mr.
forces urges the cooperation of all
icusewives.
