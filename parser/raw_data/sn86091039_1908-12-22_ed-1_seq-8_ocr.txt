WHERE FALL PLOWING FAILS.
f
Not Every Soil Is Suited to Breaking
Ground Before Winter.
Much has been snld through the col
umns of tho Prnlrlo Farmer about the
conservation of molsturo and fertility
of the soil, writes n Hock( county
(Neb.) correspondent. Two things
you lmvo recommended and urged
moro than all others, namely, fall
plowing and tho preservation of tho
humus In tho soil by tho addition ot
stnblo manure. Tho methods used
nnd urged nro undoubtedly practical
In a largo part of tho west; but ln this
particular section, whore wo havo n
light, sandy ooll, a light rainfall, and
aro subject to prolonged windstorms,
the question Is moro complicated, or
rather has different complications.
Seven out of overy eight of tho
fields In this county would bo ruined
In three or four years It they wero
to bo plowed In tho fall and hurrgwed
smooth and left exposed to tho winter
and early spring winds. I know ot
many old fields that will not grow
enough weeds to cover them, nnd In
many Instances aro adjoining fields
that havo produced moro grain and
havo been In cultivation for mora
years, that aro still producing from
20 to 30 bushels of corn and lu somo
cases as. high as 40 bushels.
The difference. , la all due to the
fact that tlio ono has been repeatedly
left exposed to tho sun and wind,
whllo tho other has been protected by
tbo stubble, the stalks or weeds, often
through no forethought of tho owner.
I have seen pieces of good land
plowod, planted to corn, cnrofully cul
tivated, tho crop gathored and tho
stock turned ln to work tho stalks
down, nnd as a result tho wind has
been busily carrying off the ven
ereum of the soil on overy windy day
through tlio rail, winter and spring till
planting time, when tho operation
would bo repeated.
With good wild hay at two to
three dollars por ton, no ono enn af
ford to cut up his corn or pasture the
frozen stalks. They are worth too
much moro us a protection to tho pre
cious soil.
FOR BLEEDING FOWL8.
Suggestions for the Proper Killing of
Poultry.
In connection with the proper meth
od of bleeding fowls, C. K. Graham of
Btnrrs Btatlon offers the following sug
gestions: Hold the head ot the bird with the
left hand, back of the head up, keep
ing tho hand on tho back of the neck
to avoid cutting yourself should tho
knlfo slip and pass through the top of
the head. Take tho knife In the right
hand, back of the blade toward your
body. Insert tho blade In tho mouth,
keeping tho point to the right sldo of
the bird's, neck and as near the outer
ikln ns possible- until It Ib well past
the neck bono. Then press the edge
toward the bone and slowly draw tho
knlfo from the mouth, tho hand mov
Ing from your body, so thnf tlip kplfp
tppcafs to pass across the neck. Re
peat tho process on the left sldo ot
tho neck. This should cause the bird
to bleed freely, but by holding tho
beak up tho blood will remain In tho
neck, giving you plenty ot tlmo to
plerco the brain. Tho latter is located
Just above tho eye and can be easily
reached through the upper part of tho
mouth by using a stiff steel blade, In
serted In the mouth with blade odge
up and pointing slightly over the oye.
With young birds little trouble Is
experienced In piercing the brain, but
with older birds a very stiff blade Is
required, as the bonea are much hard
er. When the point of the blado enters
the brain give the knife a quick twist
to right or left to widen the aperture.
It tho brain has been reached tho bird
will attempt to squawk or will glvo a
nervous Jerk ns the blado touches tho
spot, and this touching tho brain or
norves not only loosens tho feathers
of tho bird for dry plucking, but will
greatly Improve the appearanco of
scalded stock.
Immediately after the brain has
been pierced a weight should be at
tached to tho lower mandible. Then
i.i iinuiini .on iiiiiiiji I in ii 1U llit,
back, the bird will not be able to flut
ter, and can be easily and rapidly
plucked. This, ot course, should al
ways be douo whllo the bird Is bleeding.
Feed Up the Foals.
Formers should not neglect wean
ling foals. They should bo fed gen
erously and go Into winter quarters In
good condition. The first year's man
agement of the foal usually determines
tho merit of tho animal as a market

PALATABLE FODDER CORN.
Prof Thomas Shaw Urges Proper Care
of This. Teed.
The method of handling th:: product
differs In various localities. Tho com
mon method of harvesting puts It Into
shocks of moderate bIzo as soon as
cut, and then Into stacks when tho
weather gets cool. Somo growers
ndopt tho following plan- They liar
vest ln tho ubuo! way Tho corn Is
put up In smalt shocks. It Is then put
Into larger shocks, Bay two weeks la
tor. This plan Is followed by J. J.
Furlong of AiiBtln, Minn., who won
first prize on his farm ln tho Hill con
test. The object Is to preserve tho
brightness In the corn nnd to prevent
It from weathering unduly. Mr Fur
long puts four shocks Into ono. Then
ns booh as the weather becomes cool,
ho puts the shocks Into stacks with a
diameter of about IB feet. In this way
tho fodder Is well protected from the
weather, so that when It Is fed It it
brighter, sweeter and morb nutritious
than If fed from the shocks.
This system has tho further advan
tage In areus with n heavy winter
snowfall. It gets tlio corn whero H la
nfo from Injury from snow or Bleet
boforo theso storms como. Tho objec
tion may bo raised that this means
extra work. It docs, but It means
extra vatiio In the fodder nlso. nnd
extra value that will usually far out
weigh the extra labor Incurred.
The method of stacking such corn Is
greatly influenced by the character of
tho climate Whero winter comes
early, tho corn cannot In all Instances
bo put Into stacks wider than ..ono
length of sheaves, Tho tops and butts
nro reversed alternately to keep tho
long stack lovel. ln other irtanccs,
whero the corn Is drier, two lengths of
sheaves are .admissible, overlapping at
the tops, and In yet others wide, ob
long or round stneks may bo built
without endangering tho safety of tho
corn. Good corn fodder, especially if
not coarse. Is one of the best and most
economical of fodders. Poor corn fod
der Is of .but little account.

8AN JOSE 8CALE.
Spraying with Llme-8ulphur the Mos
Effective Treatment.
Prof. L. H. Taft of Michigan says
that while othor remedies hovo been
used for San Jose scale, nothing has
been found which equals tho sulphur
Ilmo mixture In safety, cheapness and
effectiveness, nnd besides It Is worth
-a.UJt-castg.aB a, -frmglolrto.",
Although equnl parts of lime and
sulphur can bo used, it Is better to
use 20 to 25 pounds of llmo and IS
pounds of sulphur for B0 gallons.
Theso should be boiled for 45 minutes,
raro being taken to havo the water
hot beforo tho llmo and sulphur nro
added, and to uso only stono lime.
The cooking can be done In Irpn ket
tles, or by means of steam In barrels
or tanks. It answers very well If the
llmo and sulphur nro cooked In 20 to
25 gallons of water and then dllutod,
using cold water If moro convenient
Although It Is necessary to have tho
mixture slightly warm whpn applied,
It need not be very hot.
Tho best tlmo for making the ap
plication Is Just beforo the buds open
In the spring, and little or no barm
will bo done by spraying even offer
tbo budB show n pink color. In fact.
It applied at that time there will bo
no occasion for using Dordoaux mix
ture until after the fruit has set.
