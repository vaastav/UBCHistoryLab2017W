The President's IlleSSIlgO tO CoIlgl'OSS
Tuesday follows :
To the Senate and House of Kepre
sciitutivcs :
I sincerely regret that I cannot be
present at I In' opening of tills session
ol' the Congress, I am thus prevented
from presenting In as direct n way aw
I could vlsli the many questions that
nre pressing for solution at this time.
Happily, I have had the advantage of
Hie advice of the heads of the several
executive departments who have kept
in close touch with affairs In their de
and whose thoughtful reconimend
n'llons I earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads anil
lite readjustment of their affairs Brow
ing out of federal control, I shall take
the liberty at u later day of address
ing you.
Urges National Budget.
I . hope that Congress will bring to a
conclusion at. this session legislation
looking to the establishment of a bud
get system. That there should be one
singel authority responsible for the
making of all appropriations and that
impropriations should be made not In
dependently of each other, but with
reference to one single comprehensive
plan of expenditure properly related
P the nation's Income, there can be no
doubt. I believe the burilen of prepar
ing tin budget must, in the nature of
the ca.e. If the work Is to be properly
done and responsibility concentrated
instead of divided, rest upon the execu
ulive. The budget so prepared should be
submitted to and approved or amend
ed by a single committee of each house
of Congress ami no single impropria
tion ehould be made by the Congress,
except such as may have been includ
ed in the budgst prepared by the ex
ecutive of added by the particular com
mittee of Congress charged with the
budget legislation.
Permanent Tenure of Office.
Another and not less Important
wpect of the problem Is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated
in expended. Under existing law
the only audit is for the purpose of
ascertaining whether expenditures
have iM'eu lawfully made within the
appropriations. No one Is authorized
or equipped to ascertain whether the
money has been spent wisely, econom
ically und effectively.
The auditors should be highly
trained officials with ermiinent ten
ure in the Treasury Department, free
of obligations to or motives of consid
eration for this or any subsequent ad
ministration -and authorized and em
powered to examine Into and make re
port upon the methods employed and
Hie results obtained' by the executive
departments of the government. Their
reports should be made to the Con
gress and to the secretary of the
treasury.
I trust Hint the Congress will give
lis Immediate consideration to the
problem of future taxation. Simpli
fication of the income and profits
taxes h is become an immediate neces
sity. These' taxes performed Indispen
sable service during the war. They
must, liott-ever, be simplified, not only
lo save the taxpayer inconvenience
mid expense, but in order that his lia
bility may he made certain and defi
nite. Questions of Tax in Peace Time.
With reference to the details of the
levenue law, the secretary of the
treasury and the commissioner of In
ternal revenue will lay before you for
your consideration certain amend
ments necessary or desirable in con
nection with , the administration of the
l:UV recommendations which have my
approval and support.
tt is of the utmost importance that
in dealing with this matter the pres
ent law should not be disturbed so
far as regards taxes for the calendar
vear lif-'O, payable In the calendar
year 1921.
The Congress might well consider
whether the higher rates of Income
nod profits taxes can In peace times
be effectively productive of revenue
and whether they may not, on the con
trary, be destructive of business ac
' ilvlty ami productive of waste and In
efficiency. There is a point at which in peace
times high rates of Income and prof
it taxes discourage energy, remove
Hie incentive 'to new enterprise, en
courage extravagant expenditures and
produce industrlat stagnation with
consequent unemployment and other
attendant evils.
America Position.
The problem Is not an easy one. A
ttuidamental change has taken place
with reference to the position of Amer
ica in the world's affairs. The preju
iiend oassious engendered by dec
ades of controversy ' between two
-choois of political and economic
thought the one believes In protec
tion of American Industries, the other
believes in tariff for reven uo only
must bo subordinated to tUu single
consideration of the public Interest In
the light of utterly changed condi
tions. Beforo the war America was heavily
the debtor of the "rest of the world,
and the Interest payments she had to
make to foreign countries on Ameri
can securities held abroad, the expen
ditures of the American travelers
abroad and the ocean freight charges
she had to pay to others, about bal
anced the value of her pre-war favor
able halunce of trade. During the
war America's exports have been
greatly stimulated, and Increased
prices have Increased their value.
On the other hand, she has pur
chased a large proportion of the Amer
ican securities previously held uhroud,
has loaned some ?0,MO,OUO10OO to for
eign governments, and has built her
own ships. Our favorable balance of
trade has thus been greatly Increased
and Europe has been deprived of the
means of meeting It heretofore exist
big. To Develop Market.
Europe can have only three ways of
meeting the favorable balance of trade
In peace times: l'.y imports into this
country of gold or of goods, or by
establishing new credits. Kurope is
in no position at the present time to
ship gold to us nor could we contem
plate large further Imports of gold into
tills country without concern.
The tunc has nearly passed for In
ternational government loans and tt
will take lime lo develop in tills coun
try a market for foreign securities.
Anything, therefore, which would tend
to prevent foreign countries from set
tling for our exports by shipments of
goods into til's country could only
have the effect of preventing llietn
from paying for our exports and
therefore of preventing the exports
from being made.
The productivity of the country,
greatly stimulated by the war, must
find an outlet by exorts to foreign
countries and any measures taken to
prevent imports will Inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load Hie banking machinery of
the country with credits to carry un
sold products and produce industrial
stagnation and unemployment. If we
want to sell, we must be prepared to
buy.
America Greatest Capitalist in World.
Whatever, therefore, may have been
our views during the period of growth
of American business concerning tar
iff legislation, we must now adjust
our own economic life to a changed
condition growing out of the fact that
American business is full grown and
that America is the greatest capitalist
in the world.
No policy of isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportunities
of America. The provincial standards
and policies of the past, which have
held American business as if in a
straightjacket, must yield and give
way to the needs and exigencies of
the new day in which we live, a day
full of hope and promise for Ameri
can business, if we will but take ad
vantage of the opportunities that are
ours for the asking.
The recent war has ended our iso
lation and thrown upoii us a great
duty and responsibility. The United
States must share the expanding world
market. The United States desires
for itself only equal opportunity with
the other nations of the world, and
the process of frlendlq co operation
and foreign competition so the legit
imate Interests of all nations concerned
may be successfully and equitably ad
justed. Must Give Relief to Returned vanKS.
There are other matters of import
ance upon which I urged action at the
Inst session of Congress which are stlli
pressing for solution. I am sure it Is
not necessary for me again to remind
yon that then! is one immediate and
very practicable question resulting
from the war which we should meet
In the most liberal spirit. It is a mut
ter of recognition and relief to our sol
diers. I can do no better than to quote
from my lust message urging this very
action :
"We must see to it that our return
ing soldiers are assisted in every prac
ticable way to find the places for
which they are fitted In the dally work
of the country. This can be done by
developing and maintaining upon an
adequate scale the admirable organiza
tion created by the Department of La
bor for placing men seeking work ; and
It can also be done. In at least one
very great field, by creating new
opportunities for Individual enterprise.
Urges Support for Secretary's Plans.
"The secretary of the interior has
pointed out the way In which return
ing soldiers may be helped to fund
and take up land In the hitherto un
developed regions of the country which
the federal government nlrendy has
prepared or can readily prepare for
cultivation and also on many of the
cutover'or neglected areas which lie
within the limits of the older states;
and I once more take the liberty of
recommending very urgently that; his
plans shall receive tte Immediate and
substantial support of Congress."
In the matter of tariff legislation, 1
beg to call your attention to the state
ments contained in my last message
urging legislation with reference to
the establishment of the chemical and
dyestuffs Industry In America:
Dependence Interrupted Trade.
"Among the industries to which spe
cial consideration should be given is
that of the manufacture of dyestuffs
and related chemicals. Our entire de
pendence upon German supplies before
the war made the interruption or tr√°ete
a cause for exceptional economic dis
turbance. The close relation between
Che manufacture of dyestuff, on the
one hand, and of explosives and poi
sonous gases, on thejnther, moreover,
has given the industry an exceptional
significance and value.
"Although the United States" will
gladly and unhesitatingly join Jn the
program of International disarmament,
it will, nevertheless, be a policy of ob
vious prudence to make certain of the
maintenance of many strong and well
equipped chemical plants. The OermuD
chemical Industry, with which we will
he brought Into competition, was, and
may well be again, a thoroughly knit
monopoly capable of exercising a com
petition of a peculiarly insidious aud
dangerous kind." ,
During the war ' the fanner per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. By materially Increasing
the production of his land he supplied
America and the allies with the In
creased amounts of food necwv to
keep their Immense armies In the field.
He indispensably helped to win the
war. Hut there Is now scarcely less
needs of Increasing the production in
food and the necessaries of Ufe. I ask
the Congress to consider means of en
couraging effort along these lines. t
Gives Boost for Better Roads.
Ti' Mee! of doing everything possi
ble to promote production along eco
nomical lines, to Improve marketing
and to make rural life more attractive
and heulthful, is obvious. I would urge
approval of the plans already proposed
to the Congress by the secretary of ag
riculture, to secure the essential facts
required for tiie study of tills ques
tion, through the proposed enlarged
programs for farm management stud
ies and crop and estimates.
I would urge, also, the continuance
of federal participation in the bulldin;
of good roads, under the terms of jcx
Isting law and under the direction of
present agencies; the need of further
action on the part of slates and tin
federal government to preserve and
develop our forest reservolrc and sup
ply through the practice of better
forestry methods on private holdings
and the extension of the publicly
owned forests; bci√≠√≠i-r support for
country schools nn the more definite
direction of their courses of study
along the lines related to rural prob
lems; and fuller provision for sanil.i
tion In rural districts and the build
ing up of needed hospital and medic:'.!
facilities in these localities.
Political Restlessness.
Perhaps the way might be cleared
for many of these desirable reforms by
n fresh, comprehensive survey made of
rural conditions by a conference com
posed of representatives of the fann
ers and of the agricultural agencies re
sponsible" for leadership.
I would call your utioiit'on to tuo
widespread condition of political rest
lessness In our body'' politic. The
causes of this unrest, while vurio'j.i
and complicated, are superficial rulhel
than deep seated. Broadly, they arise
from or are connected, with the fail
ure on the part of our government to
arrive speedily at a just and perma
nent peace permitting return to norma!
conditions, from the transfusi√≥n of rad
ical theories from, seething Kuropeun
centers pending such delay, from heart
less profiteering resulting in the ia
crease In the cost of living, and, lastly,
from the machinations of passionate
and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal condi
tions, this unrest will rapidly disap
pear. In the meantime It does nvte't
evil. It seems to me that In dealing
with this sltua.-'on Cngre-ts should nut
be Impatient or drastic, but should
seek rath√°r to r-movt the causes.
Courts Should Deal With Radicals.
It should endeavor to bring our
country back speedily to a peace biisi
with ameliorated living conditions ai
der the minimum of restrictions upon
personal liberty that is consistent
with our reconstruction problems. Ami
It should nrm the federal gf.enii mil
with pow-ir to deal in Its ctri.hml
courts with those persons vh by vio
lent methods would abrogate the time
tested Institutions.
With the free expression of opinion
and with the advocacy of orderly po
litical change, however fundamental,
there must be no Interference, but to
wards passion and malevolence tend
ing to incite crime and Insurrection
under guise of political evolution there
should be no leniency. Legislation to
this end lias been recommended by the
attorney general and should be
enacted.
In this t'lrect connection ( v:ild
call your attention to my recommenda
tion on Aug. 8, pointing out leg'slathe
measures which would he effective hi
controlling and bringing down the
present cost of living, which contrib
utes so largely to this unrest If ihe
government's campaign Is to effec
tive. It Is necessary that the other
steps suggested should be act-id upon
at once.
Urges Extending Food Control Act.
I renew and strongly urge the nec
essity for the extension of the pres
ent food control act as to the period 'J
time In which It shall remain In opera
tion. The attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing for an exten
siou of this act for a period of six
months. As it now stands it is limited
in operation to the period of the war
and becomes Inoperative upon the for
mal proclamation of pence. It is Im
perative that it should be extended at
once. The Department of Justice has
built up extensive machinery for the
purpose of enforcing its provisions ; ail
of which must be abandoned upon th
conclusion of peace unless the provi
sions of this act are extend J.
During this period the Congress will
have an opportunity to make similar
permanent provisions and regulations
with regard to all goods destined for
Interstate commerce and to exclud-;
them from Interstate shipment, If the
requirements of the law are not com
piled with.
Some such regulation is Imperative
ly necessary. The abuses that have
grown up In the manipulation of prices
hy the withholding of foodstuffs and
other necessaries of life cannot other
wise be effectively prevented. There
can be uo doubt of either the necessity
or the legitimacy of such measures.
Ovlc Associations Cn Play Big Part.
As I pointed out In my lust message,
publicity can accomplish a great deal
In this campaign. The alms of the
government must be clearly brought to
the attention of the consuming public,
civic organizations and state officials,
who are in a position to lend their as
sistance to our efforts.
You have made available funds with
which to carry on this campaign, but
there Is no provision in the law au
thorizing their expenditure for the pur
pose of making the public fully In
formed about the efforts of the gov
ernment. Specific recommendation has
been made by the attorney general In
this regard. I would strongly urge up
on you Its Immediate adoption, as it
constitutes one of the preliminary
steps to this campaign.
I also renew my recommendation
that the Congress pass a law regulat
ing cold storage as It is regulated, for
example, by the laws of the state of
New Jersey, which limit the time dur
ing which goods may be kept In stor
age, proscribe the method of disposing
of them If kept beyond the permitted
period and require that goods released
from storage shall in all case bear the
date of their receipt.
Purchaser Would Know o Profits.
It would materially add to the serv
iceability of the law for the purpose
we now have in view, if it were also
prescribed that all goods released from
storage for Interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each pack
age the soiling or market price at
which they went Into storage. By this
means the purchaser would always be
aide to learn what profits stood be
tween him and the producer or the
wholesale dealers.
I uld also renew iny recommenda
tion that all goods destined for Inter
state commerce should in every case,
where their form or package makes it
possible, be plainly marked with the
price at which they left the hands o√≠
the producer.
We should formulate a law requiring
a federal license of all corporations en
gaged in interstate commerce aud em
bodying in the license, or in the condi
tions under which it is to be Issued,
specific regulations designed to secure
competitive selling and prevent uncon
scionable profits in the method of mar
keting. , .
Such a law would afford a welcome
opportunity to effect other much need
ed reforms in the business of inter
state shipment and In the methods of
corporations which are engaged in it;
but for the moment I confine my rec
ommendations to the object Immediate
ly In hand, which is to lower the cost
of living.
Capital and Labor Must Be Partners.
No one who has observed the march
of events in the last year can fail to
note the absolute need of a definite
program to bring about an Improve
ment In the condition of labor. There
can be no settled conditions leading
to increased production, and n reduc
tion in the cost of living If labor and
capital are to be antagonistic instead
of partners. Sound thinking and an
honest desire to serve the interests of
the whole nation, as distinguished from
the interest of a class, must be applied
to thes olutlou of this great and press
ing problem. ,
The failure of other nations to con
sider this matter in a vigorous way
has produced bitterness und jealousies
and antagonisms, the food of radical
ism. The only way to keep men from agi
tating against grievances is to remove
the grievances. An unwillingness even
to discuss these matters produces only
dissatisfaction and gives comfort to
the extreme elements in our country
which endeavor to stir up disturb
ances In order to provoke governments
to the solution of this great and press
and repression. The seed of revolution
Is repression.
Give Workers Rights.
V The remedy for those tilings must
not be negative in character. It must
be constructive. It must comprehend
the general Interest. The real anti
dote for the unrest which manifests
itself Is it suppression but a deep
consideration of the wrongs that beset
our national life and the application
of a remedy.
Congress has already shown Its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrongs by establishing the elght
iiour day as the standard In every
field of labor. It has sought to find
a way to prevent child labor. It has
served the whole country by lending
the 'way In developing the means of
preserving and safeguarding lives and
health In dangerous Industries.
It must now help in the' difficult
tnsk of finding a method that will
bring about a genuine democratiza
tion of Industry, based upon the full
recognition of the right of those who
work. In whatever rank, to participate
in some organic way In every decision
which directly affects their welfare.
' It is with this purpose In mind that
I called a conference to meet In Wash
ington on Dec. 1, to consider these
problems In all their broad aspects,
with the Idea of bringing about a bet
ter understanding between these two
Interests.
Indorses World League.
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a de
mand for an immediate consideration
of the difficulties between capital and
labor, bids us put our own house In
order. Frankly, there can he no per
manent and lasting settlements be
tween capital and labor which do not
recognize the fundamental concepts
for which labor has been struggling
through the years. The whole world
gave its recognition and Indorsement
to those fundamental purposes la the
League of Nations.
The statesmen gathered at Ver
sailles recognized the fact that world
stability" could not be had by reverting
to Industrial standards and conditions
against which the average workman
of the world had revolted. It is, there
fore, the task of the statesmen of this
new day of change and readjustment
to recognize world conditions and to
seek to bring about through legisla
tion conditions that will mean the end
ing of age-long antagonisms between
capital and labor and that will hope
fully lead to the building up of a com
radeship which will result not only In
greater contentment among the mass
of workmen but so bring about a
greater production and a greater pros
perity to business Itself.
Workman's Right to Live Decently.
To analyze the particulars in tiie
demands of labor is to admit the jus
tice of their complaint in many mat
ters that lie at their basis. The work
man deiiiands an adequate wage, suf
ficient to permit him to live in com
fort, unhampered by the fear of pov
erty and want in his old age.
lie demands the right to live and
the right to work amidst sanitary sur
roundings, both in home and In work
shop, surroundings that develop and
do not retard his own health and well
being; and the right to provide for
his children's wants in the matter of
health and education. In other words,
it is his desire to make the conditions
of ills life and the lives of those 'dear
to him tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down In the cov
enant of the league of Nations offers
us the way to industrial peace and
conciliation. No other road lies open
to us. Not to pursue this one is longer
to invite enmities, bitterness and an
tagonisms which lu the end only lead
to industrial and social disaster.
Unwilling Workman Unprofitable.
The unwilling workman is not a
profitable servant. An employ√© whose
industrial life is hedged about by hard
and unjust conditions; which lie did
not create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort which
are the necessary ingredients of a
great producing entity. Let us be
frank about this solemn mutter.
The evidences of world-wide unrest
which manifest themselves In violence
throughout the world bid us pause
and consider the means to be found
to stop the spread of this contagious
thing before It sups the very vitality
of the nation itself. Do we gain
strength by withholding ,tlie remedy?
Is it not the business of statesmen to
treat these manifestations of unrest
which meet us on every hand as evi
dences of an increasing disorder aud
to apply constructive methods where
ever necessary, being sure that in the
application of ftie remedy we touch
not tiie vital Issues of our industrial
and economic life? There can be no
recession of the tide of unrest until
constructive instrumentalities are set
up to stem that tide.
Labor Not a Commodity.
Governinents must recognize the
right of men collectively to bargalu
for humane objects that have at their
base the mutual protection and wel
fare of those engaged in all indus
tries. Ijilxir must not be longer treat
ed as a commodity. It must be re
garded as the activity of human
beings, possessed of deep yearnings
and desires. ,
The business man gives his best
thought to the repair and replenish
ment of his machinery, so that its use
fulness will not be Impaired and Its
power to produce may always be at
its height and kept In full vigor and
motion. No less regard ought to be
paid to the human machine, which
after all propels the machinery of the
world and Is the great dynamic force
that lies hack of all Industry and
progress. Return to the old standards
of wage and Industry in employment
is unthinkable:
The terrible tragedy of war which
has Just ended and which has brought
the world to the verge of chaos and
disaster would be in vain if there
should ensue a return to the condi
tions of the past. Kurope .itself,
whence has come the unrest which
now holds the world at bay, Is an ex
ample of stand-patlsm In these vital
human matters which America might
well accept as an example, not to be
followed, but studiously to be avoided.
U. S. Should Take Lead.
Europe made labor tiie differential,
and the price of it all Is enmity and
antagonism nnd prostrated Industry.
The right of labor to live in peace and
comfort must be recognized by gov
ernments and America should be the
first to lny the foundation stones upon
which Industrial peace shall be built.
Labor not only is entitled to an ade
quate wage, but capital should receive
a reasonable return upon its Invest
ment and Is entitled to protection at
the hands of the government in. every
emergency. No government worthy of
the name can "play" these elements
against each other, for there Is a mu
tuality of Interest between them whicli
the government must seek to express
and to safeguard at all cost.
The right of Individuals to strike Is
inviolate -and ought not to be Inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there Is a pre-eminent rignt
and that Is the right of the govern
ment to protect all of its people and
to ussei'l lis power uuu uiujcsiy
against the challenge of any class. The
government, when It asserts that right,
seeks not to antagonize a class but
simply to defend the right of the
whole people as against the Irrepara
ble barm and Injury that might be
done by the attempt by any class to
usurp a power that only goveniiueut
itself has a right to exercise as a pro
tection to ail.
U. S. Must Solve Question Peaceably.
In the matter of international dis
putes which have led to war, states
men have sought to set up as a rem
edy arbitration for war. Docs this
not point the way for the settlement
of Industrial disputes by the establish
ment of a tribunal, fair and Just alike
to all, which will settle industrial dis
putes which in the pust have led to
war and disaster?
America, witnessing the evil conse
quences which have followed out o√≠
such disputes between the contending
forces, must not admit. Itself Impotent
to deal with these matters by means
of peaceful processes. Surely, there
must be some method of bringing to
gether In a council of peace and amity
these two great interests, out of which
will come a happier day of peace and
cooperation, a day that will make for
more comfort and happiness in living
and a more tolerable condition amdug
all classes of men.
Certainly human Intelligence can de
vise some acceptable tribunal for ad
Justing the differences between cap
ital und labor.
Hour of Test for America Is Here.
' This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength, and the Indomitable courage
of her soldiers, she demonstrated her
power to vindicate on foreign battle
fields her conception of liberty and
justice. Let not her Influence as a'
mediator between capital and labor be
weakened and her own failure to set
tle tmitters of purely domestic con
cern be proclaimed to the world.
There are those In this country who
threaten direct action to force their
will , upon a majority. Hussla today,
with Its blood and terror, is a painful
object lesson of the power of minor
ities. It makes little difference what
minority it is, whether capital or la
bor, or any other class, no sort of
privilege will be 'permitted to domi
nate tills country. We are a partner
ship or nothing that Is worth while.
We are a democracy, where the ma
jority are the masters, or all the hopes
and purposes of the men who founded
this government have been defeated
and forgotten.
U. S. Will Not Stand Any Threats.
In America there Is but one way in
which great reforms can be accom
plished and the relief sought by classes
obtained, und that Is through the or
derly processes of representative gov
ernment. Those who would propose
any other method of reform are ene
mies of tliis country. America will not
be daunted by threats nor lose her
composure or calmness in these dis
tressing times.
We can afford in the midst of this
day of passion and unrest, to be self
contained and sure. The Instrument of
all reform in America is the straight
road of justice to all classes and condi
tions of men. Men have but to follow
this "road to realize the full fruition of
their objects and purposes. Let those
beware who would take the shorter
road of disorder and revolution. The
right road is the road of justice aud
orderly process.

Kansas Shipping Coal.
Pittsburg, Kan. Kansas has got a
toe hold in the coal mining business.
Toward stonn-swept southwest Kan
sas, where the mercury Is hovering a
few degrees below zero, is speeding
the first car of coal mined by volun
teer workers in the strip pits of the
Pittsburg field. It was billed out of
Pittsburg to the mayor of Coldwater,
Kan., and was expected to be followed
by other cars destined for sections
where the coal famine is most acute.
Renewing Negotiations.
Washington. Negotiations for a
compromise ratification of the peace
treaty were renewed with the reassem
bling of Congress, but the general feel
ing of senators on both sides was that
It might be some weeks before the
