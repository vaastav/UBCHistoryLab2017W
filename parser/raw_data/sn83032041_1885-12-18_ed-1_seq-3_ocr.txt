'The great national mathematical

United States Senator Bi.aik, of
Xew Hampshire, has undertaken, as j
usual, to play the role of reformer. He
wants the Constitution amended that
women can vote and men can be pre
Tenttd from drinking whisky. It is a

There are two colored Congressmen
in the present House. One of them is
Robert Small, of South Carolina, a bur.
ly, uneducated negro, who stole a gun
boat from the Confederates in Charles
ton harbor in 1801, ar.d ran it into the
Union lines at Beaufort, in the same
State. The other is James E. OTIara,
of North Carolina, who is a good talker
and stands high in the Catholic Church
at his own home. Both are Republi
cans and in favor of the most liberal
system of appropriations.
The will of the late William II. Van
derbilt which was fi.ed on Saturday last,
gives his widow an annual allowance of
J'200,0,l and the family residence, gives
each of his eight children 510,000,000,
one-half of it absolutely, the st in
trust, provides that Cornelius shall
have ?2. 000,000 additional and his oldest
eon 51,000,000, gives about 2,. 7)0, 000 in
charitable and ether btquests, and di
vides the balance of his vast estate be

Vanderbilt.
In the House at Washington on Tues
day, Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, offered a
concurrent resolution providing for a
holiday recess from next Tuesday, De
comber 22ml, until Tuesday, January
fth. The Senate will, of course, concur
two weeks' time will be lost, but the
pay of the members will go on, and
when they get back to Washington it
will take them another week before
they can get down to business. The
time of the meeting of Congress ought
to be changed to a later date, so that
this annual recess humbug might be
numbered among the time-honored fol
lies of the pas.
When the question of nominatirg a
Chaplain of the House of Representa
tives came before the Democratic cau
cus. Mr. Morrison of Illinois, who fa
vored the selection of Rev. W. II. Mil
burn, the blind preacher from that State,
eaid : "1 have no eloquent figures of
speech with which to address you, but
only plain words. 1 nominate a man
for Chaplain who loves God, hale3 the
Devil, and always votes the straight
Democratic ticket. Knowing the
Northern Methodists of Illinois as I do,
I ask that if a member of that Church
who has voted the Democratic ticket
in that Mate for twenty five years does
not deserve well of a Democratic House,
whodoe3?" This little speech simpli
fied matters amazingly, broke down all
opposition, and Mr. .Milbtirn was nom
inated with a rush. He was Chaplain
of the Senate or House several years
ago, but of which body we cannot speak
with accuracy.
A rnoM i n e.nt member of the Legis
lature from Allegheny county, Robert
fcnodgrass, was asked a few days ago by
a reporter of the Pittsburg Diat'-h,
what he thought of the new three mill
tax law. "It is the most extraordinarily
confused thing I ever knew," said Snod
grass. "It was passed, as yon know, in
a hurry to make up in part for taking
awav flip tax on manufacturing cor
porations. As there is so much differ
ence as to what the act means, the
proper thing would be to repeal if. I
have no doubt it will be repealed at the
next session. '' The question now arises
bow did Suodgrass. who was regarded
as one of the Republican leaders in the
House, vote on this tax bill for the re
peal of which he is now so clamorous ?
We venture the opinion that if the
journal of the House is examined it will
be found that he voted for it "in a
burry" along with over 140 other mem
bers. Passing bills "in a hurry" com
pelled Governor Pattison to exercise the
veto power more frequently at the last
session than was ever done by any of
Lis predecessors, and he would have
strangled this tax law had it not been
for the howl set up at Harrisburg that
Its passage was absolutely necessary to
put the Stale treasury in a sound and
liealthv condition.
So far as the law governing the ques
tion is concerned the Supreme Court of
Ohio on Saturday last disposed of the
contested election cases from Cincin
nati. The court reverses the decision
of the Circuit Court of Hamilton county,
(Cincinnati), which ordered Clerk Dal
ton to issue the certificates of election
to the four Republican candidates for
the Senate and ti e ten Republcans for
the House from Hamilton county, and
directs Lira to issue ihe certificates to
the four Democratic candidates for the
State Striate and to the ten Democratic
candidates for the House. This will
make the legislature consist, as Las all
along been claimed by the Democrats,
of a Democratic majority of three in the
Senate, and a Republican majority of
six in the House, giving the Republi
cans a majority of three on joint ballot.
The election in Cincinnati was very
close, Hoadiey's majority for Governor !
being only a little over Cei0 and we are
inclined to believe that a good deal of j
rrauu was perpetrated bv both rart es.
That seems to be the uniform rule in
Cincinnati, and iu most of the large
cities. It will be a happy day for this
country when an election can be held in
anj and all parts of it without the least
taint of fraud being imputed to either
party, and for that leason compelling
universal acquiescence in the verdict of
the ballot boxes. The millennium,
however, has not yet been ushered in
and is not hkely lj lj during the prta
tut cent ui v.
On Monday last the President sent to
the rtenate, in reply to a resolution of
fered by Mr. Vest, of Missouri, all the
papers and correspondence on file in the
Department of State relating to the ap
pointment of A. M. Keiley as Minister
to Italy and his subsequent appoint
ment as .Minister to Austria. This
correspondence officially establishes the
fact, heretofore well known, that Mr.
Keiley was rejected by the Italian Gov
ernment because of his speech at Rich
mond, Va., in 1871, in relatiou to the
occupation of Rome by the troops of
Victor Emanuel, King of Italy, and the
consequent overthrow of the temporal
power of the Pope. It also shows that
Mr.
Keiley 's rejection by Austria was
put upon the distinct ground that his
wife was a Jewess, the Austrian Gov
ernment, through its Prime Minister,
having informed Mr. B iyard, the Amer
ican Secretary of State, that there ex
isted "scruples"' against the appoint
ment, and that the position of a foreign
envoy wedded to a Jewess by a civil
marriage would be untenable ai d even
impossible in Vienna. On August Gtta
James Fenner Lee, then Secretary of
Legation at Vienna, telegraphed Mr.
Bayard that the Austrian Government
could not receive Mr. Keiley and had
asked the United States to appoint an
other Minister. On August 31st Mr.
Bayard, in a long communication to Mr.
Lee, reviewing the case in detail,
writes :
I5y no act of mine, nor with rr.v consent,
can the Government of the United States be
placed in an attitude of supplication for fa
vor or become a petitioner for recognition
from any foreign power, and this expression
meets the full approval of the Executive.
There is, therefore, and can ba no suseps
tion of expostulation or protest hy us aeainst
the unprecedented action of the Government
of Austria Hungary. All that tias bpen
said and written hy us has been designed to
make it clear that as between thp revoca
tion of Mr. Keiley's appointment bv this
Government ami his rejection as an Envoy
by that of his Imperial and Hoval Maiestv
I the responsibility of the final decision must
j rest with the latter, which, having now sig
nified its determination and accomplished
its object, must abide by the result. Two
facts appear first that the alleged race and
religious faith of the wedded wife of an En
voy ot the i nited states is held a cause for
his rejection, and farther that objections by
a third party, "a frirndlv power," are neces
sary to be removed in order to allow a prop
er reception to be extended. These condi
t:ons are simply intolerable, and are in the
case of the United States not only inhibited
by tne plain spirit and undying letter of our
constitution of government, hut are incon
sistent with the decent self-respect that for
bids a nation of sixty mil'ions of freemen to
accept the position of diplomatic dependen
cy of the "friendly power" whose behests
appear to have been acquiesced in and car
ried out by Austria-Hungary in the present
Instance.
The mission to Austria is now vacant
and will remain so, at least during Pres
ident Cleveland's term of office.
An abstract of the most important
parts of the President's message will be
found on the first page of onr paper.
As we stated last wefk the message is
much too long to make room for the
whole of it in our columns. A or.od
j excuse for its length, however, is the
fact that it is the first message that has
: bien sent to Congress by a Dt-mocratlc
j Pre sident for almost a quarter of a cen
I tury, and therefore Mr. Cleveland had
j abundant reason to "spread himself."
; The message shows that Mr. Cleveland
, has worked with rare industry and
energy in order to make himself thor
oughly familiar with the weighty de
, mands of his high office. His devotion
! to official duties is something remarka
ble and fully establishes his character
; as a hardworking, business man. To
i say that the message has been most fa
vorably received by the pr ss of the
, whole country is simply to state an ad
mitted fact. Whit the Philadelphia
Inquirer, a leading and well tnown Re
publican paper, says of it may be re-
garded as a fair illustration of public
sentiment regarding it. That paper
I says : "Excepting alone upon the sil
j ver question, the entire message is of
j the most conservative character. Ii is
j not what may be called a brilliant one,
' but it is both instructive and interest -!
ing, and is likely to give very general
: satisfaction and tend to give confidnence
; to the representatives of the great m;m
i ufact tiring, commercial and financial
interests of the country. It is char,
; direct and m inly in manner and exhaus
tive in matter." Grover Cleveland lias
shown himself to be a much bigger man
than the Republicans were willing to
admit he was at the outset of his ad
ministration, and he will continue to
' grow in public confldence day by day as
, bis term of office progresses.
Di:, HiriiiEE, the Superintendent of
; Public Instruction, has submitted his
i annual report for the year ending June
1, 1SS5. The number cf enrolled ptipils
, has increased 16,110, making a total of
' 02, 15S. The increase of average nuro
i ber of pupils in actual attendance is 21,
j 450, which is 5.331 more than the in
i crease of number of enrolled pupils,
i The difference between the number en
I rolled and the number in attendance, is
I too large, numbering 325,030. The to
i tal number of teachers now engaged is
22, St 54, an increase of 400. There has
; been a decrease of SS in number of male
' teachers and an increas of 4 in num
j ber of female teachers. The average
j monthly salary is very little. For
j males it is now $30.01 and for females
30. OS. The Superintendent says this
; is far below what it should bo. Keep
; ing in mind that the number of female
teachers is 5,022 in excess of the number
: of male teachers, and that their average
monthly salary is about Dine dollars
less, it is evident that there is yet much
unjust discrimination against female
teachers in respect of salary, while there
is a growing recognition of their great
value in our educational work. He
trusts that this unjust discrimination
will soon be removed. Often the very
serious mistake is made of promoting
teachers from the primary grade to an- j
othr grade in order to secure for them i
a higher salary. In regard to the re- j
cent law requiring physiology and hy- ,
giene to be taught in the schools the re
port says : Of course, where child; ee j
cannot read intelligently or with ease it !
would Ik? a monstrous reversion of or
dinary common sense to expect them to
use a text book. Instruction must anel
ought to be given properly adapted to
the age and attainment of the pupil.

THE IEAI)Mll.LIO.41KE.
The vanity of worldly wealth is strik
ingly illustrated at this moment when
William II. Vanderbilt lies dead amid
th evidences of the enormous wealth
of which be was the possessor only a
few hours since. Three days ago he
could have drawn a check for ruiiious.
Three days ago he cou'd look around
his spacious residence at the rare and
costly gems and luxuries with which
Iiismoney had surrounded him and say:
"All this is mine." To-day his hands
are crossed over his breast and his eyes
hre closed forever. He is poorer and of
less consequence in the world to day
than the humblest servant in his house
hold. What a fruitful theme for the church
pulpits! If Mr. Vanderbilt had been a
great philanthropist like Cooppr, Pea
body or Montefiore ; if he had distin
guished himself in statesmanship, liter
ature or art. his death might have sent
a thrill of sv:-.:Uhv through the coun
try and read a different lesson to those
he left behind. But he chose a different
life. While he occasionally did acts of
great liberality, such as his gift to the
Medical College, his payment of the ob
elisk expenses and his donations to the
Vanderbilt University, and while his
private acts of charity were probably
numerous, he followed a business life,
interspersed with such pleasures as suit
ed his taste. His pursuit was business;
all his thoughts were of business mat
ters, and he died while talking business
with a friend.
It is singular that, while a Republi
can in politics, Mr. Vanderbilt was en
tirely democratic in his habits and feel
ings. II is wealth is estimated at $200,
000,000. People dj not stop to think
what that means. At an average of 4
per cent, it means an income of 22,000
a day a larger amount than is made
by more than one man out of every ten
thousand engaged in business through
out the United States.
Yet, despite this temptation to aristo
cratic indulgences, Mr. Vanderbilt pre
ferred the solid comfort of democratic
simplicity. He built himself a magnif
icent residence, it is true, Aud furnished
it sumptuously. But this was for home
enjoyment, and its luxuries were hidden
behind the blinds. He cared nothing
for fashion. He did not court the so
ciety of distinguished foieigners. In
deed, he cared little for society other
than congenial companions. Within
the walls of his Fifth Avenue palace he
lived more plainly probably than some
of his clerks in their humbler homes.
He made no display in dres or equipa
ges. He loved horses, but had no pas
sion for the "turf." He owned no
yachts, castles or villas, and did not
make a study of foreign fashions.
The most interesting feature of the
democraic sid.. of Mr. Vanderbilfs
character, however, is illustrated in the
marriage of his children. His sons all
have hv-nest American wives; his
(idug'uers all have plain, unpretending
American husbands. There has been
no atter.ipt on either side to connect
titles with tht- family Lumebv means vf

The Kicliest Woman hi the World.
Donna Isadora Ci usina, of Smtiago,
Chiii, is described by a correspondent of
the New Yoik .ni as th? t'ro'sus of
South America. She is a widow, but
still young ar.d handsome. ;in.l it is said
there are few men or women in the
wor.d richer than she. There is no end
to her money and no limit to her extrav
agance, and people call her the Count
ess of Monte Cristo. She traces her an
cestry back to the days of the Conqest.
She has inexhastible coal and ore mines,
a iarcre number of snips, and farm and
grazing land that cannot be measured by
acres. Fabulous stories are told of her
extravagance. She :3 very fond of
young men, and has from fifteen to
twenty young fellows around her con
stantly, to whom she gives all the money
they can spend. In return she expects
them to entertain her. While the Uni
ted States fleet was at Valparaiso not
long ago she invited all the officers to
spend a week with her at "Macul" and
Santiago, and sent a special train to
bring them up. Admiral Upshur and
about twenty of his officers accepted the
invitation, lodged at the widow's bouses
and rode in her carriages, and had a
high old time at her expense. She would
not allow one of them to spend a dollar,
and sent word to all the shops and res
taurants that anything the American
officers ordered should be charged to her
account. A million of dollars or so is
a trifij to a woman whose incorr.e is so
enormous, and there is nothing in the
world that she will not buy if she hap
pens to w. it it. She doesn't care much
for art, but has a collection of diamonds
that is very large and valuable, and
sometimes appears loaded down with
them. Usually she looks very shabby,
as she has no taste or ambition in dress,
and her party costumes tha are ordered
from Paris are seldom worn. She has
made munificent public bequests. She
maintains a close watch over all her
various affairs, and with all her foibles
is said to be an excellent business
woman. She has two daughters. 17 and
10 years old, and a sou 24 years old.
; A xew phase of boycotting has come
into fashion in Ireland. At a recent
public demonstration held at PortUw,
County Waterford, where a certain Mi
chael Ilickey was denounced for evict
ing a workingman, a Miss Margaret
Sheehan came forward, and, as the pa
pers say. in a few eloquent words pro
posed the following resolution : "That
we. the young girls of Waterford, Tip
perrary and Kilkenny, resolve and prom
ise this day. before this vast multitude,
to treat v if h scorn and contempt any
matrimonial proposals from Michael
Ilickey, as a punishment for his high
toned hostility to the poor laborer
Uurk? and his ycung and helpless fam
itv of sever,." The resolution found a
seconder :: the person of Miss Sullivan,
and it was carried with acclamation.

TIIK PFSIO LIST.
Twenty years have passed since the
civil war ended, yet to day the list of
pensioners is Dot only greater than ever
before, but growing enormously. Ten
years after the close ef the war it had
begun to dwindle, as it naturally would
on account of the deaths of veterans,
the marriages of soldiers' widows, and
tho coming of age of their children.
Then the legislation of Congress made
a change. The arrears act aloiv added
an ultimate liability variously eslima'ed
in official documents at between S2"iO,
0O0.(nh ft,,d S.-21.00000, and not yet
eleter mined.
As years roll on, the fruits of this leg
islation tiecorae apparent. Although
the number of names dropped from the
list since ISO.j, from death and other
causes, must be reckoned in hundreds
of thousands, the names added more
than counterbalance thm. Last year,
for examp", as Gen. Black's report
shows 15.253 names were dropped, but
3".78 new ones were added, besides
many reinstatements. Looking through
successive annual reportsof the Pension
Office, we Dnd that, while the aggregate
roll rnmbe-rrd 2GS,S30 pnsionrs in
18S1, 2S5.005 pensioners in 1SS2, 303,033
pensioners in 1SS3, and 322.750 pension
ers in lSi, it had reached 345,125 for
the year ending June 30, 1SS5. This is
an addition of nearly thirty per cent, in
four years. Again, we find the aggre
gate annual value of pensions, which
was $28,70!). 007 four years ago, in
creased vear by year until it is now
538.000.0S5. Even this great outlay
does not represent all the country pays,
since every year it gives many millions
for arrears of pensions, and the total
outlay last year was thus brought up to
nearly sixty five millions. For the past
two years it has averaged over sixty
millions.
Yet we have not reached the maxi
mum of annual pension liability. Offi
cial calculations have shown that, even
or the basis of present legislation, the
roll of pensioners will be increased over
all natural diminutions to between 425.
00) and 500 000. and the annual cost of
pensions, exclusive of outright payments
for arrears, to between ? 14.000(XiO and
S50.000.000. Before the year lS'.HJ the
amount laid out on pensions since 1S01
wiO be more than a billion dollars.
Xeverthe'ess schemes are rife for
enormously increasing the pension bur
dens of the Treasury. Some of them
involve amounts so prodigious that their
projectors har liy venture into accurate
calculations of what they will cost.
The Mexican War Pension bill, which
itself would have entailed vast expenses,
was saddled with amendments when
discussed in the last 'Congress, that
would have swamoed the Treasury.
Or of t lie proposals which will again
be urged upon Con cress is that of pen
sioning to an extent depending on
length of service all so'diers who fought
in the Union armies. Several bills aim
at this result, one of them giving to any
surviving soldier or sailor, sick or well,
rich or poor, $ a month for the rest, of
his life. Another bill gives, in addi
tion, 100 acres of land to each man.
Still another bill gives graded pensions
to all who were captured and confined
in Confederate prisons, even where no
disability resulted. Oihers provide for
very large increases of existing pen
sions. With the pension outlay- now amount
ing annually to more t han sixty mini-ins.
and certain to increase during many
years, it s th put of prudence to r--j'Ct
Folunvs that propose to add enor
mous and indeed 'inkno-.vn liabilities to
tho burdens already resting n the
Treasury. X. V. Snn.

Who does nnt delight to see a good-look-ine
face? Yet erysipelas disfigures the
features ttimost beyond recognition. But
that is not the worst of it. This disease is
as dangerous as it is repulsive. It Is some
times called "St. Anthony's Fire," and often
causes sudden death. Mr. S. Ii. Carpenter,
of (irandville, N. Y., had It in both legs and
was cured by Dr. Kennedy's Favorite Rem
edy. This medicine excels all others for the
blood. Especially adapted to persons In
feeble health.
