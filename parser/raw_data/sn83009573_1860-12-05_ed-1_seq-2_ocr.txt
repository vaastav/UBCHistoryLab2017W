BA LTIMO R E.
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1800
In order (o present to our readers, and the pub
lic generally, the annual Message of the President—
n document of for more than ordinary interest at
this juncture —in the shortest possible time, we
effected an arrangement by which, in combination
with the American, and at joint expense, it was
expressed through from Washington in printed
form. By this mean 3 complete and carefully cor
rected copies were on our counter within one hour
from the moment of the commencement of the
reading in Congress. The time was the shortest
ever made between the two points, that of the en
gine being forty six minutes, and of the ex
press wagon, within this city, including all de
lays, fen minutes more. This feat reflects credit
on Mr. C. C. FULTON, who superintended the ar
rangement, and Mr. IT. CHABOT, of the American
office, who attended to the details. The train was
under the direct superintendance of Mr. PERKINS,
Master of Machinery of the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad, accompanied by Mr DIFFF.Y, Supervisor,
and Mr. W. 0. QUINCEY, Assistant Roadmaster.
Mr. RICHARD ARMSTRONG; acted as conductor, and
Mr. JoKni'A KINC. had charge of the engine. By
this mode of supplying the Message, our columns
are left free for other matter, and we arc enabled
to lay before our readers this morning the Report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, complete, to
gether with a very full synopsis of that of the
Postmaster General, both documents of great in
terest and importance.
A mingled feeling of curiosity and anxiety per
vaded this city yesterday, up to the time w hen the
President's Message was received, and from the
eagerness with which that document was sought
after, we may presume that it lias been read before
this, by the majority of those who looked forward
to a careful perusal of it as to a pleasant or neces
sary duty. The only portion of the Message which
is likely- to give rise to any discussion, or, indeed,
to attract any serious attention, is that which
treats of our domestic difficulties. Cur foreign re
lations are, in the main, in as satisfactory a condi
tion as we could well hope for, and the only
thing calling for immediate notice in this connec
tion is tiie extraordinary fact that no mention,
whatever, is made of Peru. When it is remem
bered that the Administration lias just broken off
all diplomatic intercourse with that Government,
and that our Minister, having left the coun
try, has just landed in New York, it cannot
ail to strike every one as being a very singular, if
not suspicious circumstance, that Mr. BUCHANAN
has abstained from the slightest allusion to Peru.
All these matters, however, must he left for future
comment, for the public is not likely to concern
itself at this moment with anything but our home
troubles. It was not expected that the PRESIDENT
would throw much light on the questions that di
vide tbe country, or suggest any novel or practi
cal solution of the difficulty in which we are in
volved, and though the people may not see their
way any clearer to-day than they did a week ago,
they will not, we presume, feel any especial dis
appointment. Mr. BUCHANAN has endeavored to
show the causes of the unhappy quarrel between
the two sections, and to point out the redress
which the one ought to seek and the other to
grant, and he has done so calmly and impartially,
but by no means forcibly. Ilia argument on the
vexed question touching the connection between
the States and the Federal Government is neither
striking nor convincing. HE undertakes to prove
in the first place, that no Stste lias a right to se
cede, but that such a movement is a simple revolu
tion, and he next proceeds to show that tiie gene
ral government cannot lawfully resist such a
movement. The people of South Carolina, there
fore, may rebel, and if tbe State authorities sane,
tioti the proceeding, the PRESIDENT and Congress
can do nothing but protest, for the former is satis
fied tbat the Constitution does not warrant him
in recommending the coercion of a Statr>. The
only deduction we can draw from his theory is
that the right of revolution may be exorcised at
any time by any member of the confederation, for
if the Federal Government can never repress such a
revolution, a State may go out of the Union for any
cause or for no cause at nil. South Carolina may se
cede on account of a Homestead or Tariff Bill as welj
:ts on any other grounds, whether they be friro.
lons or just, and dir. BUCHANAN can no more
collect revenue than he can do anything else in a
seceding State. Practically, then, the right of
secession exists, though it may not be deduceible
from the precise language of the Constitution or
from Use isistory of the Convention by wliich tlic
latter was formed. We cannot but think this
construction of the Constitution is altogether
unsound. It cannot be that the right of revolu
tion can exist, unless the right to judge of its pro
priety and to resist it resides in the Government
whose authority is defied. If 'be latter can do
nothing to prevent a State from withdrawing its
allegiance, then such act'ou on the part of such
■State can scarcely lie called a revolution. But if
secession is revolution, it seems to us that the
General Government has the inherent and undeni
able power to suppress it. it might be unwise to
exercise tiiat power, and as against the coutem.
plated movement at the South it certainly would
be injudicious and ruinous to do so; but that the
PRESIDENT and Congress have the mere legal right
to put down a revolution, insurrection o.r rebellion
in a State we cannot doubt.
For the benefit of stieh of our readers as desire
to read the President's Message in a condensed
form, we present the following abstract :
The Message commences with the declaration
that since the last meeting of Congress the country
has been eminently prosperous in all its material
interests, and that "no nation in the tide of time
"has ever presented a spectacle cf greater material
"prosperity than we have done until within a
"very recent period." TH ■ PRESIDENT then asks
why it is that discontent now so extensively pre
vails and the Union of the rstates is threatened
with destruction? The answer to this question
he finds in the long continued and intemperate in
terference of the Northern people with the question
of slavery in the Southern States. The peril
which now menaces the people is not ascribed to
any one or more of the causes usually assigned,
but "to the incessant and violent agitation of the
"slavery question throughout the North for the
"last quarter of a century," which has created an
insubordinate spirit in the slave population by in
spiring them with vague notions or freedom, and
has given place, among the white population of
the South, to apprehensions of servile insurrection.
If those homes anil firesides are to he rendered
habitually and hopelessly insecure by the aggres
sive spirit of the anti-slavery party North, sooner
or later the bonds of the Union will be severed.
The conviction, however, is expressed, that this
fatal period lias not yet arrived. But to avert the
danger we are admonished to take warning in
time, and remove the cause of it. The Message
next treats of the progress of the anli-slavery
movement from 1835 to the present time, and as
serts that it is perfectly easy for the American
people to settle the slavery question forever, and
restore peace and harmony to the Union. They
can do it by simply declaring that the Slave
States shall be let alone and permitted to manage
their domestic institutions in their own way.
They alone as sovereign States are responsible for
what they do, and not the people of the North,
who have no more right to interfere there than in
Russia or in Brazil. Reliance is still placed upon
their good sense and forbearance to avert the peril
which is now impending.
President BUCHANAN does not find, in the elec
tion of Mr.-LINCOLN, any just cause for dissolving
the Union, especially as that election has been ef
fected by a mere plurality vote, and under circum
stances which may never again occur. Referring
to the argument that the antecedents of the Presi
dent elect justify ihe fears of the South that he
will violate their constitutional rights, the PRESI
DENT asks whether apprehensions of contingent
danger will justify the destruction of the noblest
system of government ever devised by mortals?
He moreover declares that a President of the
UNITED STATES must be necessarily conservative,
from the very nature of his office. His duties are
wholly executive. Congress 13 exclusively clothed
with the power to make laws, and the fact is dwelt
upon that, with the exception of the Missouri
Compromise, no single act has ever passed Congress
impairing, in the slightest degree, the rights of the
South to their properly in slaves. To the demand
of the Southern State s for immediate secession, on
the ground that they are denied equal rights in the
Territories, the PRESIDENT declares that this denial
is based upon no authority whatever; that in his
belief Congress wiil never pass laws to exclude
slavery from the Territories, and that, as the Su
preme Conn !i .bounty decided that slaves are
property, th y a It ink'ii into tin Territories
and held there under id. protection of the Cansti
tntion. The act of ths Kansas Legislature, pro
hibiting slavery in that Territory, is denounced
as a violation of the Constitutional compact, and
one which would be declared void if the ques
tion were submitted to the juijicary. "The
"most palpable violations of constitutional duty"
.are charged to be those acts of tbe different State
Legislatures which were intended to defeat
the execution of the fugitive slave law. The fugi
tive slave law has been held to be Constitutional
in all the Courts in which the question has been
tried, with the exception of a State Court in Wi9-
consin, and in that instance the decision of the iiife. |
rior Court was reversed when the case wag brought
before the proper appellate tribunal. The validi
ty of the law having thus been established over !
and over again, it is urged that the next PRESI- I
DENT will be constrained to see that its provisions '
are faithfully executed, and the hope is expressed
that be will not fail in the performance of this
high duty. "Let us wait for the overt act. Let
"us trust the State Legislatures will repeal their
"obnoxious laws. Unless this slml! be done,
"there is no human power that can save the I
"Union. The right of the Southern States to
demand this act of justice is conceded. If it be
refused by the North; then the States aggrieved
would be justified in revolutionary resistance to
the Government of the Union. But whilst the
right of revolution is affirmed, the right of seces
sion is denied, as being "wholly inconsistent with
"the history as well as the character of the Fed
"eral Constitution,'' and arguments are brought
forward and authorities quoted to show that the
Constitution gives- no countenance to sncli a the
ory. The Message then goes on to state what the
powers of the Federal Government are, and how
they are limited. The Cramers of the Constitu
tion, it is declared, "never intended to implant
"in its bosom the seeds of its own destruction,
"nor were they guilty of the absurdity of prcvi
"ding for its own dissolution." They intended
that it should lie "a substantial and mighty fabric,
"capable of resisting the slow decay of time, and of
"defying the storms of ages." To this end they
wi3ly adopted the rule of strict construction, and
therefore had no reason to imagine "that the
"Constitution would ever be so interpreted as to
"enable any State, by her own act and without
"the consent of her sister States, to discharge her
"people from all or any of their Federal obliga
"tions." The right of a State to resist the op
pression of any other State is declared to exist in
dependently of all Constitutions; but secession is
asserted to be neither more nor less than revolu
tion. "It may not be a justifiable revolution, but
"still it is revolution." In case of a State prac
tically demonstrating her determination to secede
from the Union, the Federal EXECUTIVE is bound
by his oath to take care that the laws be faith
fully executed; but this duty may be rendered im
possible by events over which he could not
have exercised any control. Such is said to be
the case in the present instance, with reference to
the position assumed by South Carolina, wher®
the whole machinery of the Federal Government,
so for as the Judiciary is concerned, has been de
molished, avith little or no hope of replacing it. —
The Acts of Congress empowering the PRESIDENT
to sustain the Marshal in executing civil process,
by calling out the militia, and the army and navy,
are cited, and are shown to be utterly useless in a
Slate where there is no longer any Judicial author
ity to Issue process: where tlifre is no Marshal to
execute it and where the popular resistance is gen
eral. The revenue laws in South Carolina still
continue to be enforced. No obstacles have, as
yet, been interposed to prevent the collection of
the customs, and were the Collector to resign his
office, another might be appointed in his
place. In this particular, no unsuperable
difficulties occur. With respect to the pro
perty of the UNITED STATES in South Carolina—its
forts and arsenafo and munitions of war—it is be
lieved that 110 attempt will be made by the citi
zens of South Carolina to get possession of them.
If, however, a determination should be evinced to
seize the forts, the officer in command lias order s
to act strictly on the defensive.
The question which is next discussed is as to
whether the Executive has any authority to decide
"what shall be the relations between the Federal
Government and South. Carolina. The conclu
sion reached is that he possesses no such authority,
and that any attempt to exercise such poi.er would
he an act of usurpation. Has then, Congress the
power to compel a State, by force of arms, to remain
in the Union ? The PRESIDENT declares it to be his
conviction that no such power has been delegated to
Congress or to any other department of the Fede
ral Government—that it was expressly refused to
Congress by the Convention which framed the
Constitution. The power to make war against a
State is asserted to be at variance with the whole
spirit and intent of the Constitution; for a con
quered State could only be held by the exercise
of despotic power, and even then no physical
force could control (lie will of the people or compel
them to elect Senators and representatives to Con
gress, or to perform any of the other duties required
of a free member of the Confederacy. Even if the au
thority existed to coerce them, it would not be wise
to exercise it nder the circumstances; for, al
though the object of the war would be to preserve
the Union, its final result would be to destroy it,
and to render future reconciliation impossible.
The Union rests upon public opinion, and can
never be cemented by the blood of its citizens shed
in civil war. The President solemnly adjures liis
countrymen to pause and deliberate before they
determine to destroy ttie temple consecrated by
the blood of the men of the Revolution, by the
glories ol the past, and by the hopes of the future.
A dissolution of the Union ought to be the last
desperate remedy of a despairing people, after
every Constitutional means of conciliation had
been exhausted. The slavery question, in his
opinion, lias already passed its culminating point.
Congress can do much towards averting the pres
ent peril, by proposing and recommending to
the Legislatures of the several States the remedy
for existing evils which the Constitution has it
self provided for its own preservation. An
"explanatory amendment" of the Constitution is
earnestly recommended, as best adapted to carry
out the object in view. That explanatory amend
ment might be made to consist of the following
points:—
1. An express recognition of the right of property in
slaves in the States where it now exists, or may hereafter
exist.
2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common
Territories throughout their territorial existence, and un
til they shall be admitted as States into the Union, with
or without slavery, as their constitutions may prescribe.
3. A like recognition of the right of the master to have
his slave, who has escaped from one State to another, re
stored and "delivered up" to him, and of the validity of
the fugitive slave law enacted for this purpose, together
with a declaration that all State laws impairing or de
feating this right are violations of the Constitution, and
are consequently null and void.
It is admitted that the construction of the Consti
tution lias already been settled by the SUPREME
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES; but the amendment
is nevertheless urged, on the ground that a large
proportion of the people contest the correctness of
the Judicial decision, and that such "explanatory
"amendment," if accepted by them and incorpor
ted into the Constitution, would terminate exist
ing dissensions, and restore peace and harmony
among the States.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
CHEAT BRITAIN.
Our relations with Great Britain arc of the
most friendly character. The disputes arising
from the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty and the Right of
Search have been amicably and honorably ad
justed. Great Britain has ceded the Bay Islands
to Honduras, and the Mosquito Territory to Ni
caragua. The only question of any importance
which is not yet adjusted, is that which has refer
ence to the disputed title to to the Island of San
Juan. This matter is still tinder negotiation.—
The visit of the PRINCE OF WALES is pronounced
to have been an auspicious event, which, in its
consequences, cannot fail to increase the kindred
and kindly feelings which ought to actuate the
government and people of both countries.
FRANCE.
Our relations with France are also of the most
friendly character. The French tribunals have
recognized the natural right of expatriation, and
in two cases recently, natives of France, who had
become American citizens, have been released
from service in the French army.
RUSSIA.
Our relations with Russia are as friendly as it is
possible for us to desire.
SPAIN.
Our relations with Spain are more complicated,
but less dangerous than they were in former
years. The numerous claims held by American
citizens against the Spanish government were
transferred to a joint Commission for adjustment.
The Cuban claims alone were recognized as valid,
the Spanish government agreeing to pay over to
the claimants one hundred thousand dollars of the
amount within three months from the exchange of
ratifications, the remainder of the sum due being
held back until the Amistnd claims were settled
by the United Slate 3. No other claim has been
recognized by the Convention. The acquisition
of Cuba by fair purchase is again recommended to
the action of Congress.
AUSTRIA.
Our relations with Austria are of the most
friendly character.
The peaceful policy pursued by the Government
toward China has been productive of the most
satisfactory results. The claims of our citizens
have been adjusted by a hoard of Commissioners,
and of the sum- a.vir.led i large proportion
has already been pii i.
There is reason to hope that under the stipula
tions of the treaty with Japan, our trade with that
Empire wiil rapidly increase, and that from the
satisfaction expressed by the Japanese Embassy
during their visit to this country, the friendship
at present existing between the two countries
will be perpetuated.
BRAZIL.
With Brazil our relations are of the most ami
cable character.
. NEW GRANADA.
The CASS-IIERUAN treaty, after many delays, has
at length been mutually ratified, and by the terms
of the Convention the Government of New Grana
da consents to bold itself responsible for dam
ages caused to American citizens by the riot at
Panama.
COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA
The claims of American citizens against the Gov
ernment of COSTA RICA have been adjusted; but the
claims of our citizens against tiie Government
of Nicaragua have not yc-t been provided lor hy
treaty.
MEXICO.
Into a discussion of our political relations with
Mexico, the Message enters largely. Very little
has, as yet, hern accomplished towards adjusting
the claims of our citizens against that Govern
ment, and no satisfactory arrangement can lie
concluded until the war between the opposite fic
tions in Mexico is brought to a close.
KANSAS AND UTAH.
The internal troubles which have existed in Kan
sas and Utah are reviewed at considerable length.
The PRESIDENT still expresses the opinion that it
was clearly his duty to present the Lecompton Con
stitution to Congress, as all the proceedings which
preceded and followed its formation, were fair and
regular on their face. He believed and still be
lieves that tbe interests of the people of Kansas
would have been best consulted by its admission
as a State into the Union under ihe Lecompton
Constitution, which they could have amended at
their pleasure. "It is true" lie adds, "that the
"whole Constitution has not been submitted to
"the people, as 1 always desired; hut the prece
dents are numerous of the admission of States
"into the Union without such submission." In
Utah, lie reports that peace lias been restored, and
that the pacific policy adjusted by him lias been
pursued with eminent success. The only cause for
regret, being the heavy expenditure incurred in
moving a large'detachment of the army to that
remote region, and in furnishing it with sub
sistence.
FINANCES.
During the last Fiscal year, ending on the 30th
of June, 18G0, the total expenditures of the Gov
ernment in all its branches—exclusive of the pub
lic debt, were reduced to the sum of $55,402,465.-
•10— the total expenditures for the year ISSB, were
£71,901,129.77, and those of 1859 amounted to
£00,340,220.13. The interest on the public debt
tor the fiscal year, ending June 30, 1800, inclusive
of Treasury notes, amounted to £3,177,314.02,
which added to the £55,402,405.40 first mention
ed, makes the aggregate expenditures of the Gov
ernment for 1800, £58.579,780.08. Allowance
must, however, be made for the cutting down of
the estimates of some departments by Congress,
which crippled the service. Tt is however asserted
that the sum of §61,000,000, or at most §62,000,-
000, is amply sufficient to cover all the expendi
tures of the Government under ordinary circum
stances.
AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, &C.
Since the date of the last Annual Message not a
single slave lias been imported from Africa into
the UNITED STATES. Congress is also congratu
lated upon the change which has taken place in
the UNITED STATES in relation to filibustering fo
rays upon neighboring States. The construction
of a railroad to the Pacific is earnestly recom
mended, and it is urged that sufficient powers
should he delegated to the PRESIDENT to enable
him to protect the lives and properties of Ameri
can citizens passing over the different transit routes
to the Pacific, and on the occasion of lawless out
breaks in South and in Central America.
ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.
Congress is recommended to pass a law ap
pointing a day certain, previous to the ttli of
March of each year, of an odd number, for the
election of Representatives throughout all the
States, for the purpose of remedying the defects of
the present system of elections.
TARIFF.
A modification of the Tariff is regarded as ne
cessary, for the purpose of increasing the revenue,
and specific duties are recommended, to secure to
the manufacturing interests that amount of inci
dental encouragement which results from a reve
nue tariff. Ths immediate attention of Congress
is called to the present condition of the Treasury,
as exhibited in the Secretary's Report, and it is
urged that measures be promptly adopted to ena
ble the Treasury to discharge its pressing obliga
tions. The Reports of the Secretaries of War; of
the Navy: of the Interior; and of the Postmaster
General, are also submitted. The Attorney Gen
eral is complimented for the able manner in which
he lias discharged the duties of bis office; the
famine in Kansas is referred to the consideration
Congress, and to the favorable regard of the same
body are committed the interests of the people of
the District of Columbia.
DEATH OF AN ARMY OFFICER. —Lieut. David
Bell, of ihe Ist Cavalry U. S. Army, died at Old
I'oint Comfort, Va., on the 2d inst. lie was sta

THE KANSAS TROUBLES.
LEAVENWORTH, IV. T., Dec. 3.—Montgomery at

Nothing has yet been heard from the troops.
WARSAW, Mo., Dec. 3. —Thomas Murray, of this
city, has just returned from the military'encamp
ment beyond Clinton. He represents Gen. Frost's
brigade as going along finely, and says the compa
nies of calvalry must be near the troubled district
bv this time.
The citizens of Clinton gave the brigade a warm
welcome, and sent wagons to bring in those who
wore disabled.
Dr. Melton hasjust returned again from Fort
Scott, and represents ail quiet there,, and that
Montgomery's band, a hundred strong, is posted
at Sugar Mound.
Montgomery has ordered several citizens of Bates
to leave, under penalty of death if they remain.
A meeting held at Clinton, on Saturday, passed
resolutions requesting the Governor to hold and
imprison all persons purporting to come from
Southern Kansas, who deny the existence of any
tronble there, believing that they belong to Mont
gomery's band, and were accessary to the murder
of Scott, Hines, Bishop, Moore,' and others. The
resolution also declares for a Southern Republic,
unless protection is given them.
FROM SOUTH AMERICA.— By the advices of the
Northern Light at New York, we learn that there
is no change in the state of New Granadian distur
bances. It is reported that both President Aspina
and the revolutionary chief, Mosquera, were ac
tively preparing for a decisive battle. The trans
portation of Government troops by British mail
steamers from one point to another, is loudly con
demned by the Revolutionists, and Gov. Nieto had
forwarded to Lord John Russell a protest against
this act of intervention. The United States steam
corvette Wyoming, from Callao, arrived at Panama
on the 22d ult., having on board Hon. J. R. Clay,
United States Minister at Peru, and family. Mr.
Clay arrived in the Northern Light. The news from
the different Sonth American Republics is unimpor
tant. From Salvador, in Central America, we
learn that magnificent funeral ceremonies had been
celebrated in memory of the late Ex-President
Mora, of Costa Rica. President Martinez, of Ni
caragua, had re-established the capitol of that Re
public at Managua. In Costa Rica it is asserted
that the most frightful tyranny prevails.
THE PRINCE OF WALES AT BUNKER HI 1,1.
AND MOUNT VERNON.
[ From the London Globe, Nov. 16.1
The tour of the Prince of Wales affords a triple
gratification. In itself it is one of the boldest and
best things ever yet done by a royal mother bent
upon educating her children in the most whole
some way. That a Prince should see real life, as
our Prince has seen it, that he should, in some sense,
have to rough it with the rest of the men, to cross
a stormy ocean, to meet with insolence from fac
tion, but also to meet with the warmest, handsomest
and most cordial greeting ever ottered to a Prince
out of his own country, is a great fact, and one that
must tell in the modern education of scibns of royal
blood. The mere exercise of travelling so many
thousands of miles, the mere effect of seeing so
great a variety of natural scenery, and of encoun
tering such wide diversities of people, cannot fail
to have exerted an influence as new as it must be
beneficial, by enlarging the mind of the traveller
and testing all his (acuities to keep pace with the
emergencies of the hour. It is gratifying to us
that the Queen of England should have departed
from routine and sent forth her son, the heir
of her throne, in some sense to make his way in
the world. The wisdom of sending him abroad
tbus early in life is one source of satisfaction,
and the beneficial effect' of his travels upon
himself js another. But the widest and
most complete is to be found in the new tone this
visit has imparted to our relations with the United
States. The old feud is burnt out. _ The antagon
ism, which arose from misappreciation and de
nreciation, is greatly mitigated. Such spectacles
as those we have read of, cannot occur without
leaving deep and nseful effects. The Prince of
Wales in the capitol of the United States is a
great fact; but greater by far is a Prince of Wales
bareheaded at the grave of George Washington.—
We reciprocate the hearty enthusiasm of the New
Yorkers, and admire their colossal modes of show
ing it, but tiie miles of torches fade out of sight,
and the shouts of thousands are unheard, when the
descendant of George the Third stands lace to face
with the sole survivor of the bloody fight at Bun
ker Hill, when the monument which'coininemorates
that sad story is decked out with the Union Jack
and the Stars and Stripes. " Long after the train
had left Boston," says the Timea' correspondent,
" this great column could be seen with its rival
banners for the first time floating together over
the emblem of by-gone strife." And long may the
memory of that graceful sight remain in the hearts
of both nations, and long may the feelings excited
by the Prince's visit survive to warn ourselves and
our cousins from fratricidal quarrels. The British
people are proud of the way in which the Ameri- I
can people have received the British Prince, and
they are proud of their Prince, who so worthily
represented a royal race and a great nation. |

NICW CONGRESSIONAL APPORTIONMENT.
The census of 1860 having been completed, it
now remains to make the new apportionments of
Congressional Districts according to that census.
On previous occasions this has been accomplished
by a special act of Congress as soon as the cepsus
has been taken, but by an act of Congress passed
May 23, 18G0, it is provided "that from and after
the 3d day of March, 1853, the House of Repre
sentatives shall be composed of 233 members," to
be appointed according to the following arrange
ment:
As soon a.s the returns of the census haTe been
made to the olfice of the Department of the Inte
rior,itsha'l be the duty of the Secretary of that
Department to ascertain the aggregate representa
tive population of the United States, which is
effected by the following means, viz : by adding to
the whole number of free persons in the United
States, "including those bound to service for a
number of years, and excluding Indians not taxed,
three-fifths of all other persons," which aggregate
population the Secretary shall divide by the number
233, and the product of said division, rejecting any
fraction of a unit, shall be the ratio of apportion
ment of Representatives among the various States.
The Secretary of the Interior shall then proceed
in the same manner to ascertain the representative
population of each State by the rati i already de
termined by him as above shown; and the result of
this last division shall be the number of Represen
tatives appointed to each State.
The loss in the number of members caused bv the
fractions remaining in the several States shall lie
compensated for by assigning to so ma y States
having the largest fractions an additional member
