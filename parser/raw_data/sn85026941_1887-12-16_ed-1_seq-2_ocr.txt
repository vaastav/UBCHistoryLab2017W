Speaker ' 'arlrsle has a big job on

more trouble than appears on the
surface. How to an ange the Com?

question, but in the organization
of this Congress there seems to be
more confusion than usual. The
truth is then- has been a good deal

"Ynti iimi'i mean actual f.tra

"No," replied Mr. Plaine. "N

tcctive feature as an object, ai

ctlile duties."
'i don't quite comprehend th
l.i-i point," said the reporter.
?T mean." said Mr. Plaine, "th
for the flntl time in the history
the liiit'd States the Preside
recommends retaining the intern

that the tax on tobacco be retaine
and thus tiii* man) million i ann

Mr. Plaine favors the repeal

ultimately, n-liel could be given
that direction, it would, in n
?ndgment, be a ? ise and beneficoi

Concerning protection to woi
growers, Mr. Blainesaid : "I shool
l :\ objeel to the repeal i
the duty on wool. To repeal tin
would win l, great injustice to mai
inter?s) <." i'in- question ot labe

The interview, which is of coi
? .le length, gives a I.ici
statement of Mr. Plaint's \ iews a

one of which, he holds, was th

To the question concerning th.

tin- South, Mr. Blaine said: "

liar m.mu. i. A girl having tin
babe in hi i ?inns whirled aionmi
on her heel w itbout at the
time supporting the child's head
ami ueck, Soon alter a change
was noticed in (he child. It began
to ??isle and pine, while Its head
I.ame swollen to thrice its normal
size. It soon became evident that
the child wan siifterlnt, from water
on t ? tie result of tbe in
piiv to the neck. To add to its sad
condition, il became totally blind,
deaf and paralysed, and only it?.
fainl cry ami its ability to take
ainent gave evidence that the
vital s|iaik still remained. The at
tending physician declared thechtld
must die. e of the case
?i surgical operation, recommended
by Dr. Vance, was determined up?
on. A piece of the skull-bone was
removed anil a draining-tube put
into tbe ("IV,ties ut the brain,
through winch the water escaped.
For man) ?reeks ban lagea were
kept aliOUl the head and the liquid
force?! out ot the brain cavities,
Ultimately it ceased to How. With
the recovery from the immediate ef
fccis of the operation, a most won
dm id change was observed in the
little patient. The head rapidly
?decreased m size. Soon the pa?
rents were overjoyed to discover
that the eye-sight had returned ;
the hi i ml child.lid once more see.
Then i's hearing was recovered,
and finally the paralysed condition
of lin- body gave way, and now,
with all its faculties re-toted, il has
developed lu.m a condition worse
than death into an exceptionally
bright ami winsome little cr?ature.
THE 01 HEB ?'ASF,
is still more remarkable from a pro?
fessional standpoint Mary Galla?
gher is the name of a young girl
who resides on Mala street. \Vh"li
about thirteen years of age she fell
from a lumber pile, and struck on
1 her hip in such an unfortunate
manner as to produce hip disease,
the disease causing a permanent
deformity, trom the destruction of
' the ?oint and union of the bones of
the thigh and hip at such an angle
that the fool could not be pat on
the ground. The limb was drawn
up, and ir was oul\ with the aid of
a pair of crotches that the girl wits
.. il around. She was taken
to the above named surgeon, ami a
remarkable operation was agreed
; upon. This was nothing inore DOC
less than the manufacture of an en
: tirely new joint to take the place
of the destroyed hip ?oint. The
muscles 'li?t ordinarily move the
thigh on the body are attached a: a
poinl some distance from the hip
joint. In this girl, owing to the
destruction of the joint and the
?p. cessation ot motion be
tween tho thigh ami the put above,
these muscles wen- greatly wasted,
Between the ?pot where the struc?
tures an- attached ami the destroy?
ed hip-joint, the bone was cut ami
separated : a sei ic- ol cbtsels w h
driven Into tin- bone from the back
of the thigh, s i iii.it the bone WSS
c impressed am! a"V" shaped space
-With the widest part of the Open?
ing diree'ed backward and outward
-?made in the substance of the
bones to auch ?in extent that when
the operation ??as completed ami
the bone cut through, the leg and
thigh could be Btraigbtened sud
, brought into Him with the body.
Two principal points kept in view
during the entire operation was to
preserve t he muscles and save the
covering ol the bone at theopening
which had been made. The limb
was straightens] out ami put m
splints, ami su arranged that it
could be moved daily at the point
a here the bom' was cut and Ireit
m nt was applied to tho withered
muscles ot the hip to stimulate
their vitality. The exercising of
the Inp prevented the bones from
nniting. The coveting of the bones
formed Strong Cords which hold it
in place, am! the result is one of
the wonders id' modern surgery.?
