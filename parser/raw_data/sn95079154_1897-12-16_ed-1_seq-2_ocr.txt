THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1897.
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE.
We do not publish the message of Presi?
dent McKinley to Congress at JJ^. present
seesion. It is too lengthy for the ordinary
weekly newspaper to produce in its col?
umns. It is a vigorous but conservative
address and is full of information as well
as purpose. A large portion of the mes?
sage is occupied in discussing the currency
question. Mr. McKinley handles that
question in an able, bold and convincing
manner. There is no doubt as to the po?
sition he occupies. He is decidedly favor?
able to a sound and safe currency and is
unmistakably on the side of sound mone?
tary reform.
The Cuban question is treated more
largely than any other in the message. His
presentation of our dealings with Spain is
done in admirable style, and shows that it
has been the purpose of the administra?
tion to secure relief for the suffering people
of Cuba without involving this country in
?war with Spain. In this policy the Presi?
dent has met with considerable success. By
the employment of moral forces he has
obtained from Spain moi"e important con?
cessions than have been granted since the
war began in Cuba. This has been accom?
plished without anythieat or effort to
bully Spain.
The President advises the ratification of
the treaty with Hawaii for annexing that
island to the United States, and on the
question of civil service he is in favor of
taking no steps backward.
Many other subjects are well aud fully
treated in the message. Upon the whole
the document is one which cannot be said
to be non-committal on any question it
discusses. It is a frank, bold paper and
yet a message of peace. It is for peace
and prosperity at home and peace and ar
bitratipirabroad.

IT ALL COMES FROM FRAUDULENT
ELECTIONS.
From the time the method of controlling
the machinery of government by debauch?
ing men with money and promises of of?
fice was first introduced, public morals
have been steadily declining in this State.
The great body of the people of Virginia
are perfectly well intentioned and honest.
Guileless themselves it never enters intr
their heads to suspect that any of theii
public men are dishonest The Times
found out, nearly four years ago, to its
amazement, that the public service in Vir?
ginia was falling into disrepute to ar
alarming degree, and it raised its voice ic
solemn warning to the people against what
it said was coming on them. Its warnings
were unheeded and its counsels were scoffed
at. But even the most incredulous are
now beginning to see that The Times was
justified in what it said and that something
must be done to arrest the couise of public
decadence, or Virginia will Eoon become
as badly debauched as some of her North?
ern sisters have become.
The effectual measure for cutting the
cancer out of the body politic is to bring
fraudulent elections to an end. That is
the fruitful source of all the corruption.
That is the njxious spring from which all
the poisoned waters flow. The man in of?
fice by fraudulent elections bends all his
energies to corrupt every thing, that he may
stay in office by fraudulent elections. That
is the point to be attacked.?Richmond
Times.
Here is an admission from a Democratic
PaP^4feat 'the public service in^Tfgifiia'i&
~ 'being debauched by the party in power.
Perhaps the party has found it necessary
" to resort to fraudulent elections to conceal
the dishonesty which The Times intimates
has been prevailing. If fraudulent elec?
tions were brought to an end it might re?
sult in bringing to fight the decadence that
exists in the public service in Virginia.
ALASKA AND HAWAII.
'.'hen Mr. Seward purchased Alaska for
Tnited States it was considered by
-vUiy persons a bad investment and wrong
olicy. No great time had elapsed until it
as demonstrated that the purchase was
ise in every way. Since the immense
old finds in that section the United States
would part with it more reluctantly, per?
haps, than any part of its territory. We
find the same kind of objections being
urged against the annexation of Hawaii
that were raised against the purchase of
Alaska. It is too remote, it is not con?
nected with any other territory of the
United States, its population is not of a
Mesix^ble chaiacter &c. If Hawaii is an
these objections will be brushed
ust as those against the acquisition
,ka were, after it became a part and
of the United States.
WOMAN'S RIGHTS RESPECTED.
In a recent trial at Stroudsburg, Penn.,
iss Edith Custard was jbl witness. An
'orney asked Miss Custard the usual
'stion: "What is your age?" She re
I, lI may be 30 for all you know. My
- nothing at all to do with the case,
'iiase to tell you."
, Albright, the trial judge, sustained
less, holding that the lady's answer
?ion was an appropriate one.
Who will now say that the cause of Wom?
an's Rights is not advancing?
EXPLANATION.
In our editorial column last week we
prematurely announced the Jeath of the
mother of President McKinley. We were
led into the error by seeing telegrams in
several of our exchanges telimg that she
had died. The Richmond Times and Roa
noke Times were also misled in the mat?
ter.
<?>
The newspaper head line, "Wages Re?
duced," stares us in the face quite often
nowadays during these piping times of Mc?
Kinley "prosperity."?Roanoke World.
For every time the World sees tbe head
line, "Wages Reduced," staring it in the
face it can see ten times the head line,
"Wages Advanced," smiling beautifully,
unless the World stubbornly turns its face
I away and refuses to look at the proclama?
tions of McKinley prosperity.
The corruption that has been brought
to light by the investigations of certain
charges against members of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, and those against
Hon. J. N. Stubbs, grand commander of
the Grand Camp of Wirginia, will do more
barm than would the continued use of the
school history that the original trouble be?
gan about.
A New York Magistrate has decided
that a bicycle is a necessity and not a lux?
ury. At this way of rating the necessitits
of life a family-man, will soon be unable to
supply his family with the necessaries.
There is some talk of another prize
fight taking place between Fitzsimmons
and Corbett. The sporting fraternity will
never be contented until a meeting takes
place.
->????
One of the strongest proofs that Mr.
McKinley's message is all right is the dis?
approval of the document by several of the
leading London newspapers.
Henry George, Jr., was married all right
notwithstanding there was a Hitch in the
programme.?Richmond Times.
And he is now hitched for life.

Dingley on Revenue.
Dnring the debate on the pension bill in
the House of Representatives last Friday
Mr. Sims, of Tennessee, expressed the
opinion that the Dingley law would not
supply sufficient revenue far the increas?
ing expenditures.
These remarks drew out Mr. Dingley's
statements regarding the prospective reve?
nues and expenditures for the coming fis?
cal year. Preliminary to :the statement,
Mr. Dingley gave a new interpretation of
the-estimated increase in pension expendi?
tures, contending that the maximum was
reached in 1S93, when the pension pay?
ments reached $159,000,000.
In 1S94 they fell to $141,000,000; 1S95,
$141,000,000; 1S96, $139,000,000, and in
1S97, $141,000,000. If the expenditures
for pensions during the next fiscal year
should be $140,000,000, as hac been esti?
mated, the increase, Mr. Dingley said,
would not be due to new legislation, but
to more rapid administration of the pres?
ent laws. It would, therefore, involve no
additional expense in the end.
The question as to the revenues and ex?
penditures for the next fiscal year, con?
tinued Mr. Dingley, was a practical one
which Congrees had to face. The state?
ment of the Secretary of the Treasury, he
said, had caused much misapprehension
owing to the fact that under a new pro?
vision of law he had been obliged to in?
clude in the estimates of expenditures
$73, 000.000 for public works which neither
he nor the Secretary of War, nor any
other well-informed person believed would
be expended. Cc unting this the estimated
deficit, he said, will be $21,000,000.
He said^he violated no confidence when
he said that the Secretary of the Treasury
and the President were confident that the
receipts next year would exceed the ex?
penditures.
Mr. Dingley said he took it for granted
that Congress would exercise reasonable
economy. It was not expected that the
expenditures for public works next year
would exceed $30,000,000. Continuing,
Bfo "Bihgiey I.P,imPxLout the.fjjct_that_the
actual cost of the administration of the
Government, the ordinary expenses per
capita, had remained about stationary for
many years. The cost was about $2.50
per capita.
At the present time the expenditures
were slightly in excess of ?5, but $2 per
capita went for pensions and about 50
cents for interest on the public debt. The
estimate of the Ways and Means commit?
tee had been that the tariff law, with other
receipts would bring in an income of 5 1-8
dollars per capita, and Mr Dingley de?
clared that when the expenditures were
brought within that limit there would be
no difficulty.
The estimated deficit for the present
year, not counting the money obtained
and to be obtained from tbe Pacific rail?
road, was $28,000,000. The anticipatory
importations had, Mr. Dingley] argued,
placed in the Treasury before July 1, $38,
000,000.
Those importations Lad reduced the de?
ficit last year from $56,000,000 to $18,000,
000, inasmuch as tbe importations were
for consumption this year, Mr. Dingley
contended that m equity that sum ehould
be properly charged to the receipts of the
current year. If they were so charged, in?
stead of a deficit, there would be a surplus
this year of $10,000,000.
figures out a surplus.
Mr. Dingley figured out a surplus of ex?
actly that amount ($10,000,000) for the com?
ing fiscal year. He described the steady
manner in which the revenues had been
increasing at the rate of one or two millions
a month. Although December was gener?
ally a bad month for importations, he said,
if the increase for the first nine days of
this month were continued the receipts
this month would increase from $25,000,
000 in November to $27,000,000 in Decem?
ber.
When he confidently predicted that the
effect of the anticipatory revenues would
all be overcome during this fiscal year,
and that after May or Jane, 1898, tbe
revenues would exceed the expenditures,
the Republican side broke into repeated
cheers.
When pressed by Mr. Richardson (Dem.,
Tenn.) for an opiniou as to the time when
the full effect ot the new scheudules would
be made manifest, Mr. Dingley replied
that the date must necessarily be proble?
matical, but for practical purposes, Iook
ing to the period when the revenues
would be ample, he unhesitatingly fixed
the end of this fiscal year.

Couplers and Air Brakes.
Philadelphia Prcss.l
The Interstate Commerce Commission
has gone to the extreme limit of a wise
discretion in extending for two years the
limit for equipping freight cars with auto?
matic couplers and air brakes. A far bet?
ter course would have been to make an ex*
tension for only one year. The demand
made by the roads for a five-year exten?
sion was preposterous. To grant it was
practically to nullify the act passed live
years ago.
No railroad can claim that it has not re?
ceived ample warning. It is now fifteen
years since it began to grow clear that
continuous brakes were inevitable for all
traius, and that the link and pin coupler
was not. only dangerous but wasteful.
Humanity can stand waste and business
can stand danger; but when both argu?
ments exists against anything reform is
certain. Ten years ago the Burlington
tests and the adoption of a standard cou?
pler settled the line of reform. From that
hour all delay was both inhuman and bad
business. It was the sort of economy
which saves at the spigot and loses at the
bunghole. Every line which delayed
making this change was not only losing its
own money by the delay but bring the
money of eveiy other line which handled
its cars.
Five years ago, when Congress acted
after debate extending through more than
one Congress, four States i had already re?
quired the reform. What for five yeare
was an improvement and lor five yea.'S
more an economy now became a necessity.
Yet in five years the railroads of the coun?
try have only put car couplers on 441 per
cent, of the cars and airbrakes on but 3GA
per cent. This share includes the big lines,
and the big lines only. They have com?
pleted their equipment. The lesser ones
have trusted to luck and the commission.
Unfortunately, as the freight cars of
each road go over all the other lines on
which it ships freight, the effect of the
equipment of the big lines is neutralized
by the lack of the lesser lines. The result
is mixed trains, with cars part automatic
coupler and part link and pin, part air?
brakes and part the old-fashioned brakes.
This is excessively dangerous, and the
death of 2000 men a year, with 20,000 in?
jured, tells how dangerous. For railroads
with a plain law on the statute book to
disregard its provisions, as over half have,
was a mistake both of principle and policy.
Capital asks much of the law and its pro?
tection. The very least the managers
and the owners of capital can do is to give
thejlaw implicit obedience.
The Interstate Commerce Commission
should make it perfectly clear that every
line two years hence will be held to a rigid
accountability.
"Blame William McKinley, Jr."
There is a sound and cheerful basis of
fact in Colonel W. F. Bend's humorous
reply to the firm that complained that he
was not furnishing coal as quickly as the
terms of his contract demanded. "Don't
blame me," said the Colonel; "I am do?
ing the best that I can. Blame William
McKinley, Jr. He promised us prosper?
ity, and he is giving such a lot of it that
the cars cannot carry it. Every freight
car is working over time, and I have to
take, not as many as I want, which I could
do at any time during Cleveland's admin?
istration, but a3 many as I can get by close
waiting upon every opportunity to capture
an empty cat."
Between wheat movement, coal move?
ment, iron movement, lumber movement,
and the shipment of agicultural machinery
the rolling stock of the roads is kept busy.
And there is no surer indication of pros?
perity than the movement of freight.
At least three-quarters of a million of
men who were idle a year ago are at work
to-day. The iron trade is phenomenally
brisk. The Illinois Steel Company, though
it is shipping 5,000 tons of finish ad pro?
ducts per day, is behind with its orders.
It is true most of the goods sent out are
upon contracts made at low prices, but tbe
wage rate is ample for comfortable exist?
ence, though, of course, lower than during
the wonderful year of 1892, in which many
thousands of misguided wage earners
"went in for swiping of the Tariff," and
i>y~SG-doiL>g.swiped themselves out of work.
The tide of prosperity 'has hoi yet
reached the cotton and woolen industry,
or at any rate has not yet come near the
high water mark. But the great stocks of
imported goods are diminishing steadily,
and when they are depleted to normal
conditions the textile trades will be as
busy as the iron and steel trades.?Chi?
