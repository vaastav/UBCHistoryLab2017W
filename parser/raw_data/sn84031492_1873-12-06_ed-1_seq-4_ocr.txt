Saturday Morning, December 0, 1873.
Representative Sheridan, of Louisiana, made
a reply yesterday to Sir. Cox’s charge, that tho
certificate of election presented by hia col
league, Mr. Smith, had boon got up in Wash
ington. Ho assured tho House that tho returns
from the district in question, tho Fourth
Louisiana, wero properly chuvassod. Tbo elec
tion was held ou the 21tU ult., and, ns no part,
of tho district was more than three days’ distant
from Now Orleans, there was plenty of (imo to
canvass the vote by tho 29th, tho day on which
the certificate .was dated.
Tho woll-raoaut device of the Pennsylvania
Constitutional Convention for giving Philadel
phia a fair election has miscarried. Tho election
commission appointed by tbo Convention has
been unanimously decided by tho Supremo Court
to bo in coullict with tho Stato laws, which tbo
Convention had no authority to override. As
tho Court expresses it, none of tho existing
branches of tho Government aro affected by a
Constitution that is not adopted. Tho Court
grant the injunction prayed against tbo Commis
sioners, and tbo ring are properly jubilant that
the law is on their sido.
Speaker Blaluo announced tbo standing com
mittees of the House of Ilopresoutatives yester
day. Messrs. Dawes, Garfield, Scofield, aud
Kelley are reappointed to their old positions.
The Committee of Ways and Means is apparently.
“ low tariff.” At all events, it is not made up in
accordance with Pennsylvania ideas on that sub
ject. Mr. Burcbard, of Illinois, retains his place
on this Committee, and Mr. Hasson, of lowa, is
added to it, while Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee,
has been “ rotated ” to tbo Chairmanship of tbo
Committee on Banking and Currency. Wo re
gret to see that the Speaker put Fernando Wood
on it at last. Mr. Orth, of Indiana, is made
Chairman of Foreign Affairs, and Gen. Butler of
tbo Judiciary.
Tho report of Captain-General Jovellar’s resig
nation Is denied this morning, but without any
authority that entities the contradiction to
any more weight than tho original statement.
Tho sudden outburst of warlike nows from Cuba
day before yesterday is followed by a great calm.
No favor is shown in Washington to tho proposi
tion that tho Virginius bo intrusted to somo
neutral party till tho international questions in
volved iu her capture bo settled. There is no
excitement among the members of tho Govern
ment, and no disposition to giant Spain any
formal extension of the timo for surrender, while
the Castelar Government will, in effect, bo al
lowed to take a little longer timo than agreed
upon if necessary to carry out Us agreement
without danger to itself.
The President has communicated to Congress
a letter from Buenaventura Baez, claiming to bo
President of the Republic of Sau Domingo, ask
ing that tho American Government take tho Re
public under its protection. Ho recites a long
and piteous story of tho woes of 6an Domingo,
•' tho world discovered by Columbus.” Ho claims
that San Domingo has boon greatly injured,—
first, by tho refusal of tbo United States to an
nex that Republic, and second, by tbo great
noise made over the Samaua Bay Company’s
purchase, aud tho subsequent failure of that
Compauy. Under theso circumstances, tho in
surrectionists aro again disturbing tbo pubilo
tranquillity, and bo charges that they are secretly
aided by tbo Government of Hayti, which aims
to aocuro the possession of tho whole island and
turn Mr. Baez out of his situation. Ho would
liko to have tho United States make war upon
Hayti, aud disburse a little mouoy through him
in San Domingo, whoro business is very dull,
and no prospect of getting bettor. This la truly
a barrowing state of affairs. * Bettor send Bab
cock down there again.
It has probably occurred to some people that
the Cubans may escape tho humiliatio.i of a sur
render of tho Virginias by an “ aocldoutal n or, at
all oventß, an irresponsible burning or dcetructlou
of tho vessel. Such au ovout would not bo alto
gether without a prccodout. During tho War of
cho Rebellion, tho Florida, a Rebel ship, waa
captured iu tho port of Bolivia, Brazil. in tho
most unceremonious and unlawful manner. Tho
surrender of tho Florida to tho Government of
Brazil was afterward* adjudged, amUhero was a
good deal of feeling against it. particularly
among tho navy men. Tho Florida was anchored
off Fortress Monroe in the middle of tho chan
nel. and won one night run down and sunk.
This accident spared the American Gov
ernment the assumed humiliation of surren
dering tho ship to Brazil. ’A similar accident
to tho Virginias would not, however, d'spoeo of
tho controversy that arises from her case. In
fact, it might bo of advantage in saving the
American Government the embarrassment of
prosecuting her in case it shall ho proved that
she was engaged in »u unlawful business. But
tho other conditions of the proctocoi would
remain to bo compiled with, and they aio of a
character that cannot ho disposed of in au acci
dental way. Tho survivors of tho Virginias crow
must bo surrendered, for ono thing, and harm to
them will not bo regarded as tho aot of irrespon
sible persons. Tho Government of Spam has
likewise pledged Itself to prosecute tho ollloiuls
who hurriedly ordered tho execution of tho Vir
ginias people. A failure to do this will ho as
much ii broach of f&ith aa tbo refusal to stir*'
render tbo Virginias would bo. Tbo accidental
destruction of IhoVirghnis would not, therefore,
help either Spain or the Cubans out of the
diflSculty.

CUBAN RE3I3TAKCB.
At tho lime tho Spanish Government formally
conceded tho demands of tho United States,
there was an apprehension in tho minds of those
acquainted with the condition of ufi.ura in Cuba
that tbo Homo Government would not bo aide
to enforce the terms of the protocol. Tho tonus,
ou tho part of Spain, are: Tho surrender of tho
Virginias; a salute to tho American Hag; tho
delivery of tho survivors of tbo craw; and tho
prosecution of tho official* responsible (or tho
hasty executions. If tho reported resignation
of Cnptalu-Goucrul Jovollar, on tho ground that
ho has not tho power to enforce these conditions
against tho sentiment of tho island, ho true,
there is a now complication in the cane, which
is much more likely to load to difficulties than
was tho capture of tho Yirginlus, Tho ques
tion is whether Spam unit, or whether she
can, enforce tbo stipulations of tbo protocol.
The United States Government cannot
now roccdo from its demands, tho justice of
which has boon acknowledged by Spain. lu
fact, before approving tho terms of tho protocol,
Spain consulted the loading Powers of Europe,
aud it was agreed that they wore fair aud just.
Spain is, therefore, committed to tbo oottlomeut
of tho affair ou this basis, and cannot recede
without giving tho United States a casus belli.
Tho first exigency to bo considered L tho pos
sible inability of Spain, oven iu case of willing
ness, to compel tbo Cubans to comply with tho
protocol. It is some years sinco tho Homo Gov
ernment has exorcised undisputed authority iu
Cuba. What is kuowu as the Peninsular party,
which consists of native Spaniards and the
wealthy Creole planters, and which controls the
Volunteers, has always professed tbo most in
tense loyalty to Spain, but bas at the name time
put its own construction upon Spanish laws in
their application to Cuban Government, and ex
orcised a quasi independent dominion over tho
island. Tho utter defiance of tho Horot Eraanoi*
patiou law in Cuba is an instance of this. The
pro-slavery aristocracy of Cuba,'moreover, have
never bad any sympathy with Republicanism in
Spain, and are more likely to resist tho present
Government on that account. They also have
an abiding and ignorant faith in tho invincible
pride, valor, and power of tbo Spauisb people
strong traditions of tho timo of Charles V. and
tho Spanish Armada—and oro confident in their
ability to resist the whole world in tbo defense
of what they conceive to bo thbir honor. Tho
prevalence of this sentiment among the Cuban
aristocracy is sufficiently attested by the bom
bastic proumiciauiuutos that uro issued on all
possible pretexts. Either with tho hope that
they will bo sustained by tho Spauish pooplo, or
iu open defiance of consequences, it is not un
likely that tho blind pride and vain pomp
of tho Cuban aristocracy, encouraged by tho
dare-devil instincts of tho Volunteers, may in
duce tho ruling party to resist the Homo Gov
ernment. And, iu such caso, Spain, unstable in
Government aud harassed by civil war, may bo
• powerless to carry out wbat oho has undertaken.
In such an event, tbo Cuban patriots will not bo
tho ouly rebels iu Cuba. Tho ofiluial party will
.likewise bo iu rebellion. Tho United States
Government may then proffer Spain assistance
in enforcing demands in which wo aro interest
ed, or it may treat tho inhabitants of Cuba as
outlaws or pirates, and proceed against them as
a people who acknowledge no Government, and
from whom no satisfaction can bo obtained.
But iu case Cuba makes tbo threatened ro
distance to tho surrender of tho Virgin!-
ua and the survivors of her crow, ib la more
than likely that she will have tbo active sympa
thy of tho Spanish pooplo. Tho Spanish attach
ment for Cuba is intense, oven to the point of
idolatry. Cuba was ouo of the first of tho Span
ish possessions iu tho West Indies, and it iu (lie
last—or tbo last of any consequence. Senti
ment is strengthened by interest, and tho Span
ish people have sustained sluveooruoy mid borne
with Cuban defiance in order to keep the reve
nue the island yields them. Cuban resistance
may, therefore, moan tho overthrow of tho Cas
tolar Government, whoso (enure of power is very
frail at the best. The priesthood opposes tho
now Republic uncompromisingly, and will gladly
avail itself of tho opportunity afforded by Cuban
resistance. Tho navy has been rebellious over
since it started the revolution which resulted in
tho overthrow of Isabella, Tho Carlists, Xntrau
sigeutou, and Bourbons will unite ou anything
to subvert tho existing Government. The
dealings wo havo had so far have boon with tho
Castelar Government, and tiio overthrow of tho
Castolur Government will moan the disapproval
of its concessions by (ho Spanish pooplo. lu
that event, a war with Spain would bo well nigh
inevitable. The . point of attack will still bo
Cuba, but tbo conquest of Cuba will not neces
sarily cud tho war. If such u war comos, ic will
ho a prolonged and stubborn straggle. But it
will have been forced upon the United States,
and tho final result will bo tho “ cleaning out*
of Spuuish rule ou this side of tho Atlantic, and
the overthrow of the slaveholdlug aristocracy of
Cuba.
The appointment of a Select Committee for
tho consideration of. the repeal of tho salary
grab was a measure adopted by the House of
Representatives in self-defense. Ah was antici
pated, there has boon a perfect scramble for tho
credit of introducing tho repealing bill. It be
came necessary to provide a reference com
mittee us tho only moaus of dlspodug of this
mass of virtuous literature. While all this
would seem, at first blush, to bo in deference to
THE CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: SATURDAY, DECEMBER G, 1873.
tbo sentiment of tbo people on tbo salary quos
tion, an examination of tbo various bills reveals
an utter contempt for the intelligence of the
people, slnco they show a conllUonco that a
modification of Uio Injury will pass muster as a
full confession and recantation. Nobody under
takes to disturb the President in the enjoyment
of his increase, though this was the starting
point and the incentive throughout. If tboSpcclal
Committee desire to do so, they can very speed
ily dispose of tho whole subject by bringing In
a bill absolutely repealing the Increase made at
the last session, and providiug for tbo reduction
from future pay of tbo excess already paid over
on tho present basis. If a short, plain, and
unambiguous bill of this character wore Intro
duced by tbo Committee, wo do not believe that
Congress would daro defy pubilo opinion by re
jecting it. ■
ANOTHER STEAM-DRUM BURST.
The letter of Col. Fitoh, relative to tbo In
human conduct of Capt. Fry, tbo command
er of tbo Vlrgiuius, in shooting bolploss and
scalded men struggling in tbo water for their
lives, was tbo only thing needed to oomplolo tbo
humiliation of tbo Chicago Times, During tbo
War, the sympathies of tbo Times wero with tbo
men who fought on tbo sumo sido with Capt.
Fry, and it aided them to tbo extent of its
ability in their attempt to overthrow tbo Qov
ommout. Binco that time, its sympathies have
always boon on the side of buccaneers, free
booters, and pirates. It has boon a public enemy
so long itself that it has no sympathy with any
ouo who cannot show that ho la a filibuster, or,
ut least, a common blackguard. When Itwas as
sorted that Capt. Fry bad boon guilty of
inhuman conduct, and therefore was not a fit
subject for sympathy when a liko fato overtook
him, tbo Times nt onco recognized a congenial
spirit, who bad boon engaged in attacking help
less people! Accordingly it rushed to bis de
fense ; denied tiiatbo bad done anything wrong;
eulogized him as n man whoso heart was in tbo
right place; blackguarded every oue who
thought differently; employed irresponsible
people to write up Fry as a good Rebel; and, day
after day, poured out a torrent of indecent
abuso upon every ouo who did not admit that this
murderer of helpless mou, this “.man without
a country,” was a first-class patriot, whoso death
must ho avenged by the United States Govern
ment under whoso flag ho was soiling when
captured.
In tho absence of any official statement rela
tive to (ho brutal affair at Fort St. Charles. the
Times waxed more indecent day by day, and also
found n staunch ally in tho St. Louis Olobe, one
of whoso attaches, who has beau kicked about
from one paper to another like a football for
years past, had seen several octlous during tho
War from tho coal-holes of gunboats. Tho two
papers ut lost grow so noisy and vociferous that
Col. Fitcb, of Indiana, tho man who captured
Fry at Fort St. Charles, was compelled to inter
fere. How satisfactorily ho did so, tbo public
knows. Ho fired but ono shot, and that
exploded their steam-drums and scalded
tho whole crow, aud since that time
they haven’t opened their mouths. It
may bo possible, however, that they are only
resting from the attack to find out whether Col.
Fitch Is a dangerous man. If they can satisfy
themselves that ho is not, we may expect to bo
informed in a fow days that Col. Fitoh poisoned
bis grandmother, and that during tho War he
amused himself by braining Confederate babies
before tbo eyes of their mothers, and that slnco
tbo War bo has beau guilty of forgery, arson, and
horse-stealing. If they find, however, thatho can
hit back, they will probably lot him alone. At all
events, tho Times has bed nil it wants of the Fry
matter.
LAWYERS IN THE SENATE.
Tho recent death of John I*. Halo revives the
fact that his service in tho Senate won brought
to a close by an act on his part which ' only
eight yearn ago wan regarded as discreditable,
but which, iu the light of tho present experi
ences, scorns very trivial. During tho War,
some person iu tho Quartermaster's Department
was arrested by tho military authorities for
swindling tho Government, and imprisoned at
Portrooß Monroe. Through his friends ho of
fered Sir. Halo SI,OOO to procure bib release.
Mr. Hole labored with Mr. Stanton aud tho
President until bo obtained tho discharge of tho
prisoner. Subsequently, tho matter got out;
Mr. Halo frankly stated tho foots, claiming to
havo been retained as counsel for tho man iu
prison. Upon investigation, it was discovered
that Ilalo’s conduct was not illegal; but so
greatly was the Senate scandalized that a law
was at once passed prohibiting any member of
either House of Congress from practicing as an
attorney for biro before any of the Departments
of the Government in any suit or claim against
tho United States. Tho scandal of this case de
feated Mr. Halo's re-election to tho Senate, and
ho sought escape from publio curiosity by solic
iting and obtaining an appointment as Minister
to Spain.
Now, .however proper this treatment of Mr.
Xlulo may have been, nud however much needed
tho law that prohibits members of Congress
practicing os attorneys before tho Departments,
;Is not all this comparatively trivial when wo
consider tho frequency with which Senators are
retained as counsel by groat corporations which
have dealings with Congress or are liable to
havo ? Take, for instance, (ho Central Pacific
lluilroad Company. How many Senators are
there who have been retained us counsel for that
Company, at foes amounting, perhaps, to $20,000
a year each? It is tine they are retained as at
torneys, to attend to business before tho courts;
that is tho business for which they are nominally
paid. Hut in tbo Hale case, while tho SI,OOO
was theoretically paid to him as counsel, tho
country considered that it was tho Senator aud
not tho lawyer who had been retained.
If this wore true in that isolated case, what
shall wo think of the fact that eminent lawyers
in tho Senate are tho hired attorneys of corpora
tions which have more or less business to
transact with tho Government ? They are not
hired nor paid to legislate for tho railroads ;
but they are tho hired and paid attorneys for tho
corporations, and it is a question of which tho
country will form its own opinions whether it
is tho Senators or tho lawyers who aro in fact
employed. It is no reflection upon Senators to
say (hat thoro is as eminent legal ability out of
that body as thoro is Iu it. Why, then, should
lawyers elected to tho Senate, never previously
thought of by those corporations, bo sought out
and paid largo foes, nominally for attending to
business iu tho courts ? Tho fact Is, tho Senate
stands before tbo country under tho ropre&ch of
being in tbo control of-those of its members
who are the retained counsel of tho great corpo
rations. Those corporations possess and claim
special privileges, among which may bo men
tioned the privilege of not paying what they owe
to tbo Government. They are monopolies at
war with tbo public. Can a Senator pocket a
foe of SIO,OOO from ono of those corporations,
and still bo qualified to vote without bias on any
question affecting tho company ? No Court
would allow a conductor or brakoman to sit ns
a juror or act as arbitrator iu any case whore
tho company that nmploj’H him was interested.
.Tho Senate Is filling up with railroad attorneys,
aud those railroad attorneys aro charged with
tbo duty of legislating ns between tbo
opposing interests of tbo people and
thouo grasping corporations. Wo aro
speaking of notorious facts; Tho foes
paid by theso corporations to attorneys
who are at tbo same time Senators aro enor
mous, aud far exceed those paid to members of
tho Bar who aro not Senators for liko services.
An election to tho Senate is now regarded as the
admission to a large railroad practice, aud tho
country that was scandalized by tbo potty case
of Mr. Halo is compelled to look on aud witness
these corporation attorneys framing tbo nation
al legislation. Tho law passed in Mr. Halo’s
caso should bo enlarged. Senators cannot take
pay from both sides. If they represent tho
country, they must cease to bo attorneys. They
cannot represent both country and clients. If
iboy must practice their professions, lot them
leave the Senate, aud no longer insult tbo intel
ligence aud honesty of tho pooplo by having
clients on both sides of tho case.
THE GREAT SNIVELING ASSOCIATION.
The Boston Journal of Commerce, which has
not boon noted as an organ of “ British free
trade,” comments on tho recent action of the
American Iron and Stool Association, demanding
an increase of tho duties ou Iron and stool, in
this wise •
This Association lias a national reputation for Its
luttguanlmou* impudauoc, which would have the iron
r.utl utcct intercuts of I'ctiUßylvania supported by tho
whole of tho country, at thu coat of id). Thetu gout!?,
muu must huvo forgotten that American iron huu bceu
exported to England recently, r.ud that tho imports of
iroa from Liverpool have ut tho tamo timo largely dc
crcanud, so a:< to alarm tho Loudon Timis aud other
prmn'nenl English Journal*. Wo rather suspect that
tho iVmtsyh'imfu monopolist.? know all this just an well
as tho rest of tho commercial and industrial world, and
they saw in tho near future a demand for n further re
duction In tho taritf which they planned to oltsct by a
wail and a whine from their sido of tho house.
Tho Boston paper has hit tho nail ou tho head.
The Iron and Stool Association saw clearly
enough that tboy would soon bo ashed to relax
their grip on tho jugular vein of American iu
dustrr. So they called a grand Sniveling Con
vention and recited their woes to Congress,
showing how they had shut up shop and dis
charged their bauds (under tho auspices of a
high protective tariff), and how* tboy must have
somo more tariff, or they could never start up
again. What a spectacle for a proud pooplo I
Horo is a branch of industry started half a cen
tury before tbo Revolutionary War, pos
sessing really uuoqualcd natural advan
tages, and protected not merely by
8,000 miles of ocean transportation but
by expensive inland transportation as well,
whoso chief mou come before Congress every
year m tbo capacity of mondicauts, asking to be
supported at tbo public expense. There is a
timo coming when tho great Sniveling Associa
tion will bo sout about its business, aud people
will be allowed to buy iron and stool for what
tboy aro worth. When that time comes, they
will continuo to buy of the American iron and
steel manufacturers, but tl.ioy will pay only such
prices as aro established by tbo law of supply
and demand, with tbo law of Congress loft out.
THE MONITOR MANHATTAN.
PmnADKLriiiA, Doc. 4.—-Tho monitor Manhattan
has boon pronounced utterly uuflt for service iu her
presout condition.
Philadelphia, Dec. 4.— A apodal from Wilmington
says tho moultor Manhattan is expected to sail for Key
West to-iuorvovr.
Tho foregoing brief dispatches have probably
received little attention except from those hav
ing friends on board, yet tbo condition of affairs
which they represent might well bo noticed by
tho wbolo country,''.ail'd*, a protest issued before
another sweeping disaster at sea sends mourn
ing into several hundred homos. Tho Manhattan
has boon shown to bo mauifeutly unsafe. In
tho accounts of her first attempt to proceed to
Key West, enough wns said to show, ovou to tho
veriest lund-lubbor, that her loss might have
been expected at nuy moment, ovou during a
comparatively moderate gale. In ouo of tho
heavy cyclones that provnil between Cape Hat
teras aud Florida Straits, the Manhattan, oral
most uuy other monitor in tho presout condi
tion of unHoaworlhinoss to which they have all
been reduced, would uudoublcdly go to the bot
tom with her wbolo orow, and then tho country
would begin to question tbo necessity and the
policy which sout 2CO men to sea in a coffin. It
is timo that somo restraining influence should
bo put upon; Mr. Robeson before ho exhausts
bis whole year's appropriation, aud drowns half
tho navy. *
’ The Springfield (Muss.) Jlepublican, which has
recently been sued for libel by Willis Phelps, a
prominent railroad builder, for charging him
with interfering with municipal nominations iu
that oily iu order to got an appropriation lor a
railroad iu which ho was interested, scorns very
much pleased with the prospect, and says:
It 1b tiro only libel suit ever offered to it that involved
the highest principles of journalism, und tho only ouo
tbut it was a real objoct to tbo profession aud tbo pub
lic to buvo tried. Tbo iesuo iu a clear, n broad ouo S
there can hardly bo any dluputo about tho facts ou
cither sido; tbo (iucullou is, Was tbo Jteimbltcan Justi

deuouuciug tbo man rcspouoible for them, iu tbo de
cided aud harsh language that it used 7 Wo trust the •
trial wilt bo speody. Wo promise that It shall bo
thorough.'‘
As Mr. Bowles is a gentleman who always
fulfills bis promises, wo may anticipate’ a very
lively wrestle between himself and Mr. Phelps
when tho caso comes to trial.
Tho Now York Evening Post, which is nothing
if not critical, is out iu a vigorous protest
against tho report of tho Secretary of tho Navy,
because ho uses tho word •* eventuality," in re
lation to tho forthcoming observations of tho
transit of Venus, and, whou speaking of the pro
posal to dig a canal across the Isthmus of
Panama, says, “ Tho westerly trend of tho coast
made tho area that would havo to bo canalized
broader iu extent." Tho use of those words is
barbarous enough, and wo hopo thoro is no ouo
but a Boorotary of tho Navy who would bo guilty
of using them 5 but wo suggest that, if tho Gov
ernment officials do nothing worso than tho cor
ruption of tho English language, they be lot
alono. If they will ouly keep their Departments
clean and free from suspicion, lot thorn murder
all the Euglish words they please.
Monholiu, (be murderer iu Jersey City, N. J.i
whose execution has beou postponed for a short
time, has a very decided antipathy for spiritual
consolation. Last Sunday, ho was called upon
by a clergyman, and, as soou us he announced his
errand of salvation, tho prisoner furiously re
plied! “You waut to convert mo; you a dam
fool 1 you got yourself drunk t 1 no want use you
boro; I got no soul; you ro leave mo lono, or
you got murdered," Tbo niofluoiigor of peace do
partod. *lt is needless to odd that tbo boaror of
good tidingo stayed not upon tbo order of bis
going, but wont at once; and that there have

NOTES AND OPINION.
At (ho Republican caucus last night (hero wan a
long tUrciif-Hlon upon tho subject of tbo Biliary bill,
which bh« brought eo much dlndlcdit upon tho Re
publican party during (ho Inst six mouths, ullcmuod ho
umuy frlcmiH ami mtppertoni of tho party, cud, lu a
gr<?ul measure, brought upon It no many dut'uuls In tho
fall ulcctlous. . . . Tho country ItuigaiiiHllt; tho
prcKJ ia against It; every taxpayer Is ng.uunt U; every
liinguiHhiug Industry Is against U ; the merchant, tho

11. The pnutago of tho bill wuc >\ bluudor for which
Ibo party has Hiig trcd dearly, la this matter th. ro
should ho no faUo prido, The representatives of the
people know that the people. repudiate their action;
that In keeping this law upon (ho atululo books they
ate not sustained' by their con-Ultueuts, Congress
should have no policy to enforce their will.
1110 l tho whole thlug out at once, Tuo safety of tho
Republican party di.uumls it.
Tbo foregoing from tho Washington Repub
lican. tbo Administration organ, is a nmch more
frank acknowledgment of tbo responsibility of
tbo majority in Congress for tho salary-grub
than lias bitheito been made by tbo Administra
tion prosu. Just at present tbo pariy organs
aro frantically cmloavoim/f to show that tho
Democrats woro tho responsible members, mid
clto tbo action of tbo Democratic] caucus as proof
thereof. That thoio were Democratic thieves in
tho laut Congress to aid tbo Republican thieves
(boro is no doubt; but it is folly to acctiEO a
minority of pausing any bill. A patty having
tbo majority tiiat tbo Republicans possessed
could buvo, and should have, put a stop to auy
such a thieving operation. It is also significant
that tbo repeal of tho law is urged, not because
it was wrong, but because “ tbo safety of tbo
Ropublieau party demands it."
—Tbo Atlanta (III.) Arqus favors tbo project
of establishing a mint at Chicago. It says :
Why should hundreds of thoiunndo of dollars be
umiuudy thrown away in transporting tlio oro uml tho
bullion to tho East, imd to Europe, to bo smelled nml
coined, instead of carrying on tho processes In this
country, ami la that portion of it, too, where tho .ores
oro produced. ‘Within tho range of tho railroad and
water connections of Chicago, from sixty to seventy
millions of dollars' worth of gold uud silver uro an
nually produced, and now mines aro constantly being
discovered. Let us have tho mint In Chicago, by all
means, and one of at least sulhclcnt capacity to coin
tho hudiou which could bu produced at Its very doors.
—ln regard to tbo matter of tho panic, and of

just as much “at sea” as tho rest of no. Ho

suggests several things not easily reconcilable
with each other.— Bloomington (III.) Paufa
grapti,
—lt is tho popular idea that tho Chief Execu

umpires ” portions of It, ho has done as much
as cun reasonably bo expected of him. In tho
present instance, however, wo imagine we de

—Tho nomination of Alexander It. Shepard to

to tho salary-grab in his mossago is because ho
could not consistently ask Congressmen to dis

—Tho President suggests two amendments to
tho Constitution, both of which wo hope will bo
seriously considered. Ono is time the Execu
tive bo empowered to veto any portion of a bill,
such vote not affecting other portions which ho
may approve. It is fair to presume that, if tho

power, bo would have vetoed tho back-pay

Railroad, of tho outrage upon myself, which oc
curred on tho lilid ult.; and, farther, for tho
reason that hid Blatomouls contained m said re
port nro strangely ub variance with Uio truth of
tho mutter, 1 ask that you will do mo tho justice
to publish tho nubjohmd, which I declare to ho
a fair and equitable history of the coiiLrovoray.
I look the fii-10 p. in, train from Springilold for
St Louis, on tho evening in question. When
called upon by tho Conductor, in making bin
round, 1 looked hastily through mi envelope con
tainingbo.no Imif-a-dozon or bo of railroad passes,
besides bmmiObß curds, and other uurds contain
ing memoranda, ole. 1 do contoss Umt 1 uuy
have delayed Mr. LnthauV business to this ox
tont, that not readily finding tho “ legislative
ticket" of tho Chicago A Alton Railroad, 1 «ug
gouted that ho null upon mo again in a few mo
ment!), Tins ho assented to, uud after cay G
minutes, ho returned to my Boat, when I pre
sented luo “paHa" inquebtiou.
After looking at the document for a fow mo
menta Mr. L. returned the uatno to my hand,
with tho (mooting remark that “that thing wuh
about played out," or' words to that effect. I
asked him if my pans or “ loglslativo ticket" wan
nut in dato ; and, further, whether ho hod re
ceived orders countermanding such posses. Ho
gave mo no reply to those inlorrogatories save
tho simple, “ Where do you want to go ?V And
when 1 replied, “£’o Bust St. Louis," Hr.
L. said, “If you havo no other ticket than
tins, or nothing clho to show, you must pay
faro or bo put off tho train and at this
moment bo called upon two sturdy brakotnoa to
do his bidding. 1 suggested payment of faro to
next station, for 1 disliked to bo puc off in tho
woods or ou tho prairie ; it was dork and rain
ing. No heed was paid to this whatever, and,
ponding our further parley, tho whistle sounded
for Chatham Station, where this gentlemanly
conductor, us bo would bavo tho public beliovo,
with the help of two stalwart and extremely
boalthy-loukiug brakomou. dumped mo forcibly
from uio cur, which I think a remarkable feat
for throe men, considering my avoirdupois
weight is just 122 pounds.
At Chatham Station I bought a return ticket to
Springfield, armed with which I took tho Chica
go-bound train, tay one hour or so later in tho
night. When the conductor (1 wish 1 could re
member his name) came to mo for faro, I, for
piudcntial reasons, withhold tho ticket I bought
at Chatham, and presented tho identical “ legis
lative ticket" upontohich I had xcilhin Uco hours
previous been forcibly ejected from another train
for jn'csentinq to Mr. Lathan; and tho conduc
tor ou tho up-bound taaiu, after a look at its
contents, returned tho name to my hand with an
ailirmstivo nod, and tho simple question,
“Whero do you desiro to go?" I re
plied “to Springfield," uud ho passed upon his
round. Whon ejected from tho train 1 Logged to
bo allowed to got my baggago, but this was
refused mo, and to this day I have never receiv
ed it, nor havo 1 any knowledge of its where
abouts, and doapito Mr. Latbau’s assertion to
your reporter “ that ho oout it to mo," Ido.not
boliovo it, and tho baggago is either now in his
posucssion or in the hands of somo other rogue
not entitled to the property. As to this man’s
charge of my being drunk, I simply douy it in
toto. Tho distance, I boliovo, from Springilold
to Chatham is ton miles or thereabouts. Tho
train 1 judged to bo running at a speed
of twonty-ttvo or thirty mlloo an hour,
At this rato tho train could not
havo been far from twenty minutes out
from Springilold whon 1 was ejected. Now, I
am abundantly able to provo that £ loft Spring-
Held entirely compos mentis, and 1 further de
clare I had no liquor, either viuuous or spiritu
ous, In my possession, so I loavo tho public to
dolormluo as to the facts of his con
jecture. To mo his statomoub smacks of the
falsehood I know it to bo, and I incline to the
boliof that Mr. Lathan made it to your reporter
for tho purpose of “covering accidents," or olso
ho knows how quick somo men can got drunk,
so 1 give him tho benefit of tho doubt. for
judging from‘bis ungenerous treatment, if ho
will calculate time and distance in my favor. I
tako it that ho speaks from personal experience!
Finally, tho pans 1 hold, denominated by its
title “Loglslativo ticket," camo into my pos
session through tho Hon. Daniel Shophard,
Clerk Illinois House of Keprosontativos, hon
estly, and 1 regard that by the tonus thereof it
was justly my right to use tho samo in a legiti
mate way. 1 surely had no desiro to impose
upon tbo Company who granted tho pass to mo,
and however Mr. Lathan regarded tho matter I
care not; but this Ido know and will provo—
his brother conductor honored the pass ou tho
samo dato ho ejected mo forcibly from hiulrain.
and thereby his brother conductor acknowledged
by hie olllcial act ray righto thereunder, and ac
corded the samo to mo, as doubtless hig souso
of duty prompted him to do. Very respectfully,

Competitive trials of heavy ordnance recently
took place upon tho obscure territory of Nut
Island, iu Boston Harbor. Tho experiments
wore such as to dorricustratothat all the smooth
boro guns on band and belonging to tho Gov
ernment can bo increased in precision and power
to an extent which will enable them to hit and
destroy, with a single shot, any iron-clad or
other war vessel that overheated. r lho experi
ments took place under tho observation of
Capt. Trnxton, Captain of Ordnance of tbo
Navy Department, and under tbo supervision
of Norman Ward, agent of tho Depart
ment and inventor of tho rilling improvement,
winch adds such remarkable force and efficiency
to tho heavy armament of our forts and ships
of-war. For tho purposes of tho experimental
lost there wore provided two gunsof twenty-three
tons each and of 15-inoh calibfo, Ono of them
was the common smooth-bore and cue other was
rilled iu accordance with Mr. Ward's invention,
but iu otbor respects thoro was no dilVorouco
whatever. Ono hundred and forty pounds of
powder—tho largest quantity of ammunition
over used in a gun—was bred from oach, and tho
projectiles wero respectively of dliO pounds
weight. Tho targets consisted of wromdit
irou platoj of flfloau inches in thick
ness, and they wero erected side by
side, 150 foot distant. The vlllod pro
jectile hred from tho Wiard gun was of conical
stupe, and tho ono luod from the common
Binooth-boro pieco was necessarily round. Tho
ono hint named wont clear through tho 15-iuch
plates, and out of night into a saml-hank in tho
roar. The demolition of tho almost invulnornblo
target was complete, and so groat was tho foroo
wiu which U. was struck that a fragment of tldl)
or 4(JO pounds was thrown clear across tho island,
a dictuuco of not loss than a quavtor of a mile.
Tho projectile from tho smooth-horo gun pene
trated tho taigot only about !))■£ inches, and, as
the advantages wero precisely mnia),
liority oflho tilled amt was at once establish od
by tho experiment, and admitted by tho Govern
ment authorities of observation. Compared with
other comparative tests, this stylo of gun is the
moat destructive over yet produced. A 35-tou
gun of 12-inch calibre, was once llred In England
through an iron plate of 12 inches in thickness,
showing tho comparative penetrating power of
that arm to bo about 111 against 325 of tho gun
at Nut Island. This improvement, as tho Gov
ernment understands it, docs not involve tho.
manufacture! of now gnus to secure it. Taho
tho present armament of our forts, just as they
are, and they can he rilled nt ono-tonth tho cost
that now guns can bo manufactured, and at tho
samo time tholv efficiency as smooth-bore ord
nance is not in tbo least Impaired; and, includ
ing the oust of rilling, tho arum will bo cheaper
by ono-tonth than tho best English guns, and
for destructive powers their efficiency can hard
ly over bo equaled.

From the Xtw York Vriounc t Dee. 1.
Wo saw primed yesterday, for tbo tlret tlmo
in any roputablb journal, Uvo ioLtora iu relation
to Honator Carpenter'a adventure at n lusliiun
nblo Lun;' Lrancli liotol last summer. Tiiov arc
both addressed to Senator Howo. One is from
President Grant, and Is in tho following
words:
Executive Mansion, )
Washington, I). 0., Oct. 2D, 1b73.f
Deau Judge: .M licit hau been iulcl in the ]mi>Ue
prints rotative to your colleague, Senator 'Carpenter,
during his vltlt to Long Brunch this lust summer.
One charge nmilu cguimu him I huow to be untrue,
lie spent i.u hoar or more with mo during the evening
of Ins stay, and I can answer to his being ut the time
strictly sober, giving no evidence of having been
drinking to murk its oil'uct at that time. The othi r
charges I know nothing about, and made no inquiry
about, thinking them Impossible. Yours truly,
U. 8. Grant,
judge T. 0. Uowk.
- Tho President takes groat pains to deny what
ho one has over ch-AVgod. Wo have nowhere
scon a statement that {Senator Carpenter was
under the iulluonco of liquor when be called on
the President. It may therefore bo taken for
granted that, to uso Qon. Grant's words, ’‘ho
gave no ovidouco of having boon drinking to
mark its effect at that timo.” To those who
havo confidonco in Gon. Grant's capacity of
observation “to mark its oftcct at that time "
this statement may pass for what it is worth.
The other letter touches the matter in quoa
tiou, —whether Senator Carpenter was turnnd
away from the West End Hotel, for reasons wo
decline to stato in detail. It is from ouo Farrar,
roora-clork of that hoto), and now employed in
tho hotel which Hr. Carpenter patrou&es in
Washington, and is as follows :
Willard's Hotel, Washington. Oct. 20, 1873.
The lion. 'l\ 0, Howe :
Lear Sin: In regard to tho charges against Sena
tor Carpenter At Long Brunch, tho facts are sim
ply ibeso: Mr. Carpenter canto with several others,
and there was not a vacant room in tho house. I told
him bo, and gave him a note of introduction to the
Ocoau House. If the President hud called at the same
time for u room, 1 should have told him the same
thing. Mr. Carpenter was neither intoxicated nor
guilty of any improprieties whatever.
George H. Farrar,
Boom Clerk West End Hold.
This would bo conclusive in regard to tho mat
ter if it wore true. It is a bald and naked faUo
huod, by a person small enough to bo brought to
It, invented to suvo Mr. Carpenter from tho con
sequences of his own criminal folly. On tho

ter to find a jury anywher* in the country who
can read this letter and tills register, and not

This is not a pleasant subject and ought to
bo dropped. Mr. Carpenter ts not a 11c man to
preside over tho Undcd States Senate. If
his colleagues would drop him from that place,
and his friondu have the discretion to cease de

out of that prominence which is so disagreeable
to them and so unwelcome to tbo public.
Gcttiu;r t/uod to It.
In au hißtorical and descriptive account of
Persia recently published iu London, appears
tuo following alary, which, according to the
author, gives a fair ulna of tho oppressions that,
under* tho gumo of law, aro allowed to toko
place in that country; “Au acquaintance of
the writer of those pages, while ho lodged in a
certain town, was alarmed by hearing in a
neighboring house a wort of periodical punish
ment going on daily. Iloavy blows woia
given. and a person was con
tinually crying out, ‘ Amauu! amaun!
(Mercy, mercy)—l have nothing 1
Heaven is my witness, 1 have nothing! ’
Upon inquiry, lie learned that the sutt'oror was
a merchant reputed to he very rich, who after
ward confessed to him that, haring understood
tho Governor of tho place was determined to
have a share iu his wealth, and expecting to bo
nut to tho torture, ho had resolved to habituate
himself to tho endurance of pain, in order to bo
able to resist the threatened demands, lie had
brought himself to bear I,OUO strokes of tho
