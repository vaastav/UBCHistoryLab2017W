PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IN HIS VARIETY
TT [s difficulUfor Californians to take seriously the portion of the
I President's message touching on the Japanese. It is based on
J misinformation, and. apparently, was conceived in a fit of bad
temper. Mr. Roosevelt will on reflection realize that he has
made a ?rave mistake. We cannot hold Secretary Metcalf free
from blame. His knowledge of the situation is. or should be, com
plete. It il^i 1^ obyiousMtliat for some reason he has failed to convey
thait* knowledge to his chief.
The President's impassioned eulogy of Japanese efficiency is
wholly beside the question. It is doubtless admirable from a diplo
matic point of view, but it has nothing to do with the case. The
President's threat to enforce with the bayonet his hasty and un
founded conception of the rights involved is merely absurd.
These features of the message are mostly rhetoric and hasty
temper, and might be disregarded as such, but when the President,
even in his most excited mood., recommends the naturalization of
Tapanese and their admission to full citizenship, we make the strong
en protest. If the Japanese are fit subjects for Americanship, the
same thing is equally true of the Chinese. The Japanese, as we find
them on this coast, do not equal the Chinese in efficiency as work
men, and are far less trustworthy. Shall we then adulterate our
citizenship by an infusion of Asiatic coolies? The national body
politic can assimilate the European of whatever grade, but never the
Asiatic. They are aliens always, no matter what their civil status.
The proposition to naturalize them is preposterous. '
All this outburst of august and Jovian wrath takes its rise in
the fact that Fan Francisco, proceeding under the State laws, has
segregated Asiatic students in special schools because it is deemed;
inexpedient that adults should associate with little children in the
intimate relations of school life. To call that "a crime against a
fricndlv nation" is the language of nightmare.
It is unfortunate that the President's intemperate utterances
on the Japanese affair should have the effect of obscuring and throw
ing into the background those many features of the document that
merit the highest commendation as in the. line of enlightened prog
ress. One of these deals with the more effective control of corpora
tions. Of this the President says:
It cannot too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown
the impossibility of securing by the acticms of nearly haif a hundred different
State Legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with
the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of
any one State. In some method, whether by a national license law or in
other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more com
plete control than at present over these great corporations — a control that
will, among other things, prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization
and that will compel the disclosure by each corporation of its stockholders
and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary
or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of
inordinate profits by favored individuals. -v'
Mr. Roosevelt differs flatly with Harriman, who thinks the In
terstate Commerce Commission has already too much power for
the good of the railroads. The President believes those powers
should be increased. ,
* * *
Perhaps the most radical departure advocated by the President
is the provision for "a graduated inheritance tax" and "a graduated
income tax." The President, after beating about the bush a* good
deal, finally indicates the nature and purpose ol the graduation where
he says "the prime object should be to put a constantly increasing
liurden on the inheritance of those swollen fortunes which it is cer
tainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate."
In that view the tax would be in the first place punitive and only
in a secondary sense a means of revenue.
However this confusion of ethics and political economy may be
viewed, it does not affect the President's recommendations as to an
income tax. He asks Congress to enact a law in that regard in the
hope that the Supreme Court may reverse or modify its, former
decision on this subject. As the President appoints the Justices,
the urgency of his language on this point seems to carry an intima
tion that he knows that the court as now, or shortly to be, constituted
will reverse the decision made by a majority of one. The income
tax is, of course, an ideal means of revenue when it is needed. The
question arises whether the Federal Government has not already ai
The President indulges himself at length in characteristic but
academic reflection on peace and war, as, for instance: - *
A just war is in the long run far better for a nation's soul than the
most prosperous peace obtained "by acquiescence in wrong or injustice.
Moreover, tho it is criminal for a nation not to prepare for war, so that it
may escape the dreadful consequences of being defeated in war, yet it must
always be remembered that even to' be defeated in war may be far -.better
than not to have fought at all. As has been well and finely said, a beaten
nation is not necessarily a disgraced nation; but the nation or man is dis
graced if the obligation to defend right is shirked. \u25a0 .
• The President said all that better in the phrase, "Walk softly
and carry a big stick."
The message is full- of suggestion, as well as stuffed with words.
It might be entitled "A Tractate on the Making of a Complete Ameri
can." It begins with the application of the young idea on manual
training and carries the citizen beyond the grave, where he ! is ex
pected to surrender a generous share of his accumulations, partly for
the good,of his country and in greater part as a sort of posthumous
pur.ishmert for greed. The.r^es'sagc deals with considerations of in
ternational etiquette without more wisdom than treatises on etiquette
usually show. It informs the farmer that he has become a" pro-

THE PROFESSOR'S PERIL
THE proud eminence as a matinee idol occupied with distinction
and enjoyed with evident, zest \u25a0_ by Professor Henry^ Morse
Stephens of the University of California is shrewdly threatened.
The women's clubs are moving on him in force. They will be
repelled only by unmasking a battery of bouquets.
It appears that Professor Stephens/with more valor than dis
cretion, has undertaken the dangerous work of writing a history, of
his own times. Unterrified by the fate of .Froude and Forster, he will
be the official historian of the San Francisco fire and earthquake. Al
ready the ladies have begun to suspect him of being unfair to the fair.
Mr. Stephens is operating the limelight, and the women's clubs are pur
sued by doubts and fears that the historian prejudiced in favor of
the unfair sex. has relegated them to the dark corners, or, it may. be,
has elbowed them off the stage altogether.
Doubtless the Esquire Professor,! f tackled with the ball in his
stout arms, will shelter himself with polite, magniloquenj: phrases be
hind "the truth of history." The word seems familiar, and /comes
trippingly like Falstaff's honor. What is this truth of history?
Who hath it ? Him who died o' Wednesday, or wait; Thursday?.s \u25a0 it; Thursday ?.
Will it set your hat on straight; or darn the^hole in your stocking?
One seems to remember the remark of the sage— not
Stephens — "and as for history, we know that to be lies."
We venture to offer a plea mv favor of gratitude! Professor
Stephens owes a cartload of bouquets to the women's clubs, and the
debt is about due. Cast your bouquets upon the -waters and they
will return to you when they come handy. Otherwise it ;will be for
you like Thackeray's suburban lady who ventured on an unhappy arid
ill-fated Shakespearean excursion, and thus was her lament: "How
sharper than a thankless tooth it is to have a serpent child." Which,
being freely translated to the language of a vulgar generation, means
"twenty-three for you." VV- i . - -
NOTE AND COMMENT

most acute in those portions of the United States farthest ] removed
from any seaboard, with the newspaper War cloud hanging heaviest
over the Mississippi Valley. ' *-. V .
Cleveland may, have been able to pen Lnger and heavier sen
tences in his state papers, but Roosevelt writes more of them.

Poor of England and France
Face Serious Conditions
ENGLAND is :<m the verge of a
marked Increase in .the cost of
\u25a0 living, according to a report re
ceived at "Washington from Con
sul Hamm of Hull.
There is a simultaneous shortage in
several kinds of household provisions, ,
and the result * that prices are al
ready on the rise, and by Christmas
they will have reached unusual heights.
Butter and cheese are two of the chief
articles in which there is a shortage,
and the reason for the shortage is
found in the continued drought of the
past few months, the effect being felt
not only in England, but in butter
producing countries like France. Can
ada and , Australia. 'Apart from this,
many farmers are. giving: up making
butter and cheese, finding it more prof
itable to sell their milk. The result
of these things Is that there is. a scar
city of both butter and cheese: At
Christmas butter will cost 4 cents per
pound more than at present, and cheese
will increase by 2 cents a pound. .A
leading London .firm of provision deal
ers states that prices, are even now
well advanced. Here . are their list of
present (per pound) prices and esti
mated prices for. Christmas:

There was a shortage this year of
strawberries and yellow plums for Jam.
and marmalade, for some unexplained
reason, is:also less In quantity than
usual. The catch of sardines wa* much
below the ordinary this year,, so that
the tinned fish are also more expensive.
Then, too, there is a diminution In the
supply of best bacon, farmers flncltng
that pig breeding is less profitable than
of old. Here Is a list of the prospective
prices of some .of .these things -at

will be made in various grad/**- The
failure of the potato crop in .th* west

tolls me that the price of BeatyolaU

where it will stop. The following table,
which I have compiled from tjusi
wortfty sources, gives the advance rr»
price in a number of articles of dnl!v
consumption. The price Is per kilo
grams, or 220 pounds:
* Cabbages bring now from 90 cents to
$1.80 per dozen heads, while last year
at this time they sold at from 40 to SO
cents per dozen. Lentils have increased
in price In the snm of 1i francs* C.r»m
per 120 pounds; split peas $1 per l<>">
kilograms ( 220 pounds). Potatoes an
nearly' double the price of last ye*r.
The slight scarcity In apples has been
compensated by Import from Italy.
"While farmers have been compelled
to kill their stock to prevent the ani
mals from dying of thirst, meat has
advanced in common with other articles
of daily consmnpt'on to nearly double
the prices of a year ago. The drought
is responsible for an Increase of $1 per
loi* kilograms (22ft pound*) of sugar, a*
It has caused a shortage In the . h**t
crop. The dry spell has Induced th"»
people of the country in the neighbor

100 kilograms. Everything considered,
the outlook for the winter 13 very dis
couraging, especially for th*» poor, who
