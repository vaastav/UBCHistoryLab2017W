If ex-Presiclcnt Taft was as
popular as a president as he is a
private citizen, he mifcht have
received a few more votes at the
last election.
Over in Quay County the
democrats are still discussing
the pro and con advisability of
adopting the primary plan.
Better get up to date folks.
The eastern New Mexico coun
ties, including Curry, adopted it
long ago.
The indications are that can
didates for county office in Curry
county are going to be as thick
next year as flies in the summer
time. The man that is elected
to office next year is going to
have to show a clean record and
be qualified to hold the position
to which he aspires.
The Clovis stores are all in full
Christmas dress and the arrange
ments and decorations are better
this year than for many past.
Many people have already begun
their holiday shopping and in
doing so will prevent being
caught in the last jam.
If you know any news, tell us
about it or phone it to the News
office. Don't wait for the re
porter to And out about it, and
if he fails to do so feel sore at
the office. We will appreciate
your telling us events and so will
our readers. Phone it to 97.
The Clovis News enjoys hav
ing the largest circulation of
any paper in the county, even if
it did cost us a piano to get it.
The advertisers get a greater
circulation service at the same
price which should be some in
ducement for many to use more
freely of printers ink.
We are glad it is ours once
more to greet our readers with a
bright and merry Christmas. It
seems out yestercsay mat we
sent a like message to you, and
yet a year has flown by. May
your homes be bright, the dear
children of your household happy
and the great wish and hope of
your hearts in abundant measure
be realized this Christmas tide.
The editors wife was sick, so
he called the doctor. The doctor
took her temperature by keeping
a thermometer over her tongue
for over a minute. "Say Doc,"
said the editor, "what is that
machine and what will you take
for it?" "Its a themometer,"
said the doctor, but why do
vou ask such a question?" "Its
the longest time her tongue has
been still since we were married
and I want to buy one," saiu the
editor.
President Wilson's message to
congress is an able document.
He deals with the delicate situ
ations that have arisen since the
great war in a most commend
able manner. His advocacy of
preparedness, which is the core
of the argument, is timely and
correct. The United States is
the undefended treasure land
and any one of the great
European countries now en
gaged in war could land a larpe
army of trained troops and prob
ably take this country on short
notice. The Monroe doctrine is
just as strong as our navy and
the time has arrived to be either
prepared to defend it in case of
necessity or abandon it as an
obsolete policy.
The oldest busines establish
ment in Clovis is the Clovis
News. It was printed and cir
culated among the farmers that
then inhabited this section of
the country before there was a
a single house on the present
townsite. It was then called
the Clovis News although the
postolfice was known as Riley
and there was no postoffiee of
Clovis for several months afrer.
Though young in years, the two
oldest residents of Clovis are the
News manager and C. V. b'tted.
