Shipping Problems
PARIS, Dec. 2. The problem of

Balnbrldge Colby, representative of
the American shipping board at the
Inter-allled conference, ha declared.
The solution la found In the enormous

States.
"I am not permitted by the nature
of things, to discuss the work of our

Colby. "1 can say, however, that It
has been of the highest value and sig

Redaction of Profits
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 4.
Chicago packers have protested to
Herbert Hoover against the limita
tion of their profits to 9 per cent
They hinted at underproduction If
they do not get more. Hoover told
them that 9 per cent ta a fair profit,
and that anything above that will
como from the people' pockets, and
that it will not be permitted.
The packers Armour, Wilson,
Swift, Morris and Cudahy told Hoo
ver 9 per cent profit might lighten
their borrowing capacity and Increase
the war expense of their plant. As
tho food administration phrased It,
the packers replied:
"They stated they would cheerfully
work under any regulations mad by
the government, but represented
strongly that the eatlr responsibility

Germany could not forsee.
"Of course, tha most fruitful thing

who are directing the mighty events
now passing. But to me the most In

Hoover replied that th necessarily
prosperous nature of the packers'
business would Inspire the confidence
of the banking community, and that,
so far as funds for plant axtanslon to
meet the government needs Is con
cerned, the government will see to
that, if necessary.
Hoover Informed the packers that
his investigation showed that the
packers' pre-war earnings ware slight
ly less than 9 per' cent, and that "any
request for an Increase was practic

ers of the country to pay for plant ex

IRRIGATION
EXTENSION
That the government expects to ex,-, - -.-,,-
pend an unusual amount of money In.
the extension of the Klasaath IrriW'
tlon project the coming year -is evt-,
dence'd in a wire received late yimtpr"
day by the -Commercial, Club Jrom.N.
, Sinnott at Washington.
The estimate
recommend? ran
close to half a million dollars. With
-a
a large appropriation and the verr '
large amount of work which the farm
ers in the various districts are arrang
ing to do on their own initiative, the
progress of the coming year here Mae
fair to far outstrip that of any previ-,
ous season. -
Tbe wonderful returns mad this
season over the Klamath prelect nave
proved beyond any vestige of doubt'
the immense benefit of. the irrigation,
and the qfJclals at Washington are
commencing to see that they oaa da
no one thlng.whtefc will increase the
food supply otjthe nation than to get
some of the fertile lands of the West
under water, -
Mr. Slnnott's wire follows;11
"Estimates of the reclamation ser
vice and recommendations to congress '
for the fiscal year beginning next
June for the Klamath project are
$423,000. This Is an increase of
$184,000 over the appropriation this
year. I ahall make every efort to
have congress approve these esti
mates. Kbtimates have also been, made for
$200,000 for the purchase of live-'
stock, nomes, Darns ana agricultural
equipment on the Klamath reserva
tion. Will try1 to have this lncreaaef"
The latter part of the message re- (
lates to a move which ha been laang '
urated by Edward B. Ashurst aad eth
