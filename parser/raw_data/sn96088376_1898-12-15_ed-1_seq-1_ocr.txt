Manila, Doo. 13. According to re-
liable advices received from Iloilo,
capital of the island of Panay, in the
Visayus group, the insurge'nts attacked
Iloilo the night ot December 1 and cap
tured all the Spanish trenches, except
one. They then notified General Kios
to remove the women and children,
and threatened to renew the attack on
the following night.
When these advices left Iloilo, Gen
eral Rios was expecting reinforcements
and field guns, and the plun was fur
the Spanish gunboats to shell, if tha
Insurgents effected an entrance.. The
foreign residents were greatly alarmed,
and all merchantmen have been ordered
outside the harbor.
Meanwhile the Spanish authorities
have been advised that the Tulisanos
troops are looting, in disobedience of
orders, and cannot be restrained.
On the ether hand, the Spanish trans
port Isla de Luzon reports that the in
surgents around Iloilo were repulsed
with great slaughter December 6, while
attempting to storm the last entrench

Insurgents were killed or wounded by

FILES HER PROTEST.
Spain Accepts th Conaaqncae
Ill-
Natarcdly.
Madrid, Dec 13. The government
entirely approves the memorandum of
protest against the action of the United
States commissioners, filed by Senor
Montero Rios, at Paris.
The memorandum protests against
tiie refusal of the Americans to surren
der the securities deposited in the treas
uries of Cuba and Porto Rico by private
Spaniards, remarking that "never has
a civilised nation committed snob an
aot of violence. "
Secondly, it protests against the ulti
matum demanding the Philippines.
Thirdly, it protests against the posi
tion in which those Spaniards are
placed who desire to remain in Cuba.
Fourthly, it protests against the ref
erence to the destruction of tbe Maine-
in President McKinlcy's message to
congreas. On this point the memoran
dum says:
"Spain has proposed arbitration, but
tho United States has refused to give
her the right which is granted to a
criminal; namely, the right of defend
ing herself. The Spanish commission
ers leave the care of fixing the responsi
bility for the explosion to the entire
world, which 'will say whether thote
are letponsible who desire the truth, or
those refusing to seek it."
The newspapers generally express re
lief at the signing ot the treaty. The
Independent organs, most of the provin
cial papers and the Carlist and repub
lican journals attack both political par
ties, conservative and libeial, reproa sit
ing them equally with having brought
the country to the present pars.
El Impnrcial alone publishes the
contents Of the treaty, which produces
a less unfavorable impresHion than had
been expected, owing to the commercial
and other concessions to Spain.
El Liberal says: "The Paris negotia
tions offer a fur sadder spectacle than
the ships which are bringing back our
repatriated soldiers, deplorable aa the
oondition of the latter is."
Sevoral members of the United States
commission were inclined at first to
publish the text of tho treaty, bnt Sen
ator Frye made a strong plea yesterday
for the observance ot oourtesy toward
the United States senate, and tits ar
guments prevailed.
Further details, however, have been
learned aa to the wording of the treaty,
whioli provides that Cuba is to be re
linquished and that Porto Rico and the
Philippines are to he ceded. Tbe
Americana are to pay for the repatria
tion of the Spanish troops from all the
colonies. The Spaniards are to return
all prisoners held by them. They are
to retain possession of all military
stores and munitions of war in the
Philippines, and of sucti ships aa have
not been captured. The commercial
treaties between the two nations, which
the war ruptured, are to be lenewed at
tho convenience of the two nations,

DEATH OF GARCIA.
fb Cuban Patriot a Victim
. of the
I Northern Climate.
Washington, Dec. 18. -General Cal
ixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban
. warrior and leader, and the head of the
J commission elected by th. Cuban as
'geiobly to visit this country, died her.
jtliis morning, shortly after 10 o'clock,
at the Hotel Raleigh, where th. com
mission has its headquarters.
Th .ridden change from the warm
slimate of Cuba, with tbe hardships
he had there endured, to the wintry
weather of New York and Washington,
is responsible for the pneumonia
which resulted in his demise. Be con
tracted a slight cold in New York,
which did not assume an alarming
stage nntil early the part of last week.
Lint Tuesday night, General Garcia,
in company with the other members of
the commission, attended dinner
given in his honor by General Miles,
and it was a result of tbe exposure that
culminated in bis death.
During the 13 hours or more preced
ing dissolution. General Garcia was
unconscious most of the time. At in
tervals he recognized one or more of
those about him. In his dying mo
ments, as all through his busy and ao-
tive life, bis thoughts were for bis be
loved country and its , people, and,
among his last words, were irrational
mutterings, in which be gave orders to
his son.wbo is on bis staff, for tbe bat
tle which he supposed was to occur to
morrow, and in which he understood
there were only 400 Spaniards to com
bat. Just before he 'died he embraced
his son.
Rev. Father Magee, of St. Patrick's
church, was called in during the day,
and waa witb General Garcia until the
end, administering the last litea of the
Catholic church. Other members of
the commission and Mr. Rubens, tbeir
counsel in this country, were also in
tiie bed-chamber when the end came.
The remains were immediately pre
pared for burial, and were placed on a
bier in the room in which he died. A
large Cuban flag served as a covering,
and the head rested on one of smaller
dimensions. The face and bust were
left exposed to public view. The fea
tnres had a remarkable lifelike appear
ance, and gave no indication of the
suffering which the deceased bad
borne. Just above tbe bead rested a
magnificent floral piece of red and
white ribbon. By direction of Major-
General Miles a detachment of soldiers
from battery E, Sixth artillery, under
command of Lieutenant Cox, was de
tailed as a body guard for the remains.
General Garcia, whoee name will
ever be linked with those of other pa
triots who have fought against unequal
odds for the freedom of his country,
has hud a most active and varied life,
most of which has been spent in fight
ing for the cause of Cuban liberty,
which he had the satisfaction of seeing
accomplished so short a time before his
death. He was a man of cultuie and
refinement, of splendid education, and
came from a distinguished family of
Jaiquani.of Santiago de Cuba province,
He was born in Cogquin, October 14,
1839,- and was therefore in bia 60th
year.

ian rriaonera.
Washington, Dec 13. The navy de
partment has received a cablegram from
Admiral Dewey, summarizing the ex
isting conditions at Manila, and such
points in the Philippines as have been
visited by hi.' officers. Advioes al.o
have been received from General Otis,
the commandant of the United States
military foices in the islands, and they
both go to show a notable improvement
in condition, and the growth of a bet
ter spirit among those factions of tb.
natives which promised to give trouble.
This faot ia particularly gratifying,
as tbe United States government is al
ready giving considerable attention to
the best means at band to redeem tne
pledge it was placed under by tbe treaty i
of Paris to secure the release of tbe i
Spanish prisoners held by the Philip-j
pine natives, mere are aoont ouu
clerical prisoners, and the government
is confident that their captors will de
liver them opon proper representations
from General Otis and Admiral Dewey,
made - posaibk' through Consul Wild
man. It may be necessary to tall the
navy into service in this matter, lor
the reason that some of tbe prisoners
are held in captivity on other islands
than Luzon, which can be reached best
and most effective by Admiral Dewey's
ships.
Besides these clerical prisoners, the
Americans themselves bold nearly 15,
000 Spanish soldiers as pt isoners, men
captured at tbe fail of Manila. These
are actually on parole about the citr,
and the question is how are they to be
returned to Spain. This must he set
tled by the peace commissioners at
Paris.
TROOPS FOR MANILA.
Next Expedition Will Croas th Atlan
tic Ocean Inatcad of Pacific.
' New York. Dec 13. A dispatch to
the Tribune from Washington says:
The next regiments to etait for Manila
will embark at New York about the
end of this month and will go through
the Sues canal. The expedition will
consist of three regiments of regular in
fantry, distributed between two of the
largest converted transports owned by
the government, witb perhaps a convoy
of two warships. Arrangements are
now being made for this expedition by
Adjutant-General Corbln as rapidlv aa
possible, in view of its great import
ance, and especially as it inrolvea co
operation by the state and navy de
partment authorities, aa well as those
of the w.-vr department.
The decision to nse New York as the
point ot embarkation instead of San
Francisco, whence all the earlier forcea
started for tbe Philippines, was reached
by General Corbin after s careful re
view of a number of considerations,
chief among which was the urgency
for baste. The early completion of the
treaty ot peace with Spain renders in
dispensable a prompt increase- of the
American forces, not only at Manila,
but to provide additional garrisons for
important centers in the arnhipelaso,
which will immediately fall nnder
American domination with its accom
panying responsibility for the security
of life and property.
At the present time the government
is wholly without available transports
in the Pacific ocean to meet the emer
gency. The dispatch of two vessels
from tbe Atlantic, it ia believed, will
therefore be particularly advantageous
for the double purpose of bringing
home from Manila such, volunteers as
can soon be spared, and increasing tbe
transport fleet in the Pacific The
three regiments of regulars have not
been selected, but as none but those
now in New York state and other At
lantic garrisons can be spared, the con
clusion was forced upon the autliorities
that economy as well as rapidity of
action required them to be sent by way
of the Mediterranean instead of jour
neying across the continent and then
undertaking the trying and monotonous
voyage on the Pacific with no haven of
rest after leaving Hawaii.
Actual steaming distance for lull
powered vessels from New York to
Manila, via Sues, ia given by naval
hydrographer. as 11,605 knots, while
that from San Franoisoo to Manila, via
Honolulu, is given aa 7,050 knots. To
Manila from New York by way of the
Cape of Good Hope is 13,585 miles, and
by way of the Straits of Magellan and
Samoa it is 16,900 miles.
Found In th Baldwin Ruins.
San Franoisco, Dec. 13 Another
body was taken from the ruins of tiie
Baldwin hotel lute last night. Wreck
ers delving in the debris on the Market-street
side tnrned up a charred mass
of flesh, which at tbe morgue was pro
nounced to b) the remains of a human
being. There was .absolutely nothing
to indicate the identity of the corpse,
which is believed to be that ot a woman.
Several letters were discovered near the
body, but they ate not supposed to
throw any light on the mystery, as they
are directed to Mrs. Benjamin Wether
hy, who, with her, husband, esoaped
from the building unharmed. The

To . th
Modification of th Clayton

New York, Dec, 12. A dispatch to
the Herald , froi.i Washington says:
President McKi.iIey is in favor of open
ing negotiations with Great Britain for
the poprose of modifying the Clayton
Bui wer treaty so as to permit the con
itruction and control of the Nicaragua
canal by the United States.
Should congress during the present
session fail to enact the ponding Morgan
bill tbe president also favors entering
into negotiations with Nicaragua and
Costa Rica looking to the construction
of tbe canal under the auspices and con
trol of the United States.
On the authority of a high official of
the administration it instated that there
is absolutely no foundation for the re
port that Great Britain, through Sir
Julian Paancefote, has, protested lo the
state department against that feature
ol the president's message dealing with
the canal question. On the contrary,
the authorities have every reason to be
lieve that the British government will
consent to any reasonable modification
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty that th?.,
president may desire, so a to reiujfcve
the obstacles which it plaeea-n the
way for the control at tiwrfcanai by this
government.'"

STILL REACHING OUT.
Bu.ela, Germany and Franc
Sa th
Partitioning of China.
Slflbai, Deo. 13. John Barrett,
formerly ..United States minister to
Siam, baa returned here after visiting
Peking and the principal cities and
ports. He says the situation in China
is one of a most critical nature, and
Manchuria is. no longer Chinese, but
Russian territory. He asserts that
New Cbwang, the chief northern port
for tbe movement of American products,
is also practically Russian, and is liable
to be closed any day.
Tbe only permanent safeguard to par
amount American and British interests,
Barrett says, is immediate and united
action by tbe interested governments to
defend their territory in the Chinese
empire, to force reforms in the govern
ment, to prevent further cessi.ms of
ports and provinces, and to insist upon
an "open-door" policy in ail the ports
of China, including thespheiesof influ
ence of Russia, Germany and France.
Otherwise, Barrett contends, the im
pending partition of the Chinese empire
will seriously curtail the field of trade
by disastrously affecting American and
British influence in Asia. . ,
WATTERSON FOR EXPANSION.

New York, Dec 13. Tho Patria
Club held its fiist meeting of the win
ter touight,and entertained and listened
to Colonel Henry Watteraon, of Louis
ville, tbe speaker of the evening.
Colonel Watterson spoke on "Our
Country; Its Dangers-and Its Hopes,
Past, Present and to Come." lie de
clared himself in favor ot the policy ot
national expansion.
"I am not disposed," he said, "to
agree with the optimistic young Amer
ican who believes that the United
Statea is hounded on the north unthe"
aurora borealis, on the south by the
equator, on the east by the rising sun,
and on the west by eternity, but aitll 1
think somewhat that way.
"As for expansion, I think that what
England baa done witb safety, America
may attempt. If Dewey had only
sailed away but he did not, and where
he nailed the Stars and Stripes, there
they must stay. We must either go
forward or backward, wild we cannot go
backward without loss of sol (-respect.
"The anti-expansionists ask how we
can take. these new responsibilities
when our own government at home ia
so admittedly con opt On the other
band, we are a natibn of producers hin
dered by overproduction. We must
have a greater market. Also, the Phil
ippine islands are not further from th
Golden Gate today than was San Fran
cisco from Washington when California
was annexed. The centralized power
of modern' ' civilization annihilated
space and knits all together; All na
tional expansion for ns is but America,
the boy, grown to muuhood and nat
urally reaching out."
SEVERE WIND STORIv
Gal Blew Nlnety-SU Miles an Hour al
I'olut Kcyee.
San Francisco, Dec. 13. The storm
which raged all over the Pacific coast
last night and today was one of the
most severe ever recorded by the
weather burean. It extended from the
northern border down to Texas and
from the Pacific as far east as Nebraska.
In this city the wind attained a velocity
of 45 miles an hour, but at Point
Reyes, right in the teeth of the gale,
the wind swept along at 96 miles an
hour. Considering the groat velooity
of the wind, the damage done to ship
ping was slight, and (10,000 will pay
for everything, including the charges
ot tow boat men for extrioating vessels
from dangerous positions.
