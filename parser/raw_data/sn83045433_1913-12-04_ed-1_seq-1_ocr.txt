Mexico Citj, Dec. 3,-The chamber ot
deputies this afternoon continued to ap
prove all of HUerta's actions since he
assumed extraordinary ppwers follow ins
the dissolution of the last congress. His
dissolution of the former congress was
approved, as was his decree increasin;
the army to 150,000 men.
A declaration that Hnerta would con
tinue to exercise his extraordinary now

render an account of his actions, was
received with equanimitv. The proposi

and passed.
Huerta's assumption of extraordinary
Powers for another jear applies to ir
measures onlj, such as armj Increases,
enlargtment of the navj, war expendi
tures and all other matters pertaining to
the army and navj No report is to be
made b the President of his exercise
of these powers until the end of a jear.

Speaking of President Wilson's remarks
on the Mexican situation in his message

"I have no Intention of vlelding If this
lighting should continue for several jears
1 shall continue to do m part in it if
I am still alive.
Huerta expressed confidence in the

President Wilsons message to Congress
Was greeted with much indignant and
sarcastic comment today by the adminis
tration press. The general tenor of the
comments was that the President of the
United States did not understand condi
tions in Mexico erad , was thereforeqre
sumptious In predicting the downfall or
the present government.
Minister of Agriculture Lozano Is sald
to have been responsible for the rejection
bj Huerta of a mediation propol ten
dered bv Qieen Ulllielmina of Holland on
behalf of the European powers represent
ea in The Hague Tribunal
The proposal was that Huerta should
arrange for new elections, reform the
government, and then resign the Presi
dency In return the European powers
aTeed to use their influence to induce
th- Washington government to extend
letognltion to the Huerta administra
tion ad Interim and to guarantee what
ever funds might be needed for the
process of pacification and reconstruc
tion. Restoration ot the name of Porfirio
Diaz to the active list of the armj Is
believed to forecast another and more
urgent appeal to the exiled President to
return for the salvation of the land
which cast him out.
NOTHING IS HEARD HERE

MADE BY HOLLAND QUEEN
Little change was noted in the Mexican
situation jesterdaj Secretary Brian

the State Department has received no
word from foreign governments for or
against the President's 'watchful wait

TLesday.
No confirmation has been received of
the report that the rebels have cut off
the oil fuel suppi) of the National Rall

The Italian Ambassador was a caller
at the State Department yesterday. No
statement of the object of the visit was
made, but it is understood Italy con

Place for Holding EyenL
It is practically certain that the Ma
rine Band, which U an attraction In it
self at any entertainment, will take part
In the musical program at the Commu
nity Christmas tree celebration.
A report to this effect was made bv
the chairman of the music committee,
at the meeting of the. executive commit
tee held esterda afternoon. The chair
man stated that he had called on Frank
lin D. Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of
the Navy, and had been told that the
band would lie available for tho Christ
mas celebration, providing the President
dbes not need its services Christmas Eve.
The site for the Christmas tree was
thoroughly discussed by the committee,
and a decided feeling In favor of the
plaza on the east side of the Capitol de
veloped. It is not known positively that permis
sion for the use of the Capitol plaza can
be obtained, but "feelers" havd been
thrown out on .Jhls matter and the com
mittee has been made to understand
from an unofficial source that such per
mlslon wll be granted readily,

A majority of the committeemen feel
that the Capitol plaza has many ad
vantages ovir the Ellipse for the staging
cf the Christmas celebration One of tho
arguments in favor of its use is its cen
tral location. If the Capitol is selettrd
the Christmas festival will be as ac
cessible tu an- part of the city as to
the other, vhiih would not have been
the case at the Ellipse. Then, too, the
big paved space, it Is felt, might be
verj acceptable to thoe attending the
entertainment, for the w either is an un
certain quantity In Washington at tho
xuletidc sea&on. and the plaza could be
made comfortable by the activities of a
few "white wings," while snow or rain
on the Ellipse would rei.der It unfit for

The practicability of the Capitol site
will be worked out within a day or two.

Wilson to "enlighten him concerning" our
movement" and to demand that he make
the woman's amendment an administra

to Congress and insist that it be considered
before taking up any other legislation
whatsoever. There was a feeble protest
against the demand for primary con

the point "that we insist our enfran
chisement be prepared for before cur

League, and Mr. Laldlaw presented Rep
resentative MondelL of Wjomlng. as the
first speaker. Mr. Mondell addressed his
hearers as "Present and Future Voters."
He devoted himself to the proof that
only the virile, manly men are for woman
suffrage; In no case the weak, effemi
nate men. He scored Representative
Heflln. of Alabama, severely for his
statement that men who support this
cause ought to wear dresses. He called
Heflln young-man-afrald-of-suflrage after
comparing his attitude to that of an
Indian chief in a Wyoming reminiscence.
Spewb. off Pinehot.
Gifford Plnchotf followed him. He
told the women that he Is in favor of
woman suffrage, because the nation
needs them and needs them In the
Progressive party.
"We must get the better half of the
nation In the struggle." said he. "The
women will help In this fight That is
why the Progressives alone of the big
parties favor woman's enfranchise
ment" Victor Murdock. leader of the Pro
gressives In the House, followed Mr.
Pinehot
"I am no orator as my friend. "Mon
delL Ho-ow he made love to joul"
And Mr. Murdock put on the expres
sion of T wish I could, too."'
"I belong to a clan, or party, to pry
open the door of opportunity for all.
and to keep It open." said he. "We
want the women with us. The new en
emy Is 'special privilege. with us every
where. We are through in this country
with Ulry-shaIly. dlllj -dally politicians.
and. tliank heaven, the women do not
compromise on moral Issues. We want
the women to Join us In our fight"
Representative Bryan was the last
speaker. He warmly criticised the
President for his neglect to mention
woman suffrage.
I think that the people of my State
are going to be disappointed with the
Presidents message for that omission.'
he said. "We are demanding an amend.
ment to the Federal Constitution, en
franchising women, and the time has
come to press home this one proposition.
The time has come to put public men, on
record as to their stand on woman sur
frace. and to put parties on record. 1
believe that the women hold the balance
of power necessary to rebuke In
difference to their- 'cause. "
John S. Crosby also spoke. "Retribu
tlon. Political Retribution," was the
theme of Charles Edward Russel's ad
dress. He counseled the women not to
forget nor forgive those who disappoint
them In their struggle.
A compromise between the national
suffrage organization and the House
Rules Committee may result from the
hearing which the suffragists had before
the committee yesterday morning. This
compromise was suggested by Represent
ative Hardwick, of Georgia, who pro
posed that the words "and Woman Suf
frage" be added to theMJtle of the pres
sent standing committee on the Election
of President Vice President and itepre
sentatlves in Congress. Dr. Anna How

Thus. It U recommended. In connection
with statistics on tuberculosis, that as a
preventive, particularly among the col
ored population, "dispensary and sani
tation facilities and provision for homo
instruction and nursing in appropriate
cases are needed." The Senate bill pro
viding for the segregation ot advanced
cases of tuberculosis Is .heartily Indorsed,
and It Is urged that sanitation provision
"should bo extended and made more at
tractive In order to accommodate larger
numbers of patients, and to hold them

In a manner to give rise to serious
thought and discussion Is the prevalenca
and treatment of sexual diseases. Tha
report says:
"The establishment of dispensaries for
the convenient treatment of patients suf
fering from such diseases and of In

need accommodations of that kind are
-matters worthy o lnjrttdlatfc serios con
slde&flon." '
Separate institution? for the- treatment
of inebriates and drug "flenda," and for
the care of the feeble-minded are urged.
More buildings are asked for the munici
pal hospital, and an Increase In the
working force of the Board of Chlldrens
Guardians Is urged. In this connection
the Commissioners take occasion to sound

ed persons.
Shonld Be Cared For.

"that not only should these people be
cared for as a humane measure, but It

their kind, and thus add to the burden
of their maintenance."
