Regarding New Constitution
Forced by Legislature.

child labor law, which prohibits the
employment of boys under sixteen
years of age, at dangerous occupa

Illinois could be compelled by the
state "at their peril to ascertain the
ages of children employed by them,"
and declared there could be no pos
sible constitutional objection to the
law.
That the state courts of Indiana
had the right to prevent the gov
ernment and state officials from sub
mitting to the people for adoption a
hew constitution framed by the legis

Supreme court.

stance of an opinion by the court.
The fight of the so-called book trust
to maintain arbitrary sale prices on
copyrighted books culminated in a de
cision in the Supreme court in which
the court held against the trust. The
main question at issue was as to
whether the trust should have a
"copyright monopoly" in the sale of
such books.

HOTEL FIRE KILLS 27
SEVERAL OTHERS MISSING AND
MANY ARE IN HOSPITALS
AT BOSTON.
VICTIMS DIE WHILE ASLEEP
Men Trapped In Burning Building Leap
to
Street and Are Seriously Hurt—
Some
Are Rescued by Firemen—
Distaster to Be Probed.
Iio.ston, Dec. 5.—Fire which de-
1202 Washington street causcd the
death of 27 persons on Wednesday.
This is the heaviest death toll ever re
corded in a fire In Boston.
Two persons were fatally injured
while more than a score were slightly
hurt or overcome by smoke. There
were 179 men asleep In the lodging
house when the fire broke out.
The Games spread swiftly through
the flimsy building and a number of
men, caught on tho upper floors,
leaped from windows.
All of the victims were poverty
stricken men, the lodging house being
a 15-ccnt a night affair, catering to
the poor. Many of them were home
less wanderers and for this reason the
authorities believe that the names of
all the victims will never be known.
The conflagration was attended by
many thrilling escapes. Firemen
spread nets and into these many of
the panic-stricken lodgers leaped.
One man wrapped a mattress
around his body and jumped from the
fifth floor, the mattress saving his life.
The great rapidity with which fire
leaped from floor to floor caught the
lodgers and scores awoke to find their
beds hemmed in by flames.
There they clung as the flames
belched from windows beneath them
and crept across the beds they had
vacated to the sills of the windows.
Several narrowly escaped being
hurled from thti coping into the street
in the rush for the ladders, which
fell just short of the coping on which
they were clinging. The firemen as
cended as far as they could and
caught the lodgers as they jumped to
the tops of the ladders four stories
In the air.
Medical Examiner Leary, after an
examination at the scene of the fire,
declared:
"I am going at this matter with an
ax. This is one of the greatest crimes
ever committed in this city. An in
quest will be started at once. I think
we have taken all the bodies from the
ruins. Boston has nearly a dozen such
fire traps. It Is a crime to allow them
to exist. This building looked like
a slaughter house. There is no good
excuse for such a condition of af
fairs."

The purpose of this placard is pri
marily educational. .Much of the com
plaint from users of gasoline finds its
source in tho fact that the consumer
uses the cheaper grades of gasoline in
stoves, flatirons, etc., and this gaso
line is not intended for such pur
poses. It is too heavy for use in these
appliances and its use soon results in
a clogging of valves and other incon
veniences. The lighter gasoline, if
properly made, does not produce these
unsatisfactory results because it con
tains none of the heavier oils which
in the cheaper gasolines are slow to
volatilize and burn. With kerosene,
much the same difficulty is met. The
cheaper, heavier oils give good and
satisfactory results when propertly
used, but lamps in which they are used
must be move frequently cleaned and
the wicks should he renewed before
they have to he discarded on account
of being too short. Burners must also
be frequently cleaned by boiling for
some time in water containing a small
amount of saleratus or cooking soda.
Will Test Law.
Pierre.—A te^i. of tile provi-siuus of
chapter 358 of the laws of the last
sesion is promised in a suit which
has been commenced against the state
in an orij-.inal action in the supreme
court, brought by A. E. Hitchcock,
president of the state hoard of regents
of ediii atiuii. Wiiile the suit is begun
for the recovery of $10.72, claimed as
travelipg and hotel expenses of Hitch
cock, at a meeting of the state board
of regents of education held at Hu
ron, September 10 and 11, dates of
the state fair, he eqntends in his com
plaint that the petty amount involved
has practically nothing to do with
the case, hut that it is the principle
involved which he desires the court to
settle. The statute in question pro
hibits the state auditor from allowing
warrants for expenses of slate officers
and -boards at meetings called at the
same time ami place as a state politi
cal convention or any general state
gathering. This act was passed on
the claim that state officers and
hoards made it a practice to set busi
ness meetings at the place where such
gatherings were being held, and 1J
this method secured free fare and
hotel expenses while attending such
meetings.
Opinions Differ.
Pierre.—The attorney general holds
differently from the state game de
partment in regard to shipment of deer
killed in the Black Hills. The game
warden held under the law that ship
ments could not be made, even of
deer killed in the open season which
resulted in the railway and ex
press companies in the Black
Hills section of the state refusing to
accept deer for shipment. This meant
that hunters in the Hills section could
haul their deer home in private con
veyances, but to the outside hunter in
the Hills it meant if he secured a deer
he had no way of getting it home,
neither had he the right to sell the
deer after he had killed it. The at
torney general holds that while the
state game law does not make any pro
visions for shipping deer killed in the
open season, neither does it make any
specific
provision preventing such
shipments. The law does provide for
carrying game birds, and fish as bag
gage where the shipment is accom
panied by the hunter, and the state law
department holds that a reasonable
rule should apply, and any game se
cured in the open season is subject to
the general provision of the law,
which allows the handling of game
