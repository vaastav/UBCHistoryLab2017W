IN MEMORY OF KINO ALFONSO.
Requiem Mass at ?L Matthew's Church
To-day.
the president and many other distin
guished persons present.
The requ iem h lgh mass at St. Matthew's church
this morning in memory, and for the repose of
the soul, of Klug Alfonso was a very imposing
ceremony. The Span.8 i minister made the
arrangements to correspond with a similar cer
emony to be performed at Madrid at the same
hour. About BOO invitations were Issued, and
sometime before the hour appointed for the
commencement of the services, eleven o'clock,
people began to arrive at the church. Many
came expecting to be admitted readily without
invitations, and when denied admittance
stood around the edifice watching the promi
nent arrivals until the unoccupied seats
should be available for the public. Presi
dent Cleveland, flanked by the Secretary
oi State and the Secretary or War,
walked over from the White House,
f hey were* assigned seats m a front pew on the
right of the main aisle. Ail of the foreign lega
tions at the capital were represented, and the
gorgeous uniforms of the mi ulsters and attaches
added to the brilliancy of the scene. At 11
o'clock the auditorium was not filled, but the
galleries were crowded. The auditorium was
appropriately draped in mourning, as were the
altar and the pulpit. In front of the altar rail
stood the catafalque, its base draped with the
Spanish llag, surmounted by the Spanish coat
o: arms. 1 tie casket of state had long silver
handles, and was surmounted by a wreath of
white flowers tied with while ribbons. The offi
ciating pastor was assisted by the deacon,
sub-dnaron, and master of ceremonies.
Besides a number of local priests and about
thirty altar boys were present, attired in sur
plices and cassocks. Mozart's grand requiem
watt rendered by a quartette composed of
Meusrs. Burnett and Gannon, Miss Eva Mills,
and Mrs. Daily, assisted by a chorus of thirty
voices, aud accompanied by an orchestra of fif
teen pieces.
The Spanish minister, Senor Valera, and the
attaches of the legation, occu{4cd a seat in front
of the catafalque, across the center aisle of the
church, and the representatives of other for
eign legations were scattered about through the
auditorium, as were also many invited guests
of official and social prominence.
The Tariff and Milver Questions.
various congressional sentiments as to
those topics in the message.
In all comments of Senators upon'the Presi
dent's message the tariff and silver features of
the document are given precedence. There
are two questions which it is generally ad
mitted will !>e dealt with by this Congress, aud
the wide, divergence of opinion upon them,
even among men of the same party, tends to
increase the interest. The advocates of silver
coinage condemn the President for his stand
and say he lias simply repeated the old and
vorn-out arguments of Wall street. But demo
crats, as a rule, who differ with the President,
are not inclined to express their antagonism
publicly, while some republican Senators, who
agree with him, hesitate to declare their appro
bation in print lest It might displease their con
stituents. The west and southwest seem to be
pretty solid in favor ot silver, aud therefore are
reudy to oppose the President's recommenda
tions on that question. The east and portious
ot the south will sustain the President, but
anion" those who believe that silver coinage
should be stopped the opinion prevails that
nothiug in that direction can be accomplished
in this Congress. The silver men clearly seem
to be in the majority in both houses, and unless
something shall occur tending to demonstrate
that the PreslBenVs fears oi financial trouble
are well founded, the silver dollar will continue
to be coined for two years at least.
Senator Van Wyck says there has been no
:bauge of sentiment in the west adverse to sil
ver; that if anything the "dollar of the daddies"
is stronger in that region than ever before.
Senator Wilson, of Maryland, agrees with the
President, and thinks there is a growing senti
ment in his section against the continued coin
age of Bilver. <
With regard to the tariff utterances of the
President, the tariff reformers or free-traders,
as they are sometimes designated, aVe dissatis
fied. They think the Executive has not gone
far enough in bis recommendation of tariff
reduction. The more moderate men, including
some protectionists, who think some reduction
can be safely made, applaud the President's
position. It is claimed for the Executive that
he i8 exactly in line with the last national
democratic platform upon the tariff.

Mr. Brown's Expenses.
the object or SENATOR HALE'S resolution.
It was stated in The Stab yesterday that Mr,
Hale introduced in the Senate a resolution call*,
lug upon the Postmaster General for a list of the
postmasters appointed In Maine upon the
racotnmendatioii of Mr. S. S. Brown of that
state. Mr. Brown is chairman of the state dem
ocratic committee, and a letter alleged to have
been written by him was recently published
wherein be Informed a man of his appoint
ment as postmaster, and suggested that he
might send some money here to Brown to help
pay expenses. The object of Senator Hale's
resolution, it is understood, is to ascertain
whether or not Mr. Brown ever collected any
money from persons whom he whs Instrumental
in having appointed to otfloe. it is now stated
that it was Brown who caused fgeeoud Assistant
Postmaster General Stevenson trouble very
soon after the latter took cbMge ol bis office,
by getting him to appoint as postmaster at
Center, Liucolnvilie, Maine, a man who was in
JaiL Gen. Stevenson knew nothing of the facta
and naturally accepted Brown's statements and
representations.

the establishment of a postal telegraph. Re
ferred to the committee on post offices and post
roads. In introducing the bill, Mr. Edmunds
said it was the same bill that he had introduced
at the last session ol Congress, which went
to the committee on post offices and
post roads, and was reported upon by
that committee bo late in the session
that the subject could not be considered by the
Senate before the expiration of tbe session. He
hoped the committee would nqw take the ear
liest opportunity to report on it. He wished to
press it to a vote atter reasonable discussion
and examination. It may be, he added, that,
differing from his former position on the sub
ject, he should now be willing to purchase, at
their actual value, the plants of any telegraphic
company that may wish to sell them to the
United States, not tbe value of the stock,
watered or un watered, but theaetual value ol
the material substances or things?lines, imple
ments, etc.?as such value may t>e appraised by
some tribunal in which we would have confi
dence.
Mr. Sauisbury said the committee on post
offices and post roads had at the last session
given the subject careful attention and exami
nation, and bad reported upon the bill as early
as was practicable.
Mr. Edmunds disclaimed any reflection on
the committee. The subject, was a most im
portant one and needed considerable examina
tion. The enormous power also of the opposi
tion to a scheme of this kind,and their demand
to be heard by counsel and toexaraine witnesses
and present arguments and,generally, that sort
of investigation that great corporations always
desired had the effect, whether intended or
not, to greatly delay matters before com
mittees. But now, the committee on post
offices and post roads, being in possession ot all
the history of the subject and the broad facts
Involved, they would not have to go over the
whole ground again in detail. Mr. Edmunds
expressed the desire that the subject may be
brought to a vote as early as possible.

A resolution offered by Mr.Morrlll was agreed

AND ITS PEOPLE.
Senator Ingalls, chairman of the Senate Dis

today, said that as chairman of that committee
and In the absence of any representative of the

venience in the way of berdlc lines, street rail
ways, etc., he was opposed to the occupation of
all the streets of this beautiful city for such pur
poses. He said that Massachusetts avenue
should be kept open from end to end, so that
one drive entirely through the city might be
maintained without any sort of obstruction.

A NEW RULE VCR CONGRESSIONAL PRINTING
NEEDED.
The question of devising some rule for Con
gressional printing that will d? away with the
preseat system prinirttisww number,
of each-wn without regard to Its character? sr
importance is an important one. Lnder the
Cresent system tens ot thousands of printed
ills, mostly of a private nature, go to waste,
while the supply of bills of general Importance
usually runs out before the demand is halt ^up

the subject under consideration and will en

SENATOR GORMAN
has more callers at the Senate chamber than
any other member ol the body. During Mr.
Blaine's service in the Senate he was visited by
a largei*iumber of persons than any other Sen
ator. Now Senator Gorman enjoys the distinc
tion of being most in demand. His visitors are
not confined to Maryland. They hail from
everv section of the Union, and as the Senator
is reputed to have influence with the adminis
tration, a-large proportion of them want his
help to get office.

EIGHT HOTRS A DAT.
Tk*CMfrM> ?T Lakor Dvtatc (kit Im
portant Question?Home tf the Delf
gate* Opposed to S?ch a BcMlatloa.
The Federation ot Labor Unions of the
United States and Canada resumed its session
this morning at Grand Army hall, and the res
olution ottered yesterday was token up, which
provides that the eight-hour rule should go into
effect on January 1 next, as provided in a reso
lution of the last oongross, and that the legis
lative committee call upon the organizations
throughout the country and inquire if they
have resolved to Inaugurate the eight-hour day
and to assist In its organization in every way.
THE FIRST SPEAKER,
Mr. Kirchner, dwelt upon the advantages to
the laboring classes of an eight-hour day tor
labor. The increase in machinery and in pop
ulation bad cau3ed a large number of working
men to remain Idle for some months in each
year. By reducing the time of labor,the demand
for laborers would increase and at the same
time superior skill and intelligence on the part
ofttie workmen would be developed. As the
hours of labor are decreased in any branch ot
labor the efficacy of the workmen is Increased,
as is declared by Mr. Brassey, the English
writer on economic subjects. The speaker be
lieved that if the manufacturers and other em
ployers were consulted, that they would accede
to the eight-hour rule. In Philedelphia. Mr.
Geo. W. Childs, the editor of the Ledger, fa
vored this movement, and he thought that as
far as the cigartnakera were concerned, whom
be represented, that they would be able to
carry the resolution into effect.
IN FAVOR or A GRADUAL CHANGE.
Mr. McAuliffe, representing the granite cut
ters. said that the members of his organization
were in favor of the eight-hour day, but they
were not in favor of so early a date as May 1st.
They were in favor of waiting and making the
change more gradually. They did not believe
that the resolution could be enforced generally
at present.
Mr. Foster, representing the labor unions of
Pbiladeldb.a, said the organizations were not
iu favor of trying to Inaugurate the eight-hour
day May 1st, as they did not believe that they
could make it apply to all branches of work,
therefore he would be obliged to oppose the
resolution.
A PROPOSED FIXE FOR WORKING OVER HOURS.
Mr. Qompers, representing the International
Cigar Makers' union of New York city, said that
hll trade suffered from the difficulties arising
from the women and children employed in this
Industry, the convict labor system and the ten
ement house labor. They bad also to contend
with the objections of the "piece men," who
thought that such a regulation was contrary to
their interests. But the principle of the elght
hour day needed no argument in its behalf. Its
importance was recognized by the best writers
on labor questions throughout the world. In
order to put this principle into active operation
and overcome the opposition of those laboring
men who were not alive to their true interests,
a tine of fifty cents for each hour worked over
eight hours would make it more expensive to
violate this regulation than to adhere to it. He
thought that an active propaganda should be
made, and he believed that by an intelligent
presentation of the matter the point could be
carried.
WOULD REDUCE THE WAGES ALSO.
J. 8. Rye. representing the Carpenters" union
of Baltimore, said that there were over 6,000
houses built In that city iast year. There are
about 2,000 carpenters, and these houses were
built in eight months; but if the eight-hour law
was In force at least two thousand houses less
would have been erected. The shorter hours
would make more work, and instead of having
idle da} s, there would be work days for the en
tire year. He believed in reducing the wages
with the hours, and instead of receiving 92.50
per day of teti honrs.they would get 92 for eight
hours. But he believed that in less than a year
the wages would go back to the old figurea.
MR. OYSTER'S IDEAS.
Mr. E. W. Oyster, of the Federation of Labor
of this city, said that the Typographical union
had secured the eight-hour day in the govern
ment and private printing offices of this city in
1808, and their idea was that it the government
set the example that private establishments
would follow. But there had always been an
attempt on tha part of the government officials
to evade this law, and he cited the case of the
new Pension building, which was con
structed .by Gen. Meigs, as an ex
ample of the evasion ot this law by. giv
ing out tha work by contract. The Federation
had given him no lnstruotioaa in tills matter,
as their policy had been to allow each t rade to
take action when they thought themselves
strong enough. For iustance. the Plasterers'
union of thla city had of their own accord in
augurated the eight-hour day, making a reduc
tion in their wages from $3.50 to their idea
being that the wages would go back to the old
figures as soon as all the idle workmen were
employed. In the opinion of the speaker ttiis
was the Important point to be gained, the em
ployment ot the Idle workmen. When there
wus plenty of labor the employer could hold
the whip over the employed. But giving em
ployment to the percentage that always existed
In every trade ot men out of work would
strengthen the workiugmen in all the branches,
and this, in his opinion, was the beneficial re- |
suit to be gained by the eight-hour day. He
then paid that even In the government printing
office there were men who worked twelve aud
lourteen and sixteen hours a day, and he
thought that the only way to prevent men
trom working this extra time was to charge a
price-and-a-half for all time over eight hours.
OPPOSED TO THE RESOLUTION.
Mr. Sbarpe, from the tailors' union, said that
he was opposed to this resolution, and bis
reasons were that In his trade a large pro
portion ot the men worked at their own
homes, and were unwilling to be restricted in
their time for completing their work, and then
again, their trade was one of seasons. People
bought clothes but twice a year, and that
brought all the work into two portions of the
year. For these reasons the eight-hour day was
impracticable lor their trade, and he was op
posed to the resolution while being in entire
sympathy with its spirit,and be hoped that the
time will come when the conditions of the
tailors' trade would be more favorable to the |
eight-hour day.
MR. GABRIEL EDMONDS^ON,
ot the carpenters' aud joluers' union, said that
this was not a legislative function, and he de
nied the right of any legislative body, not com
posed entirely of wage-workers, to dictate how
much time he must, expend in surrounding"his
home with all the comforts of life. The founda-1
tlon ot government rests In the consent of the '
governed, and If a majority ot men to be affec
ted by a law agree to it it will become by usage
a custom without surrendering any natural
right He had been instructed to vote for the I
eight-hour day, and he hoped that the resolu
tion would be adopted.
ADVANTAGES OF THE EIGHT-HOUR DAT.
Mr. Tomson, representing the tn^lea assem
bly of Chicago, said that he had received no
specific Instructions, but nearly all the organi
sations connected with the assembly had voted
in favor of the eight-hour day. and therefore
he proposed to vote for the resolutions. He
then went on to speak of the beneficial results
to worklngmen 01 the extra hours which would
be gained to them for rest and thought and
study. He maintained that the history of pro
duction showed that the shortening ot the
hours 01 labors Increased the productiveness of
labor. He believed that the opposition on the
part of capitalists to this law was for the same
reason that some ot the crowned beads of
Europe were opposed to a free and Independent
pressT It contributed to the Intelligence or the
working classes and equipped them tor the bat
tle tor their rights. He hoped that the resolu
tion would be adopted.
IS FAVOR OF THE MOVEMENT.
Mr. Green, of Louisville, who represents the
International typographical union, said that
his trade was not especially affected by this
measure, and therefore be had received no spe
cific instructions. He was, however, in favor o!
the resolution and would vote tor it. ...
Mr. Miller, of the German typographical
union, aaid that some of their men worked in
English offices and others In German, and they
therefore oould not control their trade entirely,
but as ter as possible they would endeavor to
introduce the eight lyxir day, and be thought
that they would be able to do It in the offices
over which they had control.
Mr. Gompsts took the fioor again in order to
reply to an objection which he bad heard that
the worklngman would abuse.the privilege
afforded them by the extra houre of
leisure by indulging in dissipation. He admltr
ted that same might so abuse this privilege, but
the majority would not. As may be seen any
day on the streets, the man who goes to work
at seven o'clock Is better dressed than the one
wrho goes to work at six o'clock, lite oppor
tunity tor self-Improvement which leisure gives
Is taken advantage ot, aud is seen in the ap
peara nee arid-taental habits of the men. He
thought that If the laboring ocganlmttons took
action lb this respect that it would really be
come the expression of the senti
ment of the people of the country
and have the effbet of the law. He saw
HO REASON FOR A STRIKE
In carrying oat this resolution. It provided
tor consultation with the employers, and if aomc
X them did not agree to Kthe wortcingraen could
A strike might occ ar at any time, and a* a rale
they did not amount to much, aud generally
resulted Id favor of those who asked for jus
tice.
Mr. Emrich, of Baltimore, thought that ar
rangements ougnt to be made for _
CONSULTATION WITH INPU)TtM
all through tne country. In order that united
action can be secured on their part, and which
will be a strong inducement for those to come
In who might otherwise hold back,
Mr. Oyster said that the federation was not
prepared to make this demand lu all the trades,
as onlv some of the delegates had been in
structed. but ho believed that those trades
which were prepared to enforce the eight-hour
day, should do so and the other* would come
in gradually. As far as the typographical
unions were concerned, he thought that they
could carry out this resolution, lie was not In
favor of a general strike, and thought the fed
eration had no authority to order one. It
would prove a source of great loss and distress
to the working classes aud would retard the
progress made to this end.
THE EMANCIPATION OF THE WOREINO PEOPLE
must be accomplished by themselves, and
while a law by Congress, If constitutional,
might not prove effectual, yet the organised
working classes of tlie country could make an
eight-hour day general. He offered aresolutlon
to this effect, that the legislative committee
should advise those organization* thnt were
strong enough to inaugurate the eight hour day
on the 1st 01 May. .
Mr. Hugo Miller sa*d that tliey had enough ot
resolutions. What was wanU'd "now was act ton.
and he therefore called for the adoption of the
resolution to inaugurate the eight hour day ou
the 1st of May.
AMENDMENTS.
The secretary read the resolutions, and atten
tion was called to the word "physically" in the
sentence that the legislative committee aid
physically the organizations in carrying out the
objects of the resolution*: and it was stated
that the word was placed there inadvertently,
und It was stricken out.
Mr. Edmonsion offered an amendment which
provided that a thorough canvass should l>e
made ih the respective trades for the purpose ot
securing the co-operation of as many as possible
in carrying out the resolution. Adopted.
Mr. Gompers offered an amendment that re
ports were to be s?'nt to the secretary as soon as
possible after.May 1st the result of the carrying
out of this resolution.
THE RESOLUTION REFERRED MACE.
Before a final vote was taken upon the resolu
tion it was explained that Its adoption did not
compel any organization which did not feel
stroug enough to carry into operat Ion the eight
hour law. The intention was not to force a
strike or to compel organizations to do.what
they did not feel able to do. With this under
standing, it was said that all the delegates were
in iavor ot the resolution. It was thought that
the resolution in the preseut form <tid not con
vey this intention as clearly as it should, and
the resolution, with amendments, were re
lerred to the committee on resolutions tor re
vision, to report at the meeting this afternoon.
The federation then adjourned until 2 o'clock.

him since Mouduy last, on the ground that he
is an insane person. Mr. H. W. Garnett ap
peared for the petitioner, and Mr. II. E. Davis
for the respondent. Major Dye.
Mr. Davis said that for waiitof time they had
prepared no formal return, but would do so.
and stated the provisions of law as to Uie adl
mission ot pat ?euLs to the Government lusaue
asylum. (Section 1844 It. S., U. S.j
THE LAW IN TI1E CASE.
Chief Justice Cartter said the court had de
cided such cases?an appeal having been taken
to the General Term, which sustained him?
that the Maryland law must bo followed. He
held that tlie regulations read were gotten up
m deference to the military authorities.
Mr. Davis said that they proposed to make a
return that the petitiotier had beeu heretofore
in tins asylum as iusane, and that he was al
lowed to leave on a sort of ti?ke( of leave. He
had returned to the District aud the attention
of the authorities called to the lact, hence his
arrest.
The court said that the law quoted 'Sec. 48141
did not apply to this case, and the court hud
discharged a party.
Mr. Davis said, in answer to the court, that
they propped to institute proceedings at once
under the Maryland law.
Mr. Garuett said that this man waf released
from the asylum on the theory that he would
be sane any where else thau in the District, and
on returning here he was at once taken in cus
tody. He denied that there was anv evidence
that he was dangerous or had done aught to
warrant his arrest.
ALLEGED HOMICIDAL MANIA.
Mr. Davis said that they were informed that
Mr. Miller had the homicidal mania, and the
subjects of his mania were in the District.
The court said that it might be very wronz
lor a court to let such a part v go, but in this
ease the presumption was in iavor of the peti
tioner, who had been at large a year. He said
that he would like to be eiiiightened as to the
question of peril. If it was stated that there
was danger in allowing him to go at large he
would not enlarge him. Was there pressing
peril in allowing him to go at large?
Lieut, Kelly said he had had him in custody
since Tuesday evening, and did not consider
bun a subject to be locked up. He tonud him
a perfectly sensible man, aud aid not think
him harmful.
DR. GOODING'S STATEMENT.
Dr. Godding, superintendent oi the Govern
ment Iusane asylum, stated that Miller, an
agent oi the quartermaster's department, was
admitted, by order of the Secretary of War on
January 22d. 1882, a?d discharged on Novem
ber 24th, 1882. He returned JulV :td lf?8*5
and was discharged Augu>t UOth,1^84,with the
condition that his friends would provide for
him elsewhere. Subsequently he was given
letters iroiu Miller and lie w.is asked as to his
read mission and he advised that that could be
done through the-police.
MR. MILLER'S STATEMENT.
Mr. Miller said thaton the 3d of July, 1883,
he had been at Driver's garden, and when he
had got nearly homo he was seized by two
policemen, who said that his wife did not"want
him in the house. * He was taken to the Massa
chusetts avenue station and used very roughlv
then taken to police headquarters, and then io
the asylum, and remained a little over a year
On his return from Portland.Oregon.he stooned'
friends and
left the latter city Sunday cveuiug. Arriving
here he was accosted by an officer and arrested
fj? . th? statlon. where be learned
that his mends were apprehensive as u> his
safety.
Mr. Davis asked If he did not write, in Feb
ru*ry last, threatening violence to the republic.
Witness denied it, and said there was a griev
ance, and he simply meant that he was willing
to let God's will be done. UUC
MILLER'S DELUSION.
Dr. Godding here said thfct Miller's delusion
was that voices were suggesting to him that
President Arthur should be shot, and that it
was a conspiracy to throw the government Into
the hands of the democratic party, and that
Senator Davis, of West Virginia/was at the
bottom ot it. He said that be was continually
resisting the impulses. He having purchased
pistols and having an idea that his neighbor
was a dangerous man. he was remanded to the
hospital? Finally, after his promise not to carry
a pistol and the statement to him that Ifbe
could find work elsewhere It would be benefi
