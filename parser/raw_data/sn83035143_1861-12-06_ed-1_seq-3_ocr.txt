TRAVELERS' REGISTER. THE CITY.
Tib&ieli Cabpawt. Th alarm of fire
ahaut half-past nine o'clock last night wu
occasioned by th explosion of a can of car
bon oil at the home of Henry Knipp, m
German, on Hamilton (treet, near Clinton,
and which resulted In the death of Mr.
Kulpp. W could learn but few fact in re
lation to the matter, the greatest excite
ment prevailing among the crowd that rap
idly assembled at the scene of the unfortu
nate catastrophe, and the to suddenly be
reaved husband, th only one present, so
far u w could learn, at the time of the fa
tal occurrence, being of course in no condi
tion to furnish Information if it war asked.
It seem apparent, however, that air. E.
was in the act of filling a lighted lamp from
the can, and that permitting the flam to
come too close to the oil, the latter was ig
nited. The top wu blown off the can, and
those who saw th body before It wu re
moved, are of opinion from a heavy
bruise over the eye, that she mast
hsv received severe blow from
it. We were also Informed that
the right ey wu dislodged from the socket,
and thrown out on to th cheek, but by
what means we cannot conjecture. Her
right hand, in which she held the can, was
burned to a crisp, and her body from the
shoulders to the waist frightfully charred.
So far u we oould ascertain no one arrived
at the house while the unfortunate woman
wu alive, though several ware there within
ten minutes, at most, after the explosion,
so that death must have occurred almost
instantly.
This adds-another warning to the thous
ands of similar terrible import against the
criminally areleu ns of oombustibl oils.
Very little injury wu done to the furniture,
and no action on the part of the Fir De
partment was found necessary upon its
reaching the house, which it did in few
minutes after the alarm wu given.

he will be successlul in his efforts. The

Artemus Ward's First Lecture in Massachusetts.
. ebBaetia.
Artemus has fairly entered the leolur
field, and is doing wall in fact, receives th
unqualified eommendation of sharp-eyed
critic. ' Wcopy from th Boston Transcript
th following notio of Brown's lecture In
Newbury port. Th lectur field wu new
one' to him, and It is no disparagement to
him that many of hi friends Joined in the
fear expressed In this artio'e, but praise
from the Transoript is enough to eilen all
doubt i . . j ' .
Dr. Johnson says that a man who hu the
reputation of a wit hu th most difficult of
all roUt to play, for expectation Is on tip-toe,
and every one whispers, "Her eomes the
witty man listen." Woe be to such an
one if reputation precedes him, and ha falls
oeiow the unreasonaoie anticipations, air.
Charles F. Brown ("Artemus Ward"), u a
satirical writer, is, in some respects, unsur
passed, and when it wu announced that the
great popularity of his peculiar writings
hsd caused Lyceum Committees to force
him into th lectur field, there were
aanr who feared that he who had sway
ed them with magical pen of Momus,
would Berbers fail to charm tnem with
his voioe. Such may lay aside all their
fears. His first appearance in Massachu
setts lut night was a -complete success 'in
manner, in matter, and in the effect pro
duced upon a large and refined audience.
Itwu before the Newbury port Lyceum that
he began his many engagements in our
Commonwealth.
Mr, Brown is a young man, only twenty
five year of age, of a pleasant, presentable
appearance, with a voice which is not only
musical, but exceedingly clear in lis tone.
His manner wu perfectly easy, and from
the beginning to tb end of his lecture
which wu just one hour in length he held
his audieoc rivetted br his delicate sattire
and plain truths, or he convulsed them with
laughter. His subject he modestly styled
in a letter u "some cneeriui paragrapns,
but it wu a aeries of well digested thoughts
and happy hits, concerning various types in
society, via t The people who rise to emi
nence by predilection for their pursuits
the politician, the officj seeker ) the literary
young man who hai been "oi ushed the
reformer who are opposed to soap and
water, ruors and hot bread ; the very small
portion of the loyal North whose livers are
white) u milk t who. to quote Mr. Brown,
"blandly babble of peace when there is no
pease, and can De none until reDetuen is ut
terly crushed. Thev sneakingly hint at
compromise, even while the red knife of the
foe is searching lor the nesrt oi me rtepuD
lie :" the absurd people (this part wu ex
ceedingly amusing) ; the people who owe
money; th family tyrant) the young la
dies and matrimonial qualifications.
As already said, the lecture wu a oomplete
success, and the close attention and manl
iest approbation or tne large audience as
sembled on on of the most nn pleasant
night of the season, testified to his power
as a writer aad public speaker. The spirit
of the whole lecture may b inferred from
the opening passage : "I will itateupon
th verv threehhold of this little paper
home, which I have built, that it Is a cold
collation rather than a steaming banquet
which awaits you within. I can only offer
some scrap of salad, a few pic nic relishes,
and it may be a little whipped cream. But
you are very welcome. The lecture field
has been plouenea, planted ana aug ; mow-
eg and raked ; sowed and reapt ; and culti
vated indeed, in so many ways, that I sup
pose that a man of very able mind might
not feel too sare of offering you anything
strikingly novel or brilliant. Oblige me,
then, by overlooking the shortcomings of a .
person who hu no such thing as an able
mind. I have tried, however, to make these
paragraphs cheerful in th main. Some of
them, indeed, may border on the farcical,
but I make no apology for that; The fool
with his can and bells often deals Folly its
deadliest blows."
We are elad to learn that Mr. Brown lee-
tures in Salem on Wednesday, and in Bos
ton on Friday of next week.
Litibaiv. Ticknor A- Fields, Boston,
have supplied th Eastern Press with the
early sheets of th voluma of Sir Thomu
Browne's writings, which is spoken of u a
most exquisite specimen of American print
ing. The work contains in one volume the
"Beligio Medici," "Christian Morals," "Let
ters to a Friend," "Urn Burial," "Letters to
his Children," "Fragment on Mummies,"
"Dreams," "Besolves," and extracts from
"Vulgar Errors' and the "Garden of Cyius."
Th biography of Sir Thomu is by Mr.
Fields, who, u editor of th work, dedicates
it most happily "To Oliver Wendell Holmes,
M. D.. author of the 'Autocrat of the Break
fast Table, and John Brown, M. D., author
of 'Bab and his Friends,' this volume of the
eloquent writings of an old English physl
oian is inscribed."

Aa Ivfobtaht PaxsiirrnntT. Those un
mitigated publle nuisances, uys th N. Y.
Tribune, the "Concert" and "Music" Halls,
with their immodest dances, vulgar songs,
poisonous liquors, "pTetty waiter-girls," and
incentives to lust and debauchery, have at
attracted the notice of the Grand Jury, and
been presented. Commencing, u all great
sins and sin-breeding shows usually do, in
a very small way, the evil hu spread to
such an extent that Broadway, from the
Park to Union square, is lined with these
horrible dens of iniquity, and our youth is
offered enticements at every step. The
amount of irreparable injury that these
Music Halls have already inflicted on the
rising generation of boys oan hardly be e
timated, but there oan b no question but
that many future criminals will date their
first tep in vie from their visit to these
shtmeless places of drunkenness and pros
titution.

A comical view of th game of cricket I
given in on of the journals of Lisbon, Por
tugal: The English residents at Lisbon and
Oporto have each a cricket club, and the
rivalry between them led to a match, which
wu played recently at Lisbon. The Portu
guese editor wu sadly puzsled in attempting
to describe a scene which wu novel to him.
He explains it for the beneht of tne Deiog
ged Portuguese in this fashion : "Th object
of the formation of theae societies is the
playing of the game of cricket maton, an
active running, driving, jumping game,
which only can be played by a person hav

Artemus Ward's First Lecture in Massachusetts. Startling Report---Increase of Threat and
Chest Diseases.
Th City Sexton reports a fearful iner
In th bills of mortality. There war 107
death la th city during th put month
(November) 14 mors than during October,
and 47 more than November, 1880. Of this
number upwards ot fifty, or nearly oiu-Kalf
of th whole number of death wsr from
some form of lung or throat disease t The
mortality, therefore, by throat and lung af
fectionsmostly inflamatory diseases is
almost or quite equal to th number of death
by &' at xr disease i
What a suuing fact is this for reflection I
There is an alarming lnoreas in lung and
throat difficulties in this section of th coun
try, and sll should seek to protect them
Hive from such diseases. Thos who
are now suffering from colds, coughs, uth-
ma, throat eomplsints, hoarseness, bron
chitis, spitting blood, night sweat, general
debility, and consumption, should call
upon Dootor Ayer, at the Weddell, whose
utonishing success is everywhere re
marked. ' The Dootor' rooms are thronged
daily. Hi prices are very reasonable and
th afflicted can rely upon receiving candid
opinions. Th Doctor hu the most com
plete Instruments for making accurate ex
amination in every ease. The system of
practice is unlike that of all other praoti
tioners and i th result of long year of
careful research. Dr. Ayer wu regularly
eduoated at Harvard university and hu
diplomas from two colleges in Cincinnati
where for year he hu had charge of a
Lung Institute, and what I better than all,
hu the Psorn's diploma for wonderful suo-
eesaevsn In eases that have defied every
other mod of practice. When it is con
sidered that from catarrh, throat com
plaints, colds, 4o., fatal consumption is so
very often developed, it is th part of pru
dence to make immediate application lor
th ours of these trouble to Dos tor Ayer
who give his JoZe attention, to such com
plaints and certain other chronic disease.
Investigation oost nothing and surely the
Dootor hu permission to refer to very ma

elsewhere. Thos who intend to call "by
