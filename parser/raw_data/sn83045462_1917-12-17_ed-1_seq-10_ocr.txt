Executive Committee Meets.
The executive committee of the gen
eral campaign committee met today at
1 p.m. One o fthe important things to
be taken up, according to Rev. Dr.
James E. Walker, Mr. Sunday's "ad- i
vance man," is the question of an ade
quate and suitable house for the Sun
day party, which will number fourteen.
Owtng to the crowded conditions here
this is a phase of difficulty never be
fore encountered in the campaigns in
other places. As a final resort, Dr.
Walker says the party may have to be
divided In order to obtain the necessary
accommodations. The party will arrive
at 4:45 p.m. January 5, the day before
the campaign opens. Billy is now at
Winona Lake, Ind., recuperating from
the Atlanta campaign.
Tonight there will be a meeting of
th? personal workers, representing
each co-operating church, in the First
Congregational Church, at which the
church members to help in campaign
work will be listed. Rev. Lucius
Clark, chairman, will preside. Tomor
row night at the tabernacle, which will
be completed during the present week,
the "key men" in charge of the differ
ent detachments of ushers will meet
for instruction, with Dr. Walker, H. S.
Omohundro, chairman and chief usher,
and the heads in charge of each "divi
sion** of ushejs. The necessary 446
ushers and doorkeepers themselves will
not be at this meeting, but will have
their first big drill and instruction
night December 27.

German Mutinies.

lfore trouble In the enemy naval
fwees ia reported. It Is a curious thing
that discontent In a military nation
usually appears first in the navy. The
Boaaian navy is the latest example of
tbla. the mutinies on the Black sea
warships being the first serious fore
runners of successful revolutionary
flttvemants. Why this should be true
ia sot clear. But possibly it Is due to
the fact that a warship is a separate
unit: and that, once a crew Is organ
ised for trouble. It can pretty well pur
sue its own course. From the outside
It would seem as If a post on the Kiel
fleet would be about as tempting a po
sition aa exists today in the armed
forces of Germany. There la a mini
mum of danger and a maximum of lel

AMENDMENT PROPOSED
TO EXCESS PROFITS LAW
Difficulties Arise From Borrowed
Money, Good "Will, Patents
and Copyrights.
Amendment of the excess profits law
to broaden the definition of "invested
capital" by including: certain earning
assets will be recommended this week
by the excess profits advisory commit
tee, and the recommendation probably
will be transmitted to Congress by
Secretary McAdoo.
Members of the committee, after sev
eral weeks' study of the law, have
I come to the conclusion that it is quite
: impossible to remedy apparent injus
tices which would develop under the
measure by executive rulings.
At the top of the list of difficult situ
ations to be met stand the questions of
allowance for borrowed money invest
ed in a business, for value of good will,
patents and copyrights and other in
tangible assets, and for depreciation.
Many companies with small capital,
doing business largely on borrowed
money, have complained that under the
excess profits provision their earnings
would be taxed almost at a confiscatory
rate, while other concerns with equal
| assets and earnings, but without bor_
rowed money, would take a lower rate
of tax.
Failure of the law to provide for set
ting a capital figure on good will has
led to many complaints, particularly
from newspapers and other publications
with plant and equipment of relatively
small value, but large earnings based
principally on good will.
Despite the tangle and injustices
?which might develop from the law as it
stands, the excess profits advisers be
lieve it is workable in the main, and
will propose regulations to make it so.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS
COMMENDED IN ITALY
Mr. Wilson's Words Offset Gloom
Created by the Situation
in Russia.
BY TAXCRED ZAXGHKRI.
Cablegram to The Evening: Star and
Chicago Dally New?. Copyright, 1017.
MILAN, Italy, December 17.?Many of
the newspapers are still devoting
much space to President Wilson's re
cent message to Congress, which they
say effaces the gloomy impression cre
ated by the Russian situation. They
point out that the economic, moral and
military power of America much more
than compensates for the loss of Rus
sia. II Secolo of this city says the
President talks rather with the sober
deliberation of a judge than in the
language of a combatant.
"Mr. Wilson," it says "is truly a judge
who is never blind and who proclaims
the justice of the allies, cause while
rejecting imperialism even on the part
of the victors.''
With regard to Austria it is pointed
out here that the populations of the
dual empire have shown in innumer
able ways that they aspire to seces
sion and not to federation, while the
government in Vienna is determined
to smother completely the will of the
people. 11 Secolo concludes that this
American sympathy for Austria should
make Italians appreciate the fact that
Mr. Wilson took a most opportune mo
ment to act.
The Corriere della Sera says:
"It does not matter much if Mr. "Wil
son appears not. to comprehend the
enormous responsibility of Austria,
which by military force has denied
every national right, for the Presi
dent's main idea is that it is essentia^
to vanquish Germany?a point on*
which he is effectively exact."
It is rather remarkable that Italian
opinion is not yet well acquainted wi$h
Mr. Wilson's views concerning a league
of nations after the war. The people
here will doubtless receive the plan
with enthusiasm when it is thoroughly
explained to them.
Flower Tones.
From the Los Angeles Times.
We hear more and more about the
form and color of musical sounds and
tone combinations. First thing you
know we will all be seeing music in
stead of hearing it, and the critics will
be writing about Winkemflunk's sym
phony in blue and Flingemosky's pur
ple sonatas. Great pianists will hurl
mountains of floral beauty at their au
diences, and the master violinist will
waft sweet lilies and lilacs of sound
across the footlights. Birds will cease
to warble and will start to painting.
The skylark's note will become a cord
of gold connecting earth and heaven,
and the poet will refer to the mocking
bird's medley as an exquisite rainbow
of song.
See Who's Here.
From Judgo.
She?The man I marry must be bold,
but not audacious; handsome as Appol
lo. yet industrious as Vulvan; wise
as Solomon, but meek as Moses?a man
all women would court, yet devoted to
only the one woman.
He?How lucky we met!

Device Detects Metal in Wounds.
Detection of metal in "wounds by
means of a new telephonic device is
described in dispatches to the Depart
ment of Commerce. The instrument is
! moved over the body of the patient and
[emits a humming- noise when over a
shrapnell ball or shelt splinter, and is
further used in guiWing a probe to
ward the hidden metal. Whether the
metal is magnetic and can be with
drawn by an electromagnetic without
the use of an incision also can be told
by the instrument.
