TO HEAR SPEAKER AFAR.
Plan to Install Microphones in Leg

[From Th» Tribune Bureau. ]
Washington, Dec. <>.— Experiments are being
made at the Capitol with an electrical micro
phone, with a view to the possible installation
of the instrument for use in connecting the two
legislative chambers with the new office build
ings, so that Senators and Representatives may
listen to the debates even when out of the
chamber. Through disks attached, respective
ly, to the desks of the Vice-President of the
Senate and of the Speaker of the House, it is
purposed to convey the sound from either legis
lative chamber by wires to the committee rooms
in the new buildings, where they would con
nect with telephone receivers.
The suggestion that such an Invention may be
practicable has occasioned a good deal of amuse
ment and interest. Congressmen say that it
■will relieve them of much worry and trouble, as
they will be able to find out just When to be on

NEW-YORK. FRIDAY. DErKMBKR 7. l'MMi. -FOURTEEN PAGES- '.V-*. PRICE THREE CENTS.
SC'II IFF MAKES A STIIi.
SPEAKS OS CALL LOANS,
Asks for Investigation of Stock Ex
change Practices -Money Tight.
Jacob H. Schitf created ■> stir at the meeting
of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday by mo*
ing for an Inquiry into exorbitant Interest rates
on call loans on the New York Stock Exchange.
In his argument for such an inquiry he asserteJ
that a prominent banking institution made c
practice of calling Its loans on mornings when
the rate of interest was low, and waiting until
the rate went up before lending more money.
This practice, he said, forced up the rate.
The resolution of Mr. Schiff came as a sur
prise as he got up in the meeting and read it
himself, as follows:
Resolved, That it be referred to the Commit
tee on Finance and Currency to examine Into
and report upon the practicability of devising
measures through which the interest rate be
yond <» per Lent upon call loans made at the
New York Stock Exchange can be better regu
lated than is the case at present.
The resolution was passed with much applause
after Mr. Schiff said:
We find ourselves again In the midst of condi
tions as to call loans at the New York Stock
Exchange which are nothing less than bar
barous. While at times, under existing methods
and conditions, money is liable to advance be
yond the legal rate of interest, I cannot for a
moment believe that it is necessary for the rate
of interest on demand loans at the Stock Ex
change to advance on a single day from 6 to 7
per cent. . in the morning to '_'•"> or 30 per cent,
and higher in the afternoon. It must be in the
long run destructive of the best Interests of the
country, and there must he means, even If they
are difficult to find, to regulate such a state of
affairs. Such means may be actual methods or
moral methods.
It Is stated, for Instance, and I do not hesitate
to say so. because it is stated with much em
phasis, that one of the prominent financial in
stitutions in this city which is a large loaner of
money makes it a rule, when money in the
morning is only H or 7 per cei^t. to call its loans
and to wait until the rate has advanced, which
It naturally does In consequence of large calls, to
consent to loan its money again.
Such methods are reprehensible, "and ought to
be corrected by moral pressure and moral
means; but there must be actual means, which,
possibly. Is the Clearing House, and possibly the
Stock Exchange itself. I believe that the com
mittee on Finance and Currency, If it looks into
the question, can suggest something which v>
some extent at least will, e*en if the present
condition cannot be greatly Improved, improve
it to some extent.
It waa said by several bankers that the insti
tution referred to by Mr. Schiff waa one of the
bie trust companies.
Mr. P'hiff's speech hefore the Chamber of
Commerce last January on money market con
ditions precipitated a mild panic, hut his re
marks yesterday were without appreciable ef
fect on stock pries. In his January' aidres?. he
said in part:
We have witnessed during the last sixty days
conditions which are nothing less than a dis
grace to any civilized country. Other countries
have had a wider speculation than the United
State?, in Prance, In Germany, In England,
speculation is rampant, and has been rampant
at all times, at certain periods, and still you
have never seen the money market for sixty
days in su'-h a condition that rates have varied
all the way from I<> to 11!." per cent. I say that
is a disgrace to a civilized community. There
must be a cause for it. and we all know the
cause. The cause is in "ur insufficient circu
lating medium or the insufficient elasticity of our
circulating medium. If this condition of things Is
not changed, and changed s<>on. we will get a
panic in this country compared with which the
thr^e which have preceded it would l>e only
child's pkiy. Ther«' is no disaster Boon upon us,
but this is fhe time to prepare for It.
Thf president of one of the largest trust com
panles, wh^n asked for his opinion of the practl
cability of Mr. Bchlffs suggestion for regulation
of th>- call money rate, said:
In the old days, before the st^te in its Wisdom
saw fit to change the Usury law by removinsr
the limit to the rat- of Interest which could
!••■ charged for the use of call money, it
was not :<n unusual thing for 'i or \ per cerit.
or even 1 per cent, a day to ii^ charged for call
loans. If an agreement r.uch as Mr. Schiff sug
£p S ! S should be entered into by the- Clearing
institu'ion* we should again see. I be
rates similar to those prevailing when the
state restriction was In force. When money Is
In demand borrower* will pay for It what they
tmi^-t. The Underlying cause of the tightness of
money is the Sub-Treasury system, under which
pold and legal tenders, the vitals of credit, ar*
withdrawn from circulation.
President Pomroj of the Stock Exchange
said that he had heard that a pumber of bankx
un>\ trust companies were it', the habi! of manip
ulating call money rates in tiie manner de-
Brribed by Mr Schiff, but that he dtd not know
whether or not the charges wera true. Th*»
Stock Exchange authorities, he said, would glad
;> co-operate with the Clearing Hou»e in any
possible way with the object of checking th^
wide fluctuations in rates
"There seems to be enough money to go
around." he added, "for the brokers always
manage to pet accommodations at some rate or
other, and apparently the money is there,
whether it Is loaned at ."» per cent at one time
of <lay or -'< per cent a' another, and we would
only be too glail to assist in any movement to
establish ;es« violent fluctuations. Thus far we
have been unable to devise any plan for so
doing."
The prevailing: Judgment of the bankers asked
to comment on Mr. S> hlff\= address wns that no
restrictive agreement could be effected in end
ing: the pr»»s»M'T condition of occasional violent
fluctuation in ih» call money rate. The opening
vn\f yesterday was !."•» per cent, at which figure
most of th* day's loan* were arranged. The
high level of the day was I>V»1 >V » p p r cent, and
th»- last loan placed was at 2*» per cent. At the
dose of the market, it is said, as much as Ho per
cent whs bid. but no funds were available for
loaning.
The stringency in time money Increased yes
terday, loans being placed at these figures:
Bixty-day money, B*4 per cent; ninety days. 8
per cent: four and five months. 7 per cent: six
months. <*»i... per cent. The legal rate of interest
for time loans is 6 per cent, but in tight mar
li<>is a ' commission" Is also paid by the bor
rower. The stock market yesterday was In

Two Alleged Uptown Tenement
Firebug*" A netted.
Shortly after 1 o'clock this morning tie police
of the West lOftth street station arrested two
young men charged .with being auspicious per
sons. The specific charge, the police say. Is that
of setting fire to five five story tenement houses
near Amsterdam and Columbus avenues and
IC5d street between '.• o'clock last night and
12:45 o'clock this morning
The lives of more thai one hundred persona
were endangered short:/ after midnight this
morning in another fire :,\ the five-story apart
ment house at No. .<•»» West 101 st street, which
the polk* are certain was of incendiary origin,
but say they are net sure had any connection
with the other fires. The firemen carried out
more than a dozen women and children, and
many others escaped by the fire escapes of the
house. Fearing that they could not control the
{lames, the firemen who first arrived turned in a
second alarm. The first floor of the building
and the basement were ruined, and the aparr
menta on the second floor were badly damaged.
W hen it was learned in the neighborhood that
the fire v as of an incendiary origin the tenants
were thrown Into a state of terror. The ma
jority of persona for several blocks around re
fused to go to th*tr beds, preferring to stay up
rather than run th? risk of being burned to
death.
Almost everj house in the neighborhood had
some on'- of the tenants stationed a! the lower
BoArs as a safeguard.
The fire was dip. overed by Patrolman Martin.
of thr West I«»ith street station, who was stand
ing at the corner of Inls? street and Amsterdam
avenue. He saw flames shooting from the base
ment, which is occ upied by Charles Beale as a
fruit and vegetable store.
Th<» patrolman turned in an alarm and then
hurried to the house. He placed his shoulder
against the door leading to the basement and
fon <■■'! it open.
According to the police, a window in the base
in* lit had been broken mid cloth and paper satu
rated with oil h;id been thrown Into the store.
The patrolman pressed several men into ser
vice nrid ordered them to go through the build
i:ig and arouse every person in the house. Pa
trolman Martin then hurried to the flre escapes
arid let down the ladders from the second floor
to the street.
When the ladder had been lowered the engines
on the first alarm arrived. Patrolman Martin
was suffering from the effects of the smoke, but
he stayed at the window on the second floor and
helped women and children in the building to
descend the fire escape.
A Mrs Haskln. who lives on the third floor,
fainted from the effects of the smoke. Patrol
man Martin heard of it. and. leaving a man to
help the women on the fire escape, hurried to
the third floor and carried the woman out.
When the firemen arrived they found more
than a score of persons crowded around th«.
windows unable to get out upon the flre escape
because of ihe crowd. They erected several
ladders to other windows and took about a score
The prisoners are John Stace. twenty years
old, a plasterer, of No. 105 West 100 th street,
and Joseph Glasser. sixteen years old, of No.

The first of the fires which these men are
thought to have been connected with occurred at
5:4.". o'clock. ! n the five story brick tenement
house, a: No. 212 "West 10T>th street, where rub
bish in the cellar was discovered to be burning,
and extinguished with slignt damage.
The second flre was at 11:35 o'clock, in the
basement of the five story brick tenement house,
at No. Sf>s Columbus avenue. This flre was
extinguished \« ith slight damage.
The third fire was discovered at the same
time. 11.33 o'clock, in the five story tenement
house, at No. M.» Columbus avenue. A blaze

police say. will be about $7** l

RUIS AFTER EXPLOSIOS.
Boiler B lores Up in West Lynn,
Mass — Eleven Injured.
Lynn. Mass. Dec. %. — Explosion, followed by
quickly spreading flre. brought disaster to West
Lynn to-day and scarred the manufacturing
district nt that place. Eleven persons were in
jured and the loss of property exceeds a half
million dollars. The Insurance amounts to
$3o". ( »00. The cause of the disaster was the
blowing up of an imperfect boiler In the four
story wooden factory of the P. J. Harney Shoe
Manufacturing Company The flre which Imme
diately broke out destroyed the Harney plant,
and extended so rapidly t<> nearby structures
that fourteen buildings were consumed befo r?
the flre was checked by firemen from Lynn,
Boston. Salem and Saugus. Of the injured per
sons only one is in a dangerous condition.
Had the flre swept through the factory dis
trict at an hour when the employes were at
work It is thought a terrible loss of life would
have resulted. The explosion, however, occurred
just before the operatives were due at the vari
ous factories. In the list of injured are some of
those who arrived before the usual hour, and
who cscspnd with difficulty. In addition to the
Harney company, whose loss is placed at
Ja.to.i.nrt. the heaviest loss was sustained by the
Tufts A Frlendman Shoe Company. The latter
company loses about 1150.000. a dozen small
wooden dwelling houses and the West Lynn sta
tion of the Boston ft Maine Railroad, situated
near the burning factories, wars food for the
flames.
Persistent reports reached the polics that sev
eral persons employed In the factories were
missing, but all those whose names were re
ported as missing have been accounted for.

SHAW MAY RETIRE FEU.
\ ' v Ambassador Wanted in Russia
Before the Duuma Meets.
[From Tb» Tribune K«r-«u I
Washington. Dec. il— Considerable surprise
was occasioned in the Senate when the nomi
nations of the new members of the Cabinet were
received, for. although the proposed changes
had been announced, it was understood that the
retirement of Secretary Shaw, his succession by
Georpe B. Cortelyou and the latter- succession
by George yon L. Meyer would not take place
until about March -1. It is now regarded as»
entirely probable, however, that those changes
will take place a month earlier than was a
first expected. The Russian Dumua will meet
about March 1. and it is regarded as advisable'
that th" new ambassador who Is to succeed Mr.
Meyer should have been at his post at least a
month before that in order that he may have
become familiar with conditions in St. Peters
burg before the meeting of the national con
gress.
For that reason it is believed probable that
Mr. Shaw will retire from the Cabinet abour
February I and that he will be immediately
succeeded by Mr. OOftctjnMa, Mr. Meyer then
entering the Cabinet as p.-stmaster General,
thus making way for his successor to present
his credentials at the Winter Pa.a- ■*.
Kl\( LIKES MR. WHITE.I
Report That He Is Persona Son :
Grata in Italy Untrue.
[From The Tribune Bureau. 1
Washington. Dec. 6. — It was asserted to-day j
by a dose friend of the President that there Is '
not the slightest foundation for the report that
Henry White, United States Ambassador to
Italy, has been found persona non grata by th* ,
Italian government, the reverse being preemi
nently true. Not only is Mr. "White entirely i
agreeable to the Italian King, but his Ambassa
dor to the United States called at the White |
House to express the grave regret of his sover
eign over the decision of the President to trans- j
fer Mr. White to Paris.
Mr. White has been the recipient of special
courtesies at the hands of the King, who has
demonstrated for the Ambassador more than |
usual regard.
Mr. White, who is now in Washington, will re- ,
turn to Rome in the near future, and will remain
there until about March 1. There is not th« J
slightest truth in the report that Mr. White *
omitted from the number of those to whom he J
extended Invitations to his first reception any j
person whose name appeared on the court list. j
TO RESTRICT SUBSIDIES.
Mr. Grosvenor's Com promise May
Lead to Passage of Bill.
'From Th» Tr!hur.« Bureau.}
Washington. Dec. 6.— The plight of the Ship i
Subsidy advocates in the House was shown to- j
day, when at a meeting of the Committee en
Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Chairman Gros- j
venor announced that rather than have no leg- j
islation at this session he was willing greatly to j
modify the Galllnger subsidy bill by striking ;
out subsidies for transatlantic and African !
steamship lines, thus confining the government ,
aid to Oriental and South American -lines. The j
suggestion was earnestly discussed by members !
of the committee, and apparently made an im- I
pression on those members who have opposed ;
the bill in its present shape. It Is expected that
the compromise offered by Chairman Grosvenor ,
will win the necessary number of votes, so that |
the measure in revised form may be reported to
the House. The absence of two of the members
of the committee. McDermott. of New Jersey, ;
and Flack, of New York, who are likely to be
away much of the session because of sickness, i
complicates matters, so that the outlook for the !
bill Is by no means certain.
No vote was taken on the measure to-day.
The meeting was characterized as a conference
for the exchange of views, but It Is realized that
Chairman Grosvenor's move to-day is an mdi- i
cation of the weakness of the ship subsidy ad
vocates, who admit that it will be difficult to get j
legislation at this session. If a modified bill is j
passed, it would have to go to conference- j
with the Senate. In Its changed form the Gal- !
linger bill, which alre.-dy has passed the Senate. '
will conform to the ■-.ip subsidy recommenda- j
tion made by Secretary Root In his Kansas City
speech, and later by the President In his mes
sage.

XO TREATY WITH JAPAN
uns w.ir aloxb.
Likely to Restrict Emigration —
tatiun Source of Danger.
[ From The Trllunc Bureau. 1
Washington. Dec. C—Xo new treaty --wee«
the United Statts and Japan is un<!er contem
plation, no negotiations looking to it u«v.- treati
es iii progress an. l m> modification of the exist
ing treaty in II • immediate future is regarded
as probatle. This may be asserted on the high
est authority.
Officlals of the administration In "Washington
have been informed that Japan may. of her own
volition and on her own initiative, take stag*
to prevent those of her subjects who belong to
the laboring class from emigrating: to this coun
try, but were the United Stares to attempt to
force such a step. It would unquestionably
arouse opposition in Japan ar.d possibly defeat
the ends of the Japanese government. Japan, In
restricting emigration, has its own ends to serve.
chief among these being the diversion of those
of her citizens who leave her shores from that
I'nited States to Corea and Manchuria. Should
Japanese adopt this course, It is probable ah©
would suggest to the United States the advisa
bility of restricting in the same way emigration,
from the United States to Japan, could that b*
done without making it the subject of a treaty^
CALIFORNIANS CAUSE SURPRISE.
That portion of the President's message lsMala
related to the treatment of Japanese subjects
In the United States was cabled to foklo by th*
Japanese Ambassador, and proved most gratify
ing to the Japanese government and people.
That it should so have aroused the members of
the California delegation In Congress is the oc
casion of the greatest surprise to its author and
to other officials of the administration. It is re
garded as almost inconceivable that Intelligent
members of Congress should as thoughtlessly
have construed the President words as to sup
pose that his reference to the use- of "the. civil
and military forces" to protect the rights of tho
Japanese on the Pacific Coast referred to tha
admission of Japanese pupils to the public
schools. That question must be dealt with by
the Judiciary, as was clearly Indicated by tha
administration some time before th« message
was sent to Congress, when It submitted tha
facts to the Department of Justice, -with a re
quest that such legal action be taken as the legal
phases of the case appeared to warrant. This
action on the part of the State Department -was
announced exclusively in these dispatches to Tha
Tribune of October i.*7.
II Is believed that a more careful and tem
perate reading of the message ■will at once make
It obvious that the President's reference to the
employment of civil and military forces applies
solely to th«» possibility of outrages, such as at-
tacks on the lives of Japanese subjects or sim
ilar grave violations of the treaty with that
country.
DANGER FROM AGITATION.'
But while the President has welcomed the in
formation that Japan might, an probably
would, take steps to divert the flow of her emi
gration to Corea and Manchuria, where her sub
jects would still further her own interests, ami
that to this end she might even go so far as.
to refuse to all of the laboring classes among
her subjects permission to emigrate to tlsa
United States, and while the President is pre
pared to do all in his power to further this end,
it Is regarded as obvious that the unguarde*!
and even Inflammatory utterances of Caltfar
r.ians. In which they are prone la speak witit
grave disrespect, not to say contempt, of the
Japanese, may not only render futile ar. y effort^
which the President and Secretary of State may
make to promote the end which California so
desire?, but may even have so unfortunate a^n
effect as to Inflame the Japanese puhlic and
render It Impossible for the Emperor and his
advisers to carry Into effect a policy which they
are convinced would make for the best Interests
of the empire.
The President is of the» opinion that the ques
tions Involved in the segregation of the Japanese
pupils in the public schools wni be. settled In
the courts without difficulty, or that. If no satis
factory solution can be found through the. Ju
diciary, negotiations between the federal gov
ernment and the State of California can be em
ployed to bring about a satisfactory eolutfcm of
the problem. This, however, he regards a* a
minor question. But should the lawless aksmesit
of California, inflamed by the reckless utter
ances of the politicians, perpetrate- outrages o-.
Japanese subjects negotiations looking to a
satisfactory settlement of all existing difllcalHae
would probably be rendered nugatory, and tba
consequences might be most unfortunate*
It Is further asserted that compliance with
the President's recommendation that Japanese
already within th« United States bo permitted to
become naturalized citizens of thts country
would have a most salutary effect and would
obviate the unfortunate situation always pre
cipitated in any country by tho presence et a
number ot aliens who can never become cMmbsi
of the country in which they live. It Is .not to
bo supposed that Congress will find tlma> even
to consider this recommendation daring the
short session, but that It is one which deserves
ultimately the most careful consideration is self
evident.
JAPASESE COSTIDEXCE.
Xeivspapers Find It Realized in

Tokio. Dec. «.— Most of the papers here highly

the Japanese, as expressed In his message. The
"Asahl" is delighted that tht» confidence reposed
In the President has been realized. It iiiiys:
By his firm attitude. prompted by a lofty
sense of justice. President Roosevelt has ad-ie I
new lustre t<> his already -great fame. It is» t>
be hoped that true Americans v ill unite in sur
port of his righteous policy.
The "Hochi" praises President Roosevelt's at

find it in perfect accord with the views ci t'~e
Japanese government.
"Public opinion here." it say*. "believes thai
