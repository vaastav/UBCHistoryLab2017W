County Cocct and Sheriff Can Pay
For Bridge in City of
Grafton
SAYS JUDGE CHARLES LYNCH
In An Able and Exhaustive Opinion
tiruTvxra jd n nowo injunction
Cane.
Judge Charles W. Lynch ot the
circuit court of the thirteenth cir
tult of this State has refused the application
for an injunction in the
case of Charles M. Glenn and others
against the County Court of Taylor
County and others. His opinion covering
fifteen typewritten pages and
treating the subject is an able and
exhaustive manner was mailed Tuesday
night to the parties in interest.
The cause has been pending in the
chancery side of his court since September,
and he gave it much thought
and consideration.
The plaintiffs asked for an order
restraining the sheriff of Taylor
county from proceeding to collect the
taxes levied and assessed by the
county court of Taylor county July
6. 1906. ou the ground that the
court had allowed and paid the
sheriff $150 for the Good Roads convention
and $527.88 as commissions
and discounts on taxes paid during
t he (Use-mint nerinrt nnit hee-nune the
county court had passed two orders
to the Canton Bridge Company?one
for $6,000 and the other for $9,000
for building abutments to a bridge
in the City of Grafton, under a contract
with the county court.
The plaintiffs claimed the Court had
no authority to construct a bridge In
the corporate limits of the city because
It was the duty of the city under
Its charter to construct and
maintain its bridges; also the plaintiffs
claimed that the effect of the
contract for the abutments was to
bind the levies of subsequent years
for the superstructure of the bridge;
also they asked for an injunction because
Robert E. Phillips, a member
of the county court, having moved
from Petterman district, wherein he
resided at the time of his election as
a commissioner of the court, to Graf- I
ton district, wherein John H. Henry,
another commissioner then resided,
was disqualified thereby, and Ulysses
Morrow, the other member having
voted against the contract, it was illegal
and not binding.
Judge Lynch held:
Phillips was not disqualified, and
the contract, therefore, was legal.
That the contract for abutments
only did not bind levies of succeedin
e years for the sunerstructure.
That the county court under the
provisions of Chapter 43 of the Code
had the legal right, and It was Its
duty, too to bulk! all the necessary
and expensive bridges in the county,
whether within or without the city
That because payments to the
sheriff, of which plaintiffs complain
ed, had been paid out of the levies ot
1905 did not, even If illegal and uu
authorized, render void or voidable
the levies of 1906.
In reference to the qualification of
Phillips as a member of the court
Judge Lynch held that his removal ;
from one magisterial district to another
in the county did not disqualify
him. for the reason that he was
not a district officer but a county officer.
and. so long as he did not re- .
move from the county he could legally
serve on the court.
It was also charged that there was
collusion between Phillips and Henry <
In letting the contract and that they i
would be both personally benefited i
by the construction of the bridge, s
Df this feature of the case Judge <
Lynch says in his opinion: ]
"The charge that the bridge con- j

ind in fraud of the rights of the a
rxpayers, at an exorbitant and ex- c
ravngrant, price, and costing more by t
10,000 than it should otherwise
:ost, is denied by the answer of the
ounty court, nnd the individual
ominissioners composing It, which
inswers upon this hearing, are read t
nly as affidavits. Being thus af- k
irmed and denied, but in my Judg- f<
eut not justifying the Court In v
ranting the injunction prayed for, 1
oes not warrant the Court in con- p
Inning the case for proof and fur- si
her hearing upon this allegation of l?

ho answers relntlng to the personal
lterosts of two of the commlsslonrs
and the benefits accruing to them
om the construction of the bridge 'I'

Thus, Judge Lynch has refused the st
ljunctton but has not dismissed the H

BROWNSVILLE, Tex.. Dec. 6
1 promised to write you a.II
^ about my.trip to the Chill Coast of
* Texas, and first ol all I will say the
K trip down here Is most dellahtrul.
It none of you never tr&velea in a
private car you do not know the
conveniences that you have in that
way, and the sights you see in traveling
this distance is worth the
money you pay.
The climate, is fine, it is now like
a June day, the air is so pure it
makes one feel like a new man. The
people here hang fresh meat up in
the trees and on the sides of a
house and it will keep for days without
salt. I have already seen '
orange, lemon and fig trees now laden
with fruit. As to vegetables,
cabbage, beans, potatoes and others
are- all growing now.
The country along the railroad
from here north to Kingsville, a distance
of 100 miles is all being sold
in blocks of 40 acres each. The
land is a rich sandy loam, which
will produce fruits and vegetables
of all kinds. It Is covered with
mosquito wood and cactus. This is
the country in which to buy yourself
a home.
J went to Matamoros, Mexico, on
Sunday to see the bull fight. There
is to be .a fight there again the 9 th
of this month.
Brownsville Is situated on the
Rio Grande. I stopped off at Corpus
Christi-?and gathered shells from
the Gulf of Mexico.
With best wishes to my friends. I
will write again and keep my friends j
posted of my whereabouts in the
Gulf Coast.
