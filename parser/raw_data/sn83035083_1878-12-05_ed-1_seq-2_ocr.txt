There is trouble in the Senatorial
families at Washington over the pros
pect of their having to recognize the
colored bride of Bruce, the colored
Seuator from Mississippi. Etiquette
prescribes that when the wife of a new
Senator, or new wife of an old Sena
tor, goes to Washington, the wives of
other Senators shall pay her a social
visit. The high-toned ladies of the
capital revolt at the idea of calling up
on a colored lady, aud it is reported
have held a conference with a view of
changing the social law- Out upon
such nonsense.
The recent death of Colonel Walton
Dwight, at Binghampton, N. Y has
caused considerable excitement among
the life insurance companies. Within
three months provious to his death he
had succeeded in securing policies in
favor of his wife and son to the amount
of $253,600. It is the theory of some
insurance men that Dwight intended,
when he took the policies, to be a
dead man before the next quarter's
premium became due, because he was
financially embarrassed, and it would
have been difficult for him to raise
$3,000 necessary to pay them.
Old Peter Cooper is the father of
Edwin Cooper, Mayor of New York,
and father-in-law of Abraham S
Hewitt. Both Edward Cooper and
Hewitt are hard-money men, while
Uncle Peter is soft on the finances. A
carrespondent says the son and son-in-law
have had many discussions
with tbe old gentleman ou finances.
The old man was accustomed to say to
his friends. "Now, these two boys
of mine meaning his son Edward and
his son-in-law, Mr. Hewitt are smart
able and very intelligent in everything
but this money question. But when
ever this question comes up they talk
like boys ten years old." The old
man's head is level.
The money-value exchanges at the
New York Clearing House lor the
year, ending October 1st, amounted to
twenty thousand millions of dollars.
In all this value only nine hundred
and fifty millions of dollars were alc
ually handled. The inflation of paper
creel i ts thus amounted to over nineteen
thousand millions of dollars. Yet the
very fellows who practiced this infla
tion are the loudest howlers against
the inflation of government credits in
the whole land. It might probably in
terfere with their own system of in
flation. Compromised.
The Tiffin Advertiser of last week
makes the announcement that O. C
Zellers, the absconding Cashier of the
National Bank of that city, has settled
with the bank and is about to bo al
lowed to return to the United States.
The amount of Zeller's embezzlement
from the bank was supposed to be
about $46,000. Of this sum It is said
that John T. Norris, who was the first
to discover the whereabouts of the ab
sconding Cashier, obtained $15,000, of
which sum ho was compelled, to pay
the Bank $10,000. E.T. Stickney.who
was bis bondsman for school fHnds,
recovered about $10,000. lie gave to
his attorneys in Ctuada aud other
parties $10,000, of which sum it is re
ported Norris got $2,300, He has giv
en up all his real estate, and all that
he has to shew to-day is but about $6 -800,
and his lost reputation. The
Bank will realizo about $30,000 out of
Its compromise. Norris aud his con
federates will have about $7,300. The
Advertiser says: ''Zeller has been
nearly squeezed dry. He found that
his wealth took unto itself wings and
has flown away."

Terrible marine Disaster.
About a quarter to one o'clock on
' the night of the 24th of November the
Hamburg American line Steamer
Fomerainia, Capt. Schwenaon, which
sailed from New York on the 14th
ult., for Hamburg, and arrived at
Flymouth at midnight ou the 21th,
collided during a dense fog, with the
Welsh bark, Noel Eiliin,of Carranoon,
from Rotterdam lor Cardiff in ballast,
about eight miles south of Folkestone.
The Pomerania at the time was on her
way from Plymouth to Hamburg.
The steamship foundered in about
ten minutes after the collision and
from fifty to sixty of her passengers
were lost. Among the passengers was
Louis Lauman, of Akron who gives
the following statement of the occur
rence :
" We had a capital run and got to
Plymouth about 3 in the morning of
the 25th iust. We landed some pas
sengers and took some for Hamburg,
and then ran tor Cherbourg and land
ed the passengers, nearly all of whom
were cabin. Those left were mostly
between decks. The crew consisted of
111 men. We have hero at the Sail
or's Home 172. I waaiu bed last night
about 11 :45 o'clock when I felt a sud-
den
bump as if the Pomcrnia had
struck upon a rock. I was alarmed,
but I did not think at lu st that it was
anything serious as we had kept a
good lookout and the Captain appear
ed to be very careful. It was his 126
voyage, he had told us. Ho celebrat
ed his 125 when he was last at Ham
burg. A few seconds after the collis
ion tbe steward aud some of the crew
came rushing to us and said a sailing
barque had run into us and we were
all to go on deck, and I went ou'deck
directly and saw our ship's light, but
tbe fog was so great I could see noth
ing else.
But they told mo the barque had
run away. The crew were then all
busy lowering the boats. The ship
was beginning to sink. In lowering
the boats there was great confusion,
everybody trying to crowd into them.
One boat filled and sank immediately
after it got into the water, and two
others were smashed by collision. The
boats were fastened np tight and we
could not get them undone. The
Pomerania was sinking rapidly.
There were a number of women
among the passengers, I don't know
how many, but eight have been saved
aud a baby. I think the baby's moth
er Iras been drowned. Our captain
had some fireworks on board and let
them oil. We managed to got into
the boats that remained and had been
there about ten minutes when the
steamer Glengarry picked us up. She
cruised about a long time. Our cap
tain had a chance to save bis life, but
would stick to his ship. I saw him
when our boat got away from the
steamer, standing on the bridge giving
commands, trying to maintaiu order
aud Rave as many as he could. In
twenty minutes after collision the
Pomerania went down. She did
not keel over but went down gradual
ly. The ship which ran us down I
never saw at all. They told me she
was a sailing barque, and that with a
north northeast wind, she camo bowl
ing along and ran right into us. I
thought until we lauded we had run
upou a rock as the Schiller did. It
was very thick weather. There was
a good lookout on the Pomerania all
the time. She had smart sailors, and
had two men on the bridge, aud two
fore-part from the time sheneared the
channel. Our boat was so crowded it
was nearly even with the water.
Terrific Boiler Kxploslon.
A special from Unioutown, Pa.,
dated the 29th ult., to the Enquirer,
gives the following account of a terri
ble disaster near that place, by which
six men were killed and seven others
seriously wounded :
" The boiler explosion yesterday
afternoon at the coal works of Reed
Bros., near Dunbar Furnace eight
miles below hcre,turu3 out to be worse
than wa3 at first supposed. At the
moment of the explosiou two men
were instantly killed, and one died
within an hour; two more, John
Mowey and Joseph Vayone, died last
night, and the sixth, Morgan McGill,
this afternoon. John Dougherty, the
pit boss, is seriously hurt, and his re
covery is considered improbable. Sev
en other men aro suffering from
wounds, scalds aud burns, but none of
them are thought to be latally injured.
The disaster occurred in this way :
Eight men were on the roof of the
boiler-house, and with the assistance
of a number below were erecting a
new smoke-stack. The steam pene
trating through the roof annoyed the
men above, and Vayone, the yard-boss,
ordered the escape-valve to be closed.
This was done, and within two min
utes the boiler exploded with terrific
force. Daniel McGarvey, the engin
eer, was thrown a hundred feet in the
air, and one hundred and fifty feet
distant, into an adjoining field. He
alighted on his head in a beaten clay
foot-path, in which his head half bur
ied itself. The force of the fall rup
tured his abdomen, and let his entrails
ont. John Mowey was scalded to
death. His flesh was cookad until it
was so tender that his abdomen burst
ed under the distention of his stomach
and bowels, and these organs pushed
themselves to the surface. Richard
Evans was killed by a bar of iron
striking him across the forehead, and
imbedding itself in his brain. Wayne
died last night and McUill this alter
noon from internal and external in
juries. The boiler was toru into shreds
Hardly a fragment as large as a man's
hat can be found. Of the boiler-house
nothing can be found, except here and
there a stick of wood. The general
demolition could not have been more
complete. With the exception of Mc
Gill, all the killed leave large families.
Reid Brothers arc bearing all the fu
neral expenses."

Nkw Orleans, Dec. L The steam
er Charles Morgan arrived to-day
from Cincinnati. Her officers report
that at 4 o'clock this morning a collis
ion occurred at Bringier's Point, op
posite Doualdsonville, between the
Morgan and the Cotlou Valley, of the
Red River Transportation Company
line. The Cotton Valley sauk and
twenty lives were l06t. The boat and
cargo are a total loss. The Cotton
Valley left here yesterday for Red
River with a full assorted cargo and a
number of passeugers.
When the collision occurred the
wind was blowing a gale and the raiu
falling in torrents. The Morgan was
coming down, the Valley going up,
the boat rounding a point. The offi
cers of each, seeing the danger of a
hei. gliartls struck the valley with
great farce, causing the latter 'to sink

fi-inorement oi Datcnts issueu to ine i
plaintiff in 1862, re-issued in 18G0
The case is of much Importance, as it
covers a period of many years, during
which the defendants made thousand
of machines containing the alleged in
fringement. Ex.
It is becoming pretty apparent that
the only way in which Secretary Sher
man will be able to maintain resump
tion will be by acceeding to the de
mands of the bankers of the country.
These bankers represent six hundred
millions dollars of capital, and hold
an hundred millions dollars of
greenbacks, and arc complete mas
ters of the situation. Should they
present their greenbacks at once and
demand coin it would be exceedingly
unpleasant to Mr. Sherman and com
pel him to accede to their demands.
They insist upon the demonetization
of silver, and if Mr. Sherman and the
Administration had their way their
demand would be granted. They are
determined to dictate terms and to
obtain complete control of the finances
of the nation and the people and to
hold their destiny in their hands.
How do the people like the contem
plation of the idea of a monopoly of
capitalists dictating terms to the na
tion upon its monetary affairs? Is
there no reason to fear danger ahead?
Was the old Uuited States Bank with
its meager capital of only $35,000,000
of such hideous mein as to arouse the
nation against it, while the great com
bination, representing $600,000,000
capital, making its insolent demands,
excites not the least alarm?
The goldites claim to be in favor of
silver for money, but they want the
weight and size of the silver dollar
increased to be worth a dollar meas
ured by gold as a standard. Up to
tho time of tho surreptitious demone
tization of silver the dollar of that met
al was always a legal-tender and the
standard of value, and all the public
and private.debls of tho country were
created under it. If the relative value
between it and gold has changed, why
not reduce the gold coin to the silver
standard? One of the complaints of
the goldites against silver dollars has
always been that the coin was too
gross and inconvenient. Now they
pretend they want it enlarged. The
Government should furnish dollars
with which to pay debts of tho same
value as the dollars with which debts
were created. That's honest.
The Cincinnati Times' Washington
special, in speaking ot Russell, the
Congressman elect from North Caro
lina, who was the Republican candi
date and elected by Republicans, makes
the following admission, which is cer
tainly damaging : "lie says he is in
favor of paying all Southern war
claims, and of pensioning rebel sold
iers, the same as those who fought in
the Union Army." Mr. Waddell, the
Democratic candidate, who was beat
en, opposed the payment of all South
ern war claims, and has been regard
ed as a particularly conservative mem
ber in tbe two terms he has served in
Congress. Which prompts us to ask.
Has there been a right-about-face in
the Republican ranks about the rebel
war debt, and arc the Confederate sol
diers to bp placed on the pension rolls
with those on tne Union side, aud if
so what ia to bo the stock in trade of
tbe Republican organs next year? A
great deal of ammunition has been ex
pended in the wrong direction. En
quirer.
With all the Radical bellyaching
over the subject of the payment of the
rebel debt and rebel war claims they
have in the past paid much more than
the Democrats, and there is not the
least doubt that they would pay them
all if they thought they might thereby
make the South solid for their party.
Tbe Duhonorcd Dollar.
AugustBe'mont does not approve of
the recent action of the clearing-house
association. He says : "The mistake
made by the banks in their declaration
that the silver dollar would not be ac
cepted except on special agreement
was utterly uncalled for. The time for
such agreements has not arrived yet,
and there was absolutely no need to
say what was going to be done when
a certain thing should occur. Besides
the transaction, and every oue of them
should bo treated as such upon the
same principle upon which a bank re
fuses credit to one customer and gives
it to another. Declarations like those
which the banks have made can only
tend to spread dissatisfaction and un
certainty of mind throughout the com
munity, and this particular declaration
of the banks concerning silver raises
theWest agaiust;thc East. It is by no
means impossible that the silver men
in Congress will set to work more en
ergetically than ever to attain their
object, and nobody can predict at pres
ent that they won't succeed." Mr.
Belmont considers that it is utterly
impossible to break the government
on resumption. Of courso, if every
greenback tn the country should be
presented and gold claimed for it the
whole resumption scheme would im
mediately fall to (ho ground, but no
such emergency can possibly be antic
ipated. But on the other hand, there
can be no quest ion that the policy of
our banks is very likely to cause a con
siderable drain of gold from the re
serve and a consequent tightness of
money.
Washington Letter.
Washinoton, I). C, November 29. 1W.
The city is lllling up rapidly. Strangers and
Members of Congress arc pouring in by the
hundreds, and our hotels aud lobbies begin to
show that animated, bustling appearance which
characterizes them during the season when the
various cliques and clans are marshalling them
selves for a descent upon Uncle Sam's cash box.
Nearly all the leading Senators and Members
have arrived and are in their various domiciles
K.uh one always brings with him more or less
f his constituents, and as a consequence our
ty is rousing itself out 01 the Sleep which quiets
the Capitol, the streets and our business avenues
during the recess. We saw Senator Ttiurman
enjoying tne sunshine oi the past week ou the
mittce rooms are plenty of lockers filled with
shot and shell of Congressional pattern. We
Joiibt not tnat many a politician will receive
his death wound from this ammunition before
the4th of March next, and that more than one
will get hurt in his neck from soraeot thcsplin-
tcr6 wnch ny irtoly at all tiines and more par.
tieularly so during protracted or night sessions

' session it was no uncommon sight to see a Mem.
i ber desperately shot in the neck, unabled there
by to nse hit tongue or his body, to whom a sup
porting friend or desk was an object of necessi
ty, and as we looked into tne House Restaurant
the other day, wo fancied we saw last winter's
vigorous assault repeated and many a lawgiver
laid low by some missile of tho enemy.
Though we near the day fixed for resumption
yet there are many who do not realize its ap
proach, or the fact that gold may show itself
again as money. One of our prominent minis
ters recently received a gold coin as a marriage
feo. but thinking it only a penny, put it in his
pocket and gave it to his children on arrival
home. Learning, a few days after, its value, he
was gratilicd to find it among the children's
toys and not spent for candy.
It is not generally known that the original in
tention of those who laid out Washington was
to have the business and aristocratic part of the
city on Capitol Hill, between the Eastern
Branch aud tho Capitol. Tet such was the fact.
The deep water of the Potomac is on that
branch which runs past the Navy Yanl, and in
olden times the entire shipping interest and
wharves of tho Cily lay between the Navy
Yard and the promontory now occupied by the
Arsenal. The Washington front, then as now
was unfitted for vessels larger than yachts or
fishing smacks and as water cnaunels were then
of Government interest, it was but natural that
our first citizens should have dreamed that the
city would necessarily build up nearest its ship
piug and wharves. Speculators gradually ab
sorbed whole squares asking exorbitant prices
for lots ami thereby forced newcomers as well
as the Government into the Western part of the
city. Eighty years ago land near Hazzard's
Point sold for $20 a front foot that is not worth
a dollar now. All the grand residences of the
Harrys, the Greenlcafs, the Taylors, the Dud
dingtons, and hundreds cf other aristocrats,
have tumbled down or been removed, James
Greenleaf sunk a million of dollars here. Thom
as Law $400,000, Duncanson and others over a
million, and a score of others, some of whose
names figured in our National history, among
which is that of Robert Morris, Washington's
Secretary of the Treasury, went down to finan
cial rnin and disaster after expending millions
in endeavoring to make Capitol Hill the grand
center ot wealth and fashion.

Corrcspondcn co
Thanksgiving was appropriately observed ia
this place. President Hinsdale delivered an
address, his subject being "Religions Prospects',
The address was a clear, candid and exhaustive
statement and argument of the condition of the
Churches and causes of the general prostration
and stagnation of the religious element as it
exists at present. The main cause being, per
haps, a want of genuine piety; which begets
other causes. The President regards the rcli
gious prospectas extremely gloomy.
If President Hinsdale had said there is less
superstition at present instead of genuine piety
wc think he wonld have been nearer right. I
is but a few years ago that Abner Kneeland was
Imprisoned in Iloston lor saying that he did not

imprisoned. As science advances, religion re
cedes, like darkness from coming light.

rcigneth without a rival.
