The morning was smoky, so ihat little could he
seen at daj light, but ateiimise a line of earthworks
was discovered arms* a plowed field to the left ol
the Ki!i:'s|.»n rani, withiu a thousand yards of our

Within the last twenty four hours an almost tn
credible amount ol labor has been performed upon
the defences of Knoiiville Lines of rifle pits
crown the whole range of hills uronnd, and to Ihe
right and left of the town. The position Itself |s
as strong _______ as nature could have trade tt fur
sustaining an assault or maintaining a siege. The
entire front of the right line is protected by a
ch'vaux de frU*. of pikes, the shafts of which ar
strongly inserted in the parapet of an angle of for
ty-five degrees, end firmly aatme. by telegraph
wire. These pikes were found heie when we took
possession. Among many other articles Intended
for the defence of the place (Vom the t'nlon army,
earthworks, with strong traverses, cover our bat
lerit-H nt every important place, with ___gß__U_e*
well covered from the ciiemy'sguns.
There was very little firing done by the Con
federates on the ftth, the day being spent In se
lectin* position* for Ihek artillery.
On lh* morntti_ of the. BBtb the f'nnfederat.-s
advanced, burnt some houses arm? ths town, and
retired :
A few minutes le fore the conflagratiaii the ene
my opened v tnttery new th c front of our een.rw,
and fired four or five shots into the town. They
were apparently aim. d at the cotton hale battery
on Gay street. Tbe ini-siles, as tbey came Whia
zing into town, caused considerable panic, and
for a few moincnts the impression prevailed among
the citizens tint the grand shelling had lieguii.—
The Gay street haitery, us well as two others to
ihe right and left, replied rapidly, their reports
shaking the town, spectators ivent skuirylng for
shelter te ihe n.igbboiing t-__Min_*. teams ske
daddled up Gay street, and citizens look to thuir
eeßsis foi piottctlon. I'or same eaass the rebel
halt, tics ceased firing, probably from a fear of
hurling souicbo.lv In the town —ours followed suit
-and there was a gie.U calm. Meantime the
heavens were illuniii.atc.l by the lurid flames of
the burning buildings, attracting a ctowd of the
more v__Btnres__M to Bumtoß Hill to witness the

There was very Utile chango in the programmr

About 8 o"eh."'k A. iff.flee Fi rrcr.i,acting under

it was sale to fire over the heads of the men. They
went down the long .slope, over the fallen trees,
and through Umttesrw In front, upon the double

badly hurt were made prisoner*. Only some thirty

number killed, wounded, or prisoners in the ene

to our ttten, and must he -et down as the most 111
fortunate episode of the siege. Our dead arc still
lying within sight of our hreasiwoiks, but cannot
be recovered.
The final assault and repulse took place on the
-Wih, Lotigstreet having been reinforced, accord
ing to the writer, hy Gens _-_**, ________ and
Williams. The letter says:
Skirmishing commenced on Sunday night at 10
o'clock, and continued sharply until near daylight
of Monday, on our left front before Fort Sanders,
commanded by Gen. Fer.crn, and defended by trie
•JSthNew Yoik, Benjamin's 3_ U. H. artillery, and
Buckley's llhode Island battery. Our pickets
were driven in, and the enemy had possessed
themselves of some rifle pits, but the Massachusetts
boys drove them hack, when suddenly the rebel
storming party, fed by ibe 16tb and 17th Georgia
and 1 (lb Mississippi, under cover nf our own re
treating men, came to ihe assault. '
They approached to within one hundred yards
of the fort unharmed. Then commenced a setjes
of desperate and daring attack", stubborn resist
ance, death, horror s< are. ly equalled
during the war. These men were the veterans of
Ihe Potomac—the. flower of I.ongsiret-l's army —
and, confident of promised victory, plunged into a
boiling hell of lead.
Wires had been stretched from stump to stump
In front of the works hy Capt. Poe. Over these,
the advancing enemy fell in confused heaps, with
Ihe kitted and wounded around them. Out anil
lilimen hurled shell hy hand; forward ever tbe
impedimenta came the doomed rebels! Hot and
hotter became the battle, until the ground over
which they passed was carpeted with the state.—
The ditch was piled With dead, wounded,end
dying
r- ot one on their side faltered—not a score of the
gallant stormeis escaped. The sun, riming, looked
down through the cold mist and chill frost of thai
November morning upon Die remains of an army.
Hue thousand killed, wounded, and prisoners, was
the cort of the assault of Port Banders. Nobly hat
It sustained the reputation of its namesake aud re
venged bis fall. Among the killed is Col. Glrarde,
of the 13ih Massachusetts. Lieut.-Col. O'Brien,
tbe brother of Mr*. Brownlow, is a prisoner.
Gen. llurnslde offered them an armistice from 10
A. M. to 5 P. M., to remove their wounded and
bury their dead. It was accepted. Our loa* will
1 not roach eighty, all told. Over fitly of these are
the men of the -7th Kentucky, captured on tbe
•onlb of the iir*r.
Beside* -00 prisoners, we bav<t three bsttle-
Bogs. One of tbent was planted on our works at

Tbe twelve day* of Long street before Knox vllle,
threatening assault and siege, had caused a scarci

our position, and temporarily suspended cur cotn
" inuuications and destroyed much property, chiefly
rebel. There has been some loss of men by tbe
casualties of war, bat no panic, retreat, starvation,
,or actual investment has occurred thus far. The
siege Is another lebel failure.
