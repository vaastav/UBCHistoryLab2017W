! POINTS IN TAFT'S MESSAGE
President Taft's first message to
i Congress spreads over 'steen col
I limns and is not as well written
j from a literary point of view as the
state papers of former President
Roosevelt. Following the usual
j custom nearly the first half of the
message is devoted to recounting tl e
foreign affairs and js both too
lengthy and uninteresting for quota
tion.
| When he reaches the tariff ques
tion his treatment of that subject
will make him few friends in the
west and middle west in the great
body of the people who did not re
ceive justice and are not able to set
that the party pledge for downward
revision was honestly met in the
passage of the Payne till. lie ex
presses the hope that he will be
able to handle the maximum and
minimum features without arousing
hard feeling and discriminations
from the foreign countries concern
ed in the varying duties. He hopes
against hope that the present tariff
will he allowed to stand awhile and
be tested out on account of the fact
especially that revision disturbs and
renders business uncertain.
He recommends a ship subsidy
measure to build up American Mer
chant Marine. Lines from the
Atlantic seaboard to eastern coasi
of South America and also from the
west coast to China Japan and the
Philippines. The subsidy plan how
ever we do not believe will accom
plish the purpose sought. A pro
per method would be to allow Am
erican capital- to buy ships where
• hey can get. them cheapest and fly
the American f!:ig. It lias heen
-hown that ships of foreign make
•an he bought for about one-half
what they can be built for in Ameri
can ports. In addition there is the
difference in wages of American
S'aman and the results will not
k.:ep the freight money in Ameri
can hands but will only make p<>.»-
-ible another gigantic trust to which
the country must pay tribute. We
have taken the disagreeable
of his message first but nrar.j
paragraphs follow which have very
strong merit and it is to be hoped
that Congress will largely follow the
recommendation of the executive.
Separate statehood for Aaizona
and New Mexico is favored, the
voting on constitution and statt
officials to be held separately.
Government of Alaska by a gov*
ernor and executive council, but
no legislature, is advised.
Drastic laws against the impor
tation of "white slaves,or trans
portatiryi across national or state
litres are asked.
Reorganization of the depart
ment of state upon more modern
lines in furtherance of foreign trade
is necessary.
Pensions for superanuated gov
ernmer.t employes is approved.
One of the worthy subjects pres
sed upon Congress for consideration
i> the Postal Savings Banks. H<»
states that their chief purpose is to
teach habits of thrift among tin
people. They are desired by Un
people he is convinced and alth<
they are opposed yet their adoption
will be successful and will in n<
way interfere with private banking.
He staves off the proposition of d< -
laying action until the Monetary
Commission should report on tl e
ground that there is no reason wh\
they should be united and believes
that the Carter bill which was con
sidered at the last session was »
very strong measure covering all
the essential features for a good
start.
The next in importance the
President considers that of improv
ing the methods of legal procedure
in the courts. He notes that prom
inent jurists and Bar Associations
are alarmed about the frequent
miscarriage of justice in our crimin
al trials and the long delays and
high cost to the litigant in oui cfvil
actions. He points out that lynch
ings—those outrages on civilizat'on
in America —are often times caused
by the very fact that the people
have well grounded fear that the
court will not mete out justice nor
set adequate penalty upon the
criminal. He urges the appoint
ment of a commission to simplify
the procedure in the federal courts
j which are admittedly better than
1 most state courts but should le
I hotter examples to the State Courts.
! In this connection he comes to
the platform pledge to modify the
jstatute under which injunctions
issue.
The ends of justice will hest b»
; met and the chief cause of com
plaint against ill-considered injune
: tions without notice will be remov
jed by the enactment of a statute
| forbidding hereafter the issuing of
any injunction or restraining order,
| whether temporary or permanent,
by any federal court, without pre
vious notice and a reasonable oppor
tunity to be heard in behalf of par
ities to be enjoined, unless it shall
| appear to the satisfaction of the
I court that the delay necessary to
give such notice and hearing would
result in irreparable injury to the
complainant, and unless also the
court shall from the evidence make
a written finding, which shall he
spread upon the court minutes,
that immediate and irreparable
injury is likely to ensue to the com
plainant, and shall define the in- J
jury, state why it is irreparable!
ind shall also indorse on the order 1
issued the date and the hour of the |
issuance of the order. Moreover,;
every such injunction or restraining j
>rdtr issue without previous notico
md opportunity by the defendant :
to be heard should by force of thei
statute expire and be of no enert
after seven days from the issuance!
thereof, or within any time less
than that period which the court
may fix, unless within such seven
days or such less period, that in
junction or order is extended or
renewed after previous notice and
opportunity to be heard.
