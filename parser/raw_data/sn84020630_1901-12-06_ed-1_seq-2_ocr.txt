New Mexico Dciniimlc State

Or Right and In Justice New
tlexlco Should Mo State.
The fact" thaThaving been born in
Ohio seems to be no longer a sure
pass-port to federal office. Times
change.
Lord Kitchener reports that he needs
more soldiers. No doubt about that.
This has been apparent to the average
looker-on for some time.
Undaunted by defeat -Mr. Croker now
aspires to be chairman of the Demo
cratic national committee. When Mr.
Croker wants anything he is none too
bashful to ask for it.
A St. Paul man knocked his wife
down with a poodle dog and now the
St. Paul newspapers are fighting over
the question, which animal suffered
the worst.
The Democratic leaders and states
men in New Mexico have the best of
the Republican leaders and statesmen
in one respect. They need not worry
about the offices.
Colonel Jack Chinn, of the sovereign
state of Kentucky, says he no longer
carries a pistol. If this is true the
colonel has given up active participa
tion in Kentucky politics.
Copies of the same old charges
against Governor Otero have been filed
again. The men behind these charges
are evidently of the opinion that a He
well stuck to is as good as the truth.
Work on the isthmian canal will be
gin in less thatf-a year. It will mean
the employment of thousands of men
for a number of years and the expen
diture of about $200,000,000.
One or two of New Mexico's citizens
now in Washington -are doing the
ostrich act, but that does not prevent
knowledge of their doings and actions
In due course of time this will become
apparent.
There are still some Texas Demo
unts in the house of representatives
who have received no knowledge of the
fact that the silver question is dead.
But then Texas is such a great state
that news there travels slowly.
When it comes to getting up a row
the Democratic members in the nation
al house of representatives are all
right. They do not have much to
quarrel over, but what little they have
they do up in good style.
Indian agents will soon be scarce.
They are to be superseded by superin
tendents of Indian schools, these lat
ter to be in the classified service. This
is a change that it is believed, will
prove of material benefit to the Indian
service.
On account of a rate war, the railroad
fare from Colorado Springs to Cripple
Creek has been reduced from some
thing like $8 to 10 cents. It seems the
railroad combinations have'nt as yet
extended to the region around Colora
do Springs and Cripple Creek.
Mayor Seth Low announces that he
has selected the man who is to be po
lice commissioner of New York City.
The new police commissioner announc
es that the first thing upon taking of
fice will be to remove the Tammany
chief of police. This is as expected.
Reports sent to the New Mexican by
its correspondents in various sections
of the territory show conclusively that
times are prosperous and that the
population of New Mexico Is steadily
Increasing. What is more, people ex
pect these good times to continue.
Officials of the department of justice
have been gently reminded by the at
torney general not to take too active
part in politics and not to take or re
ceive money for campaign expenses.
The administration seems to be in the
civil service reform movement in dead
earnest.
Delegate B. S. Rodey informs the
New Mexican that he will keep up hi3
fight to obtain statehood for the terri
tory. The people of New Mexico are
with the delegate in this matter, and
that without reserve. They want
Btatehood and want It as soon as it
possibly can be had.
Signs of the times are that the pres
ent prosperity in the country will ob
tain for some years to come. One sign
in that direction is that the great
Pennsylvania Railway company will
build 400 locomotives during the year
1902. There must be good business
ahead.
No effort should be spared to appre
hend and convict the men who enter
ed a store in Lincoln county, killed the
proprietor and his guest, looted the
store and then set it on fire. It is one
of the most atrocious crimes committed
In late years In New Mexico and should
nnt ern unaveneed. Lincoln county
should offer a reward for the capture
of the robbers ana murderers.
After allowing for the slight deficit
In one or two minor funds, which could
not have been foreseen by the last
legislative assembly there Is a surplus
of-between 6,000 and $7,000 In the terri
torial treasury at the end of the 52d
fiscal year. There are 35 per cent of
taxes for that year still to be collected.
It certainly looks as if prosperity and
economy are going hand In hand in the
management of territorial affairs dur
ing Governor Otero's administration.
Captain Perry of the United States
battleship Iowa, held Colon just long
enough to protect American interests,
and to show the Colombian govern
ment that the United Stales means
business whenever the time arrives.
He did the right thing at the right
time.
A resolution has been introduced In
congress by Hon. William H. Moody of
Massachusetts, to investigate election
methods In Louisiana. It is not only
Louisiana election methods which
should be investigated however, but
also the disfranchisement of thous
ands and even millions of voters in the
whole south. It is to be hoped that
the Investigation, if one should be
made, will not be upon a sectional ba
sis nor intensify the race feeling which
unfortunately still exists in the south.
The Stephens bill has been introduced
in congress again with the familiar
provision that there shall be no appro
priation and storage of the waters of
the Rio Grande or its tributaries to
which others have right by prior ap
propriation. As the proposed internat
ional dam is to claim right to all unap
propriated waters of the Rio Grande
and its tributaries, the fate of New
Mexico would be settled by its passage
for no additional reservoirs could then
be built along the Rio Grande or any
of its tributaries such as the Santa Fe,
the Pojoaque, Santa Cruz and scores of
other streams tributary to the Rio
Grande. - Naturally New Mexico must
fight such a proposition tooth and nail.
Governor Otero has appointed W. M.
Robbins of Hillsboro, sheriff of Sierra
county, vice J. C. Chandler, the present
sheriff, who has resigned to go Into
business at San Marcial. Mr. Robbins
is an old resident of Sierra county and
a well known and respected citizen
and fully competent to perform the du
ties of the office to the satisfaction of
all concerned. Mr. Robbins is a Re
publican in politics. He was highly
recommended by the leading and in
fluential citizens of the county, who
spoke of him in very complimentary
terms. He Is engaged In the mercan
tile business at Hillsboro. He will take
office on the first of January, 1902, as
it will take him that length of time to
qualify and furnish his bonds.
Major W. H. H. Llewellyn of Las
Cruces, is now in Washington, on u
project whereby the Mescalero Apache
Indians in Otero county are to receive
certain lands of their reservation in
severalty, the remainder to be thrown
onen and added to the public domain
for homestead settlement. Major
Llewellyn is thoroughly posted upon
the question and it is believed that the
time to carry this project into effect U
now at hand. The Mescalero reserva
tion contains many thousands of acres
of fine timber ' land and it is stated
much mineral land. Throwing the ma
jor portion of this reservation open to
settlers under the homestead laws and
to prospectors under the mineral laws
would prove of material and speedy
benefit to Otero county in particular
and to New Mexico in general.
The census of 1900, according to a
bulletin just issued, shows the remark
able fact that only two per cent of the
men of voting age who were born in
the United States of foreign parents
are classed as illiterates; while of the
white men of voting age in the country
born of native Americans 5.8 per cent
are illiterate, while of the native negro
men above voting age 47.3 per cent are
illiterate. This shows that, as undesir
able as was the large per cent of the
immigration which came to the United
States in the past decade, the children
of immigrants generally make good
and intelligent citizens. The nation as
a whole is a direct gainer by immigra
tion and while it is wise to restrict Im
migration, it would be unwise to ex
clude It altogether or even to draw th-s
line of restriction upon too narrow a
basis.
Should the Stephens or Culberson
bills to build an international dam at
El Paso become law the person who
would take out any additional ditch or
build an additional dam in the Santa
Fe river or any other stream in the
great Rio Grande valley, would be
fined $5,000 and be sent to the peniten
tiary for one year in addition to hav
ing his works taken out of the stream.
President Roosevelt has given posi
tive assurance that he will sign the
New Mexico statehood bill should it
be passed by congress. New Mexico
has a number of friends at work, in-r-iurilngr
Senator Elkins, who will help
Delegate Rodey and the New Mexico
statehood delegation to push the ena
bling act through congress. It is pos
sible however, that New Mexico will
be the only territory to receive state
hood from this session of congress ana
that Oklahoma and Arizona will have
to wait another year or two.
That there is an end to the -race issue
in sight is again shown by the census
figures which prove that the white pop
ulation of the south is growing at a
much more rapid rate than the negro
population. Thus, there are now just
about as many negroes in Pennsylva
nia as there are In Missouri, although
twenty years ago Missouri had twice
as many colored people as Pennsylva
nia. There are now more negroes in
Massachusetts than there are In Dela
ware,, which twenty years ago had 50
per cent more negroes than Massachu
setts. New Jersey has doubled its ne
gro' population while In Maryland the
white population has in twenty years
increased 230,000 and the colored popu
lation only 15,000. Virginia in twenty
years has gained in round figures S12,
000 white people and only 29,000 negroes.
North Carolina gained 400,000 white
nponle and only 93.000 in negro popula
tion. Tennessee has gained 400,000
white neoDle and only 77,000 negroes
Missouri has gained 922,000 white peo
ple and less than 16,000 negroes. Ken
tucky has gained almost 500,000 white
nennle and only 13.000 negroes. These
figures should be taken as evidence'
that the race problem is not destined
tn continue formidable, from a political,
social or industrial standpoint. There
are only two states, Mississippi ana
South Carolina, where the negroes
outnumber the whites and in South
Carolina the white population is grow
In so much faster than the black
that in twenty-five years the Caucas
ian race will predominate.

SORES AND
ULCERS.
Sores and Ulcers never become chronic
unless the blood is in poor condition ia
sluggish, weak and unable to throw ofl
the poisons that accumulate in it. The
system must be relieved of the unhealthy
matter through the sore, and great dangei
to life would follow should it heal before
the blood has been made pure and healthy
and all impurities eliminated from the ays.
tem. S.S.S. begins the cure by first cleans
ing and invigorating the blood, building
up the general health and removing from
tfie system A CONSTANT DRAIN
effeteTatk UPON THE SYSTEM.
When this has been accomplished the dis
charge gradually ceases, and the sore oi
ulcer heals. It is the tendency of these old
indolent sores to grow worse and worse,
and eventually to destroy the bones. Local
applications, while soothing and to some
extent alleviate pain, cannot reach the seal
of the trouble. S. S. S. does, and no mattei
how apparently hopeless your condition,
even though your constitution has broken
down, it will bring relief when nothing
else can. It supplies the rich, pure blood
necessary to heal the sore and nourish
the debilitated, diseased body.
Mr. T. D. Talbert, Lock Box 345, Winona, Mm,

the foot was one solid sore. Several physiciani

Evidence That Hew Mexico Was Inhabited
In Geologic Ages.
Rocky Mountain News.
When Cecil A. Deane was recently
making excavations among ruins of
the mesa dwellers near La Boca on the
New Mexico-Colorado line near Aztec,
an Tnnn conntv. he found an archae
ological treasure which has attracted
much attention from scientists.
About four feet below the surface he
unearthed an irregular shaped block of
lava weighing about 100 pounds, which
bears unmistakable evidence of the ex
treme antiquity of the people who once
lived in that region.
Within the block and exposed on its
surface are found seven ears of corn,
calcined by the lava when in a molten
condition to a jet black color, while on
the other surface is shown the impres
sion of what was doubtless shelled
corn. Adhering to the lava are a num
ber of pieces of clay, burned to a
brick red color, which show the im
pression of ferns, palm leaves and oth
er tropical foliage.
During this and at other times when
Mr. Deane has made excavations at
this place he has found evidence that
these people lived at a period so long
ago that the time of man's first occu
pation of the Nile and Euphrates val
ley were, in a comparison, but as yes
terday. Beneath two or three feet of
glacial drift deposit he encountered an
irregular layer of broken blocks of bur
ned clay and fragments of lava. The
clay once formed roofs of houses and
bears on the lower side impressions of
small loge, and vegetation now growing
only in tropical climates. Finger marks
are plainly seen in this once plastic
material. Beneath this he found car
bonized corn, fragments of pottery,
stone axes and hammers. At a still
greater depth he found several bowls,
vases and urns, and human bones
which crumbled to dust as soon as ex
posed to the atmosphere.
The acre in which these people lived
cannot be measured by centuries, but
only by geological epochs. That they
lived nrior to the glacial period is evi
dent from the fact that their ruins are
buried beneath glacial drift; the im
nressions of vegetable growth in the
clay blocks are tropical, and all scien
tists assert that the overflow of lava
so common in that region, occurred
during the closing era of the tertiary
period. Mr. Deane forwarded the
block of lava to Professor W. J. Mc-
Gee at Washington. He has received
an acknowledgment from him for the
shipment in which Professor McGee
writes at length, and states that the
corn embracing block of lava is now
one of the chief attractions in the nat
ional museum.
Considerable Truth in This.

"Something Mew Under the Sun.'
All doctors have tried to cure Ca
tarrh by the use of powders, acid gas
es, inhalers and drugs In paste form.
Their powders dry up the mucous
membranes causing them to crack op
en and bleed. The powerful acids used
in the inhal :s have entirely eaten
away the same membranes that their
makers have aimed to cure, while
pastes and ointments cannot reach the
disease. An old and experienced prac
titioner who has for many years
made a close study and specialty of the
treatment of Catarrh, has at last per
fected a treatment which when faith
fully used, not only relieves at once,
but permanently cures catarrh, by re
moving the cause, stopping the dis
charges, and curing all Inflammation.
It is the only remedy known to science
that actually reaches the afflicted

tarrh Cure," and is sold at the extreme

as the only safe and positive cure for
that annoying and disgusting disease.'
It cures all inflammation quickly and
permanently, and is also wonderfully
