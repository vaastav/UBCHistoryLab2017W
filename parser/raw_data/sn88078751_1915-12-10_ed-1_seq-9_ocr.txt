OLLOWING la the message of
President Wilson delivered at a
joint session of the senate and
bouse at the beginning of the
Sixty-fourth congress:
Gentlemen of the Congress Since I
lost had the privilege, of addressing
yon on the state of the Union the wnr
- of nations on the other side of the sen.
Which bad then only begun to disclose
Kb portentous proportions, has extend
ed its threatening and sinister scope
vntil it has swept within its flame
Bonie portion of every quarter of the
globe, not excepting our own "hemi
sphere, has altered tho wholo face of
International affairs, and now presents
prospect of reorganization and re
construction such as statesmen and
peoples have never been called upon
to attempt before.
We have stood apart, studiously neu
tral. It was our manifest duty to do
0. Not only did we have no part or
Interest In the policies which seem to
fcave brought the conflict on; it was
accessary, if a universal catastrophe
was to be avoided, that a limit should
be set to the sweep of destructive war
and that some part of the great fam
ily of nations should keep tho process
es of peace alive, if only to prevent
collective economic ruin and the break
down throughout the world of the in
dustries by which Its populations are
fed and sustained. It was manifestly
the duty of the self governed nations
of this hemisphere to redress, if possi
ble, the balance of economic loss and
confusion hi the other, if they could
do nothing more. In the day of read
justment and recuperation we earnest
ly hope and believe that they can be
of infinite service. '
In this neutrality, to which they
were bidden not only by their sep
arate life and their habitual detach
ment from the politics of Europe, but
also by i clear perception of interna
tional duty, the states of America have
become conscious of a new and more
vital community of interest and moral
partnership In affairs, more clearly
conscious at tho many common sympa
thies and interests .and duties which
bid them stand together.
There was a time in the early days
of our own great nation and of the re
publics fighting their way to independ
ence in Central and South America
when the government of the United
States looked upon Itself as in somo
ort the guardian of the republics to
the south of her as against any en
croachments or efforts at political con
trol from the other side of the water;
felt It Its duty to play the part even
without invitation from them, and I
think that we can claim that the task
was undertaken with a true and disin
terested enthusiasm for the freedom
of the Americas and the unmolested
elf' government of her independent
peoples. Rut It was always difficult tn
maintain such a role without offense
to the pride of the peoples whose free
dom of action we sought to protect
and without provoking serious mis
conceptions of our motives, and every
thoughtful man of affairs must wel
come the altered rircumstiinron nf thn
new day In whose light we now stand.1
when there is no claim of guardian
ship or thought of wards, but Instead
a full and honorable association as of
partners between ourselves and our
neighbors in the interest of all Amer
ica, north and south. Our concern for
the Independence and prosperity of the
states of Central and South America
la not altered. We retain unabated tho
spirit that has inspired us throughout
the whole life of our government and
Which was so frankly put into words
by President Monroe. We still mean
always to make a common cause of
national independence and of political
liberty in America. But that purpose
Is now better understood so far as It
concerns ourselves. It Is known not to
be a selfish purpose. It is known to
have In it no thought of taking advan
tage of any government in this hemi
sphere or playing Its pqlitlcal fortunes
for our own benefit All the govern
ments of America, stand, so far as we
are concerned, upon a footing of genu
ine equality and unquestioned inde
pendence. We have been put to the test in the
case of Mexico, and we have stood the
test Whether we-have benefited Mex
ico by the course wo have pursued re
mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in
her own hands. But we have at least
proved that we will not take advan-
( f tago of her in her distress and under
lain to impose upon tier an oraer and 1
government of our own choosing. Lib
erty is often n fierce and intractable
tbinf. to which no bounds can be set
and to 'Which no bounds' of a few

to Congress.
men's choosing ought ever to be set
Every American who has drunk at
tho true fountains of principle and tra
dition must subscribe without reserva
tion to the high doctrine of the Vir
ginia bill of lights, which in the great
days in which our government was set
up was everywhere among us accept
ed aslhe creed of free men. That doc
trine is, "That government Is or ought
to be instituted for the common bene
fit, protection and security of the peo
ple, nation or community;" that "of
all the vnrlous modes and forms of
government that is the best which is
capable of producing the greatest de
gree of happiness nnd safety and is
most effectually secured against the
danger of maladministration, and that
when any government shall be found
inadequate or contrary to these pur
poses a majority of the community
hath an Indubitable, inalienable and
indefeasible right to reform, alter or
abolish it in such manner as shall be
judged most conducive to the public
weal." We have unhesitatingly ap
plied that heroic principle to the case
of Mexico and now hopefully await
the rebirth of the troubled republic,
which had so much of which to purge
Itself and so little sympathy from any
outside quarter in the radical but nec
essary process. We will aid aDd be
friend Mexico, but we will not coerce
her, and our course with regard to her
ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer
ica that we seek no political suzerainty
or selfish control.
PAN-AMERICANISM HAS
NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT.
Economic Adjustments Inevitable Vi th
in the' Next Generation.
The moral is that the states of Amer
ica are not hostile rivals, but co-operating
friends, and that their grow
ing sense of community of interest,
alike in matters political and in mat
ters economic, is likely to give them a
new significance as factors in interna
tional affairs and in the political his
tory of the world. It presents them as
in a very deep and true scuse a unit
in world affairs, spiritual partners,
standing together because thinking to
gether, quick with common sympathies
and common ideals. Separated, they
are subject to all the cross currents of
the confused politics of a world of hos
tile rivalries; united in spirit nnd pur
pose, they cannot be disappointed of
their peaceful destiny.
This is pan-Americanism. It has none
of the spirit of empire In it. It is the
embodiment, the effectual embodiment,
of the spirit of law and independence
and liberty and mutual service.
A very notable body of men recently
met in the city of Washington, at the
invitation and as the guests of this
government, whose deliberations are
likely to be looked back to as marking
a memorable turning point in the his
tory of America. They wero repre
sentative spokesmen of the several In
dependent states of this hemisphere
and were assembled to discuss the
financial and commercial relations of
theN republics of the two continents
which nature and political fortune
have so Intimately linked together. I
earnestly recommend to your perusal
the reports of their proceedings and of
the actions of their committees. You
will get from them, I think, n fresh
conception of the ease and intelligence
and advantage with which Americans
of both continents may draw together
In practical co-operation and of what
the material foundations, of this hope
ful partnership of interest must con
sist of how we should build them and

f how necessary it is thnt we should
hasten their building.
There is, I venture to point out, an
especial significance Just now attach
ing to this whole matter of drawing
the Americas together In bonds of hon
orable partnership and mutual advan
tage because of the economic readjust
ments which the world must Inevitably
witness within the next generation,
when peace shall have at last resumed,
Its healthful tasks. In the perform
ance of these tasks I believe the Amer
icas to be destined to play their parts
together. I am interested to fix your
attention on this prospect now because
unless you take it within your view
and permit the full significance of it to
command your thought I cannot find
the right light in which to set forth
the particular matter that lies at the
very front of my- whole thought as I
address you today. I mean national
defense.
No one who really comprehends the
spirit of the great people for whom wo
are appointed to speak can fall to per
ceive that their passion is for peace,
their genius best displayed In the prac
tice of the arts of peace. Great democ
racies are not belligerent They do not
seek or desire war. Their thought is
of individual liberty and of the free
labor that supports lifo and the tin
censored thought that quickens it
Conquest nnd dominion nre not in our
reckoning or agreeable to our princi
ples. But just because we demand un
molested development and the undis
turbed government of our own lives
upon our own principles of right nnd
liberty, wo resent, from whatever
quarter it may come, the aggression we
ourselves will not practice. We insist
upon security In prosecuting our self
chosen lines of national development.
We do more than that. We demand It
also for others. We do not confine our
enthusiasm for Individual liberty nnd
free national development to the inci
dents and movements of affairs which
affect only ourselves. We feel it wher
ever there is a people that tries to walk
in these difficult paths of Independence
and right. From the first we have
made common cause with all partisans
of liberty on this side the sea and have
deemed it as important that our neigh
bors should be free from all outside
domination as that we ourselves should
be; have set America aside as a whole
for the uses of independent nations and
political freemen.
Out of such thoughts grow all our
policies. We regard war merely as a
means of asserting the rights of a peo
ple against aggression. And we are
as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta
torial power within our own nation
as of aggression from without We
will not maintain a standing army ex
cept for uses which are ns necessary
in times of peace as in times of war,
and we shall always see to it that our
military peace establishment is no
larger than Is nctually and continuous
ly needed for the uses of days in which
no enemies move against us. Bui we
do believe in a body of free citizens
ready and sufficient to take care of
themselves and of tho governments
which they have set up to serve them.
In our constitutions themselves we
have commanded that "the right of
the people to keep and bear arms shall
not be infringed," and our confidence
has been that our safety In times of
danger would lie in the rising of the
nation to take care of itself, as tho
farmers rose at Lexington.
SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.
Increase Standing Regular Force Four
Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers.
But war has never been a mere mat
ter of men and guns. It is a thing
of disciplined might If our citizens
are ever to fight' effectively upon a
sudden summons, they must know
how modern fighting is done, and what
to do when the summons comes to
render themselves immediately avail
able and Immediately effective. And
the government must be their servant
to this matter, must supply them with
the training they need to take care of
themselves and of it The military
rm of their government, which they
will not allow to direct them, tlicy may
properly use to serve them and make
their independence secure, nnd not
their own independence merely, but
tho rights nlso of those with whom
they have made common cause, should
they also be put In jeopardy. They1
must bo fitted to play the great role
in tho world, and particularly In this
hemisphere, for which they are quali
fied by principle and by chastened nm
bitlon to pay,,
It is vvltb tliese ideal" In mind that
Hie plans of the department of war for
morn adequate national defence Vrre
conceived which will laid before
yon. and V.I1H1 I nre xm to sanction
ami put lulu effect iu mwn m (hey ran
properly riillnlzed 11 ml discussed.
They Becm 111 im iln m '-utlul (Irxt
steps, and they seem to ine for the
present (sufficient.
They contemplate an Increase of the
standing force of the regular army
from Its present strength of fi,023 olll
curs and 1(I2,!)S." cnliiied men it all
services to a strength of 7,130 officers
nnd 1111,707 enlisted men, or 141,81.1
all told, all service, rank and flic, by
the addition of fifty-two companies of
coast artillery, fifteen companies of en
gineers, ten regiment of Infantry, four
regiments of field nrtlllcry and four
ncro squadrons, besides 730 ofilccrs re
quired for a great variety of extra
service, especially the all important
duty of training the citizen force of
which I shall presently qeak, 702 non
commissioned officers for fervlce In
drill, recruiting and the like and the
necessary quota of enlisted men for
the quartermaster corps, tho hospital
corps, the ordnance department and
other similar auxiliary services. These
are tho additions necessary to render
the army adequate for Its present du
ties, duties which it lias to perform
not only upon our own continental
coasts and borders and at our Interior
army posts, but ulso in the Philippines.
In the Tlawaiian' Island, at the Isth
mus and in Porto Itlco.
By way of making the country ready
to assert some part o'f its real power
promptly and upon a larger scale
should occasion arise the plan also
contemplates supplementing the army
by n force of 400,000 disciplined citi
zens, raised in Increments of 133,000 a
year throughout a period of three
years. This It Is proposed to do ,by a
process of enlistment under which the
serviceable men of tho country would
be asked to bind themselves to serve
with the colors for purposes of train
ing for short periods throughout three
years nnd to come to the colors at call
at any time throughout an additional
"furlough" period of three years. This
force of 400,000 men would be pro
vided with personal accoutcrmenU as
fast as enlisted and their equipment
for the field made ready to bo supplied
at any time. They would be assem
bled for training at stated Intervals at
convenient places in association with
suitable units oi the regular army.
Their period of animal training would
not necessarily exceed two months in
tho year.
It would depend upou the patriotic
feeling of tho younger men of the
country whether they responded to
such a call to service or not It
would depend upon the patriotic spirit
of the employers of the country wheth
er they made it possible for the young
er men in their employ to respond un
der favorable conditions or not I for
one do not doubt the patriotic devotion
either of our young men or of those
who give them employment those for
whose benefit and protection they
would in fact enlist I would look
forward to the success of such an ex
periment with entire confidence.
At least so much by way of prepara
tion for defense seems to me to be ab
solutely imperative now. We cannot
do less.
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN
FOR GREATER NAVY.
Always Looked to It as Our First and
Chief Line of Defense.
The program which will be laid he
fore you by tho secretary of the navy
Is similarly conceived. It Involves only
a shortening of the time within which
plans long matured shall be carried
out but It does make definite and ex
plicit a program which has heretofore
been only implicit held in the minds of
the committees on naval affairs and
disclosed In the debates of the two
houses, but nowhere formulated or for
mally adopted. It seems to me very
clear that It will be to the advantage
of the country for the congress to adopt
a comprehensive plan for putting the
navy upon a final footing of strength
and efficiency' and to press that plan
to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and
chief line of defense; wo have always
seen it to be our manifest course of
prudence to be strong on the sens.
Year by year we have been creating a
navy which uow ranks very high In
deed among the navies of the maritime
nations. Wo should now definitely de
termine how we shall complete what
wo have begun and how soon.
Tho program to be laid before yon
contemplates tho construction within
five years of ten battleships, six battle
cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de
stroyers, Cfteen fleet submarines.'
eighty-five coast submarines, four gun
boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni
tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one
repair ship. It is proposed that of this
number we shall the first year provide
for the construction of two battleships,
two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers,
fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines.
twenty-five coast submarines, twp gun
boats and one hospital ship; the second
year two battleships, one scout cruiser,
ten destroyers, four fleet submarines,
Ifteen coast submarines, one gunboat
and one fuel oil ship; the third year
two battleships, one battle cruiser, two
scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet
submarines and fifteen coast subma
rines; the fourth year two battleships,
two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, two fleet submarines,
fifteen coast, submarines, one amuiuulr
tlon ship nnd one fuel oil ship, and
the fifth year two battleships, one bat
tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de-.
stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen
coast submarines, one gunboat one am
munition ship and 0110 repair ship.
