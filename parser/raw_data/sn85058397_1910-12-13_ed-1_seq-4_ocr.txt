I THE HERALDREPUBLICAN ON SUTHERLANDS DEFEAT
Senator Sutherland in a special dispatch from Washington to tho
HeraldRepublican his own paper dwelling on the causes leading up
to the senators defeat says
The principal one of these was that Mr Taft was aware
of the political situation in Utah and was certain tho senator
would be returned for another term Senator Sutherland has
I always been a strong supporter of the Taft administration
and the President was averse to losing such an able adherent
especially when the Republican margin will be so small as in
the next Congress It is known that this was a factor in
making the selection of an associate justice
Another factor was that the insurgent senators were
not as friendly disposed towards Senator Sutherland as they
would be towards Judge Vandeventer or some other man
whose views upon public questions were not so well known
The senator has never hesitated to voice his sentiments
upon the great questions that come before Con
gress He is a conservative a Republican of the old school
heartily in accord with the idea of progress but there is noth
ing of the radical about him Consequently the senators of
the Bristow and Lafollette stripe would not relish him upon
the Supreme bench and there is no doubt that they took
care to see that the President knew it
We wonder if Taft was really diplomatic enough to tell Corpora =
tion Sutherland that he needed him in congress Or did George wire
that to his paper just to let himself down easy I
SUTHERLAND AND THE CORPORATIONS
Speaking of Sutherland and the Supreme bench the Tribune
says
Sutherland as a member of the Supreme Court would
be such a ghastly imposition that one doesnt like to think
of it One hardly can bring himself to believe that his name
was ever seriously considered for membership in that learned
and distinguished tribunal We shall all have to paso it by
as a sort of harrowing nightmare
The Tribune is in error if it thinks there was no chance for Suth
erland The corporations were backing Sutherland He had the solid
support of the Harriman and Gould railways That means much
Here are the Harriman railroads
The Union Pacific Railway The Southern Pacific Railway The
Central Pacific Railway The Oregon Short Line Railway The Ore
gon Railway Navigation Co The Chicago d Northwestern Rail
way The Chicago d Alton Railway The Illinois Central Railway and
a dozen smaller railways
Here is the Gould system
The Denver d Rio Grande Railway The Western Pacific Rail
way The Missouri Pacific system The Great Wabash system The Erie
Railway and its many connections The Iron Mountain Railway and
a score of smaller roads
Think of the combined strength of the gigantic combination of
all these big corporations And think of the pull these corporations
would have with other corporations and then say Sutherland did not
have a chance The wonder is that President Taft resisted the pres
sure
The truth is told in the morning dispatch which said that the pro
gressive senators served notice on the President that they would not
confirm Sutherland for Supreme judge AU hail the progressive
senators
There is still hope for the common people while Senators LaFol
lette Cummins and their insurgent associates can take the bit in
their teeth and say
Mr President if you appoint Sutherland you appoint a Cor
poration tool and we will turn him down
I
If Utah wag not in the grip of corporations there would bo no
more chance for Sutherlands reelection than for a snowball to con
I tinue to be a snowball in the hot place
Let the people rule a while is our advice and back to the woods
I with corporation greed Vale Sutherland
SOMEWHAT BETTER FEELING
somewhat better feeling has lately developed on the Stock
I Exchange Last month prices were pushed upward at too rapid a
i pace liquidation ensued and the decline which followed appears
to be bringing in fresh buying of a better character says Henry
Clews
II Other factors have also contributed to improvement The Presi
dents message was well received inasmuch as it advised the cessa
tion of attacks upon capital and advocated strengthening of confi I
dence in business This moderation of government activities which
undoubtedly did much to make capital timid and aggravate unfavor
able economic conditions was favorably accepted in financial circles
Since the Presidents message marked out no new program of im
portance it can now be taken for granted that there will be little
if any important legislation in 1911 beyond providing for appropria
tions and regular routine affairs
The country is very much in need of a breathing spell The
constant hammering at the big interests has brought about un
certainty in every branch of business and there is a feeling of distress
associated with lack of confidence
Men of wealth are hesitating to reinvest the profits of their en
terprises and that one retarding force is in itself sufficient to break
down prosperity
That part of President Tafts message which calls for a cessa
tion of attacks on capital as Henry Clews observes was well di
rected at this time as all business interests have been in a state of
nervous apprehension and the feeling of uncertainty must be al
layed by some reassuring action on the part of those high in
authority
BOOKS FOR THE CHILDREN
The appeal of the board of the Carnegie public library for books
for the children who frequent the juvenile reading rooms of the free
institution has met with a response from a number of homes where
parents of grown up children ransacking the garret or book chests
have found many volumes suitable for library use and they have
riven those books with a feeling that many little ones might be bene
fited
fitedThere
There are hundreds of children enrolled with less than 800 books
to meet their demands for good reading This is a condition which
should be overcome and wo believe the people of Ogden after being
made fully aware of those needs of the library will not hesitate to
do as several already have donedIg down
dig into the hidden recesses
of their homes and bring forth books in abundance for the children
A u
A book presented to the library is virtually a book given to 2000
t children as that number are on the library lists 1

The Ratio of Debt to Value
In this report tho Bureau of the
Census endeavors to make n compari
son between the value of salable pub
lic properties In cities and the out
standing debt Incurred in the acquisi
tion or conotructlon of such proper
ties The properties Included consist
of land buildings and equipment of
departments lands buildings and
equipment of municipal and public
service enterprises and miscellaneous
real property
The total estimated value of these
properties In 1908 was 7738199000
and the dobt outstanding against them
approximately 1213080000 The ra
tio of debt to value was therefore
41 per cent Tho ratio of outstand
ing debt Issued for land buildings
and properties of departments to tho
present value of such land buildings
and properties was 42 per cent tho
corresponding ratio for municipal ser
vice enterprises was 41 per cent and
for public service enterprises approxi
mately 57 per cent From all tho
facts considered the Inference may bo
drawn that somewhat more than one
half of the reported valuation of all
municipal properties has already boen
paid for by the cities from revonucs
received
Of especial interest is the ratio be
tween debt Incurred for wator supply
systems and the reported valuation
of such systems The valuation re
ported for 190S was G90 000000 and
the debt outstanding 312000000 or
452 per cent of the valuation The
corresponding ratio for 1907 was 43 6
per cent The ratio between the debt
of tho watersupply system of Now
York City and the valuation of the
system was 007 per cent Over one
fourth or 26 9 per cent of tho total
debt Incurred for this class of public
service enterprises is shown for this
city Tho debt outstanding against
tho watersupply systems of San
Francisco Cambridge and Atlantic
City is In excess of their valuation
