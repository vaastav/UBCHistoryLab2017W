Immense Sums Spent During Presi
dential Campaigns.
Tho Washington Post prints under d
New York date what is declared to be
an authoritative statement of the cam
paign fund raised by the republican
national committee during the last
presidential canvass and the manner
of its distribution.
The statement shows an approxi
mate aggregate of $1,900,000 was rais
ed and expended.
The Bgoreg for the McKinley cam
paign of 1900 are given as $2,800,0000
and for 18% as $3,800,000.

cratic national committee for the elec

BALFOUR AND CABINET RESIGN
King Edward Accepts Same and In
struct* Campbell-Bannerman
for Form New Cabinet.
London, Dec 5. —The political crisis
in the United Kingdom lias reached a
climax Arthur J. Ualfonr, the pre-
mier, has formerly tendered the resig
nations of himself aud the members of
his cabinet to Kin>: Edward, who ac
oepted them. Him majesty Jm.s invited
Sir Henry Campbell-Bauuermnn to an
interview, when he will offn Jiim the
mission of foimlog a new cabinet. Hir
Henry will accept the task, and within
a few days a new government will be
formed
It may be stated as certain that Eord
Rosebery will be entirely ingored in
the makeup of the cabinet and that
John Morley will be one ot the ciiief
advisers of Sir Henry in drawing np
the list of his official family, which
will be presented to his majesty.
Mr. Morley himself is considered like
ly to go to the Indian office, aud it is
probable that Herbert Henry Asquith
will be chancellor of the exchequer.
The foreign affairs portfolio will go
either to Lord Elgin or Sir Edward
firey. though the latter is considered
likely to be made secretary of the colo
nies.
One tiling is certain—that Sir Henry
('am|)bell-Baunerman has explained
liis attitude on home rule for Ireland
to those liberal leaders who are known
to be opposed to home rule on the linen
of the last bills introduced in parlia
ment. Since his speech at (Stirling,
which raised such a fuiore, Sir Henry
has not made any statement, but it is
confidently asserted in the liberal clubs
tliat he is ready with a policy which
will secure the adhesion of the British
nationalists, and at the same time
avoid raising the issue of one of the
prominent planks in bis platform.
There is some uncertainty as to when
the dissulution of parliament will be
effective, but it is not considered prob
able until after the new year.
An interesting feature of the politi
cal situation is the prospect of a closer
alliance between the Irish and the
labor parties in the new parliament.
James Keir Hardie, the socialist and
independent member, in a political
speech tonight frankly invited suoh an
alliance. He pointed out that 45 labor
members combined with 75 Irish mem
bers would provide a voting strength
which no government, however strong,
could afford to ignore.
RECORD OF LIFE SAVERS.
Thousands of Persons Rescued and
Many Crafts Saved.
The work of the life saving service
for the last fiscal year is summed up
in a report of General Superintendent
Kimball to the secretary of the treas
ury, recently made public. The life
saving crews saved and assisted in
saving 4t>4 imperiled vessels and their
cargoes, besides affording assistance
of more or less importance to 677 oth
er vessels, including craft of all kinds,
making a total of 1141 vessels to which
aid was furnished. In addition, the
report states, 83 steamers and 88 sail
ing vessels running into danger were
warned of their peril by the signals of
the patrols and lookout in time to
escape disaster. The saving of many
livos and much property is attributed
to such warnings.
No less than 365 disasters to docu
mented vessels occurred during the
period stated, involving the lives of
4809 persons, of whom 27 were lost.
The estimated value of vessels and
cargoes so affected was $10,320,660, of
which $7,917,385 was saved. Sixty
ihree vessels were totally lost. Succor
was afforded at the various stations to
62 t persons, to whom an aggregate of
1510 days 1 relief was furnished. Four
hundred and twenty casualties were
sustained by undocumented vessels,
such as sail boats and row boats, in
rolving 966 persons, 10 of whom were
lost The value of property Involved
in these casualties is estimated at
$264,690, of which $258,025 was saved.
The report concludes with an earn
est appeal for pensions to widows and
children of members of the life sav
ing crews losing their lives in the
performance of duty and for retire
inen! when disabled from injury or dis
ease incurred In the service.
Robbery at Rockford.
The safe }n the store of the Coey
Mercantile company at Rockford,
Wash., was blown up Monday night
and over $2100 in money and negoti
able was taken. Sheriff Duak was

cine to the men.
Fire in Butte Mine.
Butte, Mont., Dec. 7.— Fire in the

Only Will Occupy Attention for a
Week—New Senators Appear In
Upper House There Will Be Four
to Take the Oath.
Very little besides the organization
of tiie house will be accomplished the
first week of the session, although it
is possible that an emergency appro
priation for the Panama canal may
lie passed the last of the week. Un
til the committees are appointed such
a bill would have to be considered by
unanimous consent or under a special
order.

informed that the emergency appropri
ation will not be needed until Decem
ber 25, and consequently the bill may
not be passed until next week.
Monday was taken up with the elec
tion of a speaker and other house of
ficers. It is already understood that
the rules of the last house will be
adopted, as the members have been
sworn in. The biennial lottery for

the first day. and at its conclusion ad
journment followed. Tuesday was de
voted to tne reading of the president's

ness of the house for the week.

pleted ins committees, but it is expect
ed he wm be ready to announce them
early in the session.
Hills will be introduced every day
that the house is in session from the
beginning, and will be printed and re
ferred to tiie committees when ap
pointed. It is expected that many Im
portant propositions will be presented
during the early days of the session.
Work in Senate.
Nothing but preliminary work will
engross the attention of the senate
this first week of the session. The
senate is already organized, as it is a
continuous body, and besides, there
was a special session last spring,
when the new senators were sworn in.
Senators Brandegee of Connecticut,
Warner of Missouri, Frazier of Ten
nessee and LaFollette of Wisconsin
have not yet taken their oaths. The
two former had not been elected when
the special session adjourned.
Monday was a very short session
and the senate adjourned out of re-
Bpect for the late Senator Platt of Con-
Decticut as soon as the necessary for
malities for the beginning of a new
congress have been concluded. Tues
day the president's message waa re
ceived and read, and Wednesday was
devoted to the introduction of bills. A
short session was held Thursday, and
the senate then adjourned until the
following Monday.

MESSAGE SUMMARY
PRES, ROOSEVELT'S ADDRESS TO
CONGRESS TOOK THRtE HOURS.
Rate Regulation Demands First Atten-
tion—Present Laws Ineffective-
More Money for Canal Work—Asks
for Larger Navy—Revise Immigra
tion Laws—Change Land Laws.
Washing!.,n, i). C.—At 11:40 Tues
day morning assistant secretary to the
president, Barnes, and executive Clerk
Young and ;i messenger left the White
House bearing copies of the presi
dent's message for reading in the
house and senate and for distribution
among the member.
The reading of the message began
at 12:23, eight minutes later than in
the senate. It required three hours to
read.
President's Message.
To tlit' Senate and House of Rep
resentatives—The people of this coun
try continue to enjoy great prosperity.
Undoubtedly there will be ebb and
How in such prosperity, ami this ebb
and flow will be felt more or less by
ail memben of the community, both
by the deserving and undeserving.
Against the wrath of the Lord the wis
dom of man can not avail; in times
of flood or drought human Ingenuity
can but partially repair the disaster.
A general failure of crops would hurt
all of us. Again, if the folly of man
mars the general well-being, then
those who are innocent of the folly
will have to pay part of the penalty
incurred by those who are guilty of
the folly. A panic brought on by the
speculative folly of part of the busi
ness community would hurt the whole
business community. But such stop
page of welfare, though it might be
severe, would not be lasting. In the
long run the one vital factor in the
permanent prosperity of the country
is the high individual character of
the average American citizen, no mat
it r whether his work be mental or
manual, whether he be farmer or
wage-worker, business man or profes
sional man.
Talks on Corporations.
Corporations are the first great sub
ject dealt with. He says he is not
opposed to corpora.!ions. Like trade
unions they have come to slay. Each
in list be checked when they are not
doing good. He thinks their regula
tion possible under existing conditions
but if not the constitution must be
amended. The power to regulate must
lie affirmative and given to some ad
ministrative body created by congress.
He says such a body should have the
power to judge of the reasonableness
of a railroad rate and to prescribe the
limit beyond which it shall be unlaw
ful to go. All decisions on rates must
be subject to revision by the courts.
He does not favor power being given
to originate rates, but to regulate
rates already fixed.
"I regard the power to establish
a maximum rate as being essential
to any scheme of real reform in the
matter of railway regulation.
All private car lines, industrial
roads. refrigerator charges, etc.,
should be controlled by the commis
sion.
Labor Question Taken Up.
Again recommends compulsory use
of block signals on interstate railroads
and recommend regulation of hours
of railroad workmen and the liability
of employer! for injuries. He says
it would be unwise to deprive courts of
power of injunction in labor matters.
Recommend! thorough investigation
of labor matters, child labor, healthy
factories, reasonable hours.
!!■■ recommends consideration of
fed< ral supervision of insurance. He
says the needs and desires of the
people should be consulted on tariff
matters.
Says economy in expenditures is ab
solutely necessary this year. Advises
the addition of the element of elastic
ity to our currency.
He wants better business methods
in the various departments at Wash
ington. Also recommends supervision
of federal elections and campaign ex
penditures.
International Matters.
The various matters affecting inter
national law coming before the next
Hague convention are discussed at
hUK ■■• Ho discussed the Monroe doc
trine as an aiu to the world peace and
in i his connection the San Domingoan
situation.
Canal Funds Forthcoming..
The Hepburn bill, appropriating
116,600,000 for the canal, will pass
the house Thursday without reference
to committee, either by unanimous
consent or by special rule.
In this connection he also discussed
the army and navy. He recommends
general maneuvers and promotions
based on ability or seniority, rie
says increase the navy. Revision of
the naturalization and criminal laws
are recommended. He says public
land laws should be changed to suit
our needs today.
He recommends to congress consid
eration of the Mississippi levees, mer
chant marine, Jamestown Tencennial,
care of confederate soldiers' graves.
He discusses at great length im
migration and Its evils and the neces
sity of the revision of present laws.
He also considers the civil service
and its needs, copyright laws, adulter
ation of foods, smoke nuisance in
Washington, and national parks, rec
ommending an extension of Yellow
stone Park south and east. Life *
ing stations and the Indians are ata^
dealt with. :/;, ■» ;| aiß°
He talks at length on the Philip
Pines their Improvement and nee"*-
Says the most encouraging feature i.
increase of school children from Mill
000 to 600.000. He recommends 5
trade between the United States l!
the Philippines. He considers '!
Rico and insular affairs in general. '
Delegate for Alaska.
He earnestly asks for an elective
SKriJr? Alaska and recommend!
that Oklahoma and Indian Territory'
be admitted as one state and that
New Mexico and Arizona be admitted
as one state. '
He goes into canal affairs, but says
he will recommend type at a later
date. He finishes with the reeommen-
datlon for more adequate provision for
the state department.

Army and Navy Even.
Princeton, N l. J. —Army 6, navy 6.
While the army-navy football game
Saturday was probably one of the
most exciting ever played between the
two institutions, it was simply a side
show to the social football event of
the season. The 25,000 people saw
the game. From all sections of the
United States came spectators who or
dinarily would not travel a score of
miles to see a football contest. All
this was doubtless brought about bf
the fact that President Roosevelt w»s
