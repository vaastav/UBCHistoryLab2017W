Amendment of Present Law
It is learned at the Interstate Com
merce Commission that in all probabil
ity a law will be passed by the present
cession of Congress to allow the railways
of the country to enter into pooling ar
rangements Thpre lias been some differ
ence of opinion In the commission regard
ing the desirability of such a law but
It Is understood that as a body it is now
In favor of allowing pooling agreements
provided the commission la given super
vision over them and also given control
over freight rates The railway Interests
generally It Is said are willing to con
cede to the commission the right to fix
maximum rates and to enforce Its de
cisions for the sake of obtaining in return
he right to make pooling agreements
president ItnuxeveltN Vlt vv
The Presidents message takes up the
long debated question of the relation be
tween the Interstate Commerce Cornmls
flon and the railways very much along
these lines The paragraphs on the sub
ject are explV itly In favor of amendments
to fie uresent law giving tho commis
sion greater power as to the supervision
of rates on interstate commerce and mak
ing it possible to enforce its rulings In
the courts K necessary
There is no direct recommendation In
favor of allowing the railways to enter
pools forthefixineand maintenance of uni
form rates but authorities on the subject
state that the intimation of favor toward
the plan is so fcuHlclontly clear as not
to be capable of any other interprcta
tion President Roosevelt says
Those who complain of tho manage
ment of the railways allege that estab
lished rates are not maintained that re
bates and similar devices arc habitually
resorted to that these preferences are
usually in favor of the large shipper that
they drive out of business the smaller
competitor that while many rates are
toe low many others ore excessive and
that gross preferences are made affect
ing both localities and commodities
Vpon the other hand the railways assert
that the Interstate commerce law by its
very terms tends to produce many of
these illegal practices by depriving car
riers of that right of concerted action
which they claim Is necessary to estab
lish and maintain nondiscriminating
rat s
A CJinnK l Iitvr lntnrrd
The act should be amended The rall
TW Is a public sTv nt rates should
I Just lo and open to nil shippers alike
The Government sfcould see to it that
within Its jurisdiction this is so and
ehould provide a speedy Inexpensive and
emedy 1f that ccd At tha same
WILL shortly begin serial publication
in McClure1 s This new novel rings
with the same fresh romantic note and dis
plays the same rare gift of dramatic construc
tion that made his other works immediate
successes and keep them in demand to day
The story deals with liic in Indiana at the
time of the Mexican War a time of simple
culture and much joy of life when the rigors
of the ruder pioneer life had passed away and
the people were still untouched by the com
mercial spirit that came with the railroads
In the bustle of eople and events constantly apjear the hero and
heroine whose love is the main theme of the story This ideal love
story is the more interesting because it comes out of a characteristic
American period that has never before been so beautifully portrayed

by the kindly sym

his comments as by
their sanity their
shrewdness and the
rollicking humor of
their presentation In
the papers to be pub
lished in McClurcs

best evidence of the value of McCLURES is its large circulation which
THE averaged 378000 a month during the past year and is steadily growing
No other magazine publishing the best in literature and the best in art can
point to such a large circulation This circulation is of the best quality intelligent
thinking men and women The rnost enterprising business concerns appreciate this
fact and have chosen McCLURES above all as the medium in which to present
their wares to public attention The advertising too is of a most interesting char
acter Juituis much brains energy and skill are spent in its preparation and editing
as arc put into any form of journalistic enterprise
time nothing could be more foolish than
the enactment of legislation which would
unnecessarily interfere with the develop
ment and operation of these commercial
agencies
The ConiiiilNNluuN HnndH Tied
The statement may be made oa very
good authority that this view is the one
entertained by the commission as a body
The commission Is now framing its an
nual report and one of the chief sub
jects treated is thl3 question As In for
mer years the report will make a stren
uous plea for more power asserting that
under the present law its bands are tied
and Its ability to stop abuses and remedy
evils almost nil The commission will be
more explicit In Its favorable attitude
toward pooling agreements than the
President Is and will virtually agree mat
they are necessary for the maintenance
of non discriminating raten
The railway presidents of the country
will meet in New York tomorrow for the
discussion of the entire broad question
and It is known that they too or at loast
the majority of them tv 111 be in favor of
the compromise of Government control
and the right to maintain pools The
meeting will be a secret one and it is
not likely that any definite information
regarding the action will find Its way to
the public Immediately but the views of
Individual men are known and from them
It Is asserted that there can be no ques
tion as 10 the general line -of the discus
sion that will take place and its re
sults
To Irniue a Hill
Later in the year or perhaps not until
the first month of next year there will
be conferences between railway men and
Hie Interstate Commerce Commission and
a bill acceptable to both parties will then
be framed
There has been some suggestion that
the railways will propose -a bill to give
the commission supervision over rates
only where pooling arrangements re en
tered into Such a bill would allow any
railroad averse to supervision to remain
out of the pools It Is known that tho
commission will not favor such a law and
it Is thought to be hardly probable that
the proposition will be taken up seriously
It is pointed out that such a law would
be little if any better than the present
one as the railways remaining out af the
pool would be able practically to nullify
Its effect by cutting rates on long hauls
and advancing rates on non comretltlvo
busiuess
The struggle on the part of the comnls
slou for more power nnd on the pjrt of
the railways for pooling rights has been
going on for a number of years Each
party has been unwilling to concede the
rights of the other and together work
ing against each other they have been
able to bring enough Influence to bear In
Congress to prevent the passage of any
law whatever up to the present time

Unjust discrimination Is the com1
plaint of fifty or more policemen who
guard the National Capital street cross
ings in regard to the recent action of the
police powers in refusing to allow the
crossing men to pay for their recently
adopted brown helmets on the Installment
plan
New Helmet Ordered
Not long ago Chief Sylvester decided to
change the headgear of the crossing men
in order that they might be distinguished
from members of the regular force Dark
brown hulmets were determined upon
At this action the crossing men took
no offen e Harmony prevailed until yes
terday afternoon when the men repaired
to a local hatters establishment to be
provided with their new headgear To
their surprise and Indignation they were
Informed that the powers who be had
ordered that the crossing men must pay
for their new helmets before receiving
them Instead of allowius the bluecoats to
pay for them by January 1 as has been
the custom In the past
Did Nut Hnvc the Irlre
Nearly all of the men had spent tho 75
of wages drawn last Monday and conse
quently did not have the necessary 2 40
to give up The proprietor of the store
where thev went lo secure their hats
would have been willing to let the auxil
iary policemen pay for their headgear at
the first of next month but was unable
to do so because of the positive inter
diction made by the police officials
Not more than ten out of the fifty odd
policemen secured the brown helmets
and even those wl o were fortunate
enough to possess the small sum of 210
and paid It for the helmets were In any
thing but a pleasant frame of mind re
garding the question
Ciijust UiNcriiuliifilioii Clinrced
The crossing men It seems for some
time past have been kicking against what
they term unjust discrimination upon
the part of the police ofilclals They In
sist that although their wages are paid
them by the street car companies they
vcar the same uniforms and do practically
the same duty as the police of the regular
force and Inasmuch are entitled to the
same privileges Ihej ome time ago
wanted the same amount of annual leave
given the regulars and were Informed
I hat their wishes tould not be granted
A crossing officer It was stated by an
official does not do more than eight
hours trick of dally duty while the regu
lar practically lives In the station houte
This It Is said is the reason that their
wishes could not be granted
A CroNxiiiK Miiuh Ciiiniiliilnl
One of the crossing men when seen
last night was especially bltur against
the heads of the local police department
regarding their action in the helmet cases
There are Just as many honest men
on crossing duty said he as on the
regular force We were appointed by
varlous SenatorB and Heprescutatlvcs
some of whom wo were Intimately ac
quainted with I think tho action taken
by the officials in refusing to trust us

As I understand It the Antl Saloou
League stands for no compromise I
would not have a perpetual license with

one saloon if all the rejt of the saloons
In that place were to be abolished For
then v e would enter a compromise 1
would not have the post sxchaiige re

fringe the army posts What we want Is
to abolish this fringe without entering the
compromise of having ihe army post ex

Anarchy is fostered in every saloon

That anarchy is fostered In every saloon
Is easily demonstrated by the fact that

CORONER SAYS ALCOHOLISM
Hut Sslil Inudnnum
Canted Y V Ilronks Dentil
Despite the fact that the physicians at
the Casualty Hospital announced that
William W Brooks died of laudanum
poisoning the Coroner yesterday gave a
certificate of death from alcoholism
No autopsy was performed
Brooks wasiound In an unconscious con
dition about midnight Sunday in a littlo
shanty at 17 D Street northwest where
he had lived for the past eight years He
was hurried to the Casualty Hospital
where the physicians declared they de-
tected unmistakable symptoms of lau
danum poisoning Brooks was uncon
scious and remained so until he died
about 730 oclock Monday night
No trace of a laudanum bottle was
found in the shanty but there -was a
partly emptied whisky flask of which
Brooks had been a frequent user The
