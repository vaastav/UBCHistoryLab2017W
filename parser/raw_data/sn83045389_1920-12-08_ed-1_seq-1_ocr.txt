another succession of conference* in
which he t??1Kwith his party ;imo
dates about the league of nations, j
the selection of .1 Cabfnet and other j
problems confronting him In the

?Jrovn up to the north eniranv to
the executive mansion, where it wsw
met by I. H iloovir, chief visiter at
tho White House. Mr. Harding pre
sented the cards, saying that lie de
sired to leave them "for the Presi
dent" and then continued on to the
station.
All of those with whom the presi
(Ifrllt-ClMt conferred today preserved
silence regarding the details of the |
dlacuosions. and Mr. liarnnig himself
said the conversations were strictly
of a confidential nature. Ho repeat
ed his statement of yesterday that ho
was seeking by direct personal con
sultation to frame an administra
tive policy behind which every one
?ould un'!.\
Summoned All I'lasnra.
lti his search for information, and
idvi.'e about the league, tlie Presi
dent-elect summoned Republican
Senators <jf tlie irreconcilable and of J
'he mild-reservation groups alike,
and it Is understood ho told 'hem
of) wanted sti*jcstloim from every I
quarter. Without submitting any j
oncre.u plan of his own. he :s uald !
to have asked plainly what sort of I
international agreement eaoh of hisi
conferees would support.
The discussion of < 'abinel ?e- I
lections held a wider scope, several |
of his most trusted friends under- |
taking to canvass the situation in [
separate conferences at various placesj
throughout the capital. Harry M.J
Daugherty. of Ohio, his pre-conven- |
tion manager, was one of the most
active in Uiis task, seeing various
members of the Senate and House
in Mr. Harding's office, while the
President-elect was occupied with his
own Ptring of callers at the resi
dence of Edward 11. McLean, his host.
Former Senator John W. Weeks. of
Massachusetts, who. like Mr. Daugh
crty, has been prominently mentioned j
ae a likely candidate for Cabinet |
honors, also saw several prominent I
Republican leaders after he had |
talked to Mr Harding. A third, who j
performed a similar tr.is.sion. was j
Senator Kail, of New Mexico, whose |
activities brought his name into fresh '
prominence as a possible secretary In
the oflicia! family of the next Presi
dent.
Sprnrfr nnil Kelloicfr Call.
Among thotfe who called on Mr.
Harding during the day were Sena
tors Spencer, of Missouri, and Kellogg

fornia, leader of the irreconcilables:
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, the
Republican Senate leader, and Sena
tors Smoot, of L'tah; Calder. of New
York; Norris, of Nebraska, and
Phlpps. of Colorado.
Discussion ef patronage, however,
was understood to have been forbid
den at the various conferences, sev
eral of the Senators who saw the
President-elect quoting hint as saying
that it was "too early" to consider
appointments of ambassadors rtr of
other ofllcials.
The Pre?ident-clect remained at the
McLean residence all day, disappoint
ing a swarm of callers who congre
gated at his office In the Senate Ofllce

or nearly a month, most of which has
been devoted to their vocation trip to
Texas and Panama. They do not ex
pect to return here until Tnaugura- j
tion Day.
In addition to conferring with cen- !
gressionnl and other political leaders,
Senator Harding received informally
during tho day Sir Auckland Gcdde.s.
the British ambassador. The latter's
visit was (tald to be merely a call
of social courtesy, In which no mon
tlon of diplomatic subjects was made.
It became known also that General
Nlvelle, the French hero of Verdun,
j during his visit here lato last night,
paid a quiet call on the President
elect and talked with 'him for a half
hour about bla war experiencea.

M. Koss. a local newspaper man, who !
claims to have conversed near San!

ton Smith, sought in connection with j
the fatal shooting at A rdmore. Ok la., j
o:" Jake \j. Hamon, was taken int i j
custody by police detectives at his
home here early today, lie was
later, released.
Uoss. according to the police, re
fused to tell the whereabouts uf the
young woman, asserting that he
would go to jail first.
Ho told his questioners, it was
stated, that he first encountered Miss
Smith on the streets of San Antonio
and that she tried to evade him by
driving away in a large motor car.
He said that he pursued her in a
smaller car, but being unable to
overtake her, hired a large service
car and resumed the chase, catching
her just outside the city limits.
Following the questioning of Koss.
police officials said they were inclined
to abandon the search for Miss Smith
here, especially after detectives had
made an investigation at one of the
leading hotels and failed to find any
trace of her. A report from Okla
homa City had hinted that she could
be found at the hotel.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.?The Norris
it-solution seeking to extend emer
gency tlnancial nifl to tho agricul
tural Industry met prompt and unex
pected opposition in the Senate today,
and after joint protests or Senator
Lodge, the Republican floor k-iuler,
and Senator cJlniw. of Virginia, former!
Secretory oC the Treasury, the resolu
tion went to tho calendar and im-J

OppoHCH One I'rnvUlon.
i he opposition <?f Senator Class !
was not directed primarily at the |
provision of tlie resolution demanding j
that tho Treasury Department revoke I
its order .cheeking the oprratlon.s of
^ ;'r Finuiice Corporation. l>ut
rather ;o the section relating to re- I
discount rattw of tho Federal reserve 1
systr-m. Senator Class said any pro-j
i>osal by Congress to low er the !?tc r- [
est rate of tho reserve system and
attack the present policy of ty- Fed
eral Reserve Roard would make our
banking system not a reserve system,
but an Investment system.
The Norris resolution had been
agreed upon by the Senate Agricul
ture Committee following the recent
coalition effected between Southern
and Western Senators who are being
hard pressed by their farmer con
stituents.
"Proposed Relief ( nwlse."
Although he comes from an agri
cultural State. Senator Olasa warned
that the relief proposed was unwise.
?The discussion here," 3ald Senator
Class, "appears to concern only one
? eature or tho resolution?the pro
position to re-establish the War
Finance Corporation.
1 want to direct the most serious
attention of the Senate to the fact
that the resolution baa another sec
tion which constitutes a virtual at-I
tr.ck upon the policy of i lie Federal
K"?f rve Hoard and calls for a re
versal r.f that policy. This section
relates to the lowering of the redis
count rates of the reserve system.
? This is a far-reaching proposal In
volving a complete ehango In policy.
If we are to have this it means that
ou: banking and currency system does
not remain a reserve system, but that
I* becomes an investment system, i
think the careful attention of 'the I
Senate should be called to such a
dangerous proposal."

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.?13oth
hnuties of Congress were In brief
session today t<> hear President Wil
son's annual message. Jt was read
l>y the clrrkf. Mr. Wilson having
heeded the advice of his physician
not to apptur in person to present
his recommendations.
Galleries in both Senate and Houso
were crowded. Uoth those drawn
by the chunce that tho President,
might appear In person or by the
possibility that his messago might
touch upon the league of nations
question or his own approaching: re
tirement to private life, were dis
appointed.
Mr. Wilson confined himself almost
wholly to domestic questions. Only
j by inference did hiu message refer
to the nearing close of his adminis
tration, and that was in tho con
cluding paragraph.
Tho proposals ho presented, the
President wrote, were not so much 11
series of recommendations as a con
1 fesslon of the "faith in which I was
bred, and .vhlch it is my solemn pur
pose to stand by until my last flght
5 tng day."
Aside from hearing the President's
.message. Congress made definite
progress on at least one of the prob
| lems it faces during the brief ses
sion. Tho House received a rule un
d< r which an effort will bo made
Thursday to take up the immigration
bill fur prompt action. It would
limit general debate to four hours.
The two-day Interval was allowed
to permit Representative Siege!, of
New York, a member of tho Immi
gration Committee, to frame a min
ority report.
Otbrr Matter* llftfrrtd.
No other matter in either House
had passed today beyond the coin
mitteo stage. At both ends of the
Capitol, however, members wore deep
in plans to deal with business de
pression. unemployment and farmers'
relief. Discussions in tho Senate of
the plight of farmers delayed the
reading of the President's message
in that body.
The industrial situation also found
a place in the President's message.
Recovery from war effects gave
promise of early completion "only in
our own fortunate country," said Mr.
Wilson, and even hero "halts and
Is Impeded at times." A program of
"immediately serviceable acts of leg
islation" to aid that recovery, "and
prove the indestructible recuperative
force of u Kreut government of the
people" should be undertaken. Mr.
Wilson said, adding:
"One of these Is to prove that a
great democracy can keop house as
successfully and in as businesslike
fashion as any other government."
First among the recommended steps
Mr. Wilson placed enactment of a
"workable budget system." He said
he had vetoed tho budget bill passed
at the last session "reluctantly." and
because of "a constitutional objec
tion," but as It was later revised in
the House ho believed it would, with
other measures, furnish "foundations
for a national budget system."
Cite* .Vutionnl Debt Figure*.
Mr. Wilson cited figures as to tho
national debt, and urged "rigid econ
omy" in which all branches of the
government should co-operate,
"the necessity of economy In govern
"l cannot overemphasise." he said,
mont appropriations and expenditures
and the avoidance by Congress of
practices which take money from the
Treasury by Indefinite or revolving
fund appropriations."
This year's estimates "strikingly"
illustrated the importance of spe
cific appropriations, the President
added, the transportation act having
"disturbed" tho relationship between
current receipts and expenditures to
tho ?xtent of over $1,000,000,000,
"It is obvious." the message con
tinued. "that these largo pr.yments
have already seriously limited the
government's progress In retiring the
floating debt."
The President renewed somo of the
recommendations tie mado at th?
opening of tho last session, and add'
ed:
"I do not foel it my privlle>r? at
present to suggest the detailed and
particular methods by which theso
