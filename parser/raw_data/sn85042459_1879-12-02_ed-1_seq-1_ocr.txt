WASHINGTON, Nov. £9.—lt is
learned that the President's mes
sage has been purchased from par
ties uuknown, and will undoubted
ly be printed to-morrow morning.
A representative of tlie Associated
Tress waited ou President Hayes
this evening aud asked, in view of
tliis fact, for authority to send it to
ail points. Tho President, while
regretting that such publication
was threatened, said that his duty
in the mater was clear, and that
bis annual messages were addressed
to Congress aud he could not under
any circumstances countenance a
course which contemplated their
prematura publication.
A Heartless Frnlrlcltle.
Pokti.and, Me., November 30.—
James M. Lowe, arrested for tlie
murder of his brother, Joseph A.
Lowe, on the 27th of September,
was arraigned yesterday afternoon
and pleaded guilty. He was re
manded to await tlie aotiou of the
Qraud Jury in Jauuary, and his
wifo was held as a witness and
committed iv default of $1,000 ball.
Lowe last night confessed that
about 3 o'clock on the morning of
the murder he hid behiud a bam
door, aDd when his brother went in
lie struck him with an ax, felling
liiiu to the ground. The blow,
however, did not extiuguflh the
brother's lantern, and by its light
he struck a second blow, nearly
severing the hoad from tbe body.
He then put out the light and
walked back to Portland, reaching
there at 4:30. The trouble between
the brothers was occasioned by
what was believed to be an unjust
discrimination by the father in re
gard to property.

New York, Nov. 30.—A cable
dispatch from Dublin to the Herald
says: Tho flame of agitation is
again burning brightly. Meetings
are to be held to-day iv all parts of
Ireland and Euglaud. A great seu
eation has beeu caused in Ireland
by Gladstone's reference to the
Irish Church. "Down to the year
1868," says the ex-Premlor, "and
the dissolution of that year, the
whole question of tbe Irish
Church was dead. Nobody cared
for it. Nobody paid attention
to it. In England circumstances
oocured whicli drew the attention
of tbe people to the Irish Church. I
had lv 1885 said that I believed It
was out of the range of practical
politics. Now it came to this, that
a jail ln the heart of the metropolis
was broken open under circum
stances which drew the attention of
the English people to the state of
Ireland, and when in Manchester a
policeman was murdered In the ex
ecution of his duty, at once the
whole country became alive to the
QUESTION OF THE IRISH CHURCH.
It came within the range of practi
cal politics, and tlio Irish Church
Act followed." The natural infer
ence among the opponents of land
lordism iv Ireland is that if the
blowing up of one jail and the mur
dering of a solitary policeman
brought about the passing of a
Church Act, perhaps the blowing
up of two jails and the killing of a
few landlords would pass a land
Act. At all events, the agi
tators feel greatly encouraged
by Mr. Gladstone's language.
I understand from tho leaders
of the agitation that they
Intend to carry the movement Into
Kugland, where many large meet
ings have already been organized.
Parneli himself will speak at Liv
erpool and Davitt at Newcastle-on-
Tyne to-day (Sunday). The
next 'hree or four weeks will prob
ably witness a great development
of the agitation. More organiza
tions exist lv the west of Ireland
than is generally believed. I was
informed last night by a gentleman
in a position to know, that
SECRET, ORGANIZED DRILLING
Is going on constantly there. It is
now stated that Parneli will proba
bly not go to America in conse
quence of the arrests and comiug
trials.
There was n torchlight procession
composed of 4000 persons at Kil
rush, county of Clare (Ireland), last
night, which was witnessed by an
immense crowd, who cheered for
tho prisoners and O'Donovan
Rossa.
A great demonstration by unem
ployed laborers has taken place at
Jtiallena, county of Mayo.
Daly, the agitator, has arrived at
Castlebar, county of Mayo, aud
was received with great enthusi
asm.

THE AGITATORS' COUNSEL.
An Eccentric Genius—The Count Joannes of
Ireland—His unsuccessful effort to get into
Prison—The Man whoso Humors have brokon
the hearts of one Mayor and two Judges.
New York, Nov. 29. —A Herald
cablegram from Sligo says: After
watching these cases for five days,
aud talking to all the principal peo
ple concerned in them, I have come
to the conclusion that however ill
advised the arrests may have been
on the score of the doubtful success
of the prosecution with Irish judges,
tlie effect has been magical on the
leading agitators, who now revile
tbe Government for unconstitu
tional measures, while their own
sentiments and speeches have been
utterly destitute of moderation or
good judgment. The prosecution,
as conducted hy the officers of the
Crown, lias been remarkably in
dulgent; at tho Hume time it has
been firm. It is said that Parneli
and one or two other prominent
leaders have grown somewhat jeul
)us of the prominence into wnich
three comparatively obscure agi
tators have suddenly sprung. Two
:>f tho latter are now prominently
mentioned for Parliament. John
Rea, the Belfast attorney, is the
L'ouut Joaunes of Ireland, and ia
one of the most curious characters
lv the country. Ho is pugnacious
and obstructive to a degree. With
this he is audaciously witty. His
sallies keep the audience in roars of
laughter. He has beeu arrested for
oontempt of Court and ejected
from Belfast Court-rooms at least
twenty times, and tlie more he lias
beeu ejected the more violent has
been his tone when again admitted.
It is reliably stated that one Mayor
and two Judges in Belfaßt have
DIED OF BROKEN HEARTS,
111 consequence of tbe exuberance
of his verbosity and the i>ertinaclty
of his obstructive policy. John Rea
once made his way Into the House
of Commons, iuterrupted the pro
ceedings, apostrophized tJ'i'Speak
er, and had to be removed by ' six
Sergeautß-at-Arms. His connect
ion with the present case is J .c to
Mr. Biggar, RI. P., who, t' nking
.hat obstruction had succ ded so
.veil at Westminster, might
Drove a trump card at Belfast, was
itruck with tlie idea that Rea
would do moro to turn the pro
jeedlugs into a farce than any man
iv the country, whereupon he
retained the services of thateccen
trio gentleman and sent bim to
31igo. Wheu Mr. Parneli heard of
it, be used his inlluence with Da
vitt and Daly and persuaded them
to deollne Ilea's services. KilleD,
out of defeienco to the wishes of
his friend Biggar, allowed Rea to
undertake his defense. The conse
quence was that Kilieu's case
which has already beeu prolougei
for three days, would have lasted
till the end of the week but for the
firmness of the magistrates, who
had to send down witness after wit
ness| because Rea wasted hours in
asking immaterial questions and
making speeches on every subject
To-day they got

morning with the firm intention
of being committed to jail for con
