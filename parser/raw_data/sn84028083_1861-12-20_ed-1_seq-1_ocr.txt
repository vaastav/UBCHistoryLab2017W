Ed. Democrat : We, by one of the
GallipoliH papers christened "Tbs Blood

as yet, earned any oilier title, and have
perhaps little ol interest to chronicle. 1
believe you have bad a communication
irom us al this camp, but am not sure.
Il is tbe finest situation tbat we have had.
It is located about one mile Irom Louis
ville, back of the depot on the Louisville
a. cd Nashville Railroad. Onr tenia r.re
pitched in a prove of majestic oak rud
beech trees. Tiie parade ground is large
and fine.and our drills are daily witnessed
by large nuraoeit from llie city. They
pive us credit for being the best-drilled
Uegimect that his yet beeu quartered near
the city. 1 . Our Band also is highly praised.

distance is about fifty miles, and we hip
to make the trip on loot. No extra bay
gage is to be allowed irnnxportutioo, and
some of the boys are tolling their extra

making arrangems nts lo leave them and
some lo pack them. Aa she weather is

The people of Ky., though loyal, feel

Their patriotism makes them with ut, but
their education, prejudices and sympathies

Many of them still yearn for some com
promise. There are some exceptions.--One
instance is loo good to be lost. One
of (lie leading men in Louisville was asked
'il he was for subjugation." lie replied
No ! he had been, but was now for tn

FROM CAMP DENNISON.
CAMP DENNISON, Dec. 8th, 1861.
Ed. Dp.m : Tho patriot at homo, who is

ho can furnish a cart-load of good wishes
tor its cause i the statesman, who it to anx

iho country over, making war speeches;
uud tho divino, who prays so lustily for lhe
salvation of tho souls engaged In this Strug

of tho reulitiot and hardships connected
with tbe war sorvioe, at tho school-boy who
spends his hours of recreation lo riding
broom-sticks, and cutting down tnullon
stalks. These tew, disconnected linel, are
writtenitnr the purpose ol protraying a fo
things connected witn active torvice; or,
porhapt I should lay, of in sotire service in
camp.
The first tbirg that claims tho attention
of tho soldier, it reveille, which it sounded
a little before daylight. At thit sound, he
"turns out, forms in rauks wttb bis com
puoions, and stands witb chattering teeth
until iho roil it called, which it dona by our
gentlemanly Orderly, John Pike. Tbe
toeding of tho hnreot, (rhioli ooiomonces at

men, uuuor too directions ot a Uorporal.
At 7 o'clock, tbe breakfast cell is sounded.
Our rations are not as gaud as they cere
at uamp wado, but we make out to got
enough, such aa they n.o. At soon rs wo

Al S o clock is ruuid mounting. After
going through with guard ixnnntin;, tbe

A; 9. o'clock, tbe tund ot the luglo
salutes Ins ear, and luat woiul cry of "1 all

The drill (mounlod) lasts from It until 1 LSI,
vrhen Iho lecull kiowti, and they return
lo thoir quarter for dinner, and a rost of
an bour aud a balf. At 10 o ulock the bvglo
sounds again for drill, and ti.it drill lasts
until 3:3U P. M.
At 4 o'clock it Dress Parsdo, (mounted,)
which Irsts about an hour, aud, to otie that

At 0 o'clock, t'je tapper cc'.l Si sounded,
and the boys go, plate in hf.nd, to the ooeh
tent, and draw their rations of fat pork and
baker's bread, and, "verily, thoy aru eontent
therewith.
At 0 o'clock, the retreat call it blowu.
Then the roll ia again called, and icimodi
aielv after the stable call is again blown.
and tho boys all return to tbe 'picket," lo
to take care or their "onargert.
As 8 o'clock P. M., the tattoo roll Is callcJ,
and we all retire to our eouohea of hard

which had just boeu patented ut Bradf'.ii J.
and a small sample of which had beeu sent
lo Lcipsio. Bussot at onco bought n low

ho tent lor his tailor, and shewing him the

that ho could not possibly get ut Iwnuigs
berg the ttuff required, and iu his dospair
ho tent lor another tailor, who declared tho
quantity qnito sufficient, nnd actually
brought in a few days the ready coat, lo the
entire satisfaction of the astronomor. On
his walk to the University ono morning, a
schoolboy passed him with his hooks under
his arm, and clad in a juckot nf the very
tame pattern and cloth ho was sn proud ot ;
stopping tho lad, bu inquired of him lo
whom he belonged, and was not a little sur
prised to loam that the father was tho vory
tailor who mado him tho coat. Thero was
no doubt now, that tho tailor had found the
quantity ample enough to cutout of the
uxcets a jacket for his boy. Ho nskeil tho
boy to accompany him homo for a few min
utes, whence bo tent for his first tailor; tho
latter having arrived, ho told biin to look
al hit coat, and at tho j.sckot of thu boy,
and lay whether both aro not made of one
and Iho tamo pieco. Tho tailor having
affirmed the fact, Besiol tnld him that tho
boy belonged to tho tailor who actually
mado him tho cost. "And, now, I ask you.
my good fellow," continund tho professor,
in a auriout lone, "how comes it, that you
thought tho quantity insufficient even fer
my own coat, while your brothor-luilor
found it oven enough lo sparo somn.hing
for hit boy ; hnw do you explain that, man?"
"In tbe most simplo way, your honor; my

Chinese Punishments.
For offences of a soiuewhm giaro descrip
tion, tho Tchtt or Cunguo, is nno of the
moit frequent and distressing. Its severity,
howovor, it roferablo rather to mental agony
than bodily tufforiiig. Tho instrument
itself is a heavy woodoi. frame-work, formed
of two motions fastonod ut nno end by a
hinge, and at Iho other by a look or sore.
'The nock ot the culprit passes through a
holo in tho contro, and his hands through a
smaller aporturo on each sitln. Sometimes
he is iudulgod with the freedom of ono
hand, which he employs in relieving the
weight of tho cangue from Iho gullod shoul
ders. Over Iho screw which tocurot the
sections enclosing the offender's nock a
paper it gonorally pasted, lo which is affixed
Ibo seal or "chop uf tho committing manda
rin, and over another part of Iho log, a
placard letting forth their crime which it
visited by this degradation.
Tbo weight of iheso movablo pillories it
from sixty to two hundred pounds avoirdu
pois, and the timo of nn&urauce it propor
tioned, according to (he judgment nf the
magistrate, tn the magnitude of tbo nffonco.
A criminal baa boon known to endure a
heavy cangue for half a year, passing his
nighlt lo tbo dungeons ot Ling-hat, and,
when day appears, led by a chain to the
most frequonled of the city gates. The
keeper, armed with a thick bamboo, or

all that could be said agHtnst it is, that in

Ever since the lake Countrv has been

you have been blessed with these benefi

The early and just policy of the Govern

was departed Irom, more than twenty
years ago ; since which time, decav and

mouth of almost every river and creek

Why, sir, at my own city of Cleveland,
the harbor improvements have been un
dermining and crumbling fur years, while
my predecessor begged of your Standing
Committees io vain, a pittance to arrest
the ruin. In the eastern part of my dis
trict, the best natural harbor on the south
side of llit) lakes has been utterly ruined.
and ilB river completely and absolutely
dammed up, so that while its waters tricle
and leak through the remains of tho piers.
into the lake, the Grand River may, with
out profanity, be said to be lhe damdest
river in the United Slates. It is true that.
even under these embarrassments, the
commerce of these lakes rivals, and sur
passes in value, the foreign commerce of
tbe cation, nol because it bas been stim
ulated and fostered by a wise national
care, but in spi;e of a mean ungenerous
neglect, and solely through the indom
itable energy and courage of our people.
Is it not time, Mr. Chairman, that a
new policy towards us should be entered
upon ? And do we not show abundant
reason why this grave question ol Lake
coast dulence aliould be committed in part
to the keeping ol those directly interested
in it ? And we will accept the adoption
of this proposition as en earnest on the
part of the house of Representatives that
our interests shall be placed ou the corn

There are Iwo ways of deimi this; first, a

Such notes would be tne safest currency

Formidable Expedition down the
Mississippi.
Vast nuncbers of troops and munitions
of war, gun boats and iloming batteries,
aru assembled ot Cairo, for the intended
expedition down the Mississippi.
The gunboats, filteen in number, are
most formidable looking instruments ol
war. The seven thai have been built
under contract by Capt. Eads look as if
they could safely venture upon a lilt or a
Dai, wiiu iioinns iamous steam ram,
The bows and bow bulwarks consist of
about three feel of oak timber, bolted to
gether and sheathed with the best quality
of wrought iron plate 2 inches thick.
The aides have the same sheathing, with
less bulk ol timber. Each boat is pierced
for thirteen guns, four on each side, three
iu the stern, and two at the bows. The
bow guns are til-pounder rilled cannon ;
the others are 8-inch columbiads. The
sides of the boats both above and below
tbe knee, incline at an angle of 45 deg.,
and nothing but a plunging shot from a
high blurt could strike the surface at right
angles. The boilers and machinery are
ao situated as lo be perleclly protected,
and may be considered quite out ol danger.
Tbe iron platicg has been severely tested
by shots Irom rifled cannon at different
distances, and has shown itself lo be ut
terly impervious to any shots that have
been sent against it, even at a tange of
300 yards.
Take them altogether, Ibe bor.ts are
about as formidable looking instruments
of destruction as ever navigated American
waters, and if such a wise combination of
oak, iron and saltpeter, will not bring the
persimmons, we will call them sour, and
let Commodore Hollies pull thera dovio
and eai ihem al his leisure. These fifteen
gunboats, with their 200 columbiads and
rilled cannon, are but a fraction of tbe
warlike fleet destined lo swartu down the
Mississippi. There are thirty-eght Coating
batteries of a 64 columbiad each, and
tw enty-eight river steamboats.

is srpposed, will be under tbe command!

How Wordsworth Looked, Commonly.
In a now English novel, called "A Family
History," there is a description of Words
wortb and bis daughter, which is worth
copying :
"Ho carao in, a tall, gaunt man. wearlne
a hugo pair of blue spectacles, witb side
goggles to them. He looked rough aud
weather-beaten, more, I thought, in out
ward appearance, like a shrewd nld dale
farmer than a great poet. 'Take off those
nasty things, paps, said Dora, going up to
him, and trying lo tako off hit spectacles;
who can see what you're like in them ?
Ho laughed, . and complied. Altogether,
evon when lhe goggles were removed, bia
appearance disappointed me. I saw nothing
in bis looks that distinguished bim from
other men at a great geniut. I could not
havo picked him out at the poet, as I onco
picked out Alfred Tennyson at a ball from
among some hundred other persons, long
before any print of him had ever been pub
lished. Wordsworth's features were heavy,
large, and coarse; bis light gray eyes had
no fire in them ; bis note was straight,
broad, and massy ; his mouth wide, and
rather soosual ; I thought it betokened
irritability. Only the calm, high forehead
indicated the lofty mind thai had entranced
thousands. I saw tbat Dora was extremely
liko him. only the linos that were harsh in
him were in her softened to benoty, and
that she had toft, expreativa, and beautiful
eyes. When I had bad a gnod look at him,
Mrs. Wordtworth taid, 'There, my dear,
now you have toon bim as ba really is. You
shall sen what a figure be makes of himself;
you would hardly take him foi a poet in his
walking costume.' "More likely tor a high
wayman,' suggested one of the friends who
bad retored witb him. 'Yet,' echoed an
other, 'that slick is enough to frighten any
body. Oh, ay,' laid he. 'I forgot that. I
must show Mm Neville my valkingtaff.'
He went out, and returned with a thick
knotted stick, which be shored me, tolling
me 'it was invaluablo iu climbing ibo moon
tains.' I tbink he said he had traveled
twice in Rcoiiand. His daughter smiled.
and laid, 'Yes, papa 1 and aa we wont along.
the people on the borders laughed at the
'strange man.' He explained to me, who
sr.t at his right hand, 'Yos, Miss Neville,
they did langb at me; we traveled in at
