Correspondence of the Belmont Chronicle.
CHARLESTON, Va., Dec. 7, 1861.
Ir.AK C'HBONfcLi: The excellent bsnd
of the 7lh Ohio Regiment has just been dis
coursing some ueiighltul airs u.iUcr our
window, and somehow the memories evolved
hy the munic were'tif borne, and said 1 to
my companion I will writeto the CiiiutNK'l.c,
for souie few of iu readers may be interested
in what we cuu tell them of this place, and
our army in this valley.
1'aid a flying visit to Gantry ftridge,
few days ago, but with the exception of a
very large increase in the quuutity of mud,
and the movement therefrom of troops.
everything is much as it was at the time of
our Iftft visit. The trip served to remind
me, however, of the fact that I was led into
innking a fulae prophecy, iu my letter fron
Gnuley.in reference to the capture of Floyd's
army. 1 cnn only apologize by saying that
I thought he would be takenand officers
of the army hereabouts say that he might
and should have been, if movements in that
direction hud been prompt. Hut 1 presume
the facts will transpire beloro a Court Mar
tial soon to bo convened.
Although transportation for Government
stores by land is needed but for five miles
from tho lunding to Oauley Bridge, yet the
rosd tor that short distance is most villani
ously had in fact next to impaible. The
loss of Government property over thnt road
during the psst and succeeding two months
would fur more than pay for an excellent
"macadamized" road, and would nearly
suffice to construct a railroad. ISut nothing
hns been done in that direction, snd the re
sult is appurvnt in the dead horses, broken
and abandoned wagons, and daniagod and
Inst stores which line the roadside.
Since my foruier visit to this valley Gun.
Hoscrrans' has left his quarters at Camp
Tompkins Farm, and gone to Wheeling
Gen. Cox has tuken up his quarters here,
and the different, regiments in this division
have been considerably shifted nhoutj the
1st and 2d Ky., and 7th Ohio being in camp
here, and the 11th Ohio at Point Plaasaut
For the present your correspondent will be
stationed here, where, thanks to the kind
ness of Oen. Cox, we are quartered in the
office of Geo. W. Summers, Esq. Several
regiments are stationed at Fuycttevillo, and
others have taken the places of those moved
from Gauley.
Thero scorns but littlo prospect for any
active operations for the army of the Kan
awha at present, but Gen. Cox is disposed
to improve the time thus afforded them, as
Ooneral Order So. 33, just issued culls the
attention of all tho ofljoere and troops "to
the necessity of using the present oppor
tunity to improve in military knowledge and
dUciiiliun," and he "expects hearty eo-npo-rutiou
from all in securing to desirable a
result." -
Notwithstanding the fact that General
Rosecruns baa left the Kanawha valley, and
Gen. llenhsm is under arrest,, the loyal
citixons of the North need have no fears bnt
all will be well here under the eye of Gen.
Cox. IIo, with his gallant brigade, con
quered tho vulloy, and took possession of
oil the territory we now bold hore, and ha is
able to keop it, and will keep it.
Tbo town of Charleston has in itself noth
ing remarkable, unless it be an excess of
"niggors" and mud the latter of uniform
depth and oonsiitoncy all over town, but the
former with all those interesting shades of
color so pcouhar to slave breeding neighbor
hoods.' In- the social oirolos "seoesh" reigns
supremo, particularly among thegontlersex,
and hitter maledictions are hurlod at the
Uuiouists, in a quiet way, whenever an op
portunity offers. They huvc quit looking
for Wis to return, though I am told that
for long time after the arrival of our troops,
thu diauiuhis at saeessia kapt sumptuous
Toasts in VJr housain anticipation of the
advent af the rebel army. Poor fools, the
child is not yet born which will witness the
triumphant entry of a rebel army into this
town, or even Into the valley, and a feast,
even though of army crackers and red
herring, (not very iashionubl article) will
have tuoulderod long before the "unroturn
ing brave (?)" return.
The 7th Ohio Regiment are under march
ing orders to join Gen. Kolley's command
at Grafton, and will leave here as soon as
transportation can be procured, which will
be in a day ot two.
I cannot close this letter without contri
buting my uiito of praise to Gen. Cox, for
the admirable manner in whioh be has acquit
ted himself in his 'campaign in this valley
While he was in command of tbe Depart
ment of the Kanawha he marched up tbe
valley with bis jrallant .''little brigade," aqd
the miserable braggadocio, Wise, fled before
him, nntil the valley from Point Pleasant to
Gauley Bridge was freod from the traitor's
presence. While he has not boon entirely
free from the attacks of jealous rivals, he
has moved in his sphere and transacted his
business so quietly, that malioe is powerless
as against him. I am reminded of Pope's
epitaph on Sir VY m. Truuibull as peculiarly
applicable to Gen. C. :

Off Fort Pickens, Nov. 22, 1861, 8 P. M.
On Wednesday, the 20th, (duy before
yesterday) it beeamo pretty generally well
annwn among u mat t tie Mag olhccr had
made up bis mind to commence thu bombard

Brown was ready, snd as wo knew thut the
Colonel only wailed lor the Flsa's action
we felt pretty certain that the bull would be
opened at once. 1 need not tell you that sal s
hands were up to "concert pitch," and as
eager to commence as you at the .North have
been anxious to have us, find although we
icit sure mat some formidable masked but
teries would disolose themselves, we wore
ready to find out where they were, ulul try

nearly all the work was done which is ne

all three of which could bring their guns to
benr upon eithor Fort Pickens or the ship
ping. . .......
OPENING OF THE ENGAGEMENT.
By sunrise this morning wo were all ready.
Our bouts hsd been hoisted out and moored
alongside, shot and shell got up, and steam
all ready to move in at short notice. The
usual moruinff uraver was offurerl
cliutilain implored a blessing noon the events
oi me uuy; auor wnicn tnu lMag-Jlhccr ad
dressed a fi-w words to the men in his nsual
clear, uuick. cmne-to-thn-noini. n ,,Af
Ho urged upon them "strict nliedinnce to
all ordersj coolness, judgment and precision
in firing. ' The answer was throe hearty
cheers.
About hulf-pust 9 we could see the steam
er coming down to the Navy Yard, little
suspecting that their doom was sealed. In
u very short time they were fast to the dock,
and at just twelve minute of ten we saw a
smuko issue forth from Fort Piokons, and
heard tlw boominir of the nun A
burst forth from our men, and if cvoraship's
uiivnui uumu up iivmy ll rnu ours tnen.
While working our way in, the Richmond
ornno up under our storn. and, as she draws
less waler than we do, tho Commodore or
dered her to go in and open firo a soon as
sue win within range. Nie paved by us,
tisik a position nearer to the laud and open
ed firo. .Meantime, tbo water butterv and
rort .UcHeu wcio doimr their best to (light
en us, by throwing shot that toll about u
mile short. We kept on steully until we
thought that wo wore within range and then
tamo to alienor.
THE ACTION.
Niagara, togother with the guns, bousing
Irom ort Pickens and Hmtoiv Scott, were
nil pwymg into fort McKea and itssnrrouiid
ing b.ttterins. We avcrmred one shell i-vm v
ton minutes, and as tho Richmond had morn
guns, though smaller, and mnio than our
number of guns were being served from
sunta koso, there was about twonhulls each
minute, being fin d at this point.
Aliout one o clock a fi
froin a masked battery whioh disclosed itsolf
in ins wooas along tno shore, and about a
milo south of MoRea. They aoemoj to
nave a particular spite against us, by the
pertinacity with which they fifed at us j but
finding that they could not reach us, thev
turned their attentinn to tho Richmond,
which was nearor in shdre. Many of their
snot came very close to the latter, and bad
moy mien wou-uirecteu would have done a
great deal of damage. Only one took effect.
however, and I regrot to record that this
killed one man and wounded seven. The
man killed was captain of tho gun, and was
in mo on or losing aim when struck. The
wounded were hut slivlulv hurt
About throo o'clock, ono or two shot
passect over us and dropped into the water,
and by tho note which they san; as they
passed, we know that they had turned some
heavier metal upon ns. Two or three of
our guna were direotod to the spot whenoe
the smoke was seen to issue, and if they
treated ua lo musio, we returned the compli
ment with interest They succeeded in p'-int-ing
two shots in our sides; making rather ugly
?, uMooiuiiif iiungsin one ol the
lieutenant a rooms. By aix o'clock We must
have dtsmrmmed the gun, Tor ut that time
MoRea ceased firing altogether, and for one
pour anu a nau we tumbled shell after shell
inside of her walls without snv laanniiM
After we bad become well engaged in the
fight we hardlv thought of or had time to
look at ort Pickens. Onee in a while I
wouiuoasia glance that way, and 1 could
see that the semi-oil ole of batteries around
br were keeping up a constant explosion of
shell over her loyal walls; while from ont
her aides there cams a stanriv umm r
white smoke, and I could see that the shots
took good effect. Wt had already made
two good holes in Fort MoRea, and' Pickens
had kuookod a hole that a horso and cart
might enter in.
A despatch has lust anm fVnm Pninnl
Brown, in whioh he says "he has only one
killed and two wounded," and that he "has
not yet fairly oommoneed." Tha AW !
from the iort disabled the steamer "Time."
Colonel Brown thinks that Fort MoRea is
effectually silenced.
THE SECOND DAY OF THE FIGHT.
Saturday. Not. 23 7:30 P. M A. T
eonunenoa to write to night, the whorsby
i illuminated by the burning of'tho twn
of Warrington and the Navy Yard. The
lormer nas oumea since 3 J . M., but the
latter haa lust taken fire. The aiirht la ,.!

wa are too ursa to iook at It,
The forte and
firing. Fort
batteries have just ceased
'
Pickens must have fired over 1,000 shot and
shell to-day.
At 9: so signals were made to Fort Pickens,
and at 10 we weighed anchor and stoamed
in neany to our position. l ha Richmond
did not go in at all, as tha flag officer did
not think (her shot took sufficient effect to
pay for being badly cut up. As soon as we
approsohed, the new battery in tbe wood
aisciosea risen, and although it burst shell
nonr Us, it could not do us much harm. The
Other latfArv in tlia amrtfl tin rvinaiata
twu,picr-4 Fort Pickens opened fire a little
afW in.t We same to anchor at 10.40, and
Broil the flrst gnn at 10.45. . At this time
all tho i batteries were hard at work. There
were between forty and fifty guns playing
into Fort Pickens. As we expected, masked
batteries had disoloscd themselves all along
the beach.
THE REBEL FORTIFICATIONS.
During Saturday and Sunday nights we
could sec the camp fires of two or three par
ties on shore, who are doubtless engaged in
erecting batteries lor our reception, but I
do not think it is the Commodore's inten
tion to engage them. They have strewed
their fortifications all along tbe beach, and
contain only one or two guns in each, and
at the samo time they are protected by the
woods. To silence such fellows, it is neces
sary to have a ship for each one. and even
then I doubt if it could bo accomplished.
It ivipiims a landing party, and a force suf
ficient to take possession of the whole place.
THE RESULT.
T question wbeth ir Col. Brown will at
tempt to do much more. Hr.hu rffectrj hi
purjmm- that of destroying the winter
quarters if the- rebels, and although thy
sitneeeilejai pitting out the firo in life
Navy Buisi, lie has shown thorn that, it will
bea very unsafe operation to commence work
there again, a he cm and will sot fire to it
if they make the attempt.
A sad accident happened at Fort Pickens
this morning. As some of tlm men weio
removing tho fuses irnd eniptyinir the pow
der from the shells that fell inside the fort
and did not explode, a spark of firo from
the chisel used in removing the fuse, caused
one of tho shells to explode, killing five
men and wounding two.

Lieut John P. Wnril.n nP tim tfnWoJ
States Navy, the first prisoner taken by the
rebels al ter the outbreak of the war, is now
in this city, at the Branch Naval Recruiting
Office, No. 85 South street. Limit. W.
den is a resident of Duchess County, in this
oraie, anu nas served as vears in the JNavv.
On the 7th of April lust he was sent front
yv asnington as tiesrerot dispatches to Cspt.
Adams, of the Sabine, in command of the
fleet at Fort Pickens. The fleet bod pre
viously been sent to Fort Pickens, with two
companies of artillery, for the purpose of
rc-eiiroroing tne iort when so ordered, and
the dispatches carried hy Mr. Worden con
veyed orders to that effcot. Lieut. Worden
arrived at Pensacola by way of Richmond
and Montgomery on the 11th, hsvinir com
muted the dispatches to memory, and torn
thom up for fear of arrest and search, owing
to the excited state ol tlm country. At
Peusucola he obtained an interview with
Gen. Bruin, the rebel cniiniinnilnr. nml nV.
tainod a pass to visit Capt. Adams, stating
in repiy to nn interrogatoiy that lie had n
verbal communication from Secretary Cam
eron to the cautsin. Owinir to a pnln wliich
wus blowing at the lime, Lieut. Worden did
not visit. Cutit. Adams until the following
i'.ii.v. when he delivered his orders and re
ceived a written reply in return, acknowledg
ing the receipt of the dispatches, ami at.
tin that they should he executed, together
wiwromer verosi intormutinn tor the Gov
eimnient. The fort was ro-cnfnrced by Capt.
Vogdes that uighu Lieut. Worden took
the cars sf 8 p.m. nn the 12th on his return.
and on the movuiuir of the 1:1th. whn with.
in annul rive miles ot Montgomery, five offi
ce i inn reoni unuy came in and arrested
hii taking hiiu to the office of the Adju
tant (ioimrnl nt Montgomery. Hubseqnent
ly he learned thnt Bmgg hsd collected a force
of 1,000 men to attack Fort Pickens, hud
muda all arrangements to ondeavor to seize
tho fort the vory night that it was re-enforced,
and thut in order to cover hi blun
der In-permitting Worden to go out to Cunt
Adams, had charged him with violating his
word of honor. Thischareo the Lieutenant
most positivoly denies. Bragg also alleged
thut an arrangement had been made between
him and Cupt. Adams, that no attempt to
re enfoioe or tnke the fort should be made
without previous notice to the other party
n ino-t unlikely story. Although tho ex
eituiiient against Lieut. Worden was intense,
he says he was well treated during his im
prisonment, and Capt Ingrahxni and other
officers whom ho had known in the service,
visited hiiu in prison, and endeavored,
though vainly, to effect his release on pamle.
He was allowed access to newspapers, and
statos that up to the capture of Port Royal,
the rebels were confident and arrogant, 'but
when that fell, the fournuls dennim,,! th,.
Reb. 1 Government fur not making a better
uciuuao, uecianng mere was no satety to the
cities on the coast, and that no dependence
whutever could he placed upon the fortifica
tions. A tone of duspair seemed to prevail,
aisL the opl6 were loud iu their denuncia
tion ni' a ajnynrnuiett whtuH gave them no
security, nor intelligence of the actual con
dition of afiairs and the results of operations.
Oil the 13th of November he wa informed
thut be had been released on parnlo, io go to
Richmond to curry nut a proposition fur an
exchange. Liout. Worden left Montgomery
on tho 14th, having given his pamle not to
divulge anything which he might lonin
while in transit to the disiulviintnge of the

provision from Mies Belle Quiley, ot
Louisville, the undorsined wore appointed
to express to her the gratitude of those par
taking of her bounty their wurm apprecia
tion of the kindness of one of Kentucky's
fairest daughters, and this pleasant evidence
of her remembrances of those who, from
Ohio, are on Kentucky soil in defenco of
Kentucky and our national riphts. The
Committee will only add that they oan bul
inadequately express their thanks for this
unlooked-for token of regard from the fair

in remembrance by the otficera ot the lflth,
associated as it is with the many evidences
of Knntucky hospitality of which they have
