THE INTERNATIONAL MORALITY" BOMB
EXPLODED BY ROOSEVELT
That portion of President Ropse
velt's message referring to "Interna
tional Morality," which aroused such
a Btorm of indignation among Pacific
coast members of congress yesterday,
contains a bitter arraignment of Cali
fornia for her treatment of the Jap
anese In her pubHc schools,
It Is the longest subhead In the
message and In it the president enters
Into detail with questions of Interna
tional conduct. It is as fallows:
It Is a mistake, and It betrays a
spirit of foolish cynicism, to main
tain that all International govern
mental action Is, and must ever be,
based upon mere selfishness, and that
to advance ethical reasons for such
action is always a sign of hypocrisy.
This is no more necessarily true of
the action of governments than of
the action of individuals. It Is a sure
slue of a base nature always to ascribe
base motives for the nctlonB of others.
Unquestionably no nation can af
ford to disregard proper considera
tions of self-interest, any more than
a private Individual can so do. But
It Is equally true that the average pri
vate individual In any really decent
community does many actions with
reference to other men In which he
is guided, not by self-interest, but by
public spirit, by regard for the rights
of others, by a disinterested purpose
to do good to others, and to rnlRe the
tone of the community as a whole.
Similarly, a really great nation
must often oct, and as a matter of
fact often does act. toward other na
tions In a spirit not In the least of
mere self-interest, but paying heed
chiefly to ethical reasons; and os the
centuries go by this disinterestedness
In International action, this tendency
of the Individuals comprising a na
tion to require that nation, to act with
Justice toward Its neighbors, steadily
grows and strengthens. It Is neither
wise nor right for a nation to disre
gard Its own needs, and It Is foolish
and mny be wicked to think that
other nations will disregard theirs.
Put it Is wicked for a nation only
to regard Its own Interest, and foolish
to believe that such Is the sole motive
that actuates any other nation. It
should be our steady aim to raise the
ethical standard of national action
Just as we strive to raise the ethical
standard of Individual action.
Must Give. Fair Treatment.
Not only must we treat all notions
fairly, but we must treat with Justice
and good will all Immigrants who
come here under the law. Whether
they are Catholic or rrotestont, Jew
Or Oentllc; whether they come from
England or Oermnny. nussla, Japan
or Italy, matters nothing. All we
hnve a right to intention In the man's
conduct. If he Is honest and up
right In his dealings with his neighbor
and with the state, then ho Is entitled
to respect nnd good treatment.
Especially do we need to remember
our duty M the strang. r within our
gates. It Is the sure mark of a low
civilization, a low morality, to abuse
or dlserlmlnntn against or In any way
humiliate such stranger who has
come here lawfully and who Is con
ducting hltm-clf properly. To remem
ber this Is Incumbent on every Amer
ican citizen, anil It Is of course pe
culiarly Incumbent on every govern
ment official, whether of the nation
or of the several states.
Hostility to Japan.
I am prompted to suy this by the
attitude of hostility here nnd there
nssumed toward the Japanese In this
country. This hostility x sporndlc
nnd Is limited to a very few places.
Nevertheless, It Is most dls-redltablo
to us as a people, and it may be

Mrs. Sarah J. Wlndrom of Chicago,
cousin of Zachnry Taylor, twelfth
president of the United States, and
grandnlece of Alexander Hamilton,
who signed the Declaration of Inde
pendence, says: ,
"Vlnol is a godsend to old people.
I am 76 yearn old, but have a hearty
appetite, sleep soundly, and fell act
ive and well today, thanks to Vlnol.
When I waa young cod liver oil was
dispensed in a greasy, unpalatable
form, and it fairly gaged me to get It
down. Vlnol Is entirely different,
very palatable and nourishing to im
poverished blood. It la the finest
tonic and strength creator I ever used
In my life." (
A member of the Pendleton Drug
company says: "This Is because Vlnol
contains In a highly eoncentrated
form all the medleWl and body
building elements of cod liver oil, ta
ken directly from fresh cods' livers,
with all the useless oil eliminated and
tonic Iron added.
"There are hundreds of old people
In Fall River who need just such a
strength maker and tissue builder as
Vlnol, and we can only ask every
such person to try Vlnol on our offer
to return money If not benefited."

fraught with the gravest consequences
to the nation.
The friendship between the United
Stutes and Japan has been continuous
since the time, over half a century
ago, when Commodore Perry, by his
expedition to Japan, first opened the
Islands to western civilization. ' Since
then the growth of Japan has been
literally astounding. There Is not
only nothing to parallel It, but noth
ing to approach It In the history of
civilized mankind. Japan has a
glorious and ancient past. Her civ
ilization Is older than that of the na
tions of northern Europe the na
tions from whom the people of the
United States have chiefly sprung.
Juan's Development.
But BO years ago Japan's develop
ment was still that of the middle
ages. During that BO years the prog
ress of the country In every walk in
life has been a marvel to mankind,
and she now stands as one of the
greatest civilized nations; great In the
arts of war and in the arts of peace;
great In military. In Industrial, In ar
tistic development and achievement.
Japanese soldiers and sailors have
shown themselves equal in combat to
any of whom history makes note. She
has produced great generals and
mighty admirals; her fighting men,
afloat and ashore, show all the heroic
courage, the unquestioning, unfalter
ing loyalty, the splendid indifference
to hardship and death, which marked
the Loyal Itonlns; nnd they show also
that they possess the highest Ideal of
patriotism. Japanese artists of every
kind see their products eagerly
sought for In all lands.
The Industrial and commercial de
velopment of Japan has been phe
nomenal; greater than that of any
country during the same period. At
the same time the advance in science
and philosophy Is no less marked. The
admirable management of the Jap
anese Red Cross during the late war,
the efficiency and humanity of the
Japanese officials, nurses and doctors,
won the rescctful admiration of all
acquainted with the facts. ' Through
the Red Cross the Japanese people
sent over $100,000 to the sufferers of
San Francisco, nnd the gift was ac
cepted with gratitude by our people.
The courtesy of the Japanese, na
tionally and Individually, has become
proverbial.
To no other country has there been
such an Increasing number of visitors
from this' land ns to Japan. In re
turn, Japanese have come here In
great numbers. They are welcome,
socially and Intellectually, In all our
colleges and Institutions of higher
learning, In all our professional and
social bodies.
The Japanese have won in a single
generation the right to stand abreast
of jUie foremost and enlightened peo
ples of Europe and America; they
have won on their own merits and by
their own exertions the right to treat
ment on a basis of full and frank
equality. The overwhelming mass of
our people cherish a lively regard
and respect for the people of Japan.
nnd In almost every quarter of the
union the stranger from Japan Is
treated as he deserves; that Is, he is
treated as the stranger from any part
of" civilized Europe Is and deserves to
be treated.
But here and there a most un
worthy feeling has manifested Itself
toward the Japanese the feeling
that has been shown In shutting them
out fn.m the common schools in Snn
Frnnct i m l In muttering against
them in o.h- ur (wo other places, be
cause of their efficiency as workers.
F.ntitlcd to an Fdiicatlon.
To shut them out from the public
sch'"ln is n wicked absurdity, when
there are no flrst-rlnss colleges In
the land. Including the universities
and colleges of California, which do
not gladly welcome Japanese students
and on which Japanese students do
not reflect credit.
We have ns much to learn from
Japan ns Japan has to learn from
us; nnd no nation Is fit to teach un
less It is willing to learn. Through
out Japan Americans nre well treated
and any failure on the part of Amer
icans nt home to treat the Japanese
with a like courtesy and consideration
Is by Just so much a confession of In
feriority In our civilization.
Our nntlon fronts on the Pacific,
Just as it fronts on the Atlantic. We
hope to piny a constantly growing
part In the great ocean of the orient.
We wish, as we ought to wish, for a
great commercial development In
our dealings with Asln; and it is out
of the question that we should per
manently have such development un
less we freely and gladly extend to
other nations the same measure of
Justice and good treatment which we
expect to receive In return. It Is only
a very small body of our citizens that
act badly. Where the federal gov
ernment has power It will deal sum
marily with any such. Where the
several states have power I earnestly
ask that they also deal wisely and
promptly with such conduct, or else
this small body of wrongdoers may
bring shame upon the great mass of
their Innocent and right-thinking fel
lows that Is, upon our nation ns a
whole.
International Good Manners.
Good manners should be an Inter
national no less than an Individual at-1
tribute, I ask fair treatment for the
Japanese as I would ask fair treat
ment for Germans or Englishmen,
Frenchmen, Russians, or Italians. I
ask It as due to humanity and civili
zation. I ask It as due to ourselves
because we must act uprightly toward
all men,
I recommend to the congress that
an act be past specifically providing
for the naturalization of Japanese
who come here Intending to become
Am'orioan oltlzens. One of the great
embarrassments attending the per
formance of our International obliga
tions Is, the fact that the statutes of
the United States are entirely Inade
quate. They fall to give to the na
tional government sufficiently ample
power, through United States courts
and by the use of the army and navy,
to protect aliens In the rights secured
to them under solemn treaties which
are the law of the land.
I therefore earnestly recommend
that the criminal and civil statutes of
the United States be so amended and
added to as to enable the president,
acting for the United States govern
ment, which is responsible In our In
ternational relations, to enforce the
rights of aliens under treaties.
Japan Will Ro Treated Right.
Even as the law now Is something
can be done by the federal govern
ment toward this end, and In the
matter now before mo affecting the
Japanese, everything that Is in my
power to do will be done, and all of
the forces, military and civil, of the
United States which I may lawfully
employ will be so employed.
There should, however, be no part
icle of doubt as to the power of the
national government completely to
perform and enforce Its own obliga
tions to other nations. The mob of a
single city may at any time perform
acts of lawless violence against some
class of foreigners which would
plunge us into war.
That city by itself would be power
less to make defense against the for
eign power thus assaulted, and if In
dependent of this government it
would never venture to perform or
permit the performance of the acts
complained of. The entire power and
the whole duty to protect the offend
ing city or offending community lies
In the hands of the United States
government.
It Is unthinkable thnt we should
continue a policy under which a given
locality may be allowed to commit a
crime against a friendly nation, and
the United States government limited,
not to preventing the commission of
the crime, but, In the last resort, to
defending the people who have com
mitted It against the consequence of
their own wrongdoing.
DELEGATES TO IIEPPXER.
Walla Walla Commercial Club Ap
K)lnt Four Mini to Join In the Ex
cursion on Ifc"ccmbcr 11.
That Walla Walla will participate
in the Heppner excursion which will
leave this city next Tuesday morning,
is shown by the fact that four promi
nent citizens hnve been appointed to
represent the Garden City and will
come to Pendleton to Join the delega
tion from here. The Walla Walla
Statesman says of the matter:
Walla Walla will be well represent
ed at the annual meeting of the
Umatilla Development league, which
meets nt Heppner December 11, for
a two-days session.
At n meeting of executive board
of the Commercial club, held In Sec
retary Moore's office this afternoon,
the urgent need of Walla Walla being
represented at the Heppner meeting,
was fully discussed resulting In Dr.
N. G. Blalock, Prof. W. D. Lyman,

Strong being named rfis delegates.
President Knser will endeavor to
arrange his affairs so as to attend
the meeting. The committee on ar
rangements include some of the best
known men In Umatilla county, and
the meeting promises excellent re
sults In the exploitation campaign In
augurated by the Commercial club
and civic organizations In the north
west. The Walla Walla delegates will go
to Pendleton on the local morning
train December 11, and Join the Pen
dleton delegation.

ItOlSE IX SERIOUS STRAITS.
Aetmil Suffering nt This Time for
Lack of Fuel.
Women rushing Into coal offlees
with their babies In their arms, shiv
ering with cold nnd with tears in their
eyes begging for coal and offering
every Inducement, even to paying a
double price for It, if allowed only
one sack
This is the condition that has de
veloped within the last few days In
Boise, according to the Boise States
man. The fuel situation Is now be
coming desperate. The cold weather
has brought to light cases of actual
suffering. A car of coal arrives oc
casionally, but It does not last long,
usually being distributed In small
quantities, a sack of 100 pounds here
and there, j
An Idea of the situation I may be
gained from the statement that a re
porter for the Statesman was In one
of the local coal offices less than an
hour yesterday afternoon and during
that time 25 people came Into the of
fice and asked for coal. It was the
same answer there waa none for
them. During all hours of the day
dealers are besieged with requests for
coal, "just a few pounds If nothing
more," and telephone bells In the of
fices are kept ringing nearly all the
time.
Many people dnlly watch for the
arrival of a car of coal and when one
comes they flock around It and de
mand of those In charge that they be
given a supply. Generally their first
request Is for half a ton. When they
find their demands unreasonable they
come down to BOO pounds and when
refused that amount, seem satisfied
to carry awny a sack. While no vio
lence hns been reported, some of the
requests are voiced In unmistakable
terms, showing that a spirit of de
termination prompts the requests.
Not more than 16 cars of coal were
received in Boise last week for the
dealers, but the supply In so many
homes is so short that this did not
last long. Four other cars were re
ceived during the week, one each for
the water company, the gas company.
St. Teressa's academy and Folk block.
The car for the latter was anthra
cite coal from Pennsylvania. One coal
company made one of their cars last
for 150 families, Riving each a small
amount.
The only wood that can be obtained
to relieve the situation is that which
conies from the Barber mill. The de
mand for this is far in excess of the
supply, which is limited by the num
ber of men and teams to haul It, and
dealers have been unable to secure
enough men and teams to keep n sup
ply on hand.
There has been some talk of .clos
ing the public schools and distribut
ing throughout the city the supply nt
the schools, which is about enough
to keep them running two months.
A man w th a sprained ankle will
use a crutch, rest the ankle and let It
Ret well. A man or womnn with on
overworked stomach can't use n
tiutch. but the stomach must hnve
rest just the same. It can be rested,
too. without starvation. Kodol will
do It. Kodol performs the digestive
work of the tired stomach and cor
rects the digestive apparatus. Kodol
fully conforms to the provisions of the
National Fure Food and Drug Laws.

Sale of Pentateuch Manuscript.
London, Dec. B. The government
has purchased for the British Museum
a manuscript of the Pentnteuch, writ
ten about the year 1000 B. C. It was
purchased from four Samaritans, who
ore the last of the race and very poor.
The manuscript Is one of the two
which were especially venerated at
Jerusalem. The second manuscript
is a transcript of the priceless master
roll and Is enclosed In a metal case
Inlaid with silver and gold which Is
900 years old. It Is ornamented with
two brass objects similarly to those
traditionally decorating the Arc of
the Covenant. Twenty-five thousand
dollars has been given the Samaritans
for the relic.
E. C. PeWItt A Co., of Chicago, at
whose laboratory Kodol Is prepared,
assure us that this remarkable dlges
tant and corrective for the stomach
conforms folly to all provisions of the
National Pure Food and Drug Law.
The Kodol laboratory is a very large
one, but If all the sufferers from In
digestion nnd stomach troubles could
know the virtues of Kodol It would
be Impossible for the manufacturers
to keep up with tho demand. Kodol
Is sold her by Tallman & Co.
