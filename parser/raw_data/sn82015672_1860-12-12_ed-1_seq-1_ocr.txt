COSTUUESSIONAL.
Washington, Dec. 12. House. Mr.
Cobb, of Alabama, did not rise to make a
speech but to express an anxious desire that
the select committee should commence their
business and present their deliberations in
some tangible form. His hope was, how
ever, faint as to any useful result. If any
thing was to be done to save his State, it
must be done at once. The election for del
egates to a State Convention lakes place on
the 29th inst., and the Convention meets on
the 7th of January. What mean those
crowded galleries? His r.nswer was, the
excitement which prevailed in the public
mind, not only here but th ugbout the
country. All are looking to Congress to do
something. He hoped the House would
stop this debate and do something, if possi
ble, to produce harmony among the peopie.
There was a pure beam of light from Bos
ton, which may ultimately have a good ef
fect on the public mind. Let the North
show a returning sense of justice, and the
questions which now agitate ali will be ta
ken into the hands of the people for proper
adjustment. He trusttd the committee vviil
do something to harmonize the distracted
public mind. He knew Alabama would not
remain in the Confederacy looser than the
15th of January unless something was speed
ily done. 'le was not a secessionist. He
desired peace predicated on the principles of
the Constitution. If you can give us that,
you can help us to remain in the Union as
long as the sun shall shine, nnd my prayer
shall be sent forth tor the perpetuity of this
Government.
Mr. Davis of Mississippi briefly gave the
reasons why he should serve ou the commit
tee. He might be cer.sured, but in acting
when his conscience approved her defied the
opinion of the world. He stoo 1 not here as
the representative of his own preference?
but for the interests of his constituents.
He regretted that the resolution under
which the Committee was raised, ctiaie from
a distinguished Son of Virginia. He hud
entertained the opinion that the Southerners
should withdraw and leave the Republicans
to submit a report lor consideration ; bat
this could not be done.
The Constitution was sutlidei.t for the
protection of Southern rights if txecutod in
the letter and spirit. If our govern merit
rests for its construction on public opinion
he would have no hope from that source, nor
that it could be perserved by coujpro.'iiise or
the sword. The Republicans have destroy
ed the only baud which can bind the. Union.
The subject matter referred to tiiis commit
tee did not belong to this House. It grew
out of principles and systems iu Northern
States directly at war with the safety and
material interests of the South. If there
was any action at all, it should origin ate
with the States.
Tho House voted and refused to exju;e
Mr. Hawkins; 55 against 101.
Mr. Hawkins said lest silence be construed
into a consent to serve ou the committee,
he wished to say with all deference and
good feeling for those who voted against his
request, he will not serve.
Mr. Boyce asked to be excused from ser
vice on the Committee.
Mr. Smith, of Virginia, objected. -
Mr. Burnett thought the refusal to excu.-e
gentlemen was extraordinary after they had
made up their minds upon mature reflection
and in justice to their respective States that
they cannot serre. He was satisfied the com
mittee 4iti not exprt'Ss the sentiments of the
various sections. The Representatives of
South Carolina will remain here only a f?w
days longer. Why, then, refuse to ex
cuse Mr. Boyce? Is force the mode and
manner of instituting measures with a view
to restore peace and good feeling in the
country ?
Mr. Smith of Virginia replied. Hj would
not use force. He was one of those who re
fused to excuse Mr. Hawkins,! and after the
lecture of Mr. Burnett, he felt it to be his
duly to vindicate his vote. Present atFairs
are big with the fate of the Republic, and
discussion of the question was not likely to
do any good. He, however, expressed his
surprise and mortification that the Republi
can side of the House had refused to partic
ipate in the discussion.
Mr. Curtis wished to say that his party
had not refused to discuss, lie would do
so at the proper time, lie wanted the com
mittee of which he was a member to have a
fair hearing.
Mr. Smith said, resuming.
He expected the opportunity would have
been presented of exhibiting the different
views of the members as a means of influ
encing and acting on the committee, lie
was anxious to see every State participate
in the deliberations of the committee, and
hence he could not excuse Mr. Il.wvkin?, be
cause if this be done, Florida would be un
represented. Mr. Burnett, in explanation, said his
Government is not to be saved by mere eu
logies on Union, but by speedy action.
Mr. Smith resumed. No body expected
to see force used to compel Mr. Hawkins to
serve, or if he desist to visit hira with pun
ishment other than that of mere opinion.
The gent, is resolved not to serve on the
Committee. Let him refuse, but nut make
the request to be excused with a private
determination not to perform his duty.
The House refused to excuse Mr. Boyce
by a tie vote.
Mr. Smith of Vigiuia having been inform
ed that Mr. Hawkins supposed he had made
some insinuations to his prejudice, disclaim
ed any such intentions, and spoke of the
uprightness and integrity of the gent, from
Florida.
Mr. Hawkins was understood to be satis
fied with the explanation.
Mr. Morrill asked to be excused from
serving ou the committee, because of other 1
duties which fully employed his time, and j
after debate Mr. Corwin oll'ered a resolution
which was adopted, authorizing the select
committee to employ a clerk at $-1 per day,
and that the committee have leave to sit
during the sessions of the House, until they
shall report or be otherwise discharged.
Mr. Sherman from the committee on ways
and means reported the ' diplomatic and
consular appropriation bills and a bill mak
ing appropriations for the support of the
Indian Department.
Mr. Sherman introduced a resolution
which was adopted instructing the commit
tee ou Indian Affairs to inquire and report
whether any Superintendents of Indian
Affairs or Indian Agents can be dispensed
with without public detriment.
Mr. Sherman presented the petition of
Tuaddeu3 Hyatt asking for relief for the
people of Kansas.
Mr. Garnett objected to the petition, but
the House referred it to the committee on
territories.
Mr. Morris of Illinois made an ineffectual
attempt to introduce hi3 union-loving de
claratory resolution.
The question on excusing Mr. Morrill wa3
taken and negatived.
Mr. Hiudman . wished to propose an
amendment to the Constitution. He was
opposed to legislation for expediency.
Mr. Morris of Illinois objected.
Mr. Branch offered a resolution, which
was adoi'ted, that the States be called to
morrow for bills nhJ resolutions, and that
those relative to the state of the Union be
referred to Ihe select committee.
At 2.J o'clock the House adjourned.
I Si.n ate. The House bill to provide for
j the payment of outstanding treasury
notes, authorizing a loan, Sit'., was
taken up, and after some remarks from Mr.
Rice against, anil Mr. Cameron in favor, on
motion of Mr. Rice it was referred to the
! committee on finance.
i The resolution in relation to that portion
of the President's message in leference to
secession was taken up.
Mr. Hale offered at resolution that the
committee on military affairs te instructed
to inquire whether the expenses of that
branch of the public service cannot be re
duced without d trin e it to public safety, aii
that it they can, they le further instructed
I to report to what extent and what particular
', branch or branches can be dispensed with
or reduced. The resolution was adopted
Mr. Bigler then took tho Moor, having
yielded it eslerday. He said he would go
with the Seuator from Illinois, with men of
every party who will devote themselves to
the great work of rescuing the country from
impend:iig danger. Mr. President, lor weal

i nia a c uiou until. i nut tor me
Union as made bv our fathers.
I am for
the Constitution and the Union.
Mr. Hitler concluded that iu Pennsylvania
ami New Yoik, there were more votes than
in all the States threatening secession. The
Republican party has gained its last vieto-.
Let us rem u'n together.
Mr. I vers -.-m said the, South does not fear
the opeiut'on of personal liberty bills, fugi
tive slave laws, &e. If they were all repeal
ed, we ft ar the mob lav,- most. It Las been
s,;id that, uiiicnduiutits will be made so that
a Slate may be sued for damages to the
amount of the value for slaves refused to be
given up. Such a iaw is worthless. You
can't sue a State if in its sovereign capacity
the c.kci ca:it:ot bo brought to Court. The
vote in the lalo Presidential contest shows
the public sentiment at the North. All the
Douglas nDU-iritervetition, Squatter-sovereignty
party in the North cannot avail
laughter under Black Republicanism.
The border slave States become a burden if
the South is left to herself; tho slave popu-
lation wilt increase in thirty years from ,
1,500,000 to 39,000,000. The "slave popula- j
tiou will preponderate over the whole. If !
the North prevail, stiiversa! emancipation j
will tveutuaily take piace. .- , I
Mr. Pog'f of Qliio said, dr you b.Oj.ieto !
continue the Union from the'extraordiuary'j
speech just heard ? When the people of any
Stale, Territory, or community dp mod de
sire slavery, my n;ht arm should go-, from
the socke before I shall force them to ac
cept it.
Mr. 1 verso n sai l I refer you to my speech
of February -3rd, last year, when I was in
the chair. You did not say yes, then. I
referred to the Burns fugitive slave case.
Mr. Rugb That is the only case.
Mr. Iveisou resd from Ihe Globe to
prove that Mr. Pugh did not adhere now to
what he had stated previously to this ses
sion. Mr. Pugh. Let me read the rest i laugh
ter). I contradict that the fugitive slave
law was trampled under foot.
Mr. Iverson. Twenty years agon report,
was ma le by the order of the Virginia leg
islature proving .100.000 worth of slaves
wore lost annually from its limits bv their
being fugitives.
Mr. Pugl.. I do not believe that all -the.
Slave Stales have hint $ I oo;ooo by their
fugitives.
Mr. Douglas. Like many other laws, the
fugitive slave law is not eutbned in every
State.
Mr. Green. If a nun runs orT'a horse
his loss is a pecuniary consideration only ;
but to steal a nigger, it is something more.
I wish, the strong arm of the' Government
to disi barge its functions, A Government
that won t do it I would spit "upon. I would
sooner have the despotism of Louis Napole
on and the PrJnee of Wales over, me, than
a Government that would nor command r -spect.
:
Mr. Douglas. No law can ho said to be
left unexecuted unless ic has been brought
before a Court of some .Government. i
.Mr. G'-een. I do not uphold the scnti- I
ment of stealing horses or negroes. -1
Mr. Douglas. I speak only as (o the!
non-execution of the laws. j
Mr. Fitch. I know my State for the last I
25 years. There has l-en but one instance
of the rescue li a fugitive.' - .

Mr. Piigh. Is the gent. (Powell) aware
of all the facts ?
Mr. Powell. The Governor of Illinois
was wrong.
Mr. Davis. Alas, it all resulted in crimi
nation and recriujination.
,',. " - " J
Mr. Mason. Our grievances are great. I
We have been humiliated.
Mr. Douglas. Congress shouid apply i
the necessary legislation. A convention of 1
separate States to settle this matter is not J
nccessarv. j
Mr. Mason. We have become satisfied j
thai unless we have evidences that the cou-
stitutiou mil the laws will be upheld by a i
convention of the different States, we are j
not bound to remain iu the Union.
Mr. Collumer. The Slate Legislatures I
should aid in establishinga fraternal feelinir.
Mr. Wigfall. Slaves have been recogniz
ed as property in at least three places in the .
constitution. Our rights have been vio
lated. Mr. Douglas. Because the rights of the I
Southern Slates have been violated, does !
that justify them iu leaving the Union ? j
Mr. Wigfall Does the Senator from Illi
nois, iasteud of answering one question pro
pound another
Mr. Davis cited the bill annulling the
legislation of Kansas.
This caused a general interchange of ex
pressions between Messrs. Davis, Brown,
Wigfall and Douglas. Pending which, on
motion of Mr. Wigfall, at o'clock p. in.,
adjourned.
Arrival of the Eiuopa.
Cape Race, N. F. The Royal mail
steamship, Europa, Capt. Leach, from Liv
erpool on Saturday, the 1st., via Queens
town on the 2nd, was boarded off Cape
Race at 4 o'clock this morning by the news
yacht, and the following summary of her
news obtained.
The Europa will be due at Halifax on
Wednesday night.
The political netvs by the Europa is not of
an important character.
The situation of Italian affairs wa3 un
changed. The garrison of Gaeta had made a sortie
and were repulsed with great loss.
The American money crisis has caused
specie shipments from England, nnd the
Europa has a considerable amount on board.
i.Large shipments were expected to be
made by the Atlantic, to sail on the 5th. -These
movements caused a renewal on
the 30th, of gold withdrawals from the
Bank, which had previously reduced its rate
of discount to 5.J per cent. The brokers'
circular reports sale3 of cotton for the week
of 70,000 bales. The market opened firm
and closed buoyant with a slight advance.
Consols closed on Friday at 3i93g.
The bullion in the Bank of England had
! increased 403,000. The money market
I was very active. Ihe Bank of England
had reduced it3 rate of interest to 5 V

Tueston, N. J., Dec. 11. A convention
to consider the dangers which threaten the
Union, met in this city to-day. A large
number of people were present.
Col. Wm. C. Alexander presided, assisted
by a Vice President from each county in the
State.
A committee on uddress and r-i!-:tious
and address wrs appointed, of tv'iicu Com
modore Stockton was made c , , . ui.in.
After an able and 1i.j--!.! rjieechby Col.
Alexander in favor of Ihe Union, which
thrilled the audience and called forth im
mense applause.
Com. Stockton, forward and Ui.er came
preliminary remarks read the addres.-, which
is a very strong aud able document.
The address declares that the Not til has
committed great wrongs and must retrace
its steps by the repeal of all laws prever.i
ing the execution of the fugitive slave law;
that the citizens of the Southern Sta'e
must be allowed to travel through otio r
States with their property; and that siaves
must be returned upon claim being tin ie
for them. All this the South has a clear right
to. She looks not to indemnity foi the
past, but for protection in the future. The
North is iu the wrong as matters now
stand, aud what has been wrongfully done
must be uudoue. I pon the adoption of the
address objection was made by Mr. O. S.
Halsted, jr., who regarded the wrong about
equal on both sides, lie thought the ad
dress ought simply to declare against any at
tempt to trample down tho authority of the
General Government. Commodore Stock
ton replied eloquently at considerable
length.
The address was then laid upon the table
and the resolution adopted in much confu
sion, but by a large vote.
Mr. James F. Rii3ling, a Republican, at
tempted to speak on the resolution and ad
dross, and was proceeding to argue that there
was no wrong at all ont he part of the North
and that the wrong was all on the part of
the South, when great confusion arose and
the speaker's voice was drowned by hisses
and applaujc.
The chairman came forward and said that
it was evident that the Convention did not
desire to hear the gentleman. He then put
the question on the adoption of the resolu
tion, which was carried. The t.-ddrcss was
then adopted by a large vote. Remarks
were made pending the adoption of the res
olution by Messers. Wm. Halsted, O. P. Hoi
sted, Judge Pearson and other. The two
first named believed iu the main in the doc
trines of the address, but thought they want
ed modification.
i Several Republicans cheered for i.'ee
speech.
I inter the resolutions sundry persons
were appointed a committee to consult with
other States.
Washington, Dec. 11. The Post Office
Committee of the House met this morning
to consider an Overland Mail Bill sub
mitted to them by Mr. Colfax, Chairman.
Alter consultation, they unanimously
adopted the bill, the details of which are as
follows :
j That the Postmaster General advertise
I for proposals for carrying the entire mail
l overland daily between St. Joseph, Missouri,
i and Sacramento, California, bv the Central
Route, from July I, USol, to July 1, 1SC5.
Denver City and Salt Lake City to be sup
plied weekly without extra charge. The
amount not to exceed 5800,000 per annum.
Letters aud papers to be carried through by
the contractors in ten days, and public doc
uments in thirty days. The bill also auth
orizes temporary steamship services at the
rate to be paid to Commodore Vanderbiit,
the present session, subject to discontinu
ance on 90 days notice, and to continue
until otherwise authorized by Congress. In
case the daily Overland Mail contract
is not taken within the sum limited the
bill is to be reported to the House this
week.
The Secretary of the Navy. Mr. Toucey,
was to-day requested by the President to
act 818 Secretary of the Treasury, in addi-
tion to his present duties, until a successor
to Mr. Cobb should be appointed.
Mr. Cobb then formally took leave of the
President, the interview being of a pri
vate and pleasant character.
The depot buildings of the I. C. R. R. ut
Dunieith were destroyed by fire last night.
Loss S8,000. Partially iusured.
Roxih-ry, Mass., Dec. 11. Chas. Wm.
Gaston (Union) was elected Mayor, yester
day, by 200 plurality.
Charleston', Mass., Dec. 11. Horace G.
Hutchins (Union) was elected Mavor, yes
terday, by Tii majority.
Washington, Dec. 11. The Times cor
respondence says Mr. Trescott, the bear-
i er of the President's Message to South Caro
lina, was also charged with the duty of con
sulting the State authorities as to their pur
poses tifttr the ordinance of Secession was
passed. He returned last evening and re-
i ports every thing quiet and no danger of a
collision with the Federal Government. He
says the arrangement 13 perfected, and
things will remain in tlalii quo until af-
i ter commissioners shall have failed to ar-
j range for a peaceable separation.
j Secretary Thompson will soon follow Mr.
j Cobb. He entered his office to-day ; but did
j nothing more than to look over a few letters
! on his table.
I Mr. Cobb has at last resigned; but his
i successsor has not been nominated, although
rumor says difi'erntiy. One report is that
; Mr. Guthrie has been named and another
j that Mr. Holt takes the treasury, and lion. L.
j (.. B. Branch the Post Office Department,
j Still another rumor is that Mr. Schcll goes
j into the Cabinet.
i A messenger from South Carolina ftrriv
I ed to-day bringing tho vote of that State
for President for the ensuing four years.
j He delivered the vote and drew his pay for
! his services.
The Herald's correspondent says :
Mr. Buchanan has tendered the office of
Secretary of the Treasury to Mr. Guthrie
of Kentucky, aud he has accepted. My au
thority is of so high a character that I can
not doubt the report.
The World's correspondent says :
It seems well credited that P. M. General
Holt will be transferred to the Treasury
Department, and Mr. King, now first assist
ant, will become Postmaster General. Eras
tus Corning is also named as the successor
of Mr. Cobb.
Miles, Bonham, and McQueen called
upon the President to-day and had a long
consultation with him with regard to the
secession of South Carolina, and the terms
on which she will go out of the Union.
The business of the Treasury was entire
ly suspended to-day, as tho President did
not commission .Mr. Clayton, Mr. Cobb's as
sistant, to fill the office temporarily as here
tofore. This omission was considered sig
nificant. Reverdy Johnson who has just returned
from California declares himself for Uuioa
at all hazards mid agaiact all opposition.
Baton Rouni:, Dec. lut'u. The Governor
in his Message to the extra session of the
Louisiana LtLrislatu
exhorted

vs the election of
Lincoln shows thai the Northern nr.'nd is
poisoned against the South ; that wise
counsels of our fathers are forgotten, aud the
fraternal remonstrances of tho South are
disregarded. He recommends a Convention
aud says Lousiana ought not to refuse to
meet her sister Slave-holding States in
council, to demand of the North the repeal
of obno.xiouo legislation and guarantees
against future similar measures ; he says
that these quc.-tious should be met before
tbt? inauguration of Liffco'n, because the self
respect and honor of the Slate docs not
comport with her remaining under a Black
Republican President.
A resolution recommends the erection of
a Military Board ami asks an appropriation
of half a million dollars for the purchase of
arms for volunteer companies. The mem

vor pre preparing fir any emergencey.

Washington, Nov. 11, m. The Demo
crats of the North-west have had several
conferences relative to the present condition
of political affairs. They generally take
the position set forth in Messrs. McClernand's
and Vallandiriirhani's speeches yesterday,
viz.: that the Union cannot be dissolved
peaceably; that the North-west will under
no circumstances consent to be cut off from
the Gulf of Mexico nnd the city of New
Orleans ; that the government, whatever
may bo its fault?, is of inestimable value.
The leading idea is a central government
embracing the middle, western and border
slave States, but depending for its consum
mation on future circumstances.
