GRAFTON, W. Va., Dec. Z.?Inns.
much a s tho question of redlatrlctlng
the state by the next legislature Is provoking
considerable discussion at this
time, your correspondent called upon
Hon. Thomas E. Davis, senator-eleot
from this district, at hla olllce, this
evening, and Inquired If ho had given
tho matter any consideration, as yet,
and it so, I would be glad to learn his
vlqws,
Tho senator Is a gentleman who usually
has very decided views upon every
question of public Interest, and he
promptly replied that he had already
given some thought to the subject und6r
consideration.
Not in Favor of Ripping.
""What conclusion have you arrived
at, senator?'* was asked.
"Well," said he, '-while I am for redisricting
the state, at the same time I
do not think it good policy or good polltics
to rip up the state sololy for partisan
advantage, as was done by the
Democratic party In 1891.' I was in the
senate at that time, and I know they
expected, by that gerrjjmander to hold
the stato indefinitely, and they were
consequently dumb-founded when they
awoke on the morning after the election
of 1894,-to find that a Republican legislature
had been elected and a United
States senator lost t/> them. I do not
think wo should follow their example
now, after so bitterly denouncing their
gerrymandering Job from the time the
bill was passed to the present. This
would be Inconsistent, it seems to me,
to say the least.
Each. County Should bo Eepresented.
."I think, like many others," continued
the senator, "that each county should
have a member of the legislature, and
by taking a basis say, of 1,200, this
could be. done with an Increase to the
house of only thirteen members, without
o-ny legislative districts, thus making
the total membership of the house
eighty-four. The senatorial districts
might then be increased also to sixteen,
thus making thirty-two members of the
senate, an increase of only six, which
would be a fair proportlonment to the
houf?e. The total increase to both
branches would then aggregate but
nineteen, and the legislature in its entirely
would be composed of 11C members
in all."
"Senator, would you not consider
that a small assembly for a state that
is growing an rapidly as ours?"
Bodies Must Not Be too Large.
"I think not," replied Mr. Davis, "for
you,must remember that wo have increased
the legislature by only two
members In the senate and seven In the
house since the organization of the
state, and I have grave doubts If too
large a body would be for the best Interests
of the state, any more than too
great a majority would be best for the
party in power. Besides each member
added would cost, the state about $2K0
annually In tho way of per diem, mileage,
&c., &c., and even at my figures
the Increase would cost the state nearly
55,CMl0 additional per ennum. These are
matters to be carefully considered."
"What do you say as to the congres
slonal districts, senator?"
As to Congressional Districts.
"As to the congressional districts,"
he thoughtfully answered, "I do not
think they can be much Improved upon
by any readjustment, and.as our Democratic'friends
arranged tliem as they
are, they certainly cannot complain if
we continue them as at present. Besides,"
said lie, "a change now would
break up old and pleasant associations
In existing districts, and, therefore, If ;
we are to have an additional representative
in Congress, after a reapportionment
has been made by that body, I am
favorably inclined toward the Pennsylvania
plan of having one congri-samanat-large."
"What is your opinion, senator, as to
. the Judicial districts, ghould they be redistricted,
do you think?"
Let Judicial Districts Alone.
"No, -I think they should remain as
SHOULD
REPRESENTED.
they are< also, ais'I do not know of any
judge that is {. specially* overworked In
1^3' district, ami rather than increase ;
the J'umber of districts, I would, If pas-!
sJble, increase the salary of the several
judges, but as this can not be done.1
without a constitutional amendment, I
presume th?y will have to be contented
\ylth their presUUit compensation."
' "Senator, do yuij contemplate pcesentinsr
a bill on the lines indicated in this
Interview?"
v.u, muy ?ruf oniy my inuiviuuai
views at present. I suppose, however,
that tho two houses will appoint a joint
commlttce to formulate ji bill anil present
to both houses for approval or disapproval."
"Jn conclusion! senator," was the last]
question asked, '"what is your opinion.
of the character of the senate?"
"What do X. think of the senate?" |
warmly replied Mr. Davis," I think it
Is an excel/rent body and fairly distributed
as to business men, farmers and
lawyers. I believe this also holds good
with reference to the house, and 1 predict
"very conservative, business session,
as it should be if we expect to retain
the confidence of the people and
continue to control the state."

DYING STATEMENT
Of lilrs. Castle Admitted in Morrison
Murder Case?Prisoner Wept Bitterly.
ELDORADO, Kas., Dec. 5.?Despite
the strenuous resistance of counsel for
the defense, In the trial of Jessie Morrison
(charged with killing Mrs. Olln
Castle, brhle of her former sweetheart)
the alleged dying statement of Mrs.
Castle was admitted to-day as evidence.
The statement, which was introduced
yesterday, charges Miss Morrison with
provoking a quarrel with the bride and
then attacking her. Admission of this
statement'was vigorously combatted by
me defense and, in a closing argument
to-day against it, Attorney Redden declared
it was a concoction of men who
sought to convict an innocent girl. Miss
Morrison, who had maintained remarkable
composure throughout the trial,
burst into tears at this Junctuie and
continued to weep for some time.
FAMOUS LAWYER DEAD.
Thomas Nolan, a Uniquo Figure in
New York Courts, is No More.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.?Thomas Nolan,
assistant corporation counsel, died today.
He was stricken with paralysis a
few weeks ago and for the last week
his condition was regarded as critical.
"Counsellor" Nolan, as he was generally
called, was a unique and Interesting
character, lie was born in the
county of Cork in Ireland, and practiced
his profession there. About twenty-live
years ago he came to this city and had
practiced in the courts here ever since.
He never dropped his thick brogue and
this characteristic, united with a (lamboyant
style of oratory and an i?nsy reference
to classics, soon made him a
well known llgure In the courts. The
report that he was to speak frequently
drew crowds to the court rooms. It
was Impossible to disconcert him, and
his easy familiarity with the Judges was
as amusing ns It was difficult to rebuke.

j Leaving the Red Light Districts in
New York.
i NEW YORK, Dec. 4.?Scores of woj
men. driven from their rooms in the
! district known as the rod light district
left the neighborhood to-day. The excdus
was the result of the move of the

own the tenements In which the women
lived, and who in turn served the
women with dispossess notices. The
unfortunates got out of the city, some
to Brooklyn, others to New Jersey,
while some are said to have gone to
the large eustern citjon.
Simultaneous with this effort to rid
tlu* city of vice in this form was the
opening to-day of an Industrial home
for the fallen women under the direction
of the Salvation army. This Is the
second one the army has opened.

"WASHINGTON. D. C? Dee. 5.?Consul
Tlooscvelt, at Brussels, reports to thp
utute department that a station has
been established at La Panne, Belgium,
for the exchange of wireless telegraphic
messages between Belgium and England.

feet high, was erected there. The Dover
mall boat, Princess Clementine, was
lltted up with temporary apparatus for

inast was uftlxed to the forema:-.t
of this vessel, Increasing Its original
height about GO feet.

up on the steamer for the instruments,
and from that room the cable Is carried
to the top of the extended mast.

It is confidently expected to maintain f
communication between ship und shore t
for nt least thirty miles, which is about *
half way across. With stations at La t
Panne and Dover those on board the
vessel will be able to keep in touch 4
with the land during1 the entire trip [
across. Recent experiments showed .
that replies arrived with the same regularity
and celerity as ordinary telegrams.
When about forty miles from
Ostcnde the captain was a|!e to telegraph
the station master at Ostendo
the probable hour of his arrival. Various
telegrams were sent from the vessel
to Ostende, Brussels, Dover and
London, and the reception" of each mes- /
sage was acknowledged promptly. Subsequently,
the consul adds, a message
was sent from the vessel to the sta- j
tion at Dover court. Essex, a distance \
of nearly twenty miles, including many
miles of cliffs \-ind flea. j
