I ho long pending controversy between
this Government and that of Chili touching
the seizure at Silana, in Feru, bv Chilian
flficers, of a largo amount in treasuro bo
longing to citixunsof the United States, lias
been brought to a close, by the award of his
Majesty the King of the liolgians, to whom
arbitration the question was referred by the
parties. I ho auljiet wtisthnrouuly and
patiently examined by that justly re vcted
magistrate, and although thu sum awarded
to tho claimants may not havo beeu as largo
us they expected, there ia no reason to dis
trust the wisdom ot Ills majesty a decision.
That decision was promptly complied with
by Chili, when Intelligencn in regard to it
reached that country. The joint commis
sion under the act of tho Inst session for
currying into iffVct tho convention with
Feru on tho suhjeot nl claims, has been or

my last Annual Message, I havo received
Representative from tho United Slates ol
Columbia, and havo credited a Minister to
tlmi Republic Incidents occurring in thu
pri giets ol our civil war have lorced upon
my attention tho uncertain statu of tho in
tiTtmtioi al questiun touching the rights ot
oteigueis in tins c unti y and ot United
Stales cit'ions abroad. In regard to some
governments these rights aro al least par
tially denned by treaties In no ntstuiico,
however, is it exptcssiy stipulated that in
thu instance of civil war a foreigner residing
in this oounU T, within the lines of tho in
surgents. Is to be exempted now the rule
which classes htm as a belligerent, In whoso
behalf the Government ol bis country can
not expect any privileges or immunitiei
distinct Irotn lliut character. I regret
say, huwuver, that such claims havo boon
nut torward, and in some tustancua in honall
of foreigners who have lived in the United
States the greater part ol their lives. . Ihere
is reason to behove that many persons born
in lorcgu countries, who have deo.aruu their
iu'.entiona to become citixons, or who havo
been fully naturalized, havo evaded tho mil
nary duty required ol them by denying the
tbe tact, and thereby throwing upon the
Government tne burden of proof. It has
been found d flicult or impracticable to ob
tain this pronl Irom the want nf guides
the proper sources nl information. These
might be supplied by riquirieg tho Clerks
ol Courts, whero declarations of intention
may be made or naturalization t neoted,
tend, periodically, lists of tho names of per
sons naturalized, or declaring their linen
liiio to become citizens, to thu Secretary
the Interior, in whnso department these
names must bo arranged and printed
general inforniaticn. There ia reason
believe that foreigners frequently become
cinnins of the United States tor the
purpose of evading tho duties imposed

in becoming naturalized here, they nt once

and in our mines, as well of iron and coal

thousands of persons dustituto of remuner

Consulates and offering to emigrato lo the
United Stales, if essential but very cheap
assistance can bo afforded thorn. It is easy
to sue that under tho sharp discipline

cordially concur in the recommendation
of ihe Secretary of the Interior, suggest
ing a modification ol the act in favor of
those engaged in ihe military and naval
service ol the United States. I doubt
not that Congress will cheerfully adopt
such measures ns will, wit bout essentially
changing the general features of the sys

their homes in defense of the country in

as to lite propriety ol raibing by appro

The measures provided at your last
session for the removal of certain Indian
tribes have been carried into effect. Sun
dry Uealiub have been negotiated, which
will in due lime be submitted for the con
stitutional action of the Senate. They
contain stipulation.' for extinguishing tho
possessor y rights of Ihe Indians lo Urge
and valuable tracts of land. It is proba
ble thai the effect of these treaties will re.
suit in the establishment ol permanent
friendly relations with such of those tribes
as have been brought into frequent and
bloody collision with our outlying sel
llements nnd emigrants. Sound policy
and our imperative duty to these wards
of Government demand our anxious and
constant intention lo their material well
being, to their progress in the arts ol civ
ilization, and above all to that moral train
ing which, under the blessing of Divine
Providence, will conler upnn them eleva

and consolations of tbe Christian faith.
I suggested in my last annual message,
ihe propriety of remodeling our Indian

double advanlago of taking so much labor

that the war powor it still our main ro litice.

have thus far borne iheir harder part so
nobly and well ; and it may be ettoomed
fortunate that in giving tha grcute.t cfll

also honorably encourage gallant uicD, from
