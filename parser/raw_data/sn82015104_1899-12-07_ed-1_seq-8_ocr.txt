Several Families in the Vicinity of
Sumner, in Pierce County, Com
pelled to Move to Escape the
Torrent, and Hundreds of Acres
of the Most Productive Land in
the State Destroyed.
TACOMA (Wash.), Dec. 6.—Practi
cally the whole of Stuck River Valley
is one vast sheet of water. The river
itself is a raging torrent, destroying
hundreds of acres of the most produc
tive land in the State, and threaten
ing some substantial dwellings. It 13
higher than ever before known since
the valley was settled by white men.
Several families in the vicinity of Sum
ner have been compelled to move to
escape the torrent.
The rise in the river since the heavy
rains has been the greatest and most
rapid ever known. Seventeen inches
in oae hour is recorded at Sumner, and
now Che water is between six and sev
en feet above the ordinary high water
level.
At present the damage throughout
the valley as a result of the flood can
not be estimated.

The pressure has risen rapidly over
Utah, Nevada and Southern California.
It is beginning to fall rapidly along the
Oregon coast, and a moderate disturb
ance will probably develop by Thurs
day morning. The influence of . the
storm will probably extend southward
as far as the 40th parallel. The area
of high pressure over Nevada and
Utah will probably check temporarily
any southerly extension of the low.

A TREASURY RULING.
Relating to Foreign Freight Pass
ing Through This Country.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. fi—The
Treasury Department at Washington
has just made a ruling that has caused
great perturbation in railroad circles,
as the effect of the ruling will be to
deprive the transcontinental lines of a
large quantity of freight business,
which will be transferred by reason cf
the ruling to the Canadian Pacific and
the Panama route.
Heretofore shipments of merchandise
made from Liverpool or other Euro
pean ports designed for the Asiatic
seaboard have been sent by steamer to
New York, thence across the continent
by rail to San Francisco, and thence
by steamer from this port to the Asia
tic port of destination. Only such
shipments come by this route as are to
fill hurry-up orders. The goods have
been allowed to pass through this
country without hindrance or added
expense. But the new ruling of the
Treasury Department requires all such
shipments to be delayed for appraise
ment at New York or San Francisco,
and if the appraisement should be
higher than the invoice value, a duty
penalty must be paid, which will not
be refunded on exportation.
DE LAVEAGA WILL CASE.

HO MUN'S DEATH.
A Claim to Be Made Against the
United States for 850,000.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. o.—The
Chinese and Portuguese Governments,
through their local Consuls, will join
in a claim against the United States
and J. R. Dunn. Chief of the Chinese
Bureau, for $50,000 as compensation
for the death of Ho Mun, a native of
Portugal and a subject of China.
The complaint, which will be filed to
morrow with Collector of Customs
Jackson, recites that Ho Mun died by
reason of the negligent treatment of
the United States Government, through
its agent, J. R. Dunn. It is alleged
that he declined to allow Ho Mun to
have medical attention, though Collec
tor Jackson had issued an order au
thorizing a doctor to see the patient.
The case proceeds under the treaty
of 1894, based on the convention of
1880. Direct charges against Dunn
will be sent to Collector Jackson and
Secretary Gage. Ho Mun was in this
port an applicant for admission when
he was taken sick.

pressed its willingness to come to the
Pacific Coast, and it will probably be
seen here on Christmas. If the Uni
versity of California eleven decides not
to meet the Eastern players, the Stan
ford boys stand ready to accept their
challenge. In that case California will
play the Los Angeles Athletic Club at
Los Angeles on Christmas, and the
Multnomah Athletic Club at Portland
on New Year's. If California plays Car
lisle, it will probably take on the Los
Angeles club on New Year's Day.

rifle during the attack.
NO WORD FROM YOUNG.
WASHINGTON, Dec. o.—General
Otis to-day cabled the War Department
that he has had no word from General
j Young for a week. This is taken to
| indicate that Young is connubttg his
i hot pursuit of Aguinaldo, and probabl\
is in a country where he regards it as
unsafe to use couriers. General Otis'
dispatch,, which follows, also gives an
official account of Lieutenant Colonel
Parker's engagement at Vigan:
"Manila. Dec. t>. —General Young,
with thirteen companies of infantry
and nine trcons of cavalry, has not
! been heard from since the 20th ultimo,
j He was then about twenty miles
lof Vigan, and most of the trooDS
' marching to his support, but he then
i had with him three troops of cavalry
! and a battalion of the Thirty-third In
[ fantry sent by boat to Vigan to rein
| force the navy there. Lieutenant Col
onel Parker of the Forty-fifth reports
from Vigan, on the sth inst that he has
not heard from Y T oung for a week.
"Insurgents 800 strong made an at
tack on Parker's force, consisting of B
Company and 153 sick and fcotsore
men of the Thirty-third Infantry at 4
j o'clock on the morning of the 4ih, en-
I tering the city in darkness. Severe
I street fighting ensued, continuing for
! four hours. The enemy driven out, leav
-1 ing behind forty dead, thirty-two pris-
I oners, including many officers, and
eighty-four rifles. Now on the outskirts

out indefinitely and plenty of rations
and ammunition. His loss eight enlisted
men killed and three wounded. One
hundred and sixty men are now being
transported from San Fabian to his
relief. Young must be in vicinity with
large force."
DO NOT BELIEVE AGUINALDO
WANTS TO SURRENDER.
WASHINGTON, Dec. G.—Relative to
the rumor from Hongkong that Aguin
aldo is willing to surrender to L'nited
States Consul Wildman, it ig learned
1 that though the Consul himself has
j cherished that belief for some months
| past, the Government here has been
i without any assurance of the sound
ness of hia conclusion. Mr. Wildman
is not the only official representing the
Government in the Far East who has
expressed confidence in his ability to
persuade Aguinaldo to cease hostili
ties, but for some reason the Admin
istration has always been somewhat
skeptical as to these undertakings. This
report from Hongkong is bdlieved to
be nothing more than a revival of some
of the old rumors.
M'KINLEY'S STATE PAPER.
! Received by All Classes of Cubans
With Much Satisfaction.
HAVANA, Dec. fi.—President McKin
ley's message to Congress has been re
ceived by Cubans of all classes with
much satisfaction. Even the leaders
of the extreme party admit this, and
the announcement that there will be
no American civil Governor has cleared
away the clouds that had been hanging
over the Cuban political situation. The
"Lucha" alone among the papers still
favors a civil Governorship.
General Collaso says: "The message
will pacify the country. The President's
statements are not very concrete, but
if Congress guarantees the independ
ence of Cuba we need not ask for any
specification as to the time for the re
moval of the American troops, although
everybody would be glad to see the
black troops go, because of the ex
cesses they commit. Cubans fear the
Administration, but they do not fear
Congress. The Administration repre
sents the trusts. Although Cubans are
as good business men as Americans,
they could not compete with the enor
mous power of the trusts, which, by
creating monopolies, would eventually
enslave the workingman. We wish to
see each man owning some property,
at least enough to make it worth his
while to behave as a good citizen
should, instead of going to the woods."
Gualberto Gomez said: "I had ex
pected the message to be encouraging,
but I had not expected such clearness
of thought. Congress will go further,
and will justify the hope of the Cuban
people."
The "Discussion" says: "President
McKinley's message will fill the hearts
of all lovers of Cuba with joy. His
words, 'Whatever be the outcome we
must see to it that free Cuba be a
reality, not a name,' should be written
in leters of gold over the door of the
Cuban White House. The Cuban re
public will be bound to Lincoln and
McKinley by indissoluble bonds of
love."
The "Patria" says: "Hurrah for Pres
ident McKinley! He could not have
spoken in clearer tones. It is impossi
ble for the giddiness of conquest to
overpower the deep, natural impulse of
a noble and democratic people."
The "Cubano" says: "The message
contains the clearest words yet spoken
by President McKinley, and shows that
jutice is the guiding principle at Wash
ington. Our hearts, hitherto bowed
down by tremendous skepticism, are
now relieved, and we may expect Con -
gress to speak still more clearly."
WELL RECEIVED ALSO IN MEX
ICO.
CITY OF MEXICO, Dec. 6. — The
cordial tone of President McKinley's
allusions to Mexico in his message to
Congress were well received here, where
the message was read with great inter
est; also his remarks on trusts, as trade
combinations are being made here, for
it seems probable that the industrial
combinations will be one of the most
important phases of the business situa
tion in this country. President Mc-
Kinley's frank declaration that the Isl
and of Cuba is being held in trust for
the Cuban people, and that the United
States Government intends honestly
carrying out the intentions of its Con
gress, declared at the outset of the
war, causes favorable comment, and it
is believed that the same sentiment
will be expressed throughout Latin-
America, awakening friendly feelings
for the great northern republic.
GRAND ARMY OF REPUBLIC.
Annual Encampment to Be Held at
Chicago August 28th.
CHICAGO, Dec. 6.—The National
Council of the Grand Army of the Re
public, meeting here to-day with the
local general committee, agreed on
August 2Sth to September Ist as the
date of the next annual encampment,
which will be at Chicago.
In the general discussion of the coun
cil it was agreed that the encampment
should be held at some time during the
public school vacation, that the
public schools might be used as sleep
ing Quarters for members. It was
said by members of the committee
that there were many veterans who
might wish to attend the encampment
who could not stand the financial bur
den of paying bills at crowded hotels.
At other encampments tents have been
used, but the committee deems it more
advisable to use the school buildings.
The members of the committee called
on Mayor Harrison at the close of the
morning session. Mayor Harrison
urged that the encampment be made
non-partisan in every detail, and sug
gested that inasmuch as President Mc-
Kinley would be present, the Democrat
ic Presidential nominee be also invited.
This will be done.
RECIPROCITY TREATIES.
Those Negotiated During Recess of
Congress Transmitted to Senate.
WASHINGTON, Dec. o.—The reci
procity treaties negotiated during the
Congressional recess wsre transmitted
to the Senate to-day, and in the exec
utive session were ordered printed and
referred to the Committee on Foreign
Relations.
The most important of these treaties
is that between the United States and
France for reciprocal reductions of tar
iff rates. The terms of this and the
other treaties are not yet officially pub
lic. 1
The reciprocity treaties negotiated
with Great Britain are four in number,
for Jamaica, Guayara, Barbadoes and
Bermuda, the Trinidad treaty having
been withdrawn. In the main the con
cessions to the colonies are qn food
products, while reductions on manu
factures, flour, etc., are understood to
be the chief advantages given to the
United States.
THE RATE WAR.
A Meeting to Be Held to Consider
the California Fare.
CHICAGO. Dec. 6.—The Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe Railroads
have agreed to call a meeting of pas
senger officials of all transcontinental
lines to consider the California rate..
It will be held in Chicago as soon after
December 15th as possible.
A party of three secured tickets from
Chicago to California to-day at a net
rate of $40 for second class, which is
$12.50 below tariff. A rate of .Sill first
class from St. Paul to New York is be
ing made by the Sioux City and North
ern and Canadian Pacific. This prob
ably will be met by the Chicago and
Great Western and Grand Trunk which
will take other lines into the trouble.
Sharp Advance in Petroleum.

advance in crude petroleum was male
jby the Standard Oil Company to-day.

months ago, oil has risen over 40 cents
a barrel. Production is said to be 20.
--000 barrels a day below the demand.
Refined oil, which Is burned in the
houses of the people, has gone up from
2% to 3% cents. To-day's quotation
was at the highest point in years.
Nebraska Senatorship.
OMAHA, Dec. 6.—Ever since the late
Senator Hayward was taken sick and it
was known that the chances were
against his recovery, there has been
considerable talk as to whom Governor
Poynter would appoint to the vacancy.
The only ones prominently mentioned
are ex-Senator Allen and G. M. Hitch
cock, editor of the Omaha "World-Her
ald." The Democrats are urging the
appointment of the latter. The Popu
lists insist upon the naming of ex-Sena
tor Allen.

When the Next Century Begins.
"Hundreds of persons contend that
the twentieth century will begin with
January 1, 1000, while other hundreds
contend with equal positiveness that
the correct date is January 1, 1901,"
writes Edward Bok in the October "La
dies' Home Journal." "The 1900 con
tingent argue that, of course, the new
century begins with its numeral date,
and go on to figure out very deftly
that with the last day of the year 1809
the hundred years will have run their
course. They argue that if the first
year, ended with December 31st of the
year one, the nineteen hundredth year
must, of course, end with December 31,
1599, and that the Ist day of January,
1900, is therefore the first day of the
new century. And, curiously enough,
this latter figure is correct, but only
in a numeral sense. These statisticians
overlook one very important fact, how
ever: that it requires one hundred
years to make a century, and it calls
for no expert mathematician to figure
it out that the full hundred years of
the nineteenth century will not have
run their course until 12 o'clock mid
night of the 31st of December, 1900.
Numerically, we enter the twentieth
century with January 1, 1900. But,
nevertheless, we must complete that
entire year of 1900. and go through its
365 days, before the actual nineteen
hundred years shall have run their
course."
A Strategic Son.
A good story is told of a young man,
who, besides being of the spendthrift
order, is a mimic and can imitate his
father's voice to a nicety. Not long
ago the young man wanted, without
delay, some money to pay a bill, and
he knew that his father would treat
his request with cold contempt. Wait
ing till he knew that his father would
be away he went to the telephone and
rang up the office, calling for the cash
ier. The cashier was forthcoming, and
when he was at the other end the
young man imitated his sire's voice.
"I say, Blank, if that scapegrace son
of mine comes around and asks for
$100, don't give it to him. Only give
him $50."
The cashier promiseof' that he would
fulfill the commands. Not long after
the son called at the office and demand
ed $100. He was refused by the con
scientious cashier, and, apparently in
anger, the young man contented him
self with the $50. When the old man
reached the office there was a scene. —
