Washington. Dec. 7.?Quite a sen?
sation was er?, feted in the political
world on Friday when the president
stated to a prominent banker of
Pennsylvania, who told him that the
people of that State wanted him for
another term. "That cannot be. I
oannot serve bevond my present term.
I am grateful to the American people
for their kindly feeling toward me,
but somebody else must carry on the
work." The conviction is growing
among the national commltteemen of
the Republican party, in session in
Washington this week, that this state?
ment Is final and the belief Is current
that an official statement will be made,
to this effect before many more weeks.
The conviction as it spreads leaves
some of the commltteemen without
anchorage. Few are willing to risk
the chance of falling out with the
administration, and some have re?
course to the entirely safe course of
declaring for Mr. Roosevelt despite
his personal attitude. But this con?
viction is cause for Infinite relief
among those politicians who at heart
wish some other candidate, but who
fear the consequences of aligning
themselves with the faction which op?
poses Mr. Roosevelt. Thus it will be
seen clearly that the Republican
brethren do, not dwell together In
peace and harmony.

Evidence has already been given
that the arn.y nominations sent to the
senate by the president are not to be
permitted to^go through without
question by that body. Protests have
been filed against confirmation of
Brig. Qen. J. B. Aleshire, to be quar?
termaster general, and against Brig.
Gen. William W. Wltherspoon. of, the
War.College, on the ground, that
Mar Ymv? t>oen advanced over the
heads of officers ahead of them in
rank. The real facts In the case are
that Senator Hopkins, of Illinois, has
a constituent in Chicago who is en?
deavoring to palm off on the govern?
ment a batch of horses pronounced
unfit by Gen. Ale?hlre who lg an ex?
pert In these matter?. Hence the
hold-up of his promotion by the Illi?

The recall of Viscount Aokl and
the Information receive.1 at the State
department from our ambassador at
Tokyo that Baron Kogoro Takahlra
will In all probability succeed Vis?
count Aokl as Japanese ambassador
at Washingtaon, have created no little
sensation in diplomatic and admlsls
tratlon circles. Baron Takahlra's ap?
pointment would undoubtedly be ac?
ceptable to this government, and he Is
on very good terms with Presldnet
Roosevelt. Some effort has been
made to make It appear that Am?
bassador Aokl's return to Japan Is
a symptom of friction in the relations
between the United States and Japan,
bA this Is treated as absurd by the
administration. While the real rea?
sons for the recall are not as yet per?
fectly understood, It Is quite certain
this country has had no ?.und in the
matter. The recall is a'i affair OfetuS
Jupuneso diplomatic service, and Its
motive must bo sought for In the pur?

is whispered that Mayor Tom John?

the promise of a fund of $100,000, all
of which has been raised, and much
by popular subscription, to have the
next convention held In the Forest

SOUTHERN REPUBLICANS TO
STAND TOGETHER.
An Iron-Clad Agreement Has Been
.Made And The G. O. P. Propose To
Present Unbreakable Front.
Washington, Dec. 6.?The Republi?
cans of the South, represented here
by their national commltteemen, have
determined that there shall be a
"solfd South" in Republican politics,
as unbreakable a force In the coming
convention as the Democratic majori?
ty In general elections.
The national commltteemen from
all the Southern States, with the ex?
ception of Tennessee, Kentucky and
Arkansas, have entered In to an
agreement, which they say Is absolute
and Ironclad; that th? y will stand
together in all matters before the na?
tional committee and that they will
fsecure^defi'?,\tcs" to the '""national Re^
publican convention next year who
will vote solidly on alf* questions, in?
cluding the nomination for the pres?
idency. Colorado, New Mexico, Alas?
ka and the District of Columbia are
in the coalition With the following
Southern sTtatea: Maryland, Virginia,
North and South Carolina, Georgia,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisi?
ana and Texas.
Tb*.' real ohjtct of the coalition is to
force the r nomination of Rosevelt,
and It Is all the work of these two
astute and active political manipula?
tors, Frank H. Hitchcock, first as?
sistant postmaster general, and his
Southern lieutenant, John Q, Capers,
'commissioner of internal revenue. A
point considered especially siggnlfl
cai.t is the fact that the negro, Jud
son Lyon of Georgia, eschews bis
1 grievance against the president and
j?lns the pro-Roosevelt coalition.

BrmrnloV of Tennessee, Yerkes of

states, though h* official manipulat?
ors aforesaid dtcaro that they will
wrest this power from them and line
those States up f* Roosevelt. The
delegates from the furious states are
not to be openly pMged to anyone.
When the conve*j0n meets they
are to vote a solid ^te for the man
who aotma to them I the time to be

be given at the p?ychOjgical moment,

I have read these resolutions with
uch interest, and I believe that the
imter chamber of commerce, in
opting these resolutions, is contrib
ing to the advancement of the best
terests of Sumter, and. the entire
ate of South Carolina. I believe
at your chamber of commerce made
> mistake in expressing the opinion
lat "the future increased population,
?osperity and wealth of South Caro
na is largely dependent on increased
lilway mileage and facilities to take
ire of the continual increasing de
lands made upon them by the
rowth of the State." I am satisfied
lat one of the most urgent needs of
ur entire Southern section is more
fflclent trasportatior. facilities, and I
elieve, therefore, that it is to the in?
vest of the ptople, fully as much as
1 the railways, that the_^cblie poli?
cies of our States should be such as
to encourage railway development.
I believe that the people of South
Carolina will have no reason to regret
the conservative policy of their legis?
lature in dealing with transportation
matters, and I believe that the best
interests of the carriers and of the
public served by them, will be ad?
vanced ' by harmonious co-operation
under laws'* promoting the largest
amount of freedom of action, consist?
ent with the protection of the public
from wrong, and the guaranteeing tc
all of equality of treatment on the
highways of commerce.
Thanking you for sending me the
resolutions, I am,
Yours very truly,

BRYAN ENDORSES POINTS IN
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
When Interviewed In Pittsburg He
Said That He Heartily Approved ol
Campaign Fund Proposition And
Postal Savings Banks.
Pittsburg, Dec. 4.?Wm. J. Bryan,
en route to his hom& in Lincoln, Xeb.,
arrived here today from Washington.
By appointment, Mr. Bn>an met his
wife and daughter at the Fort Pitt
hotel. The latter are bound for Xew
York, whence they will sail for Eu?
rope Saturday
Mr. Bryan will ' not accompany
them, he said, on account of his lec?
ture engagements.
Mr. Bryan was reluctant to discuss
President Roosevelt's message to con?
gress, saying that he had not sufficient
time to read it through. He however
commented freely on several of the
most important issues and gave Presi?
dent Roosevelt credit for introducing
an original proposition in suggesting
tne appropriation of campaign funds
by the government.
"Ijhope," he said "that it will be
enacted into a law."
On important Questions, Mr. ?Bry?
an's idea coincides with the texture
of the message. He is strictly in'ac?
cord with tha president concerning
postal savings banks and guaranteed
banks. He said:
"The plan of the guaranteed bank
is simply this: Statistics show the av?
erage loss to depositors to be very
small taking all the banks together;
but the depositors are afraid because
they do not know much about the af?
fairs of any particular hank. The
postmaster general, in recommending
the postal savings banks, called atten?
tion to the faet that a large sum of
money is' sent back to the government
banks of Europe by people who are
afraid to trust thle private banks here,
and Mr. Wannamaker has been quot?
ed as saying that a large sum is kept
in hoarding and hiding places In this
country.
"If this sum can be drawn into the
banks and thus be put. into channels
of trade it will relieve the stringency
more effectively than ...lything else.
The postal bank will do this to a
limited extent, but not completely, for
in the plan proposed the depositors
will he limited as to each person and
there will be no checking account al?
lowed. .
"The system of the guaranteed
bank-s contemplates the absolute
guarantee by the government of such
banks as ma}* voluntarily enter into
the system, in entering the system
they agree to reimburse the govern?
ment in proportion to their deposits
for any loss incurred by the govern?
ment in payment of depositors in fail?
ed banks. During the last 40 years
the average loss among national
banks has been less than one-tenth
of 1 per cent, of deposits and as are
have been through two panics in that
time it is not likely that the average
loss will be greater during the next
40 years.
"To sum up the situation, the de?
positors need security and this must
either be given by the postal savings
banks, which will grow until it has
absorbed the deposit banking of the
country, or it must be furnished
through the guarantee of existing
banks."

CRIME AND DRINK.
Among the articles sent out this
week by the Associated Prohibition
Press Publicity Bureau is found the
following suggestion:
If the daily press would classify
regularly all the crimes, suicides, rail?
road accidents, business failures, con?
flagrations, divorces, deaths, the po?
litical and social scandals due to>
drink and the drink traffic, the nation
would rise en masse ln-ide of one 1?
month and sweep the whole curse Into
the depths of the Atlantic and Pa?
cific. ?
Let* the "great metropolitan" newsT
papers instruct the Associated Pres.*
to report the part that drink plays in
the daily harvest of debauchery,
crime, destruction of private and pub?
lic property and depreciation of labor,
wages and civic' credit, and let these
impartial records write the deatbi
warrant for the business.
L- t us inaugurate a movement tor
give the liquor traffic all the publicity
it deserves, not through g4u?ed lie^i
aitd misrepresentation on the adver?
tising page, but by the fairer and !?w?
interested channels of the news col?
umns themselves, wherever drink
ttalks openly or furtively a- the e:cu>*?
ana provocation of disaster, disg; ice
und diabolism.
Several of the leading daily news?
papers of the nation have recnt!..' de?
clared thenfselves favorable to thin,
proposition. 1
If the prohibitionists and Christian
people want such a plan adopted and
pu* Into operation they can bring it
about.
Ail they need to do is t?> say
with sufficient emphasis and t!:< prang
IT: til heed them.
Nothing could be fairer for tn<
llqi'or trade?as a matt? r ?f fact it
would be Impossible to ? take i c m
pl? te catalogue of all the crime due
to drink, bjt the icgular publication
of even a fr ctlon of the caret whom
dvlrk was Incontestanly a prime fur*
t??r would arrest the attention of every
thlnklnfg Citizen.
Ey all means let the plan be press?
ed until every newspaper in the coun?
try is willing to ht its record of cur?
rent events tell the exact facts about
the drink triffic and its endless train
of bitterness and spoliation.
