Congress Meets To-day.
An Interesting Programme
for the First Day. The
President's Message
Will Probably be
Sent in Today.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.-The Fifty
fourth Congress will convene to
morrow at 12 o'clock according to
law, in first regular session. In the
Senate, the 29 members whose terms
begin with this Congress and to
whose admission no objection is
made, will be sworn in. The list in?
cludes 16 new members of the body.
The credentials of Mr. Dupont, who
claims a seat from Delaware, to suc?
ceed Mr. Higgins, will, according to
present arrangements, be referred to
the committee on privileges and
elections and pending investigation
and report he will not be seated The
oath of office having been adminis?
tered to the newly-elected members,
notification will be sent to the House
that- the Senate is organized and
ready for business and prepared to
join the House in the appointment of
a committee to wait upon the Presi?
dent to notify him of the assembling
and organization of Congress, ready
to receive any communication ne
may have to make. This notification
will probably be made to Cleveland
on Tuesday and his annual message
will be read that afternoon.
After the adjournment of the Sen?
ate, a caucus of Republican members
will be held. It is given out to?
night that no decisive action will be
decided upon. The meeting is more
for the purpose of a general confer?
ence, it being the first opportunity
for senators to get together after the
uine month's recess. A nomination
for president of the Senate pro tem.
may be agreed upon and committee
vacancies will be discussed The
elective offices will also be consid?
ered, but no action on these matters
is expected for several days at least.
In the mean time, however, there
will be tlie re arrangement of com?
mittees and the matter of distributing
the appropriation bills among the ap
propriation committees, after the
method that obtains in the House,
to occupy the attention of the cau?
cuses. A resolution providing for
this distribution will be offered as
soon as practicable, it is 6aid. by
Senator Dubois.
There are numerous candidates for
the two elective offices of the Senate
The most prominent one for secretary
js the Hon. George C Goiman, of
California, who foeld the position fyr,
12 years N? prograFriiiie has been
arranged for the rest of the week
after Tuesday and aside fron) the in?
troduction of bills and resolutions,
the transaction of business is not ;
looked ior.
The first day in the House will be
exhausted by the routine of organi?
zation First tho 356 members and
four delegates will have to be sworn
in, the roil being called by the clerk
of the old liouse, Hon. James Kerr.
Then viii come the election of I
speaker and the subordinate officers,
according to the results of the Re?
publican caucus on Saturday night.
? roi! call will probably be had
upon the election of speaker, but
tte other officers, it is expected will
t)e named together in a resolution,
"and the resolution adopted viva voce, j
The usual motions to notify the Sen
ate and to appoint a committe to in
form the President will follow And
if there be time remaining, the bi en
nial lotter}7 known as the drawing of
seats will take place.
An adjourned Democratic caucus I
will be held Monday afternoon, to
select the persons to be appointed to
the several minor positions allotted
to them in the organization of the
house Aside from the introduction
of the new measures, bills, resolu?
tions, etc., no business is anticipated
this week. The adoption of new
rules and the appointment of com?
mittees by Speaker Reed are the first
matters of general interest and im?
portance that will be accomplished.
In the hurry and confusion of re?
porting the caucus, which was held
behind closed doors the vote upon
the election of a cleark of the
caucus, was reversed last night. Mr.
W. B. Hooker, of New York, was
chosen, not Mr. Ellis, of Oregon, his
competitor.
A Household Treasure.
D. W. Fuller, of Cannjoharie, X. Y., sny.-s j
rbat he always keeps Dr. King's Nev/ Discovery ;
in the house- and his family has always found
the very best results follow its use; that he would
j
not oe without it, if procurable. 6, A. Dyke ,
man, Druggist, Catskill. N. Y-, says that Dr
Ki:.g's New Discovery io undoubtedly the best
Cough remedy; tnathe has used it in his ?an?'y
for eight years, and it has never failed to do all j
that i3 claimed for it. Why not try a remedy
SO long tried and tested. Trial bottles free at j

can always find prize shoes in
our stock. There's nothing
gained by wearing inferior foot?
wear. ?o one ever saves mon?
ey by doing so. There isn't
enongh wear in a poor shoe to
make it worth while to wear it.
Attempting to make a poor
shoe pass for a good one is like
trying to make a quarter pass
for a dollar ; it can?t be done.
Our shoes are up to date in
style, handsome in shape, and
appearance, first class in quali?
ty, and low in price. As good
a shoe as ours would cost you
more anywhere else.
Come and see for yourself.
