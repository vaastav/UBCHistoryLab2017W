on Administration.-
^e^' Xork. Dec. 8.—The World, to
Which Delaven Smith, editor, of the In
dianapolis News, referred in iris re
ply to President Roo'sevelt'-s attack up
pn "him, as authority for the article on
the Panama canal, Which, appeared in
bis paper, and called forth the presi
Rent's letter says today:
"In view.'of Rooseveit's 'deliberate
misstatements of fact in his scandalous
personal attack upon Delavan Smith,
the World calls upon the congress of
£he United States to make immediate
ly a full and impartial investigation of
the entire, Panama canal scandal.
"World" Asks Questions.
The'World, alter reviewing, at length,
the testimony brought out in the in-:
Vestlgation of lS0(N)y the senate com
mittee, asks:
"Why" did the United Statea pay
140,060,066 for a bankrupt property
Whose control could undoubtedly have
been bought in the open market for
Jess than $46,000,000? Who were the
Panama Carnal company? Who bought
up %he obligations of the old Panama
Canal company for a few cents on the
dollars? Almong whom was a, dividend
of $16,000,000 paid to the new Panama
-Canal company? Whether Douglas
{Robinson, who is Roosevelt's brother-i
In-law, or any of Taft's brothere asso
elated themselves with Cromwell in the
{Panama exploitation or shared in these
profits ie incidental to ithe main issue
pt letting in light," Whether they did
er did dot, whether all the profits went
Into Cromwell's hands or whatever
... became of them, the fact that Theo-
Reosevelt as president of the Un-s
tted. States issues apubllo statement
about such, an important matter full
of flagrant untruths, reeking with mis
statements, challenging line by line the
testimony of his associate, Cromwell,
and the official record, makes it im
perative that publicity come atk once
thru authority- and toy action of con
gress.
Demand That Congress Act.
"The natural query of the Indianap
olis News as .to "Who got the money?'
was based on the World's historical
summary of William Nelson Crom
well's connection with the Panama
canal. The Inquiry was originally the
World's and the World accepts Roose
velt's challenge. If congress can have
ell the documents In thq( case, as
Roosevelt says, let congress make a
complete Investigation of the Panama
canal" affair, and In particular of
Cromwell's relations with the* French
company, trlth Panama and with the
government of the United States. Let
"Congress officially answer this ques-
tkm:-*Who got the money?*"
C. P. TAFT MAKES REPLY.
Cincinnati Trme*-8tar Says Panama
Story Was Used fisr Politics.
Cincinnati, 71ec. &—The Cincinnati
Times-Star, air which Charles P. Taft
Is editor and proprietor, today pub
lished a reply to the articles on the
Panama canal, which appeared In the
JtndianapoUs News and New York
World. It says that the World is re
sponsible for most of the talk about
the "Panama scandal" during the re
cent campaign that the "Panama
story was used In the campaign for
political reasons, eolely. One ithing
that gave it political value In the eye3
of those who used it was the fact that
the story, 4s printed, carried the names
of the brother of the republican can
didate for the presidency, and the
brother-in-la^- of the president. The
inference was plain enough. It was
that Theodore Roosevelt and William
H. Taft had used their influence as
high officials of the government to
belp near relatives in looting the treas
ury at Washington. That was the
-meat of the story. 'If the names of
Douglas Robinson and Charles P. Taft
had not been Included in it, flimsy and
absurd as it was, the lying yarn would
never have been iised by the World, In
ckianapolis News and other papers,
•which for one reason or another wanted
to defeat Taft and discredit Roosevelt.
The World is trying to dodge the is
sue. It wants to be relieved of the re
eponalbility of trying to drag the names
of Rihinson and Taft into its inade-to
order mess of scandal and slime. Both
the World and the Indianapolis News
are crying 'let' in the 'light.' We
thoroughly agree with them. But after
a little time has passed, ofter the most
'desperate efforts of the cornered World
end News have produced all the evi
dence they can, an apology will be in
order from those newspapers. In the
meantime, Mr. Taft reserves the right
to.take legal -steps, which -have possibly
been made more desirable by the events
and insinuations of bhe ipant forty-eight
hours."
PROBE ALLEGED CANAL "DEAL."
Resolution for Investigation of Charges
js Introduced in Congress.
Washington, Dec. 8.—-The democrats
c:of
the house are planning to demand
Investigation of the purchase of the
Mm'*.
t{- »,
Panama canal property, and In con
formity with this program, Represen
tative Rainey of Illinois, introduced a
resolution directing the speaker to ap
point a committee of five to "ascertain
how much of the $40,000,000 which
appears of record to have been paid
to the French company was really paid
to that company." It is said that the
national democratic committee re
quested Mr. Rainey to present the reso
lution.
The resolution provides that the com
mittee shall ascertain if any portion
of the $40,000,000 was directly or in
directly paid to American citizens, or
to any American syndicate, and if any
member or senator profited by the
transaction.
During the recent compaign it was
charged in newspaper articles that the
president's brother-in-law, Douglass
Robinson of New York, and Charles P.
Taft, brother of the president-elect, had
profited by the transaction. It was
this charge and newspaper comment
thereon which provoked the letter from
President Roosevelt to William Dudley
Foulke of Indiana, denying the state
ments and saying that all the papers
in the matter were open to the public.

Trinidad, Col., Dec. 18.—Maggie
Garcia, aged 18, and Francisco Martin

night, the heads having been split open
with an ax. A posse located Martinez
and -the girl Sunday night in a lonely
canyon, and a guard was established

after murdering her parents, and
then .blew out his own brains. Martinez
had -no horses, and had forced the girl
to walk with him to -the .place where
they were found. Martinez was .par
doned a year ago, from the New Mex

was serving a term for theft. His at
tentions had been refused -by Maggie
Garcia and he had -been ordered away
from the Garcia ranch. The quadruple

SEVERE PENALTY PROPOSED
Too Much Dishonesty in Sales of
He would have nursery farms sub
ject to inspection by inspectors ap
pointed by the state department an.d he
would require each nursery to have a
license. Further than this he would ask
that the law compel every nurseryman
to properly and correctly label all
goods offered for sale. The secretary
says that there is no reason why Iowa
should not have a pure horticultural
law as well as a pure foocMaw. It was
further suggested by Mr. Greene that
the legislature should vest the board of
horticulture with authority to establish
ru^e.s and regulations for the care and
management of orchards anc^ the sale
of frg^t and stock.

lation regarding*' the sale of nursery
stock, seeds and fruit products was re
commended this afternoon by Wesley
Greene, of Davenport, in his report a#
secretary of the Iowa State Horticult
ural society to the annual meeting
here.
He would have a law making Jt a
crime punishable by a fine from $100
to $500 for any salesman to falsely rep
resent nursery stock.
He would have a statute requiring
that every salesman of nursery stock
be required to have a certificate issued
from the state horticultural department
after investigation discloses the sales
man to .be of good moral character and
a resident freeholder. Such a law would
exclude itinerent nursery salesmen
from other states whose dealings, it is
claimed, have caused no end of grief
in Iowa.

BURLINGTON GETS CERTIORARI
Technical Fight in the United States
Supreme Court to Postpone Recovery.
Washington, Dec. S.—United States
Senator Albert J. Hopkins appeared in
the supreme court as counsel for -the
Chicago, Burlington and Quincy rail
way company. His brief for the rail
road, which is resisting a suit for dam
ages sustained by the next of kin of
Harold R. Wellman, who was killed on
the road, was filed on Nov. 23.
Senator Hopkins sets up the tech
nical plea that the present railroad
corporation is not responsible for dam
ages caused by its predecessor from
which it leased its lines.
About five years before Harold R.
Wellman lost his life the Chicago, Bur
lington and Quincy railroad company,
an Illinois corporation, leased its lines
to the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy
railway company, an Iowa company.
On 'that account and from verbal dif
ference in the names, the Iowa com
pany insists that the Illinois concern is
merely "a naked corporate entity," as
Senator-Hopkins described it.
As against an Iowa concern^ it is
claimed' no suits could be prosecuted
against it in the Illinois state courts,
but in federal courts only. The case
was subsequently removed to the fed
eral courts, where the rights of the
dead man were upheld.
The railroad now is fighting damages,
as usual, and on motion of Senator
Hopkins th«^ United States supreme
court granted a petition for a writ of
certiorari, -the effect of which will be to
keep the heirs of Wellman out of their
money for a long time to come.
ROCKEFELLER TO LONDON?
John D. Buys Property Abroad and
May Join Fashionable Colony.
London, Dec. 8.—John D. Rockefeller
is to become a member of London's
colony of fashionables for at least part
of every year, according to indications
discovered today when it learned that
the American oil king had purchased
houses at 38 and 40 Queen Anne's gate,
and begun their demolition to make
way for a huge marble palace.
AVhiie the transfer of property has
not yet been officially recorded, owing
to the amount of English red tape in
volved, several prominent real estate
dealers are authority for the state
ment that a deal has been completed
and the preliminary transfer made.
When the news reached Bond street
today it caused considerable specula
tion as to what part the prosecution of
the Standard Oil company had played
in influencing Mr. Rockefeller to pur
chase an English home.
The possibility that he might again
become a fellow countryman of Will
lam Waldorf Astor was generally dis
credited.
Queen Anne's G3.t6 is on© of the most
fashionable districts London's ultra ex
clusive section.

AVashington, Dec. 8.—The Fldel-lty
Funding company of New York is in
the hands of a receiver and the report

$50,000 against President Kieran, of
t^e company, in addition to holdings
of $10,000 of the company's stock. The
liabilities are stated at $4,500,000,

Philadelphia, Dec. 8.—Former Secre
tary Leslie M. Shaw, who is president
of the First Mortgage Guarantee and
Trust company, of this city, admitted
today that ie Fidelity Funding com
pany, of New York, owes him $60,000.
Said Shaw:
"My loans are fully covered by bonds
which are as safe as the bonds of any
government on earth and margined
with additional notes at nearly 100 per
cent. I think the same is true with
most all the banks and insurance com
panies. Some papers have spoken of
St. Mary's Academy of the Benedictine
Sisters of Visitation and other Catho
lic societies and institutions as credi
tors. Unfortunately, these societies are
debtors. Banks, insurance companies
and private individual" are the credi
tor!."

New York, Dec. 8.—Thomas F. Gil
roy, receiver for the Fidelity Funding
company, said today that there is a
discrepancy of about $1,500,000 as
shown by the -books of the company
which remained in the offices. Gilroy
said It was -improbable the sisters in
charge of St. Mary's academy at Nau
voo, 111., realize the financial condition
dn which that institution has been
placed, and that they still appear to
have confidence in President K'.eran.
Gilroy said the academy has notes out

Washington, Dec. 8.—Herbert ».
Miles, of the tariff committee of the
National Association of Manufactur
ers, resumed, the stand before the house
ways and means committee today. He
continued his arguments for tariff re
vision downward.
The schedules whicih Miles claimed
can be reduced materially are -those
imposing a tariff, on sugar, glass and
hides. Miles said the duty on the low-'
er grades of textiles could be reduced,
while the higher grades could be in
creased. He also declared that the
farmer gets no benefit from the duty
on hides, while as a result of ithe tar
iff on hides the Independent tanners
are imperilled by the packers. Wit
ness then told the committee that 90!
per cent of ithe manufacturers want a
tariff commission or bureau to handle
the revision of the tariff.
Opposed to Tariff Commission.
Replying to this suggestion, Chair
man Payne said there was Bo greater
danger than the perpetual unsettlement
of the tariff.
'1 am confident," said the chairman,
"that the man engaged In business
wants to know that tariff rates are
settled and not subject to changes.-1
don't think there could be any greater
harm to (the country than would result
from having a body of men constantly
agitating ch&nges in the tariff."
Representative Underwood, demo
crat, of Alabama, agreed with Payne
as to the inadvisaflbillty of itavlng a
tariff commission.
'Isn't the difficulty that manufac
turers have experienced in the past due
to the fact that congress has passed a
tariff law and refused to consider any
change In the duties for a decade or
more?" aaked Underwood, He sug
gested that if congress topk up each -,
separate schedule or paragraph that
had become out of alignment whenever
necessary, the .difficulty due to tariff
legislation would be overcome. He did
not think the intervention of a com
mission necessary.
ADVERTISING PAYS IN CHURCH.
Vermont Pastor Tells How He Quad
rupled a Moribund Organization.
Rarre,
vt.,
•s
Dec. 8.—"Does advertising
pay? Well, should say It did, par
tlcularly in religion,'* said the Rev.
Francis A. Poole, pastor of the ^lrsl
Congregational church.
Mr. Poole took charge of the church
three years ago. It.was then a mori
bund organization. Mr. Poole started
with advertisements in the Sunday
morning papers—big ones, a page
when he had the money and three or
four columns at other times. He took
big, black type, and lie told the peo
ple what was going on In the church,
what the sermon would be about, and
who would be there.
"As a result," said Mr. Poole today,
"ithe congregation has quadrupled in
three years, and at today's meeting of V..
trustees we decided to enlarge the
church building to twice Its preaent
size."
HAS A DIVORCE REMEDY.'
Bishop Webb Says 8ocial Ostracism
Will Cheek Evil.
Milwaukee, Dec. 8.—"Social ostracism
for
N
all divorced persons—that, I .be
lieve, is the only remedy for the grow
ing evil of divorce," said Bishop. W.
W. Webb, of the diocese of Milwaukee
today in discussing -this evil.
"Personally," said Bishop Webb, *T
never enter the home of a divorced
-person in a social way, neither do I in
vite any one that I know to (be divorced
to my home. I have lost many dear
friends thru the enforcement of this
rule.
"Years ago, in an address delivered
in Boston, before I was elected bishop,
I took the ground that the only way to
meet the divorce evil was to socially
ostracize all such persons." •.
