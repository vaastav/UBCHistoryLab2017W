John 'BUrn Is Returned to Parlia
ment With Increased Majority and
London Districts Spring Many Sur
prises on Party That Was Long on
Predictions Before Elections Start
edLiberals Say They Will Come
Back With Increased Majorities.
London, Doc. 7. Election returns
contlnuo disappointing to the Union
ists. Tho announcement was mndo
that the government had gained two
seats in Sunderland, reducing the
Unionist net gain to three, but worse
was to follow. Forty constituencies
Trero polled, returning 42 members.
Of these 22 wero In London. Espe
cial Interest Mas centered In Dater
sea, where John Durns, president of
the local government board, had 'a
thrce-cornored fight. The Unionists
hoped the Socialist candidate might
poll 1,000 votes, which would let Sir
John Harrington, their candidate, In,
but Mr. Burns was re-elected with an
increased majority. In January ho
polled 8,540 votes to tho Unionists'
7,800. The Socialist nominee obtain
ed only 477 votes.
London again disappointed the
Unionists hopes. Tho 22 constitu
encies in the city polled returned in
January 13 Unionists, eight Liberal
and one Laborite. Two scats were
lost by tho Unionists, one Lnbo.-lt
and one Liberal golnlng them. Look
ing at the aggregate ote of the 22
constituencies there is noticeable
the same diminution In the poll on
both sides seen throughout the coun
try. In January these 22 constituon
cies cast 107,100 Libpral-Laborite
votes to 11 1, 70S Unionist. Now the
cast 107,400 LiboralLaborlto and
104,315 Unionist vote3. This general
result in London is Indicative of
what is going on throughout Eng
land. While both parties show small
er polls, the Unionists show the
smaller decrease, but it Is not suffl
clcnt to gain seats.
There Is visible the beginning of a
change, the first movement of tho
pendulum toward tho Unionist side,
but there has not been tlmo to es
tablish the change or to glvo the
pendulum full Impetus. The Liberals
now express conildenco that they
will come back with a slightly In
creased majority.
CHURCH NEEDS INSURGENTS
Evansvllle Pastor Declares New Life
Must Be Injected.
Evansvllle, Inil., Dec. 7.-"Tho
church needs Insurgents. Tho mod
ern church Is too respoctable. Wo
must glvo It a shaking up, Just aa
Cummins, Boverldgc, Dolllver, La
Folletto and others have shaken up
the Republican party," Bays Rev. H.
H. Hymes, pastor of Grace Moraorial
Presbyterian church of this city.
"Tho church Is dying of respect
ability, stagnating with custom, par
alyzed with doing things simply be
cause they have been done that way
from time Immemorial.
"I have no uho for freaks, but the
church needs to show that sho haa
life, for life varies.
"You are standpatters, Just llko
Joe Cannon Nelson Aldtlch and
President Taft. Wo must tear off a

Do You Open Your Mouth
Like a young bird and quip down whatever food or medicine may
be offered you ? Or, do you wanyo know something of the com
position ftnd character of that which you take into your stomach
whether as food or medicine?
Most intelligent and
knowing what they employ
Dr. Pierce believes they have a perfect right to INSIST
upon such knowledge. So he publishes, broadcast and
on each bottle-wrapper, what his medicines arc made
of and verifies it under oath. This he feels he can well
afford to do because the more the Ingredients of which
ills medicines are made are studied and understood tho
more will their superior curative virtues be appreciated.
For the cure of woman's peculiar weaknesses and derangements, giving rise to frequent
headache, backache, dragging-down pain or distress and kindred symptoms of weakness,
Dr. Pierce s Favorite Prescription is a most efficient remedy. It is equally effective in
giving strength to nursing mothers and in preparing the system of the expectant mother
for baby s coming, thus rendering childbirth safe and comparatively painless. The "Fa
vorite Prescription" is a moat potent, strengthening tonic to the general system and to
the organs distinctly feminine in particular. It is also a soothing and invigorating nerv
ine and cures nervous exhaustion, nervous prostation, neuralgia, hysteria, spasms, chorea
. ui, t ii.ua suauLs, uuu uiucr uibtressing nervous symptoms
and organic diseases of the distinctly feminine organs.

substitute is made of, but you don't and it is decidedly for your interest that yon should

To him its only a difference of profit. Therefore, insist on having Dr. Pierce's Fa

Cured by Stuart's njgncnila
Tllllit'tH.
A New Discovery, but Not ft Patent
JloOlelne.
Dr. Rcdwell relates nn Interesting
account of what ho considers a re
mnrkablo enso of ncuto stomach trou
ble and chronic dyspepsia by tho use
of tho now discovery, Stuart's Dyspep
sia Tablets.
Ho says: "Tho patient was a man
who had suffered, to my knowledge,
for years with dyspepsia. Everything
ho ato seemed to sour and create gases
In tho stomach. Ho had pains like
rheumatism In tho back, shoulder
blades and limbs, fullness and distress
after eating, poor appetite and loss of
flesh; tho heart became affected,
causing palpitation und sleeplessness
at night.
"I gavo him powerful nervo tonics
and blood remedies, but to no pur;
pose. As an experiment, I finally
bought a GO-cont packogo of Stuart's
Dyspopsia Tablets at a drug store- and
gavo them to him. Almost Immedi
ate relief wna given and after ho had
used four boxes ho was to all appear
uncos fully cured.
"There was no more acidity or sour
watery risings, no bloating after
meals, the nppctltc was vigorous and
ho has gained between 10 and 12
pounds In uolght of solid, healthy
flosli.
"Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab
lots are advertised and sold In drug
stores, yet I consider them a most
vnluablo addition to any physician's
lino of romcdles, as they aro perfect
ly harmless and can bo given to chil
dren or invalids or In any condition
of tho stomach with perfect safety,
being harmless and containing noth
ing but fruit and vegetable essences,
puro pepsin and Golden Seal.
"Without any question they aro tho
safest, most effective cure for Indiges
tion, biliousness, constipation and all
derangements of tho stomach, how
over slight or Revere."

Gives Out Statement Outlining
History of Case From Inception.
Washington, Dec. 7. The preal
dents nnd other Important officers of
1C companies, comprising tho bath
tub trust, huvo been indicted by tho
federal grand Jury in Detroit for vio
lation of tho Sherman anti-trust law
This, is ono of the biggest hauls, so
far as lndMdu.il prosecutions arc
concerned, that tho department of
Justice ha3 ever mado under the anti
trust law. If vho officers aro convict
ed thoy will bo liable to Jail sen
tences, and tho department undoubt
edly will bend every effort to have
such punishment mctod out Instead
of fines. The 1G companies are also
Indicted as corporations.
The companies In the trust are en
gaged In tho manufacture of sanltar
enamel Ironware, bathtubs, sinks and
other things of a similar character
that enter Into tho .construction of
nearly every house In tho land. Tho
department of Justlco some time ago
brought a civil suit against this com
bination. Tho evidence In thin suit, accord
ing to a statement Issued by tho de
partment, showed that the annual
output of bathtubs and plumbers'
supplies aggregated about 515,000,000
a year; that tho defendants engaged
In the combination fixed prices by
ngrcement and ndvanced prices so
fixed, nnd regulated by agreement
tho prices by which the Jobbers were
permitted to resell tho ptoduetH. The
department charges further that the
combination reftiFcd to sell to Job
bers who would not agree to resell
at the prices fixed by tho combina
tion, nnd also refused to sell to any
Jobber who handled any supplies
manufactured by concerns not In the
trust.
Tho evidence nccordlng to the de
partment's statoment, tended to
show that the defendants knew when
they entered Into this combination
that such an arrangement would bo
unlawful nnd that thoy accordingly
sought for a dovlco behind which
they might conceal tho truo charac
ter of the combination. Tho depart
ment's statement says:
"Tho evidence tended to show that
after they had agreed upon all the
terms nnd conditions nnd upon re
sale prlcca, and the day before final
meeting at which tne agreement was
to be signed, three membora of the
commission assigned certain patents
for tools used In tho manufacture of
tho wnre, through tho promoters ot
tho combination, who borrowed se
curities on which to obtain a loan of
$7,000 by tho oxpendlturo of $6,000
of which ho clulmcd to have ac
quired the patents, and thoroby the
right to control the entire output of
16 manufacturers aggregating mil
lions of dollars annually."
Tho department of Justlco says
further that tho ovldorico shows that
tho manufacturers appointed a com
mittee on the day they entered into
this combination, nnd tljiit this com
mittee, with tho licensor lixed tun

CUMMINS PREPARES
TO REVISE TARIFF
Proposes Amendments to Scnats
Procedure,
Washington, Dec. 7. Itovislon of
the tariff schcduln by schedule is tho
progrnm of tho "Insurgent'"' Republi
can senators. The first step In thnt
direction was -taken when Senator
Cummins of Iowa offorcd n resolu
tion to amend tho senato rules to fa
cilitate tho passago of such legisla
tion through tho senate.
Senator Cummins Introduced a res
olution proposing to amend tho sen
ato proccduro In two Importnnt re
spects. Ho proposes first, that when
any mensuro has been In tho custody
of a senate commltteo for CO daya
without a report, It shall be within
tho power of nny senator to call tho
measuro up for consideration- regard
less of tho commltteo roferonco,
The second amendment proposed
by Mr. Cummins is to limit tho' pow
er of amendment. The effect of tho
now rulo ho proposed would 'bo to
provent nny amendment to a pend
ing tariff bill that did not rolnto sole
ly to tho hubject matter of tho pend
ing moasuro.
If tho mensuro deals with a single
schedule of tariff, no proposed legis

would bo gcrmano.

Notables Dlttemore ' Denounces
Report of Burial In First Church
as Porfect Boah. , t
Boston, Doc. 7. Tho bod1 of iJlnry
Baker G. Eddy will bo, laid nt rest
sonio time tomorrow afternoon In
Mount Auburn cemetery, a fow miles
away from tho homo at Nowton
which had been hers during tho later
yearB of her llfo. Until tho directors
of tho mother church In Boston shall
havo decided upon a suitable lot foi
tho lntermont, Mrs. Eddy's body will
Ho in a receiving vault in tho ceme
tery nftor tho funeral services, which
aro to bo held In tho houso whero
r.ho passed away. Such was tho ten
tative announcement ot tho plans fot
tho funeral by Alfred Farlow, the
representative of tho directors of tho
mother church.
The last earthly honors that aro to
be paid to tho founder nnd loader ot
the Christian Sclenco church aro to
bo In marked contrast to tho almost
impervious hedge of sanctified exclu
sion which Bttrioundcd her in the
last 10 years of her lffo. Upon tho
word of one of tho directors of the
mother church rests tho statement
mndo that "Mrs. Eddy's funeral will
bo no different from that of nny of
us in hor station in llfo who should
pass away. There Is to bo no mys
tery, no secrecy; only tho utmost
simplicity."
Tho founder of tho sect which now
numbers moro than 2,000,000 devo
tees will Ho In hor final sloop among
a noted company. Mount Auburn,
ono of tho most noted homes of tho
dead In tho country, was consecrated
In 1831, and there Ho tho bones of
such as James Russell Lowell, Henry
W. Longfellow, from whoso works
there aro such frequent quotations In
"Sclonco and Health;" Oliver Wen
dell Holmes, Phillip Brooks, tho
noted clergymnn; Charlotte Cush
man, Edwin Booth, Charles Sumner,
Louis Agnsslz. Robert C. WInthrop
and Mrs. James Parton,
Tho funeral services, which aro to
bo conducted by Judgo Clifford P.
Smith, first reader of tho mother
church, will be lead by tlio sido of
tho ensket In tho dim parlor of tho
houso at Nowton at 11 o'clock to
morrow morning. There will not bo
moro thnn 25 or 30 present, and
these will bo tho members of tho
board of directors nnd of tho Eddy
"household" nt tho Newton mansion.
Georgo W. Glover, Mrs. Eddy's only
surviving son, and Eben Kostor
Eddy, Mrs. Eddy's ndoptcd son, who
lives in Wnterbury, will bo there.
Immediately ufter pio funeral ser
vices, which are to bo brief and of
tho greatest simplicity, n small fu
neral cortege will start from tho
Eddy mansion In Nowton to Mount
Auburn cemetery, which lies nbout
five miles north, between Cambridge
and Watortown. Thero will bo no
eorvlces at tho rccolvlng vnult. Bo
foro sundown all of tho symbols of
parting will havo been exomnHfled
and tho Iron doors of tho vnult will
be scaled upon the remains ot a mas
terful character.
John V. Dlttemore, ono of tho
board of trustcos of tho mother
church and incumbent ot tho office ot
clork of the church, broke silence to
refuto various rumors concerning the
final disposition to bo mado of Mrs.
Eddy's remains, which seem to hao
displeased tho present rulors of tho
sect. When a reporter visited Mr.
Dlttemore In his office In tho church
building, ho said that ho wished to
lay emphasis on certain statements
touching on the funeral.
"Tho report that Mrs. Eddy Is to
bo burled In a secret crypt under tho
First church, which acorns to havo
been disseminated by a nowH asso
ciation, Is porfect bosh," said Mr.
Dlttemore. "There Is nothing sensa
tional or mystorlous about Christian
Sclonco or about tho First church In
Boston. A visit to tho church will
show nny obsorver that everything is
brightness and light In tho church.
Wo don't purpose to bury nny bodlea
under tho floor. Wo Christian Sci
entists try to got away from tho su
perstitions entertained by other re
ligionists. There will bo nothing
about Mrs. Eddy's funoml to attract
attontlon by pomp or by secrecy;
nothing to suggest mystory."
Lator Mr. Fulow asked tho nows
paper representatives to publish tho
request of thoao In chargo of the
funoral arrangements that no floral

always held that blossoms were to
