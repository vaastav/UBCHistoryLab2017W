ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ
Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For

ing Topics Discussed--Has
Little to Say About Tariff.
Washington, Dec. 6. Economy in
government affairs is the keynote of
President Taft's annual message read
before both houses of congress today.
The message approximates 40,000
words and is one of the longest ever
submitted by a president.
Conservation of the public domain,
Bhip subsidy, fortification of the Pana
ma canal and the continuation of the
present tariff board are the leading
subjects touched upon. He also re
views the work of the various gov
ernment departments and concurs in
recommendation, tending toward the
bettering of the service, made by sev
eral of the members of his cabinet.
Economy Is Urged.

Wants Forest Limitation Removed.
On the subject of conservation lie de
votes considerable space to forest, coal,
oil and gas. phosphate lands anil water
power sites. As to the reservation of
foieM lands he says: "The law now pro
hibits the reservation of any more forest
lands in Oregon. Washington. Idaho.

by act of congress. I nm informed by the

The president urges such action as he
believe, will Increase American trade

tion unable to avail in international mari
time business of this great contribution to
the means of the world's commercial In
tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff.
In the space devoted to the tariff the
president says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty In
the Payne tariff act have been subjected
to a great deal of criticism, some of It
just, more of It unfounded, and too much
misrepresentation. The act wa3 adopted
In pursuance of a declaration by tho par
ty which is responsible for It that cus
toms bill should be a tariff for the pro
tection of home Industries, the measure
of the protection to lie the difference be
tween the cost Vif producing the Imported,
article abroad and the cost of producing
It at home, together with such addition to
that difference, as might give a reasonable
profit to the home producer. The basis
for the criticism of this tariff is that in
respect to a number of the schedules tho
declared measure was not followed, but a
higher difference retained or Inserted by
way of undue discrimination In favor of
certain Industrie and manufactures. Lit
tle. If any. of the criticism of the tariff
has lieen directed against the protective
principle above statnl; hut the main body
of the criticism has been based on the at
tempt to conform to the measure of pro
tection was not honestly and sincerely
adhered to."
The president also refers to the appoint
ment of a board of experts to Investigate
the cost of production of various articles
int hided in the schedules, of tlse tariff,
and concludes:
"Whether or not the protective policy Is
t'l be (ontiniieil. and the degree of protec
tion to be accorded to our home Indus
tries, are questions which the people must
decide through their chosen representa
tives. Hut whatever pulley is adopted, it
is cjeir that the necessary legislation
:-lonld lie hasetl on an lmiiartl.il. thor
ough and continuous studv of the facts."
Recommends Parcels Post.
The adoption of tli parcels post Is
again adopted. On tills subject President
Taft says: "With respect to the parcels
post. I respectfully recommend lis adop
tion on all rural delivery routes, and that
II pounds-tln international limit be
made the limit of carriage In such post.
The same argument is made against the
parcels post that was made against the
postal savings bank- that It is Introduc
ing the government Into a business wh!cl:
should tie conducted by private persons
nnd is paternalism. The postofllce depart
ment has a great plant and a great or
ganization, reaching Into the most rpinuN
hamlet of the I'nlted States, and with
this machinery it Is able to do a great
manv things economically that If a new
organisation were mtvssary it would Ua
impossible to do without extravagant ex
penditures." Department of Justice.
Discussing the affairs of the department
of justice, the president says:
"I Invite especial attention to tli prose
cutions under the federal law of the so
called 'bucket .shops.' and of thos
.schemes to defraud In which the use of
the mail Is an essential part of the
fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which
have kavt-d ignorant and weak members
of the public and are saving them hun
dreds of millions of dollars. The viola
tions of the anti-trust law present per
haps the most Important litigation b--for
the department, and the number of cases
Hied shows the activity of the govern
ment in enforcing that statute.
"In a special message last vear T
brought to the attention of congress the
propriety and wisdom of enacting a gen
eral law providing for the Incorporation
of industrial and other companies engaged
In interstate commerce, and I renpw my
lecommendatlon in that behalf."
Th crying need In the I'nlted States
of cheapening the cost of litigation by
simplifying Judicial procedure and ex
pediting final judgment Is pointed out and
action looking to correction of these evils
is urged.
The prerldcnt recommends an increase
In tli" salaries of federal Judges.
Postal Affairs.
In regard to postal matters the pres
dent points with pride to its present effi
cient management ami the recent reduc
tion In" the deficit. The present unre
stricted franking privilege comes in for
comment with a suggestion for the adop
tion of better tiuthods for its regulation.
Abolish Navy Yards.
The president calls attention to certain
reforms urged by the secretary of the
navv which he recommends for adoption,
and continues;
"The st cretary of the navy has given
pwiir.il i vamlnatlon to every navy yard,
and h:.s studied the uses of the navv
yr.rds with rtforence to the necessities
of our fit et. With a tleet considerably
It ss than half the size of that of the
Hntish navy, we have shipyards: more
than double the number, and thci are
several of these shipyards expensively
equipped with modern mehinory. which,
after Investigation the secretary of the
navy believes to be entirely useless for
naval purposes, lie asks authority to
abandon certain of them ami to move
their machinery to other places, where It
can be made of use."
Speakit.g of our "foreign relations the
president savs- "Purine the past yenr
the foreign relations of the t'nited States
have continued upon a basis of friendship
and gootl understanding.
"The year has Iwoti notable as witness
ing the pacific settlement of two imp r
lant international controversies before the

countries, whose common interest Pes in

relations with each other.
President Taft makes a few recommen
dations lor changes In the Interstate com
merce law and says:
"Kst ept as above. I do nit recommend
any amendment to the int-rstate com
merce law as It stands. I do not invr
recommend any amendment to the anti
trust law. In other words, it seem-: to

It Wss Not Fair.
A fight in a restaurant was caused
by the customer offering to pay for
two fried eggs he had ordered if the
proprietor would eat them. That was
an unfair proposition. A man may
keep a restaurant, but he isn't com
pelled to eat there.

"Why, isn't it always tired?"
