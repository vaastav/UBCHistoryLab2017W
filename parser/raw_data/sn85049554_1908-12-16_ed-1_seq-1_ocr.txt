Caracas, Dec. 16.—Via "Willemstad—
The people 'of Caracas arose today
against Castro. An infuriated mob,
unhindered by the police, swept thru
'the city, wrecking the property of his
henchmen and friends. All statues
and pictures of Castro from the clubs

Martial Law Declared.
Caracas, Dec. 15.—Via Willemstad—
Thes Venezuelan capital yesterday
witnessed an outbreak of disorder, fol
lowing the warlike activities of the
Dutch warships along the roast, that
made it necessary by nightfall, to de
Clare martial law in order to put an
end to the rioting and pillaging. There
were several attacks on private prop
erty on the part of the mob before the
authorities got ithe situation in hand,
and several agitators were arrested.
There was no actual conflict between
the people and the police. No foreign
srs were molested. The city is quiet,
and taking a normdl course-
Further dangerous demonstrations
are anticipated. No official act deposing
Castro from the. presidency has yet
been talcen but such'a step-is expected
it any moment.
Police Do Not Interfere.
Aw enormous crowd of inhabitants
of the capital, swell by people from
the outlying country, gathered in the
streets Soon after daybreak Monday
People began marfching, up and down
the main thoroughfares, and It was
easy to see their ill temper would soon
result in violence. The police stood by
and made no attempt whatever to re
strain the mob.
The first building* to be attacked and
looted was that of the lottery monop
oly. The offices of the enterprise that
has enriched itself at the expense of
the people were ransacked and pil
laged. The furniture was broken and
thrown into the streets and thousands
of lottery tickets destroyed.
Castro's Newspaper Pillaged
The crowd then moved to the print
ing office of El Constltucional, the or
gan of Castro, and pillaged it com
pletely. A steam laundry belonging to
Senor Rlvas, editor of the paper, also
was wrecked. The craiyd then turned
Its attention to se\ _ral drug stores be
longing to the son-in-law of General
Mendoza, who at one time was minis
ter of finance under Castro, and who
Is universally hated by the eaiemies of
Castro.
Statuek and pictures of Castro were
made into a huge bonfire in the public
square and the crowd cheered as the
flames completed the destruction of
these effigies of the dictator. Numer
ous Inscription^ setting forth ~he vir
tues of Ckstro and extolling his pow
ers next attracted the retaliation of the
mob, and every Inscription bearing
Castro's, name was hacked, cut and
erased.
1
The mob lacked leadership and final-
ly when it paused in default of other
fields for its destructive energies a
detachments of troops was called out,
and the acting president, Gomez, Is
sued a manifesto prohibiting further
manifestations. These measures had
the desired effect, for the mob quieted
down and then dispersed. There, were
several fatalities as the result of the
demonstration.

almost won the fight In the first min
ute, when he beat Papko to the ropes
and had the "Illinois thunderbolt"

In the last few rounds Papke seemed
entirely blind, with both eyes appar

THE "NEWS" REPLIES
Answer to President Roosevelt Spe
cial Message on Panama Canal Deal,
Abounds in Satoasm—Scores His
Language, Particularly.
Indianajpolis, Dec. 16.—The Indian
apolis News, mentioned in the special
message on the Panama canal deal,
sent to congress yesterday by Roose
velt, today issued a reply to the chief
executive. It says:
"It is difficult to characterize fully
thes latest outbreak of the president,
without resorting to the use of lan
guage as undignified and 'blameworthy
as that which put the president's ut
terance in a class by Itself in the of
ficial literature of the high office which
he holds."
The News1 states that whether
Roosevelt knows it or not, rumors and
reports touching the Panama transac
tion have been numerous and persist
ent, and that in spite of all his assev
erations, the people still are not con
vinced that everything was as it should
have been, this without in the least
impugning the good faith of the presi
dent or his agents in the negotiations.
The News said that many points have
not been cleared up, and they can not
•be cleared up hy threats of libel suits
and pen lashings of editors that hold
the good name and interests of our
country quite as dear as does the pres
ident. The paper, In concluding its
statement, says that the Ralney reso
lution should be adopted, and that
congress should make a searching in
vestigation of all facts, circumstances,
and rumors connected with, the Pana
ma activities of the government.

Senator Lodge Upholds Presi
dent's Action in Dismissing
Negro Soldiers
CONDEMNS THE FORAKER BILL
Lodge Favors Passage of Measure De
sired by Roosevelt and Permitting
Reinstatement of Negroes Proved
Innocent of Complicity—The Wash­
ington News.
Washington, Dec. 16.—Discussion of
the Brownsville affair and preliminary
action looking- toward a censure for
President Roosevelt because of his ut
terances in his message criticizing
congress for its action in curtailing
the work of the secret service, were
important features of the day's work
in the senate.
Without discussion, the senate
adopted Foraker's resolution calling on
the secretary of w^r for various in
formation concerning the employmentj
of detectives for use in tho Browns
ville affair. The Brownsville affair wasj
discussed in the senate today by Lodge,
who remarked that he would make no
reference whatever to the report of the
This, he said, was also the conclu
sion of the citizens'. ^committee ..of,
Brownsville, and. of the Penrose court
martial. Xt was also the opinion of
a decisive majority of the senate com
mittee on military affairs
"The proposition," he said, "declar
ing that '{he weight of the testimony
shows that none of the soldiers of the
Twenty-fifth United States infantry
participated in the shooting affray,',
was rejected by a vote of 11 to 2 and
the proposition that, in the opinion of
the committee, the shooting was done
by some soldiers belonging to tha
Twenty-fifth infantry was adopted by
a vote of 8 to 4, one senator not vot
ing. Thus it will be seen that every
official 'body which has heard the testi
mony has decided that the shooting
at Brownsville on the night of the 13th
of August, 1906, was the work of sol
diers of the Twenty-fifth infantry."
Mr. Lodge declared that while therej
is a great deal of evidence that the
shooting was done by the soldiers there
Is no evidence whatever that It was 1
done .by anybody else. There is, he said,
no physical impossibility of time, dis
tance or alibi to prevent our attribut
ing the shooting to the soldiers.
Self-selected champions of these sol
'diers in various parts of the country
sought, he said, not for equality before
the law, but for special treatment fop
the Brownsville soldiers on the ground
of race. "As a friend of the negro race
I deplore the agitation which had th^s
end In view," he said, "these soldiers
are entitled to the same treatment as
soldiers and citizens that white men
would be entitled to, neither more nor
less." He deplored any appeal to sym
pathy for criminals, which 'he said has
become the fashion of the time.
He favored the Warner 'bill which al
lows the president to restore the inno
cent to the army whenever he is satis
fied that any of them were blameless.
He condemned the Foraker bill which
he said attempts to force iback Into the
army not only Innocent men but men
who were guilty of a serious crime. He
made an exhaustive argument on the
unconstitutionality of the Foraker bill
which obliges the president to re-enllst
these soldiers whether he thinks they
ought to be re-enlisted or not. Such
an act would be an encroachment up
on the constitutional rights of the
president. It would be subversive of
discipline in the army.
Senate Gets Secret Service Resolution.
Washington, Dec. 16.—Senator Aid
rich today introduced a resolution di
recting the committee on appropria
tions to consider that portion of the

tional clause suggested by Culbertson
that the committee be required to re
port "What action, if any, the senate
should take with reference to the mes
sage."

IOWA HAS NO STATE BANNER

Attention of Officials by Request of
American Consul at Shanghai—Social
Life of Assembly Session to Be
•V
Lively.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 16.—Wanted—A
state flag and a new state seal, for the
state of Iowa.
Attention of the legislature Is called
to this.urgent want. Tho state has no
flag and the official state seal Is worn
out and is declared to be inappropriate
and old fogeyish.
The matter of the shortcoming of
the state as to a flag came up on re
ceipt by Governor Garst of a polite
request from Charles Denby, American
consul general at Shanghai, for a state
flag of Iowa to be the property of the
American company of the Shanghai
Volunteer corps. Mr. Denby explains
that the American company Is a body
of sixty American citizens resident
in Shanghai, constituting a unit in the
volunteer corps, a military organization
composed of companies of various na
tionalities organized for the protection
of the foreign settlement in Shanghai.
The company Is armed with American
army rifles, supplied with ammunition
from the war department at Washing
ton, and drills according to the Am
erican army manual. The Iowa flag
W desired for use on ceremonial occa
sions, and particularly to be used at
the annual ball on Washington's
birthday. The request is for an Iowa
flag and also a facsimile of the Iowa
coat of arms on canvas.
Of bourse none caji be sent, for Iowa
has no flag. Minnesota and the older
stated all have state flags, but Iowa
bas none.
It has been suggested that the mat
ter be put up to the legislature, and
thfe committee or commission having
this in charge might also take up the
season beginning in January than ever
"of fere becau of the extra functlDn?
expected. It will be the first tirr.e
the history of the state that the visit
ing legislative ladies will have the op
portunity to meet two governors' wives.
When the legislature first convenes
Mrs. Warren Garst will be the first
lady of the state and will probably, ac
cording to long established customs,
hold an open home reception for the
visiting ladies. Mrs. Garst will also
hold a conspicuous place In the recep
tion given following the inauguration
of B. F. Carroll. Then she will sur
render her title to Mrs. B. F. Carroll.
Mr. Carroll will be Inaugurated Jan.
14. Then the legislative ladies will
have the pleasure of meeting and
knowing the second governor's wife
within a month.
The social feature of the Iowa legis
lature has rapidly grown. Already
many of the legislators are securing
apartments for their family for the
entire session. The hotels have made
numerous reservations for senators and
representatives "who expect to bring
their wives to the Thirty-third general
assembly.
Six million dollars is the value of

further spread of the disease was the
object of a meeting of Des Moines
physicians and members of the board

week to sue the Pullman company for
$74,015 filing fee and huge penalties
for failure to file articles of Incorpora
tion.
The Pullman company has been
operating sleeping cars in Iowa ever
since they v/ere Invented. The attor
ney general has discovered that it has
never filed articles of Incorporation
with the secretary of state. Under the
Iowa law, such a corporation, it Is
claimed. Is required to file articles
with tho secretary of state.
Its capital stock Is now $70,000,000.
The Iowa lax fixes a fee of $1 a thou
sand on the capital stock for a filing
foe when the articles are filed with
the secretary of state. Therefore the
company, it is claimed, owes the public
treasury $70,000, and it costs $15 to
record tho Articles, which makes the
total claim on this account $75,015.
In addition the Iowa law provides
that when a corporation falls to file
its articles of incorporation with the
secretary of state It becomes subject
to a penalty of $100 a day for each
day until it does so, if it does business
