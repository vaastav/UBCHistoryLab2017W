A GOOD MAN GONE.
Sudden Death of Caleb Mead, of Cale
donia. From the Corunnu Journal:
The people ot our city and vicinity were
greatly shocked on Monday evening, on
learning of the death of Caleb Mead, a well
known farmer of Caledonia township, and
who resided a short distance north of tins
city. lie waa in (own ou Monday of last
week, appajHitlj in his usual health, greet
ing cordially tluse ol I. is friends whom he
happened to meet. and just a week liom that
day he had gone to Ms last home.
Mr. Mead was t.iken with a severe colli
which soon developed into typhoid pneumo
nia. Everything that kind hands and
medical treatiut nt could do was done, but
all proved of no avail, and he gradually
passed avay at five o'clock in the afternoon
of Monday last, surrounded by his sorrow
stricken family, lie leaves a widow and
ten children, one son and nine daughters.
The sou and the eldest three daughters are
married, leaving six children at home.
The funeral services were held yesterday
at the Free Methodist church, Rev. W. G.
Nixon officiating. The'church was inade
quate to hold the large number of old
friends and neighbors who gathered to pay a
last tribute of respect to one whom they had
known and honored. II. F. Wallace Tost
G. A. R., of which he was a member, at
tended the services in a body and at the
grave used its beautiful ritual service. A
handsome wreath from the Tost and a floral
lyre fro in Corunua friends, were silent
emblems of the esteem of bis intimate
friends.
Mr. Mead was sixty years of age, and
came to ibis county in the early fifties, and
bad by honest toil procured and cleared a
farm.making for himself and family a pleas
ant home, lie was a man of genial nature
and of the strictest integrity. He possessed
a large heart and wou'd, if be could, have
relieved all the suffering he knew of, and
bis many acts in this direction will long be
remembered by the many whom he has aid
ed. In politics be was a republican of the
eUl wait sort, but would never vote for a
man simply because he was on his ticket,
but would always bolt an unworthy candl
date, lie never aspired to office himself,
but was persistent in the fight for good men
for public positions. IBs death is a great
loss to the community and a greater one to
the family, who have the earnest sy mpathy
of all in their sad bereavement.
It is often a mystery how a cold has been
'caught" The fact is, however, that when
the blood is poor and the system depressed,
one becomes peculiary liable to diseases.

WAS NOT REAL RECIPROCITY.
Which Is Why German VeMsels Will Now
Have To l'uy 1'ort Dues.
Washington, Dec. 4. The president
yesterday Issued a proclamation the ef
fect of which is to relmpose upon the
vessels entering from Germany the
same tonnago dues that are Imposed on
vessels entering the United States from
Great Britain, France, Italy, Spain and
other maritime nations in Europe and
Asia. Ge rman vesels were excepted In
1888 from the payment of the dues un
der the shipping reciprocity act of 188C.
During the past year, at the request
of the treasury department, the state
department has made a full Investiga
tion into the charges Imposed upon
American vessels in German ports, and
the fact has been developed that while
the imperial government does not im
pose taxes on shipping, yet the govern
ments of the German maritime taxes,
for years have imposed shipping taxes,
bo that there was no real reciprocity.

Fpprv Action in tl.i; C .ibun Cute and De
funds Hit) V..on Hill,
"Washington, Dec. 8. With crowded
galleries the Henatora and representa
tives of the United States came to order
today at noon for tha last session of tha
Fifty-fourth congress. In the senate
there was but one order of business
the readlngof the president's message,
which took nearly two hours. At Its con
clusion the senate adjourned. In the
house the message was also read and
the death of ex-Speaker Crisp was an
nounced and a resolution of regret was
adopted, after which the house also ad
journed. The president's message begins with
felicitating the country on the fact that
a very exciting election has passed
peacefully, clearly demonstrating the
permanence of our Institutions. He
then deplores the fact that the Turk
Is still allowed by Europe to butcher
and rob Christians, but hopes for better
things in that regard - and says the
claims of Americans who have been
despoiled by Moslems will be pushed,
although the porte has not admitted
their Justice.
With reference to Cuba he says the
rebels have not the 'shadow of a civil
government, and that the fact probably
is that they never have had except on
paper; that as things stand now the
proper position, in honor, of the United
States, is one of strict neutrality, but
Intimates that a time may come when
In the highest interests of humanity
the United States should Intervene. He
has offered that if Spain would grant
reforms before the rebels lay down
their arms to make an effort to guar
antee their acceptance as a finish of the
war. In passing he utters the Monroe
doctrine sentiment that no other gov
ernment must interfere In the matter.
He devotes a large portion of his
message to the defense of the Wilson
tariff bill, which he says will, if given a
fair chance which circumstances have
bo far denied it produce all the reve
nue the government needs, and gives
figures In support of his claim. With
reference to currency reform he has
one principal remedy and that is the
absolute retirement and cancellation of
all government currency that can be
used to deplete the treasury reserve.
The best plan to do this, he believes, is
to fund the notes.
The message has only a paragraph of
a congratulatory nature about the
Venezuela case, and then covers the
reports of all the departments, referring
to the navy, the army, coast defense,
penslons.etc. Of pensions he says he
has endeavored within his sphere to
protect the pension roll and make it
what it should be a roll of honor.
COMPTROLLER ECKLES' ANNUAL
Recommendations 31 ado for Changes In
the National Hanking Law, -
Washington, Dec. 9. In his annual
report, which was given out yesterday,
Comptroller of the Currency Eckels
suggests ten amendments to the na
tional banking law, among which are
the following: That loans and discounts
of banks to the executive officers and
employes be-restricted in amount and
secured by proper collateral; that no
loan be made to a director not an exe
cutive officer of the bank, except upon
collateral security or a satisfactorily
indorsed note; that directors be re
quired to make an examination of their
bank once each year upon a day to
be designated by the comptroller.
That in places having a population of
less than 2,000 inhabitants national
banks shall be permitted under regula
tions to be made by the comptroller of
the currency and approved by the sec
retary of the treasury, to be organized
with a capital stock of not less than
$25,000, and with a corresponding re
duction in the amount of bonds required
to be deposited with the treasurer of the
United States. That national banks be
permitted under proper regulations to
established branch banks in towns and
villages where no national bank is es
tablished, and where the population
does not exceed 1,000 inhabitants; such
branch banks in no case to be permitted
to issue circulating notes other than
of the parent bank. That the semi
annual tax on circulation be reduced
to one-fourth of 1 per cent., and that
the issue of circulating notes to the par
value of the bonds deposited be per
mitted. uigures are given snowing the cost
to the United States of maintaining
the legal tenders, and the difference in
such cost if the notes had been con
verted to 4 per cent, bonds, which dif
ference is shown to b $339,081,222. With
this cost is compared the profit to the
government on account of the national
banks, which has been 157.439,218.
MACEO KILLED AGAIN. .
Or IClse the SimnisW Authorities Have
Mado Another Mlttnko
, Havana, Dec. 9. TCopyrlght, 1896, by
the Associated Press. It is stated in
most positive terms by tho Spanish au
thorities that Antonio Maceo, the great
insurgent leader and the heart and soul
of the Cuban cause, has been killed
in Havana province after having ef
fected the passage of the western trocha
near Marlel, at its northern extremity.
With the Cuban leader died the youth
Francisco Gomez, son of Maximo
Gomez, who accompanied the mulatto
general on his passage of the trocha.
Most explicit details of the finding of
the corpses of the fallen Cubans and
of the facts relied upen for their
identification are at hand through the
report of the Spanish commander,
Major Clrujeda, who contested the
passage of the trocha unsuccessfully
on Dec 4 (last Friday), with Maceo,
and who sustained another conflict on
Monday with the forces under the in
surgent leader.

In tho villages. Tho land for fcuch model
gardens, or farms on u email scalo, was
mostly obtained through free grants from
