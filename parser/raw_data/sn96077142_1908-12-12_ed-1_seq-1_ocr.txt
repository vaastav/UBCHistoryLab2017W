MANY SOCIAL EVENTS.
Cay Society Will Mot Want for
Amusement Daring Holidays.
Judging from the number of posters
which have been turned out of this of
fice during the 'present week, gay soci
ety will not be wanting in any respect
for amusement during the holiday time.
Beginning with New Year's Eve,
Meadow Brook Hive, No. 654, Ladies of
the Modern Maccabees, will entertain
in the L'Anse Opera House. As was
stated in last week's issue, the commit
tee on arrangements ale sparing no
time or efforts to make this event one
which will remain in the memory of
those who attend as a lasting thought.
The engagement of the services of the
celebrated Calumet & Hecla orchestra,
coupled with the past record of the hive
as entertainers, should warrant a liber
al patronage.
The evening following, January 1st,
the public is extended an . invitation to
trip the light fantastic with the mem
bers of the Fire Department of our sis
ter town. Baraga Fire Department,
like the Lady Maccabees of L'Anse,
are the proud possessors of a high rep
utation as promoters of jthings that are
good socially.
The department has a reputation
which warrants them a crowded ball
room, as the committee in charge is
making every effort possible to outt o
all previous affairs in this line. The
Baraga orchestra, of five pieces, wi 1
furnish music for the occasion and wi 1
no doubt give the same if not better
satisfaction this time as in the past.
On Friday, January 8th, comes the
jolly night. Upon this date falls the
Masquerade ball, given in Baraga Op
era House. Here is where those who
like to be something else besides them
selves may go and give their friends
the laugh. The management has ar
ranged to give a liberal purse to the
ones having the best costume, also the
ones having the most comical. Mas
querade parties have always been a
success in Bsraga and that this one
will follow in the wake is no conjecture.
A bountiful supper will be given in con
nection with the party at the Chappel
House.
' Cordial invitations are extended by
the committees of all to everyone to at
tend. A Remarkable Gentlemen.
Almost up to the 80-year mark and
still as spry as a cat, is the distinction
which James Burns, the well known
cobbier and citizen of Baraga, enjoys
today.
Tuesday The, Sentinel enjoyed a
visit from this interesting gentleman
and when questioned how he came from
Baraga to L'Anse, remarked, "Whyl
my land, I walked, and if it were nec
essary to do so, would do the same
from here to Houghton."
In his early day Mr. Burns was an
athlete of no common order, and it can
be easily recalled in the minds of many
people around this section when he
would, even in his gray haired years,
take active part in Fourth of July and
Labor Day sports, and carried off hon
ors. As a Roosevertan policy maintainer
he has carried off honors, but as our
memory fails to serve us with accuracy,
we will not endeavor to give the num
ber of his offsprings. He is apparent
ly as hale and hearty as in younger
days and promises fair to see many
years of this life yet.
Announcement is given that L'Anse
High School will close for the Christ
mas holidays, Wednesday afternoon
Dec. 23, with appropriate exercises in
the various departments, and resume
Monday, January 4, 1909.

Handsome Calendars.
This is the season of calendars and
not a few very handsome ones are be
ing distributed this year. We, like
many others, were the recipients of one
from the Pioneer Cigar. Factory, of
Baraga, and congratulate Mr. Falk,
the proprietor, upon his selection. The
subject of the art portion is entitled
"A Twentieth Century Hold-up. " The
whole is a masterpiece of lithograph
ers' and engravers' art.
Another one which is being distribut
ed by our local cigar manufacturer, A
B. Comee, is perhaps one of the most
beautiful art designs which will appear
this season. The art portion of Mr.
Comee s calendars is done in a combin
ation of high and attractive colors and
gaily decoroted with sparkling tinsel.
The . subject is without title but rep
resents a child in the act of preparing
her pet kitten for the Christmas fes
tivities. Like the preceding calendars,
these which bespeak for the "Little
Victor" and "King Buck" are works of
high, lithographer's art
Santa Claus Invasion
YOU remember how when a child of perhaps five or six years
you lay in wait for the good old saint every Christmas eve
until someone spoiled it by telling you the cold facts? Those are
pleasant memories, are they not? In the next issue of this paper
Delia Austrian will dig them up for you in this story:
How European Children
Celebrate Christ's Birth
It is a cleverly written article detailing the holiday customs' of the
little folks in Europe which will appeal strongly to both grown-ups
and the children. Elaborately embellished with illustrations made
from both photographs and drawings. Altogether a striking holi-'
day feature. ' ,' - '

the recent snow fall, Joseph Bushey

contract' for the hauling of the last
summer's output of ore from the De
troit Graphite Company's mine to the
Taylor spurr. . While the summer's

ADVERTISING FOR BIDS.
Government Will Attempt to Save 83,
510 Feet of Balsam, Spruce, '
Hemlock and Other
Timber t
Canal.
United States Engineer George H.
Banks ia issuing advertisements for bids
on the cutting of 83,510 feet of timber
belonging to the government on the
burned-over lands on the west side of
the canal abo7e the Lilly pond. The
contract will include the delivery of the
timber to the shore of Lake Superior,
near the government light house.
The engineer estimates that, the
standing trees number 1,065, more or
less, divided as follows:
Balsam and spruce, 177 trees, 6958
feet '
Hemlock, 385 trees, 34,997 feet.
Baas wood, 27 trees, 1,673 feet.
Maple, 278 trees, 19,463 feet.
Birch, 186 trees, 19,666 feet.
White Ash, 12 trees, 753 feet.
Total, 1,065 trees, 83,510 feet
A Doyle scale was used in making
this estimate, and the actual cutting
probably will run above these figures.
The lowest responsible bidder will be
awarded the , contract, and the work
will be done under the usual govern
ment regulations, calling for n eight
hour day, and contractors are warned
beforehand that any failure to comply
with the provisions of the contract will
be at orfce reported to the war depart
ment for such action as that body sees
fit.
The timber land, which forms part of
that which was purchased by the gov
ernment when it took the canal over,
was badly burned over during the for
est fires last fall. Many of the trees
were killed but remained standing, and
it is this timber which the government
now desires to save.
RAILROAD AGENTS NOTIFIED.
By Ruling of Department of Agricul
ture Cattle and Hides Cannot
Be Shipped.
Agents along the route of the
South Shore, as well as others, have
been officially notified of a ruling of the
Department of Agriculture, whereby
the state of Michigan is quarantined
against shipping and receiving cattle,
hides or skins. , The notification states
that exportation and importation of the
above will not be permitted, and except
within the borders of Michigan no ship
ments will be taken.
This is the direct result of the recent
hoof and mouth disease discovered in
Michigan cattle and with a view of
protecting against the contagion, the
laws were effected.
In various places dealers in hides
have applied for shipping bills but were
immediately notified that such goods
could not be accepted by the railroads.
Anton Wendell Dead.
Friday morning L'Ansj frjends o'
Anton Wendell, one of Hancock's
prominent businessmen, were greatly
shocked to learn that he had passed to
eternal rest at 2 o'clock.
Mr. Wendell has been associated
with the business circles of the copper
country since early boyhood and was
conducting a profitable business at the
time of his death, in the city of Han
cock. His death is attributed to heart
trouble. He is survived by a wife, twe
daughters and one son, and a sister,
Mrs. John Sterk, of this village. "
Deceased was a prominent member
of Hancock Lodge of Elks, and Modern
Woodmen of America. Funeral serv
ices will be held tomorrow at 2 p. m.
fronrthe residence.
OBJECTED TO CAPTAIN.
Employees of Imperial Mine Desired
Removal of Captain Harry Marks.
Because the Cleveland Cliffs Iron
company would not discharge Captain
Harry Marks, of the Imperial mfne,
west of Michigamme, some forty or
more of the workmen walked out Sat
urday last The men and the captain
had some sort of a disagreement and
the latter considered that they were
not benig fairly dealt with, but it would
seem from the action of the officials,
who upheld the captain, that the men's
grievance was not justified. Monday
orders were received to close down the
west shaft for. the winter, discharging
about fifty-five of the men. This leaves
the strikers free to apply elsewhere for
employment They- received ' their
checks Monday evening. The remain
der of the force, thirty-five or forty
men, will be retained at the east shaft,
which will be operated throughout the
winter. -.
