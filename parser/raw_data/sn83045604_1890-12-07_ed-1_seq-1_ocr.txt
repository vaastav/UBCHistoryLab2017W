THE IRISH PARTY SPUT.
Anti-Parnell Members Walk
Oat of the Meeting*
GLADSTONE CRIES "THANK GOD*'
Parnell in a Rasre—Tim Healy a
"A Dirty Little Coward."
Tim Had Inanlted Mr a. O'Shea—The Un
ernwnrd King Han a Miserable Rem
nant, While McCarthy and the Reat
Are Allied to Liberals.
LOTTDO!!, Dec. ft—[New Yortc Herald
Cable.]— There was terrific fighting among
the Nationalists today, and at one time
nearly cu nunated in personal encounters.
The anti-Parneilites woke up this morning
to the conviction that they had been
greatly tooled during the week, especially
in the bogus negotiations with Gladstone,
so adroitly sot on foot by Parnell; conse-
they went to room No. 15, in a
highlj belligerent spirit. They were re
solved to make an end of Parnell's leader
ship at all cosrs. Parnell was prepared
for extremities, and, as events showed,
outmastered his opponents in daring, and
remains in possession of the field, though
wish reduced forces.
A leading article in the Star says: The
situation looks bad. The Nationalist party
can be saved on one condition. Instead of
the Irish members of parliament talking of
resigning in a body, let them cashier Par
nell. Gladstone received the Irish
delegates with touching, fatherly
kindness and courtesy. Their
answer will recall the party to the vital
qiestion that home rule must not be preju
uiced by Parnell's retention. As soon as a
new leader is appointed he would be pre
pared to treat with bim. The home rule
movement would tben proceed as if it
never received the smallest check.
THE FINAL QUARREL.
Parnell's Opponents, L«d by McCarthy,
LMT« thn Minority.
LONDOH, Dec. 6.—The Irish members of
parliament reassembled this afternoon, the
deliberations being conducted with ex ra
precautions for secrecv. Tue first business
trrnsacted was tne reading of Gladstone'*
latter in reply to the committee. G.adstone
remains firm in his determination to in no
way recognize Parnell as the leader of the
Nationalists, and his position was empha
sised by the letter, in which be offers to
conduct negotiations with the new Irish
leaders on a footing of confidence equal to
that which be once accorded to Parnell.
l'he reading of tbe letter was greeted with
cheers by the section ol tbe party opposing
Parnell, and with ironical cries by his sap
) Orters.
A stormy debate followed. Barry, Bexton
and Healy made a determined attempt to
bring about a tinal settlement of the ques
tion. T iey insisted that there bean imme
diate division of the members on tbe main
question before the meeting, namdy, the
r-iireruent of Parnell from the leadership.
Finally 8 xton gave Parnell his ultima
tum, to tbe effect that if a decision on the
qu ration were delayed by Parnell after 6
u'eock this evening the majority would
hold a meeting of their own and depose
uim from the oftice. A scene of great ex
citement followed. At 2:45 o'clock a reeess
was taken for half an hour.
When tne meeting reassembled the re
port of the conferring delegates was read
at length. Mr. Abraham and John O'Con
nor rose from their seats simultaneously,
when Parnell declared that the latter had
hr! floor. Abraham persisted in an effort
to move a resolution, but could not amid
the clamor. He then handed it to Justin
McCarthy, who rose from his seat and was
apparently about to read it when Parneli
grasped the resolution from his band, say
ing he would not receive it. A tremendous
uproar followed, and when quiet was re
stored Parnell raid that until the party de
posed him he would remain chairman.
Barry retorted: "You are notour chair
iHan," and added that Parnell was "a
dirty trickster," which caused another up
roar.
Arthur O'Connor appealed to his friends
to show ever possible respect to their late
leader.
McCarthy said he had only risen to a
point of order. S,>me one banded him the
puper and the chairman struck it outof his
land.
Parnell said he took it from McCarthy,
but the latter insisted that the paper was
struck from his hand.
Healy moved that Abraham's motion be
heard, but Parnell refused.
John O'Connor tnen moved that the
meeting call the attention of the
country to the fact that though
the orieinal resolution was altered
to meet Gladstone's obj ction, he sti.l re
fises toconter with the party unless Parnell
is removed. Tuis, he said, proved Par
nell's contention that it was impossible to
tret a direct answer from Gladstone. He
believed Ireland would resent tnis.
Timothy Healv caused another tremend
ous row by shouting: "Who is to be the
inismsiof the party?"
Cries of "sh<«me n came from all parts of
the room, and Parnell referred to Heaiy
as a "cowardly little scoundrel, who dared
in an asscaioly of Irishmen to insuit a
man."
Abraham got the floor and said that
since Parnell refu-ed to resign, the mem
bers wou d be wanting iti respect to them
selves if they longer detaved bringing mat
ters to an t*su», the chairman having igno
miniousiy treaieu and torn McCarthy's
resolution. .
Paruell—That's untiue.
Abraham decl ned to enter into an alter
cation. bu repeated that it would be
shameful to allojw a minority to continue
making the party a laughing ■ ock. He
proposed as an amendment that Parne.l's
chairmanship should be terminated. An
other squabifie ensued, and Parnell de
emed that Abraham was out of order,
whereupon Healy shouted "Bravo."
• Ilea y," said Parnei , *1 won't aii-ni ma h
mo-c fr t in you. An amen insert u oniy ad
rnis >b: - as H hubsinutive mo ion."
Art bur O'Connor proceeded atr.ii uproar
t > argue that the tune had'arrived to cea-e
t.wKiugand put an end ton hat was rajidiy
becoming a disgrace ul taree. "i a k tue
majority of this pirtv," he concluded, "at
once to record uieir uec.s.on. If not here,
tben else.vhere."
Parae snow it i« not an amendment.
Jus in Met arthv took the fl >or. He bad
hoi*»d up to last nignt that Parnell would
still he.p tbem out of their terrible aith
culty. lie was disappointed, and it woud
oe a waste of time to discuss tbe matter
Inrthe-. He suggested that ail agreeing
with him withuraw.
Justin Huntley McCarthy followed the
majority, saying be was sorry tor the de
cision, but must go with them.
Parnell was left in the room with John
and William Redmond, Leamy, O'Kelly,
Byrne. Blaine, Corbett and Joseph Nolan,
Msguire, Harrison, Daiton, William Mo-
Donald, Conway. Quinn, Clancy, Mabony,
Haycien, Fitzgerald, Harrington, Richard
Power, Sheil, Camnbell, John O'Connor,
Dr. Kenny and McKenna, and the meeting
waa resumed.
Colonel Nolan argued that the Farnell
ites would hold the key to the position,
and concluded by saying tbat whatever
Parnell's position in the next two or t&ree
years be would be ranked with O'Connell
as ihe greatest Irishman of the last three
centuries. [Cheers].
Others having spoken, Parnell said:
The deserters, knowing Wi were going to Ire
land tomorrow, cixm >rei for a decision became
they dreaded the lightning of pubtx opinion in
Ireland, Gentlemen, we hare won today.
[.Loud cheer*.] Although our ranks are re

John O'Connor's resolution was then put,
and carried by acclamation, and the meet
ing dispersed.
The proceedings of the McCarthy section
were conducted in private. They elected
Justin McCarthy president by a unani
mous vote, and proceeded to consider the
following resolution:
We, th * members of the Irish parliamentary
party, solemnly renew our adhesion to a princi
ple in devotion to which we have
wavered, that tne Irish party fs and alw*ys
must remain independent of all other parties.
Fur her, we declare that we will never enter
tain any proposals for the settlement of the
home rule question, except such as satisfies the
asp> radons of the Irish party and the Irish
people.
The resolution, which was proposed by
Healv and seconded by Sexton, was
unanimously adopted. The result was im
mediately communicated to Gladstone.
Upon learning what had been done,
Gladstone exclaimed: "Thank God!
Home rule is saved."
GLADSTONE'S LETTER.
He Will Be Glad to Kcncw His Farmer
Relation* With the Nationeliat*.
DiC. 6.—Gladstone in Lis letter
to the Nationalist meeting acknowledges
the receipt of the two resolutions adopted
by the Irish caucus, and says, in part, that
the question raised by the publication of
his letter to Morley was a question of
leadership, which is separate and has no
proper connection with home rute. He
continues :
When the Irish party has settled this ques
tion in such a manner as will enable me to re
new my form r relations with tne party it
will be my desire to enter without prijudice
into confidential communication as oc aaion
may sirve, upon all amendments and sugges
tions of improvement in my plan for home rial*
measures. I assure you It is my desire to press
for war J, at tbe first favorable opportunity, a
ju-t and effective measure for home
rule. I reC'Wime and earnest y seek
to uphold the independent of the Irish party
no less than that of tbe Liberal party, and
acknowledge with satisfaction the harmony
prevailing between th parties since 1886. When
the preseutdifficulty is removed I kuow no rea
son to anticipate its interruption. I look for
ward with confidence, as do my to
the furmatloa and prosecution of a measure
Which, in meetingn«sk j jus: cla ms of Ir land,
will likewise obtaiu the appr val of the
people of Great Britain. Finally, I
will remind yon of my declaration
that, apart from personal confidence, there is
but one guarantee that can b of real value to
Ireland: It Is that recently pMn.ed out by
Hareourt when he called attention on the qu s
tiouable political fact thit no party nor leader
could ever nope to carry a scneme for home
rule that did not have the c >rdial concurrence
and support of the Iria i nation.

of our colleagues. We have today, how
ever, received assurances that the Par.ia
mentary Fund Associa ion. ot New York,
otherwise known as the Hoffman house
committee, which raised $300,000 and

time of the last general election, heartily
indorses our action, and that the muni
cipal council of the league in New York
also suppons us."

OCALA, Fia., Dec. 6.—The Farmers'
Alliance this morning discussed the amend
ments to the piatform adopted yesterday,
relating to restricting the power* of the
president in disciplining editors of Alliance
newspapers.
Complaint has been made that the gov
ernment crop stati-ti.an has relied too
much upon information furnished by un
informed congressmen. The committee
on agricultural staiis ics has reported, pro
posing (hat a committee of fire Alliance
congressmen mate arrangements to tret
statistics so that the p op.e may no' be de
pendent on reports irum the government
st itistican. The committee is to co-operate
with the A iiance crop statistic <n.
Turner said that during the Kansas cam
paign cenaior Ingalls bad offered $5,000 for
a roster of Kansas secretaries atone, the
inference being that such roster would
largely increase in va'ue as the Alliance
extended into other states.
Powderly addressed the Alliance dele
gates at Exposition hail this afternoon.
He advocated reform in the employment
of ctuld labor, insisted that the government
had the right to control the railroads, and
then made a tierce attack upon tbe em
ployment of laUor-saving machinery as de
frauding the workman of the right to work.
He was especially bitter against
ail electric devices, declaring that
capitalists in their greed had
even cornered God's wrath, and compelled
it to do their bidding. He denounced
sectionalism, and said: "No matter what
politicians may say, we of the two sections
are together again, and together we will
fight monopoly." This sentiment brought
forth great applause.
At the morning session of the Alliance,
President Hall, of the Missouri State Alli
ance, exploded a bomb regarding the Ma
cune-Polk-Livingstone investigation, which
came near splitting up tbe convention. He
secured the floor and declared that he had
not signed the committee report of yester
day because it was not satisfactory to htm.
He started to read from manuscript his ob
jections, but Macune's adherents raised ob
jections, saying the matter had been closed
yesterday.
A tremendous clamor followed, but
finally Hall's friends prevailed, and he read
his report. He had not signed tbe com
mittee report for severai reasons: Because
it censured President Polk unjustly for
writing the Norwood letter; because it ex
onerated Macune, although he openly ad
mitted before the committee that he had
gone to Qeorgia and formed a combination
among tbe members of the legislature in
the interests of Pat Calhoun for United
States senator; because Macune had
also admitted that Calhoun had
loaned him $2,000. and because Macune
had further admitted that he had remained
sixteen davs In Georgia lobbying for Cal
houn's election and becau e Macune had
admitted that he had for tbe past year
traveled on transportation furnished by
the West Point Terminal Companv. Proof
had also h**n adduced as to the policy of the
National Economist and the Georgia Alliance
Farmer being in the interests of corpora
tions and monopolists. This change had
been *o marked as to have confirmed the
suspicion of outside financial inflnence.
The reading of thi« document was fol
lowed by a tremendous btibbab. Finallv,
as a compromise, Livingstone of Georgia
secured tbe adop'ion of a motion making
a continuance of 'he investigation a special
order. This evening it is understood that
a compromise has been arranged.'Hall

ests of harm on v.
At the evening's session Dr. Macnne ad
dressed the convention briefly, denying the
truth of one of the statements made by
Hall. Then Hall said that while he with
drew the written explanation made by bim
he did not change his original opinion. His
speech wai greeted wiih mingled applause
and hi«se*.
President Polk's suggestion for a national
legislative council was adopted.
The committee on president's message
made a report in favor of retaining that
official's residence <n Wa-hing'on City and
making his salary s3,£>Do. This was adopted,
the action being in d : rect opnosition to
Macnne's recommendation*. Before the
evening session adjourned however, it wis
resolved to indorse the National Ecrmnmi*t.
The gentlemen having in charge the c*li
for a third party convention have received
telegrams from Kansas heartily approving
the movement. They succeeded today in
securing the signatures of fifteen out of six
teen of the colored state now
here.
WASHINGTON CITY. Dec. 6.—Senator In

SENATOR INGAI.LB BEATEN AGAIN
The Snnreme fnnrt l>fn*r« to Increase
Membership of Legislature.
TOPKKA. Ka«., Dec. 6.—The supreme
court tbis morning refused to grant the
writ of raandamos apr-iied for by C. E.
Lobdeil, who demanded a certificate of
election for representative from Lane
county. LoHdeli bases his claims on the
provision of tbe state constitution, which
giv*s each organ zed county in the state,
casting 250 votes, a representative in tbe
legislature.
Ibe case was one of tbe utmost impor
tance, for if Lobdeil bad been admitted
seventeen other Republicans elec ed as
delegates would have been entitled to the
same privilege. Some of them were In
gaiis men, and they would have given the
•enator a majority of two on joint ballot.
The supreme court held that in no event
could the membership of tbe lower boose
exceed 125 members until there was a
change in the con«titn*imv.
