CONGRESS MEETS.
Cannon Re-Elected Speaker;
Crowds Cheer Leader.
The Sixtieth Congress, the ter
mination of which will end a cen
tury and two decades of lawmak
ing, began at noon Monday.
Col. Hepburn, chairman of the
Republican caucus, which had
decided unon Ln:le oe as a
' successor to himself, nominated
the Illinois member. The chair
man of the Democratic caucus
placed John Sharp William., of
Mississippi, the minority s candi
date, before the house as the
proper man to be ejected leader.
Aobody was at all surprises
when "Uncle Joe" won in a walk.
Announcement of the result was
made by the tellers, two Repub
lican and -two Democratic mem
bers, selected by the clerk, and
then the newly elected speaker
was escorted to the rostrum by
a committee headed by his riv
al, the Mississippian.
Crowds of men and women
who in their way represent the
citizenship, the chivalry aid the
fashion of the country at the na-
tional capital, thronged the Sen
ate an l House galleries to wit
ness the inauguration of a new
Congress. Hundreds who came
late packe! the gallery corridors
and waited with varying degrees
of patience for the ticket-holders
and early birds , to become bored
and depart so as to give them a
chance near the finish to say that
they had seen and heard some
thing of the curtain-raiser to
the winter's session.
The star figure in the stage
' setting was a rank outsider, in so
far as the personnel of Congress
is concerned, but one who is far
from being a noncombatant in
the politics that underlie the
present situation. W. J. Bryan of
Nebraska it was. An actor with
out a set part, he walked upon
the floor of the House fifteen
minutes before the gavel fell,
evokiner full five minutes o
cheers, handclapping and yells
from his party colleagues there
gathered, and equally tumultous
enthusiasm among his admirers
in the galleries.
Bryan, the foreordained candi
date for the presidency on the
Democratic ticket, was not there
merelv for show. For three hours
he was he busiest personage in
sicrht. Under the spell of his
- - r
magnetism the Democratic min
ority grew enthusiastic over the
attack made upon the House
rules, and in a series of personal
conferences individual members
hear from his lips the outline
. of policies which he insists shall
be followed to shape the charac
ter of the approaching national
campaign.
An attack upon the House
g
rules is an incident to the open
ing day of every Congress. Rare
ly, however, as happened Mon
day, does a member of the well
disciplined majority kick yer
the traces. Representative Coop
er of Wisconsin, who has been
chairman of the committee on in
sular affairs ever since its crea
tion, had the temerity to give ut
terance to convictions which
many of his colleagues hold but
dare not express.Speaker Cannon
had made his salutatory speech
and was in the chair, and John
Sharp Williams, the minority
leader, had made the protest for
his side against the adoption of
the rules which place -so much
power in the hands of the pre
siding officer.
Then, as Mr. Williams con
cluded, Mr. Cooper arose and
shot his bolt. He declared that
the rules were all wro: -that
the speaker and two men . m
the speaker appointed to i effect
his will had absolute say as to
what legislation should be con
sidered. Members were depend
ent absolutely upon the speaker
for recognition to get unanimous
consent to have a measure called
up. In Mr. Cooper's opinion the
system was unrepublican and un
democratic. It was Coopers contention
that the speaker, like the speak
er of the house of commons,
should be merely a presiding of
ficer, and he declared that Mr.
Cannon could lead his party
better or. the floor, with freedom
of action allowed . to all mem
bers. The . attack forced Speaker
Cannon to come to the defense
of his office, and this he did, after
Mr. DeArmond of Missouri, had
followed Mr. -Cooper. In sum
ming up he said:
'The chair desires to state that
the speaker of the House is the
servant cf the House, and it is in
the power of the House of Rep
resentatives, as a question of the
highest privilege, at any time to
elect a successor to any member
who may hold this great Office.
When special orders or special
rules are made, as they have been
made under all administrations,
at least for twenty years, no rule
can foe vitalized, can become) ef
fective, until a majority of the
House has adopted it under the
constitution and rules of the
House. , When the majority of
the House acts under the consti
tution anl the laws no speaker
would dare fail to obey them.
The will of the majority always,
for thirty-four years to my
knowledge, lias been the law to
the sneaker."
Mr. Bryan was one of the most
interested listeners to the clash
m
ever the rules, ami Lv nods and
whisperede sentences approved
the points made by the minority.
Declares
Balloons no
Good as
Fighters.
In a lecture to the students of
the engineering department of
the Drexcl Institute, at Philadel
phia, Dr. T. Chalmers Fulton,
president of the Ben Franklin
Association of America, declared
that balloons can never be util
ized for practical work as instru
ments of war.
Dr. Fulton's subject was "Aer
ial Travel," and he discussed all
known classes of air craft. The
balloon, he said, is about the
same as it was ten years ago, and
is useful only for meteorological
or geograhpical research, photo
graphic studies or sport. He re
ferred to the recent trip of the
Pommerin, in which the big bal
loon passed directly over the
forts on Governor's island, N Y.
saying:
The people in the balloon at
the time could peer down into
the forts and take in everv de
ad of the workings, but they
would have found it harder to
Iron a bomb inside the fortifica-
ions.
Anything dropped trom a
galloon must have the same ve-
ocity as the balloon itself, and
it might not reach the ground
until a great distance away from
he object at which it was aimed
"No matter how fast the bal
loon travels any object thrown
from it reaches the ground in a
nlumb line under the basket.
This same fact is true of dirigi
bles. though this style of airship
has the additional disadvantage
of being unable to go high
enough for safety.".
After reviewing the work hat
has been done toward perfecting
heavier than air living machines
Dr. v niton said that no success
ful machine can be built unti
man patterns after nature, tie
urged the flapping wing style o
machine as having advantages
over the aeroplane, and said tha
when a practical flying machine
is perfected it will be capable o
traveling 150 miles an hour.
Seek Hoggatt's Job.
Wilford B. Hoggatt, Govcrnoi
of Alaska, will have to fight foi
his official existence. Powerful
interests in the far-away domain
over which he presides have de
termined to depose him, if pos
sible. Charges have been pre
pared and are now on the va
and it is expected that Hoggarl
will arrive at Washingon soon
to tell the President his side oi
the story.
Hoggatt is an Indiana ;man
and was raised at Boonville,
where his relatives reside. Aftei
an honorable career in the navy.
President Roosevelt appointed
him as chief executive of Alaska.
For some time influential cap
italists, for reasons best known
to .themselves, have been trying
to secure the organization of a
territorial form of government .in
Alaska as a substitute for the
present simple method of gov
erning through the Interior De
partment. Hoggatt has fought
them at every step, believing
tnat a territorial government,
with its extensive machinery of
a Legislature and other depart
ments, would entail a heavier ex
pense upon the people of Alaska
than would be justified.
By Jiis aggressive attitude he
has created fierce antagonisms,
and his foes have determined to
go after his official scalp. The
details of their charges have not
been revealed, but it is under
stood they accuse him of favorit
ism toward certain trusts and
capitalistic combinations.
It will take substantial evi
dence to displace Hoggatt, as the
President has observed his ca
reer closely, from the time he
joined the navy and has often
spoken highly of him.

Congress Gets a Long Message.
President Roosevelt's first mes
sage to the Sixtieth Congress
was read in both Houses Mon
day. The document is very long
(nearly 30,000 words) and deals
with many important topics.
Among these are the tariff, mon
ey, railroads, law enforcement,
capital and labor and the army
and navy. Members of both
Houses were in their seats early
to hear the reading of the docu
ment. I he usual committees
from the Senate and House call
ed 'on the President early and
notified him that Congress was
ready to hear any communica
tion that he might have to send
in. Alter the message was re
ceived there was little delay in
beginning the reading. The gal
leries contained an unusual num
ber of visitors, many of whom
were women.
Saved from Terrible Death.
The three-year-old daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Addison Snell of
Wanatah, had a very narrow es
cape from death. While the
mother was at wdrk washing she
was using some concentrated lye
which she had prepared and
placed it in a cup on the kitchen
cabinet. The little girl who was
eating bread thinking that the
cup contained water took a drink
of it. She at once dropped the
cup and began to scream, which
attracted the mother, who im
mediately, realiizng what was
ailing the child, gave it some
mill: o drink, which probably
saved its' life. A physician was
also called and after a few hours
of hard work the child was
brought out of danger.
Roosevelt's Policy.
Here in brief is the President's
constructive programme :

suggestion tor an investigation

and directors of national banks
should ever be allowed to loan to
themselves peculiarly fitting in

leave the. tariff severly alone tern
porarilv except in one important
particular, where crying need for
action exists. 1 his exception is
the tariff on wood pulp. The di
minishing forests are in the
President's mind as one reason
for his recommendation. If pos
sible he would have the repeal of
the duty accomplished by an
agreement with Canada that
there shall be no export.

tariff is revised

tion question, he says, to the end
that a way may be devised to
limit its abuse. This is the first
feature of a special programme
relating to questions arising , be
tween labor and capital. An em
plovers liability act is urged, and
the President would strengthen
the laws regarding safety appli
ances on railroads whoever they
are weak. He favors the cxten
ion of the' eight-hour dav," and
would nave provision lor com
pulsory investigation oi indus
trial disputes, holding up the re
cent telegraph strike as a case
where such provision would have
been of immense value to the
public. By no means of last im
portance are recommendations
for further investigation and leg
islation with a view to wiping
out cinid lanor and minimizing
the evils of the employment of
women.
i. i iiau our irreat river svs
terns should be devlopcd as na-
tionai water nignwavs, tue .Mis
sissippi with its tributaries
standing first in importance, is
among the recommendations,
and that the present
will make a beginning is the
President's hope. He implores
especial attention for the Missis
sippi, and declares that from the
great lakes to the mouth of the
Father of Waters there should be
a deep water way, with deep wat
er ways leading to it from the
Fast and West. Combined with
the deep water ways policy are
outlines of plans for reclamation
work, the conservation of public
lands and mineral and fuel lands
and the preservation of the for
ests.

beginning of a new era in the up-
building and maintenance of the
American navy, which President
Koosevei declares is tue greatest
essential to the preservation of
peace with the rest of the world.
There arc recommendations for
reforms in the navy personnel,
so that merit shall be thc prime
thing that counts in promotion,
T 111 .
and to retire, especially in thc
navy, officers at a younger age
than now is possible, so as to get
the best there is out of officers
of flag rank. Increase of pay for
army officers, and also and more
especially for the enlisted men,
is demanded to keep the army
even on a peace foot in.
These features, as grouped
above, may "be said to comprise
the particularly important ele
ments of the Roosevelt policy for
the future.
In the second sentence of his
first paragraph, the President
struck a chord which ought to
ring in the ears of the country
like a cathedral chime. It is the
sentence warning the people
against the folly of hoarding
their cash.
In his message the President
further assures the country upon
two vital points that honest
business need fear nothing from
his policies; that he has taken no
back track in his crusade against
dishonestv in high life or in iow
life.

he was accredited. He secured

Almost ever since he has been
here' there have been the gravest

never at anv time displayed the

It was undoubtedly his friend
ship for the United States and
bis appreciation of the fact that
the people of this country had no
real hostility toward Japan that
cost the Japanese ambassador

Would Recover $400,000,000
From Bank of England.
According to the St. Peters
burg liourse Gazette the Pank o
England will be called upon to
repay a sum lodged in 1722
which, at compound interest
now amounts to $100,000,000.
The deposit was, .it is said
made payable at sight and never
has been claimed. It was Iodget
by a local governor in the little
Russian district north of Kieff
His name was Polubotko and he
held office from 1722 to 1724.
Now a former professor in
a
conservatorium named 'Rubefz
lias requested thc representatives
of forty noble families, descend
ants and relatives of Polubotko
to meet in thc town of Starodub
in little Russia, in order to agree
upon measures to be taken to
procure $400.000.000 from the

One Crop Worth $70,842.70.
What is believed to be the
argest check ever paid to anv
one wheat grower in the North
west has just been received by
a Pendleton, Ore., farmer for the
season's crop raised on about
,000 acres of Umatilla wheat
and. The check was drawn bv
he Pacific Elevator Company
or $70,842.70.
All eastern Oregon has had a
manner crop year, producing G,-
000,000 bushels, or 1 per cent of
he total wheat crop of the Unit
ed States. Actual crop failure
was never known in that section,
and many who began work there
a few years ago with an .ox cart
are now riding in ' automobiles.
art of the wheat acreage is leas
ed from the Indians o' the Uma-
illa reservation, who derive an
income of about $200,000 a year
rom this source.
Along the main line of the Or
egon Railroad and Navigation
Company lies the Government s
Umatilla reclamation project,
which within a year or two will
add 20,000 acres of fertile land to
the productive area of this sec-
lon. This project has already
stimulated the territory affected
o such an extent as wholly to
change its character. Tha prin
cipal town, Hermiston, has
sprung out of the dry plains and
now. with a population of 500,
tas several rapidly growing riv
als.
Part of the land included in
the Government's reclamation
project will come under cultiva
tion next vear, and p. larger part
of 20,000 acres will be readv for
cultivation in 1009. The engi
neering work necessary to the
transformation of this territory
from sage-brush desert to pro
ductive farming land is simple,
consisting of a feed canal from
river to reservoir and a distribut
ing system that can be complet
ed in a short time.
Shower of Ashes Falls in Alaska
A special cable to Portland,
Orecron from Nome, Alaska.
says : Nome and probably the en
tire Seward peninsula is shroud
ed in an ashy haze and the
ground for miles is covered sev
eral inches deep with a fine grit
ty powder which is believed to
be volcanic ashesl The storm
began several days ago. the dust
blowing in from the ocean, but at
first little attention was paid to
the freak of nature, as it was ex
pected that it would soon cease.
Instead, however, the fall con
tinned; and after a day became
so dense as seriously to interfere
with out-door pursuits.
Miners coming into town re
ported that for miles the snow-
was so impregnated with the
ashes that sledding was almost
impossible. Further, the air; is
so full of ashes that breathing is
difficult, and the fine powder was
sifted into houses and business
places to such an extent that it is
thick on the floors and on every
thing in the way of goods and
household furniture. It is be
lieved thaf some one of the 'num
erous volcanic islands, either be
tween the Pacific coast and Si
beriaf or, more probably, those
islands in the Alaskan pcry'nsula
or the Aleutian islands, are again
in eruption- and that the ashy
downpour is the result. No ser
ious results are expected, but
much inconvenience is being
caused by the peculiar storm.

Big Demand for the Panama
Canal Bonds.
Bids for the new Panama can
al bond issue continue to be re
ceived at the Treasury Depart
ment at Washington and the of
ficials are confident that the $50,
000.000 will be largely bver-snb-the
number of bids which had
been received at 4:30 o'clock
Monday afternoon placed the to
tal at about 2,000 and judging
from statements made in person
or by letter to the Treasury De
partment it is thought that there
will be a number ranging from
$2,000,000 to $5,000.000 and over.
The prices offered, it is confi
dently believed, wijl be entirely
satisfactory from the Treasury
point of view.
Senator Owens, of Oklahoma,
who was a caller at the White
House Monday, said he had been
assured that Oklahoma would re
ceive the $5.000.000 due from the
Nationdl Government appropri
ated in lieu of school lands in
thc Indian Territory, next week.
This money, he said, would be
deposited by the State in State
banks without delay, thus reliev
ing the financial situation in Ok
lahoma .and the income of the
State will be greater because of
the higher rate cf interest which
will be paid by the State banks.
A committee consisting of the
Governor and other officers, will
be appointed to invest this mon
ey and utilize the income in pub
lic improvements in the new
State. Until these investments
have been arranged the money
will "remain on deposit in the
State banks.
Congress at Sea.
Both houses of Congress are
more at sea concerning legisla
tion than at any previous session.
Both parties arc thus afflicted.
One question is uppermost in the
mind of practically every mem
ber oKboth parties. This is the
financial situation. But while
leaders cf both parties are think
ing on this subject, it does not
follow that they are all of one
mind as to the course remedial
legislation shall take. One thing
can be said with certainty, and
that is that no one knows what
course remedial legislation will
take looking toward a remedy for
the situation. '
Kaiser Burned in Effigy.
Monster indignation meetings
were held at Lemburg and other
towns in Galicia in protest
against the expropriation of Pol
ish landholders in Prussia. Great
hostility was displayed against
Chancellor von Buelow and Bar
on von Aehrenthal, thc German
foreign minister.
Effigies of Emperor William
and Baron von Aehrenthal were
burned amidst insulting cries,
and a strong force of police was
summoned to protect the Ger
man consulate at Lemburg,
against mob violence.

Postal Deficit Decreasing
If the amount lost by fire, bur
glary, etc., is added to the ordin
ary excess of expenditures dur
ing the year on account of pre
vious fiscal years, the gross defic
it in the postal service during the
year li0; will aggregate $r,G'J2,
031. Thc third assistant ost
master general, A. L. Lawshc -iu
his annual report gives the'abaw
figures, and with it quotes the?
amount of the postal deficit ii
1D0G, which was $10,5in,0;X
The third assistant postmaster
general goes at length into a dis
cussion of the troubles wiiich vex
publishers and those who have to
do with the second class postage
rates. A ruling has been made
newspapers and periodicals,
which will be put in force in ai
few days. It is in effect that the
publisher shall be allowed to.
mail sample copies at the pound
rate to a limit of 10 per cent o
his bona fide subscription list.
It is recommended that the
money order system be extended
to every jxistoffiee in the United
States. "All postoffices transact
registry business," says Mr.
Lawshe. "Why noi money or
der business?". The passage of
a bill providing for a form of
postal note whereby sums of
money less than $2.50 may be
sent through the mail cheaply is
recommended.
