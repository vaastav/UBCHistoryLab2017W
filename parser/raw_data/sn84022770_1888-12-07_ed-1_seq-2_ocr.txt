OLYIPIA. FRIDAY EVENING, DEC.JJSS^
"Piety iu Rags"
Under this caption the San Fran
cisco Examiner of the 3d inetant pub
lished an article which created a sen
sation. The question having arisen
whether the gospel was practically as
free to every living creature as in theo
ry and song, a reporter of that journal
was detailed to make a practical test
of the matter by disguising himself as
nearly as jioesible to represent a man
who had seen better days and visiting
the fashionable churches during regu
lar service. The result is given in
three columns detailing his experience j
at the several churches. 111 not one
single instance was he received with
that fraternal love which the Christ
life teaches. 111 no one of the gilded
palaces dedicated to the modern god
Mammon—did he find any recognition
of those time-honored principles which
actuated the patriarchs of old, and
which take the strongest hold upon
the hearts of those who love and rev
erance the Bible; but on the contrary
his apjiearance was greeted by the
swift glance of contempt, the curling
lip of scorn and muttered expressions
of amazement at his presumption in
entering the sacred shrine in tattered
clothes. Even the ushers were inso
lent iu their behavior, and reluctantly
gave him a hack seat or sent him up
into the gallery witli the unswerving
dignity that a couiluctor on a mixed
train sends the second-class passengers
to the forward coach or the smoking
car.
The Examiner't publication had an
immediate good effect, for in the suc
ceeding issue appear the views of sev
eral of the pastors of the churches vis
ited, and they deplore the existence of
the bigotry which lias drifted the
Christian church so far from its moor- j
ings. If the true spirit exists in these ;
congregations, they will, of course, be
greatly benefitted by this awakening
to a sense of duty, but to those who
make ostensible worship of Diety a
means for display and the gratification
of human vanity, it will be regarded
simply as an audacious interference
with personal privileges and pass un
heeded.
The lesson taught our metropolitan
neighbors should not be lost in
churches of smaller places and sparser
congregations. If the same besetting
sin is not so marked as to he appre
ciable here, there are many lesser ones
which a close study of the life of the
jfazarine will enable us to discover.
Humility is a Christian virtue that
seems to be almost wanting in some
congregations and charity, that great
est of all virtues in its broadest sense, is
so rare at times as to excite the won
der of those whose natures have not
become calloused by creed.
The Examiner's articles are com
mended to the church people as a true
remedy for that pride which destroys
the Christian nature. It may be a
.bitter draught, but it will doubtless act
irilh precision, and finallj as a seda
tive, to restore the church to its former
purity and usefulness.
Arm every Presidential electiou
there is a class of people who predict
the total ruin and disbandment of the
beaten party. Nothing can be more
ridiculous. In 1872 the Democratic
party was considered beyond all hope
and yet it carried the election in 1876.
Hancock's defeat was said to involve
the rain of the party, but it swept
Cleveland into die White House four
yean later. The Democracy will take
the field again in 1882 with renewed
confidence and with as mqcli assur
ance d success as ever.

As Mr.'E. B. Hyde of Spokane
Falls voted for Mr. Harrison in the Chi
cago Convention " first, last and all the
time," he will probably be a match
for Tom Cavanaugli in the distri
bution of the spoils, notwithstand
ing tip latter gertleman is 4
g* member of the National Committee,
There will be fun enough when the
curtain rises, for spectators, notwith
standing the entertainment will par
take somewhat of the nature of a pack
of wolves fighting over carrion.
THK more important portions of the
President's Message to Congress are
given in the form of a supplement to
the STANDARD this week. It will be
rpad with interest by everybody, as em
anating from one who was defeated for
a conscentious discharge of a duty he
knew would be misunderstood and un
popular. There is no indication of a
change of opinion on the tariff ques
tion, although his last appeal is likely
to fall upon unwilling ears.
Owno to reports that Chinese are
now finding their way into the United
States through British Colombia and
Mexico, a new bill or resolution looking
to some joint agreement between the
governments of Great Britain and the
United States and Mexico to prohibit
the landing of Chinese immigrants is
expected to be reported st the present
session of Congress.
Ws are now being treated to dreary
discussions of the future of the Demo
cratic party. This is adding insult
to injury. The future of the party is
assured; it will always live. In fact,
it is the only party in this country
that has demonstrated its ability to
<wi«t a quarter of a century out of
power.
Two men ciugbt 19,000 pounds of

Bainier, in less thirty days, for
which they received two cents a

A GOOD MOVE. —In view of the fact
that individual sovereignty necessarily
implies that the majority shall rule,
Representative Stone of Kentucky to
day introduced a joint resolution pro
posing an amendment to the Constitu.
tion, providing that the President and
Vice-President shall be chosen every
iourth year by direct votes of the peo
ple. One section of the bill forbids
the holding of any local or State elec
tions, except for members of Congress,
on the day set apart lor the election of
President and Vice-President. Had
this Democratic principle prevailed
when the Constitution was framed,
President Cleveland would to-day be
President elect, by a decided majority
of the ten millions of voters.
In a late interview with twenty]
prominent representative men of both
parties, in this city, to ascertain their
preference for the Pacific Coast mem
ber of Mr. Harrison's cabinet, should
that worthy concede its claims, six
were for Geo. H. Williams, of Oregon,
five for Senator Dolph, of the same
State, three for ex-Governor Squire, of
this Territory, two for W. W. Morrow,
of California, one for Senator Jones of
Nevada, one for Estee of California,
one for Swift of California, and the
twentieth man didn't want any Pacific
coaster appointed and especially not
Jl. H. DeYoung, of California.
JODGE Langford decided at Walla
Walla last Tuesday that a railroad
company is not liable for damages re
sulting to stock because the company
had not fenced its track; that under
common law the owners of cattle must
keep them off the premises of others.
In short, that the owner of real estate,
even of a railroad company, is not
bound to fence against the depreda
tions of cattle, in the absence of a spe
cial statute. This is a very important
ruling, and under it, if sustained, rail
roads need not fence their tracks.
The case will be appealed to the Su.
preme Court.
THE Philadelphia and Reading Rail
road Company have notified their em
ployes of a reduction of time and
wages, owing to a suspension of the
coal mines, and the same condition
applies to all persons connected with
the coal traffic. Verily it seems the
millenium's dawn has not yet illu
mined the horizon, notwithstanding
the promises that a Republican victory
at the polls held so seductively to
mady ears.
A LETTER from Secretary Bayard to
the owners of the steamer Haytian Be
public, which is held by the Haytians
as a prize, having been condemned for
running the blockade, has been made
public. The Secretary declares the
seizure illegal and states that an
American man-of-war will be sent to
Port au Prince to demand the steam
er's release.
THE German bark C. B. Bishop,
which left San Francisco on the 29th
ult, with a cargo of wheat for Queens
town, returned to that port after she
had proceeded 200 miles on her way,
with fire in her hold. At last accounts
the fire was still burning and threatens
total destruction to the ship.
MRS James G. Blaine, Jr., has de
cided to become an actress. She also
contemplates a suit for damages
against the Blaine family, for alienat
ing the affections of her husband.
A COLLISION between a freight and
construction train, at Cocolla, I. T., on
the 4th, resulted in a general wreck,
in which a brakeman was killed and a
fireman fatally injured.
A SAN FRANCISCO dispatch of the
4th says that the steamer Wilmington
has been placed in quarantine, having
on board a case of smallpox from Se
attle.
MR. J. C. Haines has been acquitted
of the charge of conspiracy with the
opium smugglers in the trial in New
York.
CHIEF Justice Boyle has appointed
his son Edward O. Boyle, Deputy
Clerk of the District Court at Seattle.
THE Secretary of War has directed

Cleveland's Message.
CONGRESSMEN EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS
IN REGARD TO IT.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The follow
ing are the Congressional expressions
of Cleveland's message:
Springer, Democrat, Illinois, said:
"It is as strong on the tariff question
as the last one, though not so explicit.

Congressman Reed, Republican, of
Maine: "A year has bought about a
great change. Then it was a condi
tion thai confronted us, and not a
theory, and now, apparently, it is a
theory and not a condition."
Senator Ingalls, Republican, of Kan

Congressman Boutelle, Republican,

Senator Gorman, Democrat, of

Congressman Foran, Democrat, of

The Oyster Rebellion.
MARYLAND WILL SEEK HELP FROM THE
SECRETARY OF WAR.
BALTIMORE, Nov. 17.—Governor
Jackson, in an interview to-day, said
the situation of the oyster rebellion,
which confronts the State authorities
in this: " There arc 800 oyster vessels
whose crews, aggregating about 5,000
armed men, are banded together to
dredge on certain grounds and to
drive off any State force sent against
them. To oppose them the State has
fourteen vessels, most of them small
sloops, manned by about 100 men.
We have reached a stage where this
force cannot cope with the marauders,
and I shall adopt measures for the en
forcement of the law. I have reason
to believe that the Secretary of War
at Washington will grant us the use
of five, six or eight-pound cannons,
which will be placed on the State
steamers and at spots on shore to be
selected hereafter."

was given in his honor at Albany, New

vited, principally on account of his
wonderful likeness to the prince. At
the table the prince's attention was
called to.Mr. Dorsey and the notable
resemblance to himself. The prince
eyed Dorsev for a moment and then
drawled out. " I perceive Mr. Dawsey
that your resemblance to me is re
markable. Was your mother ever in
England?" Dorsey calmly replied,
Never, but my father was."
