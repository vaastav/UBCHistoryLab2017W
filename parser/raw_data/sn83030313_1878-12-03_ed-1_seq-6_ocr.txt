The \Vfather.? As the storm centre that

of disturbance over the lower lake region and
tbe Middle Atlantic States. '1 be area of high
pressure that lay over the northcustcm districts
retarded the eastward movement of the depres
sion, so that very steep gradients were Armed
on the New llngland coast, producing
strong gales in that region. The centre of
lowest barometer is moving rapidly toward
Novo Scotia, and bad weather will be experi

Pifsidt-itl Ilayvi'
Mr Hayes' second annual MeuAge is
moderate even to Umeuess. It is more re
markable for the omissions which imply a
reconciliation with his political party than !
tor recommendations looking to legislative I
action. Wo do not assert that the Prcsi- ;
dent's extreme moderation is not wise, for
there is nothing in the immediate situa- i
tion which calls lor ' boldness, and j
experience has taught him* the in
' utility of displays of political vigor which
evaporate in the mere utterance. The i
party composition of the two houses ;
Is such that no really great measures of ,
legislation arc possible at this session, and 1
tho President wisely abstains from offeriug ?
futile propositions.' Plain and nerveless as
this Message is, the President evinces !
good sense and sound discretion both in 1
what he says and what he omits.
Tlie most noteworthy of his omissions is |
his total silence ou the great subject of a
reform in the civil service, in which he has
heretofore taken so zealous an interest. j
In his letter of acceptance and inaugural j
address this topic held the foremost .
place, and it occupied a large spaco
in the annual Message of last year. It is
not probable that he has changed his views
on this subject, but he has learned to dis
tinguish between what is desirable and j
what is practicable, and will no longer j
obstruct his usefulness in other respects by
an urgency of which the only effect has
been to estrange the leading men of his
purty and to cripple his influence. It is
more consistent with his personal self-re
spect and official dignity to make this tacit
retreat than it would have been to indulge
in complaints or apologies. His silence is
significant, and will be generally interpreted
ns betokening future harmony between the
President and his party in Congress.
The other striking omission is not quite
so suggestive, because it is imposed on him
by a change of circumstances. Iu bis Mes
sage of last veur President Hayes dwelt at
length on the excellent efleets of his South
ern policy, claiming that it had been notably
vindicated by the restoration of peace and
good feeling and by a more humane treat
ment of colored citizens and greater respect
for their rights than had existed at any pre
vious time since their emancipation. There
is nothing of this congratulatory tone in the
present Message. Events have disappointed
the confident hopes expressed by the Presi
dent last year, and he repeats only that part
of his former declarations in which he
pledged himself to the full protection of
every class of citizens. This change of tone
is justified by events and explains itself;
bat it will also contribute to unite and
strengthen the republican party by re
moving another cause of difference between
its leaders and the President.
The attitude of Mr. Hayes toward the
perpetrators of the recent election frauds
is just and wise, and he ought to bo sup
ported in it by fair-minded democrats,
as he is certain to be by the whole
republican party. The President in
dulges in none of the screechy ex
aggerations which are so common with
the Haunters of the bloody shirt. He is
careful not to make his accusations broader
than the facts. He does not arraign the
whole Southern people, but only the com
paratively small number of localities in
which the frauds have been perpetrated.
This discriminating moderation of state
ment and the evident spirit of regret in
which the subject is treated are fitted to
secure the candid construction of just and
thinking democrats. The President's ap
peal to the Southern people to correct
this evil themselves is well directed, and
we trust that it may be heeded. The
democratic party could not commit a
greater lolly than it would be to array itself
against this part of the Message. President
Hayes does not seek party advantage, but
only justice and equal rights. He has every
motive for wishing the success of the South
ern policy with which he set out, and would
gladly see it vindicated by such action on
the part of the South as would justify the
confidence he reposed in tli&t section. Here
is a golden opportunity for the democratic
leaders to prove their sagacity and
their sense of justice. If they will give n
vigorous support to the President in the
reasonable and moderate position which
he has assumed on this dangerous and ex
plosive subject they can take the wind but
of the sails of the bloody shirt republicans
and destroy the most effective part of their
political capital, but if they should inuke
war on the President for this portion of his
Message they will reap the consequences in
a solid republican North in the next Presi
dential election.
Excepting the Southern question and the
recommendation of precautionary measures
against the introduction of pestilence the
Message is chiefly devoted to a brief history ;
of our foreign intercourse and a recupitu- ,
lation of tLe leading points in the several j
department reports and indorsement of
their recommendations. The President ex
presses a firm and confident belief in the
success of resumption under the laws as 1
they stand, and does not desire any impor- ,
tant changes in th"m at this session. "In
the present financial condition of the conn
try," he says, "I am persuaded that the
welfare of legitimate business and industry
of every description will be best promoted
by abstaining from all attempts to make
radical changes in the existing financial
legislation. Lot tho herding influence of
time, the inherent energies of our people,
and the boundless resources of our country
have a fair opportunity, and relief from
present difficulties will surely follow."
There is good raw on for believing that, in
spite of some d'bate and agitation, this
sound view a ill prevail.
The President has considerable to say on
1 the Indian question, but he carefully re
trains Horn committing himself for or
against the transfer of Indinu affairs to the
War Department. II? earnestly favors
reasonable attempts to civilize the Indians
by bringing them to abandon their wander
ing lite and sottle down as agriculturists
' and herdsmen.
He speaks hopefnlly of tii* prospect of
settling our border difficulties with Mexico,
j expresses confidence in the good intentions
i of the Mexican government, and has a good
, word to any for the international Exhibi
tion which is to be held in Mexico next
year. He also takes akoptful view ot an
increase of our trade with brazil and other
South American countries.
lie recommends some legislation for
carrying out the new postal treaty: favors
relief of the Supreme Court from its over
whelming accumulation of business by a
largo addition to tbe number of circuit
judges; indorses the suggestions of the Sec
retary of War, and makes some other minor
recommendations. On tbe whole, this is a
cautious, judicious and conciliatory, al
though not a very striking and in no respect
au original Message.
Rneila Gives Notice That She Means
to Slay.
"Prince Lobanoff informed Safvet Pacha
that the Russians will evacuate Bulgaria
and Roumelia conformably with the Treaty
of Berlin, but that they will continue to
hold Adrianople and Thrace pending the
Porte's acceptance of n definitive treaty."
By this statement, therefore, the Sultan's
government has been put ia possession of
Russia's view as to the bearing of the several j
treaties in operation on the point of the
Russian evacuation of the Turkish territory, !
and understands that Russia will nol with- |
draw her troops merely because some We$t- !
ern diplomatists are of opinion that the j
Berlin Congress intended to provide that i
she should withdraw them. This notice has [
been given, doubtless, in pursuance of the
report mude by Count Schouvaloft'of tbe re
sponses he had received in Vienna and in
London, whither ho wont from Livadiu to
confer with the Austrian and English gov
ernments on this with other subjects.
In England, it will be remembered,
the reports represented that he was
treated somewhat de haute en has; and
we suggested then that this ill
timed exhibition of bad temper meant
simply a failure of the British Ministry to
come to an understanding with the personal
representative of the Czar on the difficult
points which England holds are covered
beyond dispute by the Treaty of Berlin
alone, bat which Russia regards in another
light. No doubt it was a very great sur
prise to England's two representatives at the
Berlin Congress to learn that there was no
provision in their treaty for a generul
evacuation of the' Turkish territory.
It was a surprise to the French even,
and so serious an authority as the
Journal des Debats pronounced the Russian
view to be ridiculous and preposterous. It
compared the Russian occupation of Turkey
to the German occupation of France, and
said that to yetuse to leave Adrianople when
it had agreed to evacuate the other districts
was as if the Germans, having agreed to
evacuate one department of France, should
have merely gone into another, which they
might have done surely if they had not
agreed upon a general evacuation of the
whole territory by a given date ; and an
equivalent to that has in the present case
not been agreed upon. This notice to
Turkey will be a now thorn in the aide of
the British Ministry, lor the old game of
calling the Russians names will not satisfy
the country. There is the treaty, and
people can read for themselves in that?in
what is there as in what is not there?the
record of Benconstield's and Salisbury's
imbecile diplomacy.
Decorative Art as a Practical Charity.
The Decorative Art Society's Loan Exhibi
tion closed last Saturday, and we are
pleased to learn that the receipts have been
large enough to render the permanent sue*
cess of thin admirable benevolent under
taking no longer doubtful. The exhibition
was especially interesting as showing the
improvement made since lost year's din
play by those who enjoy the advantages of
the society's aid, as well as in the evidence it
afforded of the continued activity and zeal
of the patrons of the enterprise. Artists
who are in love with their own genius and
critics who are ambitious to display their own
acuteness may be disposed to turn up their
noses at the articles exhibited and to pro
nounce them very trumpery productions.
But a, young society, having for its main
object the training of women in a
pursuit from which they may earn
a livelihood, will scarcely aspire to
place their proteges at once on a level
with the most famous artists and workmen
of the Old World, or to establish for them
in the second year of their apprenticeship
a high reputation lor originality and beauty
of design. Wc know that the society is
doing an excellent Christian work ; that it
is encouraging artistic taste, gradually pro
ducing artistic skill, rcflning and elevating
the recipients of its care, and In every re
spect meriting the encouragement and sub
stantial aid of all good citizens. These
facts are sufficient to encourage the pro
moters of the excellent undertaking to per
severe* in their good work, and to assure
them that their benevolent efforts will be
crowned with permanent success.
The Dairy Fair.
Governor Seymour's address at the open
ing of the fair tor Jhe exhibition of dairy
men's products puts before the reader very
chastely and happily the purposes and prog
ress, the system, the various excellences
of method and the enormous successes ac
tually achieved by tbo Dairymen's Associa
tion. It is true it seems to lead up to the
national apotheosis of cheese?to the view
that the glory of the world is based firmly
and unmistakably upon this sapid arid nu
tritious substance. It carries just a
step further n certain ancient astronomi
cal theory of how the world was
held up, for under the tortoise upon
which all was superimposed it put the
firm support of a yearly cheese of a million
or more tons weight. People, says Gov
ernor Seymour, rail about banks as if all
the prosperity in the world depended upon
them, and one year's product of butter and
i cheese will more than buy the whole money
circulation of tho country. Perhaps the
niulden growth and great proportions of the
cheese and butter nninutactory Is the taunt
remarkable point yet in our industrial and
commercial history. Philosophers who bavo
said a great deal on the theory of co-opera
tion as the source of satisfaction and wealth
will do well to study the system of the
American cheese factories as a practical
and successful application of all that is good
in their idea.
Secretary Sherman's Heporl.
The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury is clear, able ami businesslike,
and, although some of its minor poiu's are
open to criticism, its broad geueial posi
tions will be nc.epted by the friends of re
sumption as sound and satisfactory. It
touches on many other things than the
preparations for specie payments, but this
subject is of such engrossing interest that
tho details of ordinary fiscal administration
sink into insignificance beside if. The
public has lor some time past been eager
for precise information respecting the prac
tical methods which the Secretary of the
Treasury would adopt for carrying out the
Resumption act. This lucid report con
voys his mature and settled intentions on
that subject.
Of those the most important in its practi
cal effect is his decision to receive legal
tender notes in payment of duties. This,
is equivalent to an annual redemption of
the notes to an amount equal to the annual
revenue from customs. The facilitating ef
fect of this chunge will bo double. In the
first place, it will diminish the employment
for gold and thereby lessen tho demand
for it at the Treasury. In the sec
ond place, it will increase the em
ployment for legal tender notes and
thereby absorb the surplus (if there is
any surplus) of that part of our paper cur
rency. The reception of legal tender notes
at all the custom houses in paymont of
duties would of itself bring them to par
without any other form of redemption, pro
vided there was no increase ot their amount
and no increase of the bauk note circula
tion. The barely nominal premium on gold
proves that our currency is but slightly
redundant, and with the increased use for
it there will be a deficiency which must be
supplied either by the circulation of coin
in current transactions or by enlarged
issues of bank notes.
Another important decision by Mr. Sher
man is the fetusal to give any further gold
certificates alter the date of resumption.
Every legal tender note will then be in
effect a gold certificate, and notes are to be
prepared of the same denominations as the
present gold certificates, in the expectation
that the mercantile community will con
tinue to deposit its gold in the sub-treas
uries for safe keeping. This will absorb an
amount of legal tender notes equal to that
of the gold certificates which they replace,
and will lighten the burden of resumption
to that extent.
Another decision is to offer legal tender
notes in all payments by the government
which are now made in gold, inclnding the
interest on the public debt. When the
notes are precisely equivalent to gold the
public creditors will in most cases prefer
them, but their option of receiving gold
instead is to be scrupulously respected.
Payment of all glasses of public creditors
in legal tender notes will still fnrtber in
craise their use and prevent tliem from
becoming redundant.
We had hoped that Mr. Sherman would
establish other pointB of redemption be
sides the Sub-Treasury in this city, but he
seems to have decided otherwise. This is
of little consequence since bis decision to
receive legal tender notes in all the custom
houses, which is virtual redemption very
widely distributed.
The new silver dollars will cause no em
barrassment until their amount shall be
considerably larger than it is at present.
When legal tender notes are offered for re
demption they are to be paid in silver or
gold, according to the choice of the appli
cant. We shall then be able to see whether
the "daddyites" really prefer silver dollars
to gold ones. Secretary Sherman will ac
commodate them with either to the extent
of the greenbacks tbey may ofl'er for re
demption. .
These several mutually supporting arrange
ments are more than satisfactory: they are
sagacious and excellent. With the agree
ment made with the New York Clearing
House for the convenience of transacting
business, with tho ample gold reserve
which the Treasury has in possession and
its unlimited power ot acquiring more by
the sale of bonds, it is difficult to imagine
any contingency which could cause the
great experiment of resumption to mis
carry.
In the Muddy Mississippi.
Disasters that thrill the world with hor
ror do not always occur where we have
accustomed ourselves to look for them.
Wrecks and fatal collisions at sea have
given many an unfortunate a watery grave,
while wrecks and collisions on the iron
highways of the land have also filleil up the
death rolls that from time to time are read
in our columns. But when disaster over
takes the voyager on our broad rivers,
or leaves the pleasure seeker a man
gled corpse at the foot of a thea
tre stairway, an unusual emotion seizes
the community and people justly doubt
whether tbeTe is a solitary place of safety
on earth. Tho loss of the steamer Cotton
Valley by collision with the steamer
Morgan on Sunday morning, the details of
which appear in our special despatches
to-day, furnishes another melancholy in
stance of the insecurity to lite on one of
the best known water routes in the world.
Although the number of lives lost Is com
paratively small, and bears a marked con
trast to that sacrificed recently on the River
Thames in England, it is only by a for
tunate accident that we are not called on
to deplore as awful a catastrophe. One
steamer?the Cotton Valley is going
np stream and rounding a bend.
Another?the Morgan?is coming down
the river with nil the speed given her by
engines and a swift current. She also rounds
tho latnl bend. A fierce gale is blowing the
while and heavy rain is telling. The boats
sight each other, the engines are stopped?
but a grinding crash follows, and one
steamer begins to sink with her passengers
and cargo. There is no need to describe
the often painted picture of bs>rror that fol
lows. Panic seizes the majority of the half
awakened unfortunates, whojump from their
sleeping places to find the decks under
water. .Some are brave, others frantic
with fear, while n lew rush to death,
tilled with anxiety lest they may be the only
victims, and in their eagerness to escape
make escape impossiide. What scene enn
be more terribly tragic than that wherein a
poor helples3 girl, half clad anil horror
s'lioken, standing on the sinking vessel,
goes down into the muddy waters fear
ing a leap for lift that might have
been u successful ont! On the other
hand. an old lady leaps overboard
and swims bravely to land, a distance
of half a mile. The responsibility lor the
collision rests more with the Morgan than
the Cotton Valley, but the fury of the storm |
made it difficult to manage vessels in a switt
current during the night. We are curious j
to know if any notice ot an approaching i
storm, to affect the Lower Mississippi, was j
given in New Orleans on Saturday, and if j
the river steamers pay nnv attention to sudh
notices? It is proper to note that the offi
cers and regular hands of the lost steamer
behavod with commendable courage, a
quality happily not wanting in American
captains and crews.
Th* Great t'nkiiovv n.
It h::s been said that the world kuows
little ot its greatest men. The truth of this
saying must have come home to our readers
Sunday morning when they took up their
Htn Li) and rend that the great contest be
tween the lrieads of the most popular gen
eral in the country lor tin sword at the
Cathedral fair had resulted in favor of the
unknown and the unsung Wiley. Hancock
was beaten. Shields, with the wounds
anil the honors of two wars upon
him, was vauquished. MoClellan, the
youug Napoleon of our early war days, wus
remanded to a back seat Joe Johnston,
the greatest soldier of the rebellion, was
unable to muster a corporal's guard ot ad
mirers. Sheridan and his fumous charger
were distance t, while Sherman and the
hundred gmerals who marched with him
down info Georgia, and Grant, who received
the sword of the Confederacy at Appomattox,
melted into thin air as tlio conquering
Wiley swept to the head of the lists in the J
groat Cathedral competition. 'Twas a great I
day for Wiley. But who is he? As i
we read the stcry of "his triumph I
wo turned to our war histories to |
find the battles he had fought, the forts
he had taken, the cities he had captured,
the thousnuds he had slain. But among
ten thousand heroes in the long list of bat
tles from Sumter to Kicbmond the name of
Wiley, our Wiley, was conspicuous only by
its absence, and we became more than ever
convinced that lame was a fable and history
a lie. Else why was our Wiley ignored and
forgotten? It is a cause for congratulation,
however, that .justice has at last been done
our great hero and that the conspiracy of
the historians to rob him of his justly
earned honors has been defeated. If it had
not been for the great Cathedral fair and the
exercise of the one-man power of 'l^immany
Hall our Wiley would in all probability
have gone down to his grave unhonored
and unwept. In rescuing onr warrior
from oblivion Mr. Kelly has earned
uu additional claim upon our gratitude.
He has added another brilliant name?the
most brilliant of all?to tbe long roll of our
heroes. If the discovery had been made
sooner what might not have taken place ?
In all probability Grant would never have
been President and our Wiley would to-day
be the recipient of all but royal honors in
the capitals of the world. Now that Mr.
Kelly has made a great general, if he could
not make a Mayor, and that our Wiley is at
last appreciated as he ought to bo, we com
mend him to tbe king-seeking Bulgarians
as the man of all men for their monarch.
Onr Wiley, not Grant, is the hero they
want, for has not Mr. Kelly shown that he
is first in war, first in peace and first in the
hearts of his countrymen ?
National tiaarantinr.
An important part of the President's Mes
sage is given to the consideration of the
ravages of the yellow fever in the Southern
States and to the suggestion that Congress
shall pass a law enabling the government
to institute at all threatened points a sys
tem of quarantine for vessels from foreign
ports. An efficient quarantine against the
tropical countries from which the yellow
fever conies to this eountry would, in the
opinion of all persons acquainted with the
disease, absolutely protect us, us the fever,
they are convinced, never originates within
the limits of the United States. If their
observations are accurate in this particu
lar?and there is no sound argument
against their theory?proper quarantine
at New Orleans and other Gnlf ports would
render impossible, in the measure of its
vigilance, the repetition of suoh summers
as the last in the Mississippi, and equally
render those disastrous visitations impossi
ble elsewhere. Neither need such a quar
antine be conducted on the ground that
non-interconrse is our only salety. That,
it is true, is the doctrine of the yellow fever
committee which reported its inquiries to
the National Health Association. J?ut the
experience of this port proves that commu
nities may be protected in their health
without injnry to commerce. All this is a
subject the President has wisely brought
to the notice of Congress, which we hope
may deal with it as wisely.
Schoolroom Headache*.
Many people who have public school
teachers among their acquaintance are
flrmlv of the opinion that the schoolroom
has a headache system all its own, and their
impression would be strengthened if they
were to interview boys and girls. There is
nothing strange, about the complaint ; the
only wonder is that it is not continuous and
that anybody escapes it. With systems of
heating and ventilation that arc almost ani
formly detective, and, worso yet, under the
control of janitors who have no knowledge
whatever nt these departments of their
business, nnd who are na apt as any
other men to neglect or despise whatever
they do not understand, many of our school
rooms are boxea almost hermetically scaled,
into which hot air is being driven and com
pressed. The heat is frequently intolerable,
the expired breath and other physical ema
nations of the children pollute the air to a
degree extremely dangerous to health, so
teachers and children, who, at nine o'clock
entered the room in fair health and spirits,
emerge nt noon with listless step, aching
head and deranged vital organs. Should a
teacher s nature protest against breathing in
poigon and sweltering in it, np goes a window,
and straightway all the children in its im
mediate vicinity are chilled and temporarily
relieved from one danger only to submit to
another. The condition ot the air of school
rooms is no secret to boards ot education;
it has been the subject of some statistics,
by experts, which lorcibly suggest the
Black Hole of Calcutta; but what is or has
been douo to remedy it ? How many teach
ers are competent to use such ventilating
facilities as their rooms possess? Their own
frequent headaches and those of the help
Jess children elicw that the number is very
smi^ll, and the some effects indicate that
but lew janitors need fear to compare thoii
records with that of the late lamented King
Herod.

Saturday Keiiew, speaking of William black's novels
"Madeod of bar?," says:?"We have said that the
boldness of Mr. Black's venture is justified by its
success. We abotfld, fWr our part, have been mora
pleased had he be in yet more bold and arrived at his
goal without sending bis hero mad. However, as the
novel stands, it reveals a decided gain on the author's
part iu power aud inartistic perception, and through
out it runs the charm of his style, the only danger in
which is a slight inclination to tricklness."

Mr. .lames Sully writes:?"Persons at all senaitivi

may appreciably color their conscious existence.
Our mixed population represents all stages of huso an
progress iu auditory sensibility. The man with
ttucly set musical ear has [ironically to live With bar
barians who uciually take pleasure in harsh and un
lovely sounds, and with many more semi-civilized
who are quite indifferent to such noises. Not only
children, but adults love to tease and excite th?ir
dogs, and this seems to show that they positively en
joy the sensations of lotul sound which they thus
evoke. Thf fondness of a certain class of people for
screaming biids points to the same primitive condi
tion of sensibility."
