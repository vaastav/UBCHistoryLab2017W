Gov. Dockery during the
Campaign invited Joe Flory to
look over the books a t Jetl'erson
City. Wili Mr. Plory accept
the invitation and look over the
books to sec what had become
of the school fund? As a good
citizen he should do soandaf
ter he has examined the books
he should tell the people just
how he tound things. If the
Democrats have been Stealing
Joe Plory should be in position
to give accurate information.
Then if he linds the school fund
all safe and the books straight
he should tell the people the
truth about the matter.

More taxes will be wrung

It is not philanthropy but
greed that causes many mil

This is shown when the mil

what shall be taught in the en

after the close of the Grand

Our Republican friends will
pass the Manna Payne-Fry ship

from the people $20U,000,000,
and give it to some of the con
tributors to Mark's slush fund.
During the campaign the
country was assured that the
Republican party had given
the country just such currency
legislation as was needed.
Now comes the president and
asks for some kind of tinkering
with currency laws.
A ship builder is not any

Opposition Not Obstruction,
In discussing the probable
course the democrats will take
during the closing session of
the fifty-sixth congress, Sena
tor Jones expresses the opinion
that his party associates in the
senate and house will not re
sort to obstructive tactics to
defeat or delay the legislative
programme determined upon by
jthe republicans.
While he does not think the
result of the elections turned so
much on the issues that will be
brought forward in congress as
upon the desire of many peo
ple to let well enough alone, he
believes iu the government of
the majority, and that his col
leagues will give due weight to
the idea that the country has
voted in favor of the republi
cans. It is probable that democrats
in congress will reason about
this matter pretty much as
Senator Jones does. They will
not feel called upon to obstruct
the republican programme for
the Philippines except in so far
as it atteupts the fasting upon
the country oi a permanent
standing army ol large porpor

while agreeing to whatever In
crease may be deemed accessary

which erects upon a lirm foot

Democrats in both branches
of congress may be relied upon
to register an emphatic disap
proval, by their voices and
votes, of every measure
brought forward by the repub
lican majority that is hostile to
those time-honored principles
which the democracy has
always contended were vital to
the happiness, welfare and in
terests of ali the prople
It can confidently be relied on
that the democrats in congress
will denounce and disapprove
the ship subsidy steal for the
enrichment of predatory cor
porations. They will protest,
as vigorously as may be,
against the ratification of the
Hay-Pauucefote treaty, which
recognizes the right of a foreign
nation to dictate the conditions
under whicc an enterprise, ap
proved by American of all
parties and to be built by Am
erican skill, with American
money and throuhg American
territory, shall be conducted.
Iu a word, the plan the demo
crats will pursue in congress
will be to oppose whatever
legislation they deem inimical
to the best interests of the
people and subversive of the
fundamental principles of our
system of gove.nment, but not
to uselessly and arbitrarily in
dulge in a policy of parliamen
tary obstruction. Kansas City
