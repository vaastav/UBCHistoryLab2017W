would announce the annexation of
Egypt.
While the official action taken doea
not provide specifically for the annex
ation of Egypt, the establishment of
the protectorate with a British high
commissioner in absolute control of the
protective measures and the continu
ance of the administrative control by
the British is tantamount to annex
ation. The present edict terminates
