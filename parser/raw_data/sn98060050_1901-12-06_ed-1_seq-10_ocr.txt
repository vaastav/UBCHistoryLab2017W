THE VERMONT PHCENIX, BRATTLEBOHO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1901.
THE BELLOWS
RIVER AT LOW PITCH
Pulp Mill Shut Down and Many
Workmen Idle.
Paper Mill Employes Object to Re
turning to the Old Winter Schedule
and a Strike May Take Place.
Tho Connecticut river Is very low
nt this point, and Is falling rapidly.
For tho past few weeks It has been
impossible to run all the pulp mills
and tho International Paper company
have gradually stopped the different
stones until now hardly any ground
pulp' Is being made hero and
a large number of workmen aro Idle.
The river has fallen about 18 Inches
during tho past week and practically
no water Is passing tho dam, tho
level being considerably lower than
the flash boards.
Tho question of whether tho paper
mills will run more hours per week
than has been done slnco last summer
Is still occupying the attention of em
ployers and employed, and is not as
yet settled. Until last summer tho
mills wero run until 7 o'clock Sunday
morning, and started again at G p.
m., running continuously through the
week. Without solicitation on tho
part of the men the company Issued
an order to close at 0 p. m. Saturday
evening and start again at 7 Monday
morning, and they have done so until
now without reducing the wages.
Two weeks ago an order was received
io return to the old schedule for tho
winter, and the men told they would
bo paid double wages for tho extra
time. The company explain that it
is necessary to make more paper In
order to meet their orders, and that
there Is a serious dlfllculty in our local
situation of having a long canal from
the river which will freeze over with
thick ice In so long shut downs, and
Monday It will break, and packing
against tho racks, stop all work for
some days the first of the week. For
these reasons they ask the men to re
turn to their old hours, promising to
shorten again next spring If It Is possi
ble. This tho men refuse to do and
steps have been taken to secure the
support of the Paper Machine Tenders'
union of the United States to their
position.
T. F. Klnlry, who Is an offlcer of the
national union, went last week to
various points, and a meeting was
held at Palmers Falls, N. Y., at which
It was voted not to submit to tho de
mand of the company but all to strike
if It was insisted upon. At Palmers
Falls and Herkimer similar orders
have been received and both plants
were run tho long hours two weeks
ago, but the men refused to run at both
those points, as well as here, last Sun
day. Supt. John P. Riley of the local
mills has been in New York the past
week in consultation with the ofllcers
rAVthe company but no decision has
3$jj' arrived at.
Planning for New Railroad Station.
At the .regular monthly meeting of
the executive committee of tho board
of trade Monday evening considerable
routine business was transacted, and
it was arranged to call for a complete
report of the work of the sub-committees
at the next monthly meeting.
The meetings of the board are held at
the High school building In the office
of the superintendent of schools.
During the past week a large number
of blank petitions have been printed
and sent out addressed to P. W. Clem
ent, president of the Rutland road,
and to Lucius Tuttle, president of the
Boston & Maine, asking for the erec
tion of a "new and suitable passenger
station here, to be located on the west
side of the Doston & Maine tracks."
Nearly 1000 signatures have already
returned, and It is not probable the
railroads can long say they have never
been asked to furnish better facilities
here. In addition to the local signa
tures many have been sent in from
other towns whose residents have to
come here to take trains, and from
thoso living elsewhere whose business
Interests aro here. When completed
It will make a somewhat formidable
document, and ought to carry weight.
The Improved Towns Hotel.
The repairs and additions to the
Towns Hotel building aro progressing
slowly and it Is not now expected it
will be ready for occupancy until dur
ing February or March. When tho
lease to Darwin Ryder was first made
it was understood it would bo ready to
reopen Nov. 1. The delay promises to
be somewhat compensated for by the
first-class condition In which every
thing about It will bo when it is ready.
Tho new addition on the rear, for
kitchen, laundry and servants' quar
ters, Is enclosed and tho work of
finishing the Interior Is being done.
The plastering of every part of the old
building Is not as yet anywhere com
plete. Two large organizations which
wished to hold their annual meetings
here, and which Bellows Falls would
have delighted to have' had come here,
have had to arrange to go elsewhere,
although the preliminaries wero ar
ranged with the understanding tho
hotel was to bo ready. They are the
Vermont Dairymen's association and
the Connecticut River Valley Teach
ers' association, each of which have
from 200 to 300 attendants. Both were
to come in January.
Miss Mary Dascomb has been 111 for
the past two weeks. Her kinder
garten was In charge of Mrs. W. W.
Sawyer last week and thiB week in

after a visit of several weeks with her
daughter, Mrs. Grover, in Lowell,
Mass.
Dr. M. L. Morrison started last week
for Greenville, Pa., where his sister,
Mrs. Charles, was ill, but at Gardner
he received a telegram announcing her
death.
Miss Addle M. Zulll, for some years
a teacher in our town schools, Is in a
critical condition at hor home on
Centre street, from consumption. The
only other member of the family is a
brother.
The Young Men's club of the Con
gregational church hold their annual
banquet this evening in tho church
parlors, and the arrangements for the
FALLS NEWS
post prandial exercises aro of an In
teresting character.
Tho first snow of tho season camo
Tuesday night in regular blizzard
style. About 13 Inches fell and tho
sleighing Is excellent. Tho street
commissioner has used the snow roller
on all tho streets and they aro In flno
condition.
Miss Elizabeth Laughlln, tho train
ed nurso who has been caring for P.
H. Hadley during his wrestle with ty
phoid fever, has been taken 111 with
tho same disease. She is at Dr. Camp
boll's. Mr. Hadley Is gaining slowly,
so ho sits up a Httlo each day.
Rev. .1. II. Rcld has been in Clare
mont this week assisting tho Congre
gational pastor of that place In a series
of evangelistic services. Tho Claro
mont pastors and others will como
here In January to nsslst Mr. Reld In
holding similar services In his own
church.
Tho annual fair and supper of the
Unlversallst church ladles occurs next
week Tuesday afternoon and evening
nt Union hall. A class of 12 young
ladles arc at that time to graduato
from Miss Wayback's Fomalo Sem
inary as a part of the many attractions
offered.
Tho schools of tho village, with tho
exception of the High school and the
ninth grade close Friday of next week
for the holiday vacation of three
weeks. These schools keep ono week
longer, as they have 37 weeks In the
year instead of 3G, which Is tho school
year of tho others.
The telephone company have this
week had an agent hero again enn
vasslng among those whom they think
ought to have phones and arranged to
put In at once some over 30 on a three
months' trial free. This was done last
year, about GO having been put In upon
similar terms. Of those about 70 per
cent wero retained permanently.
Miss Florence Goodhue, who has
been teaching this term In the Allbee
district just north of here, took tho
primary departments of the Gagevillo
schools Monday. She will board with
tho family of J. A. Thwlng. Tho
Rockingham school board has decided
to discontinue the school In the Allbee
district and transport the pupils to tho
schools In this place.
N. A. Wheeler, who went to Water
bury, Vt., a few weeks ago to manage
a drug store, was taken violently 111
last week and his fnther went up the
day before Thanksgiving to care for
him, as his wife was here, she also
being 111. Mr. Wheeler was able to bo
brought to his father's home In this
place Monday. During II. A. Wheeler's
absence his place In the town agency
was filled by Capt. W. H. Taylor.
The livery stable property which
was stolen two weeks ago by Fred
White was located at various points
last week by H. A. Hatch, who was
ono of the victims, and most of It was
recovered. White had visited Ches
ter, Proctorsvllle, Ludlow and Clare
mont with the double rig and left It
In Newport, whero it was found.
White was found working in the woods
In Unity. He Is considered as unbal
anced and Irresponsible. He has not
been arrested.

two other Bellows Falls men, Clifton
Holmes and Robert Hastings, have
employment.
Rev. C. R. B. Dodge of the Baptist
church, who recently tendered his res
ignation, to take effect Jan. 1st, has
decided to remove tho time limit and
stay for the present as asked by
his church. He has this week
been working assiduously to se
cure pledges from his congregation to
pay tho balance of the lndebtness
caused by tho almost entire rebuild
ing of tho church edlflco two years
ago. The balance has stood at $1200,
and Mr. Dodge hopes to be able to
secure the amount at once so as to
leave tho church entirely free from
debt whenever he goes elsewhere.
Rural free delivery throughout the
town of Rockingham and a portion of
Westminster was inaugurated on
Monday and proves to bo an inova
tion highly appreciatd by tho farmers
along tho route. On Wednesday,
owing to the severe snowstorm of tho
night before a portion of tho roads

CANDY CATHARTIC
PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
STRIKING PASSAGES FROM
In considering Industrial conditions the
President sponks of the prosperity of the
last five years, but says such prosperity
can never be created by law alone. The j
welfare of tho citizen nnd the nation
must rest upon Indlvldunl thrift, energy,
resolution nnd Intelligence. Nothing can i
take the place of this Indlvldunl capacity;
but wise legislation nnd honest nnd Intel
ligent administration can give It the full
est scope, the largest opportunity to work
to good effect.
The President shows that the tremen
dous and highly complex Industrial de
velopment has brought serious problems
and changed conditions.
The upbuilding of the great Industrial
centres has meant a startling Increase,
not merely In the aggregate of wealth,
but In tho number of very large Individ
ual, nnd especially of very larpo cor
porate, fortunes. The creation of these
Rrent corporate fortunes has not been due
to the tariff nor any other governmcntnl
action, but to natural causes In the busi
ness world, operating In other countries
as they operate In our own.
The President believes that much of
the nntnRonlsm to Industrial corpora
tions Is without warrant. A fortune ac
cumulated In legitimate business enn be
accumulated by the person specially ben
efitted only on condition of conferring
Imense Incidental benefits upon others.
Successful enterprise, of tho type which
benefits all mankind, can only exist If tho
conditions nre such ns to offer great
prizes as the rewards of success.
The captains of Industry who have
driven the railway systems across this
continent, who hnve built up our com
merce, who have developed our manufac
tures, have on tho whole done great good
to our people. Without them the material
development of which wo are so Justly
proud could never have taken place.
Moreover, we should recognize the lm
Immense Incidental- benefits upon others,
velopment of leaving ns unhnmpered ns
Is compatible with the public good the
strong and forceful men upon whom the
success of business operations Inevitably
rests. ' The sIlKhtest study of business
conditions will satisfy nnyono capable of
forming n Judgment that the personal
equation Is the most Important factor In
a business operation; that the business
ability of tho man nt tho head of any
business concern, big or little, Is usually
the factor which fixes tho gulf between
striking success nnd hopeless failure.
Moreover, It cannot too often be point
ed out that to strike with Ignorant vlo
lenco nt the Interests of one set of men
almost Inevitably endangers the Interests
of all. The fundamental rule In our na
tional life tho rule which underlies nil
others Is that, on the whole, and In tho
long run, we shnll go up or down to
gether. Tho President goes on to advo
cate caution In dealing with tho great In
dustrial combinations.
Publicity for the Trusts.
There Is a widespread conviction In tho
mlmlH of the American people that tho
great corporations known as trusts aro
In certain of their features and tenden
cies hurtful to the general welfare.
It Is lmsed upon sincere conviction that
combination and concentration should be,
not prohibited, but supervised nnd within
rensonnblo limits controlled; nnd In my
Judgment this conviction Is right. It Is
no limitation upon property rights or
freedom of contract to require that when
men receive from government the prlvl
Iego of doing business under corporate
form, which frees them from Indlvldunl
responsibility, nnd ennbles them to call
Into their enterprise tho capital of the
public, they shnll do so upon absolutely
truthful representations ns to the value
of tho property In which the capital Is to
be Invested. Corporations engaged in In
terstate commerce should be regulated If
they aro found to exercise a llcenso work
ing to tho public Injury. It should bo ns
much the aim of thoso who seek for so
cial betterment to rid tho business world
of crimes of cunning as to rid tho en
tire body politic of crimes of violence.
Great corporations exist only because
they aro created and safeguarded by our
Institutions; nnd It Is therefore our right
nnd our duty to seo that they work In
harmony with these Institutions.
Tho first essential In determining how
to deal with the great Industrial com
binations Is knowledge of tho facts pub
licity. In tho Interest of the public, the
government should have tho right to In
spect and examine tho workings of tho
great corporations engaged in Interstate
business, rubllclty Is tho only sure reme
dy which we can now invoke. What fur
ther remedies are needed In the way of
governmental regulation or taxation can
only be determined after publicity has
been obtained, by process of law, and In
the course of administration. The first
requisite Is knowledge, full and complete
knowledge which may bo made public
to the world. Artificial bodies, such as
corporations and Joint stock or other
asosclatlons, depending upon any statu
tory law for their existence or privileges,
should be subject to proper governmental
supervision, and full and accurate Infor
mation ns to their operations should be
made public regularly at reasonable In
tervals. The President believes the large cor
porations, commonly called trusts, ought
to be subject to federal supervision. This
Is especially true, he continues, where the
corporation derives a portion of Its
wealth from the existence of some mo
nopolistic element or tendency In Its
business. There would be no hardship
In such supervision; banks are subject
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
to It, In their case It Is now accepted
us a simple matter of course. Indeed, It
Is probable that supervision of corpora
tions by the national government need
not go so fur as Is now the caso with the
supervision exercised over them by so
conservative a state as Massachusetts,
In order to produce excellent results.
The President says that If, however, the
Judgment of the Congress Is that It lacks
the constitutional power to pass such an
net. then a constitutional amendment
should be submitted to confer tho power.
The Tariff.
Thoro Is general acquiescence In our
present tnrlff system ns a national policy.
Tho first requisite to our prosperity Is
the continuity and stnblllty of this econo
mic policy. Nothing could bo moro un
wise than to disturb the business Inter
ests of the country by any general tariff
change nt this time. Doubt, apprehen
sion, uncertainty nro exactly what we
most wish to avoid In tho Interest of our
commercial and material well-being. Our
exMrlence In the past hns shown that
sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt
to produce conditions closely approaching
panic In the business world. Yet it Is
not only possible, but eminently desir
able, to combine with tho stnblllty of our
economic system a supplementary system
of reciprocal benefit nnd obligation with
other nations. Such reciprocity Is nn In
cident and result of the firm establish
ment and preservation of our present
economic policy. It wns specially pro
vided for In the present tariff law.
Reciprocity must be treated as the
hnnd-mnlden of protection. Our first duty
Is to see that the protection granted by
the tnrlff In, every case where It Is needed
Is maintained, and that reciprocity bo
sought for so far as It can safely be done
without Injury to our home Industries.
Just how far this Is must be determined
nccordlng to individual case, remember
ing always that every application of our
tnrlff policy to meet our shifting natlonnl
needs must be conditioned upon the car
dinal fact that the duties must never be
reduced below the point that will cover
the difference between the labor cost
here nnd nbroad. The well-being of tho
wage-worker is a prime consideration of
our entire policy of economic legislation.
Tho customers to whom wo dispose of
our surplus products In tho long run, di
rectly or Indirectly, purchase those sur
plus products by giving us somothlng In
return. Their ability to purchaso our
products should as far ns possible be se
cured by so arranging our tariff as to
ennble us to tako from them those pro
ducts which wo can use without harm to
our own Industries nnd labor, or the uso
of which will be of marked benefit to us.
The natural line of development for a
policy of reciprocity will bo In connec
tion with thoso of our productions which
no longer require nil of the support once
needed to establish them upon a sound
basis, nnd with thoso others whero either
because of natural or of economic causes
wo nre beyond the reach ot successful
competition.
The Philippines.
In tho Philippines our problem Is larger.
They nre very rich tropical Islands, in
habited by many vnrylng tribes, repre
senting widely different stages of pro
gress toward civilization. Our earnest
effort Is to help theso people upward
along tho stormy and difficult path that
leads to self-government. Wo hope to
mnko our administration of tho Islands
honorable, to our nation by making It of
tho highest benefit to tho Filipinos them
selves; nnd as an earnest of what we
Intend to do, wo point to what wo hnvo
done. Already a greater measure of ma
terial prosperity and of governmental
honesty and efficiency has been attained

their history.
It Is no light task for a nation to
achieve tho temperamental qualities
without which the Institutions of free
government are but an empty mockery.
Our peoplo nro now successfully govern
ing themselves, because for more-than a
thousand years they have been slowly
fitting themselves, sometimes consciously,
sometimes unconsciously, toward this
end. What hns taken us thirty genera
tions to achieve, we cannot expect to see
another race accomplish out of hand,
especially when large portions of that
race start very far behind tho point
which our .ancestors had reached even
thirty generations ago. In dealing with
the Philippine peoplo we must show both
patlenco and strength, forbearance and
steadfast resolution. Our aim Is high.
We do not desire to do for tho islanders
merely what has elsewhere been done
for tropic peoples by even the best for
eign governments. We hope to do for
them what has never before been done
for nny people of the tropics to make
them fit for self government after the
fashion of the really free nations.
History may safely be challenged to
show a single Instance In which a master
ful race such as ours, having been forced
by tho exigencies of war to take posses
sion of an alien land, has behaved to Its
Inhabitants with the disinterested zeal
for their progress that our people have
shown in tho Philippines. To leave the
Islands at this time would mean that they
would fall Into a welter of murderous
anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our
part would be a crime against humanity.
The character of Governor Taft and of
his associates and subordinates Is a proof,
If such be needed, of the sincerity of our
effort to glvo the Islanders a constantly
Increasing measure of self government,
exactly as fast as they show themselves
fit to exercise It. Since the civil govern
ment was established not an appointment
has been made In the islands with any
reference to considerations of political
influence, or to aught else save tho fitness
of the man and the needs of the service.

was held in the Unlversallst church last

wherever the people see fit to have

the provisions of tho law to the full let
ter and extent.
