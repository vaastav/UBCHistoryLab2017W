C The first of the 19C6 styles of the Peerless
Knabe Piano are now on display. * The instru-
ments pictured above, designated as Knabe
Piano, Style •* W," is beyond question the
most artistic creation of this famous factory.
Its case, "Old English" in design— of the . •
richest of mahoganies — is considerably small-
er in dimensions than former models and is
finished without polish, or in the New Art
style.
d In tone, the new Style "W" is a revela-
lation. Full and powerful, it possesses all of
the-character of thatof the grand piano, meeting
every requirement ' 'of) the heaviest fortis-
simos, retaining at the same time that purity
and liquid sweetness; that living, singing
quality so abundantly present in Knabe crea-
tions "and without which no piano can be
truly great.
<L The action of the Style "W " is the per- ,
fection of elasticity and responsiveness. In
its mechanical construction it is the scientific
adaption of the Knabe Grand action applied
to the upright piano. The same perfection
of touch, rapidity of repetition and delicacy
are present, making it ideal in every detail.
CL The Style " W f V Knabe is particularly
adapted, by reason of its size, to small homes
and apartments where the question of. space
is of importance. The elegant simplicity of
its architecture, the satin-like finish of its
case, insure a perfect harmony with the
surroundings of the modern home.
C The price of the Style "W" Knabe is
$525.00. Easy payments may be arranged.
G. Store will be open evenings until after
the Holidays.

Ine that he be given nn opportunity to
go on the stand and testify a« to bis
attempt, as described by Thomas F.
Ryan, to share In Ryan's holdings In
the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
The committee replied that this re
quest would be granted and Mr. Ilarrl
nian may testify to-morrow.-
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.— Two incidents
affecting the life insurance situation in
New York to-day overshadowed the leg
islative investigation! While the commit*
tee was inquiring' into the conduct of the
Prudential Life Insurance Company and
the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
George W. Perkins resigned as first vice
president and chairman of the finance
committee of the New York Life Insur
ance Company. He was succeeded as vice
president by Alexander E. Orr, president
of the New York City Rapid Transit
Commission, and as chairman of the
finance committee by John Claflin, - head
of the H. B. Claflin Company.
Another important move in the situation
was the election by the trustees of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company to-day
of Charles A. Peabody to succeed Rich
ard A. McCurdy as president of that
company at $60,000 a year. McCurdy'e
salary was $150,000. Peabody is a lawyer,
the American representative of William
Waldorf Astor and a director in several
banks and other corporations, of which
one is the Illinois Central Railroad Com
pany. Peabody also was nominated as a
trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company to succeed Justice Rufus W.
Peckham, and Emory McClintock was
nominated to succeed Elihu Root. They
cannot be elected as trustees until the
next meeting of the board.
United States Senator John P. Dryden
of New Jersey, president of the Pruden
tial Life Insurance Company, again tes
tified before the investigating committee
to-day and made a statement to the com
mittee, giving his reasons for favoring
Federal supervision of life insurance com
panies through a national insurance de
partment, which, he said, should have au
thority over them. This, he said, would
benefit both the companies and the in
sured. — .
The tendency of the holders of indus
trial policies in the Prudential and Met
ropolitan Life Insurance Companies to
lapse was examined in great detail by
Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the com
mittee, who read a statement by the Pru
dential that ' 37 per cent of its industrial
policies lapse within five years of their
Issue. Senator Dryden declared there
-ras much to be regretted,, from the
\u25a0.tandpoint of the company as well as
that of the insured, and that the ten
dency now, was toward a greater persist
ency* on the part of the Industrial hold
ers than formerly. The Senator asserted
that industrial insurance, even with high
rates and the tendency to lapse, was the
greatest economic force now in operation
in this country.
Just before adjournment to-day Haley
Flske, vice president of the Metropolitan
Company, told of an incident in which
that company commissioned William A.
Read to buy 3333 chares of railroad stock
for the company. Flske said that Read
the same day sold n the stock to a com
pany of brokers at>slo a share less than
it had been sold for to the -Metropolitan.
Fislce said he tried to get the money
back, but Read refused to 'surrender it.

State: /
OTTAWA, Kans., Dec. 13. — Governor w\ E.
Hoch. speaking here last night at a gathering
of Republicans, said: ,
"At this time the Kansas oil field is yield-
Ing 60,000 barrels a day, an Insigniflcantlpart
of Us capacity, and for. this oil the Standard
Oil Company, which sets the price. Is paying
less than one-third what it paid a year ago.
I believe it could pay $1 per barrel more for
this oil than it is paying and ' still make a
Urge profit. In other words, it is robbing
the people of ?CO,OOO a day. or $22,000,000 a
year. We sit supinely down while we are
being robbed of enough money every day by
this one large corporation to build one hundred
homes for the homeless . or to rear a jrreat

; Leader I of the Minority
SEQUEL TO REJECTION
OF RAIL RATE BILL
Quarrel Begun at Last
Session of Congress Gives
the Republican Members
Four Hours of Amusement
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.— Tho "washing
of t Democratic linen for the amusement
of Republicans," as Williams, the minor
ity leader, put it on ; Monday, occupied
the attention of the House for more than
four hours to-day. The result accom
plished was a "den" thrown at the minor
ity leader by Representative Laraar of
Florida and another by Representative
Shackleford of Missouri. The complaint
of. both resulted from the failure of ..Wil
liams to recommend their appointment as
members of the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce. Both made long
speeches, in which Williams' leadership
was assailed from many points. •
Williams replied to Laraar at pome
length, and briefly to Shackleford. His
defense was that at the last session the
Democrats on this committee were divided
and he deemed it necessary for the good
of the party and the country that a
united minority report should be made on
the subject of railroad rate legislation..
At times there was' high tension in the 1
debate. Lamar was particularly bitter in
his criticism and openly declared that his
personal friendship for Williams was for
ever at an end unless the criticism, of him
self were retracted. He, however, would
recognize Williams as the party leader.
Shackleford denounced all bosses and
placed himself entirely independent of
party leadership in the House.
LAMAR BEGINS THE\ ATTACK.
Lamar said that he did not agree with
Williams that Republicans would enjoy
personalities between Democrats. . Em
phasizing this, he referred to the personal
debate of \last session between Sullivan
of Massachusetts and Hearst of New;
York. At that time, s he charged, the
minority leader . had made ;no objection
to the procedure. ._
Lamar said that he considered his re
moval from thp Commerce Committee an
act absolutely* untenable and an asper
sion upon his private character.. It had
gone to the country through the press
that the minority leader . would not tol
erate followers of Hearst. \u25a0 , „ ,
Williams was at once recognized to re
ply. * '
"I am," he said, "about to perform a
very unpleasant duty, and one as to the
wisdom of which I have serious doubts.
The gentleman takes himself too serious
ly. He thinks he can make a national
issue out of a committee assignment, but
he cannot do it. He thinks he was re
moved, but he was not. There was.no
committee."
Williams asked if he w6uld not have
been lacking in moral couTage, in every
essential of a floor leader, if he had
made up a minority membership of the
Commerce Committee .which would
have been divided four to two on the
question of railroad rates.
"My brother would have 'gone off
that "committee under similar circum- !
stances," said he, and he added. that if
the Hearst bill received tha minority
support in committee he would have
supported it in caucus. Conversion to
the Hearst bill he likened to the con
version of Saul on his way to Damas
cus, It was inspired, he declared.
HOUSE APPLAUDS WILEUMS.
Applause followed Williams when' he
Baid he had not allowed personalities
I 'to influence his transaction of public
service. He referred to : the committee
appointments of Hearst — Labor and Ir
rigation of Arid Lands— and admitted ]
that he did not love Hearst.
"Why should I love a millionaire
who owns many newspapers which he
seems "to be devoting to tearing me
down?" he asked. \
Lamar at once asked for recognition,
as did Shackleford. Lamar was rec
ognized. He spoke with feeling and
charged that the minority leader had
called the rate bill caucus of last ses
sion because he was angry at being
turned 1 down by his colleagues on the
Miles amendment. ;
"It was not a caucus; it was a gold
brick," he said.
Williams interrupted to caution La
mar and"""to prevent unpleasant things
from happening," . adding that "the
gentleman is not permitted to use in
sulting language on. the floor of the
House."
Lamar referred to a letter of criti
cism of Hearst by Williams. The lat
ter denied the criticism. During this
denial Shackleford commended Hearst
personally and for his rate bill. He
said he was glad to see .that President
Roosevelt in his message had "come
around to the Hearst bilL"
"The word of one Missouri Democrat
is equal to that of two leaders," was a
retort of Shackleford to a statement
of Williams denying the use of certain
language at the St. Louis convention.
.."In Missouri we have raised the cry,
'Down" with the bosses/-" declared
Shackleford, who insisted that the
wishes of his constituents were much
more to him than the leadership of
Williams.
DEN'UXCIATIOX OF BOSSES. 3
{Continuing his denunciation of bosses,
Shackleford said it was the McCalls
and McCurdys who prevented the ejec
tion of W. J. Bryan as President and
that H. H, Rogers and J." Pierpont Mor
gan would be delighted - to . have the
Democracy of ; the 'country under the
control- of' one: boss. I :
Williams said he had enough and did
not desire to reply. The past had gone.
He looked to -the future and believed
that ' this; year r there 'would i be foand
six Democrats' , on , a committee who
would agree. , He , was of discord.
"We Jare represented 3 now lin all the
funny papers of the country as a 7a 7 don
key,", be : said. ;"The trouble is,",? turning
to the Republican* side' of \u25a0; tho chamber,
."that,? the - people " ; of the country.^! are
tired of • you and are afraid . of us, and
it is partially on account of such things
as ; happened here this morning that it
is afraid of us." " \u25a0
; The" Democratic party, - said Williams,

WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.— A call for a
Republican caucus to be held in the
hall, of the "House to-morrow at the

The House Committee on Territories
to-day named Hamilton, Brick. Pow
ers, Moon of Tennessee and Lloyd # aa a
sub-committee to consider bills for the
admission of the four Terrftories as
two State's.

llnger-Stone amendment, which pre
vents the sale and manufacture of
liquor In. the proposed State for twen
ty-one years and after that time only
by adoption of an amendment to the
State, constitution.

STEALS TO PAY
MONEY SHARKS
CHICAGO, Decv- 13.— William J. Smith,
for twelve years confidential tookkeeper
for the Robert SUvenson Drug Company,
was yesterday arrested for forgery. Al
though he had taken almost J3OOO from
the funds of the company in less than a
year, little or none of It was spent on
himself, as was evidenced by his appear
ance when arrested. His clothing was
old and worn and his overcoat was not
warm enough to protect him from, the
cold. Smith lived with his wife and two
children in a cottage.
"The money all went to the loan
sharks." he said. "They kept threatening
to garnlshee my wages, and I knew if
that happened I would lose my Job and
be able to-do nothing for my children.
"My first false step was taken about
three years ago. when a friend of mine
invented a candy slot machine." Smith
added. "I borrowed $200 from the money
lenders and signed a note for $33), which
he borrowed to put the machine on the
market. Well, It fell through. I lost my
$200, , my friend disappeared and I yas at
the mercy of the money lenders. All the
money I took was paid to them.- I did
not get any of It, neither did my wife and "
children..
"I shall make a clean breast of it," aaid
Smith. "I guess I can do my family as
much good while in the penitentiary as
I have in the last year." _ .
