M'NAMARA'S CONFESSION
TLos Angeles, Deb. 5.-Jamnes 13. McNamara's brief ,o nfession, penned
by his own hand late yesterday and bearing many evidences of small
skill, in letters, was made public today. It is as, foilows:
-I",' Jam$q B. McNamana, defendant in the caii of the people, having
heretofore plead guilty to the crime of murderp,.a$ire'tt make this state
ment of facts:
"And this is the truth. On the night of Septetber 30, 1910, at 5:45 p.
m., t plaoed tin. Ink alley, a portion of the Times building, a suitcase con
taining 16 stioks of 80 per cent dynamite, set to explode at 1 o'clock
the next morning, it was my intention to injure the building and scare
the owner. I did not intend to take the life of anyone. I sincerely re
gret that these unfortunate men lost their lives. If the giving of my
life would bring them back, I would gladly give it. In fact, in pleading
guilty to murder in the first degree, I have placed my life in the hands
of the state. "(Signed.) JAMES B. M'NiAMARA."
The confession covers one side of an ordinary sheet of paper and was
written with a fountain pen supplied by one of the attorneys.
'Los Angeles, Dec. 5.-Two brothers
-James Barnabas and John J. McNa
mara, natives of Cincinnati, Ohio, the
one slim,. droop-shouldered' and sal
low-faced, with small eyes, and the
other,, a broad, robust man of ruddy
countenance-felt today the strong
hand of justice which they long had
thought to evade, the former being
sentenced to imprisonment for life and
the latter to 15 years in the state pen
itentiary.
It was the retaliatory action of the
law against those lawless methods
which John' J. McNamara, secretary
treasurer of the International Asso
clation of Bridge and Structural Iron
Workers, thought necessary to pursue
in coping with what he regar'ded as
the all-powerful opposition of capital.
Though the younger brother, James
B., in formally (presenting his confes
sion to the court today declared that
he intended no murder when he placed
16 sticks of dynamite beneath the Los
Angeles Times building on October 1,
1910,, which killed 21 persons by its
terrific explosion, John J. McNamara,
recounting tonight to his attorneys
his principles, broke down as he mut
tered that he fought against great
odds in the best way be could. It was
a sequel to the courtroom scene earlier
today when he received his sentence in
tears of abject surrender.
For the crime of the Times building
explosion James B. was punished; for
directing the destruction 2y dynamite
of the Llewellyn iron works, wherein
no lives were lost, John J. was sen
tenced. Only a few hours had passed
when the word went forth that sub
poenas would be issued for both men
to appear before the federal grand
jury to.divulge further details of their
dynamiting conspiracies.
The United States government now
will demand of them information con
cerning interstate trafficking in dyn
amite which is alleged to have resulted
in more than 10i explosions at bridges
and factories where the warfare was
on.
Something of the same fear of ter
rorism brought by those explosions
flitted through a crowd of nearly
15,000 ipersons today as it surged back

PROBE, COMMITTEES TO REPORT
gay. .
REP. T.W. tIARPWtCK
'Twenty-five investigation committees which have during the past few months been investigating as many dis
puted subjects will report to the house of representatives during the opening days of congress. Bitter party strife
is sure to be engendered when these reports come up for debate. In many cases additional appropriations will be
necessary if the work is to be continued, to a point wt ere they will be able to render as complete a report as they
would like. In some of these cases it is stated on good althortty that the appropriations will not be forthcoming
and that. the partial reports will have to be the end of the committee's work.
A fight is oh in the steel trust investigation committee under Chairman Stanley, and Representative Martin
Littleton with others contends that this investigation, which has brought forth so many important disclosures dur.
ing the last few weeks, is utterly without excuse for existence because of the fact that the federal court has taken
up the prosecution and therefore the oommittee il of no avail.
Other special committees include the Graham committee, investigating the affairs pertaining to the Controller
bay in Alaska, and the Hardwick committee, investigating the sugar trust.

Mexico City, Dec. 5.-General Ber

Just where he is- and just where he

cial statement. Instead of mani

GOMPERS IS GLAD
DEATH SENTENCE
WASN'T GIVEN
DECLARES BELIEF THAT THE
JUDGMENT OF THE COURT
FITS THE M'INAMARAS.
New York, Dec. 5.-"I am glad a
death sentence was not imposed, I am
opposed to capital punishment under
any circumstances. I think the sen
tences received by both men were ap
propriate to the crime."
This was the comment of Samuel
Gompers when asked tonight if he
I was satisfied with the punishment
meted out to the McNamara brothers
in Los Angeles today. Mr. Gompers
cand Frank Morrison, secretary of the
American Federation of Labor, expect
ed to return to Washington tonight
after a conference with Alton B.
Parkol., their counsel in the Buck Stove
& Range compa)ny case, for which both
men will have to answer to the court
several days hence.
"I would like to make one statenrent,"
Mr. Gompers continued, "and that is
concerning the strictures made by Dis
trict Attorney Miller of Indianapolis as
to the wisdom of my leadership otfthe
American Federation of Labor. I want
to say that if Miller has a case to
prosecute against me or anybody else,
let him go ahead and prosecqte; but it
is not for him to say whether my lead
ership is wise or not. I consider his
criticism a gratuitous and unwarranted
impertinence. Miller has no right to
set himself up as a guide. I propose
to stand true to the men of labor."
Mr. Gompers was asked if it were
true that he and other labor leaders
were advising "an era of pacification"
in the matter'of calling strikes in the
future, until the country had forgotten
the McNamart case.
Desire 'Peace.
"All I can say to that," be replied,
"is that when @mployers treat labor as
fairly as organised Ipbor treats the
employers, then there will be peace.
The executive committee of the Ameri
ca Federation of Ldbor is the greatest
conciliatory body that ever existed any
where. It desires peace and is always
ready to meet employers half way."

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CON
GRESS DEALS EXCLUSIVELY
WITH THE TRUSTS.
Washington, Dec. 5.-President Taft's
message on the trusts was read in both
branches of congress today and was
generally well received.'The president's
objection to a repeal of the Sherman
law was approved by some of the lead
ers on both sides, although the demo
crats held that his first message should
have dealth with the tariff.
Democratic Leader Underwood said
the president and the administration
were trying to dvershadow the tariff
with trust issues.
"The message is an able one from
the president"s standpoint,'" Mr. Un
derwood said, "but we feel that the
leading message should have dealt with I
the tariff. There seems to be an ef
fort on the part of the president ard
the administration to force trzust Is
sues ahead. 1 am opposed to a repeal
of'the Sherman law, but there may be
supplemental legislation to define it. T
think the house does not favor a fed- 1
eral Incorporation act."
Mann Has Praise.
Speaker Clark said he could not dis
ques the message until he had studied
it thoroughly., Republican Leader
Mann, ,who has not always agreed
with the. president,"praised the mess
age.
"It is probably the strongest utter
I ance President Taft has ever made,"
he said. "It showse that he is on the
fide of the people; that he is not con
trolled by the trusts and thathe does
not wish to caulse 'undue violence to
proper combinations 'of capital."
In the house, the reading of the
message was interrupted by applause
from the republican side. As the read
ing clerk was droning through the
10,000 words a majority of the mem
bers were following the reading from
printed copies which had .been dis
t tributed to their desks.

FRED WHITESIDE MAKES SE.l

Chicago, Dec. &-Sensalonal charges
that "the bureaucr -ic- system of the
depar'tment of the Interl'r together
with red tape" was reti4loig the irri
gation projects of the .cquntry, and
that thousands ofpersons in Montana
r are starving because of the system,
were made before the National Irri
gation congress at its opening session
today. Fred Whiteside, a state sen
ator from Flathead county anrl a dele
gate from Montana, said that 50 per
cent, of the money spent by the gov
- ernment on irrigatioh was for "super
S vision" and that in one Instance 17
d supervisors. were employed' to Ewatehc
eight men dig a tunnel. The Milk river
e project in northern Montana, he: said.
e although begun in 1903, is not any
-,where near completed, as only 2,000
e out of the 240.000 acres had been

been done.

years, has won the confidence of the
people. The Spokane case was Con
sidered carefully by the commission for
years. Conclusions were tested by ap
plication to actual business, before be
ing ordcred into effect. And yet the
raw commerce court, without special
experience, on a brief hearing, enjoined
this carefully considered and thor
oughly tested order.
"The court is superfuou,, has ex
ceeded grossly its authority and con.
stantly will be prone to arrogate to
itself functions a high do. not belong
