IN THREE MONTHS VESSELS
SHOW INCREASE OF 17
PER CENT.
RAILROADS ARE BIG LOSERS
Authorized Statement by President
Sproule of Southern Pacific as to
Commerce Changes—Foreign
Trade Depends on War.
San Francisco.—Competition be
tween the transcontinental railroads
and the steamship companies using
the Panama canal has become so keen,
and its results are making themselves
felt in such far-reaching fashion that
President William Sproule of the
Southern Pacific company, in an au
thorized interview here, said:
"The commerce of the Pacific coast
is in the throes of a transportation
crisis.
"It was assumed in advance that the
steamship lines would reach out suc
cessfully for bulk cargoes and imper
ishable foodstuffs, such as grain, on
ions, potatoes and unrefined sugar,
but within the week one of the big
gest companies has announced that it
is in the market for fruit and vege
tables, hitherto shipped by rail in re
frigerated cars. This commerce has
been one of the most valuable reve
nue producers the railways have had.
"The tonnage from California to the
Atlantic seaboard," said President
Sproule, "by sea and rail combined,
in August, September and October of
1913 was 120,000. Of this the rail
roads got 67,000 tons, or 56 per cent,
and the sea carriers got 53,000 tons,
or 44 per cent.
"For the same period in 1914 the

total tonnage was 170,000. Of this the
railroads got 67,000 tons, or 39 per
cent, and the sea carriers got 103,000,
or 61 per cent." The increased total
President Sproule attributed to bet
ter crops.
Thus, the sea carriers' proportion
ate takings of the total tonnage from
California for these three months," he
continued, ''increased 17 per cent,
while the percentage of tonnage by
rail decreased to the same extent."
As to what will become of the saving
made by water transportation he said :
"The eastern buyer will absorb the
reduction in cost of carriage. It is
not likely that new manufactures will
be stimulated because of our higher
wage scale and higher standard of in
dividual living. On the contrary, this
market is likely to be crowded with
the production of eastern manufac
turers.
"With respect to our foreign trade,
the effect of the canal can not be de
termined until the European war
ends."
BUSINESS MAN KILLS 2 IN COURT
Harry E. Carr of Leavenworth Slays
C. D. Franklin and J. C. Parsons.
Wenatchee, Wash., Dec. 7.—Harry
E. Carr, a well-known business man of
Leavenworth, shot and killed C. D.
Franklin and J. C. Parsons at Cash
mere Monday.
The shooting occurred in the court
room just before the time for the trial
of C. D. Franklin on a charge of
wronging Gladys Guest, 10-year-old
daughter of William S. Guest of Leav
enworth. J. C. Parsons was a well
known rancher of Cashmere. He had
been drawn as a juror in the case and
had taken his seat a few minutes be
fore. His death was an accident, the
bullet striking him having been aimed
by Carr at the defendant, Franklin.
The reason why the world owes so
great a debt to idealists and dreamers
is because they are such blamed poor
collectors, as a class.
NATIONAL SECURITY BOARD OP
POSED BY PRESIDENT WILSON
AS UNTIMELY.
CONGRESS IS INVESTIGATING
Executive Favors Fullest Query of
Military Conditions by Congres
sional Committees—Internation
al Impressions to Be Heeded.
Washington, De 8.—Preparedness
of the United States for war seems
destined for investigation in this ses
sion of congerss. Several bills and
resolutions bearing on the subject
were introduced a ad an inquiry by
congressional committees is regarded
at the capitol as certain, although the
president told Representative Gard
ner last Monday that he opposed the
latter's plan for an investigation bv
a national security commission.
The president expressed the opinion
that this would be an unwise way of
handling "a question which might cre
ate very unfavorable international im
pressions."
Senator Lodge introduced in the sen
ate a resolution similar to the Gard
ner measure pending in the house.
New Revolution in Mexico.
El Paso, Texas.—A new revolution
ary movement has been started in
Mexico, according to copies' of a proc
laination received here Monday and
signed by Jose Inez Salazar and Eme
lio P. Campa, two former federal gen
erals. They were reported at the head
of troops in Central Chihuahua, and

THIRD TIME DURING THE
SIXTY-THIRD SESSION.

That Date Many Republicans Think
Extra Session Likely Through
Spring and Summer.
«
Washington, Dec. 7.—-At noon Mon
day convened the third session of the
sixty-third congress, for which mem
bers of both houses flocked to Wash
ington, ending their holiday recess of
six weeks.
Democratic leaders in informal con
ference before the opening of the ses
sion, which is destined to be devoted
chiefly to appropriation measures,
have been unanimous in expressing
the hope that the legislative program
of necessities could be concluded by
March 4 next, when the present con
gress automatically will end.
Many republican leaders, however,
have stated that there were many im
portant measures which they would
urge for passage, and some indicated
that supply bills might be delayed to
such an extent that an extra session
next spring and summer would be
necessary.
Administration leaders awaited eag
erly the annual message of President
Wilson, delivered in joint session on
Tuesday, for a definite outline of the
President's wishes for legislation.
NORTH ATLANTIC HIT BY STORM
New York Badly Battered and Record
Tide Stops Shipping.
New York.—Huge seas, backed by
a mighty tire and a howling northeast
gale, battered the coasts of New York
Monday and Tuesday, smashing
houses, wrecking boats, flooding vil
lages, devastating summer resorts and
forcing transatlantic and coastwise
steamers to remain outside Sandy
Hook and fight the storm.
At Sandy Hook the wind attained a
velocity of 68 miles an hour, driving
in a record-breaking tide and making
it impossible for pilots to board in
coming vessels. In New York harbor
the tide was the highest in 13 years,
and the waves drove the Jersey
^rry boats to coyer andIs rewed the
shore of Staten Island with the wrecks
of scoies of small craft. In New
York city the wind blew at 48 miles
an hour—diminishing to 26 miles on
Tuesday night, with .. ^recast of a
shift in the gale, attended by more
rain or snow.
The worst damage in this vicinity
was suffered at Coney Island, where
the loss within the last 24 hours is
estimated at $200,000. Two or three
fine houses at Sea Gate were wrecked
despite the fight of a small army of
workmen to build defenses with hun
dreds of sandbags. The waves threw
them aside, rolled in and tore the
houses apart. Fifteen buildings along
Coney island had been damaged to
night, Including big bathing pävilions
and summer cottages.
Lesson of Life.
The lesson of life—and death—is
that the man who thinks highly of
his own value generally is the man
who is least valuable. For each of us
there is a substitute as capable as our
selves. The worker did well, but an
other exceeds and excels his work.
The truly great know this truth. The
small man imagines in his narrowness
and shallowness that he is indispen
sable.
