DRUNKEN INDIANS STILL NUM
EROUS. The fact that a man from this town
recently received a sentence to
serve a term in the prison at Car
son for selling whiskey to Indians
does not seem to be heeded by
others. That there is always some
degenerate who stands ever ready
to break the laws of the land in
this respect and endanger, pos
sibly, the lives of our citizens, is at
tested to by tne fact that before
Dalton, the self confessed culprit,
had hardly become accostumed to h s
prison garb, another of his kind lis
stepped into the business of dispens
ing whiskey to Indians in rpiantities
unlimited.
The officers succeeded in rounding
the drunken warriors up and landed
them in the place that cools, and
creates a large thirst for stuff other
i..a,i whiskey.
If these Indians were given the
opportunity of spending thirty days
repairing the county roads for each
offense, it reasonable to suppose
aat we would see fewer drunken
Indians. If not, we would "at least
have better roads, which would at
the least, be some satisfaction.

On thi first day of May. 104, the
i appellants here as plaintiffs in the
court below filedtherein their second
amended complaint: the matters al
leged therein and pertinent to this
an- mhi as umu.i.
j "That on or about the 24th day of
June, l'Jt2, the plaintms employed
said defendants, as such co-partners
as aforesaid, for fees and reward tJ
them by plaintiffs paid, to examine
and furnish to plaintiffs a true, accu
rate, full and correct abstract of the
title to that certain lot. piece or par
cel of land situate, lying and being

in the County of Washoe and State of

plainUff had tnerefore contracted
with one W. H. Hancock, who
claimed to be the owner thereof.
IV.
"That defendants in the perform
ance of the duties of such employ
ment, did thereafter and on or aboat
the 25th day of June, 1902, furnish
to plaintiffs a pretended abstract cf
title to the said land and did report
and represent to i.tjiuUffs that the
same was a full, tru, accurate and
correct abstract of title to said lanJ:
by which pretended abstract of title
it appeared and was shown that the
said W. H. Hancock was the owner
of said land and premises in fee sim
ple without any incumbrance in re
liance on said prenteded abstract of
title, and depending solely thereo.i,
plaintiffs were induced to and did.
on or about the 28th day of Juue.
1SD2, purchase said land and premises
from said Hancock and did pay him
therefor the sum of $1,100, in lawful
money of the United States, and as
evidence thereof, plaintiffs did then
and there take and receive from si' i
Hancock a certain deed or instrument
in writing, exected by said Han
cock and duly acknowledged, pur
porting to convey from said Hancock
to plaintiffs the said land and prem
ises in fee; that said deed or instru
ment in writing contains the
words "grant, bargain and sell," but
does not contain any other warranty
or covenant whatsoever and that
plaintiffs have not, nor has either of
them, ever at any time received any
othfr warranty or covenant from said
Hancock, or at all. relating to or con
cerning said lands or premises or
the title thereto.
V.
"That said Hancock was not the
owner of said lands or promises, or
of any interest therein whatever ex
cept a mere equitable interest as mort
gagee under and by virtue of a cer
tain indenture of mortgage, and tint
t:.' Bank .f Nevada, a corporation,
-vi s the owner in fee thereof and that
th- same appeared of record on tlu-
public .records of said Wahoe Coun
ty, of which plaintiffs were ignorant
and which defendants could, by tie1
exercise of proper diligence and skill
have discovered and which they failed
t-i discover by omitting to exercise
due care and skill; and defendants
wf-rc guilty of neglect and want of
due care in examining into, and in
the investigation of. the title of said
land.
VI.
"That the said mortgage by and
through which said Hancock held said
equitable interest as aforesaid was
was given 10 secure and did secure
the payment cf a certain promissory
note dated and executed November 1.
1SD7, and by its terms payable on de
mand. That the first plaintiff
or either of them discoved or learned
that said Hancock was not the owner
in fee of said lands and premises but
was the holder only of said equitable
interest as aforesaid, was on or about
the- day of February, 1904, and
more than six years after the date
and execution of said promissory
note, and after any action to foreclose
the said mortgage or to collect the
said note was barred by No 3718 of i ho
Compiled Laws of Nevada, of 1900.
and when the said equitable interest
which said Hancock held in and to
said lands and premises, as aforesaid,
had, without the fault of these plain
tiffs, or either of them, become of
no value whatever.
Vu.
"That said Hancock has failed and
refused and still does refuse to pay
to plaintiffs, and said plaintiffs have
not received from said Hancock, or
at a'.l. the said sum of $1,100 or any
part thereof.
VIII.
"That by reason of the said Han
cock's want of title, and the fact that
plaintiffs took no title by said deed
from Hancock, and the f;ct that s.iil
Bank of Nevada was the owner f
said lands and premises, as aforesaid,
the plaintiffs were ousied and disposs
essed of said lands and emises by
due course of law.
"Wherefore plaintiffs pray judg
ment against said defendants jointly
and severally, in lhe sum of $1100,
together with interest thereon at the
legal rate from the 2Sth. day of June,
1902, and for costs and disbursements
of suit."
To this complaint defendant filed a
general demurrer. The court sustained
the demurrer and on plaintiffs declin
ing to amend gave judgment for the
defendants. From said judgment th!s
