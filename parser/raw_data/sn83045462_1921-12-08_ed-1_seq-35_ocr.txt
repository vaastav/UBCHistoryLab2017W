Discusses Auto Accidents.
To the Editor of The Star:
I notice In one of your recent issues
that the Staunton Rotary Club Is on
the waipath against glaring auto head
lights.
Accidents are not primarily caused
by glaring headlights. It makes but
little difference to one accustomed to
drive at night whether a 21-candle
power headlight, which has been
adopted in many states and more re
cently in Massachusetts, is used or a
25 or even 32-candlepower. The main
thing is to see that lamps are not
elevated unnecessarily.
The driver, in any event, watcheB
only the extreme right edge of the
road, and keeps as close to that as
safety permits, and doing -this will
avoid accidents as far as two cars
passing are concerned. But the pe
destrian, who hasn't a chip on his
shoulder and really cares to live
should always walk on the left side of
the road, and not, as ninety-nine out
of a hundred now do, on the right
hand side. By doing this he Is en
abled to take care of himself and to
know unfailingly that a car Is ap
proaching, and he will not be blinded
by an approaching car and thus fail
to notice the car which so often
comes up in the rear and strikes him
when he has stepped the wrong way
in confusion.
Walking on the left side, with the
car coming behind him on the right,
he is perfectly safe so far as that car
Is concerned, and if the driver of the
car coming toward him has not seen
him In time and is unable to turn in
to avoid him he nearly always has
the opportunity of stepping oft the
road to avoid accident.

DIES AT AGE OF 90.
Benjamin Franklin Duvall, owner of
Trump Hill, and rich in his remi
niscences of ante-bellum days, died
Monday at his home near Marlbor
ough, Md. He was ninety years of
age.
Mr. Duvall was interested In hunt
ing, and was frequently host at fox
hunts held in his neighborhood. He
could vividly picture the days of the
slave markets and the events that oc
curred long before the civil war. He
was well known in the community.
Funeral services were held yesterday
afternoon at 3 o'clock, at St. Thomas' i

BILL EMBODIES TARIFF
CHANGES AS SUGGESTED
Smoot Amendments Offered Carry
Out proposals President Made
in His Message.
Suggestions made by President
Harding in his message to Congress i
for changes In the proposed new
tariff law, which would provide for
greater flexibility, were included in
amendments to the law offered Tuesday
in the Senate by Senator Smoot of
Utah.
One of Senator Smoot's amendments
would empower the President to pro- I
claim American valuation as the basis
for assessing duties at such time and
on such articles as deemed necessary.
The other iimendment offered by
the Utah senator gives the President
power to Increase or decrease iritport
rates as conditions, after a survey
ordered by the executive, show to be
warranted. Both propositions, Mr.
Smoot said, would be called before
the Senate immediately the tariff bill
is reported to that body.
Wide latitude is given the Presi
dent in the discretionary reduction or
increasing- of duties, the amendment
specifying that such changes are
authorized up to 50 per cent of the
rate fixed in the law. Changes deter
mined upon by the President would
become effective thirty days after be
ing proclaimed by the President, the
bill provides.
