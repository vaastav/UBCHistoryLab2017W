TREATY WITH TRANCE.
Representative Kelley, of Pennsylvania,
whose name is near the head of the speaker's
list of members desiring to move the adoption
of resolutions under suspension of the ru'es,
does not believe that the resolution which was
adopted on motion of representative Fernando
Wood last session, requesting the President to
negotiate a commercial treaty with France, ex
pressed the real sentiment of the House, there
having been no debate and only a slim attend
ance at that time, and he therefore intends to
offer the following resolution as soon ash ob
tains the floor to make the requisite motion:
Besolved, That it is the sense of this house
that negotiations by the executive department
of the government of a commercial treaty
whereby rates of du ty to be imposed upon
foreign commodities entering the United Strtes
for consumption should be fixed, would, in
view of the provision of section 7 of article 1 of
the constitution of the United States, be an in
fraction of the constitution and an invasion of
one of the highest prerogatives of the House of
Representatives.
MORMOH MEDDLING.
Evidence Accumulating of Mormon Inter
ference to Prevent a Peaceful Under
standing With the Utes.
Los PINOS AGENCY. Col., Nov 29, via. Lak
City, Col., Dec. 1.The commission is patient
ly waiting the arrival of the White River Utes.
Several proportions have been made by the In
dions through Ouray to return the stock and
property captured at White river, but all such
offers have been refused. Generals Hatch and
Adams will listen to no compromise. The sur
render of the guilty parties is the only propo
sition that will be entertained by them. Capt.
Stanley received the money of Mrs. Meeker,
from Douglas, through Chief Ouray, on his
own responsibility.
Ouray informs tbo commission that the
troops reported to him as advancing on the
Uintah Agency were Mormon militia that
they have arrived there and are trying to per
suade the Indians to renew the fight, offering
to join the Utes and furnish them with men
and arms. Jack is in camp twenty miles from
White River. Ouray thinks it doubtful about
his coming heie, as he is afraid of the commis
sion.
A special dispatch to the Denver Tribune
says that the White River Utes came into Los
Finos lost Saturday and went before the com
missioners. A new plan of examini ng the
witnesses has been adopted, and the number
allowed to enter the commission room at once
specified. They all wear arms, though con
cealed. The members of the commission and
attaches all keep gu ns and revolvers near that
may be used on quick notice. Great distrust
prevails on both sides, though both make an
effort to appear at ease and inspire confidence
on the part of the other side. Henry Jim, the
Indian who was interpretor at White River
agency, testified Saturday: Enow nothing of
the maasacre at the agency, but was at Milk
river and know that Jack ox Colorow led the
attack on Thornburgh. Th other Indians
present attempted to interrupt him and prompt
him while giving testimony, but he paid little
attention to them and told a straight story.
Douglass and Jack have not come in, ut are
expected to do so now.
MORMON INFLUENCE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.Secretary Schurz ie
oeived the following telegram from Gen. Hatch
to-day:
Los PINO S, Nov 29.The advance the
White River Utes are coming in. Word is sent
us that there seems to be more Mormon influ
ence than we at first supposed.
(Signed) HATCH.
KELLEY'S SILVER MANIA.
Arraignment cf the Administration for
Misrepresentations ot the Interview with
Bismarck,
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 2a.The remarkable
interview of Pig-iron Kelley with Bismarck,
published some time ago, has of late been
brought prominently before the country.
The Philadelphia Times makes the following
explicit statement in regard to that inter
view, and the result of its publication:
As the meetingof Congress approaches
the administration is overcome by a realizing
sense of the mistake it has made its neg
lect to execute the order of Congress and
invite an international conference on the
silver question. The report of Judge
Kelley's interview with Bismarck disolosed
to the country what the administration
might have done had it executed the law in
this respect. To break the force of this ex
posure the treasury and state depart
ments furnished the agents of the
Philadelphia and New York press
with stories that Kelley's report of the in
terview was full of inaccuracies that its
publication had angered Bismarck, and that
thus Mr. Walker, the agent whom the gov
ernment had at a recent day sent abroad had
been prevented from rendering the cause any
service. The falsehoods thus disseminated
were so glaring that Mr. Walker felt himself
called upon as a genteman to do justice to
Mr. Kelley. In the New York Graphic the
representative of the government denied, in
the most emphatic manner, the published
statement purporting to emanate from
him that Prinoe Bismarck had said
that Congressman Kelley had been guil
ty, not only of violating the secresy of
a private conversation, but of misrepresent
ing, in the newspaper for which he wrote,
the statement made by Bismarck in relation
to the remonetization of silver. Mr. Walker
also said that he was at a loss to account for
the circulation of such stories, and felt so
keenly the one reflecting on Mr. Kwlley's ve
racity that he had the evening before ad
dressed a communication to that gentleman
denying it. Such a statement from a rep
resentative of the state department, whose
action was said to have been thwarted,
should have put these absurd stories at rest,
and did so in the East. Bat now they are
revived in the West, and the Cin
cinnati Gazette, pleading for the dere
lict administration, not only repeats these
falsehoods, but exaggerates them. The ar
ticle in the Gazette of Thursday last, under
the caption of "Kelly and Bismarck," is, in
view of Mr. Walker's disclaimer, discredit
able to that paper and to the administration
that inspired it. Before this week closes
there will have been published Judge Keliy's
letters to the Times in pamphlet form. It
will then be discovered that the judge not
only maintains his statement, but in the
body of notes illustrative of the condition
of British and continental opinion on the
question of bi-metallism, gives special value
to his letters and a significance to the Bis
marck interview whioh will greatly enhance
the service he has rendered the world.
Tobacco Manufacturers' Convention.
CINCINNATI, Dec 1.The twelfth annual
meeting of the association of manufacturers
and dealers in leaf tobacco was held this after
noon. N recommendation was made to Con
gress for any change in the revenue laws, the
association congratulating itself on the reduc
tion of tax, which has given an impetus to the
tobacco trade. Dr. E W. Thom as was elected
a ain to the office of weigher and inspector.

IRELAND'S WRONGS.
A Grand Outpouring of Sympathizers at
Chicago
CHICAGO, Dec. 1.A meeting of citizens was
held at McCormick hall, to-night, Which broke
up at a late hour, the purpose being to express
sympathy with the people of Ireland in their
present acitation for relief from the oppression
of non-resident landowners. There was an im
mense audience in the large building and many
hundreds were unable to obtain admission.
The Irish-American element constituted a very
large portion of the audience, although
some of the most prominent Ameri
can born citizens occupied Beats on the plat
form and among the auditors. Speeches wero
made by Hon. Thos. Hay no, Lieutenant-Gov
ernor Shuman, A Leonard Swett and others,
all in a moderate tone, but expressing the
deepest interest in the posture of affairs in
Ireland and predicting that benefit to the
working classes of that island would eventuate
from tbe present disorder. A address was
issued to the people of the United States em
bodying in Btronger terms the ideas expressed
by the various speakers. I alludes to the
difficulties under which the Irish people labor
in procuring a living, to the hardships the
present land system and the legislation hostile
to their interests which has been enacted
to the numerous instances of personal cruelty
to tenants, to the decrease of population by
famine aud exodus, and to the gloomy situa
tion of to-day. I calls attention to the better
land laws of other countries, and protests
against tbe attempt of Beaconsfield to prevent
the last means left them to secure reform in
agitation I tasks that the United States offer
its effective aid in assisting the Irish people to
accomplish a peaceful revolution
against the landlord interest, supported
by Beaconsfield. I says Mr. Parnell and his
colleagues have proposed a iust and sensible
method for the desired settlement of affairs,
and the American people are pledged not to re
main deaf to the appeal for sympathy and re
form The Irish people are urged not to allow
zeal to outrun discretion, and are in conclusion
assured of support, not only of the people of
the United States, but of the civilised world.
BKEWERS BILKED.
A Devfs on that Requires Them to Pay Koj
alty for the Pitching Process.
MILWAUKE E, Dec. l.~In the United States
court Judge Dyer rendered his decision in the
case of Matthew Gottfreid, complainant, vs
The Philip Best Brewing company. In his
ruling the judge sustained the complainant's
patent. The decision is one of great impor
tance to the brewers as it makes them liable
for a royalty for the use of a process and ap
paratus which has been for several years in
operation in all large breweries, for pitching
the inner surface of all beer kegs and barrels.
The case may, however, be appealed to the su
preme court for a final review. Th sum
claimed by the plaintiff for the infringement
of his patent up to date and for royalty for
future use, is not yet determined. Th suits
in this city were against The Phillip Best Brew
ing company, The Schhtz Brewing company,
and Obermam & Co. I is understood that
other large breweries, including those in Illi
nois and other States, have stipulated to abide
by this decision, whatever it might be, subject
of course, to the confirmation by the supreme
court.
THE MAINE MUSS.
Tde Returning Hoard in SessionA Look at

AUOUSTA, Me, Dec. 1.The Senators and
Representatives elect, or their attorneys, from
all the counties of the State, assembled here
to-day. I addition there were large outside
delegations, including five ex-Governors, viz.:
Anson Morrell, Selden Connor, Lot M. Mor
rill, Joshua Chamberlain and Nelson Ding
ley. The executive council opened its session,
Foster, Brown, Chase and Fogg present. Th
first gentlemen who waited upon them were
aiessrB. Wing and Savage, on behalf of the
county of Androscoggin, to whom they exhib
ited the returns of the election of county offi
cers, and promised these and other gentlemen
to show the returns of Senators and Represen

A. Man Who Has Paid Out 960,000,009
pb'rom the Virginia (Nev.) Chronicle.l
For the past week or more Secretary Tay
lor, of the Bonanza mines, has been so sick
that he has been confined to his room.
Hence, when pay day came (which was yes
terday) he was so behind with his work that
he was compelled to defer paying until to
day. This surprised the employes, and gave
rise to rumors that the Bonanza firm was
about to suspend payment altogether.
This morning, however, when the $20,000
trays were placed on the table, and Mr. Tay
lor was seen at his post as usual, all fear was
rembved.
Mr. Taylor says he has been paying off
now for six years, during whioh time he has
disbursed over $60,000,000, and yesterday
was the first time he was ever a minute be
hind-hand. He has handled so much money
that he can tell by the weight of
a pile of twenties, without looking
at them at all, how much there
is in the lot. I paying off he has the gold
counted into $100 and $140 piles, and tbe
Silver into $4, $6 and $10 piles, so that he
can pass it out as fast as the men can come
up to the paying counter. So sensitive is he
to the weight of a pile of coin that some
times,, if a $10 stack of half dollars con
tains a few that are new, and consequently a
trifle heavier than the rest, he will stop and
count them over to see if there isn't some
mistake.
Slugged by Night Prowlers.
Two men came to the Chicago house on
Fourth street, kept by Patrick Flaherty, at
12 o'clock last night, and walking up stairs
to the room where the boarders sleep, de
manded beds. On being told to
see the the proprietor down stairs,
they, after some loud talk concluded
to go down. A boarder who followed them
to see that the door was properly fastened,
was struck in the face by one of the men
with some instrument, with such force
as to break his nose and inflict
a serious cut under his eye. The men then
ran in opposite directions. One was caught
at the corner of Robert and Fourth by Offi
cer Gruber, but the one who committed the
assault escaped.
Jay ,GonUl Receives a Donation.
S T. JOSEPH, Mo., Dec. 1.Jay Gould spent a
few hours here to-day inspecting his bridge and
other railroad property. sent a letter to
the board of trade, asking for a donation of
$30,000 aid in extending the Missouri Pacific to
this city. Ten thousand weie subscribed on
the spot, and the subscription increased to
$20,000 during the afternoon. Th whole
amount will be made up to-morrow, and the
track be laid at once. Mi. Gould will build a
new depot here during the coming year.
A ludicrous transposition occurred in the
make-up of a couple of telegraphic items in
the New Haven Journal aud Courier Mon
day, which produced the following effect:
The first item read, "A large cast iron wheel,
revolving 900 times per minute, exploded in
that city yesterday after along and painful
illness. Deceased was a prominent thirty
second degree Mason." This was followed
by the second item, whioh read, "John Fad
den, the well-known florist and real estate
broker of Newport, 11.1., died in Wardner &
Russell's sugar mill ac Crystal Lake, 111., on
Saturday, doing $3,000 damage to tbe buil
ding, and injuring several workmen and Lo
ienzo Wilcox fatally."'

LONDON, Dec. 1.The Times, i its finan

of the reviving capacity of Europe to counter

one million hundred weights of steel blocks

of affairs.
FRENCH POLITICS.
LONDO N, Bee 1.A Paris dispatch says the

iB generally considered as a friendly notice to
quit. Waddington, president of the council
and minister of foreign affairs, will be out of
office the early part of next year, and. perhaps
sooner, and Gambetta, president of the cham
ber of deputies, will then have an opportunity
of inauguarating a parliamentary government
under republican regime.
At the third sitting of the bureaux of four
groups of the Left, on Sunday, the following
points, on which the cabinet will be questioned,
were settled, namely: Modification of the prin
ciple of judicial irremovability, the transfer
of gendarmeries from the war ministry to that

the reactionary functionaries.
AUSTRIA AND ENGLAND.
LONDON, Dec. 1.A Vienna correspondent

There ought to be some system whereby the

even though the almanac says "moon." A it

and there isn't, the city is plunged in darkness.
Early last evening the city was positively un
safe either for teams or pedescrians, owing to
the darkness. Wouldn't it be just as well to
provide for lights when the moon is invisible,
even if the calendar calls for the silvery ball.

CHICAGO, Dec. 1.Cables were stronger and
higher, and the market firmer from the open
ing. There were very small deliveries. Cap
ital is under the deal, and there is no pressure
to ut the property on the market either for
cash or the option on the curb. January sold
at 1.25.
The large deliveries of corn had a depressive
effect, and tb near option was heavy. The
May option had the call, and closed on the eurb
at 44% bid. I provisions there was another
day of wild speculation and wide fluctuations.
January opened $12.50, advanced to $12.90,
closing on the curb at $12.70 bid Lard on
the curb $7.47^ January, $7.60 February.

commonwealth for years. He was surveyor
general for one term, beirfg succeeded by
Gen. Baker, during whioh time he resided in
this city, making many warm personal
friends, all of whom remember him kindly
and sincerely deplore his demise.
A Sleeping Car Comedy.
A traveler on the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad relates the following inoident of
travel:
A middle-aged married couple have turned
in next to me, having boarded the train at a
way station. They have evidently been
much hurried and are out of humor, for the
wife is fretful and excited, and the husband
growls above his breath in this style:
"Now, I'll just bet you didn't put my
night shirt in!''
"S'hush! It sin the basket in the corner,"
replies the woman.
"I've looked in the basket and 'taint there.
I s'pose you put it at the bottom under the
vittals."
"In the vittala. indeed! Why, John, what
on e-a-r-th are you a-doin'?"
"I'm looking for my shut."
'Don't! that's the wrong basket. You've
gone and spilt them pickles all over the bed
I never seen such a man!"
"Never mind, Mary, you needn't tell the
whole ear." This in a whisper peculiar to
the stage.
"Looking for your old shirt in the dinner
basket! I don't see what any body wants a
night-shirt for on a railroad, anyhow," re
torted the indignant female and there was a
whirriDg sound, which indicated that she
had pitched the missing article in his face
just in time to choke off a wicked rejoinder.
"'Sposin' the cars were to run off the
track?" added she. "You'd be a nice piotur
wadin' out of a swamp or rolling down a
bank in that, wouldn't you
"I'd be just as comfortable and purty as
you in that"
"S'hush! You'll diegrace
both of us with
your tongue." Whimpering.
"My tongue. Well, dn me, Mary, if"
"There now, you're cursing meyou
you" Breaks off to sob.
There's where she had him.
I fancied shortly after hearing the re
sonant and agreeable sound of a kiss, but
perhaps it was only the angels, and I
dropped off to sleep again. On the follow
ing day I saw the middle-aged oouple seated
opposite munching pickles and fried chick
en at intervalsas docile and happy a
coup le as any body may wish to see.
A Hawk's Instinct.
An engine driver on a French railway
gives some singular details concerning an old
hawk which is accustomed to profit by the
fear incited in young birds by the noise of
the locomotives on that line. The little bird
of prey displays an instinct closely border
ing on reason. "He is," said our
informant, "accustomed to lay beside the
trains passing between Mesgriny and Ro
milly, and has been known to the officials
for more than fifteen years. Having
learned from experience that the terror
inspired by the trains drives sueh birds
as may be near the railway out of the
Sedges on either side of the line, this hawk
soars evenly a few yards above the carriages,
and carefully keeps himself hidden in the
cloud of steam emerging from the funnel,
ho sodn as a suitable victim appears,
he is incontinently pounced upon and de
voured. Should, however, the piratical
bird by chance fail of his object, he returns
to his place amid the steam, from
which even missiles can not dis
lodge him, a slight turn of the wing always
enabling him to evade them. The bird's
flight is extremely rapid, as, indeed, that of
hawks is well known to be. If the train is,
say from one hundred and fifty
to two hundred and fifty yards ahead, and
going at express speed, a few seconds suffice
to place him in turn the same distance in
front, even after chasing a bird along the
hedges.
Anxious to Show Their Innocence.
[New York World.]
A number of leading Republican states
men and patriots are on trial in Pennsylva
nia for bribery, corruption, perjury and a
few more cardinal vices of the same sort.
So patent is their innocence and so eager
are they to demonstrate it that they are
fighting tooth and nail to get off on techni
calities instead of going to trial on the mer
its of the cases. The indictments should
be quashed at once, and the patriots bailed
over to a future term. Their help will be
indispensable in the next presidential cam
paign for Grant, Cameron and civil service
reform.

The advertising columns of the GLOBE
are a gratifying index of the growth and ad
vancement cf St. Paul. Almost every day
records some new and important enterprise.
The latest is the announcement of Messrs.
Depew & Burns that they have opened a
machine shop at No. 120 East Fifth street.
They propose to manufacture engines, boil
ers, and all kinds of machinery, and will
make a specialty of repair work. Mr. B. H.
Depew, the head of the firm, is the most
competent man in his line in the State. He
was until recently the head of the mechan
ical department of the St. Paul Foundry,
and he filled the position admirably. Those
who entrust their orders to Depew & Barns
cm count upon receiving satisfaction.
The new firm will not be ready for work
until the 8th inst., but after that date they
invite the public to call.
Massachusetts.
The official figures of the recent election
in Massachusetts show a falling off in the
Bepobliean strength quite as remarkable as
that in Maine. Heretofore the old Bay State
has stood at the head and front of the party
in the East. It gave way only to the ex
tent of four members of Congress when the
storm against Grantsim swept over the
country in 1874, transforming a Republican
majority of a hundred in the House of Rep
resentatives into a Democratic majority of
eighty.
Gradually the foundations have been sap
ped, and but for the folly and stupidity of
its opponents the whole Republican eiifioe
would have toppled ovar and fallen to ruin.
It is now propped up by accidental causes,
and kept temporarily standing by sectional
agitation. Whenever that support is re
moved, it will go to pieces.
In 1868, Grant carried Massachusetts by a
majority of 86.069 over Seymour. In 1872,
Grant carried Massachuset ts by a majority
of 74,212 over Greeley. In 187G, Hayes
carried Massachusetts by a majority of
41,286 over Tilden.
Contrast these results with the last returns
for Governor, when the whole vote cast was
only 15,000 short of the aggregate at the
Presidential election, and the significance of
the great change will be apparent. Here
are the figures, for the edification of poli
ticians of both sides:
Long, Republican 122,751
Butler, mixed 109,149
Adams, Democrat 9,909
Edding, Prohibitionist 1,645
Scattering 108
120,891
Majority for Long 1,800
To this complexion has the Republican
party in Massachusetts come at last.
A Colored Beecher.
[Richmond (Ky.) Register.)
A colored minister asks the Register to
publish the following account of an assault
on him. The language is his own "Last
Monday night, after the Rev. Howard Che
nault, of color, had escorted his paramour
home, and was returning alone, quietly
thinking over the mutations and vicissitudes
of life, he was violently assaulted by some
unknown party, who demanded to know of
him his name. Upon refusal, he fired once
at his reverence and retreated. Tbe shoot
ing was done near Mr. 's yard, on Lan
caster avenue, and the ball struck the fence
near where the minister was standing. He
is very anxious to know the offending
party."
Says the New York Sun Senator Thur
man has had occasion to study the railroad
phase of the monopoly problem, and he has
shown himself an intelligent student
He is soon to retire from the Senate
but he has time enough yet left, if he
chooses to utilize it, to build for, himself a
monument more enduring than brass in the
legislation of his country and in the grate
ful remembrance of his countrymen.
On the whole, perhaps it is just as well for
this democratic republic that there are not
many Americans who can sell offs 80,000,-
000 of railroad stock and still have more
than $80,000,000 left.

If He Would Stop There.
San Francisco Call.
The shrewdness of a Boston youth is much
commended. He was receiving a salary of
$300 a year. On tbe 1st of January his em
ployer made him a present of $50. He con
sulted his uncle as to what he should do
with the amount. That prudent gentleman
advised him to put it in the savings bank,
but as the money had come easy, he would
do nothing of the kind. He invested it
in stocks. By a streak of
good luok the $50 brought him in $4,500.
This he put on deposit: His uncle praised
the shrewdness of the nephew's stock trans
actions, but expressed the belief that he
would "turn out to be a gambler." This is
just where the danger lies. There are many
instances in this city of persons making a
fortune first venture, and being flushed,
pursued the business of stock dealing until
they were financially ruined. One of these
was so notable as to deserve mention. Some
eight years ago, when the stock
market was very much inflated, a
young married man, who held a
life position in the army, where he had
aohieved some distinctian, had $900, with
which he purchased a rapidly rising stock.
Five days afterward he could have "cleaned
up," as the phrase has it, $70,000. His
friends advised him to withdraw. But no.
They insisted that he should at least secure
one-half the sum, and let the balance
go as a risk. "Not a cent would
be taken from the hands of his
broker until the amount reached $100,000.'
On the contrary, he went in for several
thousand more dollars on a ''margin." In
the elation o' his feelings he wrote bis res
ignation in the army, and forwarded it to
Washington. A few days afterward the
crash came, and the young man was next
thing to a bankrupt. The last we heard of
this unfortunate he was at the capital of the
tion, endeavoring to procure a situation,
those who realize largely on a first stock
operation would be content and retire from
the lists, many men would be in good
circumstances, who now find them
selves reduced to poverty. Bat few do so,
for there is a fascination in this sort of
speculation which leads them deeper in as
their game increase, until the inevitable day
comes when all is lost, and when suicide
often follows to close out a life which has
nothing before it but a dark future. It
would be useless, however) to offer advice on
this subject. The history of the stcck
board is repeating itself every day, and wiU.
go on repeating so long as such speculations
are held to be respectable by those who en
gage in them.
While L. A. Abbott and lauuiy, of Lam
berton, were attending church last Sabbath,
a tramp entered their honse and stole a ten
dollar bill. He was pursued, the monoy re
covered, and he was permitted to tramp on.
