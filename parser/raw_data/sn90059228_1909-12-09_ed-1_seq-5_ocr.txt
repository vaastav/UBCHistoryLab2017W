President Taft's message to Con
gress is more like the old messages,
mild in tone, yet nevertheless full of
good sense and suggestions. It is
thoroly opimistic and voices the opin
ion that this country is on the verge
of an era of prosperity unparaleled
in its history.
The switchmen's strike is still un
settled and no one can tell how long
it will continue. Very little freight
is being moved. It is only a question
of a few days when the situation will
be unbearable. By striking at this
time, in the midst of the holiday
rush, and with a cold winter coming
on when thousands upon thousands
must depend on the roads to carry
supplies of food and fuel, the strikers*
have lost all sympathy of the public.
To precipitate a strike at this time is
criminal, or ought to be. and it is toready
be hoped the railroads will win out in
this instance.
Plans for a state conservation con
gress have been delegated to a state
commission headed by President D. H.
Neill, of the Federation of Commer.
cial clubs, and in February will be
held the greatest meeting Minnesota
has ever seen, to determine what the
resources of this state are, how they
may be best developed, and how pre
sent and possible waste in the de
velopment process may be stopped.
Governor Eberhart, has decided opin
ions on this broad subject, and the
congress will sift from the mass of
conservation ideas presented by many
different men, the ideas which are
sound and practical and for the bene
fit of. the state, and see what can be
done to put them into effect.
Ideas of conservation for Minnesota
are somewhat vague in spots, but with
the vague and the visionary are many
exceedinly practical ideas. Some
thing must be done to break up the
big speculative holdings of land, and
get the land upon the market for set
(tiers to occupy. Several sections of
the state are annually in danger, from
either surplus moisture or flood, mak
ing agriculture an exceedinly precar
ious pursuit. This condition must
be more effectively met. Minnesota
abounds in water powerfor the bene
fit so far of a favored few and the
jtrust. Something nust be done to
give the people the cheap and ade
quate power, which they now own,
wh'ch they should be premitted to
enjoy. Minnesota has rivers suitable
to the building up of a considerable
commerce, competitive with the rail
ways, and be able to force down rail,
way rates, and they are not utilized.
These are some of the practical con
servation matters suggested by Gov
ernor Eberhart. which this congress
will consider.
The Governor Johnson memorial
fund is practically complete, and be
fore the end of another week the en
tire $25,000 will be in the hands of the
state commission, which is to deter
mine what kind of a memorial shall
he erected, and where it will be plau
ed. Saint Peter has already made
strong arguments for tha location of
the monument," and the general feel
ing seems to be that a monument
the best form the memorial can take
should be located to the home town of
the late executive. From other por
tions of the state, come arguments
that the memorial should be located
either upon the capitol grounds, or,
as a statue, within the building, where
the late governor did his best work.
The commission will have a difficult
taak in determining what is the best
to be. done, but that the memorial
will he built, and that it will be a fit.
ting tribute, is already guaranteed by
the $25,000, each dollar of which ha
come from some friend of John Al
bert Johnson. As the late governor
belonged to the whole state, and was
equally loved in all sections, we be
lieve a fitting memorial should be
erected at a point most accessible to
all the people of the state, and there
can be no question that the capitol
grounds Is the most appropriate place
on that score. A statue in bronze is
in. our opinion the best form of a
memorial.

BRILLIANT THRONG PRESENT
HO UM Qraats Speaker Cannon with
Applause Many "Taft Policy
Bills Are Introduced In Both
HouaooQallariaa Aro Crowded.
By EDWARD B. CLARK.
Washington, Dec. 6.The Sixty
first congress of the United States
met at noon to-day for the first day
of its first regular session, with Vice
President Sherman in the chair of the
senate, and Speaker Joseph O. Can
non in the chair in the House. While
this congressional gathering is the
first regular session, it is the second
session in reality, for congress met in
extraordinary session last spring at
the call of President Taft to consider
the matter of a revision of the tariff.
Some Interest was lacking in the
proceedings of the first day In the
capitol because at the beginning of
the extraordinary session in March
last the speaker of the House was
elected. Moreover, before the extra
ordinary session was ended., Speaker
Cannon appointed all the committees
which are to take legislation under
consideration for the next two win
ters. The appointment of the commit
tees ended the campaign on the part
of the members for choice chairman
ships and, if the chairmanships were
not forthcoming, for seats in the more
important subsidiary bodies of the
Hous.
Ready for Work at Once.
The members have had time to get
over jealousies and rivalries and so
is that, so far as committee work is con
concerned, the House not only is
to proceed at once to consider
legislation, but most of the members
Vice-President Sherman.
have brought themselves into a frame
of mind to do what they are called
upon to do without regard to their
past feelings of disappoinment and
perhaps, anger.
As is always the case on the open
ing day of congress, admission to the
House and Senate galleries was bywere
card and only those fortunate enough
to know senators and representatives
sufficiently well to-secure admission
tickets were allowed to witness the
proceedings.
Galleries Are Crowded.
The galleries of both House and
Senate were jammed with people. All
classes of Washington society were
represented in the throng of visitors.
The diplomatic gallery in the House
and in the Senate as well, was filled
to its fullest capacity with ambassa
dors, ministers, attaches and the laecutive
dies of the different legations. Mem
bers of the families of the president
and of the vice-president of the United
States occupied seats in the executive
galleries and the cabinet and judici
ary and army and navy circles were
well represented.
By a rule which was adopted not
long ago, flowers are barred from the
floor of the House excepting when
they are to be used as a tribute to the
memory of some deceased member.
The result of this rule is that now on
the opening days of congress the
desks of the members are bare of
floral decorations. In the old days
both House and Senate were turned
into conservatories for the time of the
opening proceedings.
At sharp noon Speaker Cannon
called the House to order and asked
the chaplain, Rev. Henry N. Couden,
to offer prayer. In his prayer which
was in a sense a Thanksgiving offer
ering, the chaplain referred to the
prosperity of the country, the oppor
tunities of the present and the bright
hopes and promises of the future.
Absentees Are Few.
As soon as the prayer was ended
the clerk of the House called the roll
of membership by states and it was
found that there were only a few ab
sentees. The roll call ended the read
ing clerk of the Senate who had ap
peared in the House was recognized,
and he announced that the Upper
House had passed a resolution to in
form the House of Representatives
that a quorum of the Senate being as
sembled, that body was ready to pro
ceed to business. The House also
was told that the Senate had appoint
ed a committee to Join a House com*
mittee to Inform the president of the

measures which had been recommend
ed by President Taft as being neces
sary to carry out proposed policies
of progression. The bills ranged from
those intended to correct alleged ex
isting evils in interstate commerce to
those to give increases of pensions to
veterans of the civil war.
Applause Greets Speaker Cannon.
If Speaker Cannon anticipates any
particular trouble with the "Insur
gents" of the House at the coming ses
sion, he gave no evidence of it when
he took the chair as presiding officer.
He was greeted with great applause
from the galleries and from the floor
of the House, many of the Democrats
and insurgents joining in the demon
stration, though in either case pos
sibly the hand-clapping was given as
an evidence of regard for the office
of speaker, rather than as evidence of
any overweariing affection for the
speaker himself.
With the committees ready to begin
work, the House will settle down to
its winter's business at once. No bills
will be passed immediately because
all measures must be considered in
committee, and the meetings of the
committees will be held daily from
now until the Christmas holidays and
some of the more important House
bodies will sit during the recess.
When congress reassembles in Janu
ary many of the committees will be
ready to report bills, and the debates
of the winter will begin.
Opening of the Senate.
Vice-President Sherman called the
Senate to order at noon. Rev. Ed
ward Everett Hale, the chaplain of
the Senate, having died during the
summer recess, his place as chaplain,
temporarily, was taken by a local
clergyman who offered prayer. In the
Senate the roll was called and it was
found that nearly all the senators
were in their seats. The resolutions
adopted to the effect that com
mittees be appointed to inform the
House and the president that the Sen
ate had assembled and was ready to
begin the business of the session. As
was the case in the House many bills
were introduced for consideration dur
ing the winter by senators who, like
the representatives, desire to have a
hand in forwarding administration pol
icies.
After a comparatively short session
"in the open," the galleries were
cleared and the Senate went into ex
session behind closed doors
for the purpose of considering nomin
ations for office sent to the Upper
House by President Taft.
