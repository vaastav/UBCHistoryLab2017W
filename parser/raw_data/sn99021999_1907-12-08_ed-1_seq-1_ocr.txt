briefer, and the action of the heart Is very
feeble.

' aMs
At least one man In Omaha one knew
King Oscar well and he ever cherished a
love for the venerable ruler of Sweden.
That man la Oustave Anderson, Unltsd
States commissioner for so many years In
Omaha. Judge Anderson la a native of
Sweden and one of the most prominent
Swedes of Omaha and Nebraska. When
advised that the king - was dying Judge
Anderson said:
"He was one of the' best and greatest
men who ever sat oo a throne. I knew
htm well. When he was heir apparent he
used to Inspect the regiment of which I
wa a member and officer and men all
held him In the highest regard. His ability
and sense of justice wss recognised by all
people and hence he was called a arbi
trator In International disputes, having ad
justed difficulties for Germany, the United
tates and other nations. He was essen
tially a man of peace. In the difficulties
which resulted In the separation of Nor
way the king prevented war, wh-re others
might have brought It on. As a king he
had the love ef all of his people and the
respect cf the world. I am sorry to know
that he has gone, but ' In the nature of
tilings he could live but little longer and
lie has rounded out a well filled life."
"The beat monarch and one of the best
ef men has passed away," said John Hend
rlcksen, a native of Sweden. "With the
exception of the socialists, with whom ha
held nothing In common, he was beloved
by every Swede at home and abroad. His
democracy was his chief characteristic No
man was too poor or too humble to escape
his notice and his, love for children had
passed Into a proverb. On Christmas holi
days when the markets were filled with
toys and such things the king would go
to them and he could be often seen carry
ing a ragged child around In his arma
while he bought present for the small
children who flocked after him. rive years
ago, when I visited Bweden the last time,
a party of seven of us went to the castle.
We saw the king In one of the corridors
and as we tipped our hats to him he re
sponded and a little girl In the party at
tracted his particular attention. The beat
loved monarch and one of the kindliest of
men baa passed away."

CUSTOMS MEN HAVE DOUBTS

NEW YORK. Dec. 7. Why a woman
should want a mourning gown and at the
same time a wedding trousseau Is a ques
tion that is agitating custom officials here.
Mia Florence Todd arrived from France
the other day and attempted to paa seven
trunks of clothing under the foreign reel
dent clause, for, although her home Is la
New Orleans, she has lived for five years
in France. The law provides that in such
a case "a reasonable amount" of clothing
and personal effects shall enter duty free.
But the custom authorities thought that
even trunks full of wearing apparel, val
ued at llo.iXO, and particularly the incon.
gruoua assortment of funeral and wedding
garment constituted more than "a reason
able amount" and are holding the trunks.

MONONAOH, W. Va,. Dec. 7.-Up to 6:10
o'clock tonight twenty-two bodies had been
brought to the surface from Mines Nos. 6
and 8 of the Fairmont Coal company, where
an explosion occurred yesterday. Over 100
bodies have been found.
The work of searching the mines con
tlnues, but despite all efforts Is progressing
slowly. The further Into the mines the
rescuers go the greater Is the volume of
black damp they encounter and this deadly
gas Is seriously Interfering with their
Work. Many qf the rescuers, overcome by
the fumes, have to be carried from the
mines. A number of them are In a serious
condition. and several will undoubtedly die
Only a small portion of the two mines
remains to be explored and this I being
pushed as rapidly as possible. It Is be
lieved that a large number of. the bodies
will have been brought to the surface by
midnight. . The number of dead will be
about 600.
rresiaeni j. . w. watson of the mining
company In a statement to the Associated
Press today said every possible Investiga
tion would be made of the disaster to
ascertain its cause and fix responsibility.
There was a slight fire inside of the slope
of No. 8 mine this morning, due to the
tarUng of the fan. It wa extinguished
after an hour and the fan working success
fully, greatly facilitating the efforts of
the rescuers to get Into the mines.
With unabated energy, nve recruiting
parties, working from every possible point
to enter and exrlore mine No. 6 and 8
of the Falrmoht Coal company are this
morning putting forth every effort to reach
the 316 men whom they have every reason
to believe are still In the mine, dead or
alive, although there Is scarcely a hope
entertained that a single one of the 600 or
more, men who went Into the mine yester
day morning has survived the 'terrlflo ex
plosion and the poisonous gas with which
the .mines filled Immediately after the
death-dealing crash. .
.. Relatives la Bad .Search
'With the dawn of day there began a
heart-rending march up and down the
aisles along which these bodies have been
laid by .sbUag Wfver ra mothers-and
Sweethearts, orphaned children and strong
men, each seeking va uear relative or be
loved friend.
There"are between 6,000 and ,000 Inhabi
tants In the mining town of Monongah and
It Is doubtful If in this entire population
there are a score of, persons who have not
either a near relative or a close friend
numbered among the victims of the dis
aster. '
, Last night hundreds of men stood about
the entrance of the two mines. They said
nothing, but when approached and asked
a question they would give way to their
emotions and often . give way- to tear.
During the night few women were to be
seen, but all day yesterday the . women
were the chief actors In most pathetlo and
heart-rending scenes. They crowded the
sides of the hills overlooking the Ill-fated
mines and pried aloud. A the day ad
vanced they become almost crazed through
grief and suspense. . One woman pulled
out her hair, .handful' at a time; another
tore all the skin from both of her cheeks
with her finger iislls. Some lay down on
the frozen ground, and cried themselves to
sleep. In this condition many .ere carried
to their home nearby without awakening.
Where Bodies Were Fonad.
The rescuing parties penetrated mine No.
about 8,600 feet before they came upon
the first of the dead. A majority of the
corpses will. It Is believed, be found about
a mile further back, but It Is hardry possi
ble that all the bodies will be recovered for
several day. The 600 men were working
In a territory one mile square. It will be
days before a thorough search of all of this
area can be made. As the searching parties
advance they must clear away the debris.
The explosion wrecked over 000 mine cars,
and these choke the entrance on all aide.
A peculiar and remarkable feature la
that . notwithstanding the force or the ex
plosion, very little of the mine roof wa
wrecked. By those who witnessed It, the
explosion was likened to the discharge of a
cannon. Every movable object shot with
terrlflo force through the mine. At the
entrance of mine No. 8 a concrete power
house was completely demolished. A piece
of concrete, weighing fully 1,000 pounds, was
blown clear acres the Weat Fork river,
landing on the side of a hill. In a radius
of a half mile not another piece of con
crete ran be found. Great holes were torn
In the hill on either side of the entrance
of No. 1 Mine cars were crushed as though
made of paper and the huge steel tipple
was blown apart. On all sides electric light

DR. WOODS HOPES TO REOPEN
President of National Bank of Com
metre Hopes to Bo Ablo to
Bee name Boslnesa.
KANSAS CITY, Dec. 7. Dr. W. 8. Woods,
the president of the National Bank of
Commerce, that closed Its doors Wednes
day owing Its depositors cloee to 817.000,000,
asserts that the bank may resume business
within a short time.
Dr. Woods early today, after a meeting
of directors of the bank that lasted late
Into th night, said:
"It Is the sentiment of the board of di
rectors that the bank resume business,
And Indeed I do not see much that Is In
the way of resuming. We can meet all
the federal requirements without any trou
ble. We will be able to show that our
capital Is unlmparled and ' that we Can
easily meet all obligations.
"We closed with practically SO cents on
the dolar cash and exchange on hands, I
cepts more on the dollar than the national
banking law require. We are paying out
nothing now and the receiver will collect
very fast. It Is reasonable to conclude
that It won't be a great while before he
has collected 80 per cent more, giving us 60
cents on the dollar. That would be a good
cash reserve, plenty strong enough to
open with."
Drt Woods Insists that the 81,638,724.67
surplus and undivided profits of the bank
will pay several times over what bad
paper the lnstltutlbn may . hs,ve.

troduced by Japanese in Formosa. Walter
Clifton, manager of the Formosa Mercan

nese. "These head hunters," suld Clifton,
"number about 100,000 and Infest the entire
east coast of the Island. All efforts to
civilize them have failed. They recently

nese Into sn ambush on the pretense of
showing them some treasure and killed all
but three.
"In punishment for this treacherous con
duct, the Japanese Inaugurated a method
of electrocution. Large bodies of troopf
were sent out and now when a company of
head hunters Is located the place Is sur
rounded by a wire fence. The wires are
charged with electricity. The soldiers be
gin to shoot; the savages stampede and
then the deadly wire get those that the

WASHINGTON. Dec. 7.-Chicago. June 16.
The former 1s the place and the latter the
time at which the republican national con
vention for 1908 will be held. Both point
were decided by the republican national
committee In conference at the Shoreham
hotel In this city today.. The meeting began
10:18 a. m. and adjourned at 1:36 p. m.,
and In that time the claims of Chicago,
Kansas City and Denver for the conven
tion location were all pointedly presented
by advocates of the various places. The
vote stood 81 for Chicago, 18 for Kansas
City and 4 for Denver, after which the
Chicago choice was declared to be by ac
clamation. Tbe result was pleasantly received by all
the member of th committee, and even
the Kansas City and Denver boomers, of
whom there were sixty or seventy present,
announced themselves as satisfied.
Kansas City declared through Its dele
gation, however, that It would "come back
after It again In 1912 and would be sure to
get It at that -time." The selection of a
date was a compromise between June 1 and
June 30, all being satisfied on that point
also.
The - committee after an hour's debate
reached a compromise on the proposition
as set forth In the call for the election of
delegates by primaries In states having
laws prescribing that method of election
by giving state and county committees au
thority to decide whether the primary elec
tion shall take the place of the election by
convention as in th past.
A report on the procedure for the elec
tion of delegate from Porto Rico and the
Philippines provided for a call y terri
torial or central committee for an election
for the choosing of two delegates. The
method for such election was prescribed.
, William F. Stone, sergeant-at-arma, an
nounced the appointment of Dave O. Owen
of Milwaukee, Wis., as chief assistant ser-te&nt-at-arms
and Lee O. . Hechlnger .of
Bast Orange, N. J., chief confidential clerk.
" Committee Brains Work.
' Th comml'.toe was called to order by
Chairman New at 10-H and Governor Mur
phju.a,dui3iedlntely relojmlsed to present
th report of his committee on th retire
ment of Chairman Cprtelyou. He expressed
the regret of the oommtttce, congratulated
Mr. Cortelyou on the Increasing honors
that have come to him and closed by, ex
pressing a wish for a long life for blm.
The resolution was adopted unanimously,
as was also one presented by Mr. Babcock
of Wisconsin on behalf of the committee
appointed to take appropriate action on
the death of former Chairman Henry C.
Payne.
After the committees on the method of
selecting delegates from the District of
Columbia, Porto Rico and the Philippine
Islands hsd made reports, tbe roll of states
was called for tbe presentation of names
of cities as candidates for the national
convention. The first response was made
from Colorado, and Mr. Mills of Denver
was recognised to put that city In nomina
tion. He said that Denver wanted the
convention not for the purpose of selling
town lots, but on account of a sincere de
sire to entertain the convention. Denver
offered to contribute 8100,000 toward the
expenses of the convention, S25.C00 to be
paid within ten days after notification of
selection, and the balance In thirty, sixty
and ninety dsys.
Harper Lands Denver.
Lieutenant Governor Harper also pre
sented the advantage of Denver. He gav
this committee aaaurance that that city
would no only take care of the conven
tion financially, but also would look after
the personal comfort of those attending.
He dwelt . upon the scenic and climatic
conditions and said:
"It would be Impossible to depict to you
all the peasure awaiting you If you come
to Colorado."
Lieutenant Governor Harper said fur
ther that ths convention ought to be a fao
tor In going beyond beaten paths. He said
that the welcome that would be extended
the delegates to the convention would be
most pleasant.
Mr. Harper's address wa received with
applause and when concluded the roll call
continued. Upon Illinois being reached. Rep
resentative Lowden, the committeeman
from that stats, presented the claims of
Chicago. He said that Inasmuch as prob
ably all of the delegates had attended
conventions in that city It was fortunately
unnecessary for him to dwell upon facil
ities of all kinds as they already were
known. He reminded them that this would
bs the' first convention . since 1888 when It
had not been known for months In ad
vance what was going to transpire. Hence,
he said, "the Interest will be greater than
In any convention for many years paat and
hence the neceaalty for the fullest possible
facilities. These," he added, "Chicago can
abundantly supply."
Chicago Center of Population.
Mr. Lowden said that Chicago being prac
tically the center of population wa the
best place for holding the convention. H
believed the rank and file of the repub
lican party desired Chicago and that th
newspaper men from experience In the past
would testify to Its desirability as a place
for sending dispatches.
He said that In the matter of money
It was not wise from a party standpoint
to pay more than the actual expenses of
th convention. It was a pleasure to him,
he said, to note the aest with which th
beautiful young title of the west had
ought to secure the convention and h
hoped that some day their effort would
be ( rewarded by the favorable action of
the committee.
Mr. Lowden cloaed by quoting a tele
gram from Messrs. Eamuel D. Raymond and
F. W. Vpbam. guaranteeing the expenses
of the convention In case It should go to
Chicago. He said that these two gentlemen
are relied upon more than any other two
men In Chicago In matters of thl kind

the law to be enforced? And if Jurors are
to avoid their responsibility In criminal

HAVE HAND OF BRIDGE WHIST
Morsrau. Vanderhtlt and Perkins Be
lieved to Have Talked Cen
tral Loan.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. The Journal of
Commerce this morning says: J. P. Mor
gan, William K. Vanderbllt. George W.
Ferklns and a number of other well known
financier held a conference on Thursday
night at Idle Hour, Mr. Vanderbllt' coun
try place, at Oakdale, L. I. It was stated
by a member of the party last night that
the occasion was entirely a social one, and
that nothing occurred more Important than
a "hand of bridge whist." There were no
ladles present.
Wall street does not place much faith in
report that Mr. Morgan had gone to Oak
dale merely for a hand of whist. Among
the various explanations "guessed at," were
that the conference was In regard to New
York Central affair and the placing of
the new equipment loan. It wa also sug
gested' that th conference might have
some connection with Hill-Harrlroan af
fair. The fact I recalled that a very few year
ago Mr. Morgan and a number of Important
financiers went to Philadelphia "to Inspect
Mr. Wldoner's art gallery," according to
the official explanation. A few months
later Is developed that the formation of
the International Mercantile Marine com
panythe Morgan steamship combination
was the real business of the visit.

Annual Dollar Dinner.

Crowds Do Not Turn Out to the Extent
it Had Been Anticipated.
MANY VACANT SEATS AT TABLE

Fringe of the Faithful.
SPEECHES LAST TO LATE HOUR
Bryan Repeats His Allegation of Theft
of Democratle Doctrines, bnt
Find Some of Roosevelt's
to Commend.
The first annual dollar banquet of lk
Dshlman democracy was held last eveolni
In the Auditorium with great eclat. Wil
liam Jennings Bryan was the chief guest
of honor. Beside him there were ht!f a
dozen other democrats from various places,
all of some note In their several vicinities.
Next in point of Importance came tiv...o
who rejoice in membership In .the l.hl
man democracy and last came, the l.ol
pollol, the rank and file of the democracy.
Altogether there might have been :0
at the tables. Pieces were provided tor
1,200. In the boxes and first floor spec
tators seat there was a very slender
sprinkling of people, while In the gallery
the front rows at the east end of th
building were fairly filled.
All day a large contingent of the city
street cleaning department had been busy
garnishing Uie streets about the Audito
rium. Threatening clouds caused appre
hension also to those who had spent weeks
In arranging for the big meeting. But
nature did it part nobly. The cloud dis
appeared, the stars came out In the even
In and all was auspicious
But though the stars came out the peo
ple did not.' At 7:80. the hour appointed
for tha dinner to begin, hardly one-fourth
of the places at the tables were taken and
nobody was In the seats of the spectator.
Had some one blundered? Why did not the
people come to the feast which had been
prepared? Must messengers still be sent
out Into the highways and the hedges to
compel them to come In? It was manifestly
too late to do this. However, a band wa
stationed In front of the building and kept
up a 'strenuous tune. This drew some mor
to .the building. But still the void was al
most as great as the filled spaces when
the speaker arrived and th signal wa
given the waiters to start serving.
Balldlna; Elaborately Decorated.
The great bulldlftg was a pretty slyit
Th decorating and arranging of the tables
had been Well done. Acrons the east end
of the building parallel with the stag ran
long table. This was the speaker'
place and around It were seated also those
who have attaint d psrtlenlar distinction
in th prty. "It wa adorned with flowers,
Back of It against the side of ,th stage
were flags and-upon the stage the fern
and other greenery spread out , their
branches and formed a pretty dom of
green.
Along the entire lenath of the tmlMlna
ran eight table. Here the rank and fllo
wore aeated. There was no adornment on
these tables save only the tall brown bottles
set at frequent Intervals and Interspersed
with such honest fare a bun, banana
and chow enow.
The chief ornaments of th stsg we

were set up on easles. Down on the level
of the floor were pictures of Jackson.
Jefferson and Lincoln. Ye. Lincoln. Th
background of the stage was three rows of
empty chairs.
Three big flags depended from each side
of the stage and from It center and
mailer flag were hung about the balcony.
Cheers for Bryan.
It was precisely 8:18 when a cheer aros
from those In the gallery. The speaker
had entered. They stopped to leave their
coat and hat at the check room and then
Mayor "Jim" passed up the south sll
of th room: Mr. Bryan followed him.
Thl was the signal for a cheer and very
body waved th little flag with which h
had been provided at the door.
Tha cheering and flag waving lasted,
however, for only a few seconds. Mr.
Bryan and the other speakers and notahl
guests took their. places at th table and
then Immediately the waiters rushed down
tho lanes between the tables and the noise
of hunnry men eating and drinking began.
Everybody was very busy for the next
hour satisfying the Inner man and pre
paring for th subsequent feast of oratory.
In due season the speaking part of th
program cam. Hon. George Rogers, presi
dent of the Dahlman Democracy, Intro
duced Hon. John H. At wood, toastmaster.
There was applause as each of the speak
ers was Introduced.
Bryan on "Th Point of View."
Mr. Bryan was th principal speaker and
said In part:
Mr, Bryan took for his subject "Th
Point of View" and followed th line of
argument pursued In hi speech at Wash
ington, adding to th thing which h
stated in that speech were borrowed from
the democratic platform one new sugges
tion contained In the message of President
Roosevelt sent to congress last Tuesday.
This additional suggestion refers tu th
recommendation of the president for a li
cense system for the trusts. Mr. Bryan
also indorsed the president's suggestion la
regard to - appropriating money for cam
paign funds, saying that, while It was an
original suggestion for which the president
should have credit. It was democratic la
spirit and purpose.
He spoke of the spirit of hope that per
vaded the party and said that the demo
cratic party would enter Into the next
campaign with an army ef volunteers, and
that these volunteers were fighting because
their hearts were In the work, and that
they would be more than a match fur any
troops that might be "marshalled for th
defense of the monopolies and special privi
leges." Many reference had been made duirug
th evening to Mr. Bryan' candidacy for
the democratic nomination, and to the
suggestions the speaker gave little en
couragement, except to state that his posi
tion remained the same as indicated in the
protiunclamento given out by him some
time a no. He reiterated that hi position
was unchanged, and that his acceptance
of the nomination would be forthcoming
If he were satisfied the rank and tile of
the party wished him again to lead their
forces.
A disappointment In the program wa th
fact that lion. J, A. Ruundtre ef AJabaAa.
