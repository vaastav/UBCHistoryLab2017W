TIUTllSl>A Y. 1>KC. f?Til, 1895.
Beaten iiy Tiu'oh.? On the night
of tlu? 20th ult., at Huntington, Mr.
R. H. Yowell, of the 7 \tnet news
paper, was assaulted on the street by
four or flvo murderous thugs and
brutally beaten. The Times bud
been making war on these toughs,
and they took tbis cowardly met bod
ot* revenge. They were all arrested
and should be severely dealt with.
Huntington has also had a sensa
tion in the arraignment by Judge
McUinnis, of the Criminal Court, of
the editors and proprietors of the
That* for contempt, their offense
being a criticism of the action of the
Court in the trial of certain parties
charged with prize fighting. All
were fined and in addition Mr. "S ow- ,
ell was sent to jail, but was promptly I
released by .1 udge Harvey, of the
Circuit Court, on a writ of habeas |
corpus. From the account of the
proceedings given in the Times,
Judge McGinnls seems to have had
au exalted opinion of his own dig
nity, and used the power of his
Court to inflict punishment the jus
tice of which may well be ques
tioned.
Extka Session.? Some of our
State exchanges are urging the (?ov
ernor to call an extra session of the
Legislature this winter to re-arrange
the judicial circuits and to supply
deficiencies in the appropriations for
the expenses of the State govern,
ment, which the Legislature, at its
last session, ignorantly or wilfully
failed to make. The Legislature
with a false idea of economy and in
its desire to make a little cheap po
litical capital, failed to perform a
plain duty imposed upon it by law
that is to provide the means noces
Bary for the proper conduct of the
various departments of the State
government. This neglect of duty
will greatly embarrass the executive
department of the government, and
may necessitate the heavy expense
of an oxtra session, though it is not
probable that the Governor will con
vene the Legislature if there bo any
possible way by which an extra ses
sion can be avoided.
The President's message, sent to
Congress on Tuesday, deals largely
with our relations with foreign coun
tries, and as to the pending struggle
of the Cubans for national independ
ence, he urges the strictest neutrality
on the part of this government, lie
deals ably and at length with the
financial question, and urges the re
tirenient of the greenback notes.?
In dealing with this great question,
the President is clear, strong and for
cible and, whilst showing due defer
ence to the opinions of those who
seo in free coinage the remedy for
existing evils, he has decided con
victions the other way, which he
does not hesitate to declare.
The Turk.? -No where in the
world's history do we read of a more
formidable politico-military combi
nation than thiit now arrayed against
the Sultan by the six great Christfan
powers of Europe to secure protec
tion for the Christians in Asia Minor.
Yet in the face of this mighty com
bination, in comparison with which
the armies of Sennacherib, Alexan
der, Ctesar and Napoleon dwindle
into insignificance, there is no apps.
rent cessation in the horrible slaugh
ter of the Armenian Christians l?y
the merciless and barbarous Turks.
(I en. Cox EY is said to bo very
much elated over the fifty odd thou
sand votes he received for Governor
ol Ohio. As he and his friends
counted on a very much larger vote,
we take tbis exuberance of spirit on
the part of the excentric statesman
from Ohio to be nothing more than a
whistling in the dark to keep the
courage up. It is said, too, that
Coxey proposes to start a paper next
year to be called Sound Money ,
which will advocate the free coinage
of silver.
New Men. ? In the i> 1th Congress,
which convened Monday, there will
be 158 men who have never bad any
experience in national legislation,
and of this number 5)2 were never in
a legislative body of any kind. The
delegations from many of the West
ern States are almost entirely new,
many of the old and experienced
members iu both parties having been
dropped out in the elections last fall.
There will also be quite a number of
very young men in the new Congress.
The Courier- Journal declares that,
notwithstanding this is a Democratic
administration, eight-tenths of all
the best offices in the various depart
ments at Washington are held by
Republicans. Some of our Demo
cratic exchanges argue that this
state of things had much to do with
roccnt Democratic reverses. "Turn
the rascals out" was a campaign cry
to which it seems the powers that bo
have given but little attention.
"The Bimetalist" is tho signifi
cant name of a new weekly recently
launched at Charleston, whose mis
sion will be to advocate the free and
unlimited coinage of both metals. ?
Mr. S. X. Swimme will bo the edi
tor in charge. Surely he will be
able to keep the head of the ?? Bi
metalist" above water.
.Congress convened Monday.?
Mr. Jteed was elected Speaker, re
ceiving 23-1 votes to 95 for Crisp.
A LAKUR crowd attended the game
of" football at Charleston in Thanks
giving day last week between the
clubs from our State University and
the Washington and Lee University
at Ijexiugton. Excitement ran high
and the game ftas played with great
spirit. The West Virginia hoys
were too large and heavy tor the
Lexington team and w?>n easily by a
score of -J* to S. The gate receipts,
as we are informed, amounted to
about $2,000, all ot which went to
the winners. They, however, gave
the Washington and Lee hoys
which more than paid their ex pen-.es.
This large sum so easily tuade will
put the athletic club at Morgantown
011 a good footing.
Mn. ('hah. II. Read, Jk., of Rich
mond, hns been employed as the su
peri n tending architect to he in charge
ol" the new building* for the Union
Theological Seminary, soon to be re- 1
moved from Hnmpden-Sidncy to
Richmond. The work before Mr.
Read is an important and extensive |
one. I here will he fourteen build- 1
ings altogether, and they will proha
hly cost $200,000 or more. He has
already begun the preliminary work
in t he preparation of his plans. Of
the $125,000, mo far subscribed to
ward the construction of the new
buildings, the sum of $7.\000 was
given by Messrs. \V. W. Npence, of
Baltimore, and George W. Watts' of

The Republican State Committee J
of \ irginia met at Petersburg on the
~<th ult ., and was largely attended
not only by the members but In
tending Republicans from all over
the State. Col. \V,?. L?In,, Wlts
chosen chairman in place of Wm,
Mahone, deceased, Hnd was also
chosen as the Virginia member of
the Republican National Committee.
The choice of Col. Lamb as chair
man was, it is thought, the best the
committee could have made.
An editor gets off the following :
In church or in state it is rule or to
be ruled ; in courtship or marriage
it is fool or be fooled ; in logic or
law it is nick or he nicked ; in gamb
ling or trade it is trick or be tricked ;
in treaty or war it is beat or be
beaten; in the struggle for life it is
eat or be eaten; in politics it is
crow or eat crow; in newspaper
life it is hoe your own row.
