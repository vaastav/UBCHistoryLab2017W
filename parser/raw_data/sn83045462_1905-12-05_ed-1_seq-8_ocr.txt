Heavy-Soled Shoes
that "bend" as "easy"
as Slippers.
Registered In the United States Patent

THESE Unique Shoes?though apparently high-priced?

factories producing them are with difficulty keeping the
supply up to the great demand.

rials and workmanship ? and on the best-fitting, shapely
styles that money can buy?and they're lined throughout with
soft, sweat-proof kid.
BEXD-EESY Shoes will outwear any 3 ordinary pairs
of shoes?but their distinctive features are their "Bend-eesy"
Soies (specially tanned for us), which, though heavy, "bend"
as "easy" as slippers?and feeling like rubber cushions under
your feet, make walking a perfect luxury.
To prove what shoe-wearers think of them we annex one
of many unsolicited testimonials!

The South Dakota editors and their

with one another in their efforts to please
the scribblers and make them think the
capital is the finest city in the world. Sena

Senate wing of the Capitol.
Mr. Fairbanks said he was very glad to
meet so many representatives of the press
from this western state, and offered them
the privilege of inspecting the Senate cham
ber before the day's session began. This
privilege the members of the party availed
themselves of promptly, and after they had
strolled about the newly-carpeted floor they
were escorted to a reserved gallery to
w~uCh the ?*>eninS ot the session.
The Supreme Court was visited shortly
after noon, and next they went to the
House side and had a brief glimpse of that
lively branch of Congress during the read

VERDICT FOB DEFENDANT.
Outcome of Charge of Alienating Hus
band's Affections.
By direction of Justice Barnard, presiding,
a jury In Circuit Court, No.l.thls afternoon
rendered a verdict In favor of the defend
ant, as the outcome of the proceedings at
law Instituted by Mts. Annie J. Dodge,
against Mrs. Mary H. Rush, to recover
damages in the sum of |S0,000.
Mrs. Rush was accused by Mrs. Dodge of

mitted a motion, when the plaintiff an
nounced the close of her testimony, that
the court take the case from the jury. After
argument the motion was granted, the

developed anything to substantiate the as
sumption that Mrs. Rush had alienated tne
affections of Mr. Dodge from Ills wife, the
plaintiff.

Buckwheat Cakes the Issue.
Richard Woodston and William Garnett,
colored, were using dishes and coffee mugs
as weapons at the Bismarck Cafe on Penn
sylvania avenue when Policeman Lynch of
the sixth precinct heard the crash of dishes,
and entered. He arrested the two princi
pals. and both put up $5 collateral for their
appearance In the Police Court today. Gar
nett failed to respond, but Woodston came
to court to stand trial. Judge Muilowny
decided that Woodston was not guilty of
the disorderly cohduct and dismissed the
charge.
The trouble arose from a dispute as to
whether an order for buckwheat cakes had
been given. Heavy coffee mugs, sugar

HOW THE SWISS VOTE.
Hymns Are Sung and Then Hands Are
Held Up.
From the Churchman.
In contrast with the complicated ballots
and election laws, of this country Is the
simplest of all voting systems, still prac
ticed In Switzerland by the showing of
handa Sometimes more than 10,000 people
are gathered In the big market place. Some
of the men have come twenty or thirty miles
to vote; for every man of voting age is
fined if he does not report at the voting
place. The ceremony In the election de
scribed "began with a solemn march of the
dignitaries from the house where they had
been waiting to the platform. Then fol
lowed the singing of the Appenzell hymns
and the long address by the landmann, dur
ing which every man removed his hat. After
the address there was a silent prayer of
half a minute, and then the voting began.
"The men to be voted for happened to be
the officers who had already served, and
who were up for re-election. The name of
each candidate was called out by the sheriff
In a voice that was almost If not quite a
roar. Then came the question, 'Will you
replace him?' No one moved, but at the
question, 'Will you confirm him?' a sea. of
hands went up on the instant; and so it was
in every case. Such absolute unanimity was
refreshing to see. Apparently there was no
division Into parties. The people knew
their men and knew what they wanted. The
vote was unanimous for each man, but one
of the Judges had died In October and his
place was to be filled; so after the others
had been confirmed the landmann called
for nominations from the crowd. Every man
has the right to nominate any one he
pleases who is a citizen and resident of the
canton. So from out the crowd one heard
names called.
"When some half dosen names had been
chosen they were read aloud and proposed
for vote, one by one. At each name there
came a sprinkling of hands over the crowd
till the name arrived that the majority of
the crowd had evidently fixed upon, and
then came the same unmistakable upraising
of hands In such numbers that there was
absolutely no doubt as to who was elected,
and his election was declared*at once by the
landmann.
"After all the officers were elected the
landmann took the oath of office, and then
the whole crowd, raising their right hands,
took -the oath of allegiance, repeating aloud
arises a doubt as to the vote, the voters are
marched In front of the platform In fours
and counted. After the vote for officers the
question of changing: the constitution, that
the government might be carried on In a
more modern fashion was brought up, and
promptly and unanimously voted down.
The Deceitful Accomplice.
From the New York Tribune.
George W. Whitehead, appraiser of mer
chandise at the port of New York, was
talking about smuggling.
"No great amount of smuggling is done."
he said. "To smuggle extensively, It Is
necessary to have accomplices. These ac
complices cheat you, or you cheat them,
and then they betray you. Altogether, in
the end, you lose rather than gain."
Mr. Whitehead smiled.
"Not so long ago," he said, " a certain
skipper hailed a fisherman off the coast,
and asked him if he would smugglu ashore
for him a cask of brandy.
"The fisherman agreed, and two <-asks of
brandy were lowered into his boat.
" 'One, said the skipper, 'is for your
trouble and risk, my man.'
"Well, a week or so later the skipper
called with a team at the Jersey fisherman'*
house for hlB cast: of brandy. It was night.
He got the cask, and started on the dark
and lonely way back home.
"But the custom house people have sharp
eyes and ears. They lay in wait for the
skipper. They caught him a mile outside
of the fisherman's village, and there was
the cask of brandy In the wagon.
"He said nothing. There was nothing to
say. The cask was opened.
" 'We'll sample this fine liquor,' said a
customs officer.
"And he put his mouth to the bung, and
then drew back, amased. The skipper was
amazed, too. The cask contained nothing
but water."
One Who Didn't,
From the Chlcaec TrStess.
Delilah had run the clippers through Sam
son's hair. 1
"Now, then," she said, "wo shall see If he
keeps his long-haired ways."
It appeared from subsequent events that
he did not.
