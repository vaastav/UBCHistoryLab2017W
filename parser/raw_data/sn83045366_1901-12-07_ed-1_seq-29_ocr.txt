against the horizon. Ships passed under full sail up and down
the great waterway of the nations. But the sunshine and the
peaceful day bore no message to me.
"I lay moodily picking at the coverlet, sick and discouraged
and sore—l hardly knew why myself. Until all at once there
•ailed past, close inshore, a ship flying at the top the flag of
freedom, blown out on the breeze till every star in it shone
bright and clear. That moment I knew I should get well.
"Gone were illness, discouragement and gloom! Forgotten
weakness and suffering, the cautions of doctor and nurse. I sat
tip in bed and shouted, laughed and cried by turns, waving my
handkerchief to the flag out there.
"They thought I had lest my head, but I told them no,
thank God! I had found it, and my heart, too, at last. I knew
then that it was my flag; that my children's home was mine in
deed; that I also had become an American in truth."
Such an experience comes to but few, and it is almost worth
being foreign-born and ill away from an adopted country to
have one such hour come into one's life. This story of the life
Of Jacob Riis is one every boy and girl should read. His begin
ning was small, his discouragements many, but the character and
the success which Jacob Riis embodies to-day are worth study
and emulation by the most ambitious.

Where Ye SpanKweed Grows.
There's a corner in our garden, but my nurse won't tell me where.
That little boys must never see, but always must beware.
And in that corner, all the year, in rows, and rows and rows,
A dreadful little flower called the
Spankweed
Grows!
My nurse says that if a boy who doesn't wash his face,
Or pulls his little sister's hair, should ever find that place,
The spankweed just would jump at him and dust his little clothes.
Oh, it's never safe for fellers where the
Spankweed
Grows!
Some day I'll get the sickle from our hired man, and then
I'll go and find that spankweed place—it's somewhere in the glen,
And when I get a-swingin' it and puttin* in my blows,
I bet there'll be excitement where the
Spankweed
Grows!

A MONSTER LIZARD.
One of the rarest animals is the monster lizard of Japan, a
specimen of which was recently captured. It often attains a
length of five feet, weighing over fifty pounds. It infests the
mountain lakes, and, being very voracious, soon exterminates
all the fish where It happens to be. The Japanese hunt it for the
sake of its skin, which is supposed to have powerful medicinal
qualities. This lizard belongs to the salamander family. Its
skin, like that of salamanders, contains a poison which these
amphibians can eject at will from the glands. Frogs inoculated
with this poison die in a half hour and rabbits so treated perish
even more quickly.

The most notable foreign comment is that of the Westminster
Gazette, London, which gays in reference to the recommendation
on the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine: "When the United
States, after warning Europe not to enter America, proceeds
Itself to step out from the American continent, even a theoretical
defense is difficult. The situation has the germs of an immense
controversy in the future."
The supreme. court made a very important decision during
the week upon the status of the Philippines, as to whether or
not they are foreign territory. The decision was rendered in the
"fourteen-diamond-rings case." Pepke, a soldier in one of the
regiments sent to the Philippines, brought home fourteen dia
mond rings. They passed the customs officers at San Francisco,
but after he was mustered out the rings were seized at Chicago,
on the charge that they had been imported from a foreign coun
try and that he had not paid duty upon them. The case went
Into the courts and was decided against —that is, the judge
■who had the case believed that the Philippines are foreign terri

has just decided that the islands are not foreign territory, and
that for this reason PeDke will not be required to pay the customs
duties claimed. ;?;>;:-:
Chief Justice Puller said that in his judgment the Philippines
became domestic territory from the moment the treaty of peace
between Spain and the United States was signed at Paris.

THE JOURNAL JUNIOR, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1901,
From Schools the World Around
School Life in Montreal as Told by Two.
This story of school life in Montreal, written in reply to one
by Sidonia Matthews, Marshall, Minn., gives a bright picture
of the social side of high schools in Canada. Juniors who enjoy
the Journal Junior prize pictures in their schoolrooms, will
especially appreciate the pride the Montreal high school students
have in the decorations of their halls and rooms.
This story has not been changed in any way by the editor.
*
HW public school system in Montreal is very much like
that in existence in the United States, except that tui
* J tion is not entirely free. The High School proper, to
which we belong, presents a course of four years to
' '' graduates from the public schools. Our High School
building, which is a beautiful structure enclosing a square court
yard, contains all the grades from the kindergarten to the Sixth
Form, or last grade, which prepares students for entrance to the
University. The boys occupy one side of the building and the
girls the other. The Principal's offices and those of the Com
mittee which controls the Protestant Public Schools of Montreal
are also in the building.
Montrealers are justly proud of their High School. Its long
corridors are lined with pictures bought from the proceeds of the
annual school concert. At the foot of the Girls' stairway there
is a beautiful Venus de Milo, a recent present to the schooL
The large cheerful schoolrooms are beautified by numerons
pictures and busts, some of which occasionally offer an outlet
for the exuberant spirits of our Sixth Form Boys, with the
sad result that Caesar has been seen with a youthful bloom
upon his stern cheek—this bloom being due to the judicious use
of those two famous cosmetics, red ink and chalk. Milton on one
occasion seemed to be suffering with toothache, for he peered
wonderingly forth from the soothing folds of the Union Jack.
But be it understood that these outrages are committed only
after some great and joyous event, such as the relief of Lady
smith or a school victory at hockey.
A few years ago our School Board thought best to abolish
the giving of prizes as rewards for successful work in the June
Examinations —(those fearful yearly tests of our knowledge)—
and to use the money thus saved for the purpose of enlarging our
class libraries. At first we missed the piles of books on the
platform at Closing Day, but now we see that the change is a
beneficial one.
We are so fortunate as to possess a large and well-appointed
gymnasium which is in constant use. During the winter it does
good service as the scene of many a revel —it witnesses class
"At Homes" and frolics, and affords a bright and pleasant shelter
to chilly young people on their return from some long sleigh
drive round the mountain. The Assembly Hall, used for concerts,
lectures, and the weekly gatherings of the school, seats 1,200
people.
Our school staff consists of the Rector, the lady principal, the
tives, was heartbroken over the result of the quarrel, but it is
said now that she has succeeded in bringing about a partial re
conciliation between husband and wife.
The Colombian rebels, who have occupied Colon for two
weeks, were forced to surrender on Nov. 29. The surrender of
men and arms was made to Captain Perry, commander of the
lowa, who in turn handed them over to General Alban, of the
government forces.
Lack of . ammunition was the cause of the surrender. The
conduct of the liberals during the occupation was such as to gain
the respect of the majority of the citizens of Colon, especially
of the foreign element.
Italy, which has always been known as the most debt-ridden
country in the world, is at last able to show a surplus of 41,000,
--000 lire. The minister of finance said also in his report, that
he expected a surplus of at least 13,000,000 for the coming year.
Negotiations have been completed as to the sale of the Dan
ish West Indies, and the treaty will probably be signed this week
at Washington. The price is between $4,000,000 and $5,000,000. •
General Chaffee has recommended that Aguinaldo be brought
to the United States. Private letters from the Philippines say
that Aguinaldo has been detected in carrying on treasonable cor
respondence and in trying to stir up strife. '
Counsel for the Spanish government has asked that all claims
growing, out of the sinking of the Maine be dismissed. They
say that the destruction of Spanish lives and the loss of Spanish
possessions has atoned for and settled any supposed responsi
bility of Spain for the destruction of that national vessel with
its officers and crew.
Yoshio Yamamoto, a prince of the imperial family of Japan
is working in the Pennsylvania railroad shops as a common la
borer, to learn how to make locomotives as Americans do. He
expects to spend three years in the study of our system of build
ing locomotives. He says he already knows how to build locomo
tives, but now he wants to know how Americans do it.
Miss Stone was alive on Thanksgiving Day according to a let
ter received from her bearing that date. She says that at a meet
ing of the committee it was decided not to kill the prisoners upon
any pretext whatever, but that the committee insisted upon the
payment of the full amount of the ransom.
Great preparations have been made for the return of the
court to Peking. Foreign residents say that they have never
seen the palaces and public buildings look as imposing as they
do now in the glory of their new paint and gilding. A high offi
cial of the court has memorialized the throne to publish an
illustrated book.showing the sufferings of the court during its
flight from Peking, and that the book be circulated extensively
throughout China, to show the people what they were respon
sible for by countenancing the boxer uprising.
■ As a reactionary effect of the boxer movement, large numbers
of Chinese at Kaio Chow are becoming professed Christians. *

lady teachers and the masters, all of whom take the greatest
interest in everything concerning the school. They participate
in our gaieties as well as guide us in our studies. These studies
are very similar to those taken up by our American cousins, ex
cept that French is a subject all through our r arse. We also
study German, but only during our last two years at school.
By the present arrangement in the High School the senior girla
enjoy the advantage of having their afternoons free. The hours
are from nine till two, with half an hour off for luncheon as weU
as a short recess.
A description of our school life would be incomplete without
mention of the various sports in which our boy 3 distingu ah
themselves. Hockey and basket ball seem the favorite ganus,
and are enthusiastically played during the cool months. As yet
we girls do not share largely in these sports, though we hay»
a very good basket ball team, whose valiant conduct has done
much to uphold the honor of the school.
Much more might be written on this subject, but this little
sketch may serve to give others some idea of the school life of
the girls and boys of Montreal.

PERSIMMON TREES.
The growth of persimmon trees in old fields in the south has
been looked upon as a curse. The persimmon trees will spring up
almost like corn. It takes a lot of digging and grubbing to keep
them down. But a valuable use has been found for persimmon
wood, which is dense in fiber, heavy and capable of polish. This
is for shuttle blocks in the looms of cotton mills. A few days
ago a solid train containing eighteen carloads of persimmon and
dogwood shuttle blocks was shipped from Grimes' shuttle block
factory at Chattanooga direct to England, via Norfolk. This
factory has only been in operation ten months, but is enjoying a
big trade. The making of these shuttle blocks will doubtless be
come an important industry in the south.
RARE CONDOR EGGS.
Another bird believed to have become extinct is the Califor
nia condor, twice as large as the condor of the Andes. Its
length was 5 feet, weight 25 pounds, and spread of wings 12
feet. An egg of thla bird is worth $2,000 to collectors, but none
has been found for seventeen yearß. Eggs of the golden eagle
Bell in San Francisco for $32 each.
CHAFING DISHES ARE OLD.
Among the ruins of Pompeii have been found chafing dishes
of exquisite workmanship, which gives undisputed proof of their
use in the city which contained villas of many wealthy Romans.
Of course they were. History repeats itself in the way of luxuries
as in the path of anything else.
Among other things she will have a new figurehead and a new
stern piece. The figure head is that of a winged Victory, seven
feet in height, her wings thrown back against the sides of the
prow, holding above her head an eagle about to take flight, her
feet resting upon a shoal of dolphins. The stern piece is a big
shield with an open space in a scroll frame for the name Olympia,
surmounted by the national shield with an eagle perched upon
it, and on either side, running forward about six feet, are scroll
work, dolphins and figures emblematic of war. The two-, weigh
ing about 3,000 pounds, were cast from bronze taken from the
bow torpedo tubes, now useless.

He was a little question mark
That looked just like a boy;
And when some guileless soul would hark
His queries, 'twas a joy!
Ah! then piled he his blithesome task,
Of matters far and wide
To ask, and ask, and ask, and ask.
And ne'er be satisfied.
Or friend or foe, to him 'twere one.
If but his victim waited
. To hear, of some things 'neath the sun. ■

Alack! we reached the fearsome pass.
If aught were named on earth.
Of man, or beast, or fish, or grass,
This sort of thing—?—??—???—had birth.

TEXAN OIL FIELDS. .'- ■.
There are 70,000 to 80,000 oil wells in the United States, pro
ducing about 160,000 barrels a day. There are a dozen new wells
at Beaumont which have a capacity beyond the total of then
other 70,000 or 80,000. These Beaumont wells can produce sev
eral hundred thousand barrels a day, and though their capacity
must naturally diminish, as is always the case with such gushers,
the many new wells now being bored may possibly offset this,
and thus give to Texas • greater oil production than the United
States now has.
A RELIC OF THE SIEGE.
One of the most striking relics of the siege of the legations
In Peking last year is to be exhibited in London. It is a flag
torn almost to shreds by the incessant fusillade. Throughout the
siege this flag floated over the British quarters. It was taken
to England by Sir ClaudV Mootkmald.
