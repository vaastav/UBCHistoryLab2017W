cram to THE BEE. ] The Indian situation
o Is hourly growing moro threatening. No
word has been received up to this hour from
the party of armed ranchers and cowboys
who went out to defend the outlying
ranches and .to punish the depredating
Sioux. Kunucra canio eaily Into General
Curr's camp and reported llvo Sioux
Indians killed on Battle crcolc by cowbsys
hut no dependence can bo placed on this re
port. That shots have been exchanged yes
tcrday and today IH without doubt.
A largo number of Springfield rifles with
ammunition were received hero today from
the governor of the state to arm ranchers and
Bottlers In small settlements. This is the
third or fourth lot which has been received ,
nnd all settlers nro now pretty well armed.
General Carr of the Sixth cavalry received

fast as possible from Fort Mcade , S. D , ,
Boxes nnd bales of clothing , tontago , nmmu

camp , which presents a most warlike
appearance. Enrlv this morning troop
D , of tun Sixth cavalry , arrived from
Fort Stanton nnd Joined the regiment hero
which now brings the force of the Sixtl
cavalry ciimpod hero to nearly 000. Each
troop of cavalry is provided with three six
mule teams , ten pack animals and two saddle
mules. Whatever is needed to fully equip
the command nnd haul supplies will bo hi :
in Uapid City.
General Carr has received word that the
flrst action will bo to sco that no parties of
Sioux Indians , particularly from Pine Ridge ,
commit depredations or roam about among
tbo settlements along the Cheyenne river ,
tuklug In the region particularly from Battle
Creole to the Big Box Elder.
Captain Cnrr , First cavalry , with four
troops of cavalry from Fort Lcavcnworth , Is

with two troops , has been ordered .to
Buffalo Gap to look out for tba region along

enno river about six miles from the Junction
of Belle Tourcho with three troops of the
Third Infantry , his moro particular duty be

ceed this evening on a scout for ton davs to
Choycnno river nnd Battle Creek. Major
Perry has orders to arrest all Indians found
plllaclnK or plundering or any whom ho may
suspect of having done so. What the out
come of this will bo no ono can toll. The In
dians will no doubt resist arrest , and if they
do they will in all probability bo shot nnd
killed , and if this is the case it will surely
precipitate hostilities.
Lnto this evening thcro was delivered In
camp three Hotchklss broach loading moun-
tnln guns , calibre 105 , with 150 rounds of
ntnunltlon to each gun. These guns were
ehlpped from Fort Mcade and are manned

PINK Union AGENCY , S. D. , Dec. 9. [ Spe
cial to TUB Bnn.l Gre.U curiosity nnd much
uixloty Is now being felt as to what will DO
the next move made by the military. That
lomo move must and will bo made soon thcro
Is not the slightest doubt. This is war
ranted by a hundred little occurrences and
Hops that wo see every day In connection
with the officers , arrangement of supplies ,
7cfurnlshing of marching equipment , etc. ,
etc. The fact mentioned in Tuesday's dis
patches , namely , that a scout hud reported

Instead of away from them , ns General ,
Brooke was led to believe they would , from
Saturday's council , Is mother point indicat

There is little or no foundation foi
tupposmg the hostiles will bo allowed
to winter , undisturbed , la the bad lands. In
deed , nothing is further from the present In.
tentlonsvof the war department , and In say.

And the sentiment quoted is that of nearlj

the strain quoted Is becoming stronger am

The report that tno hostiles have movei

KANSAS CITT , Mo. , Dec. 10. [ Special Tclc-
prain to THK BEK. ] The Times Is In receipt
of nn official dispatch from Captain Woodson
at Fort Hcno denying the reported Indian
outbreak there. It Is as follows :
The sensational reports sent to the press
about n threatened outbreak of the Chcycnnes
and Arapahoos in Oklahoma are without
foundation. The sensational report of a
scare at Frisco was grossly exaggerated ,
for , in fact , thcro was not an In
dian within twelve miles of the plnco.
The recent conduct of the members of the
Oklahoma legislature only aggravated the
condition of affairs. The Indians are peace
ably disposed and act and dance without
making any threats. The ghost dances have
died out somewhat , but the ether perform
ances continue. If there should bo
any outbreak hero the commanding officer
nt Fort Hcno will bo the first to learn of it.
The settlers will bo given duo warning.

tary DlHplay nt the World'H Fair.
CIIICACIO , Dec. 10. The Illinois National
Guard association held an annual meeting
hero today , the most important In its history.
Not only is the gathering given importance
owing to the fact that its action will decide the
question of n military display at the world's
fnlr , but ono entire regiment of the Infantry
of the Illinois national guard will bo wiped out
of existence ns a result of its action. General
Fitzslmmons , In bis opening spjccli , referred
to the necessity of a sufficiently lurgo appro
priation for next year's encampments. Many
speeches In the snmo vein wcro made. Lieu
tenant Colonel Turner thought another year
without a cump would work great harm.
Adjutant General Vance nnd Colonel Bryan
of tho'governor's staff nlso believed in the
necessity of annual camps and moro liberal
appropriations. Governor Flfor , It was
stated , will heartily endorse any action
of the convention. Major Taylor
E. Brown of the First Infantry
crcated a decided Bensntlon with his paper
on the "Abuse of the Uniform. " Ho de-
denounced civil societies of nil sorts who
were uniforms as cheap seekers after glory
nnd wanted a law prohibiting anyone except
the regular army and militia wearing uni
forms. Major Brown slashed right nnd loft
nnd indulged In personalities which cut some
of the officers deeply. Ho characterized the
staff of the governor as a useless institution
composed ol young men appointed because of
a political pull. They had no ability to handle
troops and the position was an cnsy ono to
acquire , After reading the paper the con
vention adjourned until afternoon nnd many
expressions of opinion were Indulged in ru-
pardmg Brown's remarks , nearly every one
agreeing they were unwarranted. Ono mem
ber of Governor Fifer's staff , who is a veteran
of the Into war , sharply criticised Brown as anew
now Hedged major who never saw
ono minute's service. At the afternoon ses
sion Major Brown apologized for his utter
ances regarding the governor's staff nnd that
part of his speech was stricken from the
record.
Lieutenant Colonel Ziecfold rend an elabo
rate paper on "What Part Shall the National
Guard Take In the World's Fair. " Colonel
Culp of Kansas , secretary of the committee

tion , dedication ceremonies , daily routine ,
etc. , which was discussed ut length.
Adjutant General Vance was of the opinion
that plans should bo outlined by tno fair com

WASHINGTON- . C. , Dec. O.I ,
Senator Cameron throw the llrst bombshell
into the ranks of the force bill advocates
today by letting It bo known among them
that ho would vote against the bill no matter
what form It took , It has boon thought that
some of the republican senators were waver
ing , but this was the first open declaration
from any of them , Senator Cameron said tea
a friend : "I will vote against the election bill
whatever form It may assume. 1 am opposed
to It in principle and Inlts details. The south
is now resuming n quiet condition , northern
capital has been flowing Into tbo south In
great quantities ; manufacturing establish
ments have been created ana are now In full
operation and n community of commercial
Interests is fast obliterating sectional lines
and will llnally result In the not far distant
future in forming a homogenous mass of people -
plo whether living in the north , south , cost
or west. The election law would disturb this
condition and produce 111 feeling between the
north aim the south. I am therefore opposed
to the bill and shall assort my Independence
as a senator nnd cast my vote against the
measure. "
On the other hand President Harrison is
throwing his personality into the con test with
a determination to pass the bill this week if
possible and before the holidays in any event ,
lie is conferring with these senators who arc
believed to bo wavering in their allegiance to-
the measure and Is letting them understand
that the administration is determined to have
the bill pass if It Is a possible thing. It is not
known whether Senator Cameron was ore of
these conferred with , but In any event the
senator's determination is final. It Is being
remarked as significant that Senator Quay
led tbo last session and now another Penn
sylvanlnn follows suit.
DEAP SOLDIERS' rnxsioxs.
Chairman Merrill of the house committee
on invalid pensions in answer to the inquiry
as to whether there was any probability of
the adoption of the bill increasing the pen
sion of deaf soldiers from f 10 to (40 a month
said that the low condition of the surplus in
the treasury and the outcry that has been
made against recent pension legislation mnko
it impossible for any general pension bill to
become a law nt this session. Ho stated
that the committee would endeavor to pass
private bills but that ho did not believe any
general pension legislation whatever could
b3 had at this session. Tbu deaf sol
diers bill is very popular and
since it carrieslli \ It onlv
$300,000 a year It was naturally supposed
tiero would bo no opposition offered , but
there is now serious opposition to every o'ass
of legislation pertaining to pensions. The
democrats nro in the broach and they nro
fighting as hard na they can to defeat not
only tbo proposed pension legislation but to
secure the repeal or many of tno Just' ' penson
laws now upon the statutes. There can bo
no doubt that If the democrats were In the
majority in both houses nnd bad the presi
dency they would repeal the recently enacted
disability pension law and would pass a law
Intended to make pension legislation obnox
ious by providing for the raising of pension
moiioy by direct taxation. The democrats in
the house went so far the ether day as to
antagonize the general pension bill aud
fought its consideration , offering as a substi
tute for the order of the day tbo private
calendar.

It was upon the appeal of that company that

JUSTICE MILLER'S sucocsson.
There continues to bo much talk around
congress today as to who would fill the va
cancy on the supreme bench caused by the
death of Associate Justice Miller , and the
name of Attorney General Miller was In al
most everyone's mouth. Tlicro can bo no
doubt that Attorney General Miller's ap
pointment would bo very acceptable and the
nomination would bo promptly confirmed by
tbo senate. The Impression prevails in ad
ministration circles , hawovor , although the
president has given no expression whatever ,
that In this appointment the present composi
tion of the cabinet will not be disturbed.
MAJOR TUSH RELIEVED.
Alnjor Daniel N. Bash of Chicago , the army

Superintendent I'orter of the census ofllco

cerning the attempted census frauds In Min
neapolis and St. Paul. In speaking of the
matter today he said that a moro systematic
scheme to obtain credit for more population
than either citv possessed could hardly have
been conceived. In Minneapolis even the
records of births and deaths were so changed
as to correspond with the excessive popula
tion shown by the enumerators' reports.
The Investigation has developed the fact that
the population of Minneapolis by the first
count was iM.OOO in excess of the actual

One Gypd Uffoot oC Poor Crops for
Farm Product * * .
"WASIUNOTOX , Deo. 10. Statistical returns
for the department of agriculture for Decem
ber give the average farm prices of agricul
tural products from estimates made by both
the government and state agents. The pres
ent corn crop Is worth moro than the last and
the farmers will receive moro for it. Unfor
tunately the districts of failure do not realize
their portion of advance In average vnluo.
The average price by present returns ia 50.1
cents per bushel , against 28.8 for 1889 , an In
crease of 77 per cent. Ills the highest De
cember price of the decade , except In 1881 ,
when the average rose to03.0 cents , that be-i
Ing the only year In the decade In which the
final average of condition was worse than
that of the present season. The present av
erage shows small crops are n sure euro for
low prices. The prices In seven corn surplus
states are : Onlo , Cl cents ; Indiana ,
47 ; Illinois , 4i ! ; Iowa. 41 ; Missouri ,
44 ; Kansas 51 ; Nebraska , 48. The
average farm value of the wheat
crop Is estimated at 84 cents per bushel
against C9.8 for 1889. Thovnluoof wheat is
effected by the harvests of other countries
and therefore prices are not entirely gov
erned by the sire of the homo grown crop.
The prtco of oats responded sharply to the
pressure of the small crop and increased de
mand because of the short corn crop. The
average is 4iJ.3 cents , against 23 cents last
year , It Is the highest reported since 1881.
llyo , llko oats , at O-.D cents , la higher than
since 1881 , and the same is true of barley nt
04.8. The dolljlency in the potato crop has
caused on advance in value in all sections of
the country. The overage is 77.7 cents , an
increase of moro thnn 90 per cent over prices
of the past two years. The returns show
slightly higher prices for tobacco than hnvo
prevailed since 18S7. Hayalonoof all farm
products records a decline from last jcar.
The present price is $7.74 per ton , and the
falling oft la duo to the increased product.
