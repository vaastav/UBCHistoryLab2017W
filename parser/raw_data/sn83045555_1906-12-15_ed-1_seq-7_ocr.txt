fir the future nnd In this connection cf
forrs have been concentrated In im
proving the existing holdings Especial
ly dors this hold good when it comes to
tho terminal facilities at Ogden and
Salt Lake In Ogden the Itlo Grand
Western has been spending n lot of
money In rearranging Its yards erect
Ing a new freight depot closer to tho
dealt of the business section and look
lif after general Improvements The
Harriman lines however have spent
fosibiy more In the same direction
notable among this years accomplish
ments being the completion of tho sand
rljge cutoff which now permits trains
to pull straight Into the newly arranged
yards without backing around tho wye
m hw been tho custom In years past
The Harriman lines too havo con

other McilltlH at Ogder a proceeding
Ibkh required the erection tit several

TERMINAL IMPROVEMENTS
In Suit Lake however tho terminal
Improvements are the most marked
From Second South to Ninth North bo
tnecn Third and Tlfth West streets
the Oregon Short Lino has wrought
great changes Practically the whole
of this big expanse of valuable realty
has bern torn up by steam shovels and
converted Into n nctwoik of tracks
Over the slteM of erstwhile comfort
nbK dwellings now rumblo long strings
of freight and passenger cars whllo
most of the noisy switching that used
to bo Instituted in the vicinity ot the
depot Is now transferred to tho north
yards which were completed this year
at a great expense and arc now sec
old U none In tho country from point
ct Millies and convenience
ma PREIOHT DEPOT
In addition the Oregon Short Line has
ft ted a huge height depot which
stands for nn entire city block be

streets on Fourth West
At the present tlmo a force of struc
tural steel workers IN ongaged upon
erecting ft viaduct for street curs ve
bliihr traffic and pedestrians This

to the abolishment of the deadly grade

All this work Is being carried on pre
juratory to tho erection of the big

THE PROSPECTIVE ROUTE
It present plans mv followed the
Western Pacific otter leaving tho Great
American desert will run almost due
west to Silver Konc PJSS n distance of
about 21 miles and then the survey
goes ncross A flat valley crossing the
Nevada Northern nt Goshuto about 20
miles from Cobro the northern termin
us of the Nevada Northern A few
miles west of this lino tho Western
Pacific will cross Flower Lake pass
which Is about 23 miles from the Ne
soda Utah state line At this point an
ordinary switchback will bo built which
will bo urea until the long tunnel at
this place Is completed This plan of
building shoo Ilys will be curried
through so that the road will U > com
pleted at an onrly date Some of these
temporary tracks will havo gradients
of 6 per cent and they will be utilized
until the grade with Its big flits and
tunnels is eventually completed when
Gould will have the quickest route
through to the Paclllc
TWO DISTRICT SURVEYS
At Flower Lake pass tho engineers
have mado two distinct surveys One
of them Is tor a tunnel to bo 12000 feet
long and the other Is for a tunnel > 20Q
feet long In these two plans there Is
a difference of about 4 miles In tho
length of the road In keeping tho grade
down Out of Salt Lake the Sliver
Zonn tunnel will bo the first encoun
tered ThlH will be 6200 feet long
with six mllo approaches on either side
to permit of nn easy grade This tun
nel which Is to be bored by tho Utah
Construction company will be built
upon the same lines as the famous As

SALT LAKE ROUTE
Some years ago when the Salt Laka
Route was first projected It was con
fident expected that the new line
would develop a wonderful amount of j
traffic Its must enthusiastic project I
or however In giving his estimates of
tho possible business to bo derived
from tilbutary territory failed to fore
see the really remarkable progress Hint
linn been noticed since the road start
ed Its first through train May 1 1901 I
For years It had been known that the I
region of southern Nevada to be tra
versed by the Clark road was one nit
boll of lime stone spoken of In a gen
cial way Hut It was not until tho
rails were laid that the country WRY I
really prospected with the result that
today some of the busies camps of the
west arc located along the route of Mill
new line to California
At this wilting the company ban in
mind several Detentions aimed to do
velop still further mlntrul isnounes
One of then the Plochu branch will
positively be built mill burring delay

other branch talked of but not sullied
yet Is one leading wet from Tlntlc

more than tho automobile Is driving out

With the Installation of the new cur

of country life the need of moderate

REALTY ASSOCIATION
It would bo decidedly improper to
conclude A resumo of the real estate
markot and tho history of the year
without reference to tho Salt Lake
Real Estate association This body
of hustlers has dune ax much h
and public spirited work as any or
ganlzttlon In the city Its Influence Is
Ml not only In business but In the
governing force of the city It Is rec
ognized that the association has be
come nn Important factor of public
opinion Attempts to make a tool of J1
the association III the Interest of po
litical parties have fulled and while
A few individuals have Gomprrsllke
tried to enter the body Into the politic
al arena the conservative and con
trolling force has refused tn permit It
to he used for any such purposes
The Real Estate HHioclatlon like the
Commercial club In working fur Salt
Lake ami not for politicians It has
been the promoter of better streets
sidewalk and street paving extended
sewer districts better limitation and
street car projects have received Its un
divided support and the new gas com
r my watt endoiaed and assist i in en
tering the Salt Luke Held In short
the association believe that anything
which contribute to better public utlll
till here makes Salt Iake real state
more valuable
The beat Indication of the real es
late market nt tic present day Is the
nourishing condition of the Real Estate
association which has Increased in
membership and eltlclonry during the
past year Real Kstnte day the out
lug of the hustlers and their friends
each midsummer has now become an
established holiday
Once again It may be repeated the
day of the croaker In Salt halts Is
past the day of the booster Is at hand
The man who fur political personal or
other selfish reasons disparages be
littles or trnducc his toivn ilnds his
