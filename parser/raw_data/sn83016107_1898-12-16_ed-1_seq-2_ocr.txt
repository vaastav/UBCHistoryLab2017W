Til B RACE PROBLEM IX POL I. I S
Those who can look back to the li.’.-f
Congress after the closing of the Civil
war. will remember with what inor
dinate haste the Republican Fader
began to legislate for the
status of the negro. Of such para
mount importance was the African
race in the eyes of the Republican
party at that time, that upen the very
first day of the session, before either
House had yet received the annual
message of the President, the colored
brother was being rushed into full
fledged citizenship by the partisans in
power. Hill upon bill and resolution
after resolution was introduced iu hi?
behalf. Freedom must be immediate
ly supplemented with franchise and
the G O P must, at the same time, be
fully protected against any- love’s
labor lost, and so Mr. Stevens, in the
House, offered an amendment to the
Constitution apportioning representa
tives according to the number of
voters iu each State. “Impartial jus
tice," “equality before the law” and
“Republican form of government”
were the designated terms mostly used
with which to whitewash the political
brush-heap, from out of which the
negro presently emerged,fully clothed
in a ready made garment of American
suffrage, ill fitting to he sure, but with
the positive assurance guaranteed to
him that, in future, all defects would
be remedied should he consent to a
bias insertion, after the fashion plate
of the Republican party. Thus the
negro, the least advanced among the
rae -s of the earth, was broug Ift for
ward to participate in and enjoy those
privileges possessed only by the Anglo
—American, as the well earned herit
age which had come down from a
struggle for advancement through
centuries of enlightening civilization.
We have no doubt but that there
were some who favored the bestowing
of civil rights and suffrage upon the
negro, from a desire that he should be
advanced in his mental and moral
nature and that he would come out
of his old environments sufficiently
prepared for the solution of the world
problem of raising all races to the
same level of Christian morality. Un
fortunately this class of well wishers
have never had a potential voice in
the controlling power of the negro
race. The power to which he has
looked for guidance has been that
which was generated iu the brains of
scheming politicians of the most parti
san order, and who gave him his poli
tical status for the sole purpose of
perpetuating the power of the Repub
lican party.
The sudden transformation of the
negro, :u enfranchising him with the
rights aad privileges of the white
man, simply placed him, for a time,in
a new condition of servitude and made
him the chattel of a party, which, with
out the aid of his vote would be a
hopeless minority in several of (he
States, and especially so iu Maryland.
But now, the new political member
of the body politic has been so fre
quently pandered to, by prominent
politicians, has been so patted upon
the back and embraced, cheek by
jowl, by sympathetic and sensitive
newspapers though hide bound and
hide-tough on most other subjects—
that he has been forcibly made con
scious of his political strength and
seeks to demonstrate it by forging to
the front, not upon the ground of his
party principles, but by reason of bis
color, as a member of his race. Under
the system of tutelage in vogue he is
looking forward, in the Southern
Sates, to the ultimate displacameutof
the white man from control, and to
anchor in his place, one of his own
dusky hue. The white population,
particularly in that section of the
country, should it willingly acquiesce
in tiie depravity of ignorance as dis
played in the numerical strength of
the negro at the polls, must in future
be content with a relegated position
into the steerage of the new ship
of-State, while the colored commander
enjoys the emoluments of a quarter
deck commission.
That this is no fancy sketch of
future possibilities, it is only necessary
to look pack a couple of years and
see a negro candidate for Mayor of
Baltimore, and the determined pur
pose at that time for race representa
tion iu the lawmaking branch of our
State Government. If there is any
thing lacking to furnish conclusive
proof that the negro’s power through
the ballot means the practical supre
macy of the black over the white
American, the wholesale distribution
of offices to him in North Carolina
and his arrogant assumption of his
superiorly engendered thereby,ought
to be sufficiently convincing. Nor is
the thirst for political preferment by
the negro race the only’ bad legacy
bestowed by the selfish legislation of
the Republican party. It has been
legislated into a position of such ex
aggerated importance, when a large
majority have but liitle conception
of the duties pertaining to good citizen
ship, that a reckless disregard for any
thing which does not comport with
the idea of an absolute and universal
equality with white men and women,
brings at once into action the violent
and insolent demeanor which springs
from a too speedy and unprepared for
admission within the portals of
American liberty. At this very time
the legislative branch of the national
government is engaged in enlarging
this same mantle of liberty, and will
endeavor to cast it upon the shoulders
of millions beyond the sea, when,
within the.contines of our own borders
it has become necessary, in several
States, to call a halt and ponder upon
what al 1 men know, but most men
forget, that “there is no legal short
cut to Christian civilization,” and
that suffrage and civil rights alone,
can not t uarantee a moral solution of
the problem that so vitally interests
the American people.

Tin: PEACE i BEATY SIOXED. ~
The peace treaty between the
United States and Spain was signed
on Saturday night December 19th
and the closing scene of the war took
nlaee. It was a striking scene, and
would have been a spend id subject
for a historical picture. The group
gathered around the table was com
posed of able men, representing on
the one side the youngest of nations,
and on the other one of the oldest
countries upon the atlas of tiie world.
The difference in the emotions of the
two parties can be more easily imagin
ed than described, the ill concealed
jr>v of the Americans contrasting
?v.v)..gl i with the sadness and dejec
tion of the Spaniards.
Both copies of the treaty, were tied
with the colors of the two interested
nations and sealed (as a compliment)
with the tri-colors of France.
The prominent features of the treaty
of Paris have been so often published
and commented upon, that there is no
necessity of their rehearsal at this
time.
America is to pay tor sending home
the Spanish troops from ail of the
late colonies. The Spaniards are to
release and return all prisoners belt,
by them. They are also to retail:
possession of all military stores and
munitions of war in the Philippines
iitiel of such ships as have not been
captured.
The commercial treaties which the
war ruptured are to be renewed at
the convenience of the two nation;'.
The treaty consists of seventeen
articles, the protocol making nearly
six hundred type written pages, tlie
full text of which will not be made
public until the formal ratification is
made by the United States Senate and
the Spanish Cortes.
After the treaty had been signed,—
which was done iu the following man
tier; William R. Day, Senator Cush
man K. Davis, Senator William P
Frye, Whitelaw Reid, Senator George
Gray, Seuor Montero Rios, Senor
Abarsuza, Senor Garnica, Seuor
Villaurutia aiyd General Cevero Y.
Saous the American Commission
ers unofficially invited the Spaniards
to dine with them. The reply was,
that the Spaniards would be most
pleased, hut feareel that it would be
unadvisible, because it might be mis
construed at Madrid, where already
much feeling existed against the
Spanish Commissioners.
BEAL II OF UEXEKAL GARCIA.
General Calixio Garcia the disting
uished Cuban soldier, who probably
did more than any other living man
to relieve that oppressed island from
Spanish control, died iu Washington
ou Sunday morning of pneumonia.
He was unconscious for several hours
preceding his death, and iu his ilyiu;
moments was busy issuing orders ti
his son, who was a member of his staff,
concerning a battle with the Span
iards, which he seemed to anticipate.
General Garcia was born in Cogquin
iu tiie Province of Santiago de Cuba,
October 14, 1829, of a distinguished
Cuban family anti spent all of his
lite iu behalf of his beloved country.
He was always considered as the lead
ing conspirator anil prime mover in
the uprising of the Cuban people in
1808. He was captured iu 1875 by
2,000 Spaniards while rceounoitering
with hie escort and sent to Spain,
where for tor four years he was con
fined as a prisoner in castles and for
tresses, remaining titers until tiie
peace of Z in Jon.
Ho succeeded General Antonio
Maceo u.s Commander of the troops of
tiie eastern department, holding the
rank of major general; and after the
death of Mace o, was eleeteil lieuten
ant general of tiie Cuban army, which
position he held until his death.
The remain< were placed on a bier
in the room iu which he die 1 and
covered with the banner of Cuba.
General Mil s ordered that a detach
ment of United S ales soldiers be de
tailed as a bodyguard. Letters of
coniiolence were received from Presi

They were the first two American
re giments to march through Havana.
The (roups were amazed at the in

followed the troops to Mariano, a dis

excessive pleasure, and even the
children shouting the must endearing
names as the North Carolina hoys
marched along.
I POWERFUL EXPLoSIOX.
A powerful explosion occurred at
the Dupont Powder Mills near Wil
mington, Del., on Friday. A com
pressing mill and six grinding mills
were blown up. Three men were
killed and seven badly injured. The
accident by which 2,500 pounds of
powder were blown up, was caused
oy a pair of horses attached to a small
powder car becoming frightened and
jumping. A spark was struck in
front of one of The press mills and the
explosion instantly occurred. An ex
Ireiue!v singular feature of the c ise,
was, neither of the horses nor the driv
er of the car were killed. Nearly ever,,
building iu Wilmington was shaken,
even the missive courthouse tremb
ling at the shock.

In the little Aroostook camp whom I
Worked the w inter I was 10 years old there
arrived an iiiiiiniial kind of vksitur. It
was nothing loss than a lint? colt. The
iier of this unlooked for visitor was a
l>ay man? called Vixen. She had One in*
telli.Lter.ce and great working qualifies,
1 *ut she was bad tempered to all Inr her
Piaster, who thought the world of her.
just now the was in a worse temper than
usual, for she thought her foal ought to
: • in more civilized quarters than those
. f i ho camp stables.
The mam and her baby, however, were
i a red for with a solicitude that should
have softened her heart. It was spring
weather, warm in the sun at midday, and
!) • ides the roomy corner of the stable
which bad been fitted np for my lady’s
accommodation the men had built her a
wide pen in the yard, on the south side of
the stable wail, where she could sun her
offspring at all convenient s asons.
One day, in the early afteritccih, when
the men had gone far off to their chop
ping, the cook and 1 found ourselves alone
in camp. A week .or so before this I had
had the misfortune to sink my ax deep
into my left foot. The cut was a bad one,
and since the accident I had nut been able
to walk a step.
I was sitting on a log where the cook
had placed me when some slight sound
attracted my attention. Glancing toward
the noisi*, my eye caught a glimpse of a
lank, tawny creature stealthily creeping
bet ween the trees on the outer edge of the
clearing. Ills belly dragged the snow, so
low did ho crouch, lie had not seen me,
and he took tin* utmost pains to escape
observation. He was eying Vixen and
her foal over the low fence of their pen
and was deciding on the tactics best cal
culated to give him colt for supper.
He crept slowly round the clearing un
observed, as he thought, till ho had the
stable between himself and the pen; then
jie left his cover Hut ho had underrated
Vixen’s keenness. Her eye had been upon
him from the first, and the moment ho
disappeared from her view she set up an
excited whinny, which was intended to
summon help from the camp.
The cook board her call. Without wait
ing for more than .a glimpse of the panther
the cook started on the run for the chop
ping where the men were at work. I
knew ho had gone for his gun, the only
one in camp, which Joan Hatisto had
taken with him after dinner.
Seeing no help come from the camp.
Vixen took her colt to the middle of the
pen and stood with it right under her
nose, while she kept a ceaseless watch on
all sides. The colt seemed to realize from
its mother’s alarm that there was danger
astir and huddled itself apprehensively to
gether.
Presently round the corner of the stable
crept the panther, a tawny shadow, flat
on the snow. The moment ho saw through
the openings of the fence that the eye of
the mare was upon him ho bounded to
the to]) of the fence and made one bold
spring for his prey, but the mate was no
less lightning swift than himself. At the
lirst glimpse of him sho had whirled so
that her heels were toward the enemy and
had waited in a crouching attitude that
one might have taken to indicate the ex
trefbe of terror. As the panther sprang
her iron heels met him with a thud that
forced out of him an involuntary snarling
gasp, and ho fell against the pen fence.
In an instant he Hashed over the fence and
lay clown In the snow to recover his
breath.
Instead of making another direct attack
the panther next rose to. the fence, and
thence sprang to the roof of the stable,
where he crouched down and snarled
fiercely.
The colt was still the object of his
heart’s desire. The moment ho mounted
to the roof Vixen had withdrawn to the
farther edge of the pen, and now she stood
hunched together with her head turned
backward, so ng to let no movement of her
foe escape he r eye.
From bis superior height the panther
fancied that he could escape her heels and
reach the marc’s back. As he sprang from
his vantage ground the impetus of Ids at
tack was tremendous and almost irresisti
ble. Vixen almost stood on her head, and
her heels met him fair in the stomach, so
that ho shrieked under the blow, but the
mere momentum of his leap overcame lie
resistance of Vixen’s hoofs to the extent
that ho reached her back and bore the
bravo, nmro to the ground with ids de
scending force. She nimbly recovered her
self, however, and shook him off, and by
this time the cook came running toward
the pen with his gun cocked, expecting to
see tho panther at her throat. But no;
there was little light left in him. He
looked very sick as ho tried to crawl out
of tho pen, and tho cook was on tho point
of finishing him with a charge of buck
shot, bnt*Vixon intervened.
Leaving her colt, sho darted forward and
tore his neck fiercely with her powerful
teeth. The beast rolled over on Ids back,
screaming madly, and as Vixen trampled
him down with her front hoofs ho doubled
and sank his claws into her neck and
shoulders.
There for a moment ho snarled and
clawed, while tin) brave mare’s neck
streamed with blood, and the cook sought
a chance for a shot. But Vixen’s piling
ings gave him no opportunity. It was
plain to the cook that the mare would kill
her adversary i?i a minute or two more,
but b dread. 1 L r meanwhile she should
be seriously injured.
With some misgiving as to tho reception
ho might have from Vixen himself,
though he was going to her assistance, he
dropped his gun, drew his long knife and
jumped into the pen. As an opportunity
showed Itself he drove the knife with all
his force straight through tho beast’s
backbone, dividing the spine, and the
lank carcass straightened out on the snow.
The bravo mare stood over her fallen ad
versary and whinnied triumphantly, and
she made It plain to the cook that she ap
preciated his assistance. Then the cook
gut water in his dishpan and washed 1; r
wounds. The dressing of them he left
for her master to see to on his return, but
vit afterward Vise n was as gentle to the
cook as toward her owner, though with
the rest of mankind she would have
naught to do.—Youth’s Companion.

Whilo universally used by tho ancients,
tho form of tho how varied with different
nations. Tho Scythian bow, according to
a writer in Lippi ncott’s, wits in tho form
of the letter C, and tho how of the Tar
tars—descendants of tho Scythians—still
keeps that shape.
The Greek bow was not more than three
or four feet in length, but so stout, and
stiff that it required considerable strength
and skill to use it. It is said that the lirst
Greek bows were made from the horns of
a species of goat, tHo bases being united
by means of a metallic band. Afterward
other material was used in their manufac
ture, but they still retained their original
shape. These bows were too short to boot
much use, and, comparatively speaking,
but a small portion of tho troops were
armed with them.
Tho Romans c arried the bow to Britain,
where it at once obtained favor, and dur
ing the middle ages was extensively used,
forming an important element of tho
armies of that period.
The English archers were said to bo the
finest in the world, and their skill decided
the battles of Crccy, Poitiers and Agin
court. Tho bows used were of two kinds
—tho long bow and tho arbalest or cross
bow. Tho arbalest was made of steel or
horn, and was of such strength and stiff
ness that it was necessary to use some
mechanical appliance to bend It and ad
just tho string. Tho arbalestiers carried
a quiver with 50 arrows and were placed
in the van of tho battle.

were not always as considerate to him.
Professor* Lenhuch, than whom perhaps
nobody except Professor Schweninger
know Bismarck so intimately, once told ,
mo: ‘‘ln all tho years 1 have known ;
Prince Bismarck I only remember him |
speaking harshly on one solitary occasion.
A manservant had shut tho door with a
bang. Bismarck rang tho bell and when
ho appeared told tho man sharply that bo
was to leave at the end of his month. 1
About a quarter of an hour afterward he
rang the bell again, and said in a modiiied
voice, ‘You may stay.’ That was all.”—
Sidney Whitman in Harper’s. .
