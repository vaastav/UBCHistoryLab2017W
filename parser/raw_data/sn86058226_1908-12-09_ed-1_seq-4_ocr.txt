CONCERNING MR. SMITH.
Now that the weather has grown
colder and the heat of the campaign is
over. It does the heart and circulation
bo end of good to read a letter such
as 'was addressed to and called forth
by Mr. William Dudley Foulke. No
more deserved castlgation ever camo
from the pen of the president than the
tetter In which he flayed Delavan
Smith, and the other newspapers who
had to do with the spreading of the in
famous Ho which was dignified Into
the Panama scandal. It seems strange
that the editor of the News should
have been guilty of misrepresentation
he has never been even suspected of
that before. It is too bad that he
took the word of the New York World!
No one has had the confidence la its
word that he has displayed! It is a
mystery how any paper while "dis
claiming any responsibility for its ac
curacy" could have found any basis for
the mud-slinging editorial, the best
way to have "disclaimed any respon
sibility" would havo been to hare left
out the editorial. Or is It the custom
of that paper to base its editorial com
ment on that sort of thing?
i To newspaper men the most eoward
ly part of the proceeding will be the
laying of the blame at the door of the
man who writes Mr. Smith's editorials.
In well managed papers there Is usu
ally some connection between the spo
ken order of the management and the
printed word In the editorial column.
Mr. Smith may indeed have been in
Cleveland, but his policy was evidently
well known and carried out, for it was
consistent with the other editorials of
that paper. And finally, the most
conclusive evidence is the fact that
since that date Mr. Delavan Smith's ef
forts have been to clear himself rather
than to straighten up the matter and
to use every effort in his power to let
In light on the matter.
That scurrillous shovelful of nastl
ness for which the News stood spon
sor dtd not do any harm. It will be
remembered of the last campaign that
the lie Was told in the Coliseum in this
town, by a fiery orator and the audi
ence which had applauded his every
word remained silent when he paused
for applause at the end of the He.
The public has a suspicion of "Who
Is Who in America." It did not need
Mr. Roosevelt's letter to convince It
that Smith is a "conspicuous offend
er." The people of Indiana know the
News. And the News casts a slur on
th understanding of the citizens of this
state when it trys to foist such a He
tm the public. It speaks well for the
tntegrlty of the press all over the coun
try that only a few papers followed the
lead of the World.
About the sire of It is that most peo
ple in these parts will be glad that Del
avan Smith got his.
DELENDA EST CARTHAGO!
The message of the president It ap
pears was not listened to in its read
ing before congress. Most people
know why. If the members of con
gress had been asked they would have
laid it was because they knew what
Ihe president was going to say and in
ihat they would have been right.
The message Is intruth but a re-iter-
itlon of all the other messages of the
president. Differences there are of
rourse but the keynote is the same.
A Square Deal!
The message touches on all the
problems of the day and those prob
lems may vary and change and reap
pear but in the president's mind the
solution is ever the same. It is the
solution of the square deal.
Whether it be corporation abuse,
land grabbing, conservation of nation
al resources, postal changes, the cen
us, reform of the courts, labor, over
grown fortunes, public health, or tie
Philippines, the answer and the
recommendation of the Man in the
White House now. Is a square deal for
all. This Is only another way of sav
ing that we must be honest
It reminds one of a parallel in his
tory. When the Roman Republic bad
still the splendid ideals which have
stood for all ages and which influence
as even today its very life was threat
sned by the dlsing power of Carth
ige under the leadership of the re
doubtable Hannibal. Then there arose
In the Roman senate the figure of the
illustrious Cato. ' "Carthage must be
destroyed. The Roman senate heed
ed him not at all. And no matter
thereafter what the subject of the dis
course might be" those words of Cato's
gradually burned themselves into the
Inner consciousness of the senate.
For every time he made a speech he
ended it always with the same words
"Delenda est Carthago."
And so in this year of our Lord
1908, Roosevelt has ended his mes
sage with the same keynote with
which he began it "Carthage," the
stronghold of corporate pirates, land
grabbers, special interests, feeders out
of the public crib, grafters and bood
lers, and all the company of the foes
which beset the republic must be de
stroyed. It is not enough to repulse
them as they have been time and
again with varying success. "Carth
age" must be destroyed from the very
ground and one stone not left upon
another!
That is the real message of the
president.
No wonder congress did not listen
to it.
HASKELL LAND GRAB
PROBED BY PRESIDENT
Oklahoma Executive Accused
Of Gobbling Lots.
Washington, Dec. 9. President
Roosevelt has decided to send a spec
ial attorney to Oklahoma to investl
gate Governor Haskell's acquisition of
town lots through Indian titles.
In a letter to William J. Bryan dur
ing the recent presidential campaign
the president commended upon these
acquisitions by Oklahoma's governor.
The department of justice, acting up
on Information furnished by the sec
retary of the interior, has been con
ducting an investigation for several
months into the methods by which
white persons obtained titles to valu
able Indian lands.
Assistant Attorney General Russell
has made several trips to Oklahoma
looking up evidence. More than 4,000
suits have been commenced in the
federal courts of Oklahoma by the
United States to set aside convey

Rheumatism Caused
By Dyspepsia
So Claim Many Eminent Doctors Up
on Recent Scientific Investigation.
A large school of physicians which
is constantly increasing, claims that
the eating of too much animal foods
creates an over supply of proteids,
which are composed of carbon, hydro
gen, nitrogen oxygen and sulphur, and
that when such proteids are imper
fectly digested and go into the blood
they create vast quantities of nitro
gen which the oxygen from the lungs
cannot neutralize and hence results,
uric acid and rheumatism and scores
of other diseases.
These proteids do not permit the
assimilation processes to take place
properly and poisoning results all
through the blood.
However, if such proteids are per
fectly digested they form a most val
uable part of our food and are abso
lutely necessary to life.
The fault then rests with the stom
ach and the digestive apparatus.
Hence it is claimed by these latter
day authorities that rheumatism
arises In the stomach or through the
stomach and not in the kidneys as
some medical authorities teach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets cure dys
pepsia, reduce proteids to their natur
al condition best taken up by the sys
tem, give strength to the blood, rest
the stomach and invigorate and renew
the gastric fluids, pancreatic juice and
the digestive organs in generat.
Forty thousand physicians use these
little digesters, and every druggist

TRUST BUSTER MARVELS
AT TESTIMONY OF JOHN D.
Kellogg Declares That the Statemeuts of Rockefeller and Archbold Made on Witness
Stand in Oil Trust Suit Are Absurd.
New York, Dec 0. Frank B. Kel
logg, the Minnesota lawyer, who is
conducting the most important suit the
Standard Oil company has ever bad to
deal with, a suit which, if won by the
government, will bring about a dissolu
tion and reorganization of that great
trust believes that there is a fine lot
of lying being done in the hearings.
"These lapses of memory on the part
of witnesses like Rockefeller and Arch
bold," declared Mr. Ktilogg yesterday,
with fine scorn, "are absurd perfectly
absurd! The idea of any man having
the face to 6ay that he can't recall the
details of a $23,000,000 deal! He must
think the public is a fool."
"What are these men most afraid
of?"
"Oh, I don't know," said Kellogg. "I
can't understand such people. If they
aren't conducting their business im
properly why shouldn't they be willing
to testify like good citizens? I'll tell
SEARCH FOR KIERAN
Police Would Take Into Cus
tody Former President of
Fidelity Company.
TWO RECEIVERS IN CASE.
New York, Dec. 9. The police have
been asked to arrest P. J. Kieran, for
mer president of the Fidelity Funding
company, but they have not located
him. The officers had been advised
that Kieran and his wife would return
from Washingeon, but if they arrived
they were not recognized.
It has developed in connection with
the affairs of the Fidelity Funding
company that rival receivers, state
and federal are now engaged in litiga
tion for possession of the concern's
assets. Thomas F. Gilroy Jr., who is
now acting as temporary state receiv
er, was appointed as such on Oct 27.
About two weeks later, on Nov. 12,
application to the United States dis
trict court here, by several large cred
itors of the company, resulted in the
appointment of Robert C. Morris as
federal receiver. , Mr. Morris attempt
ed to secure the assets and books of
the company but found State Receiver
Gilroy already in possession. Mr. Gil
roy refused to turn the property over,
and on an order to show cause raised
the point that the Fidelity Funding
company was not engaged in a trading
business and therefore could not be
adjudicated in bankruptcy in federal
proceedings.
The federal receiver, resisting this
contention, a referee was appointed to
hear arguments. No hearings have
been held, but it is understood that
the referee, Peter B. Olney, will take
up the case shortly.

HAS FEELINGS HURT
Sues Congressman for $20,
000 on Libel Charge.
Boston, Dec. 9. Action for alleged
slander, in which $20,000 damages are
claimed, has been brought by Con
gressman Richmond P. Hobson, of
Alabama, against Congressman John
A. Keliher, of Massachusetts. The al
leged remarks which caused the ac
tion to be brought were made during
the recent campaign immediately fol
lowing a visit to this city of Captain
Hobson, who spoke in the interest of
Joseph A. Conroy for congress, the
latter contesting unsuccessfully with
Congressman Keliher for the nomin
ation. Both Congressmen are demo
crats. MOVES TO RICHMOND.

you what it is," he declared, "these
men have been so long accustomed to
power and to doing exactly as they
please in everything that they are
amazed and enraged at the very idea
of being forced to tell what it does not
please them to tell. They are auto
cratic and defiant through habit and
temperament.
"What do they want all this money
for, anyway?" pursued Kellogg, half
laughing. "I can't imagine myself
wanting a huge useless fortune. I'd
much rather remain a plain lawyer.
"It's all wrong, too, tils idea that
has got about of late years, that a
young man must sacrifice his Ideals to
succeed In any line of business. If a
man has brains he doesn't need to re
sort to tricks In order to 'get there,'
and if he does resort to tricks he'll
trip up some day when he least expects
to. Business is founded on honesty
after all, you know."
THE TROOPS TO STAY
Americans Will Occupy Cuba
Long After New Presi
dent Takes Place.
POLICY HAS BEEN CHANGED
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9. A
change has taken place in the pro
gram of the administration for the
withdrawal of the American troops
from Cuba. Instead of the movement
terminating January 28, when the new
president is to be inaugurated, as
heretofore announced by Secretary
Wright, the withdrawal will be more
gradual, and, according to the present
program, will run into April.
The change in the policy of the ad
ministration was announced after the
cabinet meeting. According to this
program, American troops will be
available for service in the islands
during the transition from the provis
ional to the regular government and
for a reasonable time subsequent
thereto, so that if disorders arise they
will be on hand for duty.
This change, it is said, is entirely
agreeable to the Cuban authorities,
who are coming into office.
One transport will be used in bring
ing the troops back to the United
States and they will be landed at such
ports as may be most convenient for
them to reach the stations to which
they may be assigned. The first of
the troops will sail from the island
January 1.

It is estimated that the total pro

is about 2,000,000 tons per annum.
Ot this quantity nine-tenths are af

tons of which are required to produce
the above quantity of cane sugar. The
average of saccharine matter in the
ripe West Indian sugar cane, is
from 18 to 21 per cent., of which only
8 per cent, is available to commerce.
The total value of the sugar in the
