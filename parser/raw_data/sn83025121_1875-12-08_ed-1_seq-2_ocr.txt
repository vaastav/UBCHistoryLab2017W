Thf. AHvprtiser, in its cnRtomary obtnsc
I tray of putting tliinfru, attriliates "the peneral
I dnllness " to the fact, among otlior thingn,
i that nolindy knows what are the views of
1 trnx faliinet Ministers on the important ques-
tions that are sore ! come up in the approach
I ing session of the legislature." Now it
i strikes ns that it is a matter of very little eon
! com to them, who rereaiit3 this, that or any
I other ilistriot of the kingdom, provided the
i electors are s;.trt.-.i with their nhoiee. For
i instance, there are in Hil i at least twenty can
didates fur the place, every one of them na
j tives. What matters it, whether Pa and Po,
I or whether Pauln and Luka seenre seats in
1 the national assemhly? Pa and Pt are douht-
less quite as able men as their opponents i'au
i lo and l.uka, and will be just as ready to vote
i for a five million loan, as they art now to de
nounce it. And su throngh the entire list of
representative districts. For the Ministers to
stand up and issue an address, under the cir
cumstances, would place thru, in a ridiculous
position, and could only furnish an occasion for
croakers, like the Advertiser, to blow their
It and thns mid to the " general dullness."
Thk first session of the fiftieth American
Confrpess opened at Washington on Monday
last. The bouse, of representatives probably
orgaiiized by choosiug a Democratic Spoaker,
that party having a majority of about seventy
of the 28h members. Among the prominent
candidates are Kerr of Indiana, Randall of
Pennsylvania, and S. S. Cox and Fernando
Wood of New York. The first and last named
are supposed to have the best chances, as they
arc well-known to lie hard money Democrats.
Of course all the officers of the house will also
be Democratic. On the other hand, the Senate
remaits Bepttblican by a large majority; so
that, unless the party leaders are discreet in
framing laws to be passed, there may lie rup
ture between the two branches of Congress.
It is not often that such a division of power oc
curs in t.ingi'cM, by which each party controls
one house, and it calls for great political dis
creetiioss to conduct the public business har-moniouslv.

Hawaiians are morethan usually interested
in the present Congress, inasmuch as it will
be called to act upon the treaty passed last
winter. The bill authorizing this treaty to go
into force, ought to be among the first busi
ness laid liefore the house, after its organiza
tion and the appointment of commitees. But
as nearly or quite one half of the house con
sists of newly-elected members, who arc not
familiar with the object and advantages of the
treaty, it must take time to enable them to
understand the subject. Many of the new
members, imbued only with the local opinions
held in their rural districts, will go to Wash
inton opposed to reciprocity, aud especially
opposed to the relinquishing of the amount of
revenue involved. But when they come to
view the matter from the more elevated stand-
jioint which they will have in the capitol of
the nation, and weigh, in a national light, the
benefits to be derived under it by American
commerce and interests in the Pacific, the case
will be changed, and they may yield to the
better judgment of those who have studied the
question in all its bearings. One thing is
certain what benefits llawaii under the treaty
will benefit America also, as it will increase
the trade between the two countries, and add
to the commercial prosperity of both. It is to
be hoped that Congress will act in this matter
at an early dav, but there is no certaintv that
.the treaty will take effect if approved, for sev
eral moutus to come.
expedition and the death of the gallant old
Commander H"cre found. He made his way
through Lancaster Sound, Barrow's Straits,
and other waters, until a barrier of solid ice at
Roqnette Island completely blocked their pas
sage further.
The record of the little Pandora, of the
dangers which she encountered and the manner
in which ahe escaped them, reads almost like
fiction. Although she was constantly among
the ice floes and exposed to danger, ahe met
with no mishaps, made her passage with re
markable swiftness, and returned m safety to
England. The object of her commander was
not to reach the highest possible northern lati
tude, but to make the Xorthwest Passage, and
this object he would probably have accom
plished had he not found his further progress
effectnallv stopped by a solid wall of ice across
Bel lot Strait, at the very point where McClin
tock, his old comniander, was stopped at the
time he discovered the Franklin relics. He
took the same route as MeOIintock, crossing
Melville Bay in safety after leaving Cpcma
vik. Thence he entered Lancaster Sound,
"visited Becchy Island, where Ross' ill-fated
esscl was lost twenty-five years ago, thence
sailed through Peel Sonnd, and kept on to
Bellot Strait, where he found the impassable
! icy barrier winch induced una to return to
England rather than winter there. Although
I foiled in his attempt to make the Northwest
; Passage, he penetrated to the south along the
coast of Prince of Wales' Land further than
I McCIintrck had done, and even reached King
William's Laud, where no vijssel ttK Frank
lin's has ever lcu before.
The indirect results of the expedition are
even more interesting than the direct, since
the Captain of the Pandora was successful in
finding letters at a spot previonsly decided
uHin from the other two Euglish vessels, the
Alert and Discovery, which are in quest of
tlie open Polar Sea. The news from them is
highly encouraging. The two vessels arrived
ai the Carer Islands, July 37. and then lefi
for Smith's Sound. They left I'peusk July 22
and Cape York July 25. The best news from
them is that the season was an open one, and
that all were well, so that if nothing adverse
has overtaken them they are now far on their
way to the North Pole. The great Polar mys
tery, therefore, may yet be solved by these
daring English navigators. It is an eloquent
tribute to the ambition and courage of the time
that, while the explorers of one nation are
steadily and persevcringly pushing their way j
through the eternal snows and ice of the Arc-
tic region to root out the mystery of the Pole,
undismayed by the fate of those who have pre
ceded them, an explorer of another nation is
just as steadidly and pcrseveringly braving
the dangers of the African jungles, the mala
rious disease, and unknown savage tribes un
der the equator, to solve the mystery of the
sources of the Xile.
European Corretpondence - So. 4.

IccEnaC. October, 1875.
Data GaiaTn : The little Brighton donkeys are
a funny aa those of ITmmpstead, and eo tame and
imall that it would reea as though the trm " stub
horn " could never be applied to them. I malt sat
that my first distinct impression of tba far-famed
Brighton it aaaoctated with one of there animals,
which patsed ai on the street, saddled, but rUr!cs
and unattended, trotting off to his stand tomewhere
on the heaeh.
They are o imall ! they are pigmy donkeyi, and I
want to stop and look at erery one I tea. My feel
ing concerning them ratemble thoee of the regular,
typical Yankee I met on the overland route in the
States. After three minute eonrerration, in which
he learned considerable about me in spite of myself,
he stated his "platform." "Xaow," said he, "when
I see a stranger, I always want to find oat, first, who
be is ; second, where be comes from ; third, where he's
goi'."
No doubt the donkey would reitt the annoyance of
simitar investigations more summarily than I did,
but he could not feel mora indignant. However, my
Yankee proved himself more entertaining later in the
day, and actually confessed to beiog snubbed some
times by people who did not ehonee to enlighten him
on his three main points (and a good many others
besides.)
We made a day's exeorsion to Brighton, tearing
the London ttation at the early hoar of 9:50, a. w.
That was hard beginning, sinee it required ns to
breakfast at S:.0 instead uf 9. bat as we eould not al
ter train time, we had to make the best of it, and were
really eight minutes early at the station ! European
travel requires one to be prompt at trains, eo much
personal taperfision of baggage is necessary about
the station, and at every change, to the annoyance
anil danger of ltmba and skirts, not to say temper.
There is no checking system for baggage ib Eng
land. It is strange that so convenient, and simple
an arrangement Is not introduced.
Much handling and many feet are required, and
that, too, by the railway porters hired by the compa
ny. Perhaps the existence of the fee system accounts
for the non-existence of the check system ! The pres
ent way of managing baggage seems possible only in
an honest country. Beally who is to know whether
a traveler is claiming bit own valise or another per
son's without any voucher at to the hone trot bis de
mand? Thefts of this kind are rare however, even
w.th all the confusion and exposure of baggage on the
platforms at railway station!.
But we had no baggage this morning, and a com
fortable ride of about 52 miles brought us to Brighton,
where we went directly to the beach, and onto the
principal pier. The scene was more novel tome than
museums, and very interesting. It happened to be
a day for a lugger lace, and a yacht race, and I had
an opportunity to see all sorts of sailing craft on the
sands, snd on the sea, not a quarter of which I could
name. From my first appreacu to English shores I
had been ourious to know what gave the dark red
brown color to the sails of so many common small
craft, luggers among them. It certainly makes It pic
turesque to my eye, adding variety of color to bright
sea and coast scenes. Sometimos the canvas is even
a deep orange color ; and if I were a tailmaker I
should be tempted to try the effect of alternate stripes
of the brown and the orange.
In sloops Oil the beach stood Den playing coronets,
or otherwise attracting the notice of parsers to the
fact that the " Lady Mary," or the "Prince " some
body would take anyone for a sail at one o'clock for
a shilling. Small boats with awnings were pushing
off with gay parties, the donlteys were waiting for ri
ders, the oyster dealers stood to ery their wares, and
the cbildreu were digging in the sand with cunning
wooden spades. The sand, tl suppose It really is

blue, the day was perfect, and so fascinating was the
clear, white-capped water, and the bright scene of
shifting color, aod variety of motion and sound at its
edge, that the attractions of the aquarium seemed

Thk incoming mail from San Francisco will
doubtless bring the President's message in full,
published in the dailies of the day on which
the steamer sails. Regarding it, a Washing
ton special says :
"It la now certain that three topics, at least, will
be largely dwelt uon by the President in bis com
in:: message to Congress. These three topics will
embrace the public school qncetion. Ihe finance,
and tba condition of Affairs iu Cuba. Senator Mor
ton, who bas been in the city for the last week or
to. Is responsible iu a large degree for the Presi
dent's assuming . position upon the school question
in tbe coming message. He bas been persuading
the President Ibat be wast assume tbe position of
Gladstone iu Enghind and Bismarck in Germany and
come oat ag&lnat tbe growing demand4 of Catholi
cism.. There is but one thing to be said about the
President's Cuban policy, and this can be said by
the highest authority, lie will not talk of war or
the possibility o! war in bis message, but will urge
strongly tbe justice ofrecogutziug tbe rights of the
belligerent Cubans. He has made up bis mind that
be will carry his point in tins regard witb the aid of
Congress il he can, and if not without its aid. In
the absence ol Congres4 the Constitution gives tim
the power to act. He fhoposes, however, to give
Congress one more opportunity to take tbe respon
sibility upon its shoulders. Upon financial subjects
tbe President will endeavor to show by the lato
elections, that tbe Republican party ia tbe only par
ty that believes in a sound currency, and therefore.
tbe only one with which it is safe to trust tbe affairs
ot tbe country. On three points the auti-Catholic,

tbe strongest man in his party. Tbe talk ol tnird

whose positions make tbeir opinions worthy of at

Grant Is the man who can save tbe party.
Notwithstanding the above statement,
we do not believe that the Republican party
will risk its unity a id harmony, by Becking to
put forward Gen. Grant for a third term ser
vice, which is repugnant to the good sense of
the better portion of that party. His nomina
tion for a third term however prosperous lias
been his administration, and however popular
he may be himself could only result in defeat,
because the majority of Americans, when it
comes to a decision of this issue, will be found
opposed to it. There are just as good men as

We hare started for Lucerne by about tueh a tour
as we took to reach London from Liverpool. We stop
at several towns and visit cathedrals and perhaps
other points of interest, depending on our time aad
tbe weather. 1 aa amused aod ioterested to see the
old dream like ttoriet of travel sad picture bookt
come true in my journey, the unearpeted floort
scoured white and sanded, the feather bed to sleep
under, the fuuny wooden shoes on tbe streets, that
would do to sail in across the Atlantic, the dyked rir
ere and reclaimed lands. But for much of this latter
we are rather far south.
We did not remain long at Antwerp, only a little
glimpse of Ihe wonderful cathedral tbe mass of which
we bad watched from afar on the boat ; aad thea we
took traia for Mechlin.
There is the place to see the splendid laces of that
name, and to tit on any of the pretty bridges over tbe
Dyle. and watch the gray green water, the common
people with Ihe ourious wooden tavkot always claek
clacking on the rooghly pared streets, and slipping
off behind, the dogs dragging cut., and the scores of
odd things one docs not see at home.
In the cathedral is a fine picture of the Cruotfixion.
br Van Dvck, and tbe handsome square, not far dis
tant, contaess a tlatue of Margaret of Austria.
Kverywaere in these towns, as iu the country towns
of Knglaud, we eome upon the market squares, full
of tempting fruits aod vegetables, aud we often make
an addition to our lunch from tbe golden or purple
stores of pears, plums and grapes.
We were in tight, during the day, of tbe field ol
Waterloo, which possesses mure attractions to the
English than other nations, I fancy. One Englishman
on the Cbaanel boat teemed rather surprised that we
should come so near that famous batt.e ground, and
not pay it a visit.
But our route was to land as that night in Liege,
when we arrived from Mechlin alter dark, and our
immediate concern was not a search for old buildings
and pretty views, but for a modern hotel, and a eom
fortable supper.
Here I found my first feather corerlet, for which
there was no need till a colder night. They are capi
tal inreotious for winter, though, contrivanees which
I have improvised f r myself bai'ere now in culd
nlghu at places where feather beds are not used in
that fashion aa aa institution. These little corerlets
are light and thin, not like a real feather bed, and lie
outside of tbe blankets.
The morning tbowed Liege to be a pretty town with
broad streete, boulerards containing fuur rows of
handsome trees, gardens, river walks on the baoka of
the Meuse, statues, and lorely prospects of aod from
tbe hills on either tide. I am afraid I hare forgotten
what I saw in doors that morning, tbe out of doors
was so bright and attractive. We tu ice passed a fice
statue of Charlemagne, adorned on the pedestal by
reliefs of a couple of Pepins, and other ancient wor
thies. We were in tbe country of Charlemagne and bis
ancestors, and when we stepped off in the afternoon
for a short visit to Aix-la-Chapclle, we had reached
his favorite city, his reputed birth-place, and the place
where be died and was buried iu 814. In tho cathe
dral is his tomb, designated by a marble slab in the
floor, with the inscription "Carolo Magno." Tbe
tomb was opened in lOOOby Ctbo III, and the body of
the great Emperor was found seated on a marble
throne which is preferred in the public gallery. The
antique sarcophagus of Parian marble, in which the
remains of Charlemagne reposed fur 165 years after
the first opening of his tomb, has also beeo placed
there.
All of the remains of the famous monarch now ex
isting in tbe cathedral, are his skull and a leg bone.
which are exhibited for a fee among other treasures.
A brateu wolfs bead at tbe right uf tbe entrance to
the cathedral attracted my notice. It is a memorial
and the legend runs thus : " The funds having run
short during the erection of the church, the devil of.
fered to supply the deficicaey on condition that the
first soul that entered the completed church should be
sacrificed to bim. The magistrates entered the eoin
pact. but defrauded tbe devil of bis due by admittiog
a wolf into tbe sacred edifice for the first liring soul,
immediately on itt completion."
We had a ft nay complication reaching tbe city, be
tween our witb to change our baggage from one tta
tion to another, and our plan to tee a little of Aix,
meanwhile on foot. There wat our baggage un
checked, of course, to be conreyed, there were wa
waiting, and there were the two chefs of station and
a porter, at distracted as tho' the world were coming
to an end, shonting High and f. w German and bro
ken English all in one, and gesticulating as tho' they
were coming to blows. Could we leare our baggage
to porter or truck ? No, we must not be separated
from it, no traveliog system proriding for sneb an
emergency, and no plan could be hit upon but to take
a cab and tbe effects, and see the city under the dri
ver's guidance. u. T. c.

After the races we left the pier atd promenade, the
prett.r little goat carriages and the invalid chairs
drawn bj band, and went to the aquarium for the
rest of the day. It is a place of wonders. Thetanks
with glass fronts, containing the fish are built under
ground on both tides of a long passage, and are
lighted from above. Tbe water bants into each tank
from the bottom like a bubbling fountain, and flows
upward constantly, producing, witb tbe pretty, grotto
like arrangement of the rocks at the back and sides,
and the bright illumination from abore, a charming
effect, as the risitor stands below and looks up
through the unquiet waters to tbe sunlight abore.
The ascending stream of fountain current, the de
scending stream of quivering sunlight, its brilliancy
gradually decreasing to dim light in rocky caret, and
the flashing of the gild and silrer and rote tints of
tbe fish among tbe mosses and orer tbe sands, gire
tbe ideal pictorc of a mermaid's home.
There seem to be no large animals jn the building.
The largest was an cnormoui turtle belonging to Queen
Victoria, and there were some seals. But there was
a great variety of small fish. The sea anemones are
most beautiful creatures, and there were great num
bers of them. They seemed to have multiplied like
the wild flowers whose name they borrow, and were
to be found growing upon the rocks in many tanks
which were not named as their habitats. Id tanks
with them were tercral rtirieties of the tube worm,
their riolet filaments swaying in tbe currents.
A curious aod hideous animal called the octopus at
tracted a great deal of attention. . When it stretched
itself, and uncurled its long legs for swimming it was
brown on the back and white underneath. When it
found its resting place it swelled its body to a balloon
shape, drew in the tentacular, seemed to turn almost
wrong side out, exhibiting roseate colors underneath,
and Anally bnddled itself up to an ugly, brown
rounded mats in the sand, or fastened itself by its
suckers again! t the glass face of the tank. One tank
contained an animal of the same tort, bat of a golden
color, flushed with orange above in the tettling stage,
and of changeful riolets and picks in the underlinings
more beautiful than ttanslaceot opal. They are pretty
only in motion. There was a case of enormous con
ger eels that looked aa though they were coming right
at the spectators through tbe glass, and ibere were
curious flat fish with their heads all one tided, elec
tric fish, graceful plumed fuh from Mexico, deep
black or snowy white, and so many other interesting
objects that again one wished for months rather than
days for sight-seeing. I must not stop to tell yon of
the concert, the reading-room, the fern grottoes with
their palopolai and pulu ferns it is time to feed tbe
fish, and we must hurry for that, and tbeu go to tbe
train 1
The seals hare had their meat, the eels their bread,
the fish their worms, and now for Loudon again, and
i then hurrah for the Continent I

Return ot the Pandora.
On our fourth page will be found an abstract
of the three month cruise of the.Pandora,
which waa fitted out in part by the late Lady
Franklin, and which has returned to England.
Capt. Young succeeded in reaching the scene
of Sir John Franklin's adventures: and re
turned in surety, after having made his way to
the very waters where Sir John's ships were
iced in and destroyed, and along the shores of
King William's Land, where some relics of the
waters of this unknown sea from Kagehyi on
the South, 1,000 miles, or nearly two-thirds
of the way round it, to a large island off its
northwestern shore. From this point, he for
some reason which does not yet appear, seems
to have retraced his course to Kagehyi, leaving
about one-third of the shore on the southwest
unexplored.
Stanley's second object is a thorough explo
ration of the other known fountain of the Nile,
the Albert Xyanza, lying northwest of the
Victoria Xyanza, and connected with it by the
Victoria Nile. The Albert Xyanza was dis
covered ty Sir Samuel Baker, but he explored
it only about 100 miles south from its outlet
into the Nile. The tribes occupyiDg the
country between the two great lakes have
already been pacified, and have such a hearty
fear of the whites that it is not anticipated
Stanley will have any difficulty in crossing it.
His success in exploring the Victoria Nyanza,
which is much larger than the Albert Nyan
za, is a good omen for success in exploring the
latter. If no misfortune shall overtake him,
this exploration will solve the question !of a
connection between the Albert Nyanza and
Lake Tanganyika on the south, which was the
grand theatre of Dr. Livingstone's operations.
Tbe third and last object cf Stanley is to
pluck the mystery of this Tanganyika basin,
which undoubtedly Livingstone would have
solved had not death overtaken him. In pur
suing his way westward from the Tanganyika,
Dr. Livingstone found that the great system of
lakes, rivers, creeks, and sprioga, north of the
Lakiga Mountains, which undoubtedly con
stitute the water-shed of the Nile, drained into
the Lualaba and Lomame Rivers, and that
these rivers iu turn flowed into a great river
suddenly cut off in an unknown and unexplored
region. Dr. Livingstone firmly believed that
this whole interior basin, with its com
plicated web of lakes and rivers, belonged to
the Nile, and to solve this mystery is Stanley's
paramount ambition. If he can definitely es- ' route among to maoy from London to the Continent

has already revolutionized the previous dis
coveries of Speke, Grant, Livingstone, and
other explorers.
In this great wort, the gallant journalistic
explorer will have the good wishes of the
whole world. He has proved himself to be a
skillful, patient, persevering, plucky, explorer ;
and, when he has succeeded in rooting out
the mysteries of the Nile fomitains under the
broiling equator, we suggest that the Herald
next give him a chance in the Arctic regions,
and see if he cannot read the secrets of the
Pole. Chicago Tribune.

we were there later, to we anally got away for Ant
werp, Cologne and tbe Rhine.
The horrors of the dreadful Channel voyage existed
only in tbe imagination for na, though not for all our
fellow passengers. We chose aa hoar for departure
that would gire us the night for the tea, aad we found
no trouble. The passengers were all English and
Germans but ourselves and one American family who
were not the pleatantest representative! ofthe nation
I hare met. Young America was quite too apparent
in the pert daughter, aad the outragocax son.
We steamed up in the morning oo tb tide to Ant
werp, and took our time to get to the wharf, at last,
a large steamer lying in our place took bar time to
get out of it while we waited. Ererything is. done in
such a lesinruly way in these countries as would drire
