NEW YORK, Dec. 2. Reflect in the
unusual and diverse events which in
fluenced its course, the session of the
"lock exchange today was dull with
many confusing and irregular changes
of prices.
Adoption by the government of
stringent regulations to prevent a coal
famine, another collapse in foreign ex
change, the sudden death of H. C.
I'rlck, and the president's message to
congress, augmented the uncertainties
which previously had obscured the
linancial horizon.
As a market factor, the president's
communication took precedence. Dis
appointment was expressed in many
quarters at the absence of specific
reference to remedial railroad legisla
tion. This was partly offset by recom
mendations for the protection of vari
ant home industries.
Latest aspects of the Mexican situa
tion, which were distinctly beneficial
Ui the oil shares and the S per cent call
money rate, which held throughout the
seesion, were almost the only develop
ments which Tavorrd trading and
these lost some of their force in the
later dealings. The close was steady
to firm. Pales amounted to S'G.OOO
hares.
In the bond market, where dealings
in Liberty issues were again large on a
declining tendency, the noteworthy
leature was the strength of local trac
tions. International bonds reflected
only moderately the further demoral
ised movement in exchange. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $28,750.
(il)i). Old U. S. bonds were unchanged
on call.

H. S. has ever produced. They even
walked away, with the state champion
ship. This year the same team is out,
with the exception of last year's cap
tain, Coughiin. Then there is the new
material out which at the present time
looks pretty good. There is just one
drawback, and that is the team has
no floor to play on. As large a school
as Phoenix High should have some
kind of a floor. There were 700 or
800 season tickets sold with the prom
ise to the students that the tickets
would admii them to not only all
football and baseball games, but also
all basket ball games. Suppose only
half that number went to the Y. M.
C. A. and watch the team play soms
visiting team.
The Blue Triangle CJirls will give
Fashion Show" Thursday after
noon at 4 o clock in the High school
auditorium. The object of the per
formance will be to illustrate what the
girls have been doing by studying the
subject, "Health and Beauty. The
Parent-Teacher association and the
Tempe Girls' "1"" club will be present.
All of the High school girls, both
members and otherwise, are invited to
attend.
According to Mr. Holsinger, in
structor in the typing classes, Nan
Blackburn, the new P. H. S. typing
champion, will with a little practice
he a wonder at the "game. . In the
tournament staged she wrote 58
words per minute. Mr. Holsinger says
that the excitement of a contest af
fects her in a different way than it
does most people. The excitement of
the test tends to urge her on to faster
work instead of making her nervous
and causing her to make many mis
takes, as it does in most cases.
Every bootball player will jump Into
his old togs tonight and sort of primp
up, because the squad is going to , be
lined up directly after school and be
shot. This is supposed to be in the
form of an order issued by that re
nouned personage, Manager Eisele.
All girls who wish to take advan
tage of the punch cards for paying
membership fees to the Blue Triangle
club on the "installment plan," should

GAS WELLS BREAK FETTERS
When the income tax collector comes
around it is well to have one's fortune
trained to lie down and play dead, but
no one is likely to refuse great wealth
merely because it makes a loud noise.
So think the owners of a great gas
well near White Point, Tex., which,
when uncapped, shoots its volatile
riches hundreds of feet into the air with
a deafening roar that may be heard
for miles. More than 25,000,000 feet of
gas possibly double that amount
flows each day from this well, said
to be the greatest in the world.
Drilled in a high pressure area, its
operators are happy that it has not
developed the ravenous appetite of
some of its neighbors, which, when
unloosed, have swallowed derrick, en
gine and all. Some such wells were
unbridled at Humble. The guarding
layers of rock pierced by the heavy
drills, the great gas tank, which for
centuries had been weighted down
by them, threw off its fetters with
one mighty lunge, and, widening the
small drill hole by many feet, rushed
roaring into the free air. Efforts to
control the terrific force were of no
avail.
A similar experience occurred at
Goose Creek, where derricks were en
gulfed, and a village completely de
populated, the Wall Street Magazine
reports. The same publication has
this to say of the value of natural gas:
In addition to furnishing fuel for
lighting, heating and industrial pur
poses, petroleum gas supplies two
valuable products gasoline and car
bon black. Gasoline is obtained by
passing the gas into oil, which ab
sorbs the gasoline. The gasoline is
distilled from the oil and the latter is
used again. It is estimated that each
million cubic feet of gas from the
White Point well will yield about"
300 gallons of gasoline. After the
gasoline has been extracted, the gas is
burned in a slow blaze without suf
ficient oxygen and carbon black is '
deposited on plates.
SHOULD SEE CONGRESS FIRST
(Punch, London.)
"There are scientific questions.''"
said Sir Oliver Lodge recently, "that '
will never be answered." One of these,
was recently propounded by the Basuto .
chief, who, after listening to the house
of commons for an hour, asked what
it was for.

"Production From the Start"
N
YOUR LAST CHANCE
This is your last opportunity to get any part of the special issue of the stock of the "VIRGINIA CO." This is the last Ad that will appear
in this paper, offering any part of the preferred stock of one of the big oil companies of the State of Texas. Remember that the company's gur
antee of an immediate payment of 25 and one-half of the production unt il you will have been paid 100 is not only backed by the honor and in
tegrity of its officers and directors, but on the production proceeds of 68, 000 acres of valuable oil leases in 39 Texas counties and its entire capital
stock of six million dollars, and all other assets, present and future.
IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE VIRGINIA COMPANY in
vestors are afforded one of the most exceptional opportunitie lor
profitable investment which have yet arisen out of the great oil de
velopment activity of the Greater Texas Fields. The element of risk
is reduced to an almost irreducible minimum.
THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS to be
realized from subscriptions to stock will be used immediately in pur
chasing production in addition to what we now have.
AS A BONUS to early subscribers, THE VIRGINIA COMPANY
guarantees to pay a cash dividend of TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT on
the first $200,000 subscribed. FIVE PER CENT of this cash dividend
will be paid on January 10, 1920, and the same amount on the first of
each succeeding month until the full sum has been paid. This is
positively guaranteed.
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL. THE VIRGINIA COMPANY, by spe
cial order, has set aside one-half of its present production as well as
one-half of the net production to be acquired in furture for the pay
ment of dividends to these early subscribers until their full amount
subscribed has been completely returned to them.
BUT THE END IS NOT YET. You are probably yourself,
"well, if I invest with THE VIRGINIA COMPANY, is this special
bonus all I get? Will my stock not go right on when the bonus is
paid to me?"
HERE IS THE ANSWER. When you are among the subscribers
of the FIRST TWO HUNDRERD THOUSAND and your cash dividend
of 25 per cent has been paid, and you have been paid back the full
amount of your investment, your stock ownership to the amount of
your subscription goes right on just the same. Once a stockholder
always a stockholder that is, as long as you choose to hold your stock.
THE VIRGINIA COMPANY is the outgrowth of the Breckenridge
Royalty Syndicate, ona of the most successful organizations growing
out of the oil business of Texas. On July 25, 1919, Mr. E. B. Whitting
ton, Secretary of the Syndicate, took a two weeks' leave of absence
from the Crouch Hardware Company of Fort Worth and, together with
Gaines B. Turner, Fort Worth attorney, went to Longview, Texas.
They at once oonferred with Mr. T. C Morgan of that place, a prac
tical banker, who established the First National Bank of Longview
and developed it into the strongest banking institution of that section,
and B. A. Skipper, a well known Longview real estate dealer. In less
than six days they organized the Breckenridge Royalty Syndicate. The
entire dapital stock of $100,000 was subscribed and paid in, except
$12,000. WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE TREASURY STOCK OF
THE SYNDICATE WAS OFFERED FOR SALE SIXTY DAYS LATER
IT WAS TAKEN UP IN LESS THAN TWO DAYS AT TWO FOR
ONE. None of this stock is now for sale.
BY A THOROUGH AND ECONOMICAL ADMINISTRATION of
its business affairs the Syndicate has been able to pay, in less than
six months, 35 per cent in cash and a stock dividend of 15 per cent of
the Guaranty Abstract Company of Breckenridge, and 15 per cent in
the stock of THE VIRGINIA COMPANY.
THE OFFICERS OF THE BRECKENRIDGE ROYALTY SYNDI
CATE will be associated with THE VIRGINIA COMPANY. They will
be aided by other men of affairs who have distinguished themselves in
big business enterprises. Judge Guy A. Meeker, active vice president
and a director of the Northwestern Security Company of Minneapolis,
will be one of our directors. Mr. J. P. Brunton, a practical geologist
and oil operator for the last 28 years will be a member of the Board
and will have charge of the production department. Another worth
director will be Mr. J. H. O'Brien of Mineral Wells, a capitalist and
practical oil man of long experience.
We already have practically 68,000 acres of leaseholds in the coun
ties of Stephens, Eastland, Comanche, Brown, Throckmorton, Shackel
ford, Young, Haskell, Baylor, Archer, Wise, Jack, Montague, Wichita,
Harrison, Gregg, Rusk, Smith, Martin, Howard, Mitchell, Brewster,
Reeves, Ward, Glasscock, Erath, Bosque, Tarrant and Hidalgo.
WHEN THE COMPANY IS INCORPORATED FOR SIX MILLION
DOLLARS, the corporation will take over the assets of THE VIR
GINIA COMPANY with this same agreement." We are getting leases
very much faster than we figured on and it now looks like we will be
able to have our company incorporated for at least $6,000,000, at $1.00
par value, before the first day of January next. Only those who sign
and return the application below will be entitled to the dividend above
set forth. Fill out and return it to us at once.
