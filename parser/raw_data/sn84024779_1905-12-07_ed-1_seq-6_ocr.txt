The following is a synopsis of the
president's message:
"The people of this country continue
to enjoy great prosperity," says the
president In his opening paragraph:
He then proceeds to give various con
ditions and circumstances which make
for or against general prosperity and
leads up to Uie question' of corpora
tions, of which he says: "The for
tunes amassed through corporate or
ganization are now BO large, and vest
such power in those that wield them,
as to make it a matter of necessity to
give to the sovereign—that is to the
government, which represents the peo
plea a a whole—some effective power
of supervision over their corporate
nse. In order to Insure a healthy so
cial and industrial life, every big cor
poration should be held responsible
by, and accountable to, some sovereign
strong enough to control its conduct.
1 am in no'sense hostile to corpora
tions. This is an age of combination,
and every effort to prevent all combi
nation will be not only useless, but
in the end vicious, because of the con
tempt for law which the failure to en
force law inevitably produces. The
corporation has come to stay, just, as
the trade union has come to stay.
Each can- do and has done great good.
Bach should be favored as long as it
does good. But each should be sharp
ly checked where it acts against law
and justice."
The president points out the useless
ness of any attempt to secure regula
tion and control of corporations by
state action. Such regulation and su
pervision can only be effectively exer
cised by the national government, and
the president believes proper power
can be secured by enactment of laws
by congress if the Constitution will
not permit this action, then the Con
stitution should be amended conferring
upon congress full power to enact ad
equate legislation, he continues:
"What 1b needed is not sweeuing
prohibition of every arrangement,
good or oad, which may tend to re
strict competition, but such adequate
supervision and regulation as will pre
vent any restriction of competition
from being to the detriment of tne
public—as *ell as prevent other
abuses in no way connected with re
striction of competition. Until tlie
national government obtains proper
control over big corporations engaged
in interstate commerce it will he im
possible to deal adequately with* the
evils.
Control of 'Railroad Rates.
"The immediate and most pressing
need, so far as legislation is concern
ed, is the enactment into law of some
scheme to secure to the agents of ilie
government, such supervision and reg
ulation of the rates charged by Uie
railroads of the country engaged In
interstate traffic as shall summarily
and effectively prevent the imposition
of unjust or unreasonable rates. It
must include putting a complete stop
to rebates in every shape and form.
This power to regulate rates, like i.'l
similar powers over the business
world, should be exercised witn mod
eration, caution and self-restraint but
it should exist, so that it can be ef
fectively exercised when the need
arises.
"The first consideration to be kept
in mind is that the power should be
affirmative and should be given to
some administration body created by
congress. I do not believe in the gov
ernment interfering with private busi
ness more than is necessary. I do not
believe in the government undertaking
any work which can with propriety be
left in private hands. But neither do
I believe in the government flinching
from overseeing any work when it
becomes evident that, abuses are sure
to obtain therein unless there is gov
ernmental supervision.' In my judg
ment the most important provision
which the law should contain is that,
conferring upon some competent ad
ministration body the power to decide,
upon the case being brought, before it*
whether a given rate prescribed by a
railroad is reasonable and just, and if
it is found to be unreasonable and
unjust, then, after full investigation of
the complaint, to prescribe the limit of
rate beyond which It shall not be law
ful to go—tne maximum reasonable
rate, as it is commonly called—this de
cision to go into effect within a rea
sonable time and to obtain from
thence onward, subject to review by
the courts. It sometimes happens at
present, not that a rate is too high but
that a favored shipper is given too
low a rate. In such case the com
misrlon would have the right to fix
this already established minimum rate
as the maximum and it would need
only one or two such decisions by the
commission to cure railroad companies
of the practice of giving improper
minimum rates. My proposal is not
They Understood Each Other.
Mark Twain's first meeting with
James McNeill Whistler seems to have
been characteristic of both celebri
ties. This is how the famous humorist
describes it in some of his recollec
tions:
"I was introduced to Mr. Whistler
in his studio in London. I had heard
that the painter was on 'incorrigible
joker, and I was determined to get the
better of Mm, if possible. So I at once
put oa my most hopelessly stupid air.
Government Regulation of Railroad
Rates Is Strongly Urged—Insur
ance Legislation Needed.
•i
Vli
to give the commission power .to Ini
tiate or or originate rates generally,
but to regulate a rate already fixed or
originated by the roads, upon com
plaint and after investigation. A heavy
penalty should be enacted from any
corporation which fails to respect an
order of the commission. I regard this
power to.
establish a maximum rate as
being essential to any. scheme of real
reform in the matter of railroad regu
lation."
"I ask this legislation not. only in
the interest of the public, but in the
interest of the honest railroad man
and the honest shipper alike, for it is
they who are chiefly jeopardized by
the practices of their dishonest com
petitors."
Labor.
The president devotes considerable
space to the discussion of labor prob
lems. Regarding the demand for de
priving courts of the iower to. issue
injunctions In labor disputes, he says:
"Such special limitation of the equlty
powers of our courts would be most
unwise." The president's remedy is
to regulate the procedure by requiring
the judge to give due notice to the
adverse parties before granting the
writ, the heariug to be ex-parte If the
adverse party does not appear at the
tli\ie and place ordered. He renews
recommendations made in his last
message for an investigation by the
department of commerce and labor
of general labor conditions.
Insurance.,
"Recent events have emphasized the
importance of an early and exhaustive
consideration of this question, as to
whether it is not possible to furnish
better safeguards than the several
states have been able to furnish
against corruption of the flagrant kind
which has been exposed. it has been
only too clearly shown that certain of
the men at the head of these large
corporations take but small note of
the ethical distinction between hon
esty and dishonesty they draw the
line only this side of what may be
called law—honesty, the kind of hon
esty necessary to avoid falling into
the clutches of the law. There is
need of a far stricter and more uni
form regulation of the vast insurance
interests of this country. That Btate
supervision has proved Inadequate Is
generally conceded." The president
concludes this subject by urging con
gress to carefully consider whether
adequate legislation can be had.
The Revenues.
"There is more need of stability
than of the attempt to attain an ideal
perfection in the methods of raising
revenue and the shock and strain to
the business world certain to attend
any serious change lu these methods
render such change inadvisable un
less for grave reason. In time of
peace the revenue must on the aver
age, taking a series of years together,
equal the expenditures or else the rev
enues must be increased. Last year
there was a deficit. Unless our ex
penditures can be kept within the rev
enues then our revenue laws must be
readjusted.
The Currency.
The president points out the need
of the addition- of the element of elas
ticity to our currency, so that the cur.
rency will contract against specula
tion, and will expand for the needs
of legitimate business.
Reforms in Methods.
Congress is urged to consider the
question of necessary reforms in the
business methods of the various de
partments of the .government,' so as to
promote the economy, efficiency and
high character of government work.
The president repeats former rec
ommendations for the enactment of a
law directed against bribery and cor
ruption in federal elections.
Hague Conference.
Congress is urged to do all In its'
power to further the movement tor,
another Hague conference and to'
make the result of Its decisions effec
tive. The president hopes that the
conference may be able to devise
some way to make arbitration between
nations the customary way of settling
international disputes.
Army and Navy.
The importance of providing by ap
propriation provision for maneuvers of.
a practical kind to increase the effi
ciency of the army Is earnestly
recommended. Increase in the coast'
artillery force is also recommended.
.°r*he navy the president says:
We have most wisely continued for.
number of years to build up our navy,
and It has now reached a fairly high
standard of efficiency. This standard
of efficiency must not only be main
tained, but increased."
The president does not think it nec
esssary to Increase the navy bevond
the present number units, but to'sub
stitute efficient for inefficient units as
the latter become worn out. He thinks

urged, as Is also revision of the crim

Public Land Laws.'
The president again calls attention
to the condition of the public land
taws. He says that the iniquitous
-methods by which the monopolizing
of the public lands is being brought,
about under the present laws are be
coming more .generally known, but
the existing laws do not furnish effec
tive remedies. He says the recoiu
mendatlons of the public lands com
mission upon this subject, are wise and
should be given effect.
Civil Service.
The president says that any attempt
to carry on the great executive depart
ments of the government without, the
civil service law would inevitably re
sult in chaos. The'civil service com
missioners are doing excellent work
and their compensation is inadequate
considering the service they )erform.
Concluding on this subject, lie says:
"The civil service law is being ener
gcticallly and impartially enforced,
and in the large majority of cases
complaints of violations of either the
law or rules are discovered to be un
founded. The question of politics in
the appointment and retention of the
men engaged in merely ministerial
work has been practically eliminated
in almost the entire field of govern
ment employment covered by the civil
service law."
The Philippines.
"During the last year the Philippine
islands have been slowly recovering
from the series of disasters which,
since American occupation, have great
ly reduced the amount of agricultural
products below what was produced in
Spanish times. The war, the rinder
pest., the locusts, the drought, and the
cholera have been united as causes
to prevent a return of the prosperity
much needed In the islands. The most
seriouB is the destruction by the rin
derpest of more than 75 per cent of
the draft cattle. The income of the
Philippine government has necessarily
been reduced by reason of the busi
ness and agricultural depression and
the government has been obliged t.o.
exercise great economy. The transfer
of the friar lands has been effected.
"Tranquillity has existed during the
past year throughout the archipelago,
except in the, province of Cavlte, the
province of Sainar, and in the island
of Jolo among the Moros. The dis
turbances have all now been suppress
ed. The most encouraging feature of
the whole situation has been the very
great interest taken by the common
people in education.
The president earnestly "recom
mends that the tariff now. imposed by
the Dingley bill upon the the products
of the Philippine islands be entirely
removed, except the tariff on sugar
and tobacco, and that that tariff be re
duced to 25 per cent of the present
rates that after July 1, 1909, the tar
ff on sugar and tobacco produced iu
the Philippine islands be entirely re
moved, and that free trade between
the islands and the United States in
the products of each country then be
provided for by law.
In the judgment of the president
immediate §tepB should be taken for
the fortification of Hawaii.
Admission to 8tatehood.
The president recommends that In
dian Territory and Oklahoma be ad
mitted as one state and that New Mex
ico and Arizona be admitted as one
state.
The Panama Canal.
"The American people is pledged to
the speediest possible construction of
a canal adequate to meet the demands
which the commerce of the world will
make upon It, and I appeal most ear
nestly to congress to aid in the ful
fillment of the pledge. Gratifying
progress has been made during the
Past year, and especially during the
past foui months. The greater part
of the necessary preliminary work has
been done. The work of sanitation
has been thoroughly accomplished.
"What is needed now and without
delay, is an appropriation to meet the
current and accruing expenses of the
commission."
In Conclusion.
In conclusion, the president recom
mends more adequate provision than
has been-made- heretofore for the work
df the dephitment of state. Neither
at home nor abroad is there a suffi
cient working force to do the business
properly. Improvements in the con
sular service are recommended, in-,
eluding classification of the force and
readjustment of salaries, which the
president says, are in many cases ut
terly inadequate, considering the Im
portance of the service rendered.

suaded a second company to join
them. Numbering a thousand, the
mutineers marched to the barracks of
the 12 »th Kursk infantry, which,
however, remained loyal. Finally the
mutineers arrived at the barracks of

"The Azoff men answered their ap

opened fire upon them. The Azoffs
answered with three volleys. A |or
tion of the mutineers fled, but the
others continued firing. The Azoffs
replied with deadly volleys, and finally
the rebels fled headlong, throwing
down their arms. Two hundred of

MISSILE MEANT
1
Heavy Plumb Bob Is Hurled Through
Winds*
of Roosevelt's Train.,
Washington, Dec. 5.
Some
tilled person hurled*
nnlden-
heavy
plumb bob through
Iron
a
wtndpw of o&e
of the cars of President Roosevelt's
special train Saturday night an the f,
run from Princetdn to Washington.
The missile, which was thrown
with terrific force, crashed through
the glass transom of a window of the
combination car Salvitis and fell at the
feet of Maj. Webb Hayes, son ot the
late president. Rutherford B. Hayes,
who was a guest of the president on
the trip to the army and navy foot
ball game.
Fragments of: broken glass fell on
Maj. Hayes, who was sitting with his
back to the window, reading, but did
not Injure him in any way. Maj./
Hayes stooped and picked up the iron
missile which so narrowly had missed
his head, and then arose and exam
ined the broken window.
Going Slow in Fog.
The frame of the window was brok
en where the plumb bob had struck It,
so great, was the force with which It
had been hurled. The train at the time
—about 7:30 o'clock—was running
comparatively slow, owing to a dense
log which had rendered it Almost Im
possible for the engineer to see a
train length ahead ot him.
Broad street in North Philadelphia
had "just been crossed, and the train
was in the vicinity of Exford street
when the crash of glass aroused the
occupants of the car.
The Salvius was the first car of the
train, and in appearance might have
been mistaken very easily for the
president's private car. That was,
however at the rear of the train.
It was remarkable also that Maj.
Hayes from a profile view strongly re
sembles the president, and that sit
ting at the window in the position he
occupied in reading, he might have
been mistaken for President Roose*
velt.
Stones Recently Thrown.
Doubt was expressed by Pennsyl
vania road officials who were on the
train whether the missile was intend
ed to be hurled at the trhin. They said
that, several times recently stones
have been thrown at. trains passing
through North Philadelphia, and on
one recent occasion a man sitting near
one of the windows of a train was se
verely cut by glass broken by a heavy
stone thrown through it.
The implement was a most unusual
weapon to be in the hands of a boy,
who might in a spirit of deviltry throw
a stone at a train. It is Of cast iron
and weighs about three pounds. Had
it. struck Maj. Hayes on the head, as.
it. certainly would if it had passed
through the window a foot lower, he
would have been injured very serious*
ly, if not killed.
A Wanton Act.
The president knew nothing of the
Incident, for some time after it oc
curred. He made no comment upon
it. passing It off as the wanton act of
some irresponsible person. As a mat
ter of precaution the curtains of the
special train were drawn down when
the news of the incident reached tho
passengers.
The secret service officials who ac
companied the president took charge
of the missile and an effort will be
made to apprehend the person who
threw It.
To Be Investigated.
Philadelphia, Dec. 5.—As a result ot
the casting of a plumb bob Jnto Pres
ident Roosevelt's special as It was
passing through the northern part of
this city Saturday night, the Pennsyl
vania railroad officials and the Phila

in determined effort to break up the
practice of throwing missiles at
trains. A thorough investigation of
Saturday night's incident is in prog
