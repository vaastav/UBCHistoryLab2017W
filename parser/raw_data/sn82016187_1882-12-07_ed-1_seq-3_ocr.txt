THE NATIONAL TRIBUNE: WASHINGTON, D. 0., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1882.
w
PRESIDENTS MESSAGE
State of the Union Recommendations
to Congress.
President Arthur's message to the Senate and
House of Rcprcscntatlvea, submitted and read
in both Houses on Monday last, is a paper f
unusual interest, and we present below for the
benefit of our readers a carefully-prepared ab
stract of its contents.
The President first calls attention to the
gratifying condition of our foreign affairs.
Great Britain has practically manifested a dis
position to respect our rights by releasing from
custody such of our citizens as were arrested
under the coercion act, and tho President is of
tho opinion that time will do more than dis
cussion towards bringing about a substantial
accord as to the supervision and control of any
inter-oceanic ship canal across the isthmus.
The overtures made to Russia with reference to
the suppression of Hebrew proscription have
been courteously received, and toleration for
all faiths seems likely to be established in tho
near future. Tho international protection of
trade-marks, as well as submarine cables, is one
of the subjects now under consideration. The
President suggests that he should bo vested
with discretionary power to appoint delegates
to international conferences, and that provision
Ehould be made by Congress for tho expense in
cidental thereto. Our differences with Spain
on the subject of naturalization, as also the ex
cessive fines imposed in Spauish ports on Amer
ican shipping,remain unadjusted, and the Presi
dent expresses tho opinion that our remon
strances havo not received tho attention which
they deserve. Invitations havo been received
from Germany to participate in tho Inter
national Cattle Exhibition at Hamburg, in
July, 1SS3, and from Venezuela, to be rcpre
rented at the centennial celebration of tho birth
of Bolivar the founder of South American in
dependenceat Caracas, in tho same month,
when a statue to Washington will be begun and
an industrial exhibition beheld. The President
recommends the acceptance of the latter invi
tation. A new extradition treaty, embracing
the crime of assassination or attempted assassin
ation of the chief of the State, has been con
cluded with Belgium. Negotiations with re
gard to tho naturalization of Swiss emigrants
without the consent of the homo government
have been opened with Switzerland, and tho
emigration of paupers and criminals from that
country has ceased. Tho President refers
briefly to the unsettled question of this Gov
ernment's jurisdictional rights in Turkey, and
urges the immediate return of the Japanese
indemnity fund. Tho treaty lately concluded
with Corea awaits tho action of the Senate.
Apropos of the dispute as to the right of Chinese
citizens to pass through our territory the Presi
dent asks Congress to take such action as may
be deemed advisable. Attention is called to
the fact that the Hawaiian treaty will be term
inable after September 9, 1SS3, on twelve
months' notice from either party, and the
President recommends its renewal with such
modifications as our interests may demand.
Considerable space is devoted in the message to
review of our relations with Peru and Chili.
Under this head tho President says:
PERU AND CHILI.
A year since, as you have already been ad
vised by correspondence transmitted to you in
January last, this Government sent a special
mission to the belligerent powers to express
the hope that Chili would be disposed to accept
a money indemnity for tho expenses of the war
and to relinquish her demand for a portion of
the territory of her antagonist.
This recommendation, which Chili declined
to follow, this Government did not assume to
enforce; nor can it bo enforced without resort
to measures which would be in keeping neither
with the temper of our people nor with the
Epirit of our institutions.
The power of Peru no longer extends over its
whole territory, and, in tho event of our inter
ference to dictate peace, would need to bo sup
plemented by tho armies and navies of tho
United States. Such interference would al
most inevitably lead to the establishment of a
protectorate a result utterly at odds with our
past policy, injurious to our present interests,
and full of e'mbarassinents for the future.
For effecting the termination of hostilities
upon terms at once just to the victorious nation
and generous to its adversaries, this Govern
ment has spared no efforts save such as might
involve the complications which I havo indi
cated. It is greatly to be deplored that Chili seems
resolved to exact such rigorous conditions of
peace, and indisposed to submit to arbitration
the terms of an amicable settlement. No peace
is likeiy to be lasting that is not sufficiently
equitable and just to command the approval of
other nations.
The President then proceeds to state briefly
the reasons why the proposed Peace Congress
was postponed, and dismisses the subject by
expressing his readiness to support any meas
ures calculated to promote peace on this conti
nent and throughout the world, and commend
ing the benignant processes of international
arbitration as a substitute for war.
The proposition to do away with consular
fees, and pay our agents abroad a fixed salary,
-ceives his hearty approval.'

Dnring tho year there have been organized
171 national banks, and of tlioso institutions
there are now in operation 2,261). a larger num
ber than ever before. Tho valuoof their notes
in active circulation on July 1, 1SS2, was
$324,65(1,453.
The President adopts tho viow of the Secre
tary of tho Treasury that on this showing thcro
is a likelihood of a serious contraction of the
currency, unless Congress, by reducing taxa
tion, takes steps to avert it. He recommends
discontinuing tho coinago of silver dollars
only $33,000,000 out of tho $12S,000,000 coined
boing in circulation and retirement of tho
silver certificates because of the effect which is
likely to ensue from the active circulation of
gold certificates for which Congress recently
made provision.
THE INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES.
The President goes at length into tho discus
sion of tho question of repealing the internal
revenuo taxes and is very emphatic in his
recommendations, lie says :
I renew the expression of my conviction that
such rapid extinguishment of the national in
debtedness as is now taking place is by no
menus a cause for congratulation; it is a causo
rather for serious apprehension.
If it continues, it must speedily be followed
by one of tho evil results so clearly set forth in
the report of the Secretary.
Either the surplus must lie idle in tho Treas
ury, or tho Government will be forced to buy,
at market rates, its bonds not then redeemable,
and which, under such circumstances, cannot
fail to command an enormous premium, or the
swollen revenues will bo devoted to extravagant
expenditure, which, as experience has taught,
is ever tho bane of au overflowing treasury.
It was made apparent in the course of tho
animated discussions which this question
aroused at the last session of Gongrcss that the
policy of diminishing the revenue by reducing
taxation commanded the general approval of
the members of both Houses.
I regret that because of conflicting views as
to tho best methods by which that policy should
bo mado operative, none of its benefits have as
yet been reaped.
In fulfillment of what I deem my constitu
tional duty, but with little hope that I can
make valuable contribution to this vexed ques
tion, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own
views in relation to it.
Upon the showing of our financial condition
at tho close of tho last fiscal year, I felt justified
in recommending to Congress the abolition of
all internal-revenue taxes, except those upon
tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled
spirits and fermented liquors, and except also
the special tax upon the manufacturers of and
dealers in such articles.
I venture now to suggest that, unless it shall
be ascertained that the probable expenditures
of the Government for the coming year havo
been underestimated, all internal taxes, save
those which relate to distilled spirits, can bo
prudently abrogated.
Such a course, if accompanied by a simplifi
cation of the machinery of collection, which
would then be easy of accomplishment, might
reasonably be expected to result in diminish
ing the cost of such collection by at least two
million and a half of dollars, and in the retire
ment from oilice of from 1,500 to 2,000 persons.
The system of excise duties has never com
mended itself to tho favor of tho American
people, and has never been resorted to except
for supplying deficiencies in tho Treasury
when, by reason of special exigencies, the
duties on imports have proved inadequate for
the needs of the Government. The sentiment
of the country doubtless demands that the
present excise tax shall be abolished as soon as
such a course can be safely pursued.
It seems to me, however, that, for various
reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abo
lition of internal taxes would, for the present,
be an unwise step.
Two of these reasons are deserving of special
mention :
First, it is by no means clear that even if the
existing system of duties on imports is con
tinued Vithout modification, those duties alone
will yield sufficient revenue for all tho nerds of
the Government. It is estimated that $100,
000,000 will be required for pensions during tho
coming year, and it may well be doubted
whether the maximum annual demand for
that object has yet been reached. Uncertainty
upon this question would alone justify, in my
judgment, the retention for the present of that
portion of the system of internal revenue which
is least objectionable to the people.
Second, atotal abolition of excise taxes would
almost inevitably prove a serious, if not an in
surmountable obstacle to a thorough revision
of the tariff aud to any considerable reduction
in import duties.
Tho present tariff system is in many respects
unjust. It makes unequal distributions both of
its burdens and its benefits. This fact was
practically recognized by a majority of each
House of Congress in the passage of the act
creating the Tariff Commission. The report of
that commission will be placed before you at
the beginning of this session, and will, I trust,
afford you such information as to the condition
and prospects of the various commercial, agri
cultural, manufacturing, mining, and other in
terests of the country, and contain such sugges
tions for statutory revision, as will practically
aid your action upon this importai.t subject.
The revenue from customs for the fiscal year
ended June .'50, 1870, amounted to $1 37,000!000.
It iias in the three succeeding years reached,
first, $1. -(1,000,000; then $19.S,OOU,000; and final
ly, as has been already stated, $220,000,000.
The income from this source for the fiscal
year which will end on Juno .'50, 16S3, will
doubtli-is be considerably in excess of the sum
last mentioned.
If the tax on domestic spirits is to bo re
tained, it is plain, therefore, that largo reduc
tions from the customs revenue are entirely
feasible. While recommending this reduction,
I am far from advising the abandonment of the
policy of so discriminating in the adjustment
of details as to afford aid and protection to do
mestic labor. But the present system should
be so revised as to equalize the public burden
among all classes and occupations, and bring it
into closer harmony with the present, needs of
industry.
"Without entering into minute detail, which,
under present circumstaiues is quite unneces
sary, I recommend an enlargement of the free
list so as to include within it the numerous arti
cles which yield inconsiderable revenue, a sim
plification of the complex and inconsistent
schedule of duties upon certain manufactures,
particularly thoie of cot ton, iion, and steel. and
a substantial seduction of the duties upon those
articles, and up'm sugar, molasses, silk, wool,
and woolen goods.
If a general revision of the tariff shall be
found to be impracticable at this session, I ex
press tho hope that at. least some of the more
conspicuous inequalities of the present law may
he corrected before your final adjournment.
One of them is specially referred to by IheScc
retaiy. In view of a recent decision of tho
.Supreme Court, tho lier-eily of amending the
law by which the. Dutch standard of color is
adopted as the lest of the saccharine strength
of sugars is too obvious to require comment.
THE AKMV AND NAVV.
The President notes the absence of any seri
ous trouble on tho border during tho past year,
but urgca tho necessity of strengthening our
sea-coast defenses, providing an improved arm
ament, and enacting a new law for the arming
and equipping of the militia, lie also refers to
tho embarassment growing out of conflicting
laws regarding tho compulsory retirement of
army officers, and recommends that tho law bo
so amended as not to limit the number on the
retired list. In regard to tho condition of the
Navy, the President says :
It appears by the Secretary's report thnt the
available naval force of the United States con
sists of thirty-seven cruisers, fourteen single
turreted monitors, built during the rebellion, a
large number of smooth-bore guns aud Parrott
nlles, and thirty-seven rifled camion.
Tho cruising vessels should be gradually re
placed by iron or steel ships, tho monitors by
modern armored vessels, and the armament by
high-power rifle-guns.
The reconstruction of our Navy which was
recommended in my last message, was begun
by Congress authoring, in its recent act, the
construction of two largo unarmorcd steel ves
sels of the character recommended by the late
Naval Advisory Board, and subject to the final
approval of a new advisory board to be organ
ized as provided by that Act. I call your at
tention to the recommendation of the Secretary
and tho Board that authority be given to con
struct two more cruisers of smaller dimen
sions, and ouo fleet dispatch vessel, and that
appropriations be made for high-power rifled
cannon, and for the torpedo service and for
other harbor defenses.
Pending the consideration by Congress of the
policy to bo hereafter adopted in conducting
the eight large navy yards and their expensive
establishments, the Secretary advocates tho re
duction of expenditures therefor to the lowest
possiblo amounts.
For the purpose of affording the officers aud
seamen of tho Navy opportunities for exercise
and discipline in their profession, under appro
priate control and direction, the Secretary ad
vises that the Liight-llouso Service and Coast
j Survey be transferred, as now organized, from
I the. Treasury to the Navy Department; and he
aiso suggests, tor ino reason wmen no assigns,
that a similar transfer may wisely bo mado of
the cruising revenue vessels.
The Secretary forcibly depicts tho intimato
connection and interdependence of the Navy
and the commercial marine, and invites atten
tion to tho continued decadenco of tho latter
aud corresponding transfer of our growing
commerce to foreign bottoms.
This subject is one of the utmost importance
to the national welfare. Methods of reviving
American ship-building and of restoring tho
United States flag in the ocean carrying trade
should receive the immediate attention of Con
gress. Tho President does not express any opinion,
however, as to what method should bo adopted
to bring about this revival.
THE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
Concerning the impolicy of passing a River
and Harbor Bill during the present session of
Congress tho President is very outspoken. He
shows that on November 30th $17,73 1,9 1 1 of the
funds available for this purpose remained unex
pended, and points out that if any action should
seem to bo necessary in respect to particular
objects as, for instance, the Mississippi River
improvements it would bo entirely feasible to
provide for them by appropriate legislation.
The president then passes to the consideration
of tho unwisdom of making general appropria
tions after the manner of the River and Harbor
Bill, and suggests cither that each improvement
should be mado the object of a separate bill or,
if that will involve too much time, that tho
Constitution be so amended as to givo tho
Exccutivo tho power to veto special items of
a bill without afl'ecting the rest, just as the
Governors of fourteen States are now empow
ered to do in the caso of appropriation bills
passed by the State legislatures.
THE TOSTAL SERVICE.
The President calls attention to tho fact that
during the last fiscal year the receipts of the
Post Office Department exceeded its expendi
tures, and strongly urges tho reduction of letter
postage from threo to two cents. On this sub
ject he says :
Unless the experience of past legislation in
this country and elsewhero goes for naught, it
may be safely predicted that the stimulus of 50
per centum reduction in the tax for carriage
would at once increase tho number of letters
consigned to the mails.
The advantages of secrecy would lead to a
very general substitution of sealed packets for
postal cards and open circulars, and in divers
other ways tho volume of lirst-class matter
would be enormously augmented. Such increase
amounted in England, in the first year after tho
adoption of penny postage, to more than 125 per
cent.
As a result of careful estimates, the details of
which cannot be hero set out. I have become
convinced that the deficiency for the first year
after the proposed reduction would not exceed
7 per cent, of tho expenditures, or $3,000,000,
while the deficiency after the reduction of lb 15
was more than 14 per cent., and after that of
1S51 was 27 per cent.
Another interesting comparison is afforded
by statistics furnished mo by tho Post Office
Department.
The act of 1815 was passed in the face of tho
fact that there existed a deficiency of more than
$30,000. That of 1S51 was encouraged by the
slight surplus of $132,000, The excess of rev
enue in tho next fiscal year is likely to be
$3,500,000.
If Congress should approve these suggestions,
it may be deemed desirable to supply to somo
extent the deficiency which must for a time
result, by increasing the charge for carrying
merchandise, which is now only sixteen cents
per pound. But oven without such an increase
I am confident that tho receipts under tho di
minished rates would equal tho expenditures
after the lapse of three or four j'ears.
THE STAR-ROUTE CASES.
Referring to report of tho Department of
Justice, the President says:
In my message of December last I referred to
pending criminal proceedings growing out of
alleged frauds in what is known as the Star
Routo service of the Post Oilice Department,
and advised you that I had enjoined upon the
Attorney-General and associate counsel, to
whom the interests of the Government were
intrusted, the duty of prosecuting with the
utmost vigor of the law all persons who might
be found chargeable with those offenses. A
trial of one of these cases has since occurred.
It occupied for many weeks tho attention-of
the Supreme Court of this District, and was
conducted with great zeal and ability. It re
sulted in a disagreement of tho jury, but tho
cause has been again placed upon the calendar,
and will shortly be re-tried. If any guilty
persons shall finally escape punishment for
their offenses, it will not be for lack of diligent
and earnest efforts on the part of the prosecu
tion. MISCELLANEOUS MATTEHS
The President renews his recommendations
in favor of the passage of a general bankrupt
law and of extending to the Indian tho pro
tection of the law, alloting land in sovcralty
and providing for the industrial as well as in
tellectual training of youth. He also suggests
that it is a grave question whethor Congress
should not extend immediate and substantial
aid in tho work of education to States and
Territories where the census returns show that
illiteracy is alarmingly prevalent. The atten
tion of Congress is further directed to the im
portance of regulating inter-State commerce
by appropriate legislation, hut the President,
seems to think that no further action touching
tho suppression of polygamy will he necessary
for the present. The Pr.'sid.Mit a'ludes briefly
to the advisability of providing a form of civil
government for Alaska and legislating for the
protection and cultivation of forests, and then
goes on to speak at length of tho necessity of
reform in the civil service. Under this head
lie says:
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
The communication which I made to Con
gress at its first session in December l.'wt con
tained a somewhat lull statement of my s.;nti-'
ment.- in relation to the principle-; and ruJ"s
wbic'i ought to govern appointments to pu'jlio
service.
Rcfeiring to t'ae various plans which had
theretofore been tho subject of discussion in the
Natioual Legislature (pianswhich in the main
were modeled upon the system which obtains
in Great Britain, but which lacked certain of
the prominent features whereby thut systom. is
distinguished), I felt bound to intimato my
doubts whether they, or any ot them, would
afford adequate remedy for the evils which
they aimed to correct.
I declared, nevertheless, that if the proposed
measures should provo acceptable to Congress,
they would receive the unhesitating support of
the Executive.
Since these suggestions wcro submitted for
your consideration there has been no legislation
upon the subject to which they relate, but
there has meanwhile been an increase in the
.public interest in that subject, and thopeoplo
of tho country, apparently without distinction
of party, have in various ways, and upon fre
quent occasions, given expression to their
earnest wish for prompt and definite action.
In my judgment, such action should no longer
be postponed.
1 may add that my own scuso of its pressing
importance has been quickened by observation
of a practical phase of the matter, to which
attention lias more than onco been called by
my predecessors.
The civil list now comprises about 100,000
persons, far tho larger part of whom must,
under tho terms of tho Constitution, be selected
by the President either directly or through his
own appointees.
In the early years of tho administration of
the Government the personal direction of ap
pointments to the civil service may not havo
been an irksome task to tho Executive; but now.
that tho burden has increased fully a hundred
fold, it has become greater than ho ought to
bear, and it necessarily diverts his time and
attention from tho proper discharge of other
duties no less delicate and responsible, and
which, in the very nature of things, cannot be
delegated to other hands.
In the judgment of not a few who havo given
study anil reflection to this matter, tho Nation
has outgrown the provisions which the Consti
tution has established for filling the minor
offices in tho public service.
But whatever may be thought of the wisdom
or expediency of changing the fundamental
law in this regard, it is certain that much re
lief may he afforded, not only to tho President
and to tho heads of tho Departments, but to
Senators and Representatives in Congress, In
discreet legislation. They would be protected
in a great measure by the bill now pending be
fore the Senate, or by any other which should
embody its important features, from tho pres
sure of personal importunity and from the
labor of examining conflicting claims and pre
tensions of candidates.
I trust that before the close of the present
session some decisive action may be taken for
the correction of the evils which inhere in the
present methods of appointment, and I assure
you of my hearty co-operation in any measures
which are likely to conduce to that end.
As to the most appropriate term and tenure
of the official life of the subordinate employees
of the Government, it seems to be generally
agreed that whatever their extent or character,
the one should be definite and the other stable,
and that neither should bo regulated by zeal in
the service of party or fidelity to tho fortunes
of an individual.
It matters little to tho people at large what
competent person is at the head of this Depart
ment or of that bureau, if they feel assured that
the rcmow.l of one and the accession of another
will not involve the retirement of honest
and faithful subordinates, whoso duties are
purely administrative and have no legitimate
connection with the triumph of any political
principles or the success of any political party
or faction. It is to this latter class of ollicers
that tho Senate bill, to which I have already
referred, exclusively applies.
While neither that bill nor any other promi
nent scheme for improving tho civil service
concerns the higher grade of officials, who arc
appointed by tho President and confirmed 13'
the Senate, I feel bound to correct a prevalent
misapprehension as to the frequency with
which the present Executive has displaced tho
incumbent of an office and appointed another
in his stead.
It has been repeatedly alleged that ho has in
this particular signally departed from tho
course which has been pursued tinder recent
administrations of the Government. The facts
are as follows:
The whole number of Exccutivo appoint
ments during the four years immediately pre
ceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the presi
dency was 2,G9b
Of this number 211, or 9 per cent., involved
the removal of previous incumbents.
The ratio of removals to tho wholo number
of appointments was much tho same during
each of these four years.
In tho first year, with 790 appointments,
there wcro 74 removals, or 9.3 per cent. ; in the
second, with 917 appointments, there were S5
removals, or 8.5 per cent.; in the third, with
ISO appointments there were 4H removals or 10
per cent. ; in the fourth, with 429 appointments,
there were 37 removals, or S.tf per cent. In
the four months of President Garfield's admin
istration thero wcro 390 appointments and S9
removals, or 22.7 per cent. Precisely the same
number of removals (S9) has taken place in
the fourteen months which have since elapsed,
but they constitute only 7.S per cent, of tho
whole number of appointments (1,11S) within
that period, and less than 2.G of the entire list
of officials (3,159 exclusive of the Army and
Navy) which is filled by Presidential appoint
ment. I declare my approval of such legislation as
may be found necessary for supplementing the
existing provisions of law in relation to politi
cal assessments.
In July last I authorized a public announce
ment that employees of the Government should
regard themselves as at liberty to cxerciso their
pleasure in making or refusing to make politi
cal contributions, and that their action in that
regard would in no manner affect their official
status.
In this announcement I acted upon the view
which T had always maintained and still main
tain, that a public otlicer should be as absolutely
free as any other citizen to give or to withhold a
contribution for the aid of the party of his
choice. It lias, however, been urged, and
doubtless not without foundation in fact, that
by solicitation of official superiors and by other
modes, such contributions have at times been
obtained from persons whose only motive for
giving has been the fear of what might befall
them if they refused. It goes without saying
that such contributions aro not voluntary, and
in my judgment their collection should bo pro
hibited by law. A bill which will effectually
suppress them will receive my cordial ap
proval. CONCLUSION.
After alluding to the requirements of the
District of Columbia and the propriety of legis
lating on the disputed points touching the
'residential succession in the caso of tho in
ability of the President to dischargo his duties,
before another national election, the "President
concludes his message as follows:
Tho closing year has been replete with bless
ings for which we owe to the Giver of all Good
our reverent acknowledgment. For the unin
terrupted harmony of our foreign relations, for
the decay of sectional aniinosties, for tho exu
berance of our harvests and the triumphs of our
mining and manufacturing industries, for the
prevalence of .health, the spread of intelligence
and the conservation of tins public credit, for
the growth of tho country in all tho elements
of national greatness for these and couutless
other bleaJngs we should rejoice and be glad.
F trust that, under the inspiration of this great
prosperity, our counsels may be harmonious,
aud that the dictates of prudence, patriotism,
justice, and economy may lead to tho adoption
'of measures in which the Congress and tho Ex
ecutive may heartily unite.

chapter of the " Siege of Knoxvillc." With the
chapter we publish two good maps, one of
Kuoxville and tho immediate vicinity, show
ing all the fortifications sun (funding the city,
and the other a map of Must Tennessee. The
chapter is a graphic description of tho storming
if Fort Sanders, one of the most famous battles
of the civil war. The history of Longstrcet's
campaign in East Tennessee is very interesting,
aud we aro pleased to know that so many of
the readers of tlte Tribune have preserved their
topics of the paper containing these articles.
We have sold- a largo number of extra copies j
containing this scrap of war history, and calls
for hack numbers aro frequent. We cm still j
supply a few of tho complete sets of six copies
at five cents a copy.
The six chapters of tho " Siege of Knoxville "
were copied from the columns of Thk Na
tional Tribune, published at Washington,
D. C, and the editor of that excellent paper
kindly furnished us tho maps which appear on
our third page. We can recommend The Na
tional Tribune to all old soldiers and to
everybody interested in the history and remi
niscences of the late war. It is a large, eight
page, weekly paper, published at tho extremely
low price of one dollar a year. The last issue
contained a five-column history and descrip
tion of tho "Battle of Gettysburg," besides
several other chapters of war history and a
largo amount of other reading matter.
THE TARIFF COMMISSION.
A Report in Faror of a Moderate Reduction of the
Duties.
The report of the Tariff Commission'was sub
mitted to the House of Representatives on
Monday by the president of the commission,
John L. Hayes. It is a very long and compre
hensive document, with an appendix equally
formidable.
Tho commission declares that high duties
havo a tendency to create prejudice, to causo
unsafe investment of capital, to cause a ple
thora of certain commodities; that tho time has
come when a reduction from high war rates
can safely bo made, and that the increase in
the productions by tho older industries is suffi
cient to admit of a reduction without impair
ment of ability to compete.
Tho reductions on tho average and as a
wholo approximate twenty per cent., and will
perhaps reach twenty-fivo per cent. It has
been the effort of the Commission to make the
reduction apply to commodities of necessary
general consumption and to diminish or with
hold tho reduction upon commodities of high
cost requiring more labor, and which, being
consumed principally by the more wealthy
classes, could bear higher duties, at the same
time supplying revenue and encouraging the
higher arts without being oppressive in their
operation.
It has been sought invariably to make a dis
crimination in the rate of duties imposed on a
manufactured product and the raw material or
partly manufactured product of which it is
made, the object being to impose a higher duty
upon the latter. In some cases the revision has
no regard for the revenue feature, as with books,
tho tariff on which is largely reduced in the
jnterests of education and progress, while that
on works of art is increased, to oncourage
American artists.
Tho report discusses at length the import
ance of American industry and commerce, giv
ing statistics at length and putting the annual
industrial product of the country at six billions
of dollars, and showing that the United States
in the matter of productive interests is now the
first country in the world.
Appended to the report is a full tariff bill,
with schedules and detailed references to fif
teen schedules describing the Commission's
reasons for making tho proposed changes.
The reduction fixes the duty on steel rails at
$17.92 per ton, or eighty cents per one hundred
pounds. All other parts of tho iron schedule
are consistent with this. Tiiere is au entirely
new schedulo of chemicals, based upon scien
tific methods, and a schedule upon metals ar
ranged upon a new plan.
The reduction in wool is said in the report
to bo of such a character as will commend itself
to the public, the greatest reduction being upon
the article of blankets, upon which tho tariff
ws particularly excessive. No duty is recom
mended on quinine and the duty on wood-pulp
is abolished, though that on wood and lumber
is retained. Some concessions were made, it is
apparent, to satisfy public opinion and meet the
peculiar wants of various interests.
The report proper, exclusive of the testimony,
makes over 2,000 pages, and until it is printed
the details of the changes in the existing tariff
recommended by the committee cannot be sat
isfactorily stated.
WHAT IS IT?
Tho Experience of a Trilmno Reporter "Who Tried
to l'ind Out.
"It seems to mo I havo seen that adver
tisement before," said the editor of The
Trirune, '"but, do you know, I havo not the
slightest idea whether the medicine is really
good for anything or not. Have you ? "
The reporter of The Tribune to whom this
strange question was addressed, replied that he
had a vague recollection of having read some
thing about it in the newspapers, but, so far as
ho was personally concerned, he was entirely
unacquainted with its merits.
" Well," said the editor of The Tribune, " I
should like to know what sort of a thing it is
that I am advertising as St. Jacobs Oil, the
Great German Remedy for Pain. Suppose you
take a holiday and sec if you can find out?"
At the suggestion of a " holiday " the reporter
put on his hat. At the Riggs House he paused
a moment to have his boots blacked. As it
happened, Mr. Robert Williams was on hand
to supply the polish.
Mr. Williams is the Nestor of bootblacks.
Ho was S3 years old on the 3d of June last, and
has practiced his profession for 29 consecutive
years. Despite his years, Mr. Williams is still
halo and hearty, and his knowledge of tho art
of boot-blacking is something astonishing.
" I can't blacken as many shoes as I used to,"
said he, " my hands aro beginning to get a
little stiff now!"
"Rheumatism?"
" No, I guess not. If it was rheumatism I
should know what to do for it."
" Yes ? What would you do ? "
" Why, I would use St.. Jacobs Oil, of course.
There's Ned Smith, who used to be carver at
the Ebbitt House for so many years. lie has
been down with rheumatism for several mouths,
but I sent him a bottle of that oil a few weeks
ago, and ho tells mo ho is mending right fast
now."
"Boots!"
"Tako a chair, sir!" and Mr. Williams, re
adjusted his spectacles, and getting out his
brushes again, set to work to polish off the next
customer.
" Well, said the reporter to himself, " it is
the unexpected which always happens ! Here's
one man, anyhow, who knows what St. Jacobs
Oil is good for ! "
In tho Ebbitt nousc, a few minutes later,
The Trirune man ran across Major Peabody,
of Colorado. The major is one of those genial,
whole-souled gentlemen, whom it is always a
pleasuro to meet, and, in appearance, ho is the
very picture of health. As a matter of fact,
however, he has been at times a great sufferer
from rheumatism, as tho writer knew.
"Have you ever used St. Jacobs Oil, Major?"
he ventured to inquire.
The major smiled. He had evidently been
asked that question before
"Oh, yes," he replied; "T have used St.
Jacobs Oil, and it is the best remedy for rheu
matism that I know of. I always keep a bottle
handy."
' Well, tell me, Major how did you come to
try it, in tho first place?"
"Major J. Mclvee Dunn, of General Pope's
staff, recommended it to me two years ago, and
I have used it ever since. But there if I say
anything more you'll write a column about it
in the newspapers."
"Just one question more,'' insisted the re
porter, who Wiis unwilling to let the opportu
nity slip. " Do you know anybody else in
Washington who uses St. Jacobs Oil?"
"A good many," auswercd the major, "but I
can't stop to name them over. You see, wo old
stagers, who have twinges now and then of
rheumatism or gout, aro in the habit of com
paring notes, and when wo come across a really
good remedy we pass the word around. '
The Tribune man turned to pursue his in
quiries in another direction, when he was hailed
by Mr. R. E. Odium, the famous swimmer,
whoso aquatic feats at tho various seaside re
sorts along tho Atlantic coast have formed tho
i subject of many an entertaining newspaper
j article. Mr. Odium had recently returned from
Old Point Comfort, where he conducted a suc
cessful bathing and swimming establishment
last summer, and when he was asked what ho
knew about St. Jacobs Oil, he replied at onco
that he knew all about it had used it regu
larly at his school, and wouldn't be without it
for anything. It was just the tiling to rub a
man down with when he had been making any
unusual physical exertion it took all the sore
ness out of his joints and muscles, and acted
like a charm. As Mr. Odium stands unrivalled
in his profession, and has had a long and varied
experience, testimony like this seemed to
The Tribune man well worth taking.
He had just made a note of it, when, on look
ing up, he saw at his elbow Mr. S. A. Curtis,
the manager of the Washington rink.
"What is the outlook for the season?" asked
tho reporter.
" Very good, I think. I hope to make it tho
most popular resort in the city this winter, and
if you want to pass a merry evening, drop in
sometime."
" Thanks, but just now I am engaged in n,
still hunt. And, by tho way, didn't you tell
me once that St. Jacobs Oil had cured you of
rheumatism?"
"Certainly; I thought everybody had read
that story of the ' trials of a cashier? ' If you
will look back over the files of the Washington
papers you will find the whole story. You'ro
not the first newspaper man who has inter
viewed me on the subject and I'm afraid you
wont be the last. But I've nothing to retract,
so good-bye," and the popular manager of tho
Rink hurried off to look after tho interests of
his skaters.
The Tribune man buttoned up his over
coat, hailed a passing car, and was presently
rattling along at a jolly pace in the direction of
the Baltimore and Ohio depot. " Ic is perfectly
clear," he said to himself, "that opinion in
Washington is all ono way as regards tho vir
tues of St. Jacobs Oil, and nothing now remains
but to find out what old St. Jacob himself has
to say about it. I'll run over to Baltimoro and
beard him in his den."
An hour later The Tribune's representative
walked into the counting-room of the Charles
A. Vogelcr Company, at IS i W. Lombard street,
aud presented his card.
"What can we do for you?" said a gentle
man with a winning smile, looking up from
the mass of letters and proof-sheets that en
cumbered his desk.
" Nothing that is, I want to know in tho
interest of suffering humanity and the editor
of The Tribune "
"What?"
"Yes, that's just tho word what is St. Jacobs
Oil?"
"St. Jacobs Oil? Why St. Jacobs Oil is tho
great German remedy for pain."
" Oh, yes, I know that, hut what is it mado
of?"
" What is it made of? Why the simplest in
gredients in the world, every one of which ha3
been known to chemists for years and the effi
cacy of which none of them will dispute. It is
what the physicians call a good counter-irritant,
and the beauty of it is that it is cheap, easily ob
tained, and can be used without the aid of a doc- .
tor. We have sold you would not believe mo
if I told you how many million bottles, and
the demaud is constantly increasing. Why just
think of it, St. Jacobs Oil is almost as well
known at Cape Town, Africa, as in the United
States, and we are obliged to print the dircc
tions on the wrapper of each bottle in fourteet
different languages. But, now that you ars
here, you must not go away without seeing for
yourself how our business is conducted," and,
tapping a bell, a clerk was summoned and di
rected to show the reporter through the build
ing. What he saw while making the tour of tlu
various departments it would take a page o
The Tribune to describe. In the busy season
some three hundred hands aro employed in
this hive of industry, but its operations aro so
thoroughly systematized thnt they seem to
the visitor to be almost automatic. The
Tribune man was particularly interested in
the advertising department where contracts
are mado with every newspaper of importance
in tho whole country, and somo thousands esr
amined daily bj- the company's readers to sea
that the terms of these contracts aro complied
with and in tho course of conversation with the
manager he inquired whether he had received
any testimonials from Washington recently.
" Why, yes," ho replied, " here is one that I
am sure your readers will be interested in."
And he handed tho reporter a letter from tho
military editor of The Tribune, in which,
bespeaks of St. Jacobs Oil in the highest terms,
and adds: "I have several times remarked
after witnessing its magical operation, that I
would cheerfully pay ono hundred dollars for
a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil if I could not get
it cheaper."
"Any more?"' asked The Tribune reporter,
as he handed back the letter.
"Yes, some of the. most distinguished men
of Maryland and of Washington give their
most unqualified endorsement of the Great
German Remedy St. Jacobs Oil as tho un
rivalled and miraculous pain-cure of the age.
Ex-Gov. Hon. Odcn Bowie, president Baltimoro
City Passenger Railway Co., also president
Maryland Jockey Club, writes : ' In my family
and in my private stables, as well as thoso of
the City Railway Co., I have used it most satis-
i factorily.' Hon. Geo. Colton, Police Commis
sioner, Baltimore, Md., writes : " U herever I
have traveled in England, France, Germany,
Egypt, or the Holy Land, St. Jacobs Oil was
recognized as a blessing to humanity.' Col. J.
D. Ferguson, secretary Maryland Jockey Club,
says: ' I have had glowing tributes paid to tho
clHcacy of St. Jacobs Oil by prominent turf
men.' Gen. Rufus Ingalls, Quartermaster
General U. S. A., writes: I consider St. Jacobs
Oil the best pain-cure for sprains and bruisea
ever used.' Hon. M. G. Urner. M. C, from
Maryland, writes: '.My wife bears cheerful
testimony to its superior virtues. Mr. M. Y.
Bailey, superintendent of tho mails, Baltimoro
postotlicc. writes: 'It is the best remedy in tho
world for rheumatism, soro feet and joints.
Fishermen and guuners should always keep a
bottle.' Col. Harrison Adrcon. postmaster,
Baltimore, Md., says: 'I always keep a bottle
of St. Jacobs Oil in my house; it is an excellent
remedy.' Col. Graham Dukehart. Commander
Department of Maryland, G. A. R., Baltimoro,
Md., writes that from tho use of St. Jacobs Oil
ho has received great benefit. Richard Crom
well, Esq., president of the Mt. Yernon Co.,
which employs eight hundred bauds in the
cotton mills at Mt. Yernon, Baltimoro county,
Md., gives tho hearty endorsement to St. Jacobs
Oil of that vast enterprise."
"That will do," said The Tribune repre
sentative. "I shall leavo for "Wellington by
tho next train and report the result of my in
vestigations." He did so, and that is how the editor of Tns
Tribune came to know what it was that he
was advertising in his paper as "The Great
German Remedy."
