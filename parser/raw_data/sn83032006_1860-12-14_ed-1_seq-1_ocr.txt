LIST ML MESSAGE
OF
JAMES BUCHANAN,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
FELLOW-CITIZENS Of THE SENATE AND HODSE OP
REPRESENTATIVES Throughout the year since our
lart meeting, the country has tieen eminently pros
perous JD all its material interests. Tho general
health has been excellent, our hai vests have been
abundant, and plenty smiles throughout the land.
Our commerce and manufactures have been prose
cuted with energy and industry, and hive yielded
fair and ample returns. In short, no nation in the
tide ot time has ever presented a spectacle of greater
material prosperity than we have done until within
a verv recent period.
Why is it. then, that discontent now so exten
sively prevails, aod the Uuion of the States, which
is tbe source of all these blessings, is threatened
with destruction 1 The long continued and intem
perate interference ot the Northern people with
tbe question of slavery in the Southern States has
at length produced its natural effects. The differ
ent sectious of the Union are now arrayed against
each other, and the time has arrived, so much
(headed by the Father of his Country, when hostile
geographical parties have been formed. I have
long foreseen and often forewarned my countrymen
of the now impending dauger. This does not pro- j
cee i solely from the elaim on the part of Congress
or the territorial legislatures to exclude slavery from
the Territories, nor from the efforts of different I
States to defeat tbe execution of the Fugitive :
Slave law. All or any of those evils might have ;
Been endured by the South without danger to the i
Union, (as others have been,) in the hope that time j
and reflection might apply the remedy. Tbe im-J
mediate peril arises not so much from these causes •
as irorn the fact that the incessant and violent agi- |
tation of the slavery question throughout the North
for the last quarter of a century, has at length pro
duced its malign influence upou the slaves and in
spired them with vague notions of freedom—
>iettee a sense of security no longer xiats around
the family altar. This feeling of peace at home
ims giver, place to apprehensions of servile insur
rection. M any a matron throughout the South re
tires at night in dread of what may befall herself
and her children before the morning. Should this j
apprehension of domestic danger, whether real or
imaginary, extend and intensity itself until it shall
pervade the masses ot the Southern people, then
disunion will become inevitable. Self-preserva
tion is the firs: liw of nature, and his been im
pkilted in the heart of man by his Creator for the
wisest purpose; and no political union, however
fraught with blessings and benefits in all other re
spects, can long contiuue, if tbe necessary conse
quence bo to render the homes and firesides of
nearly half the parties to it habitually and hope
lessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of such
u Union must be severed. It is my oonvlcWon Oat
this fatal period has not yet arrived ; and my prayer .
ro God is that He would preserve the Constitution j
and the Union throughout all generations. ,
Bat let us take warning in time, and remove the I
cause of danger. It cannot be denied that, for five
and twenty years, the agitation at the North against
slavery in the South, has been incessant. In 1835 ;
tctorial handbills, and inflammatory appeals, were }
circulated extensively throughout the South, ola
character to excite the passions of the slaves ; and, j
1 the language of General Jackson, "to stimulate
them to insurrection, and produce all the horrors
of a servile war." This agitation has ever since j
teen eontined by the public press, by the proceed
ings of State and County conventions, and by j
abolition sermons ami lectures. The time ol Con
gress has been occupied in violent speeches on this
never-ending subject; and aopeals in pamphlet and
other forms, endorsed by distinguished names, have
been ser.t forth from this central point, and spread
broadcast over the Union. i
How easy would it he for the American people to
settle the slavery question forever, and to restore
peace and harmony to this distracted country.
They, and they alone, can do it. All that is
necessary to accomplish the object, and all for
which the slave States have ever contended, is to
' let alone, and permitted to manage tbeir domes
tic institutions in their own way. As sovereign
States, tliev, and they alone, are responsible be
fore God and the world for slavery existing amoDg
them. For this, the people of the North are not!
more responsible, and have no more right to inter- j
ff-re, than with similar institutions in Russia or in
Brazil. Upon tbeir good sense and patriotic for- j
bearance I confess I still greatly tely. Without;
their aid, it is beyond tbe power of any President,
no matter what may be his own political proclivi
ties, to restore peace and harmony among the
Slates. Wisely limited and restrained as is his
power, under our Constitution and laws, he alone
can accomplish but little, for good ol for evil, on
such a momentous question.
And luis brings me to observe that the election
jf any one of our fellow-citizens to the office of
President does not of itself afford just cause for
dissolving the Union. This is more especially true
if his election bas beeD effected by a mere plurali
ty, and not a majority, of tbe people, and has re
sulted from transient and temporary causes, which
may probably never again occur. In order to
justify a reseit to revolutionary resistance, the
Federal Government must be guilty of "a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise" of powers not
granted by the Constitution. The late presiden
tial election, however, has been held in strict con
formity with its express provisions. How, then,
can the result justify a revolution to destroy tbis
very Constitution ? Reason, justice, a regard for
the Constitution, all require that w shall wait for
some overt and dangerous act on the part of the
President el ct before resorting to such a remedy-
It is said, however, that ibe antecedents ot tbe
President elect bav* tieen sufficient to justify the
fears of the Soutn that he will attempt to iuvade
their constitutional rights. But are such appre
hensions of contingent danger in the future suffi
cient to justify the immediate destrutcion of the
nolbst system of government ever devised by
mortals 1 From the very nature of his office, and
Its high responsibilities, he must necessarily be con
re.v.;tj?c. The stern duty of administering the
vast and complicated concerns ot this Government
aff rds in itself a guarantee that he will not at
tempt anv violation of a clear constitutional right.
Ai.. r ail," he i no more than the chief executive
officer of the Government. His proviuce is not to
make, but to execute, tiie laws; and it is a re
mark: lie fact in our history, that, notwithstanding
the repeated efforts ol the anti-slavery party, no
single act has ever passed Congress, unless we may
possibly ixcept the Missouri Compromise, impair
ing Su the slightest degree, the rights of the South
to IL L- prop.rty in slaves. And it may also be
observed, judging from present indications, that no
possibility exists ot the pasrage of such an act, by
a majority of both Houses, either in the present or
the next Congress. Surely, under these circum
s.aran, we ought to be restrained from present ac-
ti on by the precept of Ilita who spake as never man
s;>ok<\ ■*.! it "sdßciefit unto the day is the evil
ticrt-f .*' The day of evil may never come, un
ess we shall rashly bring it upon ouraclvea.
it is alk fwd as oc<- cause for immediate seces-
sion that the Southern States are denied equal
rights wit* the other States in the commou Terri-
tories. But ! y what authority are these denied I
Net by Congress, which has never passed, and I
beSieve.uevi r will pass, any act to exclude slavery
item these Territories : and cettainly not by the
Supremo Court, which baa solemnly decidei that
slaves are property, and, like all other property,
their owners have a right to take them into the
common Territories, and hold them there under
the protection of the Constitution.
So far, then, as Congress is concerned, the ob
jection is not to anything they have already done,
but to what they may do hereafter. It will surely
be admitted that this apprehension of future dan
ger is no good reason for an immediate dissolution
of the Union. It is true that the territorial legis
lature of Kansas, on the 23d of February, 1860,
passed ia great baste an act, over the veto of the
governor, declaring that slavery "is and shall be,
forever prohibited in this Territory Such an
act, however, plainly violating the rights of prop
erty secured by the Constitution, wilisurely be de
clared void by the judieiary whenever it shail be
presented iu a legal form.
Only three days after my inauguration the Su- j
preuie Court of the United States solemnly adjudged
that this power did not exist in a territorial legisla
ture. Yet such has been the factious temper of
the times that the correctness of this decision has
been extensively impugned before the people, and
the question has given rise to angry political con
flict throughout the country. Those who have ap
pealed from this judgment of our highest constitu
tional tribunal to popular assemblies would, if they
could, iuvest a territorial legislature with power to
annul the sacred rights of property. This power
Congress is expressly forbidden by the Federal
Constitution to exercise. Every State legislature
in the Union is forbidden by its own constitution
to exercise it. It cannot be exercised in any State
except by tue people in their highest sovereign
capacity whan framing or amending their State
constitution. In like manner, it can only be ex
ercised by the people of a Territory represented in
a convention of delegates for the purpose of fram
ing a constitution preparatory to admission as a
State into the Union. Then, and not until then,
are they invested with power to decide the question
whether slavery shall or shall not exist within their
limits. This is an act of a sovereign authority,
and not of subordinate territorial legislation.—
Were it otherwise, then indeed would the equality
ot the States in the Territories be destroyed, and
S the rights of property in slaves would depend, not
| upon the guarantees of the Constitution, but upon
i tbe shifting majorities of an irresponsible territorial
I legislature. Such a doctrine, from its intrinsic un
j soundness, cannot long influence any considerable
portion of onr people, much less can it afford a
good reason for a dissolution of the Union.
Tbe most palpable violations of constitutional
duty which have yet been committed consist in tho
acts of different State legislatures to defeat the ex
ecution of the fugitive slave law. It ought to be
remembered, however, that for these acts, neither
Congress nor any President can justly be bell te
sponsible. Having been passed in violation of the
Federal Constitution, they are therefore null and
void. AM ttie courts, both State and National,
before who n the question lias arisen, havefrom the
begtsulßg d,Urd uae fugitive *Uv& law to be eOst
stilutiouai. l'Ue single exception is tnat of a State
I court in Wisconsin ; and this lias not only Imen
J reversed by the proper appelate tribunal, but bis
| met with such universal reprobation that there can
j be no danger from it as a precedent. The validity
j of this law has been established over and over again
by tin; Supreme Court of tbe United States with
j perfect unanimity. It is founded upon an express
1 provision of the Constitution, requiring tlwt fngi
i live slaves who escape from service in one State to
another shall ba "delivered up" to their misters.—*
Without this provision it is a well-known historical
I fact that tbe Constitution itself coull never hive
been adopted by the Convention. In one form or
| other under the acts of 1793 and 1850, both being
: substantially the same, the fugitive slave law has
been the law of the land from the days of Wash-
I ington until the present moment. Here, then, a
clear case is presented, in which it will be tbe duty
of the next President, as it has been my own, to
i act with vigor in executing this supreme law against
the conflicting enactments of Stale legislatures.—
Should he fail in the performance of this high duty,
he will then have manifested a disregard of the
Constitution and laws, to tbe 1 great injury of the
people of nearly one-half the States of tbe Union.
But are we to presume in advance that he will thus
violate his duty 1 This would be at war with every
principle of justice and of Christian charity. Let
us w.ut for the overt act. The fugitive-slave law
tus been carried into execution in every contested
i case since the commencement of the present ad
i ministration , though often, it is to be regretted,
: with great loss and inconvenience to the master,
' and with considerable expense to the government.
i Let us trust that the State legislatutes will repeal
their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments. —
j Unless this shall be done without unnecessary dc
i lay, it is impossible for any Human power to save
I the Union.
Tbe Southern States, standing on the basis
of tbe Constitution, have a rigbt to demand tbis
act of justice troua the States of the North.—
Should it be refused then tho Constitution, to
which all tbe States are parties, will have been
willfully violated by one portion of tbeua in a
provisiou essential to the domestic seoarity and
happiness of tbe remainder. In that event tbe
injured States, after having first used all peace
ful and constitutional meaus to obtaio redress,
would be justified in revolutionary resistance to
the Government of the Union.
I have purposely confined my remarks to rev
olutionary resistance, because it has been claim
ed withiu tbe lust two years that any State,
whenever tbis shall be its sovereign will and
pleasure, may secede frooi tbe UnioD, in accord
ance with tho Constitution, and without auy
violation of the constitutional rights of the oth
er taeni ae re of the Confederacy. That as each
became parties to the Union by tbe vote of its
owu people assembled in Convention, so any
one of them may retire from the Union in a
similar manner by the vote of such a conven
tion.
lu order to justify secession as a constitu
tional remedy, it must be on the principle tbat
the Federal (iovernmeot is a mere voluntary as
sociation of States, to be dissolved at pleasure
by any one ot the contracting parties. If this
be so, the Confederacy is a rope of sand, to be
penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse
wave of public opinion in any of the States.—
lu this manner our thirty-three States may re
solve themselves into as many petty, jarring,
and hostile republics, each one retiriug from
the Union, without responsibility, whenever any
sudden excitement might impel them to such a
course. By this process a Union might be en
tirely broken into fragments in a few weeks,
which cost our forefathers many years of toil,
privation, and blood to establish.
Such a principle is wholly inconsistent with
the history as well as the character of the Fed
eral Constitution. After it was framed, with
the greatest deliberation and care, it was sub
mitted to conveutioßs of the people of the seve
ral States for ratification. Its provisions were
discussed at length in these bodies, composed
BEDFORD. PA., FRIDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1860.
of tbe first men of the country. Its opponents
contended that it conferred powers upon the
Federal Government dangerous to the rights of
the States, whilst its advocates maintained that
under a fair construction of the instrument
there was no foundation for such apprehensions.
In that mighty struggle between the first intel
lects of this or any other country, it never oc
curred to any individual, either among its op
ponents or advocates, to assert, or even to inti
mate, that their efforts wore all vain labor,
becauso tbe moment that auy State telt. herself
aggrieved she might secede from the Union.—
What a crushing argument would this have
proved against those who dreaded that the rights
of the States would be endangered by the Con
stitution. The truth is, that it was not until
many years after the origin of tbe Federal Gov
ernment that such a proposition was first ad
vanced. It was then met and refuted by the
conclusive arguments of Gen Juokson, who in
his message of 16th January, 1833, transmit
ting the nullifying ordinanoe of South Carolina
to CoDgress, employs the following language:
"The right of the people of a single State to
absolve themselves at will, and without the con
sent of tbe other States, from their most solemn
obligations, and hazard the liberty and happi
ness of the millions composing this Union,
cannot bo acknowledged. Such authority is
believed to be utterly repugnant both to the
principles upon which the General Government
is constituted and to tho objects which it was
expressly formed to attain."
It is not pretended that any clause in tbe
Constitution gives countenance to such a theo
ry. It is altogether founded upon inference,
not from any language contained in the instru
ment itself, but fiom the sovereign character
of the several Statos by which it was ratified.
But is it boyond the power of a State, Rko an
individual, to yield a portion of its sovereign
right to secure tbe remainder? In tbe language
of Mr. Madison, who has been called the father
of the Constitution: "It was formed by the
States—that is, by the people in each of the
States, acting in theirdiigheat sovereignty ca
pacity; and formed consequently by tho same
authority which formed tho State constitution."
"Nor is the Government of the Uoited States
oreated by the Constitution, less a Government
in the strict sense of tbe term, within
of ire powers, than the gjove-rttMJit ere
the constitutions of tiie "States are within their
severe! spheres. It is, like thetu, orgauized j
into legislative, executive, and judieiary de- >
part moots. It operates, like them, directly on |
persons and things; and, like them it has at
command a physical force lor executing the
powers commit'ed to it.
It wis intended to be perpetuated, aud not
to be annulled at the pleasure of any one of ,
the contracting parties. The old articles ot !
confederation were entitled "Articles of Con
federation aud Perpetual Union between tho
State#;" and by the 13th article it is expressly
declared that "the articles of this Confedera
tion &bali be inviolably observed by every State,
and the Union snail bo perpetual." The pre
amble to the Constitution of the United States,
having express reference to tho articles of Con
federation, recites that it was established "in
older to form a more perfect Union." And
yet it is contended that this "more perfect
Union" does not include the essential attribute
of perpetuity.
But that tbe Union wis designed to be per
petual appears conclusively from the nature aDd
exteut of the [rowers conferred by the Consti
tution on tbe Federal Government. These pow
ers embrace tbe very highest attributes of ua
tional sovereignty. Tbey place both the sword
aud the purse under its control. Congress has
power to make war, and t < make peace; to raise
and support armies and navies, and to conclude
treaties with foreign governments. It is in
vested with the power to coin money, and to
; regulate tbe value thereof, and to regulate com
| meroe with foreign nations, aDd among the sev
; eral Slates. It is not necessary to enumerate
i the other high powers wbieb have been confer
: red upon tbe Federal Government. In order
|to carry the enumerated powers into effect,
| Congress possesses the exclusive right to lay
and collect duties on imports, and :u common
with the States to lay and collect all other
j taxes.
Hut the Constitution lias not only conferred
these high powers upon Congress, bat it has
adopted effectual uieanß to restrain the States
from interfering with their exercise. For that
purpose it has, in strong prohibitory lauguage,
expressly declared tbat "no State shall enter
into any treaty, alliance or confederation; grant
letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit
bilis ot credit; make anything but gold and
silver coiu a tender in payment of debts; pass
any bill of attainder ex post Jaclo law, or law
luipairiug the obligation of contracts." More
over, "without the consent of Congress, no
Slate shall lay any imposts or duties on any
imports or exports, except what may be abso
lutely necessary for executing its inspection
laws;" and, if they exoeed tbts amount, the
excess shall belong to th 9 Unitetf States.
And "no State shall, without the consent of
Congress, lay any duty of tooage; keep troops,
or ships of w ir, in time of peace; enter into any
agreement or compact with another State, or
with a foreign power; or engage in war, unless
actually invaded, or in such imminent danger
as will not admit of delay."
in order stili further to secure the uninter
rupted exercise of these high powers against
Stat# interposition, it is provided "that this
Constitution aud the laws of the IJuited States
which shall be inado in purscauoe thereof; and
all treaties made, or which shall be made, un
der the authority of the United States, shall
be the supreme law of the land', and the judges
in every State shall be bound thereby, anything
in the Constitution or laws of aury State to the
contrary notwithstanding."
The solemn sanction of religion has been su
peradded to the obligations of official duty,
and alt Senators and Representatives of the
United States, ail members of State legislatures
sftard all executive and judioial officers, "both of
tbe United States and of the several States,
shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support
this Constitution."
In order to carry into effect these powers the
Constitution has established a perfect Govern
ment in all its forms. Legislative, Executive,
affff Judicial; and this Government, to the ex
tent of its powers, acts directly upon tbe indi
vidual citizens of every State, and executes its
own decrees by tho agency of its own officers.
Iu this respect it differs entirely from the Govs
eruraeut under the old Confederation, which
was confined to making requisitions ou the
States in their sovereign character. This left
it in tbe discretion of each whether to obey or
to refuse, and they often declined to comply
with such requisitions. It thus became neces
sary, for tbe purpose of removing this barrier,
and "in order to form a more perfect Union,"
to establish a Government which could act di
rectly upon the people, and execute its own
laws without tbe intermediate agency of the
States. This has been accomplished by the
Constitution of the United States.
In short, the Government created by ths Con
stitution, and deriving its authority from the
sovereign people of each of the several States,
has precisely tbe same right to exercise its
power over tbe people of all these States, in
enumerated cases, that each one of them
possesses over subjects not delegated to the
Wuited States but "reserved to the States, res
pectively, or to the people."
To the extent of the delegated powers tbe
Ceostitution of the United States is as much a
part of tbe constitution of each State, and ia
as binding upon its people, as though it had
Iwen texnally inserted thereu.
jfPhis Government, therefore, is a great and
pfflNr'ul Government, invested with all tbe at
tributes of sovereignty over the special subjects
to which its authority extends. Its framers
newer intended to implant in its bosom the seeds
of Jt own destruction, nor were they at its
Ration guilty of the absurdity of providing
ar its own dissolution. It was not intended
ej its framers to be the baseless fabric of a
which, at tbe touch of the enchanter,
vanish iuto thin air, but a substantial
mighty fabric, capable of resisting the: alow
decay of tin and of defying the storm* of ages.
iuded, well may the jedous patriots of that
day have indulged fears that a government of
such high powers might violate tho reserved
rights of the States, and wisely did they adopt
the rule of a strict construction of these powers
to preveuc tbe danger! Rut they did not fear,
nor had iboy any reason to imagine, that the
Constitution would ever be so interpreted as to
enable any State, by her own act, and without
the consent of her sister States, to discharge
her people from all or any of their Federal ob
ligations.
It city he asked, then, are the people of the
States without redress against tbe tyrany and
oppression of the Federal Government ? By
no means. The right of resistance on the part
of the governed agaiust the oppression of their
governments cannot be denied. It exists inde
pendently of all constitutions, aud bas beeu
exercised at ail periods of the world's history.
Under it old governments have been destroyed,
and new ones have taken their place. It is
embodied in stroug aud express language in
our own Declaration of Independence. But
tbe distinction must 6ver bo observed, that this
is revolution against au established Govern
ment, and not a voluntary secession from it
by virtue of an inherent oonstitutional right.
In short, let us look tbe danger fairly in the
face. Secession is neither more nor less than
revolution. It may or it may not be justifia
ble revolution, but still it is revolution.
What, in the meantime, is the responsibility
and true position of the Executive? He is
bound by a solemn oath before God and the
country "to take care that the laws be faith
fully executed," and from this obligation be
cannot be absolved by any human power. But
wuat tf the performance of this duty, in whole
or in part, has been rendered impractioabb by
events over which he oould have exercised no
control? Such, at the present moment, is the
ease throughout the State of North Carolina,
so far as the laws of the United States to se
cure the administration of justice by means of
the Federal Judiciary are concerned. All the
Federal officers within its limits, thro' whose
agency alone these laws can be carried into
execution, have already resigned. We have
no longer a district judge, a district attorney,
or a marshal in South Carolina. In fact, the
whole machinery of the Federal Government,
ueeessary for the distribution of remedial jus
tice among the people, has beeu demolished;
and it would be diffioult, if not impossible, to
replace it.
The only acts of Congress on the statute
book, boaring upon this subject, are those of
the 28tb February, 1795, and 3d Maroh, 1807.
These authorize the President, after he shall
have ascertained that the marshal with his
posse comitatus is unable to execute civil or
orimiual process in any particular case, to call
forth the militia and employ the army and navy
to aid him in performing this service, having
first by proclamation commanded the insur
gents "to disperse and retire peaceably to their
respective abodes, withio a limited time."—
This duty cannot by possibility be performed
in a State where no judioial authority exists
to issue process, and where, even it there were
such an officer, toe entire population would
constitute one solid combination to resist him.
The bare enumeration of these provisions
prove how inadequate they are without further
legislation to overcome a united opposition in
a single State, not to speak of other States
who may place themselves in a similar attitude.
Congress alone has power to decide whether
the present lain can or oanuot be amooded so
as to carry out more effectually tbe objects ef
the Constitution.
The same iasupersble obstacles do not He ia
tbe way of executing the laws for tbe collec
tion of the oustoms. The revenue still con
tinues to be collected, as heretofore, at the
custom house at Charleston; and should tho
collector unfortunately resign, a successor may
be appointed to perform tbis duty.
Then ia regard to tho property of the Uni
ted States in South Carolina. This has been
purchased for a fair equivalent, "by the con
sent of the legislature of the State," "for tho
erection of forts, magazines, arsena.s," &c.,
and over those the authority "to exercise ex
clusive legislation," has bocu expressly granted
by the Constitution to Congress. It is not
believed that any attempt will be made to ex
pel the Uoited States from this property by
force; but if ia this I shoal! prove to be mis
taken, tbe officer in command of tbe forts has
received orders to act strictly on tbe defen
sive. In snob a contingency, the responsibili
ty for consequences would rightfully rest upon
tbe heads of the assailants.
Apart from tbe execution of the laws, so far
as this may be practicable, tbe Executive bas
no authority to decide what shall be the rela
tions between tbe Federal Government and
South Carolina. He has been invested with no
such discretion, lie possesses no power to
change the relations heretofore existiug
tween them, much less to acknowledge the in
dependence of that State. Tbis would be to
invest a mere Executive offiocr with tbe power
of recognizing the dissolution of the Confede
racy among our tbirty-three sovereign States.
It bears no resemblance to the roeoenition ot
a foreign de facto government, involving no
such responsibility. Any attempt to do tbis
would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpa
tion. It is, therefore, my daty to submit to
Congress the whole queaviou in all its bear
ing*. The course of events is so rapidly has
tening forward, that the emergency may soon
arise, waen you may be called upon to decide
the momentous quest-ion whether you possess
the power, by force of arms, to compel a State
to remain in tbe Union. I should leel myself
recreant to my duty were I not to express an
opinion ou this important subject.
The question fairly stated is: Has the Con
stitution delegated fo Congress the paweif tn
coerce a State into submission wnicfi aiteutp-lug
to withdraw or has actually withdrawn from
ths Confederacy? If answered in the affirma
tive, it must be on the principle that the power
has been conferred upon Congress to declare
and to make war again. l .t a State. After
much serious reflection 1 have arrived at tho
conclusion that no such power bas been dole
gated to Congress or to any other department
cf the Federal Government. It is manifest
upon an inspection of the Constitution, that
this is cot anioug the specific and enumerated
powers grauted to Congress; aud it is equally
apparent that its exercise is not "necessary
and proper for carrying inti execution" auy
one of these powers. So far from tbis power
haviDg been delegated to Congress, it was ex
pressly refused by the Convention which framed
ibe Constitution.
It appears, from the proceedings of that
body, that on the 31st of May, 1787, the
clause "authorizing au exertion of the force
of the whole against a delinquent State" came
up for consideration. Mr. Madison opposed it
in a brief but powerful speech, from which I
shall extract but a single sentence. He ob
served: "The use of force against a State
would look more like a declaration of war than
an infliction of punishment; aud would proba
bly be considered by the party attacked
as a dissolution of all previous compacts by
whicb it might be bound."
Upon bis motion tbe clause was unanimously
postponed, and was never again 1 believe pre
sented Soou afterwards, on tbe Bth June,
1787, when incidentally adverting to the sub
ject, he said: "Any Government for the Uni
ted States, formed on the supposed practicabil
ity of using force against the unconstitutional
prooeodinga of the States, would provo as vis
ionary and fallacious as the government of
Congress," evidently meaning the then existiug
Congress of tiie old Confederation.
Without descending to particulars, it may
be safely asserted, that tbe power to make war
against a State is at variance with tbe whole
spirit and intent of the Constitution. Suppose
such a war should result ia the conquest of a
State, how are we to govern it afterwards?
Shall we hold it us a proviuoe, and govern it
by despotic power? In the nature of things
we couid not, by physical force, control the
will of the people and compel them to elect
senators aDd representatives to Congress, and
to perform all tbe other duties depending upon
their own volition, and required from the free
citizens of a free State as a constituent mem
ber of the Confederacy.
But, if possessjd of this power, would it be
wise to exerciso it under existing ciroumstanc
es? The objeot would doubtless be to preserve
tbe Union. War would not only present tbe
most effectual meaus of destroying it; but
would banish all hope of its peaceable recoa
construction. Besides, in the fraternal con
flict a vast amount of blood and treasure
would be exapendd, roqderiug future reconcil
iation betweeu tbe States impossible. In tbe
meantime, who can fortell what would be the
suffering and privation of the people during its
existence?
The fact is, that our Union rests upon pub
lic opinion, and oan never be cemented by the
blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it
cannot live in the affeotions of tbo peopie, it
must cue day perish. Congress possesses many
means of preserving it by conciliation; but the
sword was uot placed iu their hands to pre
serve it by force.
But i may be permitted solemnly to invoke
my countrymen to pause and deliberate, be
fore they determine to destroy this, the graud-

est temple which has ever been dedicate J t®
human freedom sinee the world began! It h*
been consecrated by the blood of oar fathers,
by the glories of the past, and by the hopes of
the future. Tbo Union has already made o
the most prosperous, and, era long, will, if
preserved, render us the most powerful oatioo
on the face of the earth. In every foreign le
gion of the globe the title of Aoaerieen >Sttkr
Sen is held fi the highest twfwjf;rrtd 'tiftco
pronounced in a foreign inb'i it causes toe
hearts of our countrymen to swell with honest
pride. Surely when wo reach the brink of the
yawning abyss, we shall recoil with horror
from the last fatal plunge. By such a dread
oatastropbe the hopes of the friends of free
dom throughout the world would be destroyed,
and a long night of despotism wouid enshroud
the nations. Our example for more than eigh
ty years would not only be lost, but would be
quoted as a conclusive proof that man is uudt
for self government.
It is not every wrong—nay, it is not every
grievous wrong—which can justify a resort to
such a fearful alterna-.ive. This ought to be
t'ae last desperate remedy of a despairing peo
ple, after every other constitutional means of
conciliation had been exhausted. We should
reflect that under this free government there
is an incessant ebb and flow in pobhc opinion.
The slavery question, like everything human,
will have its day. 1 firmly believe that it has
already reached and passed toe culminating
point. But if in the midst of the existing ex
citement, the Union shall perish, the evil may
then bcooine irreparable. Congress can con
tribute much to avert it by proposing and re
commending to the Legislatures of the several
States tbo remedy for existing evils, wbioh the
Constitution has itself provided for its own
preservation. This has been tried at different
critical periods of our history, and always witn
eminent success. It is to be found in tbo fifth
article providing for its own amendment. —
Under this article amendments have been pro
posed by two thirds of both Houses of Con-
gress and have been "ratified by the Legisla
tures of three fourths of the several States,"
and consequently become parts of the Constitu
tion: To this process the country is indebted
for the clause prohibiting Cotigrcia from pas
sing any law respecting the establishment of
religion, or abridging the freedom of speech,
o.' um pvisa, cr of the right ef petition.—
To this we are also indebted for tbe Bill of
Eights which secures the people against any
abuse of power by the Federal Government.
Such were the apprehensions justly entertaiued
by the friends of States rights at that period
as to have rendered it extremely doubtful
whether tbe Coastitutiou could have long sur
vived without these ammdmrnti.
Again, the Constitution was amended by the
same process after the election of President
Jefferson by the House of .Representatives, in
February, 18G3~ Tois amendment was ren
dered necessary to prevent a reourrsnce of the
dangers which had seriously threatened the
existence of the Government during the pen
dency of that election- The article tor its
own amendment was intended to secure tae
auiieabie adjustment of conflicting constitution
al questions Ukte the present, which might
arise between the governments of the States
and that of the United States. This appears
from contemporaneous history.
in this connection, 1 shall merely call at
tention to a few sentences in Mr. Madison's
justly celebrated report, in 1799, to the legis
lature of Virginia, in this bo ably and con
clusively defended the resolutions of the pre
ceding legislature against the strictures of sev
eral other State Legislatures. These were
mainly founded upon the protest of the Vir
ginia legislature against the ' Alien and Sedi
tion Acts," as "palpable and alarming infrac
tions of the Constitution." la pointing out
the peaceful aud constitutional remedies, and
ne reterred to none other, to which the States
were authorized to resort, ou such occasions,
he concludes by saying, "that the legislatures
of tue States might have made a direct repre
sentation to Congress with a view to obtain the
rescinding of the two offensive acts, or tbey
might have represented to their respective
Senator :u Congress their wish that two-thirds
thereof would propose an explanatory amend
ment to the Constitution, or two-thirds of
themselves, if such bad beea their option,
migat, by an application to CoDgre9 a, have
obtained a convention for the same object."*
Tuie is me very course which 1 earnestly re
commeud in order to obtain an "explanatory
amendment" of the Constitution on the sub
ject of slavery. This might originate with Con
gress or tiie State Legislatures, as tnty be
deemed most advisable to attain the object.
The explanatory amendment might be con
fined to the final settlement of the true con
struction of the Constitution or three special
points :
1. Aa express reoegnition of the right of
propertj iu slaves in the States where it now
exists or may hereafter exist.
2. the duty of proteoung this right io all
the cuuiuiou territories throughout their ter
ritorial existence, and until they shall be ad
mitted as States into the Union, with or with
out slavery, as their constitutions may pre
scribe.
3. A like recognition ef the right of the
master to have his slave, who has escaped from
oue State to restored and "delivered
up" to him, and of the validity of the fugitive
slave law enacted for this purpose, together
with a declaration that ail State laws impairing
or defeating this right are violations rf the
Constitution, and are consequently null and
VOld.
It may be objected that this oenstruotion of
the Constitution has already been settled by
the Supreme Court of the United States, and
what more ought to be required. The answer
is, that a very large proportion ef the people
of the United States still contest the correctness
