upondent at Madrid; ?
Madbed, Dec. 6, 1873.
THE SITUATION GRAVE.
The Cuban question again wears a grave
aspect here.
HINISTEB SICKLES RESIGNS.
General Sickles to-day tendered his resig
nation of the Ministry to Spain to Secretary
Fish.
CAUSE Of THE RETIREMENT.
This act has been decided on by the General
in consequence of a disagreement which has
arisen during the progress of the complication
with Spain. A strong misunderstanding has
existed for some time, it is believed. Dur
ing the recent negotiations Secretary Fish
acted directly with Sefior Castclur, ignoring
Minister Sickles. Secretary Fish also disap
proved of the imperative tone of Minister
Sickles' correspondence with the Spanish
government.
The Secretary of State aud the Minister
have had frequent disagreements before this,
almost amounting to a rupture, on the occa
sion of the correspondence attending the
remand of Bi dwell, the Bank of England
forger, from Havana, and also during the Dr.
Houard case.
HOW TnK ??TTI,KU?.VT WA8 MADE.
When Secretary Fish ignored Minister
Sickles, and dealt directly with the Spanish
Minister, it is said generally in diplomatic cir
cles that the good offices of Mr. Layard, the
English Minister, accomplished a settlement.
TOO MANY CONCESSIONS FOR SICKLES.
Now, ar. Secretary Fish proposes further
concessions, Minister Sickles resigns.
COOL a TUN DEMANDS.
The Cuban authorities demand that the
Virginius be sent, at the direction of Sefior
Boler, the Colonial Minister at present in
Cuba, to some port of Spain or l'orto Bieo,
there to await the result of arbitration.
CASTELAB'h GOVERNMENT IN DANGER.
The opposition to the government of Custe
lar is culminating. There is a crisis in the
Cabinet.
TUB SPANISH PRESS ON THE MESSAGE.
The whole Spanish press indignantly pro
tests against tho tone of President Grant's
Message, and denounces it as an imperti
nent interference in the affairs of Cuba, and
that it is really none of the President's
business.

The following despatches to the New Yore
TTrwAi.n has been received from onr special
correspondent in Havana: ?
Havana, via Key West, Pec. 5, 1873.
The Spaniards here are greatly incensed at
the demands of the United States. The volun
teers talk of proclaiming war to the knife.
They will refuse to submit to the orders of the
Madrid government to surrender the Virginius,
or to any such decree of the Madrid govern
ment.
WAR THREATENED,
War is regarded as imminent, and the popu
lar cry is that Spain will succor Cuba and
DEFY AMERICA.
News that America would not press ber
claim for the surrender of the Virginius has
been received. It is read on the streets and
hailed with cheers by the populace.
Subsequent instructions from Madrid order
ing the surrender of the Yirginius caused the
wildest indignation. Crowds on the street
cry out, "We will

attempt was made to burn the Virginius. This

sent on board to protect ber.
THE DONS* DIO TALK.
Last night there was a meeting at the Palace,
which lasted for ten hours. It was attended
by the principal Spaniards and a large num
ber of army and navy officers. Castelar was
much abused. He was threatened with hang
ing. Resolutions were passed declaring that
Cuba would not submit to the surrender of the
Virginius, but would
FIUHT TO THE DEATH.
Great joy is felt that the American demands
do not involve the abolition of slavery. Al
though there is a general disposition to resist
compliance with the demands of the United
States, great depression i? felt on account of
Castelar's acquiescence.
NERVOUS ABOUT THE FLEET.
There is ft growing fear that the American
fleet may come from Key West to receive the
Virginias, in which case a general uprising is
threatened. On Sunday last a dinner was
given in the cabin of the Virginias. It was
attended by officials, editors and army and
navy officers. Sjjeechea were made expressing
confidence in the ability of the volunteers to
BOLD THKIB OWN AGAINST THE WORLD,
despite the abandonment of the Madrid gov
ernment.
The bitterness felt against Americans has
greatly increased, bo that their lives are
felt to be in danger. The American Consulate
is still quietly guarded by the troops.
PON QUIXOTE ON HIS HOBBV HOUSE.
The Diario of this date entreats all Spaniards
to die a thousand deaths rather than submit
to disgraceful concessions, and says:?"The
accounts we have just traced leave our pen
like bitter tears from deeply wounded hearts,
but yet we know that we are Spaniards. Peril
does not frighten nor sacrifices deter us."
The Voz de 0Mba rejects all concessions, and
says "that the American demands must not
be allowed to compromise the honor of Spain ;
that the pretentiousness of the United States
has been greatly mod ifled by the bravery of
Spain."
MADRID MENACES THE CASINO.
Despatches have been received from the
War Minister at Madrid stating that if tho
Spanish Cubans do not obey orders they will
be considered intransigentes and treated
accordingly. In replw the Casino Espaflol
declares that
THE VIROINIU8 WILL NOT BE GIVEN OP.
Preparations are to be made lor war; the
negroes are to bo armed and everything
destroyed rather than yield to the hated Yan
kees. The noble Spaniards of Cuba will go
down with their flag flying without waiting
to be swamped by diplomacy. Fifteen thou
sand copies of the Eco de Cuba were sent to
Spain with the following leading paragraph: ?
"Let our brothers in both hemispheres under
stand that the Virginias cannot be delivered
up. Rather than surrender her we will go
down with the flag of Spain flying over the
Virginius. The Spaniards in Spain must
understand that this is

No Surrender?Spanish Dignity To Be
Upheld at Whatever Cost*
Havana, Via Key West, Dec. 5, 1873.
Latest and second despatch from Cuba to
day describes the popular feeling as growing
more bitter. Branch Casinos have been
established in the principal cities. From the
aristocrat to the dock laborer all say that
THE VIRGINIUS MUST NOT BB DELIVERED UP.
They point to her in the harbor and say
that if the Americans want her they must
take her. Morro Castle, they say, can con
centrate 1,000 guns on an approaching ship.
The marines will refuse to obey any order
to surrender the Virginius. The cry is
"Death, but no surrender!"
SPANISH DIGNITY COMPROMISED,
Tke Spaniards told Minister Soler last night
that his present directions from Madrid com
promised Spanish dignity, and that to be pat
riotic they must refuse to obey. They say
hotter honor without ships than ships without
honor. Many naval officers have sent their
names to the Minister of Marine, intimating
that if the steps they oppose be taken they
wish to be relieved from service.
CA8TELAR IS BITTERLY DENOUNCED.
The reported resignation of the General of
Marine and the Captain General is untrue.
PRUDENCE LEADS THE VAN.
The Volunteer Council has just concluded
its sitting, and has come to the decision to
surrender the Virginius and the remaining
prisoners to a neutral Power, her future dis
position to be settled by arbitration. No
reliance can be placed on what the Council
decides, as the volunteers will act on wild
impulse.
Getting Ready Privateers?War Fever

Havana, Via Key West, Dec. 5, 1873.
The assembly of commercial houses at
Cieufuegos has resolved to buy steamers and
fit tbcm out as privateers in case war should
be declared.
Don Ramon Herrera, Colonel of the Fifth
battalion of volunteers, and owner of one of
the steamship lines, offers six first class steam
ers and all his wealth. Two other steamers
are offered by Cienfuegos merchants. An
immense mass meeting of Spaniards is beiDg
organized for next week.
B0MBASTE8 COOLING DOWN.
The high war fever of last night has cooled
off. The Captain General says he thinks that
all trouble can be avoided by sending the Vir
ginias to Spain, and having her delivered
there to the United States. He has sent tele
grams to that effect to Madrid. Delay is
greatly desired by the Captain General.
THE DONS TOUCH NO MORE THE LIOHT GCITAE.
In view of the imminence of war the Voz de
Cuba to-day approves of the postponement of
the ball at the Casino.
80LEH RETIRES.
The Voz also reports the resignation of the
Minister of Ultramar. The statement, how
ever, has not been confirmed.
THE REPUBLIC IN DANGEB.
Great bitterness is felt against Castelar. It
is said that the populace will be pacified by
the proclamation of a government of assur

the United States ship Wyoming and the Brit

Virginius people on the 4th in?t. Bembstta

THE ASSASSINATION.
The four men shot knelt outside of the
wall of the slaughter house. Ten muskets
were fired at each one of tho condemned, at
only two yards distance. The bodies were
carted off and dumped into a grave together.
TIIE DONS SCABED BY THE BMTIHHER8.
Captain Fry and 36 of the crew of the Vir
ginius were ordered to be Bhot on the 8th, but
were executed on the 7th, because a telegram
arrived here notifying the English Consul that
the English war vessel Niobe had left King
ston lor this port. The Niobe did not arrive
on the 7th, and 12 of the Cubans were exe
cuted on the following morning.
SPANISH BAILOE8 SHOOT CAPTAIN FBY.
The sailors of the Tornado were compelled
to shoot Captain Fry and his crew, but fired
with averted heads, inflicting frightful tor
tures on the condemned. The bodies were
carted off to the cemetery and thrown into the
graves, six persons in each, clothes and all.
THE ENGLIBH PBOTEST AGAINST EXECUTIONS.
The Niobe arrived in the afternoon of the
8th and a verbal protest was made. A protest
was also made by the English Commodore De
Horsey, of the steamer Danae.
GUSHING DENOUNCES THE MASSACBE.
Commander Cushing had an interview with
Governor Burriel and denounced the pro
ceedings. Burriel sent an impertinent answer,
saying that the killing of the Modocs made
the world wonder.
THE DUTCH EB ESCAPES.
Burriel fled to Havana last week. General
Morales de los ltios has been appointed as
his substitute. An uneasy state of feeling is
prevailing among the people in the city. They
are afraid to converse on the subject of the
executions. There are many Cuban sym
pathizers here under cover of volunteers. They
are forced to do duty.
INSURGENT ATTACK EXPECTED.
An attack on Santiago de Cuba by the
rebels is soon expected. November 30, 1873,
immediately on the arrival of the Juniata,
Commander Braine, accompanied by Com
mander Cuuhing, Vice-Consul Sclimitt, Lieu
tenants De Long, Clipp and Hutchings, and
your correspondent, had an interview with
General Morales de los Rios, the substitute of
the runaway BurrieL The interview lasted
some time and was rather of a stormy nature.
BEGGING FOB THE SURRENDER OF OUR CITIZENS.
Commander Braine suggested that the 19
survivors of the Virginias crew should be
surrendered and put on board the Juniata.
This request was politely declined on the
grounds that General Morales had no power
to act. The demand of Commander Braine
to see the survivors was granted, At the con
clusion of the interview Commander Braine
handed General Morales a protest, pointing
out the violation of international law and the
outrage committed in the capture of the Vir
ginias, which he denounced in appropriate
language. The protest closed with a demand
to sec the official record setting forth the
names, nationality and occupation of the
prisoners now incarcerated.
LIST OF AMERICAN PRISONERS.
The prisoners were visited and questioned.
Thirteen in all claimed American citizenship: ?
Henry Knight, Charles A. Knight, engineers,
Greenwich street, New York; William Wilson,
Alfred Parker, mariners, Baltimore;
Edward Scott, tinsmith, Salem, N. J.;
Leopold Riz, lawyer, New Orleans; Arthur
Rivera, machinist, Hudson street, New York;
Henry Cavallo, Second avenue, New York;
Philip Meitzler, cigar maker, Ch:irleston, S.
C.; Raymond Aidiamos, dentist, New York;
Manuel Memsis, Philadelphia; Silberro Es
carel, New Orleans; Francis V. Tapia, Hous
ton street, New York. The prisoners were
wretchedly clothed, baretooted, and gave evi
dences of deep privation. They had no
means of keeping themselves clean. They
lacked sufficient food, and there was only one
tab for washing, in the prisoners' yard, for 100
men. The prisoners were deprived ot clothing
by their captors.
THE TK1A1. FARCE.
The trial of the prisoners lasted only 10
minutes. They could not understand what
it was about, as they were asked, no questions
and said nothiug. The remaining six prison
ers did not cluirn American citizenship, and
wo were not permitted to see them. Subse
quently the captives were allowed better food
and fitting apparel.
AMERICAN OFFICERS EXPOSED TO INSULT.
The feeling here is very bitter, and officers
in uniform are linble to insult from the brutal
volunteers. Tho latest intelligence from
Manzanillo states that the prisons are full of
women and children. Another attack by the
Cubans is expected. A forced loan by tho
Governor of $20,000 has been raised for de
fence. The inhabitants are fleeing.

Havana, Via Kev West, Dee. 5, 187.*?.
The city continues quiet.
The feeling on the question of tho delivery
of the Virginias has undergone a considerable
change since yesterday. Many Spaniards are
now in favor of an immediate quiet delivery of
the Virgiuius to the United States authorities,
as a contrary course would place them in open
rebellion against the government of Spain.
volunteers in oounol.
The leading officers of the volunteers held
a meeting this morning at the residence of
Sefior Zulueta, the President of the Casino
Espafiol. Sefior Zulueta subsequently in
formed an American gentleman that the
Virginius would be delivered quietly.
FRIENDLY ADVICE.
It is reported that Sefior Zulueta has re
ceived a telegraphic despatch from Sefior
Calvo, the representative at Madrid of the
Oasino Espafiol, counselling the delivery of the
Virginius, and saying that Spain will after
wards claim $100,000,000 damages from the
government of the United States.
TAKING IN THEIR HORNS.
A proposal to send the Virginius to Spain
and there turn her over to an American man
of-war is received with favor by the Spaniards.
New battalions of volunteers are forming.
RURIUEL'b BUTCHERIES OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED.
United States naval officers at Santiago de
Cuba report officially that the number of men
captured on the Virginius was 155.
FIFTY-THREE WERE EXECUTED.
Of the 102 survivors 14 arc natives or nat

Mr. Fish is represented to be strong in the belief
that the terms of the protocol between Adpiiral

NO CHANGE AT MADRID.
No conUrmatiou or the rumor that the govern
ment at Madrid was endeavoring to change the
protocol itself has been obtained thus far. On the
contrary, the assurance that the present negotia
tion is one of delay only, in executing the actual
delivery, is repeated to-night with mucli insistence.
NO NEWS FROM CUBA.
There nave been no official reports from Havana
to-day of a character to produce additional dis
quietude. If anything, the situation is regarded as
more favorubte to the prospects of an entirely
peaceful end oi the troubles connected with the
Virglnius.
GAIN BT DELAY.
A little delay, it Is explained in well informed
circles, is a mutual advantage. II Spain is not
ready to make delivery of the vessel accordlrg to
agreement, the United States are hardly prepared
to take forcible possession, lor the moment, but
will be in a very short time.
THE WORK FOR WAR GROWING.
Since publicity bas been given In these de

give a wide scope to any armed Intervention It

Cabinet in directing compliance with the terms of
the protocol leads peopte irresistibly to the c< 1
clnsion that Spain is not in a position to accord t'.to
concessions which her representative at Washing
ton agreed to in her behalf. The peoplo
looked upon that protocol as granting to tin*
government less than the meed of reparation
which was Its due, and they firmly believe now,
that if this meagre measure of redress cannot be
complied with, the only remedy will be the resort!'
to war. And this public view seems to be very
materially strengthened by tne action of the gov

to meet such a contingency. .
Outside of all the original cause for hostilities aref
the recent facts that will necessitate It in the res-j

argue, as Mr. Fish would doubtless do, that 'peace

AT TUB CI lt.tN HEADQUARTERS
In Exchange place the Amlgos do Cuba were very
busv yesterday, and there was a great deal of busi
ness ol importance being transacted. All the lead
ing members uf the executive committee were
present and were engaged in conncll lor nearly
four hours.
During the afternoon the Conference Committee
appointed at tiie Herman war mass meeting re
cently held at (ieriuania Hull, called npon the Ex
ecutive Committee aud was in private conference
with them for some time. The committee consisted
ol ex-Alderman William ICadde. 8. Bromborg and
Henry Hertz. They declined to state, for the pres
ent, the nature of the subjects discussed.
In reference to the expedition which was an
nounced in one of yesterday's papers as being
fitted out and almost ready for departure, the
members of the Junta, including Secretary Arteaga
and General Jourdan. deny all knowledge of the
enterprise or of any of the pat ties connected witti
it. Indeed, they look upon it as being
ENTIRELY MYTHICAL,
or as the vaporing of some individual who it'
emulous of acquiring some little cheap notoriety.
General Jourdan also staled with great frankness
that so far as he was aware the report that tho
schooner A. W. smith, which left Eli/.abethport on
Thursday, was carrying coal for a privateer, to be
met somewhere off the coast, was also erroueous.
Quite early In the day a report gained some cir
culation that the steamship City of Merida, com
manded by Captain Timweriuun, of the Havana
and Mexican mail line, was having her decks
strengthened so as to
MOUNT A COUPLE OP OCNS,
forward, in the event of any attempts at privateer
ing by the Casino Kspafiol or the doughty Colonel
Jimlnez, of Havana, who is said to have offered to
lit out six privateers at his own expense. The
rumor, however, was entirely without foundation,
and if the City of Merida over meets with a privateer
she Is a very fast vessel and will trust to the power
ol Iter engines aud thu brains of her gentlemanly
and skilful commander.
There lias lately oeen some talk among the
"Hessian" element of the American people, who
have all along during this controversy been trying
to invalidate the justice of the American demands
against Spain, to the effect that a largr share ol
the interest displayed by many people in the Cnbau
cause was due to the
POTENT INFLUENCE OP CUBAN BONDS,
which, according to their theories, have been lav
ishly "placed where they would do most good."
Among others, .Senator Poland lias so insisted
quite recently.
General Jordan yesterday informed the reporter,
that ne had personal knowledge that all these in
sinuations of bribery are the veriest bosh. Ho
stated that he knows that there were but
$4,000,000 of these bonds Issued under authority of
the Congress of the Cuban hepublic, all of which
were signed by Sefior MoralesLcmns. These have'
nearly all been disposed of?at least three-fourth*
of the whole issue?to Cubans themselves, tho
proceeds of the sales being devoted to the causo
of the revolution, in purchasing vessels, forward
lug supplies of
MEN, ARMS AND MEDICINES,
and were sold at from 50 to 35 per cent of their par
value. It wilt therefore be very readily seen that
all this talk about bribery or "boud lufliunoi' is
unfounded, nnless men can be bought very cheaply;
for the total issue of bonds has not realized more
than $1,000,000 cash, and this has been expended
as above described, in the fltt.ng out of not less
than five or six expeditions. As they have sold at
such low rates of discount, and as purchasers havo
not always been available, he thinks their influence
would not be so very potent among American
statesmen, and the fact Is they have nearly
ail passed into the hands of the Cubans themselves,
whose chief faith npon the valne of the securities is
based upon their hopes and yearnings tor the dual
deliverance of their country.
