The message of the President was de
livered to Congress yesterday. It proved
to be a very lengthy document, but not !
apparently unnecessarily so. Believing
that it* fall text would attract a less num
ber of readers than a condensed form, tho
Record-Union has, with great pains,
digested the less important portions of
the message, while presenting all the
other parts in full. We belie\ c that there
is thus given to our readers a far more
readable and satisfactory form of tho
message thau if we had printed all of its
parts '• No subject has been
omitted, no statement, or conclusion,
recommendation or suggestion made by
the President has been stricken out —wo
give the whole message, indeed, having
simply condensed portions that the docu
ment might invite wider reading because
of its greater brevity.
The President opens his message by
commending to Congress the reports of
the heads of departments.
FOREIGN KKLATIONS.
While our foreign relations have not at
all times during the year been entirely
free from perplexing and embarrassing
situations, nothing remains that will not
yield to a spirit of fairness and love of
justice, which, joined with consistent
lirmiH'ss, characterizes a truly American
loreign policy.
SOUTH AMERICA.
The Argentine and Brazilian boundary
ation is still pending. In the Brazil
ian rebellion American interests have
uefully protected. The insurgents
have no claim as yet to recognition as
belligerents. We maintain the fixed
policy of impartial neutrality in Brazil.
A Chums Commission has been erected
for settlement of the demands of (.'bile
and the United States against eacii other.
DOCTRENK OF LEGATION ASYU'.M.
question of "Legation Asylum" j
for offenders against the State audits!
laws was presented anew in Chile by tiie
unauthorized action of the late United
Slates Minister in his receiving into
ricial residence two persons who hail failed
in attempt at revolution, and against
whom criminal charges were pending
grow ing out of a former abortive disturb
ance.
The doctrine of asylum as applied to
this case is sanctioned by the best prece
dent, and when allowed tends to encour
age sedition and strife. Under no cir
cumstances can tho representative of this
Government be permitted, under the ill
denned iictiou of extra territorialty, to
interrupt tho administration of criminal
justice in the countries to which they
are accredited.
THE REGISTRATION OK CHINESE,
The legislation requiring the registra
tion of Chinese laborers entitled to resi
dence here and tho deportation of all not
complying, met with much opposition
from <*hinamen acting upon the advice of
counsel. The great mass of Chinese
laborers, pending judicial inquiry as to
its validity, in good faith declined to ap
ply for their certificates. A test upon
proceeding by habeas corpus was brought
before the Supreme Court, and a decision
was made sustaining the law.
it is believed that under the new Regis
tration Act the Chinese desiring to re
side here will register aud avoid forced
deportation.
RKFARATIOX.
A demand for reparation has been
pressed upon China by the United States
Minister, as Dean of the diplomatic body,
for the murder of Swedish missionaries
Bg-Pu. It involves a question of
vital interest to all countries having citi
zens engaged in missionary work.
Tin-; SLAVS ti:.vi»k.
The Congo States and adjacent States,
the United States and other siguatory
powers, agreed by the treaty of Krusseis
m 18SW to employ means to punish those
■ 11 ammunition to 1 the natives and
to confiscate the inhibited articles. Cou
;s therefore asked to pass an Act]
prohibiting our citizens from selling arms
ox liquor to natives in the regulated zone.
I A Hl'.-A —KXTRAIUTION\
Costa Rica has shown its friendliness to
up by surrendering fugitives irotn justice
without an extradition treaty. A
treaty to meet future cases is advised.
Treaties for reciprocal relations should
he concluded with ail those countries
with which tiie United States has not al
dv oonventional arrangements of that
character. The President has expressed
in Costa Kica and Colombia the kindly
rlpsireof the United States to see their
Sending boundary dispute finally closed j
by arbitration, m conformity with the
spirit of the treaty between them.
■ i;\N«K— CKKMANY.
Our relations with the French Republic
continue to be intimate and cordial. The
extradition treaty with France, as
Amended by the Senate, should be ope
raWhile occasional questions affecting
our naturalized citizens returning to their
birth-land have arisen with Germany,
our rations with that country continue
aatisiaL-tory.
THE RECORD-UNION.
Questions affecting our relations with ■
< ;r. at Britain have been treated in a spirit
of friendliness* Negotiations are in pro- ■
jivca- between tiie two Governments for
concurrent action to make the award and
regulations agreed to by the Behnn
Tribunal of Arbitration practically effect
ive. It is not dout ted that Great Britain
will co-operate freely with us for the ac- \
complisLmentof that purpose.
The dispute growintr out of the dis- ;
criminating tolls imposed in the Welland
Canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to
and from the lake ports of the United
was adjusted by die substitution ol \
a more equitable seedule of charges, and
President Harrison thereupon suspended ;
his proclamation imposing discriminat
ing tolls upon British transit through our
canal.
Requests for additions to the list of ex- i
traditable offenses covered by the exist
ing troaty between the two countries is
under consideration.
HA VTI.
Ilayti lias paid us indemnity for
the protracted imprisonment of an
American citizen in that country on a j
charge of smuggling, liayti requires I
duty payment on discharged cargoes, be
fore giving a ship clearance. This works
a hardship on American shipowners.
The Tinted States insists upon removal
ol this causo of complaint.
SEIZURE OF PASSENGERS ON AKERICAN
£ nil's.
An American mail steamer touching at
Amapula was tired on, because the Cap- j
tain refused to deliver to tho Honduras J
military authorities a passenger in transit
from Nicaragua to Guatemala. The j
United States at once protested and de- j
inanded satisfaction, wherefore liondu- |
ras disavowed the illegal conduct of its
oflicers and expressed its regret.
INSURGENT SEIZURES.
It is confidently anticipated that a satis
iactory adjustment will soon be reached
of the questions arising out of the seizure
and use of American vessels by insur
gents in Honduras, and the subsequent
denial by the successful Government of
commercial privileges to those vessels on
that account.
FRANCE AND LIBERIA.
A part of the southeast coast of Liberia I
between the Cavally aud San Pedro Ki\
ers, for nearly halt a century has been
conceded generally to belong to Liberia.
It has been claimed to bo under French
protectorate by virtue of agreements with
native tribes, over whom Liberia's con
trol has not been well maintained, id -
eently the two republics adjusted the
matter by treaty, and Liberia ceded to
France certain of the former's territory.
But the Liberian Legislature has not rat
ified the in aty. '1 he United States, feel
ing an interest in the fortunes of little
Liberia, so largely due to American ben
evolence, has suggested to France our
earnest concern lest territorial impair
ment in Liberia should take place With
out her unconstrained consent.
MEXICO.
Our relations with Mexico continue to
be of a close and friendly nature. The
work of boundary relocation from l'aso
jDel Norte to the Pacific is nearly com
pleted, and the commission to setuo dis
putes relative to the shifting currents of
the Rio Grande east of El Taso will
speedily adjust such matters.
NICARAGUAN REVOLUTIONS AND CANAL.
Nicaragua has recently passed through
two revolutions. Our Minister, by bis
timely good efforts, aided in a peaceful
adjustment of the controversy involved
in the first conflict. The large American
interests established in that country, in
connection with tho Nicaragua Canal,
wen- not molested.
The canal company has become finan
cially embarrassed, but Nicaragua has
extended generous treatment to it. We
are so especially interested in the sue-
I achievement of the vast under
taking this company has in charge twat it
should be accomplished under distinct
ively American auspices, and its enjoy
ment assured, not only to the vessels of
tliis country as a channel of commercial
communication between our Atlantic and
Pacific seaboards, but to the ships of the
world, iv the interests of civilization.
GUATEMALA —NORWAY —RUSSIA.
Guatemala has had political troubles
also, but the proclamation oi a dictator
ship has not been attended by civil war.
Extradition treaties with Russia and
Norway have been proclaimed.
BAMOAN MATTERS.
I>esiring the restoration of order in Sa
moa, the United states, departing from
its policy consecrated by a century of ob
servance, entered four years ago into the
treat;*" of Berlin, becoming jointly bound
with England and Germany to establish
and maintain Malietoa Lanapopa as King
of Samoa.
The treaty provided for a foreign court
of justice, a Municipal Council for the
district of Apia, with a foreign President
thereof, authorized to advise the King;
a tribunal for the settlement of native
and foreign hind titles, and a revenue
system for tho kingdom.
"it entailed upon the three Powers that
part of the cost of the new Government
not met by tho revenue of the islands.
Early in tho life of this triple protectorate
the native dissensions it was designed to
quell, revived; rivals defied the authority
of the new King, refusing to pay taxes
and demanding the election of a ruler by
native Buffrage.
Mataata, an aspirant to the throne, and
a large number of his native adherents
were in open rebellion on one of the
islands quite lately. At the request of
the other Towers, and in fulfillment of its
treaty obligation, this < iovernment agreed
to unite in a joint military movement of
such dimensions as would probably se
cure the surrender of the insurgents
without bloodshed.
The warship Philadelphia was accord
ingly put under orders for Samoa, but be
fore" she arrived the threatened conflict
was precipitated by Mataafa'a attack
upon the opposing camp. Mataafa was
(leieated and a number of men killed.
The British and German vessels present
subsequently secured the surrender of
Mataaf.i and his adherents.
The defeated chiet and ten of his prin
cipal supporters were deported to an
island of the Marshal group, where tinw
are held as prisoners under the joint re
sponsibility and cost of tho three Powers.
no entangling: alliances—spa in.
This incident and tne events haling
up to it, signally illustrate the impolicy
of entanyiiug alliances with loreijjn
powers.
More than fifteen j-ears ago we pre
ferred a claim against Spain for property
of a citizen seized and confiscated in
Cuba. In l>B'i tho claim was adjusted,
Spain agreeing to pay unconditionally
$i,500,00ft A respectful but earnest note
v. as recently addressed to the Spanish
iiment insisting upon prompt !ui
fillinentoi its long neglected obligation.
i >ihor claims for our citizens have been
pending against Spain many years. By
the Caroline islands arbitration Spain
agreed to recognize the acquired rights of
American missionaries in the islands. It
is hoped this will lead to speedy allow
ance of the return of our missionaries
who were removed from Ponape for safety
by a United States war ship during the
late troubles between Spain and the
natives. Congress should thank S[ain
for the presence of tho reproduced caravel
Santa Maria.
TURKISH MISDEEDS.
The firing by a mob of the school
buildings of a college established by
Americans at Marzovau, Turkey, and the
apparent indillerence of Turkey to the
outrage, though some of its oilicials were
implicated, cailed for our earnest remon
strance. Turkey promised reparation,
punishment of the ofrksials, indemnity
for the injury, permission to rebuild and
guarantee of protection to the American
own.
inoffensive American woman mission
aries were maltreated in Turkish Kor
distan. The United States protected and
tho Porte issued orders for punishment of
of their assailants, the removal of a delin
quent official, aud protection of American
i missionaries. J
SACRAMENTO, TUESDAY 3It>I!XIXGr, DECEMBER 5, 1593.
!
Tin: BIGHT 10 Kxri.ruF.
Turkey complains that her Armenian
subjects come to the United States and
become citizens, not in good faith, but j
with intention to return and eimage in
sedition. The complaint is not wholly
without foundation. An Armenian jour
nal published in this country openly
counsels its readers to arm and aid subver
sion of Turkish authority. Turkey de
clares its intention to expel Armenians
who have become United States citi/ons
since ,
"The ritfht to exclude any or all classes
of aliens is an attribute of sovereignty.
It is a right asserted and to a limited ex
tent enforced by the United States with
the sanction of our highest courts."
Hut our Minister has been instructed,
as we have uu naturalization treaty with i
Turkey, to recognize the right of Turkey
to enforce its policy; but he is to protect
these Armenian-Americana from unnec
essary harshness of treatment.
VKNKZI XI.A.
Venezuela being financially embar
rassed, we have agreed she may pay our
claims in installments. Venezuela and
Great Britain are advised to arbitrate the
boundary dispute relative to the line be
tween Venezuela and British Guinea.
Ratification of the convention lor arbitra
tion ot the claim ol' the Venezuela Trans- \
portatiou Company is awaited.
THE HAWAIIAN MATTER.
The questions arising from our rela- ■
tions with Hawaii have caused Berious ]
embarrassment. Just prior to the in
stallation oi' the present Administration j
the existing Government of Hawaii bad I
been suddenly overthrown and a treaty
of annexation negotiated with the Provi
sional Government and submitted to the !
■ ite.
This treaty 1 withdrew lor examina
tion and dispatched Hon. James F.
Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a
special Commissioner to make an impar- ■
tial investigation of the circumstances at- !
tending the change of Government and'
of all the conditions bearing upon t;:e
t of the treaty.
■ a thorough and exhaustive exam
ination, Mr. Blount submitted to me his
[ report showing beyond all question thut j
| the constitutional Government of Hawaii
| hud been subverted with the active aid of
our representative to that Government,
aud through intimidation caused by the
presence of an armed naval force of the I
United States which was landed for that
purpose at the instance of our Minister,
Upon tiie facts developed, it seemed to
mo the only honorable course for our
Government to pursue was to undo tho
wrong that hail been done by those rep
resenting us, and to restore as far as prac
ticable the status existing at tho time of
our forcible intervention.
With a view of accomplishing this re
sult within tho constitutional limits of
the executive power and recognizing all
our obligations and responsibilities grow
ing out of any changed conditions brought
about by our unjustifiable interference,
our present Minister at Honolulu has re
ceived appropriate instructions to that
end.
Thus far no information of the accom
plishment of any detinue results has
been received from him. Additional ad
vices are soon expected. When received
they will promptly be sent to Congress,
together with all other information at
hand, accompanied by a special Execu
tive message fully detailing the acts nec
essary to a complete understanding of the
c:tst>, and presenting a history of all the
material events leading up to the present
situation.
ARBITRATION.
Relative to negotiations with other na
tions with a view to arranging a system
of arbitration for settlement of disputes,
as requested by Congress in February,
1890, the President says that the Interna
tional American Conference cxp
the wish that all controversies between
American republics and European na
tions be settled by arbitration and such
wish was ordered communicated to tiie
nations.
A favorable response lias been received
from Oreat Britain in tliu form of a I'ar
liamentary resolution of sympathy with
the desiro and advising the Queen's Gov
ernment to co-operato with tho United
Mates to that end.
The President congratulates the coun
try on this action by Great Britain aud
the United States, and warmly indorses
arbitration for the settlement of quarrels.
Congress is informed of tho raising oi
certain Ministers to the rank of Einbas
sadors in countries accrediting their Min
isters to us as Ambassadors. Tins is as
required by tiie Act of March, 1893.
It is advised that the laws be recast af
fecting our Consulates, in order to secure
efficient agencies commensurate with tho
growing requirements of foreign trade.
Denmark is reported as being admitted
to the privilege of the Copyright Act of
tho United states.

The President urges that time be given
for the re-establishment of business con

S conditions which appear to be essential
i be made before any supplementary legis
lation is had. "We should resolutely
turn away from alluring and temporary

From San Francisco Under Secret
Orders—She Is Supposed to Ho En
Route to Honolulu, Carrying In
structions From the State Depart
ment to Minister Willis.
i-il to the Record-Uxiox.
Port Townsend (Wash.), Dec. 4.— The
: barken tine Klikitat, Captain Cutter, ar
rived to-day from Honolulu, with ad
| vices to November 20th, four days alter
tho steamer Alameda sailed for San Fran
[ cisco. Minister Willis submitted to an
interview directly alter the Alameda
sailed, in which he said that the instruc
tions from the United states Government
which he brought from Washington wore
not applicable to the condition of affairs
then existing in the islands. This etate
j ment gi:.ve the annexationists much satis
j faction and the royalists were much dis
pleased. On account of the many ru
mors current of the contemplated move
ments of the Queen's supporters, the
Provisional Government found it •
; sary to keep two companies of soldiers
underarms for several nights after the
Alameda sailed.
The editor of the Evening Star ro
ctuested Minister Willis to submit a state-
I ment to the public to a!lay the general
j feeling of uncertainty. In the published
: iutor\iew r Willis .said: "Yes, I believe
j that the time has como when it is right
and proper for me to use my discretion
in this niiittor. You aro authorized to
say for me that no change in the present
! situation will take place for several
is. I brought with Die certain in
structions from the United States Gov
ernment on the Hawaiian situation.
Since my arrival ojpi tingencies have
arisen about which Sbeither the United
States Government nor niyseU were aware
when 1 left Washington. 1 have thought
best iv the exercise of the discretion al
j lowed me to subimf these matters to
i Washington before proceeding further to
carry out my original intentions. I
forwarded my dispatches to Washington
by to-day's steamer, and until 1 i
an answer to them no change will take
place in the present situation, nor will
any bo allowed."
"What do you mean by the expression,
'Nor will any be allowed ?' "
"I mean just this, that, until the time
comes lor me to carry out my instruc
i tions, tho peace and good order of this
community will bo kept Undisturbed in
t!-.u interests of humanity; that any at
tempt made by any person or persons to
make trouble will be promptly checked
and punished. You may put the matter
more plainly, and Kay that even if the
Provisional Government discharged all
of its troops to-day, no i:;.. would
be allowed for one minute under the
present situation of nii;-> '. Tho whole
Hawaiian question is nbw in abeyance,
and nothing that newspapers can say or
do will alior the situation ono io
make this statement on my own respon
sibility, and in the hope that it will allay
the present excitement. Xo one need
fear trouble, and no lawlessness will be
permitted."
After this statement rumors began to
I ily about that tho (.Juooii's supporterß
would make a final rally in her behalf.
Two companies of troops remained un
der arms, and tho crews of thu United
States men-of-war Philadelphia and
Adams were held in readiness to be land
ed on a moment's notice. The Queen's
advocate came out next day with a denial
of the Willis interview, saying he was
misquoted, and by inference gave en
couragement to the idea that Willis had
or would receive imperative orders to re
store the Queen.
The newspapers containing Blount's
report had not reached the islands when
the Klikitat sailed, but on account of
Willis' intimation relative to his instruc
tions it was surmised that it would be
partial to the Queen's interests.
MISSION OF THE CORWIN.
Washington, Dec. 4.—Gresham de
clinod this morning to talk in regard to
the published report that the revenue
cutter Corwin was to carry a mess;:
the state Department from San Francisco
to Honolulu. There is reason to sup
pose, however, that tho atory is sub
stantially correct. Gresbain was very
busy yesterday with dispatches winch
are to ro on the Corwin. Of what these
contain nothing can be learned. The fact
of dispatching the Corwin so hastily leads
to the surmise that the Administration
lias chauged its policy toward tho islands.
INTERPRETING I.'I.KVKLAN l>'s LANGUAGE.
Washington, Dec. 4. —Representatives
Load and Geary, after reading that part
of the President's message relating to
Hawaiian affairs, stated their belief that
Minister Willis had received instructions
to bring about the Queen's restoration.
Judge Maguire reaffirmed his opinion
that nothing further is meant than the
restoration of the status quo, and that tho
fact of Willis being sent as our accredited
Minister precludes the Queen's re-en
thronement by forcible means without a
declaration of war on the part of Con
gress, for if Willis should adopt forcible
means against the country to which he
was sent as Minister he would be guilty
of tho same act as ex-Minister Stevens,
whose action' is repudiated by Cleveland.
THE COBWIN sails.
San Francisco, Doc. i. — The United
States revenue cutter Corwin sailed
shortly before midnight to-night. Her
destination is a secret, but it is supposed
sho is going to Honolulu with instruc
tions for Minister Willis. It is reported
that one of the .sailors on the Corwin has
been bribed to take dispatches from Min
ister Thurston to I 'resident Dole. The
Captain of the Corwin refused to take
lotters from Consul Wilder, saying he
did not know where he was going.
CONSUL WILDER PLEASED.
San Francisco, Dec. 4. — Hawaiian
1 Wilder, when ho read the news
which arrived to-night from Honolulu,
via .Port Townseud, was greatly pleased.
When asked what unexpected contingen
cies Minister Willis had found in Hono
lulu, he said: "I think he found that the
men composing the Provisional Govern
ment ot Hawaii were high-minded, law
abiding citizens, instead of liiibusterers,
such as he had been led to believe them
to be. This news," continued Wilder,
"will have a yreat effect on the people of
the United States, and I hope the Admin
istration will be forced by popular opin
ion to change its views on the Hawaiian
question. President Cleveland's state
ment in his message to Conere.ss that he
had received no definite news from Willis
does not seem to be corroborated by
what Minister Willis has said in his in
terview published in the Hawaiian pa
pers."
BRAZIL'S NSW CKUISERS.
The Nlcthoroy and America Arrive
Safely at St. Thomas.
St. Thomas, Dec. 4.—As this dispatch
is sent the Brazilian cruisers Nictheroy
and America are preparing to sail under
sealed ordors for some port in Brazil.
The Nictheroy arrived here Monday.
The America arrived here yesterday,
I after a rough trip, and both vessels are I
expected to weigh anchor to-night and
head for the coast of Brazil. The officers
and crews of the Nictheroy and America
ieel full of light, and are most anxious I
i for a brush with the- enemy. Cable mes
sages are said to have been exchanged
here between the Commanders of tho ;
Brazilian cruisers and the home authori
ties, and the lormer aro said to have been
notified that Mello has left Rio to m<
i the ships. This has caused all the more
enthusiasm among the crews of tho
America and Nictheroy. The destination
of the two cruisers is a secret, and it is j
reported that they shall not be allowed to
communicate with the shore. It is doubt
ful when any further news of President
Peixoto's two cruisers will bo forwarded
to the United States.

:>';:>v York, Dec 4.—A Herald's special
from Montevideo says: General Saidauba
De Gama has assumed command of tho
j rebel .-nips left in the harbor by Mello. It
i is now said in Lio that Mello sailed for
Santos with the intention of lending aid
to tho rebel forces in Rio Grande do Sul. |
The insurgents left in Rio bay have for
tified Cabras Island with guns and am
munition, which they had time to take j

TILE NEW FRENCH MINISTRY.
It llus lint a !Slle!:t Majority in the
First Ehsiaeement.
Paris, Dec. 4. —Casimir-Perier, in tho j
i announcement of the new Ministers' pol- ;
icy, said the Government would consider j
the creation of a workmen's provident
fund, and would deal with the quest
of assemblies. The Government, ho in
| sisted would undertake nothing which
I might tend toward a separation of church
aud State, unless the country demanded
it, and would reje< t ail proposals lor a re
vision of the Constitution.
In the Chamber o; Depnties the decla
on of Casimir-Perier of the Cabinet
policy was warmly applauded, cxc
rfroin the Socialist benches. The general
•ussion, on motion ol'M. Grousset, for
general amnesty, was closed, ami the
Chamber, by a vote of '!■'>! to 220, refused
to discuss the clauses of the motion. It
will thus be seen that the new Govern
ment only bad a majority of thirty-one in
i tho first engagement it had with its oppo
nents.
