THE UNITED STATES NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the
shows the navy to be in a remarkably efficient
condition, both as regards tha number of
vessels, their armament and sea-going quali
ties. One year ago the navy consisted of 1G5
vessels of all classes, armed with 1269 guns,
exclusive of howitzers. Since that time there
have been added to it eight new steam sloops,
two torpedo vessels and one dispatch boat,
and it has been diminished by the sale of two
wooden and eleven light-drauglit iron vessels,
leaving as the present number 169 vessels
with 1254 guns, the armament having been
slightly increased by the increase in the n um
ber of guns on the new ships
of this whole number 26 have sail power
only, and of these four are to be placed ut the
disposal of State and local authorities as
school or training ships under the direction
of the act of Congress providing for such
disposition. Seven are in use only as receiv
ing skips, t7vo ace old line of battle ships
which have been mt the stocks for many years,
and eight are of the old type and in bad con
dition. and can be used only for barracks or
stationary school ships, leaving live which
can be put to practical use at sea as store
ships. transports, or surveying vessels.
ouj: steam navy
consists of 157 vessels of all clisses and in
every condition. Of this number twenty-five I
are.tugs, used, with one or two exeeptioas,
for yard purposes ; thirty-seven are ar
mored vessel*, and two are torpedo boats,
leaving seventy-three steam vessels, originally
of a class adapted for cruising. These are

Tito Secretary says lie has given special at-1
tention to placing the iron-clad vessels of the
navy in a condition lor active and efhcient 1.
service, and adds ! !
are of a class and in condition for actual and
efficient service; four others, of the class of
powerful donble-turreted monitors, are actual- 1
ly on hand undergoing repairs, and a fifth is
well worth the same attention; but the re
mainder may be counted as really useless for j
any active and efficient purpose. Four of the
largest of them, designed and commenced
during the war, have never been launched.
aud consist, in fact, only of their wooden I
frames, still on the stocks, and their incom
plete plating and machinery stored at the
navy yards, and though their names and de
signed dimensions appear on the navy list,
and the remaining twelve of the class known
as light-draught monitors not able to carry I
their turrets, guns and munitions of war, arc
valuable only as old material. Of the se\ enty
three steam cruising vessels five of over 2000 |
tons each have remained on the stocks
since the war, never having been
launched, and are not estimated to be
worth for our purposes the cost of comple
tion, seven are condemned and laid up iß I
ordinary as unfit for further use, three others
with condemned machinery, and forty-one
are in commission 1'or various duties. Of the
lemaiuing seventeen, upon which we must
rely to take the place ot (he cruising vessels
as they return home and are put out of com
mission, two are hud up ready tor service, I
seven are repairing at the various navy yards,
and eight are building under special appro
priations of Congress. Thus it will be seen
that one-half of the steam navy adapted to
cruising is in commission and in actual ser
vice. This number of vessels cannot be pru
dent ly diminished, but if it is to be main
tained there must be a gradual and constant to
addition to the navy to supply the plaees of
those which are each year found to be worn
out and unfit for further service, and for this I
purpose a fixed amount for tonnage should I
he built every year. This amount may be I
small, but it should be constant and untailing.

[From the Mobile Register.]
ltev. Dr. Thos. U. Dudley, of Virginia, re
cently of Baltimore, has been elected Bishop
of Kentucky, to succeed Bishop Cummins,
deposed. Ah! Tom. my boy, do you remem
ber the " Dedils" of the University of Virgi
nia? What jolly times those were! Now you
area bishop! Harry Toulman is a judge. Otey
is out West dealing faro. Not long ago we
picketl up Patterson on the streets dead
drunk and forwarded him to Mississippi.
Arne]], of Tennessee, turned Radical, went
to Congress, and died. Warmotli made Ken
naril a Supreme Court Judge ot Louisiana.
Thompson was killed leading un Arkansas
regiment at Shiloh. All the rest of us who
•re not dead or forgotten are struggling to
keep our noses above water. I ou alone are
bishop, my dear Tom! From the newspaper
offices of the Gulf, from the faro banks of the
West, from the judicial seats, from the studios

nad been anticipated, and produced no com
ment.
There was a perceptible stir at the sugges
tion to fresh taxation, and of ahmdonin« the
civil service system. Clerk McPherson, how
! ever T seemed to think the part of the docu
ment slandering the Southern people was
most worthy of emphasis, and this he read
witn all the potency he could summon up.
Biit not even this tirade of malice could
change the verdict of the House. Even in
his best days, bis first term. Grant's recom
mendations carried very little weight, and
those of to-day are scarcely regarded by any
body.
THE QUESTION 04 RESUMPTION.
Th e outpourings from Attorney General
\V llliams s outrage mill were expected, and
passed unheeded. The only debate is over
the financial issue, and here members take
sides according to their financial views, sub
ject, however, to this modification: that Dem
ocratic members who last session opposed an
expansion of the currency are by no means
ready to agree to the Government policy for
forcing resumption. It is predicted to-night
by one well informed member that the Com
mittee on Banking and Currency will not in
dorse the policy of the message. Such prom
inent Republicans as Butler and Kelley will
probably make open war upon it. For the
first time since the Republican party came to
possess power, there are visible and decisive
breaches of discipline revealing themselves
on the floor of the lower house of Congress.
The President's message is to them a bomb
shell. It makes a square issue; in fact, a
series of square issues, which the managers
do not pretend to deny, that they will find
themselves powerless to subdue. ' The first
gun of the war was tired to-day by Pig-iron
Kelley, who says broadly that lie will oppose

A Corner in Bivalves and Snapper*.
About the cheekiest enterprise of modern
times is that undertaken by a ring of Mobil
operators who now seek to obtain from tin
Legislature of Alabama the exclusive right
to snap up all the red-snappers and raise all
the festive bivalves from the vasty deep of
Mobile bay. These gentlemen are doubtless
I reformers, but such reforms as they propose
I are well calculated to raise a rebellion from
I the wave-washed shores of the gulf to th
wind-swept prairies of Wyoming. Then,
just to think of the plea which these ene
mies of all bun vivants put forward to justify
this outrage against the best interests of a
convivial world. These unconscionable
axe-grinders have gone to Montgom
ery, and, with a view to catch the Reform
Democratic and Granger vote iu the
Legislature they talk about the great reve
nues which, as a corporate body, they are
yearning to pour into the State treasury,
whereas, as tlie matter now stands. Tom,
Dick and Harry go fishing anti oyster.grap
pling, and capture innumerable hosts ot tin*
earmine-hued tenants of the water, and
raise uncounted bushel* of the delicious
shell-fish, and for the privilege pay nothing
into the public coffers. Worse than Ca ta
jines ! Shall they be allowed to tax our
dainties? Shall we be compelled to be taxed
for those fat, round, appetizing Mobile l.i.
valves in order that messieurs, the monopo
lists, mar grow rich? Shall all the oyster
men of Mobile and all the fishermen for red
snappers pay toll to a company of monopo
lists for the'privilege of engaging in their
calling v Never. The country cannot and
will not submit to such tyranny. If the new
Democratic Legislature of Alabama signal
izes its exercise of power by granting thi*
monopoly privilege, the cause is irretriev
ably damaged, and the sun of 18 1 6 v> ill shine
on the wreck of the party. Human nature
cannot stand everything, especially no. tax
it s ovsters and red-sna pper*.

THE CITY.
Foul Play.— Some who have speculation
in their eye are on the look ont for cheap
bargains. There was a sad experience of this
mania at the residence of Dr. Maas. No. 65
Dauphine street, where some one who has no
conscienct or did not expect to be invited to
the family Christmas dinner, entered the
yard at the dead hour of midnight and de
spoiled the madame of some of her cherished
poultry, on which she fondly hoped to regale
her friends during the approaching festivi
ties. May they rest -
Fractured * His Ankle. -John Conneli,
while at work on the Iron Building, foot of
Canal street, yesterday afternoon a cidt ntly
slipped and fell, and vfras hurt quite seriously.
He was conveyed without delay to the ( harity
Hospital, where, after hav ing been attended
to by the doctor, it was found that the fill
produced a componnd fracture of the ankle.
Badly Hurt.— John Schafer, a German,
was, yesterday morning, caught iu the ma
chinery at the Louisiana Oil Factory, on Pe
ters street, where lie is employed, and very
badly hurt His arm above the elbow is
broken, and his band too is very much lace
rated. Schafer was conveyed to the Charity
Hospital, where he will assuredly b< well
cared for.
Dangerously Wounded. —About half-past 9
o'clock last night, a difficulty occurred in the
drinking saloon, coiner of Dryades and Union
streets, in which a woman, named Emma
Johnson, was shot and dangerously wounded
in the left side of the body with pistol, by
a man named Popite, other name unknown,
who made his escape. The wounded woman
was conveyed to the Charity Hospital, where
she received the proper medical attention.
Suicide. Mr. H. 1». Fleming, of the Canal
street ferry boat Louise, reports while cross
ing from the city to Algiers, about !• o'clock
last night, an unknown man jumped over
board and was drowned before any assistance
could be rendered. He was seen about the
fern landing before going on the boat by
Officer Clavin, of the Harbor Precinct, who
describes him to be about 22 years old,
dressed in black coat and hat.
He had a letter in his hands, aud tore it up
before going on the ferry. The ciii.se of the
rash act is unknown.
Sudden Death. A woman named Dolly

In
d
The Stolon Murillo."
Jt would certainly tijuteai* that there is a
ver\ obvious blunder m the telegraphic re
lation of the alleged theft of a painting bv
Murillo from the Cathedral of Seville. The
picture is described as "St Anthony
Tempted by Women," and a* there i* no ac
count ot any such picture have ever been in
the Cathedral of Seville, noram mention of
this subject among the paintings of Murillo,
we are constrained to believe that the state
ment an error. It is probable that the picture
indicated is the " St. Anthony of Padua." a
large canvas which has heretofore been in the
chapel of the baptistry of the Seville Cathe
dral, and i* counted as one of Muirillo's
greatest works. 'Ibis picture was painted in
1656, on an order from the ( hapter of the
Cathedra], and cost 10,000 Spanish reals.
It is thus described by an authority :
•'Kneeling near a table, the shaven, hrowu
froeked saint is surprised by a visit from the
infant Jesus, a charming, naked babe, who
descends in a golden flood of glory, walkin''
the bright air as if it w< re the earth, while
around him floats ai.-d hovers a company of
cherubs, most ot them children, forming a
rich garland ot graceful forms and lovely
faces. Gazing up in rapture t.t this dazzling
vision, the saint kneels, with anas out
stntched, to receive the approaching Saviour.
On the table at his side there is a 7-ase con
taining lilies, painted ivilh such Zeuxis-like
skill that bird*, wandering among the aisles,
have been seen attempting to perch noon it
and peck the flowers; and Lithe left of the
picture an arch discloses the architectural
perspective of the cloister."
It is related, though doubted by many, that
after the retreat of the French from Spain in
1813, the Duke of Wellington offered to buy
this picture for England, covering it with
ounces of gold, which would haw* brought its
cost up to about 648,000, the canvas being
fifteen feet sonar . In 1P33 ti e "St. Anthony"
was repaired—which inSp-.inmeans 1 vainied
—so that many a delicate tor.cl of Murillo';
pencil has disappeared. Eno -'ll. ' owe. er, is
left to show tin- genius of the Iginai de ion
and the splendor of the original colors. There
were seventeen works by Murillo iu the Catli- !
edral of Seville, of which the -'Sir Anthony" i
was the gem. fts loss i-, certainly a sad one, j
and it seems alumst impo--.-.ible that it should ;
have been stolen. It was protected by a high
iron railing, which separated it from those
who came t« gaze at it.
The Herald of Health is o : opinion that the
simple color of one's surroundings has a
marked influence on his health. It says:
"Yellow on the walls of onr rooms has a \er\
lepressing effect on the mind. Violet is
worse. A man would go mail iu a violet
papered or painted room. Black rooms, or
rooms heavily draped iu mourning, produce
loom or foreboding. Never wear mourning
long, unless you wish to become sad and
sorrowful beyond what nature ever intended-"
