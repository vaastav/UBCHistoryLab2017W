COMMUNICATION FROM PRESI.
DENT READ TO CONGRESS.
NEEDS OF THE NATION
New Laws and Changes In Existing
Statutes Are Among Recom
mendations Made by the
Chief Executive.
Washington, Dec. 8. - President
Roosevelt's. message, to congress,
which was read in both houses to-day,
contained many important recom
mendations as to legislation which he
considers urgent.
The financial standing of the coun
try, the president points out, is at
present excellent, but there is great
need .that the currency commission
proceed at once to remedy existing de
fects.
The president repeats with empha
sis his views, hitherto expressed, that
for the good of the country the con
trol of great corporations, and edpe
cially the railroads, must be placed in
the hands of the national government.
The Shermanr anti-trust law he con
demns as positively harmful in its
workings, urging as a substitute a law
which shall expressly permit combina
tions which are in the-interest of the
public, but shall at the same time give
to some agency in the national govern
ment full power of control and super
vision over them.
In the interests of the wageworkers
of the country the president urges the
nrnhibitinn of .child Inar Almlminutin
prohibition of child labor, diminution
of women labor, and shortening of
hours of all mechanical labor. There
should be,. he says, a. progressive in
heritance tax on large fortunes.
The matter of taking care of* the
wageworkers, who, tidder our present
industrial system, become killed, crip.,
pled, or worn out as part of the regu
lar incidents of a given ':business, is
gone into at length, and a system of
industrial old-age pensions indorsed.
The president recommends that, be
ginning with the supreme court, the
salaries of judges be doubled.
Demands .for legislation made. by
certain labor leaders on the last con
gress come in for sharp criticism, be
ing described as u4just and impracti-"
cal, and opposed to the ,real interests.
of the workers.
The much-discussed powbr of injunc
tion the president cohaiders a great
eqpitable remedy, - which must on no.
account he destroyed, though he con
siders that safeguards wsould be erset
ed against its, abuse. .mmediate hear
ings of cases, following the isuuance.
of an injunction, he -thinks, would do
much toward" diarmlng criticism of
the courts.
Discussing meqiowes nesessasy for
the proper control of giflt corpore
tions operating in de84ee of law, the
president says:
"Real.damage has been done by the
manifold, and .conflicting interpreta
tions of: the- interstate commerce law?.
Control over the great corporatlons do-.
ing interstate business can be effec
-tive only if it is -vested with full power
in an administrative department, a
branch of the federal ex~utive, carry
ing out a federal.- law; it can
never be effective if a divided respon
sibility is left in both the states and.
the 'nation; it can never be effective
if left in the hands. of. the courts to be
decided by lawsuits."
Inenidiate action toward the preser
vation of the eisti'ng forests is put
forward as a national duty.
In the opinion of the president,'" a
ion by the present session of con
gress for the improvement of our in
land waterways is imperative. He
recqmmends the creation of a perma
nent commission authorized to co
ordinate the work of all the govern
ment departments relating to watar
ways, and to frame and supervise the
execution of a comprehensive plan.
The immediate institution of postal
savings banks, recommended in previ
ous messages, is again urged, together
with the establishment of a parcel
post service for the mutual benefit of
the farmer and the country store
keener.
neeper.
Larger grants to the bureau of eda
cation is one of the recommendations
contained in the message.
Of our foreign policy the message
says: "This nation's foreign policy is
based on thetheory that right must
be done between nati6ns, precisely as:
between indliduals, an-: In our 'ac
tions for the lktt ten years 'W have
in 4ais matter paves.eas-tfalth by-ea
deeds. We have behaved, and are be
having, tiwaQi other 4AMi4.lpas AI
private life an honorable man would.
behave towards his fellows."
High praise is accorded All' tholde
responsible for the expeditious ".trk
being done on the Panama canal, and
the extension of the ocean mail act
of 1891 urged, to the end that Amer
ican ocean mail lines to the east may
be established.
Real progress, the president de
clares, is being made in the Philip
pines, and the outlook is declared
bright.
Steps to maintain 'and Increse- the
present efficiency of the National
Guard is another recommendation of
the message. The services of well
trained army officers with the militia
are shown to have had excellent re
suits.
The system of promotion by merit
in the army, displacing the hitherto
prevailing system of seniority, is de
'fended as vital to the geod of the
service.
The message concludes :withr tb the
recommendation of a large increas.iin
the navy. It is desirable, the presi
dent says, to complete as soon as pos
sible h squadron of elgi.t' baitlestips
of best existing tip,' '
PROVED BY TIME.
No Fear of Any Further Trouble.
David Price, Corydon, Ia., says: "1
was in the last stage of kidney trouble
-'--lame, weak, run
down to a mere
skeleton. My back
was so bad I could
hardly walk and
the kidney secre
tions much disor
dered. A week after
I began using
SDban's' Kidney Pills
I ,couWd walk with
out a cane, and as I continued nmy
health gradually returned. I was so
grateful I made a public statement of
my case, and now seven years have
passed, I. -am still perfectly well."

OF TWO EVILS, ETC.
Youngster Evidently Had His Own
Idea as to the Choice.
My neighbor, writes a correspondent,
has four young sons, whom he and his
wife duly lead to church every Sun
day. Just as the sermon was about
.o begin last Sunday one of the boys
was observed to look very uncomfort
able, and,. having explained the nature
of his sufferings, was sent home. -His
younger brotlier, in an urgent whis
per, demanded of his mother: "Where's
Tom gone?"
"He's, gone -home."
"What for?"
"The mother wlhispered, low: "Ie's
got toothache."
And the lad, as he sat up to listen to
Sthe preacher, muttered, in a stage
whisper: "L4ucky dog!'"

Suffering .Was Terrible - Soon
" Entirely Cured by' uticura;
"Eczema appeared on my son's face.
We went-to a doctor who treatedchim

that his face and head' were not'hing

they were going to fall off, so we tried
another doctor for font months, -the
baby never getting any bettial. His

terribly that he cohld' not sleep, After

".Of course you don'tappreciate the

"Yes, I. do," ,protested the im

"Well," insisted Rosenfeld, "what's
