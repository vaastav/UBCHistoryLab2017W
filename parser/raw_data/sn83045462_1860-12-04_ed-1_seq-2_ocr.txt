The Constiim;i?w questions wbethet the Hoi- '
perites of the present Congress have become suf- j
flcirntly entfjfhtenrd as to the actual tendency of ,
events to be willing to acknowledge their own i
responsibility for the perilous situation of affair?,
aiid to evince an h<me?t d?*sire to apply ?uch remedies
ns still r-miin in tbelr power to offer.

The reading of tbe President's Annual Metwr;
created an Intense sensation to day In the House.
vrhU b never before looked so liko what It was
designed for?a deliberative assembly. Every
member was apparently in hts seat. listening with
dignity, decorum, and breathless attention. The

a glorious sigh!, Indeed. One might have almost
dreamed that the fathers of the Repuollc again
occupy for the nonce the high places that now
know them no more.
The portion treating of secession formed the
topic of this Intense interest It proved to be what
might have been expected from President Buchanan's
public history aad well known views upon
the point In IsMie. While showing that the
Union is already practically dismembered by
an effort of douth CaroUaa to secede, he disproves
the soundness of the pleas upon which
the right of secession Is based?showing that
It is naked revolution and nothing else. At
ice tame ntw ne ucaiouiuiu* mtu mivc
the utter impolicy of attempting to cure the
difficulty by measures of coercion. He pledges
himself to the execution of tbe law* by the exerc
!?e of all tbe power* of the Government really
at bis command, and shows that without prompt
action by Congress those powers will be of no
avail in the emergency.
The paper (message) Is destined to form a landmarc
In tbe history of American public affairs;
insomuch as it will at once become tbe platform
upon wnica an conservative ana reany unionloving
men of tbe land must necessarily, aa they
will gladly, rally In this most momentous contest
In which our country ever became Involved.
ttxromakt a?id Partial Sc?r?*sio!i o? Patmest
by thk tpk\?rkt of ths united statks
it Is no longer to he disguised that the Treasury
of the 1' S is already in such condition from want
of funds that by direction of his superrlorin office,
the Treasurer here is compelled to decline paying
requisitions upon him for tbe Government's cur
rent expenses?paying at sight only such as must
be so paid to insure the continued transaction of
tbe public business. and withholding payment of
the balance until the Treasury may have more
means at command at the great centers of trade.
We hear of very heavy amounts in requisitions
on various accounts thus held over at the Department,
involving, among other things, the nonpayment
of the wages of sailors. So, too, has the
Treasurer been forced to decline according to the
officers of Congress at this time sufficient to liquidate
tbe dues to tbe members of the body.
The truth is, the anticipation of secession?in
diminishing the revnue most extraordinarily?has
caused the Government thus temporarily to sus
pend the payment or much of what irowc#, and
could liquidate in ordinary times.
Thi Great Socthwzstkrx Chaim or Kaileoadi.?The
great southwestern route through
Virginia and Tennessee, known as the Virginia
and Tennessee route, Is now making the time advertised
on their bills (three days) between the
cities of Washington and New Orleans. This
line offers many advantages, namely: the cheapnnu
r\f fart* ihnrtnhdi nf da r?r ki ncr of
>agga?e, few changes, all of which are made
without ttouble to the passei.ger, the roads connecting
at the same depot, thus protecting the
travele* from exposure to the weather. Thi? line
is now checking baggage from Washington and
points north to New Orleans. First-class sieepi
ng can are used on all night trains. The scenery
with which this route is adorned is charming, and
well repays the expenditure of travel. The time
Is twenty-four hour* leas, and distance two hundred
m'lea shorter than any other route. The
great U. 8. mail and Adams' express are carried
over this route. We give the above notice that
travelers may secure the advantages ottered by

What Will Be Done With It??We have
heard of fourteen different schemes for disposing
of the portion of the Annual Message treating of
secession, to be sent to Congress to-day?only
fi)iirt?k#n in far ' TK? m?inin? nf *11 im tKai
aa yet no concert of purpose has been arrived at
by any cooaiderable number of membera. The
plan that meets moat favor, so far, la to refer It (in
the House) to a committee of one Repreaentatlve
from each State, to be selected by the State's delegstlon.
To this It will probably be endeavored
to append a further proposition instructing that
committee to report amendments to the Constitution
to cure the disabilities of which the South
complain We question much whether any such
provision will pass the House just now. sincerely
aa we desire prompt legislation to that end; as it
will at least require the exposition of debate to
?pen the eyes of the Republican party of Congress
to the fact that the continuance of the South in
the Union depends wholiy upon giving her additional
constitutional guarantees.
Ssnsaiiox Rumors?We have every reason to
believe that there Is no truth In the story from
this city, published la yesterday's New York Hitaid,
saying that on Saturday last Secretary Cobb
resigned, to take effect on Wednesday next. Ilia
family arc preparing to return home immediately,
but we know nothing to Induce the belief that
M r Co'ob himself designs following them so long
a? Georgia maintains her connection with the
I'oioa, intact. Some one hss clearly imposed on
the HtraU ? correspondent.
"kvbinx** a ussr-scr ?aw" on Him?The
story of ? recent meeting of leading Southern
(planting) capitalists not in public life, in tbia
city, by previoos agreement, and their subsequent
call io a body on the President to give him their
advice concerning the current crisis, with which
somebody has "staffed" a New York HtraH correspondent,
sad with which that journal, in turn,
' stuffed" the public yesterday, is unadulterated
balderdash.
Qcibt Vasrasdat. ?That tbe well-known
talking-men of Congress were perfectly quiet yesterday,
grows wholly out of the fact tint tbe
message not having been sent in, tbey had noth
log whatever before them to blatherskite over.
By 2 p. no. to-day the floodgates of controversy
are expected to be raised on the question of the
referaoca of the portion of the menage treating of
aeceaston.
