Their Official Documents—The lliv.ilry to
secure Messages in Former Days.
Washnißton Post.
The capacity of President Cleveland
for hard work says a correspondent, is
j.erhaps best illustrated by the fact that
iio is writing every ward of his message.
His experience last year, when lie wrote
with his own hand the longest message
ever submitted by a president to congress
joes not seem (• have dismayed him in
the least. This year, although the mes
sage will be briefer, it will be of sufficient
length to make the physical task of writ
ing it somewhat laborous. Thoroughly
engrossed in his work, the president sees
as few callers as he possibly can. He
takes no recreation except a drive in the
afternoon, and even Thanksgiving day
was devoted to work. From morning to
night he bends over his desk —a histori
cal piece of furniture, made from the
timbers of the ship Rescue and presented
to this government by (Jueen Victoria
( if England. He writes n small
cramped hand, but his pen moves over
the paper with considerable ease, and he
rarely has occasion to revise his matter.
All the phrases in his writings which
have become famous were first thought*.
Very few persons have any idea of the
great amount of detail which the presi
dent accomplishes. All his veto mes
-ages were written by him personally,
and that too, in the longest possible way.
In returning house bill No. f>96B, for in
stance, he wrote. “House bill number
live thousand nine hundred and sixty
eight.” He penned his Thanksgiving
proclamation. Many of the letters which
other presidents turned over to their
secretaries are answered by him in per
son. He even addressed with his own
hand the envelope which informed Dis
trict Attorney Benton of his reinstate
ment.
In personally writing his messages
President Cleveland differs from any of
tiis predecessors. Lincoln wrote compar
atively little of his messages, but hs paid
done attention to the phraseology. In
those days the “bnts” and the “ifs”
counted. He wrote a small, even hand,
easily read, and his manuscript was "ot
often marred by erasures.
Johnson, who fallowed him. wrote still
loss. His right arm was crippled and he
could not raise it to his head. He used
pen mid ink bat rarely, finding a lead
pmcil less tiresome. It. is said that he
did not write a letter in ink after he be
came president. He signed his name
frequently, of course, but an entire letter
in his handwriting is now worth almost
its weight in gold. H dictated his mes
sages to Col. William G. Moore, who was
then his private secretary. He thought
quickly, for the impossibility of writing
developed the faculty of dictation to its
highest degree.
I’r.sident Grant sent eight messages to
congress. They were in the main con
irihutions from his cabinet others, writ
ten in the first person and then dove
tailed together.. They were not finally
submitted, however, without careful con
sideratiou. Grant was cautious and con
servative and carefully modified nud re
vised the recommendations of his cabinet
officers. He loved to write, and all the
additions and emendations of (ho mes
sages were in his own handwriting. He
wrote many autograph letters, and his
vetoes wore also in his own hand. He
eould dictate, but not easily, and when
ever he wanted to be particularly sorciblo
he shut himself in his room and, free
Irom interruption, wrote out in full what
he desired to say.
Mr. Hayes wrote a sprawley irregular
baud, hard to revd by those who were un
accustomed to it. His message was
largely the work of Mr. Rodgers, his
private secretary, a man of considerable
scholorship. Whatever polish they con
tained was due entirely to Mr. Rodgers,
and many portions, indeed, were written
by the latter in the first instance. The
cabinet officers aided largely in the work
and their contributions were used with
out revision. President Arthur’s hand
writing was bold and largo, showing con
-idcrable force, snd (he words and let ;
ters were joined in an easy running style
ns if the writer had done considerable
clerical duty. Surrogate Rollins, of New
VorK, it is not generally known, was Mr.
Arthur’s right-hand man in the prepara
tion of the messages. Together they ar
ranged the topics to be treated upon
and many of the ideas contained in the
documents emanated directly from Mr.
Rollins.
hi former days the messagea weredmp- j
heated on manifold paper, and when the j
private secretary was supposed to have
reached the c.apitol for there was no ‘
telegraph or telephone connection with j
the while house then copies were dis
tributed to the anxious correspondents 1
nd reporters. Then there was a grand i
i-;mi for the telegraph and newspaper!
"dices: “I have seen them nearly break
their necks in getting downstairs,’’ said |
vi tr rean employe cf the white house |
in describing the scene. Many of the j
newspaper men did not hesitate to go j
through the lower and private part of j
' • building, and make short outs to I
Pennsylvania avenue, through the ,
■rounds. (Ithers, who had carriages and
the deeteat horses the city could afford
-lauding at the front entrance, at a speed
fa; beyond the limits of the law. At the
a wpaper offices an extra force of com
po-itors hurried the message info type.
1 he public snfered into the spirit of riv
alry and large crowds surrounded the
dices, all ready to cheer the first news

".uder hit arm. Nowdays it is different.
1 i persons who. in these peaceful times,
take even sufficient interest in a message
to stauggle through its long array of
omnionplace sentences are in a large
n nority.
\ president's message has always been
_ r rdcd as the most important piece of

days of fluctuations in gold it had its

several trusted operators, and as sc in as
the last word had gone over the wiaes it
was returned to the correspondent with

press matter usually receives, and by him

hardly necessary to add, did not lose its

Bl STS OF THE VICE PTESIDKM's.
They Are to Adorn the (iallery of the senate
A (iood Portrait of Mr. Arthur
Last April, writes a Whington cor
rt‘-pondent of the New York Herald, the
sonate library committee reported a reso
lution authorizing the payment from the
contingent fund of a sum sufficient for
the purchase of the busts of the vice
presidents from John Adams down to
the present time. The resolution, which
was adopted without debate, provided
that no more than five busts should be
received within one fiscal year, and that
each should be modeled by an artist re
siding in the same state with the subject.
The matter was then placed in the charge
of Mr. Edward Clark, the architect of the
capitol. It was finally decided that the
first five should be the busts of the three
vice presidents then living, viz.. Hanni
bal Hamlin, William A. Wheeler, and
Chester A. Arthur, and then revert to
Adams and Jefferson, coming down the
line to Mr. Hendricks. The list includes
only the legally-elected vice presidents,
and not (hose who may have filled the
office ad interim.
It is the intention to place the five
busts of those above-mentioned in the
niches of the north wall of the senate
chamber, where the vice presidents gen
erally sit, bnt when all shall have been
finished they will bo arranged chronology
cally in their respective niches in the
galleries of the senate. The busts will
be placed on pedestals of a height suffi
cient to prevent being handled by that
class of curiously disposed persons who
can not be satisfied with anything less
than personal contact with whatever hap
pens to be placed on exhibition. The
pedestal will be chiseled from marble of
a color approximating the general tone
of the wall- that of Sienha marble. The
busts will stand three feet in height.
They will be so arranged that the center
of the face will be the point from which
the semiclucular head of the niche might
be descried. They will be executed from
the best portraites obtainable.
The effort will be to secure portraits
contemporaneous with the services of
the subject ns vice president. Some
difficulty may be experienced, it is feared
in procuring good representations of
some of the dead statesmen such, for
example, as these of Aaron Burr and
Daniel Tompkins, of New York. The
only goou portrait of burr is believed to
bethatinthe possession of Princeton
college of which Jonathan Edwards, Mr.
Burr's grandfather, was at one time presi
dent.
Ex-President Arthur, upon being con
sulted in regard to the matter, requested
that Mr. St. Gandens, of New York City,
be Given the work of fashioning his
features into clay.
Mr. Wheeler expressed no prefeince as
to the sculptor, but regretted that on
account of his health he could not give
a personal sitting. Ho referred Mr. Clark,
however, to a portrait, of himself at the
bureau of engraving and printing in this
city, which he regards ns probably the
best presentment of himself in existence,
Mr. Clark has asked J. Q. A. Ward, of
New York, to perform this work, but it is
not known at present whether he will ac
cept.
To Mr. Franklin Simmons, of Maine,
will be assigned the preparation of Mr.
Hamlin's bust, while Mr. Daniel French
of Massachusetts, and a Mr. Ezekiel, of
Virginia will perform a similar service
for ex-Presidents Adams and Jefferson.
The sum which the artists will receive
for this service will be SBOO, only one
contrac t being awarded to each sculptor.
A life-size portrait of President Arthur
was made by Leciere, of New York, from
many sittings, representing him as a gen
11 email who had just stepped out of the
main door of a mansion on to the porch
to salute the face of nature on an autum
nal morn. In one hand he was holding a
book, with one finger between the leaves.
A rose, as though fallen from his button
hole, lay upon the step. The artist died
before the picture could be criticised by
Mr. Arthur, and through the aid of an
eminent New York and Washington artist
the changes desired by him were under
taken. They did not relate in any degree
to the face, but merely to the size and
repose of the body. As changed under
Mr. Arthur’s direction this admirable
work of art now adorns the white house,
and is esteemed as a striking portrait.

A prominent Chicago real estate man
and his partner were the best of friends,
and tbeir intimacy extended to personal
as well as business matters. His partner
was a bachelor, and was in the habit of
reading him letters of an ardent and af
fectinate nature from a young lady who
signed herself “Susie.” The hero of the
story went away on an extended trip and
returned just in time to attend the wed
ding of his partner. Wishing to show
his good will he sent the happy couple a
wedding present, and at the wedding re
ception, stepped gallantly forward to pay
his respects.
“I hardly feel like a stranger,” he said
in his sweetest tones, addressing the
bride. “In fact I feel as though 1 ought
to be quite well acquainted with my j
partner's wife, aiuee he has often done
me the honor to read me extracts from
his dear Susie’s letters.”
Tha faces of the husband and the |
speaker were studies as the bride drew
herself up and said emphatically and dis
tantly;
“I beg your pardon, sir, my name is
Helen. ’’

San Fiaccl-co Chronicle.
It has often been said that a man
can not live after being scalped, writes a
Fort Keogh correspondent to the Chron
icle. One of the Crow Indian scouts with
Custer before that brave officer met his
fate was caught by a party of Sioux alone
on the prairie and scalped alive. His
enemies cut a pear shaped piece out of
the crown of his head and left him writh
ing in agony, snpoosing ho would of
course die. Notwithstanding al! which he
“•idured, the redskin recovered, and at last
accounts was living with his people on
the Crow reservation and doing well.
There is an old hunter in western Mon
tana whose cabin is located on the east
ern slope of the Uocky mountains, who
hud Ids hair raised some years ago by a
band of savages, and yet he lives and
thrives in most astonishing good health.
The old fellow's name is Ganzio, and by
reason of his advanced years would, in
tlie natural course of events, have white
hair now, only that he has no hair at all
to speak of. Still, what little he has got
is whitened or gray, the rest of his head,
“where the hair ought t grow,” being as
bald as a billiard ball. To be exact, Gan
zio did not lose his entire scalp, but only
a portion of it. The probabilities are
that he could not have survived with the
loss of (he whole top of his head. Some
few years ago. when Sitting Hull was
master of this country, Ganzio was the
guide of an emigrant party en route to
Fort Laramie.
The story of Hint dangerous expedition
is an exceedingly interesting one, and
ns related by himself it runs as fol
folws;
“One day we were coming into the val
ley of Hut creek, on onr way to Fort
Laramie, when we thought wu saw In
dians coming down lha creek to the right.
Instead of camping there, wo thought it
safer to water onr stock and go on to the
hills and make a dry camp in the
bushes. 1 had been sent on ahead up the
hill to reconnoifer, and took with mo a
boy named Kountze, from Omaha, mere
ly for company. AVe .-.at down to wait
for the wagons, which were slowly coming
up ont of the valley. AVhen Hie wagons
reached us I started on alone through the
rocks and pine bushes to seek a good
camp. A few hundred yards further on 1
looked down a ravine to the right and
faw five mounted Indiana ride across the
valley. I started to go back to the train,
when at least a dozen ran at me ont of
bushes, and you bet I ran and called for
help. In a minute more two or three of
them shot at me. 1 felt a sharp, sting
ing pain in my right leg, and another in
my left shoulder, and I fell. Then they
were upon me in a minute, and one of
them put his knee on my back, while
another hit me with a club. Another
struck me with the butt of a gun and I
became partly unconscious. Still I had
reason and feeling enough left to know 1
was being scalped; for Hie hair held so
tightly and the pain was so awful that I
could not die then even if I wanted to.
I felt a hot stinging pain all around the
top of :uy head the hair being torn out
by the roots, so to speak and it was too
much. I died, or at least I thought I did,
but ns it happened my sculp or at least a
part of it. was saved just as it was being
torn off. The boys at the wagon bad
seen me running and saw the Indians and
came at a run thirteen of them, arriv
ing just in time to prevent Hie red devils
finishing their work. The Indians, as
well as my friends, thought I was dead,
but I came to again, and what was left, of
my scalp was laid back in its place. It
was only half torn off you see, and Hie
place is pretty well healed now.”
"AA hat did you do with yourself after
ward?”
“AA hy, I hurried into Fort Laramie, got
the attention of a physician, and went
bark to Hie states a while; but the western
fever cama strong upon me again and I
returned to the mountans. where I have
been ever since.
Calculating the Size ef the Kartli.
Exchange.
The earlier attempts at calculating the
size of the globe were based on astrono
mjcal observations. It would be difficult
to-day to say within what degree of ac
curacy the figure then obtained could
have been relied upon, as the nnits of |
measurement used by those pioneers
have been lost, and could not have been
compared with the units now in use.
One of the earlier attempts at obtain
ing the actual length of the earth’s meri
dian hy direct measurement of n portion
of the same was made in the sixteenth j
century by a French doctor. The means j
employed, although very ingenious,!
would be considered perfect!; clumsy
and inadequate by the modern scientist, i
There was in this early measurement no |
attempt at mathematical precision as
understood in the present century, and
considering the simplicity of the method
employed by the doctor, it is only to be
wondered that no greater error was ob
tained in its final result. The measure- |
merit consisted simply in driving from
Baris to Amiens, and counting the revol
utions of the wheels of the carriage, and
from the number of revolutions of the
wheels of the carriage, obtain the dis
tance between the two cities, which could
serve as the basis for calculating the
length of the meridian. Of course this
calculation could not by any means be
considered accurate, but, taking into ac
count the means employed, the result ob
tained has been subsequently found to be
wonderfully precise.
The most curious thing about it is
that what would now be considered grave
errors and inexactitudes were so dUtribu
ted that they almost compensated each
other, and the dimensions then obtained
show only slight differences with the
dimensions given- hy the most recent
i measurements, Thus chance and no
| belter name could be found permitted
'of the same results, with only
(a small final error, being obtained with
that cade method, that are now obtained
with the most precise instruments and
with the most complicated calculations.
As to Whiskers.
T wo fallacies are in vogue regarding the ;
whisker question, fine is that a thin
faced man should support side whisker*
to widen his fact: the other that a round ;
faced fat man should f avor loug chin I
whiskers to lengthen his face. Both are
1 adopted on the coonti r action and anti
Jote principle, but are wrong s wrong
can be. A man with a sharp chin exposed
is thin and appears thin in spite o* his
burnsides. And a moon shaped man
gives himself a humorous and clownish
appearance by wearing a long, sharp
tuft on his chin. The principle of
conformity should be observed and a
wholesale change made. A thin man. for
instance, should not wear chin whiskers.
Ino whiskers at all, or a beard. He no
t more looks well with side whiskers and a
peaked chin than he would ( stuff his
chest and not his cheeks and calves. To
look well he must be uniformly and con
sistently thin, or he may modify it by a
complete beard. A fat man should be
smooth faced or wear universal whiskers
prutty closely cropped. A well-propor
tioned and moderately full faced man
may vary the style and quantity of his
whiskers with impunity, so far as the
thin or broad appearance i* concerned.
Avery short beard gives an animal look;
if very large it indicates vanity or crank
iness.
A SKA lit'tl FOR A COKINK.
linn the Hiali nf a Young Lady "as saved
from the Dlsliisi'cting-Table.
A novel case, concerning the disappear
ance and recovery of the dead body of a
young woman, and illustrating the facil
ity. with which the medical colleges ac
quire subjects for their disinsectiug
rooms, was brought to light recently,
says the Louisville Courier-Journal, by a
reporter acting in the capacity of a de
tective.
On November 14 there died at Hie city
hospital, of tubecu'ar laryngitis. Mis*
Mollie Grace, aged 26 years. The friends
of the dead woman secured the services
of City Undertaker John Hess, and in
structed him to bury the remains in a
St. Louis cemetery. Mr. Hess intrusted
the funeral preparations to one of his as
sistauts and gave no more heed to the
matter. On his way to the health office
to secure a burial permit the assistant
forgot where he was going to bury the
body, or. ns an employe of the city un
dertaker. who plants daily a number of
paupers in the poller’s held, he thought
he was burying one of that unfortunate
class, and. us a consequence, seemed a
permit in the almshouse grave yard, or
potter’s field.
The corpse - conveyed to its resting
place November lit. A few days after
wards some friends visited the St. Louis
cemetery to look at the grave, and were
much puzzled when Sexton John Holland
informed them that the grave was ready,
but that the body of Miss (trace hud
never been brought there for burial. They
at once found John Hess and demanded
to know what disposition had been made
of the remains. Mr. Hess found by in
quiry of the assistant who had charge of
the tune, ... Hi it the corpse had gone to
the potter’* 1.-td. He immediately drove
to the almshouse in company with the
friends of the deceased and the grave
was opened. To Hie horror of all the
collin was found to he empty, not a trace
remaining of the unfortunate girl. The
only solution to the problem was that
ghouls had been at work, and that the
body was within Him walls of one of the
medical institutions.
A reporter learned Of Hie circumstanc
es and at once set about to discover the
body. A casual search through the dis
secting-rooros of the various colleges
failed to disclose any clew to the corpse,
and it. ap[ eared as though it had been
spirited away or so securely hidden as to
defeat all efforts to recover it.
Finally the reporter got a clew, lie
learned that an unuiunlly fine female sub
ject was in the vat of the Louisville Uni
versity of Medicine, or. Eighth and
Chestnut streets; that Hie body was that
of a finely formed and altogether hand
some woman, and that it was considered
quite an acquisition to the institution.
Two men were secured from John Hess’
undertaking establishment,, and with the
reporter soon found themselves at the
portals of the gloomy old mansion occu
pied hy the university.
The janitor ushered the party inside
and afterward into the dissecting room,
where were found some thirty tables oc
cupied by corpses in various stages of
dissection. These were examined, but
none proved to be the one sought for.
The party then made their way to an ante
room where the two great vats are located.
One of them was opened, and with a largo
hook the bodies, thirteen in number,
were brought to the surface and exnroin
ined. They were all of adults, six being
women; but Miss Grace’s corpse was not
among them.
The other vat was opened, and the hook
plunged into the mysterious and discol
ored depths. A body with the hook im
bedded in its shoulder rose to the top and
was pulled to view. It was that of a
woman, and was read.ly recognized as the
n mains of Miss Grace, li was taken out
and placed on a table, where it was found
to be in a perfect state of preservation
and unmarked except where Hie cruel
hooks had mad several jagged wounds
on different parts of the symmetrical
form.
The eyes wi re closed and the face bon
a peaceful expression, quite at variance
with the somber circumstances surround
ing the sad case. No objections were
made to its removal, mid the corpse,
wrapped in a sheet, was removed to u
wagon in waiting, and, after being placed
in a coffin at Hess’undertaking place, was
quitiy buried in fheSt. Louis cemetery.
The relatives of the dead girl were eat
isfied to secure the body in vuch good
condition, and though much outraged hy
the manner in which they had been treat
td, will make no specific complaint.

“Talk about presentiment,” said a
prominent citizen to a reporter, "1 know
of a case coming nailer that head that
strikes me as being the most remarkable
on record, which occurred at Poinsett
County in 1886, and was related by Gen
eral T. C. Hindman, who was canvassing
that part of the state at the time in the
interest of his candidacy for congress.
While in I’oiusatt County he stopped at a
double log cabin on* Sunday morning,
where he was welcomed by an old, gray
haired man who was surrounded by his
wife and a dozen or more children, grand
children, and great grandchildren of
different sizes and ages, who were accom
panied by their parens. The Ceneral
called at the house for dinner, and seeing
such a large crowd assembled inquired

“Dad’s got it inter his head that he's j

us all over here to see him go off. He's ■
over 60 years old, and 'tw >a’t surprise any

He's lived in these parts over 60 years. ;
mid they ain’t nobody ‘round here ns

“About 10:30 o’clock,” said General
Hindman, the old ma i ordered one of his
sons (o wheel an antiquated lounge in the
hallway of (he house, and without any |
difficulty he stretched hinisely upon it.
He appeared to be in perfect health, and
although the eyes of most of the women \
assembled wore red from crying, there I
was n visible cause for it but the nearer i
the hour of 11 o'clock approached the j
louder and more general became the 1

“My dear friends,” said Gen. Hindman 1
in a sympathizing tone of voice, 'I don’t

sorrow. I think you are all borrowing

“Look hyar, stranger," exclaimed one
of his sons, that old man thnr never told

“The boy is all right," said the doctor, |
but you want to talk to him and arrou- e
his ambition. Promise yon will take him
somewhere when he recovers sufficiently
to go out; There are lots of ways in which
you can interest him.”
Then the doctor addressed the boy,
who was just recovering from a fever,
saying:
“Come, Mickey, cheer Up, ny boy,
wouldn't you like to go and play tag with
your playmates
A faint smile stole over the boy’s face,
but that was all.
"Slop, said the father, “I’ll rouse hint.
See here, Mickey,” he asked, addressing
the boy, “wouldn’t yez like to go on* and
throw e. rook through a Chiueyman's wiir
dy ■’
The boy immediately sat up in bed and
asked for his pant s.
“I thought Hint 'ml fetch ’im," said the
father, with a proud smile, “he’s all right j
doctor dear.”

against you and convincing you that life
is tough. They were talking of restaur
ants, and menus, and dishes with extra
ordinary names that don't mean much,
and reveling in gourmet jargon. There
was a well-known gentleman of wealth,
position, and taste present, and several
lesser lights, gas lights emulating by the
aid uf redactors the brilliancy of (hi l idee
trie, so to apeak. There was a fellow
there who was not a gourmet, couldn't af
lord it, and a vague idea of revenge enter
od into his head.
