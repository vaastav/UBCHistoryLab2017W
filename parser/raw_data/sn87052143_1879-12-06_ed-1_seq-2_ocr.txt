THE SALE OP THE NAEECW GAUGE.
An article on the outside of this paper
announces the sale of tho Narrow Gauge
railroad to Jay Gould. After the pur
chase of this road, which was negotia
ted between Messrs. Gould and Holden,
on the way from here to Kansas City,
after the visit which wo announced last'
week, the former named gentleman and
his staff visited Atchison, Leavenworth
and St. Joseph, all of which places he
left in a ferment of excitement as to his
intentions regarding their railroad con
nections. On Wednesday Mr. Gould re
turned to Independence, where a meet
ing of persons interested in the Kansas
City & Eastern railroad was held lor the
purpose ot reorganization. The old
board ot directors all resigned, except
ing Messrs. Howard M. Holden and .
H, Allen. A new board was then chos
en, consisting ot Messrs. a. a. diuuu,
W. Griffith, D. E. Cornell, H. C.
Clements. J. O. Bnnkerhoff. alt ot the
Kansas Pacific directory, and Messrs.
Holden and A.len, as above stated. A
meeting ot the new board was immedi-
tely held, and the following named
officers were elected: President, Ss 1.
Smith; secretary. J. V. Griffith; treas
urer, H. C. Clements. The president
appointed Mr. H. Hale, division superin
tendent of the Missouri Pacific railroad,
as superintendent of the Narrow Gauge,
with Mr. Iviuson, the former superin
tendent, as assistant. It will be seen that
the above is a radical change ot man
agement. The assertion was made at
Kansas City in connection with the sale,
that Mr. Gould had also purchased a
controlling interest in the Lexington
coal fields. This is not true ; but it will
be readily understood that the various
changes which have recently been made
in the ownership of the St. L., K. C. &
N.. the K. P. and the Mo. P. R. R.'s, by
which the ownership of these roads is
concentrated in one person, makes the
question ot fuel one of vast moment.
Mr. Gould has secured control of the
transportation ot Lexington coal because
he knows that tho mines here yield the
best quality ot steam, coal, and at less
expense than any mines contiguous to
his roads. He intends to coal his three
reat trunk lines from this point, and
for that purpose will lay a third rail on
the Missouri Pacific and Kansas Pacific
tracks in and about Kansas City, that he
may run his Narrow Gauge trains to the
various coaling places. Col. .Stephens
stated, to a Sedalia Democrat reporter,
that the Kansas City & Eastern wonld
be extended to Boonville. This we
should like to see done, as the northeas
tern portion ot this county would be
much benefited thereby. If it is done,
however, it should be as a broad gauge,
and we hope that in any event the gauge
will be changed on tho road from this
place west. In any event the one cer
tain indication is that the mines at this
point will be wqrked to an extent here
tofore unprecedented.
THE ELECTION Iff LOUISIANA.
The political campaign ot 1879 closed
in Louisiana, last Tuesday, when state
officers were selected and a new consti
tution was voted on. The state which
was declared by the returning board in
1876 to be a republican state, when it is
permitted to vote for the first time since
1S61 goes democratic by about 30,000
majority , All the dispatches, lrom
whatever source, join in saying that the
election was quiet, free from broils, fair
and honest, and that a great many ne
groes voted the democratic ticket. The
democratic ticket was composed of
Louis A. Wiltz, the present lieut.-gov
ernor, for governor; S. D. McEnery tor
lieut.-governor ; James C. Eagan, the
present asttitant attorney-general, for
attorney-general-; Win. A. Strong, the
present incumbent, for secretary of
state ; Allen Jumel, present incumbent,
lor auditor, and Edwin H. Fay for su
perintendent ol public instruction. The
republican ticket was composed as fol
low3: For governor, Taylor Beattie; for
lieut.-governor, Jas. M. Gillespie; for
attorney-general, Don. A. Pardie, for
secretary of state, James D. Kennedy,
colored; lor auditor, Claudius Mayo ; lor
superintendent ot public instruction, M
Uonzano. The new constitution is
adopted by a heavy vote.
Our good friends at Richmond haye
testified, this week, how thoroughly
they were convinced that the Burling
ton & Southwestern railroad would be
built by Lexington, in their great haste
to go to work when they learn of the
Gould purchase ol the Narrow Gauge,
which they think kills the former pro
ject. They have hold a public meeting
and sent a delegation to confer with the
business men of Kansas City, which was
well received by the merchants' ex
change. Our friends may be counting
their chickens too soon. The Narrow
Gauge does not occupy all the ground
between Lexington and Kansas City,
and we possess another coal vein fully
as accesible and easily worked as the
one on that line a coal vein above the
level of the bottom, sloping toward the
face, needing neither artificial drainage.

PRESIDENT HATES' ANNUAL MESSAGE.
Continued from First Page.
By laws enacted in 1S53 and 1855, and now in
substance incorporated in the revised statutes,
the practice of arbilrury appointments to the
several subordinate grades in the great depart
ments was condemned, and examinations, as to
cupiicity, to be conducted bv departmental
boards or examiners, were provided lor and
made conditions of admission to the public ser
vice. These statutes are a decision by congress
that examinations of some sort.as to aitaiumeuts
and capacity, are essential to the well-being of
the public service. The important questions
Biuce the enactment of these laws have been as
to the character of these examinaiions, and
whether oflicial favor and partisan influence, or
common right aud merit, were to control the
access to the examinations. Ill practice, these
examinations bave not always been open to
worthy persons generally, who might wish to
bo examined. official favorites and partisan
influence, as a rule, appear to have designated
those who alone were permitted to go belore the
examining boards, subjecting even the 1 xaniinera
to a pressure from the friends ol the candidates
very difficult to resist. As a consequence, the
standard of admission fell below that which the
public interest demanded. It was also almost
inevitable that a system which provided for
various separate boards of examininers. with no
common supervision or uniform method of pro
cedure, should result in confusion, inconsisten
cy, and inadequate tests ol capacity highly det
rimental to the public interests. A runner aod
more radical chauge was obviously required.
In the annual message of December, 1S70. my
predecessor declared that "there la ne duty
which so much embarrasses the executive and
heads of departments as that of appointments;
nor is tbereany such arduous and thankless la
bor Imposed on senators and representatives as
that ot finding places for constituents. The
present system does not secure the best men, and
olten not even Ut men fur the public places. The
elevation and purification of the civil service ot
the government will bo hailed with approval by
the whole people of the United States." Con
gress accordingly passed the act, approved
March 3, 1871, "to regulate the civil serviee of
the United States anil promote the efficiency
thereof " viDl.if ih. ,t A..u.aum .iith.ii'it v It: thft

Acting under this statute, which was inter
preted as intended to secure a system or lust and
effectual examinations under uniform supervis

were selected for the lmrnose. who entered with
zeal upon the discbarge of their duties, prepar

quirements of Uie service, the regulations con

the money needed for the compensation and for
the x pense of carrying on the work of the com

examinations had been held in various sections
of the country, and that an appropriation of
auuut iu,iw would ue requireu to meet tne an
nua expenses, including salaries. Involved In
discharging the duties of the commission. The
report was transmitted to congress bv snecinl
message of April IS, 1874, with the following
lavorabla comment upon the labors of the com
mission: "If sustained by congress, I have no
aouut me rules can, alter the experience gained,
be so improved and enforced as to still -mora
materially benefit the public service and relieve
the executive, members of congress, and the
neaas 01 departments, lrom influences i.relu.
dicml to good administration. The rules, as they
unve uituerui oeeneniorcea, nave resulted Dene
flcially, as is shown by the opinions ofthe mem
bers of the cabinet and their subordinat. in thn
departments, and in that opinion I concur."
Aim in tne annual message or December or the
same year similar views are expressed, and an
appropriation for continuing the work of the
wiiuiuihiuu again auvised.
ine appropriation was not mane. and. as a
consequence, the active work of the commission
was suspended, leaving the commission itself
stiu in existence, without the means, there
fore, of causing qualifications to be tested in any
systematic manner, or of securing lor the public
service the advantages of competition upon any
vAwuiive piait. 1 recommended in my annual
message of December. 1877. the makinir of an
appropriation for the resumption of Ihe work of

PUBLIC FINANCES.
The attention of congress is called to the annual
report of the treasury on the condition ofthe
public finances.

amounting J.o 4(1. 747, 'UU So, has preveuted the

to tbe sinking fund lor the current year; but
these arrears having been substantially paid, it
is believed that the sinking' fund can btr'ealtsr
bs maintained without any cbange of existing
l.w.
' The secretary of war reports that the war de
partment estimates for the fiscal year ending
June SO, XSSI . are 10,3.-fl,4iS A3, Ihe same being
for a less sum of biouey than Uny aubual esti
mate reudered to congress from 'Chat department
during a period of at least twelve years.
' He concurs wllb tbe general of the at my in
recommending such legislation as will authorize
the enlistment ot the full number of 25,000 men
for tne line of the army, exclusive Of the 3,403
iqen required lor detached duty, and therefore
not available for service In the field.
Ue also recommepds tbat' congress be asked to
provide by law for the disposition of a' large
number of abandoned military posts apd reser
vations, which, though very valuable lo llieiu-
selves, have been rendered useless for military
purposes by the advance aud settlement ol civil
ization. He unites with tbe quartermaster-general In
recommending tbat an appropriation be made
for the construction ol a cheap anil perfectly fire
proof building for the safe storage of a vast
amount of money accounts, vouchers, claims
and other valuable records now in the quartermaster-general's
ollie.aml exposed to great risks
of total destruction by fire. ....
He also recommends, in conformity Willi the
views ofthe ludge advocate general, some dila
tory legislation in reference to the military stat
ute or limitations as applied to Ihe crime of de
sertion. , ,
In these several recommendations I concur.
TUB JETTIES.
Ti.. aenretarv of war further reports, that tbe
work for the improvement of tbe south pass of
the Mississippi river, unuer contract witu oi
Jimu K Eudn. made in pursuance of an act

year, Wltn a greater measure ui ouia.w iu ...
attainment of results than during any previous
year. The channel through tbe south pass,
which, at the beginning of operations in June,
1S7S. had a depth of only seven and one half feet
of water, bad on the 8tb ol July, 1879, a minimum
depth of twenty-six feet, having a width of not
less than 200 feet and a central depth of thirty
leet. Payments have been marie in accordance
with the statute, as the work progressed,
amounting in tbe aggregate to 4,2jO,000; and
further payments will become due, as provided
by the statute. In the event of success in main
taining the channel now secured.
The reports of the general of the army and ol
his subordinates, present a full and detuiied ac
count, of the military operations for the sup-
Bression of bostiiities among the Indians of the
te and Apache tribes, and praise is Justly
awarded to tbe officers and troops engaged, lor
promptness, skill, and courage displayed.
Tbe past year has beeu one of almost unbroken
peace and quiet ol ibe Mexican frontier, and
there is reason to believe tbat the eflbrta of this
government and ol Mexico, to maintain order
in mat region, win prove periuaueutiy suc
cessful. This department was enabled during the past
year to find temporary though crowded accom
modations, and a safe depository for a portion
ot its records, in the completed east wing of the
uullding designeu lor tne stale, war, auu navv
departments. The construction of the north
wing of tne building, a part oi tne structure in
tended for the use of the war department, is be
ing carried forward with all possible dispatch,
and tbe work should receive from congress such
liberal appropriations as will secure its speedy
eomplelion.
THE NAVT.
The report of the secretary of tbe navy shows
continued imurovement in that branch of the
service during the last fiscal year. Extensive
repairs have been made upon vessels, and two
new ships have been completed and made ready
for sea.
Tbe total expenditures or tne year endeu June
. 18i. inoiuuing si-ecllic appropriations not
estimated tor by tne department, were au.uoa,-
710 09. The expenses cbaig able to the year, al
tar deducting the amount of these specific ap
propriations, were S13. 343.317 7: but this is sub
ject to a reduction or i33,7i5 99, tbat amount
having been drawn upon warrants, but net paid
out during the year. Tbe umount of appropria
tions applicable to the last fiscal year was SH,-
538.848 17. There was. therefore, a balance of
1,479,054 37 remaining unexpended, and to the
credit ol the department, on June 30, 1870. The
estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30.16S1,
are S14.8o4.147 95. which exceeds the appropria
tions lor tbe present fiscal year t3Ul,S97 2S. The
reason lor this increase is explained in the sec
retary's report The appropriations available
tor tne present nscai year are si,a z.zou ei ,
which will, in Ihe opinion of tbe secretary, an
swer all the ordinary demands of tbe service.
The amount drawn from Uie treasury from July
1 to November 1, 1879, was $5,770,404 13, of
which 1,093.440 is nas been reiuuaed, leaving
as the expenditure lor that neriod tU.B74.9sa 79.
If the expenditures of tbe remaining two-thirds
of the year do not exceed the proportion for those
lour monws, mere win remain unexpended , at
the end ofthe year,SI77,359 30 of tbe current ap
probations. The report of tbe secretary shows
the gratifying fact that among all the disbursing
of tne pay corps ot tne navy mere is not one wno
Is a defaulter to the extent of a Bin&rle dollar. 1
unite with htm in recommending tbe removal of
the observatory to a more healthful location.
Tbat institution reflects credit unon tbe nation.
and has obtained Ihe approbation of scientific
men in all parts ol the world. Its removal from
Its present location would not only be conducive
to tbe health of its officers an-1 professors, but
would greatly increase its useiuiness.
The appropriation for Judicial expenses, whicb
has heretofore been made for the department ol
justice, in gross, was subdivided at the last ses
sion ox congress, auu no appropriation wnatever
waa made lor the payment of the fees of mar
shals and their deputies, either in the service of
process or lor the aiacnargeot other duties; and,
since June 30, these officers bave continue I tbe
performance ot their Unties witnout compensa
tion from the government, taking upon them
selves tbe necessary incidental outlays, as well
as rendering their own Bcrvice. In only a few
unavoidable instances has the proper execution
of the process of the United States failed by
reason of the absence of the reouisite anbroori-
allon. This course ol official conduct on the
part of these officers, highly creditable to their
fidelity, was advised by the attorney-general.
wno lnxormed tuem, nowever, mat tney would
necessarily have to rely for their compensation
upon tbe Brospect ol future legislation by oon-
gress. I therefore especially recommend that
immeaiate appropriation oe made by congress
for this purpose.
Tne act making tbe principal annronriatlon
ror tne department or justice at previous sessions
has uniformly contained tbe following olause:
And-for defraying the expenses wbicb may be

No appropriation waa made lor this purpose

was a matter ol little practical importance.

The business of the supreme court is. at Dres-
ent, largely in arrears . It cannot be expected
tbat more causes can be decided than are now
disposed of in its annual session, or that by any
assiduity tbe distinguished magistrates wbo
compose tbe court can accomplish more than is
now done. In the courts el many of the cir
cuits, also, the busim ss has increased to such an
extent, tnat tne delay ot justice will call the at
tention ox congress to an appropriate remedy
It is believed that all is done in each circuit
which can fairly be expected from its judicial
force. The evils arising from delay are less
heavily felt by the United States than by private
suitors, aa its causes are advancetl by the courts
wueu tt is seen tuut tney involve tue discussion
of questions of a public character.
1 ne remedy suggested uy tne attorney-general
is the appointment of additional circuit judges.
and the creation of an Intermediate court of
errors and appeals, which shall relieve the su
preme court of a part of its jurisdiction, while
a larger torce in also obtained for the perfor
mance nt circuit duties.
I commend tbls suggestion to the considera
tion OI aoagress. 11 would seem to afford
complete remedy, and would involve, 11 ten ad
ditionai circuit judges are anuointed. an ex-
penditure, at the present rate of salaries, of not
mora than tGO.eOO a year, which wonld certain
ly be small in comparison wiih the obiecta to be
attained.
POSTAL MATTERS.
Tbe report of the postmaster-general bears tes
timony to tne general revival oi uu-iness mrougll
out tbe country. The receipts of the postolllct
department for the fiscal year ended June So.
1879, were 30,041,982 SS, being 764,4C5 1 more
man tne revenues oi tne preceding year. The
amount realized lrom the sale of postage stamps,
stamped envelopes and postal cards was S7s4.-
406 91 more than m tbe preceding year, and .,
SS7.539 23 more than in 1877. The expenditures
ofthe department were 933,449,809 45, or which
the sum of 370,41 63 was paid on liabilities in
corred in preceding years.
The expenditures during the year were $801.
09 77 less than in the preceding year. This re
duction is to be attributed mainly to tbe opera
tion or the law passed June 17, 1S7S, changing
the compensation of postmasters from a commis
sion on tbe value of stamps sold, to a commis
sion on stamps cancelled.
The amoaut drawn from the treasnrv an an
proprlations in addition to the revenues or tiie
department was 03,031 .454 96. being J,27S,HI7
80 less tban in the preceding year.
Tbe expenditures for the fiscal year ending
June M, 1S81, are estimated at $39,930,900, and
tne receipts from all sources at S32.210.000 leav
ing a deficiency to be appropriated for, out of
tne treasury, oi v,tiu,auu.
The relations of Ibe department with railroad
companies have been harmonized, notwithstand
ing the general reduction by congress of their
compensation, by the appropriation for special
lacilities, ami tbe railway postoutce lines bave
oeen greatly extended, especially in the south
era states. The interests ol the railway mail
service and oi tue pueuc wouiu be greatly pro
moted, ana tne expenditures could be more
readily controlled by tbe classification of tbe
employes of the railway mail service as recom
mended by the postmaster-general, the auuro-
prlation lor salaries, with respect to which tbe
maximum limit is already fixed by law, to be
iukui to gross.
'ine postmaster - sreneral recommends an
amendment of the law regulating the increase of
compensation xor increased service and increased
speed on star routes, so as to enable him to ad
vertiae for proposals for such increased service
ano speed tie also suggests tne advantages to
the commerce of tbe country from tbe euact-
ment ul a general law authorizing contracts
with American built steamers, carrying the
American Hag, lor transporting the mail be
tween ports of tbe United Slates and ports of the
west xnuies and aouui America, al a fixed max
imum price per mile, the amount to be expend
sd being regulated by annual appropriations, in
like manner with the amount paid lor the domes
uv star service.
The arrangement made by the uostmaster-
gepera! and the secretary of the treasury for the
collection ol duty upon books received in tbe
man irom ioreign countries, lias proved so sat
ialoctory in its practical operation thai the rec
ommendation Is now made tbat congress shall
extend ine provisions ot tne act ox juarcn 3,

so as to apply to all other dutiable articles re
ceived in the mails lrom foreign countries.
INDIAN AFFA111S.
The report of the secretary of Hie interior and
of tbe commissioner of Indian affairs, setting
fortb th present state of our relations witb the
Indian tribes on our territory, the measures
taken to advance their civilization and pros
perity, and tne progress already achieved by
them, will be found of more than ordinary In
terest. The general conduct ol our Indian pop
ulation has been so satisiaciory that the occur
ence of two disturbances, which resulted in
biooiUluid and destruction of property, is all tbe
more to be laii!eiUe.
Tbe bia'iory 01" the outbreak on the Whjte River
Uie reservation in Western Colorado hai beCo'ue
so familiar by elaborate reports in tbe public
press, tbal its remarkable iucidcnte need not be
statea here in detail. It is expected that the set
tlement or this difficulty will lend to such ar
rangements'us will prevent further hostile cou
tact between the Indians and the border settle
ments ui Western Colorado.
' The otlieV disturbance occurred at the Mcaca
lero agency, in New Mexico, where Victoria,
the head of a small b ind of Ma'raudets. niter
com ultting ninny atrocities, being vigorously f
chased by a military force, made bis wav across ;
tiie aiexican uomer and is now oil ioreign sou
While these occurrences, in which acomuar-
atively small number of Indians were engaged,
are most deplorable, avast majority ol bur
Indian population have fully Justified the ex-
pectations of thoBe Who believe thai by humane
and peaceful Influences the Indian can be led to
abandon the babits of savage life and to develop
a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.
Wjt fiie have already accomplished ju the
pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work,
tbe remarkable succeaB which has attended the
experiment of employing as freighters a class of
Indians hitherto counted among ihe wildest and
most intractable, and I he general and urgent de

et J mend itselt as just and beneficial to the Indians,
anil as also calculated to remove inose wui
lions which the existence of large reservations
presents to tbe settlement and development ol
the country. I therefore earnestly recomnieuu
ihe enactment of a law enabling ine government
to give Indians a title in lee, inalienable lor
twenty-live years, tothe friu lands assigned io
tbem by allotment. I also repeat the recom
mendation made in my lirst annual message,
that a law bepasaeii admitting Indians who can
f;lve satisiaciory proof of having, by their own
abor, supported their families lor a number of
years, and who are willing to detach themselves
lrom their tribal relations, to the benefit of ihe
honiesled act. anil to urant them paleii s cou

exiiedient lo turn over the cavalry barruckn at
Ivarllsle, in I'eliiiBVtvauia.lo tue itneiuu iie,in
mentlor Ihe establishment of an Indian school
on a larger scale. This school has now liis pu
pils, selected lrom vurious tribes, and is iu lull
operation Arrangements are also made tor the
education ot a number ol inuian oojs ami mo
beioiiu-inir lo tribes on the Pacific slope, in a
similar manner, at Forest lirove, in Oregon.
These institutions will commend themselves
to the liberality of congress, aud to the plulau
throuic uiunillceuce ot the American people.
Last spring lnloril.ation was received of the
organization of an extensive movement in the
western states, tueonjecioi wnicu me oc
cupation by unauthorized persons oi certain
lands in the Indian territory ceded by Ibe Cber
okees to the government lor the purpose ol set-
tieiuentcnt py otner inutan triuea.

warninir all tier.tnna strain 1 participation in such
an attempt, and, uy tue co-ope ration oi a mm
tarv force, the invasion was uromntlv checke-t
It is toy purpose to protect the rights or the In
dian inhabitants of that territory to the full ex
tent ot tne executive power, uut it wouiu oe
unwise to Ignore the fact that a territory so
lara-e and so fertile, with a population so sparse.
and with so great a wealth ol unused resources,
will be round more exposed to the repetition or
such attempts as happened this year, when tbe
surrounding states are more densely settled,
and the westward movement ot our population
looks still more eagerly lor fresh lands to occu
py. Under such circumstances the difficulty ol
maintaining the Indian territory in its present
state will greatly increase, auu tue inuian triors
inhabiting it would do well to prepare for sucb a
contingency. I. therefore, lully approve or the
advice given to them by tbe secretary of tbe inte
rior on a recent occasion , to divide among them
selves in severalty as large a quantity of their
lanus as xuey can cultivate, to acquire tuuivmu
al title in fee. instead of their present tribal
ownership in common, and to consider in what
manner the balance ol their lanus may ue dis
posed ot by the government for their benefit. By
adopting sucb a policy, Ihey would more cer
tainly secure for themselves the value of their
possessions, und at tne same time promote tueir
progress in civilization and Drosperity, than by
endeavoring to perpetuate the present state ot
toings in tne territory.
The nuestion whether a change in the control
f the Indian service should be made was in tbe
fortv-flftb conxrrcss relerred to a joint commit
tee of both bouses for inquiry and report. In
my last annual message 1 expressed the hope
that tbe decision of that question, then in pros
pect, "would arrest further agitation of tbls
subject, such aaritalion beiear apt to produce a
disturbing effect upon the service as well us the
Indians memseives." since men, tne com
mittee havintr reported, tbe Question has been
decided in the negative by a vole In the house of
representatives.
For the reasr.ns here stated, and in vtew of the
fact that further uncertainty on this point vtlll
be calculated to obstruct other much needed
legislation, to weaken tho discipline of the ser
vice, and to unsettle salutary measures now in
progress fcr tbe government and improvement
of the Indians. I respectfully recommend that
tbe decision arrived at by congress at its last
session be permitted to stand.
The efforts made bv the department of tne tn
terisr to arrest the depredations on tbe timber
tanos oi tne united states nave oeen continued.
and have met with considerable success. A
large number of cases of trespass have been
prosecuted in tne courts or tne united states;
others having been settled, the trespassers offer
ing to make payment to the government for tbe
value of the timber taken by them. Tbe proceeds
of these prosecutions and settlements turned into
the treasury, far exceed in amount thesams ap
propriated uy congress tor tnis purpose, a more
important result, however, consists in the fact
tnat tne destruction ox our public loresxa uy
depredation, aiuiouim suun cases still occur,
has bean greatly reduced in extent, and it is
probable that if the present policy is vigorously
pursued and sufficient provision to that end is
made by congress, sucn trespass, at least tnose
on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed, ex
cept in tbe territories where timber for the daily
requirements ot the population cannot, unuer
the present state ot tbe law, be otherwise ob
tained. I therefore earnestly invite the atten
lion of congress to the recommendation made
by the secretary of the interior, that a law be
enacted enabling tbe government to sell timber
from tbe public lands without conveying the
tee, where such lands are principally valuable
lor the timber thereon, sucn sales to be so rear
uiuiett as to cotuorm to domestic wants and
business requirements, while at the same time
lrl,ll,,,,uJui1., umuninv H.i.,ti...i nttii.
ulutett as to conform to domestic wants and
jruarding against a sweeping destruction of the
forests. The enactment ol such a law appears
to become a more pressing necessity every day.
uy recommendations iu tormer messages are
renewetl in layer of enlarging the lae-ililiea of
tne department oi agricuuure. Agriculture is
the leading interest and the permanent industry
ot our people. It is to the abundance ol agri
cultural production, as compared Willi our home
consumpti n. anil the largely increased and
nigiuy prumuoie mantel auro-vl wiucn we nave
riijojeu tit recent years, tnat e are luantij in
debted for our present prosperity as a people
We must look for its continued maintenaace to
the Bame substantial resource. There is no
branch of industry in which labor, directed by
scientific knowledge, yiel.is such increased pro
duction in (M in par ion with unskilled labor, and
uo urancn ox tue puiuic service to wnicn ine en
couragement of liberal appropriations cau be
more appropriately extended, the omission to
render such aid is not a wise ecenomy: but. on
the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses ol
immense sums annually tbat might be saved
through well directed efforts by the goverunieul
to promote this vital interest.
ine results already accoinpnsned witn tue
very limited means heretofore placed at the com
mand of the department ol agriculture is an
earnest of what may be expected with increased
appropriations for the several purposes indicat
ed In the report of the commissioner, with a
view to placing the department upon a looting
wnicn win enauie it to prosecute more euective
ly the objects lor which it is established.
Appropriations are needed lor a more com
plete laboratory, for the establishment of u vet
erinary division and u division cf forestry, and
lor tin increase oi xorce.
The requirements for these und other purpos
es, indicated in the report of the commissioner
under the bead ol the immediate necessities of
the department, will not luvolve any expend!
tore ot money that the country cannot with pro
priety unuer take in tue interests oi agriculture
EDUCATIONAL.
It is gratifying to learn from the bureau ofed
cucatioo tiie extent to which educational urivi
leges tnrougnout tne united atates nave oeen ad
vanced daring the veur. No more fundamental
responsibility rests upon congress than thut of
devising appropriate measures oi financial aid
to education, supplemental to local action in ihe
state anu territories, and in tne district ox Co
lumbia. The wise forethought of the founders
of our government bas not only furnished the
basis lor Ibe support of tbe common school sys
tems of tbe newer states, but laid the lounda
tions for the maintenance of their universities
and colleges of agriculture and the mechanic
arts. Measures in accordance with the tradition
al policy for tbe further benefit of all these inter
ests, und the extension ef the same advantages
to every portion oi ine country, it is nopeu. win
receive your iavorauie consideration.
To preserve and perpetuate the national litera
ture should be among the foremost cares of tbe
national legislature. Tbe library gathered at
the capitol still remains unprovided with any
suituute accommodations ior its raptuiy in
creasing stores. The magnitude and impor
tance ol the collection, increased as it is by tbe
deposits made under tbe law of copyright, by
uuiueottc auu ioreign ejtcuuuges, auu uy tue act
entitle library of tne Smithsonian institution
call for building accommodations which shall at
once be adequate and nre-nrool. The location
of such a public building, wbicb should provide
ior tne pressing necessities ot tne present, and
for tbe vast Increase of the nation's books in the
future, is a matter which addresses itself to the
discretion of congress. It is earnestly recom
mended as a matter which should unite all suf
frages, und which should no longer be delayed.
DISTRICT OF COLUJIK1A.
The Joint commission created by the act of
congress of August 2, 1870. for tbe purpose of
supervising and directing the completion ot the
Washington national monument, of which com
mission the president is a member, lias given
careful attention to this subject, aud already the
strengthening of the foundation has so lax pro
gressed as to insure the entire success of this
tiart of the work. A massive layer of masonry
las been introduced below the original founda
tion, widening the base, increasing lite stability
of the structure, and rendering it possible to
carry the shall to completion. It is earnestly
recommended ttiat such further appropriations
be made for the continued prosecution ol the
work as may be necessary for the completion of
this national monument at an early day.
in loruier messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, 1 have taken uccasion to
coti.iqend tocongiesS the adoption of a generous
policy towards ihe District of Columbia. 'Ihe
report of the commissioners ofthe district, here
with transmitted, contains suggestions and re
commendations, to all of which 1 earuestly in
vite your carul'ul attention. 1 ask your curly and
favorable consideration of tiie views which they
express as to the urgent need ot legislation tor
tiie reclamation of tne marshe-t of the Potomac
and its eastern branch, within the limits ot tbe
city, and lor the repair ol the streets ol the cap
ital, heretofore laid with wooden blocks, and
now by decay rendered almost impassable, und
a source of imminent danger to the health of its
citizens. The means at the disposal of the com
missioners are wholly inadequate lor the accom
plishment of these important works, and should
be supplemented by timely appiopnatlons lrom
tiie iederal treasury.
Tile tilling ol the iiats in front of the city will
add to the adjacent lands and parts now owned
by the United Stateo. u large and valuable do
main, kiillicieiit, it is thought, to reimburse its
entile cost, nnd will also, as au incidental re
sult, se. ure the permanent improvement of the
river lor the purposes of navigation.
The colistlliltlon hating invested cnnirrens
with suprciuu and exclusive jurisdiction over
Ihe llistricl of Columbia. Us citizeus must of
necessity look to congress alone ior all needml
legislation alp-cling their inleresfs; ud at, the
I territory of this diottict is the common nrnn. riv
ol the people ol the United states, who, equally
with its resident citizens, are interested iu the
prosperity ol Iheir capital. 1 can nut doubt thai
you vyill oe amply sustained by the gcHeral voice
ot the country ui any measure you may a iopt
for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration of
congress lo the wants ul public schools ol uia
district, as exhibited in the report of the com
missioners. While the number of pupils is rap
Idly increasing, no adequate provisions exists
lor a corresponding increase ol school accom
modation, and the couimiasioners are without
the means to meet tltia urgent need. A number
of tbe buildings now used for school purposes
era reniea, and are, in important particulars,
unsuited for the purpose. The cause of popular
education in tbe District of Columbia is surely
entitled to the same consideration at Ibe hands ol
the national government as iu the several slntel
and territories, to wbicb munillccnt grants of
the pubiio lands have bee.i made for the en
dowment of schools and universities.
