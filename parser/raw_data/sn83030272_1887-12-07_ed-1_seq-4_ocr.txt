The Message Turning Point
i President CLEVELANDS third annual me
Is shorter than document of the
page I aor tha any doument te
fcort that LINCOLN JOHNSON QIUNT HD
f 6r ABTHUB ever sent t Congress
1 I la not n commonplace document for It
la simple Intelligible and coherent and the
k Quality of brevity I chiefly duo t the tat
that a other topics of national Interest a
t dismissed In a lump or postponed nalncon
sequential In tho presence of one problem of
supreme importance the question of tariff
revision
nvon
Mr CLZVELAND estimates that at the end
of the present fiscal year the surplus rev
enue accumulated In tho Federal Treasury
will amount t 110000000 He points out
t the evils attending such a condition of af
fairs and the dangers Involved In a contln
4 ued accumulation of money thus withdrawn
channels of trade
drawn from the canol te
Ho says that every expedient of r
lief that Is clearly within th power
of the Executive h been exhausted for he
does not regard n unquestionable the au
i thority of the Secretary of the Treasury to
r S go Into the market and buy at a premium
r bonds not yet due Under those clroum
S S Btanoes he urges Congress to reduce taxa
L lion t tho necessary expenses of a c
Y nomlcal administration the Government
r i Mr CLEVELANDS advice square and
< S short Is that In attemplng this reduction
IorI tt ths ructon
f Congress should let tho Internal revenue
taxes alone and make the whole reduction
1 aone mae ructon
S by cutting down the customs tariff He de
clares that the theoretical question as
between protection and free trade Is
entirely Irrelevant and yet the most
S j striking and Interesting part of the
i message is devoted t precisely that sort
of a argument with which any free trade
Representative In Congress or any free
S trade professor in a college class room or
the author any free trade textboOk of
political econpmy would begin a attack
r upon the theory of protectionS
This we is the most notable fact
S Th say I mot notble fat
I 5 about tho message Mr CLEVELAND has
never before in a public paper ten aides
squarely upon this question He has done
p eo now in a manner that leaves room for no
i misunderstanding It Is a bold thing t do
and the President deserves credit for the
i plainness of h speech Nobody can accuse
1 him of hedging or haggling or juggling
I
I S with words
So ta does he ao upon the familiar lines
o the free trade speeches to Congress or
elsewhere that we find him betrayed here
I f and there no doubt unconsciously Into a
exhibition of slight Irritation against American
i manufacturers class almost If
can maufatrr n a cll almot n I
they were conspirators and public enemies
The existence of Inter
etnc our manufacturing Intr
t eats he says should not mean a con
r dition which without regard t the public
welfare or a national exigency must always
I Insure the realization of immense
Iu te rton Immene profits
Instead of returns
lt moderately profitable retrs
i Midasflhls carniedtilmalongallttle
Ad 8 I hi pen cae hm along a ltle
fester and further than he bad Intended t
travel the President ads So stubbornly
i nave all efforts t reform the present condi
tion been resisted those of fellow
j Un b rt by to our telow
citizens thus engaged that they can hardly
f complain of the suspicion entertained to
L cmpl to suspicon entrine t a
certain extent that there exists a organized
combination their advantage a along the line t maintain
i te avate
Then Mr CLEVELAND uses the familiar
argument from the census of occupations
I namely that only a comparatively small
part of the working population of the coun
try I directly concerned In the manufactur
ing Interests or employed by them He
Dote the American manufacturers that I
they a asked t surrender something for
te public good and t avert disaster they I
ought to submit not out
ouht t gracefully only of
patriotism but hi grateful recognition of
advantages already afforded And finally
he holds for the of the
warning
hold up te wnlng manu
5 facturers the prospect of a time when a
abased and Irritated people heedless of those
who have resisted timely and reasonable
I relief may Insist upon a radical and sweep
i ing rectification of their
f I rWcton teir wrongs
S Beyond a recommendation of the free ad
I mission of raw materials and the general prin
r ciple that the necessaries of life rather than
S j the luxuries should b affected the Prcsl
lent does not undertake to indicate t Con
reee the specific methods which
tress splo methos upon whch tariff
S reduction should in his
ruon soud h opinion proceed
The message is not too long for busy men
t read and it Is the buy men of tho United
r State that have the greatest interest in
Btt tt hT te gtt Intrt se
lug for themselves just what President
OLXTKUHD Bays In this the most remarka
1 ble and in some respects the most Important
J document that he has produced since his
political career began
The Danger From Ice
determination by Dr PBDDDEN of the
existence of great numbers of the living
I germs o disease in the ice most commonly
I consumed Is a fact of the gravest concern t
S the people of New York and Brooklyn
3 It was obvious that s soon as it was pos
sible to detect their presence with scientific
accuracy such bacteria must b found In
the water of the Hudson River In the vicin
ity from which ice Is obtained
Iy fm our supply I chiefly ob
tamed This Ic Is cut from the river within
thirty miles of Albany and onefourth part
of it within twelve miles where tho water is 1
polluted by the of towns
I plut sewage aggregat
ing a population of something like 200000
S But after the bacilli had been discovered In
the water t a Innumerable extent the
question arose n t whether their vitality
I would b destroyed freezing Dr PIIUD
DEN a man of high scientific reputation
therefore proceeded t prove by the most ex
S hausUve investigations that they existed n
IMn forma of disease in molted ice
for dea I melt lc a pint
i
of which contained on the average by actual
count about 800000 of bacteria of various
kinds As whether thebacterta of typhoid
fever for Instance will retain their vitality
Indefinitely in Ice ho is not prepared t express
opinion Tho longest period during
press an opiion To longet pr durng
which they have been kept frozen Is 103 days
but that I long enough for them t b
found in a great port of the ice consumed in
this neighborhood
These a fat about which them can b I
no question for they have been scientifically
established Neither it bo doubted that
estblihe Neiher con I b doubt thnt
there is danger of infection from ice contain
ing the living germs of typhoid fever The
public therefore have need t bo n watch
ful over the source of their Ice supply as over
that of their water supply Yet as a matter
of fat much of tho ice consumed hero Is cut
from streams and ponds who water no
prudent community would venture t drink
Dr PntJDDEN Br for instance without
hesitation that the water of the Hudson
Diver in tho vicinity from which our princi
pal Ice supply I obtained should not bo used
p drinking purposes without careful filtra
tion and yet wo drink i Now York nalco
water In which a large part of its original
bacteria a t be found in a living state
What then are tho practicable safeguards
against such a danger 7 Dr PKUDDEN sug
gests that the State Board of Health should
have control over the Ice harvesting fields
with power t determine whether they are
safe or unsafe sources of supply S far
that body has not displayed a capacity for
useful effort which encourages us t hope
much from It i any now direction but un
questionably there should b a system of
rigid inspection by somo competent authority
The Military Court
There were 11130 trials by court martial
last year a but a score or two being those
of enlisted men in an army only 25000 strong
One of the leading occupations of tho ser
vice must therefore b that of trying offend
ers It is true that D 9 of the cases wore
heard hi garrison and regimental courts
only still since 0289 of these resulted In
convictions record of delinquencies must
b sufficiently long Some offenders wore
UD several times but about six thousand dif
ferent enlisted men were tried at least once
each during the year
Yet the record compared with former
ones shows improvement The previous
year had yielded 12207 trials the ea b
fore that 13834 a remarkable number The
present decrease is especially gratifying in
the trials by general court martial which
havo dropped t 1640 against 1933 for the
previous year and 2323 for the year before
that I is fair to note that many of the
cases before inferior courts are those of com
paratively ting broaches of the regula
tions some Involving no moral wrong I
the chief recommendation made by Acting
Judge AdvocateGeneral G NORMAN LUE
should b carried out namely that of
confining the Articles of War t a single
military penal code and carefully grading
punishments so that they will no longer
vary according t the set of officers happen
ing to b detailed for the court there might
b a still further reduction In the number of
trials In any event there would be a grout
gain for justice in the substitution of fixed
and known penalties for arbitrary ones
which may b in some cases the fruit of Individual
dvdu prejudice and hi others a doubt
less considered even I they are not There
would probably less discontent among en
listed men with the administration of
lt wt te amInitation justice
in the army were a definite scale of punish
wherever ments adopted committed uniform for similar offences
But the most remarkable suggestion of
the annual report of Col LIEBEB IB after
all one derived not from the body of tho
document but from its signature namely
that a deputy Is still performing the duties
of the titular Judge AdvocateGeneral of the
Army because this high functionary him
self Is now serving out a twelve years sen
tence of a court martial less than three of
which have expired That the army should
b left nine years longer with only an act
ing head for its department of justice would
seem strange Tho sentence of
sem stange sentnc suspension
passed upon Gen Swat was made by
the court just long enough to
te cur enoulh t carry
him before its expiration t the retired
tired list for age n he will b G years old
In December 1896 This suspension I upon
half pay and the curious predicament results
suits that I I he were t b retired at once in
order to cut the knot ho
orer t knot would be raised t
threefourths pay Whatever way out of the
difficulty may b adopted the present posi
tion of an army with its highest law officer
under sentence for twelve years and with
a the duties of his office performed by
Is

Are tho Hopes of Ireland Dashed
According t the London Tory papers and
such London correspondents of Now York
journals n reflect their opinions the present
Parliament will last till the summer of 1892
and meanwhile the Home Rulers are advised
t strike their flag By that time Mr GLADSTONE
STONE will have ceased it is expected t b
a political factor and his personal following
will be dispersed since It be held
dipred can 0 together
gether neither by any of his faithful lieuten
ants nor by either of the chlet Liberal dis
sentients Lord HABTINOTON and Mr CuU
BEnLAiN So that neither In the near nor
in the distant future can these prophets of
evil descry a ray of comfort for the friends
of Ireland
But we have noticed that a party in power
Is apt t b peculiarly confident and Jubilant
during a recess of Parliament The
durng re Parlament perils
of surprise and ambush of mutiny deser
tion and pitched battle are over for a while i
and all tho victors have t do Is t extol each
others prowess blow the thorn and pound
on the big drum Wo seem t remember
just such exhibitions of elation and
jut oxlblton elton ad compla
cency on the part of Mr GLADSTONE and
his colleagues In the recess which preceded
tie cession of 1885 They to had a majority
of a hundred behind them and having
hLL L uU 0
weathered the squalls of dissension caused
by the FonaTEit Coercion act and the storm
of indignation excited by the failure of the
attempt to rescue GORDON they felt sure
that they could look forward to smooth
water and clear skies Within a few months
however they were out of office their ma
jority shivered on a question of detail whose
emergence had not been foreseen and whose I
fatal capacity for mischief could not have
been divined And yet tho Liberal party in
18S5 while numerically quite as strong was
far more homogeneous and much less likely
to split on questions whether of principle or
detail than is the mongrel coalition that
now controls the House of Commons
Five years would be n long period for LIb
erals like Mr CirAMBEHLAIN and Mr JoHN
BRIGHT t dwell in pace and amity with old
fashioned Torleswhoaro free traders against
their will and ostensibly progressive only for
strifro effect It would 0 a long period even
though wo were assured that during the
whole of it the Irish question would monopolize
monop
lize attention in the House of Commons But
it is certain on the contrary that many another
other question already mooted or on the
I
verge of suggestion w b pressed b
public clamoron the heed of Parliament and
will become In its turn the hinge of contro
versy and the wedge of disruption A party
cannot live by hat of Ireland alone much
less a a coalition Neither will tho British
empire with It manifold and urgent inter
ests and aspirations consent for five years t
stand still while Lord HABTDCOTON and Mr
COsUiBXitLAJN are Intently waiting for Mr
GLADSTONES shoes Disputes more dan
gerous t tho Unionist combination than
any discussion of tho treatment of unhappy
Ireland are close at hand and by two at least
of tem the flimsy alliance between Liberals
and Tories scorns likely t b wrecked
There for instance is tho local govern
ment reform which Lord SALISBURY has
bound himself t bestow on tho municipali
ties and counties of England Scotland and
Wales How Improbable it seems that Lord
SALISBURY and the uncompromising Tories
who at present control the Cabinet and the
House of Lords will with regard t county
administration and the expropriation of land
for municipal purposes propose or ratify
concessions suoh n could b accepted by
Mr CHAMBERLAIN and Mr JESSE COLLINOS
in tho face of their repeated professions and
pledges What chance is there of a bill on
such subjects emanating from the present
Premier which shall oven remotely corre
spond t tho promises put forward by
Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL hi his Da
ford speech Then again what
for spch may
not b tho outcome of tho strong reaction
against free trade which was s unmistak
ably disclosed In tho recent mass meeting of
Conservatives at Oxford Duties on Im
ported grain and cattle t protect the Eng
lish farmer and duties on Imported manu
factures t protect and compensate the
English artisan such is already the outcry
of twothirds of the Tory rank and file and
it can only be a question of time and of a
short time when the outcry takes the form
of a Ministerial programme Whore then
will seceding Liberals like JOHN BRIOHT b
found JOHN BRIGHT whose angry com
ment on the Oxford demonstration was that
the dogs were returning t their vomit
The weapons In fine a forging that will
how apart the coalition which counts upon
a five years term of life The landed Inter
est which Is now preponderant Is not more
determined t refuse home rule t Ireland
than i Is resolved within Great Britain itself
to minimize all concessions t the spirit of
democracy und progress la the sphere
of local government and by a now Im
position of duties on imported food
products to replenish the revenues
from its impoverished estates Irishmen
therefore should bo for little
therfore b patient yet a lte
while seeing that their opponents in the
flush of overconfidence and under tho spur
of cupidity ore rushing straight upon de
feat There Is but one thing at this juncture
that might truly blight the hopes of I
lads well wishers and postpone for five
years a now general election and that Is an
explosion of wild and barbarous revenge
He Must Move On
There is no respite from the Worlds men
dacity Not content with deceiving and
tricking the public wit a fictitious summary
of the Presidents message i has the brutal
insolence t say that the President deliber
ately changed tho message so that it should
differ from the Worlds previous account of
it This characteristic exploit gratifies
PULITZER
The thing that does not gratify him how
ever is the insensibility of the public t h
cajolements and the resentment Instead of
appreciation with which they receive a fine
stroke of genius like PULXTZEBS own ver
sion of the hanging of the Anarchists PU
LITZERS own resignation of GREVT and PU
LITZERS own Presidents message Instead
of applauding him they drop him and into
that hand which closes with such a startling
snap on tho fugitive they

without remorse that makes futllo his proj

honey and points at him all the time that
merciless finger whose dread significance I

political morality of Congress Ha points out
clearly that It can only b reduced by increased
expenditures or by the reduction of taxation
Tho later is of course the only statesmanlike
method H e proposes tariff reduction substan
tially upon the raw materials of Industry This
Is the policy which I recommended In 1883 and
and every year subsequently in bills which I
introduced or in speeches which I made upon
tho floor A Ux upon raw materials I an ob
stacle to the growth of business Thrfreduc
don of the tax ententes the fund for tho tiay
mentof wanes and therefore it is to the interest
of worklncmon that raw materials should not
T do not think it quite BO necessary to take
off tho taxos upon manufactured products because
or
cause domestic competition may 0 rolled upon
to give to the consumer the benefit of tho reduction
duction of tax upon raw materials Tho only
exception to this rule Is In those branches of
business in which pools can ba formed They
are very few in number and In thoso cases a
Ter
reduction in the duty on the manufactured ar
tlclo is Imperative Otherwise the manufac
turers ot those special products have it in their
power to tax tho community to the whole ex
tent of the duty levied upon the competing ar
ticle Besides demagogues will use tho reduction
duction upon manufactured products as an
argument why the wages of the worklngmon
must nocopsarllr b reduced to correspond
with the reduced duties There Is nothing In
this argument nnd wo might very well follow
tho example set by Great Ter which freed
all the raw materials of Industry from taxation
long before it abolished the duties upon tho
manufactured products
I regard tho general propositions of tho
massage as very clearly and forcibly stated al
though 1 do not think that tbo T ago earners
are forced to part with any considerable por
tion of their earnings in consequence of the
higher rates of duty upon what they buy The
cost of living in this country Is at tho present
time lower than In any other civilized country
Farmers who may bo regarded OH wagn earn
ers in one sense certainly do pay an enhanced
cost upon their tools and other supplies but
they receive a compensation In the general
diffusion of manufactures throughout the
country I mako this statement upon the as
sumption that the tariff Is necessary
for manufactures to live In this country but
this is only true of a very few among tho num
her I do not believe that the higher rule of
wages paid in this country is duo to tho tariff
Higher wages oomo from superior natural re
sources and a tariff may bo necessary there
Celnr
fore In consequence of thoso higher wages In
order that particular branches ot industry may
oxlst I Is a simple question of tho distribu
tion of labor in the several kinds of Industries
Under the natural eyntftn men will employ
themselves In that which pays bust Under
the artificial system they will engage In every
branch of Industry which can par un equal
rate of wages I believe in I diversified Indus
try especially for a country like ours and I
think wo can afford to make somo eacrlllcps to
secure it In other words that tho compensa
ton which we got In the steady employment of
men and In the improved civilization mOM titan
balances the Increased cost But whether this
view Is sound or not we are I manufacturing
people and I fully concur In the Iruftldents
recommendation that no legislation ought to
be had which will tend to restrict the area of
Industries and I think that tho necessary
reduction In taxation can bo mado ncOSlrJ
without disturbing the favorable conditions of
Industry but with I decided benefit to every
country branch which has established Itself in this
