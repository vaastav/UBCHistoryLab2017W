THE CITY.
NORTHWESTERN FREEDMEN’SFAIR.
OPENING DAY,
Ervan Dali In Its Gayest Attire—The Stalls—
A Peep at their Contents—The Dinners.
ZiOCtnre on “General Grant and the
War,” by J. S. C. Abbott.
The Great Northwestern Fair for the benefit of
the Frccdmcn waa opened yesterday in fret—the
theoretic opening was made on the previous even
ing. Bryan Ball assumed Its gayest colors yester
day; it was coronation day. The Hall was seized
upon at early dawn by an army of willing workers,
under whose active manipulations order soon grew
tmt of chaos. It was sot possible to commence
(belabor of filling and arrangement earlier in the
week, because of the pro-occupation by other par
ties, and so tbo herculean task of building np the
Fair fabric was crowded into the space of a few
hours. All through the morning the busy din was
board above and below stairs, a* the contributions
from all parts of the Northwest came rapidly pour
ing In. By noon they assumed a tangible shape.
The appearance of the ball last evening although
especially to be commended, should not be taken
as a fair indication of wbat it will be when all the
goods are opened and properly distributed. Some
of the more valuable and costly fabrics, contribu
tions from Extern cities aud elsewhere, will be
unpacked to-day, and by to-night will have taste
ful arrangement.
The Fair will be the great attraction of the sea
son, and should induce extended patronage. The
projectors have a most humane object in view, and
they desire the assistance of those who are willing
to do good, pay for a reasonable pleasure at the
same time.
TUB SECRETARY.
The Secretary's desk is stationed just north of
the entrance to the hull, and is the scene of con
siderable internet. Here is kept a list of the con
tributions, the estimated value, and the names of
the donors.
6ELATZ6.
Adjoining the Secretary's desk is a table devoted
to the sale of skates. Here those who are fond of
the; poetry of motion—on ice—cuu gratify every
reasonable wish in that direction. There are
skates richly and plainly trimmed, bright and
glittering like a a woman's eyes—skates costly
and skates cheap—skates strapped, and skates that
are not all of the latest and mostiaahlonable stvle.
Buy them.
ALUUM9.
There is no end to the variety of photographic
albums offered for sale. They comprise every
style and price known to the trade, and can be
purchased of the ladles as cheaply,as at any estab
lishment in Chicago. Give the Freedman's Fair
an opportunity to make the profit you pay to other
dealers.
On the stage were grouped a large and miscella
neous array of articles of the more solid kind.
There were drums numerous enough to lead a
whole army of juveniles to the mimic strife; car
riages and mimatnre boggles for a regiment of in.
fonts; sleighs piled highin air; rocking and otb.
er horses by the score; flags in profusion; wicker
work, artificial flowers, and smaller toys too
numerous and diversified to mention.
MISCELLANEOUS.
A long tabic extends along the hall directly in
front oi the stage. Ibis is covered with an infi
nite variety of merchandise, the contributions of
Chicago donors. These consist of pincushions,
wax work, shells, dolts, children's clothing, em
broideries, gloves, mittens, silver ware, etc., pre
sided over by beautiful women, whom to sec and
talk with is worth more than the price asked for
the goods.
the POST OFFICE.
This ancient end venerable institution stands in
the northeast comer of the ball. Owing to the ex
treme seventy of the weather, the males have be
come exceedingly irregular of late, and the prctiy
post mistress lost evening had no epistolary favors
to dispense. The office will be in running order
to-night, and young gentlemen and ladies who call
may be assured of receiving tender missives.
moiuL.
In the geographical center of the hall Is what is
called the Floral Department It is handsomely
arranged and tastefully decorated, and, although
the display was not remarkable lust evening, tne
presiding Caines of the grotto informed our re
porter that they would he prepared to dispense
the choicest floral treasures to-night If they re
deem their gracious promise, the Floral Depart
ment will be Welt worth looking after.
WTSCOA'SIK.
Judging from the beautiful display in the de
partment belonging to our sister State, the fin
gers of her fair daughters must have been uncom
monly busy during the last few months. The Wis
consin tables occupy the eastern side of the hall
and are arranged with great taste and beauty. On
this tabic was an excellent collection of photo
graphs, the contribution of an artist from the dty
of bricks; a something looking like an Iraraene
pin cushion, but which the lady In attendance said
was a sofa pillow; cushions for needles and pins;
baskets of fruit in wax; a wondefal combination
of silk, satin, needle work and skill which was
said to be a bonkcrcnief holder—whatever that Is ;
a silk bag forty yean old sold at the first Freed
men’s Fair ever held in England, and contributed
by an English lady for this Fair; a broebe shawl
and an evening robe of elegant and beautiful de
sign, each worth SSO, and contributed by Sherwin
£ Co., of Milwaukee; fresh boquets handsomely
arranged; a department devoted to the sole of
crockery, glassware and tabic ornaments, and a
wonderful piece of worsted work, valued at S3O,
representing the dead Christ. This tabic is under
the supervision of Mrs. Love, of Milwaukee.
CHICAGO
Tills table is in tbc charge of Mrs. M. Morse, of
Chicago, and to those who delight in the elegant
and costly trifles ’’which decorate the heads of
Chicago’s fair daughters, will prove most attrac
tive. indies will eay the bonnets are "perfect
gems,” and “ perfect loves.” and similar non
sense. Crusty imchclors will give this table a
wide berth, and old cormodgeon* of husbands will
strive to draw their letter halves away from them.
There Is a hat m the cosCTlhe lacc (riming upon
which alone cost more than $25. The price of the
article is (30, and the saleswoman told our re
porter that it was richly worth the money. Think
of this ye who contemplate matrimony.
DETROIT.
The ladies of Detroit pride themselves upon the
excellent display their contributions make, and
justly so. The goods on this table invoice nearly
£I,OOO, and they hope to realize much more.
Mrs. Leggett and daughter preside. There is upon
this table an exceedingly rare and rateable col
lection of ancient and venerable books, among
which onr reporter noticed the following:—Works
of Ben. Johnson, edition of 1G40: Hlt'.ory of the
Quakers, American edition of 1701; Fisher's Tes
t imony of Trnth, London edition of 1679; Memoirs
of Lieut. Gen. Ludlaim, London edition of 1751;
Friends Testimony concerning Geo. Fox, edition
of 1R»4; Seneca's Works, 2 vols., edition of IG'iO.
Besides these there arc garden seeds, lamp mats,
Parian. Euuscsn and lava vases; shells in infinite
varieties; corals, toys, scarft. Lake Superior
agates, several bcantital croups in clay, modelled
attar lingers, among these “’The Friend in Need,”
“The Gamp Fire," and “The Refugee;” furs,

OTTAWA.
Mis. Bristol and Mrs. Nottlngcr presided over
the Ottawa table, which is covered with fanev
goods, children's clothing, fancy wares, jutlntings
and worsted goods. TTiedUplavlsaveiy credita
ble one and attracted considerable attention.
COLORED AID SOCICTT.
The Colored Aid Society have two tables, one
devoted to the sale ot fancy goods, and the other
to the sale of confectionary. - Both were liberally
patronized.
There were several sewing machines, and agri
cultural implements in the body of the Hall.
Among the host of beautiful things presented,
the Afghan quilt is worthy of special mention. It
is the work of six young ladies residing In the
West Division, the material being furnished by
an equal number of gentlemen. It is a magnifi
cent piece of work, and should be seen by every
one visiting the Fair.
The refreshment tables in the rear of the hall
were liberally patronized. The arrangements lor
giving meals in the lower ball were scarcely per
fected yesterday, though a great many patrons of
the Fair took meals at noon and in the evening.
We arc informed that the tables will be in full
running order to-day, and will groan with the
choicest viands that can be procured. There will
be undoubtedly a first-class attendance at the
tables from this noon thereafter.
We shall publish the full list of donors, but arc
unable to do so in this issue, for the reason that
goods are constantly arriving and the Secretary's
books Is constant requisition.
7JIE VETEEAN RESERVE COUPS BANDS.
It !s fine to the two military hands at Camp
Donates to say that they have both volunteered
their services at the Fair. The band of the 15th
V. K. Corps will be present during the entire
week, end the band of the Bth alter ft ednesday.
'throughout the evening the splendid band of
the liihV.lL C., wo» in attendance, and by Its
correct rendering of some choice patriotic airs,
much enhanced the enjoyment of the evening.
BOARD OF FOLICJE.
The Secret Session—Explanation* and
Dcutelu—Other ISualucss.
The Board or Police Commissioners held a regu
lar session at their room yesterday. A full Board
vfte in attendance.
Commissioner Wentworth said that the newspa
pers ba-1 published reports of what purported to
foe a meeting of the Board held on the ICth insL
He Ft ..ted that be was called upon by the Secretary
of Hie Board, and served with the following order:
Office Board or Police CosotissioKEtts, I
Cuicaou, Dee. IS, ISM. f
Hon. John Wentworth, Police Commissioner:
Sir: There will be a special meeting of the
Board of Police Commissioners to-morrow (16th).
at 10 o'clock a. m. Your attendance is urgently
requested, as there will be business of importance
before the Board. Yours respectfully,
A. C. Covektut, Pres'L
Per R. Scott, Sec’y.
He asked Mr. Scott hie authority, and he pre
sented the following order;
Chicago, Dee. 13, ISM.
Mr. Scott will issue notices to all the Police
Commissioners, that there will be a meeting of the
Police Commissioners to-morrow morning atlo
o'clock a. nu, and prepare notices and deliver
them this afternoon, and personally request their
Attendance on business of Importance. This he
will not communicate to any member of the police
force. By a direction of the majority of the Board.
(Signed,) A. C. Covxymr, Pres.
fiw utterly opposed to all public business
done In secret, he denounced it. Therefore In
stead of keeping the matter secret bo notified any
one and every one he met. lie informed the con
ductors of the press that a meeting was to be held
and invited them to be present As an honest
conscious public man, he could do no less. The
Commissioners did meet, butcoutrary to the news
paper statement no business was transacted, no
vote was had, no subject was voted up or voted
down. The newspapers have teemed with denun
ciations of himself and Mayor Sherman for voting
against the suspension of certain officers whose
conduct is now undergoing a Judicial examina
tion. _ .
The law requires that before an officer can be
suspended the charges mast be made in writing,
and upon evidence the Board con proceed to
try or suspend. „ , ,
Section seven of the act creating the Board of
Police, which may be found on page 109 of the
city charter, has the following provision;
“Provided— That no person shall be removed
therefrom except upon written charges preferred
against him to the Board of Police, ana after an
opportunity shall be afforded him of being beard
In uis defense. But the Board shall have power
to suspend any member of the police department
of the dty pending the hearing of the charges pre
ferred against him.”
No such evidence was before this Board. Not a
-scrap of paper bad they seen complaining of the
conduct of these officers, or asking their suspen
sion. Without this the Board was powerless to
act. When buy one who feels that the public Is
.allowed to suflcrwll! come forward with their writ
ten complain, the Board must act upon it. Until
iitn the attacks upon a portion of the Board were
'"pKaWtnt Coventry explained. He wiled the
TTiJctlm’ upon commltaUon with Commissioner
Srmm and Mavor Sherman. Bow the newspa-
SrecoUhelr Information he cotUd not tell. Ue
rSd accn no reporter or editor, and knew nomine
of thedinum) throne* which the alleged report
Brown Slid that he was In favor
ofprivate meetings of consullation, bnt not In fa
vor of secret business meetings.
The resljmtion of Chris b treble was taken from
the table, uommlssJoner Wentworth znored that
it be accepted. Carried.
Charge* were preferred against Frederick Bow
er, a police officer on the west Division force, for
drunkenness, disobedience of orders and general
inattendance to duty. After a hearing of the evi
dence be was discharged for disobedience of or
ders.
Commissioner Wentworth asked If there wera
any charges preferred against other members of
the force.
The President said there were not.
Mr. Wentworth then said that be deeired the
public to be informed by the reporters that the
Commissioners were not derelict of duty, bnt
were willing to act upon all and every charge
against tbc probity and honesty of the members
of the police force, when that charge shall be
property brought before the Board from their ac
tion.
On motion of the several members, a number of
men were added to the police force.
On motion the Board adjourned.

BEFO RE JUSTICE STAFFORD.
Just as the examination before Commissioner
Hoi ne was concluded, and while the parties were
leaving the room, Mr. Kenney was again arrested
by Constable Alvord upon a warrant issued by
Justice Stanford, based upon the affidavit which
appeared In yesterday's Tribune. He was taken
to the Justice's room and examined. The testi
mony ofIL J. Cress, the complaining witness, was
in no material sense different from that sworn to
In his affidavit, and for that reason is omitted here.
The following was the evidence elicited on his
cross-examination.
I came to town Saturday evening, from SL Cath
erines, C. W.; luma monied man. and am on my
way to Canton, HI.; 1 read in a Chicago paper of
the arrest of Kenney, and I concluded tuat I would

left the room and saw btorer; Hathaway toldSto
rer that 1 was the one who was arrested with him;
we all went up into Storer's office; W. b. Fclkcr
drew up my affidavit, and was in Siorer's office at
the time 1 first saw him; it was at Hathaway's sug
gestion that 1 employed Felkcr to draw the affida
vit; never knew Hathaway until I was arrested
with him: Iwas arrested by officer Reed while
buying a ticket for Buffalo; was searched and
£750.25 found upon me; I think the money was
taken ia charge by the Superintendent; saw Ken

ney and complainant; the complainant was
brought before me upon a charge preferred
against him for larceny, and discharged; there
was no evidence produced Justifying his holding
Cress to bail; they told me the witness in the lar
ceny matter was out of town, and they would be
unable to get the testimony; I think it was Ken
ney who told me this; saw the pocket-book con
taining the money; i examined ft; found one £SOO
bill, and one £IOO bill, and other bills, as sworn to
by cress. _
Frank rtcorn— Arrested Cress at the Cen

the prisoner was discharged, and Brown gave him
the money; Kenney and webh went away to a gal

The testimony on the cross-examination did not
differ materially from that on direct examina
tion.
The Justice decided to hold Kenney to ball in
the sum of SI,OOO, to await the action of the Grand
Jury. The prosecuting witness was also held In
the sum of SOOO.
Ciuticai. Sctgicai. OraEATioN.—Onr attention
has been called to a very remarkable Instance of
restoration to sight after entire loss of vision for
ten veers. Hie facts of the case arc as follows:
Hr. Bobert WclUver, of Andrew, Jackson county,
lowa, met with a severe accident, about ten years
ago. which resulted in blindness, one eye hav
ing run out, and the other being seriously muti
lated, so that after a time bis mends sent the
voung man to the lowa State Institution for the
Blind, where be remained five years.
About two months since, bearing of the restora
tion of a friend who bad been also blind, be came
to this city, and, although .not a very promising
case (the colored part of the eye having been sev
ered by the accident), a surgical operation was de
cided on and performed by Dr. J. B. Walker for
the removal of an opaque lens and the formation
of an artificial pupil. This was successfully done
at one sitting, ana the result Is that the patient
can now see to read, and is no longer dependent
on his friends. The Doctor has also- inserted an
artificial eye on the other side, and the appear
■c.' of the face Is now natural and plearing.
Air. Welliveris staymgat No. 273# West Ran
dolph street and will be happy to answer inquiries
respecting his Interesting case.
No branch of medical science is more progres
sive than ophthalmic surgery, and Dr. Walker is
known and recognized, as one of the most dili
gent students and successful practitioners of this
Important branch of the healing art. The case
we mention most be very gratiiylng to all parties
concerned. This is not the only case wc might
mention where the Doctor's skill has been con
spicuous. As an oculist he has few equals.
At Cost.— Graves & Irvine, No. 73 Lake street
announce that they have had consigned to them
by a large importing house in New York, a splen
did «dock of fancy back combs which they will of
fer dnrln£ the present and coming week at Now
York cost. All wishing to purchase this class of
articles for Holiday gifts or for personal use will
do well to Improve the opportunity offered by
Graves & Irvine.
Elegaht Testzhokials.- The Board of Enroll
ment of the Sixth Congressional District of Wis
consin, have been made the recipient of one of
the pleasantest features of the draft we hare yet
heard of, in the presentation from the several
county officers, of some superb testimonials, yes
terday on exhibition at ono of our first Lake street
jewelry houses, that of Giles Bros. & Co. The
gifts are two costly American gold watches and
guards, the former engraved with the seventeen
names of the donors. In addition to these there
were an elegant wine castor in solid silver, and a
soperh cola-hcadcd cane. All the articles were in
the best style of this well-known boose, who arc
fetting a reputation os wide as the Northwest
teclf,for the elegance and richness of their pre
sentation goods, most of them of their ownmikc.
New Cliorcli Organs,
The well-known New York organ builder, Ur.
Henry Erbcn, who supplied a number of organs
for different churches in this city, among which is
the well-known organ in the SU Paul's Universal
-Ist church, Bor. Dr. Ryder's, is now engaged In
constructing a large one for the SU Xavier's
church, at St Louis, of sixty stops, at a cost of
*13.000.
A new organ, of Mr. Erben's manufacture, has
just been put np in the Cathedral at Memphis. The
blowing apparatus is so arranged that one man can
blow both bellows, and afford an ample supply of
wind. The Instrument has three sets of keys, and
two and one-third octaves of pedals, twelve stops
in the great organ, ten stops in the choir, eleven
stops in the swell, five stops in the pedal, and nine
mechanical slops. Itis contalncdmagolhiccass,
thirty-seven feet high, twenty-five feet wide, and
fifteen feet deep; has over two thousand pipe),
and was built at a cost of eight thousand fire hun
dred dollars.-
Mr. Erben's list of instruments bnilt by him
reads almost like a directory of the finest church
edifices In the country. Every (great organ is an
educator of the public musical taste, and it Is
worthy of remark, as an evidence that Memphis is
still in the list oflivlng cities, that a noble Erbcn
organ has lust been completed there. Mr. Erben's
fume is national, and well-earned by his services
in the cause of music, in the spccialty.be has
made hi* own.
Artesian Well.
Wc have Just visited the new Artesian Well of
the Chicago Oil Company, abont three miles west
of the lake. This company have been boring far
oQ since December last, of which they had abun
dant Indications in the bituminous limestone at
the surface. They have discovered small quantities
at varying depths from 50 to 500 feet, but no pay
ing quantity as yet With a perseverance worthy
of all commendation, however, they have pnshed
their investigations to a depth of over 700 feet;
bnt latterly, while working their drills at the
depth of 708 feet from the surface, the rod sud
denly sunk about 16 feet, and the well at once be
gan to overflow with water, pouring out with
great force and deluging the whole surrounding
region.
Ibis water is now flowing at the rate of about
400 gallons per minute. It rises five feet above
the surface, end was yesterday earned op 12 foot
by a rude experiment with store pipes; with
tubes properly adjusted, to.be applied in a day or
two, it will nodoubtbe carried 2U feet above the
surface or about 45 feet above the lake level. The
bore is five inches in diameter, aud the capacity of
the well is not less than hulf a million gallons
drily.
The water Is very pare and clear, of a slightly
sulphurous odour, its temperature Is about 53
deg. Fahrenheit. It flows one in the cold atmos
{there clear as crystal, and runs off in a stream
arge enough to carry a small mill. It forms a
most pleasant contrast to the dead level of the
prairie, and will be of great service in beautifying
the Wert Side with delightful fountains.
This discovery seems very opportune, and we
commend it as a Providence to all who seek to
reform the lllih of our water. The abundance of
the supply and the force which brings it to the
surface will doubtless be adequate forall the wants
of the West Side. It is about a mile and a half
from the West Side reservoir and coold readily he
connected with It and replace the foul and poison*
oas water, rank with death, now dealt out to our
citizens, we trust that early and earnest atten
tion will be riven to this new source of supplying
our city with wholesome water. It will be years
before the tunnel can be completed and it is still
very doubtful whether it will work any permanent
improvement in our water if completed success
fully. R. D.
Mr. G. A. Shofeldt, Jr., writes to a contempo
rary as follows:
“ The flow, as nearly os it can be measured just
now. is 400callons per minute, 24,000 gallons per
hour, and 576,000 gallons per day. If this be cor
rect, this well Is now discharging more water than
any other artesian well In the world. That of Cre
nelle, in France, which has a bore of one foot at
the surface, reduced gradually to six inches at the
bottom, and is 1,606 feet in depth, discharges 600,-
000 gallons per twenty-four hours.
“Were the diameter of this well increased to
one foot, which can he done by reaming, the dis
charge of water would l>e more than quadrupled,
or over 2,000.000 gallons per day. It would not
take many wells of this size to supply Chicago
with pure and wholesome water. Judging from
the force of the discharge only, and in the absence
of any practical experiments to tost the fact, I
think the water will rise between 73 and 100 feet,
and, as the land Is over 30 feet above the level of
It becomes within the bounds of possibility to sup
ply our people with water without resorting to the
expensive machinery of the present plan of opera
tions. In view of this fact, the slurs and sneers of
Ignorant scribblers pass away with the wind.”

Westers Hall Clothing House and its
Bard.— Everybody In Chicago and the entire
Northwest has heard of this famous establish
ment Yet there ere few of that number who are
aware ol the Immense business it docs. From the
time its doors are opened m the morning until
they close at night, it is more or leas crowded
with customers, often so densely as to resemble
an auction mart. Some persons would attribute
the extraordinary success of J. H. Smith £ Co. to
“ t lnckbut they have certainly deserved success
from other causes They are largo advertisers.
But others have advertised just as largely and
done less. Their success is most probably owing
to the fact that they always fulfill their promises.
When they advertise to sell at “5 per cent advance
on cost for 30 days,” their bills of purchase al
ways hang on file exposed to view of customers.
Persons who come in doubting, upon seeing the
fine fabric, cxccllcntworkinansh!p,andlow prices
of garments exposed for sale, invariably purchase,
ana go away to recommend their friends to go and
do likewise. Now they are out in a flaring bill
(see in another column) offering—inagfftlottcry—
a splendid lice of gifts ranging from SO cents to
£150.00 to every purchaser during holiday season
(from Dee Cth to Jan. Ist,) of any amount over
£S. The consequence Is that everybody who
needs anything In the clothing or furnishing lino
goes to “Western Hall ” to get it, because, In ad
dition to buying their goods cheaper than they
could at any other house, they are sure of a gift
of at least half a dollar, and a chance of £l5O.
Hundreds of our young men are suddenly remem
bering that they need under clothlngor some such
thing to the amount of $5, and off they post to
“ Western Hall,” to buy their goods and try their
luck. Now a few words to the Bard and we will
leave the subject for the present to the public,

reward of their energy andllberallty. Tuc Bard

Finance, reported tho House bill to extend the
Umc allowed for the withdrawal of certain goods
therein n.,mcd from the public stores, which was
passed.
Mr, WILSON, of Massachusetts introduced a
bill to Increase the number of cadets at the West
Point Military Academy. It provides, that here
after the President shall appoint. In addition to
the number already authorized, two cadets from
each State, and fifty from persona who have served
not less than ono year in the army. No person
shall be admitted who Is leas than 17 or more than
SO yean of age. The standard of admission la
raised by an Increase of studies, In which appli
cants for admission must be proficient. Tho bill
was referred to tbe Military Committee.
Mr. GRIMES, from tbe Naval Committee, in
troduced a bill to create tho office of Vice Ad
miral In the Navy. It provides that the Vice Ad
miral shall be selected from the active list of Rear
'Admirals, and shall be the ranking officer of the
United States. His relative rank with officers of
the army shall be that of Lieut General. His pay
shall be $7,000 per annum when at sea, $6,000
when on shore duty, and $6,000 when waiting
orders.
On motion of Mr. GRIMES, the bill was Imme
diately considered and passed.
Mr. HARLAN, of lowa, Introduced a resolution
instructing the Committee on the District of
Columbia to Inquire into tho expediency of re
quiring all residents of the District of Columbia
to take and file with the Provost Marshal of said
District an oath of allegiance and fidelity to the
Government of the United States, similar to the
uatb required by law of Senators and Members of
Congress, and other officers of the Government,
and to prohibit all persons from dofrm business in
said District who shall not take said oath. The
resolution passed
Mr. SUMNER, of Mass., from the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, reported the following substitute
for the Bouse resolution providing for tho termi
nating of the Reciprocity Treaty or June Dth, ISSI,
between the United Stales and Great Britain:
Whereas, As it ig provided In tho Reciprocity
Treaty, concluded at Washington, June fith, ISffl,
between tbe United States on the one part, and the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on
the other part that the treaty shall remain In force
ten years Jrora the date at which it shall go Into
operation, and further, until the expiration of 12
months after either of the high contracting parties
shall t,lro notice to tho otner of its wish to ter
minate Ihesame; and
Whtoeas, It appears by a proclamation of tho
President of tho united Stales, bearing date the
16th of March, 1855, that the treaty came into ope
ration on that day; and,
Wheueas, farther. It appears that it Is no longer
for the interest of the United States to continue the
same in force; therefore,
J’raolcfd by the Senate and House of Represents*
tices of the Untied States of America, in Congress
assembled, That notice beglvenof the termination
of tho reciprocity treaty, according to the provi
sion therein contained for the termination of the
tame. Tbe President of the United States is here
by charged with the communication of such notice
to the Government of tbe United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland.
On motion of Mr. SUMNER, the above was or
dered to be printed,
Mr. WILKINSON, of Minn., offered a resolution
declaring that whereas our prisoners in the bands
of the rebels had been inhumanly treated, badly
clothed cud subjected to exposure, &c., therefore
the Secretary of War be instructed to extend a
like treatment to rebel prisoners In our hands.
Mr. Wilkinson explained that it was not mainly for
the purpose of retaliation that he desired the pas
rage of the resolution. It had been stated by the
rebels that the prisoners' turned over to us in ex
change would never be flt to enter the service
again, while their prisoners released from con
tincmcnt in the North would be flt for service im
mediately. He wanted the resolution passed for
the purpose of preventing the rebels from gain
ing advantage over us in the Held.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Md., objected to the resolu
tion, and it lies over.
Mr. POWELL, of Ky., desired to call up his re
solution asking for information as to the cause of
the arrest ol Lieut. Gov. Jacobs and Col. Wol
ford. Mr. Powell addressed the Senate on the
subject of his resolution. Gov. Jacobs had been
spirited away to he knew not where, and Col.
Wolford was in jail in Covington, Ky. He thought
the Senate owed it to itself to call for Information
as to what offense there bad been committed.
Mr, WILSON was opposed to calling up the re
solution. There was a bill of far more Importance
which be wLhcd acted upon—a Mil to free Hie
wives and children of colored soldiers.
Mr. GRIMES hoped the Senators would call for
information as requested by the Senator from Ken
tucky. He had no doubt the information would
completely vindicate the President and his Cabi
net irom the charges made by the Senator from
Kentucky, and he did not propose to sit with bis
aims folded and bear the representative of Ken
tucky in the Senate talk of such deprivation of
personal libertv.
Messrs. BAVIS, JOHNSON, HOWE and HEN
DFItSON also took part in tbe discussion, after
which a vote was Liken and tho Senate took np
the resolution.
Mr. WILSON. ofMass., moved to amend by ln
aerting “ifnpt incompatible with tho public in

Bison, of Conn., would he Chairman on the Dis
trict of Columbia cife Hale resigned, and that Mr.
Hale would supply the place of Mr. Foote on the
Jodciary Committee.

ing for Information as to the quantity of lands
soul unnur fbc-treaty with the Sac and Fox In-
Indlacß, what price was obtained, and what op
portunity the people of Kansas had to compete In
the purchase of said lands? The resolution was
adopted.
Mr. WILSON called up the joint resolution to
free the wires and children of colored soldiers.
Mr. DAVIS, of Ky., opposed the resolution.
Pending the discussion on this subject, the Clerk
of the ilo'nse announced the non-concurrence of
the House in the Senate's amendment to the bill
to establish » Bureau of Freedmon’s Adairs.
Mr. SUMNER moved that the Senate insist on
its amendment, and appoint a Committee of Con
ference on the subject, and it was so ordered.

BOWEN, of the iCOlh illiauli* He feil like a
true hero. In the thickest of the light, mortally wound
ed, and survived but a short lime. His remains were,
sent to hla bereaved family al Wilmington, ro ichcd
there on Wednesday I. st, and were Interred ou Thurs
day. Our County Court was a-ljouroedou the day of
the funeral by Judge Rarrlj, out of respect to the de

Thus another of the bravo young men who went out
with the noble 10 Hi bus f.tlcu.
Major Bowen was the only sou of Dr A. W. Bowen,
of Wilmington, nnd was a young man of bMch pro
mite. He formerly, with h.a parents, resided In this
city, and before leaving here, th-mrii quite young,
h’.u (eubllshed an admirable reputation for purity of
life, manly conduct, und all those virtues that enobie
the young. He was Indeed one of the most unexcep
tionable young men of onr acquaintance. Shortly af
ter becoming a resident of wi,tQlngton he united in
marriage with a riauEht**r of Dr. Todd, of Rockville,
and entered loro business with bla father. When the
100 th regiment was raised he was among the lint to
ruiiit, and was chosen Captain of thoemlorcompany.
Upon the death of Col. Bartleson and resignation of
Lieut. Col. Waterman, ho was promoted to the posi
tion of Major, which he ttlledwlib honor and fidelity
to bla men and, onr noble Sag until ho received bis
death wound. Like his gallant leader. B.«rtl«son, he
had recovered from a severe wound and returned to
duty but Co fall again, never to rise. The bereaved
