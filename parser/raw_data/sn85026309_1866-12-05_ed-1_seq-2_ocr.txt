The President's Message.
Thi Animal Messtga of the Presi
lent t the opening f Congrtw, was
printed sent to distant places in advance
of the cession, to be used as toon w the
telegraph announced that it was delivered
toCongreM. Aa acwa as the reading began
-io-Cengrtgo, iVifty compositors in th
Statesman office, tgan to pat it in type,
sl ia three hours more, it vat far sale
in the atreeta.
The Message ia well written and is
dignified paper. Its recommendations
are judicious, except as to Mexico. Most
people will perhaps approvo the govern
meat action in regard to Mexico and
Fraoee, but we do not.
The Heeeage opens with a reference to
the restoration of government at the
Sot lb and he nnres that the ten States
sow exclnded from Congress should be
admitted to representation 5n it. The
case is ably put and will gain the assent
ct all persons except the Congress Usurp
ro and their unreasoning supporters.
lie gives the usual account of the
Debt, the Treasury, and the Post Office,
ftll of which be deems prosperous, and
lie commends a course of measures which
shall look to the resumption of specie
payments. What that course of measures
ebould be, will be a subject of as mncli
SBoertainty, as it will be to foretell what
the measures will be.
The profligate squandering of the pub
lic lands to railroad companies, is noticed
and he advises that in future, the title
in not pass until the companies shall
fcave made portions of the roads intended
to be aided.
It seems that our government had made
tome agreement with France that she
should withdraw her troops from Mexico
in three divisions part in November,
1866, and apart in 1867. This was none
if our business, bat it will suit the notions
of many.. Fraeee has not withdrawn
any troops in November but purposes to
withdraw all at once next year, which i?
wise, for she ought not to withdraw a part
and leave a part to be captured. There
upon Mr. Seward sent 19,000 dollars
worth of cable despatch protesting against
the delay and the President sends our
Lient.-General to Mexico to look about
which may cost something more than
cable despatches, and male the green
backs and bonds as plenty as they will be
uncertain in value.
To My Congressman, "So-called;"
Dear Ma. Jackass: So you have
repealed the law, " so-called " which was
passed to let Mr. Lincoln know that the
President had power to pardon people
You have done a good deal of foolery
and still got along, but My Dear Jackass,
ean assure you that there are some bounds
to people's contempt. Are you such
ninny as to think that you can take away
the President's power?
Be careful of your ears and preserve
them long and soft.
' Yours, truly,
TOM. KOPPERHEAD.

The President's Message will be de
livered to-morrow to both Houses -of
Congress. atl P. M., by Colonel Robert
Johnson, The Private Secrotary. Within
an hour from that time it will be issued
fh full from the offices of the leading
journals of this country. There will bo,
therefore, no violation ot tr.ith. nor
promise in anticipating a few hours its
salient and important points ra toe loi-
lowing correct synopsis :
The Messacre opens, as usual, "Witn
thauks to Providence for the peace and
prosperity in the abatement of the pesti
lence and the restoration of civil author
ity throughout the United States.
A review is then had ot the tacts set
forth in the last message, relative to the
measures which the Executive had taken
for the gradual restoration of the South
ern States to the' Union, such as appoint
ing Provisional Governors. &c. Only
one thing then remained, the message
says, to be done, and that was the admis
sion of the loyal representatives to Con
gress. This question was devolved solely
on Congress. In the meantime, the
President says, no other plan having
been proposed, be continued his efforts
to perfect a restoration throngh the judi
cial, revenue, and postal systems of the
country.
'. The South had also ratified the amend
ment abolishing slavery, conformed their
sorial laws to the fact, repudiated the
rebel debts, and proceeded in good faith
to legislate for the amelioration of the
colored races. ..
The President then speaks as follows:
" Congress, however, yet hesitated to
admit any of these States to representa
tion, and it was near the close of the
eigth month of the session that an ex
ception was made in favor of Tennessee.
I deem it a subject of profound regret
that Congress has thus far failed to admit
to stats the loyal Senators and Kepresen
tntives from the other States, wherein
the inhabitants, with those of Tennessee,
had engaged in rebellion ; ten States,
more than one-fourth of the whole nnm
ber. remain without representation. The
seats of fifty members of the House and
twenty of the Senate are yet vacant, not
by their own consent, not by a failure
of election, but by the refusal of Con-
Tess to accent ineir credentials.
" Their admission.it is believed, would
have accomplished much toward the re
newal and strengthening of our relations
as one people, nad removed seriou3 cause
for discontent on the part ot the people
of those States. It would have accorded
with great principle enunciated in the
Declaration of American Independence,
that no people ought to bear the burden
of taxation and yet be denied represen
tation. It would have been in conson
ance with the express provisions of the
Constitution, that each State shall have
at least one Representative, and that no
State, without its consent, shall be de
prived of equal suffrage in the Senate.
"These provisions were intended to
secure to every State the right of repre
sentation in Congress, and so important
was it deetued by the framersof the Con
stitution that the equality of Srates shall
be preserved in the Senate, that nnf even
by an amendment of the Constitution
can any State, wi'hout its consent, be de
nied a voice in that branch of the Na
tioiinl Legislature.
''it has been assumed that these States
by rebellion became Territories, but all
departments of the Government with
ireat distinctness, refused to sanction an
assumption so incompatible with the
nature of our Republican system, and
the professed objects of the war.
Throughout the recent legislation of
Congress, the undeniable fact 'mnkes
itself apparent that these ten political
communities are nothing less than States."
The President then quotes the Crit
tenden resolutions or 1861, on the object
of the war, and reviews the legislation of
Congress wherein the states are recog
nized, and also in Lincoln's proclama
tion. He then proceeds again, as follows
"In the admission ot Senators and
Representatives from all the States there
can bo no grounds of apprehension thnf
persons who are disloyal will be clothed
with the powers of legislation, for this
could not happen when the Constitution
and laws are enforced by a vigilant and
faithful Congress. Each House is the
judge of its own members. A Senator
or member may be admitted or rejected,
or his credentials referred to a proper
committee. If admitted to a seat, it
must be one evidence satisfactory thathe
possesses the requisite loyal and consti
tutional qualifications. If refused ad
mission, and sent to his constituents for
want of due allegianoe, they are admon
ished that none but persons loyal to the
United States will be allowed in the
councils of the nation, and the power
and moral influence of Congress are thus
effectively exerted in the interest of loy
alty to the Government and fidelity to
the Union',
"Upon this question, so vitally affect
ing the restoration of the Union,' and
the permanency of our form of govern
ment, my convictions, heretofore ex
pressed, have undergone no change, but,
on the contrary, their correctness have
been confirmed by reflection and time.
, " If the admission of loyal members
to seats in Congress was wise and expe
dient a year ago, it is no less wise and ex
pedient now. If this anomalous condi
tion is right now if in tho exact condi'
tion of these States at the present time,
it is lawful to exclude them from repre
sentation, I do not seo that the question
will be changed by the effect of time.
Ten years hence, if these States remain
as they are, the right of representation
will be no stronger and the right of ex
clusion will be no weaker.
" The Constitution makes it the duty
of the President to recommend to the
consideration of Congress such measures
as-he skill deem expedient. I know
no measure more imperatively demand
ing the consideration of national interest,
sound policy and equal justice than the
admission of loyal members from the
unrepresented States. It would consum
mate the restoration, renew visor and
stability, and induce emigration, and
opeu new fields ef enterprise."
- The President concludes on restoration
by repeatiug the warniugs of others
against a consolidated despotism, and
does not mako the slightest reference
the pending constitutional amendmeut,
nor to the much-talked of amnesty and
suffrage question.
