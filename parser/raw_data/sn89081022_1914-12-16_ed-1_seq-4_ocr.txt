OniCIAL FAFEB OF KAJTDXTOSX COVITTT AND CITY Ol" WHiZMAJK
WILLMAR, MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1914
The fact that the canvassing com
mittee in the Queen Contest at the re
cent Benson Exposition threw out the
subscription vote of the Fergus Falls
Journal has been commented upon ex
tensively in the press, with so many
inuendoes and charges of bad faith
directed towards the officers of theand
West Central Development Associa
tion that we are led to make the fol
lowing comments in order that the
newspaper boys of the district may
know the other side and if they feel
so disposed remove any false impres
sion which they may have unwitting
ly created.

found necessary a few weeks before
the contest closed to throw out votes
represented by old stock subscriptions
paid because it would give one or two
counties an undue advantage. The
canvassing committee, of which the
writer was chairman, were obliged to
pass on several questions relating to
newspaper votes after the count be
gan. The committee worked hard,
we are sure every member of the
committee did their best to be fair
and impartial.
The Fergus Falls Journal handed in
a bunch of votes aggregating one and
a quarter million, representing their
subscription receipts since Sept. 1.
This was the only daily in the district
and the committee members as well
as officials of the Association, who
were consulted with, felt that Otter
Tail county had in so many ways the
advantage over all the other counties
in size and population that it would
not be fair to allow the daily in the

The principle is the same. If a person would try to light the dark
rooms by making more electricity instead of turning on the switch, you
would call him crazy.
This is what most people do with their bodies. They take everything
and do everything to try and make apart of their body do its duty when
it is really cut off from the source of supply.
Pressure on the nerve caused by a subluxed vertebra (bone) of the
spinal column shuts off this supply to the organ or tissue just as pushing
the electric switch shuts off the supply to the light globe.

competition. Technically this was an
injustice to the Fergus Falls Journal,
particularly as there was no way in
which to separate the receipts for the
daily and the weekly. But on the
other hand to admit the vote was a
moral injustice to all the other candi
dates and weekly papers of the dis
trict. Otter Tail county has a dozen
weekly newspapers besides the daily,
about twice as many as any other
county in the district, and had the
contestant really entered into the spir
it of the contest and hustled as did
the girls in other counties instead of
depending on this "windfall" to carry
her thru, she would easily have out
distanced the other candidates and
the contest would have brought the
same benefit to the weeklies of Otter
Tail county that it did to the weeklies
of other counties. The small amount
of cash turned in for stock and the
small amount of votes turned in by
the weekly papers of Otter Tail coun
ty proves the truth of the above con
clusion. If you were judge in a race,
and one of the horses which outclass
ed all the others were given the addi
tional advantage of a half mile start
in a mile race, what would you do
about it?
As it turned out, the Otter Tail con
testant would not have won the con
test even with the vote of the Fergus
daily, but this was not known when
the committee voted to throw out the
votes. The people of Otter Tail coun
ty have nothing to gain, either one
way or the other, in nursing a grouch
on this matter.
North Dakota has appropriated $50,
000 for the purpose of erecting a ter
minal elevator in the hope that it will
help the grain growers of that state
get a square deal in the marketing of
their products. The Equity Exchange
hopes to get the new elevator located
at St. Paul. The Equity farmers gath
ering at St. Paul last week was an en
thusiastic affair and reminds one of
the Farmers* Alliance which was so
strong about twenty years ago. The
movement is particularly strong in
Chippewa county, and the delegation
from that county had the Montevideo
Boy Scout Band of fifty pieces with
them to emphasize their enthusiasm.
"From the first we had a clear and
settled policy with regard to military
establishments. We never had, and
while we retain our present principles
and ideals, we never shall have, a
large standing army.
"If asked, are you ready to defend
yourselves? we reply, most assured
ly to the utmost and yet we shall
not turn America into a military
camp. We will not ask our young
men to spend the best years of their
lives making soldiers of themselves."
The above words from President
Wilson's message find a response in
the hearts of all true Americans.
Why Not?
Prohibition prohibits when the gov
ernment starts out to enforce it. It

years to wake up the government to
the fact that one-sixth of Minnesota is
dry territory, according to the treaty
of 1855, but it has got wise to the
fact, and woe to whoever tries to make
it otherwise. What is to prevent the
people of this state from making the
rest of the state dry also. They can
do so if they wish.—Montevideo

ADVANTAGES AT SMALL COLLEGE
Leading Wisconsin Citizen Tells Stud
ents at Hamline His Views in
the Matter.
St. Paul, Minn., Dec. 14—"If I were
to choose again a college in which *o
take academic work, I should go to
a small institution," said A. P. Nel
son, banker at Grantsburg, Wis., and
vice-president of the board of regents
of the state university of Wisconsin
Mr. Nelson said these words recently
at chapel at Hamline university, from
which institution he was graduated in
'97.
The attitude toward the small coll
ege taken by Mr. Nelson is that of
many authorities on higher education.
His utterances are of special interest
to high school students who contem
Dlate entering some college after grad
uation.
Mr. Nelson stated that one of the
reasons for preferring a smaller coll
ege was that the physical development
was much more easily acquired in a
smaller college than at a large univer
sity, irrespective of the money and
attention paid to athletics in the larg
er places of learning.
"The influence of the faculty is an
other thing to be considered in choos
ing a college. The students at the
small college receive at first hand, the
contact and personal touch of the fac
ulty members that after all is one of
the real investments in college life
Personally, I would not take one-third
of my education so far as scholastic
training is concerned for the influence
that came to me from faculty mem
bers.
"Is it not true that in institutions of
three or four or five thousand stud
ents, the individual is lost in the mass?
Only here and there a shining exam
pie may come to be a leader. You
have here at Hamline the possibility
of developing a larger number of
leaders in life's great battle.
"What the world today needs more
than anything else is an educated
manhood and womanhood who are not
only strong in mental grasp but who
have developed that grasp that makes
men real brothers and sisters. The
primary thought of education is to be
come givers and not getters. What
we need is the idea that we are to
srive. The world will remember the
giver long after the getter is forgot
ten."
