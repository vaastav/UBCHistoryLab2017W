From the Sew York Tillies, Dec. 3.
When lWiilent Clevelnnd reinstated Dis
trict Attorney M. K. llentim of Missouri ho
liml lieen leil to lielicvo liy tlie "frnnk tone"
of Jlr. licnton's letter of Nov. 10 that sus
lnsioii from office was too severe n jmtiish
Inent for tho oil ense of hich ho had been
guilty. The long printed list of engage
ments to niiilto iHilitionl speeehes, sometitnes
twice n day, in different pnrts of tho Rtate
of Missotiri. had not lieen filed liy Mr. llen-
I ton, nml he assured tho Tresiilent tlint ho
hud not neglected his oflial duties to fill
the dozen or more engagements which ho
had kept. In his letter rescinding the or
der of suspension the President said: "I
did not intend to condemn the making of n
siliticnl speech liy a federal ofliciul to his
neighlmis and friends, nor nt any time ami
place where it was merely incidental, iflhr
Hjiin-li ilirlf IfiM Ofirlll ilnitfillr.
It now appears that District Attorney
Hellion fuilcd to tell the President tho whole
liuth, nml the omissions of his letter are
most grave and vital. For instance, he
failed to state that his i.pecch at (lallatin
Daviess county. Mo., on Oct 11, continued
the following passage :
"I don't airree with President Cleveland
in everything. I don't Miete in his civil-
service humlniirirerv. I do Kdieve in gen
nine civil-service reform, hut 1 don't want
men under ine to work every nmceivalile
dislu'e to defeat lue and tllV laity at the
next election. Hut he lielieves it, and he is
a ui.iii ol iron nerve
District Attorney llenton likewise mndo
no mention of thc-o fnither utterances nt
the (lallatin meeting
"I don't agree with Mr. Cleveland on the
silver nuestion. lie was raws! cast ol the
Alleghany mountains, nml he gets his ideas
from that recion. lie never lias neen west
of lluffnlo. He gets his ideas on
I nance from tlie irolil lull's of nil street,
who once demonetized Kilvernnd had it (the
dollar! stricken from the eoinnire act clan
destinely and without the consent of the
people. ' He learns his timiucinl tlnstries
from Wall street, the leeches which suck
the honest lilissl of the veomnnry of tl
west like Mimpiies. That's where Mr.
C eveland L'cts his ideas of iiuauce. hell
he w rote his giatuitous letter on the suliject
of silver comaire. even Is'fore he was mail
unrated as President, he illustrntisl where
he L'ot his ideas ami he struck a Mow ut the
West in the interests of the lsmdholders
and money sharks, and 1 felt like sinking
down in my Issits; lmt when Heagau of
Texas and others stissl up in their dignified
manhi . si ntul wrote to him that he was the
executive and not the law -making jsiwer,
and I saw these Democrats battling for their
rights and the rights of the jicoplo against
his assumption, 1 rejoiced again that I was
a Democrat.
Our authority for these extracts from Dis
trict Attorney Kenton's seech nt (lallatin
letter from Mr. llliam T. Sullivan,
editor of the North Missourian, a weekly
newspaper published at Gallatin, to Col.
William A. Stone, whowas lately stissMided
from the ollico of United States District
Attorney for Western Pennsylvania. Tl
entile letter is piinted on our first jsige
this morning
If iiiiii investigation it shall prove that
these utterances have Irhmi truthfully and
accurately ieHirtisl from Sir. Kenton's
speech, the Piesident, it seems to us, can
have no choice hut to dismiss Mr. Pcuton
iuiinediatelv and ignoiuiniously from tl
federal service. In his letter refusing to re
instate Col. Stone the President said :
"I certainly siipsised that his Stone's
sense of propriety woulil cause
political inflnelico with Congressman Ryan
and Scnntor Cockrell, had worked through a
special pension hill after Its rejection in tho
pension ofl'ice, and said that Cleveland ve
toed it. Ho then detailed how the claimant
enmo to him nftcr reading notice of tho
veto, and after inquiring about the status of
the claim said to Col. llenton : "Cleveland
caught up with us, didn't ho I" And Col.
llenton .gave this as all average specimen
of pension legislation, saying i "The claim
was a notorious fraud, and the claimant
know it."
In other words this man llenton, whom
the President tnado such haste to put back
In office, calmly explained to his hearers
how ho helped put through a bill for n pen
sion which ho knew all the time to be a
fraud I Mr. Sullivan s letter closes as fol

A recent Ohio despatch says that a letter
addressed to a prisoner in tho Cleveland
workhouse in that state was oiened by an
officer of the institution, found to contain
money, and laid away in the safe until tlie
prisoner's term should expire. When ho
was released tho management forgot to
givu him the letter with the money, and it
remained in the safe until traced through
the st office, when thenlsive state of facts
was disclosed. The attention of the United
States authorities hero having been called ti
this case, the question has lieen freely dis
cussed whether tho practice of opening let.
ters addressed to prisoners, which is com
mon to most if not nil ienal institutions, is
not a violation of tho United States law
concerning the sanctity of the mails. At
the request of the jsistniaster, Assistant
United States Attorney S. o. Dislge lias
given him a written opinion on the subject.
It is a long review- of tho luws on this and
kindred points, and concludes with the
statement that no prison official lias the
right to open a prisoners mail.
The Wrl.Il.cl,linrd Illurk Troop.
A year or two ago the colored tnsips in
tho regular army distinguished themselves
by their marksmanship, one of their infan
try regiments standing at the very top of
the army in the year's shooting, while an
other w as only a little lielow it. Now tho
colored regiments have won new laurels in
different field. Tho Twenty-fifth and
Twenty-fourth infantry come out alsive all
the whito infantry regiments in the matter
of desertions, the former losing only two
men from this cause and the latter only ten
for tho entire year, although tho infantry
average, even when lessened by their own
low rate, is nearly Mil. In the cavalry the
same fact is disclosed. Tlie Tenth loses but
12 men from desertion nnd the Ninth but
lit, while the cavalry average, including
these two, is nearly 51, and no white regi
meiit hail as low u numln'r even as the Ninth.
The record of the Twenty-fifth infantry
would bo considered extraordinary in nl-
most any army.
Jeremiah Youngnt Danielsonville, Ct., also
make statements similar to those of the
brother nt Itockville.
The latest outi ago on the Chinese w as
peretraU)d in Texns. A few days ago a
gang of 50 masked men took jiossession of
a station on tho Texas ami Pacific road in
habited by Chinamen. Tho Chinamen were
hanged by their cues in order to make them
give tip their money, and after they had
delivered what they thought would secure
their release one of them was tortured by
being held on n hot stovu until the rest re
vealed the hiding place of the money w Inch
remained.
The French republic presents a strong
contrast to our own in its iuci easing debt
and expenditure. The government feels
every year the increased pressure of the
interest charge and of the ordinary expend
iture, and yet is frequently betrayed into
fisilish and expensive ventures like those ill
Tonquiu uud Madagascar. From these and
other causes, it happens that France now
has a totul debt of uls.ut $.,200,(K)(),000, or
twice as lurge as that of the United Stntes
at the close of the wur and six times as
large as our present interest-liearing debt.
The French debt is nearly $'JIH jier head of
her population, while thut of the United
States is less than $211 lwr bend. There is
an interest charge of $140.(KH),()00 a year,
besides annuities uud other burdens not
cleai ly stated, amounting to nearly as much
more. The annual revenue wrung from
the ssiple is i(Ml),000,000, and yet that is
insufficient to meet tho necessities of the
government. The foundation trouble is th-
immense military establishment which the
country must keep up to hold itself on an
equal fisitiug with other Kuropeun powers.
The fellow who attempted suicide hy
jumping Iroin the linsiklyn luiuge, am
tailed to tlo more man uuri nimseii un
leasantlv. has done the public a service by
lemonstrating tlie insignificance of the feat
if those who jumiicd for fume. Kirnimj
llevtml.
Very true. Hut the sad fact remains that
still another fisilish fellow , this time "a com
mon lalsirer," juiiqicd olf last Satuiday on
a wager of $25, struck the wuter like
stick, and came out all right.

Ciieiiokee Nation, l.T. f
To tho Cherokee people : I.et us again,
publicly confess and commemorate the gissl
ness of tho Great Spirit by devoting one
day in this year to thanksgiving in unison.
It is a good custom, and should impress up
on our minds a truth that every one ought
to realize more nnd moro as the days and
hours succeed each other in our short lives.
That truth is, that everything we have
comes from liod, and that everything i'
good and w ill be profitable to us, even as
we regard and tieat it, for the due observ
ance of our duty to our common Father
anil our brothers. Therefore :
1, D. W. Hushyhead, principal chief of
the Cherokee nation, do now upi"iiut Thurs
day, the 25th day of November, lfcfcO, ns a
day of general thanksgiving and praise
throughout this nation, and recommend to
nil Cherokee to "keep ' the said anniver
sary soberly, gladly and lovingly as befits a
reasonable and unrlstinn peopiu so to no.
Should there lie issir and unfortunate in
any noighWInssl, forget and neglect them
not. Our system ol society nnu govern
ment will not allow of excessive individual
wealth, nor of its sure nttendant exces
sivo poverty for w hich let us givo sjiecial
thanks and hold last to that which is goon.
Hut what is called accident or misfortune
will ever present optMirtllllities to the gen
erous and vigilant in well doing to do acts of
benevolence. May me next Itianksgiving
lav find us. as n nation nnd ns individuals,
more prosperous and happy for having kept
this one.
In witness whereof I hereunto set my
land and uflix tho seal of tho Cherokee nn-

The iHints nt issue in tho much-vexed
imistiun of the Canadian fisheries have not
made satisfactory progress toward adjuht
tnent. The I'resident is nincerely desirous
that the friendly relations with Canada
should be maintained which our "propin
quity, community of language nnd occupa
tion nnd similarity of jwliticnl and social in
stitutions" call for, but tlie action of the of
ficials of that country during the past sea
son towards our fishermen has been such ns
to seriously thrcuten their continuance.
Although disapiHiinted in his efforts to se
cure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery
question, negotiations are still jiending with
rensonalile hope that liefore the close of
the present session of Congress announce
ment may be made that an acceptable con
clusion has been reached.
One of the President s recommendations
in regard to our foreign relations is that
suitable help le extended to the weak re
public of Liberia to enable its people to re
sist the encroachments of their stronger
neighlsu-s. 'It cannot 1 forgotten, he
says, "that this distant community is mi
offshoot of our ow n system, owing its origin
to t he associated henevolence ol American
citizens, whose praisew orthy elTorts to cre
ate a nucleus of civilization in the Dark
Continent have commanded respect and
sympathy everywhere, esiecially in our
own country. Although a formal protec
torate over 1 jhena is contrary to our tradi
tional ilicy. the moral right and duty of
the United States to assist in nil proper
ways in the maintenance of its integrity is
obvious and has lieen consistently announced
during nearly half n century. I recommend
that in the reorganization of our navy n
small vessel, no longer found adequate to

In my last annual message to Congress atten
tion was directed to the fact that the revenues of
the government exceeded Its actual needs and it
was suggested that legislative action should lie
taken to relieve the ieoii4e from the unnecessary
burdeii of taxation thus made apparent Iu v. iew
of the presKing importance of the subject I deem
It my duty to again urge its consideration. The
income of the gov eminent by its increased volume
and through economies hi Its collection, is now
more than ever hi excess of public necessities.
The application of the surplus to the payment of
such iHirtlou of the public debt as is now- at our
option, subject to extinguishment, if continued at
the rate which has lately prevailed, would retire
tlie class of Indebtedness within less than
one year from this date Thus a continuation of
our present rev eiiue sv stem vv ould result iu the i e
ceipt of an annual income much greater than
necetwary to meet the government expenses, w ith
no indebtedness uon whkh it could le applied.
We should then be confronted with a vast quanti
ty of money, the circulating medium of the peo
ple, hoarded in the treasury when It should be In
their haiuLs, or we should le drawn Into wasteful
public extravagance, with all the corrupting na
tional demoralization which follows In its train,
lint it 1st not thri Kitnnle existence of this surplus
and Its threatened attendant evils, which furnish
the strongest argument against our present scale
of federal taxation. Its worst Plume, Is the exac
tion of such a surplus through a perversion of

(lood government, and esjecially the govern
ment of which every American citizen boasts, has
for its objects the protection of every jierboii

w ith the good oilier of society, and his jierfect se
curity In the enjoyment of fits earnings with the
least possible diminution for public needs. When
more of the oples sulmtauce Is exacted through
the form of taxation than is necessary to the Just
obligation of the government and the exjtense of
its economical administration, such exaction Ik
comes ruthless extortion and a violation of the
fimiLiiiu'iitid principles of a free coveinment
The indirect manner in w hich these exactions are
made has a tendeniT to conceal their true charac
ter and their extent llut we have arrived at a
