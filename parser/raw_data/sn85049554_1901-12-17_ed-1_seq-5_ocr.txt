and merchants have thoughtfully

But on^SAe business streets very few
have thought of this. Herein may bq
a suggestion.
Hon. Joel Stewart and H. I. Davis

from several alumni in regard to Grin
nell's victory. Pictures of Captain Fl9k
and Captain-Elect -Evans appear on the
front page tnd a picture of the team on
a separate sheet is folded in. The record
of games shows but one defeat, that at
Iowa City, and the total of scoreB is 136
points made by Grinnell against 27 by
all others. The team loses some of lta
stars and others of its most reliable men
in the present senior class. Baggs, Flak,
Clark, Lyman and Evan Evans go out,
and Van Dike, McKeag and Chase, of
the scrubs. The work of Tratt is com
plimented and it is hoped "some one a«
good" will be secured for next year.'

Neuralgia is a disease of the
nerves, the doctors say. No
one, knows positively, because it is pretty hard to tell
sometimes just what causes any kind of pain. One thing is
certain, however. That is Omega Oil.
It cures
It cures by putting the nerves to sleep. It is believed to
be the only external cure known for Neuralgia. Evecy
internal neuralgia medicine is strong and dangerous.
Omega Oil cures from the outside, and there li no ride
or danger in using it.
