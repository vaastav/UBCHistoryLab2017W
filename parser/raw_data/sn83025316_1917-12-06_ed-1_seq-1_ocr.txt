BATTLE FRONT CALM ,
GOES BEFORE STORM
Germans Expected to Renew
Titanic Struggle at Cam
brai and in Italy.
London, Doc. S.—British troops, ac
ting in conjunction with an efficient
force of Russians, have carried out a
successful operation in Mesopotamia,
Major General F. B. Maurice, chief di
meter of military operations at the war
office, announced today.
"Here we aVe continuing the policy
of striking wherever the enemy gives
us opportunity. We have just carried
out this policy in an operation of our
right, with full co-operation of Rus
sian forces. The success of the Rus
sian arms here shows that some por
tions of the Russian army are still
witling and ready to fight."
General Maurice's reference to oper
ations in Mesopotamia contains the
first report of fighting by Russians
since negotiations for an armistice be
tween Germany and Russia were be
gun, ^he Russian troops on the
northern front have been inactive for
weeks, but the army on the Caucasus
front has been carrying forward the
campaign against the Turks. The Rus
sian forces in Persia, near the Mesopo
tamian border, have done little since
the Russian revolution, however, and
the lessening of their effort seriously
interfered with the Russo-Rritish plan
of campaign after the capture of Rag
dad when a junction of these forces,
had almost been effected.
'Germans Preparing
for a New Attack
While for the moment there are no
infantry operations of great magnitude
in progress on any of the numerous
battle fronts, indications are not want
ing that shortly the Cambrai sector in
France and the nortli line in the Italian
theater will again witness titanic
struggles, with the Germans and Aus
tro-Hungarians the aggressors.
Already the Germans in the Cambrai
region have brought up fresh rein
forcements, witli the object of blotting
out the salient driven into their line by
General Byng's intrepid dash, a small
portion of which they have recon
quered, but at a fearful price.
In Italy, along the Sette Comuni and
the Asiago plateau, enemy guns of all
calibers have opened fire on the Ital
ian positions and several hill positions
have been captured in small attacks.
Entente Feele Confident.
Roth before Cambrai und in the Ital
ian region the allied armies are await
ing with complacency the enemy's as
saults.
While near Cambrai, it is conceded
that the British will be forced by rea
son of the dangerous salient held by
the enemy in their line to somewhat
straightened out their front, optimism
is expressed that on the whole General
Byng's forces will he able to give
good accounting for any attacks the
enemy may launch.
BikewiiH- the menace of a dash by
the Austro-Germans down through the
hills and out Upon the plains of Vcnctiu
has been provided for, so far as the
reinforcement of the Italians by th<
British and French troops and the
bringing up of fresh guns is concerned
If Field Marshal von Hortzendorf, com
mander of the enemy troops, should he
able to breach the line and gain his
objective, it would be, only after one
of the most sanguinary encounters of
the war.

U. S. ENGINEERS
HAVE THRILLER
Captured by Huns, Attack
Guards With Bare Hands
and Make Escape.
With the British Army in Fiance.
Tuesday, Dec. 4.—By The Associated
Press.—The best of many exciting
episodes related in connection with
the Cambrai fighting was that involv
ing 50 American and Canadian engi
neers together with some British
troops. These men were cut off in
the German turning movement near
Gouzeacourt and wore taken prisoner.
A German escort of 30 soldiers or
more started with them along the road
leading from Gouzeaucourt to Cam
brai. As they were proceeding discon
solately toward the zone of the Ger
man prison cages they came upon a
Small body of British troops who had
also been cut off from their com
rades and were wandering about.
Tommies Charge.
The British Tommies immediately
charged toward them. The Germans
tried to drive their captives off to
ward X<a Vacquerle, but the prisoners
hurled themselves on their guards and
struggled barehanded until the Tom
mies arrived and disposed of the Ger
mans. The engineers and their com
rades took the German rifles and
worked ihclr way back with their
rescuers until they were able to react»
a point where they could join the
British line.
A party of Canadians and Ameri
cans also had an exciting time in a
motor iorrie, which, coming unex
pectedly upon six Germans holding the
oross-roads with machine g'oas,
charged it at full speed, tank-like,
Ihowltng over the surprised enemy and
escaping down the road before the
Germans recovered from their shock
and fright.
Others "Do Bit."
The engineers were not the only
army men from the United States who
did "their bit" during the most in
tense part of the German counter at
tack at Cambrai. No less than 10
American army medical officers were
working in the British casualty sta
tion along the Gouzeaucourt front. In
fact, they had been laboring t hero
since General Byng began his great
offensive.
Italy Expresses Gratitude
for President's Message
Rome, Dec. 5.—President Wilson's
request to the American congress to
declare war upon Austria-Hungary has
been received with the greatest enthu
siasm and satisfaction throughout lt
I aly, being commented upon as tanigble
proof that the United States is sup
lmrtlng Italy, not only morally, but

Quick, Radical Action Needed
to Save Railway Efficiency
Special Report Interstate Commerce Commission Recom-
mends Repeal Anti-Trust and Anti-Pooling Laws
or Government Control.
Washington, Dee. 5.-—Immediate ac
tion to effect national unification of the
railroads, either by government opera
tion or by suspension for the war of
anti-trust and anti-pooling laws, a fed
eral loan and regulation of security is
sues to permit more effective volun
tary co-operation, was recommended
today by the interstate commerce com
mission in a special report to con
gress.
Neither plan was specifically en
dorsed, but un implication jhat the ma
jority believed the railroads might
successfully work out their own unifi
cation prompted Commissioner Mo
Choi'd to submit a separate report em
phatically urging govei'iimenl control,
and saying, "the sti-ong arm of gov
ernment authority is essential if the
transportation system Is t'o be radically
improved." Any voluntary pooling
plan would fail to meet war exigencies,
tie declared* because of the unavoidable
Influence of selfishness among loads.
Competition Must Go.
There was no disagreement as to tin
proposition lliat competition among
railroads must lx diminished, if not al
together eliminated. to prevent a
serious breakdown of transportation
facilities under the war's strain.
The railroads' own solution for the
difficulties an Increase in rates in or- i
dor to attract capital—was character- |
iz(>d as entirely inadequate by the com- I
mission. Kvcn with more funds, the
report said, the shortage of equipment I
could not be remedied materially be
cause of the Inability of industries to
manufacture it.
Those considerations led the com
mission to wtiat is considered an in
evitable conclusion, that a higli state
of efficiency could be maintained for
the railroads only -by thorough co
operation. elimination of duplication of
routes and other elements of expense
and energy, and eliminaHon of the
economic waste which comes from
competition.
If the alternative of government
operation linder the direction of th<
president be adopted, ttie commission
said, suitable guai-anty of an adequate
annual return should be given, with
provision by which the roads could re
imburse the government for Improve
ments after the properties are returned
to privute owners.
Operation Becoming CHaotic.
Steps taken by the railroad war
board two weeks ago to pool cars and
operate roads somewhat as a unit by
loaning facilities of one to another
were recognized by Commissioner Me
Chbrd, in his supplementary report, as
valuable; but he maintained they were
only half way measures. He said the
railroads are now taking orders from

As a result of the conflict ol old
and priority, he said, ' railroad op,

If President Wilson docs not do I
take over and operate the mill'd:
Chairman McCliord said, the next I
plan would lie to enact legislation

BULLETIN.
London, Dec. 5.— A Russian com
munication dealing with the armi
stice negotiations, receive.1 here by
wireless, says:
"The enemy delegates replied
evasively tc the two initial Russian
proposals, but promised to consult
their governments concerning them.
The Russians proposed as the prin
cipal points of an armistice that
the enemy should not undertake to
send'forces from the Russian front
to the fronts of Russia's allies, also
that the German detachments bo
wihtdrawn from the islands of Moon
sound. Tile enemy delegates re
fused these proposals.
"The enemy delegates submitted
a project for an armistice from the
Baltic to the Black sea, which, in
view of their evasive replies to the
Russian proposals, the Russian dele
gates submitted to the Russian mili
tary experts.
"A fortnight was first proposed
for the duration of the armistice.
Ultimately 28 days were agreed
upon, which may be automatically
prolonged. The Russians rsqusst
ed that the next meeting be on Rus
sian territory after a lapse of seven
days."
