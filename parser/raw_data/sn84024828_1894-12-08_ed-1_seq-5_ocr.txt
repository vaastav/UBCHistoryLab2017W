VORS THE ISSUE OP MOTES
BY STATE BANKS FREE OF
TAXATION IN LIEU OF
REMONETIZATION
OF BILVER.
By the Associated Press.
Wahuinqtox, Dec. 3. -President Cleve
land transmitted bis annual meiwage to
Congress tbis morning. It Is of great
length and appears to be made op main-
ly of consideration of reports of heads of
departments previously madi public, and
his views itnd recommendations em
bodied in tbem. Ho endorses all of
these and in most instances urges their
legislative expressions. The most original
part of the message is that devoted
to consideration of the tariff The message
fails to reveal in that part devoted
to finances any reference to the so called
Baltimore plan adopted by tht Baltimore
convention of bankers, and said to have
received the hearty concurrence of
Cleveland.
He deploresthe existing system, especially
when it require government main
tenanceof the paiitv between gold and silver
and urges the adoption of a system
of issuing note free from taxation by
state b inks as set forth in the report of
the secretary of the treasury.
Concerning the tariff he says the
tariff act pisied at the Imt session of
congress requires trapsrMnt amendments
if it is to be executed effectually and
with certainty, in addition to such nec
essary amendments as will no: change
rate of duty. I am still very deciJedly
(ti favor of putting coal and iron on the
free lilt. Sifar as the schedule U
concerned, I would be glad under exist
ing aggravations to see every particle of
differential duty in favor of refined sugar
stricken out of our tariff law. If, with
all favor accorded sugar refining inter
ests in our tariff laws, it still languishes
to the extent of closing all refineries
and throwing thousands of workmen out
of employment, it would seem to present
a hopeless case for reasonanle legislative
aid. And whatever el te is done,
or omitted, I earnestly rep-tat rny recommendation
that the alditional duty
of 1-10 of onecen' per pound, laid upon
sugar imported from, countries paying
a bounty on its exports, be abrogated.
It seems to me, exceedingly important
considerations point to the propriety of
this amendment. With the advent of
a new tariff policy not alone calculated
to relieve consumers of our land in the
cost of their daily living, but invite the
better development of American thrift,
and create fov ns closer and more profitable
commercial relations with the rest
of the world, it follows as an imperative
necessity that sua should at once remove
(he chief, if not only obstacle.Jwhich has
so long prevented our participation in
the foreign carrying trade by sea. He
then urges American registry be extended
to foreign built teasels.
Tariff, built u,on the theory that it is
well to check i sports and that home
markets should bound the industry and
efforts of Ameiican producers was fitly
supplemented 'by the refusal to allow
American registry of vessels built abroad,
though owned and navigated by our own
people, thus exhibiting a willingness to
advance all contracts for the advantage
of Ameriran carriage. Our
new tariff policv is built upon the iheory
that it is well to encourage such importations.
Our people's need, and their
products and manufactures should find
markets in every part of the habitable
globe, is consistently supplemented by
the greatest possible li wrty to our citizens
in the ownership and navigation
of ships in which our products and manufactured
articles may be transported.
Millions of dollars now paid for carrying
American passengers and products
across the sea should be turned into
American hands. Ship building which
has been protected to the strangulation
point should bo revived by prospects of
profitable employment for ships when
bnilt, and the American sailor should be
resurrected and again take his place as a
sturdy and industrious citizen in time of
peace and a patriotic and safe defender of
American interests in the days of con
flint.

, Wall Street Support Graver. -
(By the Associated Press.)
New York, Dec. 3 The activity in
Wall street was increased by the President's
Message, and active speculation
was the result.
The east hound freight train in charge
of Conductor Smyser, was ditched at a
point about five miles east of Kingman
in the Waliapal Valley Sunday morning.
The cause of the accident was a
broken rail. The cars were loaded with
California wines, raisins, currents and
canned goods. The car containing the
prodnction of 'he California vineyard
was the center of attraction, for some of
the many visitors of the wreck simpled
the choice brands of port, angelica and
claret, and pronounced them most excellent.
It was a veritable feast lor the
inebriate hobos who seem to have a
natural instinct to congregate where the
fiery fluid if to be had free gratis, and
they constituted the only human wrecks

We received a very pleasant and entertaining
call M milay sftemoon from Mr
Dsvi.l Bast, the president of The Best
Manufacturing C nptny of 8 m L3andro,
Cal., whose specialty is the manufacturing
of traction and crude oil engines. A
large number of these gas engines can oe
fund in the southern part of California,
and their traction engines area necessary
machine in many places of the northern
part of that State for the moving of
plows and harrows and for the transportation
of I arge loads of logs from the logging
camps to the mill. We believe it
would be a great saving of time and mon
ey If some of our large mining companies
and extensive freighters would Introduce
these traction engines here for the transportation
of ores and other commodities
to and from the mines to the shipping
points, as there is absolutely no road over
which these engines cannot haul immense
loads of freight.
