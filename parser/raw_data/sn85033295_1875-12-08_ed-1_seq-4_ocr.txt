Dairymen and others who have
milking to do, will be delighted to
know that some American genius has
invented a cow-tail holder. This is a
god-send, for who has not had an old
cow’s dirty tail flopped in his face,
while he was milking in the fly season
All hail to the inventer of the dow-tail
holder. He shall have a cow’s tail

President’s Message. —Tuesday
(he 7th inst. President Grant deliver
ed his Seventh Annual Message to
Congress. It is an able document, and
gives an intesesting review of our na
tional progress. A large portion of
the message is devoted to Centennial
matters. We doubt not that the docu
ment will be read with interest in all
parts of the coufltry. It takes a plain
and common sense view of things, like
all papers that emanate from the pen
of President Grant.

Barndm’s big Elephant, Betsy,
escaped from the barn in Bridgeport,
where she is quartered for the Winter,
tbo other night, and after letting loose
a Bengal Tiger, started for the railroad
where she engaged in a battle
wiith a locomotive; the only results of
which, was a burned proboscis. The
dags kept with the elephant, had by
thus time, roused the keepers, who after
considerable trouble succeeded in cap
turing her. We think Bridgepoit
ought to be extremely thankful that
Betsy took the night for her escape, as
no one would exactly enjoy meeting an
unprotected elephant on the highway.
Recently a young lady and gentle
men in Portage county, Ohio, were
married at an evening party, to give
zest to the evenings entertainment.
Among the guests was a magistrate,
and he was selected to perform the
then thought to be mock ceremony.
It now turns out that the marriage was
a legal one. How the suddenly mar
ried couple will adjust matters is not at
present known—whether they will
make the best of it, and accept in good
earnest that which was begun in fun,
or whether they will seek a legal sep
aration, are questions in which the peo
ple in that section are very much in
terested. We advise the couple to buy
a,nutmeg grater and go to housekeep
ing.
Boss Tweed has escaped. The
query is, how was it effected ? When
last seen he was on the stairs leading
to his wife’s apartments. We do not
believe his wife secreted him in her
watch pocket ; neither do we think he
escaped through a key-hole; nor is it
likely that his heavy carcass has soared
heavenward on Angelic pinions. And
he certainly did not make use of the
Jeff. Davis dodge, as crinoline is no
longer worn, and his corpulant figure
would have excited suspicion in a pull
back. Then how did the old fellow
disappear so suddenly? The police
have searched the house and city for
him in vain. Over his bed in Ludlow
street the motto, “In God we
trust,” but the police do not think that
this indicates anything as to his where
abouts, and yet it seems the old rascal
has not trusted in vain. There is no
doubt, however, but that the Boss put
his trust “where it would do him the
most good,” as the sequel shows. And
the question now is, how is be going to
remain in. cog., when nis features are
familiar to every ir.ao, woman and
child in tho land ? This is a feat that
will require the aid of a good deal more
“trust,” to successfully accomplish,
ao4 more mottoes will doubtless be in

A Washington dispatch of Nov.
22d, says a gentleman of wide exper
ience in political afiairs, who has just
returned from the west, reports that
Mr. Morton is almost sure to have the
united vote of Indiana for the Presi
dential nomination in the next Repub
lican National Convention. Something
of an undercurrent is settling against
him there, but it will not be strong
enough to show itself outside of the
State. The gentleman saw no one in
the West who imagined Gen. Grant’s
candidacy for a third term possible.
Mr. Blaine has a good many friends,
c pecially among the Republicans of
Ohio. The Indiana Democrats, accord
ing to the same authority, will present
the name of Hendricks to the next
Democratic National Convention. The
subject of the currency is more widely
discussed among the people of the
West than at any prevous time, and
both parties, especially in Indiana, are
much divided upon it, some of the
Republicans being as strong advocates
of inflation as any in the Democratic
party
Judge Cate in taking his seat as
Congressman from the Eight Wiscon
sin Distract stamps himself as a
usurper as he has no legal right to the
seat. Even the Milwaukee News
frankly admits that Judge Cate was
not elected if all the votes cast had
been counted and were legal. Judge
Cate was declared elected by two ma
jority by‘throwing out a portion of the
vote of Wood county. The State Su
preme Court have decided in the case
of several county officers, who were
defeated bv declaring this vote illegal,
that the vote should have been can
vassed, and the officers contesting, got
their positions.. If the vote had no
right to be thrown out where the coun
ty offices were involved, it certainly
could not be set aside in the case of
a Congressman, and on this hypothesis
Cate had no right to the certificate. If
Judge Cate has auy manhood in him,
he will allow the question of Congress
man for the Eight District to go to the
people, his opponent, Dr. McDill, being
dead.
The Forty-Fourth Congress.
The Forty-Fourth Congress met last
Monday at Washington. Hon. M. C.
Kerr, of Indiana, was chosen Speaker
of the House of Representatives, b> a
a vote of ISO to 141, for J. G. Blaine,
of Maine. For Sergeant-at-arms of
the new House, the choice fell upon
John G. Thompson, of Ohio. L. H.
Fitzhugh, of Texas, was elected Door
keeper and James Stuart, of Virginia,
Postmaster.
For speaker, the democrats have
selected a very competent gentleman,
and one whom it is expected will dis
charge his duties satisfactorily. The
election of Mr. Kerr over Randall, of
Pennsylvania, is set down as a triumph
of the hard money democracy and
But the claims of the rag
money democracy of Ohio have been
recognized in the selection of Thomp
son, who led the rag money democratic
hosts in the recent campaign, for one
of the most lucrative positions in the
disposal of the house. Mr. Fitzhugh
was Sergeant-at-arms of the Rebel
Congress, and bis appointment at the
present time to the position of door
keeper of the democratic Congress,
seems very fitting and appropriate, in
view of the fact that the house con.
tains so large a proportion of those who
like himself, sought the destruction of
tho government. The Senate organ
ized tor business with Senator Thomas
W. Ferry, of Michigan, as President,
Pro - Tem.
Secretary Bristow, in a dispatch
to D. P. Dyer, U. S. District Attorney,
at St. Louis, does not give much com
fort to members of the Whiskey Ring
in that city and elsewhere, His lan
guage is vigorous and to the point, as
follows: “I beg to repeat the request,
heretofore communicated to you, that
these frauds on the Government shall
be probed to the very bottom; that
every ramification of the Ring shall be
followed in every part from beginning
to end, and that no one having con
nection with or guilty knowledge of its
operations shall be permitted to escape.
So far as this Department is concerned,
I ask that every allegation against any
officer of it, from its head to its hum
blest employe, be thoroughly investi
gated and vigorously prosecuted, if any
ground exist therefor. I have read
this to the President, who repeats his
injunction, ‘let no guilty man escape.’ ”
About the lasi fine thought ex
pressed by the late Vice President was
in these words, uttered not many weeks
before his death: “Our lives, after all,
are a great deal like a circle, which
commences at our birth, and, as the
circle draws nearer to Us close, we, in
our mind’s eye, can see clearer our
childhood and our earlier life, with its
triumphs, its hardships, its pleasures,
its sorrows and its lost opportunities. I
don't know., however, as I would wish
to live my life over, for everything has
been ordered by a good Providence.
Oh, yes—our lives are just like a cir
cle.”
Chicago is thoroughly aroused and
appearances seem to indicate that one
murderer, at lesst, is to be brought to
speedy punishment in that city. Last
Thanksgiving, Charles Whyland, head
of the firm, managing St. Elmo Res
taurant, attached to Kuhn’s Hotel, was
murdered in his place of business, by
Henry Davis, a gambler and notoriouf
bunko man. Davis deliberately and
without provocation, placed a pistol
close to Whyland’s cheek and fired
kliing his victim almost instautly.
Before the smoke cleared away the
murderer took to his heels, but he was
soon overtaken and placed in confine
ment. When spoken to a lew hours
after the murder, Davis pretended to
know nothing of the affair, and seemed
surprised that he had a short time be
fore taken the life of a human being.
This was undoubtedly assumed, and
indicates what the defense will be
The scheme is too thin and the ends of
justice are not going to be thwarted in
this care insanity dodge. The
murder was cold blooded and deliver
ate. without one iota of an extenuat
ing circumstance in it, and the people
of Chicago demand that the murderer
shall be speedily dealt with, as a warn
ing to the horde of desperadoes that in
fest that city. Davis is to have his
trial this week.
Queen Victoria’s favorite servant
is named John Brown. Not he of
Harper’s Ferry notoriety, but the son
of a Scotchman of the same name.
Now John Brown the elder, took it
into his head the other day to go on
an exploring expedition, not into the
Artie Regions, but to that bourne from
whence no traveler returns. Of
course he had to be buried, and his
remains were followed to the grave by
her Gracious Majesty, Queen Victoria.
This act, so commendable, from an
American point of view, has set John
Bull roaring, and the press and people
cannot find language strong enough to
censure Her Majesty for this somewhat
republican proceeding. One of the
widest circulated weekly papers, the
Sunday Times , under the head of a
“Royal Prank,” broke into a fierce ex
plosion of rage, of which the following
short extract is a specimen:
We may safely say that a thrill of
positive astonishment went through
the public mind last week on reading
the extraordinary prank in which the
Sovereign of this great nation has been
indulging. Some ten days ago a re
spectable old Scotch croften went the
way of all flesh. His only claim to
public notice consisted in the fact of
his being the progenitor of a morose
looking gillie who, by some strange
fatuity, has worked himself into the
position of walking-shadow to the
greatest Queen in Christendom. And
yet the obsequies of this obscure little
Northern fanner, but scarcely removed
above the rank of a common laborer,
are honored by the personal attendance
of Her Majesty, who followed the coffin
from the cottage to the nearest point
where a hearse can approach. In thus
parading herself before the world, as a
laughing-stock for the whole of Eu
rope, we do not hesitate to say that the
Queen has done one of the most ill
advised acts which has marked her
long reign. The tongue of scandal is
ever busy, and “the fierce ligh't that
beats upon a throne” will not admit of
actions whicl , however harmless or
even laudable in themselves, are derog
atory to the dignity of the nation re
presented in the person of the sover
eign. It is almost impossible to realize
the effect which will be produced on
the unthinking portion of the com
munity when they see in every shop
window a certain cheap illustrated pa
per, in this, week’s number of which
Her Majesty is depicted wit h a woe
begone aspect following a coffin borne
by four bare-legged Scotchmen, and
immediately proceeding two brawny
persons in very scanty clothing, re
presenting the two oldest orphan
Browns. The most rampant Red Re
pvblican could never have suggested
an act more calculated to serve his
views than this unfortunate spectacle.

Matt. H. Carpenter.
Probably there never lived in Wis
consin a man who has been more foully
lied about, than Matt. Carpenter. No
one claims that Senator Carpenter is
immaculate, but to accuse him of hav
ing a hand in all the iniquitous pro
ceedings that have cursed this country
the past few years, is a little too much.
As long as the ex-Senator held a pub
lic office, his actions were in a measure
the legitimate prey of the opposition
newspapers, but now he is a private
citizen, attending to his own private
business, and it would seem as though
he might be left to follow his profession
in peace. During the last campaign,
Mr, Carpenter did not make a speech
or write a letter, and yet the opposition
papers were continually lugging him
into the canvass, for no other purpose
than that of abusing and slandering
him. Now that the campaign is over,
true to their instincts, his enemies are
'Striving to make it appear that he has
been connected with the Milwaukee
Whiskey Ring, because he, in a pro
fessional way, is defending some of the
men who are implicated in the Whisky
frauds. This is being done by a Mil
waukee correspondent of the Chicago
Tribune. This correspondent is un
doubtedly an old resident of Milwau
kee, and after reading the letters care
fully which have appeared in the Tri
bune the past week, we incline to the
opinion that the said correspondent
does not spell his name with a “p.”
The correspondent, whoever he is, will
have the pleasure of proving his
charges ere long, as will be seen by the
following open letter which Mr. Car
penter has addressed to the editor of
the Chicago Tribune:
You have seen fit to charge in sub
stance, or publish communications
which in substance, charge me with
having been a member, or oiganizer of,
or connected with, what you chooso to
denominate the whiskey ring in Mil
waukee} by which your readers will
understand, as you intend they shah
that I was, while a senator, a sharer in
the fruits of frauds upon the internal
revenue laws of the United States
I am now very much engaged in at
tending to the rights of clients in the
United States Courts here; but as soon
as I can get the necessary leisure,
which I hope will be within a few
weeks, I will sue you for libel, and thus
afford you a fair opportunity to prove
your charges, if you can.
If your charges are true, I am a dis
graced naan, if not, you are; and which
is the villain we will submit to the de
termination of a jury, where thediffer
ence between truth and falsehood is re
cognized If you can establish my
guilt I ought to be disgraced, and am
willing to be; if you cannot, you ought
to be. however unwilling you may be.
I will not take you to Washington,
nor Nova Scotia, nor Cuba, nor
Cheyenne, under the Poland gag law !!!
but will sue you in the United States
Circuit Court for the Northern Dis
trict of Illinois; and you may as well
be collecting your evidence upon the
subject.
Matt. H. Carpenter.
A queer case was tried in the city
court of Baltimore, last week, on ap
peal. Mrs. Ruth Langville, by her
next friend, John Langville, warranted
Morris Weglein for 522. She testified
that her husband being ill, and, as she
supposed, abou 1 ; to die, she desired to
provide him a nice suit of clothes to
be buried in, and purchased eloth for
the purpose from Mr. Weglein, for
whioh she paid 522; she was not satis
fied with the purchase when she got
the goods home, and she returned
them, demanding the money back, and
claiming that the purchase was not
what she supposed it was. Her bus
band, having recovered, brought the
suit for her as next friend, instead of
wearing the nice suit ot grave-clothes
bought by his wife. Judge Brown
gave a judgment in her favor for the
$22.
Sheridan and the Indians.—
Lieut. Gen. Sheridan in his annual re
port devotes considerable attention to
the Indian problem, which, he thinks,
can be best solved by transferring the
Indian Bureau to the charge of the
War Department, to be taken under
the general administration of the
army. Gen. Sheridan, who is excel
lent authority on these points, believes
that if the Indians were honestly and
humanely dealt with, the Government
would have less need of troops to keep
the savages under proper subjection.

The Weekly Sun.
1776. NEW VORK. 1576.
Eighteen hundred smd seventy six is the
Centennial year. It is also ihe year in
which an Opposition House cf Representa
tives, the first since the war, will be in
power at Washington; and the year of the
twenty-third election of a President of the
United Slates. All these events are sure to
bt ot great interest and importance, espec
ially tbe two latter; and all of them and
everything connected with them will be
fully and freshly reported and expounded
in The Sun.
The Opposition House of Representatives,
taking up the line of inquiry opened years
ago by The Sun, will sternly and diligently
investigate the corruptions and misdeeds of
Gram's administration; aud will, it is to be
hoped, lay the foundation for anew and
better period in our national history. Of
ail this The Sun will contain complete and
accurate accounts, furnishing its readers
with early and trustworthy information
upon these absorbing topics.
The twenty-thiid Presidential election,
with the preparations for it, will be memor
able as deciding upon Grant’s aspirations
for a third term of power and plunder, and
still more as deciding who shall be the can
date of the party of Reform, and as elect
ing that candidate. Concerning all these
subjects, those who read The Sun will have
the constant means of being thoroughly
well informed.
The Weekly Sun, which has attained a
circulation of over eighty thousand copies,
already has its readers in every Slate and
Territory, and we trust tnat the year 18T6
will see their number doubled. It will con
tinue to be a thorough newspaper. All the
general news of the day will be found in it
condensed when unimportant, at full length
when of moment; and always, we trust,
treated in a clear, interesting and instruc
tive manner.
It is our aim to make the Weekly Sun
the best family newspaper in the world, and
we shall continue to give in its columns a
large amount of miscellaneous reading,
such as stories, tales, poems, scientific in
telligence and agricultural information, for
which we are not able to make room in our
daily edition. The agricultural (Apartment
especially is one of its prominent features.
The fashions are also regularly'reported in
its columns; and so are the markets of every
kind.
The Weekly Sun , eight pages with fifty
six broad columns is only $1 20 a year,
postage prepaid. As this price barely re
pays the cost of the paper; no discount can
be made frm this rate to clubs, agents,
postmasters, or anyone.
Tbe Daily Sun, a Urge lour page news
paper of twenty-eight columns, gives all the
news for two cents a copj’. Subscription,
postage prepaid, 55c, a month or $6.50 a
year. Sunday edition extra, sl.lO per
year. We have no traveling agents.
