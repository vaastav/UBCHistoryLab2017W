HOW TO SUCCEED.
New rules to tiag aacoee to man
ir woman were given by Dr. Add!
son Mi lore, leader of tbt Rockefeller
Bible Class, is the Fifth Avenue
Baptist Church. Incidentally "tack"
was declared to be something that
never did and never will exist.
"There is no sach thing as luck,"
Dr. Moore said, "What seems like a
piece of chance good fortune is inva
riab'y the result of conscious or un
ymscions preparation, frequently go
ng back fir years."
A simple rule for socces and on
hicb Dr. Moore declares la Infalti
ble, waa given hy him aa follow?:
"To be a success is to so live your
iife that it shall cause no one to lose
f-iith in yon or in the world."
Ir. Moore then said that there is
no sex in success "
"Soccess, real success,' be said "Is
almost a purely ideal thing. Nobody
?oes so high that he desires to go nr
ugher. Men are like the skyscraper
s-chitects they build op a twenty
story success and immediately set tr
work on a firty-story structure.
"Fame and prosperity are only in
'Mental, not the essential acoompani
inent of success. If I were to for-
nnlate a single rule for succeeding
io life I should say 'Find the work
rou like best and then do it with all
your might.' "
Dr. Moore declared that the person
loing work that he dislikes is bound
to (ail.
"A rich man who made hts mor
y in business, when a thousand
tifled impulses were crying to him
o become an artiet if he starved,"
aid Dr. Moore, "is infinitely more ol
t failure than some poor painter who
makes a bare living and perhaps
never will do any better.
Success In married life. Dr. Moore
aid, was all based on the element of
rust that must exist between hus
band and wife.
"The nnhappiness of married life
ail goes back to e lack of trust on tlx
part of either husband or wife," bf
aid. "The woman who, even ii
oe does nothing technically wrong
icts In such a way as to shake bei
husband'i faith in her, foils aa
wife.
"The man whose comings and go
ings lay him open to suspicion, evei
f there is actually no faot to justify
tbe suspicion, fails as a husband.
"Married people live successful l
when each can look back at the end
it the day and test that no deed ol
his has injured the ftith or feeling
of the other.
"The qualities essential fot attain
ing the successful life are honor, loy
alty, unselfishness, love of work and
cheerfulness.'
The President's Message.
President Taft sent bis annual
message to Congress Tuesday. Its
principal features are as follows :
Bi .-ine.ss Laws He does "not
now recommend any amendment to
the anti-trust law. It seems to
me that the existing legislation with
reference to the regulation of corpor
ations and tbe restraint of their buei
ness has reached a point where vce
can stop for a while and witness the
effect of tbe vigorous execution of tl e
laws." The president says supreme
court decisions iu pending cases will
show tbe exact limitations placed on
business by the law.
Tabiff General revision is oppos
ed. Permanent tariff commission
and non-partisan revision by ached
ule on a scientific basis is recom
mended. Kailkoaim An appropriation is
urged fur tbe interstate commission
to make a valuation of all railroads
as important "if we ultimately enact
any limitations upon the power to Is
sue stocks and bonds."
Cukskkvatioh Leasing ol govern
ment coal lands, with royalties and
conditiuns to prevent monopoly, is
lecom mended. Leasing of water
power sites is likewise favored.
Postal Laws Gradual extension
ot postal savings banks recommend
ed; also establishing a parcels post on
rural delivery routes. Increased post
age on maguxines strongly urged.
Meucuant Mabine Ship suuti
dy, especially to South America, is
favored.
Col'hts Reform of judicial pro
cedure, to lexseu delay and cost of
! litigation, is recommended.
Laiiob Mr. Taft asks that the
eigbt-hour day bill be amended to
iucluJe work on ships, armor and
j heavy guns. Moon injunction bill
i a'aiu urged.

Hon. D. M. Van Auken. On his ad
mission to the bar in 1S67 he entered
into partnership with his preceptor,
who wrs then in Congress, whicb
Association he continued uatil 1871.
Naturally during the absence of Mr.
Van Auken tbe responsibility of bib
large practice fell mostly to the care
of Mr. Bull which gave him wide
experience and broadened his knowl
edge of the law. When he opened
a office for himself he was well
equipped to take a leading position at
the bar, and which he has since sus
tained. Be was methodical In hab
its,,studious in preparing bis cases.

presenting his evidence He bad a
good legal mind and keen acumen in

side and weak on the part of his ad
versary. He was pleasant socially,
a good conversationalist, abounding
in reminiscence and bad an excellent
memory. Upright in his dealings,
scrupulously honest, he was faithful
to the interests of bis clients and
made them bis friends. He was not
ambitious politically and was content
with local offices though at times
those of a wider scope were within
bis grasp. He tias been a member f
Councils, was Chief Burgess and for
several years has been a member of
the School Board, and was County
Solicitor, a member of Milford Water
Co. and the Cemetery Association
He was one of the oldest members of

In bis family he was most kind,

der solicitude. In tbe community

county has sustained a loss which it
will be difficult to repair, and all will
mourn a good man gone.

NEWS FROM
WASHINGTON
A''tv a ret ami an election
eventful in AmTieaa politics, the
national legislature again in session
in Washington. It will be a full
year, however, before the re It of
the recent elections can he fully felt
in iegilation, and by that time there
may be sach changes in commercial,
in-Iostrial and political condition
that tbe intention of tbe voters as
xpre9ed a few weeks ago will b
modified or in un instances nulli
3ed. It is an unfortunate condition
hat twelve months must elapse and
session of Congress intervene beforn
tbe w ill of the country as expressed
at the pjlls can be carried into ef
f'-ct, and when it is remembered that
hi- c .ndition ts fixed in the Consti
tution, that fet!.-h of the Americ-in
!. jer and statesman, it is difficult
o see how reform can be effected.
It is expected tbat the present se
-aoa wi.l address itself to routii.e
business, the psssag4 of appropria
tion bi'ls and necessary non-politiral
measures. The President's proola
oiatiun has recommended as a ma iter
if coarse important new legislation,
"iut there is little prospect of its !-e
ing carried out. Nothing much will
be d ;ne until after the Chiis'tuai
holiday, and then barely two tin nth.
of the Congressional session will re
tnaui before this Congress, on the 4:h
of March, xill be ex olficio, and, as
has been Slid, the new Coagress just
elected to do and nndo so much will
not have its chance for one year.
Among the measures that will
surely have a bearing in tbe di.-cos
sions under the appropriations bill-
will be the subject of the fortification
of tbe Panama Canal and there will
be a confusion of party lines io tbe
debate on this question. Some Re
publicans and some Democrats will
oppose the military program pro
posed by the Presideut, while other
Republicans and Democrats will ap
prove it. Mr. Tawney. Chairman ot
the Appropriations Committee, who
failed of reelection, will urge that the
Canal shall be made a free waterway
unguarded by fortresses or cannon
while those of the Roosevelt and
Taft school politics will insist that a
property costing nearly half a billion
of dollars and essential to the defense
of our extensive western coast Hue
shall not be left without adequate
military protection, always, of course
"in the interest of peace," as Mr.
Roosevelt would express it.
To Reduce Postage
It Is said that an eff ort will be
made by - tbe Postmaster General
backed by the administration, to
pass a bill reducing postage on sealed
letters to one cent and also to carry
intn effect the long opposed parcels
post privileges enjoyed by nil foreign
peoples, but through the influence
of the express companies withheld
from the citiaens of the United
States. The American citizen livinc
in Washington may set d a ten
pound package by mail to London,
Paris, Berlin or Vienna, but he can
not send the same package to Balti
more, only one hour distant, or to
Philadelphia or New York, four aud
five hours distant. If the package
should weigh only four pounds he
can send It by mail lor 64o to any of
these cities, but the four pounds to
the European destination costs onl
itfo. The Postofflee Department is
not responsible for these outrages.
They are tbe result of the monopolj
which tbe express companies through
their influence in the Senate and
House have been able to maintain in
the distribution of packages by mail.
Iu other words, the exptess compan
ies will not be able to nn.ke so much
money if the people of the United
States shall insist upon having as
ood a arcels-poat service between
Philadelphia and Cincinnati, for ex
ample, as they have to Berlin or
Paris.

HONOR TWAIN'S
MEMORY.
By BURN ETf F. BRENNAN.
I Last Wedresday evening. Novem-
ber 30th, a crowd numbering nearly
five tbotmnd flicked to Carnegie
'Hall to pv warm tribute to the
memory rf Mark Twain, (Samuel L.
Clemen"), America's greatest humor
ist. It wa the most dUtirjgUTshed
gathering tbat bas come ticether
here for many year. The speakers
were Mr. Jo-x-ph H. Chate. Kev. Ir
Jowph H. Twit-hell, of Hsrtfi rd, Ct
Mark Twain's old pvtor, Champ
Curk, of Missouri, slated to sucoewl
Mr Cannon as Speaker in tbe next
Congr.. Gerge W. Cable, Henry
Warterwm, Henry nn Dyke, and
list but nrt less dear ol I "Uncle
Joe" Cannon bun!f. The stage on
which these famous men were mm
bled was profusely aud indeed artir
tical'y decorated with spreading
itreen pi. ins and American bunting
Thi- -ii!reses were all g-xd and ev
ery Si-eaker received his share of
hearty applause.
Mr. Cannon Md in his droll,
drawling, delightful way how Mark
: wa n came to Washington to
"lot-by" in the interest of the copy
r ht law. Mr. Clemens added that
he wished to protect his and his
children's riehls aeainst pirates.'
"Murk Twain,'' said the cheery,
old Speaker, with a merry twinkle
in Lis pleasant eyes, "cherished an
urgent desire to appear on the floor
of the Bouse of Rt presentativea and
argue his case. Mark came to n e
aSout it. I told him that it could
n 4 be done as it had never been
dene. I said that uone but members
and ex members bad the privilege
of tht flour of the house. The only
pretedeuts in tbe cases of others
were when persons received the
thanks of Congress. A few days
later Mark slipped in, and, without
a word, laid on my desk a letter ad
dressed to me.1' Here is the letter :
Dear Uncle Joseph : Please get
me the thanks of Congress; not next
week, but ripht away. It is very
necessary. Do accomplish this at
once, by persuasion, if yon can, by
violence if you must, for it ia abso
utely necessary that 1 get on the
floor fr two or three hours and talk
to tbe Congressmen man by man. I
have arguments with me; also a bar'
rel with liqn'd in it. I have stayed
away from Congress and let it alone
for seventy-one years and I am en
titled to its thanks. Congress knows
ibis well and it never has publicly
acknowledged its appreciation. Seud
me a reply at once with an order ot)
the Sergeant-at Arma. With love
and benediction.
MARK TWAIN.
Mr. Watterson spoke of the beauty
and purity of Mr. Clemens' charact
er and life "His marriage,'' be
said, "was the must brilliant success
of his life. He got the woman of all
the world he moet needed; a truly
lovely and v ise helpmate, who kept
him in bounds and headed him
straight . and right while she lived
the best of housewives and mothers,
and tbe safest of counselors sod
soundest of critics She knew his
worth; she understood his genius;
she clearly saw bis limitations and
angles Her death was a grievous
disaster as well as a staggering blow.
He never quite survived it."
The closing and most effectively
impressive feature of the meeting
was Dr. Van Dyke's poem read by
himself. Here it is :
We knew you well, dear Yoriok of
the Watt,
The very soul nf large aud friendly
j-st.
That loved and mocked the brood
grotesque of things
In this New World where all the
folk are kings.
Yoor breezy humor cleared the air
with -ort
Of shams that haunt the demoemtio
conrt
For even w here the sovereign people
role,
A human, mouarch needs a royal fool.
Your native drawl lent flavor to your
wit;
Your arrows lingered but they al
ways bit;
Uomerick unrlli around Uie circle
ran
But left no wound upon the heart of
man.
We knew you kind in trouble, brake
iu pain.
We saw you honor kept without a
stain;
We read this lesson of our Yorick's
years
True wisdom comes with laughter
and with tears.
Easy
It is easy enough to be pleasant
When life flows by like a song,
And some other poor cum
Is making a fuss
Be cause everything's gone wrong.

WINTER THOUGHTS
The winter robe of white is spread
O'er meadows green,
The seedssre slumbering in their beds
No flowers are seen;
i'hn birds to warmer climes have flown
There they will stay
Until the breath nf spring return
To make earth gay.
Nature la oold and cheerless now
Plant life seems dead
But. no, beneath the froaeu snow
'Tig nurtured, fed,
bum saucily the little buds
Will ope snd peep
We'll welceme them sll back again
From their long sleep.
Cecilia A. Cullen.
