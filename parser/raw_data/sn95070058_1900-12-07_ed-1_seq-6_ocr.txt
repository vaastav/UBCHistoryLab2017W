Madison county stands seventh in the
iucreaso of population in the state since
tho census of 1800 That year the
population of the county was
18000 The census this year shows
its population to be 10070 an increase
of 8307 Its population in 1880 was
5589 Madison with a number of
other agricultural counties has kept the
stato from showing a decrease in popu
lation In podded districts aud western
counties there has been a falling off
from the record of 1890 Fifty five
counties show a total increase in popula
tion of 87028 Thirty five counties con
taining most of the more densely popu
lated districts show a decrease of 78200
Tho net increase for the state is there
fore but 8028 as shown by the census
If the truth had been told 10 years ago
thero would have been a much larger
increase Th returns also show that
the Third congressional district iB the
largest in the ttnte in the matter of
population the figures beirg 214010
The Sixth district largest in area is the
smallest in population containing 101
805 people It is therefore possible that
the districts will be rearranged But
for tho padded returns of the larger

Frederick Teal of Omaha his superin
tendent of the hospital for the insane at
Norfolk the people will have Blight
cause for complaint In this appoint
ment duo consideration was given to
merit aud special fitness Doctor Teal
is a young man scientifically equipped
for Imposition and was highly recom
mended for the place by the medical
men of Omaha Governor Dietrich will
in the end accomplish much more polit
ically for his administration by contin
uing to exeroiBe the same kind of dis
crimination in appointments than he
could by following the example of his
predecessor who made party loyalty
alone the basis for political preference
An honest efficient and competent ad

effective argument among the people of
this state for the continuation of Gov

The Presidents Message
President McKinley has delivered his
annual message to congress the sub
stance of the document being presented
to readers of The News with todays
issue As is usual with the presidents
communications this is straight to the
point and recommends action on impor
tant questions confronting tins govern
ment in a statesmanlike manner
A considerable portion of the docu
ment is dovoted to the Chinese question
It is shown that the policy of this gov
ernment has been toward the strength
eulug and modernizing of the celestial
kingdom with no idea of landgrabbiug
entering therein Its chief aim seems
to havo been to protect its property the
lives of its citizens and discourage fu
ture outrages with the ultimate object
of an open door to trade and the placing
of China on an equality v ith modern
nations where all people of whatever
sect or nationality are safe to go and
come as they choose in times of peace
The president favors a suggestion of
the Belgian government looking toward
the control of the liquor traffic with un
civilized peoples This suggestion will
undoubtedly receive the approval of all
temperate people
Some action to prevent lynchings is
also favored
Action lo king toward the early com
pletion of an interoceanio canal is urged
such action to be of a character that
will remove existiug objections
The Philippine question is reviewed
at length and a disposition Is shown to
continue the present policy in those
islands until congress shall have made
other plans The rights of self govern
ment in the islands shall be extended
as rapidly as possible the purpose being
to givo the reins of government into the
hands of the natives whenever they lay
down their arms aud give evidence of
au ability to mako aud administer laws
iu accordance with a civilzed idea
Until tho rebellion shall cease the gov
ernment will as in the past be largely
military
The president favors legislation to
preserve just au d amicable commercial
relations with foreign couutries and the
extension of tho principle of reciprocity
A reduction of 30000000 in internal
revenue taxes is advocated which will
undoubtedly be made so that the mosses
will receive the benefit A cable from
San Francisco to Hawaii aud Manila is
favored
Authority Is wanted for an Increase
In tho standing army to 100000 men ii
necessary and argument Ib made that it
iH uecossary although tho Incrcaso is
likely to bo largely of nativo troops in
tho Philippines Cuba aud Porto llico
Tho requests of tho secretary of the
navy for now vosselR moro olflcers and
men aud a Btatuo to Admiral Porter are
recommended to bo granted A plea is
also made for tho efitabliBhrnont of u
nationnl naval reserve aud a grado of
vice admiral
A reapportion of representatives in
accordance with tho now census is rec
ommended
Many other questions of national im
portance are handled in a masterly
manner and a program for congreBS Is
outlined that will requlro tho thought
ful and earnest consideration of mem
bers during tho timo it is in session
with small opportunity for idleness
Tho message is concluded with the
very important recommendation- that
economy bo exorcised in regard to the
appropriation of public funds
CLEANING HOUSE
Situation at the Capital Regarding Ioll
tlco Appointment Etc
Lincoln Neb Dec 5 Special Cor
respondence Tho last week has been
a very lively one at tho capital for tho
reason that tho applicants for places
under tho incoming administration have
been on hand to look after their interests
Tho annouueoment that tho heads of
state institutions will select thoir own
subordinates has relieved tho pressure
somewhat
It is conceded by all republicans that
Chairman Lindsay of the state commit
tee deserves something handsome and
that hiB appointment as private secre
tary to tho governor is only temporary
Ho was looked upon as the right man to
help tho now governor past tho stormy
period of the first six months As a
party move the selection is regarded a
rnoBt wise one It is possible for a pri
vate secretary to make or mar the polit
ical future of a governor a fact which
Governor Poynter now realizes to its
fullest extent
The act of a fusion supreme court
in killing the state board of transporta
tion as soou as it was certain that fusion
job holders could no longer derive their
living from it was a thoroughly selfish
performance which will however strike
aresponsive chord all over the state a
very unusual situation
There is a very strong hint that other
state boards are in danger of being
lopped off by the coming legislature
The barbers board is laughing stock
everywhere The Btate oil inspection
has long been known to be a fraud per
petuated to make easy berths for politi
cal strikers The fact that no oil is
really inspected that certificates of fine
ness have been pasted on vinegar barrels
and that the whole system is nsecLto
prevent competition in tho oil business
in Nebraska justifies a message from
the governor abolishing the bureau
It iB quite possible such a message will
be Bent in
It is now apparent that the incoming
state officials have concluded to make a
clean sweep when it comes to making
state appointments They think that
the state has been so far scandalized by
the people who have held jobs during
the past four years that it will be no
mistake to jump them all out of office
and try a lull new set both upper and
lower
In the meantime there is a disposition
to see to it that the useless employes in
the various departments are not ap
pointed and this disposition also reaches
oward the legislature as iB learned from
the members who have visited this city
in the past week
Tho contest for speakership of the
house is beginning to warm up The
geneial belief is that it will be settled
entirely outside tho senatorial fight
and that the legislature will bo organized
along thoroughly business lines rather
than as an adjunct to the senatorial
struggle
The secretary of stato ealizing the
need of a clean sweep has bought
fine new carpets for the legislative balls
He wanted the new men to have new
things to walk on and besides he
wanted to exercise his last privilege of
buying things with the peoples money
The state committee has conoluded to
keep open through the winter so as to
have things ready for the coming cam
paign This move is noted with satis
faction from all quarters as it is certain
to be productive oi good results The
work which was done last winter and
spring by tho old committee aided in the
splendid detail organization whiob was
effected in the campaign just closed
The claim of certain counties that
they saved the election of Governor
Dietrich is becoming the subject of
muoh amusement There ore others
entitled to credit Without Lancaster
county Di9trich would have been lost
Gage with its fourteen hundred major
ity saved the governorship If the
splendid majorities in either Burt or
Pawnee had been reversed the man
from Adams would have been lost
Ouster county furnished enough gain
to save him while Holt and Thurston
or a dozen other combination gains did
the business The claim of exclusive
credit by one county deserves to be
classed with the celebrated story of the
man who killed the bear
Legislative members and visitors who
came to see the winter performance will
hove more than usual difficulty in secur
ing quarters Lincoln is pretty well
filled up with the natural increaso in
population in the last two years and de
sirable rooms which heretofore have
b en at the disposal of the legislative
contingent are nearly all taken Tho
wise ones who expect to spend the
winter here are already looking up lo-
