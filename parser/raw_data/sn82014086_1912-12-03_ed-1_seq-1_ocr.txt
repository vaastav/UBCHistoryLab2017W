Washing1nn, Dec. 2. The senate and
house settled down to work today for
the high pressure session that is to
end the sixty-second congress. Speak
er Champ Clark, wielding his emblem
.f order with ever-increasing force,
succeeded in breaking two valuable
gavels before he had brought the en
thusiastic house through an hour and
ten minutes of business. The sessions
in both houses served to complete the
preliminary work of organization, and
left congress ready for legislative bus
iness tomorrow.
Both Houses Adjourn Early.
The senate depressed by the re
cent deaths of Vice President Sherman
and Senators Hey burn and Rayaer,
was in session but 22 minutes. Both
houses adjourned as soon as the pre
liminaries of organization were con
cluded, out of respect for members
and officers who had died since the
adjournment in August.
President's Message Today.
President Taft's message will come
to both houses tomorrow. The sen

before the customary time, so that
the message may be received and read

court of impeachment which is to try
Judce Robert W. Archbald of the com
merce court.
Clark and Cannon Cheered.
Boisterous enthusiasm greeted the
return to the house of Speaker Clark,
former Speaker Cannon and other
members whose names have been long
associated with the important affairs
of that body. The roll call in the
house was by states and as the roll
proceeded the members cheered and
applauded the names of the more
prominent members.
Cheers for Four Governors-elect.
Former Speaker Cannon was given
a rising greeting when his name was
reached. Democrats and republicans
who had joined in the applause for
Speaker Clark when he entered the
rhamber at noon, jumped to their feet
and joined in the cheering. Four governors-elect,
who will go from the
house of representatives to their re
spective state capitals, also were vig
orously cheered as the roll call pro
ceeded. They were Representatives
Suler of New York; Cox, Ohio; Rob
eson, Arkansas, and Hanna, North
Dakota.
No Business in Senate.
No business was transacted by the
senate, but a number of bills and res
olutions were introduced in the house.

two houses to notify President Taft
that congress was ready to receive
his communications. Senator Bacon,
presiding officer of the senate, ap
pointed Senators Cullom and Martin
and Speaker Clark named Represen
tatives rnderwood of Alabama, Mann
of Illinois and Johnson of Kentucky.
Caucus of Republican Senators.
Senate republicans held an informal
conference during the day in an effort
to solve the tangle which has pre
vented the selection of a permanent
presiding officer of the senate. It is
expected that a republican caucus will
be held before the end of the week
and that ;fh effort will be made to
secure enough support from progres
sive and insurgent republican senators
to bring about the election of Senator
Gallinger.
Large Number of Absentees.
The house will convene at noon to
morrow. Roll call in the two houses
today showed 66 senators present out
cf a membership of 93 and 275 rep
resentatives out of a membership of
S'.'l. There are three vacancies in

RAILROAD AGREEMENT.
Rhode Island Congressman Introduces
Bill for Investigation.
Washington, Dec. 2. An investiga-
of possible violations of the
Sherman anti-trust law by the Grand
Trunk Railroad company and the New
Yolk, New Haven and Hartford Rail
road company in connection with the
building of the projected New England
branch of the Grand Trunk is author
ized by a resolution introduced in the
house today by Representative
I'Shaunessy of Rhode Island. The
resolution would provide for the elec
tion by the house of a special commit
tee of seven members to inquire into
the circumstances surrounding the
suspension of work on the Grand
Trunk line throuph southern New
England.
The matter is now under Investiga.
tion by the department of justice fol
lowing complaints by citizens of
Providence. R. I., and other towns
along the line of the proposed branch.
I:i a. statement accompanying his
resolution, Representative O'Shaunessy
said:
"Acting, in accordance with the
wishes of the people of Rhode Island
in particular, and New England in
general, I introduced this resolution
for the appointment of an investigat
ing committee which would go to the
root of as disgraceful a matter as ever
shocked the people in any section of
the United States. There is no doubt
in my mind that the people of Rhode
island who so generously bestowed a
charter upon the Southern New Eng
land railway have been wilfully be
trayed. I believe that there has been
a complete and thorough understand
ing between the president of the
Grand Trunk and the president of the
New York, New Haven and Hartford
Railroad company in connection with
every detail of an agreement designed
to throttle railroad competition in
'New England and to betray an out
'raged teople. I believe that the Sher
man anti-trust law has hern violated
in every part by an infamous secret
Agreement.
"Absurd explanations have been
wade by the railroad officials in
volved, the most laughable of which
is the alleged financial shortage ex
perienced by the Grand Trunk road.
This absurdity becomes more striking
when one reflects that the president of
the Grand Trunk refused the offer
mude from outside sources for the
completion of the work now boldiy
proposed to be abandoned, i .
1 fully believe that a criminal cou-i'
RECEIVES AN OVATION
splracy has been entered into and I
Bincerely trust that congress will ap
point the committee sought by me in
my resolution.
"I intend to confer with Attorney
General Wlckersham in a day or two.
Perhaps his contemplated action may
make unnecessary any congressional
investigation, but I want to be ready
with another remedy in case his de
partment does not see its way clear to
a solution of the problem."
Mr. O'Shaunessy's resolution was re
ferred to the committee on rules of
the house.
ANXIOUS TO SELL.
Amerioan Pneumatic Service Co.
Wants Government to Buy.
"Washington, Dec. 2.- Representa
tives of the American Pneumatic Ser
vice company today appeared before
a special senate commission of which
Senator Guggenheim of, Colorado is
chairman, to urge that the govern
ment purchase the postal pneumatic
tube systems in New York, Chicago,
Boston and St. Louis. The commis
sion was told that this company
through subsidiaries had invested
about 17,250,000 in the four cities and
would be willing to sell at a fair val
uation to be agreed upon after inves
tigation by government experts.
Charles Hayden, representing the
company, said the postal tube service
was essentially a government enter
prise and that"his company desired
to sell out because, unless its con
tracts were renewed for long periods
the property would revert to the cities
granting rights of way and there would
be no chance to get back the original
investment. The government now
pays $17,000 a mile for the use of the
tubes under contracts entered into by;
the post office department.
Senator Works' Latest Bill.
Washington, Dec. 2. Senator Works
has prepared for introduction in the
senate a bill making it a felony for
any person or corporation to inter
fere with another person or corpora
tion obtaining financial aid In the or
ganization or carrying on of any in
terstate business. The bill is based
on complaints of the interference of
railroads with prospective rivals by
impairing their credit.
HI for Currenoy System,
Washington, Dec. 2. A bill for a
currency sysem, prepared by Charles
N. Fowler of New Jersey, former
chairman of he house banking and
currency committee, was introduced in
the house today by Representative
Browning of New Jersey. It would
establish commercial zones, with the
large cities as centers, and a bankers'
council In each; a general board of
control, and an "American reserve

MILLIONAIRES MAY SAVE
GENERAL SICKLES' RELICS
Third Panel of Sheriff Jury Votes
$1,000 and Will Raise More.
New York, Dec. 2. A portion of that
wealthy coterie of men forming the
third panel of the sheriff's jury to
night voted $1,000 to be "expended ju
diciously" at the sale Wednesday by
the sheriff of the personal effects of
General Daniel E. Sickles. Vincent
Astor, Cornelius Vanderbllt, George
Ehret and several others of the mil
lionaire jurors were not present, else
the sum raised probably would have
been larger!
The committee appointed to expend
the thousand dollar will canvass the
members of the first and second panels
of Jurors and hopes that each will
subscribe a sum equal to that raised
by the third panel and that with this
three thousand dollars and individual
contributions from the millionaires
who were absent today, a sum suffi
cient to wipe, out the Judgment, of
$5,500 against the aged general can
be secured and the sale stopped.
Should the entire amount not be
forthcoming the committee will at
tend the sale and with the funds at
Its disposal buy in such relics as it
can and return them to General Sickles
as a present front the sheriff's jury.

OF MILITARY SERVICE
Loss of Electoral Rights Proposed in
French Chamber of Deputies.
Paris, Dec. 2. The danger to the
defense of the country caused by the
activity of the anti-militarist prop
aganda was the subject . of a lively
debate in the chamber of deputies to
day. M. Bonnefous. referring to the
fact that more than 80,000 citizens had
either eluded military service or de
serted, proposed a bill whereby all
deserters or persons who mutilated
themselves to avoid service should be
deprived of their electoral rights. .
M. Millerand, the minister of war,
in an impassioned speech amid an up
roar on the part of the socialists,
declared his entire agreement with

WILSON HEARS A TARIFF DEBATE
Attends Session of Bermuda Parlia
ment and Makes Speech.
Hamilton, Bermuda, Dec. 2. Wood
row Wilson heard today the first tariff
discussion since his election as presi
dent of the United States. He visited
the Bermuda parliament, where he was
loudly cheered and sat among the
members for three hours listening to
the debate on the vegetable schedules
and observing the methods of budget
legislation.
In reply to the welcome extended by
the speaker, Mr. Wilson said:
"I have been interested in the de
bate, thinking that if we very year
went through the items of expenditure
and revenue for twelve months there
would be a continuous performance
which would xcel anything the the
aters could ever produce. But the idea
is an admirable one. because rt affords
the house a constant opportunity to
review the changing circumstances of
the colony. ' I hare admired the busi
ness like manner of getting through
the estimates."
While walking from government
house Mr. Wilson said he thought that
a yearly revision of the American tar
iff schedules, such as obtained in Ber
muda, would be impracticable. It
would be impossible to discuss the es
timates and revenue simultaneously,
but he wished that the United States
would adopt some budget scheme.
The president-elect was a principal
hi a "first aid' 'case this morning. He
rescued a honeymon couple who fell
from their bicycles In front of his
house.- The bride was slightly Injured

Knew Nothing
Of Dynamiting
PRESIDENT RYAN MAKES A GEN
ERAL DENIAL-
FOUR CASES DROPPED
Government Asks for Dismissal of Four
of the 45 DefendantsHockin Re
signs Office in Iron Workers' Union.
Indianapolis, Dec 2. Argument that
those who already have confessed
alone caused the illegal transporta
tion of explosives on passenger trains
to blow nn non-union iron and" steel
jobs was followed in the examination
at the "dvnamlte conspiracy" trial to
day of Frank M. Ryan, president of the
International Association of Bridge
and Structural Iron Workers.
Four Cases Dismissed.
After the testimony of Its 649th wit
ness, the government closed its case
and on its own motion had four of the
forty-five defendants dismissed on the
ground that the charges against them
were not sustained.
Hockin Resigns His Office.
Before taking the stand as the first
witness for the defense, Mr. Ryan an
nounced the resignation of Herbert S.
Hockin as secretary-treasurer of the
union. Hockin, a defendant, was sit
ting in court in custody of bailiffs,
having been unable to secure increased
bail ordered by the court nine days
ago, after witnesses described him as
a spy who had helped the McNamaras
organize the "dynamiting crew," and
then had given information to the gov
ernment and to detectives alter quar
rels with the confessed dynamiters.
Mr. Ryan said Hockin's resignation
was voluntary. J. E. McClory of
Cleveland succeeds Hockin.
President Ryan Testifies.
Mr. Ryan testified that neither he
nor the executive board members
knew of any money having been ex
pended by McNamara for dynamiting
purposes. All the letters written by
him to business, agents in various
cities which the government charges
contained veiled instructions about
jobs to be blown up, Ryan said, simply
referred to work upon which non
union men were employed and upon
which it was desired to put union
men.
Hardly Knek McManigal.
"Did you ever talk to Ortie E. Mc
Manigal about dynamiting or tell him
to change his appearance oftener, so
he would not be recognised?" asked
Attorney William N. Harding.
"I hardly knew McManigal, and cer
tainly never knew he was employed as
dynamiter for McNamara or anyone
else. '
Denied Urging Violence.
He stated he never had visited a
vault in the iron workers' headquarters
in Indianapolis where nitro-glycerine
and dynamite had been kept, and he
never had proposed, as charged, that
J. J. McNamara, then secretary of
the union, take Hockin's place as head
of the "dynamiting crew." He denied
he had urged violence in the union's
strike called seven years ago and
which is still on.
Explosion Clipping "Matter of News."
Questioned why he enclosed in a
letter a newspaper clipping giving an
account of an explosion, he explained
It was sent to McNamara as a mat
ter of news. He denied he had told
Edward Clark, the confessed dynamit
er, about blowing up a Job in Cin
cinnati. PERSONAL LETTERS
FROM HAWTHORNE.
Recipients of Them Testify Regarding
Them at Latters Trial.
New York, Dec. 2. Witnesses from
several states today identified some of
the ''personal letters" which Julian
Hawthorne wrote urging them to in
vest in the Cobalt mining properties,
for the aJleged promotion of which
through the mails Hawthorne, Josiah
Quincy of Boston and others are on
trial on a charge of fraud.
John B. Collins, a retired commo
dore of the United States navy, iden
tified a letter in pwhich Hawthorne
wrote:
"All but a few thousand shares have
been sold since I wrote you, and it does
not matter much now whether you
subscribe or not, as there will be buy
ers for all unsold shares, and then the
stock will be listed."
The witness said he did not sub
scribe. George M. Walker of Indianapolis
testified that he bought $450 worth of
stock in response to some of Haw
thorne's letters, in one of which Haw
thorne said: Of course, 1 assume a
certain moral responsibility in urging
you to Invest yodr money."
In another he wrote:
"La Rose and other Cobalt mines are
paying 12 per cent., but we have 20
such properties in our Temagami hold
ings. One thing my friends may be
sure of is that I am not tied up in a
stock jobbing scheme."
Julius Neils, a lumberman from Cass
Lake, Minn., said he was the owner of
10,000 shares in the Hawthorne Silver
and Iron Mines company and some
Temagami-Cobalt mines stock as well.
He produced a letter from Hawthorne
which said:
"We already have sold 450,000 shares
and could sell from two to three mil
ion between now and Christmas, but,
as I told you, only 500,000 shares will
be sold. I want to make it clear that
I am not a promoter. You need have
no fear about the management."
Richard F. Darsll of Scottdale, Pa.,
Mrs. Helen F. Lincoln of Winchester,
Mass., and Aaron F. Jones of East
Douglas, Mass., identified other let
ters.

Court Declares
Merger Illegal
UNION PACIFIC VIOLATED ANTI
TRUST LAW,
SAYS SUPREME COURT
Circuit Court of Utah District to Su
pervise Separation of Two Systems
Involved Court Opinion Unanimous.
Washington. Dec. 2-. The great
Harrlman merger created when the
Union Pacific Railroad company
bought 46 per cent, of the stock of the
Southern Pacific Railway system was
split asunder today by the supreme
court of the United States as a viola
tion of the Sherman anti-trust law.
Thenwlfh the end of the merger be
fore it, the court sent forth its por
tentous declaration that "while the
law may not be able to enforce com
petition, it can reach combinations
which render competition impractica
ble." Unanimous Opinion of Court.
Justice Day announced the unani
mous opinion of the court. Justice
Van Devanter took no part in the
consideration ,of the 'Jase today, but
his principal finding when he was a
Judge of the Utah circuit court, to the
effect that the two roads were not
competitors and therefore no violation
of the law had resulted from the pur
chase was reversed and annulled. In
stead of following the reasoning of
Justice Van Devanter and Judges
Sanborn and Adams, the court in sub
stance approved the minority holding
of Judge Hook that the roads were
competitors and it was Just as much
a violation of the law for one road to
buy the controlling stock of a com
petitor as it was for a holding com
pany, as In the Northern Securities
case, to buy the controlling stock of
two competing companies. As the
Northern Securities plan fell nearly
ten years ago, so the Harrlman plan
fell today.
Establishes Powerful Precedent.
The circuit court for the district of
Utah was directed to supervise the
separation of the two roads after
hearings, and in emergency to ap
point a receiver to sell the stock. The
Union Pacific, if the circuit court sees
proper, may retain control of the old
Central Pacific line from Ogden to
San Francisco. The decision of the
lower court that there was no viola
tion of the law in the attempt to ac
quire the Northern Pacific stock . and
the stock of the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe Railway company, after
wards abandoned, and a certain Inter
est in the San Pedro, Los Angeles and
Salt Lake Railroad company was al
lowed to stand.
It is the general belief here that the
application of the decision to the rail
road situation of the country will be
widespread, placing a powerful prece
dent in the hands of the attorney
general to prevent the consolidation of
competing roads.
Cannot Enforce Competition.
Justice Day in his opinion said:
"We take it that it may be regarded
as settled that a combination which
places railroads engaged in interstate
commerce in such relation as to cre
ate a single dominating control in one
corporation, whereby natural and ex
isting competition In interstate com
merce Is unduly restricted or sup
pressed, is within the condemnation of
the act. While the law may not be
able to enforce competition, it can
reach combinations which render com
petition impracticable.
Suppression of Competition.
'Nor do we think it can make any
difference that instead of resorting to
a holding company, as was done in
the Northern Securities case, the con
trolling interest in the stock of one
corporation is transferred to the other.
The domination and control, and the
power to suppress competition, are ac
ouired in the one case no less than In
the other, and tne resulting mischief
at which the statute was aimed is
equally effective whichever form is
adopted."

Warns Russia That Teutons Will Stand Firmly With

London, Oec. 2. The imperial Gor
man chancellor's statement on tile
European situation, together with that
of Herr Von Kiderlen-Waechtor. the
German foreign secretary, confirming
that Great Britain and Germany are
co-operating amicably in favor of

been renewed for another term of
years and his announcement of Ger

icy upholding Turkey in an economic
sense is likely to influence the dele
gates of all the countries concerned
to discuss peace conditions in the
spirit of moderation already shown in
the armistice negotiations.
Greece Holds Out Against Armistice.
Although there is no change in the
actual situation tonight some misgiv
ing is beginning to be expressed with
regard to the attitude of Greece. Var
ious reasons are assigned for Grpek
reluctance to sign the armistice. Ac
cording to the Greek minister at Paris,
Greece opposes the proposal I hat the
besieged garrisons shall be provisioned
during the armistice and thinks that
the allies ought to have insisted upon
their surrender.
Jealousy Between Greece and Bulgaria
There is no doubt that ji-ulousv ex

Greece asserts that the Greek fleet
played an important role in tin' war.
especially in preventing Turkey from
moving her troops by sea and that
without her navai assistance ihe al
es could not have neliicveii such a
brilliant success. The '.ace between
the Greeks and the P.ulgariuns for
the occupation of Salonilu ami the in
cidents which followed this, increased
the ill feeling and now the Greeks
consider that their Interests are being
sacrificed in the peace negotiations.

DROWNED HERSELF
AND TWO CHILDREN.
Domestic Troubles of Maine Couple
End in Triple Tragedy. .
Rockland, Me., Dec. 2. Mis. Austin
Elwell of Gushing killed her two small
children and herself today, according
to the belief expressed by the police,
by jumping with them into an aban
doned limestone quarry 4"0 feet deep
and nearly filled wilh water, family
troubles is believed to have caused the
act. Mrs. Elwell was 23 years old,
and the children, both .boys, were aged
4 and 5, respectively.
There were no witnesses to the
tragedy. The woman and the chil
dren were seen going into the nuarry
enclosure. Later their outer garments
were found on the edge of the cliff.
On the inside of the children's toous
were found printed the names of I. V.
Elwell and A. E. Elwell. The chil
dren's clothing was neatly folded, even
to the little nightgowns of the chil
dren, which the woman had carried
with her from the hotel where she
had spent the night. The clothing was
identified tonight by Walter Allen,
uncle of the woman.
Mrs. Elwell, friends said, had sep
arated from her husband a year ago.
Since then she had worked as a maid
for a local physician. A few days ago
she returned from a vacation with her
two children and put up at tne notei,
where she was not known. Today she
went out with the children and when
they were seen to enter the quarry en
closure nothing was thought of the
incident. No cries were heard. It is
thought that the woman, taking the
boys by tne hand, stood on the edge
of the quarry and then .lumped, drag
ging the children to death with her.
