At Mantua in Italy, during the recent mob
outbreak, all prisoners were released and later
the' prisons were burned. In time the men
fcvhQ.had been freed became -hungry and, hav-
. IngT nothing and no place to go, most of tnem
pent back to be again locked up. The Jailers,
paving no place to put them, bade them be
gone. That incident throws an illuminating
ridcllght upon the poverty, misery and deao
latlon whicY prevails not only la Italy,, but
UuUe generally throughout Europe.. How
Shankful Americana ought ta be that they are

- The Slump of Exchange.
All currency ha depreciated in value, a
Tact which is attested by the generally high
Bevel of prices. That ia the result of inflation
rhlch the war made inevitable. '
The slump in foreign -exchange, however, is
due to another cause. , It expresses the loubt
af the financial world that the'eountries whose
circulating medium ia Involved will be able
to meet their obligations, present quotations
ihow the general impression in England ia
good for about eighty ' cents on the dollar,
i 'ranee about fifty cents and Germany, for
nbout eight cents. . '
Among the first class powers the United
States is the only one that is considered en
tirely solvent, a circumstance which might be
kauae for self congratulation were it not for
the fact that these neighbors of ours owe us
something like ten billions. Furthermore, their
inability to pny seriously affects their capacity
or buying in our raaVketg, which of itself is
tothing less than a calamity for us.
i Steady deprecia ion of foreign exchange
. lertainly is not strengthening the position of
Americans who have been advocating with
drawing our support from the movement .to
feet the reBt of the world back on ita feet.

J. Use for Army Tanks.
No more, need snowbound farmers get out
nd shovel away the drifts in the read to
kchools and markets. The army tank ia com-
ag on the scene to relieve them of this dis-
greeable form of toil.

pier use of rollers made of wood and drawn

jroCble'is that rollers heavy enough to pack
he snow require a great many horses for pro
pulsion, and sometimes the hone cannot a-et
"through the drifts, even without a load. Army
tanks; having ample power and being built
specially to travel over obstacles, move along
teadlly through even the deepest show and
have a path packed so firmly that animals and
jehlcles will not break through.
The government has turned over thousands
of automobile trucks-to the various stater for
road repair and construction work, and a num
ber of tanks and caterpillar tractors for which
the army now ha bo use will be distribute'!

Alcohol in the Air Derby.
' lieutenant Belvln W. Maynard undoubtedly
spoke the truth when be said that alcohol
figured extensively In the trans-continental air
derby. It is a natter of common knowledge
among those Who frequented the flying field
at Rock Island that a number of the pilots
were drinking. There ia a suspicion that some
of those who. lost their way might not havei
dons so if they had been entirely sober, and
that the same causa figured In the burning oat
of at least one motor. What happened here
may servo to throw light upon things 'that oc
curred at other landing fields, though of coarse
that la merely speculation. .
The pilots themselves war not to be
blamed particularly for this. They were sub
jected to a severe physical ordeal Much of
the time the weather was raw and disagree
able even on the ground. The nervous tension
was extreme and it' was but natural that stim
ulants should have been resorted to. The
flyers, of course, were feted and made much
of wherever thef e waa an opportunity to enter
tain them a"hd their hoata undoubtedly often
pressed stimulants upon them without being
aware of the possible consequences.
Maynard had either, better judgment or
greater self control than a number of his
competitors and so waa spared from the in
evitable reaction which he charges spelled dis
aster for them. " '
' . Some may question whether the flying par
son showed a proper degree of discretion-iu
making the statement he did, but if it cornea to
a Showdown it ia altogether likely he will be
able to find Supporting evidence in Rock Island.
The Cripples of Industsy.
' - In the Interests of ,(he common good no
congress ever assembled framed and passed a
law 'more worthy than the cripples of industry
bill which passed congress at the last session.
It is estimated that fully 300,000 persona in
the United States are injured in the pursuits
of industry each year. More than 10 per cent
of that number require complete retraining be
cause of the nature of their disability, which
does not permit of their return to their old
positions. More than 30 per cent -of, these un
fortunate have dependents. In numerous cases
these dependents have become a charge upon
the community.
The law provides that halt a million dol
lars will be available the first year. Til sec
ond year $750,000 will be available, and the
third year the government will allow 11,000,000
for the rehabilitation of the handicapped men,
women and children. . , ,
Of the money so appropriated the govern
ment will give a dollar every time the state
glvea one to reeducate the disabled man. The
state, however, must enact laws baaed upon
the federal act If they desire to receive the
benefits of thla money. The states are to have
their own examining boards, such boards to
determine who is eligible to reeducation and
training, the .kind of training necessary, -and
the institution to which the handicapped per
son will be sent' The federal bill expressly
provides that the state treasurer must be des
ignated as the custodian of all state funds.
Eacji state, will proceed independently under
a plan agreed upon by the state and the fed
eral government.
It has been the experience of the federal
board tor vocational education that the legisla
tive bodies of the various states have been
quick to meet the government in all acts which
have provided for- the good of the people to
believe that every state will hasten to enact
legislation which will permit it to secure
benefits Hinder the federal bill. The desire to
reclaim the disabled man has a) way a received
attention at the handa of legislative bodies. A
number of states have -already enacted laws
modeled on that of the federal adt, some giving
three or four dollars for every dollar Ottered by.
. the government to carry on this great work.
A FEDERAL BLUE-SKY BILL

(Special Correspondence of The Argua.

extradite him. This any State la reluctant to
do, and will not do unless its own laws recog
nize the man's offense as such, so that usually
the case is dropped. ' ,.
The proposed law would' compel organiza
tions that aell stock in mora than one state,
and make uae of the United S.ates mails In
doing so, to file a statement with the treasury
department. Thla atatement would contain
among other facta the names and addresseaAf
members of the board of directors, and of the
officers of the corporation, and the number ot
shares held by each; a description of the cap
ital and finances of the organisation; and an
explanation of the project. The firm would
have to refer to thia atatement on all advertis
ing literature and in all communications deal
ing with sales of stock, explaining that copies
ot the statement could be consulted at the post
office at the state capital, and offering to mall
a copy free on request.
Persons cheated by misstatements' of stock
selling companies that operated under thla law
could demand a return of funds paid to the
companies and damages fortany losses. Any
misrepresentation of a project would be pun
ishable by a fine ot not more than 35,000 or by
one year of Imprisonment, or by both. The act
provides that a bureau of the treasury depart
ment be created to administer the law.
The mine operators and promoters object
to the present bill on the ground that It would
make it too easy for the .investor to sue the
company, in case it caused him a loss. The
advocates of the law say it would never oper
ate to the detriment of legitimate businesr.
There seems to be general agreement that some
sort of a federal law penalizing deliberate mis
representation is needed.
One factor which holds back enactment of
thla law Is the gold situation. Gold mlnina- has
alwaya been largely dependent on speculation,
and so little gold is mined now that bankers
and business men are apprehensive of a meas
ure, which, they claim, would further curtail
gold prospecting.
Practically all except a few high grade gold
mlnea are idle. It costs 60 per cent more to
produce gold now than five years ago, bat oper
ators cannot raise the price on gold aa it la
fixed at the minta at 320.67 a fine ounce. Manu
facturing Jewelers and spectacle makers are
so hard put to obtain sufficient amounta of gold
that they melt large quantities of aold coin.
The extent of this destruction ot coin by Indus
try is inaicatea ny tne fact that the mints allow
tor . the melting of about 33,500,000 in gold
every year. The present low rate of produc
tion, together with increasing destruction of
coinage causes bankers to fear that we will
find ourselves-without gold to protect our re
serves. . -..-
The value of speculation is a much dis
cussed Question. Without sacculation um an.
thoritles claim, we ahbnld not have developed
at we have Industrially. The telephone, manv
of our oil wells, Cripple Creek and Ooldfleld
old mines are a few outstanding examples
vi succeasiui enterprises cased on speculation.
Against the notable Instances of speculation
that turn out well are the thousands of cases
ot pure swindle. Involving loss to the Investors
that tar overbalance the gains of the brilliant
successes. It Is- these swindle projects. In
which the Investor haa not a single chance to
pain anything, that the federal law would
attack. '
It does not aim to injure legitimate specu
lation, as a certain amount of hazard is neces
sary in investment. The crime of speculation

frail excuse for ascribing tbr-us-

Q. Why did President Wilson
omit any reference to the peace
treaty from his message delivered
at the opening of congress? T. D.'
A The president's message at the
opening of congress is always ad

Is Aspirin Harmful!
Does aspirin have any ill effect
when taken in moderate doses, say
three five-grain tablets a day, for
colds, headache, toothache, etc? (A.
P. L.) ' .
Answer Acetyl-saltcylic acid is
thi official name (aspirin being t'J J
trade-mark name of one brand).
Thia drug aeema to be as effective
a pain-killer aa the older coal-tar
derivatives auch as acetanilide and
phenacetin. It should not be taken
for "colds," in my opinion, unless
under careful medical observation.
From five to ten grains as a dose
will rarely produce depression. Cer
tain individuals, within fifteen or
twenty minutes after even a single
dose of acetyl-sallcylic acid de
velop audden edema (dropsy) In' th
larynx with Violent asthma . and
sometimes hives. One fatality was
apparently produced by 200 grains
of aspirin taken In the course ot
air hours by. a man witninnuenza.
This drag, however, is the least do-
pressing and the least harmful drug
we have for tne reuei oi severe
pain. Persona who habitually use
acetanilide in any of the thousand

What's In a Name?
BY MILDRED MARSHALL.
(Copjrlcht, ISIS, br the Wheeler. Syndicate. Inc.),
Ethel.
Ethel is In itself a? name, but It
has so many suffixes as to seem al
most a syllable itself. It Is another
of the Teutonic names which sig
nify noble, and is derived from
Aethel, the same prefix, which in
high German, is Adal, from which
cornea Adlaide. The early femi
nine form of this simple little name
was Aethelthryth. Another, less
complex, was Ediltrud.
Teutonic and Norse tradition
seem to merge somewhere along
the course of Ethel's history, tor
the splendor of the Valkyr, lingers
in the name. It waa popular among
the women of those early times be
cause it signified the ideal woman
of the period when "a resolute will
and a strong hand were woman's
best title to respect," aa one. writer
, Saint Aethelthryth Was a queen
of the Amazon type who must hay
been a very uncomfortable sort of
wife and who finally -retired to is

Saint Ethelreda. Her saintly name
has come down to us with a smal
degree of popularity, but Ethelberta
and Ethelfreda are much the favor

of all and stands alone aa an inde

you'd do much better." In spite of
himself Kenneth could hot sup
press a smile, but, heeding the ad
vice of his friend, he now began' to
move about more freely. He had
great confidence in his own ability,
and, of course, this helped s16t.
At the end of the first lesson
Kenneth was very hopefuL It waa
ant now. for Kenneth had set his
Heart ;on winning the fair hand of
Boris Atherton, one of the season's
most .charming debutantes, and
Doris, of coarse, was aa adorable
dancer. Kenneth soon realized
St if be was to win his suit with
rls he would have to be a mas
ter of the art.'
' t For .manv months oast tiiev had
attended many dancea together, but ! agreed that he ahould -practice
Kenneth had grown rather tired of
having to "sit out" all the time. ' It
was Just a montXhcfore the ex
. elusive club of which Doris was a
member would have Its animal
danced and Kenneth determined
that if possible he would learn to
trip the light, fantastic" by that
tjme. .
i But how was he to proceed? That
was the question. Of coarse, there
- were several dancing schools at his
dUposl. but Kenneth did not want
to go .aboat it in such a. formal
riner. "I know what ill do,"
soliloquized. "IU have Harvey

three times a week for the nexj

tervals this same procedure was
followed. ...
Finally the fourth week arrived,
and the .club dance Was JuSt three
days away. Kenneth was bubbling
ove with enthusiasm. "Jast think
of It, Harvey." he remarked as the
two glided over the carpeted floor.
"Porta doesn't know a word about

Ton sea, that's what t Intend to do
want until tha last daaee. It will
ha so romaatlc and, to tell you the
truth, that's the only daace of
which 1 am quttf sure. Harvey
agreed that Doris would ho sur
prised and delighted, and thought
Kenneth'a idea of waiting for the
last waltz" a very unique one. I
The great night arrived at last
and as Kenneth donned his evening
clothes he hummed a waits melody
at the same time making hla feet
go through the motions, lest he
should forget "Oh. I'll tell you.
this is the life." he thought No
