President Wilson Has His Doubts About the Dreadnaught
"Who shall tell us now what sort of a navy to
build?" asks President Wilson in his message, and
he adds:
"When will the experts tell us just what kind
we should construct —and when will they be right
for ten years together, if the relative efficiency of
craft of different kinds and uses continues to change
as we have seen it change under our very eyes in
these last few months?"
A good many people, evidently our president
included, have lost faith in the dreadnaught, so
called, but which is a misnomer, but it is very likely
that the experts have not radically changed their
views as to what constitutes a navy.
Let us laymen take a look at what the present
war has shown as to naval efficiency.

One War Tax Enough
ONCE more the papers are printing letters from bu«irtess
men, urging an increase in freight rates.
They're of tfie old tenor: "Give the railroads what they
ask for and it'll make us all prosperous." Tax yourselves
until you're rich.
Who are the business men who are asking for this in
creased tax? Men who produce?
Not so as you can notice it!
They're all of the data of middlemen, who can shove
extra freight rate* along.
Of coorsa, they won't mind a tax increase which they
won't hava to pay.
It's the man who works for wages that must carry the
burden if the railroads get their increase.
His wages won't go up.
His cost of living will.
Why are some business men so shortsighted as not to
see that tha chap whose prosperity they .as tradesmen are
most concerned in isn't the banker, brefcer or speculator
I anxious for a booming stock exchange, but the wage earner
;with a margin to spend?
We've already had one war tax.
One is enough.

They Had It Coming to Them
-T"\EVELOPMENTS since the unemployed raid the other
*XJ night on a Second ave. lunch room, and on the Westlake
market, show the men quartered at the Hotel Liberty had
nothing to do with the trouble, which was inspired solely by
men who wouldn't work if they had a chance.
The trouble makers should be severely dealt with.
The city haa made it possible for jobless men to haw
something to eat and a warm place to sleep at the Hotel Lib
erty. If the slight tasks required of the men in return drove
these rioters fway, as they declared, then they are deserving of
no sympathy.
Beside landing in jail themselves, they made it just that
much harder for other unfortunate men, who WANT work, to
get along.
The Right Man in the Right Place
THE STAJR is glad, indeed, that the organized campaign
being waged by the kept press to discredit municipal
ownership, and the efforts of one afternoon paper to "get" City
Lighting Superintendent J. D. Ross, have not warped Nflayor
Gill's judgment to the extent of co-operating with the Ross
conspirators.
Mayor Gill did the only possible thing by reappointing
Ross. He is the right man on the right job.
Scouts for the Common Good
TIME and again attention has been called to the need of a
"People's Lobby," to sit in watch upon public officials, in
the public interest, ss skilled agents usually do in behalf of
various special interests.
It has not thus iar been found a workable idea, both on
account of the difficulty of finding fit agents wiy enough to
compass the many angles of the public interest in the myria<J
subjects and phases of legislation, arid because of the difficulty
of financing them.
A new factor is appearing in our political life which may
in large measure overcome both of these difficulties—the in
creasing participation of women.
Go to any city hall, any state capital, or to Washington
nowadays and the most conspicuous thing you will see is the
zeal and growing intelligence with which bright women, serv
ing for the most part as volunteers, are keeping tab on what
is going on, emphasizing moral issues and making it hard for
the tricky type of politician to carry water on both shoulders
or to continue his traditional trading in the "double cross."
They're still sometimes fooled; but they're learning fast.
N'o insincere or evasive man holding public office now knows
when his bluffs may be called.
And chaps 6f that type, once so common in our legislative
bodies, are disappearing, while those w4io yet survive, or on
occasions "come back," are learning to be very, very careful.
Germs or Life Term?
NEW York humanitarians are horrified because an Auburn
prison "life termer" offers to be inoculated with cancer
germs for the benefit of science. What's there to be horrified
about? Give us cancer germs, cholera germs, bubonic germs
or any other old germs rather than a life term at any peni
tentiary.

dreadnaughts, has taken no direct action with them,
because the dreadnaught dreads German mines and
submarines, and the German navy lies behind mines
and submarines. Very good. Then a nation on the
defense should be well supplied with mines and
submarines, shouldn't it?
But to say that Great Britain's dreadnaughts
have been useless is to overlook their keeping the
German navy and German commerce bottled up,
while the British navy and commerce are practically
free and unmolested.
It is the opinion of all sorts of distinguished
experts that a long war means victory for the side
which can longest secure the resources of war,
which are food, oil, metals, money, horses and in
gredients of explosives, as well as men to handle
them.

Unless Germany's home resources are so un
limited that can she live and fight on them in
definitely, it is clear that her enemy, with the world
to draw upon, has a decided advantage.
And Germany's bottled-up condition must be
accredited to the dreadnaughts of her enemy.
Germany, the weaker in dreadnaughts, cruis
ers, destroyers and other warships, has been able
to stand off the navies of Great Britain, France
and Russia. Why?
Because her coast line is small and her navy
sufficient to protect what there is of it.

Little Harry and the Dog
Little Harry wanted a dog. He
had many arguments with his moth
er on the subject. He was sent to
a near by grocery. He was gone so
long that hla mother became anx
ious. Stepping to a window, she
saw Harry down the street, man
fully pulling on a rope, the other
end of which 'was tied around the
neck of a small dog. The pup wan
resisting every atop. Braced on
all-fours, It was pulling back with
every ounce of lta small might and
harking as loudly as potslblo.
Presently Harry triumphantly
entered the room. "Mother," he
called, "won't you let me keep this
little dog? It followed ma home."
—Fun.
Faee-to-Faee Courtesy
El OOD telephone service depends largely
upon mutual courtesy. The telephone
is more useful to those who talk as if face
to face, for civility removes difficulties and facil
itates the promptest possible connections.
As in other intercourse, it often happens that
two or more people wish to talk with the same
person at the same time. Without courtesy, con
fusion is inevitable, and the confusion is greater
when the people cannot see each other.
The operators must be patient and polite
under all circumstances, but they will do better
work if they meet patience and politeness on the
part of telephone users.
The Bell Telephone service enters intimately
into the social and business life of each indi
vidual. The best results come through the prac
tice of mutual courtesy.
Every Bell Telephone 'is

Will the experts advise that all these points of

only against battleships that can lie off 15 miles and
demolish a city?
It must he remembered that the first step In
invasion is from the sea and that the army cannot
be relied upon to ward it off for obvious reasons.
When we study Uncle Sam's blessed Mon
roe doctrine, and look at his possessions in Asiatic
and Arctic regions, his coast cities and his canal,
we still must believe him wise in having a navy j
that can sail as fast and shoot as far as the best of
them.
