Tendered Gen. Joe "Wheeler
Washington, Dee. fl.—When the sen
ate convened yesterday to begin tiio
closing session of the Fifty-fifth con
gress the chamber presented a notable
and beautiful appearance. By 11
o'clock the public and private galleries
were filled almost to their capacity
with a distinguished assemblage, in
cluding many ladies in brilliant attire.
On the floor of the senate tlie display
of flowers was unusually beautiful,
even for the opening day of a session
of congress. The odor of the flowers
filled the chamber. The memorable
scenes enacted in the chamber during
the last session and the momentous
events that have occurred since- con
gress last adjourned, created a feeling
of intense expectancy, both by the
spectators and members of the senate.
This was made manifest by the long
lines of people in the corridors anxious
to gain admission to the galleries, and
by the early arrival of senators on the
floor. Through courtesy of the vice
president the members of the joint
high commission were admitted to the
floor of the senate and were the re
cipients of much attention. During a
recess of three-quarters of an nour,
while the senate was awaiting the pre
sentation of the message from, the
president from the president, the mem
bers of the joint high commission held
an informal levee, greeting personally
nearly all the members of the Ameri
can senate. The reading of the presi
dent's message, which occupied two
hours and eighteen minutes, was re
ceived with very careful attention for
an hour, but after that the senators
drifted to the cloak rooms and to the
committee rooms, where they could
peruse the message at their leisure in
the printed copies which had been
furnished,
IN THIS HOUSE.
Rondlnn: of the FollorreQ
Willi Close Atcullon.
Washington, Dec. G. The opening
seasion of congress yesterday was a
spectacular occasion, animated and
brilliant. There were more than the
ugual number of distinguished per
sonages in the thronged galleries, in
cluding many representatives of for
eign governments, high officials and
ladles and gentlemen conspicuous In
social aud political life. Tho greetings
of the members were most cordial and
there was no outcropping of partisan
rancor to mar the occiljiftn. One of tho
most striking incidents was the coi*
dial meeting between' the floor leaders
of the respective sides, Messrs. Diug
ley.and Bailey. In view o*!fne.gossip
about the possibility of Mr. Bailey be
ing deposed as the mUiority leader it
is significant that thfe speaker named
Mr. Bailey as the minority member of
the committee to wait upon the presi
dent, an honor always bestowed upon
the recognized leader of the minority.
Speaker Reed received a warm wel
come from both sides of the bouse
when he ascended the rostrum to call
the house to order, but perhaps the
greatest personal ovation to any mem
ber was that given Maj, Gen. Wheeler
of Alabama, who has not been seen by
many of his old colleagues since he
went to the front at the head of the
cavalry division ot 5en. Shafter's
army. Mr. W. A. Stone of Pennsyl
vania, Mr. McMillin of Tennessee and
Mr. Sayers of Texas, who have been
elected governors of their respective
states since congress adjourned, were
also overwhelmed with congratula
tions. The floral tributes were unusu
ally numerous and made the hall a
veritable bower of beautiful flowers.
The proceedings themselves were dull,
all interest centering in the reading of
the presldAit's message. For over two
hours the clerk droned through the
long document, but the interest of tlie
members and the spectators never
flagged. With rapt attention they fol
lowed the president's recital of tlie
war, and listened,
eagerly to every sug
gestion or recommendation he had to
offer.

DAY PUTS HIS FOOT DOWN
Can't Stand the ^nibbling
of the
Spaniards.
Paris, Dec. 7.—The joint peace com
mission was in session, for over four
hours yesterday. Much of the discus
sion concerned details in the ceded
colonies. The debate, was very ener
getic ami the Spaniards, on emerging,
appeared to be dejected. Secretary
Ojeda, of the Spanish commission,
when Questioned after the meeting as
to the progress, made answer excited
ly: "I am almost mad. I cannot talk.
We are making progress." The Ameri
can commissioners declined to say any
thing further than that the progress
made was satisfactory. The Spanish
commissioners have received- authority
to bind their government on certain
matters, but tl»4e are yet important
questions upon which their instruc
tions are unsatisfactory, and it is like
ly that many of the details involved
iii the change of sovereignty in the
Spanish colonies will be left for set
tlement in the regular manner when
diplomatic relations between the two
countries are resumed. The history of
the document which will certify tlie
passing of the
Oldest Colonial Power
in the world and the advent of the
newest was epitomized by Judge Day
1 in a single sentence:
I "A peace treaty can contain any
thing which the victors put into it."
The Americans have listened for
hours with their customary patience
to tlie technicalities convoked by the
Spaniards with their customary
shrewdness and persistency against
every proposal making for the dis
memberment of their empire. Dark
ness had come on and the liveried at
tendants furnished by the French au
thorities had had placed a tiny lamp at
the elbow of each commissioner. Sen
ator Frye, whose unconcealed con
tempt for diplomatic quibblings ex
cited the astonishment of the punctil
ious Castllllans had stalked home, his
patience exhausted. The burden of
the Spanish arguments was that mat
ters outside the bare cession and evac
uatlon of the conquered territories
.which the Americans proposed to cov
er by the treaty, were beyond the le
gitimate and customary scope of a
peace treat. Behind this bulwark
Senor ltios'fortified himself, bombard
ing his opponents with a
Supply oC Arguments
and precedents which inspired the
freely expressed admiration of the
Americans. Finally Judge Day sum
marized the American position in the
foregoing. memorable utterance. It
was given and taken in good spirit,
aDd from that moment the proceedings
were entii'ely friendly. The session
accomplished much. Eight open ques
tions were canvassed, seven being
practically settled without noteworthy
friction. The commissioners decline
to say what conclusion was reached,
but the bargain for a coaling station
in the Carolines was not cemented,
and, according to present prospects, It
is likely to fail. The temper of the
Americans In this matter is: "We
made you a good' offer for an island.
I You may take it tr leave it."
I The Spanlaids seem disposed to
leave it. The Americans do, not re
gard It as a prize w'hlch they can de
mand as one of the natural fruits of
the war, w-hile the whole policy of the
Spaniards is to confine the negotiations
as narrowly as possible to the letter of
the protocol signed in Washington,
and to exclude all extraneous matters.
The Spanish commissioners continue
"fighting with tooth and nail to pro
cure every possible pecuniary and oth
er concession.
A GIGANTIC FLOUR TRUST.
\Vill Control the Product of the
Country.
New York, Dec. 7.—A gigantic flour
trust has been formed to control near
ly all of the product In this country
and also the supply of three-fourths of
the world. English stockholders in the
big Pillsbury-Washburn Milling 'com
pany ..were reluctant at first to join,
but were finally won over, and the
flour trust becomes a certainty. The
trust will have approximately the
enormous capital of $150,000,000. It
will embrace all the principal mills of
this country and will have a dally ca
pacity of 95,000 barrels of flour, con
sumiug in this manner about 500,000
bushels of wheat. The trust was
formed by Thomas Mclntyre, a pro
moter, who, after working for many
months with untiring energy, accom
plished his ambitious project. Mr. Mc
lntyre for nearly a yea): tried to con
vince ltlchard Glynn, president of tlie.
PUlsbury^-Washburn Milling company,
of'the feasibility of the scheme. Mr.
Glynn left London and came, at Mr.
Mc-Ihtyre's invitation, to this country
last summer. Together they visiterl
the principal mills. Mr. Glynn, how
ever, could not see a large enough ben
cfit in the combination to wan-ant its
formation. New York conferences
"were'held in this city, but they all end
ed In Mr, Glynn refusing to enter the
faclicme.
Mr. Mclntyre, however, was not dis
couraged, and when the British mil
lionaire sailed for England last Octo
ber he accompanied him.. Upon arriv
ing in London he canvassed the princi
pal stockholders of the Pillsbiiry
Washbum Milling company with such
success that a special meeting was
called. It was at this meeting that
Mr. Mclntyre Is said to have finally
convinced the stockholders and to
have accomplished his purpose. The
following mills will, it Is said, form the
trust: Hecker-J ones-Jewell, New
York Pillsbury-Washburn and North
western Consolidated Flour Milling
company, Minneapolis Imperial Mill
company, Anchor mills and Daisy
mills, Duluth William Lispman mills,
Freeman's mills and Miukota mills,
Superior, and Daisy inills, Milwaukee.

termination of Executive Agent Ful

RESULT IN BLOODSHED.
Wonld an Attempt to Arrest In
dians.
St. Paul, Dec. 6. Ed L. Warren,
deputy United States marshal, who
went through the battle of Leech Lake
with the troops, and who is familiar
with all the Indians in the northern
part of the state, having lived among
the Chippewas for several years, said
to a reporter that there was little ques
tion that any attempt to arrest an In
dian on either the Leech Lake or
White Earth reservations would result,
in bloodshed. -The least provocation
would start a war and it would take
many troops to suppress an uprising.
"The Indians are ugly and insolent,"
lie said. "They claim that they won a
victory from tlie soldiers at Sugar
Point and they, are ready to try con
clusions with them again. There is no
charce for r.n officer to go on Either of
the reservations and make an arrest.
The Indians laugh at the officers and
say that they will never be a nested.
They say that they have whipped the
forces of the United States and that
they can wrhlp all that can be sent
against them. As far as an officer is
concerned he is of no more use on the
reservation than a yellow dog." .-
Indians Disappear.
Park Rapids, Minn., Dec. 6.— Four
teen of the White Earth Indians have
been encamped on a small lake about
fifteen miles north of here and have
been killing considerable game con
trary to law. Friday Game Warden
Stephens of Detroit, In company with
D. W. Clason of this place, went oub
and attempted to arrest them. The
Indians resisted, refused to be arrest
ed, drove the men out of the camp and
threatened to scalp them If they came
back. Stephens and Clason came at
once to Park Rapids,- swore out war
rants and placed them in the hands of
Sheriff Rombough. Acting upon orders
from Warden Fullerton of St. Paul a
posse of twenty-five men was organ
ized and went up after the reds. The
sheriff and some of tlie men have re
turned and report that no Indians can
be found. Stephens and others are still
out. Warden Fullerton has arrived
from St. Paul an dis awaiting the ar
rival of Stephens. He says if the cul
prits can be Identified he will go to
the reservation and take them. Trouble
may result.
