Begging tlie Qtxe&tiotx
The Item continues to beg the question of a circulation show-down Try
hedging behind its old fence, the Sun-Telegram. In its last evening's is
sue the Item again repeats its proposition that a committee of Richmond
merchants shall investigate its circulation, and states that such an inves
tigation would take only thirty minutes. According to the Item a cir
culation investigation consists simply of having the number of papers tak
en out us paid for, balance with the amount shown on the cash book. In
reality a circulation Investigation, to bo complete and accurate, must go
much further. The number of papers taken out by the carrier boys must
he checked up with the number of subscribers on their routes. Have the
merchants" time enough to do this? Have they the time to spare to also
Investigate the circulation of tho local papers in the same painstaking
fashion in all the country towns. The Palladium is perfectly willing .to
have a committee of merchants investigate its books to show what its paid
circulation is, at any time they may wish to. But in doing this they will
find that our circulation returns tally with our sworn paid circulation. If
the merchants wish to be absolutely sure of the circulation of any paper,
irrcspe -vivo of its sworn circulation statements, J.hey could not do better
than to put the investigation into the hands of an experienced and trust
worthy circulation auditor furnished by a responsible concern. We sug
gested that such a man be obtained from Print f s Ink, a New York publi
cation, for newspapers and advertisers, which conducts such investiga
tions. We'agreed to pay the cost of an investigation by this concern of
the Palladium. The Item, however late last night, claimed that we had
made this proposition because we intended to bribe the investigator to up
hold our figures. The Item in making this assertion, forgets that all
newspaper managers do not necessarily have such a low sense of honor, as
its manager has. In other words, as a famous King of England said,
'Evil to him who evil thinks.'
However, if the merchants of this city should feel that a man fur
nished by Printers' Ink would not be satisfactory we will suggest another
concernand one which we feel sure the Item will not criticise. We have
reference to an association maintained by the proprietory medicine manu
facturers of the United States. , This association will furnish a circula
tion auditor who conducts the investigation at the expense of the newspa
per. This association, furthermore, is composed of firms whose total ad
vertising bills annually run into the millions, and in pursuing a circulation
investigation it acts in the interests of its members, who like to know
whether they are paying for actual or fancied circulation. We would
like to know whether the Item tomorrow night will dare question the integ
rity of this association.
In trying to get out of having a careful Investigation of its circula
tion, the Item refuses to go In for such "a thing unless both the Sun-Telegram
and the Palladium also go in, and declares that the Palladium owns
the Sim-Telegram and can compel itto also undergo such an investigation.
The Item knows very well that if the Sun-Telegram were controlled by the
Palladium it would be compelled to submit to an investigation. Several
months ago the Palladium and Item agreed to a circulation investigation
providing the Sun-Telegram were included. The Sun-Telegram, accord
ing to its custom, refused and the Item could not bib persuaded to go on
with the Investigation of itself and the Palladium." It was afraid then
and it is afraid now. If it isn't afraid it will be agreeable to an investi
gation of its circulation by the asscciation representing the proprietary
medicine manufacturers of this country. It won't keep dodging behind
its old fence, the Sun-Telegram. The Item in trying to prove that the
Palladium is keeping the Sun-Telegram from an investigation by virtue of
ownership. In support of this contention the Item claims that Mr. Gold
ing, circulation ruanagerof the Palladium, and Mr. Reller, city editor, are
authority for it. Yet both these men deny absolutely the statement of
the Item and brand it a lie. The Item goes on further to state that
Payne & Young, our foreign advertising solicitors, in representing not only
the Palladium, but also the Sun-Telegram, are soliciting business on a
guarantee of thet.combined circulation of both papers at 8 cents per inch.
The Item says it has documentary evidence that such a contract has been
made, but we have one hundred dollars which will be donated to the Y.
M. C. A. if the Item can produce proof of 'this. Really, the managing
editor of the Item is rather hard up to be caught in so apparent a lie as
this. The fact that Payne & Young represent the Palladium and Sun-Telegram
doesn't mean that th interests of the two' papers are identical. The
Palladium is in the morning field and the Sun-Telegram occupies the even
ing field, neither conflicting with the other. -
If tho Item dares show its. circulation it will be willing to undergo a
rigid examination by the association we have named above. But whether
or not tho Item consents, tho Palladium will provide for such an investiga
tion of its circulation by that concern or any other concern acceptable to
Richmond's merchants, and at its own expense- But we are willing to
wager tho Item will again "hedge." ;

the department.
Among the men under consideration
for the place are two army officers,
General Woodruff and Colonel Cool
idge, both well known residents of
this city many years. Captain John
F. Seymour, head of the detective bu
reau of the Wells Fargo Express com

in the local police department, is also
mentioned as a possibility. If the com
missioners go outside of the depart

is probable that one of these three

is not prevented by any legal obstacle.
