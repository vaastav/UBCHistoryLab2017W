The City Connell Committees nn Streets and
Alleys, of the three dlrtelons, held an Important
session yesterday afternoon, the principal business
being the consideration of Aid. Cnllerton's amend
ment to the Fire Ordinance, which gives the owners
of property the right to bolld frame houses, not ex
ceeding (wo stories in height, within certain pre
scribed limits In the Sixth and Seventh Wards.
There were present of tho several committees.
Aid. Gilbert, Carey, Ballard, Daly, Sweeney.
Tbroop, Beldler, Danmgartcn, Tarnow, and
Wheeler. Aid. Ryan and Cnllcrton and several
citizens. Interested In the matter, were present.
Aid. Gilbert presided, and read a copy of
ALD. CULLEHTON’fI AMENDMENT TO TUI FIRE
ORDINANCE,
which is as follows:
Prrnw I. That flection t of an ordinance amend
atory of Chao, ll of the Revised Ordinances, passed
July so, l*74.entitled “Klre Department,” anu repeal
ins an ordinance passed Nov. 24, inn. amending flee,
.'iofsildcliapter.be, and the same Is hereby, amended
so a* to resiT as follows:
••The firs limit* of the City of Cnlcago shall embrace
ami Include within the same all of that district or terri
tory which la now contained within (he corporate limit*
of said City of Chicago, and no building shall be here
after erected within said tiro limit*, imlcsa a permit for
tho erection thereof shall have first been obtained
(rom the flopertmendent of (inllill.igs of said city,
provided frame or wooden buildings, sot over two
stories In height, mav he erected within the following
described territory: Commencing on Stewart avenue
nt li* Junction with Egan avenue, thence north along
the centreline of Stewart avenue In the centre lino of
t wenty-ninth street, thence west on Twenty-ninth
street to llalsted street, thence south on Daisied

city limits: provided, further, that the fee for Issuing
such permit shall not exceed so cents.
bar. 3. Thl* ordinance shall take effect and be in
force from and after Its passage and on publication.
MR. FISHED,
, aproperly-owncr within tho district described In
tho above, appeared before tho Committee and
spoke In favor of the proposed change. Ho said
mat several property-holder* In tbe territory re
ferred to felt as If ihcvhadnot been Justly dealt
with by tho passage of tho last ordinance. Tho
property In the southwestern section of tho city
und been entirely unimproved since the passage of
the Fire Ordinance. Previous to that lot* had
been sold and dwellings constructed upon them.
Now they found It Impossible lo gel the sewerage
In that section sons to build of brick. Thogronml
was so low that tbo water wns wltntn two nr three
feet of the surface, so that brick or stone founda
tions could not bo laid. The Council canid
not give tho sewerage, and therefore they could not
build brick bouses. Another hardship was that
the taxes bad not been materially nimlnisbcd.
They were paying taxes to Improve other portions
of the ettv, and yet they had no imprnvomcnla out
acre. He was paving taxes on properly that ha
vi ould bo very glad to take two-thirds of tho as-
Hossmcnts for. He had property there nnd proper
ty down town which paid the same proportion of
taxes. If they could get the privilege of construct
ing wooden buildings of a stipulated height acres
of such structures could easily and quickly bo
torn down by the Flro Department. The
water supply was also amply sufficient now to pre
vent tho spread of fire. The lots could be sold If
they had tho privilege of building. The editor of
The Tiunuxz had argued that brick houses could
be built as cheaply as frame. That wns not true.
\ man with SffO could get a start by building a
suamv, and finally obtain n good dwelling. To
I ct brick be would have to have $350 at least to
hla rt with.
Aid. Gilbert said the ordinance provided for two
story houses.
.Mr. Fisher sold he would rather have tho height
reduced than not have the ordinance passed atoll.
Aid. Gilbert looked ovorihe document again,
and said tbo ordinance read, ••Not to exceed two
stories.”
ALBERT CRANE,
n real-estate dealer, addressed the Committee, lie
said he had a largo pecuniary Interest In tho terri
tory covered by tho amendment to the Fire Ordi
nance. lie had lost twenty*threo buildings In the
Great Plro, and ho did believe that a man who Imd
thirty or forty acres of land, which perhaps ho had
held for years, ought to have tho privilege of
creeling tt least detached buildings upon It. Tho
city was not burned twice by isolated small frame
houses, but by largo wooden buildings that were
hazardously occupied, lie owned property whero
tho occupant could nut up small frame buildings,
and tbs probability was that the terri
tory would never need brick houses.
to cited tho case of a Mr. Foster, who had
udeavored to raise cabbages no a tract
bind In the southwestern portion of tho cltv, amt
1 mild only obtain a cent uplcco for them, whereas
he cnuld have rented tho property urafilubly if ho
mold have built frame buildings upon it. Tho
speaker owned twenty acres on Thirty-fifth street,
for which ho gave S<iO,OUO live wars ago. 110
'Hide to realize anything on It. • Taxes had been
levied and paid on It. and he asked the gentlemen
to tell him what ho was going to dowTltilt. 110
spoku of Mr. ShurtlefTs Inability to rent a hrlck
house lie had built on his property, and that
ip'iitlcman had Informed him that ho bad no cn*
• inirngunicnt to build more. The speaker dealt
largely with poof people, mid bo. know how they
n-oro situated. They were honest, hard-working
men, who voted right every time. They made In*
significant payments on the lots they Iwught of
him. und ho knew their nerds. They could got
umber on credit, and as many of them were car
penters, or their friends or relatives were, they
• uuld soon cruet a small dwelling that would an
swer until they could obta'na butter one. Rut
thuy could not get brick on eruitlt; the brick-man
ulacturers did not care to sell them small quanti
ties when they could come down town and
sell large quantities to rich men. In tho
outskirts of tho city they must build
frame dwellings in order to have the
Innd improved. It would not be of sneb great Im
portance but for tho taxation, ilo had Just strug
gled through paying hls.tnxrs. Ilu never know of
Miy largo firo where small dwellings bad been tho
cause of burning up a city,.
Aid. Gilbert referred to the danger from sonth
nest winds, and tho speaker sold he never knew of
my such buildings as those desired selling fire to
nelly, Acres of them could bo pulled down by
the flremeu In a short time, and there was gen
erally Insurance enough on them to enable the
owners to rebuild. He had bad men come to
blm and ask him to take hack tho lotvho had sold
them, after they had partially paid fur them and
iimnd themselves unsblo to build upon them.
They were honest men, whoso hands were harden*
* d by toll, and they were not Ilka some of tho arts*
I'icratlc class whom he knew of. And they voted
tight every lime.
Aid. Duly asked the gentleman bow ho knew
they voted right. '
Mr. crane said ho bad talked with many of them:
luit bo would not discuss polldcol matters with the

SAVED BY FEIGNING DEATH.
o*rrt*poniHree Dearer (CW.) AVtcs.
Thoro are on tho foothills in Gunnison County,
at this season of the year, great numbers of deer
and elk, with many mountain Hons and bear.
William Yule and brother left Mr. Preston's ranch
on the Gunnison a few days ago to hunt for deer
Irad elk. A wagon drawn by two animals, guns,
ammunition, and provisions completed Ihclr out
fit. They traveled oil day and reached tho hills
about nightfall and encamped. Seeing the next
morning a good deal of signs of game, they con
clndcd to remain at least one day, and try their
luck. Early In tbo morning they started In differ
ent directions with guns, powder, and ball, of
conne. After going about five miles from
camp and seeing no game, William Ynlo
concluded to return. He .had proceeded but
a short distance before bo heard, as ho'
thought, the ruitllry? of tho dry
loaves. Looking np, he saw, only about thirty
yards from him, a huge bear coming directly to
ward him, with open month, growling, and giving
other evidences of a thirst for blood. Yule waited
until the bruto came within a few paces of him,
when ho took deliberate aim, bat unfortunately his
gun missed fire. I
Tho ferocious boast ran directly against the
hunter, knocking him down, and as quick as
thought Yule turned ovcronhls face and feigned to
bo dead. Tho boar bit him severely in four places,
disabling one arm and ono leg. After tho lapse of
a fow minutes, neither feeling nor hearing tho beast,
Yule cautiously raised bis head, and saw hla an
tagonist about thirty yards off, apparently cover
ing up something with grass. Seeing a tree near
him, he made up his mind to reach It and get up it
If possible, even though seriously wounded. So
off he crawled through the snow, keeping an eye
attentively on the bear and the tree. Reaching
tho tree, he started to climb it, and tho bear
started from bis retreat directly toward him,
growling and gnashing his teeth. He soon reached
the tree. Ynlo bad gone np only a few feet—Just
high enough (or bis own safety, nut not too nigh
for tho bottoms of his feet to be touched by the'
nnso of tho beast. He again attempted to use bis
gun, but In vain. Tho animal whined, growled,
and gnawed at the tree. After a while he returned
to what appeared to ben largo pile of grass, and
commenced again to work as though be was con
cealing something.
Yule, though suffering much from cold and his
wnnnds, resolved to ma'xo a last effort to save bis
life. Ho descending cautiously to tho ground
while tho bear was at work, ho crawled a few
steps 111! begot a low, bushy tree between himself
and tho bear, watching tho animal closely In tho
meantime. He could not travel more than a
hundred yards at a time without resting. At last
bo reached the camp, completely exhausted,
Tho next day Col. fashion, James Preston. P.
T. Stevens, and JotmM. Smith armed themselves
and went to tho scene of the fight, and when
within about thirty-five or forty yards of a large
f ile of straw, they saw a large bear emerge there
rom and make toward them, evidently with tho
Intention to fight, but he did not proceed far be
fore ho fell, pierced with ten balls. He weighed*
800 pounds gross, and was neltbera grizzly nor a
cinnamon, but a cross between tbe two, called
sllvcr.llp or range bear, a malignant and ferocious
beast. Covered up in .hts bed was found a largo
dead doer, which It was supposed a mountain lion
had killed and the boar bad stolen.
** COGNAC ♦» CONQUERED,
/fun /hisefsco Mall.
A trial took place yesterday afternoon at tho
Rcconl Stables of the new electrleblt. * * Cognac,"
the man-oattng Porcboron stallion, bad the first
benefit of tho Invention. Tho horse and hts vices
hare heretofore boon described by the J/alf.as also
tho numerous escapes of Prof. Taff, who Is at
tempting to subdue tho brute. About 3 o’clock
tho round tent In tho rear of tho stable, fitted up
somewhat after the style of a circus, was well filled
with spectators. The ring was boarded up some
eight feet high, to prevent any of the visitors be
coming food for tho horse, who roamed about bis
den socking whom bo might devour, and one gen
tleman, leaning over the rail. Cognac roared and
went for bis arm In the atyle of a terrier for a rat,
and almost succeeded In hauling blm over Into the
ring.
A rope having been attached to the animal’s
halter oy the Professor through a partly opened
door, It was passed around a post outside of tho
arena. Tad then entered the inelosuro and fast
ened another rope to tho nolo In the centra of tho
tent. When the horse had been thus secured, he did
not look particularly vicious, and submitted to have
a brldlo headstall fastened on. with no other mani
festations of dislike than shaking hla heademnbat-
Icollv. This being accomplished, the Professor
showed those present the hit and reins. Tho former
Is of leather, leather holng a non-conductor, and
a wire passing down each roln culls round the bit
on both sides, leaving tho centra clear. The op
erator carries tho battery in bis breast pocket.'
Two wires from tho Instrument go down the
alcoves of tho coot and terminate In tuo gloves, on
each thumb of which Is a copper button to corre
spond with thebuttanson the reins at the lermimw
tiimof the wire. Therefore, when the copper on
tno thumbs touches tho copper tin the reins, the
connection Is made and the electric currant passes
downono rein through the horse’s Jaw and up tho
other. The bit being adjusted, several slight
shucks were administered, which d.d not at all
improve the animal’s temper. Thu rope fastened
to the aide of the circle waa cast loose and held by
an attendant, and Taff proceeded to lean the horso
around the Inelosuro hy the relna. Cognac, how
over, objected to bis first practical lesson In elec
tricity, and made a lively fight fur about ten min
utes, the rope on one side and tho reins on tho other
preventing him from doing actual mischief, 110
resred sad sparred with bis forefeet snd meant
business, tbo Professor finding It difficult to
make tho connection snd apply the electric
shock. Alter a liino ho succeeded, admin
istering shock after shock, and driving tho hursa
backward around the arena. When the animal was
subdued, bo allowed himiclf tu be backed and led
around, and oven permitted tbs attendant to touch
hts head. The horse sweated considerably and ap
pcarrd much quieter. The Professor slated that
he considered the experiment a success, as never
before had he been able to lead or back the animal,
nor had his assistant gone in front of him and
touched hts head. This may bo so, and Tad’s nerve
and perseverance may be crowned with success,
and the animal rendered moderately quid, built
is very questionable! whether his bad qualities mar
not bo transmuted to hts descendants to tho third
and fourth generation, and whether be is really
worth the trouble and risk of taming. He has al
ready killed ono man, and, la the opinion of many,
the nest way uf taming him would be to out a bul
let through his brain.

LAOV FRANKLIN IN AMERICA.
Wrfflnla Citg ( ,V/p.) Knteroriu.
Ry the Eastern papers we see (hat Thomas M.
Harry, second mate oftbe A. Houghton, a whaling
hark that was lost while on a crulso In Hudson's
Hay, has, after numerous adventures, reached
New York, having In hts possession relies of Sir
John Franklin, and knowledge of tbo whereabouts
of a cairn supposed to contain the boogs and other
valuable articles so tong searched for. This re
minds ns that Lady Franklin paid a visit to this
city In 1801. The fact Is probably unknown,
however, to many Virginians, except those who
were then residing In the city.
Fho was accompanied by her niece, Miss Cray
croft, and camo hero from Steamboat Springs, tak
ing rooms at tho house of Charles L. Ros*. While
here her ladyship visited and examined the mines
of the Ophlr and Mexican Companies, then work
ing in their first bonanzas, far west of where they
are at present mining. During her stay here she
was visited by many citizen*, ladles and gentle
men, who were desirous of paying their respects
lo her.
During the evening of her stay a note was hand
ed to her, asking. In very proocr terms, that the
writer, a Mr. Hall, might bo permitted to present
himself, ho having been much In the scrvlco of Sir
James Ross and Sir John Franklin. Ho was in
stantly admitted, and related many things that bad
occurred In Anstralla, which served to enable
Lady Franklin to connect him In matters in which
herself and Sir John had borne prominent parts.
This Interview was hardly ended before another
excitement was caused by the presentation of C. J.
Sullivan, now dead, but at that tlmo ono of our
substantial citizens, and a most Ingenious me
chanic and worker in Iron.
Mr. Sullivan related to Lady Franklin tbo man
ner In which ho had been connected with herself
and hnshand, in a way at once so lerae and feeling
as to bring tears to her eyes, causing quite a little
sensation among those present. Sfany old resi
dents will remember tho splendid Iron gale wronght
by Mr. Sullivan at bis blacksmith shop on North U
street, called tho •* Golden Gale ” and much ad
mired by nil who were capable of Judging of such
work. Mr. Sullivan, ll now came out, was armorer
of tho ships Erebus and Terror, In tho Antarctic
Ocean, while on n voyage of discovery lo the
South Pole, leaving Lady Franklin and Sir John
at Van Diemen's Land, of which colony Sir John
was then Governor. On the return of tho
ships to England Mr. Sullivan received n mes
sage from Sir James Ross, at Woolwich, desiring
him to Join tho expedition In tho capacity or
armorer on the voyage which proved to be tho last
ever made by the distinguished navigator nnd hts
nnfortunate party. Mr. Sullivan did not go on ac
count of tho strung opposition of hla friends ami
relatives, therefore escaping all tho terrors, suffer
ing*. and (ho sad fate of Sir John Franklin and hla
entire command.
The dignified and respectful manner In which
these and many other circumstances were related
by the old seamen, connected with the fact of her
meeting with her old fellow-voyagers so unexpect
edly In this far-away and wild point In her travels,
no doubt produced an effect upon her ladyship's
mind which earned her long to remember her visit
to the Comstock Lode.
CLEOPATRA’S COSTUME*
A Vic Fork J/erald.
A pointed crown of gold glittered on a work*
table In a private parlor of the Coleman House, Into
which a reporter ws» ushered on sending op hts
card to Rose Brtlnjre. It served to recall the pur*
pose of his visit, which bad grown somewhat dint
and Indistinct under the greeting glance of tho now
Cleopatra's flashing dark eyes*
“Goodevening, madamo," said tho reporter,
about to seat hunsolf-fhe la somewhat short-sight*
cd—on some needlework,— Cleopatra’a needle*
work, which tho lady had evidently laid aside when
sue arose to receive her visitor.
“Good oven—not there, please. Take this
■eat," said the hostess, with one majestic sweep
of tho arm removing tho reporter from his Inso*
core position, half standing, half sitting, and with
the other catching up tho menaced danger, which
bad an eye, softly bright, and was threaded.
There waa a pause—composure on the part of tho
lady, a light perspiration and speechless gratitude
as concerned the reporter.
* * Can 1 serve you In any way}" queried Cleopa
tra, calmly.
Tho reporter was about to remark that If a life of
gratitude for what she had already averted, if do
votion. undying, deep—but the pointed crown re*
called him.
• • 1 read in a paper. ” bo remarked. * • that whon
a dressmaker Interested with making your cos
tumes for Cleopatra went to see Picon’s painting,
to which she waa referred for suggestions, she
came sway saying that the whole matter might bo
more properly referred tu a Jeweler. I have been
sent to ask—"
It might hayo been fancy, but the reporter
thought that at this moment the lody’a face was
convulsed with laagbter. He paused.
“Pray continue."said Cleopatra, “you have
been sent to ask—}"
“Why."
“WhyT"
“ Why: yes. m’m."
“ I Infer," said the actress, *’ that you are not
familiar with Picon’s painting of Cleopatra. ”
Tho reporter confessed bis Ignorance, and a
creepy, uncomfortable feeltngcame over him as
the thought entered hts mind that perhaps bo bad
trodden on dangerous ground, *
“ What—ls—Tho—costume}" he managed to say.
“Why should a Jeweler have been mentioned In
connection with tbo matter? Of-what—does—lt—
consist}’’ be blurted out, getting warm.
Cleopatra rose to her full height, and tho word
came from her line with unmistakable clearness:
“ A necklace."
Tho reporter bloshlogly withdrew.

“ First In wore, first In piece," as the man said
when tbo patch la the bay-window of hts trousers

THE PRESIDENT'S MISTAKE.
To (he Editor of TAs Tribune.
Chicago, Dec. 7.—That tho South nnd North
west aro thoroughly dissatisfied and dishearten
ed with tho President’s financial policy, as ex
pressed in that wonderful message, Is very ap
parent on alt sides. I have not spoken to a
man who haft not expressed himself thorough
ly, determinedly opposed to that policy, wlflch,
if carried out to the letter, will no doubt bank
rupt every enterprising man in tho land. Is
there no appeal from the President’s position)
Cannot tho press and people keep up such a
racket that our Congressmen and tho President
will bo obliged to take cognizance? Is It possi
ble that ono-tbtnl of the country—numbering
among them all tho “goldltcs” of tho New
England States and Now York, who ore clamor
ing to be paid 16 or 20 per cent more than they
loaned—snouid rule tho other two-thirds In a
matter so unjust and one-sided? They got up
•a delegation of Wall street speculators and
eent them to tho President, presumptiously
begging him to disregard the erv for help from
two-thirds of the nation, and the President
seems to have listened to them, and gratified
their wishes as far as ho could. Is it nut übout
time for the people of the Northwest and South
to organize their delegation to wait upon tho
President and Congress I Cannot tho people
and the press throw such force and earnestness
into this all-important matter that ho wilt
be obliged to reverse his decision? Cannot
there be such a noise made os to ralso a two
thirds majority and pass the Blond Silver bill
over the President's veto?—os It seems sure that
he will veto such a bill If it is passed. Many
people believe that It this policy of tbo Presi
dent—which seems to have been put into Ids
mouth by John Sherman and tho rest of his
kind—ls persisted iu It will counteract all the'
good feeling aroused among conservative people
by Ids Southern and Clvll-Scrvlco policies; In
fact, ids message Is humiliating to Ids friends, as
it omitted many Important things, and on
finance it showed ho did not understand the
subject, and had not taken tho trouble to - post
himself, but simply said what ho was told to
say. lam a constant reader of your valuable
paper, as I am of many others, and 1 have no
ticed, by the careful and logical way you have of
reasoning, you oltcn change public sentiment
from wrong channels Into right ones, and If you
will only keep up an incessant war upon this re
sumption scheme, and continue to show up that
swindling demonetization of tho M silver dollar,”
you wilt do much good and gratify your patrons.
Respectfully, J. F. COQDLT.

To the Editor of The Tribune.
West Dkpzbb, Wls., Dec. o.—Noticing your
editorial respecting tho President's financial
policy, permit me to give, for tho benefit of the
readers of TiibTriuunb, asolutlonof tho matter.
Tho strength of tho opposition to the remonetiza
tion of silver, In Mr. Hayes' mind, Is John Sher
man. Tho weakness of Mr. Hayes’ financial pol
icy is John Sherman. The aristocracy of debit is
John Sherman. Tho powcrbebtnd the throne in
finance In this Administration is John Sherman,,
and tho reason is found In tho Sherman family
publication that mentioned R. D. Hayes for
President before tho Cincinnati Convention.
It is useless to waste argument In the rase.
John Sherman believes In the single standard
of value, and he is too shrewd and too old a
politician to bo thwarted, especially with tho
prestige bo bos with this Administration.
C.A.W.
CURRENT OPINION.
It la plain In Its nlntomonta and dlspaasion
ate In tone, and It bean throughouttho clear marka
of being the sincere utterance of an earnest man,
having strong convictions of duty, and conscious
that bo Is striving to do what Is right and best for
bis country.— lWlodstpMa Ltdgtr {lnd.).
As o whole, this message, so clear of pas
sion or personal policy, so moderate In statement
and argument, will be widely acceptable, and will
tend largely to strengthen llio popular conlldence
In tho honesty, integrity of purpose, and sincerity
of the President. —Phdadtlphia Trttt Ultp.).
It ia a calm, dignified, and auggeutivo pre
sentation of the manifold phases of national
affairs, and tho recommendations made are gen
erally wise and well considered. It la a far abler
document than any of Grant's messages, and bears
tho impress of a thoughtful rolud.— Loulsvills
Vourier-Joumal (Dim.).
It will bo soon that Mr. Tlayea boa heark
ened diligently unto tho specious pleadings of tbo
resuwptionists, and that ho docs not yearn vio
lently fur tho dollar of tho fathers. On other mat
ters ho moralizes In a stylo which. If not vory edi
fying, is calculated to do nobody any particular
harm.— /idthvills (Ttnn.) AmtHcan
Tbo message draws tho linos sharply.
There can bo no miatako about Its moaning.
Nothing la loft to Inference; nothing lo evaded.
Ou Ita olaln declarations tho people must divide
Into two distinctly-marked parties, and the fight
will bo as desperate as has been known since the
War was ended.—A'rw York Jicsuing Mail {Utp.},
As a wbolo tbo message will meet with
general approval. In atyle, phraseology, and
grammatical construction It is so decided an lm
rrovementontbe worm-fence English of Grant,
hat persons of literary taste wilt In some measure
lm reconciled to Us author as tho usurper of tho
Presidential office,— I/arrltburg Patriot (Dun.),
There ia a look of posiUveuosa on subjects
where It would be expected; yet, lake It through
out. It will be regarded, with tho exception of tbo
Houlhern policy part, ua sound In aeutiravnl, end
plain and practical In tone. Even as regards the
Southern policy, the general sentiments underlying
It are correct.— JHUtburg Cmntntrclal UanUt

Tito President nsod a good many words to
say very Uttlo. Except tho firm position he has
taken on tho financial question, there Is Uttlo In his
first message to impress the country with tho
strength otitis convictions ,or his confidence in
himself to euccossfully enforce tbo policy which
he takes such pains to defend.—AVie York Vom*
mtreial Aditrlittr (/fee.).
Mr. Hayes stands by his colors in his
message. Me defends tho Southern policy as
based on popular demand, foreshadowed by his
own pledges, and now vindicated by puollo
opinion, and by Us qwn visible success, ills treat
ment of tho financial question Is admirable. The
other poluta of tho message are happily tame.—
Upringfitld (J last,) Rrjuilleaa (/n<i,).
Tbo President has given tho world another
proof of firmness. Where many men'occupy the
position he occupies, subject to similar Influences
and trials, would vacillate, aud perhaps yield a
point, we find that the mao occupying the highest
position in tbs gift of the American people dis
play# a degree of courage lo expressing bis con
victions that must command tbs respect of the
people.— l*Uttburg CKronUl* iUtp.),
Tha reading of Presidential messages Is
ofie of those eaadmfee which editors cannot avoid,
and which none but editors can survive; sod we
can confidently ssy that tualong aud sad experi
ence we have never kuuwo a Presidential message
ia Which so copious a flood of wotds submerged so
•mall an amount of Ideas as In the utterances of the
truly good H. U. Daves. It Is In Hearts' worst
velu.— at. Louis Gloat-Dtmocrai {lisp,).
Although not a State paper of marked
ability. It Is of more (ban average perspicuity of
Executive messages, and lu general will compare
favorably with any that bavo been laid before us In
recent years. On one or two uuestlous it uigbt
have been mure aggressive, particularly on that of
Clvil-Bcrvicu reform, sluce the Administration has
made eo much of It In other ways, but it cannot be
denied that ou the whole frankness has been well
tempered by prudence.— d'MladtlpMa Timts

The Southern policy la treated with a cer
tain ulry aud beaming cheerfulness that may or
may nol be Intended to bide auapologoliu teuduucy
of seutlinvot, but which Is certainly wide thu
vehicle foraotuo fine writing la the 1770 vein, lie
Is eminently correct, though, in the propoeltloo
that the policy bos brought about a wry much im
proved condition of things iu tbu Houlb. And fur
this the Booth is eo grateful that the i'rewldeol has
our full permission to make whatever excuses ha
sees fit to bU party,—.Vim Orltant 'Punts iVem.).
Tho first annual message of President
Mayes Is calculated to produce a favorable Impres
sion both el bout aud abroad,as well from Its gen
eral tone and spirit as from tbs soundness and
good sense of IU principal recommendations. It
Is entirely free from the tone of sertlminllsm and
partisanship which has characterized sumo recent
message* to Congress. Ills equallr freo from any
thing like egotism, and even where tho President
allude* to the adverse rrltlcl*m which has been
ps-sert upon his Southern policy Is without a Iraro
of qnerulousness or personal feeling.— Baltimore
Sun ( Ind .).
Tho slmng point of President Hayes’ first
message Is it* dear, hones L-manly (one on the re
sumption nml sPvcr questions. Tho weak points
are Its tamo and empty treatment of the f’lvll
Service and Its complacent illusion* ns lodic
South. The fair points are Its remaining direct
and succinct summaries of public matter*. On the
whole, ll I# a very creditable paper—not hold,
striking, and commanding, but plain and sensible,
written In good taste, marked by excellent temper,
and calcnlated to leave ajucasant personal Impres
sion.— Albany Etenlntf Journal Utep.). .
Tho Republican party la pledged to ronin
tain the public credit, and provide the people with
a stable currency. Its traditions, Its hlslorr, and
ail Its national plalform* are plain and tmsilive nn
these point*. Now, Is It not time that nil uur Re-
Imbltcan friends who have been led astray by
icmocratle heresies about stiver should return (o
the straight path? Tho President shows them the
way. Let no man lag behind. Leave (o tho
Democrats ail schemes for scmi-repndiatlon and a
depreciated currency. Onrs Is the party of sound
money and national honor.— Cleveland Herald
Http.).
The appeal on paper for the prompt pun
ishment or any farther lawlessness has a thin ami
far-off sound, and the Presidential assurance that
••whatever authority rests with mo lothls end I
shall not hesitate to put forth ” partakes almost of
tho nature of a Joke. If, upon tho formal requisi
tion of tbe Governors of South Carolina and Louisi
ana, no constitutional authority could bo found
for retaining a mere handful of troops In these
Elates, how, (hen, shall Federal force enter upon
tho soli of a sovereign Slate without request from
Its local authorities? Have tho Chisolm or tho
Hamburg murderers come to Judgment? Nay, Is
it not an open fact that tho prosecution of the lat
ter was suspended with Administrative consent?-*
Cincinnati Ttrnes {Hep.).
Considered by itself, it is bo compact,
calm, dignified, and scholarly: to Imbued with tbe
spirit of I ho loftiest pitrlotismand cultured states
manship, ns to make It ono of the strongest possi
ble arguments In favor of Civil-Service reform. It
is Impossible not to contrast It with messages
transmitted to Congress by other Presidents, and,
so contrasting it, not to see how 111-favored they
are beside It. It demonstrates that Chll-Servlco
reform has began in tho highest office of all, and
that It Is to work down to tho lowest from a fit be
ginning. While sometimes disagreeing with tho
President In hla conclusions, we yet have nothing
hut commendation for tnat which wc feel to be the
ablest message transmitted to Congress since tho
term of Abraham Lincoln.— Philadelphia Inquirer
I Hep .).
Tho message of President Hayes is im
portant for nothing but for Us expressions npon
tho financial questions, and those utterances have
been already anticipated. That ho will veto any
bill providing for free coinage of silver and for lu
nulimlted tender, 1* evident. Tbo veto will lead
to more important results than unr Presidential
act since Lincoln slgucd the Emancipation Procla
mation. It wilt arouse a deep Indignation, which
will grow and widen as men discuss it. audit will
cause a new organization of political forces. It
will have tho effect of the firing on Sumter: It will
awaken tho spirit of tho people. Wo thank Presi
dent Hares for his message, and wo shall thank
him for his veto. He Isa powerful Instrument in
a great cause,—such an instrument as George 111.

Joffctson Davis was in emancipating Slavery.—
Terr*Haute Exprttt Und,).
When Sir. Boutwell, who was Secretary of
the Treasury, was dropped from (lie Senate, be
was appointed at ss,oi}() a year to revise the Re*
vised Statutes of (ho United Slates. We suppose
this to hara been done under the Civil-Service
rules, because ho wasn't a lawyer. There could bo
no position bettor calculated to Inject Into tho laws
curtain phrases and sections for tho convenience
of tho schemers who havu special Interests in our
legislation. Mr. Uontwcll Is onoof the persons
who were engaged in tho trickery of demonetizing
silver. The great omission of the gold-sharps was
in nut Including in tho Revised Statutes or 1874
the Refunding act of July 14,1871). If they had
dono so. tho "coin of standard value of tho
present date" would hare referred to a time subse
quent to iho abstraction from the people of the
silvcropttun,—that Is, to thcTdaio or tho adoption
of the Revised Statutes. In that case, tho face
of tho bond would have been changed to corre
spond, and the bonds Issued under the Re
funding act—tho 4 per cents, for Instance—would
have been gold bonds. Mr. lloutwcll may enter
tain the high purpose of completing his work as
Secretary of the Treasury In throwing the Refund
ing act Into tho next volntno of Revised Statutes,
with the usual repealing clause of all conflicting
legislation. This would make tho bonds thereafter
Issued gold bonds, lawfully and inevitably, at once
and always. Will tho great American statesmen
wbo aro interested in tho rights of the people—that
dragon of financial vlrtno, Mr. Uarflcld, for In
stance—see that there Is no more surreptitious
American legislation In the interest of tho British
gold policy! Don't let this change of bond-contract
bo accomplished through tho careless acceptance
ofassurances that there la nothing now that Is im

EXAMINING ARCHITECTS WANT TO BE
PAID.
To (As .Editor a/ The Tribune.
CntcAao, Doc. o.—Two years ago last Jane tho
Common Council directed the Maror, byaonanl
muus vote, to employ seven of the oldest and most
distinguished architects of this city to examine the
new Custom-Housebuilding, to ascertain whether
It was the worthless and nnsafe thing which Ur.
Superintending-Architect Potter and tho Washing*
ton Commission bsd declared It to be.
They had said Its foundation waa nnsafe, and
that It must be palled down. The people of this
city were not satisfied with (heir verdict, and de
manded that the case should bo carried to a higher
court oMneulry, composed of our own beat archi
tects, who were familiar with the soil of Chicago,
and were competent Judges in regard to the
aocurlty of the foundations of the great build
ing. Tub Tribune, as the exponent of pnbllo
opinion, and some other papers, iterated and reit
erated the demand, until tho Mayor, at tho request
of the Council, appointed Messrs. Van Osdel,
Uoylngton, Whecloclc, Uaaer, Hurling, Egan,and
Chesbrougb to do tho work and report to that
body. Tliovcompllea and mado a roost exhaustive
and scientific Inquiry Into all the matters which af
fected the safety and permanency of tho structure,
and reported that tbu soil, foundations, walls, ma
terials, etc., which had been condemned were right
and safe, and that, with some slight modifications
which they suggested, tne edifice could be complet
ed. The Council accepted tho report, transmitted
It to Washington, and Secretary Urialow appointed
another Commission, which came, examined,
availed themselves of tho laborious Investigations
of the Chicago architects, and reported to the
Secretary in favor of the security of the founda
tions, the character of the stone, tho solidity and
safety of tha walls, and of the completion of the
building. In short, after four days' examination,
for which tho United Slates Government paid them
tu.coo, they confirmed the Judgment of tho Chica
go architects, based upon the work of nearly four
weoki. Messrs. Van Osdel ami Daaer went to
Cincinnati and Uuvna Vista, at their own expense,
and made a thorough investigation Into tho quality
of the atone of those quarries and of the
buildings erected of the Duona Vista
stone In Cincinnati. Tor this arduous work
■nd this exhaustive and painstaking examination,
Indicated In thulrelaborate report six of those gen
tlemen—Ur. Chesbrougb, being In the city's serv
ice.excepted—rendered tbolr bills, which amount
ed In all to 53,4U0.—1.e.,4200 less than tho United
Slates Government paid three men for four days'
work. This bill the Common Council declines to
pay, advised by the Law Ddpartmout that it has
no legal right to do ao. They should have thought
of that before they ordered the work done. It
comes with a bad grace from tho representatives
of a great city to employ seven of tho finest experts
In the city to do tbclr work, and then lull them
they bavo uo authority to pay the bill,
Thutthu city ought to pay these gentlemen for
tbolr services and expenses, however, suouis plain
from tho following considerations: The city,
through Us Council, has a right to protect Itself
against dangers to Its citizens threatened by build
ings built ou Insecure foundations, with Imperfect
material aud cracking walls. If to adord such pro
tection Is not a "municipal purpose," for which
the Council has a right to Impose aud collect taxes,
why do they assume this power, and why have
they crusteduu Executive Department, with a Su
perintendent of Buildings and a stall of tun sub
ordinates, whose right end duty are to supervise
all the buildings which are erected In the city, end
to pull down, if tho owner will not when ordered,
any building which puts in peril the citizens of
Chicago? Here was an Immense structure being
erected by the Government of the United Stales,
which the Supervising Architect and a Commission
of throe Government experts had pronounced un
safe on Its foundations,—resting ou **a bed of
mud," constructed (of Imperfect soft stone, with
walls already dangerously cracked, end so worth
less that It must bo pulled down. . This waa prims
facie evidence of (lie dangerous character of this
great building, which Justifldd the Council in in
stituting an Inquiry. Tha Mayor had nut yet an-
Eolnted tbo bupcrlntendeut of Uuildlugs, and,
ad be been appointed, be would not
have been coniputcut to decide a question of such
magnitude as this, which Involved scientific skill
of tne highest order, and a combination of wisdom
and experience which could nut be found In a De
partment tbo bead of which was expected to de
vote bis whole lime to it at a salary of gt!, 000 per
annum. But the Council bod the same right to
create a special Commission for su Important In
vestigation which it had to create s Department,
and, uavlng created it, they have no moral or legal
right to refuse to pay such Commission, any more
than to repudiate the payment of the salaries
of the superintendent of Jiuildlngs sod
bis subordinates. But it Is said this
le a building of the United States Government, built 1
on its Uads.of which Congress has exclusive Juris
diction, and therefore tho City of Chicago had uo
right to interfere with U. It is the right of Chi
cago to protect Its citizens against auuauceia tbo
shape of au unsafe structure, and the city Is as
competent to do this In case of a violation of its
building lave by tbs United Butos Government as
iu suy other case. The Government of the United
blUts could not store gunpowder la great quanti
ties, or ultro-giycertne, on Custom-House Square;
nor could it maintain a uulsance In tho
form of a great building built on
tnnd foundation*. wllh cracked wall*.
It i* plain, therefore, without noting sny other in

CHASE AND HAYES.
A Correspondent Relates n Conversntloa
Between Salmon r, Chnae and Itutherford
1). Hayes Held Twenty-two Years Ago '
lloth tire to Carry Out tho ChcrUheTl
Hopes of Which They Gave Expression in
September. 1833.
Special Comijwmdrnee of The Tribune.
Ci.RVBt.ABn, 0., Dec. 0.— *'I have‘often
thought,” said a prominent gentleman of this
city to your correspondent, “I have often
thought In tho light of events that have tran
spired during tho lost twelve months, of an in
cident which haopened more than twcnty-i* 0
years ago. Tho Incident made a deep t m ,
prcsslon on my mind at. tho time, not on ac
count of tho most Important actor In it, but
because of the entire novelty to me, at that
time, of the expressions employed.”
Your correspondent, knowing that tho gentle,
man had onco been somewhat of o stager, and
had many Interesting recollections of the many
great moo Ohio has pushed to tho front during
tho past thlrly-flvo years, was all attention whllo
ho proceeded In very nearly the following word*
to tell tils story s
“I happened, daring tho month of Scplcm
,bcr, 1855, to bo making a somewhat extended
Journey, much against my wishes and India*,
tlons, In an old-fashioned slago conch over the
hills and through the deep valleys of Southeast,
era Ohio. It was tho Tear In which Salmon P.
Chase made lus first canvass for Governor. Ho
had stepped to tho front many years before a*
an uncompromising opponent of tho great slave
power. In -1837 ho bad appeared before
a Cincinnati court as counsel for Matilda, a
young colored woman who had escaped from
bondage In Kentucky and had been recaptured
ia Ohio. 110 took tho broad ground that Con
gress hod no right to Impose on Slate officers
tho duty of assisting to render up fugitive
slaves nor to legislate on the subject ol all
that tho States had this matter entirely (n their
oWn bands, and by tho Constitution wore solely
responsible for tho performance of that dutr
and had; a right to prescribe such proceeding*
as they sow fit to prevent unlust arrests and
detentions. Notwithstanding tho po rcr with
which those views were presented, they were, of
course, unsuccessful, and Matilda wat recom
mitted to slavery. Many people thought
tho young lawyer had mode a mistake'
In thus advocating tho unpopular sldoof this
great question; but ho followed up thocour*o
ho had morked out, and adopted tho grand
maxim: 'Slavery Is sectional, freedom Is na
tional.* Then camo his great defense of Van
Zandt, who was taken os tho original of Mrs.
Stowe's Van Tromp la ‘Undo Tom’s Cabin.*
Van Zandt had been a Kentucky former, as I
remember it, and had, somo time before, liberat
ed his slaves from n conviction that slavery was
wrong,'and afterwards removed to Ohio, set
tling somewhere near Cincinnati. Soon after
he was Indicted under tho Fugitive Slave law
for barboring slaves who had escaped over (ho
border. Tho case had been carried to thu United
States Sapromo Court and argued by Air.
Chose, assisted. by tho lato Secretary Seward,
oml, of course, became ono of tho historical
cases of the country. In this way Mr. Chase
became quite famous, and In 1849 was elected to
tbo United States Senate by the Democrats and
Frcc-Sollcrs.
“Excuse mo for going Into Ids history so
much, but It Is almost necessary to show tlu.
bearing of tbo Incident I am about to relate.
“Tbo canvass of which I have spoken hat
reached Its height of interest, and Mr. Ohoit
was making a vigorous personal canvass. Tbo
coach had reached Jackson, in Jackson Cdunty,
lathe morning, and had halted for a relay of
horses. Jlst as iho stage was starting again I
was rejoiced to soo Senator Chase, with whom
I had, even then, a slight acquaintance, come In
and tsko a scat. la his company was a young
roan of peculiarly frank appearance, whom,
after shaking bands with mo, ho Introduced ns
‘Mr. Rutherford Hayes, a friend of mine, from
Cincinnati, who Is traveling with mo for a few
weeks In too canvass of tho State.'
** After passing the usual formalities, and re
marking upon the peculiar dltllcultlcs of stage
coach travel, tho favorite subject of slavery o>
positlou was Introduced by senator Chase, und
argued with peculiar warmth. It seemed from
what waa sold that there ;bad boon some pre
vious talk between tho two, and ho simply re
sumed it.
“‘1 tell you, Senator,* said Mr. Unyos, l In mr
opinion tho only bopo for the perpetuity of this
nation lies in reconciling tho suctions. This
everlasting animosity between North and South
will, at length, destroy the wholo country, anil
tho llopublic of North America will be number
ed with those of Romo, Urocco, Switzerland, and
Holland.'
4i ' Rut there never can bo a reconciliation,*
said Senator Chase; Übcro must bo an ever
increasing tight so long os slavery exists In one
section. North and South are radically different
In desires, aspirations, onlnloiu. Slavery must
be killed or kill us. Slavery, which is sectional,
must become national, or freedom, which Is
national, must bocomo sectional. This is the
great contest. Ills now smoldering, but only
Divine Wisdom can tell how soon It may bi
fanned Into an active blaze I *
“ *l agree with all you say,* said Mr. Haves,
but to mo It seems that the only hope Is in the
creation of a public sentiment that shall lusUt
that slavery Is wrong of Itself. It really op
pears that there U an Inevitable contest be
tween tho two Ideas,—between tho North and
tho Bouth. Rut* In my opinion, wo have been
wrongfully educated In many respects In regard
to tho people of the Bouth. X have associated
with Kentuckians more or loss for the past few
years, and must say that I don’t see as they are
much different, with tho exception of their
miserable Ideas In regard to tne enslavement ol
their fellow-men, from the people of Ohio,—
Southern Ohio, at least.*
*Oh, wo agree, then, pretty well,' said Mr.
Chose, • after all. You admit and Insist, just as
strongly as I, that slavery is wrong and tlm
great bane of this country; that, unless It U
rooted out. It will prove the destruction of tho
republican Idea. Tho only difference is, vou
attribute the difficulty to 111-feeling betwecn'tlio
sections, while 1, observing the 111-feeling, sock
tho causeand llndltlnslavcry. 1 tell you slavery
U a relic of the post, which tho slower nations
of Europe have abolished, but which we, stand
ing In the front rank ot progress In every other
respect, still cherish and warm in our breasts.
Rut, 11kg tho serpent which the simple country
man la aGsop placed beneath his frock,
Instead of crushing Us head, slavery
will at length bury Its poisonous
fangs in our-national breast and contaminate
our entire Institutions. Like tho bite of a
poisonous serpent, it must probably be treated
when the deadly fangs aro set In the nation’s
flesh. It.may bo necessary with a quick, skill
ful, savage stroke of tho surgeon's knife to
sever some portion of the pure flesh to save th«
whole body politic. Bat let it bo done; east
tho severed part away, if necessary, with a
brave heart, and thank Ood that the curse hsi
been disposed of with so little sacrUlce.’
" For a moment Mr. Hayes seemed to bo in s
deep study; when be again spoke, it was as lol
lowss * Yea, there van bo no doubt but that the
disposition ol alavery la tho first great ones
tlon to be decided, and 1 shall strive
to do my part In settling It. but when that Is
dona I nope 1 msy be able to do something
towards healing the wound you have describe !
as likely to be made by the great surgeon’/
kulfo or abolition. The wound will need care
ful nursing, I tell you, if the patient ever re
covers.’
" * Well, yoa younger men may hope to do
aomethlug of that tort perhaps, but ao far at
we older ones are concerned*U we are able U
prosecute tho battle. even though wo die at tbe
poet of duty, we shall be content.'
"Tima lue conversation drifted on, and, ao
far aa 1 was concerned, I did nut notice tbe
long amt ledloua Journey balfaomuchaa {ex
pected to. 1 observed with pleasure tho ability
with which all tbe qnealiona or tbe dav were
discussed by the two meu whom I, even then,
Imagined bad bright future* before them, but
little did they or 1 Imagine on that September
day wbat fate bad In store fur them. Both, to
carry out, In a largo degree, tho eberiahed hopes
of which they gave uu outline In the staue*
coach,—one to bo twice Governor of Ohio, Se>
retary of tbe Treasury to the.time of tbe ua
tlou’a greatest ncea and the author qf financial
schemes that proved, perhaps, the panacea for
the healing of the nation, made sure by tbe
wduad of bla favorite abolition, and at length
to die In tbe teat of John Marshall; the other
to be thrice Governor of®Ohlo and honor the
seat of Washington bv carrying out the pious of
that great man for iba prosjxjrity of hia couu*
