TO
Recommends Legislation on
New and Important
Subjects.

He Believes Such Laws Would Curb

gerous Proportions.
HI Views on Negro Question Asks
for Currency Reform, and Shipping
i BUI Would Make Citizens of Japs
Many Other Important Subjects
Discussed.
Washington, Dec. 3. President Roose
velt's messages to tho second session of
the Fifty-ninth congress deals with a
number of new nnd Important subjects,
chief of which Is the government prose
cution of tho trusts, thn abuse of Injunc
tions In labor troubles, tho negro ques
tion, tho preaching of class hatred
between capital and labor, additional legis
lation for tho control of largo corpora
tions, a federal Inheritance and Incomo
tax law nnd currency reform.
Tho messago opens with a statement
of what tho last congress left unllnlshed,
and of this ho says:
"I again recommend a law prohibiting
nil corporations from contributing to the
campaign expenses of any party. Such
a bill has already past ono house of con
cress. I.ct Individuals contribute as they
desire: but lot us prohibit In cITecttvo
fashion all corporations from making
contributions for any political purpose,
directly or Indirectly.
"Another bill which has Just past ono
house of tho congress and which is ur
gently necessary should bo enacted Into
law Is that conferring upon the go em
inent the right of appeal In criminal
cases on questions of law. This right
exfcts In many of the states; It exists In
the District of Columbia by act of the
congress. It Is of courso not proposed
that In any enso a verdict for tho de
fendant on the merits should be set
'aside. Recently In one district where
tho government had Indicted certain per
sons for conspiracy In connection with
rebates, the court sustained tho defend
ant's demurrer; whllo In another Juris
diction nn Indictment for conspiracy to
obtain rebates has been sustained by
the court, convictions obtained under It,
and two defendants sentenced to Impris
onment. The two cases referred to may
not be In real conflict with each other,
but It Is unfortunate that there should
even bo an apparent conflict. At pres
ent there Is no way by which the 'gov
ernment can cause such a conflict, when
it occurs, to bo solved by nn appeal to
n higher court; and tho wheels of Justice
aro blocked without nny real decision of
tho question. I can not too Btrongly
urge tho passage of the bill In question.
A failure, to pass will result In seriously
hampering tho government In Its effort
to obtain Justice, especially against
wealthy Individuals or corporations who
do wrong; nnd may also prevent the
got eminent from obtaining Justtco for
wngeworkers who are not themselves
able effectively to contest a casa where
the Judgment of nn Inferior court has
been ngalnst them. 1 have specifically
In vlow a recent decision by a district
Judge leaving railway employees with
out remedy fur violation of a certain so
called labor statute. It seems an absurd
ity to permit a slnglo district Judge,
against what may be the Judgment of
the Immense majority of his colleagues
on the bench, to declare a law bolemnly
enacted by the congress to be "uncon
stitutional," und then to deny to tho
government tho right to have tho su
premo court definitely decide the ques
tion." Evasion by Technicalities.
"In connection with this matter, I would
like to call attention to the very unsat
isfactory state of our criminal law, re
sulting In large part from tho hab't of
setting aside the Judgments of Inferior
courts on technicalities absolutely un
connected with tho merits of tho case,
and where there Is no attempt to show
that there has been any failure of sub
stantial Justice. It would bo well to en
act a law providing something to the
effect that:
"No Judgment shall bo sot aside or now
trial granted In any cause, civil or crim
inal, on the ground of misdirection of the
Jury or tho improper admission or re
jection of ovldence, or for error ns to any
matter of pleading or procedure unices,
in tho opinion of the court to which the
application Is made, after nn examina
tion of tho entire cause, Jt shall affirma
tively appear that the error complained
or has resulted la a miscarriage of
Justice "
InjuRstlcns.
On ths subject of tho abolition of In
junctions In labor disputes, ho says:
"In my last message I suggested the en
actment of a law w connection with tho
Issuance, of Injunctions, attention hav
ing been sharply drawn to tho matter
by tho demand that tho right of apply
ing Injunctions In labor cases should be
wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful
whether a law abolishing altogether tho
use of Injunctions In such cases would
stand the tost of tho courts; In which
caso of courso tho legislation would bo
Ineffective. Moreovor, I bellevo It would
bo wrong altogether to prohibit tho use
of Injunctions. It Is criminal to permit
er'npathy with criminals to weaken pur
hands In upholding the law; und If men
seek to destroy life or property by mob
violence there should bo no Impairment
of tho powor of tho courts to deal with
them In tho most summary and effective
way possible. But so 'far as poBslblo tie
abuse of tho power should bo provided
ngalnst by some such law as 1 advocated
last year.
"In this matter ot Injunctions thero Is
lodged In tho hands ot tho Judiciary a
necessary powor which Is nevertheless
subject to tho possibility of grave abuBO.
It Is a power that should be excrcisod
with cxtrcmo care and should bo sub
ject to tho Jealous scrutiny of all men,
und condemnation should bo meted out
as much to tho Judge who falls to uso
It boldly when necessary as to tho Judge
who uses It wantonly or oppressively.
Of course, ft Judge strong onough to bo
fit for his office will enjoin any resort
to violence or Intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what his opinion
may be of the rights of the original quar
rel. There mustj bo no hesitation In
dealing with disorder. But thero must
likewise be no such nbuoo of tho In
junctive powor as Is Implied In forbidding
laboring men to Btrlvo for their own bet
terment In peaceful and lawful ways;
nor must tho Injunction bo usod merely
to nld some big corporation In carrying
out schemos for its own aggrandizement.
It must bo rememborod that a prelim
inary Injunction In a labor caso, If
granted without adequato proof (even
when authority can be found to support
tho conclusions ot law on which It Is
founded), may often sottle the dispute
botweon tho parties; und therefore If
Improperly granted may do Irreparable
wrong. Yet thorp nro many Judges who
assumo a tnatter-of-faot course granting
ot a preliminary Injunction to bo tho
ordinary and proper Judicial disposition
of such ensos; and there have updoubt
rtlv liipn Hnirrant wronTH committed
by Judges jn connection .with labor dls- i
pules oven wuiiiu uiw iuoi iuw yeura,
ttltho I think much less often than In
former years, bucii juuges oy tneir un

LIMNERS
to do away with tho powor of Injunction;
and theroforo BUch careless uso of tho
lnjunctlvo process tends to threaten Its
very existence, for If tho American pco
plo over becomo convinced that this
process Is habitually nbused, whothcr In
matters nffcctlnir labor or In matters nf-
footing corporations. It will bo woll-nlgh
Mmpojslblo to provont Its abolition."
Tho Negro Problem.
Tho negro problem Is given considera
ble nttontlon, nftor calling attention to
tho fact that no section of tho country
Is free from faults, and that no section
lins occnRlon to Jeer at tho shortcomings
of nny other section, ho turns to tho sub
ject of lvnchingH, nnd especially ns np
nllcd to tho negro ot tho south. Ho says
.ho greatest existing cauao for mob law
Is tho perpetration by tho blacks of the
crlmo of rape, n crime which ho terms
oven worso than murder. He quotes tho
admonitions to tho whlto peoplo spoken
by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, somo years
ngo, and by Gov, Jolks, of Alabama, re
cently, nnd then snys:
"Every colored mnn should realize
that tho worst enemy of his rnco Is tho
negro criminal, nnd above all tho ne
gro criminal who commits tho drend
ful crime of rape; and It should bo folt
nH In tho highest degree an offenso
ngalnst tho wholo country, nnd against
tho colored race In particular, for a
colored man to fnll to help tho otllccrn
of thn law In hunting down with all
pocsible earnestness and zeal overy
such infamous offender. Moreover, In
my judgment, tho crlmo of rape should
always bo punished with death, as Is
tho case with murder; assault with In
tent to commit rapo should bo mado a
capital crime, at least In the discretion
of tho court; and provision should be
mndo"by Which the punishment may
follow Immediately upon tho heels of
tho offenso; whllo tho trial should bo
so conducted that the victim noed not
be wantonly shamed while giving" tes
timony, and that tho 'least possible
publicity shall bo given to tho dotalls.
Tho members of the whlto race on
tho other hand should understand that
every lynching- represents by Just so
much a loosening' of the bands of civ
ilization: that tho spirit of lynching
Inevitably throws Into promlnenco In
tho community all tho foul nnd evil
creatures who dwell therein. No man
can take part in tho torturo of a hu
man being without having his own
moral nature permanently lowered.
Every lynching means Just so much
moral deterioration In all tho children
who have any knowledge ot it. and
therefore Just so much nddltional
trouble for tho next generation of
Americans.
"Lot Justice bo both sure and swift;
but let It bo Justice under tho law,
and not the wild and crooked savagery
of a mob. ,
Need for Negro Education.
"Thero Is another matter which has
a direct hearing1 upon this matter of
lynchlntr and ot the brutal crlmo which
sometimes calls It forth and at other
times merely furnishes the excuso for
Its existence: It Is out of tho question
for our peoplo as a wholo permanently
to rise by treading down any ot their
own number. Even those who them
selves for tho moment profit by such
maltreatment of their fellows will in
tho long run also suffer. No more
shortsighted policy can bo Imagined
than. In the fancied Interest of one
class, to prevent tho education of an
other class. The free public school, tho
chance for each boy or girl to get a
good elementnry- education, lies nt the
foundation of our whole political situ
ation. In every community the poor
est citizens, thoso who noed the schools
most, v ould bo deprived of them If
they only received school facilities
proportionately to tho taxes they paid.
This is as truo of one portion of our
country as of anothor. It Is a3 truo
for tho negro ns for tho white man.
The whlto man. If ho Is wtso. will de
cline to allow the negroes in a mass to
grow to manhood and womanhood
without education. Unquestionably ed
ucation such as Is obtained in our pub
lic schools does not do everything to
wards making a man a Rood citizen;
but it docs much. Tho lowest and most
brutal criminals, those for Instance
who commit the crime of rape, aro In
tho great majority men who have had
either no education or very Htle; Just
as they are almost Invariably men who
own no property; for tho man who
puts money by out of, his earnings,
like tho man who acquires education.
Is usually lifted above mero brutal
criminality. Of courso the best type
of education for tho colored man. ta
ken ns u whole. Is such education as
Is conferred In schools like Hampton
and Tuskegce; whero tho boys and
girls, the young men and young- wo
men, are trained industrially as well
ns in tho ordinary public school
branches. Tho graduates of these
schools turn out well In tho great ma
jority of cases, nnd hardly any of them
bocomo criminals, while what little
criminality thero Is never takes the
form of that brutal vlolenco which In
vites lynoh law. Every graduate of
theso schools una ror the matter of
that every oher colored man or wo
man who leads a life so useful and
honorable as to win the good will and
respect of thoso whites whoso neigh
bor ho or she Is. thereby helps the
whole colored race as It can bo helped
In no other way; for next to the negro
himself, the man who can do most to
help tho negro 13 his whlto neighbor
who lives near him; and our steady
effort should be to better tho relations
between the two. Great tho the bene
fit of these schools has 'been to their
colored pupils nnd to the colored peo
ple, it may well be questioned whether
tho benefit has not been at least as
great to tho whlto people union; whom
theso colored pupils live after they
graduate."
Capital and Labor.
On the subject of capital and labor
the president takes tho agitators of class
hatred to task and says "to preach
hatred to the rich man. as such. . . .
to seek to mislead and Inflame to mad
ness honest mon whoso lives are hard
and whohavo not the kind of mental
training which will permit them to ap
preciate tho danger in the doctrines
preached Is to commit a crime against
tho body politic and to be false to overy
worthy prlnclplo and tradition of Amer
ican national life." Continuing on this
subject he says:
"The plain peoplo who think the
mechanics, farmers, merchants, work
ers with head or hand, tho men to
whom American traditions aro dear,
who love their country and .try to'act
decently by their neighbors, owo It to
themselves to remember that the noat
damaging blow that enn be given pop
ular government Is to olect an un
worthy and sinister agitator on a
platform of violence and hypocrisy,
whenever such nn Issue Is raised In
this country nothing can be Rained by
flinching from It, for In such case dem
ocracy Is Itself on trial, popular self
government .under republican forms Is
itself on trial. The triumph ot tho
mob Is Just as evil a thing na the tri
umph of the plutocracy, and to have
escaped one danger avails nothing
whatever If wo sucuumb to the other.
In tho ond tho honest man.whether rich
or poor, who earns his own living and
tries to deal justly by his fellows, has
as much to four from tho Insincere
and unworthv demagog, promising
much and performing nothing, or else
performing nothing but ovll, who
would sot on tho mob to plunder tho
rich, ns from tho crafty corrupUonlst.
who, for his own ends, would permit
the common peoplo to bp oxplo'ted by
tho very wealthy. If we over let this
government fnll Into the hands of men
of cither ft theso two classes, wo shall
Bhow ourselves false to America's past,
Moreover, tho demagog and corrup
tlonlst often work hand In hand. Tharo
nro at tills moment wealthy reaction
aries of such obtuse morality that they
regard tho public servant who prose
cutes them when thoy vlolato tho law,
or who seeks to makn them bear their
proper aharo of tho public burdens, as
being oven ranrn objectionable than
tho violent ngltitnr who hounds on
tho mob to plunder tho rich. Thero Is
nothing to choose betwern such a re
actionary nnd such nn ngltntor: fundn
imentally they nro alike In their selfish
disregard of tho rights of others: 'and
It Is natural that tjioy should Join In
opposition to nny movement of which
tho aim Ih fearl'sly to do exact and
oven Justlcekto nil,"
Railroad Employees' Houro.
Ho asks for tho rasjlns of the bill lim
iting the number of hours of
employment of railroad emplores. ond
Classen inn nionruro ng n very imnieraiu
one. Ho says tho nlm of nil shnuU ls
' to. ntnadllv radur.a tho uurabor of Iioun
of labor, with as a goal the general In
troduction of nn eight-hour day, but In
sists that on tho Isthmus of Panama tho
conditions nro so different from what
thoy aro horo that tho Introduction of nn
eight-hour day on tho cnnnl would bo
absurd, and continues, "Just about ns ab
surd ns It Is, so far as tho Isthmus Is
concerned, whero whlto labor cannot bo
employed, to bother ns to whether tho
work Is done by alien black men or alien
yellow men."
Investigation .of Disputes.
Ho urges the enactment or n drastic
child labor law for tho District of Co
lumbia and tho territories, and a federal
Investigation of tho subject of child nnd
female, labor throughout tho country.
Ho reviews tho work of the commission
nppolnted to Investigate labor conditions
In tho coal fields of Pennsylvania In 1902,
nnd refers to tho wish of tho commission
"Hint tho state nnd federal governments
should provldo tho machinery for what
mny bo called tho compulsory Investiga
tion of controversies between employers
and employes when they nrlse." After
referring to tho fact that a bill has nl
ready been Introduced to this ond ho
says:
"Many of these strikes and lockouts
would not have occurrod had tho parties
to tho dispute boon required to appear
beforo nn unprejudiced body representing
tho nation and, faco to face, Btato the
reasons for their contention. In most
Instances the dlnputo would doubtless bo
found to be duo to a misunderstanding
by each of tho other's Hunts, aggravated
by an -unwillingness of either party to ac
cept nB true the statemonts of the other
as to tho justlca or Injustice of the mat
ters In dispute. Tha exercise of a ju
dicial spirit by a disinterested body
representing tho federal government,
such us would be provided by a commls-v
slon on conciliation and arbitration
would tond to croato an atmosphere of
frlAnriltnnRa nnd pnnplltntlnn hfltween con
tending partlos; and the giving each side
an equal opportunity to present iuuy us
caso in the presence of tho other would
prevent many disputes from developing
into serious strikes or lockouts, and In
other cases, would cnnblo the commis
sion to persuade the opposing parties to
como to terms.
"In this age of great corporate and la
bor combinations, neither employers nor
employees should be loft completely nt
the mercy of tho stronger party to a dis
pute, regardless of tho righteousness of
tholr respective claims. Tho proposed
measuro would bo Invthe line of securing
recognition of tho fact that In many
strikes tho public has Itself an lntorcst
which cannot wisely bo disregarded; an
Interest not merely of general conven
ience, for tho question of a Just and
proper public policy must also be con
sidered. In all legislation of this kind
It Is well to advance cautiously, testing
each stop by tho actual results; the step
proposed can suroly bo safely taken, for
tho decisions of tho commission would
not bind the parties in legal fashion, and
yet would give a chance for public opin
ion to oxcrt Its full force for tho right."
Control of Corporations.
A con3ldcrab1o portion of tho message
Is devoted to tho subject of federal con
trol of corporations In what he refers to
tho passage at' tho last session of tho
rate, meat Inspection and food laws, and
says that all of these havo already Justi
fied their enactment, but recommends
the amendment of tho meat Inspection
law so as to put dates on the labels of
meat products, and also to placo tho
C03t of Inspection on the pickers rather
than on the government. Continuing on
thio subject of tho control of corporations
by the federal government he says:
"It cannot too often be repeated that ex
perience has conclusively shown the im
possibility of securing by the actions of
nearly half a hundred different state
legislatures anything but Ineffective
chaos In the way of dealing with tho
great corporations which do not operate
exclusively within the limits of any one
state. In some method, whether by a
national license law or in other fashion,
wo must exercise, and that at an early
date, a far more complete control than
at present over these great corpora
tions a control that will among other
things prevent the evils of excessive
overcapitalization, and that will compel
the disclosures by each big corporation
ot Its stockholders and of lt3 properties
and business, whether owned directly or
thru subsidiary or airillated corporations.
This will tend to put a stop to tho secur
ing of inordinate 'profits by favored
Individuals at the expense whether of
tho general public, the stockholders, or
tho wogeworkers. Our effort should be
not so much to prevent consolidation as
such, but so to supervise and control It
as to see that It results In no harm to
tho people. The reactionary or ultracon
servntlve apoloslstB for the mlsuso of
wenlth assail the effort to secure such
control as a step toward socialism. As a
matter of fact It Is there reactionaries
and ultraconservatlves who are them
selves most potent In Increasing socialis
tic feeling. Ono of the most efficient
methods ot averting the consequences of
a dangerous agitation, which is SO per
cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent.
of evil as to wmen mo agnation m wuu
fminrfKii Th i.hk; wnv to avert the very
undesirable move for the governmental
ownership of railways Is to secure by
the government on behalf of the peoplo
as a wholo such adequate control and
regulation ot tho great interstate com
mon carriers as will do away with the
evils which give rise to the agitation
against them. So the proper antidote
to tho dangerous and wicked agitation
against tho men of wealth as such is to
secure by proper Ioslslatlon and execu
tive action the nbolltlon of tho gravo
abuses which actually do obtain In con
nection with the business use of wealth
under our present system or rather no
system of falluro to exercise any ade
quato control at all. Bomo persons speak
as If tho exercise of such governmental
cdntrol would do away with tho freedom
of Individual Initiative and dwarf indi
vidual effort. This is not a fact. It
would be a veritable calamity to fail to
put a premium upon individual Initiative,
Individual capacity and effort; upon the
energy, character and foresight which
It In so important to encourage in tho
'individual. But as a matter of fact tho
deadening and degrading effect of puro
socialism, and especially of Its extrome
form communism, nnd the destruction or
Individual character which they would
bring about, are In part achieved by the
wholly unregulated competition which
results in a single Individual or corpor
ation rising at tho exponse of all others

, tors to a position of utter Inferiority and
suDoraination. ... . , ,
"In enacting and enforcing such log s
lation as this congress already ha3 to Its
credit, we are working on a coherent
plan, with tho Bteady endoavor to secure
the needed reform by tho Joint action of
tho moderate men, the plain men who
do not wish anything hysterical or
dangerous, but who do Intend to deal
In resoluto commonsenso fashion with
the real and great evils of the prosent
system. The reactionaries and the vio
lent extremists show symptoms of Join
ing hands against us. Both assert, for
Instance, that If logical, we should go
to government ownership ot railroads
and the like; tho reactionaries, because
on such nn issue they think the people
would stand with them, while tho ex
tremists care rather to preach discontent
and agitation than to achieve solid re
sults. As a matter of fact, our position
Is ns remote from that of tho bourbon
reactionary as from that of tho imprac
ticable or sinister visionary. W e hold
that tho government should not conduct
the business of tho nation, but that It
should exercise such supervision us will
Insure Its being conducted In tho Inter
est of the nation. Our aim Is, so far as
may be. to secure, for all decent, hard
working men, equality of opportunity and
equality et burdon.
Combinations Aro Necessary.
"The Kctual working of our laws has
shown that tho effort to piohlblt ull com
bination, good or bad, Is noxious whero
It Is not Ineffective. Combination ot
capital llko combination of labor Is u
necessary element of our present Indus
trial system. It Is not possible complotoly
to prevent It; and If It were posslblo,
such complete prevention would do dam
age to tho body politic. What we netd
Is not vnlnly to provent all combination,
but to secure such rigorous nnd adequato
control and supervision of tho combina
tions us to pi event their Injuring tho
public, or tixlatlns In such form ns Inev
itably to threaten Injury-for tho mero
fact that iv combination has secured
I ructlcally cotip!o(e control of a nocos
sary of life would under nny circum
stances show that such combination was
to be presumed to bo ndverso to tho pub
lic Inten'bt. It ts unfortunate that our
present laws should forbid nil combina
tions. Instead ot sharply discriminating
between thoo cointV.titt'o m wh'cli do
rvll, Rebnloi', for Irstirre, (tro us o'ton
due to tho Fte.s-ru ot bis U!i'p..-a Us
was shown In tho Investigation of tho
Standard Oil company nnd ns has been
shown since by tho Investigation of tho
tobacco and sugar trusts) as to tho Initi
ative of big railroads. Often rnllroads
would llko to comblno for tho purpose ot
nrevontlnc- n ble shlnpcr from maintain
ing improper advantages nt the expense
ot small snippers nun oi uio generiu puu
llc. Such a combination. Instead of being
forbidden by law, should bo favored. In
other words, It should bo permitted to
rnllroads to make agreements, provided
theso ngrcoments wero sanctioned by the
Intcrstato commerce commission and i
wero published. With theso two condi
tions COmpiieU Willi ll IS wiiiosbiuiu m
seo whnt harm such a combination could
do to the public at largo. It Is n public
evil to havo on tho statute bookH a law
Incapable of full enforcement becnuso
both judges and Juries realize that Its
full enforcement would destroy the busi
ness 'of tho country, for tho rosult Is to
mnko decent railroad men violators of
tho law against their will, nnd to put a
premium on tho behavior of the wilful
wrongdoers. Such a result In turn tends
to throw tho decent man arid tho wilful
wrongdoer Into cIobo association, and In
the end to drag down the foritver to tho
latter's level: for tho man who bocomos
a lawbreaker In ono -way unhappily tends
to lose nil respect for law and to bo
willing to break It In many ways. No
moro scathing condemnation could bo
visited upon a law than Is contained In
tho words of tho Interstate commerce
commission when, In commenting upon
tho fact that tho numerous Joint traffic
associations do technically violate tho
law, they say: "The decision of the
United States suprome court In the
Transmlsslsslppt caso nnd tha Joint
Traffic association case has produced no
nmpMpal ftffopt nnnn thn rnllwav nnnrn-
'tlons ot the country. Such associations.
In fact, exist now as uioy aia oerore
these decisions, and with tho samo gen
eral effect. In justice to all parties, we
ought probably to add that It Is difficult
to see how our Interstate railways could
bo operated with duo regard to the Inter
est of the shipper and the railway
without conccrted'nctlon of the kind af
forded thru these associations."
This means that tho law as construed
by tho supremo court Is such that the
business of the country cannot bo con
ducted without breaking It., I recommend
that you give careful and early consider
ation to thlB subject, and If you find the
opinion of the Interstate commerce com
mission Justified, that you amend tho
law so as to obviate the evil disclosed.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
It was expected that the president
would refer In some way to his belief
m tno necessity for the cnrDing ot enor
mous fortunes, and he has done so by
recommending legislation for both In
como nnd an Inheritance tax. He be
lieves the government should Imposo a
graduated Inheritance tax, and. If possl
blo, a graduated Income tax. He Bays:
I am well aware tnat sucn a sudjoci
as this needs long and careful study In
order that the peoplo may become famil
iar with what Is proposed to bo done,
may clearly see tho necessity ot proceed
ing with wisdom and self-rostralnt, and
may mako up their minds Just how far
they nro willing to go In tho matter;
whllo onlv trained legislators can work
.out the project In necessary detail. But
i tool tnat in mo near iuiure our naiiun
al legislators should enact a law provid
ing Tor a graduated Inheritance tax by
which a steadily Increasing rate of duty
should bo put upon all moneys or other
valuables coming by gift, bequest, or
devise to any Individual or corporation.
It may bo well to mako the tax heavy
In proportion as tho Individual benefited
is remote of kin. In any ovent. In my
Judgment tho pro rata of the tax should
Increase very heavily with the lncreaso
of tho amount left to any one individual
after a certain point has been reached.
It Is most desirable to encourage thrift
and ambition, and a potent source of
thrift and ambition is the deslro on the
part of the breadwinner to leave his chil
dren well off. This object can be attained
by making tho tax very small on moder
ate amounts ot property left; because
tho prime object should bo to put a con
stantly Increasing burdon on the Inher
itance of those swollen fortunes which
It Is certainly of no benefit to this coun
try to perpetuate.
There can be no question of the eth
ical propriety of the government thus de
termining the conditions upon which any
gift or inheritance should be received.
Exactly lu v far the inheritance tax
would, as an Incident, have tho effect of
limiting tho transmission by devlso or
gift of the enormous fortunes In question
It is not necessary at present to discuss.
It Is wise that progress in this dlroctlon
should be gradual. At first a permanent
riatlonal inheritance tax, while it might
bo moro substantial than any such tax
has hitherto been, need not approximate,
either In amount or in the extent of tho
Increase by graduation, to what such a
tax should ultimately be.
Inheritance Tax Constitutional.
"This species of tax has again and again
been Imposed, altho only temporarily, by
the national government. It was first
Imposed by the act of July 6, 1797, when
the makers of tho Constitution were
alive and nt the head of affairs. It was
a graduated tax; tho small In amount,
the rate was Increased with the amount
left "to any Individual, exceptions being
mado in tho case of certnln close kin. A
similar tax was again imposed by tho
act of July 1, 1SC2; a minimum sum of
11,000 in personal property being excepted
from taxation, tho tax then becoming
progressive according to the remoteness
of kin. The war-rovenuo act of June 13,
1SS8, provided for an Inheritance tax on
any sum exceeding tho value of $10,000,
the rate of tax Increasing both In accord
ance with tho amounts left and In ac
cordance with the legatee's remoteness
ot kin. Tho supreme court has hold that
the succession tax Imposed at the time
of the civil war was not a direct tax but
an Impose of excise which was both con
stitutional and valid. More recently the
court. In an opinion delivered by Mr.
Justice White, which contained an ex
ceedingly able and elaborate discussion
of the powers of the congress to Imposo
death duties, sustained the constitution
ality ot the Inheritance tax feature ot tho
war-revenue act ot 1S38.
Is Income Tax Constitutional?
"In Its Incidents, and apart from the
main purpose of raising revonue, an
incomo tax stands on an entirely differ
ent footing from an Inheritance tax, be
cause it Involves no question of the per
petuation of fortunes swollen to an un
healthy size. Tho question is in its
ossenco a question of the proper adjust
ment of burdens to benefits. As the
law now stands it Is undoubtedly, diffi
cult to Covlso a national Incomo tax
which shall be constitutional. But
whother It Is absolutely Impossible Is an
other question; and if posslblo It Is most
certainly desirable. The first purely In
como tax law was past by tho congress
In 1S81. but tho most important law deal
ing with the subject was that of 1SDI.
Tills the court held to be unconstitu
tional. .....
"The question is unaouoteniy very in
tricate. del!cu and troublesome. The
decision of the court was only reached
by one majority. It Is the law of tho
land, nnd, of courso. Is excepted os such
and loyally obeyed by all good citizens.
Nevertheless, tho hesitation evidently
felt by the court an n whole In coming
to a conclusion, whon considered to
gether with the previous decisions on
the subject, may perhaps Indicate the
possibility of devlslnu a constitutional
Income-tax law which shall substan
tially ncccomplish the results aimed
at. The difficulty of amending tho con
stitution Is so great that only real ne
cessity can justify a resort thereto.
lSvory ffort should be made In dealing
with this subject, ns with tho subject
of tho proper control by the national
govornnitnt over the uso of corporate
wealth In Interstate business, to devlso
legislation which without Biich action
shall ntttln the desired ond; but If this
falls, thero will ultimately bo no al
ternative to a constitutional amend
ment." ......
He makes a strong pica for technical
and Industrial education for tho masses,

relationship between tho theory of edu
cation nnd tho facts of life. In nil
education wo should widen our alms. It
Is a good thing to produce a certain num
ber of trnlnod scholars and students;
but tho education superintended by tho
stato must seek rather to produco a hun
dred good citizens than merely ono
scholar, nnd It must bo turned now and
then from tho clasp Uook to tho study
of tho great book ot nature Itself. This
Is especially truo of tho farmer, as has
been pointed out again and ngaln by nil
observers most competent to pass prnc-
tlcal Judgment on tho problems of our
country life. All students now realize
that education must seek to train tho
executive powers of young peoplo nnd to
confer mnro real significance upon tho
phrase "dignity of labor," nnd to pre
pare tho pupils so that In addition to
each developing In tho highest degrco
his Individual capacity for work, thoy
may together help crento a right public
opinion, nnd show In many ways social
and cooperative spirit. Organization has
becomo necessary in tne business worm;
nnd it has accomplished much for good
In the world of labor. It Is no loss neces
sary for farmers. Such a movemont ns
tho grunge movement Is good In Itself
and Is capable of a well-nigh Inflnlto fur
ther extension for good bo long as It Is
kept to Its own legitimate business. Tha
benefits to bo derived by the association
of farmers for mutual ndvnntnge nro
partly economic and partly sociological.
"Moreover, whllo In the long run volun
tary effort will provo moro efficacious
than government assistance, whllo tho
farmers must primarily do most for
themselves, yet tho government con also
do much. Tho department of agriculture
has broken new ground in many direc
tions, nnd year by year It finds how It
can Improve Its methods and develop
fresh usefulness. Its constant effort Is
to give tho governmental assistance In
tho most effectlvo way; that Is. thru as
sociations of farmers rather than to or
thru Individual farmers. It Is also striv
ing to coordinate Its work with tho agri
cultural departments of tho several
states, and so far ns Its own work Is
educational, to coordinate It with tho
work of other educational authorities.
Agricultural education Is necessarily
based upon general education, but our
agricultural educational Institutions are
wisely Bpeclallzlng themselves, making
their courso relate to the actual teaching
pf tho agricultural and kindred sciences
to young country peoplo or young city
nennlo who wish to live in the countrv.
"Great progress has already been mado
among farmers by tho creation of
farmers' Institutes, of dnlry associa
tions, of breeders' associations, horti
cultural nssoclntlons, and tho like. A
striking example of how tho govern
ment nnd the farmers can cooperate Is
shown In connection with the menace
offered to the cotton growers of tho
southern states by tho advance of tho
boll weevil. Tho department Is doing
all It can to orsranlzo the farmers In
tho threatened districts. Just as It has
been doing all It can to orgnnlze them
In aid of Its work to eradicate the cat
tle fever tick in tho south. Tho depart
ment can and will cooperate with nil
such associations, and It must havo
their help If Its own work Is to bo
done In the most efllclent style."
Ho urges the extension of the Irriga
tion and forest preservation system, nnd
asks for an appropriation for building a
memorial theater at Arlington.
Marriage and Divorce.
As a means of bringing about national
regulation of marriage and divorce he
suggests a constitutional amendment, and
says It Is not safe to leave these ques
tions to be dealt with by the various
states. Continuing on this subject he
says:
When home tics are loosened; when
men and women cease to regard a
worthy family life, with all its duties
fully performed, and all its responsi
bilities lived up to, as tho Ufa best
worth living: then evil days for the
commonwealth are at hand. Thero are
regions In our land, and classes of our
population, where tho birth rate has
sunk below the death rate. Surely It
should need no demonstration to show
that wilful sterility Is, from the
standpoint of tho nation, from mo
standpoint of the human race, the ono
sin for which tho penalty Is national
death, race death; a sin for which
there Is no atonement; a sin which Is
tho moro dreadful exactly In propor
tion as tho men and women guilty
thereof are In other respects. In char
acter, and bodily and mental powers,
thoso whom for tho sake of the state
It would bo well to see tho fathers
and mothers of many healthy children,
well brought up in homes made happy
by their presence. No man, no woman,
can shirk the primary duties of life,
whether for love of ease nntl pleasure,
or for any other cause, and retain his
or her self-respect.
Tho president asks for the enactment
into law of a shipping bill that will place
American Interests on the Beas on a par
with thoso of other countries, and urges
esDecially that something be done that
will establish direct steamship commu
nication with South American ports.
Currency Reform.
Amendments to the present currency
laws nro asked for, and after showing
that present laws aro Inadequate becnuso
of the wide fluctuation of Interest
charges, he says:
"The mere statement of these facts
shows that our present system Is seri
ously defective. Thero Is need of a
change. Unfortunately, however, many
of the proposed changes must bo ruled
from consideration because thoy are
cnmnllcatcd. are not easy of comnre-
henslon, and tend to dlRturb existing
rights nnd Interests. Wo must also
rule out nny plan which would ma
terially impair the value of the United
States two percent, bonds now pledged
to secure circulation, tho Issue of
which was made under conditions pe
culiarly creditable to the treasury. I
do not press nny special plan. Various
plans havo recently been proposed by
expert committees ot bankers. Anions
the plans which are possibly feasible
and which certainly should receive
your consideration Is that repeatedly
brought to your attention by the pres
ent secrotnry of tho treasury, tho es
sential features of which havo been
approved by many prominent bankers
nnd buslnrss men. According to this
plan national banks should be per
mitted to Issue a specified proportion
of their capital In notes of a given
kind, tho Issuo to bo taxed nt so high
a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted In legitimate trade. This
plnn would not permit tho Issue of
currency to give banks additional
profits, but to meet the emergency pre
sented by times of stringency.
Need of Automatic System.
"I dp not say that this Is tho right
system. I only advance It to empha
size my belief that thero Is need for
tho adoption of somo system which
shall bo automatic and open to all
sound banks, so as to avoid ull pos
sibility of discrimination nnd favorit
ism. Such a plan would tend to pre
vent the spasms of high money and
speculation which now obtain In the
New York market; for at present
there la too much currency at certain
seasons of the year, and Its accumu
lation at Now Vork tempts bankers
to lend It nt low rates for speculative
purposes; whereas at other times whon
tho crops nio btng moved there Is
urgent need for a large but temporary
lncreaso In tho currency Bupply. It
must never be forgotten that this
question concerns business mon gen
erally quite ns much as bankeri; es
pecially Is this true of stockmen,
farmers and business men In tho west:
for at present at certain seasons of
the year tho difference In Interest
rates between tho east nnd tho west Is
from six to ten per cent., wherens In
Canada the corresponding dltforenco Is
but two per cent. Any plan must, of
course, guard tho Interests of west
ern and southern bankers ns carefully
as It guards the Interests of Now York
or Chicago bankers; nnd must bo
drawn from tho stnndpolnts of tho
fnrmcr and the merchant no 1cub than
from tho standpoints of tho city
banker nnd the country binker.
The low should be nmended ro as to
rpeclflrally to provide that tho funds do
rivo'l from customs duties may bn treat
ed by tho secretary of tho treasury as
ho treats funds obtained under the In
ternal iwcnuo laws. Thero should be
a consldorab'o Increase In bills of small
denominations. Permission should bo
given banks, if necessary under settled
restrictions, to retlro their circulation to
a larger amount than 53,000.CCO a month."

Naturalization of Japs.
President Roosevelt scores San Fran
cisco and other Paclflo coast cities for
tholr treatment of tho Japanese, and
makes tho following recommendations:
Our nation fronts on tho Pacific, Just
ns It fronts on tho Atlnntlc. Wo hopo
to piny n constantly growing part In
tho groat ocean of tho orient. Wo
wish, ns wo ought to wish, for a great
commercial development in our deal
ings with Asia; and It ts out of tha
question that wo should permanently
have such development unless wo free
ly and glndly extend to other nations
tho snmo measure of Justice and good
treatment which wo expect to recclvo
In roturn. It Is only a very small body
of our citizens that net badly. Whero
the federal government has power It
will denl summarily with any such.
Where the several states have power
I enrnostly ask that they also dcnli
wisely and promptly with such con
duct, or else this small body of wrong
doers may bring shame upon tho great
mass of their Innocent nnd right
thinking fellows that Is, upon our
nation an a whole. Good manners
should be nn International no less thani
an individual attribute. I ask fair,
treatment for tho Japanese as I would!
nsk fair treatment for Germans orl
Englishmen, Frenchmen, Russians otJ
Italians. I nsk It as due to humanity!
nnd civilization. I ask It os duo to
ourselves becnuso we must act up
rightly toward all mon.
"I recommond to tho congress that,
an act be paBsed specifically provdlng for
tho naturalization of Japancso who como
here Intending to become American clti
Izens. Ono ot the great embarrassments
attending the performance of our In
ternational obligations Is the fact that
tho statutes of tho United Stntcs gov-!
ernment nro entirely lnndequate. They
fall to give to the national government!
sufficiently ample power, through United
States courts nnd by tho use ot tho
nrmy and navy, to protect aliens In thoi
rights secured to them under solemn.'
treaties which aro tho law of tho land.
I therefore earnestly recommend that
the criminal nnd civil statutes of tho
United States bo bo amended nnd nd-loil
t an to enable tha president, acting for
the United States government, which Is
responsible In our International rela
tions, to enforce tho rights of aliens un-
der treaties. Even ns tho law now 1
something can be done by tho federal
government toward this endi and In tho
matter now beforo mo nffectlng tho Jap
anese, ovorythlng that It la (n my power
to do will be done, nnd nil of tho forces,
military and civil, of tho United States,
which I may lawfully employ will bo
so employed. Thero should, however, be
no particle of doubt us to the power of
tho national government completely to
perform and enforce Its own obligations
to other nations. Tho mob ot a slnglo
city may nt any time perform acts of
lawless vlolenco against some class of
foreigners which would plunge us Into
war. The city by Itself would be power
less to maite defenso ngalnst tho for
eign power thus assaulted, and If Inde
pendent of this government It would
never venturo to perform or permit thai
performance of tho acts complained of.!
Tho entire power and the wholo duty to
protect the offending city or tho offend
ing community lies in tho hands of the
United States government. It Is un
thinkable that we should continue a pol
icy under which a given locality may bo
allowed to commit a crlmo against a
friendly nation, nnd tho United States
government limited, not to preventing
the commission of the crime, but. In tho
last resort, to defending tho people who
nao committed It against tho conso
quencas of their own wrongdoing."
Cuban Intervention.
The rebellion In Cuba and tho Inci
dents leading up to the establishment of
the provisional government Is reviewed,
and tho president says:
"When tho election has bctn held and
the new" government Inaugurated In
peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi
sional government will como to an end.
I take this opportunity of expressing
upon behalf of the American people,
with all possible solemnity, our most
earnest hope that the people of Cuba
will realize tho Imperative need of pre
serving Justice and keeping order In tho
island. The United States wishes noth
ing of Cuba except that It shall prosper
morallv and mntcrlallv. and wishes noth
ing of the Cubans save that they shall
be able to preierve order among them
selves nnd therefore to preserve their
Independence. If the elections become a
farce, nnd It the Insurrectionary habit
becomes confirmed in the Island, It Is ab
solutely out of tho question that tho
Island should continue independent; and
the United States, which has ussumed
the sporsorshlp before the civilized world
for Cuba's career as a nation, would
ngaln have to Intorvcno nnd to see that
tho government was managed In such
orderly fashion ns to sf-curo the safety
of llfo and property. The path to bo
trodden by those who exercise self-government
Is always hard, and we should
have overy charity and patience with tha
Cubans as they tread this difficult parth.
I have the utmost sympathy with, and
regard for, them; but I most earnestly
adjure them solemnly to weigh their re
sponsibilities and to see that when tholr
new government Is started It shall run
smoothly, and with freedom from fla
grant denial of right on tho one hand,
and from Insurrectionary disturbances on
the other."
Considerable space Is devoted to tha
International conference of American re
publics and tho visit of Secretary Root
to South America, nnd points to the fact
that our efforts In bohalf of the nations
of that country aro appreciated by them.
On tho subject of the Panama canal ho
promises a special message In the near
future.
The Army and Navy.
The message closes with a plea for
the maintenance of tho navy at Its pres
ent standard, to do which he say3 woult
mean tho building of ono battleship eucii
year. Of the present efficiency of the
army and navy he say..:
"Tho readiness and efficiency of both tho
army and navy In dealing with tho re
cent sudden crisis In Cuba Illustrates
afresh their value to the nation. This
readiness and efficiency would havo been,
very much less had It not been for tho
exlstonce of the general 3taft In tho army
and the general board In the navy; both
are ossential to the proper development
and use of our military forces afloat and
ashore. The troops that were sent to
Cuba were handled flawlessly. It was
the swiftest mobilization and ,!lpatch of
troops over sea over accomplished by
our government. The oxpedltlon landed
completely equlppod and ready for Im
mediate service, sowrnl of Its organiza
tions hardly remaining In Havana over
night bofore splitting up Into detach
ments and going to their several posts.
It was a fine demonstration of the valor
and efficiency ot the general staff. Sim
ilarly, It was owing In largo part to tho
general board that the navy was nblo
at the outset to meet the Cuban crisis
with such Instant efficiency; ship after
ship appearing on tho shortest notice at
any threatened point, while the marine
corps In particular performed Indlspons
ablo servlc. The nrmy und navy war

two sorvlceB, und they coopyraU with
constantly Increasing efficiency and Im
portance . , , ,
"Tho congress has most wliy provldod
for n national board for tho promotion
of rllle practise. Uxcellent results havo
already como from this luw, but It dona
not go fur enough. Our regular army
Is so small that In any great war wo
