THE ROOSEVELT CLASSIC.
President Roosevelt's last annual
message, much heralded as the admin
istration classic, was read to congress
today, and is. in substance, printed
in Tti • Evening Statesman today.
Reading the message convinces one
that President Roosevelt has grown
tired, vi ry tired of directing the af
fairs of the nation. Instead of lx*ing
the lofty summary of things done and
things attempted during his adminis
tration, which v. as wM:«r the forecast
ers Eaid the message would be, thr
paper Impresses one as having been
written with the same spirit Ss is
shown by the schoolboy who is made
to turn In an "essay" after his play
mates have been released for the day.
In tiiis message Mr. Roosevelt had
nothing to say. Only the law which
requires the president to report to
congress each year is the excuse for
the paper. En its dreary details there
arc many recommendations, but they
are recommendations which have been
made b fort, and the vigorous Roose
velt style does not arouse one as it did
in its earlier days.
In the message, in its original form,
there is page after page, of reading de
scriptive of the disaster which has
befallen China as a result of its care
lessness in the matter of its forests—
rather vivid descriptions of the denu
dation of the empire, descriptions
which on their face were written not'
in the White House, but in China.
From this it would seem that the pres
ident has inserted bodily a long dis
sertation on for-strv prepared by some
expert on forestry after a careful study
of conditions in the Chinese empire.
All of which is good reading, although
hardly to be expected in a retiring
I resident's last annual message.
That the presidency is a big job is
generally supposed; that it is a bigger
job than is the ordinary man who is
caned upon to nil it is probab'y true.
Mr Roosevelt went to the presidency
in the prime of vigorous manhood.
Whatever his admirers may say, the
fact remains that after seven years'
service he leaves the presidency a
much weakened man. In a purely politi
cal way he has accomplished much.
He has left a Roosevelt Imprint upon
current history: he has appointed his
own successor and made his name a
watchword for the incoming adminis
tration.
But in a purely physical and mental
way he has lost that which it is
doubtful if a year's rest in the Afri
can jungles will restore to him. If
you don't believe this, read today's
message to congress, and compare it
with Mr. Roosevelt's earlier state pa-
P rs.
MORE ABOUT CASTRO.
The temptation to romantic specula
tion about the movements of Presi
dent Castro of Venezuela is very great.
Circumstances and his temperament
combine to surround him with fascin
ating mystery. He has an inexhausti
ble capacity for giving the world dis
agreeable surprises. All countries
that l aye anything to do with that
Which he governs have learned to ex
pect the worst from him.
Taking everything into account, his
latest personal movements have been
followed by international gossip with
1 ss than its usual fertility of romance.
The carefully framed story that his
life depends upon going to Berlin for
a sergical operation is held languidly
in suspcns( without either accepting or
rejecting it. The real motives put ; n
place of it are hardly worthy of inter
national intervention.
The various versions of the old South
American story that he is fleeing from
an impending revolution to live on mil
lions he has secretly sent ahead of him
to Paris are not worthy of a man with
such an original genius. The least
the world has the right to expect from
Castro is that he should bring his me
teoric career to an end in some new
and startling way.
It would make a better story, with
just as much foundation of fact and
probability, to suppose that he is at
the end of his rope in his tangle of
quarrels with foreign powers and is on
a secret mission to seek protection
from the rest by throwing himself into
the arms of one of them. His destina
tion i s Berlin, though he approaches it
circuitously and seems to be driven or
by the inhosnitaiity of France.
Wry not suppose that he contem
plates a secret meeting with the kaiser
and hopes to make some kind of deal
for their common advantage.
JUST AN AGREEMENT.
Although strict constructionists —
and democrats these days are strict
constroctionistfl —will see a technical
violat on of the constitution of the
United States in the "notes" which
have just been exchanged between
the secretary of state and the Japan
ese ambassador, and although sdme
precedent-respecting senators will
probably help fid the congressional
record with "remarks" on the subject,
the chances are that this new trea ; y
which is not a treaty will stand as a
virtual arrangement between tha two
governments. It is now naively ex
plained that this interchange of notes
is not a treaty, but is merely a
statement of the mutual attitude of
the present Japanese ministry and the
present American administration.
It does not become law in this coun
try, like a treaty signed and ratified,
it binds n. ither government except so
far as future governments may desire
to be bound by it. This gives it
greater moral force than would be
lodged in a treaty so guarded as not
to transgress constitutional limitations
and so softened as to obtain the rati
fication of the senate.
So long as both governments re
main in the same mind, the agreement
will be useful as a noties to other
• ow. r- that the integrity and
dependence of China and the posses
sions of Japan and the United States
in the Pacific cannot be menaced with
impunity. But if either nat on was to
change its mind, after making secret
pa j rations for eventuaiit'es, it could
be called to account only in the pr.m
itive tribunal of arms. There would
be no ground for appeal even to the
moral s nse of nations.
Nevertheless such a statement of a
national attitude deliberately taken
and strongly supported by public opin
ion has tremendous moral force. The
famous Monroe doctrine began with a
still more informal exchange of diplo
matic notes and never has gone- farth
er than reiteration in the messages of
presidents, it has no standing in law
and no government could take steps
to execute or enforce it without- en
abling legislation.
That is exactly the situation of the
United States government in relation
to tile subject-, coveicd by the agree -
men with Japan. No future govern
ment is either bound by it or empow
ered to execute it, as the case now
.-lands. But witli the same public
opinion behind it, it might control
the destinies' of the Pacific ocean as
the Monroe Doct.ane has controlled
the destinies of the American conti
nent.
AMUSEMENTS
Florence Roberts.
To the biggest house of the year,
Florence Roberts in, the "House of
Bondage" was presented at the Keylor
Grand last night, and to most of those
who saw the play, it proved a disap
pointment. The pay is cumbersome
In its writing, has too little action and
to much talk and gives Florence Rob
erts little chance to show what kind
of an actress she really is. The tal
ented actress is popular here, but it
would be refreshing if she should ap
pear in a play worthy of her.
"The House of Bondage" should
never have been staged. It iacks en
tirely the movement necessary to
success, is too "ta'ky," and presents
its problems in a way that is not vita)
nor convincing-. . The lines them
selves are clever and would make ex
ce lent reading, but by the production
of the play Miss Roberts adds nothing
to her position—it gives her no chance
for the reaPy excellent work of which
she is capable.
Seymour Obermer, the author, has
seeming y, tried to handle his subject
after the manner of Ibsen— and has
fai'ed. It is a play that appeals to
few, has no excuse for being alive.
The strong situations are given to the
seconds and the leading parts have
little chance for display. It was an
entire disappointment to many; and
to those who liked it it was lacking
in much.
"THE GREAT DIVIDE."
The Henry Miller company has
T ; **■*• f~ «c ■nain? in X
production of "The Great Divide"
which will be the attraction at the
Keylcr Grand theater soon. The
cast is one of uniform excellence and
includes only artists of ability who
have made great reputations in the
theatrical world. Miss Mabel Brown
ell, who assumes the -part of Ruth
'"Jordan" in the play is the actress
who crented the difficult role of "the
wife" (now being- played by Margaret
Ill'ngton) in "The Thief which was

ture great American actress. Edwin
Mordant, who is the "Stephen Ghent
in the play, is an actor who comes by
his ability by heritage. His father
Edwin Mordant, Sr., was considered
the peer of all character actors on
the English speaking stage in the
time when Booth and Barrett were in
their prime. Miss Delia Knight, who
plays the part of "Polly Jordan" al
though a girl in her teens, has ac
complished as much in her short ca
reer of less than three years on the
stage a s th? average actress does in
a life time. After winning the scholar
ship and medal of a prominent Chica
go school of elocution and art she
became the leading woman at the
College theater, Chicago, and it was
there that her work came under the
direct attention of WJliam Vauehn
Modify (author of "The Great Divide")
who communicated his 'Und 'to -AT.
Miller and in turn was authorized to
engage Miss Knight at once. Those
who have seen M-iss Knight play
"Polly" say that her performance is
a most delightful one and creates a
lasting impression upon the auditor.
The other members of the cast of the
play that has been termed by the
press of the country as "The Long
Awaited Great American Play," in
clude such prominent people as Fred
erick Forrester, Wm. H. Boyd, Daniel
Pennell, Frank Wi lard, J. L. Clarke,
George Mason, George Kingston, G. K.
Schillinger. Phillip Bronsor., Charles
Simpson, Frederick Gilbert and Mrs.
C. W. Brooks. This great dramatic
scenic success will be presented at the
Keylor Grand theater on December 10.
"Little Johnny Jones."
On y the largest cities in America
had an opportunity last season of wit
nessing ' Little Johnny Jones," George
M. Cohan's very successful musical
melodrama. That the p'.ay will be pre
sented in this city soon at the Key'or
Grand theater has interested our the
ater-goers to such an extent that the
demand for seats has been unusual
ly large. "Little Johnny Jones" is prom
ised as one of the most pretentious
musical productions of the past dozen
years and one of the most beautiful
from a scenic standpoint on tour this
season. It is in three acts and four
scenes and wil] be presented here with
the same massive and rea istic scen
ery as seen for six months in New
York last season anil over four months
in Chicago. The cast is a notable one.

Message
Continued from Fage One)
ing the effectiveness of war against
crime it could not have been better
devised to this end. It forbade the
practices that had been followed to a
greater or less extent by the executive
heads of various departments for 20
years. To these practices we owe the
securing of the evidence which enabled
us to drive great lotteries out of busi
ness and secure a quarter of a mil
lion of dollars in fines from their pro
moters. These practices have enabled
us to discover some of the most out
rageous frauds in -connection with the
theft of government land and govern
ment timber by great corporations and
by individuals. These practices have
enabled us to get some of the evidence
indispensable in order to secure the
conviction of the wea'thiest and most
formidable criminals with whom the
government has to deal, both those
operating in vio'ation of the anti
trust law and others. The amend
ment in question was of benefit to no
one excepting to those criminals, and
it scrious'y hampers the government
in the detection of crime and the se
curing of justice. Moreover, it not
only effects departments outside of the
treasury but it tends to hamper the
secretary of the treasury himself in
the effort to utilize the employees of
his department so as to best meet the
requirements of the public service. It
forbids him from preventing frauds
upon the customs service, from inves
tigating irregularities in branch mints
and assay offices, and has seriously
cripp'ed him. It prevents the promo
tion of employees in the secret service,
and this further discourages good ef
fort. In its present from the restric
tion operates only to the advantage of
the criminal, of the wrongdoer. The
chief argument in favor of the provi
sion was that the congressmen did not
themselves wish to be investigated by
secret service men. Very little of such
investigation has been done in the
past; but it is true that the work of the
secret service agents was partly res
ponsible for the indictment and con
viction "of a senator and a congress
man for land frauds in Oregon. Ido
not believe that it is in the public
interest to protect criminals in any
branch of the public service, and ex
actly as we have again and again dur
ing the past seven years prosecuted
and convicted such criminals who were
in the executive branch of the govern
ment, so in my beiier we should be
given amp c means to prosecute them
if found in the legislative branch. But
if this is not considered, desirable a
special exception could be made in the
law prohibiting the use of the secret
service force in investigating members
of the congress. It would be far bet
ter to do this than to do what actually
was done, and strive to prevent or at
least to hamper effective action against
criminals by the executive branch of
the government.
Postal Savings Banks.
' I again renew my recommendations
| for postal savings banks, for deposit
ing savings with the security of the
government behind them. The object
is to encourage thrift and economy in
I the wage-earner and person of mod-
crate means. In 14 states the deposits
lin the savings banks as reported to
the comtroller of the currency amount
to $3,590,245,402, or 98.4 per cent of
the entire deposits, while in the re
maining 32 states there are only $70,-
-308.543. or 1.6 per cent, showing con
clusively that there are many locali
ties in the United States where suffi
cient opportunity is not given to the
people to deposit their savings. The
result is that money is kept in
in hiding and unemployed. It
ie believed that in the aggre
gate vast sums of money would
be brought into circu'ation through
the instrumentality of the postal sav
ings banks. While there are only L
-453 savings banks' reporting to the
comptroller there are more than 61,-
-000 postoffices, 40,000 of which are
money order offices. Postal savings
banks nre now in operation in practi
cal'y all the great civilized countries
with the exception of the United States.

i commendation for an extension of the
parcel post on the rural routes. The
establishment of a local parcel post on
rural routes would be to the mutual
' benefit of the farmer and the country
i storekee] er. and it is desirable that
I the routes, seiving more than 15.000.-
-000 people, should be utilized to the
ful est practible extent. An amend
ment was proposed in the senate at
1 the last session, at the suggestion of
the postmaster-general, providing that,
'for the purpose of ascertaining the
j practibility of establishing a special
local parcel post system on the rural
routes throughout the United States,
the postmaster-general be authorized
and directed to cxi eriment and report
;to the congress the result of such ex-
Iperiment by establishing a special lo
i cal parcel post system on rural deliv
ery routes in not to exceed four coun
jties in the United States for packages
of fourth-class matter originating on
a rural route or at the distributing post
'office for delivery by rural carriers. It
| would seem only proper that such an
] experiment should be tried in order to
demonstrate the practibility of the
proposition, especially as the postmast
er-general estimates that the revenue
derived from the operation of such a
{system on a 1 the rural routes would
amount to many million dollars.

ernment should take in the broad work
