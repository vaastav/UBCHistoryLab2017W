TON TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS.
There Will lie nt Lenat Three Didders

Sold tinier Court Deeree.
The meeting of the stockholders of the
Cincinnati. Hamilton & Dayton on Dec. 11
will be an important one for several rea
sons, and will have a bearing on the future
cf the Indianapolis division. The impor
tant questions to come up are the empower
ing of the board of directors to provide for
refunding all Indebtedness of the company
and as far as practicable to arrange for
converting the fixed obligations of the
company under leases of other railways,
guarantees, etc. In the refunding, the
bonds will bear a rate of Interest not to ex
ceed 4 per cent. To eell such refunding
bonds the board of directors may find it
expedient to refund the obligations of
the company. Among other uses to which
the proceeds of the sales of the bonds may
be put Is the purchase of any railroad held
under lease or operated under . contract;
to extend. Improve or maintain the rail
roads of the company, to construct branch
lines, to lay double or additional track,
to Increase the machinery or rolling
stock, to build depots, elevators, shops,
and. generally, for any purpose needed
in its business. It has been well known
for some time that the syndicate control
ling the property Is anxious to Improve the
Indianapolis division and extend It to tome
prominent Western railroad center, as
originally planned when the road was
built. As it now stands the property, is
a valuable one, but would be greatly en
hanced were the Indianapolis division
made more profitable by the suggested
extension.
The Eel River Road.
If reports are true there are three com
panies that desire to secure the Eel river
road, which is thrown on to tho market
through the result of the appeal to the
Indiana Supreme Court as regards the
lease of the property to the Wabash.
Richard-Roddell. who has Judicial decree
to dispose of the property', states that it
is his intention to proceed with the sale.
"Whether ho will dispose of It subject to an
appeal to the United States Supreme
Court, or whether such appeal will delay
the consummation of his purpose, is not
stated. The best legal authorities have
from the beginning held to the belief that
the "Wabash cannot win the case, and its
only object in appealing to the United
States Supreme Court would be to gain
further delay pending the building of the
Fort "Wayne & Butler road, which the
Wabash will either lease or operate when
constructed.
Personal, Local and General Xotes.
There were handled on the Big Four sys
tem, last month, 151,665 loaded cars.
Last month there were 1C.011 loaded cars
handled on the Peoria & Eastern lines.
Rumor has lt that the Pennsylvania has
secured control of tho Western Maryland
road.
In November the Big Four lines handled
on the system 5o7.sy2 passengers, against
m2G0 In November, 1899.
Roanoke is one of the best hay-shipping
points on the Wabash road. In November
ninety-two carloads of hay were shipped
from that point.
With the retirement of General Super
intendent Kimberly, of the Northern Pa
cific, owing to ill health. Assistant General
Superintendent Law has been selected as
his successor.
E. A. Ehnes, who represents the Kanaw
ha Dispatch at this point, yesterday re
ceived a circular announcing that the Sea
board Air-line had become a member of
the Kanawha Dispatch.
A. Campbell Shaw, of the general office
of the Canadian Pacific, at Montreal, has
been appointed assistant general passenger
agent of the road, with headquarters at
Chicago, vice J. Francis Lee. resigned.'
J. Francis Lee, who, on Nov. 1, retired
as assistant general agent of the Canadian
Pacific, to accept the position, of traffic
manager of the Yukon & White Pass Potil-
road will receive a salary of $7,5üU per an
num. If. F. Houghton, superintendent of the
Chicago division of tho Big Four, who,
some weeks ago, broke his ankle, acci
dentally, was at his ofllce yesterday for
the first time since the accident. He still
uses crutches.
J. E. Minor, passenger conductor for
many years on the Big Four, who, a few
weeks ago, was suspended, was yesterday
reinstated, and it is understood that two
more of the passenger conductors who were
suspended will be reinstated this week.
The decision of the Indiana Supremo
Court in the Eel River-Wabash case is
said to be very gratifying to the citizens of
Fort Wayne, Wabash and Huntington, as
they believe it will result in the Toledo
branch again becoming part of the main
line.
In November there were handled at the
city freight depots of the Pennsylvania
lines, in this city, 27.9C4.874 pounds of
freight, representing 2,773 cars, an average
of over 10,000 pounds per car, loaded, which
is a good average, when bulky as well as
heavy merchandise is included.
C. E. Lambert, general passenger agent
of the West Shore, who has been seriously
ill, is reported to be rapidly recovering,
and William F. Thornton, formerly gen
eral Eastern passenger agent of the Lack
awanna, has so far recovered from his re
cent serious illness as to be about again.
C. E. Glbbs has resigned as general
freight agent of the Omaha, Kansas City
& Eastern, and E. H. Shauffer, assistant
general manager, has been appointed
freight traffic manager. With this change
the headquarters of the freight depart
ment are removed from Qulncy, 111., to
Kansas City.
The final steps were taken by the Rich
mond Council, last night, to secure from
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company a new
depot and other extensive improvements.
The company presented a bond of $50,000.
as a guarantee for the performance of the
work. The company is to spend JCO.OOO on
the structure.
The Northern raclflc has taken quite a
radical step, proposing to do away with
telegraph lines In dispatching trains. The
management has been watching experi
ments with the long distance telephone and
has decided to fit the line with a telephone
system. A complete telephone system will
be established, covering every essential
point on the entire line. It is said that the
new system will save an immense amount
of time and money.
The Pennsylvania transportation depart
ment has under consideration the putting
on of a train to make the run from Chicago
to New York in seventeen hours. The com
pany; on the Pennsylvania road proper,
now has a train scheduled to make tho run
between Pittsburg and New York in ten
hours and fifteen minutes, and it Is pro
posed to shorten the running time of this
train one hour and thirty minutes, and the
Pittsburg, Fort Wayne & Chicago will cut
down the running time on its end of the
route.
Reports have been circulated lately to
the effect that J. J. Turner, general supei
lntendent of th Vandalia line, would suc
ceed John F. Miller us general superin
tendent of the Pennsylvania lines west of
Pittsburg, under the new pension system.
Mr. Turner, who was East last week, was
at St. Louis headquarters yesterday, and
when asked about his prospective appoint
ment, said: 'Of course Mr. Miller will
be retired on the first of the year. Who
his successor will be I cannot state, but
I will not be the man."
THE BAR ASSOCIATION
Proposes to Abolish the Superior und
Criminal Courts.
The Indianapolis Bar Association met
jesterday and elected the following of
ficers: O. B. Jameson, president; Nathan
Morris, first vice president; William A.
Ketcham, second vice president; E. R.
Keith, secretary: Lafayette Perkins, treas
urer; Charles Martlndale, F. O. Pickens,
A. C. Ayers, J. K. McCulIough and L. M.
Harvey, executive committee; W. W.
Woollen, L. C. Walker, II. N. Spaan. J.
It. Morgan, C. S. Wiltsle. L. JJ. Ewbank,
and Vincent Clifford, committee on admis-'
slons.
The proposed legislation for increasing
the number of circuit Judges in Marlon
county to live, abolishing the Superior and
Criminal Courts, and providing that each
Judge shall sit on the Criminal Court bench
six months in rotation, was referred to a
committee which will report at the Jan
uary meeting.
The committee having charge of the pro
posed amendments to the Constitution pro
viding for an increased number of judges
for the Supreme Uench and in the qualifi
cations of attorneys for admission to the
bar, reported that the Governor had only
announced the vote cast for and against
the amendrnrnts and also the total vote of
the State which did not mean that the
amendments were lost. It Is believed by
members of the association that the
amendments carried and the committee
was Instructed to look after the matter
and see that the Legislature makes pro
vision for the proposed amendments.
BREWERY WORKERS' TROUBLES.
Organisation to De Addressed by Ju
lius Zorn.
Julius Zorn, international secretary of the
United Brewery Workers Union, of Cin
cinnati, will address a joint meeting of
the local Brewery Workers Union, and
the newly organized unions of the stable
men, drivers, engineers and firemen, at
Rekhwein's Hall to-night. It is announced
that unless all the men are organized the
union men will be called out. Albert Lieb
er, of the Indianapolis Brewing. Company,
and his men, deny that any manner of in
timidation has been practiced by that
firm.
An Unwarranted Report.
The reported differences that existed be
tween the Meier ä: Co.'s overall factory
and the Garment Makers' Union over the
use of the union label, was investigated
by Organizer John L. Feltman, of Central
Labor Union, and Mis3 Lillie Frederick,
president of the Garment Makers' Union,
yesterday and it was found that the report
was unwarranted. It was charged that
the company was using tho union label and
not paying the scale. The two representa
tives met Mr. Meier and a comparison of
the wages paid tallied with the agreement,
and in some instances was above . the
agreement.
Stationary Engineers and Firemen.
A meeting will be held In Central Labor
Union Hall to-night to organize the sta
tionary engineers and firemen of the city.
This organization is separate from the
organization of engineers and firemen em
ployed In breweries and is organized under
the International Union of Steam Engi
neers. PRIMARY ELECTION BILL.
Representative John' A. Mlnturn Has
Prepured One.
Representative-elect John A. Minturn
has prepared a reform primary election
bill of seventy-one provisions which covers
all phases of proposed election reforms.
The bill does away with political conven-'
tlons except for the purpose of drafting,
platforms, but no candidate can be nom
inated at the convention. A registration
system is to be established providing for
all voters to register, seven, five or two
weeks before the final election. At the
registration the candidates are voted for.
Candidates are to announce themselves
thirteen days before the primary election
providing their petition is signed by a
certain number of voters and is recognized
by the state and county oiflcers. according
to the office for which they desire to be a
candidate. Mr. Minturn says hi3 bill Is
largely in the manner of suggestions for
reforms and that he will not push Its en
actment. He wishes to give the legislative
committee something to build a reform law
on. The suggestions, he says, have been
carried out in other States and arc prac
tical. Muncle Ministers Take Action.
At the meeting of the Muncle Ministerial
Association, yesterday, steps wero taken to
havo some important legislation enacted at
the coming- session of the Legislature. The
ministers propose to have divorce laws
amended by making the causes for divorce
fewer and prohibiting divorced couples
from marrying for two years. It Is claimed
that divorces in Muncle have been averag
ing about five a week of late, and many
have remarried the day the decreo was se
cured. HOTEL MEN WILL BANQUET.

BOARD OF TRADE ACTION.
A Short Session Held Laut N I k: lit New
Member Elected..
The Board of Trade held a short session
last night. Hugh H. Hanna. jr., was
elected a member to succeed the late J.
S. Pratt. A communication from the St.
Louis Merchants' Association relative to
the removal of war revenue stamps was
discussed, but no recommendation was
made. Secretary Gage, of the United
States Treasury, has already advised a
reduction of revenue and the matter was
so complicated that tho board thought
best to take no positive action at this
time. A communication from tho National
Board of Trade fixed the date for tho an
nual meeting of that body on Jan. 22, In
"Washington, D. C. and gave the local
president authority to appoint four dele
gates. The appointments will be made
later.
MARION CLUB WILL GO.
Arranging to Attend Inaugural Cere
monies nt Washington.
About sixty members of the Marlon Club
met at the clubhouse last night and dis
cussed a plan to attend the Inauguration of
President McKinley at Washington next
March. It was decided that the club shall
be represented and it is expected that a
very large delegation will make the trip
It was stated that P) will be sufficient to
pay the cost of the uniform, railroad fare,
sleeper and meals on the train en route to
and from Washington for each man. If
there shall be a sufficient number to make
the trip a special train will be used.
Its First Central Station.
The Home Heating and Lighting Com
pany Tsill build its first central station for
generating hot water and electric lighting
at Sixteenth and Alabama streets, the two
vacant lots at that corner having been
purchased yesterday by the company for
Jt;.tt0. The company ha3 not decided what
system of hut water heating It will use.
PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S
MESSAGE.
(CONCLUDED FROM FIFTH PAG E.)
thing over $100.000,000. This plan received
the approval of the Congress, and since
then regular appropriations have bteen
made and the work of fortification has
steadily progressed.
More than $Go,Ouo,coO have been Invested
in a great number of forts and guns with
all the complicated and scientific machinery
and electrical appliances necessary for their
use. The proper care of this defensive ma
chinery requires men trained in its use.
The number of men necessary to perform
this duty alone is ascertained by . the War
Department at a minimum allowance to be
IS. 420.
There are fifty-eight or more military
posts in the United States other than the
coast defense fortifications. The number
of these posts is being constantly Increased
by Congress. More than $22.000,000 have
been expended in building and equipment,
and they can only be cared for by the regu
lar army. The posts now In existence and
others to be built provide for accommoda
tions for and if fullv garrisoned require
26,000 troops. Many of "these posts are along
our frontier or at Important strategic
points the occupation of which Is neces
sary. We have in Cuba between 5,000 and 6.000
troops. For the present our troops in that
island cannot be withdrawn or materially
diminished, and certainly not until the con
clusion of the labors of the constitutional
convention now in session and a govern
ment provided by the new constitution
shall have been established and Its stabil
ity assured.
In Porto Rico we have reduced the gar
risons to l.CCG, which Includes 8D6 native
troops. There is no room for further re
duction here.
We will be required to keep a considerable
force in the Philippine islands for some
time to come. From the best Information
obtainable we shall need there for the im
mediate future from 0,000 to 60,ooO men. I
am sure the number may be reduced as the
insurgents shall come to acknowledge the
authority of the United States, of which
there are assuring indications.
It must be apparent that we will require
an army of about CO.00O. and that during
present conditions in Cuba and the Philip
pines the President should have authority
to Increase the force to the present num
ber of 100,00. Included In this number au
thority should be given to raise native
troops In the Philippines up to 13,000, which
the Taft commission believe will be more
effective In detecting and suppressing
guerrillas, assassins and ladrones than our
own soldiers.
The full discussion of this subject by the
secretarj of war In his annual report is
called to your earnest attention.
I renew the recommendation made in my
last annual message that the Congress pro
vide a special medal of honor for the vol
unteers, regulars, sailors and marines on
duty in the Philippines who voluntarily re
mained In the service after their terms of
enlistment had expired.
I favor the recommendation of the secre
tary of war for the detail of officers from
the line of army when vacancies occur In
the adjutant general's department. Inspec
tor general's department, quartermaster
general's department, subsistence depart
ment, pay department, ordnance depart
ment and signal corps. The army cannot
be too highly commended for Its faithful
and effective service In active military op
erations in the field and the difficult work
of civil administration.
MORE SHIPS AND MEN.
Secretary ' Long's Recommendations
Approved by the President.
Very efficient service has been rendered
by the navy in connection with the insur
rection in the Philippines and the recent
disturbance in China.
A very satisfactory settlement has been
made of the long pending question of the
manufacture of armor plate. A reasonable
price has been secured and the necessity
for a government armor plant avoided.
I approve of the recommendations of the
secretary of the navy for new vessels and
for additional officers and men which the
required Increase of the navy makes neces
sary. I commend to the favorable action of the
Congress the measures now pending . for
the erection of a statue to the memory
or the late David D. , Porter.
I commend alo the establishment of a
national naval reserve and of the grade
of vice admiral. (
Provision should be made as recommend
ed by the secretary for suitable rewards
for special merit. Many officers who ren
dered the most distinguished service dur
ing: the recent war with Spain have re
ceived in return no recognition from tho
Congress.
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.
POSTAL SERVICE.
Blessings of the Extension of Rural
Free Delivery Pointed Out.
The continued and rapid growth of the
postal service Is a sure index of the great
and increasing business activity of the
country. Its most striking new develop
ment is the extension of rural free de
livery. This has come almost wholly with
in the last year. At the beginning of the
fiscal year 1809-1000 the number of routes
in operation was only 301, and most of
these had been running less than twelve
months. On the 13th of November, 1900,
the number had Increased to 2,614, reach
ing Into forty-four States and Territories,
and serving a population of 1.S01.524. The
number of applications now pending and
awaiting action nearly equals all those
granted up to the present time, and by
the close of the current fiscal year about
4 00) routes will have been established,
providing for the daily delivery of mails
at the scattered homes of about three and
a half mlllious of rural population.
This service ameliorates the isolation of
farm life, conduces to good roads, and
quickens and extends tho dissemination of
general Information. Experience thus far
has tended to allay the apprehension that
It would be bo expensive as to forbid its
general adoption, or make it a serious bur
den. Its actual application has shown that
it increases postal receipts, and can be ac
companied by reductions In other branches
of the service, so that the augmented rev
enues and the accomplished savings to
gether materially reduce the net cost. The
evidences which point to these conclusions

port of the postmaster general which with
its recommendations is recommended to the
consideration of the Congress. The full de

LANDS, PENSIONS, CENSUS.
Features of the Work of the Interior
Department.
The total area of public lands as given by
the secretary of the Interior is approxi
mately 1.071,SS1,662 acres, of which 917.033.SS0
acres are undisposed of and 154.743.7S2 acres
have been reserved for various purposes.
The rublic lands disposed of during the
year amount to 13.433.8S7.06 acres, Including
62.423.09 acres of Indian lands, an Increase
of 4.271.474.S0 over the preceding year. The
total receipts from the sale of public lands
during the fiscal year were $4,373,738.10, an
increase of $1,3X,62).76 over the preceding
year.
The results obtained from our forest
policy have demonstrated its wisdom and
the necessity in the interest of the public for
its continuance and Increased appropria
tions by the Congress for the carrying on
ot the work. On June 30, 1900, there were
thirty-seven forest reserves, created by
presidential proclamations under Section
2 of the act of March 3, 1S91, embracing an
area of 4U23.329 acres. During the past
car the Olympic reserve, in the State of
Washington, was reduced 2.0i0 acres,
leaving Its present area at 1.902.840 acres.
The Prescott reserve in Arizona was in
creased from 10.240 acres to 423.US0 acres, and
the Big Horn reserve in Wyoming was in
creased from 1,127.690 acres to 1,1 SO, 800 acres.
A new reserve, the Santa Ynex. in Califor
nia, embracing an area of 145,00) acres, was
created during this year. On Oct. 10, 1900,
the Crow Creek forest reserve, in Wyoming,
was created, with un area of 56,320 acres.
- At the end of the fiscal year there were
on the pension roll 993,223 names, a net in
crease of 2.010 over the fiscal year 1S93. The
number added to the rolls during the year
was 43,344. The amount disbursed for
armv pensions during the year was $134.
700.Dy7.24, and for navy pensions, $3,761,533.41.
a total of $133.2.130,63. leaving an unex
pended balance of $5.542.7.25 to be covered
into the treasury, which shows an increase
over the previous year's expenditures of
$107,077.70. There were 6S4 names added to
the rolls during the year by special acts
passed by the first session of the Fifty
sixth Congress. The act of May, 1900, among
other things, provides for an extension of
income to widows pensioned under said
act to $230 per annum. The secretary of
the interior believes that by the operations
of this act the number of persons pensioned
under it will increase and the increased
annual payment for pensions will be be
tween $3.000.000 and $4.000,x'O. The govern
ment Justly apprecelates the services of its
soldiers and sailors by making pension
payments liberal beyond precedent to them,
their widows and orphans.
There were 6.540 letters patent granted,
including reissues and designs, during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1900; 1,600 trade
marks, 6S2 labels and ninety-three prints
registered. The number of patents which
expired was 19.0SS. The actual receipts for
patents were $1,33S,22S.35. The expenditures
were $1,247,S27.5S, showing a surplus of $110.
400.77. The attention of Congress Is called to the
report of the secretary of the Interior
touching the necessity for the further es
tablishment of schools in the Territory of
Alaska, and favorable action is Invited
thereon.
TERRITORY OF HAWAII.
Much Interesting information is given in
the report of the Governor of Hawaii as to
the progress and development of the Islands
during the period from July 7, 189S, the date
of the approval of the joint resolution of
the Congress providing for their annexa
tion, up to April 30. 1900, the date of the
approval of the act providing a govern
ment for the Territory and thereafter. The
last Hawaii census, taken In the year 1S96,
gives a total population of 109,020, of which
31,019 were native Hawaiians. The num
ber of Americans reported was S.4S5. The
results of the federal census taken this
year show the islands to have a total popu
lation of 154,001. showing an increase over
that reported in 1S96. of 44.9S1. or 41.2 per
Cwnt ere has been marked progress in
the educational, agricultural and railroad
development of the islands. In the terri
torial act of April 30, 1000. Section 7 of said
act repeals Chapter 34 of the civil laws of
Hawaii, whereby the government was to
assist in encouraging and developing the
agricultural resources of the republic, es
pecially irrigation. The Governor of
Hawaii recommends legislation looking to
the development of such water supply as
may exist on the public lands, with a view
of promoting land settlement. The earnest
consideration of Congress is Invited to this
important recommendation and others as
embodied Ip the report of the secretary of
the interior. .
The director of the census states that
the work in connection with the twelfth
Census is progressing favorably. This na
tional undertaking ordered bv the Congress
each decade has finally resulted in the col
lection of an aggregation of statistical
facts to determine the industrial growth
of the country, its manufacturing and me
chanical resources, its richness in mines
and forests, the number of its agrlcultur
'.thelr, far,m? and products, its educa
tional and religious opportunities, as well
as questions pertaining to sociological con
ditions. The labors of the officials in charge
?foiile buau ln(1'cat that the law of
March 3, 1ö99, requiring the completion of
tne rour important and most desired sub
lS'e n.am,ely' Population, agricultural,
manufacturing and vital statistics, will be
C0J?2.plcie wlthin the Prescribed limit.
The field work incident to the above in
quiries is now practically finished, and as a
JrwiÜ Vie PPuIatlon of the States and
Territories, including the Hawaiian islands
and Alaska, has been announced. The
growth of population during the last
decade amounts to over 13.000,(X0. a greater
numerical Increase than in any previous
census In the history of the country.
Bulletins will be issued as rapidly as'
possible giving the population bv States
and Territories by minor civil divisions.
Several announcements of this kind have
already been made, and It is hoped that
the list will be completed by Jan. 1. Other
bulletins giving the results of the manu
facturing and agricultural inquiries will be
given to the public as rapidly as circum
stances will admit.
The director, while confident of his abil
ity to complete the different branches of
the undertaking In the allotted time, finds
himself embarrassed by the lack of a
trained force properly equipped for statis
tical work, thus raising the question
whether in the interest of economy and a
thorough execution of the census work
there should not be retained in the govern
ment employ a certain number of experts
not only to nld in the preliminary organiza
tion prior to the taking of the decennial
census, but in addition to have the advan
tage In the field and office work of the
bureau of trained assistants to facilitate
the early completion of. this enormous un
dertaking. I recommend that the Congress at Its
present session apportion representation
among the several States as provided by
the Constitution.
AGRICULTURE.
"Whet Secretary Wilson Is Doing; for
Farmers and Others.
The Department of Agriculture has been
extending Its work during the past year,
reaching further for new varieties of seeds
and plants; co-operating more fully with
the States and Territories in research along
useful lines; making progress in meteoro
logical work relating to lines of wireless
telegraphy and forecasts for ocean-going
vessels; continuing Inquiry as to animal
disease; looking Into the extent and char
acter of food adulteration; outlining plans
for the care, preservation and Intelligent
harvesting of our woodlands; studying soils
that producers may cultivate with better
knowledge of conditions and helping to
clothe desert places with grasses suitable
to our arid regions. Our Island possessions
are being considered that their peoples
may be helped to produce the tropical
products now so extensively brought Into
the United States. Inquiry Into methods of
improving our roads has been active during
the year; help has been given to many lo
calities, and scientific investigation of ma
terial in the States and Territories has been
inaugurated. Irrigation problems In our
semi-arid regions are receiving careful and
increased consideration.
An extensive exhibit) at Paris of the
products of agriculture has made the peo
ples of many countries more familiar with
the varied products of our fields and their
comparative excellence.
The collection of statistics regarding our
crops is being improved and sources of In
formation are being enlarged, to the end
that producers may have the earliest ad
vices regarding crop conditions. There has
never been a time when those for whom
it was established have shown more appre
ciation of the service of the department.
MISCELLANEOUS.
Allen Contract Law Civil Service
Care of Public Record.
In my annual message of Dec. 5, 1S9S, I
called attention to the necessity for some
amendment of the alien contract law.
There still remain important features of
the rightful application of tho eight-hour
law for the benefit of labor and of the
principle of arbitration 'and I again com
mend these subjects to the careful atten
tion of the Congress.
That there may be secured the best
service possible In the Philippine islands,
I have issued, under date of Nov. 10, 1900,
the following order: "The United States
Civil-service Commission is directed to
render such -assistance as may be prac
ticable to the Civil-service Board, created
under the act of the United States Philip
pine Commission for tho establishment and
maintenance of an honest and efficient
civil-service in the Philippine islands, and
for that purpose to conduct examinations
for the civil-service of the Philippine
islands, upon the request of the Civil-service
Board of said islands, under such regu
lations as may be agreed upon by the said
Board and the said United States Civil
service Commission."
Tho Civil-service Commission is greatly
embarrassed in its work for want of an
adequate permanent force for clerical and
other assistance. Its needs are fully set
forth In its report. I Invite attention to
the report, and especially urge upon the
Congress that this important bureau of
the public service which passes upon the
qualifications and character of so large a
number ot the officers and employes of the
government should be supported ty all
needed appropriations to secure prompt
ness and ettlclency.
I am very much Impressed with the state

building In "Washington, so far as I am
Informed, the space for official records is
not only exhausted, but the wall3 of rooms
are lined with shelves, the middle floor
space of many rooms is filled with file
cases anel garrets and " basements, which
were never intended and are unlitted for
their accommodation, are crowded with
them. Aside from the inconvenience, there
is great danger, not only from Are, but
from the weight of these records upon
timbers not intended for their support.
Ihere should be a separate building, es
pecially designed for the purpose of receiv
ing and preserving the annually accumu
lating archives of the several executive
departments. Such a hall need not be a
cestly structure, but should be so ar
ranged as to admit of enlargement from
time to time. I urgently recommend that
the Congress take early action in this
matter.
I transmit to the Congress a resolution
adopted at a recent meeting of the Amer
ican Bar Association concerning the pro
posed celebration of John Marshall da
Feb. 4, li01. Fitting exercises have been
arranged, and It is earnestly desired by
the commltete that the Congress may par
ticipate in this movement to honor the
memory of the great jurist.
The transfer of the government to this
city Is a fact of great historical interest.
Among the people there is a feeling of
genuine pride In the capital of the Re
public. It is a matter of interest in this
connection that in 1S0O the population of
the District of Columbia was 14.013; to-day
it is 27S.71S. The population of the city of
Washington was then 3.210; to-day it is
21S,115. The Congress having provided for
an appropriate national celebration of the
centennial anniversary of the stabllshment
of the beat of govtrnment in the District
of Columbia, the committee authorized by
lt has prepared a programme for the 12th
of December. 1900, which date has been
selected as the anniversary day. Deep In
terest has been shown In the arrangements
lor the celebration by the members of the
committees of the Senate and House of
Representatives, the committee of Gover
nors appointed by the President and tho
committees- appointed by the citizens and
Inhabitants of the District of Columbia
generally. The programme, in addition
to a reception and other exercises at the
executive mansion, provides commemora
tive exorcises to be hold Jointly by the
Senate and House of Representatives in
the hall of the House ot Representatives,
and a reception at the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in honor of the Governors of the States
and Territories.
In our great prosperity we must guard
against the danger It invites of extrava
gance in government expenditures and ap
propriations; and the chosen representa
tives of the people will, I doubt not, fur
nish an example in their legislation of that
wise economy which in season of plenty
husbandü for the future. In this era of
great business activity and opportunity
caution is not untimely. It will not abate
but strengthen confidence. It will not re
tard, but promote legitimate Industrial and
commercial expansion. Our growing
power brings with It temptations and
perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid.
It must not be used to invite conflicts, nor
for oppression, but for the more effective
maintenance of those principles of equality
and Justice upon which our Institutions
and happiness depend. Let us keep always
In mind that the foundation of our govern
ment is liberty; its superstructure peace.
