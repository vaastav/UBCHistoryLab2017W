ENGLISH SINK GERMAN CRUISERS
IN FIERCE FIGHT
Land Battles Waged Furiously on Roth
East and West Fronts. No Decisive
Victory.
London—A British squadron under
command of Vice Admiral Sir Freder
ick Sturdee, chief of the war staff,
engaged a German squadron under
Admiral Count von Spee off the Falk
land Islands in the south Atlantic
Tuesday, and won a decisive victory
that is being acclaimed throughout
England.
The armored cruisers Scharnhorst
and Gneisenau and the protected crui
ser Leip8ic, three of the German war
shjpg which had been menacing the
British shipping and part of the'squa
dron which sank the British çruisers
-Good Hope and Monmouth in the Pa
cific on November 1, were destroyed,
while the cruisers Dresden and Nürn
berg, the two other vessels which com
posed the German squadron, made off
during the engagement, and according
to latest accounts, are being pursued.
Two colliers were captured.
The announcement of this engage
ment and victory which was the most
important naval engagement of the
with the exception of that off
made
Heligoland last August, was
Wednesday evening in a statement by
the admiralty of less than 100 words,
as follows:
Official Statement.
"At 7:30 a. m. on the 8th of De
cember, the Scharnhorst, Gneisenaw,
Nürnberg, Leipsic and Dresden were
sighted near the Falkland islands by
a British squadron under Vice Admir
al Sir Frederick Sturdee.
"An action followed, in the course
of which the Scharnhorst, flying the
flag of Admiral Count von Spee, the
Gneisenau and the Leipsic were sunk.
The Dresden and Nürnberg made off
during the action and are being pur
sued.
"Two colliers were also captured.
"The vice admiral reports that the
British casualties were few in number.
"Some survivors have been rescued
from the Gneisenau amd the Leipsic."
Loss of Life Heavy.
The statement makes reference to
survivors rescued from the Gnei

senau and the Leipsic, but no men

Scharnhorst, which was the flagship
of the German admiral, being saved,
and it thus presumed that Count

that the British squadron was rein

Washington, Dec. 8.—President Wil
son's second annual address to con
' gress today was the signal for settling
down to the real work of the short
session.
The Joint session of the house and
senate was held In the chamber of the
house to hear the president,
branches met at noon, the members of
the senate marching over to the house
side for the joint session, which with
Vice President Marshall and Speaker
Clark presiding, convened promptly
at 12:30 o'cclack. The president, as
he usually does when going to con
gress drove directly from the White
House to the house wing of the capi
tol, without stopping at the presiden
tial offices.
Gallerten packed to the doors and
senators and representatives crowd
ed upon the floor of the hall of the
house, awaited the arrival of the pres
ident. Seven members of the cabinet
had seats just before the speaker's
desk, including Secretary Bryan, who
Washington, Dec. 8 . —President Wil
son departed from the prepared text of
his annual address to congress today,
which was devoted principally to ans
wering those who contend that the
United States is unprepared for na
tional defense, to give notice to the
business world that the legislative pro
gram of his administration, as it af
fects regulation of business, was prac
tically completed. He said it had re
sulted in a clear road for business to
travel to "unclouded success."
Honest business men, the president
declared, need have nothing to fear in
treading the way outlined in the trust
and currency bills. While the presi
dent dwelt briefly upon the subject,
his words were interpreted as an as
surance that no further important bus
iness legislation was contemplated.
The president's remarks in full with
relation to business legislation were
as follows :
"Our program of legislation with re
gard to the regulation of business is
now virtually complete. It has been
put forth, as we intended, as a whole
and leaves no conjecture as to what is
to follow. The road at last lies clear
and firm before business. It is a road
which it can travel without fear or
embarrassment. It is the road to un
grudged, unclouded success. In it
every honest man, every man who be
lieves that the public interest is part
of his own interest, may walk with
perfect confidence."
In the text of his address, which
touched upon the administration legis
lative program for the session, urging
passage of bills for Philippine inde
pendence, government owned mer
chant marine, and some other projects
begun hut unfinished at the last ses
sion, the president devoted most time
to discussing the question of national
defense, deploring a policy of militar
ism but indorsing a development of
the national guard and a military
training for citizens.
The Democratic side of both house
and senate greeted with applause and
laughter his declaration that "some
among us are nervous and excited,"
and that "we shall not turn into a mil
itary camp."
"And especially when half the world
is on fire," said the president, "we
shall be careful to make our moral in
surance against the spread of the con
flagration very definite and certain
and adequate indeed."
This sentiment was favorably re
ceived on both sides of the chamber.
The president's address, the longest
he had yet delivered to congress, occu
pied about 40 minutes in the reading.

deserted his usual place in the diploma
tic gallery.
The president entered the chamber
exactly at 12:30, greeted by applauBe
and cheers as he shook hands with the
speaker and the vice president. A mo
ment later he began reading his ad
dress.
The Democratic side of the chamber
applauded loudly when the president,
in discussing national defense, declar
ed that the country never would be
ready, in time of peace "to put in the
field a nation of men trained to arms."
Another outburst greeted his declara
tion against compulsory military ser
vice.
The president read slowly and de
liberately and his voice was a trifle
husky. He was first interrupted when
he asserted that "we have stunted and
hindered the growth of our merchant
marine." A scattered outburst of ap
plause greeted the statement.
Departs From His Text.
After speaking of the "notable re
cord" of legislation of the administra
tion, the president departed from the
text of his prepared address to say
that the program of the administration
with regard to legislation affecting
business "is now virtually completed."
It had been put forth by congress, the
president continued, as "we intended,
as a hope, and needs no conjecture as
to what was intended."
The road for business to travel, the
president declared, was "clear and
firm," a road which business could
travel without fear, " a road to un
clouded success."
"In it," the president declared, ev
evry honest man may walk with con
fidence."
Another burst of hand clapping
greeted the president's statement that
the bill for the building of government
shipping lines to South and Central
America was imperative.
Applause For Peace.
"We are the champions of peace and
of concord," said the president, and
again the Democratic side applauded.
Hand clapping frequently interrupted
the president's argument that the Uni
ted States should preserve its reputa
tion as a .peace loving .nation, and his
conclusion that it shall never "have a
large standing army."
Applause from both sides of the
chamber greeted President Wilson's
announcement for national defense, a
"citizenry trained to arms." When the
president declared that "we shall not
change our attitude toward the na
tional defense" because "some among
us are nervous and excited," an out
burst of applause and laughter inter
rupted him for nearly a minute. The
president concluded his address at

AN ANONYMOUS LETTER
Times Receives Purported Exoneration
of Massey.
Through the mail Tuesday the Times
is in receipt of an anonymous letter
in which the writer protests the in
nocence of Gl enn Massey , recently con
victed and sentenced for forgery of a
number of checks. The writer states
that he and several others did the
forgeries and tried to throw the blame
upon Massey. In the letter was a
check for $250, supposedly signed by
Smith and McMaster and is a palpable
forgery. The letter was turned over
to Massey's attorney, W. P. Guthrie,
for investigation. While the Times
has little confidence in the statements
in the letters there have been a num

mistake made, he should be given a
chance to prove his innocence.

SUDDEN DEATH OE J. R. JONES
Young Man Drops Dead at Darrow
Brothers' Seed Warehouse.
J. R. Jones dropped dead Tuesday
afternoon at the seed warehouse of
Darrow Brothers where he has been
employed for the past four years. He
was at work as usual in the warehuse
and was seen by his companions to
stoop over as to pick up a sack full of
seed, as he stooped, he was seen to
fall..
His companions were at his
side in an instant and it was seen at
a glance that he was in a serious con
dition. A physician was sent for, and
when he arrived, announced that Mr.
Jones had died of apoplexy, death oc
curring instantly. Mr. Jones was a
native of Tennessee, and has been
living in Twin Falls for the past four
years, coming here direct from his
home in the south. All of this time,
excepting only a few months, when
out proving up on
stead, he has been in the employ of
the Darrow Brothers' Seed company.
The members of the firm speak highly
of him as a young man of exemplary
habits. Mr. Jones has not relatives
in this part of the country. The re
mains were taken to a local undertak
ing establishment, and the relatives
in Franklin, Tennessee were notified.
A request was received to ship the re
mains to the old home for interment,
which was done Wednesday evening,
day evening.
When he went to work at noon Tues
day, Mr. Jones was in his usual good
health, but had received word that
his father was very ill, and it is
thought that the worry might have
had something to do with his sudden
death.

His Land Here Next Spring.
If the intentions of Mr. and Mrs.
H. P. Fajen are realized, spring will
find them in Idaho, near Twin Falls,
where Mr. Fajen purchased some land
two and one-half years ago. This is
an irrigation country and they will
raise potatoes and alfalfa mainly.
Many of us hard workers here can
well envy them the pleasant life they
will have there, and all of us are
sorry that we will lose them as resi
dents of our town. Both are about the
best liked persons iu the community.
Mr. Fajen has been leader in the
business life of our town for a num
ber of years, in public favor often
showing greater strength than any
one else. He is the leader of our band,
of which the town prides itself, aud
we hope that one of the boys can take
his place and keep the band on its
high merit. We should say, should a
few more moves of this class take
place, that Twin Falls is skimming

DELIVERS ADDRESS
With Scholarly Oratory Pays Respects
to the Departed Members of the
Lodge.
One of the most largely attended and
Impressive memorial services ever held
in this city marked the passing of an
other milestone for the local Elks'
lodge, and with it the passing to the
great Beyond of a few more brothers
of the lodge. Always a beautifully
impressive service, the memorial open
to the public this year took on added
interest because of the splendid mu
sic promised and the presence of At
torney Clinton B. Hartson, of Boise,
one of the really eloquent attorneys
of this state. The Havering theatre
was filled with Elks and their friends,
who listened with delight to the beau
tifully rendered solos of Mre. C. O.
Longley and Mr. Peck and to the quar
tette by Messrs. Peck, Reid, McMaster
and Ruttolph and the Symphony Or

Mr. Hartson, with rare eloquence,
dwelt mainly upon the immutability of
Death and the need of faith, hope and
charity of the living to lessen the sor
row and agony of the final passing.
His address is reprinted below.

We halt today for a few moments
in life's great journey to say a few
words over our departed brothers. The

familiar step the loftiest as well as
the humblest stations of human life,

spirit which prompted our motto:
