How about that letter, General?
Congress passed but two bills at its
extra session—a poor business for two
months’ labor.
Sixty-two dead bodies, from the
wreck of the steamer “ Huron," have
been found on the North Carolina coast
and buried.
Are there any more tax collectors
anxious to see us ? We have just laid
iu a full supply of Bowie knives aud
Colt's revolvers.
Will “ the Eastern Shore law,” as
applicable to the election of a United
States Senator, be repealed ? Conun
drum.
If “the Eastern Shore law ” be re
pealed, who will get the plum? Sec
ond conundrum.
The investigation by the Govern
ment of the loss of the “ Huron,”
recently wrecked off the coast of North
Carolina, has developed no facts not
already published.
It is said that, when Representative
Bland read the President’s message, his
smile was “ child-like and bland.” Bret
Harte’s “ heathen Chinee ” faded into
insignificance by comparison.
Isn't it about time for our neighbor
across the way to blow another blast
upon his “ fraud ’’ horn ? Several weeks
- have elapsed since we had the pleasure
of seeing in his progressive journal a
two-column editorial on “ the de facto
President.” We hope he will not allow
the coli-webs to gather in the trumpet.
Slippery Dick ” Connelly, lately
of New York City, has just confessed
judgment to the city for the small sum
of SB, 107,000.15, for money borrowed
from its treasury without its consent.
“ The Tribune ” suggests that, while it
can not be expected that he should re
turn the eight millions, he might show
bis sorrow by returniugthe fifteen cents.
The war in the East proceeds with
varying success. No striking victory
has been achieved by either of the com
batants during the past week, and it is
probable that both Turks and Russians
will shortly go into Winter quarters to'
recuperate and to make preparations for
a vigorous Spring campaign. The ques-'
tion as to which is “the sick man ” is
still an open one.
The maddest editor in America is
said to be Wash McLean, of the “ Cin
cinnati Inquirer.” The cause of the
anger is the message of the President.
“Joined to his idols,” “captured by the
Wall street sharks,” “ traitor to the
interests of his own people,” are some
of the expressions this model editor
indulges in—all because the President
refuses to adopt the inflation theories of
Ohio lunatics.
The Virginia Legislature met, on
Wednesday last, and elected as Speaker
of the Lower House, the leader of “the
debt adjusters." When it is known
that “ debt adjusters ” is another name
for repudiatiouists, it will be seen of
how much value is all the boasted i
“ honor of Virginia” and her “ untar-1
wished escutcheon " Time for the Bour
bon journals to pitch the “fraud " veil
on another key.
It is announced, on what seems to be
good authority, that Daniel W. Voor
hees, “ the tall sycamore of the Wabash,”
is preparing to “ spread himself” on the
financial question We hope Senators
will give him full opportunity, and that
the Washington patriots will crowd into
the galleries and applaud, to the echo,
the glowing rhetoric of the windy states
man. It will be a great day for the
American eagle.
The Prisoners’ Aid Society have is
sued a circular, inviting the Sheriffs,
States' Attorneys, County Commission
ers, Physicians, Superintendents of
Alms Houses, Keeper of Jails, and
others interested in the matter, to meet
in the city of Baltimore, in State Con
vention, to consider the tramp nuisance,
and to draft a bill to bo presented at
the approaching session of the Legis
lature to provide for its suppression.
Judge Humphreys, of Washington,
has decided the habeas corpus case which
involved the question whether Senator
Patterson should be delivered to the
South Carolina authorities on the requi
sition of Wade Hampton He decides
that the Senator is not “a fugitive from
justice,” that he is in Washington iu
pursuance of his constitutional duties
ami not subject to requisition. In ren
dering his judgment he takes occasion
to say, what a great many people have
long believed, that if the Senator should
happen to get into the clutches of Wade
Hampton s rifle clubs, bis chances for a
fair trial would be slim. It would have
been better, perhaps, if that remark,
however true, had not fallen from a
judge deciding a question of law.
Among the things to be done by the
Legislature at its next session, the Bal
timore “ Gazette ” mentions the follow
ing :
“Among the subjects which will de
mand the attention of the Legislature,
at its next session in January, will be
the local option law, the militia reor
ganization, the condition of the reforma
tories and public charities, the exten
sion of the limits of the city of Balti
more. and the laws for the better pro
tection of sheep against destruction liv
dogs. Hardly any one of these is, or
ought to be, a party question, and we I
trust that they will not bo approached
in a partisan spirit. As to the local
option law, it is not a thing to lie de
cided on sentimental or theoretical con
siderations. It is no longer an experi
ment. It lias been tried with varied
results in several parts of tlie country,
and it is rather by an inquiry into its
practical working elsewhere than by '
arguments that the subject should lie
I discussed. The true mode would lie to
obtain full reports upon its workings,
where it lias been successful, ami whore
it (ails to work well, and where it lias
been tried and abandoned and why.”
j
THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The first annual message of Presi
dent Hayes gives ample proof that lie
lias not forgotten howto be “ amiably
stubborn.” After ail the criticism, fre
quently severe and ofttimes unjust, to
which he has been subjected, he still
adheres to the views expressed and the
policy outlined in his inaugural address.
He shows no inclination to falter in the
course lie has marked out for himself.
Upon all the questions that have at
tracted the attention of the country
since lie became President, lie stands
where lie stood on the fourth of March.
Considering the attainment of “ national
pacification ” of prime importance, he
gives the topic tiie place of honor, and
dwells with evident satisfaction upon
the resuits already achieved by the
adoption of what is popularly known
as “the Southern policy." However
much that policy may have been an
tagonized, the bitterest opponent can
not deny that the showing lie makes is
quite encouraging. “ Political turmoil
and turbulence have all disappeared :
useful industries have been resumed:
public credit in the Southern States lias
been greatly strengthened, and the en
couraging benefits of a revival of com
merce between the sections of the coun
try, lately embroiled iu civil war, are
fully enjoyed." lie closes this portion
of the message with the assuring avowal
of his earnest determination to use all
tliff power under his control to secure
the recognition of the political rights,
aud to ensure the personal safety of the
colored men of the South.
From the question of conciliation, he
[lasses to what, in our opiuion, is of
equal importance—the financial credit
and honor of the nation. Upon this
subject, certainly, he speaks with “no
uncertain sound.” The credit of lhe
nation must be preserved. Our obliga
tions must, iu no wise, lie impaired,
and any effort to pay the national debt
in a depreciated currency must lie re
garded simply as a blow aimed at the
plighted faith of the whole people.
Specie payments should lie resumed as
early as practicable. While lie believes
iu a silver currency for some purposes,
and recommends Congress to provide
for “a silver coinage,” he urges upon
that body the necessity of “ a firm pro
vision exempting the public debt here
tofore issued and now outstanding from
“payment, either of principal or interest,
in anv coinage of less commercial value
, - n
I than the present gold coinage of the
country.” It looks as if he intends to
wipe out Bland “ as with a sponge.”
Ills position on this whole question of
finance must be highly satisfactory to
all, except the champions of dishonest
money and the thieves who go around
under the cloak of repudiation.
The President next devotes a short
chapter to the Civil Service, and recom
mends the resurrection of the civil ser
vice commission that was born and
buried under tho administration of
President Grant. The recent humiliat
ing failure of that commission is so
fresh in the minds of the people that
the project will, probably, obtain but
few supporters.
The remainder of the message is not
of very great interest to the majority
. of readers. The country is felicitated
! upon I lie preservation of pence with ail
| foreign nations. The Mexican border
troubles and the Cuban insurrection,
with its effects on American commerce,
are briefly referred to, and the message
closes with some general remarks upon
a variety of topics of minor import
ance.
Upon the whole it is a state paper
not brilliant , but eminently sensible and
practical, and places the President in
the light of a wise counselor anil a safe
, ! Executive.
BUTLER OF SOUTH CAROLINA.
During the recent debate in the Sen
ate on the admission of M. C. Butler
as a Senator from South Carolina, Gen
eral Gordon, speaking in advocacy of
Butler's right, dwelt at considerable
• length and with strong emphasis upon
his (Butler’s) aristocratic birth, and
urged in his favor the blue blood that
coursed through his veins. Senator
Hoar arose and, in reply, said: “It is
not a question of the lilood in General
. Butler’s veins, the question is as to the
blood on his hands.'' The remark was a
crushing answer to all the twaddle about
noble lineage and aristocratic ancestors,
and abruptly brought the Senate back
to a consideration of the merits and the
character of the man who was knock
ing at its doors for admission. It was
a question as to the part taken by this
man in the infamous massacre of de
fenseless prisoners, the butchery of
ignorant, helpless negroes at Hamburg
in the Summer of 187 G. The evidence
that found its way to the North at the
time, and the more complete testimony
elicited since, point irresistibly to one
conclusion. They place this man, who
has been admitted to a seat in the U.
S. Senate by the combined votes of
Democrats and carpet-baggers, in the
the light of an instigator of the massa
cre and the champion of the active par
ticipants in the outrage. No vehement
denial, no special pleading can rub out
the admissions made at the time and the
corroborating circumstances. No sub
sequent conduct can atone for his par
ticipation in tho infamy. The massa
cre was one that was attended by the
most barbarous features. It was cruelty
of the basest character. It was the per
fection of cold, calculating murder. A
band of innocent, unoffending negroes,
following the instincts of the race, were
marching in holiday attire, and with
some noisy but harmless demonstrations
of joy, through the streets of Hamburg,
South Carolina. They were met by sev
eral scions ol Southern chivalry who
demanded the right of way. The col
ored men refused to concede it. The j
whites, incensed at what they chose to I
consider the presumption of the blacks,
! withdrew, increased their numbers, re-j
I turned, fell upon the unarmed proces
| sion with savage fury, chased the mem
bers fit' it through the streets, captured
a number of them, led them out into an
open Held, told them to “run for their
lives ” and shot them down in cold blood
as they ran. And the instigator and
the champion of the blistering crime
receives, as his reward, a seat in the
Senate of America. All honor to the
Republicans of the Senate that ihey
refused to put a premium upon wanton
murder.
Onderdonk’s History of Mary
land.—We have received a copy of
Ouderdonk’s school history of Mary
land, which appears to be, with one
exception, well written. It is proba
bly as near the truth as the political
views of the author’s mind would per
mit him to make it. While facts are
apparently stated with fairness and
impartiality, there is an illy-concealed
effort apparent to so color the narrative
of the war of the rebellion as to lead
those who read the book to believe that
the rebel sympathizers of that day were
right and those who opposed them were
wrong. If Mr. Onderdonk had written
as impartially of this period of Mary
land history as he has done of the
period that preceded it, he would have
produced a good work. However, this
history of Maryland is a great improve
ment upon a child's history of the
United States that was published some
years ago, just after the close of the
war, which, for the size of it, probably
contained more lies than any other book
published before or since, the Arabian
Nights not excepted.
CONGRESS.

During the past year four new school houses, with
J appropriate outbuilding*, have been built after plans
J suitable for the purpose* intended, and at a very mod-
J erate * o*f. a* will be seen by the Treasurer's account.
, It maybe safely said that the Public School* of the
1 county are advancing in character, and one evidence of
- th:- i* that some of the Inst of mir young teachers have
; never been in any other schools than the Public Sohuols
of our own county.

. Rheumatism—lts Cure.
TO THE AFFLICTED—DEAR FRIENDS:
I deem it only my duty, a neglect of whhji would
be injustice to buffering humanity, to (state to you the
great medical effects of my Pain Searcher in promptly
curing Rheumatism. I have cured hundredi* of cases
during thn last five years, among which 1 Khali only
j briefly refer to a few of the worst. On Wednesday*
July*sth, I was called to see a young man suffering
I terribly that he could not bear to be touched, much less,
i moved; yet in less than 24 hours after using the Pain
Searcher he could use both legs and one arm, and at the
end of 4S hours he arose, and talked upstairs without
help: he is now (July ITthj perfectly well. He only
used two bottles. Another case who had been under
medical treatment about one year, came under my care.
He could neither dress nor undress himself; yet in fire
I week* he could do as good a day's work as usual in the
rolling mill. He only used five bottles of Pain Searcher
to make the cure. Another ca>e of fifteen years’ staud
-1 ing was cured by the Pain Scorcher. This gentleman
had made very few full weeks at work during these
i years, on account of the aches and pains at times more
than others he suffered He is now perfectly well.
Another rape was a yonngJady who had suffered badly
for four months under me<ncal treatment; could not
move in the least without suffering terriblv ; yet in *
sixteen hours i ftei using the Pain Searcher she’ arose
and walked across tin' room, and only a few davs were
required to restore her to perfect health again. *
Another, and the last case 1 shall refer to, is a hoy of
13 years, lie could not move at all. and vet in about
J 4 hours lie arose and walked across the room, and soon,
was restored to health again by the Pain Searcher
These nnd hundreds of others 1 can refer to. The l oofc
of references is open to all. In Neuralgia, Headache.
I ramps and I ains. Diarrlura. Ac., it j* ••.juallv as certain.
A bottle costing only 50 cents has often saved the life
