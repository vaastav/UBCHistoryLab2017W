ation of pension bills, Vest, of Missouri,
isave notice that the '-passing of a lot of
pension bills simply by the reading of

had got to be stopped." He went on to
say that southern members had felt some
delicacy about opposing pension legislation,
bnt the late war removed the bar, and
they, while recognizing liberal, pension
legislation as a snered duty, proposed to
Vest that pension bills'should be carefully
,*€5"4? -considered. Vest introduced a joint reso

ernor of Western Calm.
Havana, Dec. 9.—Majftr General
Wade, president of the United States
svacuation commission, has received
certain instructions from President
McKinley which seem to indicate that
he will be appointed military governor
jf western Cuba. General Wade's
three months of official residence here
lias given him a firm grasp on the
situation. General Greene will be
governor of the city of Havana. He
has already virtually taken hold, as
he is having some of the streets cleaned
and is devising measures for the sani
tation and policing of the city. Senor
Fernando de Castro, the Spanish civil
trovcrnor, and the alcade of Havana
are accepting his suggestions and aid
ing him in the work. The prepara
tion for a change of flags is thus
being
0{
brought about by degrees, and
If the transition will not be abrupt,
pf Already the evacuation of the province
Havana is complete except for the
tri)ops stationed in the city. Of these
fjsl there are 12,000, and they probably
will retire to Cienfuegos before

president begins his annual report
by. reference to Improved conditions, fail
ure of autonomy in Cuba, destruction of
the Maine,the failure of negotiations with
Spain and the flnal recourse to arm?. He
then tells the story of the war practically
as it is known. Then lie says:
Independent Government for Calm,
"As soon as we are in possession of
Cuba and have pacided the Island, it will
be necessary to give aid and direction to
its people to form a government for
themselves. This should be undertaken
at the earliest moment consistent with
safety and assured success. It is Im
portant that our relations with these peo
ple shall be of the most friendly charac
ter, and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist In every proper way to build up the
waste places of the island, encourage the
Industry of the people and assist them
to form a government which shall be free
and independent, thus realizing the best
aspirations of the. Cuban people.
Spanish rule must be replaced by a just,
benevolent and humane government, ere
ated by the people of Cuba, capable of
performing all international obligations
and which shall encourage thrift, indus
try and prosperity and promote peace and
good will among all of the Inhabitants,
whatever may have been their relations
in the past. Neither revenge nor passion
should have a place In the new govern
ment. Until there is complete tranquility
in the Island and a stable government In
augurated military occupation will be
Continued."
He then refers to our pleasant relations
with foreign countries. Referring to the
Nlcaraguan canal, he says:
Report of Nicaragua Caaal Commission.
"The Nicaragua canal commission, un
der the championship of Bear Admiral
John 6. Walker, appointed July 24, 1S97,
under the authority of a provision in the
sundry civil act of Juno 4 of that year,
has nearly completed its labors, and the
results of its exhaustive inquiry Into the
proper route, "the feasibility and the cost
of construction of an interoceanic canal
by a Nlcaraguan routo will be laid before
you. In the performance of its task the
commission received all possible courtesy
and assistance from the governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus
testified their appreciation of the Import
ance of giving a speedy and practical out
come to the great project that has for so
many years engrossed the attention of
the respective countries. As the scope of
recent inquiry embraced the whole sub
ject, with the aim of making plans a.nd
surveys for a canal by the most conven
ient route, it nocessarily included a re
view of the results of pievious surveys
and plans, and in particular those adopt
ed by the Maritime Canal Company un
der its existing concessions from Nica
ragua and Costa Rica, so that to this ex
tent those grants necessarily held an es
sential part in the deliberations and con
clusions of the canal commission, as they
have held and must needs hold in the
discussion of the matter by the congress.
Under these circumstances and in view of
overtures made by the governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other par
ties for a new canal concession predi
cated on the assumed approaching lapse
of the contracts of tho Maritime Canal
Company with those states, I have not
hesitated to express my conviction that
considerations. cf expediency and inter
national policy as between the. several
governments interested In the construc
tion and control of an interoceanic canal
by this route require the maintenance of
the status quo until the canal commis
sion shall have reported and tho United
States congress shall have had the op
portunity to pass finally upon the wholo
matter during the present session, with
out prejudice by reason of any change
In the existing conditions. Nevertheless,
It appears that the government of Nica
ragua as one of its last sovereign acts be
fore merging its powers in those of the
newly formed United States of Central
America has granted an optional conces
sion to another association, to become ef
fective bn the expiration of the present
grant. It does not appear what surveys
have been made or what route is pro
posed under this contingent granted, so
that an examination o£ the feasibility of
its plans is necessarily not embraced in
the report of the canal commission. All
these circumstances suggest the urgency
of some definite action ly the congress at
this session if the labors of the past are
to be utilized and the linking of the At
lantic and Pacific oceans by a practical
water way is to ho realized. That the
construction of such a maritime highway
is now more than ever Indispensable to
that intimate and ready intercommunica
tion between our eastern and western
seaboards demanded by the annexation of
the Hawaiian islands and the prospective
expansion of our influence and commerce
in the raciflc, and that our national pol
icy now more imperatively than ever calls
for its control by this government, are
propositions which 1 doubt not the con
gress will duly appreciate and wisely act
upon.
Chilian Claims.
"A convention providing for the revival
of the late United Slates and Chilian
claims commission and the consideration
of claims, which were duly presented to
the late commission but not considered
because of the expiration of the time lim
ited for the duration of the commission,
was signed May 24, 1897, and has remained
unacted upon by the senate. The term
therein fixed for effecting the exchange
of ratifications having elapsed, the con
vention fails unless the time be extended
by amendment, which I am endeavoring
to bring about, with tho friendly con
currence of the Chilian government.
American Interests in the Orient.
"The United States has .not been an
indifferent spectator of the extraordinary
events transpiring in the Chinese Empire,
whereby portions of its maritime prov^
Inces are passing under the control of
various European powers: but tho pros
pect that the vast commerce which the
energy of our citizens and the necessity
of our staple productions for Chinese
uses has built up In those regions may
not be prejudiced through any exclusive
treatment by the new occupants has ob
viated the need of our country becoming
an actor in the scene* Our position among
nations having a large Pacific coast, and
a constantly expanding direct trade with
the farther orient, gives us the- equit
able claim to consideration and friendly
treatment In this regard, and it will be
my aim to subserve our large interests In
that quarter by.all means appropriate to
the constant policy of our government.
The territories of Kiao-Chow, of wcl
Hal-Wel and of Port Arthur and Talien
Wan, leased to Germany, Great Britain
and Russia respectively for terms of
fears, will, it is announced, be open to
International commerce during such alien
occupation, and if no discriminating treat
ment of American citizens and their trade
be found to exist or be hereafter devel
oped the desire of this government would
appear to be realised. In this relation, as
showing the volume and value of pur ex
changes with China, and the peculiarly
favorable conditions which exist for their
expansion in the normal course of trade.
I-refer to the communication addressed to
the speaker of the house of representa
tives by the secretary of the treasury oh
the Mth of last June, v"h its accom
panying letter of the secretary of state,
recommending an appropriation for a
commission to study the commercial and
industrial conditions in the Chinese Em

recommendation receive at y»»wr hand£
the consideration which its importance
and timeliness merit. Meanwhile, there
may be just ground fur disquietude in
view of the unrest and revival of tho
old sentiment of opposition and preju
dice to alien people, which pervades cer
tain of the Chinese provinces. As in the
case of the attacks upon our citizens
in. Szechuan and at Kutien in 1885, tho
United States minister has been instruct
ed to secure the fullest measure of pro
tection, both local an'd Imperial, for any
menaced. American interests, and to de
mand, in case of lawless injury to person
or property, instant reparation appro
priate to the case. War ships have been
stationed at Tlen-Tsln for more ready ob
servation of the disorders which have
Invaded even the Chinese capital, so as
to be in a position to act should need
arise, wh'Ile a guard of marines has been
sent to Peking to afford the minister the
same measure of authoritatlvo protection
as tho representatives of other nations
have been constrained to employ."
Annexation of Hawaiian Islands.
Referring to Hawaii the president has
the following to say:
"Pending the consideration by the sen
ate of the treaty signed June 16, 1S97, by
tho plenipotentiaries of the United
States and Of the Repulbic of Hawaii,
providing for the annexation of the isl
ands, a joint resolution to accomplish
the same purpose by accepting the offer
ed cession and incorporating tho ceded
territory Into the union was adopted by
the congress and approved July 7, 1S98.
I thereupon directed the United. States
steamer Philadelphia to convey Rear Ad
miral. Miller to Honolulu, and intrusted
to his hands this important legislative act
to be delivered to the president of the
Republic of Hawaii, with whom the ad
miral and the United States minister were
authorized to make appropriate arrange
ments for transferring tho sovereignty
of the islands to tho United States. This
was simply but impressively accomplish
ed the 12th of August last by the deliv
ery of a certified copy of the resolutions
to President Dole, who thereupon yield
ed ua to the representatives of the gov
ernmeht of the United States the sover
eignty and public property of the Ha
waiian islands. Pursuant to the terms of
the joint resolution and In exercise of
the authority thereby conferred upon me,
I directed that the civil, judicial and
military powers theretofore exercised by
the officers of the government of the Re
public of Hawaii should continue to be
exercised by those officers until congress
shall provide a government for the incor
porated territory subject to- my power to
remove such officers and to fill vacan
cies. The president, officers and troops
of the republic thereupon took the oath
of allegiance to the United States, thus
providing for the uninterrupted contin
uance of all the administrative and mu
nicipal functions of the annexed territory
until congress shall otherwise enact.
Following the further provision of the
joint resolution, I appointed Shelby M.
Cullom of Illinois, John T. Morgan of Ala
bama, Robert R. Hitt of Illinois, Sanford
B. Dolo of Hawaii and Walter F. Grear
of Hawaii as commissioners to confer
and recommend to congress such legisla
tion concerning the Hawaiian islands as
they should deem necessary or proper.
The commissioners having fulfilled the
mission confided to them, their report
will be laid before you at an early day.
It is believed that their recommendations
will have the earnest consideration due
to the magnitude o! the responsibility
resting upon you to gtVe such shape to
the relationship of those mid-Pacific isl
ands to our home union as will benefit
both in the highest degree, realizing the
aspirations of the community that has
cast Its lot with us and elected to share
our political heritage, while, at the same
time, justifying the foresight of those
who for three-quarters of a century have
looked to the assimilation of Hawaii as
natural and inevitable consummation,
in harmony with our need3 and in ful
fillment of our cherished traditions. The
questions heretofore pending between Ha
waii and Japan growing out of the al
leged mistreatment of Japanese treaty
immigrants were, I am pleased to say,
adjusted before the act of transfer by
the payment of a reasonable indemnity to
the government of Japan, Under the
provisions of the joint resolution tho
existing customs relations of the Ha
waiian Islands with the United States and
with other countries remain unchanged
until legislation shall otherwise provide.
The consuls of Hawaii here and in oth
er countries, continue to fulfill their com
mercial agencies, while the United States
consulate at Honolulu is maintained for
all proper services pertaining to trade
and the revenue. It would be desirable
that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian
islands should receive new exequaturs
from this government. The attention of
congress is called to the fact that our
consular offices having ceased to exist
in Hawaii and being about to cease in
other countries, coming under the sover
eignty of the United States, tho provis
ions for the relief and transportation of
destitute American seamen in these coun
tries under our consular regulations will
in consequence terminate. It is proper,
therefore, that new legislation should be
enacted upon this subject,- in order to
meet that changed condition."
Total Casualties of the War.
Referring to the number of casualties
during the war, he says:
"The total casualties in killed and
wounded In the army during the war was
as follows: Officers killed, 23: enlisted
men killed, 257 total, 280: officers wound'
ed, 113 enlisted men wounded, 1,464 total,
1,577. Ot the navy: Killed, 17 wounded,
67 died as result of wounds, 1 invalided
from service, 6 total, 91.
"It will be observed that while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and in
numerous perilous undertakings in block
ades and bombardment, and more than
fifty tltousand of our troops were trans
ported to distant lands and engaged in
assault and siege and battle and many
skirmishes In unfamiliar territory, we
lost in both arms of the service a total of
1,668 killed and wounded and in the en
tire campaign by land and sea we did
not lose a gun or a flag or a transport
or a ship, and with the exception of the
crew of the Merrlmac, not a soldier or
sailor was taken prisoner. Aug. 7, forty
six days from the date of the landing of
Gen. Shatter's army in Cuba, and twen
ty-one days from the surrender of San
tiago, the United Status troops com
menced embarkation for home and our
entire force was returned to the United
States as
.early as Aug. 24. They were ab
sent from the United States only two
months. It is fitting that I should bear
testimony to the patriotism and devotion
of that large portion of our army which,
although eager to be ordered to the post
of greatest exposure, fortunately was not
required outside- of the United Stutes.
They did their whole duty, and, like their
comrades at the front, have earned the
gratitude of the nation. In like manner
the officers and men of the army and
of the navy who remained in their de
partments and stations of. the navy, per
forming most important duties connected
with the war, and whose requests for as
signment In the field and at sea it was
compelled to refuse because their serv
ices were indispensable here, are entitled
to the highest commendation. It is my
regret that there seems to be no provision
for their suitable recognition.
Relations with Great Britain*
Referring to Great Britain, he says:
"Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing.
Assenting to our request, the protection
of Americans and their interests in Span
ish jurisdiction wm assumed by the di
plomatlc and.consular representatives

•allowed to make fitting allusion to the
instance of Mr. Ramsden, her majesty's
consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose- un
timely death after distinguished service
and untlrng effort during the siege of
that city was sincerely lamented.
"In the early part of last April, pur
suant to a request made at the Instance
of the secretary of state by the British
ambassador at this capital, tho Canadian
government granted facilities for the pas
sage of four United States revenue cut
ters from the great lakes to the Atlantic
coast by way of the Canadian canal and
the St. Lawrence river. Tha vessels had
reached Lake Ontario and were there
awaiting the opening of navigation when
war was declared between the United
States and Spain. Her majesty's gov
ernment thereupon, by a communication
of tho latter part of April, stated that
the permission granted before the out
break of hostilities would not be with
drawn, provided tho United States gov
ernment gave assurance that the vessels
In question would proceed direct to a
United States port without engaging in
any hostile operation. This government
promptly agreed to the stipulated condi
tion, it being understood that the vessels
would not be prohibited from resisting
any hostile attack.
"It will give me especial satisfaction if
I shall be authorized to communicate to
you a favorable conclusion of the pend
ing negotiations with Great Britain in
respect to the Dominion of Canada. It is
the earnest wisli of this government to re
move all sources of discord and irritation
In our relations with the neighboring do
minion. The trade between the two coun
tries is constantly increasing and it is im
portant to both countries that all reason
able facilities should be granted for its
development."
The New Possessions.
"I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or the future of the new pos
sessions which will come to us as the re
sult of the war with Spain. Such dis
cussion will he appropriate after the
treaty of peace shall be ratified. In
the meantime and until the congress has
legislated otherwise it will be my duty to
continue the military governments which
have existed since our occupaton and
government of the people, security in life
and property, ami encouragement under
a just and beneficial rule."
Condition of tho Treasury.
Referring to the condition of the na
tional treasury the message says:
"The secretary of tho treasury reports
that tho receipts of the government from
all sources during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1898, including $84,751,223 receiv
ed from sale of Pacific railroads, amount
ed to $105,321,335, and its expenditures to
$443,36S,582. There was collected from cus
toms $149,575,062 and from internal rev
enue $170,900,641. Our dutiable imports
amounted to $324,735,479, a decrease of ?5S,
156,690 over the preceding year, and im
portations free of duty amounted to
$291,414,175, a decrease from the preceding
year of $90,524,068. Internal revenue re
ceipts^ exceeded those of the preceding
year by $24,212,068. The total tax collect
ed on distilled spirits was $92,546,899. on
manufactured tobacco $36,230,522 and on
fermented liquors $39,515,421. We exported
merchandise during the year amounting
to $1,231,482,330, an increase of $180,488,774
from the preceding year. It is estimated
upon the, basis of present revenue laws
that the receipts ot the government for
the year ending June SO, 1899, will be_
$577,874,607 and its expenditures. J689^7i,647,
resulting In a deficiency of $112,000,000.
On the 1st of December, 1898, there Was
held In the treasury gold amounting to
$138,441,547, gold, bullion amounting to
$138,502,545, silver bullion amounting to
$32,359,250 and other forms of money
amounting to $451,963,981. On the same
date the amount of money of all kinds
in circulation or not included in treasury
holdings was $1,836,S79.504, an increase for
the year of $165,794,966. Estimating our
population at 75,194,000 at the time men
tioned the per capita circulation was
$25.09. Tha provisions made for strength
ening the resources of the treasury in
connection with the war have given in
creased confidence in the purpose and
power of the government to maintain the
present standard and has established
more firmly than ever the national credit
at home and abroad. A marked evidence
of this is found in tho Inflow of gold to
the treasury. Its net gold holdings Nov.
1898, were $239,885,160, compared with
$153,573,147 Nov. 1. 1897, and an Increase
of net cash of $207,756,100 Nov. 1, 1897, to
$300,238,275 Nov. 1, 1898. The present ratio
of net treasury gold to outstanding gov
ernment liabilities, including United
States treasury notes of 1890, silver cer
tificates. currency certificates, standard
sliver dollars and fractional silver coin,
Nov. 1, 1838, was 25.35 per cer.l, as com
pared with 16.96 per cent Nov. 1, 1897.
Quotes Message of '07.
"I renew so much of my recommenda
tion of December, 1897, as follows: 'That
when any of the United States notes are
presented for redemption in gold and are
redeemed in gold, such notes shall be
kept and set apart and only paid out in
exchange for gold. This Is an obvious
duty. If the holder of the United States
note prefers tho gold and gets It from the
government, he should not receive back
from the government a United States note
without paying gold In exchange. The
reason for this is made all the more ap
parent when the government Issues an
interest-bearing debt to provide gold for
the redemption of United States notes—
a noninterest-bearlng debt. Surely it
should not pay them out again except
on demand and for gold. If they are put
out in any other way they may return
again, to be followed by another bond
issue to redeem them—another interest
bearing debt to redeem a nonlnterest
bearing debt.'
'This recommendation was made in the
belief that such provisions of law would"
insure to a greater degree the safety of
the present standard and better protect
our currency from tho dangers to which
it is subjected from a disturbance in the
general business conditions of the coun
try."
To Gradually Retire Greenbacks.
"In my judgment the present condi
tion of the treasury amply Justifies the
immediate enactment of the legislation
recommended one year ago. Under which
a portion of the goM holdings should
be placed in a trust fund from which
greenbacks should be redeemed upon pre
sentation, but when once redeemed should
not thereafter be paid out except for
gold. 'It is not to be inferred that other
legislation relating to our currency is
not required on the contrary, there Is
an obvious demand for it. The impor
tance of adequate provision which will
insure to our future a money standard
related as our money standard now Is
to that of our commercial rivals is gen
erally recognized. The companion prop
osition that our domestic paper currency
shall be kept safe and yet be

to the needs of our industries and in

responsive to such needs is a proposition
scarcely less important. The subject, in
all its parts, is commended to the wise
consideration of the congress."
Increase of Begnler Army Recom
mended.
Recommending an increase In the army,
the president uses the following language:
"Under the act of congress approved
April 2G, 1898, authorizing the president,
in bis discretion, 'upon a declaration of

gress that War exists,' I directed the* in

be redncM to
gggfl
peace basis by the transfer In the same
arm of the service or absorption by pro-^
•motion or honorable discharge under such
regulations as the secretary of war may
establish of supernumerary commissioned
officers and the honorable discharge or
transfer of supernumerary enlisted men
and nothing contained in this act shall be
construed as authorizing the permanent
increase of tho commissioned or enlisted
force of the regular army beyond that
now provided for by the law in force
prior to the passage of this act, except
as to the increase of twenty-five majors
provided for in section 1 hereof.'
"The importance of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest, and the recommendation
of the secretary of war for that purpose
has my unqualified approval. There can
be no questiomthat at this time and prob
ably for some time in the future 100,000
men will be none too many to meet the
necessities of the situation. At all events,
whether the number shall be required
permanently or not, the power should bo
given to the President to enlist that force
If in his discretion it should be neces
sary, and the further discretion should be
given him to recruit within the Ibove lim
it from the inhabitants of the islands
with the government of which we are
charged.
"It Is my purpose to muster out the
entire volunteer army as soon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of
the regular establishment. This will be
only an act of justice and will be much
appreciated by the brave men who left
their homes and employments to help the
country in its emergency."
Union Paolilo Railway.
In reference to sale of Union Pacific
railways, he {says:
"It Is a gratifying fact 'that the result
of these proceedings against the Union
Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific
Line is that the government has received
on account of its subsidy claim the sum
of $G4,751,223.75, an increase of 18,997,163.75
over the sum which the reorganization
committee originally agreed to bid for the
joint property, the government receiving
its whole claim, principal and Interest,
on the Union Pacific and the principal of
its debt on the Kansas Pacific Railroad.
Steps had been taken to foreclose the
government's lien upon the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company, but before action
was commenced congress passed an act,
approved July 7, 1898, creating a commis
sion. consisting of the secretary of tho
treasury, the attorney general und the
secretary of the Interior and their suc
cessors in office, with full power to settle
the indebtedness to the government grow
ing out of the issue of bonds in aid of
construction of the Central Pacific and
Western Pacific bond-aided railroads,
subject to the approval of the president.
No report has yet been made to me by
the commission thus created. Whatever
action Ms had looking to a settlement of
the indebtedness in accordance with the
act referred to will be duly submitted to
congress.
Growth of the Postal Service.
"The postal service of tho country ad
vances with extraordinary- growth. With
in twenty years both the revenues and
the expenditures of the postoffice de
partment have multiplied threefold. In
the last ten years they have nearly dou
bled. Our postal business grows much
more rapidly than our population. It now
involves an expenditure of $100,000,000 a
year, numbers 73.000 postoffices, and en
rolls 200,000 employes. This remarkable ex
tension of a service, which Is an accurate
index of the public conditions, presents
gratifying evidence of the advancement
of education, of the increase of communi
cation and business activity and of the
Improvement of mail' facilities leading to
their constantly augmenting use.
"The war with Spain laid new and ex
ceptional labors in the postoffice depart
ment. The mustering of the military and
naval forces of. tha United,
quired special mail' arrangements for ev
ery camp and every campaign. The com
munication between home and camp was
naturally eager and expectant. In some
of the larger places of rendezvous as
many as 50,000- letters a day required
handling. This necessity was met by the
prompt detail and dispatch of expe
rienced. men from the established force,
and by directing all the instrumentali
ties of the railway mail and postoffice
service so far as necessary to this new
need'. Congress passed an act empower
ing the postmaster general to establish
offices or branches at every military camp
or station, and under this authority the
postal machinery was- speedily put into
effective operation.
"Under the same authority, when our
forces moved upon Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, they were attended and
followed by the postal service. Though
the act of congress authorized the ap
pointment of postmasters where neces
sary it was early determined that tli
public interests would be best subserved
not by new designations, but by the de
tail of experienced men familiar with evr
ery branch of the service, and this pol
icy was steadily followed. When tho
territory which was the theater of con
flict came Into our possession, it became
necessary to re-establish mall facilities
for the resident population, as well as to
provide them for our forces of occupa
tion, and the former requirement was mot
through the extension and application of
tho latter obligation. I gave the requi
site authority and the same general prin
ciple was applied to this as to other
branches of civil administration under
military occupation. The details are more
particularly given in the report of the
postmaster general, and while the work is
only just begun it is pleasing to be able
to ^ay that the service in the territory
which has come under our control is al
ready materially improved.
Indorses Plans for Increasing Navy.
The following recommendations of the secre
tary of tlie navy relative to the Increase of the
navy have my earnest approval: 1. Three sen
going, sheathed and coppered battle ships of
about 13.500 ton* trial displacement, ennylns
the heaviest armor and moat pi,., .rful ord
nance for vessels of their clans, ami to have
the highest practicable speed and great radios of
action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and
armament, $3,600,000 cach. 2. Three sheathed
and coppered armored cmlsers of abont 12.000
tons trial displacement, carrying the heaviest
armor and most powerful ordnance for ves
sels of their class, and to hare the highest
practicable speed and great radius of action.
Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and arma
ment, $4,000,000 each. 3. Three sheathed and
coppered protected cruisers of about 0,000 tons
trial displacement: to have the highest prac
ticable speed and great radius of action, and
to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable
for vessels of their class. Estimated' cost, ex
elusive of armor and. armament, $2,150,000 cach.
4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about,
2,500 tons trial displacement to have the high
est speed compatible with good ernlslng tiuali
ties, great radius of action and to carry the
most poVrerful ordnance suited to vessels of
their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of ar
mament, $1,141,800 each. I join, with the eeere
retary of the navy fn recommending that the
grades of admiral and vice admiral be tem
porarily revived, to be filled by officers who
have specially distinguished themselves In the
war with Spain. 1 earnestly urge upon con
gress tho Importance of early legislation pro
viding' for the taking of the twelfth census.
This Is necessary In view of the large amount
of wort which must be performed In the prep
aration of the schedules preparatory to the
enumeration of the population.
Large Additions to tho List of Pen
sioners.
"There were on the pension rolls June 30.
1S9S, UO.1,714 names, an increase of nearly 18,000
over tbe number on the rolls the same day
of tbe preceding year. The amount appropriat
ed by the act of Dec. 22, 189G, for the pay
ment of pensions for the fiscal year 1898 was
$140,000,000. Eight million seventy thousand
eight hundred and seventy-two dollars and for
ty-six cents was appropriated by tbe act of
Uarch 31, 1808 to cover deficiencies in army
pensions and repayments In tbe snm of $12,
020.33,molting a total of $148,82,802.70 available
for thp payment of pensions during tbe fiscal
year 1898. Tbe amonnt disbursed from that sum
was (144.661,870.80, leaving a balance of $3,
431,012.69 unexpended June 30, 1808, which
was covered Into the treasury. There were 380
names added to the rolls during the year by
special acts passed at the second session of the
Ofty-flfth congress, making a total of 0,486 pen
•fatten by congressional enactments since 1861.
Tie total receipts' of the patent offlce dur
ing the last year were $1,253,048.44. The ex
penditures were M,081,633.70, leaving sur
plus ot 9172,314.65.

Work of the Department of Agriculture
"The department of ugrlculture bus been ac
tive in the lust year. Explorers have been sent
to. many of the countries of tbe eastern and
western hemispheres for seeds and plants that
may be useful to the United States and with
the further view of opening up markets tor
our Burplus products. The forestry division of
the department Is gfvlng special attention to
the treeless regions of our country and Is in
troducing species specially adapted to semi-arid
regions. Forest tires, which seriously interfere
with production, especially in Irrigated regions,
are being studied, that the losses from this
cause may be avoided. The department is in
quiring into the use und abuse of water In many
states of tbe west and collecting Information
regarding the laws of the states, the decisions
of the courts and the customs of tbe people
in this regard, so that uniformity may be se
cured. Experiment stations arc becoming more
effective every year. The annual appcoprlution
of $720,000 by congress is supplemented by
$400,000 .from the states. Nation-wide experi
ments have been conducted to ascertain the suit
ableness us to soil mid climate ami states for
growing sugar beets. The number of sugar fac
tories has been doubled In the lust two years
and the ability of the-United States to produce
Its own sugar from this source has been clearly
demonstrated. Tbe weather bureau forecast and
observation stations have neen extended around
the Caribbean Sea to give early warning of tha
approach of hurricanes from the south seas to
our fleets and merchant murine.
Government Lands Disposed Of.
"The public lands disposed of by the govern
ment during the year reached 8,453,S9U.92 acres,
an Increase of 014,780.20 acres over the previous
year. The total receipts from public lauds dur
ing the fiscal year amounted to $2,277,995.18,
au increase of $190,063.00 over the preceding
year. The lands embraced in tbe eleven forest
reservations which were suspended by the act
of June 4. 1897, again became subject to the
operations of the proclamattous of Feb. 22, 1807,
creating them, wblch added an estimated
amount of $19,951,360 acres to the area embrac
ed In tbe reserves previously created. In ad
dition thereto two new reserves were created
during the year—tbe Pine Mountain and Zaca
Lake reserve In California, embracing 1.044,594
acres, aud the Prcscott reserve In Arizona, em
bracing 10,240 acres: while the l'ecos ltlver re
serve In New Mexico has been changed and
enlarged to Include 120.000 additional acres. At
the close of tbe year thirty forest reservations,
not Including those of the Afognac forest and
the dsh culture reserve in Alaska, had been
created by executive proclamations, under sec
tion 24 of tbe net of March 8. 1891. embracing
an estimated area of 40.719,474 acres. The de
partment of the iuterior has Inaugurated a
forest system, made possible by tiie act of
July, 189S, for a graded force of officers in ••on
trol of the reserves. This system hns only
been in full operation since August, but good
results have already been sectft-ed in many sec
tions. The reports received Indicate that the
system of patrol has not only prevented destruc
tive Arcs from gaining headway, but lias dimin
ished the number of fires. The special atten
tion of the congress Is called to that part ot
the report of the secretary of the interior In re
lation to tbe Ave eivilissed tribes. It Is note
worthy that the general condition of the In
dians shows marked progress. Bat one out
break of a serious character occurred during
the year,, and that among the Chippewa Indians
of Minuesotay wbleb happily has been sup
pressed.
Centennial Anniversary ot Washington
City.
"rn the year 1900 will occur the centennial
unulversnry of the founding, of the-City of Wash
lngton for the permanent capital of the gov
eminent of the United States by authority of an
act of congress appro ml July 16, 1790. In May,
1S00. the archives and general, offices of the
federal government were removed to this place.
On the 17th of November. 1SOO( the national:
congress met here for the first time and as
sumed exclusive control, of the federal dis
trict and city. This interesting, event as
sumes all the more significance when we recall
the circumstances attending the choosing of the
site, the namiug of the capital In honor of
the father of bis country and the interest tuken
by him in tho adoption of plans-for Its-future
development on a magnificent swale. These
original plans have been wrought out with
a constant progress and a signal success even'
beyond anything their framers could have fore
seen. The people of tbo country are justly
proud of the distinctive beauty and government
of the capital and of tJie rare instruments of
science and education wblch here And their
natural home. A movement, lately Inaugurated

tion, has met with- general' favor on the payt
of the public. I recommend to the congress
tbe granting of nn appropriation for this pur
pose and the appointment of a committee from,
its respective Indies. It might also, be advisable
to authorize the president to appoint a com.
mittee from the country at large,, which, nctlng
with tbe congressional aud District of Colum

LI Bnn« Chang's. Portrait.
It is rather amusing to remember
that the most successful portrait of LI
Hung Chang is the work of an English
lady, Miss Mortlock, who has had the
honor of painting almost every am
bassador accredited to- the court of St.
James. The Chinese envoy was very
much flattered at being asked to sit to
an English lady, and he proved a very
pleasant and cultivated sitter, although
he overwhelmed the fair artist with
questions, as, indeed, he did everyone,
including the only lady journalist who
had the courage to interviw him. What
puzled Li most was the large number
of single women in England, and the
first question he put to every lady to
whom he was presented invariably
concerned her matrimonial intentions.
L1 Hung Chang's wife was, in her day,
a very noted Chinese belle, and possess
ed over 1,000 gowns, many of them of
Parisan manufacture.
Postal Card Collection.
In England and on the Continent coir
lections of souvenir postal cards are
the popular fad. Cancelled cards only
are wanted, and it, has been a difficult
matter for many collectors who have
correspondents all over the world to
have the desired postal card3 sent to
them from the places they represent.
A clever Hamburg dealer has taken ad
vantage of the situation, and has made
arrangements to have the cards mailed
to any address from a list of almost
100 cities scattered throughout tlie five
continents. He performs this service
for a small fee in addition to the
amount of postage involved, and, it is
said, is doing a large business in the
new departure.

when I present the bill."
