FOUH BATTLESHIPS
NOW IN DEMAND
MADE BY SECRETARY METCALF
IN HIS LAST ANNUAL
REPORT.
Washington, Dec. 12. —Secretary
Metcalf, of the navy d<. partment, In
his annual report recommended that
congress authorize the coniitruction
of four battleships, 4 scout cruisers,
ten destroyers, four submarinethrte
colliers, one repair ship, one ammuni
tion ship, two mine-laying ships—
these two ship; to be converted from
cruisers now on the navy list.
Marksmanship, he ;-ays, has im
proved on the practice crut-e around
the world. With respect to the as
sertion that our 12-inch guns are in
ferior to those of other powers, the
facts are found to be that the actual
imizzle energy of these 12-inch guns,
which form the main armament of
our eight latest battleships in com
mission, is somewhat greater than
that of any gun afloat in any other
navy. .
It is desirable, the secretary states,
to lengthen the dry dock authorized
by congress to be constructed at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from 850 to
1,140 feet, to render it capable of ac
commodating two or more vessel; at
once. Secretary Metcalf recom
mends that the navyyards at New
York. Philadelphia, Norfolk. Puget
sound, and Mare island be developed
to their full capacity for the repair
and maintenance of ships, but says it
is not further desirable to develop
other navyyards, at least until that at
Guantanamo shall have been equipped,
the last named station being regarded
as of the fir. t military importance and
as a natural startegic base. It is
deemed highly desirable to acquire
by purcha e or to construct a dock in
San Francisco harbor.

TRADE SCHOOLS
RECEIVING TEST
EXPERIMENTS OF GENERAL IN
TEREST PROGRESSING IN
EMPIRE STATE.
EDUCATORS VIEW TRAINING OF
THE HAND AS ADVANCE
STEP.
Industrial training is engrossing the
attention of educators throuhgout the
country. In New York experiments
are being conducted under all conceiv
able conditions, and the results will
be interesting to educators and the
general public. This activity marks a
great awakenng in education.
Recently the New York state gov
ernment published an elaborate plan
for establishing a system of trade;
schools. The plan provides for the*
training of workmen in craftsman
ship through the organization of two'
classes of schools; factory schools,
which train for work in factories,
where there are many employes who
work with much machinery, and trade
schools, .which train for the construc
tive trades, in w r hich the work is es
sentially ind.vidual and independent
of machines. To encourage the or
ganization of such schools the slate
wall appropriate SSOO for each of said
schools with not less than twenty
five pupils, maintained for the mini
mum period of forty w r eeks in one
shcool year and ah additional S2OO
for each teacher employed in such
school year for the same period.
The committee of ten appointed by
the national society for the promotion
of industrial education to devise an
adequate arrangement of trade
schools to become a co-ordinate pait
of the present public school system,
has been actively studying conditions.
The committee feels that industrial
training should be started as soon as
the children are able to hold tools in
the t hands, say about the age of 9.
Besides this, the committee thinks
there should be free industrial high
schools at night for the further in
struction of boys who have been
graduated from the elementary
schools.
The opening this fall of the S'tuy
vesannt evening trade school —a mil
lion and half dollar institution —was
hailed as a decided step forward in
industrial training. More than eight
hundred students were enroleld and
many were placed on a long waiting'
list. Instruction is given in car
pentry and joinery, cabinet making,
pattern making, blacksmithing !
plumbing, machine shop work, pr nt
ing and typesetting mathematics,
free hand, architectural and mechani
cal drawing, machine design, applied
electricity, steam engineering, electric;
chemistry and applied physics. Cer
tificates of proficiency will be awarded
in each course.
CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY.
“
Washington, Dec. B.—The business
of both houses was confined largely
to listening to the reading of the
president's message. A resolution
was introduced in (he senate by Mr.
Knox providing for the appointment
of three representatives to make nec
essary arrangements for the inaugu
ration of President-elect Taft. The
resolution was adopted. The miscel
| laneous work of the senate consisted
i in the mai*i of reference in executive
session of about 1,500 recess nomi
nations. wl ich were sent to the sen
ate by the president. Speaker Can-
non announced the appointment of
Higgins of Connecticut to the com
mittee on judiciary in I lace of Little
field retired, and of dartin to the
committee on Indian af.airs in place
of Barker, deceased. Several import
ant amendments to the Hepburn rail
road rate law were proposed in bills
introduced by Congressman Townsend
of Michigan, ore of the most active
advocates of remedial legislation
along interstate commerce lines.
One of the bills gives the interstate
commerce commission power to pro
hibit the taking effect of an advance
in rates in a case in which shippers
individually or collectively protest
against the advance prior to the ex
piration of the legal thirty days’ nc
tice. The bill places the burden on
the carrier to show at a subsequent
hearing on the prop ised rate that the!
increased rate is just and reasonable.t
Mr. Townsend would also give the
shippers the right and privilege of
routing and prescribing what connect
ing lines a shipment shall take.
An emergency volunteer army mea
sure was advocated by Presidsent
Roosevelt in a special message to
congress and a draft of the bill ac
companying the message was intro
duced in the senate by Senator Cul
lom. The president says the bill is
intended to replace the present law
which he declares is faulty and
wholly inadequate to a speedy and
proper organization of a volunteer
force. The proposed bill is elastic;
under its provisions a force of 2 000.-
000 men could be raised as well as
one of 50,000.
Washington. Dec. 9. —A far reach
ing bill for the regulation erf future
'ssues of securities by transportation
companies and telegraph and tele
phone companies engaged in inter
state commerce, was introduced in
the senate by Mr. Deliver, one of
the authors of the railroad rate law.
It is said that the measure represents
the administration view of the sub-!
ject. It is intended to prevent future i
over-capitalization. stock-watering.;
bond manipulation, and all similar
abuses. The bills, numbering 352,
were chiefly for granting pensions.
The house got down to the actual
work of legislation by resuming con
sideration of the bill to provide for
the thirteenth and subsequent decen
nal censuses which had been parti
ally discussed at the last session.
Consideration of the bill led to a dis
cussion of the civil service. This
came up on an amendment offered by
Mr. Gillett of Massachusetts the ef
fect of which would he to exclude
from noncompetitive examination, re
qirred as a basis of appointment,
messengers, asssistant messengers,
messenger boys, watchmen, skilled la
borers and charwomen. During the
discussion. Representative Crumpack
er of Indiana defended the present
system and declared that the civil
serv ce reform associations did not
know what they were talking about
when they wanted temporary census
clerks appointed in the regular way.
Mr. Hepburn of lowa said that in
his judgment the census bill and its
provisions “are a fair representation
of the pretenses of our civil service.
He declared that the civil service
had effected no improvement, and I
said that men he had had appointed]
25 years ago were today better clerks
than those the civil service commis
sion was providing. Ihe amendment
was lost G 5 to 119 and the bill was
passed practically unchanged. A bill
providing for a tariff commission of
seven members to fix rates of duties
on all imports, was introduced in the
house yesterday by Congressman Fow
ler of New Jersey. It provides that
congress shall fix maximum and mini
mum tariff schedules and the rates
which the commission would fix would
bo within these limits. The commis
sion would be required to Investigate
all questions of federal taxation af
fecting imports and foreign trade, to
collect information with regard to
manufacturers and commerce, and to
recommend reciprocal trade treaties.
Each member of the commission
would be selected to serve for a term
of 14 years.
Senator La Follette reintroduced
his bill to safeguard the disposal of
mineral lands, especially coal lands.
Wa hington, D. C., Dec. 10 The
senate held a short session during
which an agreement was reached for
taking up the omnibus claims bil.
Monday with the undt rstanding that
it shall not interfere with the con
sideration of the postal savings bill or
any other measure' in which senators
are especially ir/tr rested. Senator
Lodge gave notice that he would on
next Wednesday speak ort the Browns
ville bill to authorize the re-enlistment
of the soldiers of the twenty-fifth
regiment, discharged without honor
by the president.
At no time was there even a sembl
ance of a quorum in the house. Soon
after convening tiro legislative appro
priation bill was presented and sever
al bill e were passed, among them one
authorizing the removal of the imposi
tion of the loss of citizenship upon and
sorters in the military and naval rerv
vice. The balance of (he day was
taken up in discus' .ing tlie bill to pro
vide for rbitrary investigation of dif
ficulties between employers and em
ployes. Its consideration was not
concluded.

sioner general of immigration was
reached in the house. Congressman Ma
con of Arkansas, made a point of or
der against it and the increase was
allowed. Mr. Fitzgerald of New
York, while the question was up, crit
icised the appointment of Daniel
Keefe to be commissioner general, re
marking that he had no sympathy
with what he said was a ‘ movement
to pay political debts in this manner.
There was a lot of hypocrisy,” he
said, “about the whole business.”
Washington, Dec. V 2 the house
a wrangle occurred on a resolution
fixing the boundary line between Colo
rado, Oklahoma and New Mexico,
which was adopted by a good ma
jority, but not without two roll calls.
The house, by a decisive vote, refused
to further consider the bill providing
for the arbitrary .settlement of dis
putes between employers and em
ployes. The question of state’s rights
figured prominently in the debate on
a bill providing for the protection of
aliens in the Unite*- States, in accoid
ance with treaties entered into with
foreign powers. The bill 1; designed
to relieve the United States from
what was stated on tie floor by Con
gressman Sherley of Kentucky to be
an “embarrassing and often humidi
tating position arising from its inabil
ity to make good the obligation < of its
treaties for the protection of for
eigners in this country.’’ Opponents
of the measure practically were a unit
<n contending that the laws of the
states were able to meet the situa
tion whenever it presented itself. Af
ter a lengthy di cussion the bill
passed 101 to 100.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 14. —Vice
President Fairbanks laid before the
senate the resolutions adopted by the
national river and harbors congress
asking for an issue of bonds to the
amount of 1500,000,000 for the im
provement of water highways. The
Brownsvi.le affair consumed nearly
the entire ses.-ion of the senate. Sen
ator Foraker reacTTetters from a form
er soldier of the 25th regiment telling
of the procedure of the government
in attempts to get a confession from
him. .Mr. Foraker introduced an
amendment to his original bill for the
reenlistment of these soldiers, provid-
ing that commission of three retired
army officers be created to determine
whether the discharged soldiers are
innocent of complicity in the shooting
up of Brownsvi.le a; a pre-requisite
'or their reenlistmenT instead of leav
ing that duty with the president as
provided by the Warner bill. The
president’s message giving the re
sults of the war department's investi
gation of the Brownsville affair was
read and -Mr. Foraker commented up
on the message. Setting aside Feb
ary 12th next by both branches of
congress for the centennial observa
tion of Lincoln*; birfnday is proposed
In a concurrent Resolution introduced
by Senator Dick of Ohio. It is fur
ther proposed that it be recommended
that Americans evervwhere remember
the day. The action is ifiso favored
ooking toward the erection of an ade
quate memorial to the great war presi
dent.
The house passed a measure pro
viding for 85 cent gas in Washington.
Hie bill now goes to the senate, as
well as another bill abolishing bucket
s hops in the district. An attempt by
Representative Henry of Texas to ob
tain a change in reference to a bill
prohibiting the making of future con
tracts on agricultural product <
brought forth a promise from Chair
man bcott of the agricultural com
mittee, that his committee would
soon grant a hearing to the
farmers' union and others on this
subject.
The house voted to adjourn on De
cember 19 to January 4.
ADVANTAGES Of
EOREST RESERVES
WATERPOWERS PRODUCED. NAVI
GATION AIDED AND TIMBER
CONSERVED.
Washington, Dec. 14.—A special ap
peal for a torest reserve in the south
era Appalachian region was made be
fore the commercial congress h\ tin
ford Piuchot, chief forester of ih •
I tilled States, lie declared that tin
southern Appalachians furnish th
source waters of a number of import
tint river systems, which afford the
possibilities of immense power pro
duction. The geological survey finds
that these streams will produce a
minimum of 2,700,000 horsepower, or,
taking as the basis of the six high
water mouths, nearly five million
horsepower. At least half of this
can be developed at a profit. At S2O
per horsepower per annum would be
worth to southern Industrie? $38.-
000 000 a year. Probably less than a
half million is developed as yet.
Water power to the value of S3B 000,000
a year actually used would give
the south a tremendous Impetus,
not alone iu manufacturing, but in
transportation, in lighting, and in de
velopment of every kind. Water
power is valuable even where coal is
cheapest, but it is most valuable to
those sections which have no deposits
of coal, and its advantages will
increase as the supply of coal grows
scarcer and the price higher.
All the waters gathered in the
southern Appalachians How to (he
sea through navigable channels. The
heavy rainfall and the sleep slopes
lead to a very rapid run off. Fur
then ore there ate no natural lakes
for storage. If (he flow were uni
form the amount of water discharged
by these streams is sufficient to
make (heir imporlar.ee for navigation
very high. Hut the run off is vari
able. Moreover, the variability is in
ereasing.
Every one of the .southern Appala
chian streams shows that Hoods are
more frequent and of greater dura
tion since the watersheds have been
heavily cut and severely burned.
Excessive low waters too are increas
ing in length and frequency. The
forest was the only natural influence
which tended to equalize the flow.
Even on steep slopes the forests
served (he purpose of changing (he
water from service to underground
drainage. When the forest is cut
away the water instead of being ah
soibed is thrown off into streams in
floods. With the rush of water down
the slopes the soil is rapidly carried
away. The gullied condition of the
mountain fields is a familiar one.
The soil which nature put upon those
fields has been washed away and it
becomes more and more difficult to
keep the lower courses of the streams
open for navigation.
The Appalachians are of profound
commercial importance for timber
supply, w ate power and navigation
and there is a close Interdependence
between the three. The waterpowers
cannot be fully utilized nor can the
streams be employed for navigation un
less those lands which are kept in
tillage are handled so that the soil is
not washed away. To make the most
of the region is therefore a problem
of engineering, of agriculture and of
forestry, and it concerns all classes
of our people —(he manufacturer,
the farmers and the railroads. How
ever you look at it the Appalachian
and White mountain hill is a good
proposition.*' said Mr. Pinched.
MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE.
Handcuffed to Fellow Prisoner Dis
appears at Door of Court.
San Francisco, Dec. 13.—Charle F
Rust, arrested two months ago in
Grand Rapids, Mich , and brought here
to answer to a charge of embezzle
ment, escaped from custody at the
very door of the court room and has
not yet been recaptured. Handcuffed
to another prisoner ami with 11 more
in the prison van, tie 1.3 known to
have reached the entrance of the build
ing in which the court was being
held. Suddenly the handcuff swung
loosely on the wrist of his fellow
prisoner and Rust was among the
missing.
Operation Restores Speech.
Racine, Wls., Dec. 10. —At the St.
Luke’s hospital an operation was per
formed upon the jaw of Frank Chris
tiansen, a bicycle dealer, which re
stored his speech. Eleven years ago
Christiansen was struck In the mouth
by a rifle ball, the force of the bullet
imbedding one of the teeth in the jaw.
Fn wuccessful attempts were made to
n move the bullet and tooth. On ac
count of the wound the speech of
Christiansen was impaired. It became
worse and the man submitted to an
X-ray examination and the operation
was decided upon.
