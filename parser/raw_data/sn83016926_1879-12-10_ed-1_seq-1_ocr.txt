Letter from Col. James.
New Orleans, Nov. 24, 1879.
Hon. Ai.fkeo E. Lewis:
1H:au Sir I notice in the Democrat-Star
of the Hist inst., a call for a public meeting
composed of citizens of the three seaboard
counties of your State, to be held at Scran
ton, on Thursday, the 27th inst., to take
into consideration such action a will effec
tually prevent in the future the maiming
and killing of stock by the New Orleans and
Mobile Railroad. This evil, now for the
first time sought to be remedied, by the or
ganized action of the people of the counties
bordering on the seashore, has continued
uninterruptedly, for about eight years, the
sufferer being denied legal redress for their
losses, bv reason of the notorious insol
vency of the railroad corporation. Mort
gage ujioii mortgage being inscribed against
them, both in Mississippi and Louisiana,
"J'elion on 0a piled.'"
In view of thi state of facts, it behooves
the good people who have already been de
spoiled' of their property by the railroad, as
well a those who at any moment are liable
to have their stock destroyed in like man
ner, to seek that redress, through legislative
action, denied to them legally by reason of
the insolvency of the Company.
In all other communities, north and west
of us and particularly iu those States grid
ironed by railroads, there are stringent en
act nients requiring and compelling the com
panies throughout their jurisdiction to keep
the entire line of their road fenced on either
side. The legislature of Mississippi will
meet soon, and the present is an opportune
Moment to petition that body to enact such
stringent laws as will have the effect of ac
complishing the end in view. A petition
numerou.ly and respectably signed by the
good people of your seaboard counties,
asking such relief at the hands of the Leg
islature, canuot fail U be favorably received
by that body.
You have able men in your BepresenU
tives from the three counties bordering on
the Gulf, and which the Jff. O. & M. K.
runs through, and they will doubtless give
it their attention. Your friend,
B. V. James.

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Extract Relating to the Cnrrenry
Elections Ciril Service Reform
, The Jettiea.
Fkllow-C'itizkxs of the Senate
ask House of Representative?
The member of the Portv-sixth Oontrress
have assembled at thei first regular session
under circumstances calling for mutual
congratulation ami grateful acknowledg
nient to the Giver of all good for the larje
and unusual measure of national prosperity
which we now enjoy. The most interesting
events which have occurred in our public
affair since my last annual message to
Congress are connected with the financial
oeration of the Government, directly
affecting the business interest of the coun
try. I congratulate Congress on the suc
cessful execution of the Resumption Act.
At the time fixed, and in the manner
contemplated by law. United States notes
began to be redeemed in coin. Since the
1st of January last they have been promptly
redeemed on presentation, and iti all
business transaction., public and private in
all parts of the country, they are received
and p:i:d as the equivalent of coin. The
demand ujon the Treasury for gold and
silver in exchange for United States notes
lias been comparatively small, and the
voluntary dejNjsit of coin and bullion in
exchange for note ha been very large. The
excess of the preciou metal deposited or
exchanged for United States notes over the
amount of United State notes redeemed i
aliout $4'), 00(1,001).
THE UKr-fMPTIliN OF SPECIE PAYMENTS
ha been foUowed by a great revival of busi
ness. With a currency equivalent in value
to the money of the commercial world, we
are enabled to enter upon an equal compe
tition with other nation in trade and
production. The increasing foreign demand
for our manufacture and agrienltual pro
ducts has caused a large balance of trade in
our favor, which has been paid in gold, from
the lit of .Inly last to November lr, to the
amount of about S"0,000,Ooo. Since the
resumption of specie payment there has
also lnen a marked and gratifying improve
ment in the public credit.
The binds of the Government bearing
onlv four ier cent, interest have been sold
at about par, sufficient in amount to pay
oil' all of the national debt which was re
definable under present laws. The amount
of interest saved annually by the process of
refunding the debt since March 1, H77, i
$1 1,7, 177. The bond soWl were largely in
small sums, and the number of our citizens
now holding the public securities i much
greater than ever before. The amount of
the National debt which mat tires within less
than two years is tT'.Ci, !:M ,700, of which
$501 ,IOO70o0 bear interest at the rate of fi ve
K-rceiit., and the balaneei in bond bearing
six percent interest. It is believed that
this part of the public debt can be refunded
by the issue of four per cent, bonds, and by
the reduction of interest which will thus
be elteeted about ?1 1, oho, uhii can be annu
ally saved to the treasury. To secure this
important reduction of interest to be paid
by the United States, further legislation is
required, which, it is hoped, will be pro
vided by Congress during it present
session.
the coinage of
OObU
bv the mints of the United States during
the last fiscal year was $40,9Sb,!12. The
coinage of silver dollars since the passage of
the act for that purpose up to Novemlier 1,
1S7!, wa $15,000,850, of which $1 2,700,3 14
j have been issueil from the Treasury, anu
are now in circulation, anu 4i,,ioO,0UO are
still in the possession of the Government.
The pendency of the projiosition for unity of
action lx-tween the United State i and the
principal commercial nation of Kurojie to
ctlect a ermanent system for the equality
of gold ami silver in the recognized money
of the world, lead me to recommend that
Congress refrain from new legislation on the
general subject.
THE (i It EAT REVIVAL OF TRADE,
internal and foreign, will supply during the
coining vcar its own instructions, which may
I wen tie awaueu ueiore attempting iuriuer
' experimental measures with the coinage. I
would, however, strongly urge upon Con
gress the importance of authorizing the Sec
retary of the Treasury to suspend the coin
age of silver dollar upon the present legal
ratio. The market value of the silver dollar
being uuiforinly and largely less than the
market value of the gold dollar, it i obvi-
usly impracticable to maintain them at
par wiiu eacn oiner n ooiu are coineu wun
out limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into
circulation, it will, if coined without limit,
sixiii lecome the sole standard of value, and
thus defeat the desired object which isacur
rency of loth gold and silver, which shall be
of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with
the universally recognized money of the
world. The retirement from circulation of
United States note with the capacity of
legal tender in private contracts i a step to
lie taken in our progress toward a safe and
staple currency, which should be accepted as
the policy and duty of theGovernment, ami
the interest and seeuiity of the people. It
i my firm conviction that the issue of
LEGAL-TEN DER PAPER MONEY,
based wholly upon the authority and credit
of the Government, except in extreme
emergency, i without warrant in the Con
stitution, and a violation of sound financial
principle. Thi issue of United States
notes during the late civil war, with the
capacity of legaUtender between private in
dividual., was not authorized except a a
mean of rescuing the country from immi
nent peril. The circulation of these notes
as paper money for anv protracted period of
time after the accomplishment of thi pur
pose was not contemplated by the framers
of the law under which they were issued.
They anticipated the redemption and with
drawal of these note at the earliest practi
cable period consistent with the attainment
of the object for which they were provided.
The iiolicv of the Linked States, steadily
Ihered to from the adoption of the Consti-
tutioii, ha been to avoid the creation ol a
national debt, and when from necessity, in
time of war, debts have been created, they
have been paid off on the return of peace
a rapidly as possible, With thi view,
and for "this purpose, it i recommended
that the existing law for the accumulation
of a Sinking Fuud sufficient to extinguish
the public debt within a limited period be
maintained. If any change of the objects
or rates of taxation i deemed necesary by
Congress, it is suggested that experience
has shown that a duty can be placed on
tea and coffee which will not enhance the
price of those articles to the consumer, and
which will add several millions of dollars
annually to the Treasury.
THE ELECTIONS
of the past year, though occupied only with
State omces, nave not laueu to eucit iu vue
nolitieal discussions which attend them all
over the country, new and decisive evidence
of the deep interest which the great body of
citizens taKe in the progress ot tne country
toward a more general and complete estab
lishment, at whatever cost, of universal
tuuMiritv and freedom in the exercise of the
elective franchise. While many topics of
political concern demand great attention
from our people, both in the sphere of Na
tional and State authority, I find no reason
to qualify the opinion expressed in my
last annual message that no temporary or
administrative interest of government, how
ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace
the leal of our people in defence of the
primary rights of citizensnip. And that the
power of public opinion will override all
political prejudices and all sectional and
State attachments. In demanding that all
over our wide territory the name and char
acter of citizen of the United States shall
mean one and the same thing, and carry with
Khem unchallenged security and respect, I
earnestly appeal to the intelligence ana pa
triotism of all good citizens of every part of
the country, however much they may be
divided in opinions on other political sub?
jects, to unite in compelling obedjence o
existing laws-aimed at the protection of he
right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon
Congress to supply any defects in the laws
which experience has shown and which it is
within its power to remedy. I again invoke
the co-operation of the Executive and legis
lative authorities of the States in this great
purpose, f am fully convinced that jf fhe
public mind can be set at rest on the para
mount question of popularjrights BO.aerjam
obstacle wilHb wart or delay the coropleta
pacification of the country, or retard the
general diffusion of prosperity. -
In a former message I invited the atten
tion ot Congress to the subject of the refor
mation if the s --
crvit' Slavics
gftVwccci.t.fisJ Ctrrfss?! tba In
tention of transmitting to Congress as early
a practicable a report upn this subject by
the Chairman of the Civil Service Commis
sion. i - ...
I in view oi tne lacu ttiat, during a con-
j siderable period, the Government of Great
! Rritain ha been dealing with adruinistra
i tive problems and abuses, in various tar-
j ticular3 analogous to those presented in this
I country, and that in recent years the
i measure adopted were understood to have
! been effective, and in everv respect highly
S satisfactory, 1 thought it desirable to have
j fuller information uon the subject, and
accordingly requested the Chairman of the
Civil Service Commission to make a
' thorough investigation for thi purpose,
j The result lias been an elaborate and com
prehensive rejxirt. The report set forth
I the history of" the partizan spoils svstem in
Great Rritiau and of the rise and fall of the
parliamentary patronage and official inter
ference with the freedom of elections. It
shows that after long trials of various kind
of examination, those which arecompetitive
and open on equal term to all, and which
are carried on under the superintendence of
a single commission, have with great advan
tage been established ascondilionsof admis
sion to almost every official place in the
subordinate administration of that country
and of British India. The completion of
the nqiort, owing to the extent of the labor
involved in its preparation, and the omis
sion of Congress to make any provision
either for the compensation or the expense
of the commission, ha been postponed
until the piescnt time. It i herewith
transmitted to Congress. While the reform
measures of another Government are of no
authority to us, they :re entitled to influ
ence to the extent to which their intrinsic
wisdom and their adaptation to our insti
tutions anil social life may commend them
to our consideration. The views I have
heretofore expressed concerning the
I HI FELTS AND AH LSI-
in our civil administration remain un
changed, except in so far as an enlarged
experience ha deejiened my sense of the
duty, both of officers and of the people
themselves, to co-operate tor their removal.
The giave evils and perils of a partisan
spoils system of appointment to office, and
of office tenure, are now generally recog
nized. In the resolution of the great
parties, in the report of Department., in
the debates and proceedings of Congress, in
the messages of Executives, the gravity of
the evil has been pointed out, and the need
of their reform has been admitted. To
command tne necessary supixirt. every
measure of reform must be based on com
mon right and justice and must be compati
ble with the healthy existence of great
parties, which are inevitable ami essential
in a free State. When the jieople have
approved a policy at a national election,
confidence on the part of the otlieers they
have selected, and of the advisers who, in
accoi dance with our jolitieal institutions
should le consulted in the policy which it
is their duty to carry into effect, i indis
pensable, ft i eminently proper that they
should explain it before the people, as well
a illustrate it spirit in the performance of
their official duties. It hardly need be
pointed out that very dillerent considerations
apply to the greater number of those who
fill the subordinate places in the civil
service. Their resjwnsibility i to their
superiors iu official jiosition. It is their
duty to obey the legal instruction of those
upon whom that authority is devolved, and
their best public service consists in the dis
charge of their functions irresjiective of par
tisan politics. Their duties are the same
whatever party is in power, whatever policy
prevails. As a consequence, it follows that
their tenure of office should not depend on
the prevalence of any policy or the suprem
acy of any party, but should be determined
by their capacity to serve the people most
usefully, quite irrespective of partisan
interests.
THE JETTIES.
The Secretary of War further reports that
the work, foi the improvement of the South
l'ass of the Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Lads, made in pursu
ance of an net. of Congress, has been prose
cuted during the past year with a greater
measure ot success in the attainment ot re
sult than during any previous year. The
channel through the South Pass, which at
the beginning of operations (in June, 1875)
had a depth of only seven and one-half feet
of water, had on the 8th of July, 187'J, a
mini mum depth of twenty-six feet, having
a width of not less than two hundred feet,
and a central depth of thiity feet. Pay
ment have been made in accordances with
the statute as the work progressed, amount
ing in the aggregate to $4,250,000, and fur
ther paymeuts will become due a provided
by the statute in the event of success in
maintaining the channel now secured.
The appropriation for judicial expenses,
which has heretofore been made for
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
in gross, was subdivided at the last session
of Congress, and no appropriation whatever
was made for the payment of the fees of
Marshals and their Deputies, either in the
service of process or for the discharge of
other duties; and since June 3, these officers
have continued the perfoimance of their
dutie without compensation from the Gov
ernment, taking upon themselves the neces
sary incidental outlay as well rendering their
own services. In only a few unavoidable
instances ha the proper execution of the
process of the U"Uod States failed by reason
of the absence of the requisite appropriation.
Thi course of official conduct on the part of
these otficers.Jhighly.creditable to their fidel
ity was advised by the Attorney General,
yvho informed them however that they would
necessarily have to rely for their compensa
tion on the prospect of future legislation by
Congre,. I therefore especially recommend
that immediate appropriation be made by
Congress for the purpose. The act making
the principal appropriation, for the Depart
ment of Justice at previous sessions has
uniformly contained the following claus
es: "And for defraying the expenses which
may be incurred in the enforcement of the
act approved February 20, 1870, entitled an
act to amend an act approved May 30, 1870,
entitled an act to enforce the right of citi
zens of the United States to vote iu the
several States of the United State, and for
other purposes, or any act amendatory
thereof or supplementary thereto." No
appropriation was made for this purpose for
the current year. As no general election
for member of Congress occurred, the omis
sion wasfa matter of little practical impor
tance. Such election will, however, take
place during the ensuing year, and the ap
propriations for the pay of Marshals and
deputies should be sufficient to .embiace
compensation for the services they may be
required to perform at such elections.
THE BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT
is at present largely in arrears. It can not
be expected that more cases can be decided
than are now disposed of in its annual ses
sion, or that by any assiduity the distin
guished Magistrate who compose the court
can accomplish more than is now done. In
the courts of many of the circuits, also, the
business has increased to such an extent
that the delay of justice will call the atten
tion of Congress to an appropriate remedy.
Jt is believed that all is done in each cir
cuit which car) fairry be expected from its
judicial force. The evils arising from delay
are less heavily felt by the United States
than by private suitors, as its causes are
advanced by the courts when it is seen that
they involve the discussion ot questions of
a public character. The remedy suggested
by the Attorney General is the appointment
of additional Circuit Judges and the crea
tion of an intermediate Court of Errors and
Appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme
Court of a part of iti jurisdiction, while a
larger force is also obtained for the perform
ance of circuit duties. I commend this
suggestion to the consideration of Congress.
It would seem to afford a complete remedy,
and would involve, if ten additional ' Cir
cuit Judges are appointed, an expenditure
at the present rate of salaries of not more
shan f $0,QQQ a year, which would certainly
be small in comparison with the objects to
be attained.
THE TIMBER DEPREDATIONS,
The efforts made by the Department of
the Interior to arrest tne depredations on
the timber lands of the United States have
been continued, and have met with consid
erable success, A large number of cases of
trespassers nave been presented in tne courts
of tne United State. Others have been
settled, the traspassers ofJL-ring to make
payment to the Government for the value
of the timber tskeu by th ;ro. The proceeds

pose. A more important result, however,
consist in the fact that the destruction of
our public forests by depredations, though
such cases still occur, has been jrreatly re
duced in extent; and it is probable that if
the present policy is vigorously pursued,
and sufficient provision to that end is made
by Congress, such trespasses, at leas those
on a large scale, can be entirely suppressed,
except in the Territories where timber for
the daily requirements of the population
can not under the present state of the law,
be otherwise obtained. I, therefore, earn
estly invite the attention of Congress to
the recommendation made by the Secre
tary of the Interior that' a law be
enacted enabling the Government to
sell timber from the public land with
out conveying the fee, where such lands
are principally valuable for the timber
thereon, such sales to be so regulated as to
conform to domestic wants and business re
quirements, while at the same time guard
ing against a sweeping destruction of the
forests. The enactment of such a law ap-
e.irs to become a more pressing necessity
every day.

And now, a she looks back on the two-

several years every bishop and every judge
whom she found seated on those benches in
England, Scotland and Ireland. She has wit

From the Drawer of Ilarper's for Decern-;
ber.
This touching story was told by East
man Johnson to our correspondent ip
Nantucket : Qn a narrow island near
the New England coast, where primi
tive customs still obtain, where the
crier goes about the streets by day and
the watchman by night, where they
dispose of surplus meat by auction, and
the merry maiden and the tar go junket
ing together in an ancient calash, lives
an old lady, Auntie B . The same
roof lias sheltered three generations of
her family, and. it wqulil require little
less than an earthquake to dislodge her
from her seat by the old-fashioned fire
place. There she sits a picture of peace
and contentment.
"Haven't you a single regret in your
whole life ?" we asked her once. She
dropped her knitting, and a dreamy
look crept over her placid eyes.
"Yes," she said at length, "I have.
Ten years ago, when my dear dead sis
tor was alive, a man with a hand-organ
came to this island by the steamer.
Oh ! he could play beautifully. He
came near our street, and my sister
says to me, 'Let us go down to the
corner and see him play.' Well, do you
know, I didn't go, after all, but she said
it was just splendid, and I suppose I
shall regret not hearing that hand-organ
to my dying day."
And the dear old soul dropped a tear
on the half-heeled stocking.
At a trial of a criminal case, the
prisoner entered a plea of "not guilty,"
when one of the jurymen put on his
hat and started for the door. The
Judge called him back and informed
him that he could not leave until the
case was tried. "Tried ?" queried the
juror. "Why, he acknowledges, that he
is not guilty H
A prominent Attorney, while fishing

"Why?" asked his companion. "Be

in my basket directly under that
board."

And hard tempests, strong and thick;

That year is good for lands to till,

If a child born that day shall be.

Of deed he shall be good and stable,
Wise of speech and reasonable.
Whoso that day goes thieving about.
He shall be punished without doubt.
And if sickness thai day betide.
It shall quickly from tbee glide.
MY HERO-
"Aunt," said Jennie Gordon, seating
herself at the feet ot the lovliest maiden
of sixty who was ever called an old maid,
"what did papa mean this morning when
he said if you had not been so faithfully
faithless you niight have been a widow
with a hundred thousand, instead of an
old maid teaching little cirls music?"
Maria Gordon smiled, but her lips
quivered, too.
"All girls like love stories, she said;
"shall I tell you mine?"
Jeunie assented, clasping her little
white hands upon her aunt's lap, and
resting her chin upon them, her favorite
attitude for listening comfortably.
"Forty years aijo," began Maria, and
smiled again at Jennie's little gasping,
"Oh! at the immense space of time
"Forty years ago, Jennie, I was a
blooming, pretty girl of nineteen, as ro
mantic and tender-hearted as most girls
of mv aire. I lived then in Summerfield,
upon the same farm where you go now
to visit your uncle Reuben. It was a
very small village in those days, and
the only way to reach the city was by a
ten hours' drive in a lumliering old
staire coach. Yet even then there were
summer visitors, yvho came from the
city for a few weeks' rest and recreation,
and my parents kept one spare room for
such iruests. It was always occupied
from June until October, sometimes by-
one all summer, sometimes changing its
occupants every few weeks."
"L'pon this summer, when 1 had com
pleted my nineteenth year, we had an
invalid guest, a man ot twenty-two or
three, who had met with a serious acci
dent in the Spring, and was ordered to
take country air and rest to perfect Ins
recovery.
"He was the handsomest man I ever
sayv, and as noble and talented as he was
attractive. I am sgre he was all this in
those days," said Maria earnestly as if
replying to some contradiction in her own
heart, "and we all became very fond of
him, Mv brother Tom your lather
would take him fishing when he was
strong enough, and little lieu be n would
cling about him loving!'. I was the
oldest of the three children, and obliged
to assist mother in the household work,
but when evening came, and work yvas
over, I could chat with our guest, play
for him upon our cottage piano, and
siug the ballads that we loth loved.
"It was all too short a summer, dear,
for the happiness we found in it,' aid
when parting time came, lioland Wells
told nie he loved me,"
'KoIand Wells ? " cried Jennie. Not
our Roland Wells yvho died yesterday? "
"The Roland Wells who loved nie was
young and handsome, full of generous
impulses a man who could easily be a
hero in the eyes of the girl who loved
him, and I loved linn. He was then
confidential clerk in a large wholesale
house, working hard and saving towards
a future partnership.
"It was in the discharge of some
business duty in the warehouse that ho
had been injured, and the firm only
awaited his entire recovery to restore
him to his former position.
"All this he told us, and father wrote
to his employers, who praised him
warmly and held out every hope of ad
vancement. So we were betrothed, and
I was making my wedding finery,
Roland looking out for pleasant rooms
for housekeeping, when one evening in
November he appeared most unexpect
edly at the farm.
"When we were first betrothed he
had told me that his father, mother and
three young sisters were living upon a
small farm, but his ambition had drayvn
him to the city. In our talks of the fu
turewehad planned our wedding trip to
visit his home, and Roland often talked
to me of his parents and the 'girls,1 as
he called his sisters. I knew that he
was very fond of them all and loved
him the better for his yvarm affection for
his home and family.
"But on this November evening he
came to tell us that his father had been
stricken with paralysis, was lying help
less, and his mother had written to im
plore her only son to come to her at
once.
" 'Maria,' he said to me, 'I must go,
and I cannot tell when I can return.
Will you be faithful, love ?"
"And I, weeping, loving him more
than ever for his ready self-sacrifice,
iromised to be true to him all my life,
have kept my promise."
"Roland went home. Letters did
not come so frequently as they do in
these days of steam and telegraphy, but
I heard from him and wrote to him
often during the first years of our sep
aration. I knew that he found the
farm heavily mortgaged and took his
own savings for years to pay off the
debt ; then his father lay helpless for
seven long years, and Roland gave up
all his ambitious hoes, his dreams of
love, to drudge on the farm, to comfort
his mother, to educate his sisters. He
worked early and late, and gradually
his letters came at longer and longer
intervals, until they ceased altogether."
"But if he was a hero to me in our
pleasant summer-time of love, he was
tnore so during those years when I
thought of him lifting manfully the
heavy burdens thrown upon his young
shoulders a good son, a generous
brother. I made an ideal of Roland
and worshiped it."
"In my youth I had lovers, but I re
jected them all, hoping riy Roland
wouk) come and find me faithful. As I
grew older, and that hope died, I still
continued single, because no man of all
I met compared to the Roland of my
memory and dreams my lost lover.
"So, my dear, time passed on; my
brothers grew up and married, my pa
rents died, and I taught music for a
living. Ten years ago the calm mono
tony of my life was broken by a letter
from Roland Wells. He wrote, having
traced me through Reuben. His par
rents were dead, his sisters well married,
and he had made a. fortune ab,roa,d,
"He had ebme home to spend his
wealth, to devote his declining veara to
home-happiness and to love. To love,
Jennie, for he never married, and hav
ing heard that I also was single, he ask
ed of me to renew our engagement, never
formally broken.
f'Mjr der, wa.3 an elderly womw,
wth, my haiy streaked with gray, but I
cried like a baby over that letter. My
Roland was coming home true to me.
Could romance go further? I am afraid,
dear, my answer was rather , gushing,
considering my age and experience, but
the whole thirty- years of separation
seemed wiped out when I wrote it. ,
"In answer to my letter he came here.

not quite idiot enough to expect to see
the Roland from whom I had parted
thirty years before, but 1 imagined a tall,
majestic man, whose brow would be ii
luminated bv the noble life bf self-sacri
fice he had led. who would lie exalted
and raised above ordinary humanity.
V ell. well, the old dream dreams a
well as the voung.
"For lioland came home a thin, stoop
ing man, w ith a wizened face, dried and
wrinkled; keen eyes and narrow, firmly
closed mouth. He was not here a week
before I could read everv thought of
his narrow soul, and saw there ostenta
tion, greed, vanity and utter selfishness.
The love I had believed in was simply
the hope of securing a domestic slave,
for Reuben had told him I was still sin
gle for his sake. A voung w ife, he ar
gued, would be exacting, capricious and
extravagant; but a sensible woman of
my age would look after his comfort and
be duly grateful for being chosen from
all the galaxy of younger and more at
tractive women.
"My letter had renewed our engage
mentand I tried to destroy mv own dis
crimination, to reneyv the glamour of
my youth, to stir anew the fire of love
fast dying in my heart. Roland near
here built a superb home for his bride,
and he wearied nie with descriptions of
the great show he intended to make,
the superb furniture he had ordered,
disappointed that I was not loudly grate
ful for the immense advantages his wile
would enjoy.
"Every time he came to see nie we
drifted further apart in all the sympa
thy and affection that alone could make
married life happy. I was disgusted
yvith the egotism and ostentation of a
selfish money-worshipper, and he was
disappointed at my coolness and the ab
sence of that grateful slavislw affection
he expected to find.
It was a year before the house yvas
completed, the furniture bought, the
gardens planned and planted, and the
establishment placed upon the footing
of most ostentatious 'Wealth. I knew
that Roland was dreading the time when
he must ask me to name the day for our
wedding, and I resolved to spare him.
" We had been driving together, and
I had listened patiently to a minute en
umeration of the beauties of the horses
and carriage and a detailed account of
the cost of each. Conversation hail
flagged, when I'told Roland, kindly but
decidedly, that I saw plainly that the
marriage of which yve had talked could
be productive only of misery for both
of us.
" 'Our youth is over,' I said to him,
'and with it has gone the love yve once
felt for each other. We see only each
other's faults, and it is too late to build
up a new romance. Let us lie good
friends, but no more.'
" He urged me a little, not warmly,
to reconsider my resolution, but submit
ted with rather mortifying good grace
when I insisted. We parted at the
gate, friends only, and we kept our
friendship till lioland died. He mar
ried, as you know, a mere girl who yvas
dazzled by his wealth, and thev were
most unhappy. Perhaps no one knew
so well as myself the secrets of the mis
erable houshold, for Roland taxed my
friendship by demanding sympathy for
all his trials, and poor little Meta, who
was one of my old music scholars, came
to nie yvith all her troubles.
" It niav be, I cannot tell, that I might
after all have made Rolaud happier than
the young wife he chose, but 1 cannot
regret my decision for4my own sake; I
yvas too faithful to the lioland I loved
for thirty years to marry the Roland
yvho came home to me."
"That was what papa meant by
'faithfully faithless?'" said Jennie.
" Yes, your father knew all my strug
gles lietween yvhat seemed my duty and
what my heart dictated. V e cannot
reneyv our youth in this life, Jennie,
and the attempt only produces a pain
ful mockery. Had 1 married lioland
when we yvere first betrothed he might,
yvith a loving wife, with children grow
ing up around him, have retained the
generous, manly impulses, tne nouie
heart that won my love.

SOI.CTIOX OF THE XEGRO PKOBI.KM.
To the Editor of the Advauce :
Vicksbi ro, Miss., Nov. '24. I observe
with grief and shame that your journal
contiuues to pour out blistering anathemas
upon the people ot the South.
In the number for October 2:U the first
page is red with the '"bloody shirt." What
does this mean? Do Northern Christian
people expect to draw u from our evil ways
and teach u to do right by bitter denunci
ations and false presentation of our real
condition iu the South? I that Christ
wise? 1 it common sense, since human
nature is what it is? That political jour
nals should abuse us is not altogether a
matter of wonder; but that the pulpit and
Christian press of a great, intelligent and
generally humane people, possessed of the
means of knowing the truth, should not
allow one weekly paper nor one Sabbath
sermon to go by without lampKning the
South is t me the matchless wonder of the
age.
Look at the great official organ of the
Methodist Episcopal Church in New York.
One would suppose it editor a heartless
Zulu, writing hi ferocious assaults upon
the South with the glittering point of his
poisoned assegai. Nothing is too bitter,
nothing too false. Not that he would, like
some eminent divine he fully indorses,
glory in. the crimes and follies of the South
as a license for his savage pen, but he has
an object purely jolitical and will use
whatever serves his purpose. And so it is
of hundreds of Christian weeklies and
monthlies all over the North and East.
The subject is one full of fearful presage.
Your people see nothing but the poor negro.
The poor, the really impoverished white
man, seems never to be considered. But
the freed man is first, middle, last, the Alpha
and Omega of dream by night and denun
ciation by day, iu hi behalf, of all the
poor trash of the South. When 1 read
these thing 1 often think of the word of
the Fiftic,h l'salm : '"Thou sittest and
speakest against thy brother; thou slender
est thine own mother's son."
And this is often literally true, for the
South is made up largely of people from
every State in the Union, and of citizens
from every nation and kingdom on earth.
But 1 want to refer to the article you
quote ou your first page thus:
"A decent respect for the opinions of
mankind must force the white
citizens of the South to a more equitable
and more honorable behavior toward their
colored fellow citizens," and then follow
certain menace if we don't do better.
To all that I simply say nothing better,
"more equitable or honorable" will ever
come. I lie South has done her liest for the
colored man, and better than she can ever
do again.
Like all agricultural jieople we have had
hard times. The colored man never feels
them unless he spends his earning on hi
vice. But the South took the negro, either
from New 'England or just out of the jun
gles of Africa, and made him the peer of
the greatest Senator iii the capital of the
Union. No agricultural peasantry on earth
ever made such progress in L'OiJ years as the
freed man did in God's own Southern school.
No such peasantry was ever so well clothed,
fed and sheltered on the face of the earth.
Ireland never compared favorably for her
self with him. No peasantry wa ever so
highly esteemed, I may say loved ami honored
as the slaves of the maligned, abused and
slandered South. No toiling das ever en
joyed so much of life, or better opportuni
ties ot making mends and obtaining the
award of good conduct. No laboring or
peasant clas yvere ever more cared for
religiously. Hundred of thousand of them
were raised from heathenism to a goodly
state of Christian exemplarines ami real
piety by the several Christian denomina
tions of Protestants. And when they were
freed they yvere more intelligent ; spoke flu
ently the language of the nation ; knew
how to dress with taste and neatness, to
cook and wash and wait and work, and
knew and better observed the rules ofjo
liteness and the custom of good society
than the poor classes of England, Ireland,
Italy, Austria, Germany, and were always
more dignified and more atease in the pres
ence of their superiors than ever were the
peasant classes of any or all of those coun
tries, f uty years of life among them,
since school-days, with much travel and
observation, fies these facts as indisputable
m my mind.
the Soutn has treated the negro the best
her condition has permitted. We never got
up a savings bank to rob him, nor taught
him that politics were superior to piety,
and the ballot-box more holy than the
sacrament of the Lord's Supper. The
enemies of the South have filled his simple
mind with the idea that we may some day
enslave him again, and therefore he i shy
of u in political matters. At one time the
carpet-baggers had orgamaeu the entire
South into ''loyal leagues," and every col
ored man was solemnly sworn against the
old white race pulpit and jiews and yd
Northern people wonder why yve are so
slow to teach and preach among them. A
great gulf yawn between u and them.
But, withal, I admit that great evil at
tended the slave question ; antl yet no
where and by no body was the negro so
wronged and outraged in the South as he
wa while held as a slave in the Eastern
States. And many of the splended fortunes
of New England are the outgrowth of the
price of Indian and African slaves.
Your quotation speaks of the colored
people being "defrauded in reiect to their
civil rights." Well, you never hear any
one speak of his religious rights. Are civil
rights first, last, everything? Now we may
bulldoze him a little at the hallot-box, but
he bulldozes you people in the pulpit. He
won t haye a Northern white trash-preacher.
He has sent them all away.
And then for the matter of many colored
preacher, they are a disgrace to decent so
ciety. The Northern Methodist Church
papers recently published a list, some of
whom were as graceless a lot of penitentiary
bird a could be found, and complained of
the South for bulldozing and murdering
them. Doubtless in the list were some good
men, and wrong was doubtless done to such ;
but Wesley and his coadjutor vy re a
thousandfold worse treated in E.nglaud, and
yet all mankind were not invoked to hate
England, because a. few scamp maltreated
some clever men.
'e do not for a moment deny the fact
that violence has heretofore been wickedly
employed, but violence prevails everywhere.
One week of outrages in any one of ten
Northern cities I can name will overmatch
all the wrongs inflicted on wnite and black
in a year in my own State; and of the long
list of maltreated negro preacher referred
to, not one hair of a man's head wa ever
molested because he. was a preacher. It was
for other causes.
Now, J undertake to say, and facts will
sustain me, that not one-tenth I might say
not one twentieth of the crimes, follies,
misdemeanors and acts of cruelty charged
upon the South ever took place. They are
sheer fabrications. Gov. St. Jo.hu,, of Kan
sas, is doubtless an hoqestj honorable and
fair minded geutltiban, but he ha been led
into the gravest mistakes imaginable. He
deems the colored man the most persecuted
and outraged of all the inhabitants of the
globe. Why? Because he hears from his
own lira the storv of his wronco. Now. I
dare say that he has heard more nonsense of
that sort than he can tell.
A very clever and intelligent colored man
recently returned from Kansas to this neigh
borhood. He had been interviewed up there
and got into the papers. His tale was fear
ful. He had been kukluxed over and again.
He was the best abused darky that fled from
the -savages and demons of the South. But
he came back, and went straight to his old
employer and demanded work, and at it he
went fl earnest. The newspaper followed
him and he was you will say bulldozed
but he was quietly asked how he could have
told such fearful lies on the white people at
home? "Now," said he, "I will just tell
you all. The whole truth it, if you don't hil
them the bloodiett itoriei you can yf up, you
can't raite a red cent. JiutjHtt wort up a big
tale the vxtn M better and you are all
right and ean get anything you tcant."
That is the substance of his report, and
he was a colored man who never suffered an
indignity or wrong. And that ia the key
to nineteen-twentietha of the woes of Kansas
exodites.
But Gov. St. John says, "Rent the negro
land and sell him supplies at fair prices.

Christian. Just here I call attention to a
forcible insight into thi trailing question,
furnished by Rev. Dr. HarUcll, of New
Orleans, in the Methodist Kevicw for Octo
ber. He says :
"These contracts and credit system in
the sugar and cotton, if not readjusted so
a to protect laborers as well as planters,
doom the mass of negroc in those region ot
the South to years of, if not jerpetual, v
erty. Beside the planters proper there are,
since the war, in all rural districts, at everv
important road crossing and steamboat lanJ
ing, country merchants, who, as a class,
deserve no such respectable title. Every
one of these stores is a whisky shop. These
merchants are often Jews, ami generally Hre
'men of the Shylock type. Their customer
are the small farmers or renters, mostly
negriH's, who can not go or send the larger
towns to trade with the more resnctablo
merchants, ami so must trade with these
crossroads coimorants in human shape.
They advance 'supplies' at ruinou prices,
and take liens on oerylhing their custom
er have. They t'ure both white (?) and
blacks, but chiefly the latter In caiise of their
iiumU'i's and ignorance. 1 have known
personally and learned of many instances
where many families had, year after year,
been strippetl of everything, even to then
pigs and chicken ami household goods. "
Now, Mr. Editor, is not all that true in
Illinois, Ohio, Vermont and Maine? Maik
you: '" AVr rij our tiir M it ulunkt y .ilaip."
H u in is no respertor of persons. l,Tluy
curse both whitesaiid blacks." I know sa.l
and fearful thing about thi curse ou the
negro. But I also know where good men
keep country stores and well-nigh starve,
while a few roils away money is coined, as it
were, by a vast negro patronage. One sells
whisky, the other does not. Dr. Hartell's
article yvas doubtless intended to fan the
Northern hale. But as he rakes to the
bottom, atnl doe his worst, the comparison
of State morals. South antl North, make
hiseffusion rather eulogistic of our sueri
ority in good conduct.
Still I want Gov. St. John, the honora
ble Senator Wiiidom and the Bev. Joseph
Cook, who ha been collecting the groan ot"
Kansas martyrs for a dynamite prelude in
Boston, to weiirh well the suggestive word
of Dr. Hartzell.
Once more, Gov. St. John say if we
yvill do certain things "then the negro will
not want to come North." Indeed! Well,
the negro must go then. If yve advise him
not to trade at whisky shops, yve. bulldoze
him ; if yve urge him to rise curlier und
work better antl ijuit going to doggerirn,
then we bulldoze him. So, do w hat we may,
we are liable to the anathemas of the great
North and East.
But, sir, although last spring the planter
feared the loss of their crops and saw only
ruin iu the sudden lliuht of the negro, they
now that the South is ruined by his
presence, and never can In? a lit home lor
the yvhite race until ho is dispersed and
scattered abroad, either ou the continent or
gathered into a grand nationality in Africa.
We hoim antl pray for this consummation.
Indeed, we yvould in-glad to give the remain
ing years of life to the removal of the col
ored people from this downtrodden and
villifietl land.
The negro has been spoiled. The rising
generation is worthless a a whole, ami they
stand in the way of tho white race every
day, every hour, every moment. I regard
Senator Windi-m a great benefactor of tho
South. 1 bit! him God-ccd. I cure not
for hi motives. I am with him. Help tho
black man out of the Smth. Iet the white
man make tho sugar, the cotton, the tobacco..
There i not nn acre of Southern Hoil tho
yvhite man can not better cultivate thau
the black.
Then the yvhite man doe six days' work
in a week the colored man does almut three.
1 have friend who have made the liest sugar
crop of year with white lalior alone, ami
throe-fifths of the cotton is now made by
white labor.
I think every legislature South ought to
make an appropriation for aiding the iiclto
to go to the West, fie ha seen hi best
day here. He is declining daily. I knoiv
he will find hosts of friend iu the North
and West. I found the colored man in
Cannda, ami he enjoy the climate ami re
fused to return South, even to Illinois uinl
Ohio. It may be a trial for a little time t
the Southern people, but they know bow ti
suffer ami to wait. Their last and only ho?
is the removal of the colored race. Why
any one should le ho blind us not to see it,
or so indifferent a not urge it, is past find
ing out.
Of course, a the earnest friend r,f the
black race, I would not hurry t,om away.
Were they all to vanish ii vlx or twelve
month a (ien. St. Job;, suggests, when bo
say if we don't mini onr p's' ami q' the
lied Sea (shirt) yill open, the negro will
sweep through, ami the ugly white folks Ut
overwhelmed if so swift a movement were
to take place, it would shut up nearly every
cotton factory in the world, and bank rut. t
not a few in all commercial countries. Tho
whole white labor yvould then, for awhile.
lie devoted to corn, wheat, meat and the.
necessities of life, mid would at first mako
but little cotton. But it would make tho
South the grandest and most desirable, and
the wealthiest country on the globe. How
ever, move off as fist as they may, they can
not greatly lessen the-ir numliers for :
considerable number of year. And nil tier
alluvial bottoms will find no trouble iu
obtaining force to till the lands.
Were not the Soutnern State so l'r, I
think they should make large appro
priations for the removal to the Jrtr Slate
of all the freed men who could l: induced
to depart. A it is, I hope the rich old
Eastern antl Northern and Middle State
will appropriate a few million for thi
object. And can not socictic be organized
to aid in the glorious work?

with them in any part of the world will
pay the -owners better than if worked bv
white men. Then 2,000,000 of them could
be settled from Maine and Vermont to Cal
ifornia, and so in thirty years the South
would become the yvoiider of the world.
Ten white j.ple will come Soiitli for
every negro that goes North, and all will bo
well, and the ugliest problem of the ages U
solved; and yet I would greatly prefer tt
have a territory conquered, or purchased, in
Africa and the colore'.', man sent a a great
civilizing agency and Christian missionary
to hi native land. Why can not James
Gurdon Bennett, Esq., who ha done st
much to rend away the curtain that con
cealed Africa from the gaze of the world,
set on foot the grandest enterprise ever
conceived of, and negotiate for an interior
tract of land a large a New York, in sin Ii
a part of Africa a mature reflection would
favor, and arrange tor the colonization of
the whole colored ixqiulation ?
All nations would assist the noble work.
The colored man would regenerate his nativo
home, build railroads, sow fields, orgauiw
governments play the man.
