THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The President's Message is a moderate and
carclul paper, temperate almost to con
serration, and evincing a desire not to com
mit himself unnecessarily to a partisan sup
port of any of the measures oo which public
opinion Is seriously divided. Upon the sub
jeet of reconstruction U clearly implies that
fa the President’s opinion tbe passage of tbe
Constitutional Amendment by the seceded
States may fairly be claimed by Congress as
tbe condition to tbeir admission, and that on
their compliance with these terms Congress
ought to admit them forthwith. The fol
lowing clause of the Message stales the
President's position: “The amendment to
“ the Constitution being adopted, it would
“ remain for the States, whose powers have
“ been so long fa abeyance, to resume their
41 places in tbe two brunches of tiie National
44 Legislature, and thereby complete the work
“of restoration. But His lor you, fellovr
-44 citizens of the Senate, and for yon, fcllow
“ citizens ofthe House of Representatives, :
44 to judge, each of you for yourselves, of the
44 elections, returns and qualifications of your
44 own members.” ~
It will lie seen that the President here as
sumes that It is fur him alone to decide what
the seceded States shall do to qualify them
to resume their places fa the National Legis
lature, and that the powers of Congress arc
limited to judging of the returns and qualifi
cations of the members individually.. Though
moderately expressed, this is an overreaching
and untenable position, which docs not prop
erly recognize the equality of Congress with
the President os a distinct co-ordinate branch
ofthe Government, having equal rights with
him to decide for itself what the Slates shall
do to resume their places in Congress, as well
as the exclusive right to determine whether
the individuals representing the States have
been properly elected.
What the President demands ofthe seceded
States Is well so fur as it goes, but it will be
remembered that Mr. Colfax, whose speech
expressed the sentiment of the House of Rep
resentatives, elated that Congress would de
mand more. On the suffrage question the
President argues in favor of allowing the re
constructing States to regulate It, fa a man
ner that shows a full appreciation by him of
the powerful opposition which exists to that
policy. Ills plea that had he given tbe suffrage
to the froedmen of the South, he must also
have given it to the negroes at the North, is no
more true than would have been an argument
that he could not appoint a Governor of
South Carolina without also assuming to ap
point a Governor of Illinois. The power that
could by'proclamation moke a man a Cover
nor could make another a voter. There is no
doubt that the suffrage question will be fully
discussed fa Congress, and should that body
agree upon some mode of extending the suf
frage, nothing fa the President's Message
commits him to oppose such a policy, though
he would prefer that the extension of sul
frage should come from the rebel States. He
expresses the hope, and seems to believe, that
the white people of tbe South will ultimately
extend the suffrage themselves. Subject tj
these deductions, if they are each, the tone
of the message is kind toward the freedman,
in whoso favor, in all repects except tbe suf
frage, he demands equal rights, and especially
that they have the same right to enforce
their contracts against their employers as
their employers have against them.
Thu President condemns the tax on travel
and transit between tbe States, and denies
that any State has the right to interfere with
their freedom. HU language plainly applies
to the Camden and Amboy monopoly in New
Jersey. He endorses the Homestead Policy,
recommends appropriations for tbe relief of
soldiers, opposes the payment of subsidies to
mail steamship lines, recommends tbe en
largement of navy yards and the establish
ment of one fa iresh water for iron-clada, a
uniform militia system, the payment of the
National debt within thirty years and the
speedy contraction of the paper currency, and
equality of taxation. He denounces the
course and present position of England on the
questions arising oat oi the depredations of
English pirates as unjust and untenable.
Mexico, Maximilian and Juarez are not men
tioned fa the Message, but fa a general way
the Monroe. Doctrine Is mildly enmmclated,
and continued non-intervention promised.
The general tone of the Message may be de
scribed as politic, cautions, patriotic and dig
nified. ' Altogether it is able and will be read
with considerable satisfaction by nearly the
entire people.
REPORT OP THE COMPTROLLER
OK THE CURRENCY.
The report of Hon. Freeman Clarke,
Comptroller of the Currency, which we pub
lish in to-day’s Tbibuke, differs somewhat
from those of the Secretary’s, inasmuch as
it embraces quite a variety of subjects. Na
turally, it would he expected to be confined
to the currency question, but It also treats of
liuuuccs in general, taxation, and the tariff.
Go the currency question, we are furnished
v iih a table showing the amount of paper
money in circulation to be SI, 05C,450,233.
This included all the legal tender notes
Issued, the National Bank notes, and the
State Bank issues remaining in circulation.
It also embraces £100,152,015 of National
Bank currency, not yet issued, and $44,417,329
of Compound Interest notes, which hare been
funded since tbc date named. Deducting
these latter sums from tbc total footing of
the table given, wc have a balance left of
$927,881,959; but by quite a novel mode o
calculation, tbe Comptroller reduces the cur
rency in actual active circulation to $460,-
H4,£29!
This result is arrived at by deducting from
tbc oiiglnal total not only the State Bank cir
culation, and nearly all tbe Compound Inter
est Notes Issued, but also the total amount of
Legal Tender Notes held by National Bonks.
While we can but admire the ingenuity of the
Comptroller io so dexterously “ contracting
tbc currency,” we regret that he did not*
when he had his hand In, also deduct the va"
rious sums which arc stowed away in old
stockings, tradesmen’s tills and farmer’s
boxes, and demonstrate to the world that we
have little or no paper money at all in “active
circulation.”
The truth is, the whole theory of the Comp
troller is absurd. Nine-tenths of the Com
pound Interest notes issued, which he de
ducts on the ground that they are held as in
vestments, and used by the bonks as money
in tbc shape of reserve funds. II they were
w itbdrawn from the bonks, they would have
to be replaced Immediately by other legal
tender notes, and to that extent the currency
of the country would be contracted. Upon
what principal of political economy he rules
out of the ‘‘active circulation” the $193,094,-
3C5 of legal-tender notes held by the National
Banks on tbc Ist of October last, wc are at a
loss to conceive; but if that money is not In
“ active circulation,” wc would like to be
informed what portion of the currency is in
use.
Touching toe question of cnrrency and the
National Banks, the report recommends that
Congress increase the National Bonk currency
to $400,099,000, and that $109,039,000 of Legal
Tender notes be withdrawn. What benefits
tbe people of the United States are to derive
by this addition of $1,000,009 annually to oar
expenditures, the Comptroller docs not state,
ftnd wc arc at a loss to conceive, unless it be
to benefit a few speculators.
The Comptroller, among olhcrthlnge, reco
meuds that the Currency Bureau be removed
to Now Tork, so as to save $299,009 annually
paid to Express Companies.
On the whole, tbe report cannot be said to
be satlrfactorv to the people. It Is evidently
written In the*interest of wild carters and spec
ulatois. Wc arc happy, however, to be able
to state that nonc’of the ahsnrd theories pro
mulgated by the Comptroller arc recommend
ed by his chief, the Hon. Secretary of the
Treasury, whose opinions on the currency
question, will carry more weight with Con
gress and the people than those of any other
man In Washington.

PUSIDiNI'S HESSIGE.
Message of the President of the
United State to the Two Houses
of Congress, at the Commence
ment ofthe First Session of the
Thirty-ninth Congress.
Fcu*ow Citizens of the Senate and House
of Representatives ;
To express gratitude to God, In the name of
the people, tor the preservation of the United
States, is my first duty in addressing you- Oar
thoughts next revert to the death of the late
President by an act of parricidal treason. The
grief of the nation Is still fresh; it Hods some
solace fa the consideration that he lived to en
joy the highest proof of Its confidence by en
tering on the renewed term ofthe Chief Magis
tracy, to w lilch he bad been elected; that he
Drouchi-thc civil war substantially to a close;
that his loss was deplored fa all parts of the
Union; and that foreign nations have ren
dered Justice to bis memory. His removal
cast upon me a heavier weight of cores than
ever devolved upon any one of his predeces
sors. To fulfil my trust I need the support
and confidence of all who are associated with
me in the various departments of Govern
ment, and the support and confidence of the
people. There Is but one way in which I can
nope to gain their necessary aid; it is, to state
with frankness the principles which guide my
conduct, and their application to the present
state of etlairs, well aware that the efficiency
of my labors will, in a great measure, depend
on your and their undivided appreciation.
The Union of the United States ol America
was intended by Us authors to remain as long
as the States themselves shall lost. 44 TTie
Union shall be perpetual,” arc the words of
the Confederation. “To form a more perfect
Union.” by on ordinance of the people ot the
United States, Is the declared purpose of the
Constitution. The hand of Divine Providence
was never more plainly visible in the affairs
of men, than fa the framing and the adoption
of that instrument. It is, beyond compari
son, the greatest event fa American history,
and indeed is it not, of all events fa modern
times, the most pregnant with consequences
for every people of the earth ? The members
of the Convention which prepared It brought
to their work the experience ofthe Confeder
ation. of their several States, and of other
Republican Governments, old and new. But
tiiey needed and they obtained a wisdom su
perior to experience. And when for Its valid
ity It required the approval of a people that
occupied a large pari ofa continent, and act
ed separately in many distinct Conventions,
what is more wonderful than that, after ear
nest contention and long discussion, all feel
ings and ell opinions were ultimately drawn
to one way to Its support ?
The Constitution to which life was thus im
parted contains within itself ample resources
tor Us own preservation. It has power to en
force the laws, punish treason, and insure do
mestic tranquility. In case oithe usurpation
of the Government of a State by one man, or
an oligarchy, it becomes a duty ofthe United
States to makegood the guarantee to that
State of a republican form of got eminent,
and so to maintain the homogeneousness of
all. Docs the lapse of time reveal defects ?
A simple mode of amendment is provided in
the Constitution itself, so that its conditions
can always be made to conform to the require
ments of advancing civilization. No room is
allowed even for the thought of a possibility
of Us coming to an end. And these powers
of self-preservation hare always been asserted
In their complete integrity by every patri
otic Chid Magistrate—by Jefferson and Jack
son, not less than by 'Washington and Mddi
son. The parting advice ofthe Father of his
Country, while yet President, to the people of
the United Slates, was, that “the free Con
: stitntton, which was the work of their bands,
might he sacredly maintained:” and the in
augural words of President Jefferson held np
“ the preservation of Ihi General Govern
ment, in its constitutional rigor, as the sheet
anchor of our peace at home and safety
abroad.” The Constitution is the work of
“the People of the United States,” and It
should he as Indestructible as the people.
11 is not strange that the framers of the
Constitution, which had no model fa the past,
should not have fully comprehended the ex
cellence of their own work. Fresh from a
struggle against arbitrary power, many pa
triots suffered from harassing fears of an ab
sorption of the State Governments by the
general Government, and many from the
oread that the States would break away from
their orbits. But the very greatness of our
country should allay the apprehension of en
croachments by the general Government. The
subjects that come unquestionably within
Us jurisdiction are so numerous, that it most
ever naturally refuse to be embarrassed by
questions that lie beyond It. Were it other
wise. the Executive would rink beneath the
burden; tie channels of justice would be
choked; be obstructed by
excess; so Ua*t there Is a greater temptation
to exercise some vs the functions of the Gen
eral Government thi-nogh the States than to
trespass on their rightful sphere. The ab
solute acqulescnce fa the deuUions of the ma
jority** was, at the beginning of the century,
enforced by Jefferson “as the vital principle
ot republics,** and the events of the last four
years have established, we will hope forever,
that there lies no appeal to force.
The maintenance of the Union brings with
it 44 the support of the State Governments in
all tbeir rights;'* but it is not one of the
rights of any State Government to renounce
its own place fa tbe Union, or to nullify tbe
laws of the Union. The largest liberly*U to
be maintained fa tbe discussion of tbe acts of
tbe Federal Government; bnt there is no ap-
C 1 from Us laws, except to tbe various
uebes of that Government Itself, or to the
people, wbo grant tbe members of the Legis
lative and of the Executive Departments no
tenure but a limited one, and fa that manner
always retain the powers of redress.
“Tbe sovereignty of the Slates” is tbe
, language ol the Confederacy, and not the
language of the Constitution. The latter
contains the emphatic words: “The Con
stitution, and the laws of the United Stale*
whichdiall be made m pursuance thereof,
and all treaties made or which shall be made
under tbe authority of tbe United Stares,
shell be the supreme law of tbe land; mid
tbe Judges in every Slate shall be bound
thereby, anything fa the constitution or laws
ot anv State to the contrarv notwithstand
ing.” *
Certainly the Government of the United
States is a limited government; and .so is ev
ery State government a limited government.
With os, this idea of limitation spreads
through every form of administration, gen
eral, state and municipal, and rests on the
great distinguishing principle of tbe recogni
tion of tbe rights ot man. The ancient re
publics absorbed tbe individual fa the State,
prescribed bis religion, and controlled his ac
tivity. The American system rests on the
assertion of the equal rights of every man to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; to
freedom oi conscience, to the culture and ex
ercise of all his faculties. As a consequence,
the Stale government is limited, as to tbe
General Government in the interest of Union,
as to the Individual citizen fa the interest of
freedom.
States, with proper limitations of power,
arc essential to the existence of the Consti
tution of the United States. At the very
commencement, when wc assumed a place
among the Powers of the earth, tbe Declara
tion of Independence was adopted by States ;
so also were the Articles of Confederation ;
and when “the People of the United States”
ordained and established the Constitution It
was the assent of the States, one by one,
which gave it vitality. In the event, too, of
any amendment to the Constitution, the prop
osition of Congress needs tbc confirmation of
Slates. "Without Slates, one great branch of
the legislative Government would be want
ing. And, if we look beyond the letter of
the Constitution, to the character of our
country, its capacity for comprehending
within Its jurisdiction a vast continental em
pire Is due to th€ system ol States. Tbc best
security for tbc- pcrpcctnal existence of tbe
States, Is tbe “ supreme authority” of the
Constitution of the United States. The per
petuity ol tbe Constitution brings it the
perpelultvof the States; their mutual rela
tion makes us what we arc, and in <suf politi
cal system their connection Is indissoluble.
The whole cannot • exist without the parts,
nor the parts without the whole. So long as
the Constitution of the United States endures,
the States will endure; the destruction of the
one is the destruction of the other; the pres
ervation of the one is the preservation of the
other. r
1 have thus explained my views of the mu
tual relations of the Constitution and the
States, because they unfold the principles on
which 1 have sought to solve the momentous
questions and overcome the appalling diffi
culties that met me at the very commence
ment of my administration. It has been my
ifteadtast object to escape from the sway of
momentary passions, ana to derive a healing
poUcvfiom the fundamental and unchanging
principles of the Constitution.
I found the Stales suffering from the effects
ol a civil war. Resistance to tbe General
Government appeared to have exhausted It
self. The United States had recovered pos
session of their forts and arsenals; and tbeir
armies were in the occupation of every State
which had attempted to secede. Whether the
territory within tbc limits of those States
should be held os conquered territory, under
military authority emanating from the Presi
dent as the head of the army, was the first
question that presented itself lor decision.
Now, military governments, established for
an indefinite have ofiured no se
curity for the early suppression of discontent;
would have divided the people Into tbe van
qnishers and the vanquished; and wonld
have envenomed hatred, rather than have re
stored affection. Once established, no precise
limit to their continuance was conceivable.
They would have occasioned an incalculable
and exhausting expense. Peaceful emigration
to and from that portion of the country is one
of the best means that can be thought of for
tbc restoration of harmony; and that emigra
tion would have been prevented; for what
emigrant from abroad, what industrious citi
zen at home, would place himself willingly
under military rule ? Tbe chief persons who
would have followed in the train of the army
would have been dependents on the General
Government, or men who expected profit
from the miseries of their erring fcllow-clU
sens. The powers of patronage and rule
which would have been exercised, under the
President, over a vast, and populous, and na
turally wealthy region, arc greater than, un
less under extreme necessity, I should he wil
ling to entrust to any one man; they ore such
as, for myself 1 could never, unless on occa
sions of great emergency, consent to exercise.
The wilful use of speh powers, if continued
through a period of years, would have en
dangered, the purity of the general adminis
tration and tbe liberties of the States which
remained loyaL ...
Besides, the policy of military rule over a
conquered territory would have implied that
the Slates whose inhabitants may have taken
Eart In the rebellion had, by the act of those
habitants, ceased to exist- But tbe tnic
i boory is, that all pretended acts of secession
were, from the beginning, null and void.
The States cannot commit treason, nor screen
thej Individual citizens who may have com
mitted treason, any more than they can
make valid treaties or engage in lawful com
meiccwith any foreign power. The 8:a a.
attempting to secede placed themselves in a'
condition where their vitality was imp tired,
but not extinguished—their functions sus
pended, but not destroyed.
But If any State neglects or refuses to per
form Its offices, there Is the more need that
the General Government should maintain its
authority, and, as soon os practicable, resume;
. the exerciscol all its functions. On this prin
. clplc 1 have acted, and have gradually and
quietly, and by almost imperceptible steps,
sought to restore the rightful energy of the
General Government and of the States. To
that end, Provisional Governor* have been ap
pointed for the States, Conventions called.
Governors elected. Legislatures assembled,
and Senators and Representatives chosen to
the Congress of the united States. At the
same time, the Courts of the United States,
as for as could be done, have been reopened,
so that the laws ol the United States may he
enforced through theit agency. The block
ade has been removed and the custom-houses
re-established in ports of entry, so that the
revenue of the United States may be collect
ed. The Post Office Department renews its
ceaseless activity, and the General Govern
ment is thereby enabled to communicate
promptly with Its officers and agents. The
courts bring security to persons and proper
ty; the opening of ; the porta invites the re
storation of industry and commerce; tfaelpost
office renews the >. fficilllies ’of social inter
course and of business.- - And is H not ‘happy
for us all, that the restoration of each one of
these functions of the General Government
brings with it a blessing to the Slates over
which they arc extended t Is it not a sure
promise of harmony and renewed attachment
to the Union that, after all that has hap
pened, the return of the General Government
Is known only as a beneficence ?
. I know very well that this policy is attend
ed with some risk; that for Its success it re
quires at least the acquiescence of the Slates
which it concerns; that It implies on invita
tion to those States, by renewing their allegi
ance to the United States, to resume their
functions as States ol the Union. But it is a
risk that must be taken.; in the choice ofdllfi
cullies, it is the smallest risk; and to dimin
ish, and, if possible, to remove all danger, I
have felt It incumbent on me to assert one
other power of the General Government—the
power of pardon. As no State can threw a
defence over the crime of treason, the power
of pardon is exclusively vested in the Evoca
tive Government of the United States. In ex
ercising that power, I have taken every pre
caution to connect it with the clearest recog
nition of the binding force of the laws of the
United Stales, and an unqualified acknowl
edgment of the great social change of condi
tion in regard to slavery which has grown out
of the war
The next step which I have taken to re
store the constitutional relations of the
States, has been an Invitation to them to par
ticipate fa tbe high office of amending the
Constitution. Every patriot must wish for a
general amnesty at the earliest epoch con
slstent with public safety. For this great
end there, is need of a concurrence of all
opinions, and the spirit of mutual concilia
tion. All parties fa the laic terrible conflict
must work together fa harmony. It is not
too much to ask, fa the name of tbe whole
people, that, ou the one side, the plan of
restoration shall proceed fa conformity with
a willingness to cast the disorders ofthe post
Into oblivion; and, that, on the other, the
evidence of sincerity fa the future mainte
nance of the Union shall be nut beyond any
doubt by tbe ratification of the proposed
amendment to tbe Constitution, which pro
vides for the abolition oi slavery forever with
in the limits of our country. So long as the
adoption of this amendment is delayed, so
long will doubt, and jealousy, and uncertain
ty prevail. This is the measure which will
efface the sad memory of tbe post; this Is
the measure which will most certainly call
population, and capital, and security to those
parts of the Union that need them most. In
deed, it is not too much to ask of the States
which arc now resuming their places to the
family of the Union to give this pledge of
perpetual loyalty and peace. Until it is
done, the past, however much we may de
sire it, will not be forgotten. Tbe adoption
of tbe amendment reunites us beyond all
power of disruption, it heals the wound
that Is still Imperfectly closed; !t removes
slavery, the clement which has so long per
plexed and divided the country; It makes ot
ns once more a united people, renewed and
strengthened, bound more than ever to mu
tual affection and support.
The amendment to the Constitution being
adopted, it Would remain lor -tbe States,
whose powers Lave been so long in abeyance,
to resume tbeir places fa the two branches of
the National Legislature, and thereby com
plete tbe work of restoration. Here it is for
yon, fellow-citizens of the Senate, and for
you, feilow.dtlzens of the House of Repre
sentatives, to judge, each of you for your
selves, of the elections, returns and qualifica
tions of your own members.
Tbe full assertion ofthe powers of tbe Gen
eral Government requires tbe bolding of Cir
cuit Courts of tbe United States within the
districts where their authority has been in
terrupted. In the present posture of our pub
lic affairs, strong objections Lave been urged
to bolding those courts fa any of tbe States
where the rebellion has existed: and It was
ascertained, by Inquiry, that the Circuit Court
of tbe United States would not be held with
in the District of Virginia during the autumn
or early winter, nor until Congress should
have 44 on opportunity to consider and act on
the w hole subject.” To your deliberations
the restoration of this branch of the civil au
thority of the United States is therefore ne
cessarily rclerrcd, with the hope that early
provision will be made for the resumption of
all its functions. It Is manifest that treason,
most flagrant fa character, has been commit
ted. Persons who are charged with its com
mission should have fair ana Impartial trials
fa the highest civil tribunals of the country,
fa order that the Constitution and tbe laws
may be ftally vindicated; the truth clearly
established and affirmed that treason is a
crime, that traitors should be punished and
tbe offence made infamous; and, at the same
time, that the question may be judicially set
tled, finally and forever, that no State of Its
own will has the right to renounce Us place
fa the Union.
Tbe relations of the General Government
towards the four millions of fahnhltants whom
the war has called into, freedom, have en
gaged my most serious consideration. On
the propriety of attempting to make the
freedmen electors by the proclamation of the
Executive, I took for my counsel the Consti
tution itself, the interpretations of that in
strument by.’lt* authors and their contempora
ries, and recent legislation by Congress.
When, at tbe| first movement toward inde
pendence, rhe Congress of the United States
instructed tbe several States to institute Gov
ernments of tbeir own, they left each State to
decide tor itself the conditions for the enjoy
ment ofthe elective franchise. During the
peried ofthe Confederacy, there continued to
exist a very great diversity in the qualifica
tions of electors fa tbe several States; and
even within a State a distinction of qualifica
tions prevailed with regard to the officers
wbo w ere to be chosen. »he Constitution of
the United States recognizes these diversities
when it enjoins that. In the choice of mem
bers ofthe House of Representatives of the
United States, 44 the doctors in each State
shall have the qualifications requisite for elec
tors of the most numerous branch ol the
State Legislature.” After the formation of
the Constitution, It remained, as before, the
uniform nsege lor each State to
enlarge the body of its electors,
according to Us own judgment;
and, under this system, one Slate after another
has proceeded to increase the number of Us
electors, until now universal suffrage, or some
thing very near It, is the general ntlc. So
fixed was this reservation of power in the
habits of tbe people, and so unquestioned has
been the interpretation of the Constitution,
that during the civU war the late President
never harbored the purpose—certainly never
avowed the purpose—of disregarding it; and
fa the acts of Congress, daring that period,
nothing can be fonnd which, daring the con
tinuance of hostilities, much leas after tbeir
close, would have sanctioned any departure
by the Executive from a policy which has so
uniformly obtained. Moreover, a concession
of the elective franchise to the freedmen, by
act of the President of the United States, must
have been extended to all colored men. wher
ever found, and so must have established a
change of suffrage fa the Northern. Middle,
and Western States, not less than fa tbe South
ern end Southwestern. Such an act would
have created a new class of voters, and would
have been an assumption of power by the
President which nothing in the Constitution
or laws of tbo United States would have war
ranted.
On the other hand, every danger of conflict
is avoided when the settlement of the ques
tion is referred to the several States. They
can, each for itself, decide' on the measure,
and whether U Is to bo adopted at once and
absolutely, or introduced gradually and with
cCndittoes. In my judgment, the freedmen,
it they show patience and manly virtues, will
sooner obtain a participation m the elective
franchise through the Stales thou through the
General Government, even if It bad power to
intervene. When the tumult of emo lons
that have been raised by tbc suddenness of
the social change shall have subsided. It may
prove that they will receive tbe kindliest
usage from some of those on whom they have
heretofore most closely depended.
But while I have no doubt that now, after
the close of tbe war, It Is not competent for
tbc General Government to extend the elec
tive franchise m the several States, It Is equal
ly clear that good lalth requires the security
of the freedmen io their liberty and their
property, their right to labor, and tbeir right
to claim tbe just return of tbeir labor. I can
not too strongly urge a dispassionate treat
ment of ibis subject, which should be care
fully kept aloof from all party strife. Wc
must equally avoid hasty assumption of any
natural impossibility for the two races to Uvc
aide by side, in a state of mutual benefit
and good will. The experiment involves
us in no Inconsistency; Ictus then, go on
and make that experiment in good faith, and
not be too easily disheartened. The country
Is in need of labor, and the freedmen are in
need of employment, culture and protection.
While their light of voluntary migration and
expatriation is not to be questioned, I would
not advise their forced removal and coloni
zation. Lot us rather encourage them to
honorable and useful industry, where it may
be beneficial to themselves and to the coun
try ; and. instead of hasty anticipations of
the certainty of failure, let there be nothing
wanting to the fair trial of the experiment.
The change In their condition is the substitu
tion of labor by contract for tbe status of
slavery- The freedman cannot fairly be acr
cured of unwillingness to work, 6 > long as
a doubt remains about his freedom of choice
in his pursuits, and the certainty of his recov
ering ms stipulated wages. In this the inter
ests of the employer and tbc employed coin
cide. The employer desires in his workmen
spirit and alacrity, and these can be perma
nently secured in no other way. Ana If the
one ought to be able to enforce tbe contract,
so ought the other. The public interest will
be best promoted If the several States will
provided adequate protection and remedies
lor tbc freedmen. Until this Is in some way
accomplished, there is no chance for the ad
vantageous use of their labor; and the blame
of 111-success will not rest on them.
I know that sincere philanthropy is earnest
for the immediate realization of its remotest
alms; but time is always an element in re
form. It is one of tbc greatest acts on record
to have brought four millions of people Into
freedom. Tbc career of free industry must be
fairly opened to them ; and then their future
prosperity and condition must, after all, rest
mainly on themselves. It they fall, and so
pcrl-b away, lot us be careful that the failure
thall not be attributable to any denial of- jus
tice. In all ibat relates to the destiny of the
freedmen, wc need not be too anxious to road
the future; many Incidents which, from a
speculative point of view, might raise alarm,
will quietly settle themselves.
Now that slavery is at an end, or near Us
end, tbe greatness of Us evil, In tbe point of
view of public economy, becomes more and
more apparent. Slavery was essentially a
monopoly oflabor, and as snch locked the
States where It prevailed against tho incom
ing offree industry. Where labor was the
property of the capitalist, the white man was
excluded from employment, or had bnt the
second best chance of finding it; and the for
eign emigrant turned awav from the region
where bis condition would be so precarious.
With the destruction of the monopoly, free
labor will hasten from all parts or Un civi
lized world to assist in developing various
and innumerable resources which have hith
erto lain dormant. The eight or nine Slates
nearest the Gull of Mexico nave a soil of exu
berant fertility, a climate friendly to long
life, and can sustain a denser population than
is found as yet in any part of our country.
And the future influx of population to them
wQI be mainly from the North, or from the
most cultivated nations in Europe. From
the sufferings that have attended them during
onr late struggle, let ns look away to the lh
tore, which Is sure to be laden for them with
greater prosperity than has ever before been
known. . The removal of the monopoly of
slave labor is a pledge that those regions will
he peopled by a numerous and enterprising
population, which will vie with any in the
Union in compactness, inventive* genius,
wealth and Industry* ■
Our Government springs from and was
made for the people—not the people for the
Government. To them it owes allegiance;
from them it most derive its courage,
strength, and wisdom. Bnt, while the Gov
ernment is thus hound to defer to the people,
from whom It derives its existence, It should,
frem the very consideration of its origin, be
strong in its power of resistance to the estab
lishment of inequalities.. Monopolies, per-,
pctnltles, and class legislation, are contrary*
to the genius of free government, and ought
not to Be allowed. Here, there is no room for
favored classes or monopolies; the principle
of our Government Is that of equal laws and
freedom of industry. Wherever monopoly
attains a foothold, It is sure to be a source of
danger, discord, and trouble. We shall but
fnlfil our duties as legislators by according
“equal and exact Justice to all men,” special
privileges to none. The Government is sub
ordinate to the people; bnt, as the agent and
representative of the people, It must be held
superior to monopolies, which, fa them
selves, onght never to be granted, and which,
where they exist, most be subordinate and
yield to the Government.
The Constitution coolers on Congress the
right to regulate commerce among the several
States. It, is of the first necessity, for the
maintenance of the Union, that that commerce
should be free and unobstructed. No State
can be justified fa any device to tax the transit
of travel and commerce between States. The'
position of many States is snch that, If they
were allowed to take advantage of it for pur
poses of local revenue, the commerce between
States might be Injuriously burdened, or even
virtually prohibited. It is bast, while the
country is still young, and while the tendency
to dangerous monopolies of this kind is still
feeble, to use the power of Congress so as to
prevent any sclflso impediment to the free cir
culation of men and merchandise. A tax on
travel and merchandise, fa their transit, con
stitutes one of the worst forms of monopoly,
and the evil Is increased if coupled with a de
nial of the choice of route. When the vast
extent of onr country is considered, it is plain
that every obstacle to the free circulation of
commerce between the States ought to bo
sternly guarded against by appropriate legis
lation, within the limits oftheConstitution.
The report of the Secretary ol the Interior
explains the condition of the public lands,
thctransactionrof the Patent Office andtbo
Pension Bureau, the management of our In
dian affairs, the progress made fa the con
struction ofthe Pacific railroad, and furnishes
Information fa reference to matters of local
interest fa the District of Columbia. It also
presents evidence of the successful operation
of the Homestead Act, under the provisions
of which 1,160,533 acres of the public lands
were entered during the last fiscal year—-more
than one-fourth ol the whole number of acres
sold or otherwise disposed of during that pe
riod. It is estimated that the receipts derived
from this source arc sufficient to cover the ex
penses Incident to the survey and disposal of
the lands entered under this Act, and that
payments fa cash to the extent of from forty
to fifty per cent will be made by settlers, who
may tuns at any time acquire the title before
tbo expiration of the period at which It would
otherwise vest. The homestead policy was
established only after long and earnest resist
ance ; experience proves Its wisdom. The
lands, fa the hands of fadustrions settlers,
whose labor creates wealth and contributes
to the public resources, arc worth more to the
United States than if they had been reserved
as a solitude lor Ihture purchasers.
The lamentable events of the last four
years, and the sacrifices made by the gallant
men of our Army and Navy, bare swelled the
records of the Pension Bureau to an unprece
dented extent. On tbe ffOth day of June last,
the total number of pensioners was 85,U5(3, re
quiring for their annual pay; exclusive of ex
penses, the sum of €£,(££>,44s. The number
of applications that have been allowed since
that date will require a large Increase of this
amount for the next fiscal year. The means
for the payment of the stipends due, under
existing laws, to our disabled soldiers and
sailors, and to the families of such os have
perished fa the service of tbo country, will no
doubt be chcerlhlly and promptly granted.
A grateful people will not hesitate to sanc
tion any measures having for their object the
relief of soldiers mutilated and families made
fatherless fa the efforts to preserve our na
tional existence.
The report of tbe Postmaster General pre
sents an encouraging exhibit of the opera
tions of the Post Office Department during
the rear. The revenues ol the past year from
the loyal States alone exceeded the maximum
annual receipts from all tbe States previous
to the rebellion, In the sum of i 6,tt>s,oyi;
and the annual average Increase of revenue
during the last four years, compared with the
revenues of the four years immediately pre
ceding the rebellion, was $1,0£*,845. The
revenues of tbe last fiscal y«»r amounted to
$14,556,158, and the expenditures .Jo
12$, leaving a surplus of receipts over ex
penditures of 1861,420. Progress has been
made in restoring the postal service ia the
Southern States. The views presented by the
Postmaster General against the policy of
granting subsidies to ocean mall steamship
lines upon established rentes, and in lavor of
continuing the present system, which limits
the compensation for ocean service to the
postage earnings, are recommended to the
larclnl consideration of Congress.
It appears, from the report of the Secretary
of the >'arr, that while, at the commence
ment of the present year, there wore in com
mission 550 vessels of all classes end descrip
tions, armed with 5,000 guns and manned by
51 000 mtn, the number of vessels at present
In commission la 117, with SSOguna and 13,138
men. By this prompt reduction of the naval
forces the expenses of the Government have
been largely diminished, and a number of
vessels, purchased for naval purposes from
the merchant marine, have been returned to
tbe peaceful pursuits of commerce. Since the
suppression of active hostilities our foreign
squadrons have been re-established, and con
sist of vessels much more efficient than those
employed on similar service previous to the
rebellion. The suggestion for the enlarge
ment of the navy-yards, and especially lor
the establishment of one in fresh water for
Iron-clad vessels, Is deserving of considera
tion, as is also the recommendation for a dif
ferent locution and more ample grounds for
the >’aval Academy.
In the report of the Secretary of War, a gen
eral summary is given of the military cam
paigns of IBT4 and 1805. ending In the sup
pression of armed resistance to the national
authority In the insurgent States. The ope
rations ot tbe general administrative Bureaus
of the War Department during the post year
arc detailed, and an estimate made of the ap
propriations that will be required lor military
purposes in tbe fiscal year commencing the
aOlh day of June, 1866. The national military
iorce on the Ist of May, 1805, numbered
1,000,51(5 men. It Is proposed to reduce the
military establishment to a peace footing,
comprehending fifty thonsana troops of all
arms, organized so as to admit of an enlarge
ment by filling up the ranks to eighty-two
thousand six hundred, if the circumstances of
the country should require an augmentation of
the army. The volunteer force lias already
been reduced by the discharge from service of
over eight honored thousand troops, and the
Department is proceeding rapidly in the work
of farther redaction. The war estimates are
reduced from $510,240,151 to $55,814,401,
which amount, in the opinion of the Depart
ment, is adequate for a peace establishment.
The measures of retrenchment in each Bureau
and branch of the service exhibit a diligent
economy worthy of commendation. Refer
ence Is also made in the report to the neces
sity of providing for a uniform militia system,
and to tbe propriety of making suitable pro
vision for wounded and disabled officers and
soldiers.
Tbc revenue system of the country Is a sub
ject x)l vital interest to Its honor and prosper
ity, and should command the earnest consid
eration of Congress. The Secretary of the
Trersmy will lay before you afttll and detail
ed report of tbe receipts and disbursements of
the last fiscal year, of the first quarter of the
present fiscal year, oi the probable receipts
and expenditures for the other three quarters,
and the estimates for the year following the
30tb of June, 1860. I might content myself
with a reference to that report, in which you
will find all the information required for your
deliberations and decision. But the para
mount importance oi tbc subject so presses
Itself on my mind, that I cannot but lay be
fore you my views of the measures which are
required for the good character, and, I might
almost say, for the existence of this people.
The life of a republic lies certainly in the cn
ergy, virtue an‘d intelligence of its citizens;
but it is equally true that a good revenue
system Is the life of an organized government.
1 meet you at a time when the nation has
voluntarily burdened itself with a debt un
precedented in our annals. Vast as is Us
amount, it fades away into nothing when
compared with the countless blessings that
will be conferred upon our country and upon
man by tbc preservation of the nation’s fife.
Now, on the first occasion of the meeting ol
Congress since the return of peace, It Is of the
utmost importance to Inauguratca just policy,
which shall at once be put In motion, and
which shall commend itself to those who
come after us for Its continuance. Wc must
aim at nothing less than tbe complete efface
meat of the financial evils that necessarily
followed a state of civil war. Wc must cn-
deavor to apply the earliest remedy to the
deranged state of the currency, and not
t brink' from devising a policy which, without
being oppressive to the people, shall Imme
diately begin to effect a redaction of the debt,
and, If persisted in, discharge it fully within a
definitely fixed number of years.
It is our first duly to prepare In earnest for
our recovery from the cver-iacrcashur evils of
on Irredeemable currency, without a sadden
revulsion, and yet without untimely procras
tination. For that end, we most, each in onr
respective positions, prepare the way. I
hold It the dnty of the Executive to insist
upon frugality in the expenditures; and a
sparing economy is Itself a great national re
source. Of the banks to which authority has
been given to issue notes secured by bonds of
the United States, wc may require the great
cst moderation and prudence, and the law
most bo rigidly enforced when its limits are
exceeded. We may, each one of us, counsel
our active and enterprising countrymen to be
constantly on their guard, to liquidate debts
contracted in a paper currency, and. by con
ducting business as nearly as possible on a
system of cash payments or short credits, to
hold themselves prepared to return to the
standard of gold and silver. To aid our fol
low-citizens m the prudent management.of
their monetary affairs, the dnty devolves on
ns to diminish bylaw the amount of paper
money now lu circulation. Five years ago
ihc bank-note circulation of the country
amounted to not much more than two hun
dred millions; now the circulation, bank and
national, exceeds seven hundred millions.
The simple statement of the fact recommends
more strongly than any words of mine can do,
the necessity of our restraining this expan
sicn. The gradual redaction of the currency
is the only measure that can save the business
cf the country from disastrous' calamities;
and this can be almost imperceptibly accom
pllibcdby gradually ftmding the national
circulation in securities thal.may be made ro
de* mnble at the pleasure of the Government.
Our debt is doobly secure—first in the ac
tual wealth and still greater undeveloped re
source* of the country; and next in the char
acter of our institutions. The most intelli
gent observers among political economists
have not failed to remark that the public debt
ot a country Is safe In proportion as it* people
ere free; that the debt of a republic is the
safest of all. Our history confirms and estab
lishes the theory, and is, I firmly believe
destined to give it a still stronger illustration!
The secret of this superiority springs not
merely from the tact that in a republic the
national obligations are distributed more
widely through countless numbers in all
.classes of society; it has Us roots in the char
acter of our laws. Here all men contribute-*
to the general’ and' bear their lair
share of the public burdens. During the war
under the Impulse of patrioUsmTlhe men
of the great body of the people, with
out regard to their own comparative want of
wealth, thronged to our armies and filled our
fleets of war, and held themselves ready to of
fer their lives lor the public good. Now, in
their turn, the property and income of the
country should bear their lost proportion of
the burden of taxation, while in our impost
system, through means of which Increased vi
tality Is Incidentally imparted to ail the in
dustrial interests of the'nation, the duties
should be so adjusted as to foil most heavily
on articles of luxury, leaving the necessaries
of life as free from taxation as the absolute
wants of the Government, cconomicaUy ad
ministered, will justify. No favored class
should demand freedom from assessment, and
the taxes should be so distributed as not to
fall unduly on the poor, but rather ou the ac
cumulated wealth of the country. We should
look at the national debt just as it Is—not os
a national blessing, but as a heavy burden on
the industry of the country, to be discharged
without unnecessary delay.
It is estimated by the Secretary of the
Treasury that the expenditures for the fiscal
year endiug the 80th of June, ISfIC, will ex
ceed the receipts $112,1W,017. It is grati
fying, however, to state that it is also esti
mated that lire revenue for the year ending
the 80th of June, 18G7, will exceed the ex
penditures in the sum of $111,082,515. This
amount, or to much as may be deemed suffi
cient for the purpose, may tc applied to the
reduction of the public debt, which, on the
Slst day of October, 1805. wa5'52,740,854,750.
Every reduction will diminish the total
amount of interest to bo paid, and so enlarge
the means of still further reductions, until
the whole shall be liquidated; and this, as
w ill bo seen from the estimates of the Secre
tary’ of the Treasury, may be accomplished
by annual payments even within a period not
exceeding thirty years. 1 have faith that wc
shall do all this within a reasonable time;
that, as we Lave amazed the world by the
suppression of a civil war which was thought
tone beyond the control of any government,
so wc shall equally show the superiority of
our Institutions by the prompt and faithful
discharge of our national obligations.
The Department of Agriculture, under its
present direction, is accomplishing much In
developing and utilizing the vast agricultural
capabilities of the country, and for informa
tion respecting the details of Us management
reference Is made to the annual report ot the
Commissioner.
1 have dwelt thus fully on our domestic af
fairs because of their transcendent impor
tance. Under any circumstances our great
extent of territory and variety of -climate,
producing almost every thing that is necessa
ry* for the wants, and even the comforts of
man, make us singularly independent of the
vary Inc policy of foreign Powers, and protect
us against every temptation to 41 entangling
alliances.** while at the present moment the
re-establishment of harmony, and the
strength that comes from harmony, will be
onr best security against . “nations who feel
power and forget right.** For myself, It has
been and it will be my constant aim to pro
mote peace and amity with all foreign na
tions and powers; and I hare every reason to
believe that they aH,witbout exception,arc an
imated by the same disposition. Onr relations
with the Emperor of Chino, so recent in their
origin, are most friendly. Onr commerce
with bis dominions Is receiving new devel
opments ; and it is very pleasing to
find that the Government of that
great Empire manifests satisfaction with
our policy, end reposes just confidence in
the talrness which marks oar intercourse.
The unbroken harmony between the United
States and the Emperor of Russia Is receiving
a new support from an enterprise designed to
carry telegraphic lines across the continent of
Asia, through bU dominions, and so to con
nect us with all Europe by a new channel of
intercourse. Our commerce with South
America Is about to receive encouragement
by a direct line of mail steamships to the ri
sing Empire ot Brazil. The distinguished
party of men of science who have recently left
our country to make a scientific exploration
of the natural history and rivers and moun
tain ranges of that region, have received from
the Emperor that generous welcome which
was to have been exacted from his constant
friendship for the United States, and his well
known zeal In promoting the advancement of
knowledge. A hope is entertained that our
commerce with the rich and populous coun
tries that border the Mediterranean sea may
be largely Increased. Nothing will be wont
ing, on the part ol this Government, to ex
tend the protection of our flag over the enter
prise of onr fellow-citizens. \Vc receive from
the Powers in that region assurances of good
will; and it is worthy of note that a special
envoy Las brought us messages of condolence
on the death ol our late Chief Mogist rate from
the Bey of Tunis, whose rule includes the old
uuiuu.fwt>*«»» cartna*w. —Afri<;*n coast.
Our domestic contest, now happily ended,
has left some traces in onr relations with one
ol least of the great maritime Powers. The
formal accordance of belligerent rights to the
insurgent States was unprecedented, and has
not been justified by the issue. But in the
systems of neutrality pursued by the Powers
which made that concession, there was a
marked difference. The materials of war for
the insurgent States were furnished, In a great
measure, from the workshops of Great Brit
ain: ana British ships, manned by Britishsub
jccls, and prepared forrcceivlug British arma
ments tallied from.tbc ports oi Great Britain
to make war on American commerce, under
the shelter of a commission from the insur
gent Slates. These ships, having once es
caped from British ports, ever afterwards en
tered them in every part of the world, to re
fit, end so to renew their depredations. The
consequences of this conduct were most dls
astro us to the States then in rebellion, increas
ing their desolatlon'and misery by the prolon
gation of onr civil contest, it had. moreover,
the eflcct, to u great extent, to drive the
American flag from the sea, and to transfer
much of our shipping and our commerce to
the very Power whose - subjects had created
the necessity for such a change. These events
took place before I was called to the admin
istration of the Government. The sincere de
sire for peace by which 1 am animated led me
to approve the proposal, already made, to
submit the questions which had thus amen
between the countries to arbitration. These
questions are of such moment that they must
have commanded the attention of the great
Towers, and are so interwoven with tbe peace
and interests of every one of them os to have
ensured on Impartial decision. I regret to
inform you that Great Britain declined the
arbitrament, but, on tho other hand, Invited
us to the formation of a joint commission to
rattle mutual claims between the two conn-
tries, frcmwhlch those for the depredations
before mentioned should be excluded. The
proposition, in|.hat very unsatisfactory form,
has been declined.
The United States did not present the sub*
Ject os an impeachment of the good faith of a
rower which was professing the most friendly
dispositions, but os Involving questions of
public law, of which the settlement is essen
tial to the peace of nations; ard, though
pecuniary reparation to their injured citizens
would have followed incidentally on a decis
ion against Great Britain, snch compensation
was not their primary object. They had a
higher motive, and it was in the interests of
peace and justice, to establish important prin
ciples of International law. The correspond
ence will be placed before you. The ground
on which the British Minister rests hii justi
fication Is, substantially, that the municipal
law of a nation, and the domestic. interpreta
tions of that law, are the measure of its duty
as a neutral; and I feel bound to declare my
opinion, before you and before the world,
that that justification cannot be sustained
before the tribunal of nations. At the same
time I do not advise to any present attempt
at redress by acts of legislation. For the
future, friendship between the two countries
must rest on the basis of mutual Justice.
From the moment of the establishment ol
our free Constitution, the civilized world has
been convulsed by revolutions in the interests
of democracy or ofmonareby; but through all
these revolutions the United States have wise
ly and firmly refused to become propagandists
of republicanism. It is the only government
suited to*onr condition; but we have never
sought to Impose It on others; and we have
consistently followed the advice of ‘Washing
ton to recommend it only by the careful pres
ervation and prudent use of the blessing.
During all the intervening period the policy
of European Powers and of the United states
has, on the whole, been harmonious. Twice,
Indeed, rumors of the invasion of some parts
of America, in the interest of monarchy,have
prevailed; twice my predecessors have had
occasion to announce the views of this nation
in respect to such interference. On both oc
casions the remonstrance of the United States
was respected, from a deep conviction, on the
part ofEuropean Governments, that the sys
tem of non-interference and mutual absti
nence from propagondlsm was the tmo rule
for the two hemispheres. Since those times we
have advanced in wealth and power; bat we
retain the sime purpose to leave the nations
of Europe to choose their own dynasties and
form their own systems of government. This
consistent moderation may justly demand a
corresponding moderation. We should re
gard it as a great calamity to ourselves, to
the cause of good government, and to the
peace of the world, should any European
power challenge the American people, as it
>were, to the defence of republicanism against
' foreign interference. We cannot foresee and
: are unwilling to consider what opportunities
might present themselves, what combinations
might offer to protect ourselves against de
signs inimical to our form of government.
The United States desire to act in the lutore
as they have over acted heretofore; they
never will be driven from that course but by
thc.aggresslon of European powers; and we
-rely on the wisdom and justice of .those
Powers to respect the system of non-interfer
ence which has so long been * sanctioned by
time, and which, by its-good results, has ap
proved itself to noth continents.
The correspondence between the United
Slates and France, m reference to questions
which have become subjects of discussion be
tween the two Governments, will, at a proper
time, he laid before Congress.
When, on the organization of onr Govern
ment, under the Constitution, .the President
of the. United States delivered his Inaugural
address to the two Houses of Congress, he
said to them, and through them to the coun
try and to mankind, that “ the preservation
of the sacred Are of liberty and the destiny
of the republican model of government are
justly considered as deeply, perhaps as Unally
staked on the experiment entrusted to the
American people.” And the House of Repre
sentatives answered Washington by the voice
of Madison: “We adore the invisible hand
which has led the American people, through ;
so many difficulties, to cherish a conscious re
sponsibility for the destiny of republican lib
erty/’ More (ban seventy-six years bare
elided awav since these words were spoken;
the United Slates have passed through severer.
trials than were foreseen; and now, at this
new epoch in our existence as one nation,
with our Union puiified by sorrows, and
strengthened by conflict, and established by
the virtue of the people, the greatness of the
occasion invites us once more to repeat, with
solemnity, the pledges of our fathers to hold
ourselves answ crahle 'before our fellow-men
for the success’of the republican form of
government. Experience has proved Us
sufficiency In peace and in war: it has vindi
cated Its authority through dangers, and
afflictions, and sudden and:terrible emergen
cies, which would have emshed any system
that had been less firmly fixed in the heart of
the people. At the inauguration of Wash
ington the foreign relations of the country
were few, and its trade was repressed by hos
tile regulations; now all the civilized nations
of the globe welcome our commerce, and
their Governments proless towards us amity.
Then our country felt its way hes
itatingly along . on untried , .path, with.
State* so Ultle bound ' together by
rapid means of 'communication as to be
hardly known to one another, and with his
toric traditions extending over-very- few
veare; now intercourse between the States is
swift and intimate; the experience of centu
ries has been crowded into a tew generations,
and has created an intense, indestructible
nationality. Then our jurisdiction did not
reach beyond the inconvenient boundaries of
the territory which had achieved indepen
dence ; now, through cessions of lands, first
colonized by Spain and France, thtf country
has acquired a more complex character, and
has for its natural limits the chain of Lakes,
the Gulf of Mexico, and on the cast and west
the two great oceans. Other nations were
wasted by civil wars for ages before,
they could establish _ for themselves*
the . necessary degree 'of unity; the

Washington City, Nov. 22,15G5. f
Mr. Pueftuest: Tbe military appropriations by the
last Congress amounted to tbe sum of five hundred
at d hisliec million! two hundred and forty thousand
one hundred and thirty-one dollars and seventy
cents, (}316.24U.131.70.) Tbe military estimates for
tbe next fiscal year, after caretol revision, amount
to thirty-three milt tons eight hundred and lourtcen
thousand four hundred and sixty one dollars and
eighty-three cents. ($33,814,401.63.) The national
military forte on the first of May, ISOS, numbered
ondralUl<*«fivqbßwd**d«iMi sixteen men. It is
proposed to reduce the military m
filly thousand Uoop*, and over eight hundred
thousand have already been mustered out of ser
vice. What has occasioned this redaction of force
and exnecdmue jn the War Department, U u the
purpose of this report to explain.
At the commcncunent ot the last session of Con
gress much bad been accomplished towards sup
pressing the rebellion »nd restoring Federal au
thority over the insurgent States. Cat the rebels
stilt held Richmond a-* the capital of their so-called
Contederate Govennacnt-andibe semblance ofStale
Government cxUted hi Virginia. North Carolina,
South CaroUna,Georgia,AJabtima.tTorida,Mh*siSßii>-
pi, aid Texas,whltea strong military tores occupied
a considerable portion cf Arkan-tJ* aod k Louisiana.
Tbi-ir principal army, under its favorite command
er, Gen. Lee, defended with undaunted front im
pregnable positions around Petersburg and Rich
mono. Another army, under Gen. ilood. wa?
moving north, with purpose to invade Tennessee
and Kentucky. Wc-t of the Mississippi, a large
force, under Geo. Kirby Smith, threatened Arkafi
res. Kansas, and Missouri. The chief sea
ports of the rebel States—Wilmington, Charles
ton, Savannah, and Mobile—were strongly
garrisoned and fortified, aod our block
ading squadrons . wen.* unable to prevent
trade and supplies reaching the enemy. Pirate
stdiituers, built In foreign ports for rebel cruisers,
armed, manned, equipped and supplied by foreign
capital, roamed toe Ugh bVas, burning our ships
and deslro) log our commerce, ilorauders, hired
by the rebel government and harborodou our north
ern Rentier, were setting on foot piratical expedi
tions against our commerce on the lakes, planning
to burn aod plunder our towns and cities, and wore
plotting murder against the President and Vico
i‘resident of the United States, in hopes of over
throwing our government by anarchy. Faith In
their final success and hope of open recognition by
foreign governments still animated leading traitors.
Bui now the approaching session of Congress
will find the authority of the Federal government
effectually and ncacefolly exercised over the whole
territory of the United States. AH the armies
•heretofore arrayed against the national govern
ment have laid down their arms, ana surrendered as
prisoners of war. Ever; hostile banner has been
hauled down; the so-called confederate govern
ment Is overthrow; Its president Is a prisoner in
cloic custody, awa-tlng trial; while its vio*-prcsi
demand three ot its chief executive officers have
been recently enlarged Rom prison by your clem
ency. All the ordinances, laws, and organizations
created or existing under or by virtue of the so
called confederate government have been swept
away, and, by your sanction, the people of the in
surgent States have organized, or are busily en
gaged in organizing, State government?, in subor
dination to me federal authority. In harmony with
this new condition of aUaira, the military force of the
federal government has been reduced, large armies
disbanded, and nearly a million of brave men, late
ly soldiers in arms, paid and honorably mastered
oat ol service, Lave gone Rom camps, garrisons and
posts to their homes, and most of them are engaged
already in the peaceful pure nits of civil life.
; Among the causes which, under Divine Provi
dence, bate brought about these wonderful results,
successful military operations stand first in order.
A dear comprehension of these operations re-
B[lures8 [lures a brief glance at the military position just be
ure the spring campaigns of 1864.
' Kolwlinfltandingthesnccesbfnlcampahmsonthe
Mississippi, in 1863, by Ibo redaction of Vicksburg
and Port undson, severed in twain the rebel terri
tory and restored to ns tbe navigation and com
merce of the Mississippi, while tbe victory at Get
tysburg drove back the rebel invaders from the
northern State?, yet tno military strength of tbe
rebels continued formidable. Tbe army ot Virgin
ia, under General Lee, recovered (Tom its disaster
at Gettysburg, occupied Us foimerllne* in Virginia,
protecting tbe rebel capital, and holding inactive
and In check the army of the Potomac. Another
large army, under General Bragg, re-lnforccd by
Longstreet’s corps, threatened the reconqnest of
Tennessee. After the disastrous battle of Chlcka
maugs, our army ot the Cumberland, shat np and
tonoonded at Chattanooga, unable to move by
reason ot the inclemency of the weather and Im
passable roads, was tn extreme icopardy.
At this discouraging juncture a change of mili
tary organiaiion was made. The departments of
the Ohio, the Tennessee, and the Cumberland were
nmted in one military division, calico the division
of the Mississippi, under Major General Grant.
Command of tbe army of tbo Cumberland was given
toMajor Geneial George H. Thomas, relieving Gen
eral Itasecrans. A winter campaign was im
mediately directed against Bragg’s" army.
The cattles of Wanhatchle, Look
out Mountain, Missionary Ridge and Chattanooga
opened our communications,S and rooted Bragg’s
army with heavy loss. The movement of Long
street's corps against Knoxville, to recover East
Tennessee, also proved a disastrous failure to tbe
rebels, who were driven off and forced back to the
mountains.
i in the month of February, 1364, General Sher
man's movement, with a large force, Rom Vicks
burg, into tbe interior of the State of Alabama, as
liras Meridian, inflicted heavy loss upon the enemy
by the destruction of railroads and supplies, tbe
capture of prisoners and tbe escape of negroes and
refugees. This operation demonstrated too capac
ity of an invadingarmy to penetrate tho rebel States
and support itself on the country, and was the fore
runner of tbe great movements In Georgia.
The arrangements for the spring campaigns ot
ISC4 were made, on the part of the Government, to
'put forth its strength. In all tbe bnreana of the
War Department supplies were provided on a scale
■of great magnitude, to meet any exigency that
' could be foreseen. The estimate* were based noon
!an army organization of one million of men. The
States ware called upon to strengthen tbe armies by
volunteers; new drafts were ordered and put In ex
ecution throughout all the loval States; vast sup
piles of anus, ammunition, clothing, subsistence,
medical stores, and forage were provided and dis
tributed in depots, to meet the wants of the troops
wherever ibey might operate; horses, mules, wag
ons, railroad iron, locomotives and cars, bridge
Limber, telegraph cable and wire, and every material
for transportation and communication of great
armies under all conditions, were supplied. Con
gress, with unstinting hand, voted large appropria
tions tor recruiting, paying, and supplying the
troops. The office of Lieutenant General, to com
mand all the armies, was created by law. Ulysses
s. Grant was appointed to tnat rank by the Presi
dent, and asanmed command, as lieutenant Gen
eral, on the 17lh day of Marco, 1664, Rom which
time tbe operations of all tbe armies were under
hi* direction ■ ,
The national forces engaged in the spring cam
paign of 1864 were organized as armies or distribu
ted | n military departments as follows:
The Army of the Potomac, commanded* by Major
General Meade, whose headquarters were on tne
N'orth side of the Papldan. This army was cou
frontedby the rebel army of Northern Virginia, sta

Active military operations west of the Missis
sippi commenced in the month ol March, 18M. Tbe
principal rebel fortes beyond the Mississippi were
cosceulrated under Gen. Kirby Smith, at Shreve
port, on the Red river. Against this force an expe
dition was undertaken by Moj. Geo. Banks, with a
lanro army from New Orleans, to be co-operated
with by troops from the department of Aritaasas,
under Gen. totoe!e, and from the division of Missis
sippi, under Gen. A. J. Smllo, and also a large na
val force under Admiral Porter. Gen. Banks with
his forces reached Alexandria about tbe 20th of
March. Advancing thence toward Shreveport, a
series of disasters commenced, ■ that ended in the
failure of the expedition wim heavy loss of men
and material.- The cause of this failure is still a
subject of divenssion, not material to the present
report. Although by this mishap tbe enemy was
enabled to occupy the attention of a large force
designed and that might have been employed in
other fields, be was himself kept in check and hin
dered from taking part In tbe great campaigns east
of tbe Mississippi.
1 he campaigns m Virginia opened on the 4th day
of May. By sun altar cons movements the army of
the Potomac crossed tbe Rapidan, and City Point,
on tbe south side of tbe James, was seized and oc
cupied by General Bailer. Tbe crossing of the
Rapidan was effected without resistance from the
enemy. Tbe movement against City Point look
him by surprise. Ibo army of tbe Potomac was
directed at Lae's army, while tbe dir of Richmond
was the objective petal of the army of the James. ..
Minute details of the subsequent campaigns are
given in tbe accompany lag reports of the Lieuten
ant Genera) and outer distinguished commander*,*
so that nothing more than a cursory view er the
main results Is here required.
The antagonist armies of Meade and Leo met in
conflict near Mine n«n on the StndayofMay.
torty-ihret- days of desperau* fighting or marching
by day end night forced back Ino rebel army from
tbe Rapidan'to their Intrcnchmenis around Rich
mond, and carried tbe army of the Potomac to tbe
south side of the James mer. Tbe strength of
thoincaiy s lotwtthon the campaign opened, or
the extent of his loss, !■> not known'to this depart
ment. Any inequality of numbers between Lee's
army and the army of the Potomac was fully com
pensated by the advantage of position. Resolute
pun»v.««j»a desperate nUorw*** exhibited on both
sides. In Oien«tUM of the 'Wilderness. Spottsyl
vania Court House, JeiWho Foro, Havre's Shoo
and Cold Harbor, many brave soldUrj and gallant
officers perished. - Among them wo* ilrl'*. Geo.
Wadsworth,Brig.Gen. Hays,and MaJ.Gen!Sedg
wick. Lieut. Gen. Grant in his report oUerves:
“The battles of the Wilderness, SpoiUyivanlo,
North Anna, and Cold Harbor, bloody and Hrrible
as the; were on onr side, were even more damamgg
to the enemy, and so crippled him as to make u m
wary ever after of taking the offensive. UU losse*
in men were probably not so great, owing to the
fret that we were, save lu the Wiloemess, almost
invariably the attacking party, and when he did
attack,,lt was in tbe open odd.”
Although expectations of destroying Lee's army,
and tbe speedy capture of Richmond and Peters
burg, were disappointed, and the enemy bad found
refuge behind impregnable tonifications, the cam
paign was still prosecuted wita determined pur
pose towards tbe same object. While tho rebel
army was sheltered behind bis Intreucfaments the
national forces were busy at work outside strength
ening and advancing their position, breaking tho
communication of the enemy, cutting off and
destroying his supplle*, narrowing his limits, htr
rs.-lng him by raids, and occupying bis attention
to prevent detatebments or re-«o(orcements being
sent to operate elsewhere.
‘Active operations were also going on in the val
ley of the Shenandoah. On tbe first of May an ex
pedition. under Geos. Crook and Averin, was sent
out by Gen. tJlgcl, which reached Wytheville and
accomplished the destruction of much rebel prop
erty. Gen. Slgci advanced, on the 1 8th day of May,
with bis force, from Winchester to New Market,
where,met.by -the enemy under Geo. Breckin
ridge. be was defeated and tell back to Cedar Creek.
Qen. Hunter was then placed in command of tbe
aepaitmtnt. Do marched with a strong force to
wards Staunton, and in a brilliant engagement at
Piedmont defeated tho enemy with severe loss. Ad
vancing to Staunton, bo was joined there by Crook
asdAveriU, and moved against Lynchburg. Re
enforrements from the enemy having arrived before
him, Gen. Hunter retired by way of the Kanawha.
Meanwhile, in order to repair the losses ol tbe
Army of the Potomac, the thief part of the force
designed to guard the Middle Department and tbe
Department of Washington was called forward to
the front. Taking advantage of this state of aflh’rs,
in tbe absence of Gen. Hunter's command,
tbe enemy made a large detachment tram
their ’ army at Richmond, which, under
Gen. Early, moved down the Shenandoah valley,
threatening Baltimore and Washington. Their ad,
vuncc was checked atMonocacy, where a severe en
gagement was fought by our troops under Gen-
Wallace, reinforced"by a part ofthe 6th corps un
der Gen.-Ricketts. After this battle the enemy
continued to advance' until they reached intrench
ments around Washington. Here they were met
by troops from the army of the Potomac, consist
ing of tneCth corps, under Geu. Wright, a part of
theSthcorp, unacrGen. Glllmorc, and apart of
the 19th corps, just arrived from New Or
leans, under General Emory. .By these
troops the enemy were driven back from Washing
ton, and retreated hastily to VtrginlVporsued by
our forces under Gen. right.
On the Tib of August, TSC4, General Shendon was
placed In command of tbe military division com
prising the deportment of Washington, the deport
ment of West Virginia, the department ofthe Sus
quehanna. and the middle department. In two
great battles, at the crossinglof tho Opcqnon on the
Urth of September, and at FUher's Hill on the 22d
of September, the rebel army under Early was
routed and driven from the valley with immense
loss of’prleoners, an tilery, and stores. A desperate
effort was made by the enemy to recover their posi
tion. Early was strongly re-enforced, and on the
morning ofthe Wth of October, m the absence of
Gen. Sheridan, bis lines were surprised, his posi
tion turned, and nis forces driven back in confu
sion. At tbe moment when a great disaster was Im
pending, Sheridan appeared upon the field, the bat
tle was restored, and a brilliant victory achieved.
Tbe rented forces of tbe enemy were pursued to
Mount Jackson, where be arrived without an or
ganized regiment of bis army. All bis artillery and
thousands of prisoners fell mlo Sheridan's hands.
These successes closed military operations in the
Shenandoah valley, and a rebel fbrcc appeared there
no more during the war.
MsJ. Gen. William T. Sherman began the brilliant
scries of bis campaigns early in Mar. The first ob
jective point was Atlanta. To reach that point his
armies must pass from the northern limit to tbe
centre of the great- State of Georgia, forcing their
way through mountain defiles and across great riv
en*, overcoming or turning formidable Intrenched
positions defended by a strong, well-appointed vet
eran army, commanded by an alert, cautious and
skilful General. The campaign opened on the Ctb
day of May, and on the 2d day of September the
national forces entered Atlanta. This achievement
is thus described in Qen. Sherman's Field Order
No. 68:
“On the first of Mar onr armies were lying In
garrison seemingly quiet from Knoxville to Himts-
Tille. and our enemy lay behind his rocky-faced
harrier at Dalton, promt, defiant, and exalting, lie
had bad time since Christmas to recover from his
discomfiture on the Mission Ridge, with his ranks
filled and a new commander-in-chief, and second to
none in the confederacy in reputation for skill,
sagacity and extreme popularity. Ail at once oar
armies assumed life and action and appeared before
Dalton. Threatening Rocky Face we threw oar
selves upon Reeaca, ana the rebel army only es
caped by the rapidity of Us retreat, aided by the •
numerous roads with which he was femitlar, and
which were strange to ns. Again be took post In
Allatoona, hut we cave him no rest, and, oy onr
circuit towards Dallas and subsequent movement
to Acworth, we gained the Allatoona Pass. Then
followed the eventful battles about Kcuesaw.and
the escape of the enemy across the Chattahoochee
river.
“The crossing of the Chattahoochee and breaking
of the Augusta road was mos (.handsomely executed
by us, and will be studied as an example in the art
of war. Atthlaßtageofourgamcoarenemlesbe
camc dissatisfied with their old and skilful com
mander, and selected one more bold and rash. New
tactics were adopted. Uood first boldly and rap
idly, on the 80th of July, fell on our right at Pew*
Tree creek, and lost. Again, on the Bdd, he struck
our extreme left, and was severely punished; and
finally, again on thoSSth, he repeated the attempt
on onr right, and that time must have become sat
isfied for since that date he bos remained on the
defensive. We slowly and gradually drew our lines
about Atlanta, feeling for the railroad which sup
plied the rebel army and made Atlanta a place of
importance. , . ... .
“We must concede to oar enemy that be met
thr'c efforts patiently and skllmlly, bat at lost be
made the mistake wc had waited for so long, and
sent bis cavalry to our rear far beyond the reach of:
recall, instantly onr cavalry was on his only re
maining road, and we followed quietly with onr
principal army, and Atlanta fell into our
as the fruit of well-concerted measures, backed 'by
• a brave and confident army.”
For military reasons, stated in the report. 0 j uj e
lieutenant General, it was determined ta>'. Atlanta
should be dcttfojeo, and Sherman a posh
forward to Savannah or some other ■pomton the
Atlantic coast. ...
Shortly before the fall of Atlanta General John
ston had been superseded in cor.mamt of the rebel
army bv General Dood, who._ adopting adiffcrtnt
system from that pursued r,y nla cautious prede
cessor, boldly assumed offensive, with a view
to font? General bbennan (torn Georgia, by catting
off bij unnmraicitioat. and invading Tennwsee
and Kentucky. Pur-nant to this plan. Hood, by a
rapid march, gained and broke up, at Blgdbanrv,

tanted to Dillon, and thence moved towara Teu-
Dente. Hood was IbUowed from Atlanta br Gene*
tal' Sherman far enough north to corerhis otto
panae and imnre him aaainst Hood's interrnpt
fng me contemplated march to the sea-covst. Sher
man turned back suddenly to Atlanta. That city,
and all the railioada leading to it, were destroyed,
and on the 15th ot November the march com
menced for Savannah. Advancing In three

the capital of the State and other large
towns were occupied without resistance. Gen.
Sherman's command, on the 10th ot Deccmber.
“cloted jdod the enemy** works which covered
Savannah.” Fort McAllister was gallantly carried
by assault on the same day. The city of Savannah,
strongly fortified, and garrisoned by a large force
ender Gen. Ilarale, was summoned, bat surrender
was refused. Preparations for as-anlt were made,
and in the night of the 20th of December Hsrdie
evacuated the city, and, with a large part of his gar
rison, escaped under cover of darknees.

While General Sherman's army was marching
south from Atlanta to the sra-coast. the rebel army
under Eood. strongly reinforced, was movingnorih,
threatening Tennessee. Tbe task of encountering
.this formidable foe, and defending the BorderSiate*
tram invasion, was entrusted to Major General
George H. Thomas, who was ably assisted fby- bis
second in command. Major General Schofield. In
his report. General Tboma* says:
“I found myself confronted by the army which,
under General J. E. Johnston, had so skillfully re
fined the advance of the whole active army or the
military division of the Mississippi, from Dalton to
tho Chattahoochee, reinforced by a well-equipped
and enthusiastic cavalry command of over 12,000
men. ltd by one of tbe boldest and most successful
cavalry commanders in tne rebel army. My infor
mation from all sources confirmed the reported
strength stated ot Hood’s army to be from forty to
lorty five thousand In tan try. and from twelve to Of
teen thousand cavalry. My effective force at this
time consisted of the 4lh corps, about 12,000, under
Major Gen. D. b. Stanley; ?fae 33d corps, aixmt
10,UC0, under Major Gen. Schofield; llatcner’s divi
sion of cavalry, about 4,000; Croxton’s brigade,

Bridgeport, Huntsville, Decatur, and Cbatianooga,
to keep open oar communications and bold the
posts above named. If attacked, until they could be
reinforced, as np to this time it was Impossible to
determine which course Hood would take, advance
ou Nashville or torn towards Huntsville. Coder
these circumstances, it was manifestly best to act
on the dclensive until sufficiently reinforced rejus
tify taking the offensive, on the 12th of November
commonication with Gen. Sherman was severed,
the last despatch from Dim leaving Uartorsvllle,
Georgia, at £25 p. m. on that date. He had started
an'bia srea’ expedition from Atlanta to the sea
board, leaving me to guard Tennessee, or pur? uo the
enemy if he lollowea tbe Commanding General’s
column. 1c was, therefore, with considerable anx
iety that vve watched tho force at Florence, to dis
cover what course they would pursue with regard
to Gen. Sherman's movement*, determining there
by, whether the troops under my command, num
hi ring less than half those under Hood, were to act
on the defensive in Tennessee, or take the offensive
lu Alabama.”
When the possibility of Hood following Sherman
was over, General Thomas took measures to act on
the defensive. Reinforcements of new regiments
were burned forward to him by the Governors of
the Western £ lutes. All troops fit for any military
culy were collected and sent forward from the hos
pitals ; absentees on leave were called in; the em
ployes in the Quartermaster’s Department were
armed and organized. for doty in the retrench
ments, and two division* ot veteran infantry, nnder
command of General A. J. Smith, that had been
serving on the Rod rmr, and afterwards in Missou
ri, were pushed forward to General Thomas. By
these means bis forces were speedily swelled, when
concentrated, to on army hearty as large as that of
the enemy. Ibo public property and garreons were
drawn in from exposed conditions and points not
required to be held, the for till cations of Nashville
were strengthened, and every preparation was made
for a struggle ot no ordinary magnitude. Hood
advanced to Columbia, where bis attempt to cross
Duck cieek was checked tor a white by Gen
eral Schofield, who repulsed the enemy many
times with heavy loss. Schofield’? main
force in front -of Columbia was withdrawn
on the night of the Stub of November, and a
petition taken at Franklin on the morning of the
SUth. Here took place one of the most fierce and
bloody battles of the war. "The enemy,” says
General Thomas, mhis report, “ followed closely
after General Schoneld's rearguard in the retreat
to Franklin, and upon coming up to the main force
formed rapidly ana advanced to assault ourworks,
repeating attack after attack during the entire after
noon, ano as late as 10 p. m. his efforts to break onr
lines were continued. General Schofield’s position
was excellently chosen, with noth Hanks resting on
the river, and bis men firmly held their ground
against an overwhelming enemy, who was repulsed
In every assault along the whole line. Oar loss, as
given by General Schofield in his report, transmu
ted herewith, (and to which I respectfully refer,) is
ISO killed, LOSS wounded, and 1,104 ml-smg. ma
king an aggregate of 2,320. We captured and sent
to Nashville 70S prisoners, including one general
officer and 83 stands of colors. Maj. Gen. D. s. Stan
ley, commanding 4th corps,woa severely wounded at
Franklin while engaged m rallying a portion of his
command which bad bees temporarily overpowered
by an overwhelming attack or the enemy. At the
time of the battle toe enemy’s loss was known to
be severe, and was estimated at 5,0'0. The exact
figures were only obtained, however, on the re
occupation of Franklin by our force#, after the
battles of December 15 and IC, at Brentwood Hills,
ncarNasbvillc,aiidare given as follows: Buried
upon the field, 1,750; disabled and placed re hos
pital at Franklin, 3,800; which, with the 70S pris
oners already reported, makes an aggregate loss of
6.252, among whom were six general officers killed,
six wounded, and one captured. The important re
sults ot this signal victory cannot be too highly
appreciated; for it not onlr seriously checked the
enemy’s advance, and gave General Schofield time
to remove bis troop? and aQ bis property to Nash
ville, hut it also caused deepdepression among the
men of Hood’s army, waking them doubly cautious
in ibelr subsequent movements.”
On the night after the battle ol Franklin, Gen
eral Schofield, by the direction of Gci eral Thomas,
fell Itaclc to Nashville, tn front of which city, on the
heights, a line ot battle was formed by noon of the
Ist of December. Hood’s army appeared before
Nashville on the fid of December. The intense
severity oi the weather prevented operation# for
several days. Both armies were icebound fora
week previous to the 14th of December, when tbs
weather moderated, and General Thomas, having
completed bis preparations, issued order# for bat
tle tne ensuing day. At an earl" bear on the mom
lig of the loth ol Decern oer -- '* Thomas
moved against Hood’s army. laa ..as fun
ouj-ly contested antll nigblthll. “the total result
was the capture of sixteen pieces of artillery and
J,Sooprisoners, besides several hundred stands of
smalt arms and about forty wagons. * The enemy
bad been forced back at all points, with heavy loss,
sud onr casualties were unusually light. Th*be
havior of ibo troops was unsurpassed for s'eadincaa
and alacrity In every movement,and the original plan
of battle, vrim bat f«w alterations, was strictly ad
hered to. The nho'e command bivouacked In line
of. battle during the night on the ground occupied
at dark, while preparations were nudo to renew the
battle at an early hour on the morrow.”
The buttle was renewed on the ICth, at 6 o'clock
in the morning. At 3 o’clock in the aflernooa, too
enemy'* puong position on Overton's lIUI was aa
eauiudhythp Fourth Corps. -Immediately fol

fusion through the Brentwood Pass the Fourth
Corps in a close pontile, whLh was combined for
several miles, when darkness closed the sccoe, and
the troops rented from their labors. Poring the
two days’ operations there were 4,1(13 prisoners
captured, including 287 officers of all grades from
lba( of Major General, flfty-threc pieces of artillery,
and thousands of small arms. The enemy aban
doned on the field all of his dead and wounded.”
;AtthetattleofNashvUlcUood’s army, which at ]
on<\time was considered the beat drilled and most 1
lormidable rebel lorce set on foot daring the war. 1
disappeared as anartny organization. Commanded !
successively by Bragg, Johnston, and Hood, many
bloody fields proved the courage of the soldiers and
the skill of its commanders. The shattered frag
ments ot this army were pursued from Nashville
to the Tennessee river by tne main forces of Gen.
Thomas, and were followed and harassed for two 1
hundred miles by detached commands. In bis re
port Gen. Thomas remarks: -To CoL Palmer and
his command is accorded the credit of giving
Hood's army the list blow of the campaign, a: a
distance of over two bandied miles from whore,wo
first struck the enemy on the 15tn of December,
near Nashville.” What troops escaped from the
pursuit were afterward united with otuet fragments
of rebel forces under Gen. Johnston, ami finally
laid down their arms to »Gen. Sherman at Raleigh.
While the events that have been mentioned were
transpiring in the main armies, other military ope
rations of less magnitude, hut contributing to the
general result by harassing and weakening the ene
my, were in progress. A large rebel force, under
John Morgan, invaded Kentucky, and was defeated
by Gen. Barbndee in a severe engagement at Cyn
(hiana on the 12ut day of June. John Morgan was
surprised and kilted, and his staff captured by Gen.
Gilicm on the 4th day of September, IS&J. in the
month of November a rebel expedition, under
Breckinridge, Duke and Vaughn, was repulsed by
Gen. Ammon, and driven from Hast Tennessee. An
expedition, under Gen. Sioneman and Gen. Bur
bridge. penetrated to Saltvlllc, in Southwestern Vir
ginia, destroyed the works at that place, broke np
the railroads, and indicted great destruction upon
the enemy’s supplies and communications.
Alter the withdrawal ot our troops from the Bed
river, a large rebel force advanced under Sterling
Piieemto Kansas, and penetrated thence into the
department of tne Missouri. But tney were at
length driven back with neavy loss.
Other military operations, of greater or less mag
nitude, Oicurrcd during the rear—some attended
with disaster, some with brilliant success. Of the
former class were Kilpatrick’s raid against Rich
mond. the capture of Plymouth and its garrison, at
toe commencement of the year, by the rebels under
Hoke; the defeat of the expedition irom Memphis,
under Gen. Sturgis; the capture of Fort Pillow by
Chalmers and Forrest; and Stoneman’s expedition
to AndcrsonvfUc. On the other bond, the raids of
Gricrcon from Memphis, in December, ofMoneman
and Burbndgo Into Virginia, of 'Wilson into Ala
bama, indicted sore distress upon the enemy, and
brought the rebels to a solemn sense of the snCfer
lugs caused to themselves by the war they had on
'dertaken against their government.
At the commencement of the year 1665 all hearts
wete more anxious than ever to bring the war to a
speedy close. Every preparation to that end was
moueoy the department, and by the military com
. moadera in the held. Adequate appropriations
were voted and new popular loans authorized by
Congress-- Further, measures lor recrnittng'tho
army, prompted by experience, were enacted. A
new drain for half a million ot men was pat-into
prompt execution. The State executives renewed
their labots In calling lor volunteers. The people
responded to the demands of the occasion, and
rapid recruitment began in all the States, and was
at its height when Richmond tell. Troops were al
that time being raised, organized, armed and 1
equipped as fast aa they could bo conveniently
transported to the field. To the coming
through the Caro Unas and In Virginia all Qv es
looked for a speedy and decisive result that ah' ja td
end the war. The military position is thus 'stated
by the Lieutenant General:
-In March, 1£65, General Canby was an
adequate farce against Mobile, and defend
ing it, under General Dick, Taylor; nomas was
pushing oat two large and.weli appo’imed cavalry
expeditions—one from Middle Tennessee,’ under
Brevet Major General Wilson, eguirjt the enemy’s
vital points in Alabama; the otbev from East Tenn
essee, under Major General f'jtoneman,. towards
Ljncbbnrg—and assembling ‘the remainder of his
available forces, preparatory to offensive operations
from East Tennessee; Ueorjaj Sheridan’s, civalry
was al White House; the armies of the Potomac
and James were enemy under Lee
in his defences ol Blchrr on 3 and Petersburg; Gcn-
vnth hi', armies, re-enforced by that
of General Schofield, was at Goldsboro’; General
Pope was making 'preparations for 4 spring cam

The active operations ol ISSS began with the re--
dnetion of Fon Fisher, by a combined espedition
of land and naval force*. Thgport of Wilmington,
North Carolina, during the whole war, has been *•
principal point ot foreign trade with the rebels.
Tne advantage ofits position defied the most rig
orous blockade, end, after (be fall ot Savannah, it
was the only gate through which’ foreign supplies
could pass to the rcte'a. The atroagwork* and gar
ri'cnoi Fort Fisher, at the mouth of Cape Fear
river, were the mam defence of Wilmington. On
the I3ib ofDeeembera force of about 6,500 men,
under Major General Bailer, started from Fortress
Monroe to operator in conjonetlon with a naval force
under Admiral Porter, against Fort FDher. General
Boiler ejected a landing on tho 23th of December,
bat re-embarked oa the 37th, and retarned with his
troops to fortress Monroe. Tbe Lieutenant Get
enl ordered the enterprise to be ’renewed by Gen
eral Terry, who, on the Sd of January, was placed
in command of the same troop?, with a re-Inforce
ment that made the whole number about eight
(bossacd. On the morning of tbe 13tb of January
the troops were disembarked, under cover of a
heavy effective trv from the fleet. An asssnlt was
made in the afternoon of the loth of January, and
after desp c rare bana-to-band fighting for »jveral
hours,the works were carried, the enemy driven oar,
and about midnight the whole garrison, with i(s
commacder. General Whiling, surrendered. Tbe
fall of Fort Fisher carried with it tho otherdefescc*
of Cape Fear river. Fort Caswell and the works'on
Smith** island fell Into our hands on tbe DUh and
17tli. Fort Audeisuu oa thelUib,and, General Scho
field advancing, tho enemv were driven from Wil
mington on (he 2lst of February.
harly in tbe month ol January MaJ. Gen. Sher
man, having refil led his army, entered npon hl«
campaign from Savannah, through .the Stales of
South Carolina and North Carolina, the incidents
of uaichare detailed in hUaccompanying report.
Its retrain* thus staled In his special Field Order
No. T«:
"Waiting at Savannah only loot: enough to fill
onr again began a march, which, for peril,
labor and results, will compare with any ever made
bv an organized aimy. Thu floods of the Savannah,
the swamp? or the Combahec and Ealsto, the ’high
hills’ and rocks ot the sau»ee. the flat quagmires of
tne Feoec and Cape Fear rivers, were all passed in
mid-winter, wfib its Hoods and rains, m the face of
an accumulating enemy; and after the battles of
Avcrysboro’ and Benlonville, we ono* more came
out of the wilderness to.meet our friends at ooids
borongh. Keen then we paused only long enough
(o yet new clothing, to reload oar wagons, and
ae&ln push on to Raleigh and beyond, until we met
our enemy suing for peace instead of war, and oiler-
Inc to submit to the injured laws of bis and our
country.”
The operations in Gen. Canby’s military division
also exercised an important Influence at this junc
• oxe. Alter the disaster upon the Ued river, a
change of the military, organization west of the
Mississippi was made to meet the emergency. The
departments of Arkansas and the Galfr including
Lout-tana and Texas, were nailed in ouemllliary
division—West Mississippi, coder command of
Maj. Gen. Canby. Ills extorts were directed to the
organisation and concentration of the forces and
material within bis division, and in measures to
prevent me rebel troops wesiol the Mississippi
ircm re-eniorcing the armies operating east of tout
river. -In the month of July Fort Gaines. Fort
FowelL and Fort Morgan, constituting important
defences of Mobile bay, were reduced by a com
bined movement of land forces, under Gen. Gordon
Granger, detached by Gen. Canby, and co-operating
with a naval force under Admiral Farrugut. Early
in the spring of ISC3 a large force, nnder Gens. A.
J. Smith, Gordon Gianger and F. Steele, was di
rected against the city ot Mobile. The enemy were
driven out of Spanish Fort'by bombardment, Fort
Blakely was taken byassaolt,aod the city of Mobile
was evacuated by the enemy on the Min of ApnL
The brilliance or these achievement# has been over
shadowed by the grander scale of operations in
other -quarters, but their skill and success arc
worthy of high admiration. After the fall of Sa
vannah. Charleston and Wilmington, the enemy
bad placed bis last hopes on retaining a foothold in
ths cotton States at Mobile. It was strongly forti
fied ana garrisoned, and orders were Issued to hold
it at every hazard.
In the taiterpart of February Gen. Sheridan, un
der direction of the Lieutenant General, moved
from Winchester to Staunton, which place he cap
tured on the 2d of March, talcing prisoners artillery
and military stores. He thence moved on to
Charlottesville, and destroyed the Richmond ft
Lynchburg Railroad, and the nrfdges across the
Kivanna river. Dividing his forces, one column
moved to Mew Market, and destroyed
the James river canal; the other column
poshed toward Lynchburg, destroying the railroad
to A inhere! Court House. These columns, re
tmlling, moved to the White House, on the Pa
monkey, effecting great destruction ol the canal on
their route, and thence pul themselves in communi
cation with the forces around Richmond.
The month of March, 1565, opened the great cam
paign against Richmond and tne army that had so
long del ended the rebel capital.
Instruction* were riven by the Lieutenant (Gen
eral on the 2-lth of March for a general movement
of the national forces around Richmond. It com
menced on the morning of the 29tb of March. Ten
days* marching and fighting finished the campalgn

his so-called Confederate Gorermnent were furi

mond in the afternoon of Sunday, the 2d day of
April. The national forces occupied Petersburg
and entered Richmond Monday morning. Lee's
army was pursued nnul it reached Appomattox
Court House, where on Sunday, the uth day of
April, it laid down its arm* on the terms pre
, scribed by General Grant.
brom thi- period the bistory of the war is but an
enumeration of surrenders by rebel com
manders. On tbe 26th day ol April Gen. Johnston
surrendered hla command to MeJ. Gen. Sherman,
at Raleigh. North’Carolina. Gen. Howell Cobh,
with twelve hundred militia and five General*, anr
rendered to Gen. Wilson, at Macon, Georgia, on tbe

May; surrendered all the remaining rebel forces
east of the Mississippi to Gen. Canby. On the Uth

captured *t_ Irwinaville, Georgia. On the 2tsth of
May, Ucn. Kirby Smith surrendered bis cadre com

was planted again upon Fort Sumter, under the or
ders of tbe President, by the hands of General An
derson, with appropriate military and naval care

the Rev. Henry Ward Beecbcr.
'lheir victorious campaigns ended, the armies of
the Tennessee and tbe Cumberland and the army
oC the Potomac marched through Richmond lathe
federal capital, where they w'ere reviewed by the
President and the distinguishedcommanders under
whom they bad so long and so gallantly served In
the field. Alter this national ceremony, they and
their Jellow-eoldicra in other commands were-paid,

country; and. re turning to their homes in the

and rejoicings of a pratefni people.
One otbcz event may properly be noticed In this
report as a past of the military history of tho rebel
lion. While our armies, by their gallantry and
courage and the skill of their commanders, were
overcoming all reswancc In the field to toe national
authority, a swift and sndden blow was aimed at
the national existence and at tho life of the com
roandcMn-chief of tbe anny and navy, which, for

Tbe destruction of the rebel military power
opened the way to re-establish civil government In
tho Insurgent States. From that period the func
tions of the military department became simpivco
opemtive with other tbrancbea ol the Federal Gov
ernment.
-Nashville. Tennessee, was the first capital of an
'insurgent btate in which the Federal authority was
re-established. The rebel army was driven out on
the 2Sd da; of February, IKS, and tine city occu
pied by (be Uoton forces. On the Sd day of March,
1862, Andrew Johnson, then Senator in Congress
from the Stats of Terjcssee— the only Senator from
an insurgent Slate who retained bin scat in Con
gress—was appointed military governor of the State
of Tennessee, He accepted tne appointment, and
promptly entered upon bfs dudes, and continued to
exercise thr m nntll bis resigns! ton on ibe 3d day of
March. IKjs. In all the vicissitudes of the war bis
administration was directed to the establishment
sod maintenance of the Constitution and laws of
the r Jnited States wltMn and over the State of Ten
nises. Without entering upon details, it la suffi
cient to remark that extension of civil authority
kept pace with the reduction ot the rebel power.
The Federal courts were opened, and justice admin
istered. Under bis direction, against many discour
agements and ranch opposition, great advance was
made toward the full re establishment of civil au
thority. and the restoration of the State to Its prac
tical relations to the Federal Government. He is
sued a proclamation on the 6lh of January, 1501, for
the election of township and county officers, justices
of the peace, constables, trustees, shenffii, clerks,
registers, and tax collectors. In tbo month or May
a convention wa» held at Knoxville, East Tennessee,
to devise measures for restoring civil government
in the titate. In the montn of August another con
vention was called, to meet at Nashville on
the sth •of September. to reorganize the
Stats. A full convention being prevented by the
condition of military affaire, this body recommend
ed that another convention, • k elected by the loyal
people,” should assemble af an early day to revise
tbo btate Constitution. The Governor leaned a
proclamation on Ibe 7th of September, announcing
that he should proceed to appoint officers and estab
lish tribunal* “In all the counties and districts of
the State whenever the people gave evidence of loy
alty and a desire for civil government, and a will
ingness *o sustain the officers and tribunals.” A
convention was called to meet on the Oth oi Janu
ary. 1£ 65, at Nashville, to revise pie State Constitu

State Constitution were adopted, slavery was abol

These measures have been carried into-dfect from
time to time.as the exigencies of the service wonM
admit. It will b« seen from the report of the Ad
jutant General that troops to the number of 800 063
have already be«a mustered, paid off, and disband,
ed. Fmlherreducrioa is contemplated. Upon the
discharge of troops, the service* of a great nomoer
of ataiT, Held and general officers were ho longer re
quired. Of these, some have resigned, and others
were honorably mustered oat. No doubt in many
Instances It baa been pamfol for gallant and accom-
Elbtcd officers to leave that service to which they
avebeen accustomed, and woere they have woe
honorable di-tfnctloo. Bat It I* to the credit of the
volunteer service <i«t they have recognised the*
obligation of the government to reduce (bo military

was the Inclination of the department to retain Ir in .

heerniung to fill the regular’ regiment* has con

missions, hitherto, have been conferred only br
promotion from the ranks. But to fccore tho re
quisite number of competent officers, alvumlhia
hero appointed to examine applicmis and deter
mine their relative merit. From the Hat selected
by the board, and ht tbe order of meric, appoint
ments are to be made. Two years* actual service
in the war is indispensable for appointment,
Tbe establishment of a weh-orgmized militia
system is one ot the most important subject* tMt
vvul demand 'he attention ot congress. This sub
ject ha* already received careful consideration, and.
It Is believed that, after conference with the appro
priate committees, a practical system may be
agreed upon.
Measures for the establishment of homes,
seme provision* for the aid and relief of wounded
aid disabled soldiers, is also a subject, that will
comiuiiiu liscit strongly to every patriotic heart-
Whether this duty, which the country owes to
patriot* who have suffered In the national defence,
can best be performed by the national Government
or administered br the respective biato authorities,
and whether relief can best be afforded bv an ht
crecse of pension, or by establishing homes, are
points on which opinion* ditfer, end which can only
be settled by the wirdom of Congress.
The board of Visitors to the Military Academy
at West Point, u June last, made an cbthoraie re
port, which 1* herewith submitted. The? recom
mend a reorganization, and a number of mrasurta
which, iu their ooiulon, will enhance the benefits of
that national instilmlon. To these thoattemion of
Gosgres* Is respectmilv rovited, tilth the r oom
mendatton thus the number of cadets be increased
a« recommended, amt that tbe superintendence of
the institution bo no loeger confined 10 the Engi
neer Unrean. It i> believed that the Military Arad
era v b at present well conducted, and mat their re
sponsible duties are efficiently performed by tbe of
ficers, professor* and instructors charged with the
institution.
The war appropriations at tbe lavt session of
Congress, as hits keen stated, amounted to the aua
0f*516,tM0,151.7U. The estimates for the next fiscal
year, commencing June 30,1805, are *£LSll,4fil.&L
These estimates arc Based upon a standing force
of fifty thousand men, so organised aa to admit of
an increase, without additional organizations, to
f-lhCtO troop# of all arms.
1 bis estimate bus been made after conference and
careiul consideration, and is believed to be ad
equate for any national exigency, if the country
should te blessed with pence, ibo reduction of
the national military force, in Its rapidity and num
bers, is w linoot example, and if there be auy alarm,
in the public mind becau>e this reduction is rm.ii.
while grave questions at home ana abroad are un
settled. a brief consideration of the subject will
show that there Is no cause for apprehension.
Ibe force to be retained is small compared with
that which was organized to subdue the rebellion.
But the only reasons demanding greater force are
I-f, renewal of the insurrection; fid, a foreign war.
For either or both emereencic# tbe national re
sources remam ample. ibochlefdemandsforwar
as shown by onr experience, are, Ist, troops; fidl
aims and ammunition; So. clothing; Jtb, trans
portation; and sth, subsistence supplies.
Tbe troops dlsoended were cbteily volunteer',
who went to the field to uphold the system of free
government established by their Dithers, and which
they mean to bequeath to Ihcir children. Tuelr
tons and Eufiennus, their marches, battles, and vic
tories, have not diminished the vame of that Gov
ernment to them; so that any new rebellion would
encounter equal or greater force for its reduction;
and none can ever spring op with such advantages
at tbe start, or be conducted with superior
means, ability, or prospect of success. A
foreign war would ntiensifr the national feel
ing. and thousands, once misled, would rejoice
to atone their error by rallying to tbe national flag.
Tbe question of time to which armies could be
raised to quell insurrection or repel Invasion Is,
therefore, the only question relating to troop*. Our
experience In this point is significant. When Lee’s
army (utreudered, thousand* of recruits worepoai"
leg In. and men were discharged from recruiting
station* and rendezvous in every Stale. On several
occasions, when troops were prompllv needed to
aveit impending disaster, vigorous exertion brought
them Into the field from remote State#, with Incred
ible speed. Official reports show that after the
disasters on tbe Peninsula, in ISGfi, over eighty
thousand troops were enlisted, organized, armed,
equipped and sent into the field m less im" %
mouth. Sixty thousand troops have repeatedly
gone to the field within four weeks. And ninety
thousand infantry were sent to the armies, from tbe
five States of Ohio, Indiana, Hlmois, lowa, and
Wisconsin, within twenty days.
W Len the rebellion commenced, the nation was
a stranger to war. Officers had Utile experience,
privates bad none. But the present generation of
men inthis country are now veteran soldiers. For
the battle, tbe march, or the siege, they are already
trained, they areas much at home in the tented
field asm tbe farm boose, the manufactory, or Ibo
stop. No time is required to train them; and the
speed of tbe rallrcad and telegraph determines tho
time required to raise an army in the United States,
Second. As to arms and ammunition. The dis
banded armies were allowed to lake home their
aims at a nominal price. Rul 19 not likely to
gaihtron Hie musket or sabre borne through the
campaigns of lfcG4 and iSdJ. The government re
tains m its arsenals more than a mmloo of the beat
: quality The ai [Tilery 00
band ta-ks the department lor Its means of glor
ogc. The manufacture of ammunition requires
ttiiiuld lor which w« hare m some degree relied
upon other countries. Because they could be had
cheaper. For this reason, and togmudacidiMlanr
mischance, three years’stock of material tor am
munition baa already been kept in store, and tbe
supply on bond is ample for any war that can bo
waged against ns by any nation.
'Jhiid. Clothing, transportation, and subsistence.
Alter sellliu; or distributing among ftcedmcn and
refugees all damaged or Irregular clothing, me
stock of clothing and material m the quartermas
ter's depots is suihdcnl for any armies* that may be
called tnto service. The water lian*ports and roll
ing stock, mules wagons and horses held by tbe
Government were adequate to the movement
supply of larger forces, m le-s time, ihm bcie
totorebem known in .tar. The Government tus
disposed Or is disposing of this transportation, bub
it remains in this country, and can answer any exi
gency.
Array subsistence Is derived from tbe country In
which military operations are canted on, or sup
plied Iran other markets. During toe war Hus
most vital branch of the service never ihlled. It
answer? to tbe demand, and !s ever ready to meet
Ihe national demand.
It Is plan), therefore, that the abundance of our
means for war enables tbe Government of tbe Unit
ed States to reduce the standing force to a lower
degree than any other nat ion. Unless war be actu
ally raging, tbe military force can be brought within
very narrow limits. However suddenly the exigen
cy calling for an exhibition* of military power it
can ne promptly met. With our education, habits,
and expeneuca, the nation, while In the midst of
peace, is prepared for war.
