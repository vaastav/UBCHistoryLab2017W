THE TIMES.
PORT TOBACCO, MD.,
Friday, Dec. 15, 1871.
Illnes* mf the Prince of 'Wale*.
The condition of the Prince of Wales, who
kfca been at the point of death for the past
two weeks, is, by the latest advices, unchang
ed. His disease is typhoid fever and its symp
toms exhausting from the first. The political
consequences of the Prince's death—of which
we may bear at any moment—it is impossible
fully to foresee. The Queen is old, infirm in
health and cannot in the course of nature live
many years longer. The Prince's son, now
eight years old, is the next heir. In the
event of the Prince's death a long Regency
will be inevitable. In the meantime repub
licanism is making rapid strides throughout
tba whole country and it is not improbable
that the present generation will witness tbe
entire abolition of monarchy and tbe estab
lishment upon its ruins of a distinct form ol
government, founded upon purely republican
principles.
Trial of Mr*. Wharts*.
The trial ef Mrs. E. O. Wharton for the
murder by poison of Geo. Ketchum,still pro
gresses slowly at Annapolis. So far, tbe evi
dence for tbe State clearly discloses tbe fact
that tbe death of tbe unfortunate old gentle
man resulted from tbe administration of tartar
emetic, bat, ae yet, fails directly to connect
tbe prisoner with its administration. The
theory, however, that death resulted from an
over dose of laudannm was effectually dispos
ed of ou Wednesday by tbe testimony of the
druggist, Mr. Rogers, whose name was on the
label of the vial alleged to have been found
in tbe bed occupied by tbe deceased. Great
Interest in the proceedings is still manifested,
notwithstanding tbe tedious and slow charac
ter of the proceedings, especially during the
examination of tbe medical and chemical ex
perts. Various opinions are expressed as to
the result, but it is, we believe, generally con
ceded, up to this writing, that tbe State has
not yet made out its case strong enough to
warrant conviction. However, many wit
nesses are yet to be examined, and it is doubt
less too soon for the expression of any dear
and decided opinion. To-day (Friday) is tbe
eleventh day, and it is not unreasonable to
expect that tbe trial is not more than half
Ibrongh.

wooded parts of tbe county they experienced

(be country through which they have passed
advantageous for grading and tbe construction
of a cheap road. On the completion of this

Baltimore and Potomac Railroad.
We copy the following from tbe Frinee
Georgian of last week:
As a most substantial evidence of tbe pro
gress of tbe railroad, our enterprising friend,
John W. Belt, Esq., of Oak Grove, ou Thurs
day last, received a cargo of goods from Bal
timore per rail. It is true be bad to haui
them a few miles ; but this was a small mat
ter compared to the former inconvenience of
receiving goods by tbe old routes. We chron
icle this evidence of tbe progress of the road
and tbe energy of our young friend of Oak
Grove with sincere pleasure, and trust the day
is not far distant when we shall have tbe
pleasure of bearing the snort of tbe iron horse
ki our midst. Just now, while this culd-snap
lasts, bis presence would be a God-send, as
(be river is blocked from shore to shore with
Iceland our merchants, we fear, will be com
pelled to wagon their Christmas Goods over
from Washington. We*have tbe further gra
tifying intelligence that the rails on the Wash
ington Branch has been laid to tbe Anacostia
Bridge.
“•A Bachelor Gone Up.”
So says the Salisbury (Md.) Bachelor of
last week, which comes to us with head up
turned and matter displaced, and otherwise
exhibiting unmistakeable signs that “some
disturbing element bad been at work in tbe
office.” On examination we find that one of
tbe editors bad taken unto himself a rib—bad
himself fallen in the snare “of which he had
jn vehemently warned others to beware.”—
After all, it seems our Bachelor friends are
“making much ado about nothing.” One
more unfortunate baa joined tbe noble army
of martyrs, that’s all. We advise that other
Baehdor editor “to go and do likewise.” “A
home divided against itself " we know “can
sot stand,” and when be has “done tbe deed”
we suggest tbe name of their valuable journal
he changed to Benedict.

THE PORT TOBACCO TIMES AND CHARLES COUNTY ADVERTISER. FRIDAY. DECEMBER 15. 1871.
The Apportionment Bill. *
The House of Representatives one day last
week considered the Apportionment bill in
troduced at tbe last session. This hill makes
the total nnmber of Representatives 281, a
ratio of one member for every 134,957 of the
population. By this arrangement but few of
tbe old States lose in the number of their
Representatives, while nearly all tbe new and
growing ones make large gains. This table
exhibits the number allotted each State under
the existing apportionment, as well as that
under the proposed bill:
os;. os;

Ohio 19 19l
The State making the greatest gain is Illi
nois, which has five. Pennsylvania under
this apportionment is allotted only two new
members, and New York one. The largest
proportion of gain is represented in the West.
All or nearly all tbe old slave States gain one
each, which is mainly attributable to colored
suffrage. Under the old apportionment the
representation given for the slave or colored
population was only about half what it is
under suffrage.
Inauguration of a Mission.
We give in another column an article from
a correspondent of the New York World in
reference to the missionaries to the negroes in
this country. These missionaries have just
arrived in Baltimore, and the ceremony o'
receiving them took place at St. Francis Xa
vier Church, in that city, on last Sunday even
ing, A large congregation was assembled,
the clergymen present in addition to the
missionaries being Most Rev. Archbishop
Spalding, Rev. Dr. O’Conner, S. J., formerly
Bishop of Pittsburgh, and Rev. Father Miller,
S. J., pastor of St. Francis Church. The
missionaries are Rev, Cornelius Dowling, Jas.
Gore, James Noonan and Charles Wigneont.
who are accompanied by Very Rev. Dr.
Vaughan, Superior of St. Joseph’s Mission
College, Mill Hill, Middlesex. England. Af
ter vespers had been sung Archbishop Spald
ing ascended tbe platform in front of the altar,
and introduced the above mentioned priests,
whom he said bad been sent to this country
by tbe Pope to labor in the Church among
the colored people. The Rev. Dr. Vaughan
at the conclusion of tbe Archbishop’s remarks
stated that tbe college of which he was supe
rior bad only been recently founded, and a
number of young men who had completed
their studies bad been directed by the Pope
to proceed to this country as missionaries a
mong the colored people, principally in the
Southern States. After some correspondence
they had concluded, at the suggestion of
Archbishop Spalding, to come to Baltimore,
with a view of establishing a mission in the
lower part of this State. Eor the present tbe
centre of the mission will be at St. Francis
Church, and in a short time it is expected to
extend it to all parts of the country. The
services were concluded with tbe benediction
of tbe blessed sacrament.
Sire In 'Hagerstown.
On Thursday night of last week a fire broke
out in Hagerstown, Washington county, des
troying the Episcopal Church, Court House,
and many valuable business bouses. One
man lost bis life by the falling of the Court
House dome. All the public records were
saved. The origin of the fire is not known.
The Court House was not insured and will be
a heavy loss to the county.
S6T*The downward tendency of gold and
tbe resumption of specie payments was talk
ed over on Tuesday in Washington by the
House Committee on Banks and Currency,
and a sub-committee will be appointed to
take into consideration specie payments, but
it is not probable that action in the premises
will be taken by tbe entire committee until
after tbe holidays. It matters but little, how
ever, how fast gold tumbles, as the price of
living is kept up as high as during war times,
and it will be a long while before the middle
men come down to tbe prices of 1859.

•fly The New York Internationalists fret
ted somewhat over the furbiddal of their pro
posed funeral parade and demonstration on
Sunday in memory of the Communists exe
cuted by tbe French Government, but sub
mitted to the orders of the authorities. A
number of them assembled at tbe Cooper In
stitute, but made no attempt to parade.—
They claim that many of their members can
not make an appearance in tbe lines on any
day bat Sunday, and consequently protest a
gainstffce interference with their plans.
fIQTRev. John F. W. Ware preached a
sermon last Sunday night, at Ford’s Opera
Honse, in Baltimore, to a very large and re
spectable audience, on “Swindlers and Swin
dling.” In the course of his address he said:
“Our whole political system has degenerated
into a swindle. They say men must get de
filed if any touch it. Frauds everywhere,
from primary elections all tbe way through.
We talk about tbe ballot, tbe trial by jury,
tbe safeguards of tbe people, and we tickle
ourselves with our fancied liberties. Why,
dear friends, nothing is free. We have been
! swindled out of our liberties.”
Supreme Court Decision.
The U. 3. Supreme Court ia.- rendered aj
decision in the case of Ward vs. State of Ma
ryland. Error to the Court of Appeals of
Maryland. In this case the plaintiff in error
was indicted iu the State Court for violating
the statute against sales by sample by non
residents without license, and the Court af
firmed the right of the State to exact the
license. This Court hold that the statute of
Maryland is a violation of that clause of the
Constitution which guarantees to the citizens
of each State all the rights, privileges, &c. f ol
oitizens in the several States, and is therefore
j void. But the view is taken that it is not a
! violation of the commercial clause of the Con
stitution if the tax on residents and nonresi
dents is equally laid. Mr. Justic# Clifford
I delivered the opinion of the Court. Mr. Jus-
I lice Bradley concurred in the opinion as to the
fir>t branch of the decision, but dissented as
to the second, holding that the statute is a
violation of the commercial clause of the Con
stitution because it is a regulation of com
merce between the States, and that it is re
pugnant to this clause of the Constitution,
without regard to the equality of the tax.
Jt@*The defalcation in the Treasury De
partment, in the case of Marden, has develop
ed other frauds of heavy sums of money, and
tbe books show that by means of abstraction
at different periods, within about two years,
an amount of over $50,000 has been stolen
from the government In the cash room of the
Treasury, the offenders being Marden and
Seth Johnson, interest teller. The discovery
of Marden’s guilt led the way to the discove
ry of Johnson's crime. The latter, it is said,
has been dealing in gold and stuck
tions, and has been losing for sometime. —
There does not seem to have been any""coll u
sion between the two, and it appears that
neither knew of the crime of the other. Mar
den and Johnson have both been arrested.
&®*The bill introduced by Senator Ed
munds provides that all appointments of civil
officers except Postmasters and such officers
as are by law required to be appointed by the
President, shall be made from those persons
who shall have been found best qualified for
the performance of the duties of the offices to
which such appointments are to be made in
an open and competitive examination.
BST’Senator Trumbull, it is expected, will
introduce in the Senate a resolution proposing
to raise a joint committee of the two houses,
with power to investigate all public offices, to
see what can be abolished, what expenditures
reduced, what steps can be.taken to prevent
tiie use of federal patronage for political pur
poses, and, iu a word, to inaugurate reform
in every branch of the service. We hope
some good may come out of this.
ftSTlu reference to a suggestion in the
President’s Message, the Washington Patriot
says: “In a criminal prosecution against an
American citizen for owning an estate with
slaves in Cuba, where is the jury to come
from 7 He is entitled, sys the Constitution,
to a trial by an impartial jury of the Stale
and district where the crime shall have been
committed.”

ed the Atlanta (Ga.) Sun newspaper, out and

duty by a clamorous rejection of the Missouri
passive policy.
The mission to the Blacks.
From the London correspondent of the
World we learn that the four missionaries who.
are en route for Maryland, to labor for the
mental and moral elevation of the black race
iu our midst, are Fathers Dowling, 1 G-re,
Noonan and Vigneront. The World’s cor
respondent speaks of these Kev. Fathers as
priests of “high culture, great learning and
personal refinement,” and he goes on to say.
that they are of “the metal out of which
martyrs and saints are made.” #
“They'are tbe the vanguard," the writer
continues, “of a body of Roman Catholic
priests who have received from the propagan
da at Rome the special and-exclusive missi n
of converting to the Roman Catholic lairh the
whole black popnlaiion of the United States
—who have bound themselves by a solemn
and irrevocable vow to make themselves until
death ‘the fathers and servants of the blacks’
—who will be followed ere long by forty other
priests who are now preparing themselves for
the same work, and who have already been
given, by the Archbishop of Baltimore, a
house and grounds for the headquarters of the
mission. Great streams from little fountains
flow ; large oaks from little acorns grow ; we
are admonished by high authority, not to des
pise the day of small things. The four priests
who sail to-day will sown be followed by for
ty; the forty perhaps ere long will be rein
forced by four hundred, and the four hundred
may finally be swelled to four thousand.—
Every one knows that when the Roman Cath
olic Church once gets a foothold anywhere she
never loses it; and those who have studied the
matter also know that tbe peculiar machinery
with which that church works enables her to
accomplish very great works with a very
small expenditure of money. The four mis
sionaries, for instance, who will soen begin
their work in Maryland, take with them neith
er wives nor children, and scarcely two cats.
It won’t cost much to keep them—their wants
will be of the fewest and tbe simplest, and,
without exaggeration, they will have nothing
to do or think of but the work in which they
will engage. It there are those in America
who are unwilling to look forward to the
prospect of seeing the black population con
verted to Catholicism within the next quarter
of a century, I warn them that they must be
up and doing. F<t Rome has made up her
mind to win the five millions of American
blacks to herself; and I should not be sur
prised at her success.”
In his address to the four missionaries on
tbe occasion of their departure from England,
Archbishop Manning, according, to the World
correspondent, spoke as follows:
“More than a thousand years ago. an Eng
lish monk, St. Boniface, had gone forth from
bis cloister aud made himself the apostle of
Germany; but the present was the first occa
sion upon which the R >mau Catholic Church
in England has-sent out an organized foreign j
mission. It was most appropriately the first,
because it was a special mission to five mil
lions of blacks in the United States, who had
been but a short time ago released from the
yoke of slavery which England bad imposed
on their forefathers. Of all the nations on the
earth England had been the moat guilty in
regard to slavery, and it was most fitting that
the reparation to the now liberated slaves
should proceed from England, The Mission
ary College of SI. Joseph iiad been founded
not for the education of priests for ordinary
work, but for the special work of conducting
a mission to America. This was an excep
tional work—for in the heart of a Christian
nation there were to-day five millions ot peo
ple without pastors and without instruction.
This was a mission to a people who were in
deed within the warmth of civilization, but at
the same time left out in the Cold of neglect.
These missioners go wholly and exclusively to
labor for the blacks, and they were about to
Idiid themselves by a solemn vow to G>>d to
work for the blacks alone, and to suffer noth
ing to call them away, even for a moment
from this work. They went in the spirit of
the prophet who said: ‘The spirit of the L >rd
is upon me, wherefore he hath amiointed me
to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent
me to preach deliverance to the captives and
sight to the blind; to set at liberty them that
are bruised ; to preach the acceptable year of
tiie Lord, and the day of reward.’ They go
to the most downtrodden, humble and humil
iated of all races—a race always despised and
rejected of men. They are no longer physi
cally enslaved, But the galling marks-of bon
dage are still upon their souls as well as on
their limbs, and they are still imprisoned iu
the walls of prejudice and pride. These
priests .go as the vanguard of otheis who will
follow you, inflamed with the love of souls—
souls not loveable for their intelligence and
virtue, but souls black with ignorance, lovea
ble only because your master died for them.
‘You gave yourselves forever,’ saili the Arch
bishop, eddressing the priests, ‘to be the lath
ers and servants of the blacks, and to labor
exclusively for them until your death, in the
spirit of Peter Claver, who had inscribed upon
his cincture tbe words. ‘Forever the slave of
the slave,'"
Commenting npon the above mission, the
Philadelphia Press says that “the mission of
these priests is apparently but little under
stood in England or Rome. The colored
people of the South, although unrefined, un
lettered and untutored, are not uncivilized or
idolaters. Probably they are the most devout
people on the face of tbe globe, witli a larger
proportion of church members, and practic
ing as well as professing Christians, than
many that boast of more culture I u: p ssess
less faith.” To which the Baltimore Sun
t
adds: “This undesigned testimony to the
Christian culture which the colored people ol
the South received in former days from the
white people of the South is somewhat in
consistent with the accounts of Southern
character which are generally found in the
columns of the Press. The truth is that, be
fore the carpet-taggers took them in hand,
the colored mqffibgrs of Southern churches
amounted to a larger number than all th
heathen converted to Christianity by the
combined missionary societies of Great Bri
tain and America, It may be, however, that
the worthy missionaries who have arrived
among us are fearful of serious backsliding in
those sections where the colored people have
been subjected to a new and demoralizing
political companionship. In this view of tin
case, it is possible that the enterprise mat
happy results, though it is to be re
gretted, for the sake of complete efficiency,
that it should be confined entirely to the col
ored people, and should not include also the
carpet-bag emissaries, whose influence is s
demoralizing.”

The American Farmer.
We refer our readers to the advertisement of
Messrs. Samuel Sands & Son, of Baltimore,
who have resumed the publication of this pio
neer of agricultural journalism in the United
States. Mr.Jno. S. Skinner founded this work
in 1819, and when he gave it up, its existence
was temporarily suspended until resuscitated
by Mr. Sands, the Senior of the present firm,
who conducted it for twenty-five years, and
raised it to eminence and a high degree of pros
perity. Some years ago he disposed of the
Farmer, and afterwards commenced the publi
cation of the Rural Register. Both papers are
now combined, and the old editor, assisted by
his Son, who was specially educated for this
profession, again takes the helm. Of the ser
vices of Mr. Sands in behalf of agriculture,
David Dickson, Esq., of Hancock county, Ga.,
one of the most eminent and successful agri
culturalists of the South, some years ago said;
“It is a great pity that every planter in Georgia
did not take your paper, for you have saved
the wheat growers in the United States millions
of dollars in the last fifteen years ; and the con
sumers of guano owe but little less;” and on
another occasion the same distinguished gen
tleman, speaking of the Rural Register , remark
ed : “If the Georgia planters understood their
interests they would double the price of your
paper and have it come once a week and take
thirty or forty thousand copies.” The long
experience’of the Senior in the management of
an agricultural paper, with the fresh aid he
will from his Junior, will no doubt
render their paper popular with those/br whom
they labor, and again give it a forepaost place
among its compeers of the day. WBfcvish all
success to this veteran of Agricultural Litera
ture, and commend it to our farming friends.

THE
Southern Magazine,
IHIS periodical (formerly the Eew Eclectic)
is uow the only literary magazine publish
ed iu the South ; and as such, it is the aim of
the publishers to make it, as far as possible,
the representative of every department of South
ern literature, and the exponent of the besttalr
ent and culture of our people —hitherto almost
unauown for want of an adequate literary
organ.
An important feature of this magazine is the
placing on record well-authenticated facts, de
rived from the highest sources ol authority, re
lative to the late war; thus preserving authen
tic materials for the future historian.
Papers containing information respecting the
Resources and Prosperity of the South, or judi
cious counsel for their improvement, are at all
times welcomed.
No articles of a sectarian character are ad
mitted ; nor will anything of a nature to give
just offence to persons of any Christian faith,
find a place in our pages.
Ample space is devoted to Lighter Literature,
Fiction, Poetry, Essays and Humorous Sketch.es
from the best Southern writers, so as to render
The Southern Magazine a welcome guest in every
home-circle.
Our list of contributors now includes nearly
all the distinguished writers of the South.—
Among others we may mention the names of
Hon. A. H Stephens, Gen. G. T. Beauregard,
Rev. H. C. Alexander, Gen. J. A. Early,
Hon. S. T. Wallis, Rev.R.L.Dabney, D.D.
