Railroad. Hayden was manager of a the
atrical troupe traveling in tlie State. The
company played at Madison and took the

to appear in Columbia, S. C., on the night
following. A collision below Madison,
caused the train conveying the profession
als to be delayed and it was impossible to
make connections so as to reach their des
tination in time. In this suit the point was
whether Hayden could recover tbe entire
amount of the loss or only the amount he
had paid out for railroad tickets and reas
onable compensation for actual loss of time.
The court below held that he could recover
tbe entire amount of loss. The Supreme
Court held that the peculiar nature of a
passenger's business could not be consid
ered unless it was made known to the rail
road, and as in this instance the railroad
had no such notice at the time it sold Hay
den tickets for the transportation of him
self and company, Hayden could not re
cover more than tbe price paid for the
tickets.

TIDINGS OF THE MANISTEE.
A Man Claiming: to Re a Survivor Glrtl
Account of the Los* of the Vessel*
Duluth, Minn., Dec. 8.—Mr. Carltoe
has received a letter from a friend who wu
a passenger on tlie fated Manistee. "Whc,
the boat went out," the letter says, "west
countered a very heavy gale from the soullr
west, and when about twenty miles out
the boat was put about, but could not
make It. The life-boats were taken out,
but before they were launched all but out
were swept away in the storm, and
only nine persons who were on the boat
were allowed to get in. We had a terrible
time. After the boat went down there vrsi
nothing but a wide expanse of witer before
us. We rolled around on the turbulent
waves cold, wet and hungry for three dayg
and one by one tbe waifs dropped off, dealt)
having come to their relief. Some of there
were frozen to death, while'some died froa
sheer exhaustion and exposure to the wind.
Captain McKay never left the boat, but
wrapped himself up In his heavy overcost
and remarked: 'f will never leave the host
until the last soul is off. I am Captain ol
this boat, and If she is a coffin for anybody
she will be my coffin.' After the men htd
left the boat the Manistee made one plunge
under the waves, and that was the last Ol
her. When we left the vessel there
were the crew and ten or clevo
passengers on board, and out ot
those who started out in the boat
only three were saved and reached Hough
ton. Tlie wreck occurred off Eagle Harbor,
and there was no possible chance of having
the vessel under the circumstances. At th»
last, when everybody knew there was no
hope, CapL McKay gave his erders just is
cool and collectedly as If he was on land."
A body floated near the shore at Pigeo*
River, and fruitless endeavors were madl
to secure it. It is supposed to be a corpre
from the Manistee, but was not identified
in anv way.
BLAZE IN A SLEEPING EAR.
The Passengers Rescued by Chopping %
Hole in the Side of the Coach.
Tboy, N. Y., Dec. 8.—At one o'clock
yesterday morning, while the late New York
express on the New York Central <fe Hudson
Road was passing a point a short distance
south of Castleton, fire was discovered iu the
sleeping-car attached to the train. Tbe
flames were first noticed in the ladies'
parlor. The train waa run into Castleton
and stopped, and the passengers were
hurried eut ef the burning car. All es
caped injury with the exception of one man,
who was terribly roasted in his berth. He
was taken to the hotel, where lie now lies
in a dying condition. His name is not known.
Another man lost his hat, iu which he had
placed $180. The fire department wa»
called out. The flames were extinguished
after tlie car had been aimostniined. There
were twelve passengers asleep in the
oar when the fire was discovered, and
consternation prevailed.
the utmost
Four of the passengers were asleep
and were almost suffocated by the smoke
before aroused. The doers of the car were
found locked, and the windows fastened
down. An ax was obtained and an opening
cut through the side of the car by which
escape was effected. Two men were some
what bruised and so overcome by sreok*
that it was deemed best to leave them in a
hotel at -Castleton. P. G. Murphy, o(
Buffalo, agent of the Nickel-Plate KeU
road, was also hurt, but not seriously.
Just What the Bandits Wanted.
Morgantown, W. Va., Dec. 8.— Friday
evening about dusk a gang of suspicious i*

move the money and stamps for safe keep
ing. Placing all the valuables In a strong
box he closed the office and started tor
home with the treasure under his «*■

and heard 1dm give a shrill whistle. Flan

he passed an alley a moment later two re®

tlie alarm, tne thieves got away with the
plunder, leaving no clue. They secure*
