Johnston's rules govcniliig the "ubmh

panies show that they have been hit in : i

present linio luii been able ( o
that is , a full i-vposure of the iti ! di'1
workings and a detailed statement of the
actual condition of the lamrgranl roa K
The reports which up o Iho | ) re pnl
time have been given lo the stockholder *
and the public have been meagre , mys
tifyiug and quite unsatisfactory. The
thhleen rcqulrcmunls of the present
railrond commi-Hioiiur will probe ( ho
manairement to tlio bottom. Among I ho
most important is the rule which require
of the company "a distinct and fnJl ic-
port of all sp.eelal rates , if any , to whom
allowcdj also any rebates or drawbacks.
nnd to whom , and tliu aggregate anr > un (
of each to bu returned within llftuon die s
after the close of oacli qunrtor. " In this
case of the Union I'acllic the answer to
this question will be of particular inter
est to Nobraskatis. The Hybtem of fav
oritism to friends of thai corporation ami
to . special lirms and localities which lias
been developed through secret rates and
drawbacks has been of serious damage lo
thousands of. our citizens engaged In
business , and indirectly to the wliolo
fitato. Monopolies in grain and coal have
been fostered and maintained by its oper
ation , nnd legitimate compclilioii in trade
stilled. A full and frctpiont report of the
details of the rebate and drawback > ys-
tcm is the surest method lo kill it in its
most odious'nml dangerous form.
Another important requirement which
is fixed by General Johnston's circular is
that which asks that "wliero n portion of
anyroad issubsidi/.ed and a portion not
fciihshli/icd , a separate account and a re
port of actual gross nnd net earnings of
the subsidized portion of the road , and
the netual gross and net earnings of the
lion subsidized portions" shall bo made.
Under Iho peculiar polic3" of Iho land
giant roads , branches have been built
out of the earnings of tlio main line ,
Iheir cost charged to the construction ac
count , and then made lo appear as earn
ing the bulk of the business of the road
in order to diminish tlio apparent earn
ings of the subsidized portion. Hy this
means the provisions of tiio Thurman
act , requiring live per cent of tlio net'
earnings of Mibsidi/ed roads to be covered
into the treasury annually , have been
evaded. Commissioner Johnston pro
poses to discover the method _ by which
the branches are made to do so prolit-
able a business while the main lines
arc cither lo inir money or showing very
scanl earnings above expenses. TJie
other rules require frequent reports of
net and irross earnings , roporls.Sn ad
vance of meetings of stockholders , direct
ors and ovecutiv < ! committees .with subse
quent reports of Iho minutes of such
meetings , and linally copies in writing of
all contracts made with transportation
companies and railroads.
( lonernl Johnston is to bo commended
for his evident determination to enforce
the greatest publicity in the methods of
management and statistics of operation
the land grant railroads. The books
have long been closed to the public -ind
they will not bo thrown open without a
struggle. A full exposure of tiio out
rageous disregard of all interests in- .
volvcd but Iho.ic of the stock jobbers and
gamblers which has characterized the
management of railroad cotporations
will lie the final stop towards national a
regulation of corporate monopolies.

convinces the writer that that city is fast
catching ( up with Kansas City. The long ,
wide , lovely , crowded streets , the enor

ceasing roar of engines and factories ,
make a scone of animation rarely experi
enced. The great striking dillcruncc be

crowded ' streets and cars late at night.
Everybody seems indoors at St. Joe by 8

IMT.ITTHV roi : TIM ; mi : : . ]
In , rceontl.v Visiting a numlier of publio
schools in cities and ( owns of ( ho "great
west" the writer lias found many of
them with very Imperfect means of ven
tilation , or with none at all except win-
titiw-simtl doors. Aflhougli must teachers
of these schools had hoard , and millly
believed vonlllnliou to bo a good thing ,
very few appeared to realize its necessity
'
to the hcalt'h and progress of their pu-
pils. , j | Kcwor Mill had any correct Idea of
tlis proper muitii uf .securing it. In
deed , it has frequently happened that
with u full knowledge of the impurities
in a seliool roon'i , a teacher , as
was thu case with the writer , may for
ioars wholly overlook or neglect this
important clement of hi * o\Vn success.
Hence , the writer has fell II Ids duly to
make public such information on this
subject , as lie lias derived from a life
lime ' of observation and experience m
tlie "t'luuil room , hoping thus to arouse a
deeper interest in the matter cm the part
oft teachers ami parents , and at the name
tjl" tnrnish some practical notions of

who have charge of the construction of
out public .school houses , especially in
till ! country towns and smaller cities.

li is well known that at every respiration
tioi our lungs pour forth carbonic acid ,
vulgarly culled air damp.'WIimi breathed
pine this gas is fatally poisonous causing
tug death by usphj.xin in a short time , as
often happens when persons descend
into wells without a lust as to its pres
ence. Air containing only a moderate
quantity : of this gas is whol Jj unlit for
breathing , nnd often produces dangerous
and oven fatal rcsiills. Jsor is ( his gns
the only clement by which the air ot a
school-room is always contaminated.
Kimiberless combinations ot decaying
fclid ti.ssuo are constantly cx-orcted from
the human 1'ody. Hence , in un uinonli-
laled room , pupils and teacher are soon
Immersed in aea of impurity inde

Kvenone who has thought at till on IN

almost everyone has some theory
concerning it. Few , however , have any
correct notions of its i eijuircmeiits , Some
suppose ) ] ) that if a sash bo dropped or n only
opened , all foul air willosenpu.
Others think that if an open lluo extend
near the lloor , above flic building ,

that all impurities will pass out
through doors ami window * that are fre
