.Mr. Register ? I noticed in a late num
ber of your priper thai the ladies are to
1 bold a Fair foi the benefit of a Band a
bout to be organized in your town. It
set me to thinking of the old Band of '25
year? ago, which, u.ider the leadership of
Stevens and Criswell, and Shce'z, and
Van Harp wiih his big drum, used to give
out such music as 1 think I have never !
heard since. And the old "Potomac ?
Rifles" ? I have seen a good many sol- <
die rs since but none to my memory ever (
came up to the bearing of Hatntramck lor j
! a Captain, and Webb and Henry Boteler
for Lieutenants, or Joseph Welshans for
a standard bearer. How many of the j
old set have passed away ? Keep alive
1 the remenbrance of them.
I enclose ?2, with one dollar you ran j
vote for Rev. Dr. Andrews lor the suit of
; clothes, and with the other you can take
1 a chance in the saddle and bridle for me.
P. S. ? One thing I forgot, whether ?
1 Van Harp beat the big drum or clashed .
the cymbals. Csn you tell me ?
In answer to the above questions :
we will stale that Col. Ilarotrarack, lien- 1
ry Boteler, Van Harp and VVm. Sheeiz
have passed from sll^ sublunary things,
but yet there is a spirit of*the 1 old Band''
still manifesting itself amongst some of
our citizens.- Criswell's Cornel Band
was hard to beat in musical talent and
proficiency, and we are glad to state thai ,
evidences are favorable for tho resuscita
tion cf the same with a few exceptions in i
membership.
I)r. Andrews has withdrawn from the J
contest for the suit of clothes, but we j
shall appropriate the two dollar bill re- ,
ceived for the benefit of the Band and re
turn thanks for the same.
An Abominablb Affair. ? The
Cumberland Times of last week gives
the following account of a little episode :
which we would call mixed basis. How
ever "every one to their fancy" as the
old woman said : ?
A gentleman arrived in Cumberland
last Friday, in chase of his daughter who !
absconded Irom her father's house in i
Martinsborg, and reached here in com- ?
pany with a mulatto, last week. The
paiy were found together in a house by i
the agonized father, and the girl was lak- t
en to one of the Institutions in Baltimore i
which shelters each unfortunates. Her '
name is Wraith, she is about 19 years old,
and tier family are people of means and
respectability in Mart:n?burg.
The mulatto was formerly a barber ii?- ;
this city where he, with his brother, kept i
a barber shop, several years ago. The !
night they got here they applied to a re- |
spectacle colored man named ltobert Har- 1
rison, to be taken into hrs hoos>, stating !
that they were man and wife, but they i
were nut admitted. They subsequently t
obtained shelter at another.
Nothing has been done with the roan,
and presuming it would be the desire of
Mr. Smith, we would not give publicity
to the case did we not believe that tho ;
feelings of the deeply commisserated par
ents would be saved in the end better by <
giving the facts to the public at once that s
inquiry about it may the sooner cease.

The Baltimore Sim give-1 the following
synopsis of the President * Messaj|8
which wis eabmitt d io Congtes9 uD
Monday last :
The President* message has least
the merit of breviiy. and ii is to be hoped
may become ;? model in that reaped lor
Uio communications ul his successors.
Often the annual report of the President
la ihe iwu hu'j-es has occupied near about
a page of this paper. Even the comments
of the pre?* ujxin his stat meiits, recom
mendations and argument* h*\e some
times been about as long as the present
document. V\ e are gUd to be relieved in
thin message from surplusage and tedious
verbiage, and the example thus sei might
be safely followed, not only by C? e ne i al
Grant's successors, but by some of the
heads of depigments and bureaus in thier
accompanying annual report?. Facts,
! figures and reasons, in as brief a compass
1 aa possible, are all that the public demanJ.
; General Grant, in a ?ord, has set a prac
I tic&l example of retrenchme nt and refoiro
in this matter which is worthy of genet <>1
' official imitation.
After enumerating the various blessings
which we enjoy as a people, the Presi
dent refers to v*bat has been accomplish
ed in the matter of restoring the Sia;e
government*, and to the special case of
Georgia, in which he ?ceras to think that
! reconstruction in that instance requires to
be reconstructed, ai.d recommend* a law
authorizing the Governor ol that State to
convene all the members originally o.ec
ted to the Legislature, requiring each
member to take ihe oath presciibed by
the reconstruction arts, and none to be ad
mitted who aro ineligible under the third
clause of the fourteenth amendment.. I he
loss of our commerce, resulting, as is al
leged. from the war, will be the sul ject ot a
special message. The restoration of \ ir
einia is recommended, rind hope express
! ed that the acts of ihe Texas and Missis
sippi Legislatures, when they meet, may
be such as to receive the approval of
Congress, *nd c.ose the work ol recon
struction.
i On the subject of tho finances thrf tone
of the President i* generally healthy, ,
! though cautious and very conservative,
lie -hows an earnest appreciation of t!ie
evds of an irredeemable and fluctua.ing
currency and the necessity for a return to
: the specie basis, for which, hd adinits, no
substitute can be devised Immediate re
sumption of specie payments, however, if i
practicable, is not con*idered desirable,
and such legislation is recommended 3d
will injure a gradual return to it. I o
' put "a-i mi mediate stop to flactuation in
1 the value of the currency,'' it is suggested
that the treasury bs authorized to redeem
its own paper, at a fixed price, whenever
preserved, and to withhold Irom circula
i tion all currency so redeemed until sold
I agaiu for go!d.
In view of our increasing ability 'o pay
i the President suggest* al>-o as feasible the
' policy of redeeming on i 3 and G per cent.
loans as ihoy fecorae subject to be called
i in, by the negotiation of other bonds bcar
| ing 4 and 4j per cent, interest. I he ,
President recommemls the postponement .
of a general r e v i - i ? > n of t : e tariff and tax- .
ation laws for the present, but suggests n
renewal of Ihe tax on incomes, at a re
duced rate, bay of 3 p,-r cent , end this to {
expire in three years. I he revenues ol j
i this country are greater than the requwe
ments, and may with safety be reduced ; .
but as the funding in a 4 or a 4j per cent
loan would reduce the annual current ex
penses largely, thus after funding, juati- j
fyjng a greater reduction of taxea than
i would now he expected, he suggests the
postponement of the question until the j
next Congress, though instances of bur
1 densome discrioiination might now be
modified.
; In regard to Cubi. while sympathizing (
with it, the content has at no time assum
' ed a condition sufficient to Justify a rc

; pie is maintained that Una government is
its own judge when to accord that right.
It i? hoped that the good offices of tha
' United States rrrsy yet prove advanta
geous for a ?etilemen'.
The subject ol the Darien carnl if fa
vorably mentioned. I lie only grave ques
' tion which the Union ha9 with any for
eign nation is that concerning the Ala
bama clump. The President regarded
i the late contention as misconceived in its
scope, ;,nu .not calculated to secure a
1 heartv settlement, and therefore approved
its rejection by the Senate as in the inter
ests of peace.
Ho makes quite a summary of the con

Government Sales.
The account yiven in Thursday s issue
of our pnprr is mainly correct, as to sales
of the Public Property at Harper ? Ferry,
for Ibe tirst day ; the i era for the "right
lo dig ore on Ftiends Ore Bank," should
have been $13,100, instead of $1,300,
purchased by W. C. Bradley, or the An
tietam Iron Work?, Md.
The second and third days sales began
on Washington or lligh street with the
Dwelling Houses built on the North side
of that street, all of wbich realized good
prices : Mrs. Boerly, *2, GOO; Mrs Dai
ley $1,425; II, V, Daniels, $2,025;
Dr. J. 8. O'Donnell, *2.275 ; LJ. Mur
phy, $2, 375 ; J.iaaes McGraw, ?1,000.
1. Gilbert ? an industrious and well-to do
colored citizen of Harper's Ferry ? *950;
Daniel Aines, $1,225; Thos. W, Galla
her, $1,750 ; these named purchasers
are but a few of the fine Houses and Lots,
disposed of at this sale. The terraced
lull side, sloping on Washington street to
the Armory grounds, affording tine build
ing ground for cottage residences, which
many years ago, dotted this portion of the
town, with beauiiful and g?v and fl twery
yards and gardens was disposed of.
About 210 Lots, many with buildings '
upon them, were suld ? each of which
contains sufficient land for future building
purposes ? the whole of which have been
laid c (T on a M*p, platted by S. Howell
Brown, Esq., Surveyor, with streets,
blocks and lots, proj' eted under the in- j
stroctions of Capt. D. J. Young, U. S. A.,
and Ordnance tsorekeeprr at Harper's
Ferry, and approved and signed by the
Hon. W. W. Belknap, Secretary of War,
and io be recorded hereafter among the
land records of the County of Jeflersoo,
W. Va. Mr. Brown, in the mapping of
this Plat, with the very laborious prelim
inary surveys necessary therefor, has
done himself great credit, and he de#erves
it all.
The future progress of the old town of
Harper's Ferry seems to be now assured
? inprovement will, unquestionably, fol
low this sale. As an instance, it is stated
that ? gentleman contracted, in writing,
for the exclusive right to dig clay, for
brick, on a neighboring farm, and as an
evidence of his earnestness in the business
and his confidenco in the situation of
things, paid two thousand dollars, cash
down, to the c wner.
The same may be observed a* witness- i
ed in the sprightly springing steps of the ;
citizens, not only of the (own, but also,
of the people of the vicinity, who depend
for prospemy in many respects, on the
prosperity of the towns ol Bolivar and
Harper's Ferry.
The aggregate amount of sale* uas
?291,444,50 which, wfi have been in
formed, will satisfy that provision of the
I,* w of Congress, approved Dee. 15,
1803, which required that the principal
?um of purchase money paid for said 1
property bv the United States, be refund
ed to the United Sistes. It is propsr to
report that amplo donations were made
by the government, ot fee simple eciatos
in all the Lot-1 heretofore held for religious
charit iMe, school and town purposes. ?

Interesting Decision. ? The esse of
Charles J. Faulkner t?j. Philip C. Pen
dleton's administrator was decided a Jew
days ago by Judge Cbapline. This was
a suu involving a considerable amount of
money, and has attracted a large share of
attention in our court. It grew out of
heavy advances of money made by the
plaintiff, Mr. Faulkner, to the defendant's
(relator, Philip C. Pendleton, on the
joint purchase, cultivation and improve
ment of the Glengary estate, in the coun
ty of Frederick. The defendant pleaded
the act of limitation?. To this the plain
tifT replied, that before tl.e act of limita
tions attiched, the defendant's testator, to
induce him not to sue, had executed his
covenant in writing, under seal, pledging
himself not to plead the act of limitations.
Judge Chapline de.-ided that the covenant
was binding upon the administrator and
heirs, and that the) were estopped by it
from pleading the act of limitation*. It is
paid that the case will h? taken to the
Coirt of Appeals. ? M nrlinsburg Star.
An Incident. ? Among the incidents
connected wiih the sale of Government
property at Harper's Feny is noticeable
the following which is related to us : At
the head of the ravine on High street, the
small wooden dwelling, snugly ensconced
below the level of the street, heretofore
and still occupied by an old citizen, Mrs.
VaJioda Stipes, for more than 50 years,
in consequence ol an announcement by
Mr. J. P. Ki ller, Chief t'lerk of the Or
dinance Department at Washington, rep
resenting that Department, that ihc?e facts
entitled the occupant to her eoniinued res
idence, and he kindly hoped the crowd
would uot oppose her daiiing wish to end
herdsys in her old home ; thereupon, he
bid for her I'o the credit ol the peo
ple, no other bid wi? oflVred, and it was
called olT to her. ? Free I'ress.
