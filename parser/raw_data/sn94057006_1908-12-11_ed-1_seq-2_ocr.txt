A Washington dispatch says
'The mine operators of Arizona re
ported to the United States geolog
ical survey for the calender year of
1807, a production of gold, silver,
copper, lead and zinc valued at
$55,511,500. Of tbi? total the
value of the copper output consti
tutes 92 per ceut, for the produo
lou of that me,Ul uncounted to
254,879,489 pounds having a com
mercial value of $50,975,898. Al
though this copper output is near
ly 12,000,000 pounds in quantity
and more than $500,000 in value
less than the preceding calender
year, it exoeeda the record of Mon
tana, for 1907, by nearly 35,000,
000 pounds in quantity and $7,X)0-
000 in value, and places the terri
tory first among the copper pro
ducers of the country.
Gold was second in value in the
territory in 1907, the output
amounting to izu,uvz.oZ ounces,
valued at $2,617,313, and silver
third, with an output of 2,511,897
tine ounces, valued at $1,657,852.
The lead production was valued at
$247,010 and the zinc at $13,481.
Elevenof Arizona's thirteen coun

metals the producers numbering
437. The territory has eleven
Bmtdtiog plants two in Cochise

Graham, one iu Fjma, ooein Santa

these smelters treated copper ores,
and five of them did a custom busi
