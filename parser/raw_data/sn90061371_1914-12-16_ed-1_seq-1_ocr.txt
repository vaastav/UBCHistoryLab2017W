If the oountry had only stood
pat in 1912 there would now be
no hard times or war tax.
It seems the Mann act is to be
repealed because too many wom
en are taking advantage of it.
Times never get so hard that
Santa Clans is thrown out of his
job, though at present he is not
wording over-time.
The President never once re
ferred to "watchful waiting
wins." Perhaps he has come to
the conclusion that it didn't.
The Secretary of the Treasury
wants to make the war tax per
manent. It will be, as long as
the Democratic party is in
power.
European statesmen must have
sleepless nights of late if they
have any conscience at all. Tbey
should have heaps of dead men
on their minds.
Mr. Bryan don't seem quite
so peerless to many of his Demo
cratic friends since he intimated
that the party should divorce it
self from whiskey support.
President Wilson stated in his
recent message to Congress that
the way was now open to honest
business. But will it be closed
to the dishonest business man?
Our Democratic exchanges
that have been seeing prosperity
rushing upon us as the result of
their party's rule have not yet
had to dodge to keep from being
run over by it.
As soon as the family row is
over, those dear relatives, King
George, Kaiser Wilhelm and Czar
Nicholas, will go visiting among
each other again and meet with
embraces and kisses.
The State of Missouri has not
funds enough to pay pensions to
the ex Confederates. It needs
the money to pay the army of
relatives employed by the heads
of tne various state departments.
For the benefit of the Ironton
Heel iter, which seems to have
overlooked the fact, we mention
again that a free soop house has
been opened in St. Louis, where
a thousand or more jobless men
are fed every day. Quite like
the days of 1893.
If our soldiers down on the
Mexican border are Retting in
the way of bullets fired across
the line by the Mexicans, what's
the matter with moving the sol
diers out of range? If we are
not inclined to take a hand down
there, what is our army doing in
that neighborhood, anyway?
Someone predicted the other
day that Roosevelt would be a
candidate for President in 1916
on the Prohibition ticket. This
prophet is making a poor guess,
however. Judging from his re
cent remarks on the liquor in
terests and the Democratic par
ty, it is much more likely that
Wm. J. Bryan will be the nomi
nee of the Prohibition party, on a
grape-juice-platform.
Congressman Sereno E. Payne
of New York died suddenly in
Washington lastThursday night.
Mr. Payne had much to do in
shaping the last Republican tariff
act and thus gave it his name
White that tariff may not have
been the best tariff law ever
framed, as President Taft once
poke of it, it was incomparably
superior to the one the Demo
crats made to supplant it. The
Payaa tariff was at once a busi
aess promoter and a revenue get
ter, and in this respect it stands
out with scintillating brilliancy
in contrast with the present tar
iglaw, which is not capaple of
oither of these things. Mr.
Payne was a ''standpatter,''
- which events have proven to
mean that h stood for something
differentia the way of national
prosperity, welfare and happi
ness than that which has been
foisted upon th country by the
party that has held "standpat.
tism" up to opprobrium.

There is a good deal of discus
sion just now as to whether the
United States is prepared for
war. If we are in no better posi
tion now in that respect than we
were at the outset of the Spanish
war, we would make a poor show
ing indeed against a first-class
military power, and in view of
the advance in modern warfare
Hlnce that time, it is not very
probable that we are much bet
ter off in the means of waging a
successful war. Peaoe is a fine
thing and we hope we may never
see the day again when the Amer
ican people will be called upon to
break it; but when we are in dis
nute with another nation our
own inclination toward peace
must be subordinated to the oth
er fellow's inclination to fight;
and when the other fellow is
ready to fight, we may take it for
granted that he is fully equiproi
for it. That the gnjtea oiaies
could be conquered and subject
ed to foreign rule i beside the
question. We would smocner an
invading force in the course oi
time bv sheer force of numbers,
but it would cost us dear before
we could do it without &h equip
ment equal to that of the invadr
er. wnue it may iuok. ukc
ishness to spend money for arms
while there is no probability of
war, it is really no more foolish
than to spend money for fire in
surance on your house while
there is little .probability of it
burning down, yet we insure
the house. Until all modern na
tions can agree on a policy of
disarmament, we will have to
spend money on preparation for
war as insurance against damage
from the nation who may oe
ready to fight us.

individual, Is a matter of condi
tions rather than of theories.
President Wilson as a theorist
is a man to be respected. As an
executive and as a pilot of the
Ship of State, be has been, dur
ing the two years of his incumb
ency in office, a failure.
There is something wholly be
wildering in the fact that the in
dustrial status of the Nation has
steadily gone from bad to worse
ever since President Taft left
Washington.
There is no question of parti
san bias, of narrow strategic ar
gument, in the statement that
the administration must have
been at fault in this relation
ship. The old argument that Repub
lican capitalists may always put
all kinds of obstacles in the way
of the success of a Democratic
president is a childish one. All
capitalists are not Republicans.
Many pf them are not politicians
at all, to any considerable ex
tent. And those among them
who are not obsessed with polit
ical affairs would be quick enough
to seize tne opportunity to for
ward their own enterprises, if
there were any merely strategic
motive on the part of other man
ufacturers and men of large activ
ities, who, according to the pue
rile oharge, put on the brakes
when to do so means the dis
crediting of a political party.
The President's message man
ifests a lack of assurance, of con
fidence, of definiteness. It may
easily be seen that is author
realizes that no amount of excel
lent theorising can be set against
the fact that the Nation is in dis
tress and at a time when no
natural pauses are to be suggest
ed as an explanation. ,
The one pertinent paragraph
is that whioh is said to be an af
terthought, interpolated for the
reassurance of the business
man." (One wonders why the
whole message should not have,
been addressed to the business
map as to any other. And if it
ia not for the basiness man, then

for whom Is it intended?)
This passage is irksomely elo
quent as usual; but at least it
gives gratifying evidence of the
President's realization of the faot
that the most ideally constructed
mill is worthless unless grist can
be brought to it and its wheels
ean be set in motion. St. Louis

Suggests New Plan
For School Reading.
The public school is one of the
most wasteful institutions in the
state," says J. L. Meriam, pro
fessor of school supervision at
the University of Missouri, at.
Columbia. "To illustrate this
waste, take the buying of school
books. When a class of thirty
runs out of reading matter the
parents pay $10 for thirty new
books, all alike. They have only
120 pages of new reading mate
rial. That class had better been
supplied with different books
which would give the pupils thir
ty times the amount of reading
they are now getting in a large
percentage of schools."
Professor Meriam says that
reading is more efficiently taught
from different readers than when
each pupil has read the story two
or three times. Theae is no
chance for the pupil to become
interested in what another pupil
is reading if the story is stale to
him. Again, there is no incent
ive to the reader to try to read
well when he knows that no
other pupil cares anything about
his reading,
Our "Neutrality."
The President's announce
ment that in his opinion the
spirit of neutrality would be
violated if submarines should be
constructed in this country for J
the use of any of the warring
nations, may be welcomed as an
indication that the true meaning
of the word "neutrality" has be
gun to dawn on the persons re
sponsible for the conduct of na
tional affairs. Until quite recent
ly every move that might by any
means be construed as of possi
ble advantage to Germany was
sure to be promptly squelched,
while the allies had but to inti
mate a wish to have Washington
hasten to comply with it. This
subserviency on part of our Ad
ministration called forth indig
nation and disgust in German-
American circles, and the sting
ing rebuke administered to the
Democracy in the November
election was largely due to this
cause, even the German-American
press of Democratic leaning
having condemned the attitude
of Wilson, Bryan et al. in no un
certain terms. The lesson seems
to have had the desired effect,
and if from now on our obliga
tions to the various parties in
the European conflict -hall be
more carefully weighed and
more conscientiously carried out,
this may be regarded as a
triumph achieved by the Ger-
man-American voters. St, Louis

No doubt your farm does look
quite bad, my sad-eyed Belgian

they acted just like Huns, and

though you have suffered much,
you have no corner on the woe,
and neither have the Putcb, for

When men send out circulars with fairy tales of 600 or
150 or 50 per cent per annum, the financial investor had
better put his money in the bank. It is better to be sure
of 3 per cent and one's principal than to luxuriate on 150
per cent dividends for two or three weeks and then lose
both dividends and principal. Chicago Tribune, editorial.

from a section of a bamboo fishing

Dover (Del.) post office.
He and his companions were fishing
In a rowboat when they noticed that
the baited hooks and sinkers of their
lines had been snapped off. Maag said
that a shark was near by, and he be
gan to shape the crude harpoon. A
tew minutes later the shark appeared
less than twenty feet away. Maag
threw the harpoon. The shark leaped
from the water and then beaded tqp
the boat. Maag's companions rowed
desperately and pulled out of danger.
Then began a struggle that continued
for a quarter of an hour. The shark
finally died from loss of blood. The
