conspirators George Moore, engineer, Alexan

formerly watcliinan in the employment of the

trial at Pittsburg on Tuesday. These fallows
had been dismissed from the service of the

revenged they resolved on the destruction cf
tlie-railroad buildings. One plan to carry out
their nefarious des'gns, as we leam from the

under the boiler of the stationary engine at

in the morning the entire establishment might
be blown up. Vt lien the attempt was made

This body assembled on Monday, the mem

greeting ach other with great cordiality, and
the pMfceedings thus f-indicating'--, good

In the' House a disposition is evinced to
dispose of the necessary legislation with all
possible despatch. On Tuesday, after the
reading of the Message that portion of it re
ferring to the secession movements ' was on
motion of Mr. Boteler of Vi., by a vote of
145 to 38, referred to a select committee of
one from each State with leave to report at
any time. Messrs." Singleton of Mississippi,
Clapton. Currr and Moore of Alabama,
Jones aud Gartrell of Ueorgia,.aud Hawkins
of Florida, refused to vote on the motion be
cause their States LaJ called conventions to
consider their relations to the Union. Mr.
Miles of South Carolina, said his State was
now out of the Union, except by a mere form,
therefore her members took no iutercst in the
matter. His remarks were received with
good humor.
Oa Wednesday a bill making appropriar
tioos for the payment of the invalid and oth-

Id the Senate on Tuesday, after tlie reading
of the message, Mr. CTuigmau of North Car
olina made a disunion speech and advocated
a peaceble separation with an equitable di
vision of the public property. ' Mr. Critten
den of Kentucky replied in a strong Union
speech, hoping that the example of the gen
tleman would not be followed. " We had bet
ter not conic here at all. The Union is
worthy of great sacrifice -and concessions.
He looked forwurd to disunion with fear; dis
may and trembling. They must search for
means of reconciliation and harmony. He
hoped there would be no angry " debate.
North Carolina had always carried the olive
branch of peace. - -:
The following is a synoposis or the proceed
ings of the Senate on Wednesdoy :
Mr. Powell moved the reference of the
President's Message, so far as it relates to the.
present political affuirs of the country, to a
special committee.
Mr. Green offered a resolution for an inqui
ry into tlie expediency of establishing a arm
ed police force on the border Statee slave and
free for maintaining general peace, and an ef
ficient execution of the fugitive slave law.
The credentials of Senator Baker, of Ore
gon, were presented. " '";
Mr. Hale moved to reconsider the vote to
print the President's "message, and made- a
speech, affufking it as failing to look the se
cession movement in the face.
Mr. Brown said : "If you of the North will
go to the right, we of the South will go to
the teft,: and. w 'X, . "." ;

We my this document before our reiulers

with especial . interest." That portion which
pertains to the peculiar state -of tSaira .grow

is probable-the Prcsidenf took strong. anoTde-

der the operation of the influences brought to
bear npon him by the Southern members of the
Cabinet (two of whom are of the fire-eating
class) it has been so modified as to mean very
little. He declares secession to be unconsti
tutional, unlawful and irregular,, but, soys the
government has no power to prevent it: He
seems determined; however," to hold on to. the
public property and collect the" revenues m
the Southern States ; and unless the forts are
attacked or the collection of revenues arising
from customs : forcibly ' interfered with,

between the federal authorities and thoie of

The Kansas relief fund In Ohio will amount
to a eonsiilerable snm. Gov. Dkh-ison has al
ready received and seut ..off some six to eight
hundi ed dollars, and is daily in receipt, of ad
ditional donations, generally the availataf .olr
lections taken on Thanksgiving day. It is de
sirable that all sums raised should be forward
ed at once, and the best and safest way to re
mit is through the Governor.
In this connection we would take occasion
to warn the public against unauthorized itin
erant solicitors, who are tukiug advantage of
the sympathetic feeling in behalf of the poor
sufferers in blausas to advance their own in
terests by imposing upon the people. Beware
of such fellows, and if disposed to give any
thing send it by mail, express or private hands
directly te Governor Dennison, who will at
once forward it to the committee duly author
ized to receive and disburse it in Kansas. -

proceeded to cast the rote of the State to ac

of the State of Ohio. W. P. Umiak acted
as Chairawiv H. S Busby Secretary. - The
appointment of Messenger to convey tha wote

Late advices from Kansas show, that the
Montsromerv raidT 'about which so much ' has
been said, and " which according To some ac
counts had assumed such formidable dimen
sions, has been grossly magnified. Indeed for
most of the reports in connection with it there
seems to be no foundation in truth. No forts,
tewas or courts have been attacked. Mont
gomery has bat a handful of followers, and on
reaching the disaffected region H is not likely
the troops under Command of Gen. Harney
will find anybody to fight.
The official result" m Virsi'mta shows the
election of 9 Befl and 6 Breckinridge Elec'
tore. There were considerably more Bell than
Breckinridge Votes cast In the State, hut the
failure to elect all the Bell Electors grew out
of rrors in spelling names in precincts where
there was not a sufficient supply of printed

Professor Hoi.iowat, the distinguished medical
reformer, once had experience of the fact. It
was his fortune, or misfortune, to fie in Pied
inciiit when the Italian revolution of 18451 was
t Us culminating -point. He" bad bevn nn a
tour through tlw Swim Alps, investigating tlie
phentHiiena of an extraordinary c;uk- of sfrrof
nla indigenous to that region, and known ns
crcnlinitm. While thus engaged, and intent on
observing the effect of his remedies Uxm the
proscrilwd nnd hideous raw who have inherit
ed for uiruiy generatiiMis this horrible disorder,
the torch of civil war had been lighted at Mi
Im, and its flames bad illuminated the whole
Louihardo-Venetian . territory. At the time
when he set forward on bis journct South,
Charles Allmrt. of Hardinia, had been driven
beyond . Mincio, and R-tdctzky's victorious
trix were in full pursuit. Expecting that
his neutral position ns an KnU.-hman, and his
character as a man of science, would piotect
him from outrage. Dr. Hollowny fearlessly set
out upon his journey through thu peninsula;
but a circumstance occurred upon which he bad
not 'ilculated. Marshal lluletzky, in the very
flush of victory bail been tiken suddenly ill,
aud one of the advance parties of his army
having encountered Dr. Holloway's carriage
and discovered who was its inmate, his pres
ence was requested nt head quarters, to attend
upon the sick veteran. As a peaceful civilian
and his suite cannot Rain much in a dispute
with a troop of horse, the Doctor submitted
with the best grace possible. He found the
scarred and Wrinkled soldier in great suffering.
The fatuxues of the enmpaign had brought on
a bilious iever of a very severe type, and as
Kadetzky was then nearly seventy yearaof age,
the army surgeons shook their heads ominous
ly. The Marshal at once put himself under
Dr. Holloway's care, and tbu latter proceedett
to administer his famous Internal remedy. The
ever wion subsided, und in less than thfee
weeks the Gommauder-in-chicf was oner avore
in the saddle. He paid his physician s happy
compliment on his recovery. VYoei, 1. Hol
