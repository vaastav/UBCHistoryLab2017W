The Mulct Law.
The suporvi8ors of Cedar county
have declared that the saloonkeepers
in that county must ]«y their mulct
taxes or close up, This is the proper
view of the matter. The manner iu
which the mulct law has been adtnin
isterd in the prohibitory counties is a
travesty. Many of the counties where
the people have refused to allow the
saloons to operate under the law have
free whisky, and the result is that it
will be impossible to collect the taxes
due, for the very simple reason that
the realty could not be sold for such
a sum as would pay one-tenth of the
taxes in some of the cases. If there
was ever a state of anarchy anywhere
in connection with a liquor law it is
to be found in Iowa at this time
Gazette.
Howard county has prohibition, so
called, with all the evil conditions
mentioned by the Gazette. '"Blind
pigs" and "holes in the wall" supply
all the booze needed for the "h'ibit
a&ls" while the "respectable" in"
dulgers in the ardent can procure
their supplies from any one of the
dozen drug stores of the county.
The fruitless efforts to suppress the
trafic results annually in big bills of
cost which tall upon the tax pavers
of the county. The trafic conducted
in this county if legitimately carried
on ought to pay th6 county a reve
nue of $12,000 at least each year, with
out any increase in the quantity used.
The trafic in all its phases is evil, as
'i conducted, and only evil, and it is
only simple justice to the people, as
jte- it cannot be suppressed, that it be
$• made to pay the costs it makes neoes
sary. The mulct law Is so framed that.
no man can safely do business under
its provisons in any county where the
prohibition sentiment is strong. In
such counties as Polk. Scott. Potta
wattamie, Dubuque, Woodbury, Des
Moines and Muscatine, men do busi
ness profitably under that law. be
cause public sentiment is so strongly
i^gatafiFlts provisions, that only an
p*
""^appearance of regard for the law is
observed by those who are licensed
under the law. The cause of temper
ance is not promoted by the legisla
tion given the people, nor is it design
ed for that purpose, but to promote
republican 'ascendency, without re
gard to public morals. What the
remedy for the evil may be, is not
among the recent discoveries of legis
lation, nor is it likely to be while
demagogues p.nd hypocrites rank
above honest men, in public affairs.
The army of illicit dealers in liquors
throughout the state favor the inuicr
law, and those who enacted it. be
oause with that law in existence they
can profit from their evil deeds with
little fear of punishment. Thus we
have a combination of knaves, dema
gogues and hypocrites, working with
•the honest temperance element, bui
for very different purposes, the knaves
•for the filthy lucre the trafic brings
them, the demagogues and hypocrites
isolely for political results, and the

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
(Continued from last week
OUR EXTRADITION LAVS.
Notice from Mexico of a Termination
of the Terms of tbe Convention.
The interpretation of certain provisions
of the extradition convention of Decem
ber 11, 1S61, has been at various times the
occasion of controversy with the govern
ment of Mexico. An acute difference arose
In the case of the Mexican demand for the
delivery of Jesusi Guerrera, who, having
led a marauding expedition near the border
with the proclaimed purpose of Initiating
an insurrection against President Dlass,
escaped Into Texas. Extradition
was refused
on the ground that the alleged offense was
political in its character, and therefore
came within the treaty proviso of non
surrender. The Mexica« contention was
that the exception only related to purely
political offenses, and that, as Guerrera
acts were admixed with the common crime
of murder, arson, kidnaping and robbery,
the option of nondelivery became void, a
position which this government was unable
to admit, In view of the received interna
tional doctrine and practice In the mat
ter. The Mexican government, In view of
this, gave notice January 24, 1898, of the
termination of the convention, to take ef
fect 12 months from that date, at the same
time inviting the conclusion of a new con
vention, toward which negotiations are on
foot.
In this relation, I may refer to the neces
slty of some amendment of our existing
extradition statue. It is a common stip
ulation of such treaties that neither party
shall be bound to give up its own citizens,
with the added proviso in one of our
treaties that with Japan, that It may sur
render if it see fit. It Is held in this country,
by an almost uniform course of decisions
that where a treaty negatives the obliga
tion to surrender the president is not in
vested with legal authority to act. The
conferment to such authority would be in
the line of that sound moraaity which
shrinks from affording secure aBylum to
the author of a hcinouB crime. Again,
statutory provision might be well made for
what Is styled extradition by way of tran
sit, whereby a fugitive surrendered by one
foreign government to another may be con
veyed across the territory of the United
States to the jurisdiction of the demanding
recommendation In this behalf.

The problem of the Mexican free zone
has been often discussed with regard to its
Inconvenience as a provocative of smug
gling into the United States along an ex
tensive and thinly guarded land border.
The effort made by the Joint resolution of
March 1, 1805, to remedy the abuse charged
by suspending the privilege of free trans
portation in bond across the territory of the
United States to Mexico failed of good re
sult, as is stated in report No. 702 of the
house of representatives, submitted in the
last session, March 11, 1898. As the ques

concurrent legislation of the two countries

ments for the information and the consid

tlcular provisions It is desired to annul
in the hope of reaching an agreement
whereby the remaining articles may be
SrovlBlonally saved.
Ambassador to Russia,
His majesty, the czar, having announced
his purpose to raise the imperial Russian
mission at this capital to the rank of an
embassy, I responded, under the authority
conferred by the act of March 8, 1898, by
commissioning and accrediting the actual
representative at St. Petersburg In the ca
pacity of ambassador extraordinary ani)
plenipotentiary. The Russian ambassador
to this country has since presented his cre
dentials.
CZAR'S PHAGE! PROPOSAL,
An Annrance Given of Onr Readiness
to Talce Part In the Convention.
The proposal of the czar for a general re
duction of the vast military establishments
that weigh so heavily upon many peoples
In time of peace, was communicated to this
government, with an earnest Invitation to
be represented in the conference which It
Is contemplated to assemble with a view
to discussing the means of accomplishing
so desirable a result. Bis majesty was at
once Informed of the cordial sympathy of
this government with the principle In
volved in hiB exalted proposal, and of the
readiness of the United States to take part
In the conference. The active military
foroe of the United States as measured by
our population, territorial area, and tax
able wealth, is, and under any conceivable
prospective conditions must continue to be.
In time of peace so conspicuously less than
that of the armed powers to whom the
czar's appeal is especially addressed, that
the question can have for us no practical
Importance save as marking an auspicious
step toward the betterment of the condition
of the modern peoples, and the cultivation
of peace and good will among them but In
this view it behooves us as a nation to lend
countenance and aid to the beneficent
projeot.
The claims of owners of American seal
ing vessels for seizure by Russian cruis
ers In Behring sea are being pressed to a
settlement. The equities of the cases justi
fy the expectation that a measure of rep
aration will eventually be accorded In har
mony with precedent and in tho light of the
proven faots.
The recommendation made in my special
message of April 27 last Is renewed, that
appropriation De made to reimburse the
master and owners of the Russian bark
Hans for wrongful arrest of the master
and detention of the vessel In February,
1896, by officers of the United States dis
trict court for the southern district, of
Mississippi. The papers accompanying my
said message make out a most meritorious
claim, and justify the urgency with which
it has been presented by the government
of Russia.

Relations with Switzerland.
Immediately upon the outbreak of the
war with Bpaln the Swiss government, ful
filling the nigh mission It has deservedly
assumed as the patron of the International
Red Cross, proposed to the United States
and Spain that they should severally rec
ognize and carry into execution, as a modus
vlvendi, during the continuance of hostil
ities the additional articles proposed by
the International conference at Geneva,
Ootober 20, 1SG8, extending the effects of
the existing Red Cross convention of 1864
to the conduct of naval war. Following
the example set by France and Germany
in 1870 in adopting such a mdus vlvendi
ana in view of the accession of the United
States to those additional articles in 1882,
although the exchange of ratifications
thereof still remain tmeffected, the Swiss
proposal was promptly and cordially ac
cepted by us and simultaneously by Spain.
This government feels a keen satisfaction
in having thus been able to testify its ad
herence to the broadest principles of hu
manity even amidst the clash of war, and
It is to be hoped that the extension of the
Red Cross compact to hostilities by sea
as well as on land may soon become an ac
complished fact through the general pro
mulgation of the additional naval Red
CrosB articles by the maritime powers now
parties to the convention of 1864.
The important question of the claim of
Switzerland to the perpetual cantonal alli
ance of American citizens of Swiss origin
has not made hopeful progress toward a
solution, and controversies in this regard
still continue.
Claims Aaralnat Turkey.
The newly accredited envoy of the United
States to the Ottoman porte carries In
structions looking to the disposal of mat
ters In controversy with Turkey for a num
ber of years. He Is especially charged to
press for a Just settlement of our claims for
Indemnity by reason of the destruction of
the property of American missionaries
resident In that country during the Ar
menian troubles of 1895 as well as for the
recognition of older claims of equal just
ness. He is also instructed to seek an ad
justment of the dispute growing out of the
refusal of Turkey to recognize the acquired
citizenship of Ottoman-born persons natur
alized in the United States since 1869, with
out prior imperial consent and in the same
general relation he is directed to endeavor
to bring about a solution of the question
which nas more or less acutely existed
since 1869 concerning the jurisdictional
rights of the United States in matters of
criminal procedure and punishment under
article IV of the treaty of 1830. This latter
difficulty grows out or a verbal difference,
claimed by Turkey to be essential, between
the original Turkish text and the pro
mulgated translation. After more than
two years from the appointment of a consul
of this country to Erzeroum he has re
ceived hii exequateur.
Great Britain and Venexnela.
The arbitral tribunal appointed under the
treaty of February, 1897, between Great
Britain and Venezuela to determine the
boundary line between the latter and the
colony of British Guiana is to convene at
Paris during the present month. It is a
source of much gratification to this gov
ernment to see the friendly resort of arbi
tration applied to the settlement of this
controversy not alone because of the earn
est part we have had in bringing about the
result, but also because the two members
named on behalf of Venezuela, Mr. Chief
Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice Brewer,
ohosen from our highest court, at
ately testify the continuing interest
in the definitive adjustment of the ques
tion according to the strictest rules of Jus
tice. The British members, Lord Herscnell
and Sir Richard Collins are Jurists of no
less exalted repute, while the fifth mem
ber and president of the tribunal, M. F. De
Martens, has earned a worldwide reputa
tion as an authority upon International
law.
The claim of Felipe Scandella against
Venezuela for arbitrary expulsion and In
Jury to his business has been adjusted by
the revocation of the order of expulsion
and by the payment of the sum of $16,000.
Bureau of American Republic*.
I have the satisfaction of being able to
etate that the bureau gt the Ami
publics, created in ir
erloan re
at the organ for
promoting commercial Intercourse and fra
ternal relations among the countries of
the western hemisphere, ha» become a
more efficient Instrument of the wise pur
poses of its founders, and Is receiving the
oordlal support of the contributing mem
bers or tbe International union, which are
actually represented in Its board of man
agement. A commercial directory, in two
volumes, containing a mass of statistical
matter descriptive of the industrial ana
oommerclal interests of the various coun
tries has been printed in English, Spanish,
Portuguese and French, and a monthly
es has been
'ortuguese ai_ ....
iulletln li published in these four lan
guagea and distributed in the Latln-Ameri
can countries as wel! as in the United
States, has proved to be a valuable me
dium for disseminating information and
furthering the varied Interests of the In
ternational union.
During tbe past year the Important work
of collecting Information of practical bene
fit to American industries and trade,
through the agency of the diplomatic and
oonsular officers has been steadily ad
vanced, and in order to lay such data be
fore tbe public with the least delay the
praotlce was begun In January, 1898, of
Issuing the commercial reports from day
to day, as they are received by the de
partment of state. It Is believed that for
promptitude as well as fullness of Informa
tion the service thus supplied to our mer
chants and manufacturers will be found
to show sensible Improvement and to mer
it the liberal support of congress.
Burdens and Waste of War.
The experiences of the last year bring
forcibly home to UB a sense of the burdens
and the waste of war. We desire in com
mon with most civilized nations,to reduce
to tbe lowest possible point the damage
sustained in time of war by peaceable
trade and commerce. It is true we may suf
fer In auch cases less than other commu
nities, but all nations are damaged mora
or less by the state of uneasiness and ap
prehension into which an outbreak of hos
tilities throws the entire commercial world.
It should be our object, therefore, to min
imize, as far as practicable, this inev
itable loss and dfs'
table loss and disturbance. This pur
gose can probably be best accomplished
by an international agreement to regard
all private property at sea as exempt from
iture or destruction by the forces of
*a
fcefllgerent powers." The" United States
overnment has for many years advocated
this humane and beneficent principle, and
Is now in position to recommend it to other
powers without the imputation of selfish
motiveB. I therefore suggest for your con
sideration that the executive be author
ized to correspond with the governments
of the principle maritime powers with a
view of incorporating into the permanent
law of civilized nations the principle of
the exemption of all private property at
•ea, not contraband or war, from capture
or destruction by belligerent powers.

Recommendation Renewed.
I renew so muoh of my recommendation
of December, 1897. as follows: "That
when any of the United States notes are
presented for redemption in gold and are
redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept
and set apart and only paid out in exchange
for gold. This Is an obvious duty.. It
tbe holder of the United States note pre
fers the gold and gets it from the govern
ment, he should not receive back from
the government a United States note with
out paying gold in exchange for it. The
reason for this Is made all the more ap
parent when the government Issues an In
terest-bearing debt to provide gold for the
redemption of United States notes—a non
lnterest-bearlng debt. Surely it should not
pay them out again except on demand and
for gold. If they are put out in any other
way they may return again, to be followed
by another bond issue to redeem them
—another interest-bearing debt to re
deem a non-interest-bearing debt." This
hecommendation was made In the belief
that such provisions of law would Insure
to a greater degree the safety of the pres
ent standard and better protect our cur
rency from the dangers to which It li
subjected from a disturbance la the gen
eral business conditions of the country.
Other Currency Legislation Needed*
In my judgment the present condition of
the treasury amply justifies the Immedi
ate enactment of the legislation recom
mended one year ago,* unaer which a por
tion of the gold holdings should be placed
in a trust fund from which greenbacks
should be redeemed upon presentation, but
when once redeemed should not thereafter
be paid out except for gold. It is not to
be Inferred that other legislation relating
to our currenoy is not required on the
contrary there is an obvious demand for
It. The importance of adequate provision
which will Insure to our future a money
standard related as our money standard
now and to that of our commercial rivals
is generally recognized. The companion
proposition that our domestic paper cur
rency shall be kept safe and yet be so re
lated to the needs of our industries and
internal commerce as to be adequate ana
responsive to such needs Is a proposition
scarcely less important. The subject, In all
its parts, is commended to the wise con
sideration of the congress.
MARITIME! POLICY NEBDiDD.
The Acquirement of Foreign Terri
tory Compels It» Prompt Adoption.
The annexation of Hawaii and the
changed relations of the United States to
Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines, re
sulting from the war, compel the prompt
adoption of a maritime policy by the
United States. There shuld be established
regular and frequent steamship communi
cation, encouraged by the United States,
under the American flag, with the newly
acquired islands. Spain furnished to Its
colonies, at the annual cost of about $2,000,
000, steamship lines communicating with
a portion of the world's markets ae well
as with trade centers of the home gov
ernment. The United States will not un
dertake to do less. It is our duty to fur
nish tbe people of Hawaii with facilities,
under national control, for their export and
import trade. It will be conceded that the
present situation calls for legislation which
shall be prompt, durable and liberal. The
part which American merchant veseels and
their Beamen performed in the war with
Spain demonstrates that this service, fur
nishing both pickets and the second line
of defense, is a national necessity, and
should be encouraged in every constitu
tional way. Details and methods for the
accomplishment of this purpose are dis
cussed in the report of the secretary of the
treasury, to which the attention of oori
gresB is respectfully invited.
Protection Against Veliovr Fever.
In my last annual message I recommend
ed that congress authorize the appointment
of a commission for the purpose of making
systematic Investigations with reference
to the cause and prevention of yellow fe
ver. This matter has acquired an Increased
importance as a result of the military oc
cupation of the island,of Cuba and the
commercial intercourse between this
island and the United States which we
have every reason to expect. The sanitary
problems connected with our new relations
with the island of Cuba and the acquisl*
tion of Porto Rico are no less important
than those relating to finance, commerce
and administration. It is my earnest de
Sire that these problems may be consid
ered by competent experts and that every
thing may be done which the most re
advances In sanitary science can offer Tor
the protection of the health of our sol
diers in those islands and of our citizens
who are exposed to the dangers of Infec
tion from tne Importation of yellow fever.
I therefore renew my recommendation that
the authority of congress may be given
and a suitable appropriation made to pro
vide for a commission of experts to be ap
pointed for the purpose Indicated.
THE STANDING ARMY.
The Importance of lis Increase Is
1'ululed Out.
Under the act of congress approved
April 26, 1898, authorizing the president in
his discretion, upon a declaration of war
by congress, or a declaration by congress
that war exists, 1 directed the increase
of the regular army to the maximum of
62,000, authorized In said act. There are
now in the regular army 67,862 officers and
men. In said act it was provided "that
at the end of any war in which the United
States may become Involved the army shall
be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer
In the same arm of service or absorption
by promotion or honorable discharge un
der such regulations as the secretary of
war may establish of supernumerary com
missioned officers and the honorable dis
charge or transfer of supernumerary en
listed men and nothing contained in this
act shall be construed as authorizing the
permanent increase of the commissioned
or enlisted force cif the regular army be
yond that now provided by the Ifiw in
force prior to the passage of this act, ex
cept as to the increase of £5 majors pro
vided for In section 1 hereof."
The Importance of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest, and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualilied approval. "There can be no
question that at this time and prpbably
for some time in the future, 100,000 mcp will
be none too many to meet the necesslt'ieci
of the situation. At all events, whether
that number shall be required permanently
or not, the power should be given to the
president to enlist that force If In his dis
cretion it should be necessary and the
further discretion should be given him tp
recruit within the above limit from the
Inhabitants of the islands with the gpv
ernment of which we are charged.
It is'my purpose to muster out the en
tire volunteer army as soon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be only
an act of Justice and will be much appre
ciated by the brave men who left tbelr
Jiangs

THE PACIFIC RAI1.WAYS.
Plan Adopted (or MAKING the UOT
rrnment Secure.
In my last annual message I stated: "The
Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold
under the decree of the United States court
for the district of Nebraska, the 1st and
2nd of November of this year. The amount
due the government consisted of the prin
cipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,236,612, and
the accrued Interest thereon, $31,211,611.07,
making the total indebtedness $58,448,228.75.
The bid at the sale covered the first mort
gage lien and the entire mortgage claim of
the government, principal and Interest."
This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon
cluded. By a decree of the court in that
case an upset price for the property was
fixed at a sum which would yield to the
government only $2,600,000 upon its lien.
The sale at the Instance of the government
was postponed first to December 15, 1897,
and later upon the application of the
United States was postponed to February
16, 1898. Having satisfied myself that the
Interests of the government required that
an effort should be made to obtain a larger
sum I directed the secretary of the treas
ury, under the act passed March S, 1887, to
pay out of the treasury to the persons en
titled to receive the same the amounts due
upon all prior mortgages upon the eastern
and middle divisions of said railroad out
of any money In the treasury not other
wise appropriated. Whereupon the attor
ney general prepared a petition to be pre
sented to the court offering to redeem said
prior liens in such manner as the court
might direct, and praying that thereupon
the United States might be held to be
subrogated to all the rights of said.prior
lien holders and that a receiver might be
appointed to take possession of the mort
gaged premises ana maintain and operate
the same until the court or congress other
wise directed. Thereupon the reorganiza
tion committee agreed that If said .petition
was withdrawn and the sale allowed to pro
ceed on February 16 they would bid a sura
at the sale which would realize to the gov
ernment the entire prlnnipal of its debt, $8,
308,000. Believing that no better price could
be obtained and appreciating the difficul
ties under which the government would
labor if it should become the purchaser ot
the road at the sale, in the absence of any
authority by congress to take charge of
and operate the road, I directed that upon
of
transaction the government secured an ad
vance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum
which the court had fixed as the upset
price, and which the reorganization com
mittee had declared was the maximnm
which they would pay for the property.
It is a gratifying fact that tne result of
these proceedings against the UniomPa
clfic system and the Kansas Pacific line
Is that the government has received on
account of its subsidy claim the sun of
$64,751,223.75, an increase of $18,997,163.?5 over
the sum which the reorganization commit
tee originally agreed to bid for tho Joint
property, the government receiving Its
whole claim, principal and interest, in the
Union Pacific and the principal of its debt
on the Kansas Pacific railroad. Steps have
been taken to foreclose the government's
lien upon the Central Pacific Railroad com
pany, but before action was commenced
congress passed an set, approved July 7,
1898, creating a commission consisting of
the secretary of the treasury, tne attor
ney-general and the secretary of the in
terlsr and their successors in office, with
full power to settle the Indebtedness to
the government growing out of the issue
of bonds in aid of construction of the Cen
tral Pacific and Western Pacific bond-aided
railroads, subject to the approval of the
president. No report has yet been made
•to me by the commission thus created.
Whatever action is had looking to a set
tlement of the Indebtedness Fn accord
ance with the act referred to will be duly
submitted to congress.
NEW BUILDING NEEDED.
Structure Inadequate to Require
ments of Department of Justice.
I deem it my duty to call to the attention
of congress the condition of the present
building occupied by the department of Jus
tice. The business of that department has
increased very greatly since it was es
tablished in Its present quarters. The
building now occupied by it is neither
large enough nor ot suitable arrangement
for the proper accommodation of tbe busi
ness of the department. The supervising
architect has pronounced it unsafe and un
sulted to tbe use to wlilch It is put. The
attorney general In bis report states that
the library of the department is on the
fourth floor, »nd that all the space al
lotted to It Is so crowded with books as
to dangerously overload the structure. The
first floor Is occupied by the court of claims.
The building Is of an old and'dila-pidiated
appearance, unsulted to tho dignity which
should attach to this important depart
ment. A proper regard for the safety, com
fort and convenience of the officers and
employes would Justify the expenditure
of a liberal sum of money In the erection
of a new building of commodious propor
tions and handsome appearance upon tbe
secured for
occu
pied by the present structure and adjoin
ing vacant to that, comprising in all front
age of 201 feet on Pennsylvania avenue
and a depth of 186 feet.
In this connection I may likewise refer
to the Inadequate accommodations provided
for the supreme court In the capltol and
suggest the wisdom of making provision
for the erection of a separate building for
the court and its officers and ltbrary upon
available ground near the capltol.
The Postal Service.
The postal service of the country ad
vances with extraordinary growth. Within
*20 years both the revenues and the expendi
tures of the post office department have
multiplied threefold. In the last ten years
they nave nearly doubled. Our postal busi
ness grows much more rapidly than our
on. It now Involves an expendi
ure of $100,000,000 a year, numbers 73,000
post offices and enrolls 200,000 employes.
This remarkable extension of a service
which is an accurate index of the public
conditions presents gratifying evidence of
the advancement of education, of the in
crease of communication and business ac
tivity, and of the Improvement of ma|l
facilities leading to their constantly aug
menting use.
Demand* of the \V^r.
The war with cipaln laid new and excep
tional labors on the post office department.
The mustering of the military and naval
forces of the united States required special
mall arrangements for every camp and
every campaign. The communication be
tween home and camp was naturally eager
and expectant. In some of the larger
ilaces of rendezvous as many as 50,000 let
req
it
per
an
mentalities of the railway mall and post
pi
ter» a day required handling. This neces
slty was met by tbe prompt detail and dls-
fIshed
atoh
of experienced men from the ett'ab
force and oy directing all the Instru
mentalities of the railway mall and post
office service as far as necessary to this
new need. Congress passed an act empow
ering the postmaster-general to establish
qffioes or branches at every military camp
or station, and under this authority the
postal machinery was speedily put into
effective operation.
Under the same authority, when our
forces moved upon Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines, they were attended and
followed by the postal aervice. Though
the act of songress authorized Che appoint
ment of postmasters where necessary, It
was early determined that the public in
terests would be best subserved not by
new designations, but by the detail of ex
perienced men familiar with every branch
of the service, and this policy was steadily
followed. When the territory which was
the theater of conflict came into our pos
session, it became necessary to reestablish
mail facilities for the resident population
as well as to provide them for our forces
of occupation, and the former requirement
was met through the extension and appli
cation of the latter obligation. 1 gave the
requisite authority, and the same general
principle was applied to this as to other
branches of civil administration under
military occupation." The details are
more particularly given In the report of
tbe postmaster-general, and, while the work
is only just begun, It is pleasing to be able
to say that the service in the territory
which has come under our control Is al
ready materially
Improved.<p></p>MiLir
