CULTURE OFJHE HAND.
Ileauty of This Important Member
Depend Ilntlrel (poll Hon
It Is Cared I'eir.
There Is just one thing a woman suf
fering from b nil kept h mtls must m ike
up her mind to do, never to rel ix her t ire
of them for a single tl ly. Weeks and even
mouths m.t be spent in doctoring red
hinds, coarse hinds, h trt! hinds, this vig
ilance to be completer wortnless It but a
few dajs of in mention are ever permitted.
The thst move to make, when a cure of
distressing! unkept hands is to be ef
fected, is to supply two kinds of hand cov
ers, one of i ubbcr for lie ivy work nnd one
of ch imois to wear after the hinds have
been giv en a cream m issagtx These cham
ois gloves can be made nt home with xery
little trouble. Thev should be large and
holes must be cut in the palms to secure
ventilation
One of the verv best things for e h ippeti
hinds Is a solution of glvcerine and lose
water. A little povvdeied borax m ly be
sirlnklcd into this oltl-f lslnoned but help
ful lotion 'Ihe propoitions are one-third
water to two-thirds glvtirine. After the
binds hive bet n w ishetl, drop on the ir
b icks some of this lotion, tub it well into
the skin ami then wipe tin m very, very
dry. Of all bitliroom lilies for beiutlfing
the hands, this one of wiping them dr
is the most important. The skin that is
the least bit sensitive, if not thoroughly
tlried, iecomes reddened ind toughened to
such a state in a short time tint the owner
of the miserable feeling hinds will be well
nigh in ilespair.

Topeka. K.is , Dec. II (Special) Annie
L Diggs, wlio is soon to be state llhrari t.i.
was here to-d i for a short time, bhe per
formed three missions. 'Ihe llrst was to
read the riot act to one ot Toptkas "re
lnble" newspipers for an article it print, il
accusing her of attempting to hold up tin
present force of deputies in the state li
brary for a portion ot their salaries. After
compelling that p iper to "take it b iek."
sho held i consult ition with tlie supreme
court justices in refe rente to the man ige
nient of the state llbrar. The list mis
sion was that of giving out a rather brt czv
Intel view concerning state aftairs.
To The Journal correspondent si'O de
cl ired that it was generally understood
among Populist It ulcrs tli.tt an extra ses
sion ot the legislature would 'oon be
called. Populist leaders hive been xerv
reticent about that question., and it is
birelv possible that Mrs. Digg's, womanlike-,
has let this eat out of the bag.
'I don't know what tlie li gislature will
do," said she, m a sort of a mournful
tone, her mind evidently drifting back to
the disgraceful actions of the Pups last
winter, "but I do know what should be
taken up Hist. The metropolit in police law
should be repealed the lirst da. It is un
democratic and vicious, and downs cv co
administration in Kansas that attempts to
earrv it
' The next most important question, ac
coiding to my xvav of thinking, is coal oil
Inspection. A stringent 1 iw should be
passed governing that depirtment. It is a
source of too much corruption and scandal
under the present svstem.
"The question which ranks thud In im
portance is the railroad question We
should enact some railro id law. The Pop
ulists owe It to the people. We promised
it. Of eouise. they expected a maximum
liw. with schedules lixed bj the Iegisla
tuie, but would no doubt now be satisfied,
if a law giving the railroad commission, rs
power to UK rates should be passed. Rut
some law must be passed governing rail
roads. "Rut would it not be dreadful if tlie leg
islature got together and acted like it did
last winter.'" mused Mrs. Disgs in a sor
rowful tone "If it is likelv to do tint,
then it would be wise for the governor
never to call It together."
Asked whit she thought of the attack
made bv Representative W. P. Rrown on
Senator Harris, she emphatically stated
tint Rrown hid mule a serious mistikt.
Sho said that his attack had not injured
Sinatoi Harris in the least, that what
ever aspirations Rrown had were now
blasted. Tho people h itl lost confidence in
him, and also their respect for him.
