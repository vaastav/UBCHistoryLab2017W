THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE—SOME RE
FLECTIONS.
There seems to be an irresistible im
pulse on the part of small men to write
big documents. The messages of Presi
dent Harrison have been distinguished
by that tediousness which old Polonius
called the limbs and outward flourishes
of wit. He begins his present very
voluminous document with a lengthy
review,of our foreign relatione, after the
traditional manner. In his summing
up of the government finances the claim
is made that the estimated receipts for
the year 1890 will be $15,147,790.58 in
excess of the expenditures. Adding this
to a cash balance which is claimed to be
in the treasury, we will have a sur
plus of $67,147,790.58 as the sum avail
able for the redemption of outside bonds
and other uses. If thia be true, it is
somewhat singular that the national
debt was allowed to increase almost five
million dollars last month, as the pub
lished statements of the treasury de
partment show to have been the case. The
president assumes to be a genuine
friend of silver, and says that the act
has been administered in good faith, and
with the view of getting the largest pos
sible amount of that commodity in cir
culation. He thinks that the monetary
troubles in England will lead to a recon
sideration of the English attitude towards
the white metal. He favors an inter
national conference looking to con
cert of action on the matter. He
asserts that his administration has
done much to relieve the mon
etary stringency existing in the United
States, making the statement that dur
ing the nineteen months in which Mr.
Windom has been at the head of the
treasury department the circulation has
been increased $93,880,814, or $1.50 per
capita. He felicitates the country on
the diminution of the national debt,
which he says has been reduced from
the 4th of March, 1889, $211,832,460, at a
cost of $240,620,741, through the pur
chase of 4,Vjj per cents. He next passes
to a review of the newly created customs
board, for which he claims great effi
ciency, and to a summary of the routine
work of the war, navy, postoffice and
other departments. He favors the
energetic prosecution of coast de
fenses, and assertf|| that some of
his postmasters have been inter
fered with. He touches upon a great
variety of topics, including fraudulent
naturalizations, the Mormons, the six
new states, the census, apportionment
of members of congress, public build
ings, and last, but not least, the farmers.
Mr. Harrison assumes that there has
been a great increase in the prices of
farm and stock products. He has the
hardihood to congratulate the fifty-first
congress on what he calls its good work,
and in a discussion on the tariff he en
deavors to put in a good word for Brother
McKinley. According to the presi
dent, it is not the tariff itself,
but the "shenanigin" of the
business men that was responsible
for the enhanced prices of commodities,
and the consequent disgust of business
men. He hopes for good results upon
the national prosperity, and probably
upon the fortunes of the Republican
party, though he does not write the lat
ter clause, after the act shall have had a
fair trial. He has a good word for
Brother Blame's reciprocity plan, and
glances at the unfinished legislation of
the last session of congress, which he
thinks should be expedited. He recom
mends a more liberal policy in granting
subventions to steamers for carrying the
mails between Australian and South
American ports,and concludes with some
minor notes of no great public interest.
The message is in every respect a very
commonplace and wordy production. It
is not characterized by the aggressive
air of that which he addressed to the
first session of the Fifty-first congress.
Even Benjamin Harrison has shown
that he can learn something. Tiie im
mense shadow cast by his grandfather's
hat has not filled the drums of his ears
with wax. He sings small on his fine
plan of investing the members of the
supreme court of the United States with
more than the monarchical privileges
that hedged around the lord chancellor
of England in the days of Wolsey and
Sir Thomas More. He is not fanatically
devoted to the force bill. Iv fact, Ben
is a much subdued man. We can con
done his anxiety to protect his post
masters in view of the fact that
he does not positively froth at the
mouth about the necessity of putting
the federal elections under the control
of federal bayonets. In fact, with a
little more time, we can hope for great
things from Benjamin—things as great,
at least, as any man could reasonably
expect from such a feeble-forcible sort
of a personage. If, by the end of his
term, he can be brought to realize that
THE LOS ANGKUg HF.RALD; TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, 1890
the private station is the post of honor
as far as he is concerned, and that
there may be a lucky scratch in
politics as in billiards, -something will
have been accomplished. The esteemed
oocnpant of the White House was rapidly
getting an attack of the "big head," or,
to employ a grandiose Latin form, he
was gravitating towards a virulent de
velopment of the disease known as cap
itis elephantiasis, when, happily, the
late elections came to his aid and re
duced the alarming manifestation. His
head is now normal; and, consequently,
his maunderings do not savor so much
of lunacy as in the brave days of old,
when he thought the United States
were created for the special behoof of
the radical wing of the Republican
j party. ___________
THE RESULTS AND THEIR LESSONS.
The election Is over, and its results
are before us. All things considered,
they are satisfactory from an honest
Democratic point of view. The city is
fairly Republican under circumstances
to draw out a strict party vote. The
vote polled yesterday was a heavy one,
being almost as large as at the state
election a month ago. The Democratic
primaries were unfairly and badly
handled, and, as a result, a most un
desirable element was introduced into
the convention to so large a degree as to
control its action. As was natural, a
ticket notoriously objectionable in
some of its elements and lamentably
weak in others, was presented. These
circumstances amounted to a serious
handicap in the race. That it should do
so is to be regretted beyond expression,
whether the interest of the city or of
the Democratic party is considered. The
ring that has controlled affairs here for
two years past was so thoroughly un
popular that the temper of the people
was all in favor of a change. A clear
majority of the Republican party was
ready and anxious to rebuke the impu
dence, selfishness and corruption of its
own officials by a genuine political up
heaval that would have buried almost
the entire ticket under a heap of political
ruin. All they wanted was that we
should give them an opportunity to elect
a thoroughly responsive and patriotic
city government. Instead of wisely
taking the time by the forelock, we
threw away our opportunity in a most
disgraceful way.
The danger was that we would become
so obnoxious in the eyes of the people
that no discrimination would be made,
but that good men would go down
in the common mire with the
bad. But the intelligence of the voters
has generally proved equal to the emer
gency. With our own party in open
revolt against a large ratio of its ticket,
with a large Republican majority to
overcome, with a triangular light on
our hands at many points, the wonder
is that we were able to elect a man.
These are the elements in the situa
tion. What are the results? The ob
jectionable men on cur ticket are
pounded to a jelly, as they ought to be.
The weak ones are left distanced in the
race, a 9 ought to be also. But wher
ever we put up really representative
men, who have the confidence of their
fellow-citizens, we have either elected
them by good majorities—in some in
stances by enormous figures—or we
have so cut down the big majorities of
the enemy as to make their apparent
victory a substantial defeat.
The net results are the election of the
city engineer by a sweeping majority,and
possibly of the street superintendent
by a close one. At the last city election
we did not get a man on the general
ticket. We get three councilmen of
ability and sterling integrity to curb any
programme of extravagance or boodling
that may crop up in that body. V\'e
barely missed the election of three
others of as good material, in wards
largely Republican. This is against not
one councilman two years ago. Had tha
ticket been what it should have been,
we would have very nearly swept the
board.
Our local columns contain a pretty
full resume of the vote by wards and
precincts. Tomorrow we hope to Dre
sent the whole vote in tabular form.
The figures afford a most interesting
and instructive lesson. They demon
strate the fact that the voters exercised
their privilege of the franchise with
great' discrimination. "Scratching"
was almost universal iv all parties, and
the wheat was pretty thoroughly
winnowed from the chaff. Anyone who
will glance along the precincts and see
how a representative man, one respon
sive to the popular will, ran ahead of
his party vote, and how some other one
of the other stripe failed to get his party
vote, will be edified. It ought to be a
lesson to those wtio make tickets to con
sult somewhat the interests and views
of the electors, and it ought to
be a lesson to men with a record not
to thrust their heads into too great
prominence when injurious missiles are
flying so thick, with the fury of an
enraged people projecting them.
The latest indications are that in ad
dition to the above we elect two mem
bers of the board of education, but that
the street superintendent may unfortu
nately be beaten.
Republican papers are falling into the
reprehensible habit of using very offen
sive epithets when they wish to inveigh
strongly against the Democratic party.
Tiie word "cowardly" seems to be a
very favorite adjective with them. The
other day the Express of this city rolled
this delicious word under its tongue
every time it wanted to say something
scathing about the dilatory tactics of
the late Democratic convention. The
San Francisco Chronicle now denounces
the Democratic party for arraigning the
Republicans upon the enormous figure
to which the pension list lias reached,
and says that the Democracy should
legislate for its reduction instead of
adopting the "cowardly" plan of de
nouncing Republican extravagance, j
The Republican -party is sensible of its
weakness, but is not brave enough to
meet calmly the just criticism which its
"cowardly" obsequiousness to-the pen
sioners for the sake of their votes justly
merits.

FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
THE SECOND SESSION FORMALLY
OPENED.
Most of the Members in Their Seats—The
Presidont's Message Read and Re
ferred—New Bills Introduced.
Washington, Dec. I.—With the excep
tion of a few seats reserved for the
president's family and the diplomatic
corps, every available seat in the vast
galleries which surround the chamber of
the house of representatives was occu
pied early in the forenoon, by spectators
eager to witness the proceedings attend
ing the opening of the second session of
the fifty-first congress. The stairs lead
ing to tho wide portals were utilized as
resting places, and the open doors fur
nished ''standing room only" to belated
arrivals. The dull leaden sky which
overhung the city, served to
make it rather gloomy, but the gloom
was almost dispelled by the roars of
laughter which came from the cloak
rooms, and by the animated conversa
tion which took place upon the floor.
The Democrats were especially joyous,
and the Republicans were obliged to put
up with a great deal of good-natured
badgering. A tasteful pyramid of flow
ers adorned the speaker's desk.
Heed's Gavel Falls.
At noon Speaker Reed entered the
hall, and the rap of his gavel instantly
restored order. After prayer by the
chaplain, the clerk proceeded to call the
roll by states. The call disclosed the
presence of 227 members, and the clerk
was directed to inform the senate that
a quorum of the house had appeared,
and that the body was ready to proceed
to business.
On motion of Cannon, of Illinois, a
resolution was adopted for the appoint
ment of a committee to join a similar
committee on the part of the senate to
wait upon the president to notify him
that congress was ready to receive any
communication he might see tit to trans
mit.
New Members Sworn In.
The speaker stated that there were
various credentials upon bistable which
he would present, which credentials
were then read as follows: 0. R, Breck
inridge, second Arkansas; Willis Sweet,
Idaho; T. W. Stone, twenty-seventh
Pennsylvania, and Clarence D. Clark,
Wyoming.
These gentlemen t hen appeared at the
bar of the house and were duly qualified,
Breckinridge receiving a round of ap
plause from his Democratic friends.
John S. Pindar, thirty-fourth New
York district; E. R. Hayes, seventh
lowa, and Robert Whitelaw, fourteenth
Missouri, qualified as representatives,
notwithstanding the non-arrival of their
credentials.
The speaker laid before the house the
credentials of David A. Harvey, as dele
gate from the territory of Oklahoma,
and upon motion of Perkins, of Kansas,
the oath of office was administered to
him.
The house then took a recess till 1:30
to allow the committee to notify the
president.
The President's Message Kend.
On reassembling, the president's mes
sage was read. The reading of the docu
n ent consumed one hour and a half.
At the conclusion of the reading, the
Republicans warmly applauded.
On motion of Mckinley of Ohio, the
message was referred to the committee
of the whole.
Morrow of California, from the com
mittee on appropriations, reported the
pension appropriations bill. Referred
to tbe committee of the whole.
Adjourned.
THE SENATE.
Large Attendance and Good l'eellng at
the Opening Seaalon.
Washington, Dec. I.—There was an
unusually large attendance of senators
at the opening of today's session. The
seats on both sides of the ehaml>er were
were nearly all occupied aud the galler
ies rilled. Cordiality seemed to prevail
between the senators of both parties,
who greeted each other as the best of
friends, whom political reverses could
not estrange.
Directly after the chaplain's prayer
the credentials of the senators-elect
from Wyoming were presented by Hoar.
When they were read, Senators Carey
aud Warren were escorted to the vice
president's desk by Stanford and Hoar,
and took thn oath of office. Drawing by
lot to decide their respective terms took
place, the shorter term, closing March
3, 1894, falling to Warren, and the longer
term, closing March 3, 1895, to Carey
Resolutions fixing the daily hour of
meeting at 12, and provisions for in
formiag the president and house that
the senate was in session and ready to
proceed to business, were offered by Ed
munds and agreed to. Then the senate
took a recess until half-past one.
After the recess a report was made
from the committee to wait or. the presi
dent, and immediately afterwards the
president's message was delivered by
his secretary, and read by McCook, sec
retary of the senate. When the reading
was finished, at 2:15, the senate ad
journed until tomorrow.
OKDKK OF BUSINESS.
Tho Republicans of Koth Houses Discuss
Their Mue of Action.
Washin ((ton-, Deo. I.—After a lengthy
discussion this afternoon, the Republi
can senatorial caucus agreed that tiie
elections bill shall lie taken up tomor
row, with the understanding that it be
kept before that body until finally acted
upon. Furthermore, to guard against
the expected opposition from the Demo
cratic minority, in the line of dilatory
tactics, a committee of five senators
was appointed to co-operate with
the Republican members of the commit
tee on nil*, in the preparation of a rule
to secure the c osure of debate when de
sired by the majority. The old caucus
committee on order of business was re
appointed and instructed to prepare a
programme to govern the proceedings of
the senate after the elections bill is dis
posed of. It is stated that no votes were
cast against these determinations of the
caucus.
About thirty Republican representa
tives got together thisaftcrnoon after the
adjournment of the house, and informally
discussed the reapportionment question.
Nearly all the leading Republicans were
present. The only conclusions reached
were that for the present there was no
reason to hold a party caucus, and the
census committee should be left, free to
deal with the matter. Several of those
present said no decision was reached as
to whether an apportionment bill should
be passed, but each one personally in
sisted that a bill would unquestionably
be passed.
