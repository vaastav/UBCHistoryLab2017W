The Last Lci,'ilatiirc.
As was noticed last week, the Lcgislature
of Vermont adjourncd on Tuesday morning
after a session of seven weeks lacking tvo
days. The tcrm wa.'. a few days longer than
the average, and was excreded oiily in lcngth
by the memorable assembly oflS53. Among
the noticalilc measures or bills that have
come bcfore the Lcgislature, we will mention
a 'ew' :
The State House claim.orthe bill releas-
ing the Montpdier signers from their obliga-,
tion, was lost ; so this pn.mises to be the
vcxed question for at least one more legisla-
ture. The bill to pay Dr. Powers $7,000 for
his serviccs as superintendent of the build-,
ing of the new edifice, was amended so as to
reducc the sum to $.",,400 and passed.
The bill repealing the grand jury system,
after passing to its third reading was defeat-,
ed. A bill was passed exemptir.g from at-,,.

Dn. Adams ox Slavkky. On Thanksgiv-
ing-day Itev. Xehemiah Adams ot the Jssex ;
street church, Boston, delivered a strong pro-
slavery sermon from the text (Jeremiali l-A-i)
'Out of the North an evil shall break forth I
upon all the inhabitants of the land." He
argued that slavery is a divineinstitution, re
t
cognized as such in the Bible, and claimed
that there would be no peace in the land till
the people recognized and treated it as such.
In speaking of this remarkable sermon of ,
Dr. Adams, the Jloston Journal says :
