Still Another Cut.
Yes, still another cut in prices,
one more slice taken off, and
this time a big one. We did'nt
use an ordinary knife; we used
a carver. Do you know what it
means when we say that we have
reduced our $25 fine dress suits
to $20, it means that these values
cannot be duplicated anywhere
this side the "big muddy." You
pocket the profit and we make
the bast of a bargain which is
good for you and bad for us.
Here's where the carver still
gets in its fine work $10 Over
coats for $8.00. Boys' and chil
dren's overcoats reduced way
out of sight. Big discounts on
fine underwear. Elegant de
signs in Smoking Jackets, Night
Shirts and Holiday Goods.

STRIKE OF TRAIN DISPATCHERS.
El Paso, Tex., Dec 1L The strike of
the telegraph operators between this city
and Yrimn yesterday on the Pacific divis
ion of the Southern Pacific Railway com
pany promises to develop into prrand pro
portions. The superintendent of the Santa
Fe ordered the dispatchers to handle the
Southern Pacific trains between this city
and Deraingr; but the operators refused to
do it and the superintendent was so noti
fied. Nothing had been heard from him
up to 6 p. m. If he tries to force the mat
ter, and puts non-unionists to work, it
means a strike on the whole Santa Fe sys
tem. The operators between Yuma and
Sun Francisco were supposed to have gone
out yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, but
it is believed that Superintendent Noble
has not discharged them yet, though it is
believed tiyit theyx will qnit tonight 01 to
morrow if the obnoxious ultimatum is not
withdrawn and the men already out re
stored. Lite yesterday afternoon the dis
trict superintendent of the Western Union
ordered the men to handle trains between
here and Denimg, but the men would not,
and the matter rests there until the higher
officials are heard from. The Western
Union men have received assurances from
every connection, aud they will stand by
each other in this case. The train men
between here-and. Yuma are holding meet
ings to decide as to whether they shall
take any action in the piesent difficulty.
RUSSELL SAGE'S ASSAILANT.
Boston, Dec. 11. The Globe says:
"Henry I. Norcross, a note broker, doing
business in this city,, has sot been seen at
his office since the middle of last week,
and the oth-r occupants of his Somerville
residence eay that he was -killed in a rail
road accident. Tha New York detectives
today tried to identify the missing man as
the mysterious bomb thrower in Russell
Sage's office. . The detectives brought with
them the trouser buttons and a portion of
the trousers worn by the bomb tnrower,as
w ell as a portion of his coat and portions
of his undet clothing."
According to the Globe, these wero taken
to the Norcross residence this afternoon.
The under clothing was positively identi
fied by Mrs. Norcross as belonging to her
husband. On the trousersDf the dead man
were buttons bearing the imprint,
"Brooks, Tailor, Boston." Pieces of the
clothing were taken to Brooks' store.
There it was positively staled that the
firm had made for Norcross a coat of the
cloth presented and also a pair of trousers
of the same cloth as the other piece fur
nislied by the detectives. Further im es
timation tonight leaves scarcely any doubt
that the bomb thrower and Henry L. Nor
cross are identical.
TRUNK THIEVES.
Saxta Fe, N. M., Dec. 11. Harry C.
Hill, night operator and ticket clerk at the
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe depot;
Waldo Goldsworthy, night baggaeo man,
and Charles Hull, a companion of the two,
were placed under arrest today on the
charge of carrying on a systematic plan of
robbery at the depot. They were caught
in the act of secreting plunder and made
an open confession. Tlieir plan was to
open outgoing trunks and valines left over
at the depot at night, using skeleton keys,
takine only such articles as th y required,
then "locking tho parcels, and sending
them out over the road. In tins manner,
visitors from Denver, San Francisco, Chi
cago. St. Louis and other places became
victims. Some $2,000 worth of stuff was
secured, consisting of clothing, gloves,
watcher and jewelry. A railroad detective
traced the plunder'to their rooms and re
covered the bulk of it. Neither of the
ciimin.Usis over ID years of age. Hill is
from Nickerson, Kan., and Goldswort hy's
home is at Wichita. The men were re
leased on $500 bail each.
PRISON PROSTITUTES.
Savt Lake City. Dec. 11. There were
sensational developments in the prison in
vestigation today. Essie Banks, a female
prisoner, who was placed on the stand by
the defense to refute the statements made
by Ann Prindle and May Forkner of lewd
conduct of tne United States marshal, as
well as to show ttiat he was theAictim of
a conspiracy, was onm:-sked by United
States District Attoruev Yariau, who sub
jected her to a severe cross-examination.
Sue admitted that sne was a prostitute
and had followed that calling in all the
principal cities of the west; that she bad
shot her sister in a frail riot, and that her
"man at the pen" was George Loomis, a
convict undergoing a sentence for iburg
lary, and that be bad access to her cell,
whenever so inclined, for months. Ac
cording to her answers, the women pris
oners were intimate with the guards, and.
in fact, within the- walls" of the woman's
prison, lechery wa3 rampant. Supposed
to be a witness for the defense, she proved
the best witness the prosecution naj had
yet.

. THE CORRESPONDENCE.
The correspondence begins with a note
addressed bv Herr von Munn, charge
d'affaires of Germany.to General John V.
Foster, plenipotentiary extraordinary of
the United States. The note is dated at
Saratoga, N. Y.. August 22, 1S9L It stat
ed that the German government, in vew
of the rigid inspection of meats for export
provided by the United States, was happy
to announce that there was no longer any
cause for maintaining the prohibition of
the importation of hogs, pork and sausage
of American origin. The imperial govern
ment, the note continued, in making that
declaration, based its action upon the sup
position that, after tho abolition of the
German prohibition of importations, the
president of the United States would no
loncerliave occasion for the exercise, as
regarded the German empire, of the dis
cretionary powers conferred upon him by
tho Fifty-first congress. The imperial
government, continued the note, thought
that it had a greater reason for the above
assumption, since it was prepared to
grant to the United States the same reduc
tions in custom duties on agricultural
products that had been granted to Austria-Hungary
and other states.
To this note General Foster replied, the
same day, that he was directed by the pres
ident to state that the withdrawal by Ger
many of the prohibition against American
pork would remove any occasion for the
exercise by the president, as against the
German empire, of the power conferred
upon him by section live of the meat in
spection law. He was further directed to
state that he (the president) accepted the
nction of the imnenai government in pro-
' posing to place the United States among
tne tavorea nations so lar as uirm reuue
tions were concerned, and that when the
German government had officially i eraoved
the prohibition on American pork, he
would cause the necessary orders to bo
given to secure the continued free admis
sion into the United States of the arti
cles and products ol the German empire
enumerated in section three of tho law of
October, 1690.
The third and last of the communica
tions was from Herr von MunJi to Secre
tary Blame, under date of Dec. 10, 1891.
It contained a table of the Austro-Hun-garian
tariff concessions granted by
Germany, which, in accordance with bis
declaration mado on the occasion of the
removal of the decree forbidding the im
portation of swine, pork and sausages of
American origin, likewise accrued to the
benefit of the United States. The note
also contained n copy of the general cus
toms tariff now in force in the German
empire. In the table are included, not
only the articles which in the treaty of
commerce concluded between the German
empire and Austria-Hungary Lave received
a reduction of duties, but also those arti
cles in regard to which an agreement had
been made that is to say, in regard to
which tbo German empire, in accordance
with its negotiations with Austria-Hungary
cannot allow any increase of duties,
as long as the treaty of commerce remains
in force with that country.
The treaty, the note sUted, in conclu
sion, in case of its ratification, would go
into effect on the 1st of February of the
approaching year.
BERLIN. Dec 1L In the reichstag today
Herr Kardorf censured the government
for making too many concessions to the
United States, which country, he said, re
ciprocated by sending pork infested -with
trichinosis to Germany. Chancellor von
Caprivi replied that Germany bad no
right to question the good faith of the
United Stai, which government would
doubtless take every precaution to prevent
the exportation of infected meat fro:n that
country.
PENSION BILLS.
Washington, Dec. 11. The pension
policv will undergo a radical change in
-ome'respt-cts if the bills which Represen
tative R. E. Dotne, a Republican memb-r
from Ohio, propoea to introduce become
laws. He intends to throw tbe burden of
proof upon thejiovernment, and not upua
the claimant, 'fcrho, Mr. Done says, is gen
erally In snch circumstances that he can
not gather that wMcu the pea-ion offic
demands. When tt soldier salUud in tie
array he was examined, and before being
accepted was pronocuced jboand of body
bv the examining board. ThjMr. Daane
proposes to maks pnma facte evidence of
the health of nits claimant at that tim-.
and throwing out tbe present roof ot
I affidavit of the claimant that hs is sofTer
log irora aias9 comrscieu in ujc a m
( ld&n that he is in such condition, is to be
considered sufficient to make out a case.
If the government disputes the claim the
burden of proof will rest upon it and not
the soldier.
Another bill will put the wife of the sol
dier on an f qual footing with the soldier's
mother. Now the mother depeadent upon
the services of her son for support draws it
pension regardless of the number of times
she may marry. The soldier's widow is
estopped the moment she remarries. Col
onel Doane's bill will remove this disabil
ity if it is shown that the widow has not
at the death of tho second husband been
financially profited by the marriage. She
may not be the widow of a soldier, but Mr.
Doane holds that she was the wife of a
soldier, and, if destitute, entitled to the
protection the government has promised.
There recently came under Mr Doane's
observation the case of a one-legged sol
dier who drew a pension, but who suffered
so from his injuries that life was unbeara
ble. To end his misery he committed sui
cide. Death from any causa other than
that upon which the pension was granted
stopped the reveutie. and in this c:ise the
widow and six children were left destitute.
This Colonel Doane proposes to remedy by
permitting the wife to continue to draw
the pension.
THE BLAINE BOOMERS.
cri-ff: rtntl.H;irr:rii mfitlnf nna tiAfil
here last night. Delegates were present
from all parts of the state who reported
lavoraniy on cue iormation ot jjiaine
clubs.. Assurances were uiven that tho
1 new state central commltteo would be
anti-Harrison. The most important
feature of the meeting was the reading of
a letter from ex-Congressman Conger,
who stated that ho had recently had a
long conference with Mr. Blaine in Wash
ington, and that Mr. Blaine assured him
that he would not retire from the field and
that he would accept the presidential
nomination.
The brief reference in the president's
message to the matter of reciprocity was
the subject of elaborate comment. It was
tlio sentiment of the conference that tho
ultra-tariff Idea is not popular; that tho
next campaign, in order to be a winner,
must be made on a reciprocity platform,
and that the president's message read be
tween the Hues is a declaration that he
docs not wish to make the race on that
idea. The meeting was the most enthus
iastic yet held, and each one present testi
fied to tbe growth add spread of the Blaine
sentiment in his locality.
RAILWAY PASSES.
Washington, Dac.ll. Attorney Gener
nl Miller has determined to test the right
of railway companies to issue free passes.
The question to be decided is whether the
issue of such passes is a violation of the
Interstate commerce law. He will shortly
bring suit against one of tho New England
roads known to have issued piuja&i, prob
ably the Boston and Maine road.
CAPITAL NOTES.
Washington, Dec. 11. Speaker Crisp
will probably leave Washington for a few
days, and go to some quiet place where he
cau secure a littio rest, which he greatly
needs after tho wear and tear of his can
vass, and where he can also work undis
turbed on tbe arrangement of tho house
committees.
Richard G. Dove, the oldest employe in
the government service, died today. Ho
was a clerk in the treasury department,
and was appointed to his position in 1823,
during President Jackson's administra
tion. The treasury department today pur
chased 20,000 ounces of silver at 0.9375.
THE COTTON CROP.
Washington. Dec. II. The cotton re
turns to the department of agriculture
relate to average prices on plantations.
The complainC of unremunemtivo values
is general and the, declaration frequent
that the crop does not return cost of pro
duction. A feeling of discouragement
pervades the report and a disposition to
reduce area is expi eased.
The plantation price which is tbe actual
rate for cotton sold at the gin, averages
7 3 cents per pound. For live years preced
ing the range was from 8-1 cents to 8.0
ceuts, and averaged nearly 8.4 cents. This
decline is echoed iu the records of exporta
tion, which averaged in October a value of
8.9 cents against 10 11 cents for October of
last year a drop of 12 per cent. Tho state
averages are as follows: Virginia, 7 cents,
North Carolina, 7.4 cents; South Carolina,
7.4 cents; Georgia, 7.4 cents; Alabama, 7 3
cents; Florida, 7.3 cents: Mississippi, 7.3
cents; Louisiana, 7.3 cents; Texas. 7 cents;
Arkansas, 7.8 ceuts; Tennessee, 7 3 cents.
An almost unexampled season for har
vesting Is reported, with picking, ginning
and marketing far advanced. While tho
fiber is at many pointy short, it is cicau
and of good color.
THE GRAVES TRIAL.
Denver, Dec. 11 The court room In
which the Graves trial Is being held was
densely picked today with the curiout
public, eager to listen to the testimony of
the witnesses
Dr. Readon was recalled and produced,
tbe exhibits of his analysis
Dr. A. M. Holmes testified to his having
been culled on to treat Mrs. Barnaby and
Mrs. Worrell. He called Dr. Griffin into
consultation and, from the symp
toms, they both agreed that botu
ladies were suffering from irritant poUon
ing and treated them accordingly. He
learned that tueir ilines was cau-ed by
about ttwo tablespoon! nl of a liquid each
drank from a bottle, supposing it to be
whisky. He became su-piciou that it
contained poison, and, alter be and Dr.
Griffin had taken out about an ounce for
analysis, tbey sealed up thu bottle and
turned it over to Mr WorrelL
Dr. Bonestelle, tne physician who was
In attendance upon Mrs. Barnaby at the
time she died, gave the most important
testimony of the d-iy. He testified in tbe
most emphatic terms that she died from
arsenical poisoning.

New York, Dec 11. R. G. Dim & Co.,
in their Weekly Review of Trade, sny:
"As the holidnys draw nenr nil slgua In-
dicnte ti large volume of business Ht pres
ent, with growing coufldenco of improve
ment in the future, except in parts of tha
.south, where the unusual accumulation of
cotton and lt3 low price have a depressing
influence.
"There Is no lack of money In any part
of the country except nt some southern
points, and the tuuru fact that the cotton
now accumulated at a few ports mid iti
terior towns represents fully 50.000.000 In
value p-ud to the planters at once expmlni
the difficulty and Mtggets that it is not
permanent. It ii a good Sign also that
collections are, on tho whole, improving,
though slow at sumo southern points, aud
only fair in some lines at eastern cities.
"Reports from all points show very fair
nctivity in "the distribution of merchan
dise. At Chicago Ithe usual incrraso Ii
seen in breadstuff;. uttt the lack of trans
portation through tho country cavuea
ombarrassment, and perhaps part of tho
decline in receipts of cattle, butter and
cheese. Merchandises sales much excred
last yeara and collections nro far ahead.
At St. Louis the holiday trade ban opened
verv s t rone, and a nenarous distribution ii
I seen in heavy clothing, shoes, groceries,
drugs nnd oils. At utnaaa tuo car milium
retards business, and at Kansas City it is
quieter than was expected.
"The expected reduction In tbe prices of
carpets has come, from 10 cents on body"
Brucella to 5 cants on ingrains, which aru
uow said to be cheaper hero than in Eng
land. Print cloths show some Improve
ment and prints are inoro active. Tho
boot and shoe business has clearly increas
ed and the iron business Is mora active
"The monthly crop report gave lltle help
to speculation. Wbeathos been ljf cent
higher and oats lJi centi, with modorato
sate; but corn is 2tf cents lower; pork pro
ducts aio slightly htronger, coffee i cent
and oil 1 cents higher, without great
activity iu uny"branch of speculative trade.
The exports of domestic products con
tinued unchecked, aud for tho last week
were 44 per cent, moro than for tho
lirst weelt in JJccemoer lost yenr,
"Tne business failures throughout tbs -country
for the past week were 830, com
pared with 830 for the previous week.
For the corresponding week of last year
tbe figures wer 870."
New York, Dec 11. Clearings for tho
past week of the principal cities of tho
United States, as reported by Bradstreet's,
wero$l,213,0T0,S72, an increase of 1.8 per
cent, compared with the corresponding
t week of last year. The clearlutcs at Kan-
f.!is City were l05Ju.l.ui3. an increase ot a,a

a decrease of 8.0 per cent., and at Topeka,

THE GRAIN BLOCKADE.
' KAKBAS ClTT, Dec. 1L The car shortag
is increasing. Owing to the blockado 6
rastern gateways, thu roads out of Kansas
City aro limiting their shipments. Tha
Rock Islaud has departed from the ralo
adopted by the western roads, and, to a
limited extent. Is allowing its cars to gc
through in order to get th grain oat th
way.
Kansas Crrr, Dec 11. There were GOT,
000 bushel of whatln tore In tbe eleva
tors of Kansas City yesterday" Prom all
indications the amount today will be con
siderably over 1,000,000 bushels. Orala
men of Knurm City ar unauimous iu tha
opinion that the inability of shippers to
Mrcuie cars for handling gram at tho west
ii ruining the market. It Is now next to
ImptrtHible to sell wheat for eastern ship
ment because of the grain blockad. Tha
outlook for a break in tbe blockade is ex
ceertlogly gloomy juitt at this time. It
really gives fair promlwj to b still mora
formidable. The situation U deoribed n
a inihl serious one. Grain men placo the
blame entirely at the doors of the various
railroads anUdo not hesitate to nsy tha&
if the. roads were properly managed bo
such diiliculty would ever occur.
