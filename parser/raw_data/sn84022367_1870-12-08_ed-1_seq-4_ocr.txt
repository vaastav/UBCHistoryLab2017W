THE RUTLAND HERALD
THURSDAY, DECEMBER , 1870.1
Tbe Meeting of Next Congress.
On the question whether the present
Congress ought to repeal the law requiring
the next Congress to assemble on the 4tb
of March, instead of the first Monday in
the following Dacember : If the Forty
first Congress shall do its duty reasonably
well, in the tirrfb left for it, there will be
no need of the Forty-second meeting be
fore December, 1871, except under extra
ordinary circumstances now neither fore
seen nor dreamed of. But if this Con
gres3 shall waste its time, failing to pass
a just apportionment law ; an act further
reducing taxation ; an act inaugurating
civil service reform ; and some other plain
lv needed measures then the sooner the
Forty-second Congress meets, and com
plies with these emphatic demands of the
country", the better.
Fkencti Emigration to America.
Mr. Gaorjjo Saner, lately United States
consul at Brussels, baa been traveling in
Alastu and Lorraine since the war began,
nd id very much impressed with the
poverty of the inhabitants and the proB
pect that they will emigrate in large
number-", if they get a chance. Tie Bug'
gets that accurate information, printed
in French and circulated among them,
concerning the condition of things in the
United Status, would lead many f them
to turn their steps this way next spring,
We would nugsreBt to the American social
science association, which is about to pub'
lish an emigrant guide-boob, that some
notice ehould be taken of Mr. Sauer's
statements on this topic. The Frenoh are
not generally an emigrating people, but
perhaps their time has come to "move on"
as the Irish and Germans have been doing
for tbe laflt thirty years.
San Domingo. A special dispatch to
the Evening Post says that the president's
Sin D itningo suherai finds fawer support
ers than at the lust session. Thera is very
little Mpproval of tbe part of the message
relating to 8m Domingo, and no prospect
that Gen. Grant's recommendation about
a joint resolution will be adopted. But
we are not no nure about that. Gen.
Grant bus plainly got his mind made up
to have San Domingo, and it will be very
bard for Congress to resist the arguments
that tho admioistrution will be able to
bring to be r to that end.
OBITUARY. Gen. Hiram Walbridi?, a
po'drioinn of some note in New York, for
merly a democrat, bat sinoe the war an
oc'-ivo republican, died at the Astor bouse
in that city, on Tuesday, after an illness
of four day, ut the age of 49. He was a
native of Itbnou, N. Y.t lived for a while
ia Ohio, but has resided for many years in
New York city, whioh he represented in
Congress from 1853 to 1853. nis title of
"general" carae from his connection with
the Ohio miiitia.
A Battle Incident. The Journal de
Tours reports the following instance of
sang froid in the midst of danger at the
battle of Orlcmo. A young Mobile had
asked his officer for a drink, and the lat
ter was about to pour it into the cup
whioh tho private held in his ban when
a hostile bullet carried the cup out of his
hand. The young soldier turned to the
officer and with a smile said : "Fortu
nately it was still empty." Then he took
the canteen and drank from it as calmly
as if nothing had happened.
Minister Motley. Mr. Motley, our
minister to England, dismissed so cavalier
ly from hU post there, is by no means
disgraced fa the estimation of people at
home or abroad, no writes to a friend at
Washington that he has -accepted the
Queeu of Holland's offer of the free use
of an elegant mansion at tbe Hague, to
enable him to complete his history of tbe
Netherlands, and will proceed thither im
mediately on turning over the affairs of
his embassy to the Secretary of Legation.
seven Millions More. The publio
debt statement for November shows a re
duction of tbe national debt of neatly
sevtn and a half millions of dollars.
lUark Twain Iteports tlic Farmer's
Club.
Ex-Constable Quinn desired tho club to
inform him how to make hogs root.
Dr. Slow had been a practical farmer
lor the last six weeks, and in all his vari
ed Agricultural experience, no such thing
as hog s root had tver come under his
notice. What was it ? Was it edible ?
Was it useful in any way, or was it, as
he more than expected, another worthless
humbug devised by the sharpers to defraud
us practical farmers ? He knew not
whether it was propagated bv seeds or by
cuttinps, but he would advise Mr. Quinn
to be shy of hog's root, especially if it was
a new fancied or bih priced tuber.
Mr. Moker the agricultural writer ex
plained the anatomy of the hog's proboscis
It is designed for subterranean foraging,
by a process vulgarly called rooting, to
which JVir. Luinn's inquiry probably re
ferred. JJeing a delicate organ it is liable
to injury. He would recommend that
Mr. Quino. wipe his p.g's nose. If he finds
it red, he may be sure it is tender and
needs protection by a metallic shield
Some resort to the strategic device of in
serting a wire ring in the hog's nose, in
his efforts to remove which he would
naturally thrust his snout into the soil
ana inus root unwittingly. Tnat was
playing it rather low on tbe hog, and the
metallic shield was preferable on the score
of fair dealing and philanthropy.
Mr. (Jreeley exhibited a pumpkin of
his own raising. As it embodied his
solitary and crowning success, " after
several Years of discouraging failure in
pumpkin culture, the club surrounded it
with uncovered beads, and mingled emo
tions ol surprise, admiration and envy,
It was a superb fruit, and when Mr. G.'s
hat was placed on it, to illustrate the size
and symmetry, the hat and pumpkin
seerr.ea so penecuy adapted to each other.
and together produced an effect so start
ling that several enthusiastic members
swore they would have known who raised
that pumpkin if they had seen it anywhere,
It is to be photographed by Gurney, and
next year a Irwum subscribers will re
ceive copies. The pumpkin was the flat
tering product of one bushel of seed plant
ed on ihe farm in Champagna, Soon
after blossoming, the vine manifested an
inclination to wither. It was thereupon
transplanted to a large flower-pot and
i . i . i f . -
removea to me town resiaence oi us loun
der. For some time it pined and drooped
ard they sat up nights with it, expeoting
mat every moment would be its last, but
every moment turned not out to be its last,
and with careful nursing it finally rallied
and cme up to maturity, as cherished
ana icucn a rumrkm as ever rew.
, Dr. bixhammer8 suggested that the
result of Mr. G's indomitable struggle
with this pumpkin, showed how every
city family could provide itself with
pumpkin pie. He hoped to see the day
when every . window-sill, in every city,
would be adorned with fructifying pump
kin pots, and every workman's cottage
embowered in pumpkin vines.
Thomas Dodd, of New Hampshire,
writes to the club that he i3 fifty years
old infirm with consumption, has a "large
family, ten dollars in money, and wants
to know what to do.
Mr. Moker Go out to Greeley Colony
and invest in our irrigating ditch.
Mr. Layman Buy a Texas ranch ora
Florida orange grove.
Dr. Simble His health requires light
farming in a bracing climate. Let him
start an indigo plantation in Alaska.
Mr. Greeley He mustn't come to New
York. His S10 wouldn't last a vear ;
but out West he can invest it and grow
up wun me country, it l had gone West
with $10 at his age, I should be a happy
man now, with two suits of respectable
garments, an office, and a conscience guilt
less of distracting tariff and farming es
says.
Mr. Herrings invited the club to visit
his farm, thirty miles up the river, next
Wednesday, and inspect a horse-radish
that he had persuaded to vegetate. The
ground was tilled, sub-soiled and top-
dressed. He had expended upon that
plant only half a ton of bone-dust, one
cart load of ashes and a barrel of guano ;
yet in spite of his neglect, it had within a
year grown to the me of his little linger.
His foreman would explain to the clerk
the peculiar difficulty of raising this rare
exotic. lie would treat the club to a reg
ular farmer's dinner, the materials for
which he had already engaged at the city
markets.
The club accepted and adjourned.
California Wines. The Anaheim
(Los Angeloc) Cal , Gazette says : It is es
timated that between 700,000 and oUU.UUO
gallons of red and white wines have been
made at Anaheim this season, and of a
better quality than that of any season
heretofore. This amount is 25,000 gallons
in excess of any previous year. Owincr to
the fine weather and extra condition of
the grapes, the wine is now so thoroughly
fermented, that it will be in a marketable
condition in sixty days. The grapes are
all gathered, and the wine-making is
finished for the season. Preparations are
reinir made for the immediate setting out
of 800 to 400 additional Bcres of vines.
So, ia a couple of years time, we may
reasonably expect Anaheim to produce
from one million to one million and a
half of gallons of wine per season. .We
have been shown Bamples of the white
Malaga grape raisins, of unusual siza and
flavor. Between 300 and 400 boxes of
these made this year as an experiment.
are certainly superior to any in tbe mar
ket.
A Jolly Old Fashioned Thanks
giving. Oa Thanksgiving Day, Mr.
Henry Slickney, a sturdy Yankee farmer
hII of tbe olden time, and his wife, Mrs.
Valeria Stickoey, held high festival at
their large and comfortable farmhouse at
East riaiufirld, N. H. In addition to the
host and his wife, there were present
eleven of his children, (some of them
from Metbuen,) thirteen grandchildren,
and one great grandchild, the oldest ot
the party numbering sixty-eight years,
and the youngest four months. Thirty
three persons sat down. Among tbe ar
ticles furnished for the dinner were three
turkeys, twelve chickens, half a hog, and
ninety-two pies. In the evening some
forty of the neighbors came in, and there
was cider in abundance, apples, nut, the
regular baked codfish, singing, end plays
for the young people. 1 he company, on
eaviug, did not forget to leave something
for the old farmer to remember them by.
Mr. St:ckney, in the days before railroads
were introduced, drove a Btnge from
Montpelier, Vt., to Boston.
Shipment of Arms. The recent ship
ments of arms from tbis country have
been of a magnitude to astonish the un-
nitiated. Two weeks ago four steamers
went offloaded with three hundred thou
sand arms. The French have now re
ceived from this side of the Atlantic from
six to seven hundred thousand nuns, and
from England perhaps two hundred thou
sand more. Belgium has stoppea trie im
portation of arms on account ot the
hazard ot olienaing so poweriui a ne'gu
bor as Pruessia. American torpedoes have
also found favor with the belligerents,
and we presume have been used in con
siderable numbers. The tremendous cap
tures of material by the Germans left the
world to suppose that 1 ranee would have
to make peace from the simple lack of
weapons; but three or four hundred thou
sand guns have been found there, and
nearly a million more nve rjern pur
chased. Army and Navy Journal.
Washington Letter.
Senate Chamber, Dec. 5, 1870.
Editor Rutland Herald : Again the
great heart of the nation begins to throb.
The doors of tbe galleries and of the floor
are thrown open, displaying the newly
polished furniture and carpets. The eager
publio throng in. Strangers venture cau
tiously upon tho floor of the Chamber
and gatler in groups eagerly fc-iniiirg
everything, and some audarions ones will
eisily slip into the seif, and mnyhiip pen
a word or two on a paper or card to 6ome
dear friend, upon the desk of a real live
Senator. Occasionally tho phiz of some
well-known Senator can bo descried in
this conglomeration of humanity ; and as
time wears on they appear mora plenty,
until five minutes before twelve tho door
keepers commence to drive out those not
having on the wedding garment. The
galleries are densely packed. Soon the
genial Uoltax maKes his appeirance, a
rap, a silence as of death, all breaths are
hushed, and Dr. Newman steps to the
President's desk and in a few well-timed
words thanks the Father of mercies for
the blessings of the past and invokes his
aid for the future. With the "Amen"
comes a response from the galleries as well
as the floor, caused by tbe rustle and stir
which always follows a protracted wait
ing in silence by large congregations, and
the work of the third session of the Forty-
First Congress has began. Truly
solemn yet oeautnui ceremony I as
Senator after Senator rises iu his seat to
introduce bills or make motious, or expla
nations. One of the first matters of busi
ness was a bill or resolution of the Ver
mont Legislature concerning certain State
claims. Its precise import was lost to the
writer of this in the gallery above. After
a few moments thus spent a recess was
taken until 1:15 p. m.
SCENE AT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTA
TIVES, To which I withdrew as the reoess was
taken, was the same old story over again.
Galleries choked with gazers, doorways
filled and crowds standing - iu line to
move up as fast as one inside got squeezed
out. One everlastingly thin-edged Bo
hemian somehow managed to get through
this solid column of living breastwork in
to the ladies' gallery and saw, what P
about two-thirds of the members assem
bled upon the floor below, but could hear
nothing, or rather, did hear so much else
as to hear nothing of the business trans
acted. ; . :. :

THE RUTLAND
caused a throb of sympathy in the heart
of a Greeu Mono tain boy who had once
been nearly wrecked by the chill of his
favorite mountains. Mr. Smith with his
wonted dignity of bearing busily investi
gating a pile of letters and documents up
on his desk before him, while the courtly
costume, tho venerable flowing hair and

of all upon him, es the oracle of the

an aisle.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The President's Message was submitted
and read upon the reassembling of the
Senate. It is a long and ably written
document. In which he .touched upon
the prevention of 'the exercise of the
franchise law iu some of the Southern
States, our foreign relations at length
He expressed his favorable course toward
the young republio of France and desire
for early peace. Repeats his former views
upon the San Domingo question, in an
elaborate argument for their support, and
cites from the Munroe doctrine extensive
ly. He also deals at length upon the queS'
tion of the Northwestern boundary.
Upon the Alabama claims less is said
than was expected from previons predic
tions which had gone out, but upon the
Canadian fisheries he speaks at length
his views and treatment of the case savor
ing strongly of the ground taken by Gen.
Butler in his speech before the Boston
Lyceum. Reoommends legislation favor
able to our depleted commerce. Appro
priation for a new building for the De
partment of State as also of war. Re
commends a slight reform in revenue
matter, and that our army and navy be
placed in a more effective condition, es;
pecially demonstrating that our navy is
really insufficient for the duties required
from our extended coast of over five thou
sand miles. He endorses the recommend
ation of the Postmaster-General for the
abolition of the franking privelege, and
the instituting of corresponding cards.
Especially recommending the correction
of an abuse of long standing in the pres
ent system ot civil service. Gives flatter
ing reports of the working of the new
Indian policy, and expresses great hope
of its being the means of civilization, long
sought, but jast found. Opposes the
giving of land grants for Railroad and
other purposes, except educaHo"'
Speaks in the most flattering terms of the
Drtpartroout of Agriculture and the
Bureau of Education, recommending it to
liberal support. "k.
The Situation in France. The war
news, recently, is very meager, owing
largely to the use of the only remaining
cable," for tbe transmission of messages to
Europe, but, such as it is, must be re
garded as unfavorable to tho French.
From Paris we have, to be sure, advices
up to Sunday, giving most glowing ac
counts of the suocess of Ducrot's sorties,
but the fact that tbe German losses in
Friday's fight are statel at from 15,000 to
20,000, shows that the whole account
must be regarded as greatly exaggerated.
From tbe army of the Loire we have
somewhat more definite news. King
William's dispatch announcing the vic
tory before Orleans and the special re
ports from Tours, concur in representing
the German success us a substantial one,
and the evacuation of Orleans cannot fail
to have a dispiriting effect upou tbe
French, especially after the previous suc
cesses of Gen. Paladines. In fact, if we
may believe the Tribune correspondent at
Tours, the French have already forgotten
all bis previous services, and, in their in
dignation at losing Orleans for the second
time,' are now talking of trying by court
martial almost tbe only commander who
has shown any real capacity during the
war.
Addison County Railroad. At a
meeting of tbe Addison County Ralroad

cbard of Boston was elected a Director to

work on the Addison Railroad is progress-
in"1, and it is expected the road will bo in
operation on or before the first day of Oc
tober next.

I'Airn well ForNuau.
In oi.l time3, at the corameniH'me'.t oi every
season, it was the fashion to take a sttong c- ithar
tic as a safeguard against a change of tempera
ture. It was a worse than senseUs practice.
The people of Our day understand the matter
bettt-r. Instead of depleting the Hjstem tht-y re
iaruroe it. In the method th( y adopt thiy ex
hibit a wise discrimination. Ir.s'.eai of rrenr-injf
to the filiated stimulants of commerce, or any of
the compounds derived from them, they put their
faith ia the enly absolutely pure irmgorart pro
curable in the market Hostetter's Stomach Bit
ters. Their faith ia well founied. Nerer has
any tor.ie medicine been prepared with such scru
pulous precision and conscientious care. It is a
vegetable compound of which evary ingredient is
sounl, wholesome and medicinal in the true
sense of the word. Now, we have three promir ent
national complaints. One-half of th-? adult poj
ulationof the United States suffer more or less
either from diseases of the stomach, derange
ments of the liver, or affections of the kidneys.
In no other land under Heaven are these mala
dies so general as in this country, and Hostetter's
Bitters is a specific for them all, unless organic
in their origin, and therefore beTOnd c?re. And
let thosS who are fortunate enongh to be exempt
from ttem at present understand one fact, viz.:
that an occasional use of this vitalizing tonic will
as certainly prevent them as the sun will prevent
the earth from freezing where its genial beams
descend.
Good News fbomIhelahd. During the Irish
famine we sent a million ot dollars worth of food
to Curk, Ireland, is now repaying the debt with
interest; not from her exchequer, not from har
vest fields, but from the adamantine locks on her
coast. An enterprising company in New York
is importing ship-loads of the edible moss that
growa on ber cliffa, and converting It, under tbe
nme of Sea Moss Farine into an economic
source of nourishment and palatable food. The
new source of aliment is prepared under a patent,
and although bit a year in the market, has al
ready taken precedence of all the gelatinous
agents heretofore used in cookery. No epicure
who has tasted the pudding', custards and jel
lies made from Sea Moss Farine, wilt deny that
they are incomparable. The saving effected by
oaing this article instead of maizena, farina or
corn starch (all of which it excels in palatabilty,!
is about fifty per cent.

Tbe Oliver marble and. Granite
Works of Rutland, Vt. .
One of the lareest and best conducted monu
mental establishments in lee country, eo wide
ly and favorably known tor tneir exceLent
work owe th ir success to the three following
distisgulBhing characteristics: superiority of
mateilal, aitietic execution, and low prices
f be first is chiefly due to their immediate prox
imity to tbe celebrated Kutland Marble Quar
ries, and their location ou tho direct ra-lroad
route westward from mofct of the valuable
Granite Quarries of New Eneland, as this Im
portant advantage of location over ail ether
similar establishments is not lost sight of by
the proprieior ot tbe Works; and bis patrons
have the lull benefit thereof in a personal seiec
Hon of material from the entire product of the
quarries. By lhese selections, customers are
always gettlngVthe cream" of theeutlre twelve
uepoaito, whose aggregate stock on hand, from
wbicn choice is made, amounts to at least a
million of dollars.
As under this plan of personally selecting all
the material used, there is and can be no accu
mulation of inferior stock, to be afterwards die
posed of, parties may always feel assured ol
getting only the Very best of stock In their
work. Furthermore, soundness of material is
equally well insured, whicn is a very important
consideration, involving, as it dees, to grat
extent, tne question of durability, which is an
essential reqataite to good work.
Tne second distinguishing ieature of these
works, and which perhaps has most contributed
to thtir reputation for superior work, has been
justly earned by the employmtBt of the most
skilled artizsns that cau be obtained, and by
confining the labor of each workman to sucn
specialty of work as he excelled in.
It must be apparent to every practical mind
that, let carvers be constantly at carving, let
tertrs at lettering, moulding cutters mourning,
hewers hewing, polisht rs polishing, and so on
through every classification of the labor of a
large aud well-ordered manulactory, tne work
men must of necessity be ever acquiring great
er pr cision and dispatch in their respective
departments,
it hem 2 tne determination to sell at the low
est prices that can be afforded with a reasona
ble rjrofit. this systematic adaptation of labor,
added to their unequalled laciilties la the selec
tion of material, makes inevitable their
Third feature, and enables them to furslsh
tbe very best work at the lowest possible
prices.
in order to fully meet the demand of the
times, aud that the work may add variety and
new attractions to the several localities In
which it is erected, the services of the best tal
ent that can be obtained, is employed In con
stantly oiltiiuatiLg fresh and novel designs tor
military and civic monuments, tombs, nearth
stones, tablets, etc., to which is invited the
critical inspection of parties desiring cemetery
imoroveoienw.
The constantly increasing business of the
wotks, of course, is not confined to any partic 1
uiar locality or btaie, ana tne several local
dealers witn whom it comes in competition
have no cause ot jealousy at the seeiuLng In
roads noun their buriness. For it la a notice
able fact that wherever the work goe it elicits
such an increased interest iu and demand for
toud work, as to fury compensate lor anv au
parent lose to other dealers iu indiviuaal cases,
oy the general stioiUias given to the trace:
aud it is not possible lht tula eetablisbment
will execute more than a minor poitiou of the
worn required ttuougoout the large and widen
ing field tt is being distributed, lis products
ivihb atarui in over & nun died Ciller
ent Cemeteries.
"J o ibis brief announcement of the facilities
and ab.ilty of the work, there need only be
added goou and r.mplo evidence oi integrity in
its operations, not only in its tnonied trac esc
tions, but lu details oi rnanufactuie with which
the customer Is ueuaiiy uulamiiiar, and in
which he must to a great extent Oeptnd upon
iue luiiuiuiut eu 01 ne uuuuer.
Touching lb. ib point, perhaps the most satis
factory acsurance tbtreot that can be offered
is the usauiony ol those whose orders have
been already tXecuted by these vvoras. the
deeds of the past belug the best guaranty for
tne luture. neuce, that parties who fivor the
tgiabiiBhment with their orders may leel as
