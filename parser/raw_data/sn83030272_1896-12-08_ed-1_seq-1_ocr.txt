H fl.sator Called for lV A. M. To-Day.
H Wasuinoton, Dec. 7. Without unusual In-
H eldent of importance the second and final ses-
H tlon ot tho Fifty-fourth Congress began to-day,
H It will enJ by limitation of law at noon on
H March 4 next, and already there are indications
H en every band In Washington that It It to tho
H new Congressthat tile country mutt look for
H the much-needed tariff aud flnanolal legislation.
H Owing to clrcumttances apparently beyond the
' control of tho Itepubllcan leaders the present
Congress cannot enact It.
There seems to be no longer any doubt that
the chief mission of Chairman llanna of the
National Commltteo in Washington If to make
known to tho Republicans the desire of Presi
dentelect McKlnley to call an extra session of
Congress as soon as practicable after his In
auguration, and his belief that tho Interests of
the peoplo would bo best subserved by making
Bo attempt to pass tho Dlngley bill or onaot
other tariff legislation during the remaining
three months of the present Congress. Since
bis arrival in Washington on Saturday morning
Chairman Uanna has talked to a large majority
of tho Republicans, and all of them hare re-
fcelved ihflsameltnpresslon that President-elect
McKlnley thinks tho Fifty-fifth Congress, and
not tho Fl(t) -fourth, could best carry out thoso
measures which it is hoped will form the programme-
of the united sound-money party In
Congress.
Mr. Hannn was In attendance at the brief
esslon of the Senate to-day, sitting In the pri
vate gallery with the family of Senator Drlce.
During the recess, taken while waiting for the
President's message, he was at lunch In the
Senate restaurant with a large party.
Deeming It bost to feel their way carefully be
fore deciding upon a legislative programme, tho
Itepubllcan Senators have called a party caucus
to meet at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning. The
silver Republicans hare been Invited to attend,
and it is thought that some of them wilt accept
tho invitation. Senator Dubois of Idaho, who Is
Secretary of the caucus, is obdurate, however.
i, lie says he will'stand oat against the Republl-
! can party and hold himself ready to act with
any party that is friendly to silver. Senators
Carter and Mantle will probably attend the
caucus, but Petltgrew and Cannon may join
Dubois. Sena pr Teller, the leader of the sliver
Republicans, has not yet arrived in Washing
ton. v The Senate chamber looked bright and at
tractive this morning, with its new furniture.
Its new electrlo lights, and the effect of its gen
eral overhauling during the recess, and the
thousands of spectators in the galleries fonnd
the new leather-covered chairs much more
comfortable than the wooden benohes that havo
been discarded after so many years of use.
Space has been sacrificed to comfort in this
change, however, and the galleries will not ac
commodate as many visitors as heretofore, bnt
as there are always on important occasions more
applicants than seats, the public Inconvenience
nlll not be malvially greater. Floral offerings
were not as numerous to-day In th Senate as In
the House, which Is accounted for by the fact
that Representatives are elected every two
years, and therefore every member who will be
lnther-Heit'Ilooi'e U to-day a subject to con
gratulation by those who have favors to ask.
Vice-President Stevenson caused one little
ripple of surprise when he announced the ap
pointment ot Senator Smith of New Jersey as
th Democrallo member of the committee to
Jalt upon the President with the customary
J nnnunccmenttbat the Senate was In session
i and ready to receive such commnnlcatton as ho
mlitht desire to make. It has long been the
custom of both Homes to select for this honor
the members longest In service, and under this
rule Senator Harris, or Cockrll. or Morgan,
or those who, like them, have sen ed In the Sen
ate many years, would naturally be named, as
they hate been before. Mr. Smith Is one of the
junior Senators. He was suggested to the Vice
President by Mr. Gorman, tho tactical leader of
the Senate Democrats, who has not furnished a
satisfactory explanation of why the senior Sena-
tors were passed over. It was suggested that
they refused to accept the assignment, all
of them being unfriendly to the President,
and Mr. Smith, being older In service than any
of that small group of Senators on the Demo
ggsrallc side who have been recognized as spokes
men of the Clevoland Administration, was
tbongbt to be acceptable because he Is a sound
money Democrat, nnd because be Is Senator
from tha State of which President Cleveland
has now decided to become a citizen. Mr. Slier
- man. the Republican member of the commit
tee, was selected because of his seniority of ser
vice. Imtever may have been the real motive
behind Senator Smith's selection his member
ship of tho committee was the causo of much
gossip.
Senators as a rule were not at all respectful to
President Clet eland during the reading of his
message, possibly because of the fact that tbere
Is no man on the clerical force of the Senate
who can read effectlv ely. Muny of the Senators
slipped out of the chamber and went to their
committee rooms or to tholr homes. More out
of nfllclal respect to Congress and the President
than from an eagerness to learn the recommen
dations of the hxecutlvr, a large proportion of
the diplomatic corps were present In the gallery
Interred for them, blr Julian Pauncefote. the
llrltlsh Ambassador, remained for a few mo
ments, and then bustled over to the House and
showed himself there, and by an Interesting
concldencc the new Turkish Minister. Mas
tapba lley, and his suite ent-red thegnlleryat
the moment th Secretary began reading the
paragraph referring to Turkish atrocities In
.Armenia. The party left when the reading of
this portion of the message was concluded.
Senators Teller. Allison, and Illackburn were
the conspicuous absentees from to-day's ses
sion. No business was done lu the Senate, ex
cept the reading of tho President's message.

Speaker was one of tho few prominent
men lu the House whoso dosk vvas not

Chairman Apsley nf the Congress Committee
were almost hidden behind big floral chairs,

Sneaker Rscd did not Join them, having re
mained in his private room, where he
was called upon by his Republican asso
ciates, warmly greeted, nnd congratulated upon
the happy result of the election. Chairman
Dlngley made his appearance on the floor soma
time before the noon hour, and, without waiting
for the members to call on him, went about
among his colleagues on both sides of the
House, warmly gnotlng them and receiving
words of welcome and good will from Demo
crats and Republicans alike. Mr. Dlnaley Is a
very popular man with all parties. His Integ
rity and sincerity c' purpose are universally
recognized. As he will be either Chairman nf
the Committee on Ways and Means In the next
House or Secretary of the Treasury nnder the
new Administration, he Is. next to Mr. Reed,
the most conspicuous Republican In Congress.
There were two gontlemcn from New ork on
the floor to-day who were as prominent In tho
Jollification before the House met ns either
Speaker Reed or Chairman Dlngley. These
were Governor-elcot Frank 8. Ulack and Gen.
Daniel E. Sickles. They were constantly the
centre of nn admiring group, who congratulated
them upon the result of the election and the
prominent part which they took In It. Mr, S.
V. White, who always attends the opening nf
Congress, and ex-Congressman Benjamin T. Ca
ble of Illinois were also noticeable among the
visitors.
The appointment of Judge Turner nf Georgia
to be a member of the committee, with Repre
sentatives Cannon and Payne, to wait upon the
President Indicates that he will be appointed to
the vacant place on the Committee on Rules
caused by the death of Judge Crisp, and that he
will therefore become the loader of the Demo
crats upon the floor during the present session.
Judge Turner I nnoof the ablest Democrats
who has been In Congress from the South for
many ears, but will not be a member of the
next Congress, so that the question of the Dem
ocratic leadership on the floor will be left to be
settled when the new Congrea meets. Judge
Turner has been nn enthtelaetlo Cleveland
Democrat, and for that reason failed to get a re
nomination, which would hare been oqulv alent
to defeat In his district.
COU3U:TS o.v tub message.
Opinion from Over the Hen an the rresl.
dent' ltensrks on Cuba.
LotDOT, Dec. 8.- Commenting upon Presi
dent Cleveland's message to Congress, the
Standard sas It is dlgulflcd and able and is
marked throughout with sterling common
senso. It doscrves and will doubtless obtain the
serious study of the Kuropenn peoples. The
Standard Is of tho opinion that tho message will
excite bitterness in Spain, which country, never
theless, must make up her mind to listen to
friendly counsel. Spaniards may be excused If
they detect a tone of menace Tho condition of
Cuba will certainly not induce impartial ob
servers to say that menace Is unwarranted.
The paper dwells on Mr. Cleveland's pointed
reassertion of tho Monroe doctrine In tho para
graph reading:
"Whatever circumstances may arise, our
policy and uur Interests would constrain us to
object to the acquisition of the Hand or any In
terference with Its control by any other power."
It sees In this tho Intention of the United
States to claim a virtual proteclorato over the
American continent and the Islands thereof.
This, It adds. Is a largo and bold policy that Is
not quite free from danger, as Spain Is not the
onlypower with which the United States might
thereby become embrollud.
The paper expresses the opinion that If Spain
found a powerful friend In Europe to help pre
vent Cuba from passing from her hands, the ob
jections of the United States based on the Mon
roe doctrine would not be of much account.
Fortunately there seems to be no real risk that
the Monroe doctrine will occasion further dis
putes with Great Britain.
In conclusion the StamLird refers to the pass
ages referring to the satisfactory ending of the
Venezuela dispute, and sa s that tho dignified
language of the message where It refers to
Turkey shows the powers that they can be as
sured of thecordlal supporter the UnUedStat
lu executing corrective measures in tKat country.
The Dolly Xtut Is chiefly imoressed by the
section of the message referring to Cuba. It
admits that Americans cannot be permanently
indifferent to the disastrous condition nf th
Island, but says that while th Intentions of
President Cleveland and Secretary Olney may
bo every way good, European opinion is not
favorable to tho latest version of tho Monroe
doctrine, and Spain nlll have influential sup
port if she holds out against It. The Conti
nental press has become very sensitive on the
subject of American pretensions, and the mes
sage is likely to meet with sharp comment.
Lord Salisbury Is thought to have yielded ton
much In the enezuelan matter, and there will
be many voices urging Spain not to yield. It Is
lobe hoped that they will not prevail. Auton
omi would be the Dest thing for tho Cubans, as
It would also be for Spain.
'I he ( hriintclc sajs that the alternative before
Spain is really to either satisfy the Cubans or
have Cuba taken from her forcibly. 1 he re
sponsibility will remain wltn the United States,
and considering the state of Cuba and w hat the
Cubans are. a full-sized Nemesis will certainly
await any want of success In American meth
ods. "lhe Spanish falluro is colossal and un
deniable. The United btaton Is read) to take
upon itself the huge burden of restoring order
and prosperity In the Island. We advise Spain
In her own interest to sell Cuba quiusly, but be
would be no friend of the United States who
would advise the latter to buy the island."
'1 ho Aid) 'ltlctiraph tays that the message
deali with the Cuban question with great
moderation and In a most conciliatory spirit.
The terms In which the nilvlce to Spain Is
couched cannot offend tho susceptibilities
of the most sensitive peoplo In the world,
though, perhaps. It Is a pity that the advice Is
accompanied br a menaco. Ihe paper advises
Spain to hasten a settlement of the Insurrection.
'Ihe Times says that the tone and spirit of tho
message are worth) of all praise. President
Cleveland, it adds, gives his countrymen the
soundest advice lu the most unexceptionable
language, nor can the least complaint be
made of tho character of tbo warn
lags he addresses to Spain, though It Is
not Improbable that Spanish pride will
take offence. It Is clear that President Cleve
land Is actuated by friendly feelings toward
Spnln. It would be wise for the latter to con
sider whether It could not avail Itself of the
President's offer of aid In settling the Cuban
trouble.
The 'ltme and other morning papers compare
the present message with that of last ) ear and
express regret that the latter was not as calm
as this one, but generally the) rejoice at the
settlement of tho Venezuelan difficulty and the
prospect of permanent arbitration between
Great Britain and the United States.

BeCorTomai Estrada Palma, the delegate of
the Cuban republic In the United States, will
to-day make a statement to the press about tho
chapter on Cuba In the message of President
Cleveland.
"Insogravoamatler," said Seflor Palma to
the reporters yesterday, "I have to study cat o
fully what I have to say as tho only official rep
resentative of the Cubans bore."
From what Seflor Palma said to several proml
nont Cubans In his office it is known that his
statement will be based principally on the Con
stitution of the Cuban Provisional Government
proclaimed at Imngua) u nn Sept. 1(1, 1805, and
tho Instructions he boa received from his Gov
ernment which inspired his address to tho peo
nlo of the United Stales, Issued four months
ago, when the press first gave news of tho fact
now roioaled by President Cleveland, that is to
say, that the Administration had made friend
ly representations to Spain, proposing that tho
Spanish Government grant homo rule to Cuba.
Seflor Palma said in that address:
The question of the proposed reforms is not a mat
ter which at all concerns those who hare already es
tablished au Independent government In Cubs, and
have resolved to shrink from no sacrince of property
or life In order to emancipate the whole Island from
the Spanish yoke. It the Spanish residents of tho
Island, who are favored b) the Spanish Oovernment
with all soru of privileges and monopolies, and it
the hundful of Cubans, loo pusillanimous or too
proud to acanowledire their error or a few foreigners
guided only by seinsh lutertsts ure satlsilta that
Cuba should remain under Hpanlsh domination,
we. who militate under the da or the soli

fmblle of Cuba and belong to a free people with

pendence of Cuba If bpaln has power to extern)!

tlon.
Besides the above declarations, ihe Constitu
tion of the Republic of Cuba, above referred to.
sajs In artlclo II,:
The treaty or peace with Spain, which mutt neres
larltvhaie or Its oeuis Hie ubaofuM indtprndenrtof
the liland nf Ce6u. must be ratified by the Govern
ment Council and by an assembly of representatives
convened expressly for this purpose.
Seflor Palma has received several declara
tions of the Cuban Government and the Cuban
Generals Gomez and Mnco on this head. In
any kind of arrangement with Spain, only the
absolute Independence nf the Island will be con
sidered by the Cubans In arms.
When the first news of President Cleveland's
ultimatum to Spain rams out some months ago.
It produced in tne ranks of the patriots in Cuba
"awrrrnaagrevable Impression, and to prevent
any Cuban from assuming the responsibility of
carrying to his fellow rountrymen In the Bold
proposals from Spain based on tne granting of
home rule or reforms and not on the Indepen
dence of Cuba, the provisional Government of
the republic contemplated issuing a law similar
In terms to the law known as the law or Spn
torno in the last rebellion of 1808. By that law
every Cuban who should propose peaceful ar
rangements with Spain not Including tho free
dom of the island was declared a traitor, and
oondemned to death,
den Ma-eo has w rltlen several times, the last
time from Plnar del Rln. that he Is resolved to
dlo before giving Ills consent to any treaty I'l
which only home rule hhoiild be granted to
Cuba. Knowing that Snail, would propose noth
Ing nioro than home rule, he adds in regard
to all kind of diplomatic uegotlatinns:
" It Is better to trust In the force of arms than
In the resources of diplomac)."
In general the Dart of Preldent Cleveland's
message which relates to his proposal to spnln
on the bans of home rule was considered in the
Junta as the expression nf a delusion If the Ad
ministration expects that the Cubans would
give up the struggle for the concession of such
a reform onl). Kven with the guaranteoof tho
United btates of the fulfilment by Spain of Its
obligations It Is emphatically affirmed that
another treaty such as that of Zanjon In 1878
Is now Impossible.

Opinion of Cenereaamea nn III Treatment
of tho Cuban cjttcntlon.
WASHINOTeiv, Doc. 7. Members of Congress
who would talk on the subject made their com
ments on thai part of the President's message
that referred to tho war In Cuba.
Gen. Orosvenor (Hep). Ohio, said- "Tho
treatment of the Cuban and other foreign mat
ters will not be satisfactory to thoso w ho havo
so earnestly hoped for the early action of our
country In the interests of an early cessation
of wholesale murder In tho unhappy Island of
Cuba. Tho discussion of tho Cuban question Is
rather an apolog) for delay and non. action than
the taking of a strong and decisive position
upon the situation."
Gen. "Joe" Wheeler (Dem , Ala.) said: "It
la conceded In the message that the power exer
cised by Spain Is limited to maintaining an Im
perfect Government In the large towns and
suburbs, and that the rest of the Island Is con
trolled by the CuDnns who up to this time have
so skilfully conducted their warfare that tho
Spanish army has not been able to subdue or
defeat them, nnd It also admits that tho Cubans
have gained In numbers and resources. Tho
condition of our struggling patrlots.of tho Revo
lution could hardly bo said to bo better than
that discussed In the message. It admits thnt
the Spaniards havn been unable to advaniu
from the count, while during our struggle from
1T7& to 17B1 the British army trail rntd the
colonies several tlmus from one cud to the
other."
Mr.McCrearr (Dem .Ky.lsnld: "I am pleated
with tho President's reference to the Cuban and
Venezuelan questions. While I sympathize
with tho Cuban patriots and hope samu da to
see Cuba a freu and independent republic, I did
not expect the President, so hear the closo of
his term, to recommend any legislation which
might seriously Interrupt the frlendl) relations
existing between us and Spain, or which might
lead to war,"
Mr, Taft (Rep, O) -Ihe President has staled
the position of the United States forulbl). He
shows that wo have rtepnnded to all the duties
demanded by International law. Whsihesays
may be considered as a notice to Spain thnt the
present condition cannot continue Indefinitely,
The President leaves It an open question
whether or not he will interfere. It looks as If
he Intende d to turn the Cubau question ov er to
MoKlnlc) for settlement.
Mr. Loud (Rep, Cal I -Tho position of the
President on Cuban affairs sho vhl reecho the
commendation of all Americans. It Is dignified,
yel it It sufficiently aggresslvo to intiiiiuto to
Spain that this lountrv la anxiously watching

Mr. Payne (lieu. N. Y.)-Wbether the tlmo
has come for action by the United States In
Cuba Is a difficult question. I havo no doubt
that the present contest will result In a better
ment of conditions in Cuba.
Mr. Morse of Massachusetts What tho
President says about the strugglo In Cuba nnd
his Intimations to Spain are patriotic, hnmanc.
and perhaps as far as the country Is Justified In
going in the present situation or affairs.
Mr. Dalzell (Rep.. Pa.)-I like bost that
reference to Cuba where he shuws a determina
tion not to permit any other power to Intorfero
In tho Island's affairs.
Speaker Reed said! "It teems hardly noces
sary to comment upon the message. It Is calm

considerable interest in President Cleveland's

tho opening sontenccs of the message-thoso In
which President Cleveland referred to tho re

conceal his pleasure at the sentiments of those
paragraphs, but as ho proceeded and came to
tho meal of the discussion of Cuban affaln bis
face assumed tho appearanco of deep concern
and Interest, and tho document was read much
more carefully than Major McKlnley ordinarily
reads an) thing. He seemed to bu stud) Ing
every word, but his face betrayed not the slight
est hint of bis lews on the subject. Nor did he
say a word that could throw light on his lews.
The perusal nf the paragraphs an tho tariff
was accompanied by a peculiar facial ex
pression, and part of the paragraphs he read
aloud In a tone that cleatl' indicated disbelief
in the arguments used. The( recommendation
concerning greenbacks and Treasury Depart

In much the same manner as had been the
Cubnn section. Thoetausn about trusts brought
no comment from the President-elect, but he
looked acquiescence when somo one observed
the President was giving attention to trusts
rather late In his Admin stratlnn.

The Jleport I Thnt Secretary Olner and
sllnlalera Hatch and Cooper Are XII
consist: It Term nnd Thnt President
Cleveland nimaeir Favor Annexation.
IIo.ioi.ulv, Nov. 34. via San Francisco, Deo.
7. From a high official of the Government It
was learned to-day that a treaty for tho annex
ation of the Hawaiian Islands Is now In courso
of preparation nt Washington, and that It will
bo one of the first forolgn matters brought to
the attention of this session of Congress. The
treaty originated in tho Stato Department, and
has coma to tho notice of this Government
through several letters on the subject from Mr.
Hatch. When asked If President Cleveland
was cognizant of and approved of the courso
mentioned, the official replied that he had every
reason to bcllovosn. Ho ventured to say further
that Mr. Cleveland wus not only In favor of
such a treaty, but tho terms ut it wcro being
dictated by him. Ho added: "We havo every
reason to expeot wlthiu a short lime a direct
proposal from the Government of the United
States for annexation. Whether or not tho
terms offered will suit us Is another matter.
Minister Cooper has gone to Washington and Is
advised fully as to what this country is pre
pared to do and is n tiling to accept- 1 ho treaty
we expect to havo submitted to us will be the
result of negotiations between Secretary Olney
on the one hand and Ministers Hatch and
Cooper on the other."
Loi ally there Is compltto harmony In tho an
nexation rauks. Tho electorate of the country
is, to a man, pledged to It, The Kxecutlvo
Council, composed of the President and four
Ministers, aro pledged and bound under the
Constitution to negotiate and conclude an an
nexation troaty with the United States. All
who havo been In the movement and a large
number who have hold aloof from it havo the
fullest confidence that the Executlvo will carry
out this pledge at the first opportunity. The
Senate, which Is the ratifying body In all treaty
matters. Is solid for annexation and will ratify
such a treaty immediately when tho document
is presented to it. Finally, tho combined sup
porters of this Government, of nil nationalities,
stand ready to back the Executive and Senate
In carrying out this provision of the Constitu
tion and to seo that such a consummation is not
retarded or Interfered with.
Never have the annexation forces of this
country been so united, and nover has the Gov
ernment of tho United Stal-s had a belter op
portunity of annexing the country with such
general consent In the Ulands.
The Portuguese military company of the Na
tional Guard Is giving trouble, and there Is
every Indication that It will be disbanded.
Since the antl-Atiatio demonstration by the
Portuguoe colony last summ-r, when 1,000
men marched to tho executive building to pro
test ugalnsl further Importation of Japanese
nnd Chinese coolie labor for tho cane fields,
dissension has been general in the ooluny. 1 no
law) era of their own blood figure most promi
nently In the agitations By their effort a pow
erful union of the colony has been accom
plished, the object of which Is political. Ihe
leaders have already b) show of forco en
deavored to Intimidate the Government Into
carrying out somo of their schemes.
This union ha been encouraged by Royalist
leaders, who func) that In tho Portuguese will
lie a strong balance of power between the Oov
eruuieut supporters and the old Monarchical
party. For tome lime the Portuguese military
company has been In the way of the loaders of
Ihe union, nnd their special endeavor of late has
been to create dissension among the soldier ele
ment and thus break up the company. Several
pretexts were emplojed. all of which tended to
this end. As a result tho men are In open re
bellion against Col. McLean cotumsnder of the
region m, whom they charge with personal
prejudice and discrimination a;alnsl them. At
a meeting held on Monday evoulng three
fourths of the membership appeared without
uniforms and told tho Lieutenant-Colonel that
the) would not uniform again as long us Mc
Lean was at tho held of tho regtment. The
Military Department has taken steps to get at
the bottom of the matter.
It Is sal I that tho dilute of discrimination as
far as Col. MoLean is concerned can be easily
disproved. Ihe department, should the Porlu-
Surso persist in their dt mand for the head of
Ict.ean. will disband ihocompun) aud eelre Its
munitions. In antlclpttlon of this a new com
pnnv of Americans has been formed nnd stands
rencly in take the plat e of the Portugue-e The
illshandnieni of the campnii) would create
great excitement lu the Portuguese colony,
which is Just what the leaders of the union de
sire. Ihe) believe that with tne Portuguese
colony incited against tho Government they
could carr Ihcir own personal ends and get
good Government positions for thenieelves nnd
their confederates. Ihe Government will not
yield an Inch. 1 he Portuguese are very excita
ble, but lack erer)thlug except numbers that
would make thorn dangerous.
