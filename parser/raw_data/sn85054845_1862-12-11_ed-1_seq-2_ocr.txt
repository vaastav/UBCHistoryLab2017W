; Tlie President's Message.
Immediately after its promulgation, vre
Ut week ' had the President's Annual
ilesiage utruck off in an "extra4 which
we distributed, to a majority of our coun
ty readers. Not having enough copies to
go all aouod,: we omitted sending them
to iach as we imagined would be supplied
from other sources. If any cf our sub
scribers have failed to receive the doou
xaent, and desire a copy, upon application
st this office we will endeavor to accom
odate them.
TTM Tiiere be Peace T
"We have now had a full year and a
half of Civil War under the auspices of
Border-State policy and Pro Slavery Gen
train, and those who would have that pol
icy and those Generals now say that we
have made little or no progress toward
suppression the Rebellion. From and
after the close of this month, the Presi
dent ; proposes to try a different policy,
nuder the lead of Generals who mainly
believe in it. What are the chances of
its success ? ,
.', On this interesting topic, the New York
Tr&ime observes : We say, Let the ef
forts to be made under the new .be as
generally and fairly supported by-the loy
al States a.i those under the old policy
have been, aod three months will ee the
Rebellion utterly squelched. We do not
ask half so loug a trial as the opposite
policy has had; give us six months' fair
"trial of the Emancipation policy, and if it
does not bring the traitors to their marrow-bones,
we will own that it is a failure,
and unite in urging the Government to
make the best attainable peace. Rut we
do not believe that, more than three months
will be requisite.
The standing beast cf the Rebels is the
unanimous determination of their people
to fight to the last man against what they
term "subjugation." They are '-defending
their hemei and hearthstones." they
tell us, and can never be conquered. Bui
the Three Millions and odd of Southern
people who.iaie no homes that they can
call their own who are themselves the
chattels, the implements, the household
and plow-field conveniences of the lead
ing traitors these nobody pretends to
consider sharers in the unanimity and
resolution so boasted. On the contrary,
though they love the wretched hut3 which
serve them for homes, and would like to
live aod die between the hills which
bounded their infantile vision, they are
ready to flee all these at the beck of the
first man who offers them Freedom.
These Three Millions are the great indus
trial resource of the Rebellion until Free
dom i3 placed within their reach, when
they become its chief weakness and dan
ger. They stand ready to rally at the
first summons to any flag under which
they are promised Liberty. 4FLey cannot
be burned like cotton-bales, though they
sometimes arc as insurgents, but this is a
tedious and difneult process, by which hut
a small portion of them can be put out of
the way; they cannot bo concealed like
plate and jewels ; they cannot be run off
so easily and securelv as horses. Beinjr
huoian, they want to be free ; they incline
to the aide which promises them liberty;
and frcin that moment they become a
burden and a peril to the other. Enforce
the President's Proclamation of Freedom,
and even though we should win no deci
aive victories, Slavery must rapidly dis
solve and vanish, leaving the Rebellion no
excuse for prolonging its miserable exis
tence. We believe Jlff. Davis would
hioiwdf proclaim the extinction of Sla
very throughout his dominions but for the
chitons truth that this would render Se
cession an absurdity and lasting Disunion
iaigossiblc. ,
Give tlie new policy a fair trial. Let
each Union Army advance into the Rebel
territory bearing proudly cn its banners,
"Freedom- for AH." Let car gunboats
and iron-clad run up the rivers and inlets
of Jeffdom, proffering Freedom to All
Let every Union pObt and picket prificr
IibPrty-' au welcome to every fugitive j
frsqi Bbl Slavery. " Then our General1
will no longer march blindly and fight
enemies ef unknown strength just when
aud where those enemies shall see fit;
then the Rebels will have to picket and
watch against contrabands in their reaas
well as Union soldiers in their front. ' The
policy thus; inaugurated practically sub
tracts Three Millions from the number

agaimt us and adds it to those ready and
. , r' ' t
anxious to work for us. It adds another
New Eugland, Pennsylvania or Ohio to
the effective force of the loyal States.
Who but a traitor at heart can hesitate as
to its enforcement 't
Peace, then, in our judgment, cannot
be fai off. The Rebels are, according, to
their own and all other accounts, iutense
ly weary of the War. Self-indulgent-in
temper aud habits, they are suffering un
imaginable privations. Indolent to a pro
verb, they are compelled to ir.ake unheard
of and unceasing exertions. Accustomed
to sit by the fire aud do little or nothing
in Winter, they are camping out on bleak
hillsides without tencs, blankets or shoes.
But for the hopes inspired by rccint Dem'-
ccratic successes iu the Free States, thev
would be ready now to give it up. Let it
be shown that rho War under the Eman
cipation policy is to be vigorously pressed,
and they will soon know that their time
has come. We are at all events morally
certain to have. Peace' in Springj let . us

Tlje War.
The news from the various departments
of the army are highly' . interesting.
General Grant had advanced at last ac
counts to Abbeville, Mississippi, and oc
cupied that town. Gen. Sherman is at
ScMiatohia, on tii3 Memphis and New Or
leans Railaoad. lie will form h junction
with Giant's main army at Grenada June
tion, where the rebels will probably make
a stand. The general im predion seems
to he, h owever, that Gen. i'emberton has
fallen back to Jackson, which is on a line
running east and west through Vicksburg.
It is plain that General Grant now has the
advantage of breaking through the enemy's
line oi operations at xvienuian Junction,
on tlie Mobile aod Mississippi Railroad
Such a movement, if successfully executed
will end the war in the Southwest, as the
enemy's entire communications would be
iu our possession. The hopelessness of
the rebel cnuse is evident if we can destroy
or evt-.n keep busy during tiie winter, the
army ot uenerai Lee, which is now grad
ually falling back to the James river, iioui
a l'eur of disaster in the. Southwest and a
flank movement iu the region watered by

hope of the success of their cause will be
annihilated: By encuging the attention
of this army cf Lee and the fragmentary
corps of Beauregard, we insure the filial
safety and sujetss of Gen. Grant's plan.
Victories ot the mo?t substantial character
await our armies in Arkansas, Louisiana,
and Mississippi. The expedition of Gen
auks, which sailed irom New York
Thursday, will be heard from in a few days
and it will do much to crush that power
which is now sustaining the rebellion at a
point the very announcement of which
will create surprise. The Army of the
Potomac will soon be performing ita im
portant part iu thi3 last grand effort to
save our country from destruction ; for the
war cry is upon the air action, vigorous
and continued. The new vear will be
ushered in amid the n-ar of our artille.'y
and the steady onward tramp of our invin
cible divisions and corps.
Order to Cross tlie Potomac.
The following is a copy cf the oScial
despatch from General iialicek to Gener
al M'Clellan, ordering him to cross the
Potomac and pursue the deftated enemy,
alter the victory of Antietam :
Washington, D. C, October C, 1SC2.
Ma jou General M'Ci.ellan : lam
instructed to telegraph you as follows :
The President directs that ymi cross
the Potomac and give battle to the enemy,
or drive him South. Your army nmt
move now while the reads a ro good. If
you cross the river between the enemy
and Washington, and cover tlte latter by
your lice of operations', you can be rein
forced with thirty thousand men ; if 'you
move up the i alley of the Shenandoah,
not more than twelve or fil'teeu thousand
can be sent you. The President advises
the inferior line between Washington and
the enemy, but does not order it. lie is
very desirous that your army move as soon
as possible. You will immediately report
what line youudopt, and when you intend
to cross the river; also at what point the
reinforcements are to be sent. It is nec
essary that the plan of your operations be
positively determined on before orders are
given for building bridges and repairing
railroads.

Tlie President's Message.
From the Philadelphia Press.
It must be suid of the President that
he never takes up any subject without
exhausting it. lie approeahc-s every con
clusion calmly, slowly, and without pas
sion ; while, at times, we fee what 'night
be called hesitation aud irresolution, in
I the end we know that the spirit of the
. - j t . t
patriot has inspired every sentiment ana
jmi. So much magnanimity so much
justice so much consideration for mi
norities so mucn humanity so much
forbearance to those who have erred we
do not often see in those who rule empires.
We can only properly understand the
position of the President, as it is announ
ced in his message, by recalling the great
events of his present Administration.
We must remember that the "ruler w ho
now argues the necessity of Emancipation
was, in the beginning, its sincere and
consistent opponent, lie removed Fre
mont, and revoked the order of General
Hunter, aud berged the pro-slavery men
of" the Border States to make Emancipa
tion a civil measure by accepting the
resolution passed by Congress at his so
licitation, lii all this action e saw the
forbearance of a kind and. paternal ruler
a Chief Magistrate who did rot wish to
deal with the Southern rebels except as
erring and wayward child) cm.. But when
the rebellion assumed its present' propor
tions, and sought to overw helm the whole
Republic in ruin when the issue became
the death of slavery or the death cl the
Republic he boldly declared Kmancipa-
fiou. And this declaration he sustains in
one of the mot convincing, earnest, and
affectionate state papers 'I I; at ever came
from a 1 resioent of the united btates. -The
President avoids either extreme of
this complicated question. lie does not
.sustain JLmancipauon mereiy because it
gives fieedom to a number cf black la
borers, nor because it gratifies a human
itarian spirit in tlie North aud European
States. To him" it is a question of justice,
and a question of policy of justice to
the white people of the South, who are
oppresseu by the overburdened condition
of' their labor system, and a question of
policy which all who are acquainted with
trie nmuence that slavery has exerted on
this war will readily acknowledge.
Emancipation wili make a crushed, de
spised,. and almost useless race, a free and
available people. Emancipation will make
the npgro better than a slave, if he is not
as efficient and capable as the free white
man. We must dispose of these people
iu some way. Jf wo keep them iu sla
very, wo cultivate and cherih treason in
our midst. If we endeavor to colonize
them iu other countries, we attempt what
may, for yours to come, prove an imprac
ticable measure. If we throw among them
the fire-brand of insurrection, we turn the
social condition of everv slave State, loyal
or rebellious, intJ anarchy. Blood will
flow ; and death, with its attendant hor
rors, will come without reason, and go
without retaliation. Therefore, there is
only one jrround that reasonable men can
occupy, aud this is the ground tet forth
by the President in his proclamation.
There must be emancipation ; there can
only b equitable emancipation ; and
adopting the amendments to the Contsi
tutioti he proposes, we advance very far
to the consummation of this great idea.
There is something manly, too, in the
President's bold and irank appeal to the
future. "We cannot (he says) escape
hi.-tory. We of thiw Congieso, of this
Administration, will bo remembered.
Neither personal significance nor insignifi
cance can spare one or another of us.
The fiery trial through which we pas
will lhiht us down, w ith honor or dishonor,
to the latest generation." In a spirit like
this we trust the country will answer the
President's call, and that Congress will
enter upon its new duties with a snb'ime
and self dcuving courage. We can very
well anticipate tlie agitation which the
endorsement of this emancipation measure
will produce on all parts of the country..
We can realize the dismay which will
attend tlie Southern conspirators, as they
see this jrt and holy purpose curtained
oy the powf r of this great Republic.
Those who have been against us during
all this crisis, ill be airainst us now.
when we ask them to end the rebellion in
a just and honorable manner. But we
are convinced that the millions who think
and direct public sentiment, those who
are sincerely loyal aud anxious to save
this Union, will sustain the President in
his righteous course even to the end. He
offers us peace, and justice, and honor.
In his own quiuut and nervous languaL'n,
we can say to the country : "The way is
plain, peacetul, generous, just the way
which, if followed, the world will ever
applaud, and God must forever bles."
It is gratifying to find that our foreign
relations are in such a prosperous and
happy condition, aud that the uneasiness
which was -caused by the interchange of
p-)tes on the American tjuestion between
the great Powers has not affected the
diplomacy of the Administration. Our
financial affairs receive the President's
earnest consideration ; and we arc glad to
find that lie looks forward to an early
resumption of specie payments as a means
of strengthening the currency.
We also see that the war has not affec
ted the Post Oiiice arrangements, and
that this intricate and elaborate depart
men of the service exhibits a decided
improvement. We are glad -.o know also
that means are being taken to establish
a cheap and expeditious foreign postal
system., This will do as much to unite
and harmonize Europe and America a3
any oceanic 'telegraph, and we trust the
proposed convention will b fcaccesEfal.J
The Indian affairs in Minnesota receive
an incidental aliusion, and the President
suggests to Congress the propriety of re
modelling our whole Indian svstcnu Al
together ; the message is extnhu ly com
prehensive Mid satisfactory, and'will do
much to justify the public: confidence iu
the Administration! r
General iuIIti'Ei.s Report.
The report of the Commander-in-Chief
of the armies ot the United States, Major
General Henry W. ilalleck," has been
made-public. - That roj-ort is the. most
important document yet given to the
American public. It is the hitory cf the
war on the Potomac, and -begins 'with
General llaliu-k's visit of inspection and
consultation to the Army of the? Potomac
fat Harrison's Landing, on July4?5th, 27 th.
Ilia object was, if possible, to cause an
advance on liichmond from tho James
river; or if this was not possible, to unite
the armies, of. M'Cleliau and Pope for
combined or orations i'ii some other line.
He relates that General M'Clellan at first
required 50,000 additional men to attempt
theassaultof Richmond. He was informed
that only 20,000 could be spared ; offered
to make the attempt with their increase ,
but, when Gen. iialicek left him, - once
more changed his mind, and telegraphed
that he would require 35,000 a number
which he already knew it. was impossible
to send. As General M'Cieilau thus gave
up, in efleet, the attempted assault on
Richmond from the James, he was ordered
J on July 30, to prepare for a removal of
his army to Acq:ra Creek. General
L'urnside, ordered to the same point with
his army on the 1st of Aug., reached it on
the 3d. Ge neral M 'Cleilan, ordered on the
3d of August to withdraw his whole army,
sent a protest on the 5th of August, date-d
at neon on the 4th. To this it seeing
General Iialicek replied, with what will
appear to many singular mildness, next
day, the sixth ; and not till ei-'htdavs after
- ' ml
he had received the order for moving his
army, did Gen. M'Cieilau bcin to obey.
Meantime thft rebels were pressing Pope
On the 5th six days after M'ClcMan had
bee n ordered to move the battle of Cedar
Mountain was fought. Despatches cap
tured showed that the whole rebel army
was moving towards Pope, w ho was order
ed to full back. Though the army of the
Potomac was so long delayed, yet Ge neral
1-1 al leek reports that on the 27th of August
there was "every prospect that Jackson
would be destroyed before l einf'orcomen fs
could come to his relief." M'Cicl'.m's
army had then arrived at Alexandria
Hooker and Kearny were already with
Pope, lleintzflman also came into action
tho next morning ; but I'itz John Ir?cr,
"ordered to be at Krintow's Station on the
morning of lhc 2Sth," "for some unex
plained reason did rot comriv with this
order, and his corps ws not in the battles
of the 28th and 29th," fl,c decisive buttles
of that campaign. General Ilaile-ck corn
plains that some of the corps of ti e l'wt:
mc army behaved very badly. Oa the
3d of September Pope brought iii.s army
within the defences of Wellington, where
it came under command of M'Clellan.
He was at his own request relieved
Thus ended this move-men!, of which Gen
eral Halieck makes (his simple but rire
naut remarks : "Had the Amy of the Po
tomac arrived a fw days earlier, the rcM
army cou'd have, been easily deftated and
prrhops destroyed." Rut the render of
the report will remark that, had General
M'Clullan promptly obeyed orders, instead
of flittering away eleven precious days,
the Army' of the Potomac would certainly
have "arrived a few davs earlier."
Death of a NrniEvv of Jeff Davis
A correspondent of the Mobile 2?rix;er,
writing some incidents of the battle of
Corinth, drives the following :
"At Davis' Bridge-, on Sunday, tlie
accomplished and gallant Balfour, of Gen.
Vjih Doru's tafT, was fatally wounded.
He was observed to suddenly turn deathlv
pale, and dismount cautiously from his
horse. lie was a-ked il he was injured,
and replied in the negative. He then
walked to the shady side of a house, fell
in a reclining position, aud drew his
revolver. He had been mortall wounded,
a 'Minic ball parsing. through his bowels
but, with a fiili sense of his injury, he
coolly resigned bin. self to ids fate,
endeavoring to attract as little attention
and create as little alarm as pessible lie
died u few hours after receiving his
wound, with unsurpased coolness and
resignation. Major Uallcur was a mem
ber ed one of the most wealthy and influ
ential families of this .State, was the
nephew ot President Davis, and the pride
and hope ot his lamily. Ife was a gentle
man of excellent education, high polish,
and was an encyclopedia of general iufor
formation, obtained by study and travel."
CoMraoMitK. 'Ihere ate those who
still prate of compromise iu our quarrel.
To such we commend the following pass
age from the Westminister Review the
logical conclusion of a very able review of
the whole question :
"There is no possible ground for com
promise ; these the Americans themselves
have long since exhausted. The princi
ples at stake have come face to face ; they
do not admit of mediation. The South
have taken sword, and have bat hastened
the inevitable doom of that institution iu
whose defence they have drawn it."
"These tho Americans have long since
exhausted," most truly says the reviewer.

lit: An official report ot mice, made
tJ Prtsident Lincoln March oU, lfeUl, vi
our Southern forts, was pubii-htd on tlie
21st of October last. To this ex Prchideiit
Jiuchaiiun replied, at great length, iu the
same month. A short rejoinder from me
followed early in 'November, and here is
another paper froiii Mr. Jiuchanan, dated
the 17th ot the tame month, and on the
same subject. A brief notice of this pa
per shall terminate my part in this ..con
troversy. Mr. u?hanan ha3 intimated that' I
have been actuated by a feeling of per.-rm-'
! towarc& him' iliis ls u."-ust
I had no private resentment to uratity.
On the contrary, I have well remembered
the many official courtesies received fie ni.
him as well as from Mr. 11yd, both as
Governor of Virginia Mid Stcretary of
War : but to vindicate iust;ce and the
tru'ih oi history .is a . paramount obliga
tion.
I had said : that, with a view to the
meditated rebellion, Sccrctarv Piuvd had
ordered 110.000 extra stand of muskets
and rifk-s f u m Northern depositories.; to
fcoutticru arsenals. Jo this Mr. h. now
replies in substance -1. That the trans
ltis were made under an order oaitcl
nearly a year before" Mr. Lincoln's elec
tion to the Presidency. True; but if Mr.
li. has persuaded himseifth.it the revolt
had not long, long before been planned,
(dependent on the elicti n of any North
ern man) it is not likely tht lie will ever
make a second convert to tbat opinion. '2.
He enly gives lU5,000 as the number ot
arms transferred, omitting tlie 10,UOO
lilies'. 3. He says that thc muskets
(lO5,00o) were condemned; and that pur
c!)a.-eis could uot hi fouud for many of
them at S2 50 each. Now, here is an
ocicial . statement, made to mo eighteen
months ago, (ju-t received frcm my papets
at Washington,) showing that 63,u'JJ ti
tnese arm- were "percussion muskets,"
probably entirely new, and 40,000 others,
termed "muskets altered to percu.-siou,"
with 10,000 "percussion rifles," r.ct one
cd tho 115. 000 was evtr "condemned."
but all precisely like most e.f the small
arms issued troops (regular and volunteer)
in 1S61. 4. Mr. Ruchauan further inti
mates that those arms were transferred to
equalize,
iu some degree, the deposits
among tbe dillereut States, as if these
had ai.y State pride in allowing storage to
the property of the United States within
their particular iimits. if eo, why not
estabii.-h storage places in the gr..-at Stares
of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, within
which tlie United S'.ates ha- hud no
deposit of arms and r o arsenal ?. O. Mr.
U supposes me to brand the transferred
arms with the epithet "stolen." In mv
re-joinder to him I r ow here use that term.
because) I knew the trausdetion, though
very .puictly conducted, was officially le
C' tdc-o', and tiie freight j aid IV v by th-.
United States, w hose pnptity the arais
continued to be iu their new deposito
ries. Mr. Buchanan i:iixcs up perhaps I
ought rather to say, seems t-j Lfjufuund
quite a different class of arms with the
foregoing: the quo: a of arms distributed
among the several States under tl eaunuai
appropriations toward.-, arming the whjlv
body of the mihtia of the Union. Thus
he says, "The Southern States received
in lctJO less, instead of more, than the
quota of arms to whh h they wire entitled
by law." This i-j most strange, .cntrastcd
with information given to me lait year,
and with a telegram just received from
Washington and a high i nicer mt of the
jOrduance Bureau iu tl.ce words and
fii: u res :
"llhodc I.-I-md, Delaware, and Texa-'
had not drawn at the end of eighteen
sixty (lSGU) their annual quota of arms
for ibat year, and Massachusetts, Tennes
see, and Kentucky only in part; Virginia,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Kansas Were,
oy toe order of the Secretary cf War,
supplied with their quotas for eighteen
sixty one (1SG1) in ad vauce, and Penn
sylvania and Man land iu part."
This advance of arms to eiht South
ern States is a sufficient commentary by
itself on the transfer, about tlie same lime,
of the 115,00 mukets and rifles.
In respect to ihe heavy cannou ordered
from Pittsburg to the Gulf of Mexico,
Mr. Buchanan has shown me that I was
in error in saying that their shipment
was countermanded in March instead of
January. LSOI. This was the only imma
terial pan of my statement; lor I was
correct in the declaration that I gave
information to Mr. Secretary Holt that
the shipment had commenced, and that
he ordered the guns to be relanded, and
stopped the robbery.
