THE TBEAfUttY BEPOBT.
Kelt in importance to the President’s mes
sage at each recurring session of the national
legislature is tie report of the Secretary of
the Treasury. Wc have examined this docu
ment, the first which Secretary Fessenden
has presented to Congress, with some degree
of foreboding, in view of the criticism said to
hare been visited upon it by certain eastern.
Journals, alleging that It “recommends noth.
tog. I*’ 1 *’ We find that It doos recommend-the
following things:
Ist. Thu raising of money by loans instead
■of the furtherissne of legal lender notes.
2d. The Issuing of bonds, whereof the In
terest shall be paid in lawful money instead
of coin, convertible into gold bearing bonds
at some future period.
Sd. The adoption of such discriminating
legislation as shall induce all State Banks to
adopt tbcnational system.
4lh; The raising of at least fifty millions of
dollars more by taxation than is now afford'
cd by the Internal Revenue act/by taxes on
sales, on leaf tobacco, on mines, on incomes
now exempt, etc.
sth. The appointment of a commission to
take the subject of Internal Revenue Into
consideration, with a view to
the discovery of new sources of income and
the correction of any inequalities or defects
now existing— ♦
There are several recommendations of a
minor character, but the foregoing are suffi
cient to warrant the remark that those who
complain that -Mr. Fessenden recommends
nothing have not fortified their judgments by
reading his report. In these five propositions
which the Secretary urges upon the atten
tio i of Congress, he has our most cordia*
(Onmrrcncc. We'havc, at all times, advoca
ted tie policy of restricting the existing pa
pci clr 'ulalion of the country to its present
bom ds, even at of great tribulation
for the time being; and il is with much plea
sure that wc notice the statement in the re
l»ort that only a trifling-addition has been
made to this circulation during the past six
months—the ninety millions of compound in
terest notes having been issued to replace an
equal amount of five per cent coupon notes
taken up and destroyed. The only contin
gency, Mr. Fessenden assures ns, under
which he shall feel Justified in issuing any
more notes, will be the actual impossibility
of obtaining means for catrving on the war i
in any other way. He relies on the patriot- I
ism of the people to furnish the money to
carry out the views so distinctly pronounced
in the election. Upon this point he says:
■ .iVJ^ no «i[ Ddl .'’ ,ai l al . wou J d considerable add
lion (o the circulation, in any form, be more ob-
Jcctiooablc than to the present head oftheTreas
nry Department, and no one would resort to
* such oi measure when the circulation was ode
quale to the wants of business, with more relnc
-4* Y?* 3 - .^ or £ ocs belleve that a patriotic neo
ttplc, struggling for national existence, and
t* 01 ample means, would compel him to
adopt a measure so fraught with injurious consc
-44 Sl c u“ 6 ’“ 8 u ?J, ss, i c ° r ,ni*P er beyond the
4 iV? P rcß< -ribed. *h® question, however,
would be one for that people to decide. Thev
‘ihayepronomu-edfora continuance of the war
! U » U k i J 4i f ruaL ol, J e . cts hare been accom-
mumstakaole terns. It is for them
further to determine whether the nccessarr
‘ moans thall l>« furnished by way of loan, and the
I; circulation restrained within safe limit-C or
whether they to endure the evils of
wlth a-losg of credit In the

‘ necessities of the occasion may demand. But
4 the Stxrvtary confidently believes that, lnd"im
‘ lug from past <H-cnta and recent demonstrations
. 'ljci. can Ix-liltleqncstion what thepnbllc voice
4‘ will be upon a question so vital.”
The reason for discontinuing the Issue of
gold bearing bonds is that the capacity of the
customs duties to furnish coinfor thepayment
of intci est is so nearly reached that it Is dan-
gerous to exceed the present amount. The
i&sue of bonds bearing interest in currency is
the only recourse left.
The estimated amount required to he raised
by loans for the fiscal year ending June 30
ISCS, is $570,727,505.11, and for the year end
ing June 30, 1866, $409,621,005.17, a part of
which is to meet principal on the public debt
fallingdne. The estimated amount of the pub
lic debt on the 30th ot June, 1666, provided the
war shall continue on the same scale as here
tofore, is $2,045,320,652.63.
The report as a whole is an able, lucid, and
most candid document which cannot fail to
strengthen the public credit Congress can
not do better than to carry the suggestions of
the Secretary into effect The people are
ready to meet the financial question, as well
as the military question, involved in the sup
pression of the rebellion. They only require
that the means employed shall be used intel
ligently and economically. So long as they
are satisfied in this regard they will furnish
the money as freely as they furnish the men,
and they will furnish all that may be needed
of both. '
THE LATE PA RXV
It frequently occurs in naval combats Uiat
one party so far overestimates the power of
his adversary as to bring to bear upon it alto
■ gather too heavy guns and too many of them,
thus utterly sinking a prize which he would
prefer to capture. TVe fear this has been the
case with usinourlatoduelwiththe“ Demo
cratic party. 1 ' We have been coasting verv
carefully over the scene of the fight, we have
brought every accessible spy-glass to bear on
the spot where, on the eighth of November
last, we fired our last full broadside into the
old hull “ Democracy,”— the smoke has risen
—but the craft has disappeared. The case
bears a melancholy resemblance to the fate of
the Alabama under the fire of the Kearsarge
with the harrowing contrast that we have no
assurance in this case that the Captain of the
Copperhead craft found refuge in a. neutral
yawl, though there are intimations that he
was not behind Captain Scmmes in this re
spect. But, seriously, we are getting alarmed
at the evidences that our late antagonist is
no more. “Democratic” journals are white
washing their old politics, setting adrift their
old editors, or selling out and nailing up their
shutters by the dozen. “Democratic” poli
ticians, including scores of the “high and
mighty” (oftener “high” than mighty), who
were about to “ rave the country” lately at
Chicago, ave subsided Into village attorneys,
country school-masters, or
«f brandy cock-tails , and mint
juleps. Is there no balm In Gilead for these
wounded souls ? Is the Sanitary Commission
deaf to the cry of their distress ? Can nothing
be done to revive their sinking hopes, and
enable them onee more to look loyai men in
tire eye ?
Wc insist that we entered into the contest
with no intent thus to anuihiiate them.
There are many reasons why we should monm
over their total loss. They have become easy
to whip. It is rather a pleasure than other
wise to give them an opportunity of gaining
new strength by touching their mother earth
under the influence of superior force. Not to
put too fine a point upon it, they stand up
w clland wc like to knock them down, but
for that very reason wc' grieve to see them
stay down. Again, philosophically, there must
always be two parties, the right and the
wrong, the “ ins” and the “ onti,” the sue.
cessfnl and the unsuccessful. Now what can
be more accommodating in a political party
than to be willing to he so tar wrong and so
manifestly dangerous as to be necessarily un
successful * Such a party is the modem
“ democratic.” For our part we could have
breathed no more fervent prayer tl»«o that it
might live long and repent late. Any infor
mation therefore that it is still alive, and has
“not yc: vowed to vole for abolition, will vast-’
lyrsiuage our grief. If it la no more, wc fear
we are indeed undone.
Proposed Amendments to the Revenue
Law.
The recommendations in the Important re
port of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
aic understood to be approved by the Secre
tary of the Treasury. They arc principally;
Ist. That the tax on distilled spirits be not
reduced one ioja.
fid. That the tax on the whole tobacco pro
duct be laid on the leaf.
Sd. That if it be not that the tax on clears
be laid on on ad valorem scale. *
4th. That a tax of one-half of one per cent
be levied on scales of merchandise and pro
ducts which amount to $11,000,000,033 a
year, and which would yield $55,033,023 of
revenue.
Oth. That the Keciprocity Treat v with Cana
da be rescinded because it lets in a vast
amount of coal—'this year halfa million—free
of revenue duty and free of the excise doty of
thiec and a half gents a ton. and because it
draws away from us to Canada vast quantities
of corn—this year four and a quarter millions
of bushels—to be distilled into spirits and
smuggled back heroin fraud of our revenue,
aud because it tempts the fraudulent exporta
tion to Canada of onr tobacco in tbe leaf—
worth—there to be manu
factured into cigars, and smugs ed back over
the frontier.
Cth. Thai to save revenue the business of
assaying gold and silver be done by the Gov
ernment, and not at private establishments:
and that the present license fbe for assaying
be made so large as to he prohibitory.
7th. That crude petroleum be taxed two or
three cents a gallon, and the tax on refined
reduced to fourteen or fifteen cents.
Blh. That the tax on publications Hie laid
•on the press-work and binding.
9th. That the tariff on iron, particularly on
rails, of which 120.000 tuns were imported
from Great Britain last year, should be raised
at least a dollar and a half a tun.
10th. To make the test of the yearly income
derived from real estate its rental value. *
1L To provide for summary and inexpen
sive processes .to recover small penalties, and
procure forfeitures of small lots of contraband
goods.
-The Commissioner of. Internal Revenue es
timates that the Excise as it stands, and if
not ent down and tinkered Jyj Congress on
the pressure of lobby delegations, will yield
three hundred mllllons'a year on the present
business of the country; that it will pay the
current of the nation, including in
terest at six per cent on the war debt, and
pay qfi the debt Itself within ninety years.

Excess of Federal loss.
Total loss.
These figures are gross perversions of the
truth. The rebel losses are purposely under*
staled fully any per cent, while the Fede
ral losses are overstated at least fifty percent.
Take the whole war together, and the excess
of loss has been on the side of the rebels. We
.hold to-day 25,000 more of their prisoners
than they do of ones, which fact effectually
disposes of the claim of the Southern Alma
nac that they have taken the most. The
rebel loss of prisoners during 1884 is set down
as only 7,500. Why, Sherman took as many
as 10,000 and Grant at least 18,000. The reb
els have lost considerably more prisoners this
year than the Fcdcials. The Federal loss by
battle and sickness has not exceeded onc-half
that stated in the above table. Bnt it serves
a purpose to stuff Southern people with
this sort of deception*

We now have the pleasure of announcing
that Dr. D. K. Green, the Union candidate
for Senator in the Fourth District, is posi
tively elected over Stephenson (Copperhead),
by a majority of one. The matter is settled
by the following note from the County Clerk
of Marion county to the Secretary of State, in
which be states that in the return made to
the office of the latter he made a mistake, by
giving Stephenson one vote more than he re
ceived. Dr. Green will undoubtedly receive
a certificate of election from the Countv

The third is addressed to tbe Danes, and

{named an American lady named Lee; and in
consequence has been forced to renounce his
rights as a member of a sovereign house, Jjls
bride having refused to consent to a morgan

bridegroom, the Emperor of Austria has con
ferred on him the title of Prince, and the

The quiet attention given to the reading of

words of the Message, “the war will cease on

The 72d has been called into active service
again, as most of your readers are aware X
will proceed to inform them of the where
abouts of the regiment preceding the late
battle of Franklin. Soon after its arrival at
Columbia it was assigned to the 23d army
corps, temporarily. While there it moved
camp several times,.lortifled the town, and
guarded the railroad bridge over Duck Kivcr.
It became pretty warm work on Monday, the
28th ultimo, and on the morning of the 39th
our brigade left for Springfield. Nightfall
found us in the vicinity of the enemy. We
I wire cspcedily brought Into line of battle,
and marched In that position for -over two
miles, through the woods and undergrowth,
and over lienees, occasionally being under a
smarMre from the lurking enemy. Present
-17 we found ourselves in the presence of an
.unknown fforcq, some being of the opinion
that they were our own men, others saying
that it was the camp of the forces under.
Cheatham; Wheeler, and Forrest, which turn
ed out to be the case. Luckily for us we with
drew, and marched, though not unmolested
towards Franklin. Our boys were favored
with about an hour and a half of sleep that
night. 1
The regiment reached Franklin at day-break
of the 80th, and proceeded at once to fortify
the place.
The 72dwas placed at the center of the
lines surrounding the city, and upon a gentle
slope,’at the bottom of which and outside of
the line was a small grove of yonng trees. On
onr right was a Repression an eighth of a mile
wide, on our left the ground was higher than
that occupied by onr regiment. The men
were not in ihe best condition for an cn-age
ment, bat nevertheless they aU took their,
positions In the pita, with an evident willing
ness, if not eagerness, and so confident were
officers end men that we should hold onr line
that nothing was taken by them except their
arms and accoutrements. The regimeatwere

Some were watching the advancing tSe and
the dimly descried contest in the distance
some intently t-ngoged in thinking over the
probabilities of the impending- battle while
not a few were silently but fervently offering
up a prayer to heaven. J 5
On rushed the maddened foe. When thev
came in range the cry went up, “Open oh
Them, boys; give it to them.” And the boys
did open on them, and, when once com 1

almost without exception. It could no be
that ail were mourners. It conld not be that
all were sad. Is it possible that fashion has
envied the widow, the bereaved mother, the
orphan, and has clothed herself with the robe
of mourning, in solemn mockery of the na

Of course, but little business was tmusac

was promptly laid on the table, to the great
discomfiture of those who were so unfortu

produced some soft com for his constituents
in the shape of a resolution to reduce the

eonsenpti have stepped out in the hall to hear
the multiplied “wants” of their constitu

dreds of miles to get their Senator’s
name to a recommendation for a
Commission in the army or navy. Others
have come in behalf of the good people of
Chipplctepcck, who want measures taken to
-have the Pacific Railroad run through their

To be sure, the thing gets to be somethin"

TUKAL SOCIETY.
Annual Meeting.
[From our Special Correspondent]
Bloomington, Dec. 7, iSW.
TUESDAY EVENING’S SESSION.
The first hi order was a paper by Dr. Hall
on Orchard Sites. A discussion followed oa
the Strawberry, with a recommendation in
favor of'Wilson’s Albany and the lowa.
WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION.
On motion, Currants for general cultivation,
were taken up for adoption.. The following,
after discussion, were recommended: Red
■Dutch, White Dutch and White.
SITES FOR ORCHARDS.
In selecting sites adapted to the wants of
the orchardist, attention should be paid to
their elevations, with their approximate sur
roundings ; such as large and small streams
ofwater, the protection and influence of tlra.
ber, and other causes more or less local. Most
persons in descending to low valleys of a still
night, cspeciallly those watered by small
streams, cannot have failed to observe the
great degree of cold always present in these
situations; the comparatirc'difiercnce in tem
perature will be found to be greater when the
atmosphere is still and highly charged with
moisture. Small, shallow bodies of water ab
sorb heat rapidly during the day, consequent
ly the valleys are warmer than the hills. They
part with it with equal facility in the night,
and thus their relative conditions are changed
the warm air has risen, and the colder air
from Us greater density, has descended and
remains. The valley is not so cold in the
early part, as later. Mnch of the heat of the
air is absorbed by the water in evaporation,
which is always a cooling process; and the
keen greater will bo
the difference between the temperature of the
hill and the valley. As for instance, in cer
tain portions of Hindoston, .where the
atmosphere is very dry and hot, ice,
onc-lourth of an inch thick is formed on
water exposed at night la broad, shaUowpans.
This i» due to the rapid evaporation which
cools the water. .
Countries covered with dense forests, ow-
Ing to their retention of moisture, are colder
in the same latitude than those less thicklv
wooded.
Yearly observations, made in
•hood of Alton, on elevations of from 20 to
200 feet above and bordering on the Missis
iTef»,6iTe a dilferencc in temperature,
on still nights, as great as twelve degrees.
SS^??!4 e -i >a B an Ovation of 250
feet, and distant 50 yards from the river, irost
was barfly perceptible. On descending to
■ mar the mouth ol a ravine, which acts as a
drain for the passage of cold air to a consid
b L c 5 t - en l 7f. c ° unt^.ic<f had formed of
one-third inch thickness. Again, commencing
at an elevation not above fifty feet, when the
drainage to the river was .unobstructed, and
from that jaunt to the summit before referred
to, frost was not observed and tender annual
plants remained nnhnrt until the 3d of No
vember. * * * Our cold winds being from
llie north and west, these observations will
suveto show that the motion of the atmos
jdicie may obstruct the frci* descent of cold
air, which,from Its greater density rolls down
from the high lands in Jo the lowest depres
sions, and Urns tender north and wcat evpo
rnres of less value for the production of ten
der plants than south and cast. It will thus
appear that those situations which are eleva
ted and in Ihe immediate vicinity of large
bodies of water are most secure from late and
early frosts. Other sites elevated above the
surrounding levels into which cold air will
freely descend, are scattered throughout the
length and breadth of the State, aid will ho
found well suited to most products of the
orchard.
A discußsion followed on tHe Strawberry,
wits a recommendation for general cnlUra
tion of the TVdeon’e Albany and lowa.
WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION.
lie first in order was the discussion of the.
best qualities of Curhasts for general cnltl
ra;ion, and the Red Dutch, White Dutch,
Grape and Victoria were recommended!
Ihc Gooseberry for popular cultivation
was then taken up, and Honghton’s Seedling
and Upright’s Cluster or Pale Red . were
adopted. The merits of the latter quality
were discussed at some length, and succeeded
on a divided vote.
_ The Raspberry followed, and the Dollttle
Black Cap, Purple Cane, and Ohio Ever-bear
ing were recommended. The letter quality
■was discussed at some length, and was finally
carried by a close Tote. J
'The Blackberry came up for discussion.
The Lawton was recommended as the only
one worthy of general cultivation.
The article of Mulberry as a fruit was then
taken np, and rejected as unsnited for fruit.
One of the gentlemen present stated that he
it first rate feed for fattening
i he Grape-wrs taken up, and a general dis.
cns&lon on the best varieties for general and
extensive cultivation, and the mode of culti
vation, followed, each speaker being confined
to two minutes. .
Tbe Concord was first discussed, and rccom
mended.
The Hartford Prolife was discussed, and re
commended os an early table grape.
The Dtlmcare was next discussed, and re
c°mmendod for general cultivation.
The Jh’ana was taken up and rejected for
general cultivation.
Horton's Virginia was discussed and recom
mended for general cultivation, and more
particularly for wine purposes, as the very
best that can be grown.
The Clinton was then taken up, discussed,
and recommended as a wine grape.

The apple question was then suspended in
order to witness some of the exercises in the
formal School. ♦ •
ThcdlKMsion on apples took a wide range,
and the list agreed upon was made np on Mr
Jia 0 “l to .? dd l h( ' consideration of
tiie merits of either. The vote was influenced
to a great extent hj the prejudices of a sec
tional character, of the members. With a
State which embraces six degrees of latitude
and much variation of soil and climate itmav
be regarded as a pretty difficult task to
upon.a general list appropriate to the wide
State, and the practice, as heretofore follow
cd, of making sectional lists—for Northern
Central, ana Sonthcm Illinois—we thlnlj
wonld have resulted more satisfactorily to all
concerned. The list made out seemed to
satisfy very few, as a whole, and I should not
wonder if the whole thing was ripped up be
fore the Societv adjoumwl. After witnessing
the exercises in the Normal School, whlcff
were of a high order, and deeply interesting

MAKING SUGAR.
Mr. Thomas Moore, of Bloomington, was
allowed fifteen minutes to explain his man
ner of making sugar from sorghum molasses.
On motion, a committee oT three was ap
pointed to examine and report on Mr. Moore’s
process of making sugar, and that they test
the sugar m tea and otherwise. The follow

min Linton, of Montgomery: and Theodore
Gcnnest, of Champaign.
BEET SUGAR.
A Mr. Gennest, of Chatsworth, made further
statements in regard to the manufacture of
beet sugar, in continuation of his remarks of
yesterday afternoon. He condemned the ma
ny patents, obtained and anticipated, for
making sugar from sorghum. If file discov
eries which werepatented were good for anv

public. This- was always done In Knrope
—nobody kept anything of this Jdndfrom the
public. There are In this'county some unc
hundred patents for making sugar from sor
ghum. He had a book patented many years
ago, m which plates and-explanations of
every one of them conld be found; and every
one of them had proved a failure. He thought

He thought there was very little sn»ar fn
sorghum, and what little was there, wal hard
to get out. It would make good syrup and
he saw no reason for attempting to make*
sugar from it; it was simply ridiculous. He
explained the manner of raising beets for

The Incendiary Plot lu Now York—
Jzane: liTerr aro(Uer’» Son of Uie In
cendiaries. -
[From the Richmond Enquirer, Dec. 3J
The universal Yankee nation is agitated.
Sncb an excitement has not overtaken that
people for many years. “A black valise,”
like water unto a mad dog, throws all New
York Into fits. It Is worth the liberty, and
before long it will be worth the life, of a man
to be owner or occupier of a black valise.
- -A reword of twenty-lire thousand dollars is
offered by the city,” and proprietors ofhotels
in public have unanimously whereased and
resolved that many hotels were fired on the
25lhond 2Cth instants, and that a reward of
$20 ; 000 be offered by the N. Y. H. K, S., or
society for the safe keeping of New York ho
tels from the incendiary devilment of wicked
rebels. Admiral Pauldlfig has forbid any
man piling the navy yards. The very fires
of hell arc said to smoulder in a black valise
—phesphorus, turpentine,- Greek fire, fulmi
nateof mcrcunr, and another combustible
which some Northern rebel has invented
that resembles common coal. No man is
safe with a black valise—that slock has
greatly fallen, amrhas injured the value of
black leathef trunks, boots, bridle-reins har
ness-all things resembling valise are
regarded as suspicions. This is the people
that have started out a-conqucrlng, and are
now frightened into duck fits by a shaving
apparatus. Of course, it was a “ rebel incen
diary plot!” Didn’t they fire on Fort Sumter,
where floated the “Old Flag?” A morality
that does not restrain violence to fee emblem
of the “best Government, &«,” will hardly
be proof against the sin of burning hotels •
Nolhing can be clearer than the proof of
Mr. Davis’ complicity with the burning or
attempt to bum some half-dozen hotel* in
New York. We have never read anythin"
more truly Yankeeish than this whole” affair.
We arc very glad to. see that all Southern
reftigees arc required to register. If General
DU wffl hang them, he uiU do a service to our
cause; they are a set of cowardly sneaks, who
/taring deserted (heir country, are not above burn
ing hotels. Bang every mother 3 * son of them.
[From the Whig. Dec. 2.]
•We arc rather sorry that the man with the
black yaUse commenced his operations In
! New York. We may say that wc are sorry
hf tried his hand on NcwYork at all—or at
least under present circumstance. Hod he
succeeded, he would, perhaps, have effected
a greatnart of the commer
dal metropolis of Yankeedom; hat It is not
against the commercial metropolis of Yankee
dom that southern hpstllitv Im at this'mo
gent directed; If there Is toy pln«e In the
North that ought to be spared, that place Is
New York. Not that its population is ever
friendly to us, but that It is undeniably hos
tile to Lincoln and his government. Lincoln
was beaten just about two to one at the late
election In New York city; and this fact, let
us interpret McClellan’s views ns we please,
takes the people of that city out of the cate
gory of those sanguinary foes of the South
who are preaching universal fnurder and ex
termination. and who wildly applaud the
savage warfare waged against this confed
eracy by such men as Butler, Sheridan, Sher
man, Turchin, Payne and McNeil. Now
York, by voting for McClellan, expressed
herdlfiapprohatlon of the kind of warfare that
Lincoln’s parly urges and that Lincoln’s gen
erals rvage. New York may be in Hirnr of
war; but she w*nld conduct war on civilized
principles, and consequently has not made
herself liable to that just retribution which
enghtto bo visited on other Yankee cities.
>\e hope, therefore, that the gentleman of
the block valise will resolve to let New York
alone, and-turn his attention to cities more
eminently deserving of it—Boston, for in
stance, or Philadelphia. The destruction of
places like these would be something like an
approximate equivalent for the atrouitij
that Yankee armies hare committed in the
South. It would show that the South has
means of defending herself against the sys
tem of universal arson employed by the Yan
kee*, would prove, perhaps, even more
efficacious than the direct punishment of
the perpetrators. Of coarse we do not in
tend to enter into any argument as to the
right or wrong of this matter. We know that
arson Is a veiy wicked thing; bet we know,
likewise, that it ceases to be wicked when
employed in their own defense, by a people
who have been made its victims forthreelong
and weary years. From one end of this Con
fedcracy to the other, the charred and black
ened rums of homesteads and towns bear
testimony to the unsparing ferocity of our
enemies In the use of the torch. Rut when
their own cities are threatened, their, own
property imperiled, their own homes In dan
ger of the consuming lire, they discover that
! arson is a very homble crime. It is ipity
they had not made the discovery sooner.
The man with the black valise is atnon"
them, and will not be exorcised. He is üb£
qmtnua. -He can be at eight different New '
York hofejs in one night; and there is no rea
son why he should not be In half a dozen Yan
kee cities at the same time.
They may imagine for a moment that they
have caught him;.but ho will elude their
grasp, and defy their vain efforts either to ar
rest his person or baffic his attempts. Bis
plans are iced laid ,* but ire cannot help repedting
the Irish that he will not again try to consummate
ihtm in ATmc York for the present.

Chicago Provision Market.
_ . Chicago, Dec. 9, ISM.
The prices of Provisions since oar last have
gradually Improved, and within the last three or
four davs quite an excitement sprung up, and
prices advanced still further In moat articles ; ifc
general .feeling was short crop and higher price*
and most every one acted on this Impression;
hut to-day the lover subsided somewhat, without
any mororcason than they bad to be excited here
tofore. The ITog crop, wo think, cannot toll short
over 10 to 16 per cent. If that; yet even this defl
ciency encourages many to operate largely. If we
could believe all we hear from drovers, and the
information derived from our correspondents in
Dog growing regions, we might think 20 to 25 per
cent short not an over-estimate; but wo regard
these advices with a great deal of uncertainty and
ftanght with personal interests. The general mar
ket to-day closes with more sellers
buyers- at our quotations. The demand

The Proposition to Prohibit the Exporta

IFrom the N. Y. Trlbune.7th)
If Congress wishes gold to go to'SOO all that la
wanted la a few movements like this of the late
Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
who by yesterday’s Indiscretion substantially
damaged the Government and aided gamblers In
(From the K. Y. Commercial Advertiser, Tth.l
The blind showfc in these proposals,
not only to the irrepressible natural laws oYcoml
merce ? fcc and otter failure of
every late Congressional attempt to control thoso
is possibly astounding, ft is not only ha
mlllating, but alarmin?, to reflect that we hare
men in Congress who can show such Ignorance on
financial aflalra as
measures, and can yet maintain the-position ,of
leaders on the great fiscal questions of the hoar.
Mr. Stevens was, during last session, chairman of
the Committee on Ways and Ucons, and the pro-

CHICAGO CATTI4B MARKET.
Fmoat Etkkino,
HOGS—The receipts last evening, and during the
day, amounted to about 13,000h0gs P besides which ser
eral heavy Block trains arrived late this afternoon an*
others are still expected.
The transactions or the day still Indicate that In re.
gard to prices, tho highest point had not been attained,
as on prime to extra grades we note a still farther ad
vance on yesterday's current rates, of 23c per 100 As
on prime to extra qualities of stock. *
The .weather, though continuing cold, baa been
milder, and consequently more favorable to business.
The advance gained on, the previous quotations of
Mesa and Prime Mess Pork, has considerably stlmn
lated the activity of our city packers, who are almost
the only operators of any moment at present In the
market; as besides the pnrehises made by S. Allerton
* Co., of about TOO hogs for the New York market, aU
most the entire tales made to-Jay were to city packers.
I Tht market opened this morning at an early hoar
and with a fall attendance of buyers, among whom
there was no want ot confidence,, and a fall disposi
tion to buy at the previous rates of the
market.' 'With an active competition sellers were
unusually Arm in their views, and upon many
of the earlier transactions very high prices
were attained, especially for choice and
fancy grades of stock, ol which we note
the following: 125 hcad.averaglng-239 At, at 111.795

In the afternoon there was very little stock unsold 1
in the yards; bnt buyers continued to wait, anxiously
expecting the arrivals of addliional trains, which were •
considerably detained, and did not arrive nntlldark.
whatever may be the feeling outside, there was no
manifestation of any want of confidence shown la the\
market, which closed, ss It opened, active and ex

A LADT OF WORLD-WIDE REPUTATION.
Who is Mrs. S. A. Allen?
As this question is often ashed ns, we with pleasure
give a little history of her. Some twenty jests ago,
a lady in New York city observed that her hair was
rapidly losing 1 • natural color, and getting quite
gray, and disliking the Idea of becoming gray, and
equally averse*to using any dye (knowing them to be
Injurious), concluded that she would try and Invent
something that wonld restore her hair to Its orlglna
life color; and, by dint ot study and perseverance la '
experimenting, she succeeded la finding that the ar
ticles she had compounded would not only'restore •
the hair to its original .color, hut also render Itplla
ble, and give It the natural moistures a head ot hair
should have. This was even more she bad
hoped for, and, without the at first
ofauklng a business of It, she wafactually forced
to commence making It for sale, by the number of
persons of her acquaintance and others, whom her
acquaintances bad Informed ot the remarkable .
change la her hair, calling at her residence to procure
and she now probably dors one of the v,
ersfit 'cash businesses in, the City of New Tort.
Owing to the large demand from,foreign counwee,*
she has been obliged to establish a depot for the ex.
el naive tale of her Hair Preparations In London, at ICO
High Holhorn. Principal Manufactory end galea
