STOP BUYING EXPENSIVE
COUGH REMEDIES.
Make The Best At Home.
Money spent for the old style, ready-
made, cough syrups in bottles holding
only 2 to 2J ounces is very largely wasted.
because most of them are composed prin
cipally of sugar and water. Yet you
have to pay the same price as if it was
all medicine. Stop wasting this money.
You can make a better cough medicine
at home at one-fifth the cost. Merely go
to Henry L. Perry's Drug Store and ask
for 2 ounces (50c worth) of Schiffman's
Concentrated Expectorant. Mix this
with one pint of granulated sugar and
one-half pint of boiling water, which
makes a full pint (16 ounces). This new.
simple, pleasant remedy is guaranteed
to relieve the worst cough or cold. Also
excellent for Bronchial .Asthma, Bron
chitis, croup, hoarseness and whooping
cough. One bottle' will make enough
borne mada cough medicine to probably
bly last the' whole family the entire
winter. Children like it, it is so pleas
ant to take and it positively contains
no chloroform, opium, morphine or
other narcotics as do most cough jaix-
tures. Keep it on hand in case of emer
gency and stop each cough before it gets
a firm hold. The above druggist has
been authorized to return the money in
every single case where it does not give
perfect satisfaction or is not found the
best remedy ever nsed. Absolutely no
risk is run in buying this remedy under
this positive guarantee. Adv.

Stock Owners Warned Against
Imposters.
Reports are now beginning to come
into the department from several of the
States quarantined for the foot-and-
mouth disease that persons who have no
connection whatsoever with the depart
ment are attempting to pass themselves
off as Federal inspectors. There are
several possible motives that might ac
count for the existence of these impos
ters. In the outbreak of 1908 there were
instances of men who obtained money
from credulous victims who believed
that in this way they would escape the
inconveniences of quarantine and disin
fection. This is, of course, a very sim
pie form of extortion. Another motive
may be the sale of some quack remedy
for the disease
Slock owners can protect themselves
very easily against this fraud, for there
ia no specific remedy for the foot-and-
mouth disease. Since the germ has never
been isolated, it has never been possible
as yet to find any serum that would act
either as a cure or preventive, and the
public may be quite certain that anyone
who says that he is an employee of the
Department of Agriculture, and at the
same time attempts to sell or even rec
ommend anything of the sort, is simply
an imposter. For this reason stock
owners are warbed not to allow strang
ers to visit their stock or attemp any
demonstration of so called cures by in
jections or otherwise.
There is, moreover, very great danger
that such people might disseminate the
disease. It is a well-known fact that
ihe germs can be carried on clothing.
In infected territory, therefore, it is
quite possible that a man wbo has come
in conlact with stricken animals may
bring the disease to a perfectly healthy
herd " This also accounts for much of
the spread of hog cholera.
The department therefore recom
mends all farmers to keep their animals
from contact with - all save those who
have definite business with them Fed.
eral Bulletin.
The Federal authorities say that milk
from suspected or exposed cows should
be boiled thirty minutes. Meat should
be well cooked. There is little danger
of people contracting the disease.
