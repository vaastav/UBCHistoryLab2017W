PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Below are give a few of the Presi
dents recomendation to Congress as
given n his late message.
URGKS action on trusts.
"In my last annual message to
the Congress I call attention to the
necessity for early action to remedy
such evils as might be found to ex
ist in connection with the combi
nations of capital organized into
trusts, and again invite attention to
my discussion of the subject at that
time, which concluded with these
words:
"It is apparent that uniformity
oflegislation upon this subject in
the several states is much to be de
sired, it is to be hoped that such
uniformity, founded in a wise and
just discrimination between what
is injurious and what is useful and
necessary in business operations
may be obtained, and that means
may be found for Congress, within
the limitations of it constitutional
power, so to supplement an effective
code of state legislation as to make
a complete system of laws through
out the United States adequate to
compel a general observance of the
salutory rules to which I have re
ferred."
"The whole question is so im
portant and far reaching that I am
sure no part of it will be lightly con
sidered, but every phase of it will
have to be made the subject of de
liberation of Congress', resulting in
wise and judicious action.
•'Restraint upon such combin
ations as are injurious and which
are within federal jurisdiction,
should be promptly applied by the
Congress.
FOREIGN trade IMMENSE.
"Our foreign trade shows a re
markable record of commercial and
industrial progress. The total of
imports and exports for the first
time in the history of our country
exceeds $2,000,000,000. The ex
ports are greater then they have ev
er been before, the total for the fis
cal year 1900 being $1 ,394,483,082,
an increase over 1899 of $167,459,
780, an increase over 1898 of $163,
000,752: over 1897 of $343,489,526,
and greater than 1896 by $511,876,
144.
"The growth of manufactures in
the United States is evidenced by
the fact that exports of manfactur
ed products largely exceed those of
any previous year, their value for
1900 being $433,851,756, against
$339-562,146, in 1899 an increase
°f 28 per cent.'
"Agricultural products were also
exported during 1900 in greater
volume than in 1898, the total for
the year being $835,858^23,
against $784,776,142 in 1899,
The imports for the year amount
^ to $849,841,184, an increase ov
er 1899 of $152,792,695. This in
crease is largely in materials for
manufacture and is in response to
the rapid development of manufact
u »ng in the United States. While
ere was imported for use in man
ufactures 1900 material to the value
$79i768, 972 in excess of 1899 it
js reassuring to observe that there
is tendency toward decrease in the
Portation of articles manufactur
ed ready for consumption which in
•900 formed 15.17 per cent of the
total imports against 15.14 per cent
m 1899, and 21.09 per cent i° 1896.
urges cut in war revenue.
I recomend that the congress in
session reduce the internal revenue
tox imposed to meet the expenses
the war with Spain in the sum
$3 .000,000. This reduction
should be secured by the remission
these taxes which experiance
35 s hone to be the most burden
^We to the industries of the peo
ple.
I especially urge, that there be
deluded in whatever reduction is
Bla ^e the legacy tax on bequests
for public uses of a literary, edu
cational or charitable character.
warns against extravagance.
In our great prosperity we must
guard against the danger it invites
in extravagance in government ex
penditures and appropriations, and
the chosen representatives of the
people will, I doubt not, furnish ex
ample in their legislation of that
wise economy in which in a season
of plenty husbands for the future.
In this era of great business activi
ty and opportunity caution is not
untimely. It will not abate, but
strengthen our confidence. It will
not retard, but promote legitimate
industrial and commercial expan
sion. Our growing power brings
with it temtatious and perils requir
ing constant vigilance to avoid. It
must not be used to invite conflicts
or oppression, but fur the more
effective maintenance of those prin
ciples of equality and justice upon
which our .institutions depend. I v et
us keep always in mind that the
foundation of our government is
liberty, its superstructure peace.
URGES PACIFIC CABLE.
"I renew the recommendation
made in my special message of Feb.
10, 1899, as to the necessity for ca
ble communications between U. S .
and Hawaii, with extension to Ma
nila. Since then circumstances
have strikingly emphasized this
need. Surveys have shown the en
tire feasibillity of a chain of cables
which at each stopping place shall
touch 011 American territory, so
that the system shall be under our
own complete control. Manila once
within telegraphic reach, connec
tion with the systens of the Asiatic
coast would be increased, and profit
able opportunities for a more direct
route from our shores to the Orient
than is now afforded by the trans
Atlantic, continental and trans
Asiatic lines. I urge attention to
this important matter.
(Continued to 2d Page.)
ISTHMIAN CANAL.
As respects the trans-Isthmian
ship canal, the full report of the
Walker Commission is going to be
available for the guidance of Con
gress. Probably the commission will
take the ground that it would be
practicable to build the Panama
Canal, but that for the purposes of
the United States the Nicargaua
route would be preferable. American
sentiment, so far as it now has been
formed, is clearly in favor of the
Nicraagua route. The public is also
in favor of the ownership of the
canal by the United States Govern
ment and its construction out of the
national treasury. Let us hope that
the opinion will prevail that it is
neither dignified nor safe for the
sovereign government of the United
States to construct a great public
work like this canal upon alien soil.
Whatever the initial difficulties may
be, the one simple and clear solution
of all questions involved in the future
control 'of the canal lies in the ac
quisition by our government of full
sovereignity over such a strip of land
as may be needed for canal purposes.
We have made some annexations of
territory under President McKin
ley's administration, but none that
could be compared in importance
with the annexation of the requisite
strip of territory in Central Ameri
ca. Sooner or lator such annexa
tion is bound to come; audit will be
much better to accomplish it in ad
vance of the construction of a costly
canal than to bring ic about by force
at some future period. To succeed
in such a piece of negotiation would
count for more, in the estimation of
future generations of Americans,
than any other of the diplomatic
achievements of Mr. McKinley -

IRRIGATION CONGRESS NOTES
The telegram sent by the Na
tional Irrigation Congress at Chi
cago, urging upon President Mc
Kinley the importance of the irri
gation and forestry problem and re
questing him to in turn urge upon
Congress the advisability of some
definite action, has done more to
direct public attention to these im
portant national questions than any
other one thing. The telegram
was as follows:
To the President: The ninth an
nual session of the National Irri
gation Congress now in session in
the City of Chicago, respectfully
urges that in your niessage to Con
gress you call attention to the na
tional importance of the preserva
tion of our forests and of the exten
tiou and conservative use of the
forest preserves, and further that
you emphasize the need of national
action to store the flood waters that
now go to waste.
"Save the Forests and Store the
Floods" proved a popular motto at
the Chicago Irrigation Congress.
Its sessions bore a marked atmos
phere of thoughtful consideration
of how these great objects could be
accomplished and a general spirit
of harmony and co-operation per
vaded the atmosphere. Much sat
isfaction was expressed at the
growth of the national irrigation
sentiment in the East and the in
terest and active co-operation af
forded by eastern business men.
Great as is Chicago, with her
people equaling in numbers a third
of the entire population of the
western half of the United States,
yet the National Irrigation Con
gress was recognized as the expon
ent of a national movement, and
caused no little local and general
comment. Chicago newspapers de
voted their columns to its meetings
and Chicago's largest business men
attended them. The great prob
lem of the reclamation of the mill
ions of arid acres was recognized at
its true value and the incalculable
benefits to result, appreciated. The
national standing of the national
irrigation question is an assured
fact.
The following resolutions were
adopted by the Congress:
"We hail with satisfaction the
fact that both of the great political
parties of the nation in the last
campaign declared in favor of the
reclamation of arid America, in or
der that settlers might build homes
on the public domain, and to that
end we urge upon Congress that
national appropriations commensur
ate with the magnitude of the
problem should be made for the
preservation of the forests and the
reforestation of denuded areas as
natural storage reservoirs and for
the construction by the National
Government as part of its policy of
internal improvement of storage
reservoirs and other works for
flood protection and to save for use
in aid of navigation and irrigation
the waters which now run to waste
and for the development of artesian
and subterranean sources of water
supply.
"The waters of all Streams should
forever remain subject to public
control and the right of the use of
water for irrigation should inhere
in the land irrigated, and beneficial
use be the basis of measure and the
limit of the right.
"The work of building the reser
voirs necessary to store the floods
should be done directly by the gov
ernment under existing statutes re
lating to the employment of labor
and hours of work and under laws
that will give to all American citi
zens a free and equal opportunity
to get first employment, and then a
home on the land.
"We commend the efficient work
of the various bureaus of the na
tional government in the investiga
tion of the physical and legal prob
lems and other conditions relating
to irrigation and in promoting the
adoption of more effective laws,
customs and methods of irrigated
agriculture, and urge upon Con
gress the necessity of providing
liberal appropriations for this im
portant work."
The holding of the National Ir
rigation Congress in the East, as it
turned out was a wise move. The
people of that half of the country
have had the subject of national
irrigation brought home to them in
a manner not otherwise possible.
The far-reaching importance of the
problem has been presented to
them and a genuine interest has
been awakened. Instead of find
ing opposition in the East, the Con
gress found that eastern men of
prominence were more than inter
ested in a proposition which prom
ised an increased western popula
tion of millions of people.
As the "enemy's country" has
been invaded, the myth of eastern
opposition has faded away and its
people are found to be anxious to
see inaugurated a national policy of
western arid land reclamation.
The western delegates went home
with the feeling that they have the
hearty support of eastern interests
in securing action which will open
to settlement half a continent, cap
able of supporting fifty millions of
people. They cannot but feel that
this support is growing; that it is
developing into a great movement;
that many people are realizing that
national action would meet such a
western development as would in
crease the national wealth beyond
measure.
The time seems fully ripe for the
west to take a firm and decided
stand on the question of national
irrigation and something great may
be accomplished at once. Why
not? It is as right that Congress
should appropriate money for stor
age reservoirs as for river and har
bor improvements. The building
of storage reservoirs would obviate
the necessity for much river ex
penditure and would be vastly in
creased. And now if the West
makes this demand the East will
back it up, for the benefit would
not be local.
Every western paper is interested
in seeing this development accom
plished. What would be the re
sult of an appropriation of eight or
ten million dollars spent annually
in the west for irrigation construc
tion? The immediate stimulation
would be enormous and the future
benefit greater. This policy should
be inaugurated and the western
press should urge it with one voice.
It is a national matter; it can be
productive only of great good; the
East is responsive; will the West
be aggressive; it is time to work.
It is the opinion at Washington
that $40,000,000 will be appropri
ated by this congress for
river and harbor improve
ments. Of this the western half of
the United States will get, judging
by previous records a couple of
million or so. Whatever are her
possibilities, it is not contended
that the West is as important or in
fluential as the East. She has not
yet the dense population; but why
should she not get at least a share
of this great appropriation? Why
should she not get a fourth of it, to
be applied to the building of great
storage reservoirs to be filled with
flood waters for use in irrigation, un
der a system of internal improve
ments?
The government is spending
large sums in aiding In the devel
opment of foreign trade and the op
ening of foreign markets for Amer
ican manufacturers. It is believed
that we should push out goods into
every market of the world and sell
them. The belief is also gaining
ground that the government should
also develop its home market for
American products and manufac
turers. This it could do by re
claiming the 75,000,000 acres of
western arid land and settling them
with thousands of industrious home
builders. Eastern merchants are
more than willing to see such an
undertaking. The west should
take the initiative. S. H. M.
PREJUDICES, GOOD AND BAD.
All men and women are guided
by their prejudices. They could
not be safe without their guidance.
They could not even live in the
world of active life unless they
were at every point protected by
prejudices which warn them against
things that are dangerous or disa
greeable, and invite them to those
that are useful and pleasant. The
majority of all these prejudices are
protective. They are the labor
saving contrivances by which the
results of experience are compacted
into likes and dislikes, and handed
down from generation to genera
tion. Children note the gestures,
tones, and expressions of their eld
ers and companions, and are quick
to interpret the signals of safety
or of danger. Long before they
think for themselves, they have
been provided with a set of preju
dices which warn them not to eat
certain kinds of food, not to trust
all animals and vagrant men, not to
depart far on either side from the
ways of their parents and house
hold companions.
But there comes a time when, by
common consent, reason should
take the place of prejudice. After
wisely avoiding things that might
be injurious, but which there was
not time to examine, it is well to
test the prejudices that have been
handed down from father to son
and from mother to daughter, and
especially those stronger impres
sions made by the father upon his
daughters and the mother upon
her sons. It is the mark of educa
tion and a sign of culture to revise
one's prejudices, to strengthen
those that are rational, and lay
aside those that have lost their
meaning and are 110 longer useful.
But, if one puts away too many
prejudices or does it too quickly,
he may find himself defenseless in a
dangerous world. Like the stag
when its horns are in the velvet, he
will be unfit for the rude contests of
life. Like the crab who has put off
his shell, he must hide himself in a
corner until his armor grows again.
They who have no prejudices com
monly have no country, no home,
and no religion. No one can guide
his own steps at every moment.
When any one has revised his old
prejudices and discarded the habits
that enforced them, he must put his
new conclusions into a new set of
prejudices, he must begin to make
a new set of habits, and trust him
self once more to his impulses.
Of all contests, prejudices are al
most necessarily a part. Even in a
war that seems to be just and nec
essary, wise men know that on
both sides are men of good princi
ples and good character. If they
think the war is necessary knd
just, they know that, for the sake
of some righteous end to be attain
ed, even those who represent the
good cause must, for the most part,
fight under a delusion concerning
the nature of their opponents. The
multitude who are to do the fight
ing must believe that over against
them are enemies whose thoughts
are evil, whose purposes are unjust,
whose punishment is deserved. To
strike swiftly and to strike hard re
quires not only courage, but a be
lief that the enemy deserves to be
overthrown.
In theological controversies, as
in political strife, the same rule
holds. Progress toward the knowl
edge of the truth and the practice
of justice has often come out of
contentions which could not have
been if the contending parties had
known each other as they were.
While the fight was on, prejudices
on both sides that were blind, irra
tional, and even cruel, were needed
and were useful. The harm comes
when the prejudice survives its use
fulness and persists, when a better
acquaintance would put an end to
it. All the world is being thrown
together, tumbled together indeed,
in these opening days of civiliza
tion. Everybody is beginning to
know everybody; and the cheering
fact is that, the better everybody
becomes acquainted with his neigh
bors, the more he is willing to trust
them.
It is amusing sometimes to see
the chance acquaintance of two
persons who had been divided by
politics or religion open into friend
ship, to see them compare notes
and confess to each other the preju
dices concerning people of their re
spective classes which they had
cherished and acted upon as if they
were fundamental principles of pa
triotism and religion. That even
the devil is not as black as he is
painted is a judgment which indi
cates the discovery that the devil
himself is only a type of human
character, and, like all products of
human nature, never wholly bad or
wholly past the mending. And
yet he who loses all prejudice
against the devil is more likely to
produce the products of iniquity
than the fruits of righteousness.
The principal uses of education,
whether in school or in church, are
to estabjish prejudices against ev
erything destructive, ugly and
shameful, and in favor of every
thing useful, helpful, and beautiful.
We have reached the stage in the
progress of civilization when nearly
all the defensive prejudices of poli
tics and religion can be laid aside.
It is no longer necessary to identify
the supporters of injurious princi
ples with the principles themselves,
and to say that the bad cause must
be supported by bad people. It has
become safe to discriminate between
the nature of a cause and the per
sonal character of its supporters.
We shall get a long way on the
road to the kingdom of heaven
when men of opposing beliefs can
travel in peace together, while still
they put all their strength into the
expulsion of evil and the search for
truth.— Christian Register.
Stage Tipped Over.
Yesterday afternoon the in-com.
ing stage from Murphy tipped over
just below the Paul ranch, on Sink
er, spilling the occupants and bruis
ing them up more or less. Victor
Showalter, a miner from Panquist
Utah, had his left shoulder dislo
cated and was bruised over both
shoulders. The other passengers
were; Mrs. Morrison and child,
Harry Sullivan, Wm. D. Hay
wood, Mr. Bond and Sam Katz.
Mrs. Morrison recieved a black eye.
Dr. Meyer went out and brought
in Mr. Showalter. His injuries
are not considered serious.
The accident is said to have been
caused by one of the horses falling
down, which throwed a wheel
against the bank and overturned
the coach.— Avalcnche.
Idaho's New Code.
The legislature is going to have
an immense amount of work on its
hands if it gives proper consider
ation to the code that has been pre
pared since- the last session. It
cannot afford to waste time on other
snbjects—or rather the people can
not afford to have the time wasted.
Members with bills in their pockets
that they desire to get through will
have to bear in mind that the ses
sion must begin with work and end
with work if all is to be accomp
lished that they hoped for.—Boise
Statesman.
