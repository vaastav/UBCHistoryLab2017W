An exploring patty sent oat by the-General
Court of MaMRchnsotts Bay Colony
in 1636 reported that the interior of the
country was "most desolate," and that to
extend settlement more than twenty miles
from the coast would t useless, a the
land was "rocky and like the desert." This
scarecrow of the desert has always stood
in the way of the westward movement of
population. The adult reader of thia will
remember that his school geography put
the limit of the agricultural area at the
Mississippi Hirer; all beyond was the
"Great American Desert, and,lhnn
(rave'ed citizen of the East has not un
learned this lesson of his youth. Cro3K
ing the Mississippi and then the MisHonri,
the advance guard of civilization found,
not the desert, but gransy meadow. lands
and wide fields where natura in
the remote past had, with its massive
harrow of ice, pulverized the rock
info soilsvperfeitHutchomical proportions
for the gtovth of vegetation. Everywhere
the plowshare moved through the soil like
the keel through the water, and countless
acres were added to the food-producing
area of the, republic. The discovery of
these ; unfilled, rleldsi the gardens of the
desert, settled the question of more and
better toe it and bread for the hungry mil
lions of dearth. New appliances were
needed upon land where the plo-v could
move iot nines; wunoui, meeting aa uu-
fctacle, and so the gang plow was invented
audeubBtituted for the single obe. Row
ing grain by hand was too alow, and so the
seouing macmne was caned mlo use. The
s'ckle, the scythe and the cradle disap
peared be 'ore the reaper and mower, and
I he latter in turn went down before
the self-binding harvester, and the
steam thresher naturally followed,
capable of doiDtr the wo:k of " an
army of men with' flails. The cramped
valleys of the East would never have de
veloped the labor-saving implements now
in uko upon the Western prairies, where
the inttl'ects of the tons have been quick

pool wator onl healthy food develop the
highest types of physical life. It is the
vigor born of frost that makes tho cor;h
tempera'e zone the only one of importance
in the world. Between the 40th ond ;0th
parallels of north latitude in the United
Htates will be found the largest cities, the
Kreat est wealth, the finest hta'th'coudi
tionc, the most enterprising people and
the idest diffusion of intelligence and
comfort in the world. The center of
this belt of r owcr is Minnesota and Da
kota, where not only the best wheat is
grown but the best flour is made. Under
the old grinding piocets winter wheat w as
considered the best, but since the flour
made of Dakota spring wheat his become
n favorite among bakers nil over the wo Id
there ha been much speculation why
this wheat, which h ro.rdyfor the thresher
in four months from the planting, has its
peculiar hard quality nud makes flour of
hucIi strength and purity as to give the
baker 250 pounds of nutiitious bread from
a 196-pound barrel of flour, or 2.1 to 30
moi-e loaves than he can get from an equ il
amount of the winter wheat product. The
conclusion of scientific investigation is
that the lo.ig and cont nuous sunlight in
the pure air of the Northwest is the im
portant factor in not only perfecting the
w heat but all the other cereal crops. The
valley of the Ited ltiver of the North is tho
most productive grain-growing te:tion of
the country. liayard Taylor called it
the Nile of America. Seven connties on
the Dakota side in 1887 pioduced 23,000,
000 bushels of wheat, 11,000,000 bushels
of oats, and. 2,000,000 bushels1 of barley.
The entire wheat crop of the United
States could be grown in Dakota and then
Jeave enough land to produce all the other
prineipil ctops of the .Union. A large
part of Dako'a is still unoccupied. It

as Belgium.
Few persons realize the immense size
of the Territories along the northern
bonudary of the Republic Dakota, Mon
tana, Idaho and Washington, each an em
pire in area and wonderf ol in variety of
resources of field, forest and mine. - Any
one of these four Territories is larger than
all of New England, and far more richly
endowed by nature. Tho continuous line
of settloment to the Faciflo is to be
through these sopa to be Northwestern
States, the conditions being against con
stant growth along any other ronto across
the continent. Tho altitude of the valleys
and table lands in the highest section
of this northern route, Montana, is on an
average 2,200 feet lawer than the plaint of
"Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah, the North

the key that retains wealth in a comma -nity.
Examine these Territories on this
bvpothesis. Thoy have countless acres
of timber, mineral, giazing and' fanning
land. . The land will produce all that is
needed for the support of human and ani
mal life. The forests comprise every va
riety of wood necessnry for the wants of a
ripe civilization. . In the mountains,
crowned with for3ts and enlivened with
cooling streams, ara to be found nearly
very precious and base metal known fo
man; all the metallic and mineral earths

and elements used in medicine, chenra
try, farming, or the arts, either exist aa
natural productions or can bo pro
duced. A single county in Northern
Idaho, with four years of development,
is producing a quarter of the entire leal
output of the Union. In seemiDg com
pensation for roughness a few acres of
mountain land in n rich district will g'.ve
employment to a large population and
produce more treasure than many thousand
acres of farm land. A trip through this
tort hern region is one of surprising inter

claimant is asking a place among the grain

where European vessels come for tho
wheat of Washington Territory. - This
Pacific coast wheat, while cot
hard like that of Dakota, is larger

WPMA'S REVENUE. '
In the last 'annual report it was estimated
that the revenues for the year to end June
80, 1888. would exceed the ordinary expend
ditures, not including the sinking fund,
$113,000,000. It will be seen from the forego
ing statement that such excels was in reali
ty $1.9,612,116.09, or $6,413,110.09 more
than the department estimate." It was also
estimated in the aam report that the like
surplus for tlie fiscal year to end June 80,
1880, would le 104,313,365.44. Judging
from the actual expenditures for the first
quarter of this fiscal yvnr, and in the light
of receipt! and expenditures to the middle
of November, it is probable that this esti-
mate will prove to have been fairly accit'
rate, and that the surplu will almost exact
ly equal the predicted Mini, , - i
The accumulated surplus on Sept. 29,
1888, was $96,444,845.84; the surplus reve
nues from that date to June 80, 1889, af
estimated, are $85,5105,208.2.'), making the
total accumulation on' June 30, 1889, which
coiild be used in the purchase of bonds.
$171,810,054.09; however, between said
Sept. 29 and Nov. 23 $4 4, H99, 509. 50 has
been paid for bonds; consequently, if no
more bonds were bought between now and
June 30 next the surplus would then
amount to $127,000,000. Upon the basis
of appropriations recommended by the de
partment, and upon the assumption that the
revenues of the fiscal years to end June 80,
1889 and 1890, will be equal, the surplus
revenues for the latter 4cal year will be
$101,000,000, which, with the surplus reve
nues of this year and the surplus already
accumulated, make a total of $228,0()0,00('v
which might ' be used during the next nine
teen months in the purchase of the interest
t earing debt, and which ought to be used
for that purpose unless the laws are to
changed as to reduce the difference between
expenditures and revenue by nearly that
sum.
About $188,000,000 of the 4J per cent
bonds are now outstanding; they are pay
able Sept. 1, 1891. The total amount of
interest which will accrue on them from
now until their maturity is in rounu
numbers . $25,000,000; consequently the
present surplus and the surplus which will
probably accrue before July 1, 1890, will
suffice to pay the principal of those bond?
and all the interest which would accrue
uKm them should they be permitted to re
main unpaid until their maturity.
The principal of the 4 per cent boudx is
now $680,000,000, and the interest w hich
could accrue upon them until their ma
turity in 1907 U about $500,000,000; Aal
culati m will show that the present surplus
revenue, if continued, would pay tefore
1900 all of the 4 kt cent bonds and all of
this interest. Of course all the money
which is saved by the purchase bonds less
than the principal and the interest to ac
crue but shorten) the time when all the
bonds may he paid if the holders will sur
render them. ,
Nothing more is needed than the fore-"
going statement to show the absolute
necessity of a readjustment of the publio
revenue.) at the earliest ossible date. To
continue taxation with no other use for its
proceeds than such an investment is a cruel
waste of the eoples money. '
PI BCHASK OK BO.XPH. .
ijinee the last annual retort, and after
the completion of the sinking-fund require
ment for the yrar ended June 80, 1888, no
tiond were I ought until there
had been ail expression of opinion
by ' resolution in both house of
Congress that it was lawful and proper to
invest the surplus in bonds necessary to
obtain them. The purchase was resumed
under a circular of April 17, 1888, and since
that time nearly all the !onds which have
been offered for sale to the government
have been bought by it Ninety -four mill
ions of dollars of lionds have len stnnired
under this circular and a premium paid for
the privilege of buying them of altont
$18,tKX),000; the net rate of interest realized
from this investment is only aliout 2 per
cent and the paving in the total amount of
interest which would have leen paid
had the bonds been allowed to
run to maturity is about $27,000,000.
Had taxation Iteen reduced so as to leave
this money with tin people, and if it is
worth in their businets K p?r cent per an
num, the total value of . the money to them
during the term which these bonds had to
run would bo about $83,000,000; thus there
is a resulting loss to tho peopld of $56,000, -KX)
upon this transaction alone; if this
overtaxation is not stopped, and if the gov
ernment is forced to continue t4 be a pur
chaser, of ita own bonds at the holder's
pricei, the loss to the eople, as could be
shown by a like calculation, must lie hun
dreds of millions of dollars.
REDCCTIOX OK TAXATION. '
I cannot too strongly repeat my recom
mendation of )ast year to reduce taxation,'
and as far as jxsdble, without too sudden
disturbance of existing interests, to make
this.' reduction in customs taxation, to the
end that the people may get the greatest
possible benefit from the reduction.

Opinions of Indiana Veterans on the Re
volt In the Grand Army of the Repub
lic. Indianapolis (Ind.) telegram.
The so-called split In the Grand Army of
the Kcpublic. which originated ".here, con
tinues an uppermost theme in veteran rir'
cles and with the local press. That the
movement has been greatly exaggerated by
the F astern press, is admitted on all sides.
Tho .'ren ing Sena (Independent) says that
the . organization of Democratic soldlera
U so far of less importance .than it has
been made to appear, and charges that
the reports regarding It ure based
upon information emanating from Adju
tant General Koontz. Inquiries among
Democrats who belong to the O. A. It.,
demonstrate that very few ot them aro in
sympathy with the movement, and do not
indorse the assertions of Gen. Koontz in
saying that politics has been introduced
In the order. Major Irvin , lloblns. one of
the ex-commanders of George II. Thomas
Tost, who was probably more prominent In
organizing Democratic, soldiers during tho
campuign than any other man In tho party,
is not a member of tho association formed
by Adjt Gen. Koontz, having declined to
join it. There are many other Democratic
ex-soldlers of prominence who do not
belong to the organization, among
them Governor Gray, CoL Zollin
ger, Maj. Mitchell and others. Maj.
Mitchell, who is a prominent Democrat and
Prosecuting Attorney for Marion County,
fipeaklngof the matter-, said: "As a member
of tho U. A. II.. I can say that during all the
time I have belonged to George 11. Thomas
Tost politics never at any time, in any
t?hape. manner, or form, entered Into the
work of the post, any more than politics
maybe Introduced into church organiza
tions. It cannot be made any more of a
political organization than the order of Ma
nons, Odd Fellows, or Knights of Pythias."
Colonel I. N. Walker, Assistant Adjutant
General of tho G. A. It., Department of In
diana, sent the following pointed statement
to the Associated Tress:
"I wHnt to enter a protest against tho
statements and interviews published, es
pecially in the Eastern press; about ,a do
lection among the comrades of tho G. A. It.
in this department. Nothing ot the kind
has occurred, and tho membership was
never more united and enthusiastic in their
support of the order than now. Tho hand
ful of disappointed office-seekers here that
have succeedod In getting themselves ad
veitisod throughout tho country have no.
standing, and nover had, in the G. A. 11.,
or out of It, for that matter. The whole
business has been engineered by halt a
dozen chronics, and at no . meeting have
they been able to secure, the attendance of
fifty persons, und not to exceed half these
have ever leen members of the G. A. It. No
Democrat of standing or Influence in this
community, who Is a member ot the G. A. R.,
can Ik? found opposing the order. J()n the
contrary, scores ot comrades of that politi
cal faith have personally and by letter de
nounced the uttempt of these small-fry
politicians. The Department of Indiana Is
all right."
