TWO PARENT STATES.
RECMLING an earlier stage of the Irish nego
tiations when the British attitude was less
liberal, Lord Birkenhead says:
"One of the Irish delegates said across tlie
conference table:
"You cannot quite dismiss us and our
claims and our history in that wny. Wc, too,
arc an ancient parent state, and we have
through tho centuries flung our sons nnd
our settlers Into every comer of tho habitable,
civilized globe.'
"That claim Is true. That claim has modi
fied tho fundamental view which' wo have
I adopted and by which wo stand."
Nothing could be more significant of the cliangc
In British sentiment and of the spirit in which
. broad-minded Englishmen .are now welcoming the
agreement.
That spirit is and should continue to be com
plete confutation of the Carson view that (he day
that sees the creation of an Irish Free State is a
day of "abject humiliation for Great Britain."
The conference scene which Lord Birkenhead
'describes deserves to stand out and be remem
bered as a historic turning point in the long course
of misunderstanding, clumsiness nnd cross-purpose
which have kept the nerves of the Irish on edge.
It was Edmund Burke who said:
"England and Ireland may flourish to
gether. The world .Is large enough for us
both. Let It be our earn not to mako our
selves too little Tor it."
It has taken Britons centuries to grasp the Irish
point of view. But now they have grasped it, lie
Is a small man Biiton or Irishman who sneer
at the result
Justice Daniel F. Cohnlau of the Friends of
Irish Freedom calls the IrlRh agreement "a
diplomatic triumph for Lloyd George dex
terous rather than solid.1'
Who are the true friends of Ireland? At
last wo have u test.
STEP BY STFP.
WHAT appears to be a trustworthy report that
Japan has accepted the 5-5-3 naval ratio
and approved the' proposed four-power treaty for
.the peaceful settlement of differences in the, Pacific
brings further substantial cheer to offset rumors of
protest arid resignations in the Chinese delegation.
It is said Japai wiH expect certain concessions re
garding naval bases in the Pacific. That is possible.
-Nevertheless, nobody has forgotten that the 5-5-3
'naval ratio represented and still represents the funda-v
mental, backbone purpose of this Conference on the
Limitation of Armament.
With that purpose realized and riveted, the- rest
will be so much the easier.
Another thing nobody has forgotten is what
openness and publicity did for the 5-5-3 naval re
duction plan. Why isn't the Washington Confer
ence leaving more doors open and getting from pub
lic opinion some of the power it evoked in the
beginning?
A FADED VISION.
SPEAKING to his fellow-Americans on Oct. 29,
1920, from Akron, Mr. Harding said:
"If I am going to servo you, I want the
Government to have tho machinery with
jwhich to serve, and 1 promise you that under
Republican administration the Congress is
coins to resume Its constitutional functions. v
It la very Important to have a majority in
the United States Senate, and you ought al
ways to think of the Senate aa saving to
you your American liberty.
"I think wo would have succeeded this year
In harmonizing tho Senate Into a completely
useful agent if it had not been for tho Inter
ference of th,o Chief Executive, who was not
satisfied with running his own end of Penn
sylvania Avenue."
President Harding's message of last Tuesday
read like anything but the happy congratulations
of a Chief Executive delighted with Uie way Con
gress has been performing its constitutional func
tions under his harmonizing spell.
The message was more like a piteous plaint:
Why won't a party behave like a party when
H.gets into power?
DOUBLY A HERO.
WE HAVE it on the authority of Gens. Per
shing and Foch that Alvin York is the
greatest hero of the war.
Also the Bible tells us:
"Ha that ruleth bis spirit is better than
be that taketh a city."
This last test Alvin York has passed with flying
colors. He had offers of a fortune If he would go
iato vaudeville or motion pictures and capitalize
his reputation.
He sincerely believed such a course would be
wrong and he stuck to his beliefs.
, yMwyrnay not, agree with his conception of
miration for the sturdy diaracter behind Uie
refusal?
Alvin York is a hero in peace no less than In
war. He is an example to his fellows. The 'fund
being raised by The World to make Alvin York
secure in the possession of his farm and to aid
him in the foundation of a school for the moun
taineers of his home neighborhood is a worthy
effort and deserves wide support.
IT NEEDS DEFINING.
A NY ONE who read President Harding's mes-
sage could have pretty accurately foretold
what Samuel Gompers would have to say about it.
It is easier to criticise Mr. Gompers's attack than
Jo formulate a constructive criticism of President
Harding's suggestions looking toward an industrial
court.
When Mr. Gompers takes the bare outline Pres
ident Harding sketched and likens it to the Court
of Quarter Sessions -loo years ago, he talks non
sense. That court was set up by a ruling aristoc
racy. Laborers at that time had no voice in gov
ernment. A labor court to-day, even if it had
summary powers, would be a creature of the law
and could be displaced whenever the majority so
decided.
Mr. Gompers may be right in jwinting out the
failure of industrial courts in Australia and New
Zealand, also the troubled situation in Kansas. No
one who has any understanding of the problem
expels perfection in the new field of industrial
legislation. Trial and error are the only school for
democratic advance.
President Harding was also unfortunate either
in choice of words or in thought when he spoke of
"a code and a charter of elemental rights." In
another passage- he speaks of a "code of practice."
That too would boar further definition. "Code
of procedure" would have given less cause for
uneasiness.
Certainly the last thing any sane person would
propose would be a "code" in the Napoleonic sense,
laying down hard and fast statutes to guide an in
dustrial court. '
Mr. Gompers assumes that the court suggested
by the President would "determine the conditions
and wages of the working people."
This country could have no greater calamity
than a statute defining, for example, "the standard
of living," or prescribing the workday. No mod
ern nation, least of all the United States, would
toleraje, a denial of the right to cease working at
the termination of a working contract. Nor would
it even deny the right to strike, except in occupa
tions upon which depend public health and safety.
There does seem to be a broad field for an
industrial court with a suspensive veto on strikes
and a code of procedure which would prevent
strikes until the court had heard the questions at
issue and passed judgment.
Tho former German Bmporor has published
g. book of comparntlvo historical tables. Tho
comparisons stop short at 1014. After that
they would be too, odorous.
IN DUTY BOUND.
DR. COPELAND is to be thanked for the label
he applied to many of those who have sought
to hamper the work of Dr. Adolf Lorenz.
Dr. Copeland called them "damn fools." That
is good enough except for the particular few who
would be better described as "knaves."
There may have been mistakes in the manage
ment of the visit of Dr. Lorenz. There is no rea
son for the aspersions cast on his personal ability
or good intentions.
Yesterday Dr. Lorenz feared he could not con
tinue if the campaign of persecution by the medi
cal profession is not checked. It is time for. the
medical profession to perform a right-about-face.
It is highly probable that many of the slurs
oast on the Viennese surgeon do not fairly represent
the attitude of the' medical profession. The small
fry, consumed by professional jealousy, are prob
ably responsible.
But the more representative members of the
profession are in duty bound to make their voices
heard and so continue the mission of this Austrian
Ambassador of Mercy.

UNCOMMON SENSE
By John Blake
(Coprrtiku U:i. bj Jokn UUU.) ''
INSIDE AND OUT.
Men and women invoke the aid of barbers, beauty tloc
tors, tailors,' dressmakers, even surgeons, in un almost futile
effort to alter their outward appearance.
On this effort, whose success would be really unim
portant, they spend millions of dollars every da'.
This money is not wasted. Appearance counts for a
great deal. A well dressed, clean shaven man bus a better
chance of securing a good position than a slovenly, ill chid
man.
The straightening of a pair of cross eyes, the improve
ment of a badvset of teeth, is worth the considerable sum of
money that it costs.
Yetwe really cannot change our outward appearance a
groat deal.
So alike are wc in features that at best we enn make
but insignificant modifications.
To a Caucasiun nil Chinese look very much alike. A
Chinese regards all Caucasians as cast in the same mould.
The money we spend on exterior improvements, ;v.!iile
well spent, docs not accomplish ns much as we would wish
else all of us would be handsome.
This brings us to INTERIOR differences, which are of
vastly greater importance and capable of far greater chances.
It is what is inside of your head that keeps your position,
once your good looks or good manners have secured it.
It is the difference in the unseen recesses of your brain
that brings you promotion or fortune or security or independ
ence, which the far better looking man at the next desk will
never enjoy.
It is something unseen inside the head of the boss that
is different from something equally unseen insidethe hend of
the employee that makes one a boss and the other an em
ployee. - And these are differences that expenditures of time und
effort, which are the equivalent of money, can change pro
digiously. '
Continue to do all you can. to better your outward ap
pearance, to make as little as possible the exterior difference
between you and th'c Adonis or the Venus whom you admin-.
At the same time toil with even more diligence to make
lesss noticeable the inside difference between you and the
man who is making twice ns much money or becoming twice
as distinguished in his profession or business.
The inside of your head is something you can chutiire,
and change vastly for the better. Give your best effort to
that. For it is what is behind your forehead that is going to
win for you ir. the end.

XI. LEOPOLD DAMROSCH.
No Individual has dono moro to de
velop tho musical tasto of tho Ameri
can people to supply them with a
medium of high enjoyment than
Leopold Damrosch.
This Jewish contribution to the
building of America was bora in
I'osen (now rovcrtlng to its Polish
nuino of fosnan) in 1532. Ho became
a great musician in splto of his par
ents, who wcro set on making a phy
sician of him.
To pleaso his parents ho took tho
medical studies and obtained the de
gree ot doctor of mcdlclno at the
University of Ilcrlin. But It was to
the violin and thorough Bass that he
dovotod himself, with tho medical
profcsslon'as u mask.
At "Weimar he was cordially re
ceived by Liszt, who inu.de him solo
violinist In tho ducal orchestra. To
him Liszt dedicated his "La Trlom
pho Funcbro do Tasse," und only two
other mnstors of niualc Wagner and
Uerlloz were similarly honored with
a. dedication by tho great Hungarian.
To a German musical organization,
the Ariou Society, music lovers in
America owe this commanding figure
in our musical life. Dumrosch hud
achieved a Europoun reputation aa a
conductor of tho Symphoniu Hoclotj
in Ureslau when tho Arlon Society
invited him to Now York lu 1871.
His iirst appearance as conductor,
composer and violinist in tho old
Stelnway Hall on .May ii, 1371, im
pressed and delighted tho musical
ollto of Now York. Ho at ouce be
came tho centre and impulse of musi
cal activity in America.
As founder ot tho Oratorio Soclol)
In 1873 and as one of tho prlmu mov
ers of tho organization ot the Sym
phony Society In 1877, Leopold Dam
rosch did notable work in i-Mcudiug
the tasto for und appneiutluu of the
best music in Now York.
Damroach's great achievement In
that phase of his artistic activities
was tho musical festival which was
given in the spring of 1831 In tho 7th
Kegiment Armory. There was a cho
rus of 1,200 voices from tho Oratorio
Society, augmented by 1,000 women
from tho Normal College and 250 boys
from the church choirs. The audi
ences of from 8,000 to 10,000 at ail the
concerts sustained Damrosch's con
tention that New York was "musi
cal." Recognized by the conferring ot thr
degree of musical doctor by Columbia
University, Leopold Damrosch was
destined to justify that recognition
by a further und moro notablo
achievement.
That achievement began In 1881.
when Dr. Damroscn proposed an ex
periment In German opera to fio di
rectors of the Metropolitan Opera
House, then newly established.
It took the energetic impresario .
rnly a month to engage a company,
to organize It and to open a series of
operatic performances that remain
a record In th . musical annals of New
k.
The most inuwrtant works trlven
were Wagner's "Tunnhaeusci1," "Lih
rngrln." "Die Walkucro" und Hect
hoven's "Fhlello." ,
Damrosch himself condu -ted every
performance, until a week before the
end of his life.
o
WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT WORD?
110. CHIEF.
The words "Chief" and "Captain"
do not apcar at first glance to hark
bafk to a common origin. In point of
fact, however, they are first cousins.
Their common ancestor is the Latin
word "caput" (head).
From this Latin word tho deriva
tion of "Captain" is easily evident.
Tho word "Captain" is used in almost
all tho European languages with
Blight variations.
Like "Captain," tho word "Chief"
means tho man at tho "head," or
"caput." Tho equivalent of "caput"
In Slavic is "glava" or "golova.'
From "glava" Is derived "glavatar,"
tho equivalent of "chief."
In tho Russian language tho worl
"glava" Is used to, designate a chief
Thus In all languages the word
"chief" Is traceable back to "head"
or "caput."
