WASHINGTON, D. C, DECEMBER 7, 1S62.
i
Tlie number of new subscribers to The Na
tional Tribune received during tlie week
ending December Gth, was 1,116. Between No
vember lltk and November 30th subscriptions
ware booked for 400 post offices, to which pre
viously no copy of The Tribune had been
sent. It now goes to S,ioO post offices.
The following is the number of pension
certificates issued and signed during the
week ending December Gth : Original, 592 ;
and all others, 49G; total, 1,0SS.
A strange commentary upon the opera
tions of a Government " for the peojde and
by the people " is found in the fact that two
Confederate cavalry leaders who figured
prominently in the fight near Brand' Sta
tion, described in the current number of the
Gettysburg campaign, now represent a sov
ereign State in the "United States Senate.
Commander-in-Chief Van Debvooet,
of the Grand Army of the Republic, writes
us from Headquarters, at Omaha, that he
has just returned from his tour of Ohio and
Indiana, and after visiting Kansas City
iGth and 7th insts.), will proceed to St.
Louis, thence to "West Virginia, and after
wards to "Washington, to attend the meeting
of the Pension Committee. This is what it
is to have a "live " man at the head of the
aErand Army.
The taxes on distilled spirits now in
Dond, and which arc not payable until the
spirits are taken out of bond, amount, it is
estimated, to about $70,000,000, or enough
to meet the requirements of the pending
Equalization of Bounties bill. If the excise
taxes are repealed, this immense sum of
money, which rightfully belongs to the
Government, will be surrendered to the
distillers it will be equivalent to making
a present of it to them. Arc our ex-soldiers
are the people generally willing to sanc
tion such a piece of folly and injustice? We
do not believe it
Commissioner Dudley's report of the
operations of the Pension Office shows that
at the close of tho fiscal year ending June
30th, 1832. there were 2S5.G07 pensioners,
classified as follows: Army invalids, 173,138;
army widows, minor children, and depend
ent relatives, 70,4-18 ; navy invalids, 2.3G1 ;
navy widows, minor children, and depend
ent relatives, 1,933; survivors of the war of
1812, 7,134 ; and widows of those who served
in that war, 24,GGL There were added to
the roll during the year the names of 27,GG4
new pensioners, and the names of G49 whose
pensions had previously been dropped, were
restored to the rolls, making an aggregate
inoreaee to the roll of 28,313. The names of
11,446 pensioners were dropped from the
rolls for various causes, leaving a net in
crease for the year of 10,867 pensioners. In
our next issue wo shall discuss the reporl of
the Commissioner at some length.
A comrade of Stanley Post, No. 11, of New
Britain, Conn., informs us that at a recent
meeting of the Post the Adjutant was in
structed by a vote of the members to receive
subscriptions to TnE National Tribune
and forward them to this office. This is an
example which we trust will be followed by
every Post in the country. It is an easy,
practical way of extending the circulation
of The Tribune, and certainly the good
work which it is doing for the Grand Army
calls for some substantial recognition on the
pirt of our comrades. They should all be
subscrilers to it.
The Tariff Commission, notwithstanding
the abuse heaped upon it by ill-informed
and spiteful newspapers, sent in its report
10 Congress on the first day of the session,
u:ucu to the chagrin of the Free Traders,
v,ho had been piophesying that nothing
would come of its investigations. .The re
poit is not only full and thorough in its
treament of the questions which the Com
mission was instructed to inquire into, but
clear ami practical in :ils recommendations
as io tariff revision, and it is certain to be
the basis of ell future legislation. The prin
cipal credit for this gratifying outcome of
the Comraisssion'H labors belongs, of course,
to its secretary, the Hon. Robert P. Porter.
Mr. Porter is now universally recognized as
the ablest statistician in the country, and it
is a significant proof of the esteem in which
he is held that the New York Tribune ha
engaged him at a handsome salary to pursue
his economic investigations in its interests
in any quarter of the globe that ho may
select, and by this time he is doubtless on
his way to Europe.
The President' IUcssaso.
Elsewhere in our columns, this week,
will be found a carefully prepared abstract
of the President's message, which in many
respects is ono of the ablest that has ever
beui transmitted io Congress. It is tersely
written and in its treatment of national ques
tions eminently practical. The President's
recommendations, with one or two excep
tions, command our hearty approval. Wc
aro glad that he has had the courage to
follow up his veto of the River and Harbor
bill with a strong indictment of omnibus
bills in general, and it is certainly to be
hoped that one of the two plaus which he
suggests with a view to putting an effectual
check upon congressional extravagance will
ultimately bo adopted. It is our own
opinion, as it also seems to be that of the
President, that nothing short of a constitu
tional amendment, empowering the Execu
tive to veto separate items of appropriation
bills, will answer tho purpose.
We also heartily concur with the Presi
dent in what ho has to say on the subject of
civil service reform and political assess
ments. It ought to be esteemed a privilege
on the part of those who are indebted for
the offices which they hold to party success
to contribute to the campaign fund of that
party, but they should not be subject to
removal for failing to do so. There is good
reason for believing that the manner in
which political assessments were levied dur
ing tho late congressional canvass was pro
ductive of much harm to the Republican
party, and in fact amounted to putting a
weapon in the hands of the opposition to
slay it with. President Arthur exhibits
great political sagacity as well as states
manship in recommending the passage
of a law to cure this evil. We
wTish it were possible to say as much for
his recommendations touching the reduction
of the internal - revenue taxes, and the
revision of the tariff. President Arthur,
like his Secretary of the Treasury, seems to
be under the influence of that familiar bug
aboo the prospective contraction of tho
currency and is apparently very much
exercised lest the failure of Congress to
repeal the revenue taxes should resultftn
needlessly piling up money in the Treasury.
Indeed, he takes the ground that the rapid
extinguishment of the public debt is a cause
for apprehension rather than satisfaction,
and is in favor not only of taking off all
domestic taxes, except those on distilled
spirits, but of making large reductions in
the customs revenues, and placing on the
free list many articles that now pay a duty.'
But for the demands which the payment of
pensions will make upon the Treasury, and
the obstacle which the entire abolishment of
the excise taxes would offer to a revision of
the tariff, he frankly admits that he would bo
in favor of the absolute repeal of all internal
revenue taxes. These recommendations are
all based, it will bo observed, on the
assumption that there is a large sur
plus in the Treasury which cannot bo used
to the public advantage in fact, that the
very existence of such a surplus is detri
mental to public interests. This assumption,
however, as The Tribune has frequently
taken occasion to show, is not well founded.
In tho first place, if Congress does its duty
by our ex-soldiers, and passes the pension
and bounty measures now before it, the
Government will have need of all this sur
plus, and it will be paid out in such a way
as to make any contraction of the currency
impossible. In tho Becond place, even
should Congress once more prove direlict
in its duty to our veterans, this surplus
can be applied, as heretofore, to the
extinguishment of the public debt, and
the money so paid out will find its way back
into the channels of trade and render any
contraction impossible. In the third place,
it is not true that the rapid extinguishment
of tho debt is a public evil, a3 the history of
tho payment by France to Germany of
the enormous war indemnity of 1870
abundantly shows. In the fourth place, it
is not a fact that the internal-revenue taxes
are a heavy burden upon the country. On
the contrary, they are scarcely felt by the
mass of the people, and their repeal will
only swell the profits of wealthy manufac
turers and monopolists. In the fifth place,
the Government cannot honorably surrender
any part of its present income until it has
made provision for tho payment of its
obligations to the soldier as well as to the
bondholder, and that will certainly not he
until the Equalization of Bounties Bill has
become a law.
It is to be presumed that the President's
recommendations in regard to taxation and
the tariff will have great weight with Con
press, but that is only an additional reason
why our ex-soldiers should endeavor to make
their own influence felt in that body. It
is now of more importance than ever that
they should let their representatives know
that they are unalterably opposed to any
tinkering with our internal-revenue system,
and they cannot do better than adopt the
method of remonstrance suggested else
where in our editorial columns, namely,
that on Thursday next, December 14th,
every one of them should write and mail to
tho representative of -his district a letter
requesting him to voto against any and all
propositions looking to a reduction of the
revenues. If they will do this, perhaps even
the President may realize after awhile that
he has misconstrued tho real sentiment of
the country on this subject.
Remember December 14th.
It becomes daily more apparent that the
retention or reduction of the Internal Reve
nue taxes will be the leading issue of the
present session of Congress, and we regret to
say that the probability of a redaction is
very much greater than it was a year ago.
How the proposed reduction will affect the
interests of our ex-soldiers we have already
explained in detail, aud wo take it for
granted that our readers aro of one mind as
to its impolicy. It is not because Thk
Tribune i3 opposed to tax reduction in
general that it has antagonized it in the
present instance, but simply because it does
not think it either statesmanlike or honor
able to make that rcductiou so long as the
obligations of the Government to its ex
soldiers remain undischarged. The same
considerations of public policy, which, in
our judgment, render it advisable for the
Government to retain its present income
until full provision has been made for the
payment of its debts, would require it to
voluntarily reduce taxation tho moment
that provision had been made. For the
Government is, after all, bound by the same
rules of mercantile honor as those which
obtain in the business Avorld, and there is
no reason why it should be exempted from
their operation.
It is very much to bo deplored, as we
have said, that our Congressmen generally
do not take this sensible, business-like vicn
of the matter, but instead of indulging in
vain regrets the thing for our ex-soldiers to
consider is how they can bring their Repre
sentatives around to their own way of think
ing. In last week's issue wo suggested, as
the most expeditious and effectual method
of securing their attention, that our vet
erans should appeal to them direct by
letter, and in order to make that pro
cedure tho moro imprcssivo, that these
letters should all be written on the same
day Thursday, December 14th and tve are
now moro strongly of the opinion than ever
that this is the only practical course to pursue
Many of our Congressmen seem to be labor
ing under the impression that tho people
are clamoring for a reduction of the Internal
Revenue taxes, and, even against their own
judgment, are on that account disposed to
vote for it. It is of vital importance, there
fore, that they should be disabused of that
idea, and nothing will so quickly bring
them to their senses as the receipt of letters
from their constituents protesting against
any reduction. In order, however, to con
vince them that public sentiment generally
is opposed to disturbing our Internal Reve
nue system at present, it will be necessary
for our ex-soldiers as a body to enter hearti
ly into the spirit of the movement, and cot
only write themselves but indnco their
neighbors and acquaintances to write also.
They should make a business of it, aud not
put it off to a more convenient season.
Surely they can give a part of one day to a
matter of such immediate personal concern,
and if they will each make it a patriotic
duty on Thursday next to write and mail to
the representative of their district in Con
gress a frank, straightforward letter request
ing him to vote against all propositions for
a reduction of the present internal revenuo
taxea, we are sure Congress will not dare to
ignore their appeal. Many of our Congress
men, we repeat, aro laboring under the im
pression that the people want tho taxes re
duced. It is for you, as thoir constituents, to
assure them over your own signatures, that
such is not the case. Do not neglect or shirk
this duty. Make a note of the day, next
Thursday, December 14th, and not only
remember to writo yourself, but see that all
your comrades and acquaintances do their
duty also.
Building Up tho Grand Army.
We hope our readers will not lose sight of
the plan inaugurated by this journal for sec
onding the efforts of Commander-in-Chief
Vandervoort in building up the membership
of the Grand Army aud establishing new
Tosts. It is capable of being made a most ef
fective means for extending tho influence and
fostering the growth of the Order, and there
is nothing to prevent its universal adoption.
As we have repeatedly pointed out, all that
it is necessary to do in order to secure the
establishment of a Post of the Grand Army
where one does not already exist, is simply
to secure the consent of ten honorably-discharged
soldiers or sailors to unite in an
application for a charter and to forward
their names to this office. On receipt of the
names we engage to communicate at once
with the proper authorities and see that the
necessary steps are taken to mu3ler-in the
Post. There are thousands of our ex-soldiers
who remain aloof from the Order simply for
the reasou that they do not know what it is
requisite for them to do to secure admission
to it, or because there happens to bo no Post
in their vicinity. What we want to do is to
facilitate their cntrauco into the Order. The
place for all our veterans is in the ranks of
the Grand Army. There they will find the
spirit of patriotism still dominant and the
feeling of comradeship more powerful than
party prejudice, social rank, religious creed,
or business ties. It is to-day the most noble
organization, alike in its objects and its
principles, that man ever founded, and there
is not a soldier, in the land who would not
be benefited by joining it. Let no one im
agine for a moment that it is a part of its
mission to perpetuate sectional animosities.
Our veterans cherish no feelings of hate for
the men who fell in the vain endeavor to
establish tho southern confederacy, and
they long since clasped hands vf ith tho sur
vivors across the graves of the dead. Tho
mission of the Grand Army is to heal rather
than open tho wounds received in that glo
rious struggle; to perpetuate the princi
ples of patriotism and honor and self-sacri-
fice; to protect and save from further suffer
ing the brave men who risked their lives in
defense of the Union. The Grand Army, we
repeat, is the place for our veterans. It is
their natural home, and we want the readern
and subscribers of Thk Tribune to aid us
in gathering them all together within its
hospitable doors.
The Mooting or Congress.
The last session of the Forty-seventh
Congress, which opened on Monday last,
promises to be ono of unusual interest.
Among the important matters that will
come up for discussion aud action may be
mentioned the report of the Tariff Com
mission, already sent in; the bill3 io
reduce internal -revenue taxation; and
the pension measures which wer pend
ing when Congress adjourned. As far as
the tariff is concerned, we do not anticipate
that any material changes will bo made
during the session, although the recommen
dations of the Commission wilJ undoubtedly
be debated at length in both Houses, but
there is some reason for tho apprehension
that an attempt will be made to force the
Republican majority to reduce or aboliph
altogether the internal revenue taxes with a
view to forestalling the Democrats in tho
programme which they aro credited with
having laid out for the next Congress.
Among the recognized leaders of the Repub
iean party there aro some, we regrot to say,
who seem to regard the result of the late
elections as n popular verdict in favor of
revenue reduction, oblivious of tho fact that
this question was nowhere made a distinct
issue in the lato campaign, and that
Democratic as well as Republican bosses
were swept away by the popular uprising.
They shut their eyes to the fact which is
patent to everybody ctae, that it was not
tho principles of the Republican party
against which such heavy majorities wcro
cast at the late election, but tho prescriptive
methods of its self-constituted bosses, aud
appear to think that to recover the confidence
of the public it is only necessary to rcduco
the taxes. How absurd it is to place such a
construction upon recent political events,
when every person of ordinary intelligence
knows that it is not the general public but
tho rich monopolist who will be benefited
by a reduction of internal -revenue taxation !
But supposing it were true that the elec
tion of a Democratic Congress was equivalent
to an expression of public opinion in favor
of what those who are in favor of making
tho Government poor are pleased to term
" revenue reform," why should the present
Congress meddle with the question? Ob
viously it should be left to the consideration
of a Congress fresh from the people and sup
posed to be in close accord with their views
touching the issues of the day. We aro far
from believing that the voters of the country,
or a majority of them, are in favor of disturb
ing tho present revenue system except,
perhaps, in the caso of matches, whero it
works to the positivo advantage of monop
oly but whether they are or are not, tho
present Congress, tho members of which
were elected beforo the question becanio a
subject of popular discussion, certainly
ought not to take upon itself the responsi
bility of changing it.
As for tho pension measures that went
over at tho last session, it is clearly the
duty of the Congress in which they
originated to take final action upon them.
Here is, indeed, an opportunity for the
Republican leaders in tho Forty-seventh
Congress to make political capital for their
party. No one, for instance, can successfully
dispute the justice of the provisions of the
bill to increase the pensions of those who
lost a limb in tho service, or sustained an
equivalent disability, or tho equity of the
proposition to compensate ex-Union pris
oners of war for the cruelties inflicted on
them at Andersonville and other Southern
prison-pens, and we say to our Represent
atives in Congress that if they are really
anxious to earn tho respect and gratitude of
their constituents they cannot do better
than vote for the enactment of these meas
ures. There is, besides, one other bill of vital
importance that will come up for action
during the approaching session, and that is
the regular pension appropriation bill. For
the requirements of the Pension Office dur
ing the present fiscal year Congress made
liberal provision appropriating therefor
$100,000,000 and to meet the additional
payments that will fall duo next year on
account of arrears of peusion, by reason of
the increased number of allowances thnt
will be made, as large an appropriation
will be needed. Should Congress fail to
make it, the responsibility of the Govern
ment will not be diminished in tho slightest,
while those of our ex-soldiers who are en
titlcd'to, but as yet have not received thoir
pensions, will be subjected to fresh priva
tion. We sincerely hope that our Congress
men will not become so deeply engrossed in
tho discussion of the tariff and taxation as to
forget all about tho rights and necessities of
tho soldier.
Tho Gettysburg Campaign.
In his interesting narration of service as
Adjutant-General of the Army of Northern
Virginia, Colonel Walter H. Taylor claims
for General Lee that he held that "it was a
part of a true defensive policy to take the
aggressive when good opportunity offered ;
and by delivering an effective blow to the
onemy, not only to inflict upon him serious
loss, but at the same time to thwart his de
signs of invasion, derange the plan of cam
paign contemplated by him, and thus pro
long the conflict."
It was evident to tho confederate com
mander that General Hooker, having reoccu
picd the heights of Fredeiickaburg with his
army, could not be dislodged or even attacked
except at great disadvantage. Nt caring to
be the stacking party in a great battlo,
General Lee formed the determination to
move his army to such position north of the
Rappahannock as should compel Hooker to
attack him, where, with the advantage that
choice cf position would give him, he might
reasonably hopo for success.
General Lee, therefore, manoeuvred to
draw the Army of the Potomac from its im
pregnable position and freo the State of
Virginia from the presence of tho Union
forces. By transferring the theatre of war to
Northern soil he reaped the double advan
tage of collecting supplies for his army from
the loyal States and of instilling new hope
into the hearts of the people of the South.
By a strange oversight General Halleck
had failed to notify General Milroy of the
advance of Ewell's cavalry corps down the
Valley, nnd he had no means of judging of
the force with which he had to contend
until the head of Ewell's column was upon
him. He made such resistance as wa3 pos
sible, and, in the attempt to avoid surrender,
lost one-third of his command and all his
artillery and supplies.
One of the objects of Thk National
Tribune is to educate the general public to
properly appreciate the obligations which the
Nation is under to tho men who saved the
Union. The public must be disabused of
the idea, for instance, that the payment of
tho pensions and bounties duo our veterans
involves an enormous and unreasonable ex
penditure of the public money. The amount
i tjaM to tho bon rib fjirlftrq is nut, nf n.11 iirnnnr-

cial sources, shows :

As we have frequently pointed out, if
each of our subscribers would go to work'
to get at least one new subscriber to TnE
National Timbune, it would teko but a
very little while to secure the desired circu
lation of 1G0.000. And surely it ought not
to be a very hard matter for any ex-soldier
or sailor to persuade one of his comrades to
take TilE Tribune, considering what a
staunch advocate it is of the soldier's
interests, and how much each issue contains
which they ought to know. Will not our
subscribers mako the effort? Between now
and the first of January they certainly will
have abundant time in which to mako the
necessary canvass, and tho only question is
as to whether they think enough of The
Tribune to undertake the work. May we
not look for a hearty and speedy response?
The Gettysburg Star and Sentinel of No
vember 22d has an account of ono of tho
most brutal exhibitions of rebel hate that
hits occurred since the war. The National
Tribune has nothing to do with the occas
ion which called it forth, and doesn't care a
button which political party is responsible for
the revolting spectacle, but it holds up to tho
scorn and contempt of its readers the baso
and cowardly conduct of tho wretches who
dared to perpetrate such an outrage upon
decencjr and such an insult to a brave and
honorable soldier as is here recorded. Gen
eral Beaver was one of the Republican can
didates for Governor of Pennsylvania, and
the wagon referred to formed part of a Dem
cratic procession celebrating his defeat. The
following is the account in question :
"At u time when the Republicans had settled
down to a philosophical acceptance of their de
feat, whon they were prepared to ee tho enemy
rejoico and have a good time generally over
their so-called victories, they did not expect to
have every patriotic citizen in the community
inbulted ami shocked by tho most offensive ex
hibition that has ever been seen in a decent
community. Under cover of darkness a wagon
was brought to town on which was erected a
gallows, to which was hung an eftljjy of a one
legjed soldier. The leg was off at the hip and
the eflljry was most i ndeceutly labeled " Heaver "
in largo letters. When this hideous thing first
made its appearance, charity attributed its
origin to some grossly ignorant section of tho
country, where partisan malevolence is esteemed
a virtue. But it turned out that it was con
ceived and brought forth in Gettysburg. This j
monstrous elligy of a gallant wounded soldier
wa hauled through the streets of a town
which nineteen years ago ran red with tho
blood of his dying and wounded comrades."
We have hitherto refrained from calling
tho attention of exchanges to the frequent
use of our matter without any acknowledg
ment. We allude more particularly to the
notes prepared for our "Farm and Fireside"
columns. These are republished without
the slightest hint as to their origin. We
notice many of these articles credited to the
Western Farmer, and we would particularly
call the attention of the Sural World aud tho
Practical Farmer to their frequent use of
original matter from our columns without
acknowledgment. We think that it is not
too much to ask that The National Trib
une receive credit.
