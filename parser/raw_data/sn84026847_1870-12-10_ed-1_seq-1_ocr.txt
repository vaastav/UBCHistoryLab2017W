Nkw Yokk, December 9. ? A corre
s|M>ndenl writes Iroin New Orleans on the
lid, that on that morning, in the United
States Court. Judge Durell, presiding,
United States District Attorney J. R.
Bretwith called up the. case of Perry
Fuller, ex-Collector of New Orleans,
against w hom nineteen indictments had
been found by the Grand Jury for fraud
ul? nt entries of sugar andcofl'ee during
bis term of office, the civil cases tried
last year resulting in every case in a
verdict of confiscation against the con
signees, August E. Contourie Jt .Co.
Tne -whole amount involved was some
millions of dollars. The caies have
been compromised in Washington by
tbe pavmeut of the duties, but criminal
charges hgainst the officers of customs,
through whose active connivance the
frauds were perpetrated, remained on
the docket. The United States District
Attorney endeavored to bring these to
an issue. The result is seen. Perry
Fuller was called twice on his bond
to appear. His sureties, Alexander M.
' McDonald, United States Senator from
Arkansas, and E. G. Ross, United
States Senator from Kansas, were then
called upon to bring the body of Fuller
into court. They waited to make au
?wer. District Attorney Beckwith moved
for an a'ias capias, stating that the
bonds were taken to Washington and I
seemed to be very imperfect, if not !
worthless. The order was made. Wad- j
dv Thompson, against whom charges of
a similar character had been found,
was then called on and also failed to
appear. District Attorney Beckwith
stated that tbe bond of the accused had
been stolen at Memphis. Thompson
bad been several times arrested
at Memphis, near which city he
owns a magnificent plantation, but has
always been released by obliging the
courts on a writ of habeas corpus. The
correspondent after the citing of thir
teen cases found against Fuller and his
associate, to illustrate the heoious na
ture of the charges, says : The prosecu
tion ol these cases in the civil courts
will cost the government at least $100
<KK), and after confiscation had been de
creet!, in%every ease, a compromise has
been effected by the simple payment of
duties, which the party is willing to pay j
from tbe first. The main argument
on trial was that it was the
officers of the United States
Custom House who were really the
guilty offenders. These have been :
released on straw bail or at least upon
informal recognizances and thus this !
much vaunted vindication of the integ- J
rity of the revenue laws ends in a costly 1
tizzle There is a big mouse in tbe
meal tub somewhere, and more than

with a distinguished Congressman from
Indiana could probably give informa

j by the Germans. The array of the
Loire has started on a forward move
ment.

recently drove them. A large number
of prisoners has arrived at Paris cap
tured in the battles at the east and
south of the city on the 2d inst. The

Prussia; to assume the title of Emperor
of Germany united with presidential
functions. 1 am proud thus to take the
first step in crowning theGerman unity.
I hope tor your assent and that of other
Princes and free towns.
London, December 7. ? The Times be- j
lieves that certain recommendations j
made in the President's message will
fall still-born, like many of those ot'
Grant's predecessors' documents. It
marks another stage of the President's]
downward career, and next shows how
far the highest authorities will go when
the balance of parties is unstable.

ment, who said that even it the state
ment were true, they would Hill have j
the right to expect a great movement oCj
the nations to their assistance, and will ,
continue the combat.
Advices from reliable parties show
that the recent successes of the_ Paris
ians were greater than supposed.
When the balloon started, tirln? was
heard south of Paris.
The journals in Tours announce the
changes in the army of the Loiie, which
is divided into three corps, under com

tapool of the news ofGortschakoff's cir-.

Admiral P?rt?r.
Washington, December 8. ? It was
reported here last night that the Ptew
dent and Admiral Porter had been re
conciled, and that General Sherman
has been acting as peacemaker, It is
argued by Admiral Porter's friends that
as General Sherman wa a promised be
fore the rank of General of the army
was abolished, so Admiral Porter
should be allowed to succeed to the
office made vacant by the death of
Farragut before any action is taken oo
General Logan's joint reeolation. Much
curiosity has been evinced in regard to
the original manuscript of Porter's let
ter to Welles. It is how on file inifce

it has been recently put there. ItMs
marked "private."
Sweeping Censure.
The Paraguayan Investigation com
mittee of the House indulged in a sweep
ing censure of Admiral Gordon for not i
affording better protection to Minister
Washburn and attaches to his legation
during the late war, and a court-martial
or court of inquiry is likely to pro
nounce on its verdict.

mission of the Secretary of the Treas. j
ury to exchange f 17,000 in five twenty
