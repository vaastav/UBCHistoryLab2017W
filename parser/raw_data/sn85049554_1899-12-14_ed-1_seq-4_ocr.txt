Keeeiuly an orthodox clergyman In
an American church, referring lo the
new possessions of these United States,
petitioned the Almighty for wisdom oil
the part ot those authority over us
in governing these new lands "that
have come into our possession by Thy
providence or by human mistakes."
The. sentences in quotation are the text
of this lay sermon. For some uncer
tainly. so much of doubt is shown in
them that they suggest an orthodox
position of nenosticism quite out of the
ordinary. ith one ot the privileges
ot the cloth this lay preacher will first
inke up th.' "human mistakes." Sec
ondly the Providence ot God, and final
ly attempt to prove, that "human mis
takes" are equally providential lo
those of mimaii success.
Assuming that wo came into posses
sion ot tile Philippines, Porto Klco and
the island ot Guam, as well as Hawaii,
by the mistakes of man, let us see what
tin were. No need for the argument
to go back of tile known national char
acteristics- of tile Spaniards. They
made a mistake in governing Cuba by
cruelty and oppression. Tnen some
body made a lnlstaite of blowing up
the Maine. Soon after .Spain made a
great mistake by declaring war against
this untry. This was followed by the
capture of Manila by Dewey and, ac
cording to tile anti-imperialists, he
made a mistake in not sailing away
after his decisive battle. Then con
gress made a mistake and .ratified the
treaty witli Spain, and McKinley made
a mistake by trying to hold by' force
territory ceded to us by those who were
in nominal possession of it. Aguii'.aldo
made a mistake in starting his insur
rection. This would seein to be a fair
statement of the mistakes of men in
tliis drama of human hisLory. Of
course these so-called mistakes are
only so from different points of view.
Now let us try and trace the hand of
Providence. Clearly the Cubans must
see the work of Die Almighty in bring
ing about a sentiment in this country
that resulted in driving the Spaniard
from the beautiful island. And was ii
not the work of Providence that used
this war with Spain to unite the north
and south together in fraternal bonds,
oniy to lie so but by a renewed com
mon interest? Can we doubt that tlie
possession of the Philippines by this
country, i.« one of the providences of
God to civilize, educate and Christian
ize the people of thos»: islands? Ask
the most pessimistic anti-imperialist of
the country what the probable condi
tion of these foreign lands would have
lie-n in l'.'.M) under the continual rule
of Spain. Then ask what we shall prob
ably find in litr.O under American rule.
Ask tiie same of Hawaii, Porto Ttico
tnd Giiam. Does any one doubt that
tifty years from now some orthodox
minister in a Christian pulpit In the

morning prayer address ids Creator in
these words: "We thank Tli-e that by
