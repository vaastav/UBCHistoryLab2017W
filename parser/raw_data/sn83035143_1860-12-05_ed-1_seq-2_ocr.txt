of the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law
Hi.rinir v Admmislrtion.Mid aavl it will be

enforeei Baji that if tli property of

of Congress to coerce. He will not reeog-
nite ary seceding State as a foreign power,
He hoMsthat no State has tie right tx a

1 The "Old Public Functionary" proclaims
himwl' in terrible quandary as to what to
do. He say that States have 'ho right to
secede, bat Congress has no rijjiit to compel
them to stay In. He pitifully pleads that he
baa had no hand in bringing affairs to their
"present distracted state, and hopes Congress
will pass laws to help him out. He makes
the humiliating confession that the people of
South Carolina will not let him' execute the
laws in thai State, and he don't know what
to do about it. .... . . . :'

"Bad for the Coo."
When Gecrge Stephenson bad completed
his model of a steam carriage, be presented
himself beore Parliament, asking for the at
tention and support of that Body. The grave
U. P.'s looked at his invention aneeriBgly
and sa';d, "So you have made a carriage to
run only by steam, have you ?'' , " Yes, my
Lords.'' " And you expect your carriage to
run 05 parallel rails, so that It can t get off,
do you ? " Yes, my Lords." " Well, no w.
Mr. Stphenson, let us she yoa how absurd
your claim is. Suppose when your carriage
is running upon these rails at the rate of ten,
twenty or thirty miles as hour, .if you are
extravagant enough to even irapposejuch a
thing possible,) a eo should gel in its way.
Yon can't turn ou. far her what tiien ?
"Then 'twill be bad for the coo, my Lords.1
Carnot our choleric friends at the South
take a hint from the honest English engineer,
and be cautions that they do not tempt their
own destruction? The mighty engine 'of
American progress has been rushing on with
rapid revolutions of its iireles9 driving
wheels, drawing with it a train of weighty
hopes aad responsibilities for the future, and
now wco to the luckless community which
would place itself on the track. The engine
cannot turn out, and "'twill be bad for the
coo." When the little State of South Caro-
lina, not satisfied with the rich grazing in
the social and political fields, walks upon tiie
track and vain-gloriously boasts within her
self that she will throw the whole confede
rated train to destruction, let her beware lest
of her former comeliness,
save a few remnants of palmetto flags and
secession cockades, as warning way-marks to
future intruders.

Infatuation of the South.
The South Carolina Mercury has put forth
a savag artiele oa the readiness of Fouth
Carolina to meet force with force, It expect
a denunciation of secession in the President's

ing, u tnrtber says : 1
The real matter the only matter for con
cern will be the action of Congress in giv

draw the sword against.a seceding State.

that he will hardly undertake the entrrpme of
coercion. Me will present tne spectacle J
bloody intents, with a fraternal and loving
sensibility, which will not allow him to en
force them. We certainly deprecate war
with the northern people through the general
government; but Mr. Buchanan may be as
sured that the firsl attempt, In any form, to
coerce South Carolina into submission to a
government she has thrown off, will be con
sidered war. He may call it by what same
he pleases, but the iword will then- be the final
and only arbiter between ut I
What blind infatuation possesses the writers
of such things as the above. If force be re
sorted to, (which Heaven forbid,) the haud-
lul of soldiery in South Carolina could be
crushed out in twenty-four hours after the
arrival off the coasts of vessels : from the
North. The white population of South Car
olina in 1850 was 274,563.' Suppose the
present population to be 309,000. ' One-
seventh of these the usual average ir 42,-
857, are voters. Take from this number all
the old, the sick, the infirm, disabled, and that
large class who wouid never be ftund ready
to do fighting or service, and take the further
reduction of the Union conservative party and
the fighting men would not number more
than 10,000. And with this army she defies
the General Government and all the forces at

In the Fugitive Slave Law Constitutional?
The best legal minds of th North believe
Fugitive Slave Law to be unconstitution
al, First, because it violates the right ot trial
int7 and "suspends'' the privileges of the
writ of habeas 'Corpus, both common law and
constitutional rights; and secondly,' because
empowers United States Commissioners to
decide; upon the liberty or slavery of alleged
fugitive This Is a judicial question, and all
such questions are vested in the Courts by the
Constitution. They alone lave' the right to'
arbi trate an d decide them. The consti tution
ality of the. Fngitiv Slave Law has never
been judicially decided, and until it be,' the
Northern people have a right to their doabts
upon the subject. Mr. Crittenden, it is troe,
gave an opinion while Attorney GenemL- in
favor ot its constitutionality. : But this has
binding force. It does Btot satisfy the pub
lic mind, that, in disregarding; three; positive
right, guaranteed to all white men, as every
conccdos, even though only nefroea, or
men suspected of having negro blood in their
veins; are to be the sufiereis, the law i con
stitutional. -Ztt x.'.; , "'

already considering the names of persons in
connection with this matter ; he ktepe hit own
eountel, and hat not made and will not make any
proponhon to any one until after the vote of the
Electoral CollegevtiR be catt.' But while noth
ing definite is as yet known as to whom he
will select as his Constitutional advisers, the
tone of President-a! circles authorizes the be
lief that the choice will be pre-eminently comcr-

to say that the Pnnce has been singularly for
tunate in the selection of a Secretary oi State
to attend him on his travels. Jt seems a hap
py concidence that at the hour when the royal
squadron was making the bnglish land on
Wednesday night, the fnrae Minister was
eloquently acknowledging the hospitalities
which the Pnnce of Y ales had enjoyed in the
United States.
The London Times says :
It is not everybody who can best do that
which is his most natural part, for it is the
highest merit to be jiist that which a man
ought to be. The commonest form of error
to attempt a part not one's own, or to com
bine two in one. ' The Prince of Wales has
only shown himself in his own proper charac
ter as the bead of the young British gentry,
the future sovereign ot a constitutional country
and the representative of an empire whose
best interests are to be at peace with all the
world, and which neither hopes for aggrand
izement nor fears any foe. He has expressed
to the Americans the real sentiment of every
Bntisn heart to that great cognate nation.
There Is none in which we are all so interes
ted; none the successes and glories of which
we all bear with such unmixed satisfaction ;
none with which we so identify ourselves.
The Prince of W ales, while showing the feel
ings of a trne-born bnglishman, nas elicited
the feelings of all tru-born Americans, and
brought the two face to face and made
them feel they are brothers. , ,
