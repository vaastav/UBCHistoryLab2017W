PROGRAM FOR NEW LEGISLA
TION FOR PRESENT TERM.
WOULD REDUCE LIVING COSTS

Tariff System, Curb Unrest, Rec
tify Labor and Farming
Conditions.
Washington. — Principal recom
mendations of the president in his
message to Congress are:.
Legislation to combat the cost of
living.
Measures which will remove the
cause« of "political restlessness in
our body politic."
An effective fight against radicals
who seek "by violent methods to ab
rogate our time-tested institutions."
A definite program to bring about a
genuine democratization of industry
and improvement in the condition of
labor.
Establishment of a budget system
for national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem. with simplification of the income

Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem, with simplification of changed
world conditions.
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war, particularly
along the lines laid down by Secre
tary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs Industry.'
An enlarged programme for rural
development in recognition of the far
mers' part in the war
(The president explained that later
messages would deal with the peace
treaty and the railroad question).
The presidents' message follows:
To the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives:
I sincerely regret that I cannot be
present at the opening of this session
of the Congress. I am thus prevent
ed from presenting In as direct a way
u I could wish the may questions
that are pressing for solution at this
tiiu©. Happily, I have had the ad
vantage of the advice of the hoards of
the several executive departments,
who have kept In close touch with af
fairs In their detail and whose
thoughtful recommendations I earn
estly second
In the matter of the railroads and
the .readjustment of the affairs grow
ing ont of federal control, I shall take
the liberty at a later date of address
ing you.
I hope that Congress will bring to
a conclusion at this session legisla
tion looking to the establishment of
a budget system. That there should
he one single authority responsible
for the making of all appropriations
and that appropriations should be
made Wot Independently of each other,
hut with reference to one single com
prehensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's income,
there can be no doubt I believe the
burden of "preparing the budget must,
in the nature of the ease, if the work
is to be properly done and responsi
bility concentrated instead of divided,
rest upon the executive. The budget
so prepared should be submitted to
and no single appropriation should
be made by the Congress, except
such as may have been Included in
tho budget prepared by the executive
or added by the particular committee
of Congress charged with the budget
legislation.
- Another and not leaf important as
pect of tho problem is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys a p prop riled
the expended- Under existing law
the only audit is for the purpose of
ascertaining whether expenditures
have been lawfully made within the
appropriations. Ko one la authorized
or equipped to ascertain whether the
has been spent wisely, eco

methods employed and the results

mentis or the government Their re
ports should be made to the Congress
and to the secretary of the treasury.
I trust that the Congress will give
It* immediate consideration to the
problem of future taxation. Simpli
«cation of the income
taxes has become an
ceseity. These taxes
service daring
however, be
not only to save the taxpayer
and
bat in
men ts necessary or desirable in-eon
n cction with the administration of
the law—recommendations which
have my approval and support. It is
of the utmost importance that in deal
ing ulthjthis matter the preeent law
sho-u'dTKh.be disturbed so far as re
gards taSSd&for tho calendar year
192ä, -payable in the calendar year
191T. The Congress might well con
sider whether the higher rateB of in
come and profits taxes can in peace
times be effectively productive of rev
enue and whether they may not on
the contrary, be destructive of busi
ness acivity and productive of waste
and inefficiency. There is a point at
which in peace times high rates of
income and profits taxes discouvage
energy, remove the incentive to new
enterprise, encourage extravagant ex
penditures and produce industrial
stagnation with consequent unem
ployment and other attendant evils.
The problem is not an easy one A
fundamental change lias taken place
with reference to the position of
America in the world's affairs. The
prejudice and passion engendered by
decades of controversy be: ween two
schools of political and economic
thought—the one believes In protec
tion of American industries,''the other
believers in tariff for revenue only- -
must be subordinated to the single
consideration of tho public interest
in the light of utterly changed condi
tions. Before the war America was
heavily the debtor of the rest of the
world and the interest payments she
had to make to foreign countries on
American securities held abroad, the
expenditures of American travelers
abroad and the ocean freight charges
she had to pay to others, about bal
anced the value of her pre-war favor
able balance of trade. During tho
war America's exports have been
greatly stimulated, and increased
prices have increased their value. Ou
the other hand, she has purchased a
large proportion of the American se
curities previously held abroad, has
loaned some $9,000,000,000 to foreign
governments, and has built her own
ships. Our favorable balance of trade
has thus been greatly increased and
«Europe has been -deprived of the
means of meeting it-heretofore exist
ing. Europe can have only three
ways of meeting the favorable bal
ance of trade in peace times. By Im
ports into this country of gold or of
goods, or by establishing new credits
Europe is In no position at ibe pres
ent time to ship gold to us nor could
we contemplate large further Im
ports of gold into this cOuniry with
out concern. The time has nearly
passed for international government
al loans and it will take time to de
velop in this country a market for
foreign securities. Anything, there
fore which would tend to prevent» for
eign countries from settling for our
exports by shipments of goods into
this country could only have the ef
fect of preventing them from paying
for cur exports and therefore of pre
venting the exports from being made
Tho productivity of tho country great
ly stimulated by the war, must find
an outlet by exports to foreign coun
tries and any measures token to pre
vent imports will inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load the banking machinery of
the country with credits to carry un
sold products and produce Industrial
stagnation and unemployment. If we
want to sell, we must be prepared to
buy. Whatever, therefore, may have
been our views during the period of
growth of American business concern
ing tariff legislation, we must now
adjust our own economic life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business is full
grown and that America is the great
est capitalist in the world,
fseoiation Not U. 8. Policy.
No policy of isolation will satisfy
growing need* and opportunities
tmerica. The provincial stand
ards and policies of the past, whith
have held American business as if in
a straight-jacket, must yield and give
way to the needs of exigencies of the
new day in which we live, a day full
of hope and promise for American
business, if we will but take advan
tage of the opportunities that are
ours for the asking. The recent war
has ended our Isolation and thrown
upon us a great duty and responsibil
ity. The United States must share
the expanding world market. The
United States desires for itself only
equal opportunity with the other na
tions of the world and that through

anco apon which I urged action at the
last session of Congress which are
still pressing for solution. I am sure
It is not necessary for me to again re
mind you that there is one immediate
and very practicable question result
ing from the way which we should
meet in the most liberal spirit. It is
a matter of recognition and relief to
our soldiers I can do no better than
to quote from my last message urg
ing this very action: "We must see

regions of the country which the fed

or neglected areas which lie within
the limits of the older states: and I
once more take tho liberty of recom
mending very urgently that his plana
bhali receive the immediate and sub
stantial support of the Congress."
In the matter of tariff legislation 1
beg to call your attention to the
statements contained in my last mes
sage urging legislation with refer
ence to the establishment, of the
chemical and dyestuffs industry in
America:
"Among the industries to which
special consideration should be given
is that of the manufacture of dye
stuffs and related chemicals. Our
complete dependences upon German
supplies before the wax made the In
terruption of trade a cause of excep
tional economic disturbance.. The
close relation between the manufac
ture of dyestuffs, on the one hand,
and of exlosive sand poisonous gases
on the other, moreover, has given the
industry an exceptional significance
and value. Although the United
States will gladly and unhesitatingly
join in the programme of internation
al disarmament, it will, nevertheless,
be a policy of obvious prudence to
make certain of the successful main
tenance of many strong and well
equipped chemical plants. The Ger
man chemical industry with which we
will he brought Into competition was,
and may well be again, a thoroughly
knit monopoly capable of exercising
a competition of a peculiarly insid
ious and dangerous kind."
Nation Must Produce More.
During the war the farmer perform
ed a vital and willing service to the
nation. By materially increasing the
production of hie land he supplied
America and the allies with the In
creased amounts of food necessary to
keep their immense armies in the
field. He indispensably helped to win
the war. But there now is scarcely
less need of Increasing the produc
tion in food and the necessaries of
life. I ask the Congress to consider
means of encouraging effort along
these tines.
The importance of doing every
thing possible to promote production
along economical lines, to Improve
marketing and to make rural life
more attractive and healthful 13 ob
vious. I would urge approval of tho
plans already proposed to the Con
gress by the secretary of agriculture,
to secure the essential facta required
for the proper study of this question,
through the proposed enlarged pro
grammes for farm management stu
dies and crop estimates. I would urge
also the continuance of federal par
ticipation in the building of good
roads, under the terms of existing
law and under the direction of pres
ent agencies; the need of further ac
tion on the part of the states aud ferl
erai government to preserve and de
velop our forest resources, especially
through the practice of better forest
ry methods on private holdings and
the extension of the public owned for
ests: better support for country
schools and the more definite direo
tion of their courses of study along
lines related to rural problems, and
fuller provision for sanitation in rural
districts and the building up of need
ed hospital and medical facilities in
these localities. Perhaps the way
might be cleared for any of these de
sirable reforms by a fresh, comp re
hensive survey made of rural condi
tions by a conference composed of
representatives of the farmers and of
the agricultural agencies responsible
for leadership.
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while variou
and complicated, are superficial rath
er than deep-seated. Broadly, they
arise from or are connected with tile
failure on the part of oar government
to arrive speedily at a just and per
manent peace permitting return to
normal conditions, from the transfu
sion of radical theories from seething
European centers pending such de
lay, from heartless profiteering re
sulting in the increase of the cost of
living, and lastly from the machina
tfons of passionate and malevolent
agitators. With the return to nor
mad conditions this unrest will rapid
ly disappear. In the meantime it
does pinch evil. It seems to me that
in dealing with this situation Con
gress should not be impatient or dras
tic, but should seek rather to reraov*
the causes. It should endeavor to
bring our country back speedily to a
peace basis, with ameliorated living
conditions under the minimum of re
strictions upon personal liberty that
is consistent with our reconstruction
problems.
And It should arm the federal gov
ernment with power to deal in Its
criminal courts with those persons
who by violent methods would abro
gate our time-tested institutions. With
the free expression of cur opinion and
with the advocacy of orderly political
change, however fundamental, there
must be no interference; but toward
passion and malevolence tending to
incite crime and insurrection under
guise of political evolution therè
should be no leniency.
Legislation to this end has been
recommended by the attorney-general
and should be enacted In this direct
connection I would call your atten
tion to my recommendations on Au
gust 8 pointing out legislative meas
ures which would toe effective to con,
trolling and bringing down $
' living, which coni
IP*** OH only
is
In
to
it
of
one of these recommendations has
(he Congress acted. If the govern
ment's campaign is to be effective 11
is necessary that the other steps sug
gested should be acted on at once.
Extension of Food Control,
I renew and strongly urge the ne
cessity of the extension of the present
has
in«
of
food control act as the period of time ;
In which it shall remain in operation.! in
The attorney general has submitted a
bill providing for an extension of this
act for a poriod of six months. As it ; it
now stands it is limited in operation
to the period of the war, and becomes
inoperative upon the farmal procla
mation of peace. It is imperative that
it should be extended at once. The
Department of Justice has built up
extensive machinery for the purpose
of enforcing its provisions, ail of
which must be abandoned upon the
conclusion of peace unless the provis
ions of this act are extended
During this period the Congress
will have an opportunity te make
similar permanent provisions and reg
ulations with regard to all goods des
tined for interstate commerce and to
exclude them from interstate ship
ment if tho requirements of the law
are not complied with. Some such
regulations is imperatively necessary.
The abuses that have grown up in
the manipulation of prices by the
withholding of foodstuffs and other
necessaries of life cannot otherwise
be effectively prevented. There can
be no doubt of either the necessity
or the legitimacy of such measures.
As I pointed out in my last mes
sage. publicity can accomplish a great
deal in this campaign. The aims of
the government must be - clearly
brought to the attention of the con
suming public, civic organizations and
slate officials, who are in a position
to !end their assistance to our efforts.
You have made available funds with
which to carry on this campaign, but
there is no provision in the law au
thorizing their expenditure for the
purpose of making the public fuliv
informed about the efforts of the gov
ernment. Specific recommendation
has been made by the attorney gen
eral in this regard. I would strongly
urge upon you its immediate adop
tion, as it constitutes one of-1 lie pre
liminary steps to this campaign.
I also renew my recommendation
that the Congress pass a law regulat
ing cold storage as it is regulated,
for example, by the laws of the state
of New Jersey, which limit the time
during which goods may be kept in
storage, prescribe the method of dis
posing of them if kept beyond the
permitted period and require that
.mods released from storage shall In
all cases bear the date of their
oeipt. It would materially add to the
serviceability of the law for the pur
[»ose we now have in view if it were
also prescribed that all goods releas
d from storage for interstate ship
ment should have plainly marked up
on each package the selling or mar
ket price at which they went into
storage. By this means the purchaser
would always be able to learn what
profits stood between hin; and the
producer or the wholesale dealer.
I would also renew my recommend
ation that all goods destined for in
terstate commerce should in every
case, where their form or package
make it possible, be rlainly marked
with the price at which they left the
hands of the producer.
We should formulate a law requir
ing a federal lie anse of all corpora
tions engaged in interstate commerce
and embodying in the license, or in
the conditions under which it is to
be issued, specific regulations design
ed to secure corapentive selling and
prevent unconscionable profits in the
method of marketing. Such a law
would afford a welcome opportunity
to effect other much needed reforms
in the business of interstate ship
ment and In the methods of corpora
tions which are engaged in it; but for
the moment I confine my recommend
a tions to the object immediately in
hand, which is to lower the cost of
living.
Must Solve Labor Problem.
No one who has observed the march
of events In the last year can fail to
note the absolute need of a definite
programme to bring about an im
provement In the conditions of labor.
There can be no settled conditions
leading to Increased production and a
reduction in the coat of living if la
bor and capital are to be antagonists
instead of partners. Sound thinking
and honest desire to serve the Inter,
ests of the whole nation, as distin
guished from the interests of a class,
must be applied to the solution of this
a
two
in
not
of
of
tal
of
to
to
great and pressing problem. The fail
tire of other nation« to consider this
matter In a vigorous way has produc
ed bitterness and Jealousies and an
tagonism, the food of radicalism. The
only way to keep men from agitating
against grievances is to remove the
grievances. An unwillingness even to
discuss these matters produces only
dissatisfaction and gives comfort to
tho extreme elements in our country
whieh endeavor to stir up disturb
ances In order to provoke govern
ments to embark* upon * course of re
taliation and repression. The seed of
revolution is repression. Tn e rente,
dy for these things must not be reg
ative in character. It must be con
structive. It must comprehend the
genera! interest. The real antidote
for the unrest which manifests itself
is not suppression, but a deep consid
eration of the wrongs that beset our
national life and the application of a
remedy. .
Oppress has already shown its
willingness to deal with these indus
trial wrongB by establishing the
eight-hour day as tho standard in ev
every «eld of labor. It has sought to
find a way to prévint child labor. It
has served the whole country by lead
in« tho way in developing the mean«
of preserving and safeguard Jives and
health In dangerous industries. It
must now help in tho difficult task of
finding a method that will bring
about a genuine democratization of
industry, based upon ihe full recog
nition of the right of those who work,
in whatever rank, to participate in
some organic way in every decision
which directly affects their welfare,
it is with this purpose in mind that I
a
called a conference to meet in Wash
ington on December 1 to consider
these problems in all theffr broad as
pects, with the idea of bringing about
a better understanding between these
two interests.
The great unrest throughout the
world, out of which has emerged a de
mand for an immediately considera
tion of the difficulties between capital
and labor, bids us put our own house
in order. Frankly, there can be no
permanent and lasting settlements
between capital and labor which do
not recognize the fundamental con
cepts for which labor has been strug
gling through the years. The whole
world gave Its recognition and in
dorsement to these fundamental pur*
poses in the League of Nations. The
statesmen gathered at Versailles ree
ognized^ the fact that world stability
could not be had by reverting to in
dustrial standards and conditions
against which the average workman
of the world had revolted. It is,
therefore, the task of the statesmen
of this new day of change and read
justment to recognize world condi
ilons that will mean the ending of
age-long antagonisms bdtwe<'n capi
tal and labor and that will hopefully
lead to the building up of a comrade
ship whieh will result not only in
greater contentment among the mass
of workmen, but al.so bring about a
greater production and a greater
production and a greater prosperity
to business itself.
Tfi analyze tho rerticuldrs in the
demands of labor is to admit the jus
tice of their complaint in many mat
ters that lie at their basis. The work
man demands an adequate wage, suf
ficient to permit him to live in com
fort, unhampered by the fear of pov
erty and want in his old age. He de
mand8 the right to live and the right
to work amidst sanitary surround
ings, both in home and in work shop,
surroundings that develop and do not.
retard Tiis own health and well being,
and tlie right to provide for his chil
dren's wants in the matter of health
and education. In other words, it is
his desire to make the conditions of
his life and the lives of those dear
to him tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid down in the cove
nant of the League of Nations offers
us the way to industrial peace and
conciliation. No other road lies open
to us.- Not to pursue this one Is long
er to invite enmities, bitterness and
antagonisms which in the end only,
lead to industrial and social disaster.
The unwilling workman is not a prof
itable servant. An employe whose in
dustrial life Is hedged about by hard
and unjust conditions, which he did
not create and over which he has no
control, lacks that fine spirit of en
thusiasm and volunteer effort which
are the necessary ingredients of a
great producing entity. Let us be
frank about this solemn matter. The
evidences of world-wide unrest which
manifest themselves in violence
throughout the world bid us pause
and consider the means to bo found
to stop the spread of this contagious
thing before it saps the very vitality
of the nation itself.
Do we gain strength by withhold
ing the remedy? Or is it not the bus

remedy we touch not the vital tissues
of our industrial and economic life?
There can he no recessatirtn of the
tide of unrest until constructive In
strumentalities are set ud to stem
that tide.
Collective Bargaining Right
Governments toast recognize the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humane objeers that have at their
base the mutual protection and wel
fare of those engaged to all indus
tries. Labor must not lie longer
treated as a commodity. It must be
regarded as the activity of human be
ings, possessed of deep yearnings ami
desires. The business man gives his
best thought to the repair and re

plenishment of his machinery, so that
its usefulness will not be impaired
and its power to produce may always
be at its height *md kept in lull vigor
and motion. No less regard ought to
be paid to the humen machine, which
after all propels the machinery of the
world and is the great dynamic force
that lies back of all industry and
progress. Return to the old stand
ards of wage and industry in employ
ment are unthinkable. The terrible
tragedy of war which has just ended
and which has brought the world to
the verge of chaos and disaster
would be in vain if there should en
sue a return to the conditions of the
past ■(■■■piipBjpQPi
Europe itself, whence has come the
unrest which now holds the world at
bay, Is an example of slandpatism in
theso vital human matter* which
America might well accept as an ex
ample, not to be followed but stu
diously to be avoided. Europe made
labor the differential, and the price of
it all is enmity and antagonism and

In the matter of international dis»

men have sought to set up as a reme

point the way for the settlement of

Criticiat Hour For America.
This is the hour of test and trial
for America. By her prowess and
strength and the indomintoble cour

her power to vindicate on foreign bat*
