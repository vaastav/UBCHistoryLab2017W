"OVERTURE"SEEN
BY CLEMENCEAU
N.
Believes Amcrica Will Reenter
European Affairs?Up to
Diplomacy
Washington, Dec. 8.?Georges
Clemenceau closing his visit to Washington
this afternoon with a "formal"
address, expressed the hope that
diplomacy would find the way to
bring America back into European
affairs through what he interpreted
as an "overture" by President Harding
in the annual message the execu
live had read to congress a few hours
earlier.
"i was greatly comforted/' said
the war time premier of France,
"when I read in the message of your
president the following lines. They
are not veyy long, but they are very
suggestive :
" "The four power pact, which abolishes
every probability of war on the
Pacific, has brought a new confidence
in maintained peace, and I can well
believe it might be made a model for
like assurances wherever in the world
f any common interests are concerned.'
" * > * . < >
"So you see," continued the Tiger,
"that even those who - are supposed
to disagree, really agree at the very
* bottom o-f their feeling and reasoning
power. That is what I ask, and I hope
this is something iike an overture,
that some light will be coming, and I
will be very glad if it comes from
America and I hope that diplomacy
will have something to say about it,
and talks may. be engaged in, which,
I am surer can bring nothing bat good
for us all."
When Clemencea'uV reference to
the president's message was called to
the attention of the White House, it
was said that there was no comment
to be made and that there was no intention
of elaborating on the president's
statement to congress.
Clemenceau's address delivered before
an audience including many
diplomats, government officials and
members of both houses of congress,
was, in its essence the "peace message"
he first delivered in Chicago.
But, apparently sensing that official
Washington would judge of him and
bis Tniceinn few fWe cnoo^li lin
-W -O^/VVUJi) llw OpO*iv
deliberately and chose his words with
great precision. M
i The former premier answered the
argument that the American taxpayer
can not pay France's bill with the
assertion that France could not pay
those of Germany, and argued that
America should help to make Germany
pay.
M. Clemenceau asked why the
United States went to war* whether
* it was to help France or to make democracy
safe. If it was for the latter
reason, he asked that . the United
States look afar and see the barbar
ism of the Turks and the anarchy of
Russia.
The "Tiger" bo.arded his special
train shortly after 9 o'clock to go to
Philadelphia, where he is sr-heduled
to speak tomorrow morning.

THINKS CANADA OUGHT TO
HAVE SHARE OF COAL
i
Washington, Dec. 8.?The United
States, with only $0 per cent supply'
of hard coal, should treat Canada in j
a "neighborly manner" and let her;
have her usual pro-rata proportion of j
this season's production, regardless |
of resultant hardships in this coun-l
try. j
Such was the policy advocated by!
Federal Fuel Director C. E. Spens in j
a letter today to Chairman Winslow ]
of the house interstate and foreign I
commerce committee. He was com-j
menting on pending oil's proposing;
f embargoes on anthracite and bitumi-!
nnns o-\-nr>r+'afir?ric if fftniiH I
to protect home interests.
Director Spens stated that due to I
the recent strike this season's production
on anthracite is only 60 per
cent of normal, "but, even so,'' he
added, "it would not seem to me to be
proper that the exportation of anthracite
to Canada should be embargoed."
I
Replying to Mr. Spens' views, Representative
John Jacobs Rogers of
Massachusetts,,author of the embargo
resolutions, said:
"I cannot understand the attitude
of the fuel administrator. Canada
does not hesitate to declare an embargo
against us on the export of
wood pulp when it suits her convenience
to do so.
cret llle-ltV of COal
from Wales and we can perhaps
spare her soft coal. Why, however,
we should continue giving her these
great quantities cf hard coal I cannot
understand.*'

[FOUR IRISH LEADERS
ARE EXECUTED
I , Rory
O Connor, Liam Mellows, Mac
j Kelvey and Barret, Face Free
State Firing Squad C-Lr.ly
Dublin, Dcc. 8.?Ireland's bloody
vendetta continues. Horrified last
night by the assassination of Zan
Hales and the shooting of Patrick
O'Malley, Dublin was appalled today
by the execution of Rory O'Connor
and his comrades. Everywhere people
are asking when and how it is all
going to end.
a i * xi. v:
a special meeting 01 me caowiui
'was called last night to discuss the
assassination of Hales. None of the
cabinet member except Minister of
Home Affairs O'Higgins appeared in
the Dail, so that - body adjourned at
cnce.
Meanwhile President Cosgrave and
the cabinet took their decision regarding
drastic action - against the
Republicans?deciding upon the execution
of the four who were shot this
morning.
Rory O'Connor and his comrades
learned their fate an hour later. All
of them received the decision calmly i
and priests were assigned to them.
Their Last Hours
i Liam Mellowes wrote all night,'
working on a document which will
soon be published. O'Connor, MacKeivey
and Barrett wrote letters to!
their relatives.
The four Republicans were executed
at 9:20 this morning and all of j
them faced the firing squad calmly, j
Liam Mellowes was without doubt
a most patriotic Irishman, but he
i lacked something which Michael Collins
possessed. He was not practical
and did not do much reasoning?he
was purely an idealist.
Rory O'Connor was probably an
actor, but an actor who was responsi- j
ble for heaping ruin upon Ireland.'
| He was not a prominent figure when
all of the leaders were standing to-,
gethfer in common cause against Eng-:
land. Then, however, he performed j
a part and performed it bravely. He j
shipped munitions from America. J
traveling as a stoker week after,
week. He died as he lived?a brave ;
man.
Captured at Four Courts
"Rory mistook Mick's generosity, j
, for," said Collins' sister today, dis-!
cussing O'Connor's actions, "if he
had acted as wisely and well as Rich- j
r.rd Mulcahy he would still be alive :
and honored. Those who joined the;
Da Valera group mostly did so for the j
notoriety."
| MacKelvey was an adjutant whenj
O'Connor occupied the Four Courts, j
and Barrett was quartermaster. All!
' of them were taken prisoners when j
they surrendered the Four Courts at !
the end of June after the long siege |
?Yy Mike Collin's troops. I
In many of the Free State prison j
ic,ef nio-M whpn the news ofi
tai i(?/o i-iov
the assassination of Hales became j
known, it was all the officers and j
priests could do to prevent the sol-!
j diers from running amuck and at- j
tacking their prisoners. j

COLLEGE ATHLETICS
! ARE IMPROVING NOW
! : ;
I
1 Atlanta. Ga.. Dec. S.?College ath
letics are improving, but the tendency
toward commercialism should be
guarded against. Dr. S. V Sanford,
president of the Southern intercollegiate
conference, told members of
that body here tonight at their second
annual meeting. He attributed much
I of the improvement to efforts of,
alumni.
, Dr. Sanford recommended that del
partments of physical education

JEFFORDS AND HAR- \<]
RISON SOON PAY WITH LIVES :
i;
Columbia, Dec. 7.?It is expected *
that F. M. Jeffords and Ira Harrison : *
>
will not have many more days of;
grace on earth, following the refusal ](
of Chief Justice Ga**y yesterday to?*
grant them writs of error, on which'*
to base their appeals to the United *
States supreme court. The state su-'|
preme court has already oassed on *
| I <
their cases and dismissed their ap-,*
peals, and it is not expected that thei;
United States supreme court will j"
I grant them a new trial. They will, in '
this event, at an early date pay the | ^
de^th penalty for the murder of J. C. J1
Arnette, Columbia filling station pro-j i
orietor, who was beat to death in his j
j i
i place of busines's on Main street last!
May.
With their cases finally disposed of'
by the state supreme court, the only ?
chance the two convicted men have ;t
! of getting new trials is to go before! *
Ja justice of the United States su-j*
j preme court and apply for a writ on ,x
I which to appeal to that tribunal, j1
' However, it is not generally expected |1
that a United Sates supreme justice j*
would grant the writ, after the re- (t
fusal of the chief justice of the state j'
supreme court to grant such a basis j <
for appeal. Xo announcement has ^J
hnnn made bv attorneys for the two ('
prisoners as to what course they will j(
follow, but it is not thought likely j2
that even should a writ be granted, j |
that the United States supreme court }1
will grant the two new trials. j1
Unless* a writ issues from the high- jy
est tribunal Jeffords will die on De-j*
cenVoer 22. He has recently been i ?
sentenced the second time to death in ; *
the electric chair three days before
Christmas. Harrison, unless the su- j
preme court assumes jurisdiction in 1
his appeal, will be-- re-sentenced at the jnext
term of the criminal court in j Columbia,
beginning January 8. Jef- j5
fords is represented by Jesse B. Ad- j ^
ams of Washington; Harrison is rep- '
resented by B B. Evans of Columbia, j1
Two points are raised in their pe- j
tition of writ cn which to appeal; j1
firrst that a severance of the cases : J
should have beer, granted, ana sec-j'
ond: that the confessions of each of,'
the two men should not have been ai- \:
lowed in evidence against the other, j

STATE PARTICIPATION
IN SCHOOL SUPPORT
Greenville Piedmont.
Many students of school administration
urge a shift of the burden of
s.-hooi support from the local district,
where it now rests, to the larger units,
state and county. This is urged
because public education is conceived
as fundamentally a state function,
?nd it is held that adequate education
Lii opportunity can .be secured only
through a much larger participation
in school support by the larger units.
Darticularly the state. According
figures compiled in the bureau of
education lor the year 1920, the proportions
of school revenues provided
n the country as a whole by the three
important units?state, county and j
ocal district?were 1<'3.8 per cent,'
L1.4 per cent, and 71.G per cent, re- j
spectively. The advocates of a larg-;
:v participation by the state urge \
:hat the state's contribution of 16.8
>er cent should be increased at least
:o one-third of the total, and some
vouid say to 50 per cent or more. !
The respective percentages of
>chool revenues contributed by the
several states as such in 1920 are as
:oilcws:

jtah ; : 31.5
Vermont 1....33.1
Virginia 26.7
Washington 18.1
West Virginia 6.4
Wisconsin 15.6
Wyoming 24.3
These figures show that only 14
states, or less than one-third of
;hem, pay as much as one-fourth- of
;he cost of running their schools, and
:h'it one-half of the states pay as lit;le
as one-sixth, some much less
;han that proportion. Moreover, sta:istical
studies of school funds show
;hat for many years the states' con;ributions
to support have been rela:ivelv
diminishing. This is largely
lue to the fact that districts have had
:rom time to time to vote additional
:ax levies, while state tax rates, many
>f which are fixed in constitutions,
ire more inert, and state appropria:ions
show a similar quality. There
s now a tendency, however, if one
nay judge from legal provisions, to- j
vard larger state contribution. Or, !
Tom another point of view, many of
;he siites are showing a disposition ,
,o "catch up."
States which have in very recent j
j
/ears appreciably increased their j
school tax rates or appropriations are i
Arizona, California, Delaware, Geor- ;
ria, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachu-'
;etts, Mississippi, New York, Penn-j
>ylva:iia. Texas, Utah, Virginia and I
SVashir.gton. The first mentioned i
i
>tate provided state funds sufficient i
:o produce $25 per capita of average '
utendance in .the schools. Califor-!
lia, by initiative act of 1920. added j
< 1 i
53U per capita 01 average attenu-;
iuce to its distributive school fund
md the people of Utah in the same
rear ratified a constitutional amendment
\vh: -h provides a state fund of
>25 per child of school age. Washing- J
:on increased its state fund from $10 j
:o $20 per child of school age. By j
m act of 1910 Georgia set aside fori
education one-half of the proceeds:
:>f the state tax, and Louisiana the
following year adonted a constitu:ional
amendment adding a one-mill
state school levy.
Note that in the percentage of state
flit; supplied South Carolina is next
to- the lowest state in t'*e South, Florida.
while on the other hand, there
are several states in this section
which provide assistance amounting
to onp-third and one-half the tota'
expenditure.
in 1922 South Carolina's percent
agre of state aid was only 12.f.7 pe
cent, as compared with 15.8 in 102U
Some of this reduction is doubtles
due to the course of the legislature o
1922 which materially cut the st^te'
expendiures for the pu:iic schools.
The consensus of opinion anion.'
educa:ors of the nation is thai thi
state as a unit should apply at leas
50 per cent of the public school in
come. Inevitably South Caiolin;
will have to furnish a far greaie
proportion of funds for its school
than j}t present, although that desir
able development will be deferret
for some years on account of advers*
economic conditions now pre vail in;
in the state.
