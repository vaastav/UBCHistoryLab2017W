War Resolution Introduced.
[United Press Leased Wire Service!
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—Senator
Pittman, Nevada, acting for Senator
King, Utah, today introduced in the
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN.
"The worst that can happen to the
detriment of the German people is
that, that if they should still, after
the war 1s over, continue to be
obliged to' live under ambitious and
intriguing masters interested to dis
turb the peace of the world., men or
classes of men whom the other
peoples of the world could not trust,
It might be impossible to admit them
to the partnership of nations Which
must henceforth guarantee the
world's peace. That partnership must
be a partnership of peoples, not a
mere partnership of governments.
It might be impossible, also, in
such untoward circumstances to ad
mit Germany to the free economic
Intercourse which must Inevitably
spring out of the other partnerships
of a real peace. But there would be
no aggression in that and such a
situation, Inevitable because of dis
trust, would in the very nature of
things

tary and commercial autocracy.
"We owe it, however, to ourselves present associates In the war.
to say that we do not wish In any
way to Impair or to rearrange the
Austro-Hung&rian empire. It is no
affair of ours what they do with their
own life, either industrially or poilti
cally. We do not purpose or desire
to dictate to them in any way. We
only desire to see that their affairs
are left in their own hands, in all
matters, great or small. We shall
hope to secure for the peoples of the.
Salkan peninsula and for the people
of the Turkish empire the right and
opportunity to make their own lives
safe, their own fortunes secure
I against oppression or injustice and
from the dictation of foreign courts
I or parties.
a
I "And our attitude and purpose
with-regard to Germany herself are
of a like kind. We intend no wrong
against the German empire, no Inter
ference with her internal affairs. We
should deem either the one or the
other absolutely unjustifiable, abso
lutely contrary to the principles we
have professed to live by and to
hold most sacred throughout our life
as a nation. The people of Germany
are being told by the men whom
they now permit to deceive them and
to act as thefr masters that they are
fighting for the very life and exist
ence of their empire, a war of des
perate self defense against deliberate
aggression. Nothing could be^more
grossly or wantonly false and we
.must seek by the utmost openness
and candor as to our real aims to
convince them of its falseness. We
are in fact fighting for their emanci
pation from fear, along with our own
from the fears as well as from the
fact of unjagrt attack by neighbors or
rivals or ^Sdnemers after world em
pire. No one is threatening the exist
ence or the Independence of the
peaceful enterprises of the German
empire.
or later cure itself, by
processes which,would assuredly set
in.
"The wrongs, the very deep
wrongs committed in this war, will
have to be righted. That, of course.
But they cannot and must not be
righted by the commission of similar
wrongs against Germany and -her
allies. The world will not permit the
commission of similar wrongs as. a
means of reparation and settlement.
Statesmen must by this time have
learned that the opinion of the world
is everywhere wide-awake and fully
comprehends the issues involved. No
representative of any self-governecS)
nation will dare disregard it by at
tempting any such covenants of sel
fishness and compromise as were
entered into at the congress of
Vienna. The thought of the plain
people here and everywhere through
out the world, the people who enjoy
no privilege and have very simple
and unsophisticated standards of
right and wron^, is the air all gov
ernments must henceforth breathe if
they would live. It is In the full
disclosing light of that thought that
all policies must be conceived arid
executed in this midday hour of the
world's life. German rulers have
been able to imset the peace of the
world only because the German
people were not suffered under their
tutelage to share their comradeship
of the other peoples of the world
either in thought or In purpose. They
were allowed to have no opinion of
their own which might be set up as
a rule of conduct for those who exer
cised authority over them. But the
congrefts that cpncludes this war wiU
feel the full strength of the tides
that run now In the hearts and con-
sciences of free men everywhere ,t8 economical develpoment
conclusions will run with those tides f^he
PEOPLE IN THE DARK.
"All
those things have been true 1
from the very beginning of this stu

thinking that if they had been made

had only at a great price. We are
seeking permanent, not temporary
foundations for the peace of the
world and must seek them candk//
and fearlessly. As always, the right
will prove to be the expedient.
"What shall we do, then, to push
this great war of freedom and Jus
tice to its righteous conclusion? We
must clear away with a thorough
hand all impediments to success and
we must make every adjustment of
law that will facilitate the full and
free use of our whole capacity and
force as a fighting unit.
AUSTRIA IS GERMANY'S VASSAL.
"One very embarrassing obstacle
that stands In our way is that we
are at war with Germany, but not
with her allies. I, therefore,»very
earnestly recommend that the con
gress immediately declare the United
States in a state of war with Aus-'
tria-Hungary. Does it seem strange
to you that this should be the con
clusion of the argument
addressed
It is, in fact, the inevitable logic of
what I have said. Austria-Hungary
Is for the time being not her own
mistress, but simply the vassal of
the German government We* must
face the facts as they are and act
upon them without sentiment in this
stern business. The government of
