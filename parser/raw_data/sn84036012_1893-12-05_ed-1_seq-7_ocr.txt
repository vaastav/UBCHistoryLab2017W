the
HIS BUSY, STUDIOUS LIFE
An Acuta and Original Thinker.^Ho Contributed Much to^the Scientific Spirit of^the Times
London.Dec. i.-I'rof. John Tyndall^died at ^^:.*^ p. in. at Hriskeniuro, Surrey,^where ho resided.
Mr.Tnndall vv .is born in the village of^Leighlin Blidce. iralnml, in 1*20, and Ins^earliest ediiration was reeeivcd at a^school in that neiglilx.rliood. Through^the influence of one of his teachers he ac^^quired an early tasto for ireonietry. In^l^fl he quit school and joined the Irish^ordnance survey. Ho acquired a practi^^cal knowledge of every branch of ll, be-^coining in turn a draURhtstnan, a com^^puter, a surveyor and triironoinurtriral^observer. In subse^|iietit years he turned^this experience to admirable account iu^his iiivestigalioiis of Alpine glaciers.
In1K4I an incident occurred which,^although apparently trivial, had a power-^ful etreet upon the young man's career.^One of the officials who had been become^interested in T.vudaH's work uskeil him^one flay how his leisure hours were cm-^ployed. The answer Ix'tng satisfactory,^his answer was: *'Yoit have live hours a^day at your disposal, and this time ought^to he devoted to systematic study. Hud 1^when at your age had a frirml to adviso^me, as 1 now advise you, instead of being^in a subordinate position I might have^been at the head of the survey.^ Next^morning Tyndall was at his books before^^ o'clock, and for 1'J years ha never^swervod from the practice.
In1841, seeing no dellnito prospect be^^fore him. Mr. Tyndull resolved to go to^America, whither, in the early part of the^present century, some members of his^father's family bad emigrated, anil who^now resido in Philadelphia, tine of these^is Hector Tyndale, who distinguished him^^self as an officer in the late war. At An-^tiatam he fought as a major and for Ins^gallant bravery was subsequently mado^brigadier general. This was, however, op^^posed by his friends and an opening^occurring, he entered upon the vocation^of a railroad engineer. To five years upon^the ordinary surrey, succeeded throe years^of railroad experience. Hut this proving^unpromising, and animated hy a strong^desire to augment his knowledge, Mr.^Tyndall resigned his isisition and accepted^an appointment in tjueonswood college,^Hampshire, a new institution devoted^partly to a junior school and partly to the^preliminary technical education of agri^^culturists and engineers.*
ProfessorTyndall hero developed a re-^murkahle capacity as a teacher. Al^^though totally inexperienced in this field,^such was his maguctic influence over the^students that he was invariably called^upon to composo their disturbances,^which he did by moral influence and pure^force of character. It was his exix-nenco^in this institution that gave him tho^ground work of his masterly address on^education before the royal institute. In^1M^, in company with his friend Frank-^land Hum Professor Krankland of the^1 loyal school of chemistry l Tyndall^quilted Kugland and attracted by the^fame of Professor Hunscn. repaired to the^university of Marburg, iu Hesse-Cassei.^Professor Tyndali had the free use of tho^laboratory and cabinets of this institution^with the instructions of Hiiusen. ti 'rling.^Knoblauch and Steglun. His first scien^^tific paper was a mathematical essay on^screw surfaces, which formed the subject^of his inaugural dissertation a lien he look^his flegree.
Hutthe investigation which first mado^him known to the scientific world was^^On tho Magne-Optic Properties of^Crystals, and tho delation of Magnetism^and Diamagnctisin to Molecular Arrange^^ment. ^ This investigation was executed^in connect ion w ith Professor Knoblauch^and was published in tho Philiutophical^Matjnzinr for MM In MM Mr. Tyndall^went to Berlin Mi coutinuod his re^^searches in tho laboratory of Professor^Magnus. Ho soon, however, returned to^London and was elected fellow of tho^Koyal society in 1KV2. He was invited to^give a Friday evening discourse at tho^royal institution, which lie delivered on^Fob. 14, 1853. and was so successful^that he was at once offered a position in^that establishment. His election to tho^appointment of professor of natural phi^^losophy at the royal institution was unan^^imously made in Juno, 1853, and he held^^t to his death. The first three years of^his residence in London he devoted to an^exhaustive study of diamagnetism, the re^^sults of ^ Inch wcr e published in variou^memoirs that have since been collected^in a volume.
ProfessorTyndall was first attracted to^the Alps in IM!i for tho solo object of^healthful recreation and exercise. Hut^ha could nut be long iu the presence of^the grand physical phenomena there dis^^played without liecoiuing interested in^the scientific questions they present. Ac^^cordingly for more than 'JO years the Alps^have served tho double purpose to Pro^^fessor Tyndall of physical and mental re-^invigoratioti, after lieing run down by his^London work. And at the same timo tiiey^have furnished him with a scries of the^most interesting scientific problems. In^company with his friends. Professor Hux^^ley anil Professor Hirst, and often alone,^usually in summer, but sometimes in^winter, he has climbed the mountains^anil expjorcd the glaciers to clear up tho^various quest ions tltat have arisen and^extend our knowledge of the subject. The^description of his adventures and tho^results of his researches were embodied^ill his volume on tho glaciers of tho Alps,^now out of print.
ProfessorTvtidall has won his scientific^reputation as an explorer in the^field of experimental physics, but ho^has also a commanding position ns^a philosophic thinker. The ques^^tions that can be resolved by^experiment lead on to the questions that^can f'e resolved by reason. Philosophy is^old and easy and the human mind has^overflowed with it from tho beginning|^but philosophy grounded in the knowledge^and nieth'sl of science is ns yet rare,^though it is neverthe|es^ n glorious reality.^If scientific thinking is tiie result of an^apprenticeship of centuries in the man^^agement of the intellect and if the mind^sufficient action is its must perfect action,^then must scientific men as the world goes^on be more and more trusted in^their opinions. Such undoubtedly is the^present tendency. This ia shoo u gener
allyin tbe increasing recognition of the^scientific school of philosophy and It is^specially exemplified in the present case^by the interest that is taken in whatever^Professor Tyndall had to say to the public^and whatever the subject on which be^^poke. This high scientific position^fives acknowledged weight and force to^his views. Professor Tyudall's philosophic^cast of mind not only attracted him to the^deeper questions of the tune, but his cour^^ageous temper led him to deal with them^candidly and fearlessly.

N.vNFuAMTscii. |^i-c. 4. The revenue^cutter Corwin is under special orders for^a -.'.'^i mile trip. Her destination is^Honolulu w ithout it doubt. Whether any^person in diplomatic authority is coining^here from Washington logo to the islands^is not known. It is quite likely, how ever,^that a special messenger is entrusted w ith^secrets of state. The groale.t secrecy has^been maintained since the special orders^arrived at Saturday noon. These turned^tho cutler over to the state department,^and placed her under waiting orders.
Washington,Dec. 4.^ (^reshain dr^-^clincd this morning to talk in regard to^the published report that the revenue cut^^ter Corwin was to carry a message for the^state department from San Francisco to^Honolulu, (ireshaiu was busy yesterday^with dispatches w hicli are to go on the^Corw in. As to what these contain noth^^ing can be learned. The fact of dispatch^^ing the Corwin so hastily leads to the sur^^mise that tho administration has changed^its policy toward tho islands.

1ne convent.on w .11 bo held in Social^hall to-morrow evening and there is a^great deal of speculation iu regard to the^probable candid ales. John lSnekley, T.^W. Klllott and Dennis Driscoll are the^gentlemen most talked of for mayor and^the nomination probably lies between^them w uh their chances all about even.^It was belioved yesterday that Mr. I'.lliotl^had the inside track and that his nomina^^tion was certain, but tho others have^craw led up on him to-day and it is out of^the question to attempt to pick tho winner^to-night.
Furpolice magistrate Evan Herbert and^M. C. Holland are running a neck and^necK race, but the latter thinks that his^chances for securing the nomination aro^the best. O. M. Hall for city attorney and^George Dent for city treasurer will hav^^^no opitosition, although tho name of J. A.^Shiftman has been spoken of iu connec^^tion with the latter ollleo to-day and his^friends are confident that he could bo^elected.
Foraldermen, John Rich seems to have^things all bis own way in tbo First ward^and he will probably be nominatisl by^acclamation John Hamilton, Sum Mai-^thews and T. W. Klliott ur^^ being talked^of iu the Second and William Dolling^and Frank Coll iu the Third. The plat^^form which will be adopted to-morrow^night will pledge all the candidates to^serve without compensation and to con^^duct the affairs of the city, if elected, w ith^the most rigid economy. Prominent^members or the independent puny said^to-night that they will promise to bring^the tax levy flown to L'U mills lor the next^year it it can possuily be done, and they^will guarantee that It will not lie more^tliintlireeiudls.it the outside if their^party carries the election. The indciMMid-^ent party is made up mainly of republicans,^w nil a few democrats and some populists^w ho have abandoned the populist ranks^lor reasons best known to themselves.^There w ill be tio politic* in tho new party,^however, and men will be selected for the^differoni offices without any considera^^tion as to what their past political ntlilia-^tions have been. The independents are^conllden, of carrying the election, as they^have the solid support of tho ^big three.^^Superintendent.-. Hall, ^ lark and Kiteger.

Mr. (h* sen's black ami tan fox^terrier. Mike, had gone mad. Mrs. tllsen^had K.id o\ or t ho telephone, and had^bitten lil, It* lalgar. Mr. OlMfl went home^as fast as his brown pacer could carry^him. lb- was all excitement as ho rushed^into the house ami called to his w ife.
*'Whore's my gun 7^ he yelled. ** That^dog shan't b\o another minute.*'
Mr.Olson was so excited lie did not^even wait to examine his little boy, who^was then in the hands [of a doctor. Ho^halm) his revolver ami went after the dog.^With the revolver cocked and ready for^action Mr. Olson ran around the house^and came upon the dog m the angle made^by the fence and the barn. Ho was so ex^^cited that be pulh-d the trigger before he^got close enough for a good aim. 'The^bullet lodged iu a fence In.ard. 'The re^^volver Came to full cock again.
Thentli ^ dog woke up. Ho was still^mad and not a bit afraid of Mr. Olson's^revolver. Ho didn't run an Inch-just^maueu\cn^^l a little. 'The dog jumped^and dodged w hile Olson tried to tnk*k aim.^Roth shifted their (rosiiioiis. 'The dog got^out of the corner and Mr. Olson into it.^'J hen the dog followed up his advantage.
Mr.Olson was just ut^out to pull the^trigger a second tun** ami end tbe life of^ttte dog. At that instant the terrier^jumped at Mr. Olson. He missed Olson's^arm, and his teeth closed on tho revolver.^'The sudden lies* of the attack disconcerted^the dog's enemy. 'The four-footed tighter^ga\o a w reneh at tho gun ami took it from^the man w ho would have killed him w ith^it.
Thegun safe in Ins possession, the dog^bore no animosity to Olson. Holding th^^^weapon lirmly iu his teeth, the bl.ick-aud-^tau ran oil.
Olsonwas niadder than ever. His sou^h.ol been bitten and In* himself had been^.tiaarmcd by that dog. Olson ran dow n^llalstead street to Belmont avenue and^told OflMI dallaghcr ami Miller what^the dog had done to him. Then the offi^^cer-- started after the dog.

There wat nothing^left this morning of the firmness with^w hich the stock market closed Saturday,^speculation was weak and sympathised^with the heaviness of the London market^for American securities. The publication^of tho president's message in London in^advance of delivery to congress gave the^street knowledge of its contents, and tbe^fact that it made no mention of a contem^^plated bond issue w as regarded as a bear^point and helped to deprecate values.^The November statement of tbe St. Paul^road, show ing a decrease in earnings, was^another factor iu the general depression.^London was in the market aa a seller of^St. Paul, Atchison. Union Pacific and^Louisville A Nashville, and the West sent^in a number of selling orders. The gen^^eral market opened a fraction lower, and^iu early dealings the dwlme ranged % to^J.
