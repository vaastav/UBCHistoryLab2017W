Well, wouldn't tlie office still be just

Germany ought to be able to -live it
wliile on the food slie didn't feed her
prisoners of war.
*Jt is quite evident that Germany
doesn't regard the armistice as a mere
scrap of paper.

.hAA'o hope the allies over in Europe
will not mistake the display of the
presidential party as an exhibition of
the kind of democracy for which we
have beeu fighting.
The allies over in Europe, accord
ing to the Associated Press, are going
to charge Mr. Hoheuzollern with being
a pirate and .demand his surrender by
Holland. According to iiilornational
law a pirate is entitled to the protec
tion of no country. If William is not
a pirate what is he?
There are many people throughout
the country wlio are sorry it wasn't
Baker instead of McAdoo that found it
impossible to liVe on $12,000 a year.
Then there is Burleson, too. who could
be readily spared. In fact, McAdoo
is really the oiie man of the cabinet
who is regarded as big enough for the
job he holds.
The Springfield, Mass., Republican
is wondering what we are going to do
for news after the war interest lags.
No need to worry about that. Some
years ago the attorney general of Iowa,
we believe it was Remley, decided in
determining a question of taxation that
a newspaper office is a manufacturing
plant. Well, there are still many news
paper offices throughout the country
and they can manufacture just as well
in time of i»eace as in time of war.
It was not through disrespect that
some republicans in congress snickered
the other day when the president was
reciting his message and came to the
words: "I frankly turn to you for
counsel." That struck them so unex
pectedly and sounded so excruciatingly
funny that they couldn't keep straight
faces. Some*iftf tlieni, it is reported,
stuffed handkerchiefs in their mouths,
but were unable lo suppress the laugh
ter that burst forth in spite of tlie
solemnity of the occasion. But, at
that, they should have been taken to
the cloak room mid spanked. The
president was not joking, even though

The vote of the Iowa soldiers in
uniform is more laregl.v republican
than the vote of the civil population.
The total soldier vote at the recent
election at the various posts and can
tonments was r»,!51. Gov. Hardiug
received 4.101 and Claude R. Porter
1.H03. The vote for Senator Kenyon
was 4,171 and for his opponent l,r»18.
The republican candidate for lieuten
ant governor received and the
democratic candidate 1,711. Thus the
men in the field put the lie direct to
the partisan claim that the democratic
party won the war.
President Wilson frankly admits in
his late message to' congress that he
doesn't know what to do with the rail
roads. He asks congress to solve the
problem and solve it as soon as possi
ble. Uncertainty is detrimental and

The kind the boys
all like
what course the, government is going
to pursue. The president suggests
three alternatives: -'^To hand the lines
back under former .methods of regu
lation: complete government owner
ship and operation, or modified private
control under unitiet management, and
regulation and control." Complete
ownership and operation-will be advo
cated by many. However, the-financial
condition of the government following
the great war may le conclusive argu
ment against that p&liey at this time,
hence the third method suggested by
the president may be the better for the
present. The greatest advantage of
government ownership, it appears to
many, is the influence upon labor em
ployed. Railroad men would not strike
if the government owned the roads,
thus insuring continuous and unbroken
service at all times.
