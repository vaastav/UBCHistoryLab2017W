Corresj»ondence of the Salem Or. Statesman, j
The iron horse of the O. P. R. R. |
Co. leaped the North Santiam and |
landed in Marion county about 12
o'clock m. today. The work is pro
grossing as well as could be expected
and it is the intention to push it

The roadbed, except the bridges, is
nearly all finished up to Breiten
bush, a distance of eighteen miles.
There is a framing yard estab
lished at this place and the Santiam
Milling Co. has a contract to furnish
the lumber to build the bridges be
tween here and Breitenbush inclu
sive. With the efficient manage
of the Superintendent of Bridges
Frank Miller and D. M. Large, his
foreman, and his various gangs of
bridge workers, the work will
move right along, for they are men
of experience and push. I wish to
state here that your correspondent j
was mistaken who wrote n y »ur last
issue from Rock Creek that the only
thing that would retard the arrival
of the train up to that place would
be Santiam bridgt'. The facts are,
the track layers were not delayed a
minute on account of the bridge, but
it was ready for them and pro
nounced a fine structure by compe
tent judges.
The Santiam Milling Co. are in
fine spirits and their new mill is
turning out lots of lumber and of an
excellent quality. They have not
got all their machinery in as yet but
they have got one of the finest water
powers in the state, and ultimately
will have a fine mill and one that
will do all they want it to do. We
also can thank Uncle Sam for a post
office and try-weekly mail. Should
anv of vou fellows at the capita
want to consult us up here in regard j
to any measure that requires pro
found thought during the coming
legislation we have a telegraph ollicc
here.
The proprietor of Mill City, Mr.
Rice has been confincd to his bed for
several days with something similar
to paralysis, but is improving now.
If the capitalists of Salem would
come up here and look around it
might be beneficial to them finan
cially.
FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT

The construction train now stands
on the south side and to-morrow will
cross into Mill City. Vice President
Nash, Mr. Hoag, general manager
and Chief Engineer Schneck arrived
in a special car on the south side of

the Santiam and proceeded OU horse

back from Mill City to the front.,
The Santiam Lumbering Company
has finished the lower story of their
saw mill and have sawed out tini
bers for the finishing of the mill and
are now engaged sawing timbers for
the O. P. R. R. Co. Mr. Brown the
owner of the saw mill on the south
side has filled his contract for Drung
bridge and Santiam bridge at Mill
City and is now engaged in sawing
lumber for the Breitenbush bridge
and those at Little and Big Santiam.
The 0. P. company pays on the
20th of each month, by so doing all
men engaged on the construction of
the road are satisfied, consequently
you hear no more grumbling.
O'Connor & Barr, contractors, paid
on the 24th. Mr. Brown paid his saw
mill crew on the 23d.
It seems that the vigilance com
mittee that warned the Thomas boys
to leave last May and, on their re
fusing to comply with the request,
shot and wounded Charles Thomas,
have come to the conclusion that
Mill City would be benefited by the
absence of Dave Hoeye and his son
Waiter, and have notified him to
that effect.

The lant session of the 50th Con
gress convened on Monday of this
week.
Twenty-seven engineers and fire
man on the Montana Union rail
road are on a strike. As the im
mense mining interests at Butte
and vicinity are dependent upon
this road the situation is one of ex
treme gravity. The Anaconda
company has closed down four
mines laying off 300 men. The
10,000 laboring men of that section
are greatly excited.

The necessity of the reduction of:
our revenue is so apparent as to be
generally conceded but the meatiB

be no scheme accepted as satisfac
tory by which the burdens oi the

utmost importance. There should
people are only apparently remov
ed. Extravagant appropriations of
public money with all their demor

tolerated either as a means of re

lieving the treasury of its present
surplus or as lurnishing a pretext
for resisting a proper reduction ot
tariff rates. There should be no

Few persons, perhaps, are aware

Prohibitory Const it at ional
Amendment.
prohibitory amendment to the con
stitution of the United States, and
a still less number have no knowl
edge of the present status of the
movement.
Many will be surprised to learn
that a joint resolution to this end
, , "" , . n r\
has been reported from t.ie CO
mittee on Education and Labor to
ii TT ci ci a , , 1 , j•
the U. S. Senate, anu tnat action
on the subject will be taken earlv
J .
in the present session.
To influence this action favorable
to the cause of prohibition the la
dies of the W. C. T. U. of Caldwell
and of other Unions throughout
the country, are this week asking
for signatures to petitions for the
above-named object, which will be
presented to the Senate.
The following extract from a Leaf
let of the W. C. T. U., shows the
liberal spirit in which t ie Senate
committee acted:
"In submitting this favorable re
port upon the aforesaid joint reso
lution it is proper to say that there
are members of the committee who
concur in the report recommending
the submission of the proposed
amendment to the states who do
not, by such action, indicate their
approvol of the adoption of the
amendment as a part of the Con
stitution; but in deference to the
immense mass of petitions for this
amendment of the organic law, com
ing from the people in all parts of
country, deem a refusal to submit
the proposed amendment to the
states for consideration analagous
to the denial of the right of a party
to be heard in court upon a ques
tion of private right"

The wonvans story is this: u My hus

started East with the money in a

Illinois, where my grandfather lives.,
we made the acquaintance of a man
named Richard Stough, who said he
was going to New York and would
accompany us. We arrived in New
York all right, and there Stough
whom we had told about the money-,
advised us to take it to a bank and
have it changed to currency, as it
could be carried easier. We took
the money, and, in company with
the man, went to some bank
where we had the money changed
into currency. We placed it in the
satchel, which we locked, and by
i advice of the banker and Stough, we

Oil in the West.

Colorado bids fair to vie with Wy

Pueblo, a number of wells have been
bored, and the yield of petroleum is
estimated at 1,000 barrels a day*

Rocky Mountain belt will supply the
world with oil. The constant drain
on the petroleum wells of Ohio and
