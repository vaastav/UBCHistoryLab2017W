Going to Chicago.
ia
to
Dick West, the well and favora
bly known Ketchum restaurateur,
up from Hailey on Wednes
day to settle np some business,
preparatory to leaving for Chicago.
Dick goes to Chicago for the pur
pose, he says, of opening a restau
rant an the World's Fair grounds,
from which we conclude that the
following from the St. Louis Globe
Democrat must be an error, or that
Dick and the Gage Hotel Company
are identical. If the latter be cor
rect we can't see why Dick didn't
call it the West Hotel Company
he would have then been sure of
all of Ketchum's patronage at the
Fair, but he couldn't stuff our boys
with a 15-cent layout on a four dol
lar basis, as indicated below; it
might take in the green eastern
seekers, but the Idahoans are up to
snuff in such matters. The Globe
Democrat says : "Living will come
mighty high at the World's Fair.
One restaurant concern, the Gage
Hotel Company, was given the con
cession to-day (Dec. 3) for operat
ing all the cafes in the World's
Fair buildings. The contract gives
it a monopoly of the restaurant
business, with the exception of the
foreign eating houses, to be run in
connection with certain foreign dis
plays. This monopoly, like all
others, will exact outrageous prices.
It is by all odds the biggest con
cession granted by the Fair. A
man with a robust appetite is lucky
if his meal in one of the "bong tong'»
him less than $5, and
vill find no trouble
, $4 for a dinner in
came
te
m payT _
one of the "cheap" restaurants. As
the Gage people expect to feed 10,
000 to 12,000 people at a sitting,
they ought to experience no diffi
culty in clearing a fourtune every
day. Visitors who have not pre
viously mortgaged their estate will
do well to come with their pockets
filled with eatables."

Mining Stock Wanted.
A Michigan man, who evidently
has a strong desire to go into the
mining business, advertises in the
Salt Lake Mining Journal for min
ing stock. His capital consiste of
three St. Bernard brood bitches
and one pup. The mining stock
must be gilt edge, or no trade. This
is a good chance for some of our
dividend paying mines to dispose
of a block of their stock and go in
to the dog raising industry. We
are not informed how the term
"wild cat" became attached to min
ing schemes, but it is reasonable
to suppose that some fellow traded
stock for a herd of wild
mining
cats, and if this theory is correct
the east will soon be flooded with
"dog mining schemes" and the
entire crop of eastern dogs will be
dumped into the mining states as
a circulating medium, and it will
be nothing uncommon to see a
prospector go to the store with a
pocket full of poodles to purchase
his winter supplies. Whether the
adoption of the Rothschild's plan
would be better than this is a
question, although it has not as
many commendable features.
The best indication that holidays
are close at hand is 6een at the
Post Office store of E. B. Williams.
Mr. Williams has anticipated the
desires of the little ones, and the
larger ones also, in the selection ol
his holiday stock. The usual toys,
dolls, etc., are of course to be had,
and as specialties in this line he has
stone building blocks which are in
structive as well as entertaining to
the young, also the everlasting rub
ber dolls, balls, and other rubber
play things. There is also an unique
display of Japanese novelties and
fine jewelry. Those anticipating
purchasing presents will undoubt
edly be suited by a visit to the
Post Office Store.
Col. Cody (Buffalo Bill), accom
panied by the British nabobs, in
quest of a selection of land for
a hunting ground, are now in Salt
Lake city. The distinguished party
created a sensation in Zion by dash
ing through the streets in an ele
gant six-horse equipage. The gen
tlemen are not disposed to be at all
communicative as to their plans of
a purchase of lands for the happy
i nti-ig j. *ound. They will make
, s,, ificti u of the location cither in
i C ah Cel irado or Arizona.

▲ War Trophy Returned.
During the past summer the Bos
ton Globe published the following
dispatch dated
Florida :
Henry B. Hinton of McBae, Clay coun
ty, Fla., baa a »word captured by him at
Gainesville, Aug. 17, 1864, which he
wiahea to return to it? legal owner. It
ia marked u Jos. W. Martin." Hinson be
lieves he took the sword from a captain
of a Massachusetts cavalry company.
Hinson was a Confederate, but is anxious
to return the sword to the mau he took it
from or bis heirs.
George W. Morton, of Quincy,
Mass., who was a paymastertn the
United States Navy, seeing the item
in the Globe, wrote Mr. Hinson
that if the sword was marked "Jos.
William Morton" it belonged to
his brother who was a capUin in
the 4th Massachusetts Cavalry, and
who was taken prisoner at Gaines
ville about that time, but whe had
died since then. Corresponcfnce
brought out the fact that the lame
was Morton instead of Martin,and
Mr. Hinson recently relinquiffied
the sword to Mr. George Morpn.
Captain Morton, the one who bst
the sword, was a brother-in-law of

The state board of canvassers mi
again at Boise, Monday, all the rei
turns being in, but on investigationfvened
it was found that the returns from tinal
the counties of Bingham, Cassia, the
Idaho, Latah and Logan were de
fective in that they were not prop-J
erly certified to, the names of the I not
respective county commissioners we
not eppearing thereon. The mem
bers of the board were in a quan- &re
ary. They felt satisfied that the still
commissioners had affixed their and
signature as members of the county the
board of commissioners to the orig
nal returns, and the clerks in each
of the counties in question in mak
ing a copy to send to the state
board had omitted to transcribe
the names. To some of the mem
bers of the board it seemed that
the defect, being in form and not
in substance, was not material. Af
ter much discussion it was decided
to send to the clerks of the counties
concerned and secure new returns,
properly certified to. The defective
returns will be kept, and should the
corrected returns not be returned
by the 14th, the date set by law
when the returns shall be counted
whether they are all in or not, they
will, in all probability be counted.

The Supreme Court, says the
Boise Statesman, has issued two al
ternative writs ot mandamus against
Wesley B. George, auditor of Logan
county, commanding him to ap
pear in court on Monday, Decem
ber 19lh, and show cause why he
should not issue certificates of elec
tion to John C. Cunningham and
James Otterson, who ran on the
Populist ticket for commissioners
in Logan county and who claim
they each received a plurality of
the votes cast in that county for
the positions. This again brings
up the Logan county commissioner
case. The vote for commissioners
in that county was counted by dis
tricts instead of county, and the
two relators were counted out and
two republicans given certificates.
The writ was applied for some time
ago, but the matter was remanded
to the district court of Logan coun
ty. It not being in session, the
supreme court concluded to take
the matter up.
The Philadelphia Public Ledger,
G. W. Childs' paper, was destroyed
b) f fire on the 6th inst. The fire
gutted the building, destroying all
the material excepting the presees
which were damaged to the amount
of $25,000. The entire loss is over
$250,000, with $160,000 insurance.
Mr. Childs distributed $5000 be
tween the firemen for saving the
walls of the building. The Ledger
had another complete office, ex
cepting presses, in another building
from which the paper will be is
sued by the use of the Record's
presses, which was tendered Mr.
Childs as were the use of the other
presses in the city.

Caldwell Tribune: First blood
for Canyon county. The question
of division came squarely
the district court at Boise this week.
Twelve men summoned on the
grand jury resided in the county of
Canyon, and Judge Nugent, in spite
of the protests of Boise City attor
neys that no such county existed
under the law, dismissed them.
Before Ada county was divided
there were twelve postoffices in the
county. Now there are two in Ada
county and ten in Canyon county.
There were five towns in old Ada ;
now there is one in Ada and four in
Canyon.-Two children of Mr.
and Mrs. J. C. Bernard of the Snake
river ferry died this week of diph
theria, and others are down with
the dread disease.-The Tribune
printed the court calendar this week
in and for Ada county. Court con
before
last Monday with two crim
tinal cases and 110 civil cases on
the docket. There are twenty-one
actions for divorce, which fact
shows that either Idaho climate is
not conducive to connubial bliss or
we are wresting from Dakota her
laurals as a divorce machine. There
&re thirty-six actions for debt, and
still we have people who stand up
and say more money would ruin
the couutry. The remaining fifty
three cases are insolvency, foreclo

Coeur d'Alene Miner; The Helena
& Frisco Mining company has filed
with the board of commissioners a
claim of upwards of $50,000 on ac-
count of the damage done it in the
destruction of its mill in the riot
at Gem last July. It is not our in-
tention at this time to discuss the
merits of the claim. There are some
precedents in favor of the claim
and there may be some against it.
It is made on the ground that it is
the duty of the people of the coun-
ty through their officers to protect
property, at least to make reasona-
ble effort in that direction. If the
commissioners do not allow the
claim suit will probably be com-
menced, and the county will have
long and expensive fight to make,
with the possibility of having to
pay at last. In any event the tax-
payer» are likely to have impressed
upon them that rlotB are expensive
to the county as well as individuals.
-A number of Wallace people
have announced their intention of
going to the Slocan country iu the
spring. No doubt that country pos-
sesses much merit and its prospects
are certainly very encouraging, but
they should remember that when
they leave the Cœur d'Alenes they
turn their backs upon a tried and
determined quantity for an uncer-
tain one. There is such a thing as
"swimming a stream to get a drink,"
and there is much more of this kind
of work done than the world is
aware of. The brightest days are
yet to come in this great silver-lead
belt.

A Dead Man.
In an uninhabited house within
a mile of Salmon City a dead man
was found by the children of James
Compton who resides but a few
hundred yards distant. Mr. Comp
ton at once informed the coroner
whe summoned a jury, and pro
ceeded to inspect the body.
It was identified as a man bear
ing the name of Gavorty, who had
lately been cooking at Shenon's
mill. A bottle with a little lauda
num in it was found and recognized
by Dr. Kenney as having come
from his drug store. The position
of the body, and after stripping
proved conclusively that he had
come to his death at his own hands.
No effects were found on his body
at all. He had a check cashed for
$85 three days prior to the finding
of his body. Mental aberration is
all that the jury could arrive at in
their verdict of premeditated sui
cide as he had told repeatedly that
he should kill himself.—Salmon

The President's Message.
The annual message of the Presi
dent of the United States was de
livered to Congress at noon on
Tuesday. President Harrison con
fine« his message to a review of the
achievements ol' the Republican
party for the past thirty years, and
attributes the prosperity during
that period to the action of a pro
tective tariff which he still advo
cates as the only true principle of
government, but to it he lays the
blame of the defeat of his party.
On the silver question the Presi
dent has but little to 6ay, though
he admits the necessity of silver as
money. His only recommendation
in the message is that no action be
taken on the silver question until
after the Monetary Conference has
concluded its labors. As a state
document the message has but lit
tle force, but as a political or cam
paign paper it is an excellent ex
emplification of the principles of
his party, and an eulogoy of l is
own administration.
The Death of Jay Gould.
The famous financial and rail
road king is no more. He breathed
his last Friday morning, December
2d, at his palatial home in New York
city. The cause of his death was
pulmonary consumption contract
ed from a severe cold. Jay Gould
was a quiet, unassuming man, and
despised notoriety of any kind.
His close personal friends claim
that he bestowed many charities
during late years that the world
never heard of, which statement
will doubtless change the public
sentiment, as he was publicly re
garded during bis life as a selfish,
uncharitable man. He was 56 years
of age, and left a. fortune of $100,
000,000. George Gould will suc
his father in the management of the
extensive financial business affairs.
