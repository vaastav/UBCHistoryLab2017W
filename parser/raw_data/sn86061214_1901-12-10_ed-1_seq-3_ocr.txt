Chariton,
Charlton, Dcc. 0.—A very pretty
home wedding was performed at the
home of county auditor J. O. Becker,
when Rev. Miller of the M. -E. church
pronounced the words that united the
lives and hearts of Miss Fay Becker
and Arthur Curtis, two of Chariton's
most pppular young peopl
e. The house
was prettly decorated with ferns and
cut flowers. The table decorations
were green and white. The ceremony
was performed in the presence of about
forty-five invited guests, the bride and
groom being unattended. They came
down the stairs to the strains of a wed
ding march and took their places on
a white fur rug before the large west
window of the house where the mar
riage vows were taken, while the or
gan played softly the while after the
ceremony the young couple received
the congratulations of the assembled
guests. A dainty three-course wed
ding supper was served. The bride is
a charming and accomplished young
woman, a graduate of the public
schools and possessed of all those, wo
manly traits which go to make up a
good wife, and has gained for her the
large circle of friends she now enjoys.
The groom is the oldest son of Mr. and
Mrs. J. H. Curtis, is also a graduate
of the Chariton schools, has been a suc
cessful traveling salesman and-is now
employed in the railroad offices at the
depot, where he is admired and re
spected by all who come in contact
with him. Both young people were
raised in Chariton and will make this
place their home, having rented a
house in Orchard addition. They have
the best wishes of a host of friends.

MRS. IDA t. R0SER,
Grand-Niece of Ex-President James
K. Polk, Writes to Mrs. Pinkham.
Thankful for Health Restored by Lydia E Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound.
Did you ever stop to realize what keen satisfaction one experiences when
vre find that some kind and helpful thing we have done for some one else has
been sincerely appreciated At Euch times, how truly we understand the ex
pression it is more blessed to give than to receive."
Think, therefore, of the pleasure an4 genuine satisfaction Mrs. Pinkham
experiences when such letters come to her as the one from Mrs. Roser which
we are herewith permitted to publish.
Think what it means to her it means first, that one more loveljr woman
has been relieved from sickness and distress through her assistance it means
second, that this woman who is cured is-so grateful that she wants other
women in the land to know of it and it means lastly that Mrs. Pinkham'ai
claims for Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound are fully sub-t
stantiated bv testimony of such high character that every woman who reads
this must believe and hope.
To be appreciated is a great pleasure, but to bring peace and happiness to
the Buffering is heavenly. Such is the mission of Mrs. Pinkham, and such fc
letter as the following proves her success 1
MRS. IDA L. ROSER, 326 E. 18th Ave., Denver, Col.
Grand-niece of ex-President James K. Polk, and Assistant Grand Secretary of
Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico Independent Order
of Good Templars.
DEAR MRS. PINKHAM I have been married for nearly two years,
and so far have not been blessed with a child. I have, however, suf
fered with a complication of female troubles and painful menstruation,
until very recently.
The value of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound was
•called to my attention by an intimate friend, whose life had simply been
a torture with inflammation and ulceration, and a few bottles of your
Compound cured her: she can hardly believe it herself today1, she en
joys such blessed health. I took four bottles of your Compound and
consider myself cured. I am once more in fine health and spirits ,'
domestic and official duties all seem easy now, for I feel so strong I can
do three times what I used to do. You have a host of friends in Den
ver, and among the best count. Yours very gratefully,—MRS. IDA J*
F.OSER, 326 18th Ave., Denver, CQI."
When a medicine lias been successful in restoring to health
so many -women whose testimony is so unquestionable, you cannot
well say, without trying it, I do not believe it will help me." If
you are ill, don't hesitate to get a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound at once, and write Mrs. Pinkham, Lynn,
Mass., for special adviee it is free and always helpful.
