AGAIN INVOKES POWER
IN EFFORT TO
Indianapolis, Dec. 3 The United
States Government again today in
voked the power of the Federal Courts
in an effort to end the soft coal strike.
Informations charging contemnt of
j court were filed in the Federal Dis
trict" Court here against four Interna
tional and district . officers of the
United Mine Workers of America,
who are charged with conspiring to
keep the strike in effect, thus violating
the injunction.
Dan W. Simms, special Federal Dis
trict : Attorney, in charge of enforce
ment of the injunction said the cases
will be pushed and that today's action
was only a start. He said certain dis
trict officers have been paying out
strike benefits and in such cases even
the banKs that honored the checks for
this purpose are liable to prosecution
for contempt of court.
Acting President Lewis 1 and other
Miners officials, who were here, were
notified and agreed to report in court
tomorrow to furnish bond fixed at
Ten Thousand dollars. Officials away
from here will be served as soon as
possible.
It became known yesterday a mass
of evidence against alleged violators
of the injunction against the strike is
sued by United States District Judge

of the Department of Justice and that

GREAT AREA IN
SOUTH TICK FREE
Over Fifty Thousand Square
. Miles Reclaimed from Tick
Fever in Year.
(By GEORGE H. MANNING)
Washington, Dec. 3. Over fifty
thousand square miles in the southern
states have been reclaimed in the past
year from the cattle fever tick the
worst enemy of live stock in the
South the bureau of animal industry,
department of agriculture, announced
today.
By an order effective December 1st,
the agricultural department releases
46,921 square miles in Georgia, . Ala
bama, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas
from the federal quarantine against
the movement of tick infested cattle.
This is in addition to 3,624 square
miles released on September 15.
Alabama leads the list with 12,991
square miles placed in the unrestricted
area. The other states are Louisiana,
with 9,299 square miles; Texas, with
8.847; Arkansas with 8,130; Georgia
with 6, 942, and Oklahoma with 4,346.
No releases were ordered for Florida
or North Carolina but active work is
going on in' those states in, prepara
tion for" strong cattle tick campaigns
next year.'
The 1919 releases do not make this
year, in point of actual territory placed
in the free area, the greatest year for
tick eradication, but they do mean a
great amount of consolidation work,
ithat is. take out cqunties here and
there from the quarantined area.
A very successful campaign against
the cattle ticks has been waged since
1906 when the ticks threatened to en
tirely eradicate the cattle herds in the
southern states. In 1906 the quaran
tine line extended all the way from
Virginia to Texas and reappeared in
California. The battle with the ticks
since then has driven them entirely
out of California, Missouri. Kentucky,
Tennessee, South Carolina and Missis
sippi. The great work done in Alabama
this year, resulting in the removal of
; v
the quarantine entirely from eleven
states and practically from seven others
is the result of work under the state
wide tick-eradication law, which be
came effective last spring.
Officials"of the bureau of animal in
dustry regard this year's progress as
encouraging and see in the results
added reason for believing the tick will
be completely driven from American
soil within a few years. State and
innimtv ffir5ala nrl farmers And live
Utock owners generally have co-oper-
ated in good fashion with the bureau
force. The menace of the tick and
what the parasite has meant in annual
damage of at least $40,000,000 to the
southern live-stock industry appears
to be well recognized. The steady ad
vnnpa nf the work Is shown bv the
factrthat in 1906, 728,565 square miles
were tick infested, while the Decem
ber releases will bring the area freed
j from quarantine to 509,084 square miles
or 70 per cent of the area orlganally
placed under restrictions.
The areas freed from the tick
are placed in position to proceed with
the development of their beef cattle
raising and dairying industries with
out paying an annual tribute to the
cattle parasite. Better cattle can be
brought in without fear that they will
contract the deadly fever that is carried
by the tick. That tick eradication
pays has been answered affirmatively
in every community freed of ticks by
better cattle, better agriculture in gen
eral, better prices, and higher real es
tate values.
In Alabama the following counties
are released from quarantine: Butler.
Covington. Chilton, Escambia. Frank
lin, Geneva, Lawrence. Marlon and
Winston, the remainder of Perry and
Marshall, and a portion of Calhoun,
Cherokee. Cleburne. Saint Clair, Mo
bile. Shelby and Bibb.
The Georgia counties released are:
All of Calhoun. Caroll, Chatham, Clay.
Colquitt, Early, Jones, Marlon, Miller,
Monroe, Schley," Screven, Sumter, Tift,
Turner, Twiggs. Webster and Wilkin
son. : ' ' ' :.. . . -" . '..:' ' - .
Choctow county and about five
sixths of Houston - county, Alabama,
are to be requarantined because the
county officers have failed to enforce
the quarantine law properly,, agricul
tural department officials say. .

U. S. ATTORNEY BUSY
Mr. Neely Advises All Concern

Rules As Published. -
Notice of important modifications
of the fuel conservation rules and reg-
ulations promulgated by the regional
coal committee of Atlanta and given
publicity in the press yesterday, was
received-in this city last night from
the committee. These modification:!
have especial reference to the opening
and closing of stores and other business
places. ; -
Copy of the message which was sent
out to supercede and cancel paragraphs
four of the rules and interpretations,
promulgated Tuesday night and pub
lished yesterday morning, wa3 re
ceived by W. C. Dillard. local port of-'
ficer for the committee and furnished
to the press, as suggested. The svp
plement says: . '. " , . v : ; '
- With the hope of -reducing- to the .;
minimum consistent with safely, the--discomfort
and inconvenience '"which,
the public generally must be called
upon to suffer In the fuel crisis, and
particularly In recognition of the sit
uation existing in the midst of tho
Chlrstmas shopping season, regional
fuel committee hereby maKes effective
at once the following supplement to
fuel conservation regulations issued
or. November 29: .
Industries, stores and other Places
of business may open before 9 a. m.
and close later than 4 p. m., if outside
of these hours they use no heat, light
or power whatever produced in any
way from coal, wood or gas. This
modification is made strictly upon the
condition that those plants and places
of business which use heat during the
hours fixed will shut off their fuel
consumption at. the same hour it would
j "c " ' T . "V
doors at 4 p. m.. and that heat will be
used no earlier in the morning than
allowed by the original regulations.
Grocery, meat and milk stores, barber
shops and places of public amusement
may operate outside of : the special
hours fixed " by them if they comply
with the above conditions. .
It is understood that while the-bunkering
of ships, both foreign and
American, will be held under consider
ably more rigid restrictions than
heretofore and will be subject' to ap
proval of the regional committee, the
regulations will not, at least for the
present, be entirely prohibitive.
District Attorney's Office Busy.--.
At least one ofnee in the city
burned lights after hours last night,
while practically all others except es
sential industries and all stores along
the main streets were dark. That was
tho office of United States District
Attorney John L., Neeley, who was
kept" busy from an early hour in the
morning nntil late In the night an
swering inquiries concerning the new
fuel conservation regulations.
When called on by a representative
of The J'jurna' last I Ight for a state
ment for pablii ntiu:. concerning the
j stains of the rfgulat:cns and the part
the local feile.? authorities will have
in their enf )rc rnent, Mr. Neeley said
In substance, that as he understood
the situation the regulations were the
result of the conservation acts of
congress as war measures and the
proclamations of the president issued
thereunder; that they nad for their
object the conservation of fuel through
tho railroad administration, and with
the exception of such rules and reg
ulations as were Promulgated by the
regional coal conservation committee
of Atlanta, the application and inter
pretation of the regulations should be
sought for by the local railroad rep
resentatives and local representatives
of he railroad administration.
Mr. Neeley said that it was his un
derstanding that the regional com
mittee is promulgating its rules and
regulations through the press to the
end that all patriotic cltlens may be
fully advised of the situation and
saved any " Embarrassment for their
failure to comply with the regulations,
