THE LEDGER.
L I. TUTS,
mil 13D FSOFBIETOt
THURSDAY, DEC 15, 1887.
Of course the bosses howl when
the masses are allowed to speak.
The Ledger is no manVorgan; "
it gives the news and that is what
hurts some folks.
Our contemporary don't like the
way .the Ledger is edited. It has
good reason to complain.
Blaine's attack on Cleveland's
message is a bid for the nomination
he will get it and more, i. c, get
beaten .
The President's message was re
ceived with favor everywhere ex
cept in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Hardly a respectable minority.
Cigarette smoking is causing
the death of a good many boys and
young men. There are a few boys
in Mexico who, if they do not stop,
will either die or go to the insane
asylum.
The oflical majority against the
Prohibition amendment in Oregon
is 7,985, in a total vote of 37,000.
The friends of Prohibition are not
dismayed, but propose to keep at
it, and try it again.
A number of New York clergy
men are out in a protest against
spending so much money on the
dead in ostentatious funerals and
monuments when so many living
need it much more. Sensible.
M. Y. Duncan agreed to abide
by the result of the church trial.
The report has been served on him
and "he accepts it, making such
concessions as ho thinks his duty."
The report completely exonorates
Eld. Higbee.
Cor,. Gentry, of Sedalia, is fa
vorably spoken of all over the
State as a candidate for State
Treasurer. Gentry is one of Mis
souri's worthy young Democrats
and has a host of warm friends
everywhere.
In order to maintain four million
young men under arms, who an
robbed from the productive in
dustrics to be kept in enforced and
irksome idleness, Europe pays an
nually $2,500,000, which is wrung
in greatest measure from the work-
ingman. It is no wonder that an
archy is bred there.
Every citizen in Mexico is inter
ested in Hardin College and its
needs. The movement to raise a
fund to erect a chapel should be
encouraged by all. A chapel must
be built. The entertainments being
given by the committee are worth
the money asked, and you are
helping a good cause.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox sings
"Theseasons are made by the heart,
I hold, and not by outdoor heat or
cold." And yet we advise Ella not
to venture out without hef wraps
and rubbers during the approach
ing snow-storms. A warm heart is
a good thing theoretically, but a
aonlfilrin earlr is nnt tr. Vie ftnAP7fH at
in winter.
The Republican National Con
vention i3 to be held in Chicago on
tee 19th of Juue. This is well.
Chicago has worked hard and spent
a great deal of money to acquire a
reputation as a town offering sup
erior facilities for the accommoda
tion of National Conventions and it
deserves the distinction. Besides,
it was shown in 1884 that the
. friends of Blaine could turn out as
vociferous a gallery crowd in Chica
go as can be desired.
. REPORT OP TRIAL.
The report of the church trial
will be made to-night. We learn
some of the members want it pub
lished and some do not. The re
port will appear in the Ledger
provided the church makes up its
mind to have it published and fur
nishes the copy. Of course the
Ledger is anxious to give the
news, but at the same time does
not propose to keep this matter
stirred up any more lhan necessa
ry. The report will appear in the
Ledger if the church furnishes a
copy for publication, as was stated
in the opening of the trial.
A Boston jury has decided that a
cigar is a drug, and therefore that
an apothecary can sell one on Sun
day whhout violating the law. The
- verdict is very similar to that once
secured by Tom Marshall in Ken
tucky, to the effect that "seven
up" is not a game of chance, but a
game of skill. " The decision was
arrived at by pitting the unskilled
against the skilled players among
the jury for moneyed Btakes. The
defendant, charged with gambling
by means of a game of chance, was
acquitted. Perhaps the j ury in
Boston smoked some of the apothe
flftrv'a ciirara.
The Jones alley is liable to
cause more trouble in the future
than it has done even in the past.
The City Attorney was ordered
last night to look into the matter
of alleys in that block and see if
the alley running east and west, on
which J. J. Steele's store-room is
located, does not belong to the city.
Steele says this alley was vacated
in ; return for which the Lowry
' nine north and south. . It will be
set up in answer to this that "the
Lowry heirs " could not deed the
' alley running north and south be-
When this question wiu De set
tled, or what the result will be we
are unable to state, but we are sure
the matter is to be at once sifted to
the bottom and forever settled.

Judge Norton will not be a candi

place for the Lord Hardwukc of
the Missouri bar, M. Y. Duncan,
who is ripe for judicial honors; and
it goes without saying that he
make a No. 1 Supreme Judge.
The candidates for county officers
have not been named. I trust the

White, of the Ledger, and Cook,
of the Intelliqencer, and upon i
square race between these gentle
men, the people may determine
which shall hold inquest upon the
bodies of the political dead, killed
by their pens.
Mr. Editor, no matter whether
you may win or lose in the race for
coroner, continue the pencil. Make
the Ledger's influence wider and
:onger. Without a boom we can
have no boom. If going wet wont
make a boom try going dry awhile,
and let the world know that Mexico

When the life of a city becomes
dependant upon the existence of a
tempter to the young men and
boys, and vending destruction to
homes and happiness, and taking
bread and clothes from the help
less, there should be a change.
Going to church and grunting
when the 'preacher groans, and
amening at his periods, or express
ing concern for the men and youths
on the lightning express of intem
perance to destruction, or express
ing sympathy for the drunkard's
family, or-growling at the dram
shop Keeper whose business is
made lawful by license, will all go
for naught, so long as you sell to
the dram shop keeper all that in
temperance destroys, and receive
in return all the evils that intern
perance produces, and a little rev
enue from the license to boom the
town.
Wives, mothers, daughters and
sisters have rights, natural God
given rights, and among these are
wives to have sober husbands
mothers sober sons, sisters sober
brothers, daughters sober fathers
and when it can be truly said that
in Mexico these rights are secured
we will have a boom, not founded
upon liquor-moistened sand, but
upon the rock of sobriety. Bob
what do you say to going dry

The Seventh District.
J. K. M iuiHn in VersaillesStatesmaii,
The friends of Col. Hutton, Con
gressman from the 7th district of
Missouri, state positively that he
will not be a'candidate for re-election.
The action of the Democratic
Congressional convention of 1886
foreshadowed this when the second
successive dead-lock in that district
occurred. Audrain, the home of
Hutton, will be practically solid
for a Pike county man, with Hut
ton out of the way. In the last
convention there was a "scramble"
for the nomination. Nearly every
county had a candidate. The Pike
county delegation (the strongest in
the district) took in the situation,
and when the time came that Pike's
vote would nominate a harmless
and unobjectionable man, they
"went for him thar and then."
His name was Hutton and he was
nominated.. Without tliis unex
pected break on the part of Pike
Hutton would not have received
the nomination. Pike was satis
fied with Audrain's guarantees for
1888. And now, mark ye, the
next member of Congress from the
Seventh Missouri Congressional
district will be Judge Elijah Robin
son, of Pike county. ,
Freer Trade Wanted.
It is not Free Trade hut a freer
trade that President Cleveland
favors.
He urges that some of the need
less war shackles be removed and
this not upon any theoretical or
philosophical ground, but as an
incident of stopping the surplus
revenue.
None of the fathers of the system
of protection ever deemed or dream
ed that a tariff average of nearly 50
per cent, was essential to the build
iug np of American industries. A
maximum duty of that amount and
an average of 30 per cent, would
have seemed monstrous to them.
At the outbreak of the war the
average duty was but. 18.84 per
cent. In 1863, when we had a mil
lion soldiers in the field and a great
war to sustain,-the average duty
was but 32.62 per cent. -.
And yet now, when our ."infant
industries' are many of them more
than half a century old, and the
war has been over fcr nearly a
quarter of a century, the average
duty is above 49 per cent., and the
customs collections last year ex
ceeded those of 1867 by more than
$40,000,000.

freer trade, "-

or the remotest corner of the State.
This hue and cry about Francis
being a St. Louis man, and because
of this fact, he should be discarded
and some other man from the
interior of the State selected in his
stead is mere "moonshine."
Mayor Francis,if chosen Governor,
will administer the affairs of Mis
souri in a fair and equitable man
ner, and no true-blue Democrat
will ever have cause to regret
selecting him as their Governor.
Rocheport Commercial.
A certain lady suspected that
her husband was in the habit of
kissing the cook a pretty German
girl, by the by and resolved to
detect him in the act. After watch
ing four days, she heard him come
in one evening and gently pass
through into the kitchen. .Now,
Kate was out that evening and the
kitchen was dark. Burning, with
jealousy, the wife took some
matches in her hand, and, hastily
placing her shawl over her head, as
Kate often did, she entered the
kitchen by the back door, and was
almost immediately seized and
embraced and kissed in the most
ardent manner. With her heart
almost bursting with rage and
jealousy the injured wife prepared
to administer a terrible rebuke to
her faithful spouse. Tearing htr-
seu irom ms emorace, Bhe struct: a

Katie's beau one of the factory

has never treated him so well since
the first month they were married
as she has for the past week.

The Ohio Democrats in Congress
oppose the President's views on
the wool tariff, while the Texas
Democrats who represent wool-
growing districts, say that no mat

they will stand by the party and

comes from does make a difference.
