THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citizens of ihe Senate and
House of Representatives :
In the midst of unprecedented political
trouble we have cause for great gratitude to
God for unusual good health and most abund
ant harvests.
OUR fOIKWSC RELATIONS.
You will not be surprised to learn that in
the peculiar exigencies of the times, our
intercourse with foreign nations has been
attended with profound solicitude, chiefly
turning upon our own domestio affairs.
A disloyal portion of the American
people during the whole year have been en
gaged in an attempt tol divide and destroy
the Union. A Nation which endures factions
and domestio divisions is exposed to disrespect
abroad, and one party, if not both, is sure,
sooner or later, to invoke foreign
intervention. Nations thus tempted to
interfere are not always able to resist tho
counsels of seeming expediency and ungen
erous ambition, although measures adopted
under such influences seldom fail to be un
fortunate, and injurious to those adopting
them.
The disloyal citizens of tho United States
who have offered the ruin of our Country in
return fer Aid and comfort which thev havo
invoked abroad, have received less patronage novel
nnd pneourasement than thev probably ex- tne
pected. If it were just to suppose, as the in
surgents seemed to assume, that foreign na
tions.in this case discarding all moral .social &
treaty obligations, would act solely and sel
fishly for the most speedy restoration ot com
the awards of the commissioners
under the act of tho 3d of March 1859, If,
however, it should not be deemed advisable
to carry that recommendation into effect, I
would suggest that authority bo given for
investing the principal over proceeds of sur
plus relerred to, in good securities, with a
view to the satisfaction of such other just
claims of our citizens against China, as are
not unlikely to arise hereafter in coursa of
our extensivo trade with that Emr Te.
By act of the 5th of August last Congress
authorized the President to instruct the
commanders of sailing vessels, to defend
themselves against, and to .capture, pirates.
This authority has been exercised in u single
instance only, cor tne more euectuai pro
tection of our extensive and valuable oora
merco in eastern seas especially, it seems to
me that it would also bo advisable to au
thorize the commanders of sailing vessels to
recapture any prizes which pirates may make
of United States vessels, and their car
goes : ana niso to autnorize consular
courts, established by law in eastern
countries, to um judicata the cases, in the
event that this should not bo objected to by
local authorities.
If any good reason exists why we should

the personal hazard of accepting to serve,

During the long and brilliant judiciary
career of Judgo McLean, his circuit grew
to an empire altogether too largo for any
one Judge to give the courts therein more
than a nominal attendance, rising in
population from one million four
hundred and seventy thousand
and eighteen in lodU, to six mil
lions ono hundred and fifty-one thousand
four huudred.und fivo in 1800. Uesides this
the country has outgrown our present
judicial system. It uniformity was
at all intended tho systoui requires that all
the States shall be accommodated by circuit
courts attended by Supreme Judges ; while
in fact Wisconsin, Minnesota, lowa.ivan&us,
Florida, Texas, California, and Oregon have
never had any such courts. JNor can tins

smeo the organization ot tne government;
Congress has enacted sorao five thousand acts
and toint resolutions, which fill more than
six thousand closely printed pages, and are
scattered through many voiumts. fliany oi
these acts have boon drawn in haste and
without sufficient caution, so that their pro
visions are olten obscure in themsolves or in
conflict with each other, or at least so doubt
ful as to render it very difhcult for
even the best informed porsons to ascertain
precisely what the statute law really is. It
seems to mo very important that the statute
law should be made as plain ana intelligible
as possible, and be reduced to as email
a compass as may consist with tho
fullness and precision of tho will of the leg-
islature.and the porspiouity of its language
This well done would I think greatly facil
itate the labors of those whose duty it is to
assist in the administration of the laws, and
would bo a lasting benefit to the people by
placing beforo them in a more accessible and
intelligible form the laws which so deeply
concern their interest, and their duties.
I am informed by somo whose opinions I
respect, that all tho acts of Congress now in
force and of alpermament and general nature,
might be revised and re written so as to be
embraced in one volume or at loast two vol
umes oi ordinary and convenient size, and I
respectfully recommend to Congress to con
sider the subjoot,and,if mWsuggestions bejap
proved, to devise such plan as to their wis
dom shall seem most propor, for the attain
ment of the end proposed.
Ono of the unavoidable oonscquences ot tuo
prevent insurrection, is tho entire suppres
sion in many places of all ordinary means of
administrating civil justice by tho officers
aud in tho tortus ot existing laws.
This is thp case, in whole or in part
in all tho insurgent states, and as our
armies advance upon and take possession of
those states, the practical evil becomes more
apparent. There aro no courts nor officers
to whom the citizens of other States may ap
ply for tho enforcement of their lawful
claims against citizens of the
insurgent States, and there
a vast amount of debt constituting such
claims. Some have estimated it as high as
two hundred millions of dollars, due'in large
part from insurgents in open rebellion to
loyal citizens who are even now malting
great saenficos in the discharge of their
patriotio duty to support the government

The demands upon the united states
for pensions will bo largely in
creased by the insurreo.ion. iNum
erous applications for pensions based upon
the casualties of the existing war have aU
ready been made. There is reason to believe
that many who aro now upon the peaslon
roll and in receipt of the bounty of the
government, aro in tho ranks of the insurg
ent army, or giving them aid and comfort.
Tbo Secretary of the interior has directed a
suspension ot tho payment ot pensions of
such persons upon proof of their disloyalty.
I recommend that Congress authorizo that
