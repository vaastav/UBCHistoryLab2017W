CLUMSY DODGING.
He who lights against right, truth and
logic and yet would justify his course to
men must be an artful dodger. The
Globe-Democrat has shown clumsiness
rather than art in its dodging.
When recently The Kepubllc con
victed the Globe-Democrat of willfully
misstating the circumstances attending
the election, the Globe-Democrat re
sorted to the thug's device of "starting a
rough house" by calling The Republic
names.
When now The Republic points out
that the Nesblt law was a protest
against Julius Wurzburger as Election
Commissioner, the Globe-Democrat
dodges with, 'The Republic and Its re
formers accept the Nesbit law. Thnt
settles it."
This sort of logic may prove entertain
ing and satisfying to tiie Globe-Democrat
and the ring it represents. It is the
same sort of argument that Mayor Zieg
eniiein used when he felicitated his fellow-citizens
on the fact that the moon
was still shining. St. Louisans are
neither charmed with the adroitness nor
deceived by the logic of such an artifice.
HIGH OLD LORRY TIMES.
There was every reason why the open
ing session of the Congress now begin
ning the ninety days of legislative work
with which Its life will terminate should
have attracted to Washington a vast
horde of lobbyists, attorneys, secret
agents of monopoly corporations and
others w hose object it is !o influence, for
gain, the making of laws In the national
capital.
Although tl.s is a closing session of
Congress, it comes at n time when a.
President has just been re-elected to
succeed himself, thus receiving an in
dorsement of ids policies which shall
embolden him to push them to their ex
tremes lengths.
Mr. McKlnley's policies, dictated by
Mark Hanna in the interests of the
trusts, an: such as open up a vast field
lor lobbyists and monopoly agents.
There's to be a lot of syndicate legisla
tion, contract letting and creating of
places for hungry office-seekers. The
tinm to get jour "inflooence" at work is
right now.
It Is safe to say, therefore, thnt all the
class Interests which are in line for
benefit under the sway of commercial
ized politics will be generously repre
sented in Washington from now until
the holidays. Tho American people will
in all likelihood be the most Inadequate
ly represented clement. This is because
the Republican party is in power,
pledged to dothe bidding of the trusts,
and liecatise the trusts are hostile to the
people.
IMPORTANT TO HANNA.
It was characteristic that Mark Han
na. in a consideration of the most impor
tant lulls 1o come before Congress in the
session now begun, should have placed
the Haiinn-Paync-Fryc-Staudard Oil
ship-subsidy bill second on ills list, In
sisting that it is "a just measure, de
voted to the upbuilding of the American
merchant marine."
Even the members of Mr. Hanna's
own party in the National Congress fail,
as a body, to agree witii him as to the
urgent necessity for the swift passage
of the shiiHsubsIdy bill, or that it is a
just and widely beneficent measure. It
has been stated by at least one Repub
lican Senator that the ship-subsidy bill
may easily await the action of the next
Cougres", giving place to moie necessary
'legislation during the present short ses
sion. A Republican Congressman from
the President's own State and Mark
Hanna's own district finds himself un
able to support the measure because he
is opiwsed to the subsidy Idea, the tax
ing of the many for the benefit of the
. lew.
It is now apparent, however, that
Hnnna proposes to push tho Ilnnna-rayne-Frye-Standnrd
Oil shln-suliely
bill through in this session, as hclns sec
oiiil in importance on the. list of urgent
legislation. It is certainly of importance
to Hanna, promising to vastly increase
his wealth and that of the syndicate of
which lie Is the head. And tills is the
tlnal test after all, under the McKinley
regime the test of a law's alue to
Hanna and the syndicate. It is in
order to expect the early passage f the
ship subsidy bill.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President McKinlcy's message to the
Cougiess which coiiened in Washing
ton yesterday for the completion of lis
laboi-, is of exceptional historic aliie as
outlining, at the dawn f a new cen
tury, the p.tlio of a great Government
which had but just been born when tho
present century began.
The message recites facts which Jus
tify national pride. It oilers indispu
table proof of the most marvelous na
tional gtowth kuowu to the world's his
tory. It necessarily shows that this
Government now stands in the front
rank of Hie world's greatest Powers, a
Government that logically exercises the
strongest single iutluence in the settle
ment of all international iuestiotis of the
first magnitude.
It Is, perhaps, inevitable that great
nnd sudden dangers to the American
spirit and the true American policy
should have been brought into being by
this Government's recent tremendous in
crease of power anil prestige. It may
be taken as similarly logicul that Mr.
McKinley, standing for the party most
susceptible to the glamour of the new
prospect of world-wide territorial ac
quisition created by the results of the
war with Spain for the liberating of
Cuba, should iu his message advocate a
foreign policy which is more or less of
a surrender to the sudden temptation.
It is al.so logical that the President
should have made no effective utterance
in opposition to the ominous growth of
the trust evil, a growth for which ids
party's friendliness towards the trusts
is so largely responsible.
The President's message is a confes
sion that, in so far as it is possible to
Mr. McKinley and the Republican party,
the Government is to 1h administered
on lines of imperialism and of class-privilege
that are foreign to the spirit of its
founders. Politically speaking. Mr. Mc
Kinley has good warrant for the tone of
ids message. His campaign for re-election
was necessarily made on these is
sues, the Democratic assault on the
trusts and imperialism being exception
ally fierce. The people at the polls sup
ported Mr. McKinley in this conlllct of J
oninlon.
All that now remains to be seen Is
whether or not the people best knew
what was good for themselves and for
the country when they extended the Mc
Kinley leae of power for four years
more. Tiie President himself is faithful,
in Ids message, to those tilings for which
he stood In the campaign which ended
In his re-election to the Presidency.
KEEP THEM DISTINCT.
In his recent aide discussion of the
city's condition and prospects Mr. Fred
erick N. Jndson seems to have confused
the evils that arise from misgovemmeut
with those that arise from Charter and
constitutional limitations. Accordingly
lie reached the conclusion that St.
Louis's troubles arose as much from an
antiquated Charter and from unjust
obligations and limitations placed upon
the city by the State Constitution as
from municipal inisgoverument.
Reflection will readily show that the
immediate troubles of the city are not
due to Charter defects or to constitu
tional limitations but to Ziegcnhciulsm.
It Is known that St. Louis has Jogged
along prosperously as recently as three
years ago with street lights and street
cleaning even by block patrol, with
enough money to feed its paupers and to
buy medicines for Its indigent sick and
to build an occasional street and sewer.
It is known that, so far from accumu
lating a deficit at the rate of .fl.'ii.tiOo
a year, St. Louis built a new !f2.0m.(KHl
City Hall with current revenues without
issuing a single bond.
These undoubted facts prove beyond
doubt that we can under the present
Charter and State Constitution get along
comfortably. St. Louis is not doing so
and has not been doing so for several
years past. The present trouble of St.
Louis is due to Ziegenheinisni and to
nothing elss.
It Is equally admitted that if St. Louis
Is to make Itounds and leaps forward,
as she should do in preparation for the
World's Fair, Charter nnd constitutional
changes are imperative. This is nothing
new. It was n-eognized years ago. A
Charter Amendment Commission sat
and recommended Charter changes dur
ing Mayor Walbridge's term. When le
eently Charter amendments were voted
on by St. Louians they were defeated
because of lack of confidence in Mayor
Ziegenheln and ids helpers and because
plain public demands like that for the
merit system were disregarded in the
submission of the amendments.
St. Louis's Charter Is antiquated and
the city Is unfairly limited by the State
Constitution, tint that does not cause tho
city's present troubles. That prevents
marked progress. It does not compel
retrogression, and municipal government
has retrograded very seriously.
COMPLETE THE FUND.
There could be no more stimulating in
centive for friends of the World's Fair
than the knowledge that with the com
pletion of the local subscription of ?.".,
000,000 the great enterprise will be
placed on the firmest financial footing
and that the most vigorous and active
work on the Exposition itself will imme
diately follow.
The effect of this definite and assured
endeavor will be felt not only in St,
Louis and throughout Missouri, but in
Washington and extending direct to
every State Iu the Union.
In St. Isolds the permanent World's
Fair organization will be formed and the
World's Fair officers elected to direct the
undertaking to its successful culmina
tion. In Jefferson City the General Assem
bly of Missouri will promptly take up
the work of preparing for a State ex
hibit that shall reflect due credit on the
World's Fair State.
In Washington the Congress now in
session w'.H uked for the appropria
tion from the Federal Government al
ready agreed upon.
In the ether States of the Union the
various Legislatures will beieqtichted to
authorize ami provide for State exhibits
that shall illustrate this country's prog
ress in tiie arts and sciences, in com
merce and Industry.
The foundation for all this work, as
for the entire fabric of the World's Fair,
must of necessity be found in the com
pleted voluntary subscription of .'.tHHi,
000 from the people of the World's Fair
Cltj. The appeal to civic pride iu this
essential is potent indeed. The marked
enthusiasm now manifested iu behalf of
the World's Fair by St. Louisans should
speedily culminate iu the completion of
the local fund. The announcement to
the woild that St. Louis's investment of
$.-.,000,000 iu tiie World's Fair has been
made will proe the World's Fair ear
nestness of St. Louisans beyond all fur
ther question.
This announcement should lie forth
coming before Congress adjourns for the
holidays. Every St. Louisaii should as
sist in making it ccttain. A united etTort
to this end Is now inpcrathely in order.
Complete the World's Fair fund. Woi Id's
Fair success depends upon it.
DE WET AND MARION.
McKinleyitcs will doubtless be en
raged anew by W. T. Stead, the English
man, who pees lit to call the Roer Gen
eral De Wet the Francis Marlon of o
day and to point out that the cruel war
of extermination now being waged by
the English In South Africa is similar to
the relentless tactics employed against
Marion in the last century.
This thing of finding among the patriot
Roers of the present time a reproduction
in tyie and spirit of the patriot Ameri
cans of 1770 is embarrassing to the Mc
Kinley administration, which lias as
sisted England In crushing the Rocrs-.
McKlnie. ite organs will have no good
word for this man Stead, who dares to
rebuke his own Government ami to pub
licly note the American Government's
betrayal of the American spirit. When
England's imperialist newspapers begin
calling Stead a traitor and a liag-furler
you will see the Tory organs of McKin
ley imperialism fall promptly into line
and take up the hue and cry. It Is nec
essary that they shall discredit such a
man he dares to hold human rights
higher than syndicate plots for conquest
and the looting of weaker nations. Down
with the idealistic fool:
Nevertheless there are many Ameri
cans and Englishmen whose hearts sick
en at sight of the great and. sinful
tragedy licing enacted in South Africa.
In the honesty of their souls they can
not call wrong right, nor rejoice in the
national extinction of a manly and God
fearing people. And it may be that this
spirit shall prevail against the Mark
Hanna and Cecil Rhodes commercial
syndicate spirit, ultimately saving the
Roers from subjection to an alien gov
ernment. God lias not yet finally judged
between the two peoples.
A Republican party organ thus voices
what seems to be the most unique claim
to consideration that has yet been put
forward In politics: "In consideration
of the magnificent race Mr. Flory made
for Governor, it would certainly be a
very graceful act on the part of Gov
ernor Dockery to appoint Mr. Flory to
the vacancy iu the office of Railroad
Commissioner."
Announcement of Governor Joseph W.
McClurg's death seemed to bother the
Republican party organs. Some said he
was "the last Republican Governor of
Missouri." Others seemed to smell an
unpleasant inference in this and said he
was "the latest Republican Governor of
Missouri."
Mr. McKinlcy's message to Congress
declares. In effect, that he shall continue
working for empire and the trusts, and
that he believes the people at the polls in
November sanctioned such service.
One noteworthy attraction Is pos
sessed by tiie session of Congress which
has Just opened: It will make the $3,000,
000 Federal appropriation for the Louis
iana Purchase Woild's Fair.
It was natural that the President's
message should have a good word for
the ship-subsidy bill. Mark Hanna, the
bill's greatest lienelieiary, doesn't elect
Presidents for his health.
First and foremost among the Impor
tant duties awaiting the incoming Gen
eral Assembly of Missouri is the electlou
of the best Democrat aailable for
Speaker of the House.
Washington just at present Is the par
adise of lobbyists and the secret agents
of trust monopolies. Rich pickings of
imperial loot and special privileges con
stitute the at miction.
When the people of St. Louis lift their
chic slogan of' "Nothing Impossible!" It
means just what it says and it's sound
ing iu splendid World's Fair ohnuc
right now.
It is appalling to think what an awful
brand of politics would figure in the
Wot Id's Fair movement if Zelgenhien
istn and the Globe-Democrat could have
their way.
Is it the fault of the Nesbit bill that
St. Louis's paj rolls were recently bur
dened witii such atiame as that of Judge
of Election Alirenhosterbae imcr?
What a pity that the new century
which comes in at midnight of Decern
lier ol will find St. Louis in almost pri
meval darkness.
Reading between the lines of the Pres
ident's message, Americans learn that
they are In for four yean; r.f imperialism
and trustisiu.
St. Louis's foundation for the World's
Fair a local subscription of $3,000,000
will be of a solidity appropriate for the
Solid City.

to ih.- dead father of Tl.e Imp to raise und
make a mat: of that h iruls4ne oung scape
Ki.it e. This is the hrst time. J believe, that
such a eomblnjtio.i. with such a purpose,
has been hro-ight. Into existence, and the re
sult is genuinely quaint comedy, as I have
iilrcJdy Indicated.
Tins Is lieeauso Dick Carewa and Th
Trinity have their hands full with The Imp.
Ti.ey have trained him pretty much as such
(rental middle-aped men of tho world would
train a yoiin? fellow whose father wa one
of their chums In the dajs when they were
SI. but be lets to cut his eyeteeth for him
self, after all. and that's where the trouble
comes in. At one time the four bachelors
billcve they have brought The Imp to a'
safe anchorage as the accepted sweetheart
of the bewitching Phyllis, but the difficulty
H that Phyllis Is in love with Dick Carewe,
that The Imp Is Infatuated with a music
hall celebrity, Kara Glynesk, the Firefly
(Mi's Eleanor Gist), nnd that Dlclc Carewe
Is h!m-elf In love with Thyllls.
Out of this complication, as a matter ot
coarse; any nmonnt of fen and some very
delicate pathos nro evolved. Mr. Goodwin
lias a part of considerable sentiment, and
meets Its demands ro very acceptably as to
appear before a St. Louis audience In a new
nrd most pleasing light. Ills Dick Carewe
is a. d!t!nct creation, with much of th
old Nat Goodwin In It. and yet with a.
sotter and mellower Goodwin that Is pleas
ant to contemplate. Miss Elliott's work a
l'hylhs was a dl'tlnct advance In delicate
treatment, with a tcrder shading; which un-
qm-stionahly endears that young woman le
th? people- in front. There are two scenes
in which she Is especially effective one in
the earlier half of the play. In which she
tantalizes D.ck Carewe with a faint su
pU n.n that ho love her; the other In the
last aet. when the one and only love scene
between them Is acted In a way that stamps
the success of the new production as cer
tain. "When We Wpre Twenty-one" Is not by
any means written exclusively to exploit
Mr. Gocdvdn and Miss Elliott. The threi

bachelors, which ts attractive
ness and wholcsomeness. And
this reminds me that the atmosphere of the
story may be best described as wholesome.
It deals cleanly with some of the evil
facts of the world, and even in the third
act, whirh Is the one weak spot In the
I plav'.s construction as temporarily destroy
ing the sweeter run of the story 3 telling
the unmasking of the heartlessness of the.
music hall temptress Is accomplished with
as little coarseness as Is possible. The enrt
Inc; of the play, with The Imp saved, Mr.
Dick Carewe and Fhyllis happily brought
together, and The Trinity formlmr a sort
of homely but ecstaUc Greek chorus. Is
xcry pretty and tells with the house Im
mensely. Tho minor characters of the cast
are fairly well taken.
It Is my belief that Mr. Coodwm and Ml
Elliott will make n pleasant hit In St.
Louis. They are both advancing In the
q'i ility of their work, nnd their new play
lias sweetness, sentiment and humor skill
fully mingled. QUENTTN QUEER.
EDDIE GIRARD IN THE
COLUMBIA'S NEW BILL.
Eddie Glrard's stunts at the Coluiribta this
veck take one back to the days of "Nat

that presented that successful farce has
I-irgotten none of his old tricks. He Is just
a? funny as ever. Jessie Gardner lends hint
Viluablc assistance. Judging from the ap-lian.-e

supiiorted by May Wentworth and three
capt.ble men. Is called "A Woman's Dilem
