PRESIDENT f,r.VRI.B' FIBST
President Cleveland's first tueraage,
which we print on the third nd fourth
pages, U a lengthy and an exhaustive doc
ument, but those "who read it carefully
will agiige with xxa that, the best interests
of the Union in view, it; could
not well be " made shorter. The
country is large and the interests of
eixty millions of people are varied, wide
spread and involved. They cannot, there
fore, be dismissed with a few words.
Besides there are the relations of the gov
ernment with those of foreign nations,
relations that it is , to be hoped
aie in the near faiare to become
more close and more valuable to na
by an extension of the foreign
trade by means of onr own shipping. Mr.
Cleveland begins his first state paper, after
wording his sense of the loss the republic
suffered by the death of Vice-President
Hendricks, with an admonition to Con
gress to unite with him in all that is pos
sible to be effected for the public
good. He then passes on to oar
foreign relations, which he reviews
very thoroughly, making important sug
gestion?, especially in regard to the
Chinese labor question and oar trade
with neighboring nations, on a basis of
reciprocal tanflj or abrogation of tariff.
The various plans by Panama, Tehoante
pec and Nicaragua for securing
an international waterway are all
treated of at length, the Presi
dent giving good, common sense
reasons why auch a highway as may be
constructed shall be for the world's con
venience and be guaranteed by the civil
ized powers against any and all of the
contingencies of war. With a wise appre
ciation of the historic policy of the Govern
ment in its foreign relations Mr. Cleveland
warns the people against entangling
alliances which are to be especially avoid
ed in any consent that may be given or
cpgnizmce taken by the government of
any of these proposed lines of transit. For
this came reason he counsels Congress
against any alliance with European powers
guaranteeing to uiaicl&in the independ
ence of the Congo Xieu States. The ques
tion of cit Kn8hip end naturalization
brought promi Dently to view by thQ
interpretation put by Germany aa the
existing treaties U treated of at length and
in a patriotic spirit that all Americans
must indorse. Hepoint3tiit the evils of
the pie -ent methods bf naturalization, and
recommends thi a higher value be put
upon cither. -ship through Federal legisla
tion. Lutse ara among the leading ques
tions under the head of foreign rela
tions, which embraces all claims and com
missions, fisheries, expeditions, especially
that to ILe isthmus of Panama,for the asser
tion of our treaty right.;, and the questions
involved in Germany end the Caroline Is
lands atd Spain and the Philippine Is
lands. Coining to home affairs, the Presi
dent reor.gu'zes tho value of the New Or
leans Imposition in its influence on the
people of Central and South Amer
ica, and then launches into an
analysis of the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, through wh ch he reache-
the onection of the tariff. ()a this he is
conservative. He says very sensibly that
the ijuestions of free trade and protection
are not involved, but tariff reform is, and
that -whatever is done, and something
should be done to t-ce le existing rates, those
on impoited necessaries of life should
firct be relieved and the incidental protec
tion of weak indus'iio bo continued. Iu

The death of Sir. V. II. Vanderbilt
yetert v mnch more endden than was

shock to the whole country, to which he

Details or Mr. Tanderbilt's Death-Hia
LMt aoainiii.
Naw Yobk, December 8 William H.
Vanderbilt is dead. Without a taolhent's
warning the messagevsme lor him, and he
was no more. The gilt iron cross over the
gate that leads to the grounds of the Ro
man Catholic Orpllan Asylum', Gn ?ifih
avenue, gleamed brightly under the elec
tric lamp to-night. Seen from the grand
entrance of the Vanderbilt mansion, di
rectly opposite, against the somber gry of
the marbla cathedral, it was the only
cheerfnl thing on the wide deserted ave
nue, that seemed alio stricken as with tud
den death. Rays of its brightness were
rt fleeted in the windows of the huge
brown stone pile, behind whose closed
curtains one of the richest men ' in the
world lay dead, stricken suddenly and
wit'out warning. The busy hum of
traflic and the noises of the street were
hushed in the block. Carriages turned
out, and passers by stopped to inquire if it
was true that
THE MILLIONAIRE WAS DAO.
Being told that tber heard aright, they
went their way, sobered and silent, tarry
ing, raaybaps, a moment to giti pityingly
on the huge stone pile. Inside servants
and friends tip toed about with grave and
saddened faces. The doorbell was rung
almost every teinute, ar-1 he wide portals
swung open to admit other iiiinds who
came to mourn with the mourners. Up
Jtairs behind the drawn curt it nB of the mil
Uonair" bed-room eia sobs and tears.
The chrtdro rI the dead were gathered
toe about his corpse. None of them
ha"! Geen with him in the honr of his
'.eath. To none had he had time to speak
a word of farewell. As he lay upon the
carved bed in the large square room, the
winaows ol wnicn overlook tbe avenue
from tbe northeast c rner of the south
wing of the building to the left of the
main entrance. Mr. Vanderbilt Hooked as
if he had fallen into a gentle sleep. His
features were peaceful and as natural as if
he had just ceased talking and
LAID DOWN TO REST.
His death had been as painless as it was
sudden. Mr. Vanderbilt was always an
early riser. When in his young dava he
worked his Htaten Island farm, it was hia
cm torn to rise with the son. and he used
to say in later life toat he had often arisen
at 4 o'clock to go to New York and re
turned to his breakfast and bis plow at
7 o'clock. Of late years he bad made it a
practic to leave his bed at 7 o'clock or
net mnch later, ami tbrouehout the in
creasing ill health of th e last two winters
he bad adhered to this practice. After
arising to-day he held his usual morning
conference with bis sons, Cornelius and
Wm. K . who were the active managers of
his railroad properties, and afterward
with Mr. E. O Kossiter, his private secre
tary, and treasurer ef the New York Cen
tral railroad, to whom he entrusted a Urge
share of the management of his private af-
lairs. inese contd.entos were held in Mr.
Vanderbilt's study on the sronnd Hoor of
the mansion in the corner to tbe left of
the main entrance from the avenue. It was
his favorite room where he wrote and
TRANSACTED ALL HIS BVSINE'S.
Duriux the morning conference to-day
he bad been more than ordinarily alert
and active, so much so as to excite com
ment, to which be replied in a good
humored, jocular vein. Ha had eaten a
good breakfast, and was lookirjg forward
witu pleasant anticipations to a ride up
the Btmlevard with bis son-in-law, Ham
ilton McK. Twombley, in the afternoon.
At 11 o'clock he sent to the Grand Central
depot for his old-time friend, Chanm ey
JJepew, president ot the JNew lork
Central railroad, with the message that he
wished to see Dim. Mr. JJepew was en
gaged in a conference at tbe depot, and
sent word that he would not be able to
come for an boar or two, and Mr. Vander
bilt delayed tbe appointment until 1
o'clock, and, to occupy the interval, went
down to tbe studio of J. Q A. Ward, tbe
sculptor, in West Fifty-second treet, to sit
for a bronzs bust of himself, which the
trustees of the College of Physicians Bad
Surgeons wished to place in the vestibule
of tbe college, for the erection of which he
recently gave $1,000,003. He returned
and took lunch at 12:3 J with his wife, his
son George and Mr. Twombley. At the
table be was noticeably
BRIGHT AND CHKLRFfU
At 1 o'clock Mr. Robert Garrett, the
president of the Baltimore and Ohio rail
road, called upon Mr. Depewat the Grand
Central depot, and finding him still
there, went tip to Mr. Vanderbilt's house
to inform the millionaire and take Mr.
Deuew'a place. Mr. Vanderbilt greeted
him cordially aud engaged in a long and
animated conversation with him about
railroad matters. The conference lasted
more than an hour, and Mr. Vanderbilt
sent word to Mr. Twombley that he
would have to forego tbe intended drive.
The two railroad magnates were discuss
ing tbe new terminal facilities of the Balti
more and Ohio, the new inlet into the
city it had secured by way of Staten
Inland, and Mr. anderoilt showed a
lively interest in the results that wero to
follow for the island of bis birth from the
new enterprise. It was while the talk
turned npon this, the scenes of his child
hood and early work, contrasted with the
tremendous achievements ot his old rge,
that Mr. Garrett, sitting on a sofa and fac
ing tbe mil ionaire, who leaned forward
in bis arm-chair, as was his habit when
thoroughly interested, that the president
ol the Baltimore and Ohio was suddenly
made, aware of a slight indistinctness in
Mr. Vanderbilt's speech that grew into an
inarticulate sound. As he leaned over to
catch his words,
MB. VAXDEBBII.T PITCHED FORWARD WITH
OCT A WORD OF WARNING .
and fell heavily on the floor on hia face.
Mr. Garrett sprang to bia feet with an ex
clamation of alarm, and seizing a nillow
from the sofa laid it under h is friend's head,
then summoned Mrs. Vanderbilt and
George, the yonngest eon. Messengers
were sent in haste for physicians. One
from the neighborhood responded first,
and was followed immediately by the
family doctor. Dr. James W. McLean.
Such simple reetoraUvee as were at hand
bad been applied, bat human aid was in
in. Mr. Vanderbilt never spoke or
oved after he fell under the sudden
roke, and died in a few minutes without
a straggle. To all intents and purposes he
was dead the instant he fell forward npon
the HtKr. It was 2:80 o'clock when Dr.
McLean led tbe stricken widow from the
room where her husband had aat planning
and working in the full pride of health
and strength five minutes before. Dr.
McLean pronounced his death the result
of a
SCDDEN STROKE Of PARALYSIS,
due to the bttrsting.of a latas blood vessel
at tbe base of thelirain, of the kind that
are absolutely f ital at the moment. He
stated that Mr. Vanderbilt's death WaS as
painless as it wad sadden. The doctor
knew bis patieot most intimately, and
promptly certified to the cause of death to
avoid the unnecessary formality ol a
coroner's inqaest and an autopsy. As
soon as it wae ascertained beyon4Uloabt
that Mr. Vanderbilt' was dead the men
servants were summoned and helped to
carry the body of their dead maater up
stairs to tbe bed-room he bad occupied in
life. Mrs. Vanderbilt was prostrated with
grief, and telephone messages were sebt to
the Grand Central depot to summon her
sons, and to the residences of her sons-in-law
to inform them of the bereavement.
Cornelius, Wm. K. and Frederick W.
Vanderbilt had been together in the office
at the depot less than half an hoar
BEFORE THE MESSAGE CABf E,
and had gone away together. The message
found Cornelius Vanderbilt in a meeting
of tbe trustees of the American Bible So
ciety at the Bible House. He has
tened at once to the house whither Mr.
Depew had preceded him, dumb with dis
tress over his friend's death. One by one
tbe other children arrived, and, as the
the report spread with . lightnine like
rapidity throughout the rity, bearer
friends of the dad magnate also came.
Universal consternation and grief pre
vailed at the most unexpected news. Mr.
Vanderbilt, whiie he had for two yeots
past been a victim, roor ct lees, of in
digestion, with its attendant ills and kin
dred serious disorders, had lately, despite
the frequent reports of his death, been
apparently mending. There had been an
improvement in the general tone of his
health that was particularly noticeable to
day. Monday night he attended tbe per
formance in the Metropolitan Ooera
House, and nothing was apparently fur
ther from his mind than sadden death.
Like most people, Mr. Vanderbilt had hia
own
LITTLE PRIVATE SUPERSTITIONS,
And one of .them was that if he ever
passed the age of sixty-five, which, for
some reason in the family's hittory is
looked npon as the critical age, he would
he good for twenty years more. In a con
versation with a near friend more than
three weeks ago, he stated th s as his be
lief, when the subject was brought up,
and he rejoiced in tne knowledge that the
turning point wa8 nearly reached. Had
M" Varwlnt-hilr. livpri tn Maw grh. hati
year, he would have been sixty-five years
of age. He was born at the Staten Island
homestead, on that date in the year 1821.
The cearnesa of the time, which he him
self Considered critical, gave him no ap
parent concern, however. He did not tx
pect, neither did he fear death, it cam
to hin, if tefy simply, very gently. He
d'.d not know it when it seized him. By
arrangement of the nearest friends, wlu
members of the family, It Wis decided
that the funeral should be on Friday next
at 10 o'clock, from St. BartholomewV
church, at Madison avenue and Forty
fourth street, of which Rev. Dr. Cook h
pastor. Mr. Vandcrbiit was a vestryman
in the church, to the construction f
which he had contributed largely. The
sexton of tbe chnrch wie charged with
THE VtTNlitAL ARRANGEMENTS.
At V.i. Vanderbilt's own desire.be will
be interred in the family mausolenm in
the Moravian Cemetery at New Darp,
Staten bland, which has just baen com
pleted. It was one of the last acts of hi
li'.e to turn over by deed, for $1, all the
old hrtn property of the family ou S:aten
Island to his son George, to do with as he
desired, and (of this purpose father and
son visitsd and went over the island to
gather last Saturday, incidentally inspect
ing also tbe iut-conspleted mauso eum
Mr. Vanderbilt had made a will. Its pro
visions are net known to any one outside
of tho family and his confidential counsel
and friend, Mr. Depew. But the Vander
bills were a very united family. Depew
ventured tbe prediction that tbe million
aire's death would make no change in ex
isting conditions. Tbe Vanderbilt railroad
systems will ba managed and owned as
heretofore. The sons will manage the es
tate and the properties, all of which are
here, tbe same as if the master hand was
at the helm. No
COMMOTION IN FINANCIAL CIRCLES
need result. Mr. Vanderbilt had long
ago abandoned Wall street and the stock
market. He owned no real estate as in
vestments. Like the commodore, hia
father, he bad no faith in real estate, but
believed that for men in active affairs it
was the correct thing to invest in prop
erties that could be turned into monev in
stantly it needed, lie Had, D83id3, a
theory, which he used to express in
words to this effect that real estate was
really owned by the municipality; tho
owners were really only the tenants.
Tbe children Mr. Vanderbilt leaves are
in their regular succession as to age from
Cornelius, who is about forty years of
age, down Cornelius, Wm.K., Frederick
W. and George W., and five daughters,
Mrs. kluott . bhepard, Mrs. VYiUiam D
Sloane, Mrs. Hamilton McK. Twom
bley and Mrs. Dr. Seward Webb. Corns
liua and William K. are both actively en
gaged in the management of the iamilv
railroad interests, and will so continue
Cornelius is the chairman of the Board of
Directors of the New- York Central and
Michigan Central systems, and William
K. holds the same cilice in the Lake Shore
and Nickle-Plate system. Frederick W.,
woo is about thirty two years old, is a
director in all tbe roads.
MR. VANDERBILT
was, it is thought, richer than any single
member ot the Kotnscmid family. lh
Duke of Westminster is said to be worth
aw,too,uuu, but Mr. vanderbilt was
richer, becuase the duke s money enly
pays him about 2 per cent . being mainly
in lands and houses. Mr. Vanderbilt had
a mnch larger income. List year he held
$51,000,000 of 4 per cent, bonds, bur liter
he reduced this amount to $o,000,00.l cf
3 per cents. His government bonds were
worth almost f 7o,000,000. At one time he
owned "4'),000 shares of Michigan
Central, 3ij0,0'0 shares cf North
western and 200,000 shares of Lake
Shore. He is said to have sold
considerable Lake Shore lately. In addi
tion, he had :i0 000 Chicago and Rock
Island, 20,000 Del tware and Lackawanna
and abont 20,000 shares in other railroads,
maKing in an about s ju.utiu shares of rail
way stocks; also $-2,000,000 worth of rail
road- bonds, S32,ouu,ooo of State and citv
bonds, and $2,000,000 in various manufact
uring stocks and mortgages, lie valued
his honse on Fifth avenue, with its art
treasures, at $3,000000. His ordinary
nonsenotd expenses were 92UU,U0f) a vear.
Iu 1SS4 he gave a ball that cost $40'tX)J.
He loved horses and was a good jud.e
of horse- rlesh. He sold Maud S.
for $40,000. Mr. Vanderbilt was worth
TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS OF. DOLLARS,
although his foitune shrank last vear in a
teriaily, through a big decline in ktocks,
and through business depression, but th
"ball" movement of the past few months
brought it up again. U:a income was cat
cnlated as follows : Two million three hun
dred and seventy-two thousand a year
rotn government bonds, $7,394X00 from
railroad stocks, $576,695 from m scellaneous
securities ; total, over $10,000,000 a year.
or $23,000 a day, $1200 an hour, or $19 75
a minute. He made no ostentatious dis
play of his wealth, and was charitable,
although in this he had to be quiet, or be
would nave been overrun by impostors.
Ho was aurewuer in business than uianv
aupposed be was. He knew enongu to
sell 250,000 shares of New Yor Central
five years ao at 120 and buy governments
at par.
THE DEATH SCENE.
The testimony from Mr. Vanderbilt's
body-servant, Lewis Maxwell, in regard
to the sceneB at the time of and immed
iately after tbe death, was substantially in
accordance with the story already told.
Dr. J. W. McLean was the only other wit
ness. The Coroner went to the Vanderbilt
mansion about 9 o clock to-night and
viewed the body.
WHAT JAY tiOILD SATS.
Mr. Jay Gould, in an interview with a
reporter of the Asaociattd Press' this even
ing, said: "Mr. VaLderbilt's death was
certainly a surprise to me, and a sad one,
too. His death wiil be a great loss to tbe
world of business and finance; for he cer
tainly was the foremost figure in many of
the greatest enterprises that have been
carried oat in this country daring the past
twenty-five years."
"You have been intimately acquainted
with Mr. Vanderbilt for many years, have
yon not?" asked the reporter.
"I first met and became acquainted
with Mr. Vanderbilt in 1867. At that
time I was President of tbe Erie Rail
road, snd he was Vice-President of tbe
Hudson River Railroad. I found him to
be a man of wide resources and sound
i'udgment. Afterwards he became Vice
resident of the New York Central, and
figured extensively in the building up of
the business ot that r- d. Our relations
op to the time cf bis death always had
been oi a pleasant character."
"What is your oninion of Mr. Vander
bilt as a financier
"Mr. Vanderbilt was a man dl unusual
ability in the management of large finan
cial interests. When his father died and
he came into possession of his vast for
tune, Mr. Vanderbilt was not long in deiri,
onstraticg bis ability to manage the prop
erty which had been Intfilsted to uis care,
lie made no move upon the checker-board
of finance until satisfied that his move
was a safe one to make. He would not
run a great risk until he waa absolute y
compelled by force of circumstances,
which, I assure you, was not very often.
His judgment npon "ralaes Was always
sound. Few men. haVe made o fow mio
t&kea in the handling of great interests as
Mr. Vanderbilt. He was not a bold ven
turer or operator. He seemed to be satis
fied with a small, or, at least, a fair return
from bis investments, so long as they
were sound." ,
,, ''Could you give me an estimate of Mr.
Vanderbilt's wealth ?"
"No, I do not think am able to give
anything like a fair estimate, although I
have known him in a business way for a
long time. It is quite certain, however,
that he was by far tbe wealthiest man,
not only in New York, hot in tbe entire
country. He always maintained a reti
cence Upon the value of bis own property.
Boasting in that line iVas Wholly beneath
htm. I never heard him so much as inti
mate the extent of his fortnne."
"What effect will hia death have upon
the stock market,, and especially upon tbe
stock of tbe Hew ork Central Railroad ?"
It will be safe to say that his death will
have the effect of depressing the market,
especially in those stocks in which he had
large holdings. These are tbe New York
Central, Lake Shore, Michigan Central and
the West Shore roads. Mr. Vanderbilt
held only $5,000,000 out of the $90,000,010
of tho stock of the New York Central.
The most of the stock is held by capitalists
in iCurope. You can see that his holdings
of this stock were smaller than was sup
posed by many. Tbe death of the finan
cier will not, I am quite certain, have
other than a temporary effect in depress
ing those stocks. The property is all good
and reliable as investments. If tbe mar
ket values of these stocks fall off a few
points to-morrow, they will go back again
to their original value in a few weeks.
Should Mr. Vanderbilt's holdings be
thrown npon tbe market, there are plenty
of capitalists who won d be glad to par
chase them at a fair figure.
THE TALK A MONO THE BROKERS.
There was a good deal of talk at tbe
Windsor H oUl, where brokers chiefly re
tort during tbe early part of the evening,
about large sales of the Vanderbilt stocks
at heavy declines from the closing quota
tions on the Stock Exchange this after
noon. Tbe reports, when rnn down, were
f and to be greatly magnified, and were
sales of a law hundred sbi" 0 iVe

oerore the crowd dispersed u.88 at the close
this afternoon. This was -the pivotal
stock, bur thBW wert- two or three small
transactions in New York Central at 103
104. The immense crowd present, which
ar exceeded anything witnessed at the
Windsor t his season, was accented as an
evidence of tbe widespread interest taken
ny tne public in the death of Mr. Van
derbilt and the desire to ascertain what
the eiTeet would be npon the market to
morrow. Absence oi any settled opinion was the
conspicnons feature of the talk early in
the evening, bat as time gave an oppor
tunity for an interchange of views, tbe
opinion became very prevalent that there
would be a moderate break in the Vander
bilt stocks at the opening to-morrow, not,
however, to exceed 2 to A per cent., and
that any support which might be found
necessary to prevent a more serious
decline would promptly made itself mani
fest. There was a conference outside of
the W indsor among the leading operators,
but it is understood that an adjournment
was taken until early to-morrow morning
without coming to any definite arrange
ments as to what should be done. Atten
tion was repeatedly called to-night to the
fact that tbe death of Mr. Vanderbilt's
father had no material effect npon Wall
street prices and that it has been generally
understood tor the past two years that
W. 11. Vanderbilt had ceased to
take a speculative interest in
tbe market.
EFFECT OF MR. VANDERBILT'S DEATH.

J. Pierrepont Morgan saM that Mr. Van
derbilt s death would have little or no ef
fect on the market, that the West Shore
negotiations would go on as before, and
that a cablegram had been sent to London
witn the information of his death, which
no doubt would be received there with i
great deal of rf gret.
fool (Jommissioner rink said that Mr,
Vanderbilt's death would have no effect
in tbe pooling as he had been oat of tbe
arrangement for some time. No doubt tbe
death ol such a prominent man would be
felt as a great loss by tbe mercantile world,
Mr. Hanry Clews said that Mr. Vander
bilt's death no doubt would have some
fff-ict on the market, as it would be used
by those who always sought to make cam
tal out of a calamity, but that this would
be of a serious character there was noth
ing to fear.
INTERVIEW WITH CBADNCEY M. DIP1W,
The Sun has tbe following: "President
Depew fa d that the death ol Mr. Vander
bilt would in no way a ter the management
ot tbe vast system nf tbe Central and its
big feeders. Mr. Vanderbilt, of coarse,
had prepared for the contingency of his
death. He has left a wid, bat nobody
rould be found last night who knew wuere
it could be tonnd, or when it was made,
Mr. Lepe said that all he knew was that
a will was in existence, tie did not know
where or when it waa made, or who were
heinior legatees under it, except that it waa
curtain that Cornelias and Wm. K. Van
derbilt, who had charge of tbe Vander-
hilt f-ystem of railroads and the other
Vanderbiit properties since their father's
retirement from business, would be con
stituted the managers under the wil- Tbe
most trustworthy intimates place Mr.
Vanderbilt s fortune at about $175,000.'

can be learned, are aoont as follows
Government bonds, $5,000 000; railway
bonds, J8.000.000; New Yora Central
s'ock, $5,000,000; Lake Shore stock, $15,
000.000; Michigan Central stock,
$7 000,000; Northwest stock, $8,000.
0C0. He also had a large amount of
real estate and cash, to say nothing of
lesser interests in Corporations not men
tioned above. All of his estate has, ac
cording to good authority, been left in
trust. The Iruees are understood to be
bis widow, C. M. Djpew, Cornelius Van-
daroilt, Hamilton McK. lwomblev and
John B. Dtitcber. Tbe story was current
laat night that Cornelius Vanderbilt held
a power of cttorney to act for the estate,
This wa3 probably due to the fact that
Cornelius has for a time exercised such
power for his father.
THE MARKET TO RS UPHELD BV A -STRONG)
SYNDICATE. .
Tbe best obtainable information to
night is that the stork market will be up
held through tbe efforts of a syndicate or
a pool, headed by J. Pierrepont Morgan
the members of which have agreed to
take 300,000 shares if offered, and also
take care of prices in the London stock
market, which is to open strong and to
close strong, witn a view ot favorably ul

death with an eagerness which events of

Grand Junction, Tknn.; December 8.
The weather to day waa rainy, with a
high wind in the morning which subsided
somewhat daring the day, though the rain
scarcely ceased a moment. The work done
by the dogs was extremely fine under the
circumstances; in fact, waa good Ml
through and at times brilliant. -
Gas Bondhu and Bessie A were the first
down to complete their unfinished heat
from yesterday. The wind was blowing
fearfully, which, with tbe rain, rendered
it almost impossible for the dogs to locate
birds. Gus Bondhu won the heat,
B. M. Stephenson's Lady C beat Major
J. W. Murnan's Sportsman in a long and
very exciting heat, in which some re
markably fine work was done. Lady C is
a very small bitch, bat a fast, wide ranger
and very stylish. She was a double winner
last season'. f ports") an is a very large,
handsome dog, and one of the best in tne
country. He won the Darby iast season.
Mr. Stephenson has cause to be proud oi
his victory over such a grand dog.
Dr. J. N. Maclin's Gath Mark, winner
of the all-age setter stake at High Point,
beat J. W. Gill's pointer Richmond. This
was a close rattling heat, in which much
flue work was done. It looked for a time
like the pointer would defeat the eastern

Philadelphia, Pa., December 8. De-
ember opens on advancing tendencies in
ton, steer, wool, leather, carpets, boots and
shoes and lumber. There is no assurance
that this upward tendency will continue
far into January, as it is de chiefly to an
unexpected activity in duplicate orders and
tire move'iiect ot consumers ot neavv
material to guard againtt an unexpected
demand. Carpets will advance because cf
dear wool, restricted output and exhausted
stocks. Hosiery is ordered freely and
spring deliveries are under way. Cloth
mills are resuming with full force and
time. All tbe textile interests will be fail
of orders for the spring trade. Duplicate
orders for Southern and Western, markets
are coming in freely.
uoot and shoe makers in New England
contemplate a successful combination
against what is termed trades union dicta
tion. Business is active and prices are
firm. New branch houses are being
established in the West, to deal directly
with manufacturers, and this coarse is
also pursued in the dry goods interest.
ine wool markets are lurly active and
manufacturers are buying for winter con
sumption; 90 per cent of the manufactur
ing interests will petition against a change
of tariff duties. A large number of looms
and knitiing machines are being put in
place here and in New England textile
centers.
The iron trade is activs and firm prices
rule everywhere. Heavy transactions
nave been closed this week in crude
finished iron, foreign and home, as well as
in bridge materials, steel rails, old rails,
etc. The stream of requiremants for ma
chinery and motive power for roads, en
gines, etc., is so strong that manufacturers
are induced to cover probable require
ments.
I nc eased activity is reported at err and
locomotive works. Business, footing up
$500,000, has been handled by manufact
urers ot electrical light devices within ten
days for cities, towns and for manufactur
ing and private houses.
Ihe lumber and coal trades are in vigor
ors conditions in Atlantic and lake mar
kets. Prices are firm. Freight rates by
water and rail continue to advance.
During tbe past week a large amount of
house, factory and building work has been
projected in New York and Philadelphia,
as well as in Western cities. Architects,
builders and investors are preparing for
an early revival of building activity in
the spring. Makers of machinery have
ust closed large contracts for milling,
mining, railroad and machine shops ap
pliances, for delivery in some of the

London, December 8. The Daily Newt
editorial'y says : "President Cleveland's
message seems to place him in true suc
cession f i tbe greater men who have oc
cupied " ie Presidential chair rather than
to the -ate Democratic line. It is con
ceived i i a most just and friendly spirit
toward .'11 foreign powers, and contains
no word :o tickle tbe ears of American
'j'.ngoes.' The message expresses a senti
ment of international good will. It is
equally wise and prudent in all domestic
topics."
The Timet says: "Some of the Old
World statesmen might ponder with ben
efit over some of Mr. Cleveland's reasons
tonchini' the Nicaragua treaty."
The Stimdatd says the message is tem
perate S"d dignified, and goes far to justify
Mr. Cleveland's election. The message
contrasts ve: y favorably with some of the
wild dispatches of Mr. Frelinghaysen and
Mr. Blaine. Mr. Cleveland's policy, on
tbe whole, is worthy of adoption. Austria's
action in refusing to receive Mr. Keily,
accords with well understood precedents.
If tbe right to refuse an exequatur con
flic te with the American constitution, the
sooner t j e republic's municipal laws are
fiat in keeping with international law the
ess such iiihcnlties will be likely to occur.

Washington, December 8. The Amer
ican Public Health Association met in its
thirteenth annual convention in this city
this morning, with Dr. James A. Reeves
of Wheeling, W. Va., in the chair.
The first business transacted was the
election of 125 new members.
Dr. H. B. Baker, secretary of the State
Board of Health, of LanBing, Mich., read
an interesting paper en "The Relatione of
Rainfall and Water Supply to Cholera."
Dr. Baker's paper was illustrated by sev
eral statistical tables and diagrams, based
npon the statistics of cholera in Calcutta,
India, iron 1865 to 1884 inclusive, and
and ths meteorological reports for the
same period. These reports showed that
cholera and rainfall bore a statistical rela
tion, the mortality being greater in seasons
of little rain, and vice versa. The tables
showed also that the mortality was greatly
reduced noon the introduction in late
years of a good water supply.
Dr. D. E. Salmon then read a paper on
"Tbe Virus of Hog Cholera," in which was
given in detail the experiments made, by
the Bureau of Animal Industry.
The Hon. Erastus Brooks of New York
said this waa a commercial as well as a
sanitary question. He referred to the ac
tion of the French and German authori
ties in prohibiting the importation of
American pork.
Dr. T. & Verdia of Washington said the
assumption that our animals arrived in
Europe in a diseased condition was only
an excuse to keep oat the American cattle.
Mr. Brooks said th bile, thia was
protlj true, it wag net the whole truth.
Tbe alleged improper packing of pork,
rendering it unfit for use when it arrived
in France, waa the avowed cause of the
prohibition in France. He referred to the
retaliatory measures. He thought it was
our duty to seev:i food sent abroad was
properly packed. , ,
Dr. Reed, of New York, offered a reso
lution recommending legislation, national,
state and municipal, to provide protection
for the people against the Bale of diseased
meat.
The resolution was referred, and the
Association adjourneB until thia evening.
The evening session was devoted to the
