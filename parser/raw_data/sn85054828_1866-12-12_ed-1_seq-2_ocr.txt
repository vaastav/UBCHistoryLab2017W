: : The Message.
"We print on our first page, to-day, the
President's Message, entire, to the exclusion
of much of our general variety of news and
. miscellaneous reading matter., It is a docu
ment which will encourage the hearts and
etrengthen the faith of the business interests
and" real friends of the ""country in all rela
tions. t In its whole spirit and . tone it is ad
miratle ; or in other words it is conciliatory
and fair, yet at the same time it is firm and
' free from the defient temper which some
have" supposed Mr. Johxson would indulge
inl As a Stato paper, its author has breath
ed into it his own calm, well-considered, earn
est," a.nd statesman-like sympathy and wis
dom. .While some may find in Itsome'thing3
they cannot approve, there is solid ground
on which all friends of the Federal Consti
tution,' and States Rights, may stand and
support the President. He supports the
views, taken in his Message of 1865, of the
relations of the States to the Union, and
States Rights, and re-stated in .this, power
fully ,by warnings and arguments from "Wash
ington, Jefferson and Jackson. We ask for
it a carefal perusal by all our patrons.
After the President, in the outstart of his
Message, has" established the fact that the
Southern , States had been recognized as
States, both by the Executive and Legisla
tive branches of the Government, the Pres
idenf re-affinn3 hbold views and opinions as
to their right of representation, and the du
ty of Congress to accord them that right at
the earliest possible moment. lie bases
their right to representation upon tho "great
principle enunciated . in the Declaration of
American Independence, that no people
ought to bear the burden of taxation, and
ydt be denied the right of representation ;"
upon the express provision of the Constitu
tion tbat'each State shall have at least one
Representative," and "that no State, with
out its consent, shall be deprived of its equal
suSrage in the Senate." These are points
which cannot bo shaken, either by law or
logic As to the policy of the course recom
mended by the President,' it reste' upon a
sincere belief .that tie admission of re pre
sentativesfrom the late revoltedStates would
accomplish much towards the renewal and
strengthening of our relations as one people,
arid remove serious cause for discontent and
complaint on the part of the inhabitants o;
the rejected and repudiated States.
"The position of the President upon this
question of reconstruction and representa
tion will be eminently satisfactory to the true
frieuds of republican -liberty in the nation.
It is in full harmony with the theory of our
government and the teachings of the men
who framed it, and alio has the sanction of
a "succession of acts and declarations from
the very party which is now agitatin:? in fa
vor-of consohdation and despotism. The
linefonncrly drawn by the President between
himself and the Radical party upon this vital
issue .has been again marked out with unmis
takable distinctness, and the contest is now,
State right3 and constitutional representa
tion, on the one hand; and on the other,
. Congressional usurpation and national con
solidation. The battle upon those issues will
now be opened in Congress.

The Constitutional Amendment
As the ast .session or the thirty-ninth
Congress mofes on the public mind is again
Btirred into! deep consideration of the soi
called Constitutional amendmentLltiswith
deep pain that we see journals like the Chi
cago Times, the Boston Pott and the Albany
Argus deserting the ancient faith, and aban
doning principle for the sake of expediency.
Basing their arguments entirely upon the
ground of policy, they seem to forget that
the "Democratic party is founded upon the
immutable basis of devotion "to principle,
and cannot sacrifice its convictions of right
Chagrined at the success of the Radicals,
in the late elections, they wish to adopt the
tactics of the enemy, hoping thereby to at
tain the same triumph. Never was there a
greater mistake. Never was there a more
fatal cause, and the great masses of the Dem
ocratic party, who will not abate one jot of
their regard for Constitutional rights, and
who indignantly repudiate any compromise
of principle, will sternly rebuke the coward
ly course of those journals in deserting the
ancient faith and going after strange gods.
The Democratic party ia a necessity of our
form of government. It originated as a le
gitimate consequence from the spirit of our
institutions. It is the conservator of our
liberties, and the guarantor of our constitu
tional rights. Its instinct with principle, is
as immutable as principle, and will neither
pass away nor abandon its high and holy
mission until the Republic is gone, and an
other form of policy established upon the
ruins of the commonwealth. In the name
of the great Democratic party of the country
we indignantly rebnke the course f these
journals above named in recommending the
adoption of the Constitutional amendment,
and protest against their betrayal of the old
faith, their cowardly desertion of their po-
itical brethren, who have fought the good
fight so sternly, steadily and uncompromis
ingly. ....
The 'Constitutional Amendment" is a
violation of the letter and spirit cf the Con
stitution. It is contrary to the forms of the
pact which writes us one nation. It estab-
Ishes a condition precedent to the admission
of the Southern Representatives, which is
utterly subversive of the equality of the
States. . It makes of Congressa gigantic and
remorseless consolidated aristocracy, chang
mg our form of government at one tremen
dous blow. It denies the fundamental ax
iom of the Declaration " of Independence
that all governments derive their just pow
ers from the consent of the governed. It is
a monstrous tcroiig, a . fit sequence "to the
aristocratic teachings of Federalism, and
unworthy is any freeman who endor es it, to
enjoy the benefits of constitutional liberty,
It seeks to plant,' at one effort, upon the
broad basis of political asd social equality,
a.1 ' Jl .. . 1 .1 l . rr
m negro race wun tne wmtes. lhis can
not be done. No mere human legislation,
no tyranical ukase, no despot's command or
minion's slavish obedience, can alter the
immutable work of the Lord GodAlmighty.
Between the negro and the white there is a
gulf eo deep and broad, dug by the hands of
God Himself, that no human effort can
bridge no human legislation fill up. Upon
its lace .the Constitutional Amendment,
seeks to violate to disrupt, to destroy, : the
sacred provisions of the Constitution and to
alter the work of the Living God Himself.
Of necessity it ' cannot succeed. It must
not, it should not ' It is contrary to every
line of our political teaching to every iota
of our political tradition to every tenet of
our political faith. The great Democratic
party of the country are sternly resolved not
to allow such an infamous wrong to be even
temporarily or partially successful, and the
Chicago Tbnet, the Albany Argus, the Bos
ton Post, which are followed by the Wash
ington Star, will meet, are meeting, with
the unanimous and thorouehly indignant re
buke of the Democratic party.
A New Book by Mrs. Eiita D. E. N.
Southwortit. T. B, Peterson & Brothers,
Philadelphia-, have in press and will publish
on Saturday, December 15th, a new book
by Mrs. Emma D. E. N. Southworth, enti
tled "The Bride of Llewellyn," which will,
beyond all doubt, proves to be the most pop
ular and successful work that ha3 ever been
written by her, for she is beyond all question
the most powerful female writer in America,
if not in the world. No one ever read a
chapter of one of her works, without wish
ing to reacT the whole'book, and none ever
read one of her books without admiring the
rare genius of its author, and wishin? that
she might soon write another. Her scenes
are life-pictures, her incidents are" founded
on facts, and her sentiments are character
ized by a singular purity both of conception
and expression, bhe has the rare faculty
of saying what she means, and of saying
it msucn a manner that her. meaning can
not be misinterpreted. In short, she pos
sesses in an eminent degree those qualiSca
tions which are the peculiar prerogatives of
a good writer, and while she delights the
reader's imagination with her descriptive
beauty, see npplieshome truths to his under
standing with the force of rational convic
tion. . The "Bride of Llewellvn" will
welcomed by all such readers especially ; and
those who have never read the worksof this
gifted woman fchoiild not fail . to buy and
read this new novel by this gifted American
authoress.

Extract from a Be rmo n.
; .Th9 following is" an "extract from'the ser
mon preached by Rev. John Chambers, of
Philadelphia, on last Thanksgiving day.! He
ia eloquent, logical and argumentive. Reatf
the extract : " '
As I have already intimated, brethren, wo
have met for the purpose of thanksgiving ;
and, as I have already said, that there- are
innumerable causes of gratitude to God, is
known to you just as well as it is to me, and
that there is no particular period, as I have
already intimated, when -we are to pay par
ticular grrtitude, 1 know not, . unless it is
"when we receive an exuberance of favors
from our Divine Father.
Gratitude is one of the highest gifts of
our nature. The grateful man is always an
honorable man. A non-grateful man, and
what we usually deem an ungrateful man, is
a mean creature. You cannot feci for him
as the heart feels for the grateful man. In
the ordinary walks and business of life this
is bo throughout every age. The gentlemen
before me, and these ladies, that are familiar
with the duties and intercourse of the social
relations of life have observed it
The grateful person you cannot forcet, and
you cannot help respecting him, because in
one who possesses gratitude there is honor in
that heart there is principle there ; but
tha ungrateful man is always an object of
contempt and disgust. You may pity him,
and you cannot help pitying him and having
compassion for him. At the same time, his
ingratitude you talk about as base. For the
ingrate, "I did so and so, and conferred this
favor and that, and now see how he has
treated mc;" andj-ou look at his ingrati
tude, and it naturally excites in the mind
feelings of disgust for that man or that
woman: '
Speaingof the ingratitude of the pres
ent day. in order to prevent the spread of it,
he said the pulpit should pour out an un
broken storm of life, peace and of charity,
and that the public press, instead of being
filled with bitterness and vengeance and
wrath, and trying to inflame the passions and
arraying men in bloody hatred against one
another should be constrained to adopt a
a different course, and if they continue in
this should be. banished from every hearth
stone in the land. They should pursue the
divinely appointed course. What we want
now in this land is peace. , We are an un
happy people.
There is an amount of unhappines3 in this
land that is unknown to any one but God
himself. ' The question which I propose to
you is whether, as a nation of people, we
ought not to-day to be mourning ? We have
met for the purpose of thanksgiving and to
be grateful to God. I say it i3 a question
whether this nation should be clothed in the
garments of mourning or garments of praise.
and I believe in the latter. We have not
reached that point yet There is a vast dea
to be done. ; There is a great deal of hatred
and enmity and of evil feelings in this land
that must be taken away. -
Wc must have all these clashing, dashing
roaring madmen, who are endeavoring to
inflame the passions of the people, comfort
ed, and clothed and in their right niiud, and
have them to learn the doctrines of right
eousness. Look at the condition of the
country at the present day.- Thousands and
tens of thousands of the people have scarce
ly any bread to eat Iu one single region of
the State of Alabama, I am told by one of
tho most intelligent men, there are seven
thousand five hundred men and women,
black and white, that are in a state of star
vation, and in every direction-it is so.
I find in a paper published in the city of
Washington, called the Star, that in that
city4here arc at least twenty thousand col
ored people that do not get upon an average
one day's .work in six. They are literally
running right into the jaws of starvation.
The poor-house is overflowing, says this
paper, and not able to afford shelter for the
swarms ot vagrants that infest the city.
Think of it, that within one hundred and
thirty miles of the city of Philadelphia, in
the Capital of the country, there arc twenty
or thirty thousand people that have not
comfortable homes and are m a state of
starvation. I say we are hypocritical in our
thanksgiving if we do not take care of these
people.
That man is not grateful to God, and he
has not the spirit of God, that sees these
things as they are, and does not do some
thing to alleviate their sufferings.
When I go along Chestnut Street, that
public thoroughfare, I pee the poor, worn
out soldier, with both his leg? or an arm off,
lost in the service of thei: country, grinding
a barrel organ, soliciting the alms of the
passers by. ' , -
These poor men, instead of being in that
way, 'should have comfortable homes for
life, and should be well taken care of. My
soul swells with indignation when I see these
thing-. A young man came to me j'ester
day with his right hand mutilated in the
service of his country, and said he could not
get anything to do. He had been up and
down, but nobody would employ him.
" He urged the people not to let thi3 thing
go any farther, but to subscribe liberally and
furnish a home for those b'rave boys.
Court Proceedin
itre
. The regular December term of Court was
held at this place last week, commencing on
Monday, and continuing- until Saturday
morning. Hon. William Emvem., Presi
dent Judge, and his Associates, Irani Derr
and Peter K. Jlerbein, were on the bench.
On the first day there was very little done,
besides taking reports from the different
Constables of the County, calling over the
list of J urors, charging the Grand Jury and
appointing a Foreman for the same.
. The following is a synopsis tf the Com
monwealth and civil causc3 which were dis
posed of during the week:
Com. V3. William Beaver. - Indictment,
"Larceny.' "True Bill. A Jury was called.

"Assault and battery." " Not a true bill, and
the prosecutrix, Margaret Knapp, was made

Com. vs. Lewis Bonner. - Indictment,

son or other, the parties were put under bail
for their appearance at our next term.

rejecting a vote of a qualified citizen. True
bill. Case postponed to February term.
John Hinterliter vs. John Jamison. In
this case the J ury brought in a verdict for
tho Plaintiff for ninety-one dollars and
twenty-fn e cents.
Jacob Remlcy vs. the Catawissa Railroad
Company. Jury called ;afer which, the
the Plaintiff made a motion to amend his

Greenwood Township vs. Samuel Bogart
Action for eubrtriptfon moneys for bounty
purposes. - A verdict in favor of the Town
ship, for the amount claimed, was rendered.
Henry Hosier and Wife vs. Cha. Schlus
ser and Wife. For "Slander." Verdict in
favor of Plaintiff for five dollars and costs.
From Washington.
The receipts of internal revenue to-day,
Dec. 2d, amount to $1,627,643,85. -
Major General Sheridan has forwarded to
the War Department a repetition of the
charges of inhumanity against the officers
at the Dry Tortugas, Florida.
It is officially announced that John H.
Suratt, one of Lincoln's assassins, has been
arrested in Europe. The Radicals declare
that this "Government" had information as
long ago as last winter, that Suratt was in
Europe, and they are making themselves
very uneasy over the matter because he was
not arrested sooner, and his life taken. They
are passionately fond of blood.
MEXICAN NEWS. .
Letters from the City of Mexico, receiv
ed at Washington, dated Nov. 11, state the
fact that General Bazaine had given arms
and ammunition to his Mexican Liberals,
and promised them that they would not be
interfered with by the French forces, provi
ded they pronounced for General Ortega,
and proclaimed him as Presidentof Mexico,
THE REPEAL OF THE AMNESTY LAW.
It is generally understood that the Senate
will pass the House bill for the repeal of the
Amnesty Law. It was reported back favor
ably a few days ago by Mr. Trumbull, from
the Judiciary Committee, which indicates
that it is to receive a full party vote. The
better impression is that the President will
not approve it, and that Congress will then
pass it by the requisite two-thirds vote.
THE APPOINTING POWER.
Mr. Stevens will this week endeaver to
press to a vote his bill limiting the Presi
dent's power of appointment to and remov
al from office. It seems to be more satisfac
tory to the majority than any measure of th
kind yet introduced, and the general opinion
is that it will receive a full party vote in the
House, though it may afterwards be subject
ed to amendment in the Senate.
THE SENATORIAL CAUCUS.
A caucus of Eadical Senators took place
lately, called expressly to consult with re
gard to the admission of Colorado and Ne
braska into the Union. No formal question
was taken. But it was agreed that the bills
for thi3 purpose should be called up this
week.
It is rumored that all the French troops
-mm.
will leave Mexico on or about the 1st of
March next. A sensible conclusion on the
part of the French.
MILITIA IN SOUTHERN STATES.
It is said Sejator Wilson will endeavor to
get a vote this week on his joint resolution
to disband all'militia organizations in those
States hereafter.
THE TAX ON COTTON.
Many leading members of the House think
it highly probable that the internal tax on
cotton will be reduced by the present session
of Congress.
NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
It is expected that the speaker of the
House will soon announce the names of the
members appointed a special committee to
visit New Orleans, and investigate the causes
&c, of the late riot in that city. The com
mittee will probably leave for the South on
Tuesday, and be absent about four weeks.
THE SOUTHERN TERRITORY" BILL.
There is much discussion out of Congress
upon the bill looking to the abrogation of
the fctate governments of the South, and
the opponents of the measure are confident
they can defeat it in the Senate, where a
two-thirds vote over the veto could not be
secured.
Carbon County Progressing.
The School Directors of Carbon County
met in Coaveution 011 Tuesday, November
27, and increased the salary of the County
Superintendent, Mr. R. H. IIofford, from
tWO to $1,100 per annum. The Directors
of Carbon are moving in the right direction.
They saw other counties in the State were
paying liberal salaries to Superintendent,
and using the general State fund for educa
tional purposes ; and although there arc but
ona hundred schools in Carbon County, they
desired that the Superintendent should be
remunerated sufficiently that he could devote
his whole time to the schools and not be
compelled to neglect the work of education
in following other pursuits to gain a liveli
hood. The County Superintendent is re
quired to make at least two circuits through
th2 county one for examinations of teach
ers and another to visit each school While
performing these duties he is continually bur
dened with the expenses of travel, which,
with the present rates of living, will soon
amount to half the sum of eight hundred
dollars. The expenses of keeping a horse
trill, of itself, make a large expense. Thus
any one may see the wisdom of the Carbom
County Directors."" r V" .f -4
The Superintendents are paid from the
State fund, and hence each ! county contrib
Tites to pay the Salaries of all other. County
Superintendents in the State, as well as the
salary of its own Superintendent. There
fore, while many counties in convention vote
salaries from $1,500 to $2,000 per annum,
it was thought by the Directors of Carbon
that their Superintendent should receive at
least a living compensation. The work of
the Superintendent of Carbon County if it
be considered in reference to the number of
schools is not quite two-thirds of the work
to be done by the Superintendent of Co
lumbia. Carbon has one hundred schools,
Columbia one hundred and sixty-four. The
salary in Columbia is just the amount paid
in Carbon before the increase $800. Blair,
with one hundred and thirty-eight schools
pays $1,000. Clearfield, with one hundred
schools, pays $1,000. Delaware, with ninety
eight schools, pays $800. Lawrence, with
one hundred and forty-two schools, pays
$1,000. .
Teachers' County Institute.
The attention of Teachers, Directors and
all other persons, feeling an interest in edu
cational progress, is called to the County
Teachers' Institute, to be held in Blooms
burg, the latter part of this month. The
Institute will be called to order at 10 o'clock,
A. M., on Wednesday, tho 26th inst, and
continue during the remainder of the week,
holding three sessions "eah day. It is of
the very greatest importance to the educa
tional interests of Columbia County, that a
special effort be made by every individual
to secure a full attendance of Teachers,
Directors, and others, earnest in promoting
general intelligence. These Institutes afi'ord
peculiar opportunities to Teachers to ac
quire knowledge of the best methods of
conducting Schools of governing and in
structing. They may, also, be found bene
ficial to Directors, by conveying to them
many ideas of management and skillful in
struction in schools, from which Directors,
and particularly District Superintendent,
may more readily understand the condition
of Schools when visited, and form intelli
gent opinions of the Teacher's competency,
in truth, the Institute is not only as be
lieved by many a mer- personal benefit to
Teachers, but resuits in arousing greater
earnestness in intellectual pursuits with those
who attend, and through them the same
spirit of advancement is carried to the whole
people. It is urged, therefore, that all
persons will use their best efforts to cause
a Buccesal'ul County Institute. . Let Teachers
and Directors work together, and let there
be not only a full attendance of Teachers,
but also of Directors. Experienced Institute
Conductors and Lecturers will be in attend
ance throughout the session.
