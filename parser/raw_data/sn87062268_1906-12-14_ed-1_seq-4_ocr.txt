I An exchange is cruel enough to re
I mark that if Boni marries again the
lady in the case will have to get

It would make old Noah Webster
swell with pride if he could listen to
I the eulogies being paid him by the
members of congress who object to
the new system of spelling

Apalachicola paper conies out for W

while the Cnrrabelle paper
lines up for Albert Jennings
The New Orleans Picayune says the
1 unwritten law in the South is
lauded as the bulwark of female
honor but that it is an extremely
curious institution in that it gives to
the man who shoots in defense of
womans honor his liberty while it
sends to the penitentiary for life the
woman who shoots to protect her own
honor If the unwritten law de
fense is allowed to one sex it should
be allowed to both it is used con
stantly in behalf of men and its pro
tecting power should not be denied
to women
If affairs in Utah are as bad as
Senator Burrows pictures them it is
about time for the federal govern
ment to do a little investigating out
there and see to the proper enforce
ment of the laws In a recent speech I
in the senate the Michigan senator
who is of the same political faith
as
I
Heed Smoot said The moment it
Is Jmown that a candidate has the en
dorsement of the church and the
per
mission of the hierarchy to be
a can
didate that moment he has back of
him the whole power of the Mormon
church and his election is assured
There has been no case in which a
candidate for a high office in Utah
has obtained the consent of the
church to run and has been defeated
The Gainesville Sun defines the
printers devil as follows I
The term printers devil
as applied
to the boy who docs the choring
around a printing office has a pecul
iar romantic history In early days II
printing was styled the black art
and printers were supposed to be in
league with Satan But it was in the
time of Aldus Miuutius in Venice that I
the matter took a serious turn This
was the famous printer who first pub
fished the Greek and Roman classics
He took into his
employ
a negro boy
who was homeless on the streets of
Venice The people supposed the
boy was an imp from Satan and that
lie assisted In printing Mobs col f
lected about the
oHlce and were
about to wreck it when the boy was
brought forward and exhibited and It
was shown that the boy was flesh
and blood but he was still called the
printers devil and every boy in his
position ever since has been so
called
The Live Oak Democrat is an ar
dent admirer of the president and
believes this an ill time to speak of
Roosevelt with flippant disrespect
Says the Democrat
President Roosevelt has been a
growing man ever since he got into
tho White House and especially has
be broadened on Southern questions
and shown a real sympathy with us
in our efforts to solve the problems
which confront us He grows less
partisan every day ahd in his atti
tude in tho discharge of the negro
troops he takes the exact Southern
view which is manifestly the right
one and the Southern press should
give him its cordial and unanimous
endorsement on that issued This is
no time to be speaking of the Presi
dent with flippant disrespect and put
ting him in the attitude of an inveter
ate enemy of the South for he loses
no opportunity to show u just the
contrary

A Solution of the
Immigration Problem
One of the most serious problems
of the Southern states is the problem
of Immigration While vast num
bers of desirable immigrants arrive
in this country annually nearly all of
them find a home in the north and
west comparatively few coming to
the south notwithstanding the fact
that the Southern states today offer
unequalled advantages to both the la
boring man and the farmer
To overcome these conditions the
Southern Immigration and Industrial
Association was formed and has since
worked intelligently toward the end
sought A meeting of the association
was recently held at Columbia S C
at which the Immigration question
was discussed in all its phases and
plans formulated as the basis of an
intelligent campaign The plans in
substance are
The establishment by every south
ern state of departments of immi
gration and commerce
Such a modification of existing im
migration laws as will render effec
tual the work of these state depart
ments
The diversion of Atlantic steamship
I service to southern ports to the end
of building up an independent south
ern commerce and securing desir
able immigrants for this section
The systematic refutation of slan
ders tending to impede immigration
to the south
The best endeavors to correct
abuses that may reflect in any way
injuriously upon the people of this I
section I
A thorough compaign of education
to increase interest in and attendance
on technical agricultural and indus
trial schools in the interest of the
south
I All of these methods have been dis
cussed in a more or less desultory
manner from time to time but pre
vious to the meeting of the association
ation had not been put before the
people of the South in concrete form
All that is now needed apparently
is practical assistance toward putting
the plans outlined into operation
There can be but one result if the
work is carried on intelligently and
energetically and that result will be
success
That My Dear Maria letter of the
president to Bellamy Storers wife
shows Roosevelt to have been very

The Journal predicted a few days
ago that the action of the pardoning
board in Tallahassee last week would
bring forth the usual class and
amount of criticisms Here is one
from a South Florida paper
On Thursday last the Pardoning
Board of the state met at Jackson
ville As usual it displayed the want
of judgment that has characterized
its sittings for many a long day up
setting long and tedious inquiries
and court trials which resulted in the
conviction of dangerous criminals
some of them murderersby granting
them conditional pardons nearly
Always equivelant to absolute free
dom It will not be long at this
rate before trial in Florida court
will be looked upon as a farce and
the thing known as punishment will
cease to have any terror for the felon
In tho hands of1 these exceedingly
sympathetic gentlemen it Is gradually
becoming a myth
The editor was evident in such
a hurry to get in the first shot at
the boards action that he overlooked
the fact that tho capital is located at
Tallahassee and has been there con
tinuously for eightytwo years

One of the strongest appeals in tho
presidents recent message to congress
is his appeal that the standard of the
army and navy maintained And in
this connection he remarks that there
should soon be an Increase in the
number of men for our coast defenses
these men should be of the right type
ed
and properly trained and there should
be an Increase of pay for certain
skilled grades especially in the coast
defenses
The present condition of the coast
defenses of this country seems not to
be generally known As a matter of
fm
fact we havent half enough of them
to start with and not half enough offi
cers and men to man the ones we
have The personnel of that branch
of the service Is all right but in case
of war with anything like a firstclass
power our coast defenses would be
ridiculously inadequate
And upon our coast defenses it is
not too much to say depends our fight
ing strength in time of war more than
upon any other one branch of the ser
vice
We might have a navy as strong as
those of Great Britian and Japan put
together but if the ships were com
pelled to act merely as floating forts
in defense of the coast what good
would that navy do in time of war i
The legitimate function of a navy is
aggression if we were to get mixed
up with some foreign power now our
navy would have to put in its time
almost entirely at defensive work The
ports of neither the Atlantic nor the
Pacific coast are none of them ablto
take care of themselves in time of
war And this is to say nothing of the
dependencies such as the Philippines
and Hawaii
If the recent trouble in San Fran
cisco had actually develooed into a
war with the Japanese those clever
little fighters would have had so much
unprotected sea coast to strike at with
ths
their fleets that their only embarrass
ment would have been a choice be
tween so many soft spots They might
have begun at Alaska or they might

have begun at the Philippines or at
both at once or they might have
taken a fancy for the rich cities on
Puget Sound but they would have
met with little real resistance so far
as any land fortifications went no
matter where they started Whatever
ships we have in Pacific waters would
have been compelled to have made
forts out of themselves so to speak
taking the aggressive against Japan
t would have been out of the question
1 On the other hand Japan has a navy i
which is the efficient fighting force
It is because it can take the aggres
sive It is not tied to the task of
defending home ports It can get
loose and start something The Jap
anese naval commanders kept carry
i
ing tho fight to Russia all the time
in the recent war They could do that I
because the coast of Japanand
theres a lot of coast to the area in
that island empire was adequately
defended
The finest riavy on earth is cramped
and crippled unless it can be used as
a navy We might as well build brick
battleships along the coast as make it
impossible for our steel ones to leave
the vicinity of the important ports
f h0 rich cities of the Atlantic coast in
their present inadeauately protected
condition must constitute almost a
temptation to some firstclass power
The bill which proposes the in
crease in the coast artillery should
pass without any serious oppositon
It is approved by both the war department
ee
partment and the president The
I
most singularly illogical thing on I
tf earth would be for congress to make
large appropriations for naval increase
I
crease and neglect to lay the founda
tion which alone can make a navy
useful We need the naval appropria
tions tco of course but the greatest
need in a military way is adequate
coast defenses That is the key to our
whole military establishment We
