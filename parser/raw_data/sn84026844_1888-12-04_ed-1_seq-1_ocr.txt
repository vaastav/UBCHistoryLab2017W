that we no longer have dangers to

Tho time rather admonishes us to
jerly inquire whether in the past we
ve always closely kept in the couree of

y plain and clear which leads to bapiew
aud prosperity. When the spirit
our Government was undertaken the
?rt adopted for our guidance was the
istitution. Departure from the lines

licate and by restraint within the liintions

ict flagrant injustieo and this breach of ]

Jnder the same laws by which these <

c.existing situation is injurious to the
altli of our entire body politic. It
lies, in those for whose benefit it is
riuittcd, all patriotic love of country,
it substitutes iu its place selfish greed
J grasping avarice. Devotion to Amorin
citizenship for its own sake and for

our national government and the hapnt-ss

o assumption that the government,

vantages are to be gained,
i'he arrogance of this assumption is
iconcoaled. It appears in the sordid
regard of all but personal interests,
the refusal to abate for the benefit of

vantages, through eflorts to control;!
rislution and improperly influence the '

The grievances of those not included
