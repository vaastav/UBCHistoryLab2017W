Captain William Astor Chand-',
ler's Life Story.
Jt Does Not Cover Many Tears, But
i Bustles With. Important Events
I - erved Under Wlue-eler During t!he
Bamtiago Cainpalyn.
William Ator Chanler, the newly
aeeted member of congTtsg from the
(Fourteenth dictrict of New York, is one
of the most interesting- men whom the
recent elections have brought con
spicuously before the people of the
rnntry.
Although Mr. Cba.nl er ia only 81 years
to! age, be is already well known as an
explorer, as & soldier, and as a poli-tioin-
His father was the late J. W.
duuxler, three times elected to congress
Jtj the votes of the citizens of New
jXork. John Jacob Astor was his great-jrest-grandfather,
and he therefore be
foag ts one of the most aristocratic
' and socially important families in
America.
1 Toting Chanler graduated from Ear
ward In 1887, receiving -from the uni
versity the honorary degree of A. M.
fWhen be came of age he undertook &
Pointing trip to Africa, -where he re
aiaiaed for nearly a year. In Septem
ber, 1898, be joined Chevalier von Hoh
Dei, a lieutenant in the Austrian navy,
and together they set out with their
' toaravan from Zanzibar to penetrate
lato the interior of Africa. It was the
Intention of the young explorers to
reach Mount Kenia, . near . Daitcho,
irhieh. ilea a few miles north of the
equator in a region almost mnknown to
white men. For a long time no news
of the daring adventurers reached the
' sutaJde world, and when rumors did
some to the ears of the traders along
she eoast they only confirmed the fears
ef Mr, Chanler's friends. It was re
sorted in London that the expedition
bad stranded at Daltcho. The Geo
graphical society of London confirmed
the report. Grave' fears were enter
tained that Mr. Chanler would never
reach the coast. But in February of the
following year, after sustaining many
hardships and being deserted by many
f his followers, the explorer succeeded
In reaching the coast. , .
i The expedition was not without re
sult, much valuable information was
added to the sum of knowledge of the
Interior ef Africa. Mr. Chanler had dis--covered
and mapped a regjon, hitherto
unknown, "equal Jn erea' to that of
Puj3;SWv:''
Mr. Chanler was matte's fellow of the
Royel Geegraphicai-soclety xf-England
, and a member of the Imperial and
, Boyal institute of Vienna, as a recog
:' virion of his services to science ' and
geography. Eeturning.to America he
wrote an exceedingly interesting ac
count of his adventures in a book which'
he, entitled, "Through Jungle and
Desert." v
This was no small achievement for a
ronng man' just out of college, but Mr,
Chanler did npf rest on his laurel.'
About two years ago he joined Tam
many ha!. , He invaded politics with
fthe same. viger '.which had character
ized bis movement upon Africa and
ifeith about parallel results. His friend
X bis family -now believed him lost
WILLIAM
Based, but be soon emerged from the
truggle with new trophies in the shape
of office and political preferment. His
family -and his friends became recon
ciled to this newest departure of a
jyoung man who need never have dis
tressed himself with, anything more
important than the fit of his coat or the
color of his tie. Then the war with
Spain became the vital Issue of the
lb our, and Mr. Chanler rose to the op
portunity as a trout to a well-bailed
ook. He was one of the first to offer
Ills services to the country. As soon
as it seemed likely that the government
would issue a' call for troops, he set
febout recruiting a regiment of volun
teers, which he proposed to equip and ,

daunted when Gov. Black" declined to
accept his regiment, Mr. Chanler
quitted New York with a few friends
and went to Tampa, intending to join
the stuff of Lacret, the Cuban general.
He was delayed long enough to receive
a commission from the president,
which conferred upon him tbe duties of
assistant adjutant general, with the
rank of captain. He was assigned to
Gen. Wheeler's staff.
Oapt. Chanler served through the
Santiago campaign, being several
times under fire, and receiving mention
for gallant conduct in action in Gen.
Wheeler's dispatches to the war de
partment. '
He was honorably discharged from
the army on October 3. Mr. Chanler is
a good looking young man, with a reso
lute, clean-shaven face. He is tall and
slight, with an athletio build. In man
ner he is frank and straightforward.
He is thoroughly in earnest, and, de
spite his wealth, has been in every
sense the architect of his own career.
A Cbliioe Decree.
WASHINGTON,' Dec' 6. The secreta
ry of state has received a copy of a de
cree recently issued by the empress of
China having for its object the better
protection of foreign residents in that
country. The decree' says in part:
"From the opening of ports to foreign
trade to the present time foreigners and
Chinese have been as one family with
undivided interests, and since mission
aries from foreign countries are living
in the interior we-have decreed, not
three or four times, but many times,
that the local officers must protect them
and that the gentry and people of all
provinces must sympathize with our
desire for mutual benevolence; that they
must treat them truthfully and honest
ly, without dislike or suspicion, with the
hope of lasting peaceful relations."

went ashore about 1 o'clock, and the
captain and mate were drowned. Two
of the crew were able to reach shore in
safety, and four others were taken off
by the life saving crew in the breeches

went adrift from the Hen and Chickens
in the storm a week ago, was seen
about five miles south of Block island

FIRST DAY'S DOINGS.
Senate Adjourned After the Reading
Several Bills Introduced in the
House.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. When the
enate convened yesterday to begin the
closing session of the Fifty-fifth con
gress, the chamber presented a notable
and beautiful appearance. By 11 o'clock
the public and private galleries were
filled almost to their capacity with a
distinguished assemblage, including
many ladies in brilliant attire.
On the floor of the senate the display
of flowers was unusually beautiful, even
tor the opening day of a session of con
gress. The odor of the flowers filled the
chamber. The memorable scenes en
acted in the chamber during the last
session and the momentous events that
have occurred since congress last 'ad
journed created a feeling of intense ex
pectancy on the part of both the spec
tators and the members of the senate.
This was made manifest by the long
lines of people in the corridors anxious
to gain admission to the galleries and
by the early arrival of the senators on
the floor.
Through the courtesy of the vice pres
ident the members of the Joint high
commission were admitted to the floor
of the senate and were the recipients of
much attention.
Just before the session was called to
order several well known members of
the diplomatic corps appeared in the
diplomatic gallery. Among them were
Sir Julian Pauncefote, embassador of
Great Britain to the United States and
dean of the corps, with a party from the
British embassy; Mr. Wu Ting-Fang,
the Chinese minister, and party; Mr.
Ye Pum Chin, the Korean minister. Jill
were interested spectators of the open
ing scenes of the session and attentive
listeners to the reading of the presi
dent's message.
: During a recess of three quarters of
an hour, while the senate was awaiting
the presentation of the message from
the president, the members of the joint
high oo admission held an informal levee,
greeting personally nearly all of the
members of the American senate.
The reading of the president's mes
sage, which occupied 2 ours and 18
minutes, was received with very careful
attention for an hour, but after that the
Benatora drifted to the cloakrooms or
to the committee rooms, where they
could peruse the message at their lei
sure in the printed copies which had
been furnished them.
When the clerk had concluded the
reading, Mr. Mason of Illinois present
ed a telegram from Mr. Prltchard of
North Carolina, announcing that illness
prevented his attendance at the open
ing of the session.
At 3.46, on motion of Mr. Piatt of
Connecticut, the senate adjourned.

make particular inquiry in regard to
the character of the lifeboats and life
preservers used upon this steamer."
General Wheeler introduced in the

Cnbnn View of the Message.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6,-r-General Gar
cia, who is still somewhat indisposed,
spent last evening at his hotel. Mr.
Quosada, speaking .for the commission,
said: "The president's message is re
garded as very satisfactory. Its publi
cation at this time will do good, coun
teracting reports that have been spread
In Cuba by people who have not the
real interests of the country at heart.
We have full faith in the United States
and in the Just intentions of President
McKinley, and the men who have made
the revolution In Cuba are aiming to
work with the United States to estab
lish a government that will have the
respect of nations. General Garcia is
well satisfied with the interviews he
has had with American officials. The
Inrormation ne is giving ana gathering

Spain Evidently Doesn't Want
To Cede Us a Caroline .
Work Progressing Fairly Well Judge
Day's Terse Expression The Span
iards Seem to Be Badly Broken Up.
PARIS, Dec. 6. The Joint commis
sion was in session for over four hours
yesterday afternoon. Much of the dis
cussion concerned details as to the
guaranteeing of the rights of Spanish
citizens in the ceded colonies. The de
bate was occasionally energetic, and
the Spaniards, on emerging, appeared
to be dejected. Secretary OJeda of the
Spanish commission, when questioned
after the meeting as to the progress
made, answered excitedly: "I am al
most mad. I cannot talk. We are mak
ing progress." The American commis
sioners declined to say anything fur
ther than that the progress made was
satisfactory. The Spanish commission
ers have received authority to bind
their government on certain matters,
but there are yet important questions
on which their instructions are unsatis
factory, and it is likely that many of
the details involved . in the change of
sovereignty in the Spanish possessions
will be left for settlement by the regular
diplomatic processes when relations be
tween the two governments are re
sumed. The history of the document which
will certify the passing of the oldest
colonial power in the' world and the ad
vent of the newest was epitomized by
Judge Day last evening in a single
sentence: ' tv ".
"A peace treaty can contain anything
which the victors put into it." ,'
The Americans had listened for hours
with their customary patience to the
technicalities convoked by the Span
lards with their customary shrewdness
and persistency against every proposal
aiming for the dismemberment of their
empire. Darkness had come on, and
the liveried attendants mobilized by the
French authorities had placed a. tiny
lamp at the elbow of each commission
er. Senator Frye, whose unconcealed
contempt for diplomatic quibbllngs ex
cites the astonishment of the punctil
ious Castllians, had stalked' home, his
patience exhausted. The burden of the
Spanish arguments was that matters
outside the bare cession and evacuation
of the conquered territories which the
Americans' proposed to cover by the
treaty were beyond the legitimate and
customary scope of a peace treaty. Be
hind thla bulwark Senor Montero Rios,
president of the Spanish commission,
fortified himself, bombarding his op-
i ponents with a supply of arguments
and precedents which inspired the free
ly expressed admiration of the AmeP-
1 leans. . Finally Juc'ge Day summarised
I the American position in- the foregoing
memorable utterance. It was given and
taken in good spirit, and from that mo
ment the proceedings . were entirely
friendly.
! The session accomplished much. Eight
open questions were canvassed, seven
being practically settled without note
worthy friction.
! The commissioners decline to say
' what conclusion was reached, but the
bargain for a coaling station in the
Carolines was not cemented, and ac
cording to present prospects it is likely
to fail. The temper of the Americans
. in this matter is: We made you a good
! offer for an island. You may take or
leave it. "
I The Spaniards seem disposed to leave
it. The Americans do not regard It as
a prize which they can demand as one
of the natural fruits of the war, while
the whole policy of the Spaniards Is to
confine the negotiations as narrowly as
possible to the letter of the" protocol
signed In Washington and to exclude
all extraneous matters. The result of
this policy may be the leaving of many
details Involved in the change of sover
eignty over the various possessions to
settlement by the regular diplomatic!
processes when normal relations , be
tween the two governments have been
resumed.
The Spanish commissioners insisted
at the previous meeting that the set
tlement of the status of Spaniards who
remain in the colonies was a problem
so closely akin to cession that it could
not be logically separated from the lat
ter, but should be considered next to
the question of cession and before such
matters as coaling stations and reli
gious toleration. They appealed to the
Americans, having gained all the great
points, to be generous on the minor
ones. Accordingly the American com
missioners were conciliatory yesterday
on the order of procedure as to the
status of Spaniards remaining in the
lost colonies.
The Americans had already promised
to guarantee the return of Spanish pris
oners in the hands of the Filipinos.
Yesterday Senor Montero Rios proposed
that the United States should pay the
expenses of shipping them to Spain, ar
guing, with his customary ingenuity,
that this was a duty of the Americans
as a matter of course. The American
commissioners thought the request un
reasonable and a good deal of time was
consumed in discussing the question.
Another problem entailing long de
bate was the disposition to be made of
the Spanish munitions of .war in a num
ber of military posts outside of Manila
which the Americans have not cap
tured. The Spanish commissioners contend
ed that Spain should be permitted to
ship such munitions home. The Ameri
cans replied that, as the United States
had conquered the Philippines, these
munitions were spoils of war. The
Spaniards finally waived their quibble.
The question of the status of the
Spaniards in the West Indies and the
Philippines who wish to remain there
was nearly settled, as well as certain
commercial questions involving the
rights of shipping under .the Spanish
flag, which will be given advantages.

MR. PORTER COMING HOME
Results of His Investigation Trouble
at Manzanillo.
SANTIAGO, Cuba, T3ec. t. The Unit
ed States special commissioner to Cuba
and Porto Rico, Mr. Robert P: Porter, I
left Santiago for Jamaica yesterday on
board the Admiral Sampson of the
American Mail Steamship line, en route
for the United States. He boarded the
steamer off El Morro.
It is understood that Mr. Porter dur
ing his visit was forcibly impressed
with the necessity of having no su
pervision from Havana of the admin
istration of the civil department here.
In his opinion such supervision would
considerably hamper the movements of
the governor of the province. His Idea
is that while the military authorities
should have supreme control, with one
head, each civil department should be
kept entirely to Itself In administration.
In Mr. Porter's opinion coal should be
admitted duty free for some time in or
der that the valuable timber which is
now used for firewood might be saved,
which would be practicable were the
duty taken off coal.
Major Pettit cables from Manzanillo
that there are many bitter complaints
of cattle stealing near Santa Crux del
Bur, where the Cuban assembly was
recently in session. He- aska if he may
send troops to Santa Cruz del Sur,

came up to her lower deck. The tug J.
McCaulley has been engaged to pump
her and tow her to her destination. She
met the late gale off the capes on the
28th and sprung a leak. Her men were
exhausted on arrival at the breakwa
ter from pumping.
The schooner John H. May, from
Jacksonville, Fia., with lumber for New
York, arrived yesterday, having been
out 17 days. She met the late gale on
the 27th off Hatteras. Tremendous seas

Only on the Outside, However
By a "Democrat" Reporter.
It .Was Simply a Precauti onary Move .
Town Clerk Belden Hesitated About - -Allowing
the Boxes to Be Seen He
Finally Consented and Had Several
. Republicans in Attendance Extra .
Precautionary 'Seals Were Pasted on .
the Boxes.
In order Uhat the citizens of Water- .
bury may not toe misled and to prevent
any conlfusion which might (be octea- .
sioned by the sugared story published. -
in this morning's Republican relative
to the examination of the ballot boxes .
used at the last election, the "Demo-
crat is in a position to state the tacts
just as they are, -without any paddto
or subterfuge. "
In the first place it might toe Just u i
well to state that Town Cleric Belden
did not order an examination of - the
boxes as a precaution against Hbeir
being tampered witia. In the second i. .
place, permission to look at the (boxes -was
asked, not to make a public talk of
it, but simply as a matter of curiosity. . i
In the third place a sight df the "boxes j
was not asked for the purposes of a
newspaper article, ibecause the one
who sought permission (fully under
stood that the least referentoe to the. iv;
boxes .being tampered witai -would re-
fleet on the custodian of (those boxes. ,
This was sought to be avoided, but
this morning's paper has thrown dotwn ;
the bars and has- published a story ?
which is not true In the main: points; -,
and later developments may cause a ?. -
reaction and perhaps hurt where i tt
was intended no hurt Should fall.
Yesterday morning (between 11 ad ' i
12 o'clock, E. Ia Maloney, the city edi- 5,

and found Town Clerk Belden and iv'1

to take the names from the boxes only. '
uierk Belden satd that the 'boxes wars
then placed up on -the (bars toward the

don't you - -bring . im yiour In-

matter and a reply awaited (from Tows
Clerk Belden. The latter "finally ssM
he didn't (have the time to 'look after tt
then. "When will you have the
time?" was asked (htm. "To-moirolw
morning." -was the reply. . After soma
hesitation the representative tot Hhs " .h'
"Democrat" said that (he could not mmSt ' "."
until that tiaie, he would like to ex- i
amine the boxes to-day. "Well, sons . .

there - the (matter rested (for the time , , vj

The representative of the "-Demo- , J

the afternoon 'by accident it was dis
covered that Clerk: Belden had -made
provision (for others to be present at
the examination.' Immediately tin ','
"Democrat" representative invited itwo t ;
others to (be present with (htm. When . .

work (he intended to , do in tjhe first
place. . He took a description of tha
boxes, how they were, pas-ted,, where
pasted, size, by Whom they- were sealed,
how written and toy Whom signed. In . ,
fact a description, of the taibeis .was v -t
taken, similar to the description taken;
before , the -boes were placed up on f
the bars the day after election. . Both, ' ' i
descriptions (being taken accurately, ;
City Attorney Kellogg seeing what the -v
"Democrat" representative was dolus, " 4
proceeded to follow suit and (he took
down some names. - Then some one v-tJ
suggested that some of the "party -place
their names on the seals as a
matter of precaution. This was ' s '
agreed to and Town Clerk (Belden, City 1 ,y
Attorney Kellogg end E. (U Maloney :
placed their names on- the seals. The j
