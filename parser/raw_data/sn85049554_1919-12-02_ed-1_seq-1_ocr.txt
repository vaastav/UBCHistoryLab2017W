WILSON ARGUES
IS PANACEA
Washington, DM. 8.—General rec
omraendatlons on legislation to com
fti
bat' tho cost of living, labor unrest
and radicalism and a readjustment of
tho nation to a peace time basis were
the features of President Wilson's
moesago to congress today. The peace
treaty, the president said, will be dis
cussed later in a separate message, as
will the railroad problem.
President in Message to Congress Favors Buugat
System, Reorganization of Taxing System and
Readjustment of Tariff Laws-To Take Up
Treaty and Railroads in Later Message.
The principal recommendations
were:
Establishment of a budget system.
Reorganization ot the taxation sys
tem.
Readjustment of the tariff system to
meet changed world conditions and
make the system conform with tho
fact that- the United States is the
"greatest capitalist in the world."
Relief and reward for American
soldiers In the world war.
Proper measures to foster the dye
stuffs industry built up during the
war.
An enlarged program of rural devel
opment.
Measures which "will remove the
causes of political restlessness in
our body politic."
At one point the president made his
most extenstve reference to the peace
treaty by saying: "the causes for the
unrest are superficial," and "they arise
from or are connected with the failure
of our government to arrive at a def
inite pcace and the transmission of
revolutionary ideas from seething Eu
rope. and lastly, from the machina
tions of malevolent and passionate agi
tators. With the return of peace this
unrest will disappear."
Wants Anti-Red Laws.
The president renewed his requests
for legislation to deal with those per
rons who "by violent pethpds, would
abrogate our time-testa*! Institutions."
Tome suggestions were made by the
Ident to bring down the cost of
A large part of the message was de
voted to discussion of the rights of la
1 or. A program to "bring about a
general democratization of the rights
of labor" was recommended.
League of Nations as Cure-Ail.
"The only way to keep men from agi
rtatlon against grievances is to remove
the grievances," said the message. At
another point the message said tho
seed of revolution Is repression. "The I
establishment of the principles of or
rajilzed labor laid down in the league
of nations offers us the way to indus
trial peace and conciliation. No other
road lies open to us. Government
must no longer treat labor as a com
modity. The right to strike is invio
late and ought not to be Interfered
with by any process of government,
but there is a predominate right and
that is to protect all its people and
to assert Its power and majesty
against any class."
The president was referring to the
recent Injunction regarding the coal
strike. The message closed with a
reference tQ radicalism and red doc
trines and referred to Russia as a
"painful object lesson of the minori
ties."
"There are those in this country
who threaten direct action to force
their will on the majority. It makes
little different what minority It is, no
sort of privilege will ever be' permit
ted to dominate this country." Orderly
'processes, the message declared, are
(the only methods by which reform
•could be obtained. "Those who pro
pose any other method are enemies of
Jthe country. Xet tho^e beware who
rtake the shorter methods of revolu
tion."
Twrt of Message..
The text of the message follows:
"To the Senate and House of Repre
sentative* I sincerely regret that I
jean not be present at the opening ses
sion of congress. I am thus prevented
from presenting in a direct way the
many questions that need to be solved
this time. 'Happily I have had the
dvlce of the heads of executive de
partments 'and whose thoughtful
recommendations I earnestly second.
PI "In the matter of the railroads and
the readJustment of their affairs 1
shall take the liberty at a later day ot
^•addressing yon. I hope that congress
|wlll bring to conclusion at this ses
*sion legislation regarding a budget

there can be no doubt

a single committee of each house of
congress and bo single appropriations

as may ha,ve .been Included In the
budget prepared by the executive or
added by the-^oommittee on budget
legislation.
"Another. and. not lest Important
aspect of Qr problem Is the ascertain
ment an| economy with which the
moneys »re appropriated and ex
town,the
audit is to aioertaln whether appro
priations have been lawfully ex
ponded. No one is equipped to as
certain whether the money has been
expended wisely and efficiently. The
auditors should be highly efficient
officials, trained in the treasury de
partment, free from the influence of
this or any administration and fully
onfpowered to make reports on the
estimates of the" departments of gov
ernment. Their reports would bo
made to congress and the secretary of
ibe treasury.
Taxes Need Revision.
"I trust tnat congress will give Its
immediate attention to the prooieui of
taxes. Simplification of income taxes
and exccM prodt taxes is uocuaary.
They must, however, be simplified in
order that the tax payer's liabilities
may be made certain and detlnUe.
With references. to the details of the
revenue law the secretary of the treas
ury and "the coidmissioner on internal
revenue wi«l lay before you certain
amendments desirable or uecesoary
for the enforcement or the law—re
commendations which have my ap
proval and-support. It iaof the most
importance•• that' In dealing with this
matter the present law should not be
disturbed for the calendar year. The
congress might well consider whether
the higher rates of Income and rates of
Profits taxes can in peace times be
productive of revenue and whether
they may not on the contrary be de
structive of business activity and pro
ductive of and Inefficiency. There
Is a point at whlcn high rates of

seething Europe, from rising costs of
living, and lastly from the machina
tion of radical ayltators. With the re
turn 1o normal conditions these will
disappear. It scorns to me thnt con
gress should not be impatient or dras
tic in dealing with these but should
seek to romove the causes. It should
seek to bring our country speedily
bagk to ft poaco basis, with a removal
of reetrlctlons on personal liberty that
is consistent with our reconstruction
program. It should arm the courts
with power to deal with those who,
by violent means, would abrogate our
time-tested Institutions. With the free
expression of political news, however
fundamental, there must be no Inter
ference, but town id machinations
tending to incite crime, there should be
no leniency. Legislation to that end
has been recommended by the attor
ney general and should bo enacted. In
this connection I would call your at
tention to rny message of Aug. 8,
which points (to direct cause for bring
ing down the cost of living nnd pre
venting or turning away unrest. On
only on« of these suggestions has con
gress acted.
Weu!d Extend Food Control Act.
"I renew and urge the necessity of
the extension of the present food con
trol act as to extend the Period of
time In which it shall remain in .oper
ation. The attorney general has sub
mitted a bill providing for an exten
sion of six months. As it now stands
it becomes inoperative on the declara
tion of peace. It is imperative, that It
be extended at once. The department
of justice has built up extensive de
partments for its enforcement, all of
which must be abandoned if the bill is
not extended. During this time con
gress will have an opportunity to ex
tend laws regarding ^interstate1ship
ments of goods. Some such regula
tion Is necessary. The abuses that
have grown up In foodstuffs can not
otherwise be eff tlvely prevented.
There can be no douot of the neces
sity of legitimacy of such measure.
As I pointed out In my last message,
publicity can accomplish a great deal.
The aims of tho government must be
brouKht to the attention of the pub
lic. You may have no available funds
to carry on this oampalgn. but ttiere
Is no provision In the law for making
the public fully Informed of the ef
forts of the government. Specif lo rec
ommendation has been made by the
attorney general in. this regard. I
would «rge strongly Its idixnedlate
adoption.
"I also renew my recommendation
that the congress pass a law regulat
ing cold storage as It is regulated, for
example, In the laws of.New Jersey,
l°I.
force curtailment of produotlon, load1 prevent speculative selling and uncon
the banking machinery with credits to scionablo profits. Such a law would
afford an opportunity to establish re
carry unsold products, and produce in
dustrlal stagnation, If we want to sell,
we must be prepared to buy. No pol
icy of isolation will satisfy the grow*
lng needs of America. The provincial
policies of American business in the
past must yield and give way to the
needs of the new dfiy in which we live
—a day full of.hope for American bus
iness if we but will take advantage of
opportunities that are ours for tlie
asking.
"There are other matters of import
ance which are still pressing for eolu
tion. I am sure it is not necessary for
me to remind you that there is one
very immediate and practical question
remaining from "thf war which we
should meet with a line spirit. 4t is a
matter'relating to tut. soldiers." [The
president! then quoted from his last
message to con(r«9» .on the subject,
renewing tho same recommendations.]
Farmers Hslped Win War.
"During the war. the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation.. By. materially increasing
production of, his :hMd, he supplied
America and ths. aliies with the In
creased amount of food neceasary to
keep the armies in ths field. He In
dispensably helped irln ths war.
"The importance of doing everything
possible to prontste production along
economical linss,. to Improve market
ing. and to make rural life' more at
tractive and helpful Is. obvious. 1
would urge approval or tha Plans
already proposed by the secretary of
agriculture to congress to acquire the
necessary suggestion for study of this
question.
"I would urge also the federal par
ticipation In building of good roads
and the need of further action on the
part ot the states and the federal gov
ernment to preserve our federal forest
reserves by the extension, of federal
control and development.* Better

at which they went into storuge. By
this means the purchaser would be
able to learn what profit stood be
tween him and tiie producer or whole*
sale dealer. I would also renew1 my
recommendation that all goods in in
terstate commerce where their naturo
makes it possible, be plainly marked
with the date at which they left the
hands of the producer. We should
formulate a law requiring a federal
license for all firms engaged In Inter
state commerce and embodying In the
lioense specific regulations designed to
form. In. the features of Interstate laws.
Living Costs Too High.
"But tor the moment I confine tny
object to the subject at hand—tho
lowering of the coat of living. No qne
who has observed the march of events
In the lufet war cun fall to see the need
for Improvement. There can be no
settled conditions leading to increased
production and. lower costs of living if
labor and capital are enemies. Sound
thinking and a desire to serve the
whole ration must be applied to the
solution of this great and pressing
problem. Th% failure of other nations
to consider this problem has produced
Jealousies and antagonisms, the breed
ers of radicalism. The only way to
remove grievances Is to remove Ac
oauses of the grievances and thus
prevent disorders in our country, ^hc
send cf revolution Is repression. The
remedy for those things must not be
nega.tive in character. It must be con
structive. The real antidote is not sup-:
preselcn but a deep coivilderation of
the wrongs that beset our national life
and the application of a remedy, ^he
great unrest of the* world oat of which'
has _emerged a demand for considera
tion of the differences between capital
and labor bids us put our own
In order. Frankly, there can be no
settlement of differences which does
not recognize the cojbeptlon for which
labor has struggled for years
"The establishment of the principles
of labor laid down in the league of na
tion* opens the way to conciliation..
No other way is open to us."

New York, Dec. S.—Henry Clay
Frick died here today. Mr. Frlck suf
fered an attack of ptomaine poison
ing early In November. He hud near
ly recovered from this when -compll
catlona developed. He waa 9 years
old.
Career Romance in Industry.
The career of Henry Clay Frick has
formed one ot the most fascinating
chapters In the romance of Industry in
the United mates. At 10, a loy on a
farm in a tamliy ot only ordinary
means, he was, at 60, a man ot so
many millions that his fortune, like
thoee of Carnegie and Rockefeller, was
largely a matter of gueswork even to
himself. It has been said he waa
worth more than $100,000,000, perhaps
as much as $200,100,000.
Mr. Frick built tip the greatest coke
business In the world, and acquired
'such vast Interests in steel that he
was also one of the principal magnates
In that Industry, and In rounding out
his career he became know as one of
the world's greatest collectors of mus
ter paintings.
Mr. Frick was born Dec. 19, 1819,
at West Overton, Pa. This village was
named after the maternal grandfather
of Mr. Frick, Axragn Overhoit, whose
original family name was Oberholteer.
and. wH6 settled In west Pennsylvania
when .that region waacegarded as toe
frontier of civilisation. As the set
tlements along the Allegheny and
Monongahela grew, and Pittsburgh
emerged from its swaddling clothes.
First Indications of Overhoit became the leading miller
and distiller of western Pennsylvania.
His daughter, Elizabeth, married John
W. Frick. a young man of Swiss an
cestry, who at that time was working
an
engineer in tho Overhoit distill-
ery. It was frpm this union that the
future capitalist waa born. The father
attempted farming,, but did not make
a remarkable success of it and as a
result young Henry Clay Frlck was
practically adopted Into the Overhoit
family when he was about 12 years old.
He received a good basic schooling,
but there was nothing in his boyhood
to Indicate the remarkable ability
which characterised his later life, ex
cept his eagerness to get Into business.
For a time he was bookkeeper In hi»|
grandfather's distillery, an/1, tr^m thlsj
position he went to Morgan & Co.,
coke dealers, and at about 21 years of
age he appeared In Pittsburgh as their
agent The coko Industry was in its!
Infancy. The Iron masters of Pitts
burgh were Just beginning to asj"icl
ate the value of coke for their fur- I
naces. Young Frlck had an oppor
tunlty to acquire a limited Interest In
a plant near Broadford. and out of the
profits of this he acquired other hold
lngs. He later Joined a company to
build a railroad to penetrate the Con
nelsvllle coke region, and In 1S71, the
year this road was opened. Mr. Frlck
organised the corporation of Frick &
Co., which bought coal land and coke
ovens in the Connelsvllle region. That
waa the basis of tho Frick fortune.
The undivided attention of the risl ig
financier was given to coke until 1882.
Joins Carnegiee.
In the ml}8t of this period there
came the panic of '78 and the financial
crash of many ambitious operators. At
a sheriffs sale Mr. Frlck purchased
additional fraota of coal land and
ovens, fend .few years later the Mell
ons, powerful Pittsburgh bankers, be
came interested In the expanding en
terprise of ^ke young operator.
The Qarnsfios, then developing their
great steOl business In Pittsburgh, had
taken large holdings In the Frlck coke
company, Wjd in 1SS2 Mr. Frlck found
the Camdfle 'brothers willing to ad
mit him ap a member of their firm In
consideration
ot
gluing them furth­
er interests In his coke business. It was
thus Mjr. Frlck became also a great
manufacturer of steel.
Thru the Homestead strike ot 1892,
Mr. Frlck came into national promi
nence. Differences had arisen between
the Catnegle Steel Company and Its
emptoyeis over a Wage scale, culminat
ing In 4 Strike Involving thousands of
men the calling out of tho national
guard and the proclamation of martial
la*. It was at this period. July 22,
1892, that Alexander Berkman, a New
York anarchist tried to assassinate
Mr.' Frlck. Berkman walked Into
Frlck's office, drew a revolver and
fired, the' builet lodging In Mr. Frlck's
neck. Mr. Frlck* was shot a second
time and then he grappled with Berk
man. During the encounter Mr. Frlck
was stubbed three times, but he down
ed his asaallant' and held him until
ttio police arrived. Bsrkman was tried
and sent to' the Western Penitentiary
tn UttshWW twenty-one years.
'It Waa Wr. Frl6K who later took over

ft ill1
fifty years a minimum annual supply
of 1.200,000 tons of ore, driving a
shrewd bargain with the Rockefellers
who owned tht^e ore lands.
Breaks With Carnegie.
Later Mr. Frick conceived the prop
osition of buying out Mr. Carnegie
entirely, and In association with Henry
I'lilpps, tho stcond largest owner of
stocks, and with the co-operation of
JC. H. Moore and others, Mr. Frlck ask
ed Mr. Carnegie for an option on his
Interests. Mr. Carnegie demanded $1.
000,009 for a ninety-day option and
n*med »157.9:0.000 In cash and bonds
for his entire holding. Tills puce with
the additional cost of the stock of the
othor purtners In the Caruvgj^com

plan collapsed. Mr. Frlck*r ^jvLlon ex
piring at a cost of a ml* & dollars
which Mr. Carnegie p/. V«-d. This
was the first failure ftr'rlck hud
ever known, but it wW a b'ow to
Mr. Carnegie for thf Vlure of the
Frick syndicate left. in the posi
tion of having been on ^e inwrket with
his holdings which apparently could
not be sold.
In 1903 times became hard and t'nl
ted States steel dropped to a low level.
Mr. Frlck then bought everything h«
could in the way ot steel stock and
when the excitement was over It was
found he had acquired enough to be a
power :n that concern. His first movo
was to dethrone Mr. Schwab as prepl
dent, but W. K. Corey, another Carne
gie man, succecded Schwab. Then Mr.
Frick attacked Corey and succeeded
In having him removod, snd Mr. Far
roll. Frlck's frleutl. was finally made
president of the great corporation.
The breach between Mr. Frlck and'
Mr. Carnegie never fntty healed.
On Dee. id, 1SS1, Mr. l?rtck was
married to'Miss Ada Howard Ctrl Ids,
of Pittsburgh. Four chMdren wore
born to them two boys and two girls.

less of tho fact that the sennt has not I
ratified the peace treaty. It Is resardod\
as certain that Germany will find tho
United States and nil the other powers
working to mako tho treaty effective.
