N F.,K^ES FIGHT IN LOCKED ROOM TILL
THEY DROP.
A piEK PROJECTS FROM THE LUNG OF ONE
-TENEMENT HOUSE TERROR
STRICKEN.
Tivo negroes hacked each other with dirks in
dark room, with the door locked, last night,
tiil both were exhausted. They were then ar
• • rested, one betas nearly dead. They were George
X Harri*. of No. 412 East One-hundred-and-twen
"* ty-fourth-st., and Richard Anthony, of No. 409
Es.-t One-hundred-and-twenty-fourth-st. Har
ri?« left i'Jrig was punctured.
The fight occurred in Harris's room. Anthony
if known as "One Eyed Dick." His wife shot
jjirn in the eye seme months ago for talking tt>
other women. Anthony has been frequently in
the company of a woman liked by Harris, and
the men have a grudg.- against each other.
Anthony went to Harris's room to settle it last
eight.
Harris was alone, but the house was filled
rith Mcraee. As soon as Harris saw Anthony
be seized a club. The door was locked by one
pf them. Anthony was struck on the head with
the club, and he drew a knife. Harris drew a
kr.if- and j.ut out the light. No one but himself
knows why.
Tht-n for fifteen minutes the negroes fought a
duel in the dark. The house was in an uproar,
lien and women hurried from all parts of the
house and from neighboring ones to see what
•was happening-. Many gathered outside the
room ia which the men were stabbing each
other, or stood <-n the stairs. The men could be
heard cursing, frilling- over chairs and on the
floor or against some piece of furniture. Npne
dared try to enter the room. Some of the
women ran back to their rooms and hid in
closets. Occasionally could be heard cries of
pain and fear, the crowd outside knew a knife
had •!•!••■ execution.
After a. quarter of an hour of horror to the
crowd, there was a groan inside the room and
then quietness. The police came in. The door
was pushed in by two big officers. One of them
aa *c a i:ght-
Ehe crowd h.:lf fearfully pushed in. The two
negroes were lying Li different corners of the
room, onconsdoua from loss of blood. For some
minutes Intimate friends could not tell which
was •.:».. The men were covered with blood
r.nd their clothing was in shr.-lf. Furniture was
overturned, and *.he scars cS knife jabs could be
Ft-en on it.
The blood was «rasw»d away from the face of
one. who proved to be Harris. A dirk stuck out
of his breast. His face was lacerated and cut.
H-s rlotbes wore cul apart back and front. A
doctor found that the knife had penetrated a
lung.
Anthony was in better phnpe af far as wounds
vere concerned, but be looked worse than Har
ris. He bad more bijuties than his antagonist,
but none \\.r. BertOUS, though their number
made him weak. Dr. Green, of the Harlem Hos-
BttaL drrssed bis injuries, and the man respond
ed to restoratives remarkably, showing enor

'WARE 7HE AMERICAS PERIL.
DR. FA ACHE TELLS THE GERMANS
GRAVE DANGERS THREATEN THEM.
Berlin, Dec. 4. — In the course of the tariff de
bate in the Reichstag to-day. Dr. Paache, of
Halle University, sounded the strongest warning
concerning the American peril which has yet
been uttered, mr. Paache visited the United
States In IW9 to study the social and industrial
conditions there. Since his return he has been
lecturing on the changed balance of the world's
trade wrought by the dominating growth of the
United States.
During his address the speaker laid before the
house masses of figures which set forth the ex
pansion of the American manufactures and of
American foreign commerce, of recent years,
and the enormous accumulation of wealth in the
United States. He accompanied his statistics
with a philosophical analysis supporting the idea
that Germany's most iiangcrous and most im
mediate trade- enemy was the United States. Dr.
Paache said:
Peculiarly grave dangers threaten us from
America: against these we must put ourselves
In a state of defence.
Pr. Paachr was particularly impressed by the
rapid growth of the cotton goods trade in the
Vnited States, which he said now dominated
the market of the world.
Referring to th^ paragraph in President
Roosevelt's Message to <"ongresn concerning
reciprocity. Dr. Paache said:
America makes a feint of adopting a policy
of n-.ore liberal c immercial treaties, but she is
determined to abandon nothing of her protective
system. What would it profit us if we got a.
slight reduction of duties which are now abso
lutely prohibitive? In spite oi this our "treaty
ites"" say we d<. not dare to r.-iiso our duties.
The Yaiike* has not a trace of such sentimental
politics.
Th^ speech was sustained with a mountainous
array of documents, such as are peculiarly
grateful to the German mind. It was evident
that Dr. Paache's speech impressed the mem
bers of the Reichstag.
Herr Goethein, secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce of Breslau and a free trader, who
was recently elected to the Reichstag from
a strong agrri«ultural district, warned the Reichs
tas against adopting defensive legislation di
rected at the United States, us I*r. Paache de
manded. Ht-rr Goethein referred to the Impor
tance of the tradf relations between Germany
and the I'nited States, adding what he said
Count yon Pos-adowsky-Wehner, Secretary of
the Interior, had forgotten to say yesterday
when he took up the cudgels in defence of the
bill, that '-our exports last year to the United
States were larger than those of any preceding
year Many people in Germany demand a tariff
war on the I'nit'd States, especially the iron
men, who complain of the I'nlted States' inch
duties. While we should not try to avoid •*
tariff war und?r all circumstances, still let us
not play with the idoa that such avoidance
would be unpatriotic."
MAT BE MIBB CROPSEY.
YOUNG WOMAN FOUND AT WILSON. N. C.,
PARTIALLY IDENTIFIED AS MISS
ING GIRL.
[BT TELEGRAPH TO THE HUMJSft.]
Wilson. N. C. Dec. 4.— This place was thrown into
a great state of excitement to-day over the arrest
of a girl thought to be Miss Klla Cropsey. who so
mysteriously disappeared from Elizabeth City last
.-■. i '.th. Xo proof has yet hepn obtained tnat the
girl held here is the one wanted, but in any event
she and the man travelling with her evidently
have good reason to conceal the truth reearding
their home and the past. On Monday morning a
couple drove into the city from the east, and
stopped at Mrs. Ward's boarding house under the
names of Mr. and Mrs. Mackay Durham. On
Monday afternoon Durham got drunk, and was
locked up in the police station, where he remained
all night.
Tho girl claiming to be his wife, on hearing; of his
arrest, was greatly agitated, and remarked that
she never expected to see him again. Durham was
greatly perturbed, and on his release on Tuesday
morning they hurriedly left town in a buggy, driv
ing in the direction of Raleigh. Soon after the
couple left some boarders at Mrs. Ward's house
saw a photograph of Miss Cropsey, and they
agreed that it was that of the girl who had just
left the house. The police w»-re soon in pursuit of
the couple, knowing of the several rewards, and
two officers caught them about nftf-en miles from
Wilson, and brought th'-m back to town. Nothing
was found on either of them disclosing their
identity, but on a tag on Durham's watch charm
was stamped Elizabeth City.
They were examined separately by Mayor Her
ring, and their stories are contradictory in every
respect. The man is about thirty-five years old,
with a light mustache. He said he lived in Raleigh.
but could not give his address while there. The
girl says they were married a few days ai;o, that
they have been in the neighborhood of Elizabeth
City hunting, but had not been in that town. She
first denied knowing a man named Wilcox. but
afterward stated that she did know a man by th«t
name. She stated that they came from near Eliza
beth City in a public conveyance and on canoes up
the rivef, and that at Aurora Durham fired at her
with a gun. missing her h-a<i only a few inches.
She gave her maidr-n name as Mise Kersey, of
Chattanooga, T<nr... but afterward, on being asked
her address, stated that sne lived near there on a.
truck farm. She says sh<- has been in Xorth Caro
lina only -ibout one year and In the eastern part
of the State about seven Weeks. She is much dis
tressed and greatly troubled.
A young woman whr. lives here, and who knew
Miss Cropsey In Elizabeth City three years ago,
was sent for, and identified her. Two men who
knew her siightly also are positive she is Miss
Croppey. Th. description telegraphed here answers
her In all particulars as to height, weleht. color of
hair and eyee but her teeth are different from
those describe*!. The authorities at Elizabeth City
were informed of her arrest, and persons were ex
pected to-night to fully identify her, but they
lllllMll ill connections, and cannot reach here before
to-morrow.
Andrew G. Cropsey, the uncle of the missing girl,
said in his law office, at No. 3 Chamhers-st. yes
terday afternoon that he did not place much de
pendence in the report thai Miss Ella Cropsey had
bc»n found at Wilson. N. C. He s.ii'J he had s*-nt
telegrams to the police of Wilson and to liis
brother at Elizabeth City. asking If th.- idpntiiica
tion of the young woman was complete, but be had
not received a reply to either message. His brother,
he was iohi by newspaper nif-n, had not been able to
go to Wilson from ESUsabetb City by a train yes
terday.
There were reports in this city yesterday that
Miss Cropsey had been seen at the Walton House, in
Philadelphia, and later crossing the ferry to Nt-w-
York, in company with an elderly man, but Mr.
Cropsey said he did not believe the reports.
DOUBT AT MISS CUOPSEY'S HOME.
Elizabeth City. N. C, Dec. 4.— The news from
Wilson, N. C. of the detention there of a woman
partially identified as Miss Nellie Cropsey has cre
ated little interest here among the girl's family
or officials of the town. It Is believed here that
tl is same woman and her companion were exam

Police several days ago and found not to be Miss
Cropsey. though resembling her. An expert diver
«Dent the day searching the bottom of the river
above the pier near the Cropsey house, in the hope
of finding thr- body, but discovered nothing. Xo
clew of value has yet been found, and the strange
case is practically In the same position it was the

At 8-45 o'clock to-nicht Chief Dawson received a

BRITISH SHIP THOUGHT TO HAVE
TURNED TURTLE ON OREGON
COAST— TWENTY-EIGHT LIVES
BELIEVED TO BE LOST.
Astoria, Ore.. Dec. 4. — The bar tug Tatoosh,
which has just returned to port, reports that
the British ship Nelson, Captain Perriam,
turned turtle last night and went to the bot

■was reported to have shifted her cargo. She
had a bad list to starboard and could go only
one tack. Yesterday afternoon the tuk Tatoosh
went out and picked up the Nelson, passing a
hawser. The tug started oft shore with the ship,
owing to the gale. It was the intention of Cap
tain Bailey of the Tatoosh to remain with the
ship during the night. The gale that raged last
night was too severe for the vessel to with
stand, and she broke from the tug and then
turned turtle, sinking at once.
In the darkness it was impossible for the tug
to lender assistance to the members of the crew
who were not carried down, and all perished.
The Nelson carried a crew or twenty-eight men
all told. She was an old wooden vessel. Cap
tain George W. Woods, the bar pilot, was to
have been p'.ared aboard the ship last night,
but the weather was too rough to permit it.
Captain Woods states that the Nelson went
over between 1«> and 11 o'clock last night in
the height of the gale.
The Nelson carried a cargo of lumber and was
consigned to Cape Town. South Africa, by Tay
lor. Young & Co., of this city.

tow, returned to Astoria at 1 p. m. ?ho reports
that the hawser parted at 10 p. m. last night
while towing the Nelson offshore. The tug re
mained out until noon, but saw nothing more
of the Nelson. The pilot claims the ship was
in a safe condition, and may have resumed her
voyage.

GROUT CHECKS THE TIGER
SCHEME IN IMPROVEMENT BOARD
WHICH. IT IS SAID. WOULD
MAKE QUEENS CANAL PRI
VATE PROPERTY.
Controller-elect Grout and Borough President
Bowley of Queens yesterday blocked a remark
able attempt In the Board of Public Improve
ments to have the city adopt a map of the. pro
posed canal from Flushing Bay to Newtown
Creek that would, according to Mr. Bowley,
prevent the city from owning the canal, as pro
vided for In a resolution passed by the board
on July 3. Mr. Bowley said that the State had
granted a franchise to the Flushing and New
town Canal Company for the construction and
absolute private control of a cansl over the
identical route proposed for the city's canal.
As soon as the map came up for adoption, at
the instance of President Hoiahan of the board.
Mr. Bowley said that the map about to be
adopted was not in accordance with the resolu
tion providing for a 3trip of land l.'kd feet wide
on both sides of the canal to be acquired by the
city, and that if the map were adopted the city
would lack ownership of the canal for two and a
half miles at each end.
Mr. Grout at once became interested, and
wanted an explanation from Mr. Risse, the city's
engineer. Mr. Risse said that it was not prac
ticable to draft a complete map showing just
what the improvement was to be, and that a
sectional map was all that could bo shown. The
explanation did not suit Mr. Grout.
"The only question," said he. "is that you did
not ask the board for Instructions when you
failed to do as the resolution ordered. I move
that the resolution of July 3, ordering a map to
be filed, be rescinded. This map here is not a
lawful map, because it Is not one ordered by the
board."
• "Isn't the section filed in accordance with the
resolution?" asked President Holahan, turning
r8 "Why do you file only half a map?" tartly de
manded Mr. Grout, adding: "I move that the
resolution be rescinded." .
Bridge Commissioner Shea urged Mr. Howiej
to offer some sort of a substitute proposition,
but Mr. Bowley was in favor of rescinding the
motion of July 3. and Mr. Grout's motion pre-
Vhen came the proposal for the adoption of a
map calling for the widening of about one hun
dred miles of streets in The Bronx at an expense
of several millions of dollars to future taxpayers
in that borough.
Mr. Grout asked to have the matter put o\er
till after tile first of the year.
"You'll tiave too much to do if you have every
thing: put over that come? up for adoption, saiel
Mr. Holahan. "] , ,
It was put over, and a resolution authorizing
payment f«> r overtime work by sewer contrac
tors was put through without objection. The
secretary was reading a second resolution for
the benefit of other sewer contractors, when
Controller Coler recognized the fine hand of his
ancient antagonist. Sewer Commissioner James
Kane, of Brooklyn. The Controller objected to
the resolution, and this made Mr. Kane red with
anger.
. "You ought to be man enough and just
enough." said he. his eyes flashing, "to vote for
a thing when it is right, but you never was a
man in the last four years."
Th» Controller winked at his: friends. Mr.
Knne has not forgiven the Controller for bring
ing about his Indict -nt for alleged misdeeds? in
the conduct of sewer work two years ago. The
in<'tet.roent afterward was dismissed.
■ " Th-- proposal to form b park on th^-propertr
Itounded by Broad. Penrl and Water streets and
Coentles Slip was, not approved by the board.
Controller Cojpr said that the funds in the ,-ity
treasury was too low. Fraunces' Tavern, fa
mous a<< the headquarters of George Washing
ton, stands on that ground. This was a plan to
preserve the tavern.

BIG GIFT TO BRYX MAWR
JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER PROMISES
JI^O.L'OO TO THE COLLEGE IF
$-_'50.000 IS RAISED.
Bryn aawi College has received the promise
of a gift of $230,000 from Jchn D. Rockefeller
for a new dormitory on the campus and a cen
tral heating and electric light plant. The con
dition of the gift is that the trustees of the col
lege secure by commencement day. next June,
pledges for 5250.U00 needed for a library build-
Ing. Miss 11. Carey Thomas, president of the
college, received the offer in a letter from Mr.
Rockefeller yesterday.
The trustees and alumnse have been trying to
raise SC'2O,OOO to supply pressing wants created
by the rapid growth of the institution. This
amount is needed for a library building, esti
mated to cost gSMMIMt a new dormitory to ac
commodate eighty students (at present every
room in the five halls of residence is tilled and
students are being lodged off the campus in
cottages rented by the college) and to cust $I"^.
(HMl; a central heating and electric lighting
plant (the buildings are now lit by gas and the
students study by oil lamps) to cost $100,00 ft
and a students' building, estimated at |EBL6Sft
The students and alumnae have already raised
112,000.
The new liDrary building will contain semi
nary rooms and professors' consultation rooms.
At present, on account of the crowded condi
tion of the lecture rooms, stuelents in some of
the larger ciasses sit OB the window sills, and
the library room is totally inadequate to seat
the readers. The sheUes are full, and books
are being stored in the cellars and attics.
The authoriti-':- of the college yesterday
promptly took steps toward raising the required
$250,000. President Thomas has already re
ceived pledges amounting to $4<U<«>t>. It Is
hoped that a sufficiently large sum will be sub
scribed at an early date to malo- it possible
to break ground for the new bulldlrurs in the
spring.
"Mr. Rockefeller has no personal, connection
whatever with the college." said P-esident
Thomas, 'nor has he ever visited it, Ihuuah
twice his agents have l.een through the build
it-.g.s and over the grounds. The student b<>jy
of 41i will aid us to tho extent of ti . :r power,
as will our alumiue. which now Bombers close
vi on five hundred. The trustees will, of course,
do all that is possible, and have already named a
committee of five for that purpose. We want the
assistance of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia,
I,n. 1 when tney realize that every .".(> vt-nts they
dow subscribe means a dollar to the l< ading edu

EXTENSIVE OWNED BY ANY
EASTERN ROAD.
[HT TELEGRAPH TO THE TRIBINE.]
New-Haven, Conn., Dec. 4. — The New-Haven Rail
road is about to complete* a contract for the in
stallation of the most extensive electric plant owned
by any of the great Eastern railroads. It will be
s« t up in connection with the new car shops at
ReadvWe, Mass.. where most of the rriunufacturing
and repairing of the road in the future will be done.
The n.w electric plant will in many respects be
unique in railroading. It will have sufficient power
to light B v : i y . and will not only light all the .shops
al Readville, !>'.:t will operate the machinery aba
For Ughtlng purposes the plant will he able to
supply 10,000 sixteen candle power lamps, though
hardly more than -I.WV) thirty-two candle power will
be needed, and HO arc lights. Steam will be used
for generating only, two engines of 1.5 M an.! 3M
horsepower b-ing contracted for. The larger gen
erator, which will supply the power for the shop
machinery, will be a 1.500 kilowatt machine or
the B-phasf "."■ cycle alternating current type, re
duced to a secondary voltage of 5,">0. For the
lighter work 22<~i volt direct current motors will be
used.
Altogether the electric power will represent about
3 taxi horsepower as supplied by ste:im driven ma
chinery It will be used to operate eleTators, lathes,
planes and all the repair work, which will be con
centrated at Readville. The shops are now nearly
completed and will be finished by next spring.

FIGHT ON IX CONGRESS.
DEMOCRATS START A CAM*
PAIGX OF OBSTRUCTION.
STUBBORN OPPOSITION TO NEW CANAC
TREATY AND PHILIPPINE TAR
IFF BILL DEVELOPS.
[BY TELE'iRArH TO THE TBIBrVE.]
Washington. Dec. 4.— Thus early in the l/VTltti
Congress the minority programme of obstruction
has been very clearly defined. The House has
done nothing, but the opposition in the Senate
has had an opportunity to show what its pur
pose is. This opportunity has been afforded by
two measures of far reaching national impor
tance. One pertains to the construction of the
Nicaragua Canal, and the other to the necessity
of providing means for raising revenue for the
Philippines. Against both of these measures it
is known that the minority in the Senate intends
to offer the most stubborn opposition. This in
teresting fact was developed to-<iay.
Wh»n *he Senate went into executive session
to consider the new Hay-Paurcefote Treaty, it
was soon shown that thf transcontinental rail
road interests, acting secretly through the Dem
ocratic organization, intend to contest to tha
bitter end the ratification of the convention.
The excuse for doing this is to he based on the
fact that in the seoopri article of the treaty it is
stipulated that the United States is entitled to
police the interoceanic canal. Great stress is to
be put by the secret enemies of the canal on
the circumstance that the treaty de>es not pro
vide in exact and i disputable terms for th©
right of this nation to fortify the waterway.
The use of the word "police" instead of the
word "fortify" is going to be urged by the op
position as sufficient reason for holding out
against ratification of the treaty. It i 3 true, of
course, that the treaty to-day was considered
by th^ Senate in executive session, inr. this fact
does not detract from the trustworthiness of the
statements here made.
MAY CAUSE DELAY. BUT CANNOT WIN.
It is generally believed, however, that in spite
of the hostility of a comparatively small element
of the minority, the treaty will be ratified by the
Senate substantially as it has been submitted
by the State Department It is known that It
is favored by a safe ma'ori'y of the Senate, and
while the opposition, under the whip and spur
of the transr ontinertal railroads and the French.
Panama Car i laflwesvea, may be able to pro
long the debate, in the end the majority wi'.l
triumph.
The prospect for th^ early adoption of Senator
Lodge's joint resolution for the application of
the Dingley law to imports from the Philippines
is not so favorable a." is that of the ratification,
of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty. While it is un
deniable that the Lodge resolution will in the
end be adopted, it is nevertheless true that it
will be subjected to a long and weary debate.
The Democrats, under the leadership of the
somewhat discredited Senator Jones, of Arkan
sas, will take advantage of their privilege under
the Senate mlea to debate the question inter
miriably. Hence it is largely a matter of- physi
cal endurance as to when the question will be
brought to a direct and decisive vote\ Whether
Senator Lodge and hi? supporters will try to
bring on the final vote before Congress takes a
recess for the Christmas holidays cannot now
be foretold. But even if they should undertake*
this task, it is doubtful that they could be suc
cessful. It goes without saying, of course, that
the '.onger the tariff bars are left down between
the Philippines and the United States, the better
will it suit the interests which will profit by this
free trade condition. Therefore, it behooves all
Senators who are favorible to these inter- - to
extend the debate to the utmost limit of parlia
mentary and physical endurance.
JAMBS J. BILL MAY RETIRE.
REPORT THAT HE INTENDS TO PwESIG*
GREAT NORTHERN PRESIDENCY
AND LIVE HERE.
The statement was made yesterday that James J.
Hill would soon retire from the presidency of the
Great Northern Railway Company, which he has
..eld for many years, and that he would be suc
ceeded in office by his oldest son, J. N Hill, who a
few days ago was elected first vice-president of
the road. James J. Hill would , i-.>bably continue
to be a director of the Great Northern, it was add
td. but he desired to be relieved from the detail
work nei>js>ari!y devolving upon the executive
bead of such a company, especially in view of the
ract that he has just taken up the duties of pr--s:
dent of thaMwui". 1 "' Northern Se -urines compa:iy.
It was said that Mr. Hill's retirement from the
Great Northern presidency would probably be fol
lowed by his removal to this city as his home, al
though it was believed that he would continue to
maintain a legal residence in St. Paul. Ha is a
director of several local financial institutions, aa
well as of two or three big railway companies, ar.l
has of late found it necessary tc spend a large pare
of each year in this city. and, now that ho has be
come president of the Northern uritlea Com
pany it is said hi? presence in New-jfork would be
desirable during an even gre-ater period every year.
Mr Hill could not be seer, yesterday, but among
his friends the report of his intention to resign the
Great Northern presidency a.nd to take up nia resi
dence in New- City was genei ally credited.
