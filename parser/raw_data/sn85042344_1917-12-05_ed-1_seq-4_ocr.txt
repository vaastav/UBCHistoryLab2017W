From ihe officers of the Red Cross
i.nd from those In charge of the work
rooms In the old Christian church and
the surgical dressings room In the
librury, complaint continues to come
of the dlslntoredness on the part of
the women of tho city In the great
cause of war relief, f if fleer's of the
ol ganii'.at Ion and those who feel In a
wav responsible for Ihe showin:;
which Tulsa. Is making have been
heartily discouraged many times In
the past several weeks nnd not a few
conferences anil committee meetings
have been held for the purpose of
supplying a remedy. After mucfi con
Millalion It has been decided that
nothing short of a terrible calamity
to our own men either on land or sea
will aviiken them to a sense of their
l extensibility In the matter. The pica
made tint there was n dire, need of
surgical dressings in order that the re
serve supply which was sent to Italy
to supplement the supplies of some.
ei,rhtly hospitals seived by the enemy
might he replaced, seems to1 have had
no effect. Women of Tulsa, put
away your own selfish interests for at
least one day n week, and two or three
if possible, nnd devote It to the cause
of winning the war. If you refuse or
shirk, you are nothing short of a
slacker.
Anyhuddy that's too nice f ent corn
bread Is too nice for a democracy,
What's become o' th' ole lime easy-f-do
farmer?

STREET RAILWAY WILL
DOUBLE TRACK MAIN
Improvements Broad in Scope
Are Besrun at Intersection
of Main and Third.
The disrupted condition at the In-j
tersectlori of Main and Third means
more Improvement of the line of the
Tulsa Street Hallway company, and
better service, according to Manager
MctSrath, who is supervising the In
stallation of an $S,000 double-track
turnout at that point.
Working day and night, three shifts
of workmen nre tearing up the pave
ment nnd tracks at that point In order
that the new turnout can be Installed.
F.lectric lights have been strung all
along over the Job, and thruout the
night for several days the work will
continue In order to install the equip
ment, repave the street and thus In
terfere with automobile traffic as little
as possible. 1
This installing ofNhls piece of Im
provement Is but one of tho many
things which Mannger Mc(5rath In
tends to do at once, he declared yes
terday. As soon & the work at Main
nnd 'fhlrd is completed, the men will
be placed at work In tearing up the
pavement northwurd on Main to make
way for a double trackage system on
that line.
With these two pieces of improve
ment In, It will be possible to operate
thru service on all north and south
and east t'ul west lines, without the
ctistomai turn-back or trolley re
verses wh.ch have cause so much
congestion on the Main and Third
streets Intersection and which was one
of tho causes for the action on the
part of the city administration in call
ing for drastic measures to bring about
in Improvement ot the lines.
"TiilsaiiH are no better pleased to
see this bit of improvement going In
than are we," he declared yesterday.
"As we have stated to the mayor avnd
officials ut.the Chamber of Commerce,
this steel has bean ordered for months,
but onlv now have we been able to
get It. "We will put It down as quickly
as possible and then move on to an
other piece of Important work, that
of double tracking northward on
Main."

In- Century early yesterday morning,
with this exception, this episode oc
curred on dry land.
A lad named Wood, who lives with
his parents in Century, went to the lot
to feed his chickens and noticed some
thing was agitating them. I'pon ln
estigatlon the boy found a little foot

The house was besieged with women
anxious to see the little fellow.

In all the total registration In the
city of Tulsa was 6,fiS4, of which 3.16J
were married and 3,422 were single
or slightly more than SCO more single
men than those married. i ne urn
l.OOu men were divided among 880
married men called and K2C single
men called, of which 78 married men
were accepted while 169 single men
were accepted.
Ninety Fall to Appear.
fif th 1 00(1 men railed. 90 failed
to appear and 708 were accepted after
a thoro physical examination. The
physical examination among the 1.000
caused ttte rejection of 282 men while
10 additional were rejected at the
training camp as physically unfit for
military service. Two deserted the
service while en route to the training
There yet remain among me o.no-t
men registered, 2. 782 married men
who have not as yet been called for
examination and there also remain
2,802 single men In the same class.
In a chifsifloation of registrants fin
to citizenship, there were ,280 native
citizens, and of this number all but
five of the 1 000 men called were of
this class. Ther. yet remain 6,325
native citizens who are registered but
not called.
Older the divisions of nnturallzed
citizens, aliens and alien declarants,
more Interesting facts are disclosed,
one of the principal being that among
the 6,084 registrants in Tulsa there
were but eight Hermann registered,
four citizens of Turkey and four from
Austria-Hungary.
Of the 25 naturalized citizens regis
tered five were called and two were
accepted for service and three were
released. Thero yet remain 20 of th'S
rlas.i to be called.
Aliens Are Ilejeeleil.
The registration cards show that
lftR aliens were registered but not
called out of a total registration of
228. Thirty of this class were called,
only one being accepted and 29 being
rejected. This one .was an Austrian
who professed a desire to serve as a
soldier in the American army fighting
against his own people.
A total registration shows 61 alien
declarants (those having declared In
tentions of becoming citizens), and of
this number 10 were called, leaving 41
vet uncalled. Of the 10 called seven
were not accepted while three were
accepted.
In the classification of the regis
trants as to professions or trades, a
form containing the classification of
nil labors under thirty divVions was
followed and on this wide range of
work there were but three which dii)
not find a registrant In Tutsa. There
wero no men registered In this city
who gave as their profession or labor
that of forestry, soap factory workers
or brewery helpers.
1 he largest class was that of the
laborers In general, which, of the
6.5Hi registrants, 245 gave that as
Uielr work. The next largest class was
tha of domestic and manual labor,
In which there were placed 205 of
the registrants. llullding Industrie's
which Included carpenters, plasterers,
plumbers and the like, came next with
17.1 find trades and merchandising
was next In line with 95. Oil and gns
well workmen were Just below the

ABLE TO WORK

years and lives at SOS Oakland street
"In all my life," he continued. "I
have never seen anything- to equal
Tanlac. Why, one mouth ago, when
I began taking It I was hardly abb) to
creep around. Since then I have actu
ally gained fourteen pounds and aru

tarrhal coiiKh nnd suffered from Indi
gestion until I was practically a phys
ical wreck. I had terrifio headaches
tny very bones seemed to hurt asnt l
had gotten to whore It was an effort
for me to move, much lss So any

"It seems to me I tried almost every

done for me. I'm nlmost like a man

congress on ano'per occasion. If I
have overlooked anything that ought
to ne done for the more effective eon
duct of the war your own counsels
will supply tho odlsHion. What I am
perfectly clear ae-vut Is that in me
present session of efigreaw our whole
uttentlon and energy hould ho con
centrated on the vigorous ami rjpld
and successful prosecution of the fret
task of winning the war.
We can do thin with all the greatew
yea and enthusiasm because we know
that for us this In a war of hlgluirln-
clple, debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation; because we
know and all the world knows that we
have been forced Into It to save the
very institutions we live under from
citrriiptlon and destruction The pur
pores of the central powers strike
straight at the very heart of every
thing we believe In: their methods o'
wurfare outrage every principle of
humanity and of knightly honor; their
intrigue has corrupted tho very thot
and spirit of many of our people; their
sinister nnd secret diplomacy has
sought to take our very territory away
from us and disrupt the union of the
states. Our safety would bo at an
end, our honor forever sullied and
broug'ht Into contempt were we to per
mit their triumph. They are striking
at the very existence of democracy and
liberty. It Is because It Is for us
wnr of high, disinterested purpose, In
which all the free peoples of the world
are bonded together for the vindica
tion of right, a war for the preserva
tion of our nation and of all that It
has held denr of principle and of pur
pose, that we feel ourselves doubly

Smoke Tom Moore
Most of our troubles never happeawc
can afford to be light-hearted. Even " in
choosing a cigar that will smoke, pleas
antly not heavily the way is made easy.
To men who want the kind of a smoke
best suited to their own taste and physique,
a cigar like Torn Moore carries a particular
appeal. Its mild, balanced flavor suggests
judicious compromise pleasant smoking,
with no fear of "heavy" penalties.
That's why .Tom Moore deserves to be
called "a light-hearted Havana." .

constrained to propose for Its outcome
only that which Is righteous and of
Irreproachable intention, for our foes
as well as for our friends. The causae
being Just and holy, the settlement
must be of like motive and quality.
Kor this we can fight, but for nothing
less noble or less worthy of (fur traditions-
Kor this cause we entered the
war and for this cause will we battle
until the lost gun Is fired.
I have spoken plainly because this
seems to me the time when It Is most
necefwary to speak plainly. In order
that all the world may know that even
In the heat and ardor of the struggle
and when our whole thot Is carrying
the war thru to its end, we have not
forgotten any Ideal or principle for
which the name of America has been
held in honor among the nations and
for which It has been our glory to con
tend In the great genurntlons that
went before us. A supreme moment
of history has come. The eyes of the
people have been opened unci tney see.
The hand of (Sod Is laid upon the na
tions. He will show them favor, I
devoutly believe, only if they rise to
the clear heights of" his own Justice
and mercy.
