THE GREATEST OF
CIVILIZED STATES.
Hon. Joseph Chamberlain's Allusion
to the American Nation,
In Discussing Home and Foreign Affairs at
a Conservative Gathering in England.
Rejoices at the Growth of Friendly
Relations Between Great Brit
ain and the United States—The
Anglo-Saxon Race Allied, There
is no Other Coinhination That
Could Make Them Afraid.
LONDON, Dec. 8— Right Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, speaking at a Conservative
gathering in Wakefield, Yorkshire, this
evening, fully discussed home and for
eign affairs, and the Government's pol
icy in Egypt, which, he said, depended
entirely upon the possibility of reach
ing an understanding with France, "a
thing which is impossible as long as the
French pursue a policy of exaspera
tioh."
With regard to the relations between
Great Britain and Russia, in connec
tion with the Far East, he said that
while hitherto the endeavors to reach
an agreement had failed, he believed
an agreement with Russia was neces
sary, unless very serious complications
were to be encountered. There were,
he continued, no insurmountable ob
stacles to an agreement. On the con
trary, it was quite possible to conciliate
the reasonable ambition of Russia with
the fixed policy of Great Britain to
maintain equal opportunities of trade
for all nations.
"I am more sanguine of arriving at a
settlement." said Mr. Chamberlain, "be
cause it is not for our interest alone.
The objects we have in view are shared
also by the United States, Germany and
Japan, all of which have identical in
terests. I dare say you have observed
the very pregnant passage in the recent
message of President McKinley to the
United States Congress, the passage
referring to the very important inter
ests of America in the East, in which
he declares that these interests shall
not be prejudiced by exclusive treat
ment. That is a very noteworthy pass
age, and without being a prophet. I
think I shall not be too sanguine if I
say that in the future we shall not
stand alone as guardians of the 'open
door.' "
Mr. Chamberlain then referred to the
charges of inconsistency brought
against him in boasting Great Britain's
splendid isolation, and then touting for
alliances. He said: "When I referred
to isolation, I meant the isolation of
the British Empire, comprising the
United Kingdom and our children over
the seas, who are well able to defend
their possessions and their own exclu
sive interests against all attack, but
surf ly it is not unreasonable to seek an
alliance and to expect co-operation
where the interests involved are those
of others as well as of ourselves.
"In the case of Germany, we have
asm talr.ed by a friendly and frank in
terchange of opinion that there are
many interests regarding which we can
assist one another. I think I may hope
that in the future the two nations —the
greatest naval and the greatest mili
tary Power —will come more frequently
together, and our joint influence will
be used in behalf of peace and unre
stricted trade.
"But, if I congratulate you upon the
development of good feeling between us
and a great continental State, still more
do I rejoice at the growth of friendly
relations between ourselves and our
colonies, between ourselves and the
United States. Already the United
States, if regarded from the standpoint
of potential resources, is the greatest
of civilized States—with its immense
population of intelligent citizens, chief
ly Anglo-Saxons, and if we are assured
of the Anglo-Saxon race, whether it
abides under the Stars and Stripes, or
the Union Jack, there is no other com
bination that can make us afraid."
Replying later in the proceedings to
a vote of thank.s for his address, Mr.
Chamberlain said he hoped, ere many
years had pa«sed, to see a federation of
the empire with colonial representatives
in the Imperial Parliament.
Referring to a personal allusion to
"his setting a good example in forward
ing; the hoped-for alliance with the
United States by marrying an Ameri
can," he said: "So many Englishmen
are following the example that I think
it quite possible that the alliance may
be accomplished without the interfer
ence of governments." (Laughter.)
STORM IN THE EAST.
Ground Covered With Snow From
Montana to New Mexico.
DENVER. Dec. B.—From Montana to
New Mexico and from the first range
of Rocky Mountains far out on
plains of Kansas and Nebraska, -he
ground is covered with a thick mantle
of snow. The storm which began here
last night, ended this afternoon. Fortu
nately there was not much wind and
traffic on the railroads is only slightly
hampered.
The temperature has been steadily
falling here since noon to-day. At i!

the severe cold extends all over the
State and south into New Mexico.
BUFFALO (N. V.), Dec. B.—Continued
high winds are causing delay to railway
traffic to-day, the snow drifting as fast
as the railway companies can move it.
The New York Central train, due to
leave here at 11:40 last night, did not
leave until 4 o'clock this morning.
Trains from the West are from two to
four hours late. A number of trains
have been abandoned. No attempt is
made to move freight trains. Railroad
officials hope the warm sun of this
morning will prevent heavy snow
drifts. Three trolley lines in South
Buffalo, which were completely tied ip
yesterday afternoon, were operated to
day. Suburban trolleys were badly
handicapped. ,

MUTINY ON A BRITISH SHIP.
A Captain Puts to Sea With a Ma
jority of the Crew in Irons.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. B.—With a
majority of his crew in irons, having
mutinied, the British ship Jack Bur
rill, Captain Robertson, hence from
Santos with 3,000 tons of coal, passed
seaward to-day. Those who know Cap
tain Robertson have no fear but that
he will conquer the mutineers.
While outward bound the Burrill an
chored at Brandywine Shoals, and
while there began to leak, but only
slightly. All hands were set to work
to pump her out, and while thus en
gaged decided to protest against going
in the ship, on the ground that she
was unseaworthy. After a most thor
ough survey the ship was pronounced
seaworthy. This was told the crew,
but still they protested. Captain Rob
ertson faced the issue of the quarrel.
He sent to Philadelphia for a suffi
cient number of men to w r ork the ship
clear of the capes, and went out to
day.
The crew to a man were in mutiny,
and will be kept locked up until they
agree to turn to without further
trouble.
Train Robber Sentenced.
EL DORADO (Kas.), Dec. 8. — Sam
Smith and Tom Wind, who held up a
Frisco train and robbed the express
car in June last at Andover, and who
killed William Belford, one of a posse,
were sentenced to-day. Smith was
found guilty of murder in the first de
gree. He received a death sentence,
which in Kansas means life imprison
ment. Tom Wind, his partner, pleaded
guilty of murder in the second degree,
and received a twenty-year sentence.
Two Miners Frozen to Death.
OURAY (Col.), Dec. B.—George Hock

A FRIENDLY SUIT.
Action to Recover Money Deposited
in a Bank.
David Parker has sued the Farmers'
and Mechanics* Bank to recover $1,000
deposited in said bank by Jerry Par
ker a year ago. The latter assigned
his bank account to the plaintiff, but
the bank declined to pay over the
money without an order of court.
The suit is an amicable one, as will
be seen by the answer filed by Devlin
& Devlin, attorneys for the bank. They
say:
Now comes the above named defend
ant, and answers the complaint of
plaintiff, as follows:
Admits the allegations contained in
paragraph 1 thereof, and also in para
graph 4 thereof; but denies generally
and specifically all the other allega
tions and averments contained in the
said complaint, for the reason that it
has no information or belief upon the
subject sufficient to enable it to an
swer.
As to the matters set forth in para
graph 2 of the said complaint, it avers
that it has no information or belief
as to the same, and therefore denies
each and every allegation therein con
tained. Defendant admits that there
• has been exhibited to it an instrument
; which plaintiff claims is legally suffi
icient to assign and transfer the deposit
| mentioned in the complaint to the
j plaintiff, but this defendant is in
| formed by its counsel that there is a
doubt as to the legality and sufficiency
of said assignment; and hence plaintiff
and defendant have agreed to submit
the matter to this court in a friendly
action for determination.
Influential Women in the East.
Fashion is a twofold movement. In
its large evolution a. type dominates for
some generations or so. with modifica
tions so slow as to be unperceived, the
result of social conditions prevailing in
the civilized world, forming the drift
that is referred to above that is Rot
controlled; in its special action it is a
variation from season to season and
from day to day, a constant individual
creation on the same general theme.
This second movement is the one that
is popularly recognized. It is due to
woman's present social status, which
forces her to constant effort to set
herself off from other women or to
emulate other women, by her dress, as
men are forced to emulate other men,
cr to distinguish themselves from the
mass of men, by force or by intellect.
The end pursued by both is singular
ity that is to say, distinction from
others, and with women by distinction
by beauty.—Scribner's.

Alice F. Stevens, by her attorneys,
Hinkson & Elliott, has petitioned the
Superior Court for permission to sell
personal property of the estate of her
father, the late Samuel S. Nixon, in or

iriLE RECORD- UNION, SACRAMENTO, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1898.
MUCH TROUBLE ON
THE WATER FRONT.
Considerable Damagb to Shipping by
a Gale at San Francisco.
A Three-Masted Schooner Narrowly Escapes
Being Wrecked.
Another Body Taken From the
Ruins of the Baldwin Hotel-
Nothing Found to Indicate the
Identity of the Corpse, Which is
Believed to he That of a
Woman.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec, B.—A gale
which prevailed here this evening
caused much trouble along the water
front.
The three-masted schooner Maggie C.
Russ, which had just entered port from
Gray's Harbor, crashed into the west
ern end of the seawall, doing consider
able damage to herself and the dock.
She was hauled off by the tug J. C.
Redmond, her stern striking the rocks
as she swung into the stream. The
work of salvage was aided by the reve
nue cutter Rush, which turned her
searchlight on the vessel, which so nar
rowly escaped being wrecked.
The big lumber raft of the D. H. Bibb
Lumber Company, which was being un
loaded at the seawall immediately to
the eastward of the Powell-street
wharf, began to break up, but had not
gone to pieces when the wind abated.
BALDWIN HOTEL FIRE.
Another Body Found, Believed to
he That of a Woman.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. B.—Another
body was taken from the ruins of the
Baldwin Hotel to-day. Wreckers delv
ing- in the debris on the Market street
side turned up a charred mass of flesh,
which, at the Morgue, was pronounced
to be the remains of a human being.
There was absolutely nothing to indi
cate the identity of the corpse, which
is believed to be that of a woman.
Several letter were discovered near
the body, but they are not liable to
throw any light on the mystery, as they
are directed to Mrs. Benjamin Weth
erby, who, with her husband, escaped
from the building unharmed. The
Wetherbys are now on their way to
Portland, Or. He is a traveling sales
man for a Massachusetts shoe house.
BRANDES A BIGAMIST.
His First Wife Swears That She
Has Never Been Divorced.
OAKLAND, Dec. B.—W. A. Brandes,
accused of the murder of his fifteen
year-old daughter Lillian, by beating
her to death, and then alleging that she
had committed suicide, was to-day con
fronted in court by the mother of the
dead girl. Mrs. Mary Arellanes Brandes.
She swore that she was married to
Brandes in Santa Cruz in 1882, ami that
she had never been divorced. That
ended her testimony, for under the law
a wife may not testify against her
husband.
The relationship of this wife being
established, Brandes stands in court as
a bigamist, unless he can show that
there has been no marriage with Mrs.
Etta Brandes, who is codefendant on
the murder charge.
It is rumored that if the accused
woman is discharged at the preliminary
hearing she may turn State's evidence
against Brandes.
DEMURRER OVERRULED.
Archbishop Riordan Wins His Suit
Against Mrs. Belle Sprague.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.—United
States Judge Beatty of Idaho rendered
his decision in the case of Archbishop
Riordan against Mrs. Belle W. Sprague
in the Circuit Court to-day. The ques
tions presented arose on a demurrer
to the complaint, and were argued be
fore Judge Beatty while he sat in the
Circuit Court several months ago.
Mrs. Sprague is a daughter of Judge
William T. Wallace, and was formerly
Mrs. Belle W. Donahue. The Arch
bishop sued to recover certain bequests
to Catholic institutions made by Mr.
Donahue, amounting to over $20,000. A
demurrer was interposed on technica.l
grounds. It has been overruled by
Judge Beatty, and the Archbishop has
won his case.
Gallagher Given the Decision.
LOS ANGELES, Dec .B.—Billy Gal
lagher, formerly of Oakland, and Jim
Trimble of this city fought fifteen
rounds here to-night. Gallagher was
given the decision by Referee John
Brink. The contest took place before
the Los Angeles Athletic Club. Gal
lagher was the aggressor during most
of the match, but Trimble cleverly
ducked his blows and escaped punish
ment until the final round, when he
attempted to mix it up, and was worst
ed. The men had fought once before
to a draw.
Los Angeles Fire a Costly One.
LO<S -ANGELES. Dec. B.—The fire in
the works of the Standard Oil Company
burned itself out this evening, the en
tire property of the company being con
sumed. The company's agents have
been very reticent about estimating
their loss, but it is learned upon the
best of authority that property valued
at fully $225,<M>0 went up in smoke. It
is said that the price of oil will be ad
vanced to a figure which will recom
pense the company for the loss sus
tained.
Will Have to Serve His Sentence.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.—The Su
preme Court has affirmed the judgment
of the Superior Court of Fresno County,
which sentenced Charles Worthington
to life imprisonment for killing a man
named Motley. The two men had quar
reled, and Worthington, claiming that
he believed he was to be attacked, fired
two loads of a shotgun into Motley. The
defense urged for a reversal or for a
reduction of the degree of crime, but
the Supreme Court held that every step
in the case was regular.
A Raving Maniac.
OAKLAND, Dec. 8.— John Keefe, a
laboring man, who has been reEiding at
a lodging-house in San Francisco dur
ing the past two months, became a rav
ing maniac last night, and to-day cre
ated a lively disturbance in the Girard,

House in this city. He attempted to
kill Mrs. Hanna McAnus, his former
landlady, with a knife last night, and
after this gave the police a hard fight
before he was overpowered. He was
committed to the Stockton asylum.
State Board of Trade Protests.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. B.—The State
Board of Trade has sent a telegraphic
protest to the State Department, pro
testing against any commercial treaty
with Greece by which the duty on
Zante currants may be removed or re
duced. The dispatch is in line with
that forwarded by the California Rai
sin Growers' Association, who assert
that the proposed change would almost
ruin their industry.
The Lower Court Erred.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 8. — The
State Supreme Court has reversed the
judgment of the Superior Court of
Modoc County in the case of James
Cluff, convicted of poisoning one Miller,
his rival in a love affair, by means of
strychnine placed in sugar. The de
fendant appealed, and the Supreme
Court finds that an instruction of the
court was clear error, and that testi
mony for the prosecution, which great
ly jeopardized the defense, was im
properly permitted to gQ to the jury.
Charter Carries at Vallejo.
VALLEJO, Dec. B.—An election here
to-day on the adoption of a new free
holders' charter resulted in 058 votes
for the charter and 170 against it.
Only one-fourth of the vote was polled.
Vallejo has virtually been without a
charter, and has been working under
the general laws. The new charter is
not radical in its changes. After be
ing approved by the Legislature, it
will take effect in 1001.

them.
Rain at Riverside.
LOS ANGEUfts, Dec. B.—Rain com
menced falling in Riverside and vicin
ity to-night The precipitation was co
pious, and the indications are favorable
for a continuation of the downpour,
which is greatly needed. The weather
indications here to-night are for an
early storm.
THE POPE AND THE SMUGGLER.
An Incident of the Pontiff's
Younger Days.
It is reported that the Pope will soon
publish an important encyclical on sub
versive parties, addressed to the labor
ing and working classes, in which he
will recall them to respect for religion
and obedience to those placed over
them. Leo XIII. has remembered with
interest the mission given to him by
Pope Gregory XVI. when he was only
twenty-eight, and only a few weeks
after he had celebrated his first mass.
At that time the province of Benevento,
which belonged to the Papal States, but
was almost surrounded by the terri
tory of the kingdom of Naples, was in
a much worse degree than Switzerland
now is—a nest of smugglers, brigands
and revolutionists. To put an end to
this state of things the then Monsignor
Pecci was sent there as Papal Dele
gate; that is to say, with full powers.
He acted with extreme energy, once
sure of the troops at his disposal, at
tacking the leaders of the malefactors,
dispersing their bands and making
most of them prisoners. The latter,
heavily chained, were carried through
the streets, as an example to the peo
ple, and to reassure the respectable in
habitants. m
In this work Monsignor Pecci was
greatly assisted by a brave and intelli
gent officers, Signor Sterbini, who be
came his confidant, and when the ec
clesiastic was elected Pope he nomin
ated Sterbini as Scalo Segreto (secret
carver), a very important position at
the Papal court, for the holder of that
office is the only person present at the
meals of the Pontiff. Sterbini died in
1885, and his son has stepped into his
place.
Monsignor Pecci had to resort to
drastic measures to stamp out smug
gling, for it was practised and support
ed by the most prominent peopie of
the district; in fact, a certain Marquis,
was was suffering from the rigorous or
ders given by the delegate, was au
dacious enough to*go personally to
Monsignor Pecci to complain of what
he called the "want of respect" shown
'by the customs officers toward him.
The Pope's representative began by
I treating the Marquis with couitesy.
pointing out that the laws applied
equally to all, high and low; but this
reasoning, instead of convincing the
Marquis, made him so angry that he
declared he would go to Rome and not
rest until he had obtained the dole
gate's recall.
"Very well," answered Monsignor
Pecci, with that dignity and calmness
which characterized him, "take your
complaints to Rome, but do not forget
that to go to the Vatican you have to
pass by Castle St. Angelo!" (the famous
prison). That same evening Monsignor
Pecci had the castle of the Marquis
surrounded by the Pontifical troops and
every soul in it arrested. His suspic
ions that the place was the headquar
ters of a band of smugglers were fully
Confirmed. —Rome correspondence of the

REPRESENTATIVE ROBERTS.
UTAH'S NEW CONGRESSMAN
MAY BE UNSEATED.
Women of the Country Will Make
a Determined Fight Against
the Polygamist.
NEW YORK, Dec. B.—The "Herald"
to-morrow will say: Efforts to pre
vent Brigham H. Roberts. Repre
sentative-elect from Utah, from taking
his seat in the Fifty-sixth Congress be
cause he is a polygamist and advocates
that doctrine of the Mormon Church, is
to have the organized support of hun
dreds of thousands of women in the
United States. The initial woman's
movement is to take organized form in
this city at a meeting of the Presbyter
ian Woman's Board of Home Missions
on December 120 th.
There are a hundred thousand mem
bers of the Presbyterian Home Mis
sions Society alone in the United States.
The Home Mission Societies of the Con
gregational and Baptist Churches are
preparing to make a similar campaign
against Roberts, and the women's so
cieties of other denominations are be
coming interested in the fight. It is
intended that all shall co-operate.
The Congregational Home Missionary
Society will take the matter up at a
meeting to be held at the St. Denis Ho
tel in January.
This movement is not to be confined
to missionary societies, but is to be
started through them as a convenient
way of arousing interest over the entire
country. The women are to give infor
mation regarding the Roberts case, and
the supposed danger of the revival of
polygamy, and to unite in obtaining
personal letters to Representatives in
all districts throughout the country,
protesting against the seating of an
avowed polygamist.
Rev. Wm. S. Campbell, who has spent
twelve years in Utah among the Mor
mons, is in New York taking an active
part in the fight against polygamy. He,
with another speaker who has lived
among the Mormons, will probably ad
dress the coming meetings. Mr. Camp
bell will dwell especially on the revival
of polygamy in Utah. He says that
the Presbytery of Utah is in touch
with only seventy of the 310 postofflces
in Utah. Reports received from these
show 2,000 cases of polygamy, and that
1,000 polygamisit children have been
born since Utah was admitted to State
hood in 1895.
In the women's fight against Roberts
it is to be urged that if he is seated the
Mormon Church will grant dispensa
tions to many men to take more wives.
Missionaries who have been studying
the Utah situation say that many po
lygamists are now making arrange
ments to that end.
Mrs. Darwin It. James, President of
the Woman's Board of Home Missions,
will preside at the meeting on Decem
ber 20th in the Presbyterian building.
QUOITS.
A Game That Never Had a Boom-
Its Ancient Record.
There are some games which have
never had their boom, and quoits is
one of them. Still, as nothing hap
pens but the unexpected, it may be
that the time is nearly ripe for quoits
to be taken out of its undeserved ob
scurity, to be exalted to the status of
a national game, to have weekly pa
pers named after it, and to have col
umns in the sporting press devoted to
the doings of its champions. Stranger
things have happened. Who, for in
stance, would have said, when, at the
end of the 'GO's, a few energetic sports
men went wobbling about on bone
shaking bicycles, which it would have
been far easier to push than to ride,
that at the end of the century con
siderably more than a hundred thou
sand bicycles would be manufactured
annually in Great Britain alone, and
that the vast majority of the popula
tion would adopt this means of loco
motion? One cannot imagine that
quoits will ever attain such popularity
as the bicycle, but the unprejudiced
person can see no reason why it should
not become as favorite a pastime as
golf, which a very few years ago was
almost unheard of south of the Tweed.
Quoits is a very fine game, especially
in the winter time. It is splendid ex
ercise, and trains the eye and the hand
to act together iri a way that few oth
er sports can do, for the very essence
of it is accuracy of aim at a mark
placed below the level of the hand.
It has been objected that throwing
quoits makes the player lopsided, but
after all that is easily remedied, for
there is nothing to prevent the player
throwing the quoit with his left hand
If he so pleases, and such a, change
would make a variation in the game
and also afford an excellent method of
handicapping the men of unequal
skill. Quoits strengthens the arms
and shoulders, but it is not a pastini?
which primarily demands strength. A
great advantage of the game is that
it can be played in any small space,
and that the ground need not be par
ticularly level. Any rough field or
waste bit of ground is good enough
for a quoits pitch, and no rolling or
cutting is required to satisfy the de
mands of the most exigent. For cricket
you need a carefully prepared wicket,
for lawn tennis and croquet a piece of
turf like a billiard-table, and for golf
the best part of a country all to your
self, but for quoits you only need a few
yards of rough ground, and you have
as good a place for throwing as any
one can possibly require.
People certainly might play quoits
more than they do, but the taking up
of a game is usually a matter of fancy,
and perhaps two things stand in the
way of quoits. First, there is an idea
that it is a "rustic" sport, and can
only be played by the rough country
lads; and, second, there is the legend
that the game is derived from the
classical discus throwing, a suspicion
which it must be confessed is enough
to throw a slur on any well-regulated
game. No treatise on quoits can be
gin without the time-honored pedigree
of the quoit from the discus. Strutt,
who lived at the end of the last cen
tury, of course, dealt with it, and,
equally of course, he dragged in the
discus even if he did not invent the
descent of quoits from the sports of
ancient Greece. The thing, of course,
is absurd. To make a discus, the arti
san did not, in the words of the im
: ' miMiilfr

mortal Irishman, take a hole and put
some iron around it. The discus was
more like a flattened Dutch cheese,
and was a solid missile. Moreover, it
was not held in the same manner- as a
quoit, but was bowled- underhand, in
which, indeed, it alone differs from
putting the weight. That quoits is now
played chiefly in the country is the
fault of those who do not play it and
bring it into fashion.
It is ho doubt a very ancient Eng
lish game, and its beginnings are lost
in the mist of ages. Hakluyt men
tions it in his book of "Voyages," so
it was well known in Queen Eliza
beth's time, , when it probably was one
of the favorite sports of Merrie Eng
land. In some parts of the< country
the rustics used to employ horseshoes
for want of properly made quoits, and
there are districts in which the quoit
is called a "shoe" even to this day.
This gives us the clew to the most
probable origin of the sport, and hints
that the first game of quoits was
started by throwing old horseshoes at
the hob or mark, and from this grad
ually grew up the practice of having
quoits specially made for throwing. So
much for the discus legend. As for
the word "quoit" itself, its etymology
is more than doubtful, and it gives us
no clew whatever to the origin of the
game.
Shakespeare, who mentions every
thing except tobacco, of course has a
reference to the sport, and, as Hakluyt
was a contemporary of his. it may be
held to show that the spacious times
of Great Elizabeth were the pal my
period of quoits. It is true that he
does not speak of the sport in very
reputable connection, for the only men
tion of it occurs in the scene in which
Prince Henry, Falstaff, Poms and the
rest were in the Boar's Head Tavern,
in Eastchepe. Falstaff, in giving a
character sketch of the young Prince,
observes that he plays quoits well, but
the context very clearly shows that in
Queen Elizabeth's time, at any rate,
quoit playing was looked down upon
as the idle man's recreation, n>uch as
skittles is with us. That fat Jack
Falstaff, disreputable old fellow as he
was, meant to imply no good of the
Prince by his reference to the game
is very evident. This is the only refer
ence to quoits in Shakespeare, and it
is a libel, though the sting is taken
out of it by the fact that it is put into
the mouth of Falstaff.—Physical Cult

The Ingenuity of Woman.
There was no light in the house.
Outside the rays of the electric lamp
struck the wall and cast long, weird
shadows of the trees. Up stairs in the
front room a woman lay asleep. An
alarm clock stood on the mantel at the
foot of the bed.
A clock somewhere down the street
had just struck 2.
A man turned the corner and tot
tered toward the steps leading to the
front door of the house. He mounted
them. He made three .or four frantic
jabs with his latch key at the lock.
Finally he succeeded in opening the
door.
Up stairs the woman slept on.
The man sat down on the lower step
of the flight for a few moments. He
looked up once; then began the ascent,
clutching the bannister to steady
himself. He had taken four steps. A
yell as of the keenest pain, cut the
night. The woman started and sat up
in bed. She glanced toward the clock,
hardly distinguishable in the dimly
lighted room, and saw that it was a
quarter past 2. Then a smile of hard,
satanic delight curved her mouth. An
other yell from the stairway and an
other and another. The woman sank
back on her pillow and closed her

sound asleep the woman arose quietly,
and lighting the hall jet, crept down
the stairs on her hands and knees,
picking up, as she went, the carpet

before she had gone to bed.
And when she re-entered her room
she muttered to herself. "Now I'll ju;;t

Grasses.
Are these the fairy hosts,
The million marching men.
Who after fogs aJid frosts.
Sprang up In glade and glen?
Their spears were silver-gray,
Their javelins gold and green.
That like a fountain's spray
Shattered the lignt between.
Their banner the wild rose,
Or bright
Terrible to their foes
When they went out to fight.
Now sweet, so swe?t in death.
They tie. like autumn leaves,
With all their golden breath
Gathered in golden sheaves.
Now sweet, so sweet, they lie
With all their comely length;
Piled high in heaps, so high.
And withered all their strength.
Alack! that goodly show
Of spears and glaives and swords.
That May-time long ago.
When these were belted lords.
