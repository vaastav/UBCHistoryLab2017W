Death ot Conrad Braiidbageu.
At 5 20 Wednesday afternoon Con
rad Lawrence Brandliagen, passed
away after suffering less than a year
from consumption. A year ago he
was a powerful young man and weigh
ed about 180 pounds. Early last spring
he showed symptoms of the dread
disease and during the early summer
weeks his case becamc alarming.
Finally lie and his father went to
Texas, his father hoping for some
benefit to his son from a change of
climate but the dry bracing atmos
phere of northwestern Texas gave no
relief and Conrad came home accom
panied by his Uncle. Human aid was
powerless and the young man gradual
ly grew weaker and the end came
Wednesday evening. He was 21 years
of age Sept. 1. A simple service will
be held at the family home in the
city next Saturday morning at J0 30
by Rev. Solem after which the body
will be conveyed to West Prairie
church in Grant Township where the
(inal service will be held at 2:30 and
the body of this splendid young man
will be laid beside his two brothers
and a sister.
Mr. and Mrs. Brandliagen have the
deep sympathy of their frieds all over
the county in their great sorrow.
President Roosevelt's message to
Congress is a long document but it is
an interesting one. He stands firm
for rate legislation and other reform
measures which calls for a square deal
between the people and the corpora
tions and the manufacturers. He is
not radical—he is fair.

Death ot Andrew P. Dannnen.
Andrew Peterson Damraen died at
his home in the city Monday morn
ing at 5:20 aged 56. He had recently
returned from Sioux Falls where lie
went for treatment for cancer of the
stomach, but he found no relief, and
there was none. He came home to
die, and was accompanied by a train
ed nurse. The funeral took place
Wednesday at 1:30 from the Lutheran
church and the service was conducted
by Rev. P. H. Tetlie. Interment was

Concrete Cement Steel Dam
A contract was signed Wednesday
evening in Henry Cooper's office for
the construction of a concrete cement
steel dam across the Sioux river be
tween Beloit and Lo^er Canton,
which will furnish electric power to
the Beloit mill, the Canton mill, the
city water works pumping station
and electric light company, besides
furnishing-electric power for other
business projects. It is a much need
ed improvement and the gentlemen
from St. Paul and Minneapolis are
quite enthusiastic over their eon
tract and the financial results to fol

ner of St. Paul and A. L. Bogart of
Minneapolis are the gentlemen who
will build this modern dam and man­

Breeding With A
Purpose.
JS
The first thing for the farmer to
determine is what kind of live stock
he will make the main feature on his
farm—horses, cattle, sheep, or hogs—
and the place that lie will give to sub
ordinate features. To illustrate: If
a farmer intends to make milk pro
duction the main feature of his farm,
he should develop a breed of cows
that will give a paying quantity of
milk. If he is on a small farm, has
to buy considerable of his feed, wants
to make fancy buttermaking his
specialty, has a market for it, and
cares little or nothing about beef pro
duction then he should by all means
use the special purpose dairy breeds.
If he lias broad, flat, rich lands like
they have in Holland, capable of
growing big grass, there is nothing
better for him than the Holstein. If
his land is more rolling, produces less
grass but of finer quality, as rolling
lands do, then there is nothing bet
ter for him than the Jersey. If he
has rolling lands that will produce
large quantity of rich grass and his

Definite
The greatest trouble with the
breeding carried on on the farms is
that it lacks definite purpose, and
lacking this one thing lacks every
thing. Breeding animals is not a
matter of guess work, not an accident
and can be successful only by the use
of brains.

If you are following mixed farming
and are dairying only incidentally,
having as the main end in view the
production of beef, then you don't
want these special purpose breeds at
all neither do you want a beef breed.
You want a breed that will give you
a paying quantity of milk, and good
beef steera or heifers. You need a
dual purpose breed. You can have
Shorthorns of a pronounced milking
quality. Don't say you can't get
them. Don't say there is no such
breed. You can get them if you
will go to some pains to find them.
Having selected this dual purpose
type of Sliort-horn cow. or Polled
Durham, or Red Poll, don't spoil it
all by buying a bull of some pronounc
ed beef type. Here is where farmers
fall down. A heifer of good dairy
type may not make a profitable milk
cow, but the chances are she will: the
lieifer of pronounced beef type may
make a profitable milk cow, but the
chances are she will not.
The great trouble with the dual
purpose farmer is that when he buys
a bull he wants a bull of pronounced
beef type, because it looks good, has
the broad back, the square form, that
delights the beef grower. He must
not expect heifers from that bull to
be good milkers. They may be, if
they take after the dam but the
farmer does not know whether they
will be good or not until he under
takes to milk them. Therefore if
you are buying a bull of the dual pur
pose breeds, stick to your milking
type. We hope the time will soon
come when breeders who milk their
cows will weigh the milk, test it, keep
records, and thus be able to point out
to farmers the type of bull that they
should purchase.
So in every other line of breeding
stock. First determine the kind of
stock you are going to raise, then de
termine the special object for which
you are going to grow them then
select the type of animal that, will
accomplish that purpose, and stick to
that. Don't ever allow yourself to be
diverted from that definite purpose.
If you follow this line, you will suc
ceed. If you don't do it, you will
fail, and will deserve to fail. Noth
ing is ever accomplished in the way
of farming or' anything else without
having a definite purpose in view and
keeping everlasting at it.— Wallaces'

climate is severe, as in the morte
northern sections of the country, then
the Ayrshire is probably the best
cow, provided he can secure sires
readily.
Whatever breed he selects he should
stick to the one breed. Don't cross
Ayrshire with Jersey, nor either of
them with Holstein. Select the breed
for its adaptation to your purpose,
and then stick to it. In selecting
sires select only pure bred sires.
Don't be tempted to buy a grade be
cause it is a good looker,- or because it
has all the marks of the breed. You
can't depend upon grade breeding.
Occasionally you will find one that
breeds" up, but you don't know it
until you try it, and you can't afford
to take the risk. Buy only animals
that you know are pure bred. Then
buy sires that inherit milking qual
ities, whose dams are heavy milkers.
You can't be too careful along this
line.

We will say that we, or last week's

but perhaps someone found them

summer, and we are glad to say that
she informed us that her son Paul

corn all fall, and also that he did not

we were previously informed, but
that the sight of both his eyes are
perfect, and indeed we are glad to
so inform our readers.

day night. The orchestra consisting
of twentvtwo members with. Prof.
Indseth in possession of the baton,
rendered as a curtain raiser, John
Phillips Sousa's "The Stars and
Stripes Forever," Each number
was loudly encored, and so on until
the last number on the program, and
so keen was the interest and great
the satisfaction to all, that we think
but very few noticed when accidently

than pleased the audience, beginning

think that even the members of
the Wendt Orchestra will not for
get her—in English: "Yes Billie Do."
Just before the last number of the

well chosen words in behalf of the
orchestra, after which the last num
