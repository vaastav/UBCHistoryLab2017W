THE PUBLIC FIN VIcEs.
The attention of congres Is called to the
annual report of the Scietary of the Treasury
on the con(litionm of the publc finances, The or
dinary resennes from iall sources for the fiscal
year enled Jure 3'. 1579, were $273,827,194.46.
The ordinary expendItur.s fot the same period
were $266.947.0I3.53. leavIng a surplus revenue
for the year of $6.79,300.93. The receipts for
the present 1isal year, ending June 30, 88so, ac
tual and estimated, are as follows: Actual re
ceipts for the first quarter, commencing July 1,
1879, $79,643,663.61; estimated receipts for the
remaining three-quarters of the year, $208,l5i,
336.39. Total receipts for the current fiscal
year. actual and estimated. $9,W0,000. The ex
penditures for the same period will be, actual
and estimatad. as follows: For the quarter com
mencing July 1. 179, actual expenditures,
$9l,6S3.3S5.l0; and for the remaining three-quar
ters of the year the expenditures are estimated
at $171.316.614.90. making the total expenditures
$1E4.toEn, and leaving an estimated surplus
revenue for the year ending June 30, 1880, of
$24.000.000.
The total receipts during the next fiscal year,
ending .lune a). 18Is, estimated according to ex
1sting laws, will be $28s.000,00). and the esti
mated Ordinary expenditures for the same period
will be $27s.e97.364.39, leaving a surplus of
39 902,41M.61 for that year. The large amount
expended for arrears of pensions during the last
and the present fiseal year, amounting to
21.747,249.60, has prevented the application of
the full amount required by law to the sinking
fund for the current year. but these arrears hav
Ing been substantially paid, It is believed that
the sinking fund can hereafter be maintained
without any change of existing law.
THE ARMY AND NAVY.
The Secretary of War reports that the War
department estimates for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 111, are $10,380,42S.93, the same being
for a less sum of money than any annual esti
mate rendered to Congress from that depart
ment during a period of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the general of the army in
recommending such legislation as will author.
ize the enlistment of due full number of 25,000
men for the line of the army. exclusive of the
3,460 men required for detached duty, and there
fore not available for service in the field. He
also recommends that Congress be asked to pro
vide by law for the disposit ion of a large num
ber of abandoned military posts and reserva
tions, which, though very valuable in them
selves, have been rendered useless for military
purPoses by the advance of civilization and
settlement, lie unites with the Quartermas
ter General in recommending that an appro
prIation be made for the construction of a cheap
and perfectly tire-proof building for the safe
storage of a vast amount of money, ac
counts, vouchers, claims and other valuable
records, now in the Quartermaster General's
office, and exposed to great risk of total de
ftruction by tire. He also recommends,
in conformity with the views of the
Judge Advocate General, some declaratory
legislation in reference to'the military Statute
of Limitations, as applied to the crime of deser
tion. In these several recommendations I con
cur. The Secretary of War furt tier reports that
the work for the improvement of the South
Pass of the Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Eads, made In pursuance of
an act of Congress, has been prosecuted during
the past year, with a greater measure of success
in the attainment of results than during any
previous year. The channel through the South
Pass which, at the beginning of June, 1875, had
a depth of only 74 feet of water, had, on the
- th of July, 179. a minimum depth of 26 feet,
having a width of not less than 200 feet and a
central depth of zo feet. Payments have been
made in accordance with the statute as the work
progressed, amounting in the aggreate to
$4,250,000, and further payments will ecome
due, as provided by the statute, in the event
of success in maintaining the channel now
secured. The reports of the General of the
Army and of his subordinates present a full
- - and detailed account of the military opera
tIons for the repression of hostilities among
the Indians of the Ute and Apache tribes,
and praise is justly awarded to the tiDlleers
and troops engaged, for promptness. skill
and courage displayed. The past year has
been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet
on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to
believe that the efforts of this government and
of Mexico to maintain order In that region will
prove permanently successful. This depart
ment was enabled, during the past year, to find
temporary though crowded accommodations
and a safe deposItory for a portion of its rcords
in the completed east wing of the building de
signed for the State, War and Navy depart
ments. The construction of the north wing of
the building a part of the structure intended
for the use of the War department, is being car
ried forward with all possible dispatch, and the
work should receive from Congress such liberal
appropriations as will secure Its speedy com
pletion.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows continued Improvement in that branch
of the service during the last fiscal
year. Extensive repairs have been
made upon vessels, and two new ships
have been completed and made ready for sea.
The total expenditure of the year ended June
30. 1579, including specific appropriations not
estimated for by the department, were $13,555,
710.09. The expenses chargeable to the year.
after deducting the amount of these specific ap
opriations, were $13,343,317.79. but tihis is sub
et to a reduction of $283,725.9), that amount
aving been drawn upon warrants, but not paid
out during the year. The amount of appropria
tions applicable to the last fiscal year was
$14,538,646.17. There was, therefore, a balance
of $1,419 054.37 remaining unexpended and to the
credit oi the department on June 30, 1879. The
estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1881, are $14,864,147.95, which exceeds the ap
propriations for the present fiscal year $361,897.
28. The reason for this increase is explained in
the Secretary's report. The appropriations avail
able for the present fiscal year are $14,302,250.67,
'which will, in the opinion of the Secretary,answer
all the ordinary demands of the service. The
amount drawn from t he Treasury from July 1
to Nov. 1, 1879, was $.770,404.12, of which
51,095,440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period 54,6374,96379. If the
expenditures of the remaining two-thirds of the
year do not exceed the proportion for these four
months, there will remain unexpended at the
end of the year 147,39.30 of the current appro
priations. The report of the Secretary shows
the gratifying fact that amuong all the disbursing
officers of tihe pay corps ot the navy there Is not
one who is a defaulter to t he extent of a single
dollar. I unite with him In recommendIng the
removal of thetObservat ory to a more healthful
location. That institution retlects credit upon
the nation, and has obtained the approbation of
scientifie men in all parts of the world. Its re
moval from Its present locality would not only
be conducive to the health of its officers and
professors, but would greatly Increase its usie
DEPARTME~NT OF JrSTICE.
The appropriation for judicial expenses. which
has herotofore been made for the Department of
Justice in gross, was subdivided at the last ses
slon of Congress, and no appropriation wvhatever
was made for the payment of the fees of mar
Shials and their deputies, eit her inathe service of
process or for the discharge of other duties, and
sInce June 30 t hese oflicers have continued the
performance of their duties without compensa
tion from the government, taking upon them
selves the necessary Incidental ontlays as well
as rendtering their own services. in only a few
unavoidable instances has the proper execution
of the process of the United States failed by rea
son of the absence of the requisite appropria
tion. This course of official conduct on the part
of these officers, highly creditable to their fideli
ty, was advised by the Attorney General, who
Informed thenm, however, that they would ne
cessarily have to rely for their compensation
upon the prospects of future legislation by Con
grs.I therefore especially recommend that
imeite appropriation be made by Con
gress for this purpose. The act making the
cplappropriation for the Department of
usie pvious sessions has uniformly con
h aied hefollowinag clause: " And for defraying
the expenses which nlay be incurred in the en
foreement of the act approved Feb. 28, 1870, en
titled An act to amend an act approved May 30,
1810, entItled An act to enforce the right of citi
soens of the United States to vote in the several
atate of the United States, and for other pur
poses, or any acts amendlatory thereof, or sup
plementary thereto." No appropriation was
moade for this purpose for the current year. As
no general election of members of Congress oc
curred, the omission was a matter of little prac
tical Importance. Such election will, however.
take place during the ensuing year, and the ap.
r propration made for the pay of marshals and
* epties should be sufficient to embrace compen
Suafor the services they may be required to
perf orm at such election.

The report of the Postmaster General bears
testimony to the general revival of business
throughout the country. The receipts of the
Post Offmee department for the year ending June
ao, 1sZ9, were $30,041,982.S6, being $764,465.91
more than the revenues of the preceeding year.
The amount realized from the sale of
stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal
was $t64.465.91 more than In the preceding year,
and $2,387,559.23 more than In 187T. The expen
ditbres of the department were $33,449,899 45 of
which the sum of $376,461.63 was paid on liabAi
ties incurred In the preceding year. The expen
ditures during the year were$801,209.77 less than
in the preceding year. This reduction is to be at
tributed mainly to the operation of the law pass
ed June li7, 18!8, changing the compensation
of postmasters from a commission on the
value of stamps sold, to a commission on stamps
canceled. The amount drawn from the Treas
ury on appropriations, In addition to the
revenues of the department, was $3,031,454.94,
being $2,276,197.86 less than in the preceding
year. The expenditures for ths fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1881, are estimated at $39,920,900,
and the receipts from all sources at $32,210,000
leaving a deficiency to be appropriated for out
of the Treasury of $7,710,900. The relations of
the department with railroad companies have
been harmonized, notwithstanding the general
reduction by Congress of their compensation, by
the appropriation for special facilities. The
railway Post Office lines have been greatly ex
tended, especially in the Southern States. The
interests of the Railway Mail Service and of the
public wonid be getly promoted and the ex
penditures could be more readily controlled, by
the classification of the employes of the railway
mail service as recommended by the Post
master General, the appropriation for salaries,
with respect to which the maximum limit is
already fixed by'law, to be made in gross. The
Postmaster General recommends an amendment
of the law regulating the increase of co-n
pensation for increased service and in
creased speed in star routes, so as to
enable him to advertise for proposals for
such increased service and speed. He also sug
gests the advantages to accrue to the commerce
of the country from the enactment of a general
law, authorizing contracts with American built
steamers. carry g the American flag, for trans
portirg the malls between ports of the United
States and ports of the West Indies and South
America, at a fixed maximum price per mile;
the amount to be expended being regulated
by annual appropriations, in like manner with
the amount to be paid for the domestic star ser
vice. The arrangement made by the Postmaster
general and the Secretary of the Treasury for
he collection of duty upon books received in
the mail from foreign countries has proved so
satisfactory In Its practical operation that the
recommendation is now made that Congress
shall extend the provisions of the act of March
3, 1879, under which this arrangement was
made, so as to apply to all other dutiable arti
cles received in the mails from foreign coun
tries,
THE TNDIAN WARDS.
The reports of the Secretary of the Interior
and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, set
ting forth the present state of our relations
with the Indian tribes on our territory, the
measures taken to advance their civilization
and prosperity, and the progress already
achieved by them, will be found of more than
ordinary interest. The general conduct of our
Indian population has been so satisfactory that
the occurrence of two disturbances, which re
sulted in bloodshed and destruction o property,
is all the more to be lamented. The history of
the outbreak on the White River Ute reservat ion
In Western Colorado has become so familiar by
elaborate reports in the public press that its
rcmarkable incidents need not be stated here in
detail. It Is expected that the settlement of this
difficulty will lead to such arrangements as will
prevent further hostile contact between the In
dians and the border settlements In Western
Colorado. The other disturbance occurred at
the Mescalero agency, In New Mexico, where
Victoria, the head of a small band of marauders,
after conmitlting many atrocities, being vigor
ously chased by a military force, made his way
across the Mexican border, and is now on for
ei soll.
while these occurrences, in which a compara
tively small number of Indians were engaged,
are most deplorable, a vast majority of our In
dian population have fully justified the expecta
tiofs of those who believed that, by humane
and peaceful Influences, the Indian can be led to
abandon the habits of savage life and to develop
a capacity for useful and civilized occupations.
What they have already accomplished in Ihe
pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work,
the remarkable success which has attended the
experiment of employing as freighters a class of
Indians hitherto counted among the wildest
and most Intractable, and the general and
urgent desire expressed by them for the educa
tion of their children, may be taken as suificient
proof that they will be found capable of accom
plishing much more If they continue
to be wisely and fairly guided. The Indian
policy sketched in the report of the Secre
tary of the Interior-the object of which
is to make liberal provision for the ed
ucation of Indian youth, to settle the Indians
upon farm lots in severalty. to give them title in
fee to their farms Inalienable for a certain num
ber of years, and when their wants are thus
provided for, to dispose by sale of the lands on
their reservations not occupied and used by
them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds
for the benefit of the Indians, which will gradu
ally relieve the government of the expenses now
provided for by annual appropriations-must
commend itself as just and beneficial to the In
dians, and as also calculated to remove thosc
obstructions which the existence of large reser
vations presents to the settlement and develop
ment of the country. I therefore earnstly re
commend the enactment of a law enabling the
government to give Indians a title in fee ina
lenable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands
assigned to them by allotment. I also repeat the
ecuconmendation made in my first annual mes
sage that a law be passed admitting Indians who
give satisfactory proof of having by their own
labor supported their families for a num
ber of years, who are willing to detach
themselves from their tribal relations, to
the benefit of the homestead act,
and to grant them patents containing the same
provision of inalienability for a certain period.
The experiment of sending a number of Indian
chlldren of both sexes to the Hampton Normal
and Agricultural Institute in Virginia to receive
an elementary English education and practical
instruction in farming and other useful indus
tries has led to results so promising that it was
thought expedient to turn over the cavalry bar
racks at Carlisle,1in Pennsylvania, to the In
tealor department for the establishment of an
Indian school on a larger scale. This school has
now 158 pupils, selected from various tribes, and
Is in full operation. A rrangements are also made
for the education of a number of Indian boys
and girls. belonging to the tribes on the PacIfic
Ilope, in a similar manner, at Forest Grove, In
Dregon. These Institutions will commend them
,elves to the liberality of Congress and to the
philanthropic munificence or the American
people.
l ast spring Information was received of the
urganlzation of an extensive movement in the
reet n sl ates, the object of which w-as the oc
:upat ion, by unauthorized persons, of certain
lands In the Indian Territory, ceded by the
Cherokees to the government for the purpose
>f settlement by other Indian tribes. On the
.'9th or April I issued a proclamation warning
ill persons against participation In such an at
enmpt, and by the co-operation of a military
force, the invasion was promptly checked. .lt
s my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian
aha bitants of that territory to the full extent
f the executive power; but It would be unwise
o Ignore tile fact that a territory so large and
~o fertile, with a population so sparse and so
treat a u talth of unused resources, will be
ound more exposed to the repetition of such at
emupts as happened this year when the sur
rounding states are more densely settled and
.he westward movement of our popnlation looks
4till more eagerly for fresh lands to occupy.
LUnder such circumstances the difliculty of
mtaintaining the Indian Territory in Its p resent
state will greatly increase, and the Indian
tribes Inhaliting it would do well to prepare for
such a contingency. I therefore fully approve
af the advice given to them by the Secretary of
he Interior on a recent occasion, to divide
among themselves in severalty as large a
ciuantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to
acquire indvidual titles In fee, Instead of their
present tribal ownership in common, and con
sider in what manner the balance of their lands
may be disrosed of by the government for their
benefit. By adopting such a policy they would
more certainly secure for themselves the
value of their possessions, and at the same time
promote their progress in civilization and pros
perity, than by endeavoring to perpetuate the
present state of things in the territory. The
ciuestion whether a change In the control
af the Indian service should De made was, lnathe
Irorty-fifth Congress. referred to a joint com
mittee of both houses for inquiry and report.
In my last annual message I expressed the hope
that the decision of that question then in pros
et"would arrest further agitation of this
ujcsuch agitation being apt to produce a
dlisturigeffect upon the service, as well as
the Indians themselves." Since then, the com
mittee having reported, the question has been
liecided in the negative by a vote In the House
of Representatives for the reasons here stated,
and in view of the fact that further uncertainty
an this point will be calculated to obstruct other
much-needed legislation, to weaken the disci
pline of the service, and to unsettle salutary
measures now in progress for the government
and improvement of the Indians, I respectfully
recommend that the decision arrIved at by Con
gress at its last session be permitted to stand.

though such cases still occur, has
gkeatly reduced in extent, and it Is probable
that If the present policy Is vpgroily ur
sued, and suflicient provision to that end is
made by Congress. such trespasses, at least
those on a large sae can be entirely sup
pressed, except in the territories where timber
f the daily requirements of the populations
cannot, under the present state of the law, be
otherwise obtained. I therefore earnestly Invite
the attention of Congress to the recommenda
tion made by the Secretary of the Interior, that
a law be enacted enabling the government to
sell timber from the public lands, without con
veying the fee, where such lands are principally
valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to be
so regulated 8 0 Conform to domestic wants
and businem requirements. while at the same
time guarding a sweeping destruction
of the forsts. e enactment of such a law ap
pears to become a more pressing necessity every
day.
My recommendations In former messages are
renewed In favor of enlarging the facilities of the
Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the
leading interest and the permanent industry of
our people. It Is to the abundance of agricul
tural production, as compared with our home
consumption, and the largely Increased and
highly profitable market abroad which we have
enjoy ed In recent years, that we are mainly In
debted for our present prosperity as a people.
We must look for Its continued maintenance to
the same substantial resource. There Is no
branch of Industry in which la bor, directed by
scciititic knowledge, yields such Increased pro
duction In comparison with unskilled labor, and
no branch of the public service to which the en
couragement of liberal appropriations can be
more appropriately extended. The omission to
render such aid Is not a wise economy, but, on
the contrary, undoubtedly results in losses of
Immense sums annually that might be saved
through well-directed efforts by the gov
ernment to promote this vital Interest. The
results already accomplished with the very
limited means heretofore placed at the command
of the Department of Agriculture Is an earnest
of what may be expected, with Increased appro
priations for the seral purposes indicated in
the report of the commissioner, with a view to
placing the department upon a footing which
will enable It to prosecute more effectively the
objects for which It Is established. Appropria
tions are needed for a more complete laboratory,
for the establishment of a veterinary division
and a division of forestry, and for an Increase of
force. The requirements for these and other
purposes indicated in the report of the commis
sioner, under the head of the immediate neces
sities of the department, will not Involve any
expenditure of money that the country cannot
with propriety now undertake in the Interests
of agriculture.
It Is gratifying to learn from the bureau of
education the extent to which educational priv
ileges throughout the United States have been
advanced during the year. No more funda
mental responsibility rests upon Congress than
that of devising appropriate measures of finan
cial aid to education, supplemental to local ac
tion In the states and territories and in the
District of Columbia. The wise forethought of
the founders of our government has not only
furnished the basis for the support of the com
mon school systems of the newer states, but
laid the foundations for the maintenance of
their universities and colleges of agriculture
and the meehanic arts. Measures in accordance
with this traditional policy, for the further ben
efit of all these interests and the extension
of the same advantages io every portion of
the country, it is hoped will receive your
favorable consideration. To preserve and per
petuate the national literature should be among
the foremost cares of the national lerislature.
The library gathered at the Capitol stiff remains
unprovided with any suitable accommodations
for its rapidly increasing stores. The magni
tude and importance of the collection, Increased
as It is by the deposits made under the law of
copyright, by domestic and foreign exchanges,
and by the scientific library of the Smithsonian
Institution call for building accommodations
which shall be at once equal and fire-proof.
The location of such a public building, which
should provide for the pressing necessities of the
present and for the vast Increase of the nations
Docks in the future, is a matter which addresses
Itself to the discretion of Congress. It Is earnest
ly recommended as a measure which should
unite all suffrages, and which should no longer
be delayed.
THE WAsHINGTON MONUMENT.
The joint commission created by the act of
Congress of August 2, 1816, for the purpose of
supervising and directing the completion of
Washington National Monument, of which com
mission the President Is a member, has given
careful attention to this subject and already
the strengthening of the foundation has so far
progressed as to insure the entire success of this
part of the work. A massive layer of masonry
has been introduced below the original founda
tion, widening the base, increasing the stability
of the structure, and rendering It possible to
carry the shaft to completion. It Is earnestly
recommended that such further appropriations
be made for the continued prosecution of the
work as may be necessary for the completion of
this national monument at an early day.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion
to commend to Cong the adoption of a gen
erous policy towa the District of Columbia.
The report of the Commissioners of the District,
herewith transmitted, contains suggestious and
recommendations to all of which I earnestly In
vite your careful attention. I ask your early
and favorable consideration of the views which
they express as to the utgent need of legisla
tion for the reclamation of the marshes of the
Potomac and Its Eastern Branch, within the
limits of the city, and for the repair of the
streets of the capital, heretofore laid with
wooden blocks. and now by decay rendered
almest impassable, and a source of imminent
danger to the health of Its citizens. The means
at the disposal of the Commissioners are wholly
inadequate for the accomplishment of these
ini ort ant works, and should be supplemented
by tin.ely appropriations from the federal
treasury. The filling of the flats in front of the
city will add to the adjacent land and parksnow
owned by the United States, a large and valu
able domain, sufficient, it Is thought, to reim
burse its entire cost,and will also,as an Incidental
result, secure the permanent improvement of
the river for the purposes of navigation. The
Constitution having invested Congress with su
preme and exclusive jurisdiction over the Dis
trict of Columbia, Its citizens must of necessity
look to Congress alone for all needful legislation
affecting their Interests, and as the territory of
t his District Is the common property of the peo
ple of the United States, who, eually with its
resident citizens, are interest edIn the pros
perity of their capit al. I cannot doubt that you
will be amply sustained by the general voice of
the country in any measures you may adopt for
this purpose. I also Invite the favorable consid
eratlion of Congress to the wants of the public
sohools of this District, as exhibited In the
report of the commissioners. While the num
ber of pupils Is rapidly Increasing no adequate
provision exists for a corresponding Increase of
school accommnodation, and the commissioners
are without the means to mncet this urgent need.
A number of the buildings now used for school
purposes are rented, and are, in Important par
ticulars, unsuited for the purpose. The cause
of popular education In the District of Coluim
bla Is surely entit led to the same consideration
at the hands of the national government as In
the several States and Territories to which
muniliclent grants of the public lands have been
made for the endowment of schools and univer
bities.

THE JAMlEs RivER CANAL-The city of Rich

subscript Ion to the James River and Kanawha
railroad of $750,000. This appropriation has yet
to be voted for by the tax- payers at large, but
the general opinion is that the action of the
council will be confirmed. The proposed road

THE CArHOLcs AND PUuc ScnooLS.-A tele
gram Irom Boston says: It is now ascertained
that the recent statement that ArhihpWil
liams' decision upon the parochial scolqes
tion fully sustained the action of Father Sclly
is substantially Incorrect. It Is claimed by some
of those present at the synod that the substance
of the statement made by the Archbishop was
that while he recommended the establishment
of pal-ochial schools whenever It Is practicable,
he was utterly opposed to extreme mieasures ii
any manner connected with them: that under
certain circumstances where parents refused to
send their children to these schools the rigt of
sacrement might be temporarily withheld but
whenever a case of that nature occurred the
priest must cause a report of the facts to be
made to the Bishop, and he alone had power to
decide upon the matter.

The London Times on the Presi
dent's Wessage.
LONDON, Dec. 1.-The Time. In a leading edi
torial this morning, discussing the message of
President Hayes to Congress, says:-If the legal
tender notes in circulation be called in and can
celed, silver dollars must take their place and
the existing plethora be relieved. Further relief
will come in due time from the natural action of
trade. The money that has flowed in such pro
fusion from Europe to the United States cannot
always remain there. Its presence will soon be
felt in a rise of prices throughout the Union,and
as soon as a rise has been established, a demand
for European goods will follow and the current
of money from the east to the western shores of
the Atlantic will be arrested, If not reversed.
A process of this kind cannot be completed
within a week or a month, but its development
may be anticipated as confidently as the move
ment of the tides.

LoNDON Dec. .-The Times, in its financial

States are advices from Germany which show
that one million hundred weights of steel blocks
have been sold for shipment to America, by Herr
Krupp and others. This operation will be
financed through London.

the first division of the Circuit Court, Judge
Wylie, the case of C. W. Hayden vs. the Ches
peake and Ohio Canal, for$12.445 worth of stone,
which he claims the canal company used. was
given to the jury. Hayden owns quarries at
Seneca. and had a contract for supplying stone
for the new jail. A very large quantity of stone
was left on the canal bank, not being of the
proper size; this the agents of the company broke
up and used for work on the canal. The de
fence claimed-first. that the stone was worth
less; and second, that being abandoned on the
canal bank it became the property of the canal
company. After the jury was out several hours
being unable to agree (as is reported) on the
amount, the court Informed them that the old
common law rule was that jurors while deliber
aRing should be without food and fire, and while
It scemed hard, he would have to enforce the
rule. In the meantilpe if they agreed on a ver
dict they could seal it.

For the third time within a brief period of a
few weeks Thn SrAE Is ealed upon to mourn the
lo of a greatly valued enploye. Mr. William
I. McLean, for nearly twenty-seven years the
capable foreman of THE STAR composing room,
died at 5 o'clock this morning after a long and
painful illness from a complication of disorders.
of which Bright's disease was the latest fea
ture. His sufferings for months have been
of the acutest character, but they were borne
with remarkable fortitude and cheerfulness.
Mr. McLean was a native of Portsmouth, Va.,
and was within a month of 54 years of age. He
served his time as a compositor in the office of
the Portsmouth 2%mes, published by John T.
Hill, and afterwards worked on that paper and
the Portsnouth Pherpoix. He came here about
1845 or '6 and worked on the GloNe dur ing sev
eral sessions of Congress, returning to Virginia
during the recess, except when working on a
aper published by Jesse E. Dow and Thleophilus
1. His permanent residence was t faen up
here in 1850. When Connolly, Wimer and Mc
Gill sold out the lPegram, (the predecessor of
THE STAR), to Capt. Joseph B. Tate he went on
that paper as a compositor, and when' Walach
and Hope took charge of Tus STAR March 29,
1853, he was made foreman of the composing
room, a position he held up to the time of his
death. Thefidelity and ability with which he
performed his duties in this protracted service,
made him a national reputation, and quite cer
tainly no member of the typographical fratern
ity was held in higher esteem throughout the
country. lie united with the order of Odd Fel
lows October 27, 1853, in Columbia Lodge, No.
10. and from his first entrance into It. he became
one of the most devoted and active membcrs.
making Its precepts the rule of his life, and
ever endeavoring to carry out the Golden iRule;
Do unto others as you would they should do
unto you." As may be supposed, he rose rap
Idly in the order, passing through the chairs;
and about the same time lie was passing
through the chairs in the Encampment. In 1859
he commenced his service as a representative of
the Grand Encampment to Grand Lodge of the
United States, and a few years after he was
elected a representative of the Grand Lodge of
the District, which position he held at the time
of his death.
He joined the old Columbia Typographical
Society in October, 1850, and has always held a
prominent place therein having served several
years as presideat. He was also an active
worker in the labor organization of the District,
having been the first president of the Working
men's Assembly, an organization representing
the various trades unions.
In fact, in every position he held in his useful
and honorable life he brought to the discharge
of his duties an amount of zeal and fidelity that
made his name almost a household word in this
community as the emblem of high character.
Mr. McLean .eaves of his immediate family to
mourn him a wife and two children-a son
(Richard A. McLean) who succeeds him as fore
man of THE STAR composing room, and a daugh
ter, who is a teacher in the piblie schools. The
funeral will take place at 2 p. I. or Thursday
from Odd Fellows' Hall.
