THE ST. JOHNSBURY CALEDONIAN, DECEMBER 11, 1901.
I OUR WASHINGTON LETTER.
I IspeCial Correspondence.
I The plans for the new building for
the department of agriculture have
toeen agreed upon In outline, and It Is
I not thought there will be much difficul-
ty In getting the desired appropriation
of $2,000,000 from congress, for the
1 needs are obvious and the department
is popular with senators and represent-
1 atives, partly because they can see the
I .good it Is doing and partly because it
I furnishes them more material In the
I shape of publications and seeds with
which they can make complimentary
remittances to their constituents than
j they can get from any other depart-
I rnent.
The building is to be of white marble
S nd is to stand on the site of the pres-
l ent Inadequate building in the mall,
liut it will be so much larger than the
old building that the two large wings
I which it is to have will be quite clear
of the present site, and they can con-
1 soquently be built without disturbing
! the operations of the department In the
' old building. When the wings have
I been finished, the department can
move into them and get along while
the central building Is under construc
tion. The department at present has
overflowed Into all sorts of old dwell
ings and temporary wooden structures
iwhich are not only shabby looking, but
unsafe for the valuable collections of
ell kinds which are stored in them.
Will Sell Old Fnrnltare.
Major Alexander McDowell, the clerk
fcf the house of representatives, will
present for the consideration of the
buying public within n couple of months
an offering of antique furniture com
pletely dwarfing the stocks of ancient
cabinet ware of the largest dealers.
The offering will comprise a large
portion of the furniture which has
done service in the house of represent
atives as far back as the mind of the
oldest inhabitant runneth, pieces of
patched up furniture fairly waterlog
ged with traditions and heavy with
varnish.
Just prior to adjournment last spring
congress appropriated the sum of ?".'5,
500 to be expended In refurnishing the
hall, committee rooms, sergeant at
arms' otliee, etc., of the house, and the
cash lias been expended. The $73,500
worth of new furniture has been placed
in position and the remnants of other
days, are stacked away, dust covered
and battered mostly, among the mass
ive stone pillars and arches beneath
the rotunda of the capitoI. The law
appropriating the money for the new
furniture also authorized the clerk
of the house to dispose of the old stuff.
The date for its disposition has not
been fixed, but the time will not be
long before the auctioneer will have
the last word and the great mass of
solid walnut and varnish will pass un
der the lianmiP'
The Toga Too Large.
"I do not object to the style of your
overcoat," said Representative Iiing
liam of Pennsylvania to Senator Pen
rose, "hut It does not fit me." There
is absolutely no doubt as to the accu
racy of the statement regarding the
fit of the coat, and considerable laugh
ter was caused at the White House the
other day when Representative ISing
ham put on an ovncoat which he sup
pored to be his own.
By mistake the Pennsylvania repre
sentative had taken the outer garment
of Senator Penrose. P.ingham pre
sented a ludicrous spectacle, as Senator
Penrose is at least 0 feet 2 Inches
and built in proportion, while the repre
sentative Is a man somewhat below the
average and as thin and dapper as
they make them.
The senatorial coat contained enough
material to make two garments for
the represontrtive, who had some dilli
culty In extricating himself from the
immense folds of what might be called
a modern senatorial toga.
Harmony on Irrigation.
Representative K. J. Burkett of Ne
braska talked to the president the oth
er morning about Irrigation of western
arid lands. He found the president a
hearty advocate of national aid for
this purpose. The western representa
tives In congress have held several con
ferences the past summer to try to har
monize on an acceptable measure for
presentation to congress. Mr. Burkett
lias been the president of the gather
ings, which have resulted in an under
standing tliet the western congress
men are to press Irrigation legislation
from start to finish. So many sugges
tions have been made about irrigation
and there have been so many bills be
fore congress that there was never be
fore any chance for action. The west
ern congressmen are going to do better
from now on and are in high hopes of
being successful.
A Lincoln Memorial.
Senator Culiom of Illinois proposes
to introduce a bill In the senate pro
viding for an appropriate memorial to
Abraham Lincoln, to be erected in this
'city.
i "I wish to see a memorial that is ap
propriate and commensurate with the
great life of Abraham Lincoln," he
said to a Sta r reporter.
! The location, cost and form which
this memorial is to take are matters
,that he regards of secondary impor
tance. i Senator Cullom's bill will provide
'that the memorial of Lincoln bo located
'in accordance with the plans of the
park commission, and he hopes a fit
ting design may be obtained by means
of a competition, in which the greatest
artists of the world can be induced to
compete.
i Some of the cabinet houses have been
open for some weeks to callers on
Wednesdays, but the regular public re
ceptions will not begin before Jan. 1.
Time has made sorrowful changes in
the cabinet circle since this time last
year, and little gayety can be expected
from that branch of official service.
, Carl Schofield.
DIARY OF EVENTS.
TUESDAY. DEC. 3.
The president's message makes
recommendations to congress on nany
subjects. In dealing with, the problem
of reciprocity, while favoring the prin
ciple he opposes any general tariff
change. He deems publicity the only
remedy that can now be evoked in treat
ment of trusts. Other points are: Re
duction of tariff duties on Cuban im
ports into this country especially ad
vocated; construction of irrigation
works by the national governme it
urged; importance of building the isth
mian canal and the Pacific cable; Mon
roe doctrine should bo cardinal feature

the other hand, the decision on the

WEDNESDAY, DEO. 4.
Fourteen cities in Massachusetts held
elections. The most remarkable feature
was the defeat of the Socialists in both
Brockton and Haverhill. Another
feature was the success of the Repub
lican party, 10 mayoralty candidates (f
that party winning and carrying with
them in nearly every instance a city
council in sympathy with them. Two
Democratic mayors were el 'cted- in
Pitisfiell and Lawrence but in the
latter place the Republicans took
practically everything else. The usual
chief issue, that of license, seemed to
have been side-tracked, for the vo es
on both sides showed losses compart d
with last year. Of the 14 cities, 11 went
license, a gain of one over last year, the
change being in Fitcliburg Ten in

still offering at $2.SX3.50.
Native basket grapes are reduced toa
small supply of Catawbas, that sell in

HE FEARED HE HAD LOST
"When fu Ting Fang, the famous Chin
ese Minister to Washington, irritable and
somewhat forgetful from a Revere cold,
missed one day from the front of his cap the
immense diamond he always wears there,
he was dreadfully frightened. A friend
pointed out that the statesman had inad
vertently donned his turban wrong side
before, and that the diamond was safe in
the rear. Had Wu Ting Fang beon wear
ing a Benson's "Porous Plaster on his chest
or back to cure his cold, ho never w ould
have doubted its location. Ho would have
felt it doing itg work, warming and mak

the pain and soreness, promoting the free
circulation of the blood, stimulating tho
skin and lungs to proper action, and so
dissolving and banishing the malady. Thus

Perfect Health
Is within the reach of almost every
woman. The weakness, nervousness
and irritability from which so many
women suffer is in general due to dis
ease of the delicate womanly organism.
When the disease is cured the general
health is re-established.
Doctor Pierce's Favorite Prescription
makes weak women strong and sick
women well. It promotes regularity,
dries disagreeable and enfeebling drains,
heals inflammation and ulceration and
cures female weakness. When these
diseases are cured, headache, backache,
nervousness and weakness are cured also.
"I was very weak and nervous when I com
menced taking Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescrip
tion and 'Golden Medical Discovery.' about a
year ago," writes Mrs. M. K. Evefetts, of 89
Oxford Street, Woodstock, Ont. I had been
suffering for seven long months, and had taken
medicine from a physician all the time, but it
seemed to make me feel much worse. My
stomach was so bad (so my doctor told me), and
my nerves were in such a state that I would
start at the least noise. I felt irritable at all
times ; was not able to do any of my own house
work ; had to keep help all the time. How I
suffered God and myself alone know. I was
greatly discouraged when I commenced taking
your medicines, but the first bottle seemed to
help me. I took five bottles of ' Favorite Pre
scription,' two of 'Golden Medical Discovery,'
also two vials of Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets.
I can highly recommend these medicines to all
who suffer as I did. I never had better health
than I now enjoy, and it is all owing to Dr.
Pierce's medicines."

Adviser, in paper covers, is sent free on

ONE-HALF COST.
What I advertise, I always perform. Do vou know of anything
to the contrary? Exatnple:"$l,000.00 Fire Insurance in the residen
tial part of the village, will cost in any Stock Company $10.00 for 5
years. I can place this same insurance in a first-class Mass. Mutual
Co. that has been in business for 73 years, and that has a good sur
plus of nearly half a million dollars, for this exact sum, and on the
experience of many years will return you $5.00 at the end of the term
in a cash dividend. Is this worth saving or not ?
A one year policy will return 20 per cent, and a three years 30
per cent on the exact stock rates. Investigate and be convinced that
what I say, I stand ready to prove.
