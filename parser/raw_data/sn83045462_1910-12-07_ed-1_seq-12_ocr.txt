Zora met his eyes for the millionth pa
of a second and turned her head awt
deeply aorry for him. ? The woman's 1
atlnctive look dealt Instantaneous dea
to his hopes. It was one more enactme
of the tragedy of the bald head and tl
gray, beard. He spoke with;pathetic b
terness. Like Don Ruv Gomez da Sib
in 'Hernanl." he gave her to understai
t hat-, nojy', .when a young fellow pass<
him in the street he would give up all motor
cars and all his colossal canne
salmon business for the young fellow
taven hair and bright-eyes.
"Then you would love me. I could ma!
|jpu."
"What is love, after all?" asked Zora.
The elderly senator looked wistful
through the years over an infinite welt
f salmon tins, seeing nothing else.
"It's the meaning of life," said It
"I re discovered It too late."
He went away sorrowful, and Zora sa
the vanity of great possessions.
On the homeward steamer she had J
a traveling companion a young KngUsl
man whom she had met at Los Angele
one Anthony Pasent, an engineer of son
distinction. He was bronzed and healtl
'and littie-limbed. She liked him becau:
he had brains and looked ;her square
in the On the. first evening of tl
voyage a slight, lurch of the . vessel canst
her to.sltp, and she would .have falh
had *he riot caught iter by the arms. F<
the lirst time she realized how strong
iman could.'be; It was a new sensatio
not impTcasurable, and in thanking hi
; she blushed. He remained with iter t
'deck. ^ arid" tafkecl- of - their Californ
frierfdsTand'the drifted States.. The ne:
day h>, veftabllshfld "himself , by Jier sid
and dlsrdtir$ed' on the sea and the sk
human aspirations, the discomforts of It
cabin and a belief in eternal punishmen
The day after that he told her of h
ambitions, and showed her photographs i
his mother and sisters. After that thf
exchanged views on the discipline of Ion
ltnfss. I lis profesion. lie observed, toe
him to" the waste places of the earti
where there was never a woman to ehe<
him. and when he came back to Lnglan
he returned to a lieartli equally uncot
oled. Zora began to pity his forlorn coi
d it ion. To build strong bridges and la
down railroads was a glorious thing f<
a man to do: to do it without sweethea
or wife was nothing less than heroic.
In the course of time.he .told her tin
he was tli?' most beautiful woman 1
had ever met. He expressed liis admiri
tion of the gold flecks in her brown ey?
ard the gleams of gold in her hair whe
it was caught by the sun. He also wish?
that his sisters could have their skir
cut like herF anil could learn the art <
tying a veil over a hat. Then he took i
?i owling on inoffensive young men tvi
fetched her wraps and lent her the
binoculars. He declared one of them
be an unmitigated ass to throw who
overboard would be to insult the'Atianti
And then Zora recognised that he ws
stolidly In love .with her after the mai
ner of Ids stolid kind. Slie felt frighten*
and accused herself of coquetry. Hi
sympathy with his barren existence hi
perhaps overstepped the boundaries of p
lite interest. She had raised false hop<
in a young and ingenuous bosom. SI
worked herself up to a virtuous pitch i
self-reprobation and flagellated hersf
soundly, taking the precaution, howeve
of wadding the knots of the scourge wil
cotton-wool. After all. was it her fau
that a wholesome. young .Briton shou
fall in love with her? She .remember*
Kattenden's uncomfortable words on tl
eve of her first pilgrimage: "Beantlf
women like yourself, radiating feminii
magnetism, worry, a man exceeding^
You don't let him go about in peace,
Why should he let you?"
So Zora came face to face with tl
eternal battle of the sexes. She stampi
her foot in the privacy of her cabin, ai
declared the principle to be horrid at
primeval and everything that was mo
revolting to a woman who had earnest
set forth to discover the highest things <
life. For the remainder of the voyai
she avoided Anthony Dasent's eoinpar
as much as possible, and. lest he shoul
add jealousy to the gloom in which I
enveloped himself, sought exciting jo*
in the society of a one-eyed geologist wf
discoursed playfully on the foramlnifei
of the Pacini- slope.
One day Dasent came on her alone an
burst out. wrathftilly:
"Why are you treating me like this?"
"Like what?"
"You are making a fool of me. I'm n<
going to stand it."
Then she realized that when the ave
age man does not get what he wants e:
acgly when be wants it he loses his ten
i<er. She soothed him according to tl
batter instincts of her sex, but resolve
to play no more with elementary your
Britons. One-eyed geologists were safi
companions. The former pitched the
hearts into her lap: the latter, like Pav
kins, the geologist of the Pacific slop>
gave her boxes of fossils. She preferre
the fossils. You could do what you like
with them?throw them overboard whe
the donor was not looking, or leave thei
behind in a railway carriage. or tal
them home and present them to the vica
who collected butterflies, beetles, ammoi
ites and tobacco stopjiers. But an od
assortment of hearts to a woman wti
does not want them is really a confounc
ed nuisance. Zora was very much r<
lieved when Dasent. after eating an enoi
mous breakfast, bade Iter a tragic fan
well at Gibraltar.
It was a tfloudles* afternoon when sti
steamed into Marseille. The barren roc
islands on the east rose blue-gray from
blue sea. To the west lay the Isles <
TYtoul and the Island of the Chateau d'l
with its prison lying grim and long o
the' crest: in front the busy port", th
white noble city crowned by the churc
of Notre Dame de la Garde standing set
tinel against the clsar sky.
Zora stood on the crowded deck watch
trig the scene, touched as she always wa
by natural beauty, but sad at heart. Mai
?el!)e. within four-and-tsrenty hours c
j .oodon, meant home. Although she in
tended to- oonttooe' her wanderings t
Naples and Alexandria, she felt that eh
had come to tlie end of her journey. ]
had been ae profitless as the last. Paw
kins, by her side, pointed out the geoloc
leal feature of the rocks. She listene
vaguely, and wondered whether she wa
10 bring him home tied* to her chariot a
she had brought Septimus I>ix and Clei
Sypher. The thought of Sypher drew h<
heart to Marseille
"t Wish I were landing here like yoi
and going straight home." she said, lr
tempting the flow of scientific Inform*
lion. 'Tve already been to Naples, an
1 shall find nothing 1 want at Alea
andtia.**. 1
'Geologically, it's not very interesting,
>ald Fawkine.
"To afraid prehistoric antiquity do est*
make my pulses beat faster."
"That's the advantage of it."
"One might Just as well be a fossil one'
self."
"Much better." said Paw-kins, who ha
read Schopenhauer.
"You are not exhilarating to a depresse
voman." said Zora. with a laugh.
"I am sorry." he replied, stiffly. "I wa
trying to entertain you."
He regarded her severely out of hts or
ye and edged away, as if he repents
having wasted his time over go futile a
ganism as a woman. But her femiuii:
magnetism drew htm back.
"I'm rather glad you are going on i
AJ?\andrla." he remarked, in a tone <
ispieasure. and before she could reply 1
! .arched off to look after his luggage.
Zora's eyes followed him until he di:
f-p!?eared. then she shrugged her shou
d.?j?. Apparently one-eyed geologists wei
r* unsafe as elementary young Britot
ai d ooulent senators. She felt unfairl
treated by Providence. It was madde;
ing to realize herself as of no use in tt
universe except to attract the attentic
of the opposite sex. She clinched hi
hands in impotent anger. There was i
inisson on earth which she could fulfil
She thought enviously of Cousin Jane.

cide these cases fairly and impartially, by
but because of the imputations heaped tj,

any other cases Involving claims to Alas- ta:

Would Lease Coal Lands. ofl
Concerning the future of Alaskan coal
lands, the report makes a definite recom- ug
mendation in favor of the leasing sys- coi
tern, which also was favored by President
Taft in his message to Congress. The re)
recommendation follows: j is
"Your committee believe that it would j wi
be the height of unwisdom to permit ' In
these great coal fields to be monopolized ' by
or gathered Into the private ownership of j .
a few for speculative purposes. As they j
increase In value the increment should | n
inure to tne pcnent or all the people.
"To bring about this result and at the onsame
time put an end to the unreasonable 1H2
condition now existing, your committal, coi
recommend that the government refuse as
to sell these lands, but that, retaining .
their ownership, it shall g-ant leas s at s,t
fair roya'ties for periods limited, but Irng
enough and covering areas large enough sh<
to Justify the necessary investment* upon pe'
scund business princip'ea. nrd thuss?ou-e
the opening and operating cf sullcient -up
mines to meet the necessities of .Alaskan tto
consumption, aiTcrd relief from the pe?- ne<
ent outrageous prices paid by consumers, iv<
and at the same time afford some revenue
to the government. We recommend legisiation
to that end, and that pending tjfi
such legislation the existing withdrawal t
from entry of the Alaska coal lands be >ar
continued." P?
As to the Conduct of Mr. G'.avis during
the long period during which the Alaska
coal claim cases were tinder his control j.
as special agent of the land office, the
report declares that he had sufficient time "
and abundant assistance to make the field I,1(
examination which lie had demanded. In to
this connection the commitee said: "If erv
his demand was in good fa'.tli, Clavii .
was. grossly remiss in his duty in not
having tlie examination made then." cal

James R. Garfield, when Secretary of
e Interior, the committee says this ac>n
was taken by him after "he ascerined
that he would not be retained unr
President Taft." It is stated that
ese withdrawals were made "liaphazd"
from the mere inspection of the land
ice state maps. Many of these lands
re restored to the public domain by
cretary Hal linger and a portion were
ain set aside. The rewlthdrawals. acrding
to the committee, were made by
cretary Bailinger alte- a "careful exilnation
of the maps, notes, data and
ports In the geological survey.'' and It
held hy the committee that the retiidiawals
embraced all the power sites
the original blanket withdrawals made
Mr. Garfield.
Blanket Withdrawals of Land.
"he weakness of the then existing laws

by the committee which indorsed

mid be made only, for the purpose of

inket withdrawals are justified only
on condition of immediate examina11
and restoration of the land not

any aetiOn which Congress should

pensive withdrawals could not be Jus,ed,"
the report says, "a day longer
in was necessary to ascertain what
id actually constituted the supposed
wer sites."
The Indian Agreement.

Co-Operative Certificates,
For questioning the validity , of the
operative certificates by -which sett
within irrigation districts would be
mitted to pay a part of the chai
against them in worst instead of cash,
committee said that Secretary Ballir
had been assailed as an enemy of <
servation. In this connection the fine
of the majority was that "he was f
justified in taking the course he did.
he had done otherwise he would not b
been a faithful public officer." The i
retary held that the issue of the >
tiflcates was in contravention of the i
vision of the rec*amatlon act "that
contract can be let for any part o
project until the necessary funds
available in the reclamation fund."
Thirty Thousand 'Copies Order*
Senator Nelson, chairman of the e

of the voluminous testimony taken be]
