Mb. Hayes has nominated Secretary
McCrary for judge of the circuit court
in the Eighth district.
It costs three years In the peniten
tiary to talk back to Judge Orvis.of Cen
tre county. At least that Is what a boy
had added to his sentence for speaking
disrespectfully td that august Judge In
court. We would prefer the feelings of
the boy to a Judge who could so lose his
temper.
An attempt was made to kill the
Emperor of Russia last week. The train
he was expected to be on was blown up,
but he had passed half an hour earlier
and the damaged train carried the
baggage. The explosion caused a gap

eight inches deep, sixteen feet long and

The New York "Herald" Is authority
for the statement that the question as to
who is to be the next Lieutenant Gov
ernor of New York is not yet legally set
tled. The Democrats claim that ballots
cast for " C. M. Potter" should have
been counted for the candidate, Clarkson
N. Potter, instead of being thrown
aside as " defective" or " scattering","
which was done by the county canvas
sers. The question will not be definite
ly settled until the State Board of Can
vassers meet, which will not be before
the 15th.. Mr. Haskins' majority is va
riously stated at from 10 to 240.
The President's Message.
The Annual Message of the President
was delivered to Congress on the 1st Inst.
It is quite lengthy, but the following
gives a brief abstract of the Important
features of the document.
The President makes resumption the
starting point, and congratulates the
Nation on the success of the return to
specie basis. He thinks that " with a
currency equivalent in value to the mon
ey of the commercial world, we are en
abled to enter upon an equal competition
with other nations in trade and produc
tion. The Increasing foreign demand for
our manufactures and agricultural pro
ducts has caused a large" balance of trade
in our favor, which has been paid In gold
from the 1st of July last to November 15,
to the amountof about $39,000,000. Since
the resumption of specie payments there
has also been a marked and gratifying
improvement of the public credit. The
bonds of the Government, bearing only
4 per cent, interest, have been sold at or
above par sufficient in amount to payoff
all of the National debt which was re
deemable under present laws. The
amount of Interest savd annually by
the process of refunding the debt since
March 1, 1877,1s $14,297,177. The bonds
sold were largely in small sums, and the
number of our citizens now holding the
publio securities is much greater than
ever before.
"The amount of the National debt
which matures in less than two years is
$793,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears
interest at the rate of S per cent., and
the balance Is in bonds bearing C per
cent, interest. It is believed that this
part of the public debt can be refunded
by the issue of 5 per cent, bonds, and by
the reduction of interest which will
thus be effected about $11,000,000 can be
annually saved to the Treasury. To se
cure this important reduction of inter
est to be paid by the United States fur
ther legislation is required, which It is
hoped, will be provided by Congress
during Its present cession.
The coinage of gold by the minis of
the United States during the last fiscal
year was $40,9W,12. The coinage of
sliver dollars since the passage of the act
for that purpose up to November 1, 1879,
was $48,000,850, of which $12,700,844 has
been Issued from the Treasury and Is now
In circulation, and $32,800,000 is still in
the possession of the government. The
pendency of the proposition for unity of
action between the United States and the
principal commercial nations of Europe
to effect a permanent system for the
equality of gold and silver In the recog
nized money of the world leads me to
recommend that Congress refrain from
new legislation on the general subject.
The great revival of trade, Internal and
foreign, will supply, during the coming
year, Its own instructions, which may
well be awaited before attempting fur
ther experimental measures with the
coinage. I would, however strongly
urge upon Congress the importance of
authorizing the Secretary of the Treas
ury to suspend the coinage of sliver dol
lars upon the present legal ratio. The
market value of the Bilver bring uni
formly and largely less than the market
value of the gold dollar, It Is obviously
impracticable to maintain .them at par
with each other If both are coined with
out limit.
"The retirement from circulation of
United States notes, with the capacity
of legal tender In private contracts, is a
step to be taken In our progress toward
a safe and stable currency, which Bhould
be accepted as the policy and duty of the
government, and the Interest and securi
ty of the people. It is my firm convic
tion that the issue of legal tender paper
money, based wholly upon the authori
ty and credit of the government, except
in extreme emergency, is without war
rant in the constitution, and a violation
of strong financial principles. The Issue
of United States notes during the late
civil war, with the capacity of legul ten
der between Individuals, was not author
ized except as a means of rescuing the
country from Imminent peril. The cir
culation of these notes as paper money
for any protracted period of time after the
accomplishment of this purpose was not
contemplated by the framers of the law
under which they were Issued. They
anticipated the redemption and with
drawal of these notes at the earliest
practicable period consistent with the at
tainment of the object for which they
were provided. "
The President reports our relations
with all foreign nations in a satisfactory
condition. He gives considerable atten
tion to the civil service reform and on
the subject says:
"The views I have heretofore ex
pressed concerning the defects and
abuses In our civil administration re
main unchanged except In so far, as an
enlarged experience has opened my
sense of the duty, both of officers and
the people themselves, to co-operate for
their removal. The grave evils and
perils and of a partisan-spoils system of
appointment to ofilce and of office ten
ure are now generally recognized. In
the resolutions of the great parties, in
the reports of departments, in the de
bates and proceedingsof Congress, in the
messages of Executives, the gravity of
these evils has been pointed out and the
need of their reform has been admitted.
To command the necessary support,
every means of reform must bo based on
common right and justice, and must be
compatible with the healthy existence of
great parties, which are inevitable and
essential in a free State. When the peo
ple have approved a policy at a national
election, confidence on the part of the
officers they have selected and of the
advisers who, iu accordance with our
political institutions, should be consult
ed in the policy which it is their duty to
carry into effect, is indispensable. It is
eminently proper that they should ex
plain it before the people as well as Illus
trate Its spirit in the performance of
their official duties."
After saying much more on this sub
ject, he closes this part of his message
as follows :
" Though an officer should be as free
as any other citizen to give his own
money in aid of his opinions or his par
ty ,he Bhould also be as free any other cit
izen to refuse to make such gifts. If sal
aries are but a fair compensation for the
time and labor of the officers, it is gross
injustice to levy a tax upon them. If
they are made excessive In order that
they may bear the tax the excess Is an
indirect robbery of the publio funds. I
recommend, therefore, such a revision
and extension of present statutes as
shall secure to those in every grade of
official life - or public employment the
protection with which a great and en
lightened nation should guard those
who are faithful in its service."
The subject of polygamy is referred to
and Congress Is asked to take further
means to suppress the evil.
The failure of Congress to pass the
appropriation bills applicable to Con
gressional elections and Marshalls' ex
penses is noticed, and an earnest request
is made that the matter be cared for at
this session.
In reference to the Indian affairs, the
President suggests that the law tie al
lowed to remain as It In, and objects
to having the control of the Indian
affairs taken from the Interior Depart
ment and placed on the army. The
President closes hi message by a refer
ence to the Washington Monument and
a hope that an appropriation would be
made to finish that monument and to
Improve the school buildings of the Dis
trict of Columbia.
Strange Case In Massachusetts.
The wife of Franklin Chase died sud
denly at Westport on November 20th,
Pieparatlons for her burial were made,
but the lifelike remains induced' the
friends to postpone the funeral and the
body has been kept until the present
time, no changes having appeared since
death. It Is not yet known whether
the case Is one of suspended animiatyn
or whether death lius' actually taken
place.
