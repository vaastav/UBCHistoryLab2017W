Mr Blalne la Wrong
j As 1 part of tho political news of tho day
< and a most interesting and Important part
0 wo print Mr JAM ELAINES comments
S upon President CLEVELAND message Mr
BLAINE is now in Paris and his remarks a
reported through Mr GEOBQB W HMALLEY
tJ a telegraphed to tho New York Tribune
o His ylows have a peculiar Importance at
present from tho fact that they indicate tho
policy which will b followed by tho Bepub
llcans in the Senate and House of Repre
t sentatives in dealing with the indispensable
reduction of the revenue and they merit
consideration accordingly entirely apart
from strength or the weakness of tho arguments
t guments with which he endeavors to sustain
and enforce thorn because they point t the
only class of measures t which the Republi
i can Senate will 1x likely t give It assent
i Not the least Interesting thing in Mr
t ELAINES declaration of tho policy ho would
adopt I circumstances gave him the control
of the nations financial affairs I in regard
t to the whiskey t Mr ELAINE would
maintain tho internal revenue tax on alc
0 hol except so far a the alcohol Is used in
the arts or In meclumlcol pursuits and he
would spend tho money thus raised in estab
lishing 1 system of coast and harbor de
fences in accordance with tho recommenda
tions of Mr TIDES memorable letter
upon that subject
But Mr ELAINE would go much further
c than that When tho coasts were at last
I fortified and tho harbors adequately de
fended ho would still maintain the whiskey
t because ho regards it as 0 powerful
moral agency operating for temperance re
form file language is too explicit t b
misunderstood So long as there I whiskey
tax Mr ELAINE Mr
t t Br says a reported by
BIIALLEY I would tax it and when the
National Government should have no U for
i the money I would divide tho tax among tho
members of the Federal Union with the
emb t Fcem wit te sp
olflo object of lightening the tax ou real
estate
The proposition t continue a Federal Internal
ternal tax and for tho
revenue t solely ad directly to
purpose of promoting 0 moral reform in I
matter properly under State regulation and
to parcel out among tho States the money In
j tho Federal Treasury with a view t lighten
ing State taxationis too preposterous for
serious discussion
I Brother BLAINE entertains such los
notions of tho relations between the Federal
Government and tho States It strikes us
that ho would bo a conspicuously unfit por
tion t Intrust with the management of the
nations financial affairs
Some of the Points Left Out
In making no allusion to our foreign re
lations or t international Interests in
4 tho message sent to Congress President
I CLEVELAND departed from the precedent
sot by his predecessors and hitherto fol
lowed by himself It I true as ho said
that no appropriation I made for an accom
panying report from the Secretary of State
That Is because tho Chief Magistrate ha
been wont t view the business of the State
Department as peculiarly his own and t
submit under his ow signature t the
Federal legislature an account of tho
work accomplished In progress proposed
in that sphere of Executive duty
S The President h however distinctly In
timated that tho information desired by
S Congress and the country in regard t tho
transactions and intentions of tho State
Department will b communicated In a supplemental
This will bo
plemental message perhaps wl b
S deferred until the International Commis
S sion now sitting In Washington has been
able t agree on such a settlement of tho
fisheries controversy as might with at least
some chanco of acceptance b submit t
a the Senate There Is eomo reason also t
believe that tho project of a now treaty with
S Nicaragua lei open t objection than tho
former convention which the Senate failed
I to ratify will before long b announced
t There I another subject of international
Importance which Mr CLEVELAND
I S ImprLnco upon r CLVELAD
was expected t touch and t which ho will
S doubtless refer In hlsaupplomcntalinebago
fr We understand that tho State Department
regards with favor the suggestion that tho
President should Invite other marl time
ldent oter maritme pow
ers t join tho United States In convoking
S an International congress for the purpose of
considering and agreeing upon regulations
calculated t secure greater safety at sea by
diminishing the risk of collisions Recent
disasters have disclosed with painful clear
ness tho grave deficiencies In the method of

Secretary Whltncya Work
The report of the Sort of tho Navy Is

terest and successful achievement I Mr
WIUTNET takes pride in ono stop moro than

b his consolidation of tho calls for all tho
armor and gun steel needed by his depart
ment by which he was able t lay the foun
dation of the new system of supplying the
materials for national defence from American
can factories In describing this ho does not
exaggerate its relation to the public welfare
The bids were opened on the 23d day of March last
and coming at a tune when the fallur ot Congress to
make provision for tbe countrys defence waa being gen
erally rluUd caused a feeling ot qui universal con
ra
gratulation throughout the country It marked a most
Important step In tha progress toward national Inde
pendence most sincerely dIe I I believed by the
luau portion ot our people
Tho price paid for tho steel Is a little
higher than that of an equivalent product of
European works would b but the cost of
production will b lessened with time and
meanwhile American labor and skill find 0

formation of a naval reserve and the Hydro
graphic Office has been busy with It prep
aration of valuable charts A recommenda
tion of Importance from the latter source is
that a vessel should b employed through

Olsen unarmored torpedo boats and after

will advise unless submarine boats or the
cruisers should meanwhile solve

the problem trying protected torpedo craft
He also disapproves repairing the single
turret monitors He asks for five additional
vessels and expects them t equal the best
of their class In making heavy guns tho
country I progressing while the contract
with the HoTCHKJsa Company starts the
manufacturing of its rapid fire guns here
That the liberality of Congress and tho in
dustry of tho department havo not been
premature I evident from the calculations
of Chief Constructor WILSON that of tho
twentyeight wooden steam vessels now remaining
maining in the navy only four can last more
than six years and In nine years our en
tire wooden navy will have disappeared
Tho zeal with which new construction both
of ships and guns has been pushed makes It
certain that fast and efficient steel vessels
will b ready t tko the places of these old
craft as they drop out while those types of
cruisers battle ships torpedo vessels and
harbor defence monitors that show tho best
results In actual service can b duplicated

Enough Silver Dollars
Secretary FAxncniiD8 recommendation
that future purchases of silver by the Treas
ury under the act of 1878 shall not bo actu
ally coined into dollars but laid away In the
form of largo bars I in every respect sensible
ble and worthy of adoption Silver men
cannot object t it because It would continue
the acquisition of the metal by the Govern
ment to the extent and would
t te same a now woud
in nowise restrict the issue of silver certifi
cates which experience shows are moro de
sired by the people than the coins thoy rep
resent while the opponents of sliver would
b pleased with It because it would diminish
the expense t the country for manufacture
storage and handling of what thoy regard as
a mischievous element of the currency
What the Secretary says about the sum
clenoy of the present stock of silver dollars
for the needs of tho country Is too plainly
true to b controverted More than two
hundred millions of the coins arc now lying
in the Treasury vaults a security certifi
cates t an amount fifty millions less Until
therefore the issue of certificates shall reach
the amount of dollars in tho Treasury there
I evidently no need of moro dollars and it
may also b sold that tho amount of certifi
cates might b increased many millions beyond
yond tile total In tho Treasury both of silver
coin and silver bullion without danger Wo
have now in circulation 340000000 in green
backs to secure which no specific coin or
bullion Is sot aside and which aro redeemable
in sliver and yet they are at par with gold
Surely a few millions moro of such money
could b safely added
The logical result of our currency experi
ence Is a uniform national paper money
based upon no specified security beyond the
national credit Both tho silver certificates
and the gold certificates as well a tho na
tional bank notes should be withdrawn and
cancelled and their place supplied by an
additional issue of plain legal tenders We
should then have everywhere one kind of
money and no more tho cost of it would be
small and tho entire profit of it would b

accepted traditions about this wellknown
scouts good auajltlos of all sort with Mr
WAnDs impressions gathered from an ac
quaintance with KIT beginning on a hunting
expedition in 1838
KIT was with the same party Knew him perfectly
lie was about 23 years old tbcn A little man and not
half so brave as he waa afterward made to appear He
got his reputaUou for bravery by shooting a Frenchman
through the hand That was after we had reached the
Arkansas River and established a trading rendezvous
KIT was married t a Snake squaw He got tired of her
and sold her to this Krencby for Ive forgotten how
many horses Some time afterward KIT wanted her
again and the Frenchman wouldnt give her up Kit
told h he would have t flght then So they saddled
horses marked off adlstance and rode toward each other
and shot with revolvers when they met The French
man WM skot through the band and that ended II
No KIT wasnt very gritty I once saw aigambler
back him out but the gambler had a big knife and KIT
had no weapon However be never sought to renew
the quarrel when he was heeled
I was with Ciasoi on one long trapping expedi
tion down among the Digger Indians on the Glta River
One day CiasoN and I saw an old Digger pulling swamp
weeds and eating the tender pErt near the roots KIT
told me 1 kill blm I wouldnt do It and told KIT that
I be wanted him killed t kUUblrn himself KIT was
about t do so when I stood between him and lb In
dian and told him that I would blow a load plumb
through him I be tried t kill the Indian lie was mad
and didnt speak to for days hut be
dldnlpk t me some didnt k
the Indian
On time our trapping party there were six or
eight of us was In a bud way The Indiana bad
got all our horses and all our provisions We
bad nothing eat and nothing to get food with ex
cept our guns Bo two of the party would go ont bunt
Ing along the line and bring In what they killed Some
ot the men would divide everything they got jack
rabbits mostly anil some wouldnt KIT Ciiio was
one of those wbo wouldnt He would sit I down benlnd
a sage bush after killing a rabbit and eat the whole
rabbit himself
I is clear that Mr WAnD is not the author of
th countloaa work about this celebrated char
acter which for oar have invigorated and
charmed plO after page of tie popular
weekly story papers In none of these
was there ever an Indication that KIT
CAIUSON could have suggested that somo other
fellow should shoot a harmless and hungry
Digger Indian or that tho generous and soil
sacrificing scout an be baa appeared in stories

unjustified by KITs real character and that I
tho latter was actually a very good sort of fel

Tho reported mossing of Russian troops
on the frontier recently soared the Austrians
and sot them t getting their own fighting men
together Now an explanation comes from
Russia that everybody wants peace there and
that tho Russian operations have no warlike
significance but that in view of the important
military preparations now going on in Austria
prudence demands the making of preparations
to defend exposed points In other words
having alarmed tho Austrian by tholr move
ments of troops the Russians now point to the
results of that alarm in Austria as tho cause of
their own military movements

PAnts Dec 7Mr Blame began by say
lag have boon rendlmr nn abstract of tee
nnldonts message and have boon especially
interested In the comments of the London pn
pens Those papers all assume t declare the
message Is a free trade manifesto andovldent
ir aro anticipating an enlarged market for
English fabrics ip the Uniud eLates OB a con
neauonee of the Presidents recommendations
Perhaps that fact stamped tho character of tho
message more clearly than any words of mine
Yon dont moa actual free trade without
duty queried the reporter
dutY replied Mr Blnln Nor do the Lon
don papers moan that They simply mean that
the 1realdnnt has recommended what In tho
United Htatcs Is known RS a revenue tariff re
jecting the protective feature as an object anti
not even permitting protection to result freely
as an Incident to revenue duties
I dont know that I quite comprehend that
last point said the reporter
I moan said Mr Blame that for tho first
time In tho history of the United buttes thin
President recommends retaining the Internal
tax In order that the tariff may be forced down
I even below the fair revenue standard lie rec
ommends that tho ta on tobacco b retained
and thus that many millions annually shall bo
mllon shal
levied on a domestic product which would far
bettor come from a tariff on foreign fabrics
Then do you mean to Imply that you would
favor the repeal of th A tobacco tax
Certainly I mean tOlaeco that sold Mr
Elaine I should urco that I be sad once
even before the Christmas holidays It would
Chrstma hOldais
In the frt pines brine great relief to growers
rlo GrOWr
of tobacco all over the country and would
i moreover materially lessen tho price of the
article to tho consumers Tobacco to millions
I of men Is a necessity President calls It a
luxury but it Is 1 luxury in no other sense
than tea and coffee are luxuries It Is well to
romcmbor that the luxury of yesterday be
comes u necessity of today Watch If
you please tho number of mon at work
on the farm In tho coal mine nlong the rail
road in the Iron foundry or In any calling
cal1n
anil CH will find ninetyfive I In 10 chewing
while they work After each tnenl tho samo
proportion seek tho solace of a pipe or a clear
Ulpo clllr
Thlll men not only pay the millions of the to
bacco tax but pay on every plug and every cl
ear an enhanced price which the ta enables
tho manufacturer anti retailer to Impose The
only excuso for such a tax is tho actual neces
sity under which the Government found itself
during the war and the years immediately fol
lowing To retain the tax now In order to de
stroy the protection which would Incidentally
flow from raising tho name amount of money
on foreign Imports Is certainly a most extraor I
dinary policy for our Government
Well then Mr lilalne would you advise the
repeal the whiskey ta also
No I would not Other considerations than
not Otherconliderntonsthnn
those of financial administration are to be
taken into account with regard to whiskey
There is I moral side to It To cheapen tho
price of whiskey 18 1 to Increase Its consump
tion enormously Thor would be no sense In
urging the reform wrought by high license In
many States the national Government neu
tralizes the good effect by making whiskey
within ronoh of every Qne at twenty cents a
Gallon Whiskey would be everywhere dis
tilled If the surveillance of the Government i
were withdrawn by the rmission UovarDleut I
te
and illicit Bales could not then bo prevented
even by a policy R rigorous and searching as
that with which Russia pursues the Nihilists
It would destroy high license In all tho States
Whiskey las dono a vast deal of harm In
the United States I would try to make it do
some good I would use the tax to fortify our
cities on the seaboard In view ot the power
ful letter addressed to the Democratic party on
the subject of fortifications by the Into Mr
Samuel J Ttlden in 18R5 I Am amazed that no
attention hOB been pad t the subject by the
Democratic Administration Never before In
the history of tho world has any i Government
allowed great cities on the seaboard like New
York Philadelphia Boston Baltimore Now
Orleans and Ban Francisco to remain abso
lutely dafancoloss rmn
But said the reporter you dont think wo are
roporer
t have war In any direction Ar
Certainly not1 said Mr Blaine Neither I
presume did Mr Tlldon when ho wrote his re
mrkablo luttor But we should chance a remote
mote chance Into an absolute Impossibility If
our weak and exposed points were strongly
fortified I today we had by any chance ovon
such a war as we had with Mexico our enemy
could procure ironclads In Europe that would
menace our Brent cities with destruction or lay
them under contribution
contributon
But would not our fortifying now possibly
look as If wo expected war
Why should It any more than the fortifica
tions made seventy or eighty years ago by our
Grandfathers when they guarded themselves
against successful attack from the armaments
of that day Wo dont necessarily export a
burglar because wo look our dom at night
but If by any possibility n burslar eOIea it
contributes vastly to our peace of mind and
our sound sleep to feel that ho cant got la
But after the fortifications are constructed
would you maintain the whiskey tax
Yes said Mr Blame 8 lone as there is
whlskoy to tax I would tnt it and when the
national Government should hnvo no use for
the money I would divide tho tax among the
members of the Federal Union with the soocii
fio object of lightening the ta on real estate
The houses and fnrms of the whole country
pay too large a proportion of the total taxes
If f ultimately relief could be given In that di
rection It would in my judgment be D wise
and beneficent policy Some honest but mis
guided friends of temperance have urged that
the Government should not use the monoy de
rived from the tax on whiskey My reply is
repl
that the ta on whiskey by the Federal Gov
ernment with its suppression of all Illicit dis
tillation and consequent enhancement of
price has been 0 powerful agent in the tem
perance reform by putting It beyond tho roach
of so many The amount of whiskey con
sumed In the United States per capita today is
not more than 40 per cent pr that consumed
thirty yearn ago
Mr Dial no added that In his judgment the
whiskey tax should be HO modified as to per
mit all who use pure alcohol I tho arts or In
mechanical pursuits to have It freo of tax In
all such cases tho tax could bo remitted without
lh
out danger of fraud just as now the tax on
spirits exported I remitted tx
Besides your general and sweeping oppo
sition t the Presidents recommendation have
you any further specific objection
Yes answered Mr ObjotonI should seri
ously object to the repeal of the duty on wool
To repeal that would work great Injustice to
many interests and would seriously dlscour
ago what we should earnestly encourage
namely the sheep culture among farmers
throughout the Union To break down wool
growing and lie dependent on foreign countries
for the blanket under which we Bleep and the
coat that covers our backs Is not a wise policy
for the national Government to enforce
Do you think if the President recommenda
tion were adopted it would increase our export
trade 0 PossiblyIn some few articles of peculiar
construction It might but it would Increase
our Import trade tenfold aa much In the great
staple fabrics in woollen and cotton goods In
Iron In stool In all tIm thousand and one
shapes in which they are wrought How are
we to export btnple fabrics to bite markets of
Jhuropo unless we make thorn cheaper than
they do in Europe and how are we to manu
facture them cheaper tbnn in Kurop unless wo
get cheaper labor than they hao In Europe 1
Than you think that the question of labor
underlies the whole subject
Of course It does replied Mr Blame It
is In fact the entire uuohtion Whenever wo
can foroclearpenters masons iron workers and
mechanics In ovary department to work as
cheaply and live ns poorly In tim United States
as similar workmen ill Europe wo can of
course manufacture just as cheaply as
they do lu England and France But I am
totally opposed to a policy that would entail
such results To attempt it it equivalent to a
social and financial revolution ono that would
bring untold distress
Yea but might not the farmers be benefited
by Importing articles from Europe instead of
buying them at higher prices at home
Tho moment answered Mr Blame you
begin to import freely from Europe you drive
ourown workmen from mechanical and manu
facturing pursuits In the same proportion
they become tillers of the Boll Increasing
steadily the agricultural product and decreas
Inc steadily the largo home demand which is
constantly enlarging ns home manufacturers
enlarge That works great Injury to the
farmer glutting the market with his products
and tending constantly to lower prices
Yes but the foreign demand for farm prod
ucts would bo Increased would It not
Even suppose It were said Ms Blaln
how do you know the source from which it
will bo HUPP led Tho tendency In Ilunsia to
day ned In the ABlntlo possessions of England
is I toward a lance increase of the grain supply
the grain beIng raised by the cheapest possible
labor Manufacturing countries will buy their
bremletufli where they can get them cheapest
and the enlarging of the home market for the
American farmer b lng checked ho would
March In vain for onetof the same value Ills
foreign sales are already checked by tile great
competition abroad There never wn a time
when th Increase of n largo homo market wax
so valuable to him The best proof IB that tho
farmers are prosperous tn proportion to tile
nearness of amanufacturfng centres and a
protective tanji tends to spread lnanuiactures
dli Ohio and jadlans for example though not
classed ua manufacturIng mates the annual
value of fabrics IB larger titan the annual value
of agricultural products
But those holding the Presidents views me
marked the reporter are always quoting the
great prosperity of the country under the tariff
cdlS4O
That tariff did not Involve the OBR destruc
tire point recommended by the President
namely the retaining of direct Internal taxes
In order to abolish Indirect taxes levied on
foreign fabrics But the country had peculiar
advantages under It by the Crimean war In
yolvlng England France and Russia and
largely Impairing their trade All those mat
dents or accidents if you choose were Im
mensely stimulatIng to trade In the United
mates regardlesn of the nature of our tariff
But mark the end of this European experience
with the tariff mo which for a time gave an
illusory nnddeceptive show of
It te enactment was Immediately fol1oJ
by the MexIcan war then In 1818 by0
convulsion Europo then In 1849 i
oeedlng years by tho enormous gold ieli i
California The powers made peace it bo
and at the same Unto the output of gkt ir
California fell off Immediately time fillss Lii
panlo of iBM came upon the country wttillij
natrons force Though wo had In those Ysrq
mined it vast amount of gold In Califtirita
every bank In New York wan comnelled tn sd
pond specie payment Tour hundred mlllloi
In gold had been carried out of the country i
eight year to pay for foreign goods that Mioui
nave been manufactured at homo anti wo bail
yearn ot depression and distress oa an atone
mont for our folly
Do you mean to Imply that there should to
no reduction of the national revenue
No what have said Implies the reverse I
would reduce It by prompt repeal of the to
bnoco tax and would nike bore ami titers
some changed in the tariff not to roduco pro
tection but wisely foster It
Would you explain yourmennliw more fully
I mean said Mr Blnlnothat no great
system of rovonuo like our tariff mn operate
with ofUdcncy and equity unless limo phnn c
of trade bo closely watched and thit fiw
promptly adapted to those chniuion But I
would make no change that should Impair the
protective character of the whole body of the
lurid laws Four years aco in time net of 1883
wo made changes of the character I have tried
to Indicate If such changes were made and
the fortifying ot our seacoast thus undertaken
at n very moderate annual outlay no surplus
would bo found after that already accumulated
hmi been disposed of Tho outlay of money OH
fortlllontlonH while doing great service to the
country would give good work to many men
The reporter repented Iho question whether
time Presidents recommendation would not
Rive us n largo Inoronpo in exports
I only repeat answered Mr Blain that
would vastly enlarge our imports while time
only export It would seriously increase would
bo our gold and silver That would flow out
bounteously just as it did under the tariff of
184C Tho Presidents recommendation on
acted Into law would result as did an experi
ment in drainage ot a man who wished to
turn n swamp Into n productive field lie dug
n drain to a neighboring but It happened
unfortunately that tile level of the river was
hluhorthnn the level of tho swamp The conto
nucnco need not bo told A parallel would bo
found when the Presidents policy in attempt
ing to open u channel for nn increase of ex
ports should simply succeed in making way
for a deluging Inflow nt fabrics to tbo destruc
tion of homo Industry
But dont you think It important to Increase
our export trade
Undoubtedly but It is vastly moro impor
taft not to lose our own great market lor our
own people in the vain effort to reach the Im
possible It Is not our foreign trade that has
caused the wonderful growth and expansion of
the republic It Is the vast domestic trade be
tween thirtyeight States and eight Territories
with their population of perhaps 63000000
day The whole amount of our export and Im
port trade togotherhos never I think reached
1900000000 any one year Our internal home
trade on 130000 miles of railway along 15000
miles of ocean coast over the five great lakes
and along 20000 miles of navigable rivers
reaches the enormous annual aggregate of
moro them J40000000000 and perhaps this
year tSOOUOOOOOOO
It la into this illimitable trade oven now in
its Infancy and destined to attain n magnitude
not dreamed of twenty years ago that the in
ropeans are struggling to enter It Is the heri
tage of the American people of their children
and of their children s children It gives an
absolutely free trade over a territory nearly as
largo BK all Kurono and the profit la all our
own The genuine froo trader appears una
ble to see comprehend that this continental
trade not our exchanges with Europe Is the
great source of our prosperity President
Cleveland now plainly proposes a policy that
will admit Europe to a share of this trade
But you are in favor ol extending our foreign
trade are you not
Certainly I am in all practical and advan
tageous ways but not on the principle of the
free traders by which wo shall b constantly
exchanging dollar for dime Moreover the
foreign trade is often very delusive Cotton H
manufactured in the city of my residence if
a box of cotton goods Is sent 200 miles to the
province of New Brunswick it Is foreign trade
If shipped 17000 miles around Cane Horn
to Washington Territory it is domestic trade
The magnitude of the Union and the Immensity
of Us Internal trade require a new political
economy The treatises written for European
States do not grasp our peculiar situation
Will not the Presidents recommendation to
admit raw material find strong support
Not by wise protectionists in our time Per
haps some greedy manufacturers may think
that with free coal or free iron ore they can do
great things but if they should succeed in try
ing will us the boys Bay catch It on the re
bound If the homo trade in raw material id
destroyed or seriously Injured railroads will be
the first to fool it If that vast interest la crip
pled In any direction the financial fabric of tim
whole country will fool it quickly and soriounly
If any man can clvo a reason why wo should
arrange time tariff to favor the raw material of
other countries in a competition against our
material ot thesame kind I should like to hear
It Should that recommendation ot the Presi
dent bo approved It would turn 100000 Ameri
can laborers out of employment before it had
been n year In operation
What must bo the marked and general effect
of bite Presidents message
It will bring the country whore It ought to
be brought to a full and fair contest on tli
question of protection The President himself
makes It the one Issue by presenting no other
In his message I think It well to have the ques
tion settled The Democratic party In power
is a standing menace to the industrial pros
perity of the country That menace should ho
removed or the policy It foreshadows should
be made certain Nothing Is no mischievous
to business as uncertainty nothing so paralyz
ing aa doubt
