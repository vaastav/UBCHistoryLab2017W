FBIDAY MORNING DEC. ».1»W.
The rmMtM'i
We h»ve careftilly perused this IUIX
isuly looked-for document. In the
infcin it is what we might expect fiom
Mr. Lincoln—a concise, unvarnished
reference to all our public affhir*. Re
ferring to Canada, the President inti
mates the possibility of a modification
on our part, of the rights of transit, and
the reciprocity treaty, unless neutrality
is better observed. The condition of
the several Departments of government
Me briefly noticed and concisely stated.
Referring to the recent election, Mr.
Lincoln states a fact that may appear to
many too incredulous to be believed, so
vivid have been our imaginations con*
eerning the destruction of human life.
Abraham Lincoln has presented the
outlines of his own character in the
elosing words of this message. Plain,
honest and in a straightforward maimer
he says It seems to me no attempt
at negotiation with the insurgent leader
oould result in any good. They can at
any moment have peace simply by lay
ing down their arms and submitting to
the national authority under the Con
stitution."
But the foot of the President comes
down with emphasis when he declares
that the time may come, probably will
gome, when the door of amnesty, open
for a year past, will be closed, and that
In lieu more vigorous measures than
heretofore shall be adopted." We
thank the President for those words.—
They indicate that we have not a man
«f putty for President. The high moral
eharacter of the President is more strik
ingly shown in his final words—"I re»
peat the declaration made a year ago,
that while I remain in my present posi
tion, I shall not attempt to al^r or mod
ify the emancipation proclamation, nor
shall I return to slavery any person who
is free by its terms or by the acts of
Congress. If the people should, by
whatever means, make it an Executive
duty to re-enBlave such persons, anoth
er, and not I, must be the instrument to
perform it."
God bless Abraham Lincoln! Our
oonfidence in his honesty, in his patri
«tism and integrity, is confirmed. \V
•hall come out of this conflict a purer
oation for having been governed by
Honest Aba.
la(rM«iaf
T*pl«n.
In ordinary times the President's
annual message, presenting in bn«»f the
Altancial condition, material interests
and relations with Foreign powers,
Would be Anxiously looked for by the
reading public. It so happen* this year
that while everybody is anxiously look
ing for Mr. Lincoln's annual disquisi
tion upon national affairs, they are a
little more interested in hearing from
Sherman, and so we take it for granted
iiiat our readers will not complain if,
instead of giving the message this morn
ing, we shall give some pleasing intelli
gence from Sherman. That Sherman
has reached his objective point of desti
nation before this there can be no doubtw
If he does not already occupy Savan«
Bah, ha is safely encamped in its vicin
ity, on the coast, where he will be able
to communicate with our Navy. That
this has already been done we infer
/torn the tone of the rebel press. Sher
man is at present the centre of attrac
tion. He carries to the coast a formid
able army of not less than 60,000
veterans.
The Chicago Journal mentions a well
founded rumor that Burnside has pro
ceeded by water to Savannah, to co
operate with Sherman. Whether this
be true.or net, certain it is that we have
sufficient force to make.ourselves ex
ceedingly troublesome to the enemy.—
There may be truth in the intimations
of the rebel press that Bberman is to
play an important part in the downfall
of Richmond. Be patieut!
MUDUJLING WITH OTHKh I'bOfl.K'H
JkJSiNEfjS.—Rev. Joseph Barker, an En
glishman, from Manchester, has been
trying to get »u interview with the
President to present u peace »ddresn
signed by 350,000 English s\ inpathiaers
with rebellion, in which the signers
.have the assurance to recommend a sep
aration of the Southern States from the
North. The President, iiniiiug that the
address has no official sanction from the
English Government, very properly de
clined any interview with Mr. Barker.
The latter would more aid the cause of
peace by trying to prevent his country
men assisting the rebels with arms and
ships to make war upon the Govern
ment a majority of the people of the
JJiiited States prefer.
?his man Barker is the same who was
fitmerly notorious in this country as a
preacher of infidelity and anti-slavery.
He became disgusted at his poor success
here, returned to England, whence he
came, renounced his infidelity and be
came a clergyman. Lately ho has been
&»veling in England as an agent for the
rebels.
HJEAY MAIL ROBBERY.—A hag con
taining 600 letters, sent from Galesburg
for Chicago, about the 1st of November,
was stolen by a young man named John
B. Zimmerman, of Galesburg, who ri
fled its contents, including a number of
drafts. He was arrested while attempt
ing to negotiate oneof the drafts in Chi
cago, and thirty-nine draft* were found
in his possession, aggregating $14,000.—
He made a full confession, stating that
he entered the baggage car soon after
the train left Galesburg, and shoved the
mail ba.i out of the car unobserved by
anybody, and then jumped out after it.
The circumstance shows a looseness in
the maanner of carrying mail sacks on
the cars which calls for a-remedy.
'IGU A correspondent from Richmond
t» the Charleston Mercury says that the
g&pular sentiment is decidedly against
the use of negro soldiers in the rebel
army. With Jeft. Da.vis Consti
tutional objections to the measure, ho
Continues, do not seem to have more
weight than those against interferin
With the liberties of he press.
iggf A Democratic paper c-isoles
iteelfas follows: "It is no shame to
belong to the minority. Noah and his
family were in the minority, while the
K*st majority went to destruction, pret
ty much as they are going now."
B*O4 LA PERIL.
Sherman knew well the streugth and
capacity of his own troops as well as the
weakness and foolhardineBs of Hood,
when he turned his back upon the
North, and marched to the coast.—
Bherman gone, Hood thought it but a
trifling matter to scatter our outposts to
the winds, meet Thomas under disad
vantageous circumstances and wipe him
out of military existence, and then
march to the Ohio, or turn suddenly in
to East Tennessee, toward Lynchburg,
and help annihilate somebody else.—
With 35,000 well appointed troops he
undertakes this Herculean task. Find
ing a detached portion of Thomas'
troops falling back with a long and val
uable traiu, he thought the golden op
portunity for him had arrived, and
pressing hard upon one column, re
ceived such a welcome as he will al
ways find our troops ready to give when
properly led and disposed. His pains
are rewarded with a loss of not less than
5,000 killed and wounded, 1,000 prison
ers and thirty stands of colors. An al
most irreparable loss to Hood, is the
death of the celebrated Irish General
Pat Clebournc, whose corps has been
called the best fighting corps iu the re
bel arnly. Thus, by one movement,
foolhardy in its conception, has Hood
seen more than 6,000 of his veterans
iwept away. He waits now at the
gates of Nashville, where it is certainly
to be hoped that he will soon renew his
attack. Hood's army will never return
South an organized body. Our army is
sufficient for the work.
Salmon P. time. Cblff JiwtlM of the
RMI«« Supreme Court.
The President has done honor to him
self iu ljeeding the voice of the people,
who, believing spd confiding in the un
sullied honor and great legal acumen of
Salmon P. Chase, have asked that the
judicial mantle which once rested upon
a Jay and a Marshal, should now fall
upon him. TJiis appointment will give
satisfaction to every uiyal man in the
country as one evidently fit to be made.
Seated in the highest judicial position
kuown to our laws, Mr. Chase will be
found no haudfull of putty, to bo mold
ed and fashioned according to the opin
ions of others. Pure and incorruptible,
with moral courage to do right in spite
of frowns and curses, he will give a new
lustre to the ermine he puts on. We
hail th# appointment with pleasure,
because one of the earliest, truest, most
steadfast friends of Freedom in America
has been rewarded. Republics are not
ungrateful when truth and righteous
ness prevail among their people.

IOWA NEWS.
—Patrick Murphy, an unnaturalised
foreigner, voted at Cedar Falls. He was
afterwards drafted, and from the fact
that he had voted, he couldn't plead
alienage. So he had to don Uncle
•Sam's uniform. Good for lilm.
—There are but three Democratic dai
ly newspapers left in Iowa, viz: Du
hunue Herald, Davenport Democrat,
and Keokuk Constitution. The daily
papers of the Union stamp are as fol
lows Dubuque Timet, Davenport Ga
zeltt, Muscatine
JOUHXAL,
Iff., The New York Herald states the,
case of our National debt quite forcibly:
When we hear doubts expressed as to
our ability to carry on this war much
longer because of the heaviness of our
expenditure, it seems to us like a wilful
despairing. Our whole debt at the pres
ent tune is little over $2,000,000,000.—
England, with a territory no larger than
one of our States, owes $4,000,000,000,
jjust double the amount. We have a
dozen States equal to her in size, rich in
undeveloped resources, and with a pop
ulation willing to pay any amount of
taxes for the support of a Government
honestly administered.

The National Ranking system is proving to
be acceptable to the capitalists and to the peo
ple. On the 251.li of November five hundred and
eighty-four National Banks had been organiz
ed, a considerable number of which were con
versions from State Hanks. Changes from the
State system to the National system are rapid
ly taking place, aud it is hoped that very soon
there will be in the United Htates no bank of
issue not authorized by Congress, and 110 bank
note cliculat on not secured by tlieg veriiiuent.
That the government and the people will derive
general benefll from this change In the bank
ing systems of the country, can hardly be ques
tioned. The National system will create a reli
able and permanent influence in suppoit of the
national credit, and protect tluv people against
losses in the use of paper money. Whether 01
not any further legislation is advisable for the
suppressi 11 of State ltanl issues, it will be for
Congress, to determine. It seems quite clear
that the Treasury cannot be satisfactorily con

almost indispuusible, aud yet no appr..uch to su-^h
unaiiioiily is attainable unless some uderencu shall be
paid to the will of the majority, simply because it is the
will of th. majority. Inthis case the coinuioii end is
the maintenance of tho Union, and among he means to
se.-ure thai end,
such will, through tlie election, is most
clearly declared in favor of sudi constitutional amend

Judging by Ihe recent canvass and its results,
I! e pi.r.iose of the people within the loyul

wus never more lirm nor more nearly unani
mous than now. The extraordinary calmness
and good order with which the millions of vo
ters met and mingled at tho polls gave strong
assurance of tills. Not only al! those who sup
ported the I'niou ticket, so-called, but n great
majority of the opposing party also may be fair
ly claimed to be actuated by the ssiue purpose.
It is an unanswerable argument, that 110 candi
date for any oliice whatever, high or low, has
ventured to seek voles on the avowal that he
was for giving up the Union. There has been
much impugning of motives and much heated
controversy as to the proper means uud best
mooe of advancing the Union cause, but in the
distinct Issue of Union or uo Union, the politi
cians have shown their instinctive knowledge
that there is
110
diversity among tiie people. In
awarding the people the lair opportunity of
showing one to another, and to the world, this
firmness ahd unanimity of purpose, the election
uas been of vast value to the national cause.
The election has exhibited another fact,
11.it
less valuable to be known-the fact that.we do
not approach exhaustion in the most Important
branch of me national resources-that of living
men. While It io melancholy to roilect that,
tlie
war has fill, so many graves and caused
mourning to so ninny homes, it is some relief
to know that,

fallen have been so few. While corps and ill vi

COTTON PLANTATIONS AT TIIE SOUTH
—TIIK SYSTEM A FAILURE.—A writer
in the Vicksburg Herald declares that
the system of cotton cultivation by loyal
lessees, has proved a disastrous failure
that the Government, after inviting
Northern men to take tlie cotton lands
abandoned by traitors and work them,
has permitted tlie lessees to be victims
of rebel revenge and guerrilla barbarity,
until the system has proved a ruinous
experiment. He thinks the whole thing
has been wrongly managed from tiie
commencement, and that 110 civilian, on

WASHINGTON,
December
Gold rose twelve cents yesterday, for
110 other reason than this extraordinary
bill.
Mr. Cox, of Ohio, did not agree with
the gentleman, that this bill put up the
price of gold. He rather thought the
President has played the bull tiy his
message.
Mr. Stevens, in reply to Mr. Blair,
said the action he proposed had been ex
ercised by the most diatingui»lied
statesmen for several ages. There ought
to be some check put to gambling
where gold was put up to twice and a
half its real value. This couid not be
prevented unless by legislation. It is
just tlie legislation England adopted
during the great wars witi^Napoleon.—

Under this head the Washington
Chronicle, with significance, remarks:
By common consent it is now aumit
ted that slavery was the first cause of
the rebellion. Even the ultra pro
slavery men at the North yielded before
this stern fact when they saw that the
:'..Vithern
conspirators themselves ad­
mitted it. But ilu re is another truth
infinitely more significant. Thr Fed'1

colored people is now being adopted and.
enforced by the leaders of the rebellion.
In truth, liiey are themselves confess
ing their conversion to tiie extremist
and most ladical measures of the ultra
anti-shivery men of the North. It
would seem as if it was a race between

Both sides concur that slavery was tlu
author of the war, and both as'cordially
agree that slavery must be abolished.—

Advice.
The Democratic party has been totally
demolished because it would not follow
the advice we gave it in 1802. Tliu few
Democrats who have escaped the wreck
and are safe in the next Congress, wil
do well to lake a sensible hint, and vot
for the amendment to the Conslitutio
abolishing slavery. We have had trou
ble enough about slavery, and the Dem
ocrats have been beaten often enough in
their attempts to uphold this doomed
institution. Now let us all unite to get
it out of the way. and so clear the field
for new issues in 1808. If the Ijemo
erats in Congress persist in fighting the
pro-slavery battle over again, they can
only expect another defeat. It will be
better for them and the party to acqui
esce cheerfully iu what is inevitable.—
