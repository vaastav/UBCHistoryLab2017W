Bishop K F Sheets as to what z
the duty of Bishops In regard to
those who left or came into their
nards without recommends PreI
dcnt Cannon said as to the latter
I class that thiny should first L lu
Mieu ana requesteu to procuru their
certificates and then OI if they failed
to do it they should b reported to
the authorities of the wards from
which they came and if they were
unable to procure recommend hl
would adMfe that the renew their
covenants in the want where they
Uicn resided I they proved In
corngitilc he wouhi recommend
that they b fUpcnded from e
lowshlp or dealt with hi fuch a
manner as t impifss upon them
upn
the importance I of manifesting their
allegiance t the Church Jlu C
honed thu Bishops to trim up I
their wards and prune oil the dead
bronchus President Young used to
say to the Jibhops flat through
their rn to deal with trans
grc r In their wan they had
lost many souls that might hive
been saved Every member of the
Church owes it ns duty t take
w 1th him or her when they remove
to another ward a note of standing
and thus avoid confusion ml under
standing and trouble 1 they fail
to do I thujr shouU l dealt with
in a inter manner
lIII1 l CKOIU1E GODDAI
thought much of the trouble
complained of arose from the
fact that thin ward Teachers
failed to visit and instruct
lie icoi1e is thoroughly n they
should Tie Bishop was supposed
to know lit > members of his ward
and keep informed n to their condi
tion But how could ho know three
thing j thin Teachers were not
faithful in visiting the member
and fiithfully reporting their condi
tion In his opinion n fiithful corps
of Teichen could do more t correct
the evil complained of thin any
thing else
lnEI DJT cS0
coincided with the clew taken l > i
Brother Goddard and exhorted the
Teachers to renew etl diligence The
trouble was we were to much occupied
pied with our private affairs and not
interested enough in the things of
God When the Saints were driven
out of Xauvoo anti In tlC midst uf
PovertY and adverity they had
pleutj of time t servo God and the
brethren were as prj as crickets in
attending to their duties as Saints
but wealth and prosperity had
brought neglect and Motlifulnoa In
relation to such things rite lon
will stir us up if we continue In such
ways He can stnpusas individuals
as well is i community until we are
as naked n when we came into the
world and He may do it If we arc
not more faithful I And better would
it be if we might then have the fellowship
lowship of the heavens than to roll
J 1IhC 1 tU
In wealth and laxuryand lie with
out the favor of God
risnoiJOSKI n roLLAim
added a few words in relation to tho
duties Bishops and Teachers He
hid found it verj didlcult to get
len who would act thoroughly and
faithfully as Teacher One reason
was that the l > cst men hid to much
to do too many oftlces to hold to
many meetings t attend and they
could not be expected to h In five
or six places at once Most oC those
whose services could b had either
old not understand how to aet as
teachers or were unw illing t go at
I with their wholu hearts Brother
Goddinl had struck the keynote of
the dimcutty I wis the neetlof
good and tflicient teachers He believed

oaks like ii0 cross between Robert
Ingcroll and Prof Lewis with a
little of the weight of the much
rcsrecteJ Judge Wright to grace the
combination It is said tliat he is
a tornado iu debate placid as he ap
pears in the chair and has figur
atively made many of the members
feel his oratorical weight upon their
political corns
The members were next sworn
in in quads of about twenty at a
time the representatIves from the
new btatcs causing a ripple of ex
clement as they approached the
speakers desk The representa
tives from Arizona Idaho Wyom
ing and Utah formed a lonesome
looking quartette but the Hon
John T Calne was as graceful a
gentleman as any that appeared on
the floor He looked dignified
enough forasenator and I could not
help picturing In my mind Utah as
a State with some of our most able
citizens on the floors of both
Houses God sliced the day when
territorial vassalage shall ciau in
tho United States
It is believed that McKinley will
beappoiutcd chairman of trays and
means committee and Cannon ol
appropriations of which Hen
derson will boa member He is a
long beaded Scotchman and prefers
to be next to the funds as there is
more Influence In that capacity than
any In Congress as well as every
where she
Senator Fdmunds the favorite
In Utah was chairman Die com
mittee to watt upon Die President
and inform him of the organization
The country will doubtless have
been tclegnpliically submerged with
the Presidents message before this
retches you The republicans will
rromuncc it uiublimeSa while the
democrats will f peik of ltasatsoIoSa
When the republican majority was
shown ity the election of Mr Iteed
for Speaker there was a burst of
applause on lie left of tIme house
The democrats who were in tIme
majority last time did not look quite
enthusiastic butlthey accept Uie
situation hopes for Site future
based on tlie recent election in not
eral States showing democratic vic
tories almost unexpected
This cily Is swarmed with con
gressmen lawyer Iobbjl ts and
visitors with axes to grind on the
congressional stone Veterans with
limbless tleeMs and going on
crutches are as thick as lif > enl
colonists before an election
Changes in the pension laws are an
Ucinated and everybody who has
ever heard a gun go oil cx > eeU to
draw lacteal nutriment from the
breasts of the government during
the rust of his iiatunl life

nobody quibbled about the discrep

from the Iter Dr Bartlett of Ihe
New York Avenue Church He
gave us sonic oratorical touches

text was Today if jo

faculties in condition to receive the

the cover of sectarian oratory
Some portions of his discourse
were quite humorous ami elicited
smiles from the congregation
Imagine such sacrilege would
have horrified the Presbyternnsof
