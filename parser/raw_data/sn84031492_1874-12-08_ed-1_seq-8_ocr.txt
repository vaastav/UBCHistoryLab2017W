WITH SUPPLEMENT.
Tho message of Mayor Colvin, delivered
yesterday to tho now City Council, embraces
within Itself tho substance of the reports of
tho Comptroller and of tho various Boards
which manage tho several Departments of
tho City Government. We have not space this
morning to review it in detail.
Judge Tree's address to tho Grand Jury,
suggesting tho propriety of indicting tho city
authorities for maintaining a public nuisance
iu tho shape of a City-Hall, ought to meet tho
hearty concurrence of tax-payers. The build
ing on Adams street, in which tho city offices
and some of tho court-rooms now are, is not
only a disgrace, but a positive injury to tho
people of Chicago.
Mr. William Walter Phelps, tho young
Congressman from Now Jersey, has tlio credit
of first introducing n bill for tho, abolition of
tho press-gag. Ho proposes merely to striko
out tho section which includes newspapers
within the provisions of the judicial act,
leaving tho rest of it untouched. Mr. Phelps
was perhaps too forward iu presenting his
bill, but ho showed a good spirit. Ho has
given notice of a motion to pass the bill
under a suspension of tho rules next Monday.
Tho transit of Venus will occur this even
ing, beginning about 8 o'clock and ending
at 30 minutes past midnight. Wo do not
publish a mass of information concerning it,
fjr tho reason that none of our readers will
havo an opportunity of observing tbo phe
nomenon. It may, however, bo interesting
to remember that, os tho groat majority of tho
residents of tho Northwest aro going to bed
to-night, tbo great astronomical problem of
tho nineteenth century will bo in process of
Bolution.
Fernando Wood’s manner of working for
tbo Speakership of tho next House will com
mend itself, wo feel sure, to many of tho new
Democratic members. Mr. Wood assumes
that tho way to a statesman’s heart lies
through his belly, and ho has accordingly
spread a banquet for all tbo prominent Dem
ocrats in Washington, including tho members
of both Houses, to commemorate ibc recent
.successes of tho party. It is understood, of
course, that tho claims of so generous a
dost to the Speakership caunot ho despised.
Mr. Morrill's bill for tho reorganization of
tho District of Columbia Government, which
was introduced iu tho Souato yesterday, pro
vides for a Board of three Regents, to ho ap
pointed by tbo President mid confirmed by
tho Senate, which shall havo entire control of
District affairs. Tho people will bo allowed to
elect three momborsof tho Board of Education,
but beyond this they will havo no share in
tho City Government. Tho plan appears to
bo feasible and reasonable. At the worst it
' would bo a vast improvement ovor tho system
of Bolf-govormuont under Mr. Shepherd’s ad
ministration.
Tho City and County Governments were
partially reorganized yesterday, tho officers
oboaeu at tho Into oloction being installed.
In tho County Board, Commissioner Burdick,
on honest ami competent man, was rondo
President, defeating Mr. Crawford. Tho
election of Crawford would havo boon
a public misfortune. Aid. Dixon was
re-elected President of tho Common
Council by a unanimous vote. Ho has boon
a good presiding ollicer, and, it appears from
tho vote of last night, enjoys tho confidence
and esteem of bis colleagues in an unusual
degree. Wo do not know that a similar
compliment bos over been bestowed by tho
Oounoil.
Tho Chicago produce markets wore rather
slow yesterday except in provisions, and most
of them woro tinged with weakness. Mess
pork was active, and 15@200 per brl lower,
dosing at $10.65 cosh, and $20.1C@20.20
seller February. Lard was active, ami 10®
JlOo per 100 lbs lower, closing at $13,00
cash, and $13.06 for February. Moats wore
qniot ami cosier, at 0 0-to for shoulders,
i) l-2o for abort riba, and 0 for
short clears. IHghwincs wore in fair de
mand and steady at 070 per gallon. Dressed
hogs were qnlot and tinner, closing at s7.7fi(g)
8.00 per 100 U»s, Flour was dull and un
changed. Wheat was quiet ami l-2o lower,
closing at 81) J5-8o cash, and 00 3-8o for
.Tnnnmy. Com was rather more active and
turner, closing at 7fi 1.20 for old, (57 l-4o for
now, and 7Jlo seller May. Oats woro quiet
ami l-'lo higher, closing at fit l-10. Ilyo was
dull and easier, at 0.'5(5>!)Io. Barley was quiet,
and l(S)2e lower, closing at $1.2(5 cash, and
$1,27 1-1 for January. Hogs woro inactive
and weak. Limited sales at $0.C0@7.80.
Cattle wove dull and unchanged. Sheep woro
n demand lit firm rates.
In tho notable debate now progressing in
tho Gorman Parliament, in which tho Gov
ernment is resolutely defending itself against
tho Ultramontane attacks, Priuco Bismarck
has struck some sturdy and tolling blows.
His last one is very suggestive, and opens up
a possibility of some startling developments,
His announcement on Saturday last, first, that
tho Ecumenical Council was cut short on ac
count of tho Franco-Gonnau war, and that
tho Council’s votes would have boon very dif
ferent bad the French bcou victorious, and,
second, that Napoleon, after striving for peace
to tbo very last, was forced into war by the
inffnenco of tho Vatican, was evidently
thrown out for tbo purpose of having a
ohauco to develop some important testi
mony. It is not probable Bismarck would
have mado such an announcement without
knowing where bo stands. If tho Ultramou
tanes press the matter, therefore, thero is
every probability the fire will fly.
Tho cloplorablo conflict between negroes
ftml whites iu Vicksburg yesterday, partic
ulars of which are given in our news columns
this morning, arose from political differences.
Tho white people of Vicksburg lately mot in
mass-meeting and ordered tho resignation of
certain county officials, most of whom were
colored. It is said by tho Rojmblicnu corre
spondents that tboofficors donouuccdiumass
mooting were not merely requested to resign,
but threatened with assassination. Tho Dem
ocratic correspondents make no mention of
such throats. It is too soon, perhaps, to fix
responsibility for tho twenty or movo
lives which havo already been lost in
tho prosecution of this quarrel, and
for tho scandal and disrepute which it will
bring upon tho City of Vicksburg and tho
Southern whites generally. This much, how
ever, wo arc prepared to say at once; That
tho mass-mooting plan of dispossess
iug officers duly elected cannot bo,
and ‘ will not bo, tolerated by tho
National Government. It may bo true—the
dispatches from nil sources say it in—that
Gov, Amos has incited and assisted this negro
insurrection. If so, ho has been injudicious
and hasty; but ho has acted more within
bounds than those whites who forced tho col
ored officers to resign. Thoro wore legal
remedies for both sides which had not boon
exhausted.
TEE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho message of President Grant, rend yes
terday to Congress, is a most interesting
document. Of course tbo groat loading topic
is tho stato of tho finances, and to this tho
President addresses himself with clearness
and vigor. Tho opinions expressed by him
last spring havo evidently become a convic
tion 5 his earnestness is more than usual in a
Slato document, while his arguments aro
forcibly stated.
. The President, referring to tbo prostration
of business and industry which has occurred
during tho last year, calls attention to tho
fact tlmtr during this whole period tho
two essential elements of prosperity—
labor and capital—have been abundant, and
both havo been largely unemployed. Wherev
er security has been undoubted, capital has
been attainable at moderate rates ; and where
labor has boon wanted, it has boon abundant
at cheap rates. If to these bo added tho con
ditions of our soil and climate, ca
pacity of production, and our actual surplus
of predicts,.ho thinks wise statesmanship
should ignore tho past disturbance and ad
dress itself to tho future. With a sound cur
rency, a foreign dobt is tbo only element that
can seriously disturb or depress our industries
and prosperity. As a necessity of tho War, a
system of currency was devised which Ims
proved to bo impossible to keep at par with
tho recognized currency of tho world ; its
value being fluctuating, that currency became
unsafe to hold as nu investment, and hence
became a subject of speculation in itself.
Tho foreign indebtedness was a necessity
contracted in good faith, and should bo paid
iu gold or its equivalent. To pay this dobt re
quires that our commerce should her encour
aged, our shipbuilding ami currying capacity
increased, foreign markets sought for our
products and manufactures. Wherever a new
market for any of our productions is opened,
a now menus of utilizing our idle capital and
labor is found, bat tho first stop iu this
direction is to secure a currency good
wherever civilization reigns, and ono that will
flow wherever it is wonted. Ho thinks there
should bo no delay in fixing, by legislation,
tho mode of a return to specie payments, H6
declares that, iu his judgment, there can bo
no prosperous and permanent revival of busi
ness and industries until a policy is
adopted, with legislation to carry it out,
looking to a return to a specie basis.
A revival of productive Industries is
needed by all classes, and by nono moro
than tbo holders of property of every sort
with debts to liquidate from tho proceeds of
sales. Even tlio debtor and speculating
classes who may think it an advantage to
cheap money will, in tho end, be disap
pointed if tho value of tho logal-tondcr me
dium of exchanges bo always kept iu doubt.
Ho regards any expansion of permanent de
preciation of tho currency as littio bettor
than any other form of repudiating all debts,
public and private. Delay iu tho preparation
for final resumption partakes of thin dis
honesty. A season must at last arrive for
tho work of redeeming our pledges. That
season will never oomo, except by positive
action of Congress or by national disasters.
It must bo reached by general bankruptcy or
by maintaining tho credit and Integrity of
tho nation and of individuals.
Tho President believes it is possible for
Congress to doviso such legislation as will
start tho nation afresh on a career of prosperi
ty. A nation dealing in a currency below
that of Bpocio labors under tho disadvantage,
that having no uso for tho world's currency
the latter is driven out \ and that tho
currency in use being of fluctuating and mu
cortoiu voluo with only just what it will pur
chase of gold, a largo margin must bo left to
cover this fluctuation. Tho foreign producer,
subjected to no such uncertainty, is protected
in Ida dealings with as, and thus tho groat
THE CHICAGO DAILY TRIBUNE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1874-TWELVE PAGES.
hardship of doprocialcd currency falls upon
tho working and producing classes. The
plan proposed by thoFrosideut and tho Socro
tary of tho Treasury for resumption of specie
payments embraces ihp following measures :
1. Tho repeal of the Legal-Tender aot,
to take effect on a certain date, ami to
apply to all contracts mado after that date.
2. Tho Secretary of tho Treasury to bo au
thorized to sell bonds for gold as it may be
come necessary, and (ho establishment of a
revenue sufficiently in excess of expenditures
to insure an abundance of gold to sustain re
demption. 3. Free banking, allowing tho
utmost elasticity to llio currency in tho
transaction of business, lie regards it unsafe
to leave to Congress or to tho Executive to
lix tho amount of currency in circulation.
Tho banking monopoly should ccaso, and a
redeemable currency bo authorized to any
extent that business should demand.
This in brief in tho substance of tho Presi
dent’s argument and of his recommendation.
If wo understand it, it involves tho
ultimate withdrawal of tho greenback
currency, and its use by tho Government
ns a convenient means for refunding all tho
C-20 or other 0 per cent bonds in bonds at a
lower rate of interest. To do this will re
quire some time, but it will have tho effect of
ultimately severing tho Government from all
connection with currency malting. Tho bills
of tho National Panics being scoured by de
posits of bonds, their redemption will at all
times bo a certainty. Neither tho President
nor Secretary nomo any dato at which tho re
peal of tho Legal-Tender not should toko ef
fect. Tho whole tono of tho moasago is of
that character which cannot fail to have an
assuring effect upon tho national credit at
homo and abroad.
CONOID ERATIONS FOR CONGRESSMEN.
Tho Secretary of tho Treasury, in his ro
portou tho National Finances, speaks strongly
in favor of a return to specie payments. Ho
docs not treat tho matter indefinitely. Ho
proposes that tho Legal-Tender act bo re
pealed at a elate to bo fixed by Congress, and
that a date bo fixed for tho resumption of
specie payments, and that the Secretary bo
authorized to soli bonds from time to iimo
for tho redemption of greenbacks, Ho also
makes tho excellent recommendation that tho
greasy, ragged fractional currency bo recalled
and destroyed,' and silver issued iu its
place. Ho also recommends that tho coinngo
of gold bo made free to prevent tho exporta
tion of bullion. As part of tho general plan
for a return to specie payments he recom
mends free banking. •
In tho matter of internal rovonno ho ad
vises the removal of tho tax on bank
chocks, watches, cosmetics, and dings,
and that tho loss of revenue bo made
good by on increase of tho tax on whis
ky by tho addition of 10 cents a gallon.
Ho takes tho very clear ground that tho re
moval of tho tax on lea and coffco was a great
mistake, involving a loss of twenty millions of
revenue without the least benefit or relief to
tho public. Tho lax removed was simply
added to tho prico at tho placo of production
by an export tax, and by tho sellers. On tho
general question of tho tariff ho soys that,
at present, tho question is ono of revenue, not
of protection or free trade. Ho advises that
a commission bo appointed to consider and
report to tho next Congress.
Tho Secretary strongly recommends a dis
continuance of tho present system of elaborate
and costly public buildings, and advises Con
gress to scrutinize tho future appropriations
therefor. Millions of dollars can be saved iu
this particular. Ho reports that tho clerical
force of tho Treasury Department has been
reduced, ns provided by tlio last Congress, but
ho docs not think tho lowest limit of economy
has yet been reached.
Tho Secretary makes a statomentthatmeots
an important question now before Congress,
and that is tho granting of subsidies to indi
viduals and corporations. Ho declares that
tho present condition of the Government will
not justify any increase of tho public indebt
edness by extending gifts or bounties in any
form to private enterprises of any kind. In
this he will be heartily sustained by tbo hon
est part of tho country. There is nothing
whatever of justice or right iu tbo appeals to
tho Government by individuals and corpora
tions for gifts called “aid and relief.” That
Government is tho wisest and best which in
terferes tho least with tho industry of tho
people. So long as tho people aro left froo to
engage in whatever business thoir habits, or
experience, or means, may suggest, and tho
Government abstains from any obstruction
or hindrance thereof, either directly or in
directly, by bounties and gratuities to tho
few, tho industxy of tbo nation and its pro
duction will bo promoted. Tho Government
cannot discriminate in favor of ono produc
tion except at tho expense and to the injury
of all others. It cannot select ono branch of
production, and foster and encourage it by
bounties, save by an unjust taxation of all
others.
Tho United Slates Government has no in
come or revenue except what ia produced by
taxation. Every dollar expended by the Gov
ernment ia obtained by a tax which is paid by
the people. This tax is the withdrawal of
that much money from the active biieiuoas
capital of the people. A dollar paid in tax
satisfies a dollar of tho public debt, or
meets a dollar of public expenditure;
tho same dollar loft in tho bauds of the
public becomes an agent of production, and
may in tho course of a year be used to pro
duce equal to its own value two or throe
times over. There should, therefore, never
bo a dollar of public debt incurred, nor a
dollar expended, by tbo Administration save
for tho indispensable wants and necessities of
tho Government. All money taken from tho
people in excess of tho indispensable wants
of tho Government, is so much private prop
erty taken without just cause, and so much
token from tho moans of production.
Nor is this fundamental truth in tho least
ohauged when tho Government is asked
to expend tho revenue derived from
taxation for the purpose of giving employ
ment to labor on works in which private capi
tal cannot bo induced to invest. Thus,
private capital eon hardly bo induced to em
ploy labor in any work that is unproductive,
or which has no promise of being productive;
Employment of labor at that kind of work is
n waste of money,—an absolute destruction of
it. Ten thousand laborers might be om
' ployed continuously bailing out Lake Michi
gan, but at tho end of n year, or any num
ber of years, tbo hike would bo na it ia, and
nothing would como of tho expenditure. It
is not suilloiout to say that during those years
there wore 10,000 families supported by tho
wages paid to the laborers. Labor that does
not reproduce capital ia as valueless to tbo
country and to the community as If not em
ployed at all. If those 10,000 laborers
wore employed in converting leather
Into shoes, or day into bricks, or
wood into furniture, or iron into shovels, or
wool or ooUoa into cloth, there would at tho
ond of tho tinio bo tho 'wool, cotton, iron,
wood, clay, and leather, all increased in value
by tho coat of tho labor expended on thorn.
Tho country would have that much added to
its wealth. In addition to tho mipport of tho
ton thousand families, thoro would bo tho
produot.of their labor added to tho previous
value of tho raw material. Any expenditure
for any purpose save productive labor is n
waste, au improvident destruction of tho
people’s accumulation, as much so ns to pay
men for rolling stones up a hill that they
might bo rolled down ogam. Nor is
tho ease changed because tho proposed
expenditure is speculative, A pretty safe
tost of tho probable productiveness of any
enterprise is tbo willingness of private capital
to become invested in it. llailroads have
boon built on speculation; but in every case
the nominal coat of tho same has boon mostly
made up of money wasted, and which over
must remain lost and unprofitable. It is no
less a waste of money to expend it in build
ing railroads whore they are not wanted, or
through tho sandy desert or frozen wilder
ness, than to expend it digging holes and fill
ing them up again. Fifty millions of dol
lars may be expended in paying for la
bor for tho one work ns for tho
other, and with equal results. Tho United
Stales expended $01,000,000 on tho Pacific
railroads ; tho Companies expended an equal
amount of their own bouds; and there is in
addition perhaps a capital stock of $130,000,-
000. Tho United States have already paid
out more than $20,000,000 for interest on its
bonds, and by tho time the bonds mature will
have paid $01,000,000, making an aggregate
cost of the roads at that time of $200,000,000,
not including the laud donated. All of this
immense sum, contributed nud to bo contrib
uted by tho Government, was all wasted; is
not and never will bo productive, and, so far
an it was nu addition to tho national wealth,
might have been cast into the sea. All that
remains to show for it is uotmoro than equal
to thoinoney expended outside of tho Govern
ment subsidy. It gave employment for n timo
to labor, and supported a number of
families; but this $128,000,000 advanced and
to bo advanced by tho Government would
have done tho same had it been expended for
labor in pumping out the Atlantic Ocean.
Had that $128,000,000 boon loft with the peo
ple, to bo by them used in paying for labor
that produced something, tho families would
have boon supported just tho same, and tho
product of that labor would havo been added
to*tho national wealth.
Tho applications before Congress for sub
sidies to carry on private enterprises, so un
productive that private capital will
not toucli them, include tho building
of a railroad through tho sandy deserts
of Texas, Now Mexico, and Southern
Californio, and another though tho unin
habited wilderness of tho North. Specula
tive—'perhaps dishonest-contraction com
panies, which havo sunk and buried all tho
private capital they could inveigle into their
jobs, now appeal to Congress for subsidies
of fifty to a hundred millions of dollars each
to enable them to give employment to labor;
and Congress is asked to take that sum from
the hands of those who are using it produc
tively to sink and destroy it irretrievably.
They are asked to toko from tho man who is
using Ids money for labor in cultivating tho
laud, or in manufacturing, tho means
necessary to Lis business, to bury it in
Now Mexico or cdong tho boundary
of British Columbia. This money loft
with tho people will employ more labor
and support more families than if given
to these construction companies, and at tho
same time will produce dollar for dollar in
rapid succession, to tho benefit of tho wholo
peoplo and to the increase of tho general
wealth, Who is it in Congress representing
tho peoplo will vote to tax and confiscate thoir
property to havo it thrown away and de
stroyed in useless and unproductive specula
tions ?
TJIE LOUISIANA CASE.
Tho Executive officers of tho State of Lou
isiana aro at Washington urging Congressional
( action, with a view of having tho Kellogg
Government formally declared tho legal and
legitimate Government of that State. Tho
necessity for this action will become obvious
upon a simple review of the facts. At tho
timo of tho election of 1872 WarmotU was
Governor. All tho returns of tho election
of that year woro sent, in conformity with
law, to tho Secretary of Stoto, and were by
him transferred over to tho Board of Can
vassers organized by Warmoth. Judge Du
roll, in one of his orders, prohibited this
Board from declaring any canvass of tho re
turns, and ordered that no person should bo
admitted to tho Stato-llouso or protend to act
os a member of tho Legislature save such
persons as should bo declared elected by
the Lynch Board of Canvassers. Tho
Warmoth Board had all tho official returns,
and tho Lynch Board hud none. Tho Lynch
Board announced tho result of tho elections
without auy returns j as Mr. Lynch explained
in his testimony at Washington before tho
Scuato Committee, they made out their fig
ures “as they thought they ought to be."
Upon this canvass by tho Lynch Board,
Kellogg, and tho State officers, and tho Legis
lature, wero declared elected, and woro in
stalled in office under DurolTs orders. At
tho election in November, 187-i, tho Demo
crats elected a majority of tho House of llep
reuontativos in tho Legislature. In tho Sen
ate mutters are mixed and doubtful. Two
years ago ten Democratic Senators claim to
have been elected who wero counted
out by tho Lynch Board. Tho Legisla
ture moots in January, and the Dem
ocrats propose to first organize tho
Houso, and then that tho House should
only rocognizo a Senate in which these
ton Senators thrown out in 1872 are
admitted. This being douo, tho Senate will
also bo Democratic. All this being accom
plished, tho two Houses of Urn Legislature
ai*o to meet in convention and count and can
vass the official returns of tho election of State
and other ofllcors in 1872. This is made by
tho Constitution a part of tho duty of tho
Legislature; but tho Legislature of 1872 (tho
Lyuch-Kollogg) uovor had tho official returns,
and of course never could perform the duty.
Tho Warmoth Canvassing Board in 1872,
upon being enjoined by Judge Duroll, re
tained possession of all tho official returns of
tho election of 1872. ThoKcllogg Government
has tried every moans during tho last two
: years to recover possession of them,
but has uovor succeeded. Their place of
deposit has boon kept a secret, but
it Is supposed thoy havo boon hidden
in Louisville, Nashville, Baltimore, or else
where in the Bouth, —certainly outside of
Louisiana. When tho Domocratio Legis
lature wants them thoy will be forthcoming.
When the Doipocvallo Legislature canvasses
tho returns, of course it will appear that Me-
Euory was elected Governor in 1872, and not
Kellogg, and that all tho officers who have
boon serving for two yeard wero never
elected. Having declared this result, Hc-
Euory will bo recognized as Governor by tho
Legislature, and Kellogg will bo treated ns an
usurper, nud ousted.
In view of thin inevitable train of circum
stances, Kellogg’s friends aro appealing to
Congress to interfere in advance, and by some
measure]] recognize the Kellogg Government
as tho only legitimate Government of tho
State. Exactly how Congress in to do this,
wo do not know. In 1873, the House of Rep
resentatives admitted three members of Con
gress who wero elected with Kellogg. The
Kellogg Legislature elected Pinchbauk to the
Senate, but that body refused to admit him.
It is now proposed that the Senate shall ad
mit Flnchhaclc, and thus havo tho quasi rec
ognition by that body of tho legality of tho
Kellogg Legislature. No net of Congress,—
Uiot is to say, act of legislation,—is proposed.
Hero wo have a complication in which
Kellogg and his associates seek to involve tho
Republican party of tho country. Tho con
templated proceedings by tho Democrats of
tho Louisiana Legislature aro undoubtedly
flagitious, wholly indefensible, but are they
without precedent? How did tho Kellogg
Legislature act two years ago, when they in.
yoked tho judiciary and the Federal troops to
install themselves in power, and when tho
Legislature ejected everybody who was an
obstacle to their supremacy ? As we enid a
fow days ago, wo think tho Republicans, as a
party, havo earned Kellogg and his associates
long enough; they havo kept him in power
by forco for two ycors, against tho solemn
judgment of tho Investigating Committee of
Republican Senators that he was nu usurper.
Behind that judgment tho Republican party
cannot now go, particularly when tho pooplo
of tho’ Stnto have affirmed it by a lato voto
that is too decisive to bo questioned.
Ouo of two things should ho douo : either
order a now election for Governor, or lot tho
party which carried tho Into election govern
tho State, oven if Kellogg loses au office which
ho cannot hold an hour savo by tho aid of tho
Federal army and navy.
FINANCIAL FOLLY,
Tho Chicago 2'iincn gives editorial promi
nence to the following attempt at argument
in support of tho wildcat project to replace,
all the National Banknotes with greenbacks:
Tho more cuhMUution of United States notes for
bank notes would not uoreeanrily mean permanent ir
redeemability, nor would It ncccmrlly cnuco any de
predation whatever. Tho National Dink notes, over
since the first of them wsw lenued, Imvo circulated ou
tho credit of tho Qovormnout (7), and not at all ou tho
credit of the associations omitting them (I) . . Tho
value of tho circulating medium depends mainly on
tho work it does. Our currency would havo just tho
same work to do if It were all in the form of green
backs that It has now, when nearly half of It to in tho
form of bank notes, and It Is reasonable to conclude,
huroforo, that it would be worth Just as much, espe
cially ns tho prospect (1) of itsultlanlo convertibility
into coin would bojuatasgood.
At present tho United States, with an out
standing issue of $1)82,000,000 in greenbacks,
cannot meet its promises to pay, and shrinks
from naming any day, no matter how distant
when it will meet them. If it cannot re
deem $332,000,000, it will certainly bo far
less able to redeem $700,000,000, which
would be about the sum of its circulating
paper if the National Bank notes were re
placed with legal tenders. If a man staggers
under a weight of 200 pounds, ho will not
wall: more easily when that weight is
doubled. Tho reason that tho greenback
has any purchasing power is because
it is redeemed k in gold, not by its
maker, but by tho brokers of "Wall
street. They have bought it, since
its first issue, at a discount of from 9 to 60'
por cent, and tho amount of gold they have*
been willing to give for it has fixed its vnluri
from day to day, Tho improvement of thu
prospect of ultimate and not distant redemp -
tion has induced tho gold-brokers topaymon 3
for those unredeemed notes each year. Am/
policy or measure which looks to postponing
tho day of redemption must necessarily d< i
prcciato their purchasing power. Any mala
rial increase of tho quantity of those nob is
must diminish tho iirospoot of redcmptioi j,
and cause tho gold-brokers to pay less for
them, and consequently depreciate tho u*
value.
To double tho issue of an irredeemable ct'T
roucy must necessarily weaken tho probabil
ity of redemption, and therefore cause dopi ,*o
ciutiou, no it would produce a belief in p< ,‘r
manout irredeemability, which in fact is
equivalent to repudiation. Henco to substi
tute irredeemable United States notes for tho
bank notes would necessarily result in gri mt
depreciation.
Tho Times' third fallacy is, that tho na
tional Bank notes havo circulated wholly on
the credit of tho Government, and not at all
on the credit of tho banks, These notes are
scoured, first, by an United States gold bond
of SIOO for every S9O of bills in circulatl on;
and, second, by tho credit of tho banks. Of
what does this credit consist? It consist 3 of
tho surplus funds of tho banks, of their real
estate, of tho individual liability of tho si iaro
holdors over and above tho amount of ; their
stock, and of tho collaterals hold in sect irity
for loans. These collaterals represent, tho
cattle, horses, and hogs in transitu to mar
ket, the stocks of unsold* merchandise and
manufactures, tho cargoes of vessels on imaged
in inland and oulland trade, tho grnin in
storage and in transitu, and a good part of tho
enormous mnssof property represented by tho
shores of American corporations. Th e bank
notes circulate, then, indirectly on tho, credit
of tho United States as represented 'by tho
bonds on deposit at Washington, and < Urectly
on tho credit of tho banks ns represented by
tho tremendous aggregate of wealth vro havo
catalogued. Substituting groonbaaia for
bank-notes would deprive $8.% , ,000 11 000 of
the national circulating medium of th o credit
It now derives, not only from aboul; $ 100,-
000,000 in United States bonds, but from all
tho other property hold by or pledged to tho
National Banks, amounting probably to
$1,200,000,000. Tho $950,000,000 would bo
no longer based on tangible wealth, but on
that airy nothing known ns “tho faith and
resources of tho country,’’—the shibboleth of
tho believers in irredeemable rags. So much
for fallacy number throe.
Number four can bo answered in a few
words. Tho JTmmj assorts that th e currency
it advocates would bo worth ns much as it is
now, because “it would havo jnst tho same
work to do " 1 It follows from tins wondrous
plea that ns long ns a currency has a certain
amount of exchanges to d£Toat, one sort is ns
good as another. Bits of blank brown popor,
then, would mako as good a currency as gold
nnywhoro, because thoy “would havo just
the same work to do.” Tho force of folly
can no further go.
If Congress should enact that National
Bank notes after a given day shall cease to bo
redeemable in greenbacks, tho consequence
would bo that thoy would bound up to the
value of the world’s currency—gold, be
cause only in that medium oovdd thoy bo re
deemed. It la the groonbnoko that keep down
tho valUfc of Uio National ftiuils botes to 88 or
00 per cent of wlmi they ought to bo. Tbo
capital, orodit, and collaterals aro sufficient to
maintai u tboir notes at par of gold if they
wore o uly cut loose from tho cload carcass
of irredeemable Government sbiuplasters.

Tho Legislature of Indiana has to elect a
''Stato Agent, who goes to Now York from timo
to timo in order to pay interest on tho Stato
debt; a Stato librarian, whd makes a num
ber of neat commissions on tho books, ola
tionory, oto., which he buys for tho Legisla
ture and tho Library; tho Boards of tho
Stato Charities, and a miscellaneous lot of
clerks, sergeants-ot-arms, doorkeepers, etc.
Tho men who havo boon clamoring for Civil-
Service Reform now propose to eject all tho
present occupants of theso places and elect a
now sot, every ono of whom must bo a rock
rooted, dyod-lu-tho-wool, Bourbon-flavored
Democrat. It is not easy to see why a man
is incnpablo of paying out Stato funds to the
holders of Stato bonds bccaiiso ho believes in
National sovereignty, and rejects tho dogma
of Slate sovereignty with tho right of
secession which that implies. Tho Librarian
might possess iho skill needed for buying
books, paper, pons, and ink without having
tho ability to subscribe to tbo iron-bound*
creed of Democracy. A man’s power to
manage a prison or an asylum docs not ncc~
ossarlly depend upon his power to show that
ho voted a certain ticket on tho lost election
day. Tho olorks could probably read and tho
doorkeepers could probably open and shut
doors as well if they did not cast off tbclr Re
publicanism. If tho Democracy of Indiana
wore oven semi-Bincoro in their professions of
reform they would not show this indecent
haste to turn worthy and capable men out of
minor offices in order to fill tho places left
vacant with men whoso chief claim certainly,
and whoso solo claim possibly, is that they
aro Democrats. Nor would tho party, if it
were sincerely desirous of reform, proclaim
its purpose of practically depriving a largo
port of tho people of Indiana of their rights
by gerrymandering tbo Stato.
This is Democratic reform f
DUE DELATIONS WITH SPAIN.
The strong language on tho condition of
Cuba which tho President uses in his mes
sage can scorcoly fail to make our Spanish re
lations tho subject of tho most earnest con
sideration at the present session of Congress.
Spain has herself furnished our Government
with an opportunity to revise those relations,'
and insist upon n treaty that shall protect us
from tho outrageous discriminations put upon
u n in our trade with Cuba and Porto lUco.
For moro than a year tho Spanish Govern
ment has trilled with us about tho indemnifi
cation justly fixed for tho infamous slaugh
ter of American citizens under tho orders of
a Spanish butcher in Cuba. It is time that
tho United States should abandon for
bearance, and insist, in no doubtful
terms, nob only upon our rights in this
specific case, but upon fair and equitable con
cessions in tho commercial relations between
tho two countries. "Wo havo hold aloof for
several years, silent spectators of tho persist
ent desolation of one of tho fairest islands on
earth through a system of barbarous cruelty
and infamous extortion on tho ono hand, and
a desperate resolution on tho other, which tho k
Spanish Government has shown itself power
less to put down. Wo havo tacitly sanctioned,
by a policy of nou-iutorforouco, a series of
barbarities that havo called for international
protest on tho ground of common humanity.
Tho effect of this policy has simply been to
encourage oppression and extortion on tho
part of Spain, sustain tho last-surviving relic
of human slavery on tbo Continent, and per
mit tho most outrageous discrimination against
tho trado of this country.
No better idea of ilia commercial injury
put upon tho American people by the Spanish
Government can be obtained than from a
comparison of tho export. I ', and imports of this
country to and from Cuba and Porto lUco.
Tho figures for 16711, tho latest at hand, aro
as follows:
Imports from Fxjwrtn h
i’orlo Rico,
7,055,8U1
Totals irf3,453,057 S17,1!1'(?,B50
Balance of tmlo against uo SuiVJ3H,iU7
Our principal importa from thcso islands
are sugar, molasses, coffee, fruit, cigars, nud
tobacco. Tho groat staple, of course, is
sugar, which we import perhaps to the ox
tout of three-fourths tho entire value
of all wo toko from Cuba nml Porto
Itico. Wo aro prepared to furnish Cuba
and Porto lilco with tho commodities which
they have to import from abroad,—mainly
breadstuff's and machinery,—and, boingncorer
ilmu any other country which could moot
their wauls, wo could, other things being
equal, furnish tho needed commodities
cheaper than they could be obtained oho
whore. Yet wo llnd that in 1873 wo actually
bought from these islands over miy-eiyhi
millions movotbon wo sold them, — an amount
equal to the entire production of yoUi in the
United States per annum. 'Phis baltmoo
against ns baa boon rendered possible by the
opporiunities given to Spain In former tmtiu
to indulge her national rapacity to tbo fallen
extent, Spain lives upon her possessions in
tbo IVest Indies. She exacts mainly from
Cuba and Porto Ilico tbo expenses of the
Homo Government, of tbo internecine wars
sbo bas constantly on band, and of
tbo hordes of scalawags and lonfora
whom sbo exports to these islands after they
have become too vile and idle oven to live ill
Spain. To do tills Spain baa imposed tbo
most exorbitant duties upon exports and im
ports in tbo islands, and, by reason of tbo
especial advantage sbo bas bad over tbo
United States Government, lias bled out
country, not only for her own benefit, but to
tbo great benefit of tlioso countries which
bavo refused to submit to her exactions.
Hour, meal, salt moat, butter, and cheese
wo could have supplied to Cuba and Porto
Kico, in any amount tboy could bavo con
sumed, and at a much lower prica than tboy
could bavo obtained it from Spain or any
other country, has frequently bad to boor so
largo an Import tax in Cuba, that it was
cheaper to send a barrel of flour from Now
dork to Cadis, in Spain, and there, after pay
ing tbo Spanish duty, transship to Havana,
than to ship it direct from New York to tbo
island. So persistent and conscienceless ban
Spain shown herself in all her dcalingn
with tho United States, that, when Congress
put coffee on. tbo tree list and reduced tho
tax on sugar and molasses, Spafnimmodiatoly
put an export duty upon those staples in
Cuba equal to tbo entire reduction in tba
United States. In Ibis way wo lost at least
520,01)0,000 of revenue, only to pay an equal
amount to Spain. Tbo details of those dis
criminating duties would reveal a most mi
blushing system of unfairness and extortion •,
but tbo wbolo may bo readily comprehended
in tbo general assertion that wo are forced to
pay Cuba and Porto Eico noerly seventy
millions in gold per annum which wo could
pay off in our products of tho field and work
shop if it wore not for Spain’s rapacious is
crimination against us.
The •whole Spanish question will be forced
upon Congress nfe an early day through Iho
Virginins affair. This opens up the entire
situation. Tho seizure of the Virginias and
tho massacre of her crow wore tho direct re
sults of tho borbnrous policy of Spain toward
Cuba. It is this systematic oppression and
cruelty which is tho cause of tho rebellion of
the Cuban patriots, and also of tho aoti'vo
sympathy felt for thorn by honest people in
nil parts of tho globo. It is humiliating to
fcol that wo aro contributing seventy millions
ayoar in gold to sustain slavery, to beep down
a people that have earned their freedom,
and to mate a comparatively small
island, thousands of miles distant from
Spain, pay tho bulk of tho espemoa
of tho Homo Government. It is not possible
to separate this phase of tho question from
tho other. So long as Spain sanctions cruel
ties that would have disgraced the dork ages;
so long as she insists upon retaining the odi
ous system of human slavery ; and so long
as she persistently makes the people of tho
United States contribute so enormously to
the support of her oppression and cruelty,
there will bo a disposition to famish tho Cu
bans with sympathy and succor. And when
Spain fails to atone fop tho barbarities which
she practices upon tho citizens of tho United
States, tho opportunity is a fair one for taking
tho whole question into consideration, andfor
demanding a guarantee of fair commercial
dealing from a nation that will not otherwise
observe the moralities and decencies of inter
national intercourse. Tho President has nefc
gone any too far when ho declares that tho
interests of humanity and civilization demand
that tho Cuban question bo settled, and wo
hopo that Congress will havo tho courage to
meet tho wholo question in a manner becom
ing our dignity as a nation, and equal to
the commercial abuses as well as the personal
outrages wo havo suffered at tho hands of
Spain.
'Wo have tbo positive assurance that the gen
tlomou who aro nsldug for tbo right-of-way on
Wabash avouuo to lay a horse-railroad track do
not ask tbo franchise for tbo purpose of Belling
out to the Chicago City Hallway Company, but
for tho purpose of laying tho track within tho
time proscribed by tho ordinance,—that is, with
in eight mouths from Lako street to Twenty
second street, and within twoivo mouths
to tho city limits. So far, this Is all woll
and good; If tho people, or a major
ity of tho people, on Wabash avenue do*
biro a horse-railway, and tho Common Council
aro satisfied of this, then it Is right they should
have ono. Bab tho franchise is worth something
more than tho proposed ordinance prescribes.
It is not sufficient that the Company should keep
their own 1C foot in repair; they should likewise
bo required to keep tho rest of the street in re
pair. Tho fact that tho rest of tho street is ths
more speedily worn out by tho existence of th«
horse-railway, and also tho fact that thopeopl*
codo tho Company a valuable franchise, rondei
this demand entirely reasonable. It would bo
well, also, to demand that every car should bs
run through to tho city limits and ho provided
with a conductor. If thoso conditions should be
added to tboso already provided in tho ordinance,
there would bo something like a fair compensa
tion for tho franchise. An agreement to keep
tho entire street in repair would rocomollo many
people to tbo project who are now opposed to it.
