- London, Dec. 10- The Bulgarians, j
heavily reinforced and well supported '
by artillery, are violently renewing
their attacks on the ' Anglo-French
armies in Macedonia. The assault is.
approaching its climax. The pursuit
of the retreating Serbians still con
tinues. It is apparent, though, that
the greater portion of the Bulgarian
army has been diverted and is operat
ing against the Allies.
The outcome of this battle is await
ed with the greatest anxiety here. It
will determine to a great measure the
immediate future of the of the entente '
powers in tin Balkans. The numeri-
cal superiority of the Bulgarians is
demonstrated in the initial encounters.
Grave doubt3 are expressed of the
ability of the British to repel the at
tack. There is no indication, however,
that the British or French have found
it necessary to withdraw further than
the positions mentioned in the last of
ficial report.
The French wedge into Macedonia
in threatened from both sides. The
Allies' retreat was accomplished in an
orderly manner, without serious loss.
The., Montenegrin resistance, is stub
bora. The plight of the Serbians in
Albania is growing lass serious.
FIGHTING ON OTHER FRONTS
Hard fighting continues on the
western front. The Germans , have
been driven out f several positions.
No jmportant developments are re
ported .from other fronts. '
The Turks continue their attacks
on the British positions in Mesopo
tamia and it is reported that a Turk
ish expedition is beginning a cam
paign in Arabia against Aden and the
Red Sea vicinity.
Activity on Gallipoli is confined to
artillery actions. The French are busy
in the Champaign trying to recapture
the trenches recently taken by the
Germans. Despite the bad weather
the Italians report minor successes on
the Isonzo front.

INSISTS THAT AMERICA CHAMPION All NEUTRALS AGIST
- THE ALLIES
(Associated Press)
Washington, Dec. 10. Hoke Smith
of Georgia, is a vigorous speech in
the Senate this morning called upon
Congress to insist that the British
cease interfering with neutral com
merce. He quoted the state depart
ment's protest against orders in coun
cil in wrh:ch 1 the United .States as
sumes the task of championing neu
tral rights and declared it is not up
to Congress to determine what value
it may be to the integrity of neutral
rights for the United States to be
come their champion. He denied the
right of belligerents to interfere with
neutral commerce because the goods
came from or would eventually reach
the enemy. He quoted many decis
ions to prove his contentions.

: "PM AS YOU HIDE'
LOCAL MAXWELL AGENT AN
NOUNCES THE DEFERRED
PAYMENT PLAN
THE IDEA IS LOGICAL
Similar to that Employed with Pianos,
Real Estate and Various Other
Property Sales
Acting on the sound principle that
automobiles can and will eventually
je generally sold on the same basis .
as pianos, real estate and other com
modities of value, Mr. R. R. Carroll,
local Maxwell representative, an
nounces in this issue a time-payment
plan by which the prospective motor
ists cf this city and vicinity can se
cure Maxwell cars without any ap
preciable encroachment on their finan
cial resources and. investments.
"Pay as You Ride" is the cenciaa
way in which Mr. Carroll summarizes
the details of the plan.
"Modern conditions often demand
that a man make use of his entire
capital in hi3 business or in hi3 prcH
fessional equipment," declares Mr.
Carroll. "Often, even the relatively
small amount needed to pay the cash
down price of even a Maxwell automo
bile is large enough to keep him from
taking his money from the channels ia
which it is at work.
"The automobile business must
recognize this condition. I have work
ed out a plan which I am putting into
effect here, for the benefit of my cus
tomers who may be so situated. '
"This plan enables the man of aver
age means to buy a car and enjoy it
while he is paying for it, and enables
him, as well, to pay for it out of his
regular income. Thi3 plan I am put
t:ng at work now. It will be eligible
in the case of every car I can sectirs
fro mthe Maxwell Detroit factory,
and my schedule calls for more Max
well cars than have ever been deliver
ed here in any cold weather "month.
At present I can make immediate de
livery under this 'Pay as you Fvida'
plan." " . '
The experiment is being explains
I t buyers frankly and without reserve
and the local agent is being interview-
led daily by interested motorists.
