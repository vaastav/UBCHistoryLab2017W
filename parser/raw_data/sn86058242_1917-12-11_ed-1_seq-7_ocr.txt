CRAIG SAYS FARMERS
ARE MALIGNED
(By Vnjted Tress.
CHICAGO. Dec. 11. The retail price
of milk In Chicago will be based on
the cost of production, to which will
be added "reasonable profit," it was
intimated this afternoon at the Fed
eral milk investigation.
This appeared likely following re
ceipt of a report of a similar Federal
inquiry in New England.
S. J. Craig, agriculture advisor of
t-ake county, Indiana, testified today
that the farmer is much maligned as
a profiter.
"The majority of the farmers have
obligations to meet when their crops
come in. and they sell them to meet I
these obligations." said Craig.
"About P0 per cnt of the corn crop j
was sold in our county for less than i
one dollar a busthel cmf cmfwmfwyp
one dollar a bushel most of it for 75
cents a bushel. The $2.;i) and $2.60 said
to hav received represents the price
the speculator received."
