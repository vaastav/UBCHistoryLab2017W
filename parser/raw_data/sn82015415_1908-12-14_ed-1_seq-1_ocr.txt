WASHINGTON, D. C, November a treaty has been agreed to by the
30. (Special.) Behind a. formal ex- United States. It was originally sug-
change of diplomatic notes setting
forth tho attitude of Japan and the
United States in regard to the eastern
situation there Is an extremely Inter-

The story -which Is behind
this

JAPANESE
VISON AND WIFE ARRESTED AS PRINCIPALS WARRANTS FOR OTH
ERS TO FOLLOW QUICKLY DUPES GIVE INFORMATION. AGAINST
THE ISOIS-U. S. DISTRICT ATTORNEY BRECKONS AFTER IN
VESTIGATION PRESENTS MATTER TO GRAND JURY.
The arrest of Isol and his -wife,
Chise, charged with Importing women
from Japan for immoral purposes-, took
place this morning and three other
warrants are out for other members
of what appears to be a well organ
ized gang whoso living was made
through the "slave traffic." While
the entire plot has not yet been un
covered It looks Yery much as though
this was but first exposure of cases
which will lead to wholesale arrests
and mean many cases before the Fed
eral Court.
The charges against Isol, his wife
and the three others, come through
tho discovery of two women who have
been in this country for less than a
year who have practiced prostitution
in Hilo. One is a girl but nineteen
years of age, and very good looking
for her class. She was brought here
unmarried and the usual hasty mar
riage ceremony was performed at the
local immigrant station, the husband
Immediately disappearing. She states
that Isol and his wife urged her to
take up a life of prostitution, saying
that she could make much more mo
ney and that the life would be a very
much easier one than that on a sugar
plantation.
She was sent to Hilo shortly after
and states that through, her life of 111
fame she earned well over $200, all of
which went to her employer, how-

ever. She came back to this city
month ago and is believed to have
been living a life of prostitution here.
The other case Is similar in almost
all its details and It looks very much
as. though many other like acts on
the part of Isol and his clique would
lie unearthed. Both cases have been
under investigation by U. S. District
Attorney Breckons for some time past
and little by little the needed evidence
has been obtained. The matters were
brought to the attention of tho Fed
eral Grand Jury this morning and tho
arrests quickly followed. Isol and
Chise were quickly caught and were
released a little later by U. S. Com
missioner Kingsbury on bonds in tho
sum of $1000 apiece. The bonds wore
given by Y. Anin and Kawamoda.

Then the Sheriff went on to refer
to what he considered a queer action
this morning when I three Chinese,
charged with maintaining a disorder

quled In the police court.
It Is all about the now famous Bc-

made that some of tho police wero
bribed In this matter.
"I have Investigated," said tho
Sheriff today, "and I havo not been
able to find any sign of graft. I think
It is a put-up Job to discredit tho ad

FRANCISCO ARMY TRANSPORT SERVICE ON ACCOUNT OF GREAT
FREIGHT AND PASSENGER TRAFFIC RESULTING FROM THE
MILITARY ACTIVITIES HERE.
When the United States Army
transport Buford, now In port from San
Francisco, returns to the United States
mainland from her present trip to the
Philippines, she will spend a couple of
months on the shelf, during which time
certain alterations will be made, and,
after that, when next sho puts to sea
it will bo to establish a local transport
service, and she will run regularly be
tween Honolulu and San Francisco,
back and forth.
The Importance of Honolulu as a
military port necessitates this arrange
ment on the part of the army transport
service.
Tho establishment here of fortifica
tions and the stationing here of troops
whoso numbers will soon bo largely
Increased, call for the regular run be
tween this port and San Francisco of
an army transport and tho Buford,
being in many ways better than others
for -the local service, Is the vessel de
signed for the new run.

engineers there making the surveys
and maps. The various, properties are

a large Army passenger travel between
the ports, employes of the. Engineers'
Department, cavalrymen, Infantry,
gunners, mechanics, officers and on
listed men of the servlco having to
pass between San Francisco and Ho
nolulu. While the presence of an Army
transport in regular service between
here and the coast will mean some
what less freight and passenger busi
ness for tho steamship companies, it
is for tho sake of economy and bo
cause this freight and passenger traf
fic will bo a regular thing that tho Bu
