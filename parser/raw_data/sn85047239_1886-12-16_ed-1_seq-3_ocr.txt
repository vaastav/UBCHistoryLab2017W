Danger in Nostrums
Mr Hutchinson an eminent Lon
don physician has recently called atten
tion to the fact that a vast deal of
harm is being done by the use of pa
tent medicine containing phosphorus
The doctor reports a case in which a
woman tiok daily doses of a certain
popular phosphorus pill for two years
for the relief of a real or fancied dis
ease of the brain At the end of that
time she was found to be suffering
with disease of the bone of the lower
jaw and it was necessary to remove a
considerable portion of the jaw Whether
the disease ot the brain was cured or
not was not stated This is but one
illustration in thousands which might
be given that show in the clearest
manner possible the folly and the
danger ol indulging in the pastime of
swallowing patent medicines
The Air Bath
The air has p very soothing effect
upon the body when allowed to come
in contact with the entire surface It
answers a very valuable purpose when
a water bath is impossible or when the
patient is too fecblcto endure the ap
plication of water A sleepless person
will often fall into a sound and refresh
ing slumber after walking a few min
utes in his room with the whole body
exnosed to the air The effects of
night labor upon literary people may
be partially counter balanced by the
air bath Benjamin Franklin was
accustomed to pursue his writing to a
late hour after divesting himself of his
clothing and he recommended the
practice to others compelled to labor
late with the pen
It is never too late to give due credit
for public services and it is through
oversight that this paper has not hither

Companys building got water early on

Prison reform is booming judging
from the sight of a prisoner walking
back to jail on King street last evening
with a newspaper in his hands which

preference for the Ikkald

home rule in Ireland all his life says

TLIE TREATY
President Cleveland Recommends a
Seven Years Extension of the
Hnwnllan Treaty
In his annual message to Congress
President Cleveland refers as follows to
the treaty with Hawaii
I express my unhesitating conviction
that the intimacy of our relations with
Hawaii should be emphasized As a
result of the Reciprocity Treaty of
1875 those Islands on the highway of
Oriental and Australian traffic arc
virtually an outpost of American com
merce and a stepping stone to the
growing trade of the Pacific The
Polynesian Island groups have been so
absorbed by other and more powerful
governments that the Hawaiian Islands
arc left almost alone in the enjoyment
of their autonomy which it is im
portant for us should be preserved
Our treaty is now terminable on one
years notice but propositions to abro
gate it will in my judgment be ill ad
vised The paramount influence we
have there acquired once relinguished
could only with difficulty be regained
and a valuable coien of vantacc for
ourselves might be converted into a
stronghold for our commercial competi
tors I earnestly recommend that the
existing treaty stipuhtions be extended
for a further term of seven years A
recently signed treaty to this end is
now before the Senate The import
ance of telegraphic communication be
tween those Islands and the United
States should not be overlooked
SAN FRANCISCO TRUSS COMMENTS
The Alta
says
The
message ex
plicitly advises the renewal of the Ha
waiian treaty backing the recommend
ation with reasoning based in interna
tional interests which arc unanswerable
This will greatly please the commercial
and shipping and lumber interests of
this coast which have in a few years
brought the Hawaiian trade to aclose
second with that of Japan
The Chronicle has this snarl Mr
Cleveland indulges in a good deal of
stale nonsense regarding the Sandwich
Islands styling them the outposts
and stepping stones of our commerce
in the Pacific Ocean and urges the
formal extension of the Reciprocity
agreement for a term of seven years

To the Editor of the Herald
DEAR Sir Tht beautiful cake with other
delicacies that Mr Horn so generously do
nated to the Priory fair last Saturday week
was sold for the sum of f 1 being subscribed
for by twelve citizens at a dollar each who
each took their share away with them It was
not cut up by Hart of th Elite Ice Cream
Parlor and distributed to the Reformatory
school boys as is said to have been stated by
the said Hart
A prominent Judges lady undertook the
disposal of the cake and two gentlemen who
ncre subscribers cut it up and handed it
undur the ladys direction to the remaining
contributors
Every one was well satisfied with Mr
Horns skill and handiwork and the cake was
all that could be wished for and well worth
the money subscribed for it
I am yours etc

Dear Mu Horn In reply to your query
with regard to the handsome cake donated by
ou to the Priory fair yesterday week I have
to state that I was one of the gentlemen Mr
F L Clarke being the other who assisted in
cutting up and distributing the same to the
twelve subscribers of whom I was one
The cake was certainly not given to my
Reformatory School Band boys and whoever
says so is guilty of an untruth
H R II Princess Liktlike very kindly un
dertook to see that the boys were amply pro
vided with refreshments and they had ail
they wished for
The cake was not only a very handsome
one as a work of art but was exceedingly
tasty and delicious
You arejat liberty to make use of this in
any way you may think fit
I am dear sir yours etc
