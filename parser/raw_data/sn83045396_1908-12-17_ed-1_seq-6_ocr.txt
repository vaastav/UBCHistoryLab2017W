SOME FACTS OF THE PAST.
Tho Dcscrct Nows last night thought
it worth its "while to thresh out a lot
of old straw that has been threshed
Over and over, and reiterated some of
its old and thoroughly exploded false
hoods. Among these- is tho statement
that "tho" sO'Called 'American'" move
ment was conceived as a measure of re
venge because tho church authorities
refused to loud their aid to the further
ance of the plans of political schemers
eutiroly unfit; for the offices to which
they aspired. And it proceeds: "It
was founded on no higher principle than
that." Aa a matiov of fact, and as is
well known to tho News, as also to tho
genoral public, the American party was
founded in the- spring of 1904. upon the
basis of the dreadful revelations made
by Joseph F. Smith, president of the
Mormon church, wherein ho confessed
that he had violated his pledges of honor
to the Nation, had lived a lifo of law
lessness and licentiousness shocking to
every moral sense; and, to cap tho clim
ax, had stated under oath. to tho Sen
ate committee iu Washington that the
people of this community were so
"broad-minded''" that they condoned his
offenses.
The meetings roforrcd to were held iu
the Bamberger Hall, and a protest was
drawn up showing that there was no
condonation of President Joseph F.
Smith's awful offenses as ho confessed
to them, that the horrors he testified to
as his owu wcro not known hero until
ho revealed them; that, there was no
disposition to overlook his violation of
his pledges of honor, and that there was
not tho least willingness on the part
of tho peoplo of Salt Lake City to con
done his lawless and criminal life.
Those meetings resolved specifically to
form a political party to combat the
conditions revealed in the Smith testi
mony, and to enforce the law equally
against all offenders, as well as ro rem
edy tho wrong community and political
conditions so shamelessly testified to
by President Joseph F. Smith.
The fact that tho Amoricaa party
was not, in fact, organized iu pursuance
of tho determination arrived at iu the
meetings referred to until some months
later, cuts no figure in tho case. The
determination to organizo was arrived
at and carried by specific vole. Those
prominent in the Bamberger Hall meet
ings took like prominent part in tho or
ganization of tho American party, pre
cisely as thej' had engaged to do by
their vote some months before.
All this is well known to tho Doserct
News, although it has repeatedly mis
statod the facts and appears determined
to insist on the proposition that the
American pary was organized Through
political disappointments that, if they
occurred at all, occurred a good while
after the determination to organize the
party was arrived at. "W'e do not know
what the church organ expects to gain
by this continued misreprcFonlatiou.
Porhaps it continues on that liuc merely
in pursuance of its habitual mendacity
aud malevolence. But whatever its mo
tive, one thing is absolutely suro, aud
that is that its misrepresentation is !
vicious, false, and absolute, aud is well
known to be so by the Salt Lake public.
A ' REMARKABLE POSITION,
We do not understand why it is that
President Kooscvelt should call upon
Congress not to pursuo any investiga
tion iu the Panama caual matter- He
is no doubt houcsily convinced that no
investigation is necessary, and ho prob
ably feels that Congress, as well as
the public, should accept his statement
exonerating everybody, officially and
otherwise, in conncctiou with the so
called scaudals which aro supposed to
hover about some portions of the Isth
mian canal transactions.
The President's position was
strongly reinforced by the statements
of William Nelson Cromwell, which
were to the same purport as tho Presi
dent's protestation and insistence. And
so far all is well. Wo believe that tho
most of the people of this country are
thoroughly convinced that what the
President says is true, aud that there
was no scandal whatever iu conncctiou
with the purchase of the French rights,
or in any other matter. At the same
time, it must be remembered that there
have been a number of investigations
of charges in connection with the Pan
ama canal management, and specifically
it fchould be called to mind that tho
investigation which the late Senator
Morgan of Alabama was the head was
unfinished; this by reasou of tho alter
catiou between Senator Morgau and
Mr. Cromwell.
lu ail or nte mvcsugatios that uavc
been completed, the management of tho
canal work has beou exonerated. -Thcro
was au official exoneration in connec
tion with the Poultuey Bigelow charges,
which were very specific and direct, but
which it appeared were misdirected,
and either willfully'or unintentionally
false.
At tho same time, since Congress has
seen fit to take np the matter of an
investigation, wc consider it entirely
improper for the President to interpose
any objection. The nctiou of -Congress
is entirely independent of that of the
executive, and when tho President un
dertakes to say, as ho does in his mes
sage of Tuesday' last, that "thero is
nothing whatever in which this govern
ment is intoroatcd to investigate about
this transaction," it looks like an at
'tcmpt to-head oft Congress in its pur
pose to investigate. Aud wheu the
President further raps Mr. Cromwell
by saying that "thero was not the
slightest need for Mr. Cromwell to give
any information on tho subject of the
companies for which ho had been coun-
i
1 sel," tho President is more likely to
stimulate curiosity than to quell it.
This,, wo believe, is President ttooso
volt's third public appearance in ex
planation of the Panama canal ucgolia
tions and control, and in exculpation of
all connected therewith. Tf it were
anybody else than tho President, there
would bo apt to bo a suggestion that his
continued and heated pursuit of this do-
nial and protestation looks suspicion?,
and as if after all theic might be
something to cover up.
We can hardly imagine, howevor, that
Congroes will bo much influenced by
this mcssago of tho President virtually
asking it not to pursue its investiga
tion, and declaring that there is noth
ing to clenr up. The fact remains, in
spite of thft President's protcstatiou,
that thero havo been things proposed
for investigation. Those things are
probably untrue. At the same time, it
is qnile within the province of Con
gross to act for itself, and it would
clearly be advantageous to tho country
to havo Congress, after a full iuvestiga
tiou, receive and adopt a report that,
would bo in substantial accord with tho
repeated protestations of tho President.
Wc should then havo tho legislative
branch and tho executive branch iu
accord, both clearing up all the nego
tiations and the work of the Panama
canal, from every aspersion aud from
every taint of scandal.
JUGGLING- WITH THE "PLUM." .
The Tribune on Tuesday morning had
a local account of tho maimer in which
the County Commissioners, by secret
jugglery and avoidance of public, ac
tion, gave a largo gratuity to tho
Smoot "Mouth" by awarding it the
publication of the delinquent l,ax list
without competition. When The Trib
une reporter talked, to Mr. Mackay
about this, tho reporter was informed
that there was a record of the trans
action with tho County Clerk. Iuquiry
at the County Clerk's office found that
there was no record at all, except that
the two Commissioners then present had
I directed the Treasurer to print the de
linquent lax list in the Smoot "Mouth,"
nothing being said about the price;
nothing had been done by way of fol
lowing the practice long continued here
3-ear by year of inviting tho news
papers to bid on the publication of this
list. It was to all inteuts and pur
poses a secret award, a juic' plum
dropped iu the cavernous maw of that
organ.
Mr. Cosgriff, one of the Commission
ers, was not present when tho order
above referred to was made to tho
Treasurer. Mr. Mackay informed him,
however, that the "Mouth" had boen
given tho printing ou n bid of 50 cents
per inch'. That is rather au indefinite
proposition in tho way. that tho list is
printed, and, if there was any bid at
all. it was a bid uot in conformity with
law. The prieo to be paid for adver
tising these lists is not by tho Inch,
but by description. Section 2G22 .of
tho New Revised Statutes states that
the Treasurer "shall charge aud col
lect 25 cents for publishing tho name
and amount of taxes due on each piccei
of property sold," which is the maxi
mum rato which tho Treasurer is au
thorized to pay for the publication, aud
he is not authorized .to pay in any other"
way. It appears, therefore, that there
is something underhand and perhaps
illegal about this transaction, and that
Commissioner Mackay ondcavorcd to
mislead Commissioner Cosgriff as to
what had beou done.
On tho publicatiou iu Tucsdaj-'s Trib
une of the facts as fully as they could
be obtained from u surly, evasive, aud
deceptive Commissioner, the "Mouth"
breaks out into a torrent of abuse
against The Tribune, charging all sons
of falsehood with regard to tho publi
cation of legal notices from the city.
Wo do not care anything about that,
because The Tribune's bills for adver
tising the city work are accessible to
tho public, and any one who cares to
investigate will see that thcro has never
been any undue or improper chargo in
an' of them. Tho "Mouth" seems
to concede that The Tribune is enti
tled to this work, but it makes false
charges in connection therewith. It
claims that, the Republican officials
boing in charge of the county affairs,
and as it is the "Republican organ,"
it is entitled to this work. Well, it,
it is no entitled, why should there be
auy secrecy about it? Why should
there be any lyiug about.it? Why
should there be auy attempt on tho
part of oue Commissiouer to mislead
another as to the rato of pay? The
secrecy aud attoinpt to falsify and mis
lead was what caused suspicion that
something was wrong.
The advertising of this list hereto
fore has been costing along about 12
cents a description; this on bids sub
mitted bv the various notvsnaner;? ivliie.li
cared to bid. Tho Smoot "Mouth"
gets the list this year without any com
petition, morely as a partisan plum, aud
will probably get something more than
double tho usual price paid for that
publication. The public will bo
wronged, therefore, out of somethiug
like .$2000 on this account. That is,
a partisan board takes that money out
of the people's pockets and gives it,
as a subsidy, to its party organ, which
docs not seem able to maintaiu itself
on business principles. If the Com
missioners had fairly and squarely, and
publicly instructed the Treasurer to
priut this list in tho "Mouth" at legal
I rates, as they might openly havo done,
then there would havo been no occa
sion to mislead, deny, or indulge in
any tee-ret manipulations; nor to imply
that a different rate had been agreed
upon thau the rato speciGod in the law.
The "Mouth" is even a poorer success
ijs a pap-sucker thau it is as a blatant
fiowlcr against tho publicatiou of legal
notices in other newspapers. But it
will get the $2000 subsidy out of the
public, just the same, by the partisan
favor of a partisan board. And that
is somothing which it can neither deny
nor wipeout
WARNING TO THE PUBLIC.
Tho opposition newspapers hero are
very fond of a certain form of false
hood and malicious lying that wo do uot
remember to havo seeu practiced else
where. What we refer to is the fre
queut statements in the church organ
and its morning echo, and copied iu
various newspapers throughout tho
State, that The Tribune has said thus
and fo. This sort of thing is going on
all the time in tho column;) of that
weakling "Mouth" and also in tho col
umns of the church organ, which never
dares print fairly auythiug thai The
Tribune says, but always gives its owu
distorted or scrappy version of our ex
pressions. We, therefore, give this warning to
all concerned, that they arc not to be
lieve any representations in any other
nowspnpor, especially in any of the
church-controlled shoots, as to what ap
pears in Tho Tribune. Tho perversions
of tho church press hero aro cither
copied or followed by many of the coun
try press also, to tho shamo of those who
do it. The Tribune speaks for itself
and can bo had by any one who wishes
to know what it says on any question.
But no ono cau know what The Tribune
says who depends upon the opposition
press for the distorted presentations 'in
that press of Tho Tribuno's position. .
And we tako this occasion to restate
what we havo said many times before,
that, wc arc ready at all times to stand
by what wo have said oursolves, but in
no way aro wo to be held or bound by
the statements iu unfriendh newspa
pers as to our position on any question
whatever. ' The Tribuno says what ic
say6, and stands by it. lint it docs not
say what tho mendacious and hostile
sheets claim it says, and it has no pat
or lot in those distortions.
CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE.
Tho Tribune has been giving Mr.
John Peterson, State Food and Dairy
Counnissio'nor, eredit, it appears, where
he is not entitled to it, as information
obtained yesterday convinces us. We
invito attention to a statement in an
other column of this morning's Trib
une by Mr. Walter J. Frazier, City
Food and Dairy Commissioner, who
has, in fact, with Mr. Herman Harms,
Statu aud City Chemist, done prott'
much all of tho valuable work for
which Mr. Peterson was apparently get
ting tho credit.
It was quite natural that Governor
Culler should refer the matter in con
troversy to 'Mr. Peterson, siuce Mr.
Peterson is the Stato official, appointed
by the Governor to attend to these
matters. Tho troublo appears to have
been, tlmt Mir. Peterson failed to give
-redit to Mr. Frazior and Mr. Harms
for the source of his information where
in that information was valuable aud
to fully comprehend tho responsibility
under which he rested of giving in on
intelligent manner all tho facts in
volved. Wo have tho utmost confidence iu
Mr. Frazier's accuracy, ability, nud
good faith, and do uot think for oue
moment that ho would make auy state- !
ment unless he was absolutely sure of
its correctness. And in his statement
carried in this morning T3 paper we.
think the public will find matter of
much interest and value in this whole
controversy on the question of butter
and of food combines in general.
CONGRESS AND BUSINESS.
It. will no doubt shock the members
of Congress to find out how they are
looked upon by tho business interests
of tho county. Wo hove from a con
servativo yet outspoken firm iu tho
East a review of tho general market
which, whilo approving President
Roosevelt's administration and "looking
forward to constructive measures un
der Mr. Taft, and declaring that there
is uo apparout cause for pessimism and
that 190!) promises to be ono of the
most prosperous years of our coun
trjv indulges in certain forebodings. It
notes the fact that tho stock market is
in woak hands, and that a disquiet
ing matter is the possibility of ad
vance in money rate?; that the gold
oxports are a disturbing factor also,
and with the surplus reserves of the j
New York banks boiug down to 20,
000,000 and decreasing Mcadily, .there
is liable to come a decided check ;o
such signs of advancement as havo ap
peared. Iu summing up its discus
sion of the general situation, the cir
cular procoeds:
Anolhcr disturbing x'eaturn Is tho as
sembllnp of Congress. From a markot
standpoint, there Is always far morii pos
sibility of harm than pood In congres
sional legislation, and this year' with si
reduction In tariff tho chlof object be
fore It, tho resumption of congressional
activity Is fraught with especial dnnurr.
It Is proper to note In thin connection,
that talk of tariff reduction on Iron mul
Iron products Is the biggest bull card 1m
aglnahlo on United States Steel. This
company's cost of production Is so far
below tli.-it of Its competitor, that a re
duction In tariff protection, wbleh might
Jeopardize their existence, would ylmply
reduce Its prolU somewhat and place tt
In a position where It could acquire, on
very favorable torms, any business that
they might be obliged to surrender. Sueh
a process would be merely hasteulng
the survival of the llttest. It would also
tond far more than any otlior oin,- act
to make of the Steel Corporation ;iu .ab
solute monopoly, which leads us to think
It very doubtful If any radical action Is
taken-
That is certainly n comprehensive
view of tho situation, aud it gives ex
plicit voiuc to certain notes of renc
tiou that come from the East with re
gard to tariff rcducLion, to the effoet
that as a mutter of fact uot much will
ho done in that direction. We havo
full faith, however, that the inquiry
into tho tariff" question will bo thorough
and impartial; that all who wish to de
clare their opinions or to cito facts will
be listened to with patience, and that
wisdom will govern the action of Con
gress in tho final decision of this que.- j
tiou. We arc confident that ample time.
will be takcu for hearings and discus- j
sions, and that tho country will be I
thoroughly convinced, before the ennct- I
meut of any new tariff measure, that
nothing has been omitted in the public
interest to fhed light and information
upon tho whole tariff question, with a
view to obtaining such relief as will, in
fact, benefit the country, while at tho
samo timo doing no harm to the in
terests of the manufacturers,
