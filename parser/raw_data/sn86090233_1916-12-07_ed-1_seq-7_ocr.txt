CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEE BE6INS
RAILWAY INQUIRY
Proposed by President to Bit
ter Condition' ot Carriers.
MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM
Officials of Roado Proparad to AdvocatS
Federal incorporation, Supervision of
Securities and Extension of Authority
of Interstate Commerce Commission.
Washington, Nov. 20.—Ten members
of Congress, five Senators and five
members of the House of Representa
tives, began here today an inquiry into
the subject of public control and su
pervision of railroads that may lead to
the revolutionizing of the whole scheme
of governmental regulation of the coun
try's transportation lines. Incidentally
the committee is to look into the ques
tion of government ownership of rail
ways, telephone and telegraph lines
and express companies.
The members of the committee
which will conduct this important in
vestigation are Senator Newlands of
Nevada, chairman; Senators Robinson
of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama,
Cummins of Iowa and Brandegee of
Connecticut, and Representatives Ad
amson of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee,
Cullop of Indiana, Esch of Wisconsin
and Hamilton of Michigan. The in
quiry was recommended by President
Wilson In his message to Congress in
December of last year. He described
as its purpose to determine what could
be done "for bettering the condition®
under which the railroads are operated
and for making them more useful serv
ants of the country as a whole.
Prominent Mon as Witnesses.
In order to obtain the views of all
interests affected by the operations of
the transportation lines the committee
has invited prominent shippers, bank
ers, representatives of commercial or
ganizations, railway executives, econo
mists and others to appear before them. %
The first to be heard are railroad
•ommlssioners of various states who
began their evidence today. Their
testimony is directed chiefly to oppos
ing any enlargement of the federal
authority over commerce that would
detract from the powers now exercised
by state bodies. They will be followed
shortly by officials of railway labot
>rganizations who are expected to reg
ister their opposition to the increase
of governmental authority over wages
ind conditions of labor.
Chief interest in the hearings een
ers in the proposals that will be put
orward by representatives of the rail
roads, for it is reported that they will
advocate an extension of federal an
horit.v over rates and securities to the
Tactical exclusion of state control of
hese matters. It is understood also that
■ hey will go on record in favor of fed
ral incorporation of all railroad lines.
Legislativ« Program of Railroads.
From an authoritative source is ob
ained the following outline of the leg
islative program which the railroads
will ask the committee to consider in
its investigation: They will endeavor
to demonstrate to the commission that
one of the principal defects In the pres
ent system of railroad regulation is
the lack of coordination resulting from
the simultaneous and conflicting regu
lation by the federal government and
by the 48 states. They will, therefore,
ask that entire governmental control
of the rates and practices of interstate
carriers, except purely local matters,
be placed In the hands of a federal
body so that interstate traffic may be
regulated without reference to state
lines, leaving to the state commissions
jurisdiction only over local matters and
local public utilities. As a part of this
plan,, a compulsory system of federal
Incorporation is to be recommended,
accompanied by federal supervision of
railroad stock and bond issues.
A reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission will be asked,
In-order to enable the commisjlon prop
erly to exercise its increa
It is also proposed that the preparation
and prosecution of cases against the
railroads shall be delegated to some
other agency of the government, possi
bly the Department of Justice, so that
the commission may devote its ener
gies to its administrative functions.
With the commission thus relieved
of some of its present duties and equip
ped to handle its business more prompt
ly, the railroads will urge that the pe
riod during which the commission may
now suspend proposed increases in
fates be reduced from ten mbnths to
50 days, with provision for reparation
to be paid to the shippers if the ad
vance shall be declared unreasonable.
They will also ask that the commis
sion be given the power to prescribe
minimum as well as maximum rates
so that in meeting complaints of dis
crimination the commission may order
the advance of a rate which it consid
ers too low.
One of the most important recom
mendations for which the railroads
will ask favorable consideration la
that the commission be specifically
authorized to take into account in
rate regulation the effect of rates
upon total earnings in the light of ex
penses.
While the Newlands Committee Is
required, under the resolution creat
ing it, to submit a report by January
0 next, it is not anticipated tbat the
«imittee will have come anywhere
completing its labors then.
