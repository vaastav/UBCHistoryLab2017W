Tn the Senate Thursday?
Mr. Sumner offered a resolution Instruct
ng the Committee on the District of Colum
bia to inquire into the propriety of re
pcallngthe charter of the Medical Society
of the l>i.-t:rict of Columbia, nud of such
Other i gidation as may be necessary to se
cure uiedical practitioners equal * rights
without distinctit n of color.
Mr. Sumner said this medical association
had refused to admit to membership certain
colored practitioners in the District, one of
whom lead served with distinction as a
surgeon in the late war. One of the clauses
in tne charter ofthi- as.-oeiation provide
that n??u( of its members shall hold consul
tations with any medical practitioners who
Lave resided in tlic District for six month
without becoming members of the society.
It was a di-grace to the civilization of the
age that the- medical society was attempting
to plant itself in opposition to equal right-"
and he now gave it notice that, so far as he
was concerned, he did not intend to allow
it to do thi- if a law of Congress can pre
vent it. these colored practitioners were
entitled to the same privileges here as the
white ones. Thi- attempt to proscribe the
colored practitioners w; s not only degrading
to tht in. but degrading' to the society.
Mi. Patterson inquired how a reform was
to ! r- effe< red. Suppose the? barter was re
pealed, what would that accomplish You
coul 1 not then compel the v. iiiU* practition
er- eon-ult wirli the colored.
Mr. Sumner: JNo. You cannot do thai,
but there certainly is some remedy. The
idea of repealing 'ho charter has been sug
gested Lv some of the members ol the so
ciety. who will then organize a new society,
whore toleration shall prevail.
The resolution was then adopted.
[Yet some people think Sumner is not
crazy.]
Virginia In the \cypo National V011
veotion.
In tho National Negro Labor Convention
in Wa-hiugtt>n, on 'Thursday, William II.
Lc-ter, of Virginia, offered the following,
which was laid no the table :
""Whereas the Legislature of Virginia i
now under the control <?f a rebel majority,
a result ol 11 n para lit led intimidation on the
part of the rebels toward the loyal voters,
and especially the colored elector* : and
wherea- there can be no real liberty for our
race in thai Slate, much less any safety for
the interest of colored and white labor," un
less -aid Legislature 1- under the control of
loyal men. therefore
"Resolved, That this Convention enrn
?"?( lv invoke-the Congress of t in* L'nited
.?states to enf >rce its own laws ?>y causing the
eongros.-ional te-t-oath to lie admini-tered
to the rebel Legislature of Virginia, ami
award the seat- 01 tiio.se who cannot take it
to tle ir eligible opponents who received
the next highest vote, where, li'dii the cir
cumstances. the elector- lnu-t have known
that they were casting their votes for ineli
gible candidates.
" Resolved, That Congress enforce the law
of loyalty, and the rights of loyalty will be
preserved in the State of Virginia. If not
enforced, lovalty will be lost, and the co
lored people, more than t>o0,000 in that
State, will be reduced to a condition as de
plorable as when they were fastened in
chains of slavery.
" Resolved, That these resolutions, pro
jHirlv attested, be forwarded by the Secre
tary to members of Congress, and be pub
lished in the newspapers of the country."
J. 11. Kuiney, of South Carolina, said
that in travelling to this Convention they
travelled in first-class cars 011 lir-t-cla-s tick
ets until they reached Virginia. There
they were put out of the lirst-class cars.
Their first-class tickets did not in-uro them j
a preference. lie was a member of the
South Carolina LegMature.
"While Bishop Campbell was speaking?
A voice : Iiow about Virginia?
Bishop Campbell : Why, the negroes let
the rebels pull the wool over their eyes
there. [Laughter.]
Tjie Wokd Negro.?Forney's Chronicle
says:
" Considerable sensitiveness is manifest
ed at every colored convention about the
use of the word negro. The body now sit
ting form no exception, a discussion having
arisen the other dnv concerning its appear
ance in an ollicial document. Mr. Lang
stou, apparently, was the only defender of
the obnoxious adjective. Tin's feeling, we
think, is uncalled for and mistaken. Negro
is a good Latin word transferred to Eng
lish, meaning black. If the word is shame
ful, the fact must lie more so, and the co
lored men make an admission against them
selves in objecting to it. This word came
into the English language long before
America was discovered, and consequently
cannot be looked on as u term of derision
or reproach."
A Deplorable Cask.?A beautiful and
accomplished daughter of Mr. John Dcnni
son, of Baltimore, a short lime since left
her home for the purpose of visiting a rela
tive in Virginia. Alter an absence of some
w eeks, information reached her father that
she had absconded with an unprincipled
scoundrel, and was at present in one of the
vilest dens in "Washington, oil Thirteenth
street near I). Tim matter was given into
the hands of Detectives Bigleyand Coonies,
who, after a laborious search, found the
i^rl. The father wa? immediately sent for,
and the interview between the two is wild
to have been heart-rending, as the girl posi
tively refused to return home and lead onre
more nn exemplary life. She was taken to
Baltimore, however, on the 12:30 train yes
terday, With a \ lew of being sent to a re
formatory institution*? Washington CTiro

Woman Suffrage?The Cardiff Stone
Giant.?Chicago, December 0.?The final
vote ou the woin:tu-suft'rage bill in the Legis
lature of Wyoming stood: Council, 7 to 2 ;
liou-e, 7 to 4.
An article appears in the Dubuque Time?,
written by a gentleman at Fort Dodge,
Iowa, which claims to throw light on the
Cardiff giant. About the Gth of June two
men registered their names at the St. Charles
Hotel at Fort Dodge as George Hall, of
Bingbamton, and ILK. Alartin, of Boston.
Alter movements of a suspicious character
they finally purchased an acre of gypsum
land from* John McDermott, paving 8100
therefor. They built a shanty on the ground
and employed" men to open agypsum quarry
for the purpose, as they said,* of sending a
handsome piece to New York. They got
out a large stone, dressed it eleven feet
three inches in length and three feet two
inches wide, and loaded it on a railroad car.
The theory i.s that Hail and Alartin took the
stone to Chicago, where it was worked into
a statue, thence to Binghamton, and thence
to Newell's farm. The correspondent ex
presses the opinion that Colonel Wood, for
merly of the Chicago Aluseum, is concerned
in the giant, as he happened around just
when they were digging it up.
It is said the man who carved the giant i.s
now in Chicago, but prefers to keep quiet.
