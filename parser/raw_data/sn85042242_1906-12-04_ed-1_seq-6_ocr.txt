wide i-irculatum and .s a desirable adveitis
no melium. Briny published at the capital

of a semi-official character, and is thcrefoi
particularly interesting to all who desire ti

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The Tribune gives today the full
text of President Roosevelt's mes­
sage to congress. As usual, the presi­
dent's recommendations are vigorous
and will repay careful reading. The
•conservatives will differ- with him on
some of his recommendations, but he
has the faculty of appealing to the
great mass of the people and of ob­
taining from congress what legislation
he desires. He touches a vital truth
when he deprecates the preaching of
"mere discontent" by labor agitators,
and his views on the race question are
the well known ones he has been known
always to maintain. His demand for
more complete control of corporations
is in line with the trend of public
sentiment. His advocacy of an in­
heritance and income tax will be
popular with (those who have been
educated to believe that too large
fortunes are a menace to the average
welfare of all the people. It is a
serious question whether congress
should penalize large accumulations
•of wealth
toy
a tax such as has been
suggested and congress will no doubt
hear some brilliant debates on this
question. Other recommendations in
the message deal largely with depart­
mental questions and do not touch
any un«s«al topics. It will suggest
itself to Jibe reader, that the presi­
dent's strenuosity is reflected in the
amplitude and scoge of his message
and that his Is a remarkable mentality
that can find tinr#-*W deal 'sto 'fully
with so many que^ens, fai addition to1
performing'* his 'Villiferous executive
duties. 3^
The length of President Roosevelt's
message and the" multiplicity of the
subjects covered adds another chapter
to the remarkable career of this re­
markable man. us -when the presi­
dent finds time to devote to so much
library work is one of the enigmas
of this administration and an evidence
-Of the strenuosity of the life of the
man. Not only is the president pro­
lific 'but he is interesting. He writes
nothing that is bad. His composition
is good and his conclusions sound.
He probably makes many mistakes
hut the people either do not see them
or overlook thein. Few can be found
who are bold enough to criticise
Roosevek.. There is a boldness about
hl3 manner—a departure from the
'Customary—that pleases the people.
Contingencies may arise that will
cause republicans to regret he has
•Ijeen so positive in Mg assertions" that
lie will not accept a renomination for
another term.
The great task that now seems to
burden the state democracy—as she
fe writ in the democratic" press—is the
selection .of the next republican candi­
date for United States senator In thi"
state. The democrats do not need to
worry about that. There'll be plenty
Of "fern under the primary election law.
Now that "geottte" is on the Grand
Forks 'Press no other paper can com
.pete with the democratic organ—in
"pi»e" dreams—and Jud LaMoure's
fecent visit was a great inspiration
for "spooks."
Governor-elect Burke is discovering
nany tried and true democrats and
admiring republicans who
"helped do it"—an4 want to continue
tbeir services-Hlfe already is any

SUPREME COURT LDEClO£S THE
HABEAS CORPUS CASE8 0F
MOYER AND OTHER!
MUST REMAIN IN JAIL IN IDAHO
PRISONERS CHARGED WITH COM­
PLICITY IN MURDER OF FOR-
MER GOVERNOR.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme
court of the United States has de­
cided the habeas corpus cases of
Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, the
representatives of the Western Fed­
eration of Miners who are now held in
prison in Idaho on the charge of com­
plicity in the murder of former Gov­
ernor Steunenberg, adversely to the
ipen. The opinion was by Justice Har­
lan.
The effect of the decision will be
to continue to hold' the men in con­
finement for trial in Idaho.
Of the men involved Charles H.
Moyer is president, W. D. Haywooid
secretary-treasure*- and George A. Pet­
tibone a member of the Western Fed­
eration of Miners. They are now in
prison in Idaho, under a charge of mur­
dering former Governor Stuenenberg
of that state, although it was not
charged that they were present when
the crime was committed. The cases
came to this court on an appeal from
a decision of the Idaho federal court
refusing to grant writs of habeas cor­
pus. The principal point of contro­
versy was the method by which the
Idaho authorities secured jurisdiction
over the men. All of them are resi­
dents of Colorado and it was alleged
on behalf of Moyer and his associ­
ates that they were kidnapped in pur­
suance of conspiracy to which the gov­
ernor of Colorado and the Idaho au­
thorities were parties and thus juris
diction was acquired by federal court.
Justice Harlan said in the habeas
corpus proceedings in the United
States court the matter of extradition
of the defendants was not material.
The merits of the case were not in­
volved, as that phase wa°s not pre­
sented. The only question there in­
volved was the right of the state
courts to proceed with the cases, of
which there could be no doubt.
UNDER ANTI-TRUST LAW.
City of Atlanta Wins Suit Against
Pipe Combine.'
Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme
court of the United States has decjded
the case of the city of Atlanta, 6a.,'
against the so-called "pipe line trust"
in favor of the city. The title of the
case as it was presented to the court
was the Chattanooga Foundry and
Pipe Works and South Pittsburg Pipe
company vs. the city of Atlanta, the
case coming to this court in pursu­
ance of an effort by the pipe manu­
facturers to secure the reversal of a
decision by the circuit court of ap­
peals, which was unfavorable to them.
The suit was instituted by the city
under the Sherman anti-trust law on
the complaint that by the combina­
tion of the manufacturers the munici­
pality had been compelled to paj an
excess of $15,000 over a fair price on
orders for pipe amounting to $66,000.
The city asked damages in the sum of
$45,000, or three times the amount of
loss, but the court of appeals, affirming
a decision by the circuit court for
East Tennessee, allowed $7,000. The
essential violation of the law alleged
was that all the pipemakers had so
manipulated their bids as to throw
the contracts to the Annlston Pipe
and Foundry company of Anniston,
Ala., rendering that company's bids
the lowest offered, notwithstanding
they were still exorbitant.
"SHOT UP" DAKOTA TOWN.
Disclosure Concerning Past Record of
Colored Troops.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The war de­
partment is preparing for an investi­
gation by congress of the case of the
companies of the Twenty-fifth infantry,
recently discharged without honor by
order of President Roosevelt, and to
this end has compiled a record of
negro troops dating back to the Civil
war. It is said that this record dis­
closes a Btate of affairs not generally
known—that once before at least the
Twenty-fifth infantry "shot up a
town." The affair happened In 1885
at Fort Sturgis, S. D. Some of the
negro soldiers went on a rampage
similar to that at Brownsville, Tex.,
fend one of their number killed a citi
ren. In that case, however, the citi­
zens took the matter in their own
hands, forced the troopers tinder pain
of death to disclose the name of the
man who did the killing and thep took
him out and lynehed him,

THOUSANDS OF CHILD^AL&VES.
Northern Capital Blamed for CondU
tions In South.
New York,' Dec. 4.—That there are
thousands of child slaves, mostly little
girls, working in the textile mills of
the South and theft Northern capital
ts to blame for this condition, was
the declaration of Mrs. Frederick Na­
than of the Consumers' league, who
addressed an audience of about 1,500
persons at the first winter session of
the "people's forum" in the New
Rochelle theater.
"The capital of the country is liter­
ally devouring little children," said
Mrs. Nathan. "When one of the negro
slaves of the South died he had to be
replaced, but these child slaves work
where the dust chokes them tod gives
them tuberculosis and nobody cares.
Many of them die, but there are al­
ways others.
"At a. time'When these little chil­
dren should nestling in- their beds
they are aroused by the shrill sound
of the factory whistle and compelled
to go to work that lasts, sometimes,
far into the night Others are em­
ployed all night and when morning
comes they may be found lying around
the factory on benches because they
are too worn out to go home for break­
fast."
TRIAL PROGRESSES SLOWLY
DEFENSE REPEATEDLY OBJECTS
TO TESTIMONY IN 8WEA
CASE AT CHICAGO.
Chicago, Dec. 4.—Albert Young, the
former president of the Teamsters'
I union and the present head of the
United Teamsters of America, was
again called to the stand when the
trial of Cornelius P. Shea, president of
the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, was resumed.
The attorneys for the defense en­
tered vehement protests to nearly
every answer given by Young to the
questions of Assistant State's Attor­
ney Miller and the trial progressed
slowly. The state at the opening of
the session sought to prove in a gen­
eral way through Young conversations
said to have taken place between Shea
and pickets placed by the Teamsters'
union. The attorneys for the defense
Insisted that the witness should con­
fine himself to specific Instances and
the state declared that a general ex­
amination was legal and proper. Judge
Ball ruled that the witness must des­
ignate the time and place of all con­
versations and if possible^ make elpar
the Identity of all persons taking part
in the conversations.
Young was asked if he 'ftad dorie
picket duty himself and replied:
"Yes, I did." rij
"Do you remember,, an ,Qccn£renQjB
that took place during the strike near
the Washington street tunnel?"
"I do."
vi.
"Who was there at the time?"
"Jerry McCarthy, business agent of
the Truck Drivers', union, and myself."
"What happened there?"
"I saw a man hit a driver employed
by Franklin MacVeagh & Co. and
knock him down. When the man got
up I hit him myself."
The witness declared that the pick­
ets stationed around the stores where
strikes had been declared made fre­
quent reports to President Shea and
that he personally heard many of
them.
SAID TO BE AGAINST JAPS.
Metcalfs Report on San Francisco
Incident.
San Francisco, Dec. 4.—The Call
says:
School Director D. H. Oliver states
that. Secretary Metcalf, before his de­
parture for Washington, told school
directors that he believed they were
clearly within their rights in estab­
lishing a separate school for Japanese
pupils. This would tend to correct
the impression that Secretary Metcalf
had decided to favor the Japanese In
his report to the president. The sec­
retary's report, it may be assumed,
will conform to his assurances to the
school board.
Attorneys versed in international
law believe that the treaty between
Japan and America in no way coverB
the crisis at issue and the best that
the United States can do for the Island
empire is to institute a test in
the federal courts, which has already
been done. That the matter will be
taken to the supreme court for
decision is now quite evident and if it
is decided there that the Japanese are
not Mongolians, a contention raised to
divert the enforcement of the law re­
quiring that race to be taught in sep­
arate schools, it is now quite certain
a new law will be passed by the leg­
islature next session to keep the Japa­
nese out of schools in which Caucas
