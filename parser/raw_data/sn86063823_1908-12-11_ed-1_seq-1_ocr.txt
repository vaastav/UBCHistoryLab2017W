CHAIRMAN MACK talks
ON POLITICAL SITUATION.
Buffalo; Deer 11. Norman E. Mack,
Chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, when asked about the pub
lished report that a disagreement had
developed between aim and Secretary
Woodson, of the Committee, said:
"There is nothing to it, nothing at
all. He also said that it was not prob
able the committee would hold meet
i ags for three years, as it was not cus
tomary for the committee to meet be
tween campaigns.
"Are you still favorable to Bryan,"
he was asked. '
"Certainly, I see no reason ( Lshould
not be just as good a friend to Bryan
now as I have "been in the past."
When asked if he would back him
In 1913, fie replied that Bryan was not
likely to be a candidate, and he would
-not venture to guess who the candi
date would be. "The important quest
Ion Just now is whether we are going
to have real tariff revision," he con
tinued. "The manner In which the
highly protected Interests at Wash
ington are framing things, makes it
appear that relief cannot be expected
to be realized, but the interests of the
Democratic party will ibe well taken
care of by the Democrats in Congress"
In order to undergo an operation,
houlds the specialists consider this
necessary. Consequently his" stay in
Paris will be short.

Congressmen Don't Like His Trat
- ment of the Secret Service in His
Recent Message and a Resolution
May Be Passed, Calling for a Com
mittee to Deal with Portion of the
Message.
Washington, Dec. 11. Attention
was called today to the fact that the
utterances of the President in regard
to the action of Congress in limiting
the use of the Secret Service force is
not the only action of the executive
considered toy the members as objec
tionable, rt has become known that a
sub-committee of the Committee on
Appropriations, having charge of the
preparation of the executive, legisla
tive and judicial appropriation bills
have been Investigating razing of the
old Pennsylvania dapot that was lo
cated on the Mall, until the President
had it torn down last summer. That
the committee failed to expunge its
inquiries about this action from the
printed hearings indicates the temper
of the committee toward the execu
tive. When Col. Oihas. S. Bromwell, mili
tary aide to the President and Super
intendent of Public Buildings and
Grounds, appeared before the commit
tee. Representative Burleson, of Tex
as, asked if he had not requested an
appropriation the last year for a watch
man for the old depot.
"I think so," replied Col. Bromwell,
"but I have not had occasion to do it
because I have torn down the railroad
station."
"What, torn down the railroad sta
tion," exclaimed the Texas member.
Bromwell explaned that he acted on
a written order from the President.
"Do you know of any law that au
thorizes any executive officer to sell
any property of the United States of
that character?" inquired Chairban
Tawney.
No, sir," exclaimed Bromwell. J'l
called attention to that fact and I re
ceived an-order to tear the building
down." '
From the stenographic reports of
ihe .hearing. It appears, he was asked
if the President said why he wanted
the building removed. If there was any

necessity for the removal and if the
removal was done to Improve the pro
spective, all of which remained unan
swered, until Chairman Tawney de
manded one. Then CpL Bromwell re
sponded that he knew of no immed
iate . necessity, although he was very
glad personally that it was done.
The committee then went -into an
examination of government officials to
ascertain by what right the Cimmiss
ion on Country Life had been appoin
ted by the President and by what right
they had the use of the franking priv
ilege, as was claimed is being done.
One of the members of the committee
referred "to the commission as v"one
created without the authority of law."

.Washington, Dec. 11. Rep. Perkins
off New'Tork, today7 introduced a res
olution which had been heretofore a
creed troon irrovidlne for the appoint
ment of a special committee ' of live
members to consider the proper way
of dealing -with that portion of the
President's message which criticises
the Federal ' Congress In prohibiting
the detail of. secret service men to
CTrty ' outside ' their respective bur-
eaus.
The resolution was preceded by a
preamble reciting . some of the ex
pressions of the message. No effort
was made to give voice to the feel
ing of the house in presenting the res
olution. Perkins made a brief state
ment, saying the House, he was satis
fied, would not hesitate to take such
action as the dignity of that body re
quired. He said sojne of the Presid
ent's expressions were y unfortunate
In presenting he resolution Perk
ins said the statements of the Presi
dent could not be lightly disregarded,
as they might impair the usefulness
of Congress. A resolution ' similar to
that passed by he House will provide
for the appointment of a committee
to' recommend a course of action rel
ative to the present emergency.
The resolution was adopted and Per
kins, of New York, Denby, of Michi
gan; Weeks, of Massachusetts,; Will
iams, of Mississippi and Lloyd, of Mis
souri, were appointed on the commit
tee. Sheep Growers Are Heard.

Washington, Dec. 11. 'When the

ed up in the House today the extraor
dinary situation- was presented that

pensed of by unanimous consent. Its
reading for amendment was immedi
ately begun.

THE COMING OF NORDICA
NOW AN ASSURED FACT.
Contract has been made with the
management of Mme. Lillian Nordlca
by the Apollo Club of Roswell and the
coming of the world's greatest concert
singer and her company of four art
ists is now an assured fact. She is to
appear here January 11. The coming
of this great singer is the biggest v
ent, from the standpoint of music,
the theatre and the arts, In the his
tory of the Pecos Valley, and, as one
man said, it will advertise the place
more, among a certain class at least,
than if the whole town burned down.
There is only one public assembly
hall in Roswell fit for the entertain
ment, and that Is the new Baptist
church. It is thought that, as a matter
of civic pride, the trustees of the
church will waive their rule in this '
one instance and permit the entertain
ment to be presented there. However,
it is not definitely decided.
The securing of the great attract
ion was accomplished by a hundred
men guaranteeing the amount of ten
dollars apiece to cover the first ex
penses. They are to be reimbursed
from the sale of tickets, and It is
thought that there will Ibe enough
seats provided at $2.50 apiece to cov
er all expenses. It is not to be a fi
nancial gaining proposition on the
part of the Club.
There will be no difficulty of dispos
ing of the seats. On the other hand. It
will me merely a matter of distribut
ing them. Antesla, Carlsbad, Hager-
man and many other towns up and
down the road will send large delega
tions. Three of the different town haye
already sent requisitions for 25 seats
each. The railroad will probably run
special trains on the occasion. Charles
-de Bremond, J. W. Thomas and J. ij.
Hamilton have been named a commit
tee to sell the tickets, and their place
of meeting for this purpose will be an
nounced later that the applicants tor
seats may call for them.
