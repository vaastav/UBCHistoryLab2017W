GIANT RIVER TUNNELS.
TAKE PLACE OF BRIDGES IN CON.
NECTING NEW JERSEY AND
NEW YORK.
Completion of Borings Under Hudson
River One of Greatest of Engineer
Ins Feats
After half a century of speculation
on the practicability of tunneling the
Hudson river from New Jersey to the
Island of Manhattan, it is now possi
ble to walk dry-shod from Jersey to
New York. The twin bores have been
completed; that is, they have been cut
through and cased in, though of course
some finishing touches are yet to be
put upon them. It was a few days
ago that in the presence of the engi
neers, the directors and a dozen re
porters, W. G. Oakman, president of
the Hudson Companies, split an old
brick bulkhead with a hydraulic jack
and completed the" firs.t Manhattan-
Jersey tunnel system. There was a
ix-inch gap in the wall. A gang of
"ground hogs" rammed the breach a
little wider, and the party crawled
through into New York city.
The old wall that was cut through
was seven feet thick. It is the relic
of a former failure to tunnel the
Hudson. Twenty-three years ago the
ngineers of the old Hudson Company,
after cutting a considerable distance
nnder the river, abandoned the enter
prise and walled in the unfinished
work with this brick bulkhead.
Two tube-tunnels run parallel be
neath the Hudson river, the work of
boring them being done under direc
tion of the New York and New Jer
sey Railroad Company, but this com
pany entrusted the actual performance
of the work to the Hudson Companies.
The present tube has been two
years in the course of construction.
Tho tubes will cost when completed
about $13,000,000, and the entire work
will cost about $30,000,000.
Fifteen Feet in Diameter.
The tubes are 5,700 feet long, 15
feet in diameter and are intended for
one track each, with a sidewalk for
workmen. Two tubes have been start
ed on the New Jersey shore, to run
under the river to Cortlandt and
Church streets. These tubes will be
164 feet in diameter. The tubes just
completed will connect on the New
Jersey- shoro with the Pennsylvania
and the Lackawanna terminals. In
Manhattan one branch will connect
with the subway under Fourth ave
nue at Astor Place. Another branch
will run to Sixth avenue and Thirty
third street. A trip through the entire
length of the tunnel from the subway
to Hoboken will cost only five cents.
About six hundred men have been em
ployed in the tunnels.
Cars will be running through these
tube-tunnels in eighteen months. The
safety of transportation in the tunnel
needs no demonstration, for trains will
run in a steel tube the strength of
which to resist pressure has been care
fully worked out. Being laid from
fifteen to fifty feet below the river
bed, it cannot be affected by the ac
tion of tidewater. The tube is a steel
lined hole in the earth, and except for

THE UNCONVENTIONAL SARAH.
It was Thomas Carlyle who said
tbat all genius was akin to savagery.
Sarah Bernhardt exemplifies this in
the buodoir of her chateau in Paris.
If me. Bernhardt Is a perfect barbarian
In her defiance of all the convention
alities regarding color schemes. Her
sleeping room is hung In royal purple,
decorated with peoeock plumes. Over
her Ivouis XVI. bed Is a canopy made
of unspun silk taken directly from the
silkworm cocoon. A great splash of
crimson satin, in the form of a shield,
adorns the center. The wnlls are hung
in old tanestries, and in the interstices
collisions due to operating blunders
the risk of travel ought to be nil.
Many Tunnels to be Dug.
It having been proved practicable
to tunnel beneath the Hudson river,
the Pennsylvania Railroad undertak
ing will be pushed rapidly, and it may
be expected that in course of time ev
ery trunk line coming into Jersey City
will have its own tunnel. The East
river piercings do not present much
of a problem. In less than five years
trains ought to be running from Phil
adelphia to Boston with no water to
be crossed.
It is believed that within ten years
electric trains will make the trip from
Philadelphia to New York in one hour.
NO TURKEY STUFFING?
Christmas Dinner Incomplete With
out This Ol d-Fashioned Addition.
The latest and most obnoxious
crank In th gastronomic line is that
deluded epicure who assorts that
Christmas turkey must be served
without "stuffing." He says it is an
anomaly, a thing without reason, an
insult to the completeness of the
bird. He even declares that it de
tracts from the sweet flavor and deli
cute aroma of the king of fowls.
Thus he tbrusts himself into the pub
Ik' arena, a most unwelcome "butter
in," striving to accomplish the down
fall of an historic institution. He ii
not a true American. He has never
tasted "stuffing as mother made it"
the real Simon-pure article, spooned
out of the deep recesses of the royal
bird in great crumbly masses that fill
the room with rich aroma and the
heart of man, woman and child with
Joy uneoniincd.
It is the soul of the turkey, is stuff
ing. With the bird itself one is al
ways bothered about what part he
will have whether white meat or
dark; whether a wing, a thigh, or a
drumstick; whether the wish-bone,
the liver, or "the part that went over
the fence last;" but for the stuffing,
American sentiment is universal.
The only question is: How much does
one dare to eat? And then that en
trancing, sngey odor, from the mys
terious "yarns" that enter into the mak
ingas sweet as the summer breezes
over new mown hay as delicate as
the fragrance of orange blossoms on
a wedding day. And perchance, in
addition, we shall catch the sublime
suggestion of an onion, wafted into
our quivering nostrils, and recalling
some dear departed maternal spirit
who ministered to our boyish wants
In days of yore.
Turkey straight, without stuffing?
Not while there is breath to sound a
protest. It is the mission of civiliza
tion to mix with naked nature the
toothsome miscellany of tradition; to
blend the work of nature and man;
to sweeten with our best endeavor
the plain blessings of an all-wise
Providence. That's what gave us
"stuffing;" and until the heart of man
grows cold, until the race loses Its
teeth and lives on pills and tablets
and predigested pap, Its multitudes
will insist on turkey as mother served
it. Down with theories. Give us
etuffing or take the turkey back.

The "divine Sarah" has parted with
her pet tiger, and now has for a com
panion a large and ugly baboon, whose
ears have been pierced so that they
may carry huge rings of solid gold.
Bernhardt Is said to look as young as
he did twenty years ago. Her face
Is without wrinkles, and her step Is as
spry and her manner as vivacious as

FORTUNE FOR A ROSE.
A WONDERFUL NEW VARIETY
WHICH BRINGS THIRTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS.
Is a Ravishing Pink and Crimson Tea
One to Two Hundred ThousanJ
Dollars Expected Profit Other Huge
Figures for Flowers.
A Washington gardener has origi
nated what is believed by expert flor
ists to be the finest rose ever grown
the Queen Beatrice. It is a tea of a
peculiar shade of pink with a touch,
in the bud, of light crimson. Its par
ticular merit lies probably in the fact
that none of the beauty of its coloring
is destroyed either in natural or arti
ficial light Added to this it has a
fragrance equal to, if not superior to
that of the American Beauty. The
rose grows on straight and stur
dy stems from two to three feet long;
its parents are the two well-known va-
THE NEW QUEEN
rieties, Liberty and Madam Chatenay,
the former, one of the most popular
crimson varieties, but uncertain in the
production of perfect blooms. Queen
Beatrice has none of the faults of its
parents and combines all of their good
qualities; it Is resistant to insect and
mildew attacks, and capable of forc
ing on the hothouse bench.
Grown at Gardiner Hubbard Mansion
It was originated by Teter Bissett,
and will be put on the market by
Florist F. H. Kramer, of Washington.
Bissett is the head gardener of Mrs.
Gardiner Hubbard, the widow of the
late Gardiner Hubbard, at one time
president of the National Geographic
Society. She is the mother-in-law of
Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor
of the telephone. The. new rose was
produced at her beautiful suburban
residence, Twin Oaks, just outside of
the national capital.
The leading florists of the country
have known of the existence of this
rose for a year and have made various
tempting offers for it, but it remained
for Florist Kramer to offer $30,000
and finally secure the beauty. '
Such a fabulous sum .for. a rose
seems insignificant, however, when it
is remembered that but a few years
ago Thomas Lawson of "Frenzied Fi
nance" fame paid $30,000 for a mere
carnation, while the greater amount
of $12.r,000 was expended for the "Fi
ancee" carnation. It is hinted that
Mr. Lawson cleaned up over $100,000
out of the Lawson pink and the buy
ers of the "Fiance." carnation easily
doubled the amount expended.
Origin of the American Beauty.
And yet the "American Beauty of
whom every flower lover Is fond has
a very, very sod history. A number
of years ago a Washington gardener
who made only a specialty of garden
roses, received from abroad a ship
ment of plants, among which was a
"mnnirrel ." TIiIh. with ont-of-door cul
ture produced very large and fragrant
niooms. it attracted tne attention or
Thomas Fields, a Washington florist.
Nothing was known by him of the
forcing qualities. of this rose in the
greenhouse, but as he rather liked Its
color and general appearance, one af
ternoon while her husband was ab
sent, he purchased the single plant
from Mrs. Ready for five dollars.
Renrfv. when he retnrad and was told
of the sale, believed that his wife had
asked too much for the flower. Fields
experimental with the plant and found
that it exceeded even his ronnesr
hopes, ne named It the "American
Beauty" and probably cleared $25,000
on this one deal. To-day Ready Is
still a gardener, doing odd Jobs for peo
ple s round town spading np gardens,
supplying rich earth and planting
shrubs.
Mr. Kramer is a Washington florist
with large experience in the flower
line, many new and interesting nov
elties having originated in his green
houses. Among the popular garden
roses which he produced are the
"Climbing Meteor," a climbing varie
ty with large red blooms; "Champion
of the World," "Hooeit E. Lee," "F
H. Kramer," and many other sorts
which have been sold to catalogue
houses and named by them. He has
Just originated the "Climbing Ameri
can Beauty" which will probably be
listed by flower-sellers next spring. He
recently exhibited in Washington the
F. H. Kramer" carnation a deep
pink sort which many well-known
florists have declared to be the equal
or either the "JLawson" or "Fiancee."
He states that no plants of the
"Queen Beatrice" rose will be ready
for distribution before the spring of
11)07 during which time a large sum
of money will be expended in the
erection of hothouses and the cultiva
tion and growing of hundreds of
thousands of young plants. The es
timate is made that probably $150,000
BEATRICE ROSE.
or $200,000 will be made from this
flower.
Attempted Graftings.
Various artifices have been tried by
clever but unscrupulous people to ob
tain specimens of the "Queen Beat
rice" rose, many coming into the
Kramer establishment where a huge
bouquet of the blooms was on exhibi
tion, offering to purchase at large
prices a single flower for a bouton
niere. Others have gone so far as to
order elaborate funeral designs with
the proviso that nothing but this par
ticular kind of rose be used. These
were only dodges to obtain the healthy
wood for slipping and growing, for
the best time to make rose cuttings is
either just before or immediately after
the plant comes Into bloom.
One Washington florist who origi
nated the "Ivory" rose a handsome
white flower, and a sporl of "Golden
Gate" was unwise enough to sell cut
flowers, thereby enabling the purcha
sers to propagate the variety' cheaply.
The Washington Florists' Club re
cently awarded the new "Queen Beat
rice? rose a certificate of merit, the
first of the kind ever given by the
club. The new flower, is so striking
and beautiful that every member .of
the club consented to the award. ""

"Cupid Is one of the best recruiting
officers that Uncle Sam has," confided
one of the sergeants attached to the
recruiting headquarters. "Back of
nearly every enlistment there is a
woman In the case. Lovers' quarrels
chase a lot of fine lads into the serv
ice. Your romantic youth gravitates
to the recruiting office after a serious
break with his sweetheart as naturally
as a duck takes to water. It seems
to him the most fitting way In which
to sacrifice himself when love's young
dream is apparently dispelled. Way
down In his heart he nurses the Idea
of making his erstwhile Inamorata
sad, and It's the army or navy, with
the possibility of death in battle, for
him. Again, other first class material
Is recruited by the desire of young
fellows to sport a uniform before their
girls. In such cases Cupid does his
recruiting through vanity. But In both
ways he manages to fill up big gaps
In the ranks of Uncle Sam's fighters."

Three men went out west to seek
their fortunes. One located in the
Middle West not the Middle West,
peThaps, as it is generally known,
but the central section of the wist
ern half of the United Suites in the
desert country. He started his sue
cessful career by taking up a govern
ment claim under the desert-laud act
He was in the cattle country the
cow country and he made his strike
In cattle.
His friend went further north, still
in the desert area, close to the Cana
dian line in the sheep country. He
took up a government homestead
claim and commuted it.
The third man went into the far
northwest the Oregon country of
Lewis and Clarke and he took up a
government timber claim. He located
in a land where lumbering was done.
And these three men became great
cattle and sheep and timber kings,
and incidentally landlords; and their
operations while widely different
were singularly similar. They filed on
their government claims and at the
earliest possible moment each man
"proved up and sold out" for cash to
larger land grabbers. And so they
learned the mode and got their start
toward land grabbing themselves.
The desert entryman was supposed
under the law to live at least three
years on his 320 acres and to expend
during that period $960 in construct
ing irrigation ditches and other im
provements, and make it his home.
This was what was promised for the
law when it was slipped through
Congress. As a matter of fact, this
man spent a day with a team making
a fake irrigation reservoir and then
another day running a couple of fur
rows around the land, making oath
that this constituted an irrigation
system for its reclamation. Then
within six months he "proved up,"
made the required payments to the
government, and secured a patent to
his land.
The homestead entryman, who, un
der the law, must reside continuously
on his claim, erected a slab, one-room
shanty, 10x12 feet ,and during a per
iod of fourteen months slept in it just
five times. This was the extent of
his home making. Then he, too, made
oath of what he had not done, offered
the required payments to the govern
ment and secured title to his land.
The timber entryman went into the
finest timber section of the United
States the dense forests of the far
northwest and under the timber and
stone act, selected 160 acres of laud,
the timber standing upon which was
worth 5 an acre, and swearing that
he wanted it for his own personal use,
purchased it from the government at
the fixed price of $2.50 an acre and
Immediately disposed of it. So that
within fourteen months these three
men had secured from Uncle Sam an
aggregate of one square mile of gov
ernment land for their own benefit
and use as homes, and sold it out to,
