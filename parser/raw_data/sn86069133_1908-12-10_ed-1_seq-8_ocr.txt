STEEL MEN GATHER

Material Change in Prices Is
Not Anticipated v
New York Dec 10 Material
changes in prices are not expected to
be made at the meeting ox represen
tative steel manufacturers which is
being held here today at the call of
Chairman H B Gary of the United
States Steel corporation nor is it
considered by interested circles in
ca
any degree likely that the delibera
tions of the manufacturers will be in
fluenced by the chances of a down
ward revision of the tariff on steel
But something is expected to be done
by the manufacturers which will
have conclusive effect on the many
railroad systems which are known to
be withholding their rail contracts
for better prices than now prevail
That that something is more likely to
be in the line of harmony however
than of price cutting is the general
opinion
