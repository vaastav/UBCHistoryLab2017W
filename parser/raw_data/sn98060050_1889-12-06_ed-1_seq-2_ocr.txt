and comprehensiveness.

The democratic clamor alnmt our pen
sion s)steui do not deter Mr. Harrison
from declaring for a hroad and hheial poli
cy toward the veterans of the late war.
'.he suhstauce of his declaration is that he
would favor putting on the pension list all
hunoralily dint-hurled sliiier who are tie
prudent on their nun laUir for support,
hut ar prevented hy tlifase or casualty
from earning a living.
'1'he utterance of the message on the

dent not only promises to administer the
law faithfully, 'tut makes several recom
mendations of a practical kind in the direr
tiou of an advancement of the reform.
No pait of the message bears evidence of
more careful consideration than that which
is devoted to the nero question and the
iui)Mrtance of assuring to the eoloied race
a free (.allot and a fair count. The loir
of the 'resident's direct and uncomprom
ising declaration on this suliject is irresUii
hle. Nothing could he more true or more
evident than that "the wrong does not ex
pend itself upon those whose votes are sup
pressed," ami when every part of the coun
try wakes up to n full realization of the
fact thut "every constituency in the I'nion
is wronged" hy this systematic suppression
of rightful vote, we shall see an earnest
and el1ectie movement made to correct
this shameful evil.
, 4oml Thiiif ia Jo Nlotv (In,
It hu become the ciutoni of late with
some of our leading state papers, to sou ml
a note of warning with legard to the m
etiuenl of ICasiern funds in Western
mortgage, and to sa) that the slate is Imj
iug drained in this waj of money which
ought to be kept at home and invested or
used for the benelil of home enterprises
and of our home pnople. That there is
wisdom ami truth hi what I thus mid we
have no doubt, but we believe a far g cuter
danger now menaces (air Vermont people
in the prjteutuud sliiwwdtv managed at
t4M4 which uie Iwiug made to induce the
iMYw4mnt of Vermont capital iu laud com
pany wheiuw and other similar ventures in
the Kuuih. We do nut mwtn at ull to say

South, lint when any section of country
runs wild over attempts to Iksiiii certain
chosen "cities" or locations into a liclltioiis
growth and seeiuinp prosperity, disaster Is 1
sore to follow in the end, and it is the lueii t
of small means that allow themselves to he I

this way only no much money as he can
perfectly well alTord to lo,e, lie is on safe

cam in nine time out of ten is hopeless.
It ttiay be ull very well for train loads of
I Miiton millionaires togo on free excursions
lo Texas and Alabama and invest their
himdieds of thousands thei e, but if men of
moderate means try to emulate their ex
ample and make haste to get in "on the
giound ll-Kir." they will be likely to find in
the end that the ground tloor is nothing but
a deseitud cellar hole.
Thiscine, fortunatelv, has not yet Beied
upon Uratttehorn in any serious or general
ay, as we believe, hut we are told of one
prominent town in Windsor county where
busbies h absolutely dead because the
place has been literally diained of its tnon
ey to put fnto these Southern schemes
Other towns ate in almost as bad a case,
and their people are morally sure to find
in the end that home investments in legiti
mate business enterprises, or Western
mortgage investments made through agents
of known responsibility, are Itonanas by
comparison.
Vermont can never prosper, or herwastt
places he built up anew, while this sort of
thing goes on.
Iteporl or llir Civil Meivtce ('iuinUUu,
The civil service commission, in its re
strt to President Harrison, is able to point
to a gratifying degree of progress during
the past few months. The assertion is em
phatically made that in Washington the
law- is faithfully and honestly executed
without fear or favor. The classified civil
service, which alone comes under the juris
diction of the commission, now includes
alsnit 2S,H0 governmental employes, em
braced in four divisions, vii.f the depart
mental service, the postal service, the cus
toms service ami the railway mail service.
This is a gain of ut least hOOU since the He
publican administration came iu. It is es
tiiuated that the aggregate of the salaries
of these t!S.(HH employes alout equals the
aggregate of the salaries of all the other
minor employes of the government. There
fore, of thwe in the service of the govern
tnent nearly a fourth in jHjint of numbers,
and about a half iu point of imiortaiu'e are
now withdrawn from the influences of the
patronage svstem, and are appointed, not
because they are adheienta of this or that
political leader, hut because they are
deemed likely to he honest and capable ser
vants of the people at large.
An earnest plea is made for a larger ap
prnpiiation to carry on the work of the
roiiniussinu, and stress is laid on the im
portance of keeping close watch against
sw eeptng removals being made by any
otlicial of employes in the classified service.
The ie)Krt niint to that best of tests, ex
perience, as clearly show iug that the
ollices in which the merit svstem ha been
most fan ly tried are precisely the oftic
iu which the best public work has been
done. The system is no longer in the ex
pcrimental stage or on probation. It has
been given full trial; ulid whenever this
trial has been fair the system has worked
admirably. It is not contended that the
system is ideally perfect. The object
the law is to give to the average American
citi.en what it takes away from the pro
tessional mliticiau. In answering the ac
conation frequently brought against th
merit sVHtem, that the examinations are of
such a character us to favor 'Uvs fresh
from school," at the expense of men of ma
tuier age, experience and capacity, the
commissioners say that this is simply in
correct. As a matter of fact, special care
is taken to have the examinations as prac
tical in character as possible, ami to test
each candidate on precisely thone subjects
demanded by the character of the work in
the branch of the service to which he
seeking atimisMou. Hie commissioners
strongly object to irrelevant questions, and
surely, they say, there can le no questions
more irrelevant to a man's duties as clerk
or letter earner than are inquiries as to
how he voted at the last election, or how-
strong Ins political backing is, and these
aie precisely the questions that many of
the men who thus object to the examina
lions Hs impractical," are if. reality de
si roiis of asking.
.n Krrnroii itiprrtalau.
It appears to lie a fact that man) eastern
people have gained a w rong impression
from the stories of destitution in the new
states of Dakota which have lately been
published. The reader is likely to get the
impression that the destitution is general
while such is by no means the case. Much
of this wrong impression Arises from the
fact that there is not a proper appreciation
of the magnitude of the area covered by
the Dakota, so that, while one section of
this great area may have been unfavorably
nhVrted, other sections have not sulTered at
all. This latter is, in fact, exactly w hat
has happened. It is true that in Kamsey
county in the Devil's Iake region, and on
the .Missouri slope iu the west, two years of
drouth have been disastrous for the farmers
who went in there with small means, am!
they are in need of assistance, but iu the
Red Hiver valley region the season has been
one of abundant crops and general prosper
ity A ieceut(irand Korks letter, print
ed in the Springfield Republican, says that
the Northwest as an entirety has had
prospeious year, and the lted Hiver valley
counties iu paiticular are on a more solid
financial footing than at any time befor
since their settlement. The farmers are do
iug well and are able to help their newly
neighbors at the west. This year's total
wheat crop of the great Northwest of Mill
nusota and Dakota will reach the enormous
ttggiegate of S.1.1MNI.IHHI or iMI.ftOO.IKM)
bushels.
Kuquiry made at the oflice of the Ver
mout lmii nnd Ti list company in. this plac
confirms this favorable report, for it is
stated that the interest on the company 'i
loans in the section iu question has lieen
paid with unusual promptness, It is a mat
ter of justice to have this correction made
for it is not pleasant to think of the new
stale of North Dakota coming into the I n
ion with her people iu a condition of gener
al destitution.

Robert l'ollers pulpit in the Church of the

ing diy service last week, giving a half-
hour address on civil service reform Mr.
latou believes that the people are thor
ough!) aroused on the subject of this re
form and thnt they w ill support it and all
measures tending to establish it as soon ns
they understand its tine effects. He sees
in liallot reform n great gain to civil service
reform, and believes that the establishment
of ballot reform throughout the country
would be the death blow of the ss)ils sys
tem. Mr. r.aton believes that both I'resi-
lent Cleveland and President Harrison
were iu earnest in meaning to exemplify lit
their administrations the highest ground in
behalf of the leforiu, but that they were
Iriven from this ground by "the incessant
assaults of the confederated forces of the
(rails system." The friends of the reform,
Mr. Katon said, are not con lined to either
jtolitical party and should the majority of
the Republican party see (it to reject the
reform, he believes that the I)enncratir
would liml itself compelled "to take it up
and go with it before the people in the next
presidential election."
How Virictiiiii W'm Ciinietl
A native Virginian, who serve I iu tlie
Confederate army, but for some years has
been a Republican, writes to a New Kng-
land friend a very calm jet graphic account
of the way Virginia was carried by the
Democtats at the late election. The letter
was not written with the faintest idea that
it would ever be published. Its reading
will cause serious reflection in many minds.
He says :
Our state election is over and now be
longs to history of the past. Never was
Virginia so thoroughly canvasseil. hut to
no purpose, for there was a settled deter
mutation on the pait oi the Democratic
party leaders not to permit the state to U
declared for the Republican ticket. The
press became extremely violent, ami ortli
ern statesmen or speakers who came to Vir
Kinia to speak were denounced as low black
guards, maliguants and the vilest of creat
ures. Most of the registrars ami jinlges of
election were put through an examination
to see if they were eoual the emergency
many were removed and the right kind
substituted. It was thought necessary to
purge the lists Isith of the living and the
leail. Fully WI.IMMI legal voters lost their
votes by these registrars dioppimr their
names from the rolls a few da)sptiorto
the election too late to be remedied. This
was especially true in the cities. Kiirht
hundred legal voters' names iu one ward of
Kk'hmoml were erased from the poll Immikh
although they had been voting in the ward
lor v ears. rive liumlrel in the outlying
bstnets of Henrico were dropped in the
same way. In Tact, this tuck was laith
full) carried out all tluough the eastern
part of Virginia, ami then followed the fi
nal work on election dav. In everv pait
of Virginia where the Republican vote was
heavy ami the voters wereroloietl gieat
frauds and intimidation of voters prevailed
In Norfolk. Richmond, and other large
ptaces not moie than our colored voter out
of six was allowed to vote The remainder
stood in line part of the day and waited uu
til the) Iiecamu tltscotirageu, and then lelt,
w lute otheas sUhnI in line from tin rising of
the sun until long after dark and were not
pet milled to vote. Democratic jMilicemen
ami young lawvers were present in force
to intimidate colored voters.
'A1I this teaches a very important lesson,
vi , thut the last lay of hope is rone ff
the Republican party to make any headway
iu the South The ballot Uixes are all in
the hands of Democratic otlicials The
county and eotioratiou judges are ull Detn
ociatic, so that an appeal from an 'election
fraud' of any kind is practically useless;
and so )on ran sic how the 'solid South' is
made solid.
"The Democrats are following up this
year's victory with vigorous persecutions--many
good and true men have been dis
charged by their employers for voting the
Republican ticket. The press advises this
course, and calls umjh Democratic em
plovers to fill every place now held by a Re
publican with a Democrat.
l fought four )ears for an independent
South, but thank (toil I never voted for a
corrupt South. The great danger to the
South now is that violence, trickery, false
hood and perjury being considered worthy
modes of carrying on an election against
the Reuublicaus. the youni; men growing
up and really tiauied to such a standard of
morals in public affairs will adopt a similar
standard fur their lives in private atlairs,
The Democratic leaders of the South know
not what curses they Hie invoking for the
South of the future,'

lining men of the school, who are scattered
alsiut the city in various Isianling houses
until the completion of the huildiug which
is to he their home, were invited to the

weie spent in making acquaintance with
each other, ami enjoying music ami refresh

such a constant drain upon mind, ls.lv and

iug house for two little girls who vvere aux
ions to go to Sunday schisil, hut bsi small
to go nloue The woman having charge of
the house asked us tn go in ami see a sick
Isiy hslgiug there, and after Sunday school
we did so. The Isiy proved to lie alsiut H
yearn old. He had heeu learning the paint
er's trade, ami the paint hail caused a sort
of rheumatism of the muscles, which made
the slightest movement extremely iuful.
He seenusl almost friendless, hut the woman
hefoie mentioned did what she could for
him iu the few moments she could snatch
fiom cnie of her family ami a targe ntimher
of hslgiug risniis , and he was receiving
medical treutmeiit ft tun a flee dispensary.
