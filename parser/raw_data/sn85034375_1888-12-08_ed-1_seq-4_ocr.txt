Maj. Grafton, for many years the

Miss Minnie Talbert, ot Hardy Station
sister of our friend, It. B. Talbert, took

best pound cake and the best white
sponge cake. Young men make a note
of that.- Winona Advance.
The next progressive educational
movement to be lookod for, is the en
dowment of our colleges of a "Base Ball
professorship." The only difficult ques
tion to decide about it, is whether it shall
be a required or elective study—Ex.
The Southerners lost the election, but
they have a big cotton crop, which miti
gates the disaster. You)can'tbave every
thing you want iu the world, but the

The election returns give Cleveland
49 34 per cent, of the entire vote, and
Harrison 4S 05 per cent, leaving but
trifle over 2 per cent for all the other
candidates. The entire vote thrown
was 11,285,825, which is about 1,250,000
over the ponuiar vote of 1884.

A extress, the four months old child
of Mr. and Airs. AY. S. Bell, of MeridiaD,
Miss., died on last Sunday after a short
illness. This bereavement carries gloom
to the bright home of our friends, but by

everlasting life. Take courage, and "be

A prohibition amendment to the con
stitution of West Virginia was submitted
to the people at the recent election, and
was rejected by a majority of 40,000.
This, coupled with Republican gains
there, shows that the Republican party
not the prohibition party. The jug
seems to be equally precious to all par
ties.—Picayune.

MAJ. 1 . KEMP.
Maj. J. B. Kemp, the division super
intendent of the Aberdeen branch of
I. C. K. R. has been appointed superin
tendent of the M. & T. R. R., and will
take charge about Jan. 1, Maj. Kemp
was for some time the efficient and pop
ular depot agent of Grenada. Here he
made many warm friends who will
glad to hear of his appointment' He
an energetic and experienced railroad,
man, and will doubtless give satisfac
tion 10 tile public as well as his employ
ers. He is also a gentleman of varied
information, and social and genial in
his manners. While on this subject, we
would suggest that Maj. Kemp's "storm
or cyclone pit," what he had built here
some years ago, be moved to Memphis,
or a new one built there. We have no
doubt of his physical courage to meet
men and tilings generally, but when
comes to 'storms' or 'cyclones,' he imme
diately yells "oli Lordy !" and down in
,his 'pit' lie goes.
The St. Louis Republic remarks- ' If
the Southern leading newspapers should
publicly advise the Chicago anarchists
to throw bombs at the police and burn
buildings by way of redressing their griev
ances, and should taunt them with lack
of spirit because they uid not persist in
enforcing their notions of their rights by
such means, the Chicago Tribune would
be shocked at it as another exhibition
ol the total depravity of 'Rebel Brigadi
ers.' Yet that is precisely what the
Tribune is preaching to the Southern
negroes when it reproaches them with
not being willing to kill and burn, if
necessary, to assert what they conceive
to be their rights."
Mr. Alfred Daniel of Douglas county,
Ga., is rather a remarkable character. He
is S2 years old, was never sick a day in
bis life, was never in bed at sun up, and
never lost a tooth, has been to six log
rollings this year, lifts more than most
men, often indulges in coon and ' pos
sum hunting, has been a deacon in the
Primitive Baptist church for fifty-eight
years, was never drunk in his life and
an oath never escaped his lips. He is

great-grandchildren,
A good old colored brother is said to
have sent word to the bishop to send a
minister out to his church in Alexandria
valley last Sunday. Ilis request was
worded as follows; "Send us a Bishop
to preach. It you can't send a Bishop
send us a Sliding Elder, if you can't send
Sliding Elder send us a Stationary
Preacher, if you can't send him send us
Circus Rider, if you cant spare him
send us a Locus Preacher, if you can
not spare a Locus Preacher send us an
Exhauster." That settled it, and he got
preacher.—Anniston Watchman.
Newspapers as a general thing, seem to
take a malicious delight in poking all
manner of fun at the bustle, says the
Wynne (Ark.) Ripsaw. Tnis is hardly
right, for the editor of that same pape r
would hold one of the aforesaid bustles,
when properly attached of course, on bis
lap for hours at the time and never think
growing tired.
The President's message, which was
sent to Congress at their meeting last
Monday, is a very long but able docu
ment, and is worthy of perusal by all
persons who wish to know anything
about our public affairs as they now
stand. Elsewhere in this issue will he
found a complete synopsis of the Mes
sage, which reflects a piece of| enterprise
on the part of the Sentinel in getting it
out at this early a day in which few, if
an y wreekly papers in this State can equal.
Senator John L. Morgan has been re
elected United States Senator from Ala
bama as his own successor. Since
Alabama first honored Geu. Morgan
with tlie Senatorial toga in 1877, he has
occupied an advanced place -among the
able men who have represented the
South in that body.—Ex.
President elect Harrison is said to
have engaged pews in all the Presbyteri
an churches at Washington. There is a
method in ins religion. Distinguished
strangers who go to church to worship
God and stare at the American presi
dent will not know where to find him.

"Tlie white people of the South will
rule the South. Intelligence will win.
is ridiculous to pretend that the peo
ple who have the wealth, the people who
have the railways, the people who have
the electric telegraph, the people who
have the steam locomotion, the people
who have the steam navigation, the peo
ple who have the commerce of the
lion are going to he dominated by the
poor and the despised and the illiterate
negro. There is not tlie least danger of
anything of the kind, and I sometimes
think that our ^Southern white people
know that there exists no such danger.
All that the whites of the South have to
is to treat the negro justly, and he
will listen to them before he will listen to
auy other people, from the North or else
where. It is impossible for the negroe
rule: It is impossible."
