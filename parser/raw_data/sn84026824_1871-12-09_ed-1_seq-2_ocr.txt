Supper was excellent and delicious, con
sisting of the substantiate and delicacies
of the .season, including Oysters, sweet
meats. t to., *fcc., and the long table
groaned under the ponderous wiightof
"good things." It is unnecessary to
state that all hands did justice in hiding
away t-he palatable edibles which were
bo proiusely set before us. \\ e are sure
we did our "level best, and so did our

Disastrous Fire In llHgeiatown.
Tlie Baltimore Sun received the fol

Thursday morning at 1 o'clock : ?
Last evening at 10 o'clock a (ire broke
out in the business house of Rollins tfc
1 >iii 'hanks, agricultural implement deal

pot, and rapidly spread to the adjac. nt
buildings. The tlaiucs soon reached
the Episcopal Church and the court
house, ami both were burned to the
ground. All the public records were
saved. Several lives were lost by the
falling of the court-house dome. The
names of the killed are unknown. Oth

rnoM the Chicago Fike. ?
We saw yesterday at the office of the
National Insurance Company of this
city two impressive mementos of the
great Chicago conflagration in the shape
of two policies calling for several thou
sand dollars, that our amiable friend
Uisliop, the Secretary of the National,
had just paid oft* sixty days ahead of
time. We are happy to say that the
National is one of those reliable con- j

and si ill have a "few more left" to re

QrKEK Kki.io. ? The bed and mat
tress on which President Lincoln died,
was sold at public auction last week,
and brought $80. A restaurant keep
cr was the purchaser, and intends to
keen it as a relic of the great tragedy at
Fords Theatre. The family that
owned it were greatly annoyed by visi
tor constantly calling at the house to
seethe room and furniture in which
Mr. Lincoln died, and the family were
obliged to get rid of it by leaving the
house and selling the furniture. .

The snow oil the Union Pacific rail
road is reported still drifting. The
freight train going wot struck a snow
drift to day west of Sherman, which
piled freight cars together in ruins.
Several other trains are reported off the
track or disabled west of Cheyenne.
Some of the passengers now at Laramie
complain of t lie bad treatment of the
divi.Mon superintendent and the hotel
keeper at Laramie. The train which
left here on Saturday last was blocked
in the snow at Pine Bluff. and returned
to Sidney this afternoon to await the
clearing of the track. The train due
here from the West on Sunday was
I fastened in the snow at Elm Creek on
Sunday and Monday, but is expected
here this evening. A number of en
gines are reported off the track between
here and Cheyenne forced of by snow
drifts. The Western end of the road is
in a still worse condition, and the road
is practically blocked lbr the present.
It is said that if a puff of uir were
blown into a vt in of an animal, death
would instantaneously follow, because
circulation would be stopped. The
blood makes the entire circuit of the hu
man body every seven minutes, and
i whenever this circulation is impeded
; or anv of its channels are closed by
, impurities which ought to be carried
oil", disease follows ? fever or a disorder
of liver or kidneys, or scrofula, or dys
pepsia. To get :it and remove the
i source oi the difficulty, use the old and

her says, that one of her most common
manias is to recompose the Court of

The battle-flag of the First Virginia
Cavalry, presented by sergent Ziminer
; man, of the 14th Louisiana Infantry,
who kindly loaned the same for exhibi
tion to the lovers of "The Lost Cause,'
to Mr. Steavens. We observed that the
flag was pierced and torn with many a
battle mark, which in several places had
i been literally cut into ribbons. This
flag was preserved by sergent Zimmer
man in the heat of conflict at the last
i charge at Appomattox Court-House,
; when its capture appeared certain. Sic

Going Back on Tiiem. ? The female
I suffragists lately had a set-back in the
j decision of Judge Carter, in Washing
ton, to the effect that while they are, by
the constitution and laws, "citizens,"
| no provison has been made by the laws
; of Congress to confer on them the elee
j five franchise in the District ? the right
, to vote not necessarily adhering to citi
, zenship. But the hardest blow to the
{ fair suffragists is given in tiie Territory
j of Wyoming, where the council have
voted to repeal the law legalizing the
I experiment of female voting. It is
feared the ladies have been behaving
badly off there; else why this withdrawal
of their new franchise? It is suspected
the experiment didn't work well, not
withstanding it was to do so much to
purify the political atmosphere.

For the Hegisler.
INTEMPERANCE.
We 1. ave been informed that the dis
sipation, drinking and drunkenness, in
cident to this season of the year, lias al
ready commenced, and that it culmina
ted in unusual excesses on Saturday
night last. It seems as if some men are
determined to ruin themselves, that they
will not profit by instruction and expe
rience. Can or will some man who
habitually drinks, tell us what good re
sults l'rom it f Does it l?eneht his
health ? establish a character for prompt
ness and reliability in business ? increase
his means ? add to his fortune ? make
him a more useful member of society ?
lay a firm basis on which he can build
his hopes of future happiness in this
world ? and what is pre-eminently im
portant, dues it prepare him for death
and eternity ? If it neither tends to, or
accomplishes any of these good things,
why will men persevere in thi> awful
practice, which never has or can 4" any
good in any way ? All evil ! Nothing
but evil ! So says the Bible, common
sense, and all experience.
This is a serious Question. May it be
seriously considered and answered, each
man for himself, in view of his ohliga
t ions t?? his God, to society, to his fami
ly. and to himself.
Why have these disgraceful scenes ?
these wicked deeds, commenced much
earlier than usual '! What is to be done
to el eck or prevent them, are solemn,
important questions, that ought to be
answered.
We ask and wait anxiously for rc
plies. A. tSi Z.
"West \ iimmsia. ? The Wheeling
Kegister, a leading journal in \\ tst
Virginia, says :
''It is perhaps needless to remark that
Wot Virginia does not just yet recog
nize her liability for one-third of the
public debt of Virginia, notwithstand
ing her territory and population may be
one-third of the former population and
territory of the State. We are willing
to abide the decision of the commission
ers legally appointed to ascertain what
amount of debt we shall assume, but
there is no use in disguising the fact that
the people of West \ irginia will be
greatly astonished if it is adjudged that
one-third of the debt is justly due from
this State. West \ irginia is quite as 1
willing as the old Commonwealth to j
consider all the equities, and be guided
by them in determining what portion of
the debt she should assume, but the
Whig is eertanly mistaken insupposing
that the conn ties composing \\ est \ ir
ginia have drawn from the treasury, in
excess of the taxes they have paid, a sum
equal to the whole debt of the State, or
that Mr. Hennctl entertains such an
| opinion."
The Washington correspondent ot

' three eonnnissioners who were author
i/A-d to sell. Two questions were in
volved?the validity of the law ami tin
validity of the deed. The Court sua |
tained both, and held that as the sale
was made l?y a public act. it was entire
lv competent for two of the three coin- j
tnissioners to convey a title. 1 he virtu- ,
I al e fleet of this decision is to give all

The .Meeting of CoitgrMi.
The second session of the Forty-Sec
ond Congress commenced yesterday at
Washington, with a quorum in both
houses. As the officers of both houses
had been chosen at the previous short
session, there was no delay in proceed
ing to business, In the Senate, James
L. Alcorn, late Governor of Mississippi, '
took his seat as a Senator from that
State. The credentials of Thomas M.
Norwood, Senator elect from Georgia,
whose seat is contested bv Foster Mod
?reft, were laid on the table to await re 1
*7 4
lercnce to an appropriate committee. A
bill providing for civil service reform
was introduced. Mr. Sumner urged
that his civil rights bill should betaken
up and passed at an early day. The >
matter of the suspension of Gen. Plea
santon. late commissioner of internal
revenue, was called up and laid over
for executive session. The I lodge de
falcation, the Indian policy ? ?t the ad
ministration and the Chicago file relief
were alluded to. Mr. Sumner introduc
ed his currency bill, authoii/.ing the i>
sne of compound interest notes a* a sub
stitute for legal tender notes, which he
contends will conduct to specie pay
ments, '"the suspension of which was
equally a war measure with the draft
and the suspension of habeas corpus.
Mr. Jilair introduced a resolution that
the President be requested to inform
the Senate under what law he suspend
ed the writ of habeas corpus in South
Carolina, and especially that he lay be
fore the Senate ail acts of insurrec
tion, resistance or opposition to the
laws of the I 'nited States upon which
his proclamation suspending the habeas
corpus was based, and also that he re
port in detail the military arrests ; laid
over. The President's message was
read, and th" Senate adjourned.
The Mouse of liopresentativcs met

from the Distrtct of Columbia, was'
swoin in. The Speaker announced the
standing committees. A resolution to
print 20,00 ) copies of the treaty of
Washington, with accompanying docu
ments, was referred. A resolution sim
ilar to that introduced in the Senate,
inquiring of the President by what law
he su>pended the writ of habeas corpus
in South Carolina, was reti-ned to the .
committee on insurrectionary States. A
bill was introduced for the n pea! of the
income tax. The Mouse adopted ares
olution that government mechanics and
laborers, whose pay had been "docked"
after the passage of the eight-hour law,
be paid the full amount which would
have accrued to them had they worked
ten hours. The Speaker submitted to
the Mouse the question whether ihe
committee on the District of Columbia
should consist of eight or nine members
besides the delegate from the District,
which was referrod to the committee on
rules. The Prssident's message was
then received and read, and the Mouse

A Su> I.i i i:. ? For the last twenty
years there has lived in a cave in Sa
line county, Kentucky, entirely alone, a
singular character named Franklin El
liott, of whose p:*dt life nothing was
known; only it was surmi.-ed from his
commanding, proud face and cultivated
expression, which his wretchedness was
unable entirely to conceal, that he was
the wreck of a once envied manhood.
Once or twice in a year lie would come
into town, and with as few words as
possible barter game or pelts for powd? r,
shot, and salt ? nothing more. Winn
he saw people approaching he w ould
always avoid them.
A short time ago two gentlemen were
hunting in the forest near the cave
where he lived, and a storm coining up
they knocked for admission. Hearing
no answer, they opened the iron-bound
door and saw a heap of skins and
blankets, the hermit lying dead. The
cave was commodious, having been en
larged by himself from a small hole to
an apartment twenty live feet square
and ten or twelve feet high, but quite
void of furniture. Pieces of stone and
niches in the ro< kv wails served as
chairs, tables, and shelves. A ritle and
fowling piece were found, a long broad
bowie knife, fishing tackle, cooking
utensils, and a number of books. A
mong the latter were copies of Slink -

more interest was found ? a tin box till

his next misfortune wa* to light a duel
with a man named Daily, to whom the
result was fatal. The laws of Kentucky
wet'tt lax against dueling, and he had no
trouble in going abroad, staying in Eit

brought him back to the solitude of

Tlie third annual message oi l'resi.
dent Grant, the test of which was re
ceive,! in this city by telegraph shortly
after its delivery to Congress yesterday, ,
opens with a reiteration of the H'l>
announced in his inauguia in
"The policy has been not to impure -
to the wisdom ot the laws already ei -
acted, but to learn their spirit and in
tent. and to en to roe them accost ing y
_a sentiment which. if lxterall v adhered
to. would preclude the Executive from
making many useful recommendations
for the repeal or modification ot ,
found to be bad. # c
The exceptional calamities by
and flood which have marked the past
vear. and which have ltd to the display
of so much active benevolence and gen
erous sympathy at home and abroad,
receive appropriate mention, while the
year is recognized to have been. mi. i r
ii wiso Providence. one of general pros
perity to the nation." .
Under the head of foreign relations,
the country is properly congratulated
upon the beneficial effects likely to re
Milt from the treaty of Washington,
both as a settlement ot our dtnerciiceS
with (.treat Britain, anil as an cxampi ?
to the world how wars may be ayoidca
without a sacrifice of national honor.
Credit is given to our diplomatic and
consulars agents at Paris lor the man
ner in which they have pertormed their
delicate duties without wounding the
susceptibilities of Ktcnch ?r Germans
during the trying scenes in r ranee ot
the past twelve months.
Some surprise will doubtless be fed
to ti nd M. Catacazy elevated to the dig
uitv of a national grievance, and the
purelv personal difficult ics " t"11 11 '
obnexious envoy and thea..mim>tia ion
at Washington deemed worthy ot
place in the President's message. In

Genet during the admmmiration ot
Washington, and of Mr. trampton.dur
in<r the Crimean war, it was the uoia
t *n mi of law rat her "than ot personal or
diplomatic propiieties, which
the censure ot the Kxceutne. am w m 1
was brought to the attention ot the na
tion. Beferenee is mr.de to the ?"
matic failure in Cor. a and to the suc
cess achieved by Admiral Kogers over
a semi-barbarous people, and the whole
subject is left "for such action as ton
gress mav see tit to take. .
The al'oliti' 11 of slavery by Bni7.il >s
made the subjcct of presidential con
irrat illation, and the enactment by t on
?f ;v Stringent law is reeomniendi d
t"o reach the case of Ameiican citizens
| who in their business dealings with
planters and others in count rits when*
slavery is still tolerated by law, may
beconie interested as mortgagees or oth
or wise in tliis sj.ecies ot property.
The rumors which have been rife ot
pending difficulties with Spain, and
possible intervention in the affairs ot
(. uha, find no countenance in w hat is
said in the message upon these heads.
Turning from foreign to domestic at
fairs, the tirst and most important re
commendation Ot the message is that
both the tariff and internal laws Ik? mod
ified, with a view to lightening the bur
dens at | resent imposed upon the coun
try. It is recommended that "all taxes
from internal revenue sou re. s be abol
ished, except those collected from spir
ituous. vinous ami malt li.juors. tobacco
in its various forms, and from stamps,
which amounts to a tacit recommenda
tion to abolish the income tax. In any
readjustment of the tariff it is recom
mended that those articles not produced
at home, but which enter largely into
general consumption through medicines,
compounds, & el, and trom which liti.e
revenue is derived, should be placed on
the free list, and that "should a further
reduction be deemed ad\ isable, U should
be made upon those articles which can
best bear it without disturbing home
production or reducing the wages of
American labor.' Ibis latter lecom
mendation has the merit of being so ex
eeedinglv general that it probably "til
..jve no offense e\en to the most ardent
protectionists. For particulars upon
this head Congress is referred to the re
port of the Secretary of' the Treasury.
The fluctuations in the currency are dc
p'.und. and the wisdom of Coiigrtf-s is
invoked to find a remedy, which is the
nearest the President comes to showing
any concern upon the subject ot specie
payments. The message rein rate* the
condemnation heretofore pronounced
by the Secretary of the Treasury upon
the present infamous system ot moieties
to informers in the revenue s?r\icc ot
the country ? a system which, while con
demned in theory, is said in practice,
however, to flourish exceeding.
In the navy the employment of super
numerary officers in the merchant ser
vice, (as in England and other coun
tries,) and that promotion above the
rank of captain be made by selection in
stead of seniority (as at present) seem to
he recommendations worthy the atten
tion of Congress.
The plan of uniting the telegraph ser
vice with th?* ordinary postal K*-r\ i?-?- of
the country i> urged upon the favorable
i confederation of Congress, as recom
mended by the Postmaster General.
The revenues of the depart merit con
; tinue to improve.
The measure* taken for the enforce
! merit ot the Ku-Klux law are next re
J viewed. The proclamation of October
17 is justified upon the ground that the
requirements of the proclamation of Oc
tober 12 requiring the members of tin
lawful combinations within five dav? to
surrender "all their arms, ammunition,
uniforms, disguises, and other means
and implements used by them for carry -
I ing out their unlawful purposes" had
not been complied with. The existence
of the "unlawful combinations," "pur
pose*. "arms," "uniforms' and "imple
ments" is taken for granted. "A regu
lar trial in the judicial tribunals of the
L nited States" is promised the parties
who have been arrested, in numbers
some hundreds, and we may add al-o
; their conviction, inasmuch as it is add
ed : "It is believed that no innocent
person is now in custody." If a "regu
lar" trial is to take place, the question
o i guilt or innocence, one would have
supposed, might have been left to the
"judicial tribunals." A reign of terror
j having been inaugurated, the fact that
' numbers of persons have "absconded,"
is assumed to be "good ground for sup
posing that all such j?eraons have viola
te* 1 the law."
The suppression of prlvgamy in Utah,
with a provision for the legitimization
of "in.iocent children" up to a certain
date, is suggested ? the latter only "as a
suggestion, not a recommendation."
The '"peace policy " heretofore adopted
by tho administration with reference to
the Indians, (though somewhat varied
in practice by exploits like those of the
"Piegan" massacre) is recommended to
be adhered to, "not only because it j?
humane, Christian-like and economical,
but because it is right."
Political amnesty is recommended,
upon the ground, apparently, that no
goenl comes from excluding a particular
class of men from office 1h cause thev
had violated their oath to support the
constitution, while thousands who
wcnld 1'ivo ?'^ue so had they been in
the same position are admitted to be el
igible. It is added, "It there are any
great criminals distinguished above all
others for the part they took in opposj.
tion to the government, they might, in
the judgment of Congress, be excluded
from sncli amnesty." It is needless to
rcmai k that such amnesty would not be
??general." anp that the very "excep
tions ' woul go far to defeat its etl'eet.
Kegn t itr\i rrs-M'l that the old citizen*
of the South ru States should not take a
more promincut part in public attaint,
but the causes which hinder them from
so doing seem to be imjxilVctly com
prehetidcd. The wrttched misrule el
tho carpet -bag governments of those
now upheld by lvu Klux legisla
tion, has far more to do with their pre
?eiit "ui^iappy condition" than any feel
ing of ;KTso??al hostility or "social ostra
cisin" on the part of the older inhabi
tants toward those who differ with them
in political M utuuents Natural causes,
such as climate, soil, and the state of
the labor question, with present mal-ad
ministration. ha\e quite as inueb to di>
w ith retarding "immigration and the
flow of much needed capital ' into t ho
South as any of the causes which the
Pit sident cntiim rales.
In conclusion. the President declares
himself in favor of such ci\il service re
form as will \ . -it the responsibility for
bad appointments upon those who re
commend improper persons for ollice t??
the appointing pow? r. lie refers to the
commission appointed under the :ut ? >t
Congress of March 31, 1^71, to Ucvisr
regulations lor the re form ol the ii\il
service, and promises to give to tho ex
peiimcnt a fair trial.
Taken as a whole, the message is of
moderate length, simple and unpreten
tiotr< in its style, rather negative than
positive in its merits, and certainly Icsm
aggressive i:i it* tone and recommenda
tions than might have been apprehend
ed, and perhaps, by a certain class of
political extremists and factionists, was
deMied. ? liuliimorr ^un, l)tc. 5 lit.
