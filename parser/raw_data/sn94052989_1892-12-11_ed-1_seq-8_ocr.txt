CAN'T BE PUNISHED.
Violation of the Exclusion Act Not
a Crime.
A New Orleans Circuit Judge Defines
the Geary Act- Deportation Is
the Onl\ Redress.
Bycelal to Tax MoHNi.ts Calx.
New Orleaks, D«c. 10.— Judge Billings
Id the United States Circuit Court quashed
tb« indictments against several Chinese for
violating the exclusion act, aod defined the
powers of Governmrnt officials. lie laid In
brief:
"The statute relied upon by the pros
centlng offlceri ii found in the fourth sec
tion of the act of Congress of May 5, 1892.
That statute, it nams to me, deals with the
coming in of Chinese as a police matter, and
H Is the re-enactm* and continuing of what
■Ight be termed a quarantine against the
Chinese. They are treated as would be in
fected merchandise, and Imprisonment is
set puuishment for a crime, but the means
•f keeping the damaging individual safely
till he can ba sent away. In a summary
■tanner and as a political- matter this
eemlng in is to be prevented. The matter
It dealt with as political and not criminal.
The word* used are those ordinarily found
in the Criminal Statutes. But the intent of
Congress is, as it seems to be unmistakable,
that after the unlawful presence of an alien
la determined, he must be sent back to his
country by the Treasury Department at
Washington, and to prevent unreasonable,
and possibly oppressive detention, it must
be within one year. Meanwhile he must be
kept from entering' the community of the
people of the United States, and therefore
la to be imprisoned to prevent expense to
the Government and as sanitary matter be
la to be made to work.
•This, it seems to me. Is the meaning of
the clause relied upon to authorize the trial
and punishment for a crime. There Is
nothing in the statute declaring It shall be a
crime or a misdemeanor for a Chinaman to
come into this country. Unlawfulnoss is not
made the basis of criminal procedure or de
ttntioD, but rather made a warrant to scud
kirn back. The imprisonment spoken of in
tbe atatute is that which is necessary to
effectuate bis return. It seems to me that
Mcticn 4 deals with proceedings before
tbe commissioner conducting an examina
tion, which is political and not criminal,
aod amounts to a direction to him, and the
authorities who conduct tbe transportation
•r removal back to China, aud is two-fold—
first, that the Chinese adjudged to be here
unlawfully shall be removed within a. year,
and, secondly, that until tbe removal he
•ball be kept in prison and made to work.
"In accoidance with these views I must
direct that this indictment be quashed, aid
ibal the defendant be remanded to the cus
tody of the •ommissioner to be doalt with
according to law.

A LIVELY BATTLE.
HcAuliffe and flyer Have a Setto in
Chicago.
CJhicago. Dec. 10.— Jack McAuliffe, the
cbampiou lightweight of tbe world, and
Billy Myer, bis old antagonist, came to
gether at the Second Regiment Armory for
six rounds to-night. The setto was ex
ceedingly lively, and the men needed but
alight encouragement to turn the boxing
match into a regular fight. It was 10:30
o'clock when VlcAuliffe, who was received
with loud cheers, clambered through the
ropes. He was followed five minutes later
by Myer, who received a still warmer greet
ing. The gloves were said to be five-ounce.
In the first round the men took it easy, al
though Myer got in a hard one on the head.
In the second round McAuliffe landed
lightly on Myer's ear. Tbe latter came
back at him, but time was called. Tbe
crowd disapproved in vigorous .style, as the
round was not over a minute long.
In tbe third round Myer jabbed Mc-
Auliffe bard in the face. He dodged an i
slipped, falling to his knees, and when he
got up he received several more hot ones.
McAuliffe opened the fourth round by
crowding Myer around and forcing him to
tbe roDea. In rhe fifth round McAuliffe
landed repeatedly on Myer's stomach.
Neither would give ground and they banged
away savapely, Myer's blows being as hard
as his antagonist's. Clinches were numer
ous and the men were separated twice.
\\ hen time was called and the contest over
neither man was marked and both were
fresb and looking for more.

The Ogre of Protection in
England.
FARMERS NOW EMBRACE IT.
Threatened Rapprochement Between
the Artisans and Agriculturists.
Bimetallism Not Possible.
Special to The Mobxixs Calu
New York. Dec. 10.— Smalley's cable
letter to tho Tribune contains tb« following:
The Ribot Cabinet in France is a sur
prise to everybody, including Ribot himself,
lie was talked of last February, before
Carnot discovered Loubett, but was not then
asked. Ho is able, but perhaps adventur
ous; nor Is It thought judicious that the
Foreign Minister should also be President
of the Council. Toe use of the President
of the Council is to keep the Ministers in
order— to moderate their zeal— an apply two
minds instead of one to difficult questions.
Ribo', moreover, Is a liut partisan of the
Franco - Russian alliance. It may be
doubted whether St. Petersburg will receive
his appointment with enthusiasm. The aim
of St. Petersburg is to tame the friendship
of Pans not to stimulate it. Nor is this
moment when a Minister with a future, as
Rihot has, or Lad, need care to become
Fiitr.e Minister. There is no sure promise
of stability for his or any otber ministry.
The Chamber is completely out of hand.
Parties are split up. The various factions
of tbe Republicans are more ltreconcilibly
hostile to one another than to the Royalists,
The Panama question must be faced. The
Radicals thought they were coining in by
l.eiu of the Panama scandal, and are not
pleased with tbe turn things are taking, nor
is Brisson, as a politician, pleated. The
probabilities of elevating the Panama com
mittee into a committee of public safety are
somewhat diminished.
President liarrisou's message provokes a
curious outburst of Eujjlish spleen. What
the Eiiglsh papers Bay of it is what tbe
Democratic press in America might be ex
pected to say. The comment is ; purely par
tisan. Tiie English hostility to Harrison is
as marked as the English friendship to
Cleveland, and both aro fur the same
reason. They knew tlmt Harrison aud the
Republican party could be relied on to pro
tect American interests. Tlmy know that
under Cleveland's rule British interest! are
once more t» be favorably considered. Of
the generosity to a defeated opponent, there
Is no traoe in these British remark*.
The proceedings of tbe natlounl agricul
tural conference held In London Wednes
day and Thursday may be Hummed up in
two words, "protection and bimetallinni."
Protection will not down. Just as America
is supposed to have given this hated princi
ple a iintl blow It lifts Its horrid form in St.
James Hall in London, and an out-and-out
protectionist resolution Is carried unani
mously, or almost unanimously, amid thun
dering cheers.
Who are the men who carried it? Admit
tedly the conference is the representative
and most powerful and Important assembly
of farmers in Great Britain. It is com
posed of delegates from more than 240
es'cciations in England, Scotland and Ire
land. B< th farmers and laborers were del
egates, tnough the laborers seem to have
been very few. The wbnls number of Jel
egates present exceeded 2000. An tx-Cabl
net Minister presided and another Cabinet
Minister was chief speaker.
The press reports It at great length, and
discusses with something like true sense
the gravity of the occasion. Tne agricul
tural interest is still, as one of them says
almost sorrowfully, the greatest, as it Is
the oldest, of British industries. It is suf
fering, and has long been suffering, from
extreme depression, and now with one voice
It declares that there is no remedy for Its
misfortuoe.3 aud no escape from ruin other
than protection.
When Salisbury pronounced this word at
Hastings his party revolted, or at any rate
the party organs and fanatics of free trade
said it revolted. Ha was rebuked in lan
guage of the utmost solemnity. IJe was
thought to have contributed something to
the defeat of his partr, which followed
fast upon his Hastings ipe6«h, and I*, her*
Is half of Eugland echoius the cry of the
late Prime nster.
Half of England Is a rhetorical expres
sion, but if you consider what tue landed
Interest in this country mean* apd repre
sents it is hardly an extravagant expres
sion. There i», at any rate, no question of
party or parly politics In this resent move
ment. It is too serious for politics. It is
an <ffort of naif-ruined and half-desperata
men who have long appealed for help to
others and are now trying to help them
selv
Their real difficulty Is far nioro serious
than hostility of doctrinaires. The farm
ers would make short work of the doctrin
aires if they had nobudy behind them.
Their difficulty is that in this country pro
tection means two thing*, one thing to the
farmer and another to the artisan. The
farmer cau only bo saved by a tax on food,
and to a tax on focd the artimn will never
consent, unless he ee.ts an equivalent In
come from protection that would raise his
wages. If they could ncree they would
toon revise England's tariff .vs.
The resolution of the conference makes
an attempt to meet this difficulty. It begins
with the assertion that unfair coruDetltion,
ofuntaxed foreign Imports with home prod
uce and manufactures advanely affects
every trade and industry in this country.
It is plausibly put, but the artisan nt
thirty shilling* a week wants to know what
it would mean lv the price of a loaf. The
farmers, moreover, have weakened their
case and arranged almost the whole finan
cial world against them by their adoption
of bimetallism. The double load it too
heavy. Protection In England, remotest
it may be, is a conceivable thing; bimetal
lism is not.
But who could expect a body of plain
farmers to resist the sonorous eloquence
and captivating manners of Henry Chaplin.
No more affecting spectacle ins ever been
seen in public life than that of Chaplin,
Salisbury's Minister of Agriculture, pub
licly ombraoing Archbishop Walsh, and
commending hid to an English, avipmbly as
an authority In finance. It is Dr. Walsh's
merit— a merit which in Chaplin's eyes
atones for his political heresies—to nave
discovered tint the true cause of Ireland's
woes is the increase in the value of gold, and
the tru* remedy for thtm— bimetallism.
WORK AT BRUSSELS.
The Conference Yet Considering
Plans.
Austria has No Fear o! Disastrous
Results Following the Failure
of the Meeting.
6p«elal to Tri Morning Cali.
Brussels, Dec. 10.— At to-day's meeting
of the committee of the international mon
etary conference the plans of Tietjens,
Houldswor.h and Allard were debated.
Although the bimetaliist delegates feel that
the position Is critical, they are hopeful the
conference will not aaj^uru without adnpu
ing a resolution recommending the various
Governments interested to adopt a tem
porary modus Vivendi with the view of
averting a financlr.l catastrophe.
Before the conference proper Tirard of
the French delegation explained His position
in regard to bimetallism. lie said that
under the present circumstances there was
do chance to substitute bimetallism for
monometallism. Each country had the
remedy In its own hands by Increasing the
coinage of silver. If every country in
creased its coinage of silver to twenty
francs per capita, which is less than
half o! France's total coinage of silver, the
amount of silver in circulation would be
enormously Increased.
The committee adjourned without reach
ing a decision on any of the plan 9.
Rondos, Dec. 10.-Tbe Standard's Vienna
special says: The probable failure of the
monetary conference Is so discounted here
that the failure will ninke no impression.
The principal Austro-Hungarian papers
ridicule the prophecy of terrible conse
quences, contending that any action such
as is foreshadowed in President Harrison's
message would be a breach of faith toward
creditors, which public opinion in America
would not permit. Neither Democrats nor
Republican*. It Is aaid, dare repeal the Wiu
dom act for fear of an unparalleled commer
cial crisis. Meantime tbe removal ot the
hope of an International agreement for
many years to come will exert a healthy
Influence in checking the output of stiver,
and prices will gradually find a level with
out harming anybody except the American
silver kings. Practical experience in the
transformation of silver currency to gold
currency resulted In converting passionate
bimetalllsts to the view that the rehabilita
tion of silver would fail to remove the root
of the causes of agricultural depression.
THE SHERMAN ACT.
Senator Teller Says It Should Not Be
Repealed.
Washingtok, Dec. 10.— Senator Teller,
one of the warmest champions of sliver, is
very decidedly opposed to the repeal of the
Sherman silver law, and looks upon the bill
Introduced by llill a 9 a menace to the while
metal.
"1 am opposed to any interference with the
Sherman act," said Teller, "for any repeal
of that lk\v means r further depredation of
silver. Of coinse the law is not what it
ought to be, aud we have always looked
upon it as a temporary expedient; but it
affords some relief. Until somethiug better
aud more peimaueut is given us, stiver men
would naturally ba opposed to its repeal.
The Hill bill or any similar measure would
depreciate silver even lower thau It new is
and inciease the evil instead of remedy
ing it."
Teller thinks there will be no attempt at
silver legislation tiiis tension. Certainly
not until after the Brussels conference has
reached some conclusion. "It that con
ference." continued Teller, "does not do
anythinglooking to the relief of the situa
tion, then wo must do it. I am hopeful,
however, that the conference will accom
plish something, although it seems probabln
now that it will ndj urn over until spring."
Referring to the President's message,
Teller said he could not understand what
the President meant by saving we oould
meet the Euiopean demand for our gold by
legislation. "We are a dubtor nation," ob
served the Senat>r, "aud cannot dictate
term", much less legislate to suit ourselves
in the matter."
