THE II A HT LEY PAIlDnS.
Under this caption the Nebraska In
dependent, the otllclal oman of the pop
tilists of this shite, makes the specific?
charge that ?.';.,000 has been offered t
Induce Coventor Poyntor to grant
pardon to the Into embezzling state
treasurer, .loseph S. Hartley. This
charge is coupled with the followln
comment, which demands prompt and
positive disclaimer Insofar as It con
corns The Ueo and Its editor:
Those- who have been opposed to Oovcrno
I'oyntcr have been lu the habit of bringing
tho accusation that ho "was a weak man.'
Somo distinguished Kontlcmcu met with a
surpriso lately when they ihoufiht to bank
on Ills reported weakness. A very larpo
sum or money was raised to sccuro Hart
ley s pardon. It was largo enough to get
an agreement for silence from tho three
great dallies of the state Tho Ilee, tho
World-Herald and tho Stato Journal bo
sides J35.000 to bo paid cash down. Thcro
were a lot moro who havo pre
tended to bo populists or demo
crats (for revenuo only) whose In
flucnce was obtained. They wrote letters
to theso dallies demanding Hartley's par
don. When populists and democrats (who
were not so for revenue) asked tho Dermis
slon to reply, they were refused. Thcro
wero other editors who signed tho Hartley
petition. H was also presented to the In
dependent, but tho prcicnter got no slgna
turcs la this ofllcc.
Tho action of tho World-Herald In this
matter will call to mind the tlmo when It
sold the uso of Us columns to tho renub
llcans In the mtdst of a campaign. Hotter
things were expected of Tho Hee. whose
editor sometimes has opinions different
from tho other republican bosses and dares
to express them. Hut this tlmo there
seems lo havo been enough In It to stop
Ilosowater's mouth. Ho has been as dumb
as an oyster.
To this Indictment Tho Ueo pleads not
guilty. During a career covering
period of more than a ipiarter of a cen
tury nobody has yet been able to muzzle
The lice, either for money or any other
valuable consideration. It will hardly
be necessary for The Ree to prove an
alibi to refute the report that It has been
caught sleeping In the same bed with
the World-Herald and Lincoln Journal
If the "distinguished gentlemen" who
are said to havo npproached Governor
Poyntor with a $a,000 purse pretended
that they had bought the silence of The
Hee they simply Indulged In pure llctlon
In order to persuade the governor to
swallow the bait. If, as Is asserted by
the otllclal organ of Nebraska populism
theso missionaries exhibited 00,000
names attached to tho Hartley petition,
tho name of tho editor of The Ilee was
certainly not on the list. One other
thing Is also curtain the "distinguished
gentlemen" who had taken this benev
olent task upon themselves wero dis
creet enough not to tako tho editor of
Tho Hoc into their confidence.
While It was currently rumored that
an attempt wus to be made to secure a
pardon for Hartley, no action has been
taken under tho law requiring notice by
publication that would call for comment
or discussion on tho part of tho press.
No letters for or against the proposed
pardon have been presented for Inser
tion in The Hee and hence none have
been either published or rejected.
Whether other papers havo been sub
Bldized In Hartley's interests we have no
means of knowing, but wc do know
that the Intimation that tho silence of
fhe Hee has beeu bought is absolutely
baseless.
CO-OVEliA T1VK HOME lWlLDUa.
If additional evidence Is needed to
show the substantial foundation of
prosperity In Nebraska and the marvel
ous recovery lu all lines of trade and
industrv from this disasters of seven
years ago, It Is supplied by tho report of
the condition of building and loan asso
ciations, complied by tho secretary of
the Stato Banking board. Tho report.
a summary of which has been published
n The Hee, shows the condition of these
associations at the close of the ilscai
year, Juno 30, 1900, and presents many
facts of uncommon Interest.
For tho tlrst tlmo lu llvo years the
report shows a substantial Increase in
the busiuess of home building asso
ciation. They did uotf feel the full ef
fect of business depression until ISltt,
when their assets approximated $-1,000,-000.
During tho four years following
they showed a steady decline, nnd not
until the last fiscal year did they feel to
an appreciable extent tho widespread
improvement In business. While tho
aggregate assets of the sixty associa
tions Is yet $La'J.r22 below the high
water mark of 1S05, the report shows
they have made a uet gain of ?:i01,r7r
In one year, lu receipts tho Increase
was if.'OD.im and in mortgage loans
$.'1:1,557. Equally favorable Is the re
duced amount of cash on hand, Indicat
ing steady demand for money, and a
decreaso of $02,000 lu the real estate ac
count. Although tho number of asso
ciations lu the stato has fallen from
eighty-six lu 1801 to sixty at present,
the number of" shares lu force has stead
ily grown from 71,231 lu 18!H to 105,025
In 1000, ludlcatlug a membership of
10,000, tho largest In tho history of the
state. Tho present number of associa
tions have, therefore, a fur greater con
stituency, over 30,000 more shares lu
force, are rearing moro homes nnd have
resources almost equaling the high record
of 1S05. A very flattering exhibit,
surely fluttering nllke to the associa
tions and to the fostering euro of the
stato In preventing nn influx of wildcat
concerns from other states, and In hold
ing In check speculative tendencies at
home.
Secretary Hall's recommendation ac
companying tho report deserves the
earnest consideration of tho Incoming
legislature. Tho law governlug build
ing and loan associations places them
under tho supervision of tlio Stnto Hunk
Ing iKiard. The secretary and tho ex
aminers appointed by tlio board, who
have to deal with theso associations,
uro required by the banking law to
have had, respectively, two and three
years' practical experience In banks or
in the Stato Hanking board. This dis
crimination works a hardship on build
ing and loan associations, Inasmuch as
It subjects them to the supervision of
men without exiwrleneo In their busi
ness and Ignorant of tho principles on
which they are grounded. Secretary
Hall urges that tho legislature remedy
tho Injustice by providing for a sop-

nroto examiner, who should be expert
enced in their management and who
should be given a fixed salary and not
left dependent on the vicious fee sys
teni that now prevails.
No serious hardship hus yet been
worked by the discriminating quallllea
Hon required for examiner. This 1
not tlio fault of the law. It due to
tho men heretofore appointed. Ueed
the associations of Nebraska have bee
peculiarly fortunate, both in tho law
enacted for their government and lu th
oftlcers delegated to give them effect
The present otllcers hnvo shown thorough
comprehension of the principles o
building and loan associations and hav
always been lu full sympathy with
their aims, otllclal sympathy did not
however, relax efforts to hold them
within tho bounds of safety or sauctioi
ppeciilatlve Innovations. This Is shown
In tho rules prohibiting separate expense
funds and discrediting auxlllnry board
operated by state-wide associations.
The marked Improvement lu the coudl
t ion of associations at tho present tlim
Is largely traceable to tho fostering
care of tho suite, and a fair measure o
credit Is due to the energy and common
seuso methods of Secretary Hall.
milTlHll VOLWr is south afuica
A few days ago Mr. Balfour said In
the House of Commons that no member
of tho cabinet had ever said that he had
even dreamed the Hoer republics would
remain permanently under the crown
colony form of government. "That re
strlcted phase of liberty," said tho gov
eminent leader In the House, "will only
bo necessary as a temporary expedl
out." The speech of Mr. Chamberlain
secretary for the colonies, on Friday
made still more plain the purpose of the
government to give the people of the
lute republics n civil administration, In
which they may participate, as soon as
possible. Mr. Chamberlain said It was
hoped this might be done beforo the
house met ugulu, which will be in Feb
ruary next.
The colonial secretary declared that
the government Is not animated by vln
dlctlvencss against tho men in arms and
that It had laid down three objects
These are to end tho guerrilla warfare,
to Institute a crown government when
the conflict Is ended, and ultimately to
give the people self-governnieut. In re
gard to the charges of barbarism made
against the Hrltlsh. Mr. Chambcrlnln
offered n general denlnl, declaring that
'never In history had a war been waged
with so much humanity." As to this,
however, there Is so much trustworthy
testimony lu support of the chnrges that
the coloulal secretary's denlnl will not
bo generally accepted. It may be true
that there has been exaggeration as to
the burning of farms nnd unquestiona
bly tho Boers arc not In this mutter
guiltless, but It Is not to bo doubted
that there has been needless devasta
tlon for which the Hrltlsh are chiefly
responsible.
That, however, much as It may, bo de
plored, Is Irremediable. Tho Important
thing Is the treatment to bo given the
Boers when they shall abandon tho
struggle. Tho promise held out by Mr,
Bult'our and Mr. Chamberlulu is cer
tainly reassuring. It Is better than was
to havo been expected from the previous
announcements or intimations of Brit
ish iMjllcy. It appears evident that the
nttltudo of tho Dutch In Capo Colony
igalnst extreme measures In tho treat
ment oi mo iioers, supported ny n
strong sentiment In Kuglnnd, has had
an Influence upon the cabinet The
statement of Mr. Balfour, that ho real
lzed deeply the terrible danger of em
bittering tho Dutch lu South Africa, is
manifestly shnrcd by his colleagues in
the government.
What effect, if any, theso declarations
will have upon tho Boers remains to be
seen. They uro being relentlessly(
pressed by tho Hrltlsh, there is no hope
of nny outsido help, oven Holland hav
ing no Intention to Intervene, nnd their
numbers uro dwlndllug. Probnbhy not
to exceed 10,000 nro now lu arms. Un
der such hopeless conditions It would
not bo surprising If the Boers accepted
tho promlso given by Balfour ami
Chamberlain and gave up the struggle,
which they could do without any sac-
like of honor.
SIIOHTUX Tin: viwsiutws message.
Tho growing length of tho president's
niessuge. making those documents In re-
ent years such ponderous und formid
able dissertations, may well nrouso ap
prehension as to where it will loud, un
less something Is done to check tlio tend-
ncy. Tho constitution requires the
president simply to give congress from
line to time Information ns to the state
of tho union and recommend to their
onsideration such measures as ho shall
Judge necessary and expedient.
In the earlier stages of the repub
lic tho annual message of the presldeut
could bo mado to cover all the branches
of government activity in detail, without
becoming tedious or unwieldy. The
gradual evolution of cnblnet depart
ments with tho reports of their heads
c viewing the work under their partic
ular supervision left tho president free
o refer only in a general way to their
contents nnd to cniphnslzo such recom
mendations as demanded special atten
tion. For ono reason or another, how
ever, the Department of Stnto has never
ollowed tho practice of tlio other de
partments lu transmitting to congress
a separate report of tlio work under Its
urlsdlction. Instead, tho foreign rela
tions of tho government, in comprehensive-
review, havo been Incorporated
bodily Into the president's niessuge, as
prepared by tho State department, and
this accounts largely for tho ever grow-
ug volume of the presidential docu
ment.
I'ho foreign relations of tho United
States during the last few years havo
covered more territory and embraced
moro subjects than ever before. Not
only this, but tho Inevitable consequence
of American possessions In the Orient
will bo to Involve tho country moro in
world-power nctlvlty than was even
dreamed of by the founders of the gov
ernment. If tho president's niessago Is to be
kept at all wlthlu bounds the State dc-
3
partinent will havo to make Its report
on tho same basis us the other depart
ments, relieving the president of minor
details lu the formulation of his com
niunlcatlon, which could then take th
form of a critical commentary on all the
work In administrative circles. Our for
olgn relations would doubtless continue
to furnish the principal topics for ills
cusslon, but the niessago would appeal
much moro strongly to the popular lu
tclllgenee and command better attention
from congress.

The statement of the senate commit
tee on Cuban relations In regard to the
postal frauds shows that Hathbono, the
director of the department of posts for
Cuba, well Improved the opportunity
which his position affotded for reckless
expenditure on personal account. 11
drew lavishly upon the public funds for
supplying himself with luxuries, tho ills
allowances by (ho auditing of tho Wa
department amounting for sixteen
months to over $72,000. Neely, who
was chief of the financial bureau of the
department, did not Indulge in such per
sonal extravagance as Hathbone, but
ho spent tho public money very freely
Iho statement of tho committee
simply a compilation of figures and
makes no remarks or recommendations,
It was probably deemed unnecessary to
do so, since the case of these culprit
is in tho hands of the proper authorities
and undoubtedly will bo dealt with as
tho law requires. Public sentiment
calls for the punishment of the men
guilty of the postal frauds in Cuba to
tho full extent of the law and there Is
no doubt that this Is the Intention of
the administration. It would bo a re
proach to tho government If Hathbono
and Neely should escape the punishment
they so richly deserve.
iiEanioaTi' commissions iroKr.
ltcferrlng to what has been done by
tho reciprocity commission, tho presl
dent snld lu his nunuul niessago that
the failure of action by the senate upon
tho commercial conventions submltlei
to It at tho last session has caused
much disappointment to tho ugrlcul
tural and Industrial interests of the
country, which hoped to protlt by their
provisions. "The policy of reciprocity,'
said tho president, "so manifestly rests
upon tho principle of International
equality and has been so rendlly ap
proved by tlio people of tho United
States, that there ought to bo no hesita
tion lu either branch of congress In glv
Ing to It full effect." It Is to bo hoped
this suggestion will lnduco tlio senate to
act upon the reciprocity ugreenieuts at
tho present session.
Moro has been accomplished In this
matter than is generally understood
Tho Joint secretary of the commission
suites in un article lu the December
Forum that four agreements havo been
made under the third section of the
tariff uet, which havo become operative
by proclamation of tho president, no
action by the, senate being necessary
Under tho fourth section of the tariff
twelve treaties have been made, seven
of which are pending In the senate and
tho others will bo ubiulttod to that
body during the present session. This
Is tho largest number of commercial
trentles ever negotiated by ono ofllcer on
the part of tho United States. A dozen
reciprocal agreements wero effected
under the McICInley tariff act, but Sec
retary Osborne says that not ono of
those agreements Involved so much dllll
culty lu negotiation as each and every
ono of tlio sixteen conventions nego
tiated by Commissioner Knsson.
Tho commercial arrangements con
eluded in 1891-02 wero very satisfactory,
but tho task was made easy by auspl
clous circumstances. Mr. Osborne says
that the plan of a Pan-American zo'll
vereln, to bo bused on a system of re
ciprocal treaties of commerce, wus en
thusiastically received by tho govern
ments of the various countries of South
and Central America, and they fairly
tumbled over each other In their zeal to
take advantage of the reciprocity fea
tures of the McKlnloy law. "In theh
negotiations to this end they displayed,
as a rule, u generous spirit Tlio con-
cessions they could obtain from tlio
United States were deilned In tho tariff
net and wero tho same to all. They
gnvo whatever was asked, usually with
out haggling or hesitancy. Tho com
merce of tho United States grow by
leaps and bounds und both contracting
parties to tho respective conventions
were pleased with their bargnln."
Theso arrangements were repudiated
ami repealed by tho democratic tariff act
of 1804, whllo tho present tariff law
aroused reseutmcut In tho commercial
world which was manifested In hostile
tariffs and unjust discriminations
against American products. When tho
reciprocity commission was created it
found everywhere a notleeablo In.
Imposition to negotiate, tho situ-
atlou In IJurono belntr even worse
than lu this hemisphere. Under
theso circumstances it is easy to
seo that tho commission has had a dlfli
cult tutfk and the fact of ho largo n
number of commercial treaties having
been negotiated attests the Industry and
zeal with which Commissioner Knsson
has performed his Important duties.
Mr. Osboruo says that tho ratltlcation
of theso treaties would go a long way
toward the removal of existing causes
of complaint and the expansion of the
foreign commerce of tho United States,
while on tho other baud their rejection
would practically mean tho abandon
ment of tho principle of reciprocity.
.'he republican party being fully com
mitted to that principle, it Is hardly

Bomo months ago tho managors of tho
Chicago, Hock Island & Taclflo railroad
gnvo notlco that clgarctto smoking among
Its omployos must cease. It was announced
officially that nftor careful Investigation
among the trainmen, tobacco had been
found to bo physically, and to mentally, det
rimental. Opinions of emlnout physicians
wore quoted to that effect. Tho president
of tho road averred that from porsonai
Investigation ho was satisfied that tho ueo
t cigarettes tended to "befog tho mind
and make ono listless nnd careless In the
dlschorgo of duty." Among all cmploy
moutB, said tho prcstdont, with reason, a
tear brain is especially needed In that of
tralumen. Many of the Rock Island train
men didn't tako tho now rulo seriously
at first, but It was soon dlscovorod that
It was meant to bo obeyed, Now tho Chi
cago, Hurltngton & Qulncy system baa pub
lished this regulation:
"Tho uso of tobacco by employes In or
bout station buildings or on passenger
cara is prohibited."
This clearly is not, In tho first place, to
bettor tho health of tho Durllngton men.
but to bettor their manners. Cigarettes
nro forbidden only about station buildings
r on cars frcquentod by the public: ana
tho public will need no professional cer
tificates to convince them that tho Dur
llngton anti-clgarotto scheme Is well un-
ortaken. Smoking on duty of any sort
Is a sign of divided attention, nnd If them
Is an emblem of lndlfferenco to tho world
la general and, in particular to tho com
pany presont, It 13 tho clgarctto left hang
ing from tho lips a condition In which it
Is so frequently found.
Tho medical men may dobato tho sound-
ess of tho Hock Islnnd theory that ciga
rettes aro positively Injurious to tho mind,
but tho public knows that the Durllngton
theory that cigarette smoking is 111 man-
ers lu Itself whon trainmen bring It in
contact with travelers Is sound beyond dis
pute'; Other roads will do well to follow
tho example set by tho Uurllngtoa.
