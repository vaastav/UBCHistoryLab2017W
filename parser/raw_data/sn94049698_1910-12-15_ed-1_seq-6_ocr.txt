TAFT'S MESSAGE DELIVERED
President Recommends Tariff Reforms
and Parcels Post, and Urges
Ship Subsidy Measure.
Tn year hat been notable as witnessing
the pacific settlement of two Important In
ternational controversies before the perma-
cent court of The Hague. The arbitration
of the fisheries dispute between the United
States and Great Britain, which has been
. the source of nearly continuous diplomatic
correspondence sime (life fisheries conven
tion of ISIS, has given an award .which is
. satisfactory to both parties.
.,. The tribunal constituted at The Hague
- y the governments of. the United States
and Venezuela has completed its deiibera
- tions and has -rendered an award in' the
case of the Orinoco Steamship Company
against Venesuela.
The United States proposed that the ln
" ternatlonal prize court, when established,
should be endowed with the functions of
an arbitral court of Justice under and pur
suant to the recommendation adopted by
the last Hague conference. The replies re
ceived from the various powers to this pro
posal inspire the hope that this also may
. be accomplished within the reasonably near
, future. ' 1
Congress at Its last session passed a law
c. providing for the .appointment of a com
. ji mission of five members for tha purpos of
limiting the armaments of the nations of
the world by international agreement. I
have not yet made appointments to this
commission because X have Invited and am
awaiting the expressions of foreign govern
ments as to their willingness to co-operate
with us in the appointment of similar com
t missions.
( Several Important treaties have been ne
gotiated with Great Britain in the past 12
months. A preliminary diplomatic -agree
ment has been reached regarding the arbi
tration of pecuniary claims which each gov
ernment has against the other. The con
, vention. concluded January 11, 1908, be
tween the United States and Great Britain,
providing for the settlement of International
' differences between the United States and
Canada, including the apportionment be
tween the two countries of certain of the
baundary waters and the appointment of
commissioners to adjust certain other que
tions, has been ratified by both governments
and proclaimed.
In November last the monarchy of Por
tugal was overthrown, a provisional repub
lic was proclaimed and there was set up a
de Tacto government which was promptly
recognized by the United States for pur
poses of ordinary Intercourse pending for
mal recognition by this and other powers.
The new kingdom of Montenegro also was
recognized.
The negotiations which have been under
taken for' the amelioration of the condi
tions found in LJberia by the American com
mission are being brought to conclusion.
Relations with all Latin-America are
satisfactory, their cordiality being mani
fested by the receptions accorded to spe
cial Embassies cent to the centennial
celebrations of Argentina, Chile and
Mexico. The International Bureau of
American Republics Is doing a broad and
useful work. Tha successful mediation
of the dispute between Peru and Ecuador
has proven t,he value of cordial co-operation,
Negotiations regarding the refunding 3f
the bonded debt of Honduras have been
under way for more than a year, and It
Is now confidently believed, he says, that
a short time win sunice 10 couciuue an
arrangement which will be satisfactory
to foreign creditors and eminently ad
vantageous to Honduras.
The President then reviews the rebel
lion In Nicaragua and "the unwarranted
execution of two American citizens who
had regularly enlisted in tha ranks of
the revolutionists," which involved the
breaking off of all diplomatic relations
with the Zelaya government, ana adds:
The moderation and conciliatory spirit
shown by the various factions give ground
for the confident hope that Nicaragua will
soon take its rishtiul place among tne law
abiding and progressive countries of the
world.
It gratifies me exceedingly to announce
that the Argentine Republic some months
ago placed with American manufacturers
a contract for the construction of two battle
ships and certain additional naval equip
ment. The extent of this work and its Im
portance to the Argentine Republic make
the placing of the bid an earnest of friendly
feeling teward the United State.
Universal application has been given
by negotiation, followed by 134 procla
mations "embracing the entire commer
cial world," to the minimum tariff clause.
The message continues:
Marked advantage to the commerce of
the United State were obtained through
these tariff settlement. Foreign nations
are fully cognizant of the fact that under
section two of the tariff act the President
is required, whenever he Is satisfied that
the treatment accorded by them to the
products of the United State is not such
a to entitle them to the benefits of the
minimum tariff of the United States, to
withdraw those benefits br proclamation,
Kivinr 60 days' notice, after which the
maximum tariff will apply to their dutiable
products entering the United State. In its
general opinion this section of the tariff law
has thu far proved a guaranty of contin
ued commercial peace, althougn there are,
however, Unfortunately, instance where
foreign governments deal arbitrarily with
American interests within this Jurisdiction
In a manner injurious and Inequitable.
The policy of broader and closer trad
relations with the Dominion of Canada,
which was Initiated in the adjustment of
the maximum and minimum provision of
tha tariff act of August, 1909, ha proved
mutually beneficial. It Justine further ef
fort for th readjustment of the commer
cial relations ef the two countries, so that
their commerce may follow the channels
natural to contiguous countries and be com
mensurate with the steady expansion of
trade and induatry on both side of the
boundary line.
The Argentine battleship contracts, like
the subsequent important one for Argentine
railway equipment and those for Cuban
government vessels, were secured for our
manufacturer largely through th good of
fice of the Department of btate.
The effort of that department to ecur
for citizens of the United State equal op
portunities in the market of th world and
to expand American commerce have bn
nut successful. The volums of business
obtained in new fields of competition and
upon new line I already very great, and
Congress is urged to continue to support
the Department of State in it endeavor
for further trade expansion.
I cannot leave this subject without em
phasizing th necessity of such legislation
a will make possible and convenient th
establishment of American banks and
branches of American banks in foreign
countries, especially In Latin-America.
Another instrumentality Indispensable to
the unhampered and natural development
of American commerce is merchant marine.
Ail maritime and commercial nations, our
competitors. Jealously foster their merchant
marine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for
rapid and direct mall, pasenrer and freight
communication quite so urgent as between
the United States and Latin-America. fe
can secure in no other quarter of the worli
uch immediate benefits in friendship and
commerce as would flow from the establish
ment of direct lines of communication with
the countries of Iatin-America.
Unless prompt action be taken the com
pletion of the Panama Canal will find this
the only rreat commercial ration unable to
avail itself of this great contribution to the
means of th worlds commercial lnter-
- course.
Quite aside from the commercial aspect,
unitss we create a merchant marine, wner
can we find the eeafarlrg t'.pulatlon neces
sary as a natural naval reserve and where
could we find, in case of war. th trans
ports and subsidiary veaaels without which
a naval fleet is arms without a body? For
many reasons I cannot too strongly urge
upon th C'-Tres the paaaare of a measure
by mail eutstdy or other aibventlon ade
quate to fuarante th establishment and
rapid deAei'pment of an American mer
chant rr.ar'ne. the restoration of the Ameri
can flag to Its ancient place upon th aeu.
Th extension of civil service rules to
the Consul and th gradual acquisition
of diplomatic residence abroad are advised,
Every effort ha been made by each de
partment chief to reduce the estimated cost
of his department for th - ensuing fiscal
year ending June 80, 1912.' These estimates
present th smallest sum which will inalu
taln th departments, bureaus and offices
of the Government and meet Its other
obligations under existing law. and a cut
of these estimate would result In embarrass
ing the executive branch of the Government
In the performance of it duties. This re
mark does not apply to the rivers and har
bors estimate, except to those for expanses
of maintenance and th meeting or ohiifa
tions, under authorised contracts, nor doea li
apply to th nubile building bill nor th
Navy DuUdlng programme.
The President says thai "as" an in
come-producing measure the existing
tariff bill never has been exceeded, by
any customs bill in the history of the
country." He continues:
The corporation . excise tax, proportioned
to the net income of every business corpora
tion in the country, has worked well. The
tax has been easily collected: Its prompt
payment indicates that the Incidence of the
tax has not been heavy. It offers, more
over, an opportunity for knowledge by th
Government of the general condition and
business of ail corporations and that means
by far the. most important part of th busi
ness of the country. In the original act pro
vision was made for the publication of re
turns. Thi provision was subsequently
amended by Congress and the matter left
to the regulation of the President, I have
directed tho issue of the needed regulations
and have made it possible for the public
generally- -to know from an examination of
the record, the returns of all corporations,
the stock of which 1 listed on any public
stock exchange or 1 offered for sale to the
general public The return of thos fcor
porati'on whose stock is not so offered for
sale are directed to be open to the inspec
tion and examination of creditors and stock
holders of the corporation whose record i
sought. - ;
The President reviews th creation of
the Tariff Commission, created . in the
hope "that the question of the rate of
a duty imposed shall become more of a
business question and less of a political
question, to be ascertained! by experts
of long training and accurate knowl
edge." He indicates that the Board will
not be able to report at this session, but
he hopes to be able to present results
at the opening of the new Congress. He
renews his advocacy of the plan, of which
he says:
It facilitates the removal of noteworthy
defects In an Important law without disturb
ance of business prosperity, which is even
more Important to the happiness and the
comfort of the people than the elimination
of Instance of Injustice in the tariff.
Whether or not the protective policy Is
to be continued and the degree of protection
to be accorded to our home Industries, are
questions which- the peoi-le must decide
through their chosen repisentattves; but
whatever policy is adopted. It is clear that
the necessary legislation should be based
on an impartial, tnorougn ana sontinuous
study of the facts.
The messag favors the passage of the
bill amending the Volunteer act, and
provision for a commission to determine
a comprehensive policy for the organiza
tion of the Regular Army, the organized
militia and the volunteer forces. More
competent officers of the rank of Cap
tain are needed to teach the new Army,
that It may be prepared in time of
emergency. Another bill, the adoption
of which is urged, is the one providing
for 60 more Army Engineers. "The short
ness of supply of such officers," the mes
sage says, "delays important river and
harbor work and important fortification
work. I earnestly recommend the pas
sage of this bill which passed the House
at the last session and is now pending
in the Senate."
Of fortifications, the message says:
I hav directed that th estimates for ap
propriation for the Improvement of coast
defenses In th United State should b re
duced to a minimum, while thos for the
completion of th needed fortification at
Corregldor, in th Philippine Islands, and
at Pearl Harbor, In th Hawaiian Islands,
should be expedited a much as possible.
The proposition to make Olongapo and
Subig- Bay th naval base of th Pacific was
given up, and It 1 to be treated merely -J
a supply station, whil th fortification in
th Philippine are to be largely confined
to Corregldor Island and the adjacent Isl
and which command entrance to Manila
Bay, and which ar being rendered lmpreg
nabl from land and aa attack.
The Pacific naval bas has been trans
ferred to Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian Isl
ands. Thi necessitates th heavy fortifi
cation of th harbor and the establishment
of an important military station near Hono
lulu. I urge that all the estimate mad
by the War Department for these purposes
be approved by Congressional appropriation.
Completion of the Panama Canal with
in the time set, January 1, 1915, and with
in tha estimated cost, $375,000,000, is as
sured. The slides reported in the Cule
bra cut are due to disintegration of
igneous rock In exposure, to the air and
will Require additional allowance of 10,
000,000 yards of material to be removed.
This offers no serious obstacle, but would
have been so grave in the case of a
sea level canal as to have "taxed the
patience of the American people." The
President reiterates his opinion that the
canal should be fortified.
On the subject of tolls to be charged,
he quotes the opinion of an expert that
"a dollar a net ton would not drive busi
ness away from the canal, but that a
higher rate would do so." He adds:
In determining what th tolls should b
we certainly ought not to insist that for
a good many year to come Ihey should
amount to enough to pay the interest on
th investment of $400,000,000 which th
United States has mad in the construction
of the canaL We ought not do this at
first, because the benefit to b derived by
th United States for this expenditure ar
not to be measured eoiely by a return upon
the Investment. If It were, then the con
struction might well hare been left to pri
vate enterprise. It was because an adequate
return upon th money Invested could not
be expected immediately, or In Ui near
future, and because there were peculiar po
litical advantages to be derived from the
construction of the canal, that It neces
sarily fell to th Government to advance
the money and perform th work.
In addition to tb benefit to our naval
strength, th canal greatly Increases the
trad facilities of th United States. It
will undoubtedly cheapen the rates of trans
portation in all freight between the eastern
and western seaboard and it will greatly
Increase that trad by reason of th reduc
tion In Its cost. Then. If w ar to hav
a world canat, and if w are anxious that
the routes of th world's trad shsll b
through th Panama Canal, w must rc
ognlz that w hav an active competitor
in th Suez Canal. Then, too, there ar
other mean of crossing the isthmus by
the Tehuntepec railroad and by other rail
roads and freight routes In Central Amer
ica to th Atlantic side.
In all these cases the question whether
th Panama Canal Is to be used and Its
tonnage increased would b determined later
by th charge for lis use. My own Impres
sion is that th tolls ought not to exceed
(1 per net ton. On Jsnuary 1, lull, th
tolls In th Sue Canal are to b 7 frncs
nd 25 centime for on net ton by Suez
Cnal measurement, which is a modifica
tion f Danub measurement, A dollar
ton will cur. under th figures above, a
groea Income from th Panama Canal of
nearif 17.0O0.OO0. Tb cost of maintenance
and oparatlon Is estlmsted to exceed .!,
ImOvi. Ultlmtely, of cours. with the
normal in' rest In trade, tb lncom will
pproxlmat tn Interest charge upon th
investment.
On th whole, I should rcommnd that
within certain limits th President b Au
thorised to ex th tolls of th canal and
adjust them to what eema to be com
mercial ceceaalty.
Th maintenance of the completed canal
la discussed at length, Mr. Taft would
add to the equipment facilities for fur
nishing drydock, fuel, rrpalrs and supply
facilities to the trade of the wor.d. Tills
should he undertaken by the Govornment
nrther than by private enterprise, Mr.
Taft believes. He adds:
I cannot close this reference to the canal
without suggesting as a wise addition to
the Interstate commerce -law a provision
p -oliibltlng Interstate commerce railroad
from owning or controlling ships engag
In trade through the Panama. Canal. - I be
lieve such a- provision is needed to sav
the people 'of the United States tha benefit
of th competition in trade between th
eastern and western seaboards which th
canal will be constructed to secure. t
The duties of the Department of Jus
tice have been, greatly -increased by leg
islatlon, .enacted "(n th Interest of th
general welfare of . the people and ex.
tending Its activities Into avenues plain
ly within the constitutional Jurisdiction,
but which it has not been thought wfse
or necessary for the General Governinen
heretofore to occupy." The organization
has been so Improved that a vast amount
or business has been disposed or. par
ticular attention is called to prosecutions
of "bucket ahops,"; frauds which have
misused the mailing privilege and vio
lations of the anti-trust law. V
Recommendation of a federal Incorpor
ation act Is renewed.,-. ICdngres is urged
to pay promptly just claims against the
Government, delay in.the. paymentiof
which injures the refutation of the Gov
ernment as an ,iion,est; debtor. Slmfjier
Judicial procedure la advised. The mes
sage says: ., v (
On great cryjng-'need, in the United States
Is cheapening the cost of litigation by sim
plifying Judicial procedure and expediting
ilnal Judgment, Under present conditions,
the poor man is at a woeful disadvantage
In a legal contest wlth a corporation; or
ncn opponent.- The-,heojftliy for the rerurm
exists both in the United States Courts and
In all state courts. In order to bring? it
about,, however, it naturally f .lls to the
General Government by Its example to fur
nlsh a model to all states. A legislative
commission appointed by Joint resolution of
congress to revise the procedure in .vie
United States Courts has as yet made no
report,.
Under the law the Supreme Court ofthe
United States has the power and Is given the
duty to frame the equity rules of procedure
which are to obtain In the Federal Courts of
first Instance., In view of the heavy burden
on pressing litigation which that court
ha had to carry, with one or two oC- its
members Incapacitated throuirh 111 health
It has not been abl to -'take up problem of
Improving th equity procedure, which, has
practically remained the same since th or
ganization of the court In 1789. It I rea
sonable to expect that with all th vacancies
upon th court filled, it will take ud the
question of cheapening and simplifying the
procedure in equity rules In the courts of
the United Stat. The equity business Is
much more important In the Federal Courts,
and I may add. much th more expensive.
I am strongly convince that the best meth
od of improving Judicial procedure at law Is
to empower the Supreme Court to do It
through th medium of th rules of the
court, as In equity. This is th way In
which It has been done in England and thor
oughly done. The simplicity and expedition
of procedur in the English court today
make a model for the reform of other sys
tems.
No man ought have as a matter of right
a review of his case by the Suprem Court.
Ha should b satisfied by one hearing be
fore a court of first Instance and one re
view by a court of appeals. The proper and
chief usefulness of th Supreme Court, and
especially of the Supreme Court of the
United States Is. In the case which come
before It, so to expound the law and es
pecially the fundamental law the Constltu
tlon as to furnish precedents for the Infe
rior courts in future litigation and for the
executive officers In the construction of
statutes and fhe performance of their legal
duties. Therefore, any provisions for re
view of cases by the Supreme Court that cast
upon that court the duty of passing on ques
tions of evidence and the construction of
particular forms of Instruments, like indict
ments, or wills, or contracts, decisions not
of general application or lmportai.ee, merely
burden the court and render more "iffi-'ult
Its higher function. The Supreme Court is
now carrying an unnecessary burden of ap
peals of this kind, and I earnestly urge that
it be removed.
I wish to renew my urgent recommenda
tion made In my last annual message in
favor of th passage of a law which shall
regulate the issuing of njunctloni in equity
without notice in accordance with the best
practice now In vogt-e in the courts of the
United States. 1 retard tins or ebpeciai im
portance, first because it has been promised,
and second because it will deprive those
who now complaiu of certain alleged abuse
tn th Improper Usulng of Injunctions with
out notice of awy real ground for further
amendment and will take away all sem
blance of support for th extremely radical
legislation the propose, which will b most
pernicious If adopted, will sap th founda
tions of judicial power, and legalize that
eruel social Instrument, the secondary boy
cott. I further recommend to Congress the pass
age of th bill now pending for the Increase
In salaries of the Federal Judges. The cost
of living 1 such, especially in the large
cities, that even th salaries fixed in the pro
posed bill will enable th incumbents to ac
cumulate little, if anything, to support their
families after their death.
The postal savings bank system will
be extended gradually. The application
of business principles has resulted in the
return of Jll.500,000 of the 17.600,000 ap
propriated to cover the estimated de
ficit. The Postmaster-General's esti
mates for the present year are so low as
to be within the expected revenue.
First, second and third-class postmas
ters should be placed In the classified
service. The message adds:
It is more logical to do this than to class
ify the fourth-ciass postmasters, for th
reason that the fourth-class postoffices are
usually small and tne postmasters ar necea
aarlly men who must combine other busi
ness with th postmastershlp, whereas, th
first, second and third-class postmaster ro
paid a sufficient amount to Justify th re
auirement that they shall have no other
business and that thy shall devot thel
attention to their postoffice duties. To
classify first, second and third-class post
masters would require th passag of an
act changing the method of their appoint
ment fto as to take away the necessity for
the advice and consent of tb Senate.
I am aware that this 1 inviting from th
Senat a concession in respect to It quasi-
executive powers that Is considerable, but I
believ It to be In tne. interest of good ad
ministration and efficiency of service. To
mak this change would tak th post
master out or politics; would reliev Con
gressman who ar now burdened with the
necessity or making recommendation ror
the place of a responsibility that must bs
lrksom and can create nothing but trouble;
and It would result In securing greater at
tention to business, greater fidelity and con
sequently greater economy and efficiency
in th postoffice which they conduct.
Tb unrestricted manner In which th
franking privilege I now being usd by
the several Federal services and by Con-
gre has laid it open to serfou abuse.
Whil It ha been Impossible without a bat
ter control or rranking to determine th ac
tual expens to th Government or this
practice, there can be no doubt that it an
nually reaches Into th millions. As th
first step in th direction ot reforms, special
stamps and stamped envelope hav ben
provided for us Instead of frank in th
free transmission of th official mall re
sulting from th business of th new postal
saving system. By properly recording th
issuanc ot such stamp and envalop, ac
curst record can be kept of th cost to
the Government of handling th post! av
ings mall, which is certain to become an
Important Item of expense and on that
should separately determined.
In my last messag I invited th atten
tion of Congress to th Inadequacy of th
postal rats Imposed upon sscond-claa mall
matter Insofar as that Include magazinea,
and showed by figures prepared by experts
of the Postoffice Depsrtment that th Gov
ernment wouldi b rendering a vervfc to
the magazines, costing mny millions in ex
cess of the compensation paid. An answer
was attempted to thi by th representatives
of th magazines, and a reply wa filed to
thi answsr by th Postoffic Department,
The utter Inadequacy of th answer, con
sidered In the light of the reply of th Post
offic Department. I think, must appeal to
any fair-minded person. Whthr th an
swer wss all that could be said In behalf
of the magazine 1 another question. I
azre that th question I on of fact; but
I Insist that If th fact Is a th expert
of the postofTlcs Depsrtment show, that we
ar furnishing to th owner of magazines
a service worth million mor thn they
pay ror It, then justice require that th rt
should b Increased, Th Inert In th
rc!pt of th department resulting from
thi chng may b devoted to Increasing
th UMfulne) of tb department ia tab-
llshlng a parcul post and In reducing th
cost of flrst-cluss posmtte to 1 cent. It has
been snld by the Postmnstcr-Genoral that, a
fulr adjustment might bo made under which
the advertising part of the magazine should
be charged for at a different and higher
late- than thnt from the reading matter.
This would relieve many useful maxuHnes
thnt are not circulated at a profit, and
would not shut them out from the use of
the mails by a prohibitory rate.
With respect to the parcels post, I re
spectfully recommend it adoption on all
rural delivery routes, and that 11 pound
the International limit be made th'e limit of
carriage In such post, and this with a view
to Its general extension when the Income
of the postoffice will permit It and th pos
tal savings bank shall have been fully estab
lished. ,X)ia sum argument is made against
the parcels post that wis made against the
postal- suving bank that It I Introducing

I have been asked to recommend that the
credit of the Government be extended to
aid the construction of railroads in Alaska
am not ready now to do so, A great
my millions of dollars have been already
expended in the construction of at least
two railroads, and lr laws be passed pro
vlding ror the proper development of the
resources of Alaska, especially for the open-
ng up or tr.e coai lands, I believe that the
capital already Invested will Induce the
Investment of more capital, sufficient to
complete the railroads building, and to tur-
nish cheap coal not only to Alaska but to
the whole Pacific Coast The passage of a
law permitting tne leasing -of Government
coal lands in Alaska after public competi
tion ana tne appointment for the govern
ment of the territory of a commlsson with
enabling powers to meet the local needs
will lead, to an Improvement In Alaska and
the development of her resources that Is
likely to surprise the country.
I have already referred to the forests of
the United States and their extent, and
have urged, as I do again, the removal of
the limitation of the power upon the Ex
ecutive to reserve tracts of land in six
Western States In which withdrawal ror this
purpose is now forbidden. The Secretary f
Agriculture gives a very full description of
the disastrous fires that occurred during the
last Summer In the National forests. The
Secretary estimates that standing timber
of the value of $25,000,000 was destroyed.
Seventy-six persons In tha employ of the
Forest Service were killed and many more
Injured, and 1 regret to say that there is no
provision in the law by which the expenses
for their hospital treatment or of their in
terment could b met out of public fund.
The Red Cross contributed $1000 and the
remainder was made up by private contribu
tion, principally by the Forest Service and
Its officials. I recommend that suitable
legislation be adopted to enable the secre
tary of Agriculture to meet the obligation
of the Government in. this respect.
Proper protection necessitates, as the Sec
tatary points out, the expenditure cf a good
deal more money In the development ot
roads and trails In the forests, the establish
ment of lookout stations and telephone con
nection between them and place where as
sistance can be secured.

000 acres of National forests seoms small,
and I am glad to not that In this regard
the Secretary or Agriculture and the chief of
tha Forest Service ar looking together to
the further forestatlon of Government land.
Progress has been mads In learning by ex
periment the best methods ot reforestation.
Congress Is appealed to now by the Secre
tary of Agriculture to make th appropria
tion needed for th enlarging of the Fo 'eat
Service In thi regard. I hope that Con
gress will approve and adopt the estimate of
the Secretary for this purpose.
The taking of the census has proceeded
with promptness and efficiency. I concu
with the Secretary in that it will be mor
thorough and accurate than any censu
wheh has heretofore been taken, but it is
not perfect. The motive that prompts men
with a false civic pride to induce the pad
ding of census returns In order to increase
the population of a particular city has been
strong enough to lead to fraud In respect
to a few cities in this country, and I have
directed the Attorney-General to proceed
with all the vigor possible against those
who are responsible for these frauds.
They hav been discovered and they will
not interfere with the accuracy of the cen
su, but It Is of the highest importance
that official Inquiry of this sort should not
be embarrassed by fraudulent conspiracies
In soms private or local interest.

The direct Investigation mad by th Com

14 per cent is owned by three corporation
and that ther 1 very extensive Inter-
ownership of stock, as well as other cir
cumstances, all pointing to friendly re la
tions among those who own a majority of
this timber, a relationship which might
lead to a combination for the maintenance
of a price that would be very detrimental
to the public Interest and would create
th necessity of removing all tariff ob
stacles to the free lumber Importation from
other countries.
The making of matches from phos
