Says the New York Tribune of Thiirs
day, last, y ung man rushed wildly
about the I en isylvania railroad depot in
Jersey City yesterday morning, looking
for a ( police officer. He said that he was
from Natchez, Miss., that his name was
Chamhless, and that he had been swin
dled by a "bunco steerer" out of $3 50.
He did not care for the money, he said ;
the experience was worth it, hut he
wanted to have the thief arrested. The
thief was an old man with white hair and
an honest look. He had offered to show
the young man a house he was looking
for. Cbambless lent him $3 50. to pay
another man,who presented a bill to him,
until he could get a check cashed. The
last he saw of the honest old man he was
running rapidly around a corner two
blocks away."

929,000 to the Stock of the Vhnl
mette Hotel,
The new hotel project is receiving
more encouragement than was expected
by the most sanguine friends of the en
terprise. Entirely unsolicited, Mr. 8. B.
McConnico, the President of the Chal
mette Hotel Company, yesterday receiv
ed a subscription of $25,000 to the capi
tal stock. Mr. J. C. Clarke, President of
the Illinois Central Railroad, was the
subscriber on behalf of his company,
and in a letter addressed to Mr. McCon
nico he says that "he has long been
greatly impressed witli the importance I
of having a first-class hotel in New Or
leans, and believes that such a measure |
would turn a large proportion of Geor
gia and Florida excursionists and tour
ists to this city. The great objection of
lack of hotel accommodations; and, al
though this city presented many more
attractions than either Georgia or Flori
da, the later States were made the ob
jective point of travelers in preference to
New Orleans."
If the other four combinations or com
exas, the
pantes, the Louisiana and
Texas and Pacific, the Louisville and
Nashville and the Northeastern, will do
as Mr. Clarke has done, $125,000 of the
stock of the hotel company will be sub
scribed for, and this in itself would be
• an assurance that the work would go rap
idly forward to completion.
Sir. McConnico, who is very enthusi
astic in the good work, visited some of
the railroad magnates yesterday, and
will see them all in the course of a few
days.—Times-Democrat.

THE PRESIDENT'S JEESMAUE.
The President's Message is conserva
tive in tone and moderate in temper,
and while it contains no very great evi
dence of profound statesmanship, it
cornes up perhaps fully to the require
ment and embraces in the main about
all the occasion calls for. It is a pleas
ure to know that our internal affairs are
prosperous and quiet, and that our rela
tions with foreign countriesis satisfacto
ry. His views are in harmony with
those of the Secretary of the Treasury
on financial questions. The President is
opposed to the rapid, reduction of the
public debt through excessive taxa
tion. He rather favors the using of
the surplus amounting to $60,000,000
annually, to improving our coaBt defen
ses and to strengthening our Navy. He
shows a disposition somewhat to avoid a
renewed agitation of the tariff question,
which appears to us to be dodging one
of the leading questions of the day.
Our Navy needs improving and our com
merce on the Bea must be protected, but
the reduction of taxes is a vital question
to the people, and they are not likely to
forego their interest in it. The revenue
system ought to be adjusted to the re
quirements of government only, and no
large surplus ought to be laid up to in
cite our law makers and officials to cu
pidity. The President's views in regard
to the U tab question seems to us to he
most too extreme. To abolish the Ter
ritorial government and to assume abso
lute political control of the Territory, by
Congress, is a most radical measure, as it
would take away from the people of Utah
,,n 8e mblance of local self government,
, enforcem6nt of lawg into the
F y , , ^ .
hands of men hostile to a large majority
0 f its people. The practice of polygamy
ig in our opinion, vile and a just object
such extreme measures. The govern
ment control of the telegraph is a matter
f doubt in thft p res ident's mind, but his
,, ._ ,
suggestion that there should he gov era
ment supervision of both telegraph and
ra ilroad inter-state communication, is
botb ti me ly and wise. States can protect
themselves within their borders,but they
need force and utility that will extend
beyond their boundaries. The President
speaks favorably of the new civil service
system, but on the question of civil
rights, he seems to think that the citizens
not sufficiently protected by the na
tional power. He recommends heartily
the World's Industrial and Cotton Cen
tennial Exposition at New Orleans next
year, and for which he should have our
thanks.

For many years Memphis has had
enviable reputation for the extent of its
liquor trade, and the quality of goods
produced or handled. Buyers can al
ways find here superior inducements in
the way of the finest brands, fair treat
ment, and reasonable prices, and, as a
consequence, the direct trade with the
leading dealers throughout the country
constantly increasing. * The amount of
capital invested in the business is very
large, and those engaged in it are push
ing their interests with intelligent enter
prise. The character of her whisky
men has also largely contributed to her
preeminence in this trade. In all that
goes to make up a body of honorable,
high-toned merchants, they will compare
favorably with any in the United States.
Their representations can be at all times
implicitly relied upon, and those who
deal with them once are sure to do so
again. Among the most extensive and
reputable wholesale dealers of Memphis
stands the firm of
an
A. VACCABO A CO.,
No. 278 and 280 Front Street, established
in 1844. In all their years of active bus
iness operations, it has been a J principle
of the house to merit and retain the con
fidence ot the public and of the trade.
How well they have succeeded, their in
creasing trade and circle of friends best
attests. Their transactions aggregate
very largely each year, and complaints
from customers are almost unheard of.
The house of A. Vaccaro & Co., is well
known to the trade at large, and their
reputation is in keeping with the high
standard of the goods they handle.
There is nothing iri President Arthur's
