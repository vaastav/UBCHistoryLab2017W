Cincinnati, O., Dec. 4. Com
menting on the president's mes
sage, the Enquirer says: "The
annual message of President
McKinley to congress is very
long and rather wearisome. It
will not he geneiallv read, but
discussion of it by the newspa
pers will familiarize the reading
public with those features
which are of interest and imj
porta nee. It has been careful
ly prepared and as to forms of
construction it takes a leading
place in the public documents
that have come from the pres
ent administration. We go no
further ill elucidation as to how
much that is saying for it. It
is well enough written, any
how, to make it a pity that so
much good composition should
have so deep as it will imme
diately go into.''
St. Louis, Dec. 4. The Re
public (Democrat) says: "Pres
ident McKlnley's message is of
exceptional historic value as
outlining, at the dawn of a new
century, the policy of a great
government which had just been
born when the present century
began. The, message is a con
fession that, insofar as it is
possible to Mr. McKinley and
the Republican party, the gov
ernment is to be administered
on lines of imperialism and of
class privilege that are foreign
to the spirit of its foupjAprs."

question thrust upon the British
statesman; and if the question

Britain has a divine right to
