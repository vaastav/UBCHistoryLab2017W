Ths Army Vote.
We have watched, with some care, the ma
noeuvres and tricks of the Abolition politicians,
in their "working up" of tho army vote. Con
vinced, from the beginning, that they intended
to use that vote for the purpose of counting in
tb eir candidates, we n:e not at all astonished,
or disappointed, at. their operations in 'bis re
gard, in our Congressional, Judicial and Leg
islative districts. Wo are only amazed at the
eoolness with which they cry "fraud! fraud!"
when the Democrats try to avail themselves of
the protection which the law throws around the
rights of candidates. Liko all adepts in the
art of theft, they understand most thoroughly
the trick of throwing off suspicion from theui
felves, by pointing to others and crying '-stop
thief!" Hence, in order to divert attention
from their own iniquity, they ra's3 a ter
rible hue and cry about the course of, the
mnjonly of the Congressional, Judicial and
Legislative return judges. This is the secret
of the noise they are making about tho conduct
of those officers, this and nothing more. They
know, and have known from the beginning, j
that the granting of certificates of election to I
the Democratic candidates for Congress,
and Legislature, could not work them any in
jury, for there remained to them the right of j
appeal to Congress and the Legislature, both ;
cf which bodies are composed of a majority of
their own partizans. But they would rather
make the contest elsewhere, as was shown by
their submitting the Judge question to Gov.
f urtin's lawyer and by getting up certificates 1
to their candidates fur Congress and Lci-la- !

turns from the army, and because they hope
that if the Democrats are compelled to take
the initiative in the contest, there will not be
an\ contest at all. Vfo believe that the Dem
ocratic candidates for Congress, President Judge
and Legislature, have a majority of all the legal
votes cast within their respect ii a di. iricts. The
majorities claimed for the Abolition candidates,
are 68 on Congress, 122 on President Judge
and as high as 16S on Legislature. (The ma
jority of 11)2 set down by the Abolition papers,
for iiossovcr Meyers, is an error of at least 30
votes. On this we will wag. r a now hat.) -
V.VJ, in the county of Bedford alone, there arc
enough illegal (not merely informal) returnsfrom
the army, taken in connection with the fraudu
lent votes which can be proved, to wipe out any
of these majorities,^ HP. PA.,
tjy Would hereby notify the citizen# of Bedford

J. ALSIP & SON,
As to "throwing out soldiers' votes," con- j
cerning which the Abolition papers make BO J
much ado, the Democratic return judges of Bed-!
ford county did not reject a single vote certi
fied to there hy the l'rothonotary. But the
Abolition return judges, because they were not
satisfied with the Prothonotary'a certificate did ,
rejuie to count, t.c "soldiers' vote" find receded\
Jrom the hoard oj return judges. Their rccts.ion I
lejt t..e "soldiers vote uncounf- •/, the law requir- •
ing that all the judges present shall sign the ro-1
turns. ILnce. it was because of the conduct j
of these mulish Abolition judges, that the "sol-!
diers' vote" of Bedford county, was not inclu- j
ded in the district returns, and not because of.
any desire on the part of the Democrats to :
throw it out; and hence that vote remained UB- J
counted to this day and until recounted by the
proper tribunal, tlie Democratic candidates, for
Congress. President Judge and Legislature, by
the very net of the Abolition return judges them
selves, stand fairly and duly elected
fi-ir I lie merchants of Bedford county are re
spectfully referred to the card of H. L. Hood
with W. W. Paul. These of our friends who
deal with Harry, say ho is one of the most
accommodating salesmen in Phil's.

along the Manassas Gap .Railroad.
The Message.
On our outside will be found the President's
Message. Although we might have given our
readers much more instructive and valuable
matter than is furnished in this document, we
felt undisposed to depnrt from our custom of
publishing, in full, the annual message of the
President, and, therefore, give it a place in
our columns.
We do not desire to disparage the merits of
this "message." We could not have any rea
son for such a desire. The presidential cam
paign is over and politics, foi the present, are
unagitated. Besides, we are well aware that
it would be to our personal advantage, in imi
tation of "loyal" hypocrisy, to praise the doc
ument end bless its author. Hence it is not a
selfish, nor even a political, motive, which im
pels as to declare that we cannot endorse the
views of the Presideut. Views, did we say ?
We dignify the crude ideas of governmental
policy, entertained by Mr. Lincoln, by styling
them "views." They are mere accidental mag
get*, thrust upon his fancy, a- he has frequent
ly declared, by the force of circumstances. Nor
' are they original with the President. They
have long since been the property of British
Abolitionists and their agents in the United
I _ °
, .States, Garrison, Phillips and Co.
The message contains nothing new upon the
Subject of the war. It has not a single sug
gestion concerning the restoration of peace,
except the proposition of George tho_ I bird
which lost that monarch the thirteen colonies
of America, to wit: "Lay down your urns,
■ ye rebels, and return to you" allegiance, or ex
j pect to be exterminated from v'* c l ace l ' lo
earth." The Abolition ideas of th.s message
are those of former "state" papers of the JV*-?*
i ident, presented in a less attractive form flud
divested af all appearance of novelty. They
have become "fiat, stale and unprofitable."
There are, however, three decidedly original
propositions in the message; first, the presen
tation of a gunboat to Liberia; second, the rec
ommendation of the passage of a law by Con
gress, securing a certain portion of the Gov
ernment bonds from taxation, and attachment
for debt, so a3 to enable those who invest in
thcra to cheat their neighbors; and thirdly and
most extraordinary and startling, the announce
ment that all political parties, the Democrats
as well as the Abolitionists, are in favor of the
Union !
Well, we have written upon this subject
ad nauseam,. We shall drop it for the present,
appealing only to flie candor of all who read
the message, whether it does not fail far below
what is expected of the chief executive of our
country, in these days of civil commotion and
national peril.

DEAR FATHER ;
1 am getting quite well and I hops that

on board the boat until the 4th of December,

and the examining surgeon going in the midst

fully provided for our comfort. The Doctor
informs us that we shall all be home by the

article,
. i.pw yoT, were led, by the erroneous
. of others, to publish in regard to my
sermon on thanksgiving day "a base slander"
upon myself and the sermon. It seems that
certain fanatical persons had gone to church in
anticipation of a highly-wrought political har
angue. These persons were di. appointed, as
they will always be when they expect anything
of ibat kind from me. 1 camo to liedford to
preach the gospel and tell the people of their
sins, as I did in part of my discourse on thanks
giving day, much to the annoyance of those
who seem not tohave read the President's Proc
lamation, or to have forgotten that lie called
upon the people to "humble themselves in the dust
and jrota thence to oJJ'cr up penitent and fervent
prayers.
i was called upon by the other clergy of the
town ur.d pressed (contrary to my wishes, since
I could not spare the time to prepare a discourse
for the occasion) to preach the sermon. The
sermon which 1 used had been delivered bef jre
an audience in Gettysburg of twice the ' um
ber, fully two-thirds of whom bob nged to he
party in power. I had every reason to believe
that it gave entire satisfaction and no one iu
agiued iliat there was any attack on the gov
ernment. sly loyalty, before this, was never
called into question, and, if your paper circu
lated among people who know my sentiments,
I would not think the slanderous account wbicli
you received and published of my sermon
worth a thought, but, as you invite correc
tion to bisabuse the minds of the misinformed I
I give it.
The (Lift of my discourse was to show that
the mass of our nation is corrupt, ami that God
has permitted this war in chastisement of our
sins. I said, we have sinned through pride,
coretousnoss, drunkenness, lack of charity, Sab
bath-breaking, profanity, etc., etc., and I chal
lenge all good christians to deny the charge. I
said, these .sins have run into the government,
and there developed themselves to nn alarming
extent. I charged the responsibility of all this
upon the people and called upon them to make
confession and reformation in order to slay the
judgements of God. I, of course, as a minis
ter of the gospel look at things from a lablc
stand-point, and fanatical politicians must not,
therefore, measure me by their scale.
The individual, who represented me as say
ing that wc have nothing for which to be thank
ful, uttered a "base slander," as the following
paragraph from the sermon will show: "From
behind a dark cloud the light is breaking through
to cheer the hearts of the people. An encour
aging degree of success has attended the efforts
of the government to save our country from
dissolution—the people have borne their trials
with a commendable patience—peace has been
maintained at home and tne army largely re
eruiled—not only have we been free, in a great 1
measure, from invasion, but the enemy, at most
points, has been driven further within his own
territory—the nation has enjoyed an unusual
stato of health, and, of the necessaries and
comforts of life, enough and to spare. For all
this we thank God and take courage." The |
sermon contains much of the same kind. I |
did eny, this is no time for festivity and mirth,
when our fellow-citizens are Waring the hard
slaps of war and the land is tilled with the
wail of the widow and the cry of the orphan.
1 suppose the disloyalty fur which your pa
triotic soul would consign me to the dungeon
or exile in Siberia, is expressed in such sen
tences as these of which the sermon is fuil:
Loyalty to the government is loyalty to God—
God helps those who make the most vigorous
use of the means in their power—Cromwell's
advice to his soldiers has the genuine ring in
times like these, 'Trust to Provid euce, and keep
your powder dry.' "
Now I want it understood by your readers
and all in this community, that I never preach
party politics and never intend to do it. But
I am bold to rebuke sin, whether they be tho
sins of the people or the officers of the govern
ment or the editors of newspapers. I seldom
conduct a service without praying for our rulers.
I would not consent to preach for a people who
objected to my performing this part of a minis
ter's duty, being a mode rate and conservative
maD, I do not soar off in the cestacies of a po
litical harangue in my prayers, or mention any
one, hy name ; and yet God knows whom I
mean and that I desire the welfare of the coun
try. But for taking any other sword into the
pulpit, but "the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God," if any of the churches of
this town requires that, they must invito those
i to preach for them who do such things,
i There were several things in my sermon which
| were, perhaps, stated a httle too strong for a
! sensitive audience. But if any one doubts that
I have given the true sentimant and drift of it,
I have the manuscript to verify the statement:
Should anyone of those about town who visit
tho churches to scent out, in the sermons they
hear, copperheads, or any other kind of serpents
I but the one in their own bosom, imagine that
I he understands my sentiment or the sentiments
I of my sermon better than myself, I want ev-
I cry such one to know that he can provoke no
I further reply or notice from me. I confess that
! I feel somewhat mean in condescending to no-
I tioe this, and only do so to prevent the misguid
i ed or civil-disposed from impairing the influence
■ of one who is a stranger among yon.

' OtR Recklessness" —The following re
mark* by the Lancaster luMiujencer, upon litis
subject arc both true ami sad:
"Wo have learned to hear of ihe slaughter
of hundreds ami thousands of men without so
much as a shudder. The daily announcement
of skirmishes, in which from ten to a hundred
men, full of lusty iile, tire hurried out of exis
tence, is disposed of in a brief sentence, a short
telegram, read try millions, and forgott -n aimt
as soon as read. Scenes of horror, the r cital
of which, if occurring in India or Ethiopia,
would have made our very blood curdio before
we had become iuibruted by this horrible civil
war, now moves u no longer. We have be
come as blood-thirsty as the veriest painted
devil of an Indian who once scoured the for
ests which grew where our cities now stand.
Our preachers are no more ministers of the gos
pel of the God of peace. The churches .f the
land reek with the sickening odors of slaughter,
and the occupants of many of the sacred desks
bawl lroru Sabbath to Sabbath, like howling
dervishes for blood.
'•We are-blood-thirsty, thoughtless. r-ckless.
Our cities were never gayer than they are now.
The theatres are crowded nightly, and ail fcha
haunts of gilded crime are filled to overflowing.
Extravagance is the order of the day. Gaudy
equipages, the 'turn out' of vulgar aristocrats,
whose purses have grown plethoric from un
limited public plunder, crowd every avenue;
jewelry glitters on red fingers and anas unused
to surh adornments; brown-stone fronts mid
marl ie palaces spring up, at enormous cost, as
if by the stroke of an enchanter's wand; they
are filled with gorgeous upholstery, and the ov
er pants revel in luxury.
"We are running a wild race of bloody deeds
of national and social extravagance, of folly
and of crime, which is the wor.dcT of the world.
The nations ol the earth look on in utter a
mazomcnt, while they predict a disastrous end
to this mad career. Is there not good reason
to tear they are right ? There must cotne a
day of reckoning. That it will bo a very tad
