The President on Tuesday sent to
the Senate the following nominations:
Lucius Q. C. Lamar, Miss., associate
justice of supreme court of United

It is impossible for the Leader to
ispeak of a Democrat truthfully "on
general principles." f
The thing is to get "an honest and
free-expression," as well as an honest
count.
TniCXew York Sun announces its
intention to support Cleveland next
year. .This is the paper which ealled
Grover .horrid names three years ago
and -said he couldn't carry New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut. Having
(discovered that Grover is a statesman
and .a. gentleman, the Sun is manly
-enough toio the right thing, hence its
(conversion. And this journalistic
change of :heart is in the nature of a
good-sized political straw. Thousands
and hundreds of thousands will vote
for Cleveland next year who refused
him support in 1884.
The exports and imports of the
United States the past year nearly bal
ance each other, the exports amounting
to 724,tfc25.735, and the imports to 707,
Ot!2,4!(i. This ma-kes a total foreign
trade for the year of 1.431,fe8,233,
against a foreign trade of 1,352,8'J5,4C4
in 1881, an increase of nearly $80,000,000
in the last twelve months. Substan
tially all this trade is carried in foreign
ships, because underour tariff and nav
igation laws Americans cannot com
pete with foreigners in the carrying
trade.
Chairman Niswonges, has a rather
lengthy card in Tuesday's Repository,
in reply to the Masillon Independent,
in explanation of his course in adjourn
ing the Farmers' Institute. In his card
Mr. Niswonger says:
a "MeGrecor heinsr nresent and on
rocrramme. I managed with him for a
I
ialf hour talk. He found no fault with
this, but had there been time he would
have prolonged his address. He talked
until he voluntarily quit, made a bow
and retired to his seat.
Without wishing to find fault, Mr.
N. should have said, "I limited him to
a half hour."
Mr. N. will also remember, no doubt,
that, during some applause he told Mr.
McGregor he would have to quit, when
the speaker said he would wind up
with a few closing words, which was
done.
Of course Mr. McGregor cheerfully
obeyed orders, for he was invited, and
he had no wish to Intrude, and makes
no complaint so far as he is concerned.

Meagre Account of a Wreck on the Delaware
& Hudson Railway.
Troy, N. Y, Dec. 7. Special.
Information was received here .this
morning that the Montreal express on
the Delaware & Hudson Canal railroad,
which left Troy at 12.05 a. m., ran off
the track when near the station of
Whaleneburg. The station and cars
were set on fire. The wires are down
and no details can be had; hut it is
feared that many passengers have been
killed, as the train was heavily loaded.
Albany, N. Y, Dec. 7. Special .
Superintendent Hammond, of the Dela
ware & Hudson Canal Railway Com
pany, says that the Montreal express
going north was wrecked at an early
hour this morning while exactly oppo
site the Whalensburg Btation. The
accident was caused by a broken axle
under the tender. The station, a bag
gage car, an express car and one pas
senger coach were destroyed by fire.
At first it was reported that an old lady
was seriously hurt by being thrown
from her berth in the sleeping car, but
later information . states that no one
was injured. The wires are down, and
it is impossible to obtain any definite
news at the present time.
No Jury Yet.
Ravenna, O., Dec. 7. Special.
The grind commenced again this morn
ing in the Hulligan murder case, num
ber three, and it looks very much as
though the defense were going to
exhaust all of their peremptory
challenges. Forty-eight men were on
hand when court opened and A. D.
Beardsley was the first man who quali
fied himself as a juror. The defense
have exercised seven peremptory chal
lenges and still have sixteen in reserve.
