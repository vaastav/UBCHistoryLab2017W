THE PORT' TOBACCO TIMES AND CHARLES COUNTY ADVERTISER, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 9. 1870.
f 1 from the Baltimore Dm.
If A Message.
" Afttf tba| the past year has been
one ol “peace ahd plenty,” the 'President be
_ gins bis message by saying that “it is to be
regretted, however, that a free exercise of the
elective franchise has by violence apd intimi
dation been denied to citizens, in exceptional
s cases, in several of the States lately in rebel-
V* ■ ' • ■
- lion, and the verdict of the people has been
s j thereby reversed.” It is to be regretted that
1 1 the President should have felt it incumbent to
i jmsltfr ff Statement which Is obviously intend
-1 ed as an apology for the odious congressional
- election law, and of tbe “precautionary mea
, sures” adopted by the government at some of
the recent State elections. We believe that
the cases in which the free exercise of the
• elective franchise in any part of the country
-1 was “by violence or intimidation denied” were
>'indeed “exceptional,” and for that reason we
! doubt whether in any case "the verdict of the
' people was reversed thereby." Nor if we re
' j call the magnitude of the military prepara
,, tions in New York city, and the use made of
. the marines in Philadelphia, does it appear
that the President’s apprehensions at the time
of the obstruction of the elective franchise by
• violence or intimidation were confined to “the
I States lately in rebellion.” We are glad to
i learn, by the way, that Georgia, although not
! in the Union as we supposed yesterday,
speaking from the best information we could
: obtain, is expected back shortly after new
f year.
i Casting his eyes abroad, the President brief
, ly states the steps taken in consequence of the
European war, both to insure the neutrality
of our own people, as well as to maintain our
cordial relations with both of the belligerents,
between whom the President observes that
this government stands ready to employ its
good offices whenever there is reason to believe
that by their means the war can be shortened
one hour. It is highly probable that the war
will be closed without our mediation.
The first topic upon which tbe message en
, larges to any extent is the importance of the
acquisition of San Domingo, which is urged
with great earnestness and from a variety of
points of view. The same considerations and
arguments formed the staple last session of
special message upon this subject. What the
. President asks for now is authority to appo nt
a commission to negotiate for the acquisition
of the whole island.
1 In connection with foreign affairs, some
Mexican customs arrangements, extradition
treaties with the Central American States, the
; Venezuelan claims, the Tien-Tsin massacre,
the rectification of our boundary line on the
44th parallel, the abolition of the mixed courts
for the suppression of the slave trade, and the
1 naturalization treaty recently negotiated with
Great Britain come in each for a word of men
tion. The fishery troubles are next discussed
more at length, and in manner which will
make this portion of the message highly ac
ceptable to Gape Chd. The President lays the
blame upon “the semi-independent but irre
sponsible agent” known as the Dominion of
Canada, and asks for authority to suspend,
by proclamation, the transit of goods, wares
and merchandise in bund across the territory
of the United Staten to Canada, and, if neces
sary, to exclude from tbe waters of tbe United
States all Qaeadian vessels. Besides tbe un
neighborly acts towards oar fishermen com
plained of, allusion is made to tbe unfriendly
disposition manifested on the part of Canada
in the maintenance of a claim to exclude tbe
citizens of the United States from the tree
navigation a# tba St. Lawrence. This, as onr
readers are aware, is an old story, having been
tbe subject of negotiation between the govern
ments of Great Britain and tbe United States
as far back as 1818, and earlier. A number
of diplomatic precedents are cited, together
with the Immense increase of population and
tonnage in tbe States which border on the
great lakes, to show the reasonableness of tbe
American claim to equal participation in tbe
navigation of tbe St. Lawrence, subject only
to tba British or Canadian right to regulate
tbe police of tbe river where it flows exclu
sively through British territory.
The unadjusted state of tbe Alabama claims
against Great Britain is referred to only to say
that tbe Cabinet of that country appear un
willing to concede any negligence or act dur
ing our war by which the United States has
justifiable complaint, and to suggest that au
thority be given for tbe settlement of tbe
claims of oqr citizens by our government, in
order that the latter may have their owner
ship as well os the responsible control of all
tbe demands against Create Britain.
The depressed state of tbe American ship
ping interests is alluded to, with tbe promise
that several propositions shall be laid before
Congress looking to a remedy for the evil.—
The message assumes that iron vessels cannot
be built in this country without government
assistance, and hints at the old exploded pol
icy of encouraging ship-building by means of
bounties.
The evils of a fluctuating and depressed
currency are deplored, as in tbe message a
1 year ago, and it is suggested that, with tbe
fall in tbe premium on gold, the time has pro
i bably come for wise legislation with the view
of placing our currency once more on a specie
basis.
On the subject of revenue reform, what tbe
President saya is entirely in accordance with
the views heretofore contended for in this pa
per, and then be adds:
“A true revenue reform cannot be made in a
day, but must be work of national legislation
and of time. As soon as the revenue can be
dispensed with, all duty should be removed
from coffee, tea and other articles of universal
use not produced by cursives. The necessi
ties of the country compel us to collect reve
nue from our imports. An army of assessors
■ and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the
citizen, buj that or a tariff for revenue is neces
sary.’!- , . .
Tbe reform of tbe franking privilege and
tbe adoption of the “correspondence card” in
our postal system is recommended.
The policy inaugurated by tbe present ad
ministration of employing Friends and other
misaibnary agencies for the purpose of civil
izing and managing tbe Indian is declared to
have worked well, and promises tbe best pos
sible results.
, The civil service reform also gets tbe bene
fit of tbe Executive approval. Tbe following
passage in tbe message will be bailed by all
the advocates of that reform with special plea
sure, and If occasion should require hereafter,
tbe President can remind the “adverse fac
tion” of bis words, and the propriety also of
their embracing ibis wholesome policy of the
people, in which the politicians have been
left so for behind their uncorrupted and sov
ereign masters. Says the President sensibly
and well; , /
’ * ‘ T respectfully call ybur attention to one a-
ImstfoMong standing, which like to
see remedied by .this Congress. It is a reform
14 tija civil service of Jhe eonf try. I would
j have it go beyond tbe mere fixing of the tenure
lof office of clerks and employees who do not
3 require ‘the advice and consent of the Senate’
to make their appointments complete. I would
* . have it to govern not the tenure, but the man
e ner of all appointments. There is no duty
which so much embarrasses the Executive and
the heads of departments as that of appoint
- ments, nor is thereany such arduous and thank
’ less task imposed on Senators and Representa
tives as that of finding places for constituents
' Tbe present system does not secure tbe besl
3 men, and often even not fit men for public
t places. The elevation and purification of the
civil service of the government will be hailed
3 with approval by the whole people of the U
; nited States.”
j It is proof of tbe strong hold which the
cause both of the revenue and of civil service
7 reform has taken upon tbe people of the c<*un-
J try when the administration thus spreads its
1 sails to catch the rising breeze. The hit at
B Senators and Representatives is. not bad.
' The President thinks that the day has pass
ed for regarding the public lands as a direct
“ source of revenue to the government. They
K should be rather administered in the interests
of the whole country for the purpose of pro
j- moting immigration and the settlement ol
new States. The President makes another
3 advance step also, to the measure of the peo
"r pie’s march, and discourages the policy o(
; granting government sudsidies to railroad or
' other corporations, either of land or money.
t From the recommendations in favor of erect
ing new buildings for State and the War De-
I partments, we infer that the President has
. not taken stock in any of the capital moving
projects which have been started.
After some minor suggestions, the message
’ closes with the following summary of the poli
cy of the administration, of which it can only
be said that if the practice be as good as tbe
r theory, there can be no room for opposition or
’ criticism:
5 “In conclusion, I would sura up the policy
, of the administration to be a thorough enforcc
j ment of every law, a faithful collection of every
tax provided for, economy in the disbursement
r of the same, a prompt payment of every debt ol
the nation, a reduction of tbe taxes as rapidly
• as the requirements of the country will admit,
i the reductions of taxation and tariff to be so
| arranged as to afford the greatest relief to the
f greatest number, honest and fair dealing with
I all other people, to the end that war, with all
( its blighting consequences, may be avoided,
but without surrendering any right obligation
due to us; a reform in the treatment of Indians
[ and in the whole civil service of the country,
1 and finally, in securing a pure, untrammeled
ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote
> may dc so just once, at each election, without
i fear of molestation or proscription on account
, of his political faith, nativity or color.”
, These expressions and concern about an
■ “untrammeled ballot,” &c., would, however,
i have much more consistency and force were
■ they accompanied with that recommendation
of general amnesty which would restore the
elective franchise to the many intelligent and
worthy citizens now arbitrarily deprived of it
in the interest of party.
The War In Europe.
The German numbers have again proved
too many for the French. The army of the
Loire, after several weeks of splendid man
euvering and some days of equally splendid
fighting, has been flanked out of Orleans, and
that city is again in the hands of the invading
armies. Paladines had previously taken a
position at Cheviily, nine miles north uf Or
leans, which be hoped to maintain, but was
so pressed upon all sides that be was compel
led, on Saturday, to retreat Tbe Prussians
pushed their advantages successfully, got ih
rear of Orleans, and threatened to shell the
city if it were not given up. The French
commander at Orleans, Gen. Pellieres, im
mediately spiked the fixed guns on the for
tifications, burned all stones that coule not
be removed, and retired,, with his corps, to
tbe south bank of the Loire, Paladines subse
i quently followed, tbe roads on tbe north
side being commanded by the Prussians,
and tbe whole army of tbe Loire fell
! back upon Blois. King William, on Sun
day night, telegraphs the Queen of Prus
sia some particulars of tbe successes of the
1 army 'of the Duke of Mecklenburg, after two
| days’ fighting, which resulted in the capture
, of St. Jean railway station and a suburb of
Orleans, with thirty guns and 1,000 prisoners,
1 Baioon advices from Paris, via Tours, give
particulars of tbe late movement of Ducrot,
, and state that Thursday, Ist inst., was passed
i iu burying the dead and succoring tbe wound
’ ed; that on Friday the Germans, Saxons and
; Wurtemburgers, 100,000 strong, attacked
’ with great impetuosity the French at Cham-
F pigny and in front of Villiers, but they failed
to carry tbe position, after seven hours' fight
-1 ing, and finally retreated, leaving their dead.
’ The Prussian loss was put down at 15,000 to
. 20,000. This was followed up on Saturday
’ by tbe French recrossing tbe Marne and tak
' ing positions, in which tbe enemy made no
, attempt to molest them,
i Details of tbe events leading to the evacua
■ tion of Orleans and tbe retreat of Geo. Pala
dioes confirm previous reports, and show that
J tbe Prussians, by attacking each French corps
. separately, in overwhelming numbers, finally
i succeeded in turning the French left, so as to
I
‘ render tbe loss of the city a necessity. The
■ government, it is stated, favored further re
-1 sistance, and opinions are divided as to tbe
' wisdom uf the retreat. A military commis
sion has therefore been instituted to iovesti-
I gate the matter. Several minor engagements
have since occurred between the Prussians
and tbe right wing of tbe army of tbe Loire,
- near Montargis, io which tbe French slaim to
have been successful. It is shown that Pala
-1 dins succeeded in conducting his retreat from
Orleans iu good order, and that bis army,
which is estimated at 200,000 strong, with
: 500 pieces of artillery, is in good spirits and
condition.
The authorities at Tours are using every
effort to inspire popular confidence, and while
insisting that the army of Paladines, though
1 suffering terribly in the recent battles, is still
intact in point of organization aud esprit,
they also give assurance that the forces in the
field will be recruited within a month to 800,-
000 strong. Under these circumstances the
government appeals for the continuance of
, steady faith iu tbe cause of the Republic.

Government vs. Railroad Bonds.
e
. Some time since a gentleman from Massachu
y setts visited New York for the purpose of
e selling $50,000 Government Bonds, and rein
r vesting in the best railroad securities he could
find, desiring to secure the adventage of one
- third more interest. After a week spent in
careful examination of the various enterprises
f in the market, he decided on dividing the
y amount between tbe First Martgage 7 per ct.
1 Gold Bonds of the Central Railroad of lowa,
0 1
e and the Bonds of another railraod. Upon fur
h ther consideration, however, he concluded to
1 take tbe full amount in Central fowas, believ
-3 ing them preferable to any other. Another
8 party in Central New York took $36,000 of
j the same bonds, and another in Pennsylvania
e $83,000, in each case other securities being
J sold, which stood at a higher price in the
market, but which were believed, upon full
s investigation, to be less profitable, and no more
, secure.— New York Evangelist.
