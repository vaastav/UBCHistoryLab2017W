GERMANS ARE SPEEDING
According to the French All the Bulgarian Attacks Have
Been Repulsed, But the Germans Claim the French
Were Compelled to Give Up Their Positions An Im
portant Battle Has Begun or is Impending at Mesopo

der Goltz, Has Taken Command of the Turkish Forces
Germans Have Concentrated Strong Reinforcements
and an Immense Amount of Artillery, With the Object
of Striking a Blow at the Allied Line in Flanders and
Artois.
London, Dec. 7, 10.13 p. m. Import
ant battles have begun or are impend
ing in four war theatres Mesopota
mia, where the German field marshal,
Baron Von der Goltz, lias taken com
mand of the Turkish forces and is
about to attack the British at Kut-El-Amara;
in northeastern Serbia,
where the Bulgarians have already
attacked the Anglo-French positions
and have been repulsed: on Gallipoli,
where, according to Turkish accounts,
the allies have taken the offensive and
in Belgium and France, where re
ports from Holland state, the Germans
have concentrated strong reinforce
ments and an immense amount of ar
tillery with the object of striking a
Mow at the allied line in Flanders
and Artois.
Except in Serbia the battles have
not developed beyond the preliminary
stage so far as is known, the artillery
of the different armies being
alone active. Along the Vnrdar-Cer-na-Ka-asu
front in Serbia, the Bulga
rians have already commenced their
Kttack against the .ng!o-French and
it is reported- that the German army
of General Von Goilwitz. has been re

Germans to Strike Before Allies Ar
rive. It is evidently the intention of the
Oermnns to strike hard before the al
lies who continue to land troops at
Saloniki have completed their prepar
ations. It is reported that the Ger
mans have 40,000 men available. There
is no indication of the Bulgarian or
Anglo-French strength, but one re
port says that five allied divisions
(nearly 100.000 men) have been land
ed thus far. The battle therefore,
will be one of the greatest importance.

SUFFRAGISTS AND ANTIS
IN STIRRING DEBATE.
For an Hour Before the National Dem
ocratic Committee.
Washington, Dec. 7. Woman suffra
gists in stirring speeches debated the
question of votes for women for an
hour today before the national demo
cratic committee.
The committee held public session in
a hotel ball room to hear the women
and the place was packed to the
doors.
Six suffrage leaders told the commit
teemen that the women of the nation
were looking to the democratic party
to champion a federal suffrage amend
ment, either in the present congress or
in the platform of the next democratic
convention. Two leaders of the na
tional society opposed to suffrage
argued that the party already had de
clared that suffrage is wholly a state
question and that moreover, a majori
ty of American women did not want to
be enfranchised.
The committee took no action, but
the members appeared to enjoy the de
bate thoroughly and applauded each
speaker liberally.
The hearing was arranged because
the congressional union for woman
suffrage, in session here this week,
wanted to tell the committeemen that
suffrage had become a national issue.
When the union's request went in the
National Society Opposed to Woman
Suffrage sent word to the committee
that they could not allow the claims
of the suffragists to go unchallenged.
Mrs. Florence Klley, of New York,
Miss Francis Joliffe, of California:
Mrs. Sara Bard Field of Oregon and
Mrs. Kate Gordon of New Orjeans
were among the speakers for the suf
fragettes. Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge,
of New York, president of the Na
tional Association Opposed to Wo
man Suffrage, and Mrs. A. J. George,
of Boston, spoke for the antis.

National Peace Council.
Orange, N. J., Dec. 7. Jacob C. Tay

Peace council, the activities of which
are under investigation by a federal

declared, is to attempt to bring about
universal peace and he announced that
within a few days he would call a con

live in Chicago, to pass a resolution
asserting that the sympathies of its
members are not pro-German.

TO BEAT THE ALLIES
garian attacks have been repulsed, but
the Germans claim that the French
were compelled to give up their posi

and Gerna rivers to avoid being en
veloped. No Settlement With Greece.
The situation for the allies is com
plicated by the attitude of the Greek
government, the negotiations at Ath

satisfactory conclusion and although
the Greek king has reaffirmed his
neutrality and repeated his assur
ances that Greek troops will never at

causes great anxiety.
Austrians in Montenegro.
The Austrians continue their offen

into Albania, "where the retreat is
rendered extremely difficult owing to
the cold weather and the bad roads
There are said to be one hundred
thouand Serbian troops and twenty
thousand refugees in Albania and it is
reported that the Serbians are taking
with them forty thousand Austrian
prisoners who were captured during
previous campaigns.
The position of the Serbians is ren

MADE A PLEA FOR A NEW
AWAKENING OF PATRIOTISM.
Former Senator Burton Addresses
Manufacturers and Business Men.
Chicago, Dec. 7. Speaking before
more than 200 manufacturers repre
senting business firms from Massa
chusetts to Iowa, at a conference on
the tariff, sponsored by the Illinois
Manufacturers' association. Former
Senator Theodore Burton of Ohio to
night made a plea for a new awaken
ing of patriotism.
'"We cannot reach the highest grade
of excellence on our political institu
tion unless there is a new awakening
of patriotism and a more potent de
sire to make all of our public activi
ties efficient and helpful means for
the upbuilding of the nation," said Mr.
Burton.
"After this war Is over it is quite
likely there will be a world-wide de
mand for more centralized and more
despotic government. Efficiency and
war will be advocated by many as the
most desirable quality among the na
tions. It rests with the people of the
United States to show that a republic
like ours can stand at the very fore
front in patriotism and citizenship and
display unsurpassed strength in storm
as well as in calm."
Mr. Burton advocated the establish
ment of a tariff commission. He al
so predicted' that the discussion of a
protective tariff was sure to assume
renewed and greater significance be
cause of the war.
INTELLIGENT WORK BY BOY
SCOUT SAVED A LIFE.
Checked Flow of Blood With an Im
provised Tourniquet.
Amsbury, Mass., Dec. 7. Prompt
and intelligent work by Archie Dow,
member of a local company of Boy
Scouts, saved the life late yesterday
of Malcolm Milton, who was bleeding
to death from a gunshot wound, ac
cording to the statement today by
physicians. Milton had been hunting
deer near Hampton Falls and the ac
cidental discharge of the weapon
severed an artery in his left arm. Dow
was attracted to the scene by cries
for help, realized that the man would
bleed to death unless heroic meas
ures were taken and with an impro
vised tourniquet quickly checked the
flow of blood.
Meanwhile physicians were summon
ed and Milton was removed to a hos
pital at Exeter, N. H. Although his
condition is regarded as critical, hos
pital authorities said he probably
would recover.

SHOWED WHERE "WOMAN
WAS HURLED OVER CLIFF
Charles D. Etchison Confessed He
Helped F. T. Price Murder Letter's
Wife.
Minneapolis, Minn., Dec. 7. Charles
D. Etchison, said to have signed a con
fession in Chicago that he was an ac
complice of Frederick T. Price in the
alleged murder of Price's wife on No
vember 28, 1914, today went with offi
cers to the place where he said Mrs.
Price was thrown over a cliff.
Etchison, a traveling salesman of
Washington, D. C, and Price, are un
der indictment for murder, but Price
today said that he was innocent of
the death of his wife, Mary Fridley
Price, a member of a leading Minne
sota family. Price said his wife acci
dentally fell over the cliff. After her
death, he sued the city of Minne
apolis for $7,500 damages for leaving
the roadside on the river bank unpro
tected. He later withdrew the suit.
Price is also charged with bigamy,
having had, it is said, three wives
without a divorce.
Etchison tonight stood on the edge
of the cliff over which Mrs. Price fell
and said that on the night of her
death she and her husband and him
self were riding in an automobile. He
said they stopped at the cliff and Mrs.
Price left the car when her engine said
there was engine trouble. He added
the woman was then hurled over the
embankment to the rocks below.
Etchison said that he and Price then
descended to the bank. Etchison said
he heard a sound that made him think
Price was beating his wife with a
stone.
Assistant County Attorney George
Armstrong said Etchison had told him
the alleged crime had preyed on his
mind until he was compelled to con
fess. He said Etchison had asserted
that the crime charged was planned
for three months; that he had refused
to participate despite an offer of $4,700
for his services, but had finally con
sented after Price had followed him to
the Pacific coast.
Mrs. Price is said to have received
$50,000 from her father the day before
her death.
LANSING GIVES CAUSE FOR
DISSATISFACTION WITH BOY-ED
And Von Papen Communicated to
Germany Through Von Bernstorff.
Washington, Dec. 7. Secretary
Lansing has communicated to Germany
through Count Von Bernstorfr, the Ger
man ambassador, the reasons which
caused the L nited States government
to request the immediate withdrawal
cf Captain Boy-Ed and Captain Franz
von Papen, respectively naval and mil
itary attaches of the embassy here.
In the communication, which is be
lieved to have reached the Berlin for
eign office today, Mr. Lansing is un
derstood to have stan d that the naval
and military activities of the attaches
constituted their principal offenses. It
is said that there was no discussion of
facts relating to the reasons for the
state department's request nor any dis
closure of the department's sources of
information.
Whether Germany expected a dis
cussion of the facts has not been made
known. Officials are waiting with in
terest to see whether the Berlin for
eign office will be satisfied with the
stating of the broad, general reasons.
The opinion seemed to prevail that
Germany might, with the reasons be
fore it, instruct the ambassador to
6end the attaches away without fur
ther delay. In some quarters, how
ever, it was thought another com
munication might come from Berlin.
Secretary Lansing declined to com
ment upon the subject for publication
today, and the German embassy was
also reticent.

His Right Side Is Paralyzed and He
Has Lost the Power of Speech.
Derby, Conn.. Dec. 7. Judge William
H. Williams of the superior court was
stricken with apoplexy while on his
way home here from Bridgeport today.
His right side is paralyzed and he has
lost the power of speech. Dr. G. A.

him, says that the condition of Judge
Williams is serious, but not neces
sarily fatal. If there are no more
hemorrhages, Dr. Shelton Is of the
opinion that he will recover.
Judge Williams was stricken a few
hours after he had sentenced Clitus
H. King, the Fairfield lawyer, to im
prisonment. He walked from the
courthouse to the railroad station in
Bridgeport to take the train for Derby.
Friends noticed that there was some
thing unusual about his appearance
and it was seen that he could not speak.

of Former Chief Justice Torrance, and
Mrs. Starr Sperry of this city, both
neighbors of Judge Williams, were on
the train and they rendered what as
sastance they could. Upon the arrival

St. Louis Gels
Dem. Convention
WILL CONVENE WEDNESDAY,
JUNE 14, AT NOON
ONLY TWO BALLOTS
Convention Adopted Resolution Call
ing for Renomination and Reelec
tion of Woodrow WiRson.
Washington, Dec. 7. The democratic
national convention of 1916 will be held
in St. Louis, beginning Wednesday,
June 14, at noon. The democratic na
tional committee tonight named the
convention city and adopted resolu
tions calling for the renomination and
reelection of Woodrow Wilson as "the
trusted leader of national democracy."
St. Louis Led from Start.
Chicago and Dallas contested with
St. Louis for the honor of the conven
tion, but St. Louis easily led from the
start and won on the second ballot.
When the trend of the voting was seen
Texas moved that the choice of Bt.
Louis be made unanimous. Dallas held
second place on the first ballot, but
was displaced by Chicago on the sec
ond roll call.
Choice Made Unanimous.
The result of the first ballot was:
St. Louis 25, Dallas 14, Chicago 13. On
the second ballot the vote was: St.
Louis 28, Chicago 15, Dallas 9. The
majority for St. Louis was gained on
this ballot, when John T. McGraw
arose near the end of the call and
changed West Virginia's vote from
Chicago to the Missouri city. Then
the choice was made unanimous.
It has been customary for national
conventions to begin work on Tues
day. The fact that Tuesday fell on the
13th next year may or may not have
had something to do with the deter
mination. The official explanation,
however, was to the- effect that the
convention would not require more
than three or four days to complete
its work and it would not be too late
in the week to start on Wednesday.
Political leaders in Washington to
night regarded it as practically cer
tain that Chicago will be selected for
the republican convention when the
national committee of that party meets
here next Tuesday. The date for this
convention probably will be late in
June.
Each City Bid $100,000.
Each of the three cities contestin
for the democratic convention put in
a bid of $100,000. St. Louis .placed in
the hands of the chairman New York
drafts for that amount. Dallas offered
a certified check, while Chicago pre
sented a pledge from the Association
of Commerce to contribute $100,000 on
call of the treasurer of the democratic
committee.
Opening Was a Love Feast.
The national committee was in ses
sion almost continuously from 11.30
a. m. until late tonight, completing
details of convention arrangements,
discussing financial ways and means
for the coming campaign and debating
various subjects of party interest. The
opening of the session was given the
atmosphere of a love feast when
Thomas J. Pence of North Carolina
a protege of Secretary of the Navy
Daniels, was elected secretary and in
a speech of acceptance declared reports
or differences between himself and Na
tional Chairman W. F. McCombs were
entirely without foundation.
DEFENSE OPENS IN TRIAL
OF FORMER N. H. DIRECTORS.
Testimony to Prove That They Were
Acting in Accord With the Law.
New York, Dec. 7. The defense at
the trial of the eleven former directors
of the New York, New Haven and
Hartford railroad, charged with con
spiring to monopolize the transporta
tion system of New England, began to
day the introduction of evidence in
tended to prove that official approval
was given by the authorities of Massa
chusetts and other New England states
for every railroad the New Haven ac
quired. The indicated purpose of the
testimony, elicited from Charles S.
Mellen on cross examination, was to
show that the directors, with know
ledge of this approval, had no criminal
Intent to violate the law and presumed
that they were acting in accord with
the law.
The New York. Providence and Bos
ton railroad was acquired by an act of
the Rhode Island legislature, Mr. Mel
len testified, and the lease of the Old
Colony was approved by the attorney
general of Massachusetts. The New
York and New England, which the gov
ernment alleges the New Haven forced
into receivers' hands, was leased with
the approval of the Massachusetts
railroad commission. The commission's
grant of the petition therefor was read
into the record.
Mr. Mellen testified further that
William H. Moody, attorney general of
the United States under Theodore
Roosevelt, and later supreme court
justice, refused to entertain a com
plaint in 1904 that the acquisition of
the New York and New England was a
violation of the Sherman law. Mr.
Mellen said that when he heard of the
complaint he went to Washington and
saw Mr. Moody.
"He told me," the witness continued,
"that there was no reason for action
in th matter by the department of Jus
tice. He said it would cause a revolu
tion in New England if they attempted
to take the New York and New Eng
land away from the New Haven."
Roosevelt Advocates Military Train
ing at Harvard.
Cahbridgo, Mass., Dec. 7. Harvard
university should establish as a part

of thorough military training." Former
President Theodore Roosevelt said in
an article on preparedness which ap
peared in the Harvard Advocate, an
undergraduate magazine, tonight.
Wireless Message From Peace Ship.
New York, S. S. Oscar II, by Wire
less via Caye Race. Dec. 7. Governor
L. B. Hanna of North Dakota, today

of State Lansing urging him to pro
vide members of the Ford peace party

American Tank
Steamer Fired On
BY AN AUSTRIAN SUBMARINE
OFF THE ISLAND OF CRETE
ONE MAN WOUNDED
Navy Department Notified by Com
mander of the Cruiser Des Moines,
Now at Canea, Island of Crete.
Washington, Dee. 7. Word from the
cruiser Des Moines was received today
at the navy department to the effect
that the American boat sending a "S.
O. S." call out last Saturday oft Crete
was the Standard Oil tanker Petrolite,
which was fired on. presumably by an
Austrian submarine. One man was
wounded, advices stated.
The Petrolite sailed from New York
Nov. 7 for Alexandria, Egypt. She
passed Gibraltar Nov. 21.
The contents of the message were
communicated by the navy department
to the state department.
The message made no mention of
the steamer, nor did it give the na
tionality of the man injured, but said
the injuries were slight.
Message from the Des Moines.
The despatch from the Des Moines
came from Canea. Island of Crete, and
reported that the following message
had been picked up Sunday:
"American steamship Petrolite. Alex
andria to New York, attacked by a
submarine this (Sunday) morning - at
6.20, longitude 32.25 north, latitude 36.8
west. One man not seriously injured."
Looked Like Big Cruiser.
The commander of the cruiser said
he had obtained from the commander
of the Petrolite the additional informa
tion that the submarine which attack
ed the American steamer flew the Aus
trian flag and "looked like a big
cruiser.
The man who was wounded was
struck by a fragment of an explosive
shell fired from the submarine. The at
tack took place about 350 miles west of
Alexandria and just off the western
end of the lsiand of Crete, distant
about 120 miles.
Awaiting Further Facts.
The navy department promptly
transmitted the report to the state
department, where it was said that
nothing oould be done until further
facts were supplied. It was inferred
from the despatch that the Petrolite
had been fired upon during the course
of a successful attempt to escape. If
her' captain disregarded a demand to
submit to search, there probably will
be no attempt to make a diplomatic
incident of the case.
Secretary Daniels said he had not
Instructed the commander of the Des
Moines to make any further investiga
tion, and it is assumed that no more
will be heard from the Petrolite until
she arrives at Gibraltar.
NO DIRECT WORD TO
STANDARD OIL CO.
About Attack by Submarine on the
Petrolite in the Mediterranean.
New York, Dec. 7. The Standard Oil
company had received no direct word
late today concerning the attack by a
submarine on the company's tank
steamer Petrolite in the Mediterranean,
as reported in a message from the
cruiser Des Moines to the navy depart
ment. Officials of the export department
thought that after the captain of the
tanker had communicated with the
Des Moines he would not endeavor to
report to the New York office unless
he touched at some port.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE OF
INTEREST TO BRITISH PRESS.
Comment on Monroe Doctrine and
Revelations of German Machinations.
London, Dec. 8, 1.05 a. m. President
Wilson's message proves of unusual in
terest to the British press as shown
by the editorials in the morning papers.
In the view of the Daily New3. "it is
doubtful whether the Monroe doctrine
will ever be tenable again, experience
having shown that the United States
can no longer rely upon political isola
tion founued on geographical detach
ment, which has largely lost its mean
ing." The Daily News argues that it is
only the British navy which today
stands in effective defense of the Mon
roe doctrine, and that "if Germany
were victorious in this war the United
I States guarantees of the independence
Ul Llie SMclltTSS Ul wwum .ill. v i 1 , vjuiu
not be worth paper on which that doc
trine is written."
Admitting that President Wilson's
claim that the American policy of neu
trality has been of enormous value to
the world is justified and in its opera
tion had worked to the incalculable
advantage of the allies, the News re
fers to President Wilson's difficulties
In dealing with the German campaign
owing to constitutional restrictions and
says:
"President Wilson has the courage
and executive genius for an emergency
and we don not doubt that his de
mand for power to deal with the sit
uation will be readily granted."
The Daily Chronicle says: "After the
amazing revelations of German machi
nation, which appear still far from
complete, one would be surprised if
th6 United States tolerated the pres
ent condition of things much longer.
It would be strange if the Amer
ican people did not insist on its gov
ernment taking strong measures to
restore security of life and property on
American soil and In American ports."
