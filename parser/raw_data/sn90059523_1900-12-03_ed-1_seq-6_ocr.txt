A TRIO OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS
ENTITLED TO PLACES ON ALL
WESTERN TEAM
•ACCORDING TO ONE AUTHORITY
Aune, i'n«t- and Flynn Are the
Ones That AVould Be Se
lected by This
Expert.
Because of the many surprises in the
football world this fall, and particularly
those pi" Thanksgiving day, an all-West- j
-* era team, no matter how arranged, will
be open to much criticism, says Walter ;
Scott Kennedy in the Chicago Tribune. j
The one here given, however, seems to !
me to be the most logical choice. It is
picked with a view to defensive work
as well as to ground gaining ability, and {
represents the strongest possible com- j
bination of legitimate Western players.
Loft end Aune, Minnesota
Left tackle Warner, Iowa;
Left guard Rioidan, Wisconsin ;
Center Page, Minnesota j
.Right, guard Flynn, Minnesota j
Right tackle Curtis, Wisconsin j
Right end Snow, Michigan
Quarter back Williams, lov\a :
Left half back Henry, Chicago j
Full back Driver, Wisconsin ;
Right half back Larson, Wisconsin ;
There are so many good men who fall j
just short of "all-Western" possibilities :
.. that a second team cannot be picked 'with I
absolute fairness. j
Aune, of Minnesota, is chosen mainly
for his ground gaining ability, though I
his defensive work is not by any means ]
poor. Sheldon, of Chicago, if he had
played the end position this year, would j
have been a more popular choice, and i
the Wisconsin ends, Juneau and Abbott, J
•j are not far behind the Minnesota man in !
b all-around work. J
' Snow, captain of Michigan, Is without j
doubt the choice for the other end. In !
the Chicago-Michigan game he gave the
prettiest exhibition of up-hill fighting
. and tackling that as ever seen in the
West.
EASY TO PICK THE TACKLES.
The tackles are easy. Warner, of
lowa, and Curtis, of Wisconsin, stand I
out clearly from the rest of the candi- !
dates. Both are good ground gainers, <
and both put up an almost impregnable ]
defense. Warner would be useful as a i
punter, and is probably the best in the ;
West, while Curtis is without equal in ;
his ability to advance the ball. i
Riordan, Wisconsin's field general, is .
a popular choice for guard. He carries ;
the ball well—a requirement rather over- j
looked in Western guards— is strong
defensively. Flynn, of Minnesota, is
picked entirely for his defensive work.
He is a giant in strength, and handles
himself well. Flannagan and Ervln, of \
Chicago; Ward, of Northwestern, and
Marks, of Michigan, are all close to
Flynn, and one could not be far wrong
in placing any one of them at the top.
At center, Page, Minnesota's captain,
Is probably the best, although Scow, of
Wisconsin or Speed or Mac Nab, of Chi
cago, would force him out considerably.
Speed is particularly good at tackling
cut at the ends, but Page is better in
4.11 around work.
There is only one choice for quarter
back Williams of lowa. He is a good
field general, handles the ball cleanly,
and carries back punts in great shape.
Hunter, of Northwestern, is his equal
as a Held general, but barring the North
western-lowa game lias not this year
displayed the defensive ability for which
he has been noted in past years. Garry,
of Chicago, in the Thanksgiving gam«
showed top-notch form, but it is not
quite fair to pick a man on his showing
in one game. Tratt, of Wisconsin,
py-ises the ball well, and Is a good
tackier, but has never attempted to run
his team, and Is evidently not a good
general. Weeks, of Michigan, is a better
* man than Tratt, both defensively and
offensively.
LARSON AND HENRY.
Larson, Wisconsin's smashing half
back, leads for his position, with Henry,
of Chicago, as a running mate. Larson
'nits the line harder than any other back
in the West, and does almost as well
around the ends, while as a defensive
player he is a whirlwind. Henry is as
good defensively, and, playing with a
team like Wisconsin's, would be almost,
If rot quite, as good a ground gainer.
Cocbems, of Wsiconsin, and Sheldon, of
Chicago, are not far behind these men,
although both are new to the position,
having; been moved in from ends. Shel
don, in Lis one game at half, showed re
markable ability, and should be a star
of the first magnitude next year.
Little Edson, of lowa, and Johnson,
of Northwestern, both have claims to
consideration, but neither is quite up to
the- leaders In all around ability.
The full back position is a little harder
to fill. The season has not developed
any real stars for this certainly
none equal to Slaker or ODea of last
year. Probably Driver, of Wisconsin,
comes the nearest to last year's stand
ard. Driver punches the line almost as
hard as Larson, and punts well. Per
kins, the hero of the Chicago-Michigan
game, might have some claims to the
place, but his work, although of the
highest order, in the one game, was ma
terially strengthened by the men helping
him—mainly by Teddie Rich.
lowa's little captain, Griffith, is also a
factor, but is not quite up to Driver's
class, while Robertson, of Purdue, al
though not much as a line bucker, should
be considered on account of his kicking
ability.
There are undoubtedly many more
good players scattered throughout the
West who deserve mention and consid
eration In tne discussion of an all-West
ern eleven, but it is impossible for one
man to get even a meager knowledge of
the work of all such players. There
are, no doubt, a number of men on such
teams as Knox, Dixon, Monmouth, Case,
Simpson, etc., who, if brought into
prominence on the larger teams would
change the face of things. Still, this
all-Western team represents the flower
of the middle Western football world,
and would compare favorably with a
similar aggregation of Eastern stars.

Khaki club, acted as secretary. --Samuel
Karpf, secretary of the Bowling congress,
was present, and outlined the more im
portant rules governing contests played
in leagues affiliated with the congress,
and in only a few essential points were
the rules'used at present found to differ
from those referred to by Mr. Karpf.
After a long discussion, it was, upon
motion, decided to appoint a committee
to pass upon the expediency of counting
the three games played in each match
as three separate games, instead of
grouping them into a series, constituting
a match. The latter plan is now in vogue
in the city league, and the former is em
ployed in almost all large leagues else
where. , -
The committee as appointed by the pres
ident, is composed of Huntsman, of the
Crawfords; Hindren, of the Capitols;
Riley, of the St. Anthony Hill club; No
lan, of the Gophers, and Lyons. The
committee will meet this evening, and
report at the next regular meeting of the
board.
Another matter that will be considered
at the next meeting of the board is that
of joining the American Bowling congress
HAND-BALL EXPERTS AT IT.
One Tournament Match Played Ye«
terday—Many Scheduled tor Today.
Only one match was played ln the hand
ball tournament yesterday, and In that
Fitzgibbons and F. Nelson beat Blakely
and Kennedy two straight matches, by
21-9, and 21-5.
All the afternoon the enthusiasts of the
game were engaged in whitewashing the
walls of the alley, in order to secure as
much light as possible for the remaining
games. The alley is exceedingly fast for
an enclosed court, and the players need
plenty of light to accurately follow the
movements of the lively rubber ball. The
tournament will be continued today; some
of the matches will be played in the
morning, but the majority are scheduled
for the afternoon.
MISS DREW DENIES IT.
Vaudeville Stair Says She Will Not
Marry Jeffries.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 2—Dorothy
Drew, the vaudeville star, who is play
ing an engagement at one of the local
theaters, this evening denied the story
sent out today that she is to marry "Jim"
Jeffries, the champion pugilist. Jeffries
paid a visit to Dorothy Drew today. The
champion "fistman" came up from New
York early this morning and had a long
talk with Miss Drew at her hotel. Jef
fries went back to New York this after
noon. His visit to the vaudeville queen
was used as a basis for a story that they
were about to be married. At the theater
this evening Miss Drew said:
"There is no truth in that story; but it
is true that Mr. Jeff and I may star
together in the same company. He came
here to discuss such a plan.

TODAY WILL BE QUITE UNIMPOR
TANT IN BOTH BRANCHES
OF CONGRESS
ANNUAL MESSAGE TUESDAY
As Both Houses Will Adjourn To
day in Respect to the Mem
ory of the Members
Who Have Died.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—The senate
will be called to order at 12 o'clock to-,
morrow, but beyond the probable read
ing of the president's message will trans
act no business, as the announcement of
the death, during the recess, of Senators
Davis and Gear, when the message has
been read, will bring the sitting to a
close. Senator Allison will make the
announcement In the case of his late
colleague, Senator Gear, and Senator
Nelson will arrive in time to perform
similar service concerning Senator Davis.
These announcements will be preceded
by the ceremony of swearing in the new
members who this year are Mr. Dolliver,
who has been appointed to succeed
Senator Gear, and Mr. Dillingham, who
takes the place formerly occupied by
Senator Ross, of Vermont, and the ap
pointment of the usual committees to
wait upon the president and the house
of representatives. -
Mr. Frye expects to get up the shipping
subsidy bill on Tuesday or Wednesday,
and in doing this to have the Spooner
Philippine bill displaced- This will be
the beginning of the important work of
the session, and upon the success or fail
ure of the scheme may depend much of
the future course of proceedings for the
entire session. In order to accomplish
this result it will be necessary first to
get the consent of the Republican com
mittee on order of business, and to this
end a meeting of that committee will
be held after the adjournment of the
senate Monday afternoon. Mr. Frye said
today that he had already conferred with
a majority of the members of that com
mittee; that he felt sure he would have
no difficulty in securing their assent to
the proposed change. Thus far there
has been no consultation with Demo
cratic senators, but the friends of the
shipping bill do not look for opposition
to the taking up of the bill from that
source. A motion to take up the meas
ure is not debatable under the senate
rules.and they are confident of a majority
on a vote If a roll call should be de
manded. It is probable that a friendly
arrangement will be made with Senator
Morgan, who has the Nlcaraguan bill in
charge, that bill being on the calendar
as a special order, for Dec. 10.
MAT CONSIDER THE TREATY.
There Is some talk of an effort" during
the week to get up the. Hay-Paunce
fote treaty In executive session, but there
is as yet no definite programme to this
end. A movement is on foot now to
secure the assent of the committee on
foreign relations •to the abandonment of
Davis' amendment to the treaty for the
fortification of the proposed canal.
The usual custom of adjourning over
from Thursday until the following Mon
day during the first weeks of the ses
sion probably will be departed from this
session. This is the desire of the Re
publican leaders now here and they
say there will probably be no such ad
journment this week.
CAUCUS ON ARMY BILL.
Democrats of the House Will Con
sider It Today.
WASHINGTON, Dee. 2.—The leaders
of the house are preparing- to press with
great vigor the important business of
the short session of congress, which con
venes tomorrow. Already considerable
preliminary committee work has been
done on the important measures—<a bill
for the reduction of the war revenue
taxes, an army re-organization bill, the
river and harbor bill and several ap
propriation bills —and the legislative mill
will start under a full head of steam.
The army re-organization bill is consider
ably urgent, owing to the possibility of
its meeting strenuous opposition after it
reaches the senate, and it is the inten
tion of the leaders to get it out of the
way at the earliest possible moment.
It will be reported probably Tuesday
and It will be taken up at once unless
after further consideration it is decided
to *let the legislative, executive and ju
dicial appropriation bill, which also will
be ready on Tuesday, in ahead of it. ;
The Democrats will caucus on the army I
bill Monday and the indications now are
that they will offer as a substitute for
the permanent re-organization measure
a bill extending for two or three years
the present law for a provisional army.
The bill to reduce the war revenue taxes
has been practically completed by the
Republican members of the ways and
means committee and it will be submit
ted to the full committee Tuesday unless
in the meantime a caucus of the Re
publicans should be found advisable.
Some of the Republican members are
not satisfied with the list of articles re
lieved of taxation by the bill, and if too
much opposition becomes evident wlien
the house convenes on Monday the
leaders probably will call a conference
to caucus for the purpose of adjusting
and harmonizing differences.
GROUT BILL. COMES THURSDAY.
Thursday the Grout oleeomargarine bill
will ccme up as a special order under
the rule made at the last session. It
imposes a tax of 10 cents per pound on
oleeomargarine, butterine or manufact
ured butter and imitation butter. It
has strong backing from "the dairy in
terests, and while it will meet with
warm opposition from the interests that
are antagonizing its passage when it
reaches a vote, its passage is regarded
as a foregone conclusion. Two days, it
is thought, will suffice for its considera
tion. Saturday, under a special order
made last session, will be devoted to
eulogies on the life, character and public
services of the late Representative Har
mon, of Pennsylvania, who, for several
years enjoyed the distinction of being
the member holding the record for
longest contlnuons service and therefore
entitled to the sobriquet "father of the
house."
No business will be transacted at the
session tomorrow beyond the probable
reading of the president's message. The
deaths of the late Representative Daly,
of New Jersey, and Hoffecker, of Dela
ware, which occurred during the recess,
as well as the deaths of Senators Davis
and Gear, will be announced immediately
after the roll call and the house will ad
journ at once out of respect to their
memories.

REBELS HAD TO RETIRE.
Brisk Engagement at Chagres Won
by State Troops.
KINGSTON, Jamaica; Dec. 2—Advices
brought from Colon today by the Royal
mail steamship Don, indicate the con
tinuation of rebel activity in Colombia.
Last week a strong force of insurgents
attacked the town of -Chagres, fifteen
miles from Colon, and 800 government
troops were sent immediately to relieve
the place. The rebels resisted stoutly,
but were obliged -. to retire. Before the
Don left it was believed at Colon that
the Insurgents had changed their plan
and would concentrate against Colon in
stead of Panama, > owing to the strict
precautions taken by, the government at
the latter place.
; Martial law was- being strictly en
forced in Colon, and large numbers of
persons had been imprisoned.
The U. S. S. Bancroft and the British
second-class curiser ' Intrepid were at

Men who successfully canvass Industrial Insurance and who approach healthy people to talk to
them of death with the purpose of interesting them to the extent of insuring their lives, must them
selves be alert and lively. A healthy appearance and a nervous system in perfect order are worth
much to such'a man. Mr. James E. Butcher is one of the best known men in the 34th Ward of
Philadelphia. He resides with his interesting family on 55th Street above Landsdown Avenue and
is a highly successful insurance agent. In the political affairs of the 34th Ward he is also an im
portant factor and in both of these capacities good health, good nature and a good digestion each play
an important part. Mr. Butcher relates that once he had a torpid liver for some time and as a con
sequence his whole system became deranged. He was a good deal broken up until a friend, one
day, told him to try RIPANS TABULES. "I did so," said he, " and still continue to take them
whenever I feel a return of my old ailment. They keep me strong and hearty and have proved my
best friend. lam confident that RIPANS TABULES will always be found highly beneficial to any
one who needs either a stomach or nerve tonic." ■';.' ;:

mittee will recommend to th« next gen
eral assembly that a supplementary
creed- be adopted. I should say that the
new article would be enother standard
of doctrine in addition to the four great
principles now contained in the old creed
and authorized and sanctioned by the
Presbyterian church. All the essentials
of our faith will probably be contained
in this supplement, but put in such form
as to be - clear, to the popular I mind
Some of our creed has been misconstru-

have asked for merely an explanatory

Or more men were in a highly heated

Four Italians were afterwards arrested.
