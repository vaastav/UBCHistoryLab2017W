,To Our Subscribers.
As the Christmas time approaches,
when the hearts of all are filled with
kindness and generosity toward their
fellowman, we herewith express the
hope that all those who are in arrears
for their subscription to The Irish
Standard will send in their amount to
the office and thus gladden the hearts
ot the publishers. We feel that an
earnest effort on our part has been
made during the past year to give our
patrons a paper worthy of their sup
port and good will and there is no
more pleasing way to show an appre
ciation of the value of our work than
to pay the publishers their due. All
remittances received will be acknowl
edged with thanks. Our city subscrib­
ers will oblige us by calling at the of
fice, 51 Fourth street south.
Russia is surely reaching for liberty.
It seems that she is bent upon obtain

She seems unable to wait for the meth

demption.
The recent conference of the Prot
estant churches of New York present
ed some hopeful signs. In the first
place it showed that the Protestants
are beginning to learn what a stumb
ling block their multiplicity of creeds
Is to the Christian religion. The fact
that the conference was held shows
that there Is a feeling of the need of
unity.
Senator Piatt's frank admission that
the contributions of the insurance
companies to candidates for office put
those candidates under more or less
obligations not to attack the "inter
ests" that is to say the corporations
contributing ought to dispose of the
pretense on the part of officers of In
surance companies that their contri
butions were made for the support of
great principles.
It some of the Minneapolis papers
that are so exercised over someone
Setting a drink on Sunday, had dis
played equal energy in exposing life
Insurance as conducted by some Min
neapolis concerns, many thousand
policy holders would feel grateful. The
insurance commissioner might turn
his telescope away from New Tork for
a while and fasten it on Minneapolis
With good results, says the Ldttle Falls
Herald.
"W^m. Fltzlmmons, who was paroled
from the state prison at Stillwater a
short time ago, visited his aged parents
In this city last week, sayB the Anoka
Free Press. Those who had known the
young man before his misfortune did
Hot recognize to the pale, emaciated

oned, hearty and jovial youth of
former years. However, liberty Is
sweet under all conditions, and it was
frith gratefulness In his heart that he

priced cotton is both a blessing and
a curse to the South. A blessing to
those who raise it and are contented
with the price a curse to those who

who strive to make a fortune through

The Minneapolis Club, the chief
business men's club of Minneapolis,
has just set an example of law ob
servance that should be followed by
similar organizations, says The Com
moner. Recently Mayor Jones decid
ed to "shut down the lid" as the saying
goes, and as a result Minneapolis has
been "dry" for several Sundays in suc
cession. As an incorporated club
the Minneapolis club could keep its
buffet open on Sunday, but at a meet
ing of the directors it was decided to
set an example, and as a result the
Minneapolis club Is as "dry" on Sun
day as the rest of the city. The club's
action takes from the opponents of
Sunday observance one of their chief
arguments. "The saloon is the poor
man's club," they exclaim. "You close
the poor man's club on Sunday, but
you let the rich man's club remain
wide open." But in Minneapolis the
'rich man's club" is also closed. The
action of the managers of the Minne
apolis club is worthy of commendation.
MARK TWAIN.
Last week Mark Twain celebrated
his seventieth birthday. He well ex
emplifies the old saying that one is
as old as he feels. He has had his
full share of the sorrows of life yet
humor has kept him young. The sun
shine of his nature has sufficed to dis
pel the shadows. He is today much
the most widely-read American writer.
His name is known and his works are
read by people to whom the name of
Emerson is a mystery. His works
have been printed in many language!)
and the reason for his popularity is
not hard to find. His writings have
been read because they display origin
ality. They show that the author
knows human nature and that he
has mingled with the people who
do the world's work. But there
have been others who knew human
nature and who mingled with the same
class of people yet who picture life
In a different way from that in which
Mark Twain sees it. Mark Twain is
different from other writers because
be was born with an unusual amount
of humor in his make-up. He belongs
not with the writers of culture but
with the writers who receive their
gifts from nature. He has lived with
the common people and has received
his impressions at first hand. Other
wise he could not have written "Life
on the Mississippi," "The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn" and the "Adven
tures of Tom Sawyer." Mark Twain
is not only a great writer but he is
a good man. It should be remembered
at this time that when disaster over
took him he met his obligations, not
only those he was legally forced to
meet, but he held himself to strict ac
count and met those obligations which
he was not legally bound to meet.
A WARM RECEPTION.
Sarah Bernhardt, who is now en
gaged in a campaign of extracting Am
erican gold jy exhibitions of manu
factured emotions encountered a situ
ation in Quebec which no doubt pro
duced in her the real emotions in
stead of feigned ones. If the press re
port of the affair is correct the "Di
vine Sarah" was saluted with a shower
9f unsavory eggs all because she said
uncomplimentary things about the
French-Canadians and their priests.
Now, the French-Canadians have not
arrived at that acme of culture like
their blood relations in gay Paris,
where people spend their time and In
genuity In efforts to Improve upon the
laws of nature. Neither have they ar
rived at that state of unbelief where
they deny Christ and his Church and
worship mammon. The French-Can
adians are a law-abiding and a God
fearing people. They become at an
early age parents of large families and
in many other ways they show that
they live In accordance with natural
law and obey God's law. The divine
Sarah with all her art does not know
as much as the poor Canadian-French
woman who looks after her husband's
household and rears her children to
respect the laws of man and God. She
probably merited the reception that she
received. We have not yet on the West
ern Continent arrived at that dread
ful condition in which the French cap
ital now flnds itself. It Is popular in
Paris to deny Christ and to revile his
Church. It entitles one to Immediate
popularity If he or she is able to say
something particularly uncompliment
ary of the priests and nuns of the
Catholic Church. Sarah has found out
that Quebec, although French, is not
Parisian French. Quebec Is loyal to
the Church of the French people loyal
to the Church which all the French
people outside of Paris worship In, as
Sarah undoubtedly found out Of
course, we can not say that we are
In favor of the rotten egg method of
argument but we do claim that espe
cially persuasive arguments are neces
sary In some cases.
THE UNITED 8TATES SENATE.
When the Senate of the United
States convened last Monday two
chairs were vacant because ot the con
viction of their former occupants for
crime. One of these chairs was that
of Senator John H. Mitchell, of Ore
gon, and the other that of Senator
Joseph R. Burton, of Kansas, each of
whom has been sentenced to six
months in prison and fined In addition
thereto. Both have appealed from the
decisions against thejn for the pur
pose of prolonging the inevitable until
the ends of their terms, if possible.
Neither one can hope to be re-elected.
Senator Mitchell is an old man, broken
in health as well as morally. Burton
is a young man prohibited by the sen
tence of court from ever holding any
office of honor, trust or emolument un
der tl\e Federal Government.
These two instances should be a
warning to the highest legislative body
in the world that Its -members, al
though powerful, are nevertheless sub
ject to the criminal laws of the coun
try. The Senate of the United States
has in recent years become very un
popular with the masses of the peo
ple. Its high-handed methods of block
ing legislation have merited for it the
public dislike In which It is held. It
would be strange indeed if the dis
graceful situation which presented it
self to the members of the United
States Senate on Monday last should
not cause serious reflection. The two
absent ones are not the only lessons.
Worse even than the conviction of Bur
ton and Mitchell was the presence in
the senate chamber of three others
whose names have been placed upon
the role of dishonor. The two sen
ators from New York, Chauncey M.
Depew and Thomas C. Piatt, and Sen
ator Penrose, of Pennsylvania, the dis
credited leader of the shattered Re
publican machine, were pointed out by
more than one. Their names have be
come by-words of disgrace and shame.
It Is probable that the people of the
United States do not even yet appre
ciate the full effect of the terrible dis
grace that has been brought upon our
government by those entrusted with
the highest offices In the gift of the
people outside of the presidency. De
pew's connection with the insurance
scandals has placed him so low in pub
lic estimation that were he to be a
candidate again it is probable that he
would not receive a single vote for the
office to which he was elected one year
ago. He Is not only politically dead
but he Is socially ostracised. As he
walked Into the senate chamber last
Monday there were hundreds of peo
ple who commented upon the crushed
appearance of this once jaunty story
teller and railroad president. Unlike
most political criminals Depew has suf
fered in his own estimation by the rude
knocks which have been dealt to him
for, unlike many political tricksters,
he does care for public opinion. His
colleague Piatt is almost equally dis
credited, uut PltiLt is not sensitive
about what people think of him.
Precedent and courtesy made it the
duty of Senator Penrose, of Pennsyl
vania, to lead to the vice president's
desk his future colleague Senator-elect
Knox. The incongruity of the situation
must have been apparent to almost ev
ery onlooker. Penrose, the fallen
leader of the discredited Republican
machine of Pennsylvania, introducing
to the Senate of the United States the
future leader of Republican politics in
that state.
Although United States senators are
not elected by direct vote of the peo
ple, senators will no doubt, be made to
feel through the present situation more
strongly than they have ever felt be
fore their responsibility to the people.
There are other members who are by
no means free from attack. There are
several who have secured their seats
through dishonorable methods and
whose chief influence in the senate is
In the promotion of dishonorable deals.
There are, however, several new sen
ators whose character and manhood
will help to raise the tone of the sen
ate. There is Warner, of Missouri,
Rayner, of Maryland, La Follette, of
Wisconsin, Burkett of Nebraska all
men of force and individuality. They,
at least, do not come to the senate as
representatives of railroads, protected
Interests and trusts. Their presence
will help to free the senate from those
who have brought It to disgrace. The
situation Is not without hope, dis
graceful as It Is.
PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
The president's message has been de
livered to congress. Messages of the
presidents are as a usual thing docu
ments to be printed and not to be read.
It is probably true that more people
will read the message of President
Roosevelt than read the message of
any of his predecessors. He ia an
Interesting personality and possesses
an Interesting way of stating things
He also has more to say and says It
in fewer words than many others who
have occupied the same position. It
is true that the last message Is long,
even when compared with the mes
sages of other presidents, but Roose
velt had many important matters t.'.
present. Of course all messages of all
presidents are good. The same Is tru
of the last one. If we were asked to
characterize the message In just
sentence we should say that the "Pres
ident has stood h'ls ground." The rail
road rate question Is of uppermost
Importance. On that proposition he has
not given up to his Republican op
ponents In any degree. If the power
ful Republican senators hoped that
the president could be led into a com
promise on this proposition all hope
must have departed when they heard
his message. He Is determined to have
legislation and to have It along the
lines that he has suggested. In
the last session of the House of
Representatives passed a bill satis
factory to the president. It was
promptly rejected by the senate. Since
that time the senate has receive! sev
eral distinct shocks from the country.
Wise senators have been at home dur
ing their vacation and those from the
West In particular have learned that
the people have been thinking of rail-
THE IRISH .STANDARD, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1903
road rate legislation and the rebate
question and they have learned thai
the people are thinking Roosevelt's
way. Roosevelt has not been idle since
congress adjourned. When he learned
the attitude of the senate he took a
train and went West and talked to
the people about the matter. Later on
he took another train and went South
and talked to the Democrats ox the
South until he made friends of them
all. The senate will scarcely dare to
reject a satisfactory rate bill.
The president in his message has
also taken strong ground in the matter
of campaign contributions, prohibiting
corporations from contributing to cam
paign committees. These are the two
strong features of the message. His
attitude upon the Panama Canal, tne
Philippine Tariff and the San Domingo
Treaty are well known, and his mes
sage upon these questions is simply a
reiteration of what he has said befjr-i.
One can not help but come to the
conclusion from reading the message
that the president deserves the repu
tation which he has gained as that
of a man who does things, and who
means to do what he says he will do.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
The following editorial from the
Western Watchman, contains much
food for thought. The failure of rich
young men to accomplish anything in
the world is overshadowed by the fur
ther fact that in most cases they go
to an early grave as the result of fast
living. There is considerable mystery
surrounding the death of the late
Marshall Field, Jr., and the reference
to him may be an error.
The only son of Marshall Field died
of a self-inflicted wound last Monday.
One of the Mackey boys was killed a
short time ago in an automobile acci
dent. A son of Ulclinrd Croker was
found dead out West. One of Eu
gene Kelly's sons lost his life a few
years ago, being drowned while ford
ing a stream. The two sons of Pull
man are dead or in a sanitarium. We
could run up the list to hundreds. In
this city all the young men of the old
families died young, and most of them
by violent deaths The rich brewers
of this city have only girls to leave
their vast fortunes to. The sons on
whom they depended to inherit and
carry on the business are all dead, and
in nearly every case by anticipating the
stroke of the fell destroyer. The ends
of these young men are mostly shroud
ed in suspicious mystery.
Why are the young scions of our
rich families, going so fast to the
grave and the devil? The answer is
very simple they are not brought up
right. They are taught no moral re
straint. They have no religion. If
they ever had, it was driven out of
them by the example of their parents
and of early immoral companions. Rich
fathers and mothers will mix with the
Four Hundred, and their children must
go with the children of the Four Hun
dred, even should that mean to go to
perdition. That is the simple explana
tion in a nut-shell.
Rich young men need religion and
its restraining influence more than poor
young men. They have more and
stronger temptations, and the conse
quences of youthful wrong-doing are
not so disastrous for them. Moral
lapses they need not care about, as
gilded youth Is supposed to be above
the ordinary laws of morality. But
if religion is powerless to assert its
claims nature will have her revenge.
The young men who have brought sor
row and shame to the homes of the
multi-millionaires of the land In the
past quarter of a century have been
physical as well as moral wrecks and
It was because they were physical
wrecks that they came to their un
timely ends. It Is terrible to behold
these young men in the thirties show
ing all the signs of debauched senility
stomachs gone kidneys gone hearts
gone, and trembling on the verge of
drunkards' graves. They were not al
ways so. They Inherited strong con
stitutions from their frugal fathers
and mothers. But they joined the club
and had a night key to their rooms.
They had plenty of money to purchase
forbidden pleasure, and none to say to
them, nay they contracted extrava
gant and destructive habits, and In the
hey-day of young manhood they be
came rakes.
Rich fathers and mothers in this
country should learn from their broth
ers and sisters across the water. There
are no children so carefully brought up
or more closely watched than the sons
of the European nobility. They do not
always turn out well, but certainly they
are not all profligates. Very many of
the best men In every walk of life In
Europe are sons of the nobility. With
us there Is scarcely a half dozen men
of any honorable prominence In so
ciety or business whose fathers were
even wealthy. It is become an aphor
ism among thinking men that to leave
a young man a fortune Is surely to
consign him to an early and dishonor
able grave.
As we are most Interested in the
fate of our rich Catholic boys, we
would ask what becomes of the prom
ising crop of young men, sons of our
best Catholic families, whom our Cath
olic Colleges turn out every year? You
hear from them for a while and then
they disappear, as If the earth swal
lowed them up and you never hear
from them again, until the papers are
called on some fine morning to ex
plain away a suspicious case of sui
cide or a death surrounded by shame
ful circumstances. These Catholic
young men began their downward ca
reer by neglecting Mass and the sacra
ments. A hopeful and Indulgent fath
er or mother sees no danger In this
neglect of religion. It is only a case
of sowing wild oats. The boys will
get sense when' they get older. But
they do not get older. The pace they
start out in kills them early.
We \yould tell our rich Catholics to
see to it, as their equals in Europe do,
that their boys do not lay away their
religious practices, when they lay away
their books. See that they grow up
in close touch with their priests. The
priest is the only reliable and safe
guardian of the child of opulence. All
those of that class that have been
saved owe their salvation to the friend
ly and fatherly interest of a priest. He
had influence over them in their
youth he can influence them in their
after-scholastic years. He has the mind
that masters and compels obedience
and it is only mind that makes men.
What the world needs more than any
thing else today is the priest in the
home and the priest in society.
BALFOUR RESIGNS.
At last after several months of pro
crastination the Balfour ministry has
resigned, and King Edward has sum
moned Sir Henry Campbell-Banner
man to form a new ministry. The sit
uation is Interesting to Irishmen io*
the reason that the change Is bound
to have a great effect upon the Imme
diate future of the Irish question. The
situation is further interesting because
of the conditions existing between the
parties at the present timo. Unlike
our own country which is governoi by
a written constitution the English
government is governed by an unwrit
ten constitution. Both countries are
governed by parties. Our own holds
elections at stated times, both the
time and the method of holding elec
tions being prescribed by written law.
In England a party governs only so
long as that party enjoys the confi
dence of the majority of the voters of
the country. A parliament dies ev
ery seven years by time limitation,
but parliaments are more often dis
solved by a change of public opinion
than by lapse of time. The present
parliament has but a short time to
run until it would terminate by time
limitation. As a usual thing when min
istries resign parliament is at once
dissolved and an appeal to the coun
try made, or rather ministries do not
resign until the sense of the country
has been taken. When a ministry
meets with a reversal on some test
vote taken in the House of Commons
a ministry either resigns and allows
the opposition party to form the min
istry or it dissolves parliament and ap
peals to the country to be sustained.
Neither of these conditions have hap
pened at the present time. Balfour
was not defeated on a test vote. At
the time of his resignation the parlia
ment was not in session but the Union
ists had been meeting with so many
reverses in the bye-elections and they
were so thoroughly disunited upon im
portant questions that it was only a
matter of time when the ministry
would meet with either an adverse
vote in the Commons or by lapse of
time the parliament would be dis
solved and a general election would
become necessary.
Bye-electlons have shown such re
markable gains for the Liberals that
it Is conceded on all hands that a gen
eral election will give the Liberals a
majority. Balfour saw fit to resign
before either event took place,' mak
ing it seemingly incumbent upon the
Liberals to form a ministry at a time
when a majority of the members of
the Commons belong to the opposition
party.
It has been stated by Liberal lead
ers from time to time that if Balfour
should resign without dissolving par
liament and before a general election
that the Liberal leaders would not un
dertake the formation of a ministry
for that position would leave-them open
to a vote of censure at any time be
cause a majority of the present par
liament are anti-Liberals. The sum
moning of Sir Henry Campbell-Ban
nerman by the King and the absence
of any announcement to the contrary
makes it probable that Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman has decided to
form a ministry notwithstanding the
fact that the Unionists have a major
ity. Parliament Is not now in session
and, therefore, no adverse vote can
be had at the present time. Should the
Liberals form a government and should
parliament be called in session prior
to Its dissolution and should a vote
of censure be taken the Liberals would
have nothing left to do except to dis
solve parliament and appeal to the
country. This would only amount to
bringing on the election a little sooner
than it would otherwise take place.
It is particularly encouraging to
friends of Ireland to note that the King
has summoned Sir Henry Campbell
Bannerman to form the new Liberal
ministry. His position toward Ireland
Is distinctly more friendly than that
of any other Liberal leader except John
Morley. The complete disregard of
Lord Rosebery by the King and the
Liberal leaders is also encouraging.
Rosebery with all his great capacity
and culture, has, nevertheless, shown
himself to be a weak and vacillating
leader. His short leadership ot the
Liberal Party after Gladstone was
forced by age to quit the leadership
was most disastrous to the party. Rose
bery is not friendly to Ireland or its
people. He is an Imperialist of the
most pronounced type. His concep
tion of Ireland and the colonies Is
that they exist for the glorification of
England. While Campbell-Banner
man's attitude toward the Irish Is
more friendly, yet It can not be said
with certainty what that attitude will
be when he assumes responsibility.
Last week at Stirling in Scotland he
made a notable speech in which he out
lined his attitude toward Home Rule
for Ireland. He declared that the only
way to help the difficulties of the Irish
government and to make Ireland a
source of strength instead of weakness
tp the Empire was to give to the Irish
people the management of their own
domestic affairs. He said that he be
lieved that the Unionists would find
at the coming election that the "Irish
bugbear" of Home Rule is out of date
and. that the English voters would no
longer be scared by the shadow of
Home Rule.
It Is Interesting to recall In this con
nection that on last Wednesday the
Irish Nationalists held a national con
vention in the Mansion House, In Dub
lin, presided over by John Redmond,
the leader of the Irish Parliamentary
Party. At that time Mr. Redmond
stated that nothing but Home Rule
would satisfy the demands of the Irish
Party and a resolution was adopted
unanimously which concluded with the
following words: "We solemnly assert
that no new system of government in
Ireland will be accepted as satisfac
tory except a legislative assembly free
ly elected and representative of the
people with power to make laws for
Ireland, and an executive government
responsible to that assembly and this
convention declares that the Irish Na
tional Party can' not enter into an
alliance with or give permanent sup
port to any English party or govern
ment which does not make the ques
tion of granting such an assembly and
executive to Ireland the cardinal point
of its program." It may be that the
Liberal Party, even should It adopt the
Irish demands in full, would not be
able to force such a policy through
the House of Lords. But such a sit
uation would only be a partial de
feat for a renewed application to the
country and an endorsement from the
country of such a policy would compel
the Lords to accept the bill. If ihe
new Liberal ministry, however, at
tempts evasion on the Irish question,
should its leaders entrusted with
power, refuse or neglect to carry out
their promises the life of the Liberal
ministry will be short indeed. In such
a case theyf would be harassed from
the very commencement by upwards of
eighty Irish Nationalists who are ad
epts in obstruction. Sir Henry Camp
bell-Bannerman would in that case find
his position a great deal harder than
that in which Balfour has been placed
for the last two years. There is but
one way to settle the Irish question
and that is to settle it right. Admit
tedly the present system of* govern
ment is a failure. It will not do to
say that the failure is due to the Irish
themselves. It is beyond controversy
that the present system of govern
ment is distasteful to the Irish nay,
more, the great majority of the peo
ple are in open revolt against it. It
would seem to Americans that it
would be a wise piece of statesman
ship on the part of the British govern
ment to end this struggle of centuries
and to make of Ireland a 'friend for
England Instead of an enemy. In the
dark days of the Boer War when re
ports were coming from South Africa
relating the destruction of whole arm
ies the Irish representatives in parlia
ment, upon one of such announce
ments being made in the House of
Commons, rose to their feet in a body
and shouted for the Boers. In the
days of her strength England might
with temporary safety to herself have
disregarded such a scene and met it
with a new act of coercion and jail
sentence, for treason but the day may
soon come, if indeed it is not already
present when England needs the aid of
the Irish people.
We beleve that a majority of the
English people themselves are now of
the opinion that It Is not possible to
make Ireland a loyal member of the
Empire by the policy which has been
pursued in the past. The Irish will
not be conquered they may be exter
minated. One of two things remains
for England in her treatment of Ire
land either grant the demands of the
Irish people for Home Rule, such
Home Rule as Canada enjoys today,
or continue its present course until
every Irishman has been driven from
Ireland. The first course Is one of
safety and honor. The second course
is one of danger and of untold dis
grace to a so-called great civilised na
tion. The first course is safe and
honorable because the Irish people
would then have no reason to be oth
erwise than loyal to the Empire. It
would be honorable to England be
cause the Irish people have at all
times shown themselves to be worthy
foes and true friends. The last course
Is dangerous as Is shown at the time
of the Boer War. Had the Boers been
a little more powerful England would
have needed the aid of every Irishman
In her armies to suppress them. It
is a dishonorable course because the
demands of the Irish people are not
unreasonable and comprise no more
than what England fteely grants to
other peoples situated in like condi
tion. Ireland asks no more than Eng
land a long time ago granted to Can
ada and Australia.
We hope that Sir Henry Campbell
Bannerman may be the English states
man to solve this question and to
bring peace and prosperity to a peo
ple who have surely suffered long
enough. If he should accomplish this
task he will have done more for the
British Empire than any Prime Minis
ter of our day.
The Dollar Sign.
History has been guilty of many
misnomers, says the Holy Cross Pur­
p^iP!PniPii!HiilPiP9P
ple. And so, too, many of the ar
bitrary signs that usage has given us,
when closely Inspected, are found to
contain an element of the incongruous.
Few, at least, are as fittingly employed
as the dollar sign.
We find stamped on Spanish coins
two pillars, and around each twines a
slender vine. These are the Pillars of
Hercules. This emblem has been
chosen by the Spaniards becauso the
Strait of Gibralter was known to the
ancients as the Pillars of Hercules.
Now in our familiar dollar sign the
two perpendicular strokes are consid
ered to be degenerations—easily ex
plained by hurry and convenience—of
the two pillars on the Spanish co'i,
while the sigmoidal curve Intersecting
these lines is all that remains of fhe
vignette that adorned the original pi
lars. And so it comes that the two
great symbols of power, one of the
ancients and the other of the moderns,
are united in the dollar sign. I wonder
that the evolutionists do not use this
fact to draw the conclusion—it is quite
as logical as some they arrive at—that
there must be method in the chaos of
chance method that could shuffle all
the possibilities and turn up at ran
dom as apt a sign for the mighty dol
lar as the Pillars of Hercules.
