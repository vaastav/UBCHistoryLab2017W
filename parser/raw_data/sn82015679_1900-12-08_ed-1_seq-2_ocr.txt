Marion Stewart, a prominent druggist, shot
Dennis Sullivan, seventy-one years old,
in the left shoulder, and owing to the age
of the man, the wound may prove fatal,
though the actual injury seems to be com
paratively slight. Sullivan Is a well-known
character here. He was drunk in the resi
dence part of tho city and says he ap
proached Stewart to inquire the time. Ow
ing to an accident the street lights were
out and seeing two other suspicious men
near and notlr.s the actions of Sullivan,
who was not recognized, Mr. Stewart be
lieved it was a holdup, and shot the old
man.
Mr. Stewart bad considerable money on
his person, as he was going home from the
store. The hootin? occurred at Liberty
and Howard streets near Stewart's home.
He very much regrets the occurrence, con
vinced now that Sullivan had no bad
motives, though ho warned him several
times to keep back.

Accused of Fraud John Hays
Hammond's Report.
LONDON, Dec. 7. A meeting of people
Interested in Stratton's Independence mine
to-day attracted a large attendance of
shareholders, who passed a vote of no con
fidence In the board of directors after one
of the stormiest city meetings on record.
The whole meeting was disorderly- The
directors were hissed and hooted, and the
words "scandalous" and "disgraceful" and
accusations of fraud were hurled broad
cast. The Earl of Chesterfield, who pre
sided, read a cablegram from John Hays
Hammond, tho American engineer, asking
him to announce to the meeting that Mr.
Hammond's connection with the mine dated
from after the shortage of ore reserves was
discovered. His lordship proceeded to say
that a cable message received from State
Geologist Ricard, of Colorado, dated Oct.
20, conveyed the first intimation of serious
misrepresentation on the part of the old
management in regard to the value of ores.
This was not published because it was
vague and incomplete, but, had the direc
tors had any warning of the discrepancy of
112,000,000, as shown In the subsequent re
port of Mr. Hammond, dated Nov. 24, they
would certainly have made Mr. Rlcard's
statement public Mr. Ricard made a per
sonal explanation at the meeting, and a
long and animated discussion, marked by
wild disorder and much execration, fol
lowed. Chaos reigned, amidst which the
mass of shareholders left. Lord Chester
field then declared the report carried,
though the meeting had previously voted to
postpone its consideration for two months.

At the afternoon session." Captain Waters

"What prevented you, after you got tho
razor, from going to the door and scream
ing for help?" was asked of Miss Morri
son. "She held my hair and arm."
Later witness said she had seen some

VALUED AT $52,500,000
ESTATE OF THE LATE CORNELIUS
VANDCROILT APPRAISED.
Young Alfred Will Have $44,000,000,
bnt Has Agreed to Give Ills
Brother $0,000,000.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.-The World will
say to-morrow that, after a long delay, the
heirs of the late Cornelius Vanderbllt have
agreed to the appraisement of the estate
as made by G. B. Hasbrouck, representing
the state controller. This appraisement Is
$52,500,000 for the real estate. The figures
insisted on by the heirs were $19,826,850.96,
but Mr. Hasbrouck stood firm and has at
last gained his point. In the meantime
there was great speculation as to' what the
residuary estate would be. According to
the terms of the will, all that remained
after the various bequests had been di
vided was to go to Alfred Vanderbllt.
Young Vanderbllt, now the head of the
great house, had not been able to tell just
how much he was worth. The estimate
fixed by Senator Depew just after the will
was filed for probate was that the estate
of his old assistant would, be valued at
$70.000.000. This would have given to the
residuary legatee $34,500,000. The estimate
of Senator Depew was not very far off, al
though It was not generally accepted at the
time. The general opinion was . Cornelius
Vanderbllt was worth anywhere from $100,
000,000 to $125,000,000.
Under agreement decided upon yesterday
Alfred will get $2.500,000 more than Senator
Depew gave him, and his entire fortune
will amount to J,000,000. But out of this
residuary estate Alfred has agreed to give
to Cornelius $6,000.000 in order to "prevent a
lawsuit threatened because the eldest
brother was cut off with only $1,500,000. The
total amount coming to Cornelius, inclusive
of the portion from the residuary estate,
will reach $7,500.000.
The transfer tax on the Vanderbllt estate
will reach $520,000. Already the executors
have paid into the State the sum of $373,500,
which was paid early to get advantage of a
reduction of 5 per cent. Controller Coler
will get a snug sum from the Vanderbllt
estate. His fee will amount to $32,000. ..
