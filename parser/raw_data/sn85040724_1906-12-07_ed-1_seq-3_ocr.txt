THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE
ROOSEVELT RECOMMENDS NEW
LEGISLATION TO CON
GRESS.
REVISE THE JUDICIARY.
Wants Government to Have Right to Ap
peal on Questions of Laws—ln
heritance and Income Tax.
WASHINGTON, I>. Inc. 4.—President
Theodore Roosevelt today sent his annual
message to the Senate and the House of
Representatives. The President urges the
amendment of laws so as to effectually deal
with corporations and the passage of in
heritance and income tax measures. He
doe- not mention the tariff except to urge
free trade with the Philippines.
After complimenting ougress upon ibe
admirable legislation of the last session the
President says tills country is enjoying
prosperity which only can be marred by
reckless speculation and disregard of legit
imate business methods. He urges a law
prohibiting corporations from contributing
to campaign funds, but says individuals
should be alio ved to contribute what they
please.
Appeal in Criminal Cases.
The President recommends the passage of
a law giving the government the right to
appeal in criminal eases on questions of
law; it of course being understood that it Is
not proposed that any verdict for the de
fendant on the merits should be set aside.
A failure to pass such a bill would seriously
hamper the government iu its efforts to ob
tain Justice in trust prosecutions. It Is ab
surd to permit a single Judge, against wbat
may be the Judgment of the immense ma
jority of bis colleagues on the bench, to de
clare u law unconstitutional and then deny
to the government tin* right to have the
supreme court definitely decide the ques
tion. The proposed law is important at this
time as the government has definitely begun
a policy of resorting to the criminal law In
those trust and interstate cases where such
a course offers a reasonable chance of suc
cess.
Setting Aside Judgments.
In connection with this matter the Presi
dent calls attention to the unsatisfactory
state of onr criminal law, resulting in a
large part from the habit of setting aside
the Judgments of inferior courts on techni
calities absolutely unconnected with the
merits of the case, and where there is no
attempt to show that there has been any
failure of substantial Justice. The President
asks for a law providing that no Judgment
shall be set aside or new trial granted in
any ease, civil or criminal, on the ground of
misdirection of the Jury or the improper ad
mission or rejection of evidence, or for error
as to any matter of pleading or procedure
unless, In the opinion of the court to which
tiie application Is made, after an examina
tion of the entire case, it shall affirmatively
appear that the error complained of has re
sulted iu u miscarriage of justiee.
Injunctions Are Necessary.
The President believes it would lie wrong
and probably invalid to abolish the power
of Injunction. Hut he thinks that so far
as is possible some law should be passed
which would prohibit the abuse of the
power. He believes the power of injunc
tion is necessary, and that no judge should
hesitate to use such power in dealing with
disorder. He does not think it proper to
forbid laboring men to strive for their own
betterment in lawful and peaceful ways,
nor does he approve of using the injunc
tions! power to aid some big corporation
In carrying out schemes for Its own ag
grandizement, but he believes judges should
wield their power to prohibit any resort
to violence or Intimidation, especially by
conspiracy, no matter what their opinion
may be of the rights of the original quar
rel.
"The best judges,” says the President,
“have ever been foremost to disclaim any
immunity from criticism.” Mr. Roosevelt
says that the American peopie will not
subscribe to the doctrine that any public
servant Is to lie above criticism. Just and
temperate criticism when necessary sup
plies a safeguard. The President scores
unworthy agitators as a menace to the
republic.

Lynching a Growing Danger.
In connection with the delays of the law
the President calls the attention of Con
gress to the prevalence of lynching and
mob violence. He says that the greatest
existing cause of lynching, especially of
black men. Is the hideous crime of rape—
“the most abominable in all the category
of crimes, even worse than murder." He
says that when mobs begin to lynch for
rape they speedily extend the sphere of
their operations and lynch for many other
kinds of crime, so that two-thirds of the
lynchlngs are not for rape at all; while a
considerable portion of the individuals
lynched are innocent of all crime. There
is but one safe rule In dealing with the
black men as ivith white men; it Is the
same rule that must be applied in dealing
with the rich and poor men; that is to
treat each man, whatever his color, his
creed, or his social position, with even
handed justice on his real worth as a
man. There Is no question of “social equal
ity" or “negro domination” involved; only
the question of punishing bad men and
protecting the good. The President says
that every colored man should realize that
his worst enemy is the negro criminal and
should help the officers of the law in pun
ishing the guilty.
“Moreover, in my judgment,” says the
President; "the crime of rape should al
ways bo punished with death, as in the
case with murder; assault with Intent to
commit rape should be made a capital
crime, at least at the discretion of the
court; and provision should be made by
which punishment may follow immediately
upon the heels of the offense; while the
trial should be so conducted that the vic
tim need not be wantonly shamed while
giving testimony, and that the least pos
sible publicity shall bo given to the ue
talls.”
The President points out the short-sight
ed policy of one class trying to prevent
the education of another. lie says that
tue poorer classes need educai-on most
and urges the whites not to allow the ne
groes, as a mass, to grow up in ignorance.
Most of the crimes which occasion lynch
ings are committed by people who have
no education. He says the best type of
education for the negro is as conferred by
such schools as Hampton and Tuskegee,
where the students are trained indus
trially.
“individuals who indulge in inflammatory
and Incendiary speeches and writings which
tend to arouse mobs and bring about
lynchlngs, not only thus excite the mob,
but also tend by suggestion to greatly In
crease the likelihood of a repetition of the
very crime against which they are in
veighing,” says the President.
Capital and Labor.
The greatest danger, the President savs,
in dealing with capital and labor, is the
harm done by preachers of mere discontent
who seek to incite a violent class hatred
against all men of wealth. The sinister
demagogues and foolish visionaries who
are always eager to undertake a campaign
of destruction, sometimes seek to as
sociate themselves with those working for
a genuine reform and masquerade as such
reformers. They are the worst enemies of
the cause they profess to advocate, just as
the purveyors of sensational slander in
newspaper or magazine are the worst ene
mies of all men who are engaged in an
honest effort to better what is bad in our
social and governmental conditions. Such
preaching will undo the good the honest
reformer has achieved. The honest man.
whether rich or poor, who earns his own
living has as much to fear from the dema
gogue, promising much aud doing little, or
else performing nothing hut evil, as from
the erafty corruptionist. There are rich
reactionaries who regard the public servant
who prosecutes them when they violate the
law. or who seeks to make them bear their
proper share of the public burdens, as be
ing even more objectionable than the violent
agitator who hounds on the mob to plun
der the rich. There is nothing to choose
between such- a reactionist and such an
agitator.
Eight-Uour Law.
The President calls for a law limiting the
hours of labor for railroad employes. He
believes la an eight-hour day. lie points
out. however, that in some industries and
localities such a restriction is impractical.
He says an eight-hour day would be absurd
on the Isthmus of Panama, just as absurd
as to, bother as to whether the necessary
work is done by alien black or alien yellow
men. The eight-hour day law is now rigidly
enforced by the goveriaueut. He advocates
half-holidays during the sr.mtne' for govern
ment employes and urges frequent holidays
for those who labor with their hands as
well as for mental workers.
Labor of Women and Children.
The President advocates a drastic child
labor law for the District of Columbia and
the territories. He urges investigation of
child and woman labor in all parts of ttm
country, tin* publications of the findings of
which would tend to the passage by the
many states of laws which would bett-r
conditions. “The horrors incident to th
employment of young children in factories,
or at work anywhere, are a idol on our
civilization,” says the President.
Employers’ Liability.
| The employers' liability bill passed 1 y the
| last Congress Is praised by lue President,
but he says it did not go tar enough. The
i 'otupeiisutioii for accidents or deaths due in
any line or industry to the actual condition
under which that industry is carried on.
should be paid by that portion of the com
munity for the benefit of which the in
dustry is carried on—that Is by those who
profit by the industry, if the entire risk Is
placed on the employer he will promptly
and properly add it to the legitimate cost
of production and assess It proportionately
upon the consumers of his commodity. The
law should place the eutire risk upon the
employer. The President does not think the
I federal or state laws are suttleiemiy
| thorough-going.
Investigation of Disputes Between Cap
ital and Labor.
i The President urges a law providing for
j the machinery for what may he called the
| compulsory investigation of controversies
j between employers and employes when they
| arise. The President thinks it unjust to al
-1 low either employers or employes to be left
} completely at the mercy of the stronger
I party to the dispute. .Strikes which affect
! the public welfare and comfort should not
jbe allowed to continue, lie urges cautious
| legislation, but thinks the step proposed
! can be safely taken as it would not bind
j 'be parties in legal fashion but would give a
! chance for public opinion to crystallze and
j thus exert its full force for the right.
Withdrawal of Coal Lands.
j The President says It is not wise for the
j government to alienate its remaining coal
j lands, iic suggests legislation which would
> provide for the withdrawal of these lands
j troni sale or entry, save in certain special
! circumstances. He thinks the government
could permit them to be worked on a roy
j ally and control them so that excessive
( prices could not be charged consumers. The
control of common earners so that they
would not favor one competitor at the ex
pense of another must also be provided for
in the bill.
Corporations.
The corporation laws —railroad rate law,
the pure food law and the packing house
regulations—should not be touched this ses
sion, according to the President. They
should he given an opportunity to show
their merits and shortcomings. He suggests,
however, that a law be passed providing for
the putting of a date on the label of pack
ing house products and the charging of the
cost of inspection to the packers.
All the corporation laws have justified
their enactment. The President points out
that in the face of predictions that the in
terstate commerce law would ruin the rail
roads, the last five months showed Increased
earnings and unusual dividends and that
the mere taking effect of the law hud pro
duced an unprecedented number of volun
tary reductions in freight and fare rates.
The President favors the passage In the
near future of legislation giving the na
tional government control of corporations
doing interstate business. A national li
cense law would prevent the evils of over
capitalization and put a stop to the se
curing of inordinate profits by favored in
dividuals at the expense whether of the
general public, the stockholders or the
wage workers. He does wish so much to
prevent consolidation but to supervise and
control so that no harm Is done to the
people. The best way to avert the very
undesirable move for government owner
ship of railroads is to secure by the gov
ernment on behalf of the people as a whole
such adequate control and regulation of
the great interstate common carriers as
will do away with the evils which give
rise to the agitation against them. The
effort to prohibit all combination, good or
bad, is noxious where It is not effective.
Combinations of capital like combinations
of labor, is a necessary element of our
present Industrial svstem. What Is need
ed Is control of the combinations. It is un
fortunate that our present laws should
forbid all combinations, instead of sharply
discriminating between the good and bad.
Often railroads would like to combine for
the purpose of preventing a big shipper
(like the Standard Oil company) from
maintaining improper advantage at the ex
pense of small shippers and the gen
eral public. Such combination should be
favored not prohibited. It is a public evil
to have a law on the statute books Incapa
ble of full enforcement. The President
suggests that after careful Investigation
that Congress should amend the law so as
to obviate the evils disclosed.
Inheritance and Income Tax.
A graduated inheritance and income tax
is recommended. The President says a man
of groat wealth owes a peculiar obligation
to the state, because he derives special ad
vantages from the mere existence of gov
ernment and should pay for the protection
he receives. He advocates distributing the
burden of taxation more equally than it is
at present. Treat the rich and poor on a
basis of equality. The President wishes to
encourage thrift and urges that the Income
tax be made very small on moderate
amounts of property left and make It much
heavier when the gift goes to some remote
of kin. He would increase the burden on
the Inheritance of those swollen fortunes
which are of no benefit to this country to
perpetuate. He urges gradual progress to
ward an inheritance tax.
The President wants an income tax and
says every effort should be made to enact
one without amending the constitution, but
if this fails he favors a constitutional
amendment.
Technical and Industrial Training.
The establishment of technical and in
dustrial schools to encourage the fullest de
velopment of scholars in both commercial
and industrial training is urged for the Ltis
trlct of Columbia. The President wants the
District to be a model for the states to fol
low. He strenuously combats the training of
boys and girls in purely literary accomplish
ments and urges teaching of trades in the
public schools.
Agriculture.
The President makes a pica for the farm
er, whose welfare he says is vital to the
whole country. He urges provision for the
education of the farmer. He tells of the
good work of the agricultural department
and commends the formation of granges in
many parts of the country.
Irrigation and Forest Preservation.
No government policy for the betterment
of our internal conditions has been more
fruitful of good than the development of
the national policy of irrigation and forest
preservation. He urges that the forests of
the White Mountains and Southern Appala
chian regions be preserved.
Memorial at Arlington.
He calls attention of Congress to the re
quest for an appropriation for a memorial
Amphitheater at Arlington for the proper
observance of Memorial day favored bv the
G. A. It.
Marriage and Divorce.
The President thinks the whole question
of marriage and divorce should be regulated
by the national government. Such a condi
tion would make it possible to deal with
polygamy. He points out that in some
regions the death rate greatly exceeds the
birth rate and says that willful sterility is a
sin for which there is no atonement and
means the nation's death. lit says no man
or woman can shirk the primary duties of
life and retain his or her selfrespect. The
President advocates a constitutional amend
ment giving the federal government control
of marriage and divorce.
American Shipping.
A law for the development of American
shipping Is needed. He admits that the law
would benefit primarily our seaboard states,
but he says that what benefits part of our
people in the end benefits ali. He says that
in case it is impractical to encourage ship
ping generally, then at least provision
should be made for better communication
with South America. He says it is discred
itable to us that our business people, for
lack of lines of steamers to South America,
should be at a disadvantage compared with
Europe in dealing with our great sister con
tinent.
• Currency Reform.
The President points out that the cur
rency laws are defective. He calls for legis
lation and submits the plan of the secretary
of the treasury as a possible solution. Na
tional banks should be permitted to issue a
specified proportion of their capital in notes
of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so
high a rate as to drive the notes back when
not wanted in legitimate trade. The plan
would not permit the banks to issue cur
rency at a profit, but to meet the emergency
presented by times of stringency. Funds
derived from custom duties should be per
mitted to be treated by the secretary of the
treasury as he treats funds obtained under
internal revenue laws. There should be a
considerable increase in bills of small de
nominations. Permission should be given
banks, if necessary under settled conditions,
to retire their circulation to a larger amount
than 53,000,000 a mouth.
Philippine Tariff.
The President hopes for a reduction of
the Philippine tariff or else absolute free
trade. He secs no possible harm to Ameri
can Industry. In only two of the islands—
Leyte and Samar—is our authority resisted
and there by only wild mountain tribes
under superstitious leadership of fanatics.
We are constantly increasing the measure
of liberty In the islands.
He says the nation should aid the Philip
pines. Porto Rico and Hawaii. He urges
citizenship for the people of Porto Rico and
improvements for that island. He advo
cates a complete reorganization of the gov
ernment of Alaska.
international Morality.
We must treat ail nations fairly, says
the President, and must treat with Jus
! t'ce and good will ail Immigrants wtift
1 conic here under the law. He rebukes
those communities which have shown hos
tility to the Japanese. He points out
that Japanese civilization is older than
the nations of northern K a rope Iruui
iileh we have ehiehy sprung, lie points
out the marvelous development of Japan
iin every way. lie calls attention to the
j fact that Japan sent *IOO.OOO to San Frau
j cisco at the time of the earthquake. In
the face of all this, the President says,
i San Francisco has shut the Japanese out
iof the schools. He says it is a wicked
| absurdity to shut out the Japanese from
j our educational institutions. We have as
I much to learn from Japan as Japan has
| from us. Throughout Japan Americans
I are well treated and wo should show a like
I courtesy to the Mikado’s people.
I We cannot hope for great commercial
j development in Asia if we do not extend to
other nations the same measure of justiee
j and good treatment we expect to receive.
I He recommends that Congress pass an act
! specifically providing for the uaturaliza
i tion of Japanese who come here intending
Ito become American citizens. One of the
j greatest embarrassments attending the
i performance of our Internationa I obliga
j tions is the fact that the statutes of the
i United States fail to give the national gov-
I eminent sufficiently ample power through
United States courts and the army and
navy to protect aliens in the rights se
cured to them under solemn treaties which
are laws of the land. Ho asks for a law
giving the President the right to enforce
the rights of aliens under treaties. The
mob of one city may at any time commit
acts against foreigners which may plunge
tiie whole country into war and the city,
powerless itself to make defense, would
have to have*the national government’s
| aid. It is wrong that the government must
defend a locality from war but can do
nothing to prevent the commission of a
hostile act.
Cuba.
The President explained his action in
interfering in Cuba. He said the Cuban
government had failed and It was neces
sary for the United States to act in order
to prevent some foreign power from step
ping in, under guise of protecting Its sub
jects. When the elections are held iu
Cuba and a go* eminent restored the Amer
ican troops and governor general will be
withdrawn. The United States wishes
nothing from Cuba except that it prosper
morally and materially. If the insurrec
tion habit becomes confirmed it will be
necessary for the United States to stop
in and terminate Cuba’s independence.
America Is Cuba’s sponsor and must see
that life and property are protected on the
island.
The Rio Conference.
The Rio conference and Secretary Root’s
visit to South America dispelled the un
founded impression that the United States
is hostile to the Soutli American republics.
He laid the foundation for trade relations
between the United States and the re
publics. He also told of the plan to sub
mit to the Hague all questions of collec
tion of foreign debts from the American
republics.
Central America.
The President told of how the United
States acting with Mexico ended the war
between Salvador, Guatemala, and Hon
duras. The President thinks that the time
has come when the United States acting
with other American nations can preserve
peace among the people of the Western
Hemisphere.
Panama Trip.
The President promises to report in the
near future on his Panama trip.
The Algeciras Convention.
The signing of the Algeciras convention
insured for us commercial rights in Morocco
and does not entail a single obligation.
The Senate is asked to ratify the treaty.
Fur Seals.
The destruction of the Pribilof Islands
fur seals by pelagic sealing still continues
and the seals are fast becoming extinct.
The President asks for swift action. The
stealing Is accompanied by fearful cruelty.
Second Hague Conference.
The President reports progress in arrang
ing for the second Hague conference. Mo
date has as yet been fixed.
Peace and Righteousness.
We should do all in our power to pre
serve peace, but also we should be pre
pared for war, says the President. A just
war is better than peace obtained by ac
quiescence iu w rong or injustice. The
chance for the settlement of disputes peace
fully, by arbitration, now depends mainly
upon the possession by the nations that
mean to do right of sufficient armed
strength to make their purpose effective.
The Army and Navy.
The United States navy is the surest
guarantee of peace which this country pos
sesses. The President does not ask that the
navy be increased but asks that it be main
tained at its present strength. To stop
building ships for one year means that for
that year the navy goes back instead of for
ward. Each year one first-class battleship,
equal to any being built by other nations,
should be built. Of course from time to
time cruisers and other warships must be
built. As our ships are constantly wearing
out this programme wotild result in keeping
the navy at its present strength.
The President urges that the best men be
secured for both the army and navy by of
fering all possible encouragement to the
enlisted men in pay and otherwise. He de
sires that the younger men be advanced
more rapidly as too often under our present
system, men are not promoted to high posi
tions until their advanced age makes them
of little use.
The President points out that both the
army and navy illustrated Its readiness and
efficiency by its rapidity in dealing with the
recent crises in Cuba when the mobilization
and dispatch of troops over the sea was the
quickest on record. It was a flue illustra
tion of the value of the general staff.
The President closes his message by urg
ing the establishment of shooting galleries
in all the public schools where frequent rifle
practice can be held. The little republic of
Switzerland offers us an excellent example
in all matters connected with the building
up of an efficient citizen soldiery, says the
President.
Appended to the message is the address
of Secretary of State Root as honorary
president of the third conference of Amerl- :
can republics at Rio de Janeiro, July 31,
1906.
RIVER TO LIGHT PARIS.
$4,000,000 to Be Saved by Employing
Long Distance Water Power.
A colossal scheme of power develop
ment is said to be on the point of realiza
tion in France. It is proposed to utilize
the river Rhone for the development of
electricity for the city of Paris. Light,
heat and motive power are promised at
the cheapest rate in the world.
The originator of the idea is an en
gineer named Mahl. His plans have the
indorsement of the National School of
Highways and Bridges, and of the So
ciety of Electrotechuicians. The enter
prise is so assured that contracts for the
delivery of current iu Paris at an early
day are already being negotiated.
The water is to be drawn from the
Rhone at Grezin not far from the fa
mous Porte du Rhone or Falls of Belle
garde where the river, already of great
volume, draining as it does Lake Ge
neva, plunges for 300 yards or there
abouts through a chasm which it has
scored for itself in the solid rock.
The water diverted through a sluice
way will be impounded to the amount i
of 2,000,000 cubic meters, or about 2,- I
666,000 cubic yards, on the level of Col- i
louges and returned to the river through
a double tunnel of 4500 meters. This I
will furnish a flow, it is calculated, j
equivalent to 100.000 horse-power.
The electric current is to be developed |
by forty-eight dynamos divided into I
groups, each driven by a turbine of 10.- i
000 horse-power. The lines to Paris
will be as direct as possible; the distance
is between 250 and 300 miles, but no
special difficulties are expected. Some
long lines of delivery in America and
one iu Sweden, supplying Stockholm
from a distance of 600 kilometers, or
360 miles, have been studied in the
preparation of the plans, and are quoted
as showing that the enterprise is en
tirely possible.
It is calculated that the delivery of
the net electric power from these works
in Paris as compared with the develop
ment of the same energy on the spot by
coal consumption will effect a net aii- !
nualeco* omy of about 20,000.000 francs,
or $4,000,000.
Voice Travels Far.
Eighteen miles is said to be the long- I
est distance at which a man’s voice has
been heard. This occurred in the Grand j
canyon of Colorado, where one man
shouting the name “Bob” at one end
was plainly heard at the other end,
which is eighteen miles away.
“Bears of Boulevard.”
Parisians, who like to have designat- j
ing epithet for everything and everybody, !
call the actresses who ride in touring j
cars, wrapped up in automobile coats, (
“the little bears of the boulevards.”
ATTITUDE OF THE FARMERS.
By John .11. Stahl.
_3 While not complaining and while freely and
.ffj gladly acknowledging their great prosperity,
hjj due in large measure to the development of
ffjj manufacture, transportation and trade, farm
frl ers nevertheless believe that the margin be-
tween the price paid to them and the price
yL paid by the consumers of their products is
jV altogether too great and that this margin has
—contributed much to aggregations of wealth
that are dangerous; hence farmers would not try to in
crease by large their profits by compelling the consumers
of farm products to pay more, but rather by lessening
the opportunity of an increase by unfair means of the
wealth of those already too rich.
Farmers recognize that the value of their lands and
the profits of their business are largely due to the mar
kets created by manufacturer and the transportation pro
vided b.v railways. But the farmer distinguishes between
the manufacture, transportation and sale of articles and
the work of corporations and individuals that put their
attorneys and willing servants into State Legislatures and
the National Congress, in executive offices and even on
the bench, not for the public good, but to secure advan
tages that are unfair in themselves and in their results
dangerous to the masses. Speaking largely, the remedy
we would propose for economic injustice would not be
of the nature of special laws or efforts in the way of arbi
trary hindrances to honest trade or arbitrary seizure of
the holdings of any class and a distribution to any in
jured class, but rather we would depend on the awaken
ing of such a national conscience and spirit as will com
pel just laws and secure to every class its full rights in
open competition with all.
MEN AND WOMEN BOOMERANG TARGETS.
By Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
_J How idly we use the phrase, “Cast thy bread
fvJ upon the waters; for thou shalt find it after
jit many days.” But no truer words ever were
Inf inspired by the divine sources of all truth.
ill Whether your bread is sweet or sour, whole-
W some or poisonous, it shall return to you
JL “after many days.” Thought is a boomerang.
Jack It sometimes is long in proving itself to be of
this reacting nature; but the greater the delay
the stronger will be its force when the backward swing
begins.
Unless we find something every day to be happy over,
we never shall be able to enjoy fully any blessing which
may come to us. Continuel discontent shapes the mind
for unhappiness, and no amount of good luck can twist
it back into harmonious proportions. The man who never
has learned the lession of contentment and happiness in
some degree in his hard days never will find it In his easy
ones. When he undertakes to enjoy travel, society or
home, he will find the only demon of unrest is with him—
his relentless boomerang.
There is the disloyal thought, which many people, both
men and women, suffer from. They blame fate instead
of their own minds for their bruises. The disloyal friend
or the faithless lover, sets currents in action which in
evitably must bring disaster in time. I do not mean the

When in June, 1777, General Bur
goyne started from Canada with 80,000
splendidly equipped soldiers and the
j- finest train of artil
| lery that had ever
I 1 been seen in Amer-
I raNllai BSR ica, it was confl

army that he would

the continental
k ■ -< But General Phil
i’iiilip scutrYLER. ip Schuyler had
been busy in felling the trees, obstruct
ing the fords and breaking down the
bridges in the country through which
Burgoyne must come. By the time Bur
goyne reached Fort Edward, he was
compelled to forage for food. The New
England militia cut him off from Can
ada.
At the battle of Bennington the
Americans under Stark had defeated
him. Now nothing was left to him hut
hard fighting. The genius of General
Schuyler had hemmed in the British.
Just as victory for the Americans was
in sight General Schuyler was super
seded by General Gates. To Gates went
the credit of the splendid victory of
Saratoga, Oct. 17, 1777.
It might have been expected that
General Schuyler, whose retirement
had been due to a mistake, rather a
blunder, on the part of the authorities
in charge, should feel the personal
chagrin so keenly that he would have

GOOD ONLY TO RUN RACES.
Thoroa(;!>l)red Horse Would Be Val
ueless If There Were No Bettinir.
James Coyle got a party of sporting
men aud race horse owners to guessing
a few nights ago. They were discuss
ing the thoroughbred and Incidentally
politics aud betting. Mr. Coyle advanc
ed some original views as to what gives
the thoroughbred race horse its value.
He set them al! guessing by the state
ment that if betting on racetracks was
suddenly *wohibited the race horse
would have no value whatever.
“You believe that betting has not all
to do with values of the race horse,” he
said. “Why. if the right to bet on a
race was cut off —that is. if there was
no betting allowed —there are horses in
all parts of the country, worth from
$30,000 upward, that would not be
worth 30 cents. You needn’t look so
surprised.” he continued. “What do
the people go to racetracks for? Is it
to see the races? They can’t see any
thing but a finish in most of them.
What crowds the race course at big
events? Do you believe it is all love
for the horses? More than half of
those in attendance do not even see the
finish. They are there to lay down a
bet.
“Now. if they cannot hot will they
attend the races? And if they do not
attend what will become of the race
tracks? If there is no racing what will

ning horse? He cannot ho used for
friend who outgrows the other the lover who finds It
impossible to continue loving. Those sad experiences
sometimes occur with the most loyal! But I refer to
those who repay trust with trickery, confidence with de

are forced to suffer from the same qualities in others.
WOMEN’S EXTRAVAGANCE OFTEN MEN’S FAULT.
By Helen Oldrield.
~" 1 _J Nothing can be more foolish than for a
jftj young couple to start married life with a
jil grand splurge, spending the few hundreds or
jhj so in the bank in unnecessary extravagances
jU which will do them no practical service when
It' the money is gone. Even where there is a
JL solid reserve fund available it is ill advised to
draw upon it heavily, or even to abstain from
.—i adding to it, if jwssible. at the outset of matri
mony. When once the initial expenses of the wedding
and house furnishing are over, the cost of living ought
to be. and usually is. less for a time than it will be there
after. Everything is new, and with ordinary care there
should be no outlay in replacing or repairing for some
time to come.
Whatever a man’s Income, be it large or small, his wife
has a moral right to a certain portion of it, upon which
she cun depend, and this should be given to her regu
larly, without her being compelled to ask for It. It is a
humiliating position for any one to be left without a dol
lar to pay an expressman; nay, worse, not to have the
small amount due on a letter delivered at the door! The
average man dislikes exceedingly to be continually asked
for small amounts of money, but he rarely appreciates
how galling it is to his wife’s pride, her self-respect, to be
obliged to make such requests. Let every man be honest
enough, and loving enough, to give his wife a fair idea of
his financial position, and trust her to conduct herself
accordingly, nor leave her in ignorance when serious
trouble is threatening to ingulf her as well as him.

TURTLES TURNED ON REFEREE.
They Ite.sentel Ainu's Interfering In
n Personal Quarrel.
Milton .T. Vreelaud, a farmer living
near Pine Brook, N. J., was nearly
drowned in the Passaic River the
other day as the result of his acting
as referee in a fight between two snap
ping turtles, says the New York
World. Vreelaud, who was in a canoe,
watched the bout for a minute or two
and then decided that it Avas time for
the combatants to break away.
He paddled up to them, reached
over the side, caught them by the tails,
one in each hand, and swung them into
the canoe —one in the bow, the other
in the stern of the frail craft. But
the turtles did not accept this deci
s'on. They AA'anted to fight on, and
being unable to get at each other they
attacked the self-appointed referee.
The farmer had found it an easy
matter to catch hold of the turtles’
tails Avhen they were in the water, but
it was Impossible now with the canoe
to keep on an even keel. He caught
up the paddle and with this managed
to beat off his assailants for a while,
but at last the canoe capsized. As it
did so one of the turtles dealt the
farmer a blow in the back just below
the belt. It clung to the place on the
trousers where it had snapped and
Vreeland found he could not swim.
He says himself he would have gone
to the bottom but for Frank Jacobus,
who turned a bend in the ri\-er In a
canoe and towed man and turtles
ashore.

He found a man in Ncav York Avho said
he could get some, and Whitney or

The dinner Avas a great success. In
discussing it next day Judge Lamar
said: “Those peaches were fine, Mr.
Whitney. Where did you get them?”
“In New York,” Mr. Whitney said.
“A man there found them for me.”
“Peaches in February are certainly
a great treat,” continued Lamar. “If
it is a fair question, how much did
they cost?”
“They cost forty-eight dollars a
dozen,” said Whitney.
“And did President Cleveland eat
any of them? He is so fond of fruit”
“Did be eat any of them?” exploded
Whitney. “I thought he rather crowd

BOXING.
Lite Badger Athletic dub of Milwau
kee gave a matinee boxing show at
Schlitz park on Thanksgiving day
and the atteudance was the larg
est of the season. Th e show w:is
good on the whole, but the main bout
between Jack O’Leary and Andy oo
zenah was not as good as might have
been expected. Jack clearly showed that
he is not the O’Leary of two years ago,
for he could not get going at his old gait
and allowed Bezenah to gain a lead in
the early rounds that he could over
come by rallies in the latter part of the
tight.
The boys weighed in at 130 pounds
and appeared in good shape, but Jack
was drawn too tine. Lor the first three
rounds the boys mixed in pretty good
shape, but after that O’Leary began cov
ering up and Avonld not come out of bis
shell except at intervals. This was what
cost him the decision, for when he would
mix matters with the Cincinnati boy he
more than held his own. In the eighth
and ninth rounds he showed Hashes of
his old speed, but not enough to going
right. In the tenth he started in witii
a rush to mix. but it came too late, and
the decision went to Andy, which was
right.
The bout between Rudolph Unholz,
the South African champion, and Mark
Anderson of Chicago was more of a
comedy than a light, as Anderson was
over six feet tall and so lanky that IJn
holz had hard work getting to him. Un
holz is short and chunky like Charlie
Noary and the difference in size between
the two boys vas funny. Unholz demon
strated one thing—that he can light, lie
is strong and active for a boy so well
built and had he been able to got at An
derson without jumping and losing the
strength of his blows in doing so he
would have put the Chicago man away
inside of three rounds. As it was the
bout went the limit of eight rounds, with
IJnholz winning easily. Against a man
of his own size Unholz would put up
a nasty battle and it will take a pretty
good man to defeat him. lie has the
goods with him and says he would like
nothing better than to get Charlie
Neary into the ring with him.
The prettiest bout of the day was be
tween Young Fitzgerald and Clem Den
ning of Chicago. These boys put up a
fast and clever bout for six rounds and
Fitz got the decision from Referee Har
ry Stout, which was a good one and cor
rect. There was some dissatisfaction
over the verdict- some of the spectators
thinking Denning deserved a draw, but
there is no doubt that Fitz had the best
of the bout and earned the verdict. The
Chicago lad put up a game and grand
struggle and for that reason had the
crowd with him, as the crowd always
admires a game one, and it was only
natural that the feeling should get the
better of their judgment in some cases.
Fitz hit clean and hard and in the first
round he scored one clean knock-down
and again sent Denning staggering
across the ring with a terrific right to
the jaw. Again in the sixth Fitz had
all the best of the exchanges and hit
lhe cleanest and cinched the verdict.
Manager Harry Gilmore stated after the
bout that Fitz had won the light fairly,
but he said he would like another chance
for Denning just tho same,
Reddy llalligau, the tough youngster
from Tory Hill, met a tartar in Jack
Redmond and lost the decision. It was
a red hot bout from beginning to end
with Reddy taking the majority of the
blows. The decisions of Referee Stout
were good throughout.
Honey Mellody of Charlestown won
the supposed welter weight champion
ship of the world from Joe Walcott of
Boston at the Lincoln A. C., in Chelsea,
Mass., Thursday. In the twelfth round
Walcott quit. He said later his left
arm became disabled in (be ninth round
and that it was impossible for him to
continue fighting. With the exception
of a couple of rounds Mellody outpoint
ed, ontpnnehed and outgeneraled the
Barba does wonder, and in the middle of
the twelfth Walcott relinquished all
claims to the title by acknowledging de
feat. Mellody was looked upon as a
certain winner at thrs stage, and it is
doubtful whether, even if the colored
man had two good arms and hands, he
could have evened up the score enough
to enable him to even earn a draw, as
he was constantly growing Avilder, with
little or no steam behind ids favorite
blows. On flic other hand, Mellody was
getting stronger and faster as the bout
progressed, and he was cautions at all
times, easily blocking and carrying Wal
cott’s desperate swings, books and labs,
and bis clever footwork carried him safe
ly out of range of the former "black
demon’s” furious rushes.
A few weeks ago the same boxers met
in the arena of the Lincoln club, and
the white boy was awarded the decision
at the end of the fifteen rounds. He
then claimed the championship, but as
the weight was 14i> pounds Mellody’s
claim to the championship was not con
o’dored valid by students of the game.
Thursday they Aveighed in at 142 pounds
at 3 o’clock.
Jimmy Gardner of Lowell, Mass, put
out Otto Sieloff of Ghicago in the third
round Thursday at Fort Wayne, Ind.
Dr. Krone of Chicago was referee. The
contest Avas at catch weights for ten
rounds. After one minute and twenty
two seconds in the third round a jab
with a right to the jaw. following a
blow on the head back of the ear, stag
gered Sieloff and sent him sprawling
across the lower rope. A shower of
Avater half revived him, but he could not
stand erect, although protesting that he
Avas not out and that his seconds had
given up too soon. It was clear, how
ever, tliat he could not last long under
the punishment he avus receiving from
Gardner.
There is little doubt that Johnny
Thompson of Sycamore. 111., would have
beaten Lew Powell in a few more
rounds if he had not lost his head in the
tenth round and given tlie ex-amateur a
low, foul blow in their fight at San
Francisco. Referee Roche after a long
delay and an examination by physicians
declared Powell the winner. Thomp
son was easily the master of the coast
fighter and showed it all the way
through the contest. He hammered
Powell bard and was getting stronger
as the fight progressed, while Powell
was gradually weakening under the rain
of punches. He could not have stood
up much longer.
It was a case of the straight puncher
against the wild swing when Young
Erne faced A onng Kenney of Lawrence,
Mass., at the National Athletic club’s
matinee in Philadelphia Thursday and
the former quality won the honors- for
the Philadelphian. It was a bard, fast
bout in every round except the fifth,
when neither man did anytldng of note.
Erne scored two knock downs.
George Guenther at Chelsea. Mass.,
Thursday only lasted three rounds
against Sam Langford. The Kangaroo
Avas punished all over the lot by his
heavier antagonist and bis seconds
threw up the sponge at (be end of the
third round. Guenther announced that
be wanted to go on. Langford was will
ing. but the former then concluded bo
had had enough.
