At the recent Se*-irn of the State Board
of Education in Baltimore city an im
|KHttnt step vat taken in the niaM*-r of
the appointment of teacher* for the pub*
lie *<bool* in the eonntSes. This ii,to
inrlv'le iu the form of the contract here
after to be issued the condition that the
appointment* !%!! continue from term
to term and from year In year, until
revoked according to law by an official
thirty day’* notice, signed by two tru* :
Ire*. Heretofore, it has been the cos
tum of the school trustee* to appoint
the teachers annually. 1 lie authority
of (he State Board to make this change
m unquestionable, as the school law
doe* not specify how the appointments
ha'l be made but leave* the method
under the control of the by-laws adop
ted bv the Board. One rood tendency
of this change will he to make the bux
ine** of teac bin; mure of a prft**ion
than it ha* heretofore been by giving
greater permanency to appointment*.—
We thiak the State Board of Education
have acted wisely in this matter and
have removed a cause of great disquie
tude to teachers by making their term*
of service a lifelong affair or until they
thall see fit to resign, provided their
good behavior shall justify it. 1
Board are unfavorable to any tinkering
hv the incoming legislature with the
School Lair, tlu-ir idea being, that the
best way to improve it is to let it alone,
and this is also the reunion of the Balti
more American, organ of
the Republican party in the State. Be
sides, if there be defects, as we have
no doubt there are, in our present scheme
of | ojmh.ir education, i' it not better for
the people ot thi* county to bear the
ills ul the present School System than
fly to others they know not of? It is |
tlii • consideration which should induce, j
we think, our present repre;'•nlatives i
at Annapolis “to make haste slow
lv‘ in re-opening -chool issues which j
may have the effect, whilst mending
certain defects, of marring vital fea
tures of a law upon which tre mainly
depend and have depended for years
for general educatn n in our county.
A>tnt .i:.ni or THEOnm Laws.
—An Annapolis correspondent of the
Baltin ore American, writing on the
subject 6f the Ute arrests by Capt. Clark,
of the Oyster Police Boat, Annie Mer
rvnian, for violations of the oyster laws,
speaking ol the news of the boats cap- ;
tured, say*:
‘•'l he condition of these crews is
deplorable, and shows at once the rig
orous and unequal character ol our oys
ter laws, ( tilers the poor men have
friends to bail them out of jail, as is un
like);, 'her willspend a long and drrai y
w inter in prison, as our court will not
'it until April to hear criminal rases.—
Of course, they are violators ol the law; j
but if they had disobeyed the captain's |
orders when commanded to dredge at
night, a belaying-pin on the offender’*!
head would verv likely have been the j
ansver to the lawful objection. In the !
meantime, the captain i* generally hailed
out bv theow nersofthe vessel or friends,
gels another crew, works the winter
through. i fined SSO in the spring, pay*
it or goes to jail for sixty days, whilst
the crews, alter five months’ imprison
ment, will be mercifully discharged
from custody by the court, probably
without formality of trial. The reme
dy lor this anomalous stale of affair* is
suggested by thoughtful ones—make
tlie vessel liable for violation* of the
law, and the owners will then secure
reliable and honest captains. As it now
is, the captains who will dredge on the
bars reserved for the tongmen have
great advantage over the man who
won't steal, both in getting a boat to
command and a load of oysters to sell.”
We much favor the remedy sugges
ted by the American's correypondeut
of making the vessel liable for viola
tions of our oyster laws, but we favor
it as an additional guard against such
violations, not as a suit! it ute for-exist
ing laws on (be subject. Let the
Captains a?id crews be punished as they
are now punished, and in addition to
this, let the owner of the vessel caught
dredging ia violet ion of law be made li
able in a penalty sufficiently large, if
not to sw amp the vessel, at least to
make it to the interest of the owner to
be careful in future as to w hom and
for what he hires his property.
TtcPrc*ldfßl*s Misuse.
The annual Message of the Presi
dent was communicated to Congress on
Monday last. Our space not admitting
of its publication entire, we have had
to content oumdves with a synopsis and
the one we present is that of the Bal
timore Sun. The mesMge begins by
congratulating Congress upon the suc
cess of the financial operations of the
treasury and their good effect* upon the
business of the country. The resume
is not materially different from the tacts j
and figure* presented in the report ot
the Secretary of the Treasury.
“The public credit ha? beee as great
ly benefited by resumption as the gen- *
oral business of the country, and the [
President thinks that ail the remaining
5 per c*nt. and 6 percent. ecuiitie* of
the government can be refunded in 4
per cent, bonds, thus effecting a forth-1
*k.-
I#f reiECtioa of#tl.-000.000 in annoal
. if.tr rest.
1 i ‘ The *ilver dollars coined under the
: recent afs of Congress now amount to
! $45 ; U00,fc50, of which $32 3**1.344 still
* remain in the treasury. Upon the basis
• of this fact and of the current propost
, lion for unify of action to effect a per
, manent y*tc*m for the equality ofjgold
and silver in the exchanges between
. the commercial nation*, the President
advises Congress to refrain from further
experiment* with the coinage and to
• sU’-perid the coining of stiver dollars as
I now ordered by law.
“He say* that “the retirement from
( circulation - of United State* notes, with
the* opacity of legal-tender in private
contracts is a step to be taken in our
progress toward* a safe and stable cur
, rency, which should be accepted as the
policy and duty of the government and
the interest and security of the people.”
Tt e Fre odent expresses it as his “firm
conviction” that the issue of legal-ten
der paper money on the credit and au-
Ihority ol (be government, except in
extreme emergency, “i* without war
- *ant in (be constitution and a violation of
s und f nancial principles.” He there
fore advocate* their retirement and the
rigid maintenance of the sinking funds,
in order to extinguish the national debt
as soon a* possible, iu pur.'uit of our
traditional government policy. If more
revenue be needed, it can be easily ob
tained by duties on tea and coffee.
• file President refer* to the contin
ued deliberate violation of the laws sup
jri"iitg polygamy by prominent citi
: zens of I tab. ami demands the strict
I enforcement of these law*, which have
been decided to be constitutional by
the Supreme Court.
“He appeals to Congress and to the
people ol the country to unite in bringing
general public opinion to bear iu favor of
the general observance ot and respect for
the law* enforcing the sancity of the
suffrage throughout the whole land, and
launches into a long and earnest argu
ment in favor f his views about the re
form of the civil service, which have
several time* before been di-cuv-ed by
him. The President report* tfiat con
siderable and satisfactory progress has
already been made in tlu*e direction*,
but he thinks that much remains 'till to
be done, lie distinguishes elaborately j
between offices which are.simply exec
utive and administrative and tho-e
which are more or less political, deem
ing it to be eminently proper for the
President’* official advisers' to explain
! before the people the policy of an ad- ;
; ministration brought into office by the
i popular vole, advocates the providing,
Ini just and adequate means for examin
ing candidates lor office, so that the
worthiest claimant may be certain ol
, getting the apjointrnent. The Presi
dent’s duties in these particulars arc ob
vious, but hv 1 contends that nothing ad- •
equate in the premises ran be arcom- j
piisbed by bim without the co-opera-)
tion of Congress and the considerate ;
and intelligent support of the people.
The resumption of work hy the civil
service commission is recommended,
and an appropriation to (hat end is urged.
“The foreign relation? of the gov
ernment continue peaceful. The diffi
! culty with Great Britain growing out of
! the Fortune Bay (Newfoundland) out
i rages is being considered by Lord Bea-
I con'fields government. The
/question, only temporary adjusted by
the treaty of Washington, needs to be j
permanently settled as a whole, and j
. negotiation* to that end ar<* now mi pro
gress. The message al*o touche* upon
the cattle trade restrictions, upon lile- j
saving measures taken by the Durum- j
j tun government in connection with the
i commerce of the great lakes, anti upon
the Australian international shows, re
commending an increased appropriation
for American exhil.it*.
“The hte treaty with Japan, it is ex
pected, will serve a* a model for other ,
countries. China has expressed wil- |
lingnes* to discuss the emigration que- j
lion with us in a dispassionate way, and
negotiations to that end are now pend
ing.- I‘order raids on the Rio Grande
fiontier have been checked, and our di
plomatic intercourse with the United
States ot Columbia is again restored.—
This is regarded a* especially fortunate
in view ot the prominence which has
ju'l been attained by the interoceanic
canal project. Our increasing trade
with Mexico and South America sug
gest* to the I'resident the expediency
of Congress providing means" for regu
lar and frequent mat! communication
with those countries.
“Additional legislation is claimed to
be needed for the protection of (he rights
ol the people in Aia-ka, and a form of ter
nforial government is recommended
there. The President, after comment
ing upon (he operations of the army
and navy duiingthe year, and showing
that the Department of Justice ha been
obstructed by the lack ol appropria
tions, and that the business of the Su
preme Court is so largely in arrears as
to demand the creation ol intermediate
court* and appointment of additional
circuit judges considers with approval
the proposition* ol the Postmaster-Gen
eral in regaid to increased facilities lor
dome'tic and foreign mail service.
“The Indian problem is fully treated)
of in the message, and fhe President
recommends specifically to Congress
the ‘ uggestions ol Secretary Schuizand
Commissioner flaw upon this subject.
He say* that, w hile the Executive is
determined to protect the Indians in
their territorial rights, it would be un
wise to ignore the tact that organized
raids like that against the Cherokee j
country, which wa'broken up by Ex- j
ecutive | ochimafion in la*t April, are j
i liable to be repealed year after year as !
I land gets scarcer and more valuable,
i and hence the expediency ot speedy
change* in our Indian policy At the
same time the President deprecates the
proposed transfer of the Indians from
the Interior to the War Department.
“The President renews hi* recom
’ mendattons in favor ot enlarging the
facilities of (he department of agricul
• ture. He also call* the attention of
| Congress to the paramount subject ol
; education and its progress, urges the
completion of the Washington monu
ment. and invokes a generous policy on
! the parloflbe national legislature towards
; the District of Columbia, its thorough
: fare*, approaches and its school*. *

“seriously considered the charge of Judge Brent
on tbe subject of grunting licenses and determ
ined to grant none to any one who proposed to

this a victory for the Local Option!*?*. The

County Commissioners for neglecting to cause a

They a'so indicted Thomas Carrico for placing
a gale on the public road. The Timet is Ir

being approved by them, his sureties being

son, Robert, was sworn in at the sarre time as
deputy. Mr. Abell is a gentleman of enlarged
experience tn pcolic atfairs and has always en
jo, ed the reputation of being a man of strict bus- I

for him a generous forbearance until be ghall
