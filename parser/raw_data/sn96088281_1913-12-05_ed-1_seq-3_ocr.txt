PRESIDENT WILSON'S
MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
Washington, Dec. 2. For the
fourth time since his inauguration,
President Wilson today personally
addressed a joint session of the house
of representatives and senate of the
United States.
The lawmakers gathered for the
occasion in the representatives'
chamber, whither tie senators
marched, two by two, with Vice
President Marshall and Sergeant- at
Arms Biggins in the lead.
President Wilson arrived at the
capitol by automobile, directly from
the White House. Vice-President
Marshall and Speaker Clark had been
named as a commltteo of two to re
ceive him. Meeting him at the en
trance to the chamber, they escorted
him to his place beside the (peak
er's desk, where, standing easily be
fore the gathering, much like a pro
fessor addressing his class, he read
his message in the clear, cultured ac
cents with which, since he assumed
office, the lawmakers have grown so
well acquainted. He remained only
long enough to finish the message,
bowed courteously to the legislators,
left the chamber, escorted, as he had
entered, by Marshall and Clark, and
motored back to the executive man
sion. The following Is a synopsis of the
message as delivered by tho presi
dent: "The country, I am thankful to
say, Is at peace with all the world.
More and more readily do the na
tions manifest their willingness ' to
bind themselves by treaty to the pro
cesses of peace. So far the United
States has stood at the front of such
negotiations. She will, I hope and
believe, give fresh proof of her ad
herence to international friendship
by ratifying the several treaties of
arbitration awaiting renewal by the
senate.
One Cloud on Horizon
"There Is but one cloud upon our
horizon. That hangs over Mexico.
There can be no certain- prospect of
peace In America until General Huer
ta has surrendered his usurped au
thority; until it Is understood that
such pretended governments will not
be countenanced by the United States.
"I turn to matters of domestic
concern.
"You have under consideration a
bill for the reform of the currency
system,, for which the country waits
as for something fundamental to Its
whole business life. I need not say
how earnestly I hope for its early en
actment into law.
Urges Farm Credit System
"I present to you In addition the
urgent necessity that special provi
sion be made for facilitating the cre
dits needed by the farmers. They
need and should obtain legislation
which will make their own abundant
and substantial credit resources
available as a foundation for joint,
concerted local action in their own
behalf In getting the capital they
must use. Systems of rural credit
have been developed on the other
side of the water, while we left our
farmers to shift for themselves. You
have but to look about you ln any
rural district to see the handicap
and embarrassment which have been
put upon those who produce our
food.
"I hope and believe that the com
mittees of the senate and house will
address themselves to this matter
with the most fruitful results.
"Turn from the farm to the world
of business, and I thluk all will agree
that the immediate service we owe
the business communities of tho
country Is to prevent private mon
opoly more effectually than It has
been prevented.
"I think It will be easily agreed
that we should let tho Sherman anti
trust law stand, but that we should
as much as possible reduce the area
of its debateable ground by farther
and more explicit legislation and al
so supplement that great act by legis
lation which will not.nty. clarify it
but alto facilitate its administration
and make it fairer to all concerned.
Direct Nomination of President
"I feel confident that I do not
misinterpret the wishes of the coun
try when I urge prompt enactment
of legislation which will provide for
primary elections at which the voters
may choose their nominees for the
presidency, without the intervention
of nominating conventions. I sug
gest that this legislation should pro
vide for the retention of conventions,
but only for the purpose of accepting
the verdict of the primaries and
formulating platforms.
Indepcnilcnre for Philippines
"Dlscissing the country's foreign
possesions, the president urge! a
steady movement toward Indepen
dence for the Philippines.
"In Alaska, he advocated the full
form of territorial government,
government-owned and managed
, railroads, and development, without
l waste, of the country's resources
without monopoly "upon any narrow
Idea of individual rights as against
the abiding Interests of communi
ties." Other recommendations the presi
dent made were the equipment of the
bureau of mines with power to Im
prove the miners' condition and make
mines more productive and safer, an
effective employers' liability act for
the benefit of railroad men and alle-
vtatiou "of the very unsafe, unjust
and Burdensome conditions which
surround the employment of sailors."
Admission iby Card
Admission to the galleries of the
house was by card. Representatives
received one card each for the bene
fit of their friends and senators two
each. Most of them were given to
the lawmakers wives, daughters or
sisters. Legislators representing
states In which equal rights prevail
In particular were deluged with ap
plication for tickets from women
voters.
The result was that women far
outnumbered the men among the
spectators. The occasion was made
distinctly a fashionable one, gorge
ous millinery created a splendid
spectacle ln the galleries.
On the floor of the house the front
seats were reserved for senators.

tatives standing, 66 tho visiting upper

er's gavel was heard.

SUFFRAGETTE SECESSION
SEEMS yillE LIKELY
Washington, Dec. 2. Leaders nt
the National Suffragists convention
here feared today the secession of
several state organizations as a re
sult of a fight over the new consti
tution, which ln Its changed form
provides for an assessment system in
which each state is required to
pledgo a fixed sum, according to its
size, for the benefit of the' national
body. Opponents of the- plan want
ed to stick to tho old method of vol
untary contributions. Nevertheless,
tho committees engaged lu consider
ing the matter reported at the fore
noon session In favor of the change.
Dr. Anna Shaw, Mrs. Carrie Chap
man Catt, Miss Jano Addams, Con
gressman Raker and other sufTralHt8
were scheduled for speeches today.
The auM-suffraglsts were to have
their Innings Thursday.
PAGE THREB
How to Detect the
Alum Baking Powder
"Which are the alum baking powders;
how can I avoid them unless they are named )"
asks a housekeeper.
Here is one way: take the can of a low
priced powder in your hand and read the
ingredient clause upon the back label. The
law requires that it the powder contains alura
that fact must be there stated. If you find
one of the ingredients named alum, or sul
phate of aluminum, you have found an alum
taking ponder.
There is another and a better way. You
don't have to know the names of the alum
powders. Use Royal Baking Powder only;
that assures you a cream of tartar powder,
and the purest and most healthful baking
powder beyond question.
