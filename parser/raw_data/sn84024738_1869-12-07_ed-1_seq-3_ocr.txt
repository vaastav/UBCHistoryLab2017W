THE FLECTIONS CNF LP. RECONSTRUCTION IN
TEE SOUTH.
Congress, bv joint resolution, author
ed the Lxecutive to order elections in
jitc xaies of \ irgiuia. Nlississippi, and
i'Xas, to -ubmit to tliem the Constitu
tions which each had previously frame/'
ynd to rubmit the Constitutions either en
ure r in >eparute parts to lie voted upon at
'i.e diseretion ot the Executive. Under
?iiis authority elections were called. In
\ irgiuia the election took place ou the 0th
"f July. The Governor and Lieutenant
Governor elected have been installed. The
' egi-lature met and did all required by thi
rtsoluiion and by all the reconstruction
a.-ts of Congress, and abstained from all
doubtful authority. I recommend that her
senators and representatives be promptly
admitted to their seat-, and that the Mate
be fully restored to its place in the family
ot States.
Elections were called in Mississippi and
! ? v.-, to commence November .'iuth?two
- iu Mississippi and four in Texas. The
? lection- have taken place, out the result i
1 t known, it is hoped that the acts of the
Legislatures of these Mates, when they
meet, will bv' such as to receive your ap
proval. and thus close the work of recou
-tructi'on.
THE RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENT.
Anions the evil" growing out of the re
b* lion, and not yet referred to, is that of
irredeemable currency. It is an evil
??hi hope will receive your most earnest
al-eiiiiort. It i- acluty, ami one of the high
???d duties of Government, to >eeure to the
' itizen a medium of fixed and unvarying
wdn?\ This implies a return to a specie
and no substitute for it can he de
mised. It should be commenced now, and
nched at the earliest practicable moment
" li-istent with a fair regard to the interest
"f i he debtor class. Immediate resump
tion, if practicable, would not be desirable,
it would compel the debtor class to pay be
> ond their contracts the premium on gold at
'tie date of their purchase, and would bring
bankruptcy and ruin to thousands. Fluctu
ations, however, in the paper value of the
nicusure of all values?gold, is detrimental
to the interests of trade. It makes the man
of business an involuntary gambler, for in
II cax-s where future payment is to be
nude, both the parties speculate as to what
will be the value of the currency paid and
nvi-iwd. I earnest h recommend to you,
liteii, sinh legislation as will insure a gra
dual return to specie payments, and put
au immediate slop to the fluctuations in
the value of currency. The methods to
M-cure the lornier of these results are
as numerous as speculators on political
e onoinv. 1o secure the latter, I see
but one war; and that is to au
thoiizc the fVea-ury to redeem its own
paper at a fixed value whenever presented,
and withhold from circulation all currency
redeemed until sold again for gold. The
^ resources of the nation, both developed
sad undeveloped, ought to make our credit
'he best on earth. 'NTith less ??urdeu of tax
ation than the citizen has endured for f he
ux years past, the entire public debt could
1* paid in ten years, but it is not desirable
that the people should be taxed to pay if in
|hat time. Year by t ear the ability to pay
iicreutes in rapid ratio, but the burden of
interest ought to be reduced as rapidlv as
'"in be without a violation of contract, 'fhe

.vears to run, bearing interest at the rate

FISCAL STATEMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.
The report of the Secretary of the Tit >
sury shows the receipts ol the Govern me t
for the li- al year ending June 30th, S-'JT- -
013,747, una expenditures, including bou -
ties, &c., tj321,48(),oh7. The estimates i r
the ensuing year are more favorable to ti.e
Government, and will no doubt show i
much larger decrease of the public deb .
The -receipts in the Treasury beyond t!i .?
expenditure*, have exceeded the" ainou: '
neeessiry t> be placed to the eredu
of the sinking fund, as provided by
law. To lock up the surplu.-m the Treasur".
and withhold ii from circulation would lea \
to such a cuut ractii >u of currency as to cri pp*
trade and seriously affect the prosperity
the eouutry. Under these circumstaiio ?
the Secretary of ihe Treasury and inys?
heartily concurred in the propriety of usiu
all the surplus currency in the Treasury i
t!ie purchase of Government bonds, thu
reducing the int?':e-t-l?earing indebted ties- ;
the country. and of submitting1 o '
t lie question of ! ' t
the bonds so purcba.-ed. xui-b?..u- now
held by (he Treasury amount to^TnJMkuiiO,
including those of the sinking fund. I rc
eouiuiend that the whole be placed to tho
credit of the sinking fund.
Your attention is respectfully invited to
the recommendations of the Seerctaiy of the
Treasury lor the creation of the office of
( omnji^iouero!" Customs and Revenue, for
the increase of the salary of certain classes
of official-, and the substitution of increased
national bank circulation to replace out
standing three per cent, certificates, and
most especially to his recommendation tor
tiie repeal of laws allowing shares of lines,
penalties, forfeitures,et<\, to the officers of
Government or to informers.
COMMISSIONER 01" INTERNAL REVENUE. j
The office of Commissioner of Internal j
Revenue is one of the most arduous and !
responsible under the Government, and j
fall- but little short of a Cabinet position in 1
its importance and responsibilities. I would j
ask for it. therefore, such legislation a- in j
your judgment will place the. oilice upon :>
footing ot dignity commensurate with it
imporlanee and with the character and ;
qualification* of the class of men required
to lili it properly.
CUBA.
A* the United .States is the freest of all
nations, so do its people sympathize with
all people struggling for liberty and self
government. Hut while so sympathizing it
i- due to our honor that we'sbould abstain
from enforcing our views upon unwilling
nations, and from taking an iutercsted part
in quarrels between different nations, or
between Governments and their subject-.
Our course should always be in conformity
willi stiict justice and" law?international
and local. Such has been the policy of this
Administration in dealing with these ques
tions for more than a year. A valuable pro
' Spain, and a near neighbor of ours.
vines of , ,
in whom all our people cannot Hut feel a deep
interest, has been struggling for independ
ence and freedom. The people and Govern
ment of the United State-entertain the same
warm feelings and sympathies for the people
of Cuba in their pending struggle that they
manifested throughout the pfevious strug
gles between Spain and her former colonies
iu behalf of the hitter. The contest has at
no time assumed conditions which amount
j to war in the souse of international law, or
I which would show the existence of a de
\ facto political org inization of the insurgents
,-ufMeient to justify a recognition of nelli
gerencv. The principle is maintained, how
ever, that lliis nation is its own judge of
when to accord the rights of belligerency
either to a people struggling to tree them
selves Iron: a Government they believe to
be oppressive or to independent nations at
war with each other. The United .States
has no disposition to interfere with the ex
isting relations of Spain to her colonial
possessions oil .this continent. They believe
riiat in due time Spain and other European
Powers will find their interest in terrains- j
ting those relations and establishing their
present dependencies as independent Pow- i
ers. These dependencies are no longer, re- I
garded as subjects ot transfer from one Eu- I
ropean Power to another. When the pre- i
sent relations of colonies ceases they are to 1
become independent Powers, exercising
tiie right of choice and of self-control in i
the determination of their future con- i
diliou and relation with other Towers.
The I nitcd States, in order to put a stop
to the bloodshed in Cuba, and in the inte
rest ol the neighboring ]?eople, proposed
its good offices to bring the existing contest
to a termination. The oiler, not being ac
cepted by Spain on the basis which we be
lieved could be received bv Cuba, was
withdrawn. It is hoped that tlie good offices
of the L'nitod States may prove advan- ;
tageous lor the settlement "of this unhappy i
strife. In the mean while, a number of
illegal expeditions against Cuba have been
broken up. It has been the endeavor of the
Administration to execute the neutrality
laws, 110 matter how unpleasant the task,
made so by the suffering we endured from
the lack of like good laith towards lis by
ot her nations.
SPANISH SEIZURE OK AN AMERICAN VESSEL, j
On the 2tith of March last the United
States schooner Lizzie Major was arrested on
the high seas by a Spanish frigate, and two
passengers taken and curried prisoners to
Cuba. Representations of these faets were
made to the Spanish Government as soon as
official information reached Washington.
The two passengers were set at liberty, and
the Spanish Government assured the United
States that the captain of the frigate making
the capture had acted without law, that he
had been reprimanded, and that the Spanish
authorities in Cuba would not sanction any
act that could violate the rights or treat
with disrespect the sovereignty of this na
tion.
The question of the seizure of the brig
Mary Lowell, at Bahama, by the Spanish
authorities is now the subject of correspond
ence between this Government ami Spain
and Great Britain.
The Captain-General of Cuba about May
last issued a proclamation authorizing the
searching of vessels on the high seas. Im
mediate remonstrance was made against
this, whereupon the Captain-General issued
a new proclamation limiting the search to j
vessels ot the United States authorized under !
the treaty- of 17&>. This proclamation, j
however, "was immediately withdrawn. I I
have always felt that the most intimate rela
tions should be cultivated between the
United States and independent nations on
this continent. It may be well worth con
sidering whether new treaties between us
and them may not be profitably entered
into to secure more intimate relations
friendly, commercial, and otherwise.

THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
ftm,?oV?rcl'S lI\e- close o{ tlie 14151 administra
tis ronvenlion was signed at London for
the settlement of outstanding- claims be
tween Great Britain and the United States
iL?Ct tl t'.) recelve the consent of the i
..en ate. ihe time and the circumstances
attending the negotiation of that treaty i
were unfavorable to its acceptance bv the
people ol the United States, and its provi
sions were wholly inadequate to the settle
ment. ol the grave wrongs sustained by this
Government. -
The injuries resulting to the United States
by reason of the course adopted bv Great
Britain during the war in the increase of i
the rates of insurance, in the diminution]
ol exports and imports and other obstruc- I
tions to domestic industry and production, '
n its eflect upon the foreign commerce ol
the country, in the decrease and transfer to
Great Britain of our commercial marine, in
the prolongation of the war. and in the in
creased cost both in treasure and in lives of!
its suppression, could not be adjusted ami ]
satisiied as ordinary commercial claims \
which continually arise between oomrner-!
cial nations ; and yet the convention treated I
them simply as such ordinary claims, from j
which they differ more widely in the 1
gravity of their character than' in the !
magnitude of tiieir amount. Great even \
as if, that different*, not a word was found
in the treaty, and not an inference eoukl be
drawn from it, to remove the sense of the
unfriendliness of the course of Great Bri
tain in our struggle for existence which had
so deeply "a fid universally impressed itself
upon the people of this country. Believing
tnat a convention thus misconceived in its
scope and inadequate in its provisions would
not have produced the lieartv, cordial sei
tlcineiit of the pending questions which
alone is consHcnt with she relations which
I curare to have iinnly established between
the United .States and Great Britain, I re
garded the action of the Senate in the rejec
tion of the treaty to have beenwiseh taken
m the interest of peace ami as a necessary
step in the direction of a perfect and cor
dial friendship between tlie two countries,
A sensitive people, conscious of tiieir j
power, are more wholly at ease under
a great "wrong wholly* unntoncd, than
under the ^restraint of ;i settlement which '
f-atHhes neither their ideas of justice nor |
tiu-ir grave seme of the grievance they have j
sustained. The rejection of the trentv was
followed by a state of public feeling bn i
boili sides which 1 thought not favorable
to aii immediate attempt at renewed I
negotiations, i accordingly so instructed
the Minister of the United* Stales to Great
Britain, and found that inv views in tl.U
regard were shared by her Majesty's Milli
ter.,. I hope that 1 he time may soon arrive
when the two Governments can approach
the solution of this momentous quotion
with an appreciation of what is due to the
rights, dignity, and honor'of each, and with
the determination not only to remove the
causes of complaint in the past, hut to lav
the foundation of a broad principle of pub
lic law which will prevent iuture differ
ences, and tend to linn and continued friend
ship. This is now the only grave question
Vr^teh the United States has with anv
foreign nation.
RECIPROCITY WITH CANADA.
The question of renewing the treaty for
reciprocal trade between the United .states
and the British provinces on this continent
is not favorably considered. In conformity
with the recommendation of Con cress *a
proposition to abolish mixed courts for the
suppression of the slave trade is uuder ne
gotiation.
THE FRENCH CABLE.
It having come to my knowledge that a
I corporate company, organized under JJ:i
tish laws, proposed to land upon Uie shores
| of the United states, and to operate there a
sub-marine cable, under a concession of tlie
I Emperor of the French of an exclusive
right for twenty years, for telegraphic com
munication between the shores of France
and the United States, with the very ojec
tionable feature of subjecting all messages
i conveyed thereby to the scrutiny and con
trol of the Fren ch Govern meat, I caused
the French and British legations at Wash
ington to be made acquainted with the
probable policy of Congress on this subject J
as foreshadowed by a bill which passed the j
Senate in March last.
This drew from the representatives of the I
company an agreement to accept as the j
basis of their operations the provisions of;
the bill or such other enactments on the
subject as might In? pas-cd during the ap
proaching session of Congress, also to use
their influence to secure from the French
Government, a modification of their conces
sion to permit the landing of any cubic be
longing to any company incorporated by
authority of the United .States or any State
in the Union, and 011 their part not'to op
pose the establishment of any such cable,
in consideration of this agreement 1 direct
ed the withdrawal of all opposition by the
United States to the landing of the cable
until the meeting of Congress. 1 regret to
say there has been 110 modification made in
the company's concession, nor, so far as I
can learn, have they attempted to secure
one.
Their concession excludes capital and
citizens of the United States from competi
tion upon the shores of France. I recom
mend legislation to protect the rights of
citizens of the United States and the sove
reignty of the nation against such an as
sumption ; and i shall also endeavor to se
cure by negotiation the abandonment of
the principle of monopolies iu ocean cables.
NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
The unsettled political condition of other
countries less fortunate than our own some
times induces their citizens to come to the
United States for the sole purpose of be
coming naturalized. Having secured this,
they return to their native country and re
side there without disclosing their change
of allegiance. They accept official positious
of trust or honor which can only be held by
citizens of their native lands. They journev
under passports describing them as such
i citizens; and it is only when civil discord
! (after perhaps years of quiet) threatens
j their persons or their property, or when
! their native State drafts them into military
j service, that their change of .allegiance is
known.
Thev reside permanently away from the
| United States, contribute nothing to its
! revenues, and avoid the duties of citizenship,
and ouly make themselves known by a
! claim for protection. 1 have directed the
diplomatic and consular officers to scruti
nize carefully all such claims to protection.
A citizen of the United State?, whether na
tive or adopted, who discharges his duty to
hiscountrv, ts entitled to its complete "pro
tection. "tVliile I have a voice in the di
rection of affairs, I shall not consent to im
peril this sacred right by conferring it 011
fictitious or fraudulent claimants.
REGULATIONS FOR IMMIGRANT SUITS.
Invitations have been extended to the
Cabinets of London, Paris, Berlin, Brussels,
The llague, Copenhagen, and Stockholm,
to empower their representatives at Wash
ington to simultaneously enter into nego
Nations and to conclude with tbo United j
States con ventiona identical in form, making
uniform regulations as to the construction !
of narts of vessels devoted t,o the use of |
emigrant passengers, as to the quality and
quantity of food, as to the medical treat
ment of the sick, ^nd as to the rules to be
observed during the voyage in order to se
cure ventilation, to promote health, to pre
vent intrusion, and to protect females, and
providing for the establishment of tribunals
in the several countries for enforcing such
regulations by summary process.
TARIFF ON RUSSIAN HEMP.
Your attention is respectfully called to
the law regulating the tariff on Russian
hemp, and to the"question whether to fix
the charges on Russian hemp higher than
they art? fixed on tnanilla is not a violation
of our treaty with Russia placing her pro
duets on the same footing with those of the
moat favored nations.
OUR MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCING
INTERESTS.
Our manufactures are increasing with
wondorful rapidity under the encourage
ment which they now receive. With the
improvements in machinery already effected
and still increasing, causing-machinery to
take the place of skilled labor to a large ex
tent, our imports of many articles must fall
off largely. Fort uuately,"too, manufactures
are not confined to a low localities, as for
merly, and it is to be hoped will become more
nnd more diffused, making the interest in
tliem equal in all sections. They give em
ployment and support to hundreds of thou
sands of people, and retain with us the
means which otherwise would be shipped
abroad.
The extension of the railroads in Europe
nnd the Ea?t is bringing into competition
with our agricultural products like pro
duct* of other countries. Self-interest, if not
self-preservation, therefore dictates caution
against disturbing any industrial interest of |
the country. It teaches us also the neces
sity of looking to other markets for the sale
of "our surplus. Our neighborssouth of us,
and Chiua and Japan, should receive our
special attention. It will bo the endeavor of
the Administration to cultivate such rela
tions with all these nations as to entitle us
to their confidence, and make it their inte
rest as well as ours to establish better com
mercial relations.
THE CHINESE QUESTION*
Through the agency of a more enlightened
policy than that heretofore pursued to
wards China, largely due to the sagacity
and efforts of our own distinguished citi
zens, the world is about to commence large
ly increased relations with that populous
and hitherto exclusive nation. As the
United States have been the initiators in
this new policy, so they should be the most
earnest in showing their good faith in
making it a success. Tn this connection I
advise such legislation as to forever preclude

China be raised to one of the first-class.
CHANGE IS OFFICE-HOLDERS.
On my assuming the responsible duties
of Chief Magistrate of the United States, it
was with the conviction that three things
were essential to its peace, prosperity, and
fullest development. First among these is
strict, integrity in fulfilling all our obliga
tion-* ; second, to secure protection to the
person and property of the citizen of the
United .States in each and every portion of
our common country wherever he may
choose to move without reference to his
original nationality, religion, color, or poli
ties, demanding of him only obedience to
the laws, and proper respect for the rights
of others; ana third, the union of nil the
States, with equal rights, indestructible by
any constitutional means*
To secure the first of these Congress has
taken two essential steps: first, in declaring
by joint resolution that the public debt
should be-paid- principal and interest, in
coin : and secondly, providing the means
for paying. I'roviiliug the means, however,
could not secure the object desired without
a proper administration of the laws for the
collection of the revenues and an economi
cal disbursement of them. To this subject,
the Administration lias addressed it-elf
with results, f hope, satisfactory to the
country. There has been no hesitation in
changing officials in order to secure an etfi
cicnt exec lit ion of t he laws?sometimes, too,
v here, in a mere party view, undesirable pb
liii<-al results were likely to follow?nor anv
Iiositation in sustaining efficient officials
against remou* trailers wholly political. It
may !?e well to mention here the embarrass
ment posfei t) arise from leaving on the
statute-books the so-called tenure-of-olliee
acts, and to earnestly recommend their total
repeal, it could not have been the inten
tion of the framers of the Constitution, in
providing that appointments made by the
President should"receive the consent of the
senate, that the latter should have the
power to retain in office persons placed
there by Federal appointments against the
will of the President. '1 he law is incon
istent with a faithful nnd efficient adminis
tration of the. (?ovcrnment. What faith can
an Executive put in officials forced upon
him, and those, too, whom he has suspended
for reasonIIow will such officials be likely
to serve an Administration which they know
does not trust them'(
For the second requisite to our growth
and prosperity, time aud a firm but hu
mane administration of existing laws,
amended from time to time as they" may be
ineffective, or prove harsh or unnecessary,
are probably all that are required.
INDIAN AFFAIRS.
The third cannot be obtained by spe
cial legislation. It must be regarded as
fixed by the Constitution itself, and gradu
ally acquiesced in by force of public opi- j
uion. From the foundation of the Govern
ment to the present, the management of
the original inhabitants of this continent
(the Indiaus) lias been a subject of embar
rassment and expense, and has been at- 1
tended with continuous robberies, mur
ders, and wars. From my own experience
on the frontiers and iu Indian countries, I
do not hold eirtier legislation or the conduct
of the whites, who come mo-t in contact
with the Indians, blameless for these hos
tilities.
The past, however, cannot be un
done, and the question must bo met us
we now find it. 1 have attempted a new
policy towards these wards of the nation,
(they cannot be regarded in any oilier light
than as wards,) with fair results so far as
tried, and which, 1 hope, will be attended
ultimately with great success. The .Society
of Friends is well known as having succeeded
in living in peace with the Indians in the
early settlement of Pennsylvania, while
their white neighbors of other sects, in
other sections, were constantly embroiled.
They are also known for their opposition to
all strife, violence, and war, and are gene
raltv noted for their strict integrity and fair
dealings. These considerations* induced
me to give the management of a few reser
vations of Indians to, and to throw the
burden of theselectiou of agents upon, the
Society itself.
The result has proven most satisfactory.
It will lie found more fully set forth in the
report of the Commissioner of Indian Af
fair-. For superintendents and Indian
agents not on reservations, officers of the
army were selected. The reasons for this
are "numerous. Where Indiau agents are
sent, there or near there troops must also
he sent. The agent and the comniauder of
troops are independent of each other, and
are subject lo orders from different depart
ments of the Government. The army of
ficer holds a position for life, the agent one
at the will of the President. The lormer is
personally interested in living iu harmony
with the Indians and establishing a perma
nent peace to the end that some portion of
his life may be spent in civilized society.
The latter *ha> no such personal interest.
Another reason i? an economical one ; and
stiil another, the hold which the Govern
ment has upon a life officer to secure a faith
ful discharge of the duties in carrying out a
given policy. The building of railroads and
the access "thereby given to all the agricul
tural and miueral regions of the country is
rapidly bringing civilized settlements into
eontuc't with alf the tribes of Indians. I>'o
matter what ought to be the relation? be
tween su<-h settlements and the abori
gines, the fact is that they do not harmo
nize well, and one or the other has to
give way in the end. A system which
looks to the extinction of a race is too hor
rible for u nation to adopt without entailing
upon itself the wrath of all Christendom,
and engendering in the citizen a disregard
for human life and the rights of others dan
gerous to society. I see no substitute for
such a system except iu.placing all the
Indians on large reservations as rapidly as
It can be done, and giving them absolute
Sotection there. As soon as they are fitted
? It they should be Induced to take their
lands in severalty and to set up territorial
governments for their own protection. For
full details on this subject T call your special
attention to the reports of the 'Secretary ol
the Interior and the Commissioner of In
dian Affairs. $
THE ARMY?FORTIFICATIONS, SzC.
The recommendation of the General of
the Army that appropriations be made for
the forts at Boston, Portland, New York,
Philadelphia, New Orleans, uud San Fran
fisco, is concurred in.
I call special attention to the recommen
dations of the Chief of Ordnance for (he
sale of arsenals and lands no longer of use to
the Government; also to the recommenda
tion of the Secretary of "War that the act
prohibiting promotions in the staff corps oX
the army be repealed. The extent of country
to be garrisoned and the number of military
Sosts to be occupied is the same with a re
uced armv as with a large one. The num-~
ber of staff officers required is more de
pendent on the latter than the former con
dition.
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
accompanying this shows the condition of
the uaw." When this Administration came
into otflee, and by changes made since,
strenuous efforts have been made to place
as many vessels in commission, or render
them tit for service when required, as pos
sible, and to substitute the sail for steam
while cruising, thus materially reducing
the expense ot the navy and adding greatly
to its efficiency. Looking to our 1 uture, I
recommend a" liberal though not extrava
gant policy towards this branch of the pub
lic service."
TOST?OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Postmaster-General
furnishes a clear and comprehensive ex
hibit of the operations of the postal service
and of the financial condition of the Po-t
oltiee Department. The ordinary postal
revenues for the year ending June .30, 1?G9,
amounted to $18,144,310, and the expendi
tures to ?23,893,131. Your .attention is re
spectfully called to the recommendation
made by "the Postmaster-Genera! for autho
rity to change the rate of compensation to
the main trunk-railway lines for their ser
vices in carrying the mails, for having post
route maps executed, for reorganizing and
increasing the efficiency of the special
agency service, for the increase of the mail
service of the Pacific, and for establishing
mail service under the flag of the Union in
the Atlantic; and most especially do 1 call
your attention to his recommendation lor
the total abolition of the franking privilege.
This is an abuse from which no one receives
a commensurate advantage, it reduces the
receipts lor postal sendee from twenty-five to
thirty per cent., and largely increases the |
service to be performed.
THE PATENT OFFICE?INTERIOR DEPARTMENT,
ETC.
During the year ending September 30,
SG9, the Patent Office H?Ued 13.7G2 patents,
ad its receipt-, were ?83(5,339, being $213,
L'O more than the expenditure's.
I respectfully call vour attention to the
nr tho of the In
1 re.speciiunv can ??.m
ecominendation of the Secretary of the lu
erior for uniting the duties of supervising
ite education of treedmcu with the othei^
lie (.'UULiltlOM U1 * 1 WUU4V ?, .. ....
uties devolving upon the Commissioner of
Education.
If it is tlie desire of Congress to make the
I'lisus during tlie year 1370 more complete
ml perfect, I would suggest early action
ipou any plan that may be agreed upon.
Vs Congress at tin* last session appointed a
ommittce to take into consideration such
neasures as might be deemed proper in re
erenee to the census, and to report a plan,
desist from saying more.
I recommend to your favorable conside
ration the claims of the Agricultural 15u
*eau for liberal appropriation-*. In a coun
ry so diversified in climate and soil as ours,
ind with a population so largely dependent
upon agriculture, the benefits that can be
:onforred l?y properly fostering this Bureau
e incalculable.
I desire respectfully to call the attention
'Congress to the inadequate -ala ries of a
Aluber of the most important officers of
te Government. In this message 1 will
ot enumerate them, hut will specify only
ic Justices of the .Supreme Court. No
?ange has been made in (heir salaries for
ftecr. }ears. Within thai time the labors
t the court have largely increased, and the
v pauses of living have at least doubled,
'uring the same time Congress has twice
iiind it necessary to increase largely the
nnpensation of its own members, au*J the
uty it owes to another department of the
overninenfc deserves, ami will doubtless
jcoive, due consideration.
CONCLUSION.
There are many subjects not alluded to in
lis message which might with propriety be
troduced, but [ abstain, believing that
uir patriotism and statesman-hip will sug
:st the tojiics and the legislation most con
ucive to the interests of the whole people,
n my part I promise a rigid adherence to
ic laws and their strict enforcement.

Washington, December 6,1800.
The opening scenes of the meeting of
Congress were to-day devoid of interest.
There wjls some bustle and confusion; but
comparatively fewer strangers ?\*ere present
than ever before on the occasion of the con
vening of Congress. The audiences In the
galleries were composed chiefly of citizens
of Washington.
The message was listened to with much
interest, but with no special demonstration
save a slight stir and murmur of applause
at the passage suggesting an act to convene
the Georgia Legislature, prohibiting mem
bers ineligible under the fourteenth amend
ment from taking their seats.
There was some little excitement in the
House over the reference of the credentials
of the Alabama members of Congress to the
Committee of Elections. As there were no
charges preferred against these members,
and no contestants of their seats appearing,
the proceeding was considered anomalous
and contrary to ail precedent.
The reference of the case of the Virginia
members to the Reconstruction Committee
excites alarm amongst some who desire in
stant admission of the State, but there is
nothing ominous in the movement. The
committee i> charged with the case of Vir
ginia with reference to her adoption of a
Republican State Constitution and* the elec
tion in proper manner of a Governor, State
Legislature, &c., and whether in what she
has done she has complied with the recon
struction acts; and they are instructed to
report a bill for the admission of the repre
sentatives of Virginia should they decide the
case favorably.
From the tenor of conversations with
Well-informed persons there is not the least
doubt that the committee will report a bill
for the admission of the Virginia represen
tatives in a few days, and scarcely a doubt
exists that senators and representatives of
Virginia will be in their seats within a
week or ten days. Both her senators were
to-day cordially received in the Senate, and
assurance* were given by Messrs. Mor
rill, Trumbull, and others, that they shall
be admitted to scats within a week.
There is a party here, however, making
an effort against the admission of the Vir
ginia representatives elect. That traitor to
the public peace and order Porter, of Rich
mond, openly avows his determination to
oppose their admission, and to memorialize
Congress to quash the late election in the
State and remit the whole matter to a new
election by the people, with the provision
that none who may be elected shall enter
upon the discharge of oflicial duty who can
not take the iron-clad oath, lie is the only
member of the Virginia delegation who op
pose her admission. All the others appear
eontident that the Virginia members will be
in their seats in a few days.
Senator Drake's bill, which substantially
proposes to set a-ide the act of Congress, is
laughed at by many of his own extreme
stripe. lie will probably receive the support.
>umncr and a few others, fanatics who
ace Congress above t lie Constitution ; but
3 bill will be defeated, il not only de
coys the Constitution, but murders the
big's English with equal ruthlessness.
The President's rne.-srge is the principal
?pic of conversation to-night. It meets
ith the general approval of Republicans,
at is not entirely satisfactory to a class of
atlieals who wanted Virginia rejected,
on-parti.sans and independent per-ons
nd some glaring inconsistences in the docu
icnt; for example, the proposed action
i to Georgia, the argument that there is no
: facto government in Cuba, and the posi
011 as to the Alabama claims treaty. On
ic la.-t point, while the President argues
rat England must lie held lor conse
ucntial damages for prematurely recog
izing the Southern Confederacy, he con
?des all the British Government claim
when lie says " this nation is its own judge
when to accord the right oi belligerency."
Many other iucousi-tencie.- are pointed
out. Their existence is accounted for by
the alleged fact that the message was pre
pared by several different parties. All in
relation to foreign affairs, however, was
prepared by the Secretary of State.

Washixgtox, December 0,1S69. ?
The reference of the admission of Vir
ginia to the Reconstruction Committee was
merely pro formo. Nearly ail the Republi
cans are said to be in favor of the imme
diate admission of the State. The commit
tee will probably soon report that the Con
stitution is republican in form, and that the
Mate should be admitted.
The principal points of Secretary Bout
weil's report are recommendations for a loan
j of twelve hundred millions in three classes,
! of four hundred millions each, the lirst pay
! able in fifteen or twenty years, the second
! in twenty or twenty-live years, and the third
| in thirty or thirty-live years; also, the ab
sorption of the three per cent, certificates,
which constitute the favorite reserves of the
national banks.
Governor Walker and many of the Vir
ginia delegation arrived here to-night.
