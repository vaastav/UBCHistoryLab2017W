Tho correspondent of tho New York

tho internal improvement schemes will
be pushed mainly by the inflationists,
and that tho two policies will (.land or
fall together. Tho inflationists, who

would command further Issues of green

Thoy expect also to get tho help of
those mcmbors whoso sections would

Such statements, like the tale of an

and unprofitable. They havo been
sounded in tho public car for a quarter
of a contury, and havo dono more harm
than good by .educating our pcoplo to

Kj nopals of the "Messagfe.
The following synopt's of the Presi
dent's message reached is through the
dailies of Tuesday morutig. It Is Im
perfect, embracing only tin more prom
inent features of the paper:
The message states that ur relations
with all foreign powers arefiieud!y and
without disturbance, thongi there is an
unsettled question with Vener.aela,
which has not yet paid the award of
the Joint Commission under the Con
vention of 18fM. Congress, U w'll be
recollected, strongly expreed iti sense
on (his subject la February 1S73. The
President, in his message of la,l De
comber, said there was reason to bo
lievo that the hesitancy of that Repub
lic iu recognizing the claims spung, in
part at least, from real ditllcultj in dis
charging them la connection with its
obligations to oilier governmuts, and
therefore the expediency of futner for
bearance on the part of our go eminent
was believed to be worthy oftne con
sideration of Congress. In addition to
Venezuela we have unsettled luestions
with Spain, growing out of Ik a flair of
the irgniius and other prevous trans
action on the pari or (lis S'nuli au
thoriiies in connection with events in
Cuba. The magnitude of tie offenses
has not been reduced sluce the Presi
dent's previous message a mrago. As
this unsettled condition C aflairs in
Cuba cannot long continue, it may be
come necessary for other nations, with
our own, to interfere to terminate the
insurrection which has so , ong prevail
ed, the Kpauioh governmeit having uii
successfully attempted to suppress it
Iu the meantime the coiunerco of all
countries, and especially that of tho
United States, suffers, tin flag of the
United Stales and Euglaiil having been
insulted. Tho Provident, in eoiivorsa
lion, although he does uot state tho fact
iu his message, says tho United States
purchase about eighty pc; cent, of the
Cuban exports, and therefore the duties
bv American citizens coiiribute to this
extent iu helping Spain t continue tho
war against the insurgent. 1 lie Prcsi
lent had hoped that by llo meeting of
Congress, tho present Defoliations with
Spam would havo been tndod, but in
this he bus been disippointcd. lie
therefore says in his message, little or
nothing about the indeiiuity pending
in iho negotiations, but some futuro
time will present the suljeet to the spe
cial consideration of Coigress.
The position of the President on the
financial question Is as fellows: He de
sires, and will recommend the resutnp
tion of specie payments at the earliest
practicable time, but he loes not believe
this can be reached as tton as the first
of January, 1870. lie doos not name
anv day, leaving It toOngtess to de
vise means to secure (lis desired end,
It being the duty or Coigress to do so.
The legal tender clauseof the currcr.cy
act should be repealed, to take effect as
to contracts mado arte tho day to be
fixed by law for its repeal. Power
should bo given to the Secretary of the
Treasury to obtain god, from and af
ter the date fixed for tie resumption of
specie payments, by the issuance of
bonds. In addition to this, the revenues
of (he government should belli excess
of (he expenditures.' To support the
resumption, groater economy must bo
practiced in nil departments of tho
Goverment, and if necessary, lie cus
touts and internal revenue laws changed
in order to secure a larger amount of
revenue. With the return of specie
payments banking should bo free; the
hillholders should continue to be pro
tectcd as at present under the banking
law. Thero should bo no limitation to
the volume of currency, as the com
munity itsolf should dotermiuo what
amount is required for business trans
actions, Instead of leaving the Ex-ecu
tivc, Secretary of Treasury and Con
gress, however, (o make regulations re
garding free banks of issue and to state
tlio conditions ou which they can be or
ganized and transact business, the log
i slat ion to bo iu accordance with the
new order of things, or in other words
the resumption of specie payments.

amend it so as to conform with i

mcnls. the 1 resident will make no
recommendations ou the subject of in
ternal improvements by the General
Government, but will merely refer to
tho fact that Congress has already ap
pointed a Commute ou Transportation
routes to the (he sea board, which has
already mado its report, and will givo
further information from more recont
nvestigations. The President devotes
much space to tho aflairs in Arkansas,
giving reasons why he declined (o on
terfere in the recent difllcultios iu that
State, nud he adverts to the facts nar-
ated in his special message to Congress,
'Vbruav, 1873, relativo to Louisiana, iu
which he said ho had no specific recom
mendation to make on the subject, but
if their were nnv practical way of re
moving these difficulties by legislation,
then ho nrtioslly requested that tho
question might bo taken up nt this ses
sion of Congress. Ho was extremely
anxious to avoid any pretense of unduo
intcforenco in Slate affairs, and if Con
gross differed with him, as to what
ought to be dono, he requested its im
mediate decision to I hat c fleet ; other
wise he should fool obliged, as far as ho
could, by tho exercise of legitimate au
thority, to put an end to the unhappy
controversy, which disturbed tho peaco
and prostrated the busiuoss of Louisiana
by the recognition and support of that
government which was recognized and
upheld by the courts of that State. It
seemed advisable that he should state
what c'ou rso ho should I'col bound to
pursno in reference to the matter in tho
event of no action being takeu by Con
gross at that timo, but subject to any
satisfactory arrangements that might
bo made by the parties to the contro
versies and which of all things was the
mostdosireablo, It would bo hli duty so
Tar as It might be necessary for him
to act to adhere to tho government
heretofore recognized by him. The
President again submits this ques
tion to Congress and will continue to
act as he has heretofore acted relative to
Iho aflairs In Louisiana unloss other

sanctioned by the people The Presi
dent alludes to the reports of the heads
of the several departments, which ac
company the message, and calls atten
tion to their respective recommenda
tions. He again recommends (he pas
sage of a law establishing a court for
the adjudication of the claims of aliens
against tho government, a bill for this
purpose having been introduced by
Judge Lawrence at the previous session
or congrets.
The President does not allude to Utah
affairs, the subject being left open for
future consideration. He calls atten
tion to the fact that Chinese immigrants
continue to be brought to this country
under (he condition of slaves, accord
ing to contract, and also whose charse-
ter is such as to demoralize the com
munitics in which they are located. He
invites legislation on this subject, sav

duty, (o enforce any law on the subject

Tho I'nwnt Congress.
The New York Herald savs of the
Congress now in Its last session
Thi body came into power with (he
second election of Grant, and repre
sents, the largest popular majority
we havo ever given to a represeu
sentative"body. It came flushed with
triumph, and it ends its career in dis
aster, l no country wlncn, iwo years
ago, called (his Congress into being
with such unexampled npproval, now
diMniasrs it as altogether unworthy
or eonliiienee and In no scna repesen-
talive or the wishes aud aims or tho
people. Many public men long promi
nent in the national aflairs go out with
it, some with honor, but more In dis
honor and disgrace. It Is the last year
of the old order of things, and of ne
cessity it is in somo degree preparatory
to tho new order which is coming. It
must work under disheartening Influ
ences, and it is not possible (hat it will
be able to regaiu in the few weeks of
the short session what it deliberately
threw away iu the many months of Its
previous deliberations. I lio handshak
ings of the leaders will bo sorrowful,
for they have only met to separate, and
they will never come together again.
The year 1875, like lS.jO, is to be an
epoch of new mon, and the men of tho
war, like tho champions and the foes
of the Missouri Compromise, give, place
to a new class of stalosmou, who, it is
to be hoped, will bring to their duties
sounder ideas and fresher thoughts.
Ohio.
The Ohio Legislature mot last week.
In his message Gov. Allen says:
Railroads are uot only of great utili
ty, but have becomo a necessity. 1 hey

and vexatious legislation, but as the ser
vants of tlio people, enjoying peculiar
franchises, thev should bo strictly
amenable (o judicious legislation, that
will prevent them from becoming (he
masters of the pcoplo. These rights
should bo fully protected by law, and
the rights of the people should be pro
tected against such encroachments as
tend to mako Ihem the victims of mo
nopoly. The Governor urges economy
in public aflairs, and closes with the fol
lowing words :
"It is a question tor your serious con
sideration, wether the compensation of
our county officers Is not disproportion
ate to the service of other public officers
aud of porsons iu private life. Public
servants spould not bo paid so high as
to make the getting of office a profes
sion and to enable candidates and appli
cants (o buy their way lo public places.'
The President's Message.
The New York Horatd says that the
message of Grant is a more creditable
document, in point of merit and literary
execution,' than Its predecessors, from
the same source. The President makes
it clear, that iu his view, the three prin
cipal causes which have led to the dis
astrous defeat of his party aro, tho pros
tration of business, the condition of the
Southern States, and the unsuccessful
experiment of reforming the civil ser
vice This is not diroutly slated, but it
is necessarily implied in tho texture of
his views on thoso subjects.

The Murder oo the Mountains.
Alt mont, Trx Dec, 3, 1871.
Dea Post I will rltt yoo a short
account of the terrible litgedy perpe
trated at Gructli, a small Swiss town
situated oo Cumberland mountain, and
four miles from this place. I-ast Mon
day ulght about 12 o'clock I was arous
ed from slumber by a Swiss at my door
lustily calling for "de Dogter". He in
formed mo that J. U. ttaor, a merchant
in Gruetli, was shot by two negroes and
desired me to come at once. I went im
mediately, found Haur lying in bed with
two gunshot wounds. His statement
to me was that he bad been railed to
his store door some time after 11 o'clock
that night, Ob opening and stepping
out he was fired on, as he said, by two
negroes standing directly in front of the
door about ten paces dii'aut. Ho re
treated into bis counting room, when
one of bis assassins followed him Into
:he store room to the money drawer and
was endeavoring to open it. There
were Iwo Swiss ladies in (he counting!
room at the time, to whom Raur re
marked thnt he was shot. As there
was no outlet to the connting rm ex
ce pi through the storeroom, Haur start
ed then out through the storeroom
where the assassin was stilt trying to
open the drawer, and was escaping
through the back door when he wa tir
ed on (he second (ime. He. however,
succeeded in arriving at a neighboring
house some fifty yards distant where he
fell. The assassins took flight without
the money, fearing no doubt that Haur
would get help aud comeback on them.
The first shot entered a little below
and (o ths right of the sternum or
breaft bone. This I probed for but
failed to find. , The second shot enter
ed his thigh, only penetrating some
Iwo or three inches, which was easily
extracted. The patient seemed to bo
suffering the most intense agony. A f ter
administering opiates I came back to
Altamout, at IJaur's request, lo send
him an Attorney to write Ids will.
Found Attorney's liouldin and Hamp
ton neither, one at borne, started my
horse and a hired boy on at ouce to Tra
cy City, 13 miles distant, after two dis
tinguished siiigeonsar.il an Attorney.
This about 3 o'clock Tuesday morning.
About daylight the same morning a
black masque was found near Paul's
store. At 11 o clock Drs. Parker and
Cocrhan arrived. They probed in vain
for the ball yet nnextracted. They left
him about noon in my care. About
seven o'clock Tuesday evening he be
gan to sink rapidly. I told him he bad
but a short time to live. Ho called his
friends to his bedside, convorsod freely
for some time, bid all farewell, and
died calmly and easily about 8 o'clock,
talking rationally almost with bis last
breath.
Next morning I was notified by the
Coroner's jury thnt they wished me (o
extract the other ball, which I did. It
had passed through the liver, cut the
intestines in three places and lodged in
the left kidney. All in our usually
quiet village are in a blaze of excite-
ment. Four arrests have been made,
vlz Goorgo Myer; Wm. H. Hampton,
Attorney of this place ; and two Purd-
bam Pros, from Tracy City. It lias
been proven that these four disreputa
blo characters were seen together Mon
day night. Their statements are conflict
ing. Have been sent to Tracy City to
a branch of the State prison for safe
keeping. Their trial will be here on the

negroes aro supposed lo be implicated
in the burning of the distillery and
other buildings, at Unionrown, several

had acknowledged his guilt, thero was
some doubt as to the guilt of the other
two. The action of tho mob did not
