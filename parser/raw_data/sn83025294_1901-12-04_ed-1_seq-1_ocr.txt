"Washington, Dee. 4.—Senator Bui rows

the exclusion and deportation of alien
anarchists." The first section of the bill
is as follows:
"That no alien anarchists shall here
after toe permitted to land at any port
of the United States, or toe permitted
in the United States; but tlhis prohibi
tion shall not be so construed as to apply

ers other than such anarchists."

The second section directs the special
board of inquiry authorized by the im
migration laws to make diligent Investi
gation concerning the antecedents of any
alien seeking admission into the United
States who is suspected of toeing an an
archist; authorizing the board to go even
to the extent of examining the persons
of suspected aliens for marks Indicative

persons to their native countries who

maining in this country will be a
menace to the government be may di
rect that In addition to the punishment
adjudged, the convicted alien after un
dergoing such punishment, shall be de
ported at the expense of the United
States to the country from which he
came, and if he returns to tho United

ment at hard labor for a period not ex
ceeding five years and afterward again

foreign countries concerning intended
Immigrants.
The sixth and last section of the bill
provides that the fact that an alien, has
declared his intention to become a citi
zen of the United States constitutes no
bar to proceedings against him under
this act.
WARM PRAISE FOR
THE PRESIDENT'S
FIRST MESSAGE
President Roosevelt's message to con
gress, which was widely read In Butte,
has been received with the utmost ap
preciation toy people of all classes and
creeds. The general concensus of opin
ion is that the document is a strong one
and will do much to draw supporters to
the republican standard.
Even men who disagree witlh President
Roosevelt politically on most subjects
declare that his stand on labor matters
is particularly pleasing, and that he has
made friends by the hundreds of thous
ands by reason of his utterances on vital
matters. *
Following are a few expressions con
cerning the message:
Judge William H. DeWitt, member of
the national committee for Montana—
Newspapers are in the habit of saying, •
"No one reads the president's message,"
hut the man who omits to read President
Roosevelt's message is losing an oppor
tunity to become a better American citi
zen. His treatment of every subject,
from the greatest corporation to the
humblest laborer, is on the plane of the
highest and most practical statesman
ship. The message is no "dry summary
of the year's business." It is the very
breath of the people's life. Look at
the treatment of the matters of special
local interest in this state, such as labor,
corporations, trusts, Chinese exclusion,
forestry and irrigation—a cabinet offi
cer of labor and industry—is there a
citizen of this state who Is not ready
to stand up and say, "Mr. President,
I am with you." When one reads such
a declaration of policy as this he won
ders why our friends, the democrats, do
not shut up their s>bp and come over to
us and say, "Well, boys, we are with
you on all these great state questions,
and we are going to quit pretending we
are not." Mr. Roosevelt is an all-around
president. He is equally at home wiith
the merchant marine and Rocky Moun
tain irrigation. The message ranks with
the greatest ever sent to congress.
Clinton H. Moore—I think the message I
of President Roosevelt is the best that
has been written by a president in years.
It is readable, sound and reflects the
views of the people admirably.
Gen. Chas. S. Warren—It is a first
rate message: the product of a vigorous
mind. It will be widely read and gen- 1
erally praised. I
J. E. Swindlehurst—As a democrat I !
admire the message. It is made up of I
the president's own views and the peo- !
pie like a message of that kind. Presl- !
dent Roosevelt is all right and his mes- !
sage will be greatly praised.
J. R. Wharton—I think the message !
is all right. It is just like President i
Roosevelt. It Is just what I expected. !
It shows that we have a man in the !
president's chair who fills his place and
commands by his ability the admira- >
tion of the people.
Dr. Murray—From the generat char- 1
•cter of the message I think there will j
be some who will not agree completely
with its contents. The anarchists, for
instance, may be expected to take ex
ception to some sections, and I don't
think the trusts will be entirely pleased.
It is, in my opinion, a noble message.
I like it.
William Scallon—It is a most compre
hensive state paper and will toe read with
deep interest and much pride toy the
American people. His interest in the
West is very gratifying and Will not fail
of having an important bearing on West
ern development.
Judge H. N. Blake—It is a most able
and dignified document. It is full of
practical ideas finely expressed and
gives a graphic description of the coun
try's industrial condition.
Col. C. F. Lloyd—It is the message of
a patriot, a soldier and a gentle
man.
J. R. Thompson—It was a great docu
ment. I read it all and was most
pleased with the discussion of irriga
tion, which means wonders for the West.
Street Commissioner John McLaughlin
—I think the president's message, or at
any rate, the most of it, is all right.
1 I was especially impressed with his sug
gestions on the Indian question. The
proposition of having the Chinese ex
clusion act continued is a good thing,
and the treatment of the labor and Ha
waiian cable questions suits me. 1 think
the president has given the people a
good message, and while there may be
those who differ with him with reference
to some policies I think the state paper
is being well received.
W. F. Scheffel —1 have r.ot read all of
the message of the president' but judg
ing from the parts of it that I have been
over I think we should be well satisfied
with it. The suggestions on the Chi
nese, the labor and the Hawaiian cable
questions are ail right. I think Presi
dent Roosevelt has made a general favor
able impression on the people with his
first message.
Hon. Lee Mantle—The message is just
what might be expected from a man of
the president's vigorous personality. His
pledge to carry out the policy of the
late President McKinley is admirably
kept as far as the message is concerned.
He has departed in no appreciable de
gree from the policy outlined by his pre
decessor, and he has expressed in a
vigorous way the views he holds. The
original and forceful manner in which
the president has set down his opinions
will meet with general approval. He has
made no departure from the formal
manner of presenting opinions upon pub
lic matters that will not be appreciated.
Clarence Smith—The portion of Presi
dent Roosevelt's message referring to
labor are especially pleasing.
Col. Samuel Harrison—There are many
j suggestions in the message that are
timely, and so far as labor is concerned
the president deserves a vote of thanks.
He is the first national executive who
has ever came out flat footed in favor of
organized labor.
Ray Smith—I have only glanced over
the message as yet, but it strikes me as
a particularly strong one.
PhM Daniels—I think the message of
the president is full of logic and in many
places it expresses my sentiment.
A. E. Spriggs—In my opinion the
message is a straightward document and
reflects credit on President Roosevelt.
Back From a Trip.
Dr. F. W. McCrimmon is back from
a trip to the coast. He spent two
weeks on his enjoyable trip and re
turns greatly Impressed with the growth
and enterprise of the Sound country.

CATTLEMEN MEET
SECOND DAY OF NATIONAL LIVE
STOCK CONVENTION.
IMPORTANT ADDRESSES MADE
Former Secretary of Agriculture Mor
ton Among Speakers—Bill for Pro
tection of Wool Growers Pro
posed—Other Matters.
(By Associated Press.)
Chicago, Dec. 4.—At the second session
of the convention of the National Liv I
Stock association this morning, Mr. F.
G. Hagenbarth of Idaho read a paper
on the "Adulteration of Wool." He sail
that such adulteration deprived the
wool growers of much markets and was
therefore a material injury to his in
terests.
He urged the passage by congress of a
bill providing for the inspection of
woolen goods and shoddy and proper
stamping of the same and heavy fines
for each violation of the law by manu
facturers and dealers.
The Hon. Gifford Pinchot, government
forester, spoke of the "Grazing Problem
in the Forest Reserves." He said there
were certain places where the interests
harmfully affected by grazing in the
forest reserves were so overwhelmingly
great that grazing was out of the ques
tion, among the others the Bull Run
forest reserves in Oregon, and the re
serves in Southern California, but there
was a vast region in which nothing but
reasonable regulation was required to
meet the grazing business and to dem
onstrate that it might always, as it al
ways should be, a help and not a hin
drance to every other interest in the
community.
Paper by J. Sterling Morton.
The Hon. J. Sterling Morton of Iowa,
read a paper entitled, "The Incon
sistency of the Grout Bill," which pro
vides for a tax upon butter and oleo
margarine. Prof. Thomas Shaw of the
University of Minnesota, discussed the
"Dual Cow," of the cow bred and fed
for her milk and meat.
Prof. Davenport of the Illinois experi
ment station declared that the stock
was judged from too many viewpoints
and said a more general system of judg
ing should be used.
"What the livestock interests of tho
United States can reasonably expect of
congress," was the subject of an address
by Hon. William M. Springer of Wash
ington, D. C.
, What Cattleman Need Most.
« Washington is full of pigeon holes,"
sa»d the speaker, "and the pigeon holes
ere full of bills which are sleeping the
sleep which knows no awakening. If
you stockmen want to work measures
through, get to work, get a stenographer,
a typewriter and a press bureau and
send your 'best men there. If you want
your particular bill considered you must
get behind and push—push hard."
Dr. D. E. Salmon, chief of the bu
reau of animal industry, spoke of "fed
eral inspection for interstate shipments
of livestock."
C. A. Prouty, a member of the inter
state commerce commission, was ap
plauded when his name was announced.
His subject was "Needed changes in
the interstate commerce laws." He said
the commission had been referred to as
the 'judicial it." The present inter
state commerce laws should be wiped
off the state and new ones enacted.
New Interstate Commerce Law.
"The time Is fast coming," the speaker
declared, impressively, "when there will
be no competition between railroads.
The cost of bringing a steak from Texas
"to Vermont is now only about one cent
a pound. This is due to competition
among the railroads.
"This competition you cattlemen should
-try to promote. What is the purpose of
these railroad combinations? To make
money. It is not the reduction in operat
ing expenses whereby the roads expect
to increase their dividends. It is by
forcing more freight money from the
public."

Japanese vessels be declared e
under a clause of the tariff, ext,
vessels of all nations entitled
vored treatment. The Russian u ^ it
officers decided the case in Japan's ia
vor, and the next Japanese steamship
to enter paid only the usual charges.
According to dispatches received at
Yokohama, a number of American ves
sels were required to pay the new ton
nage duties at the same time. It vas
expected that the money would be re
turned and American steamers placed
on the same footing as those of Japan.

/REPORT ON CANAL
ISTHMIAN COMMISSION FAVORS
NICARAGUA ROUTE.
MANY ADVANTAGES SET FORTH
Great Waterway Would Be Nearly 184
Miles Long, Would Cost $189,834,
062 to Construct and Six
Years to Build.
(By Associated Press.)
Washington, Dec. 4.—The report of tha
Isthmian canal commission was sent
to congress today. The commission, as
anticipated several weeks ago, favors
the Nicaraguan route, and makes an
estimate of $189,S64,062, as th total cos»
of construction of the canal through
Nicaragua.
The estimated cost of the Panama
route is $144,233,358, but the report sayS
it would cost $109,141,000 to obtain tha
Panama concession. The commission
\ allies the work done at $40,000,000.
Tile report says the Panama route 13
feasible as a sea level canal, while tha
Nicaraguan route must be by locks, but
Lake Nicaragua will furnish an inex
haustible supply of water for th : canal,
The Nicaragua route has not natural
harbors at either end but satisfactory
harbors may be constructed.
Could Be Built in Six Years.
Harbors already exist at each end of
the Panama route but considerable
work must be done at the entrance of
the harbor on the Atlantic side. With'
adequate force and plant, the commis
sion estimates that the Nicaragua canal
can completed in six years, exclusive of
two years for preparation. Ten years 13
estimated to complete the Panam»
canal.
The total length of the Nicaragua
route is 183.66 miles and the Panama
route 49.09 miles. The estimated cost of
operating and maintaining the Nica
ragua canal annually is $1,350,001 greater
than that of the Panama canal.
The estimated time for a deep draught
vessel to pass through the Panama
canal is 12 hours, and through Nicara
gua canal 33 hours. The Nicaragua
route, the report says, is more advanta
gious for commerce, save that, origina
ting on the west coast of South America.
Better for Sailing Vessels.
BETER FOR Saling Vessels........
For the gulf ports the advantage is
two days and for most of the ports on
the Atlantic and Pacific one day. The
Nicaragua route is said to be bitter for
sailing vessels on account of favoring
