CITY OF DOVER. ENGLAND,
THROWN INTO EXCITEMENT
By Attempted Attack on Harbor
Works by German Submarines.
Dover, England. Dec. 10, via London,
Dee. 11, 2.15 a. m. The city of Dover
was thrown- into excitement today by
the announcement that Germans early
this morning attempted a submarine
attack on the- harbor works and the
fleet at anchor in the harbor. .
The night was very dark and a
heavy rain and haze made searchlight
work difficult. Fortunatelv the forts
were put on the alert about. 4 o'clock
this morning by the appearance off
the harbor entrance of an unidentified
steamer which refused to stop until
a shot was fired across her bow.
The vessel then retired; She is be
lieved to have been the tender of the
submarines. . -
Half an hour later, it is said, a single
submarine was sighted and one of the
heavy guns in the harbor was fired
at her. This submarine, which evi
dently was the advance scout, disap
peared, but at half past six the ob
servers sighted what they believed .to
be a fleet of about six submarines sev
eral miles out in the channel.
' The channel forts commenced firing
in the direction of the supposed ma
rines and kept it up for almost half
an hour. At the same time a torpedo
boat destroyer flotilla put to sea, where
it remained all day.
Large1 crowds gathered on the wa
ter in the early morning hours and
watched the searchlights and the artil
lery Are. When they saw no results
of the shelling many (persons express
ed the opinion - that it was a false
alarm.
There is no official confirmation that
German submarines were seen. - - -

SAID NAVY IS POWERFUL
Declares When European War la Over
. the Countries Involved Will Be Bur
dened with Debt and That There
Will Be a Revulsion Against War.

paredness of the nation continued to
day as the dominant subject of con
gressional attention. While Secretary
Daniels was before . the house naval
affairs committee advocating his two
battleships a year construction pro
gramme and declaring that the senti
ment of the people -of the United
States was against turning the coun
try into a great military power, a free-for-all
national defence debate occu
pied the house itself.
Daniels' Views.
Mr. Daniels, during an all-day ex
amination, said that this country al
ready had a powerful navy and tnat
while. "with abundant revenues" he
might favor the general board's four
battleship plan, he thought the de
partment's building programme ade
quate under the circumstances. Press
ed for an opinion as to tne world mil
itary situation at the close of the Eu
ropean war, the secretary predicted an
international conference on armament.
"When the European war is over,'
he said, "these countries will be so
exhausted in their resources and burd
ened with debt that there is going to
be a great revulsion against war in
all countries. I expect the revulsion
will be so great that we will have an
international conference on armament
more possible now than ever before
and that we will get some action by
which the navies of the world powers
will be used only to carry into exe
cution the agreements of the countries
reach.

the naval and military committees for
failure to summon before them form
er cabinet officials and other witness

tacklng -President Wilson's- statements
in his annual message, Mr. Gardner
said: "If war were to break out to
day it would be found our coast de-
fences have not sufficient ammunition
for an hour's fighting."
- ' Flood of Oratory.
This speech loosed a flood of oratory
on the House. Representative iltz
gerald of New York, replied briefly
and promised " to make a complete
statement later Which would make
notoriety-seeking ex-secretaries" less
anxious to discuss the national de
fence.

to use force, not for aggression, but
only for defense and had no idea of
invading Mexican territory or inter
fering with the right of the Mexican
people to settle their own disputes,
or violating Mexican sovereignty In
any way.
