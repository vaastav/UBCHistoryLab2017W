Further Legislation for Settlement and
Regulation of Railway Labor Dis

Washington, Dec. 5. The senate
and house met In joint session today
and henrd President Wilson's message.
which was as follows : '
Gentlemen of the Congress:
In fulfilling at this time the duty laid
upon me by the Constitution-of com
municating to you from time to time
Information of the state of the Union
and recommending to your considera
tion such legislative measures as may
be Judged necessary and expedient I
fthnll continue the practice, which I
hope hns been acceptable to you, of
leaving to the reports of the several
lieads of the executive departments the
elaboration of the detailed needs of
the public service and confine myself
to those matters of more general pub
lic policy with which It seems neces
sary and feasible to deal at the pres
ent session of the congress.
I realize the limitations of time un
der which you will necessarily act at
this session and shall make my sug
gestions as few as possible ; but there
were some thlng9 left undone at the
last session which there will now be
time to complete and which It seems
necessary In the Interest of the public
to do at once.
In the first place, It seems to me Im
peratively necessary that the earliest
possible consideration . and action
should be accorded the remaining
measures of the program of settle
ment and regulation which I had occa
sion to recommend to you nt the close
of youlast session In view of the pub
lic dangers disclosed by the unaccom
' modated difficulties which then existed,
nnd which still tmhnpplly continue to
exist, between the railroads of the
country and their locomotive engineers,
conductors, nnd trainmen.
,, Railway Troublea First.
I then recommended :
First, Immediate provision for the
enlargement and administrative reor
ganization of the Interstate commerce
commission along the lines embodied
In the bill recently passed by the house
of representatives and now awaiting
action by the senate; In order that the
commission may be enabled to deal
with the many great and various duties
now devolving upon It with a prompt
ness and thoroughness which are, with
Its present constitution and means of
action, practically impossible.
Second, the establishment of an
eight-hour day as the legal basis alike
of work and of wages In the employ
ment of all railway employees who are
actually engaged in the work of oper
ating trains in Interstate transporta
tion. X'llrd, the. authorization of the ap
pointment by the president of a small
' body of men to observe the actual re
sults In experience of the adoption of
the elght-hodr day in rnllway trans
.' portatlon alike for the men and for
the railroads.
Fourth, explicit approval by the con
gress of the consideration by the In
terstate commerce commission of an
Increase of freight rates to meet such
additional expenditures by the rail
roads as may have been rendered nec
essary by the adoption of the eight
hour day nnd which have not been off
set by administrative readjustments
and economies, should the facts dis
closed Justify the Increase.
Fifth, an amendment of the existing
federal statute which provides for the
mediation, conciliation, and arbitration
of such controversies as the present
by adding to it a provision that. In case
the methods of accommodation now
provided for should fall, a full public
investigation of the merits of every
such dispute shall be Instituted and
completed before a strike or lockout
may lawfully be attempted.
And,- sixth, the lodgment In the
hands of the executive of the power.
In case of military necessity, to take
control of such portions and such roll
ing stock of the railroads of the coun
try as may be required for military
use and to operate them for military
purposes, with authority to draft into
the military , service of the United
States such train crews nnd adminis
trative officials as the circumstances
require for their safe and efficient use.
Renews Hla Recommendations. ,
The second nnd third of these rec
ommendations the congress ipimediate
ly acted on : It established the eight
hour day as the legal basis of work
and wages In train service nnd It no
thorlzed the appointment of a com
mission to observe and report upon the
practical results, deeming these the
measures most immediately needed ;
Unusual Experience.

but It postponed actlou upon the other
suggestions until an opportunity should
be offered for a more deliberate con
sideration of them. The fourth rec
ommendation I do not deem it neces
sary to renew. The power of the In
terstate commerce commission tff grant
an Increase of rates on the ground re
ferred to Is indisputably clear and a
recommendation by the congress with
regard to such a matter might seem to
draw in question the scope of the com
mission's authority or its inclination to
do Justice when there is no reason to
doubt either.
The other suggestions the increase
In the interstate commerce commis
sion's membership and in its facilities
for performing Its manifold duties, the
provision for full public investigation
nnd assessment of industrial disputes,
nnd the grant to the executive of the
power to control nnd operate the rail
ways when necessary in time of war
or other like public necessity -I now
very earnestly renew.
The necessity for such legislation Is
manifest nnd pressing. Those who have
Intrusted us with the responsibility
nnd duty of serving and safeguarding
them in such matters would nnu n
hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to
act upon these grave matters or any
nnnpcpssnrv nosttionement of action
upon them.
Not only does the interstate com
merce commission now find it prnetl
cally impossible, with its present mem
bership and organization, to perform
Its great functions promptly and thor
oughly, but It Is not unlikely thnt It
may presently be found advisable to
add to its duties still others equally
heavy nnd exacting. It must first be
perfected as an administrative Instru
ment.
The country cannot and should not
consent to remain any longer exposed
to profound Industrial disturbances for
lack of additional menns of nrbltrn
tlon and conciliation which the con
gress can easily and promptly fapply.
And all will agree that there must be
no doubt as to the power of. the execu
tive to make Immediate and uninter
rupted use of the railroads for the con
centration of the military forces of the
nation wherever they are needed and
whenever they are needed.
This is a program of regulation, pre
vention and administrative efficiency
which argues Its own case in the mere
statement of it With regard to. one
of its Items, the Increase In the effi
ciency of the interstate commerce com
mission, the house of representatives
has already ncted; its action needs
only the concurrence of the senate.
For Control and Operation.
I would hesitate to recommend, nnd
I dare soy the congress would hesitate
to net upon the suggestion should I
make it, that any man in any occupa
, tlon should be obliged by law to con
tinue in nn employment which he de
sired to leave. To pass a law which
forbade or prevented the- Individual
workman to leave his work before re
ceiving the approval of society in do
ing so would be to adopt a new prin
ciple into our jurisprudence which I
tuke It for granted we are not prepared
to introduce. But the proposal that
the operation of the railways of the
country shall not be stopped or Inter
rupted by the concerted action of or
ganized bodies of men until a public1
investigation shall have been Instituted
which shall make the whole question
at issue plain for the Judgment of the
opinion of the nntion is not to propose
any such principle. It is. based upon
the very different principle that the con
certed action of powerful bodies of men
shall not be permitted to stop the in
dustrial processes of the nation, at any
rate before the nation shall have had
nn opportunity to acquaint Itself with
the merits of the case as between em
ployee and employer, time to form its
opinion upon an Impartial statement
of the merits, and opportunity to con
slder nil practicable means of conciUa
tlon or arbitration.
I can see nothing in that proposition
but the Justifiable safeguarding by so
ciety or the necessary processes of
its very life. There is nothing arbi
trary or unjust In it unless it be arbi
trarily and unjustly done. It can and
should be done with a full and scrupu
lous regard for the interests nnd liber
ties of all concerned as well ns for the
permanent interests of society itself.
Other Legislation Urged.
Three matters of capital Importance
await the action of the senate which
have alrendy been ncted upon by the
nouse ot representatives: the bill
which seeks to extend greater freedom
of combination to those engaged in pro
moting the foreign commerce of the
country thnn is now thought by some
to be legal under the terms of the lnws
against monopoly; the bill amending
the present organic law of Porto Rico ;
and the bill proposing a more thor
ough and systematic regulation of the
expenditure of money in elections, com
monly called the Corrupt Practices Act.
I need not labor my advice that these
measures be enacted hi to law. Their
urgency lies in the manifest circum
stances which render their adoption at
this time not only opportune but neces
sary. Even delay would seriously
Jeopard the 'interests of the country
and of the government. .

To Keep Lemons.
Lemons may be kept a long time
without becoming dry If put into n jar
of wnter with a lid. Change the water
once a week If the lemons are to be
kept long. When used they will be
found quite as firm and juicy as when
fresh.
To Prevent Thumb Sucking.
A cardboard cuff around the upper
arm will often prevent a child froni
sucking its thumb, a habit thnt is lin
ble to cause serious deformity of the
mouth, nose and teeth.
ulote the expenditure of money in elec
tions may seem to be less necessary
than the immediate enactment of the
other measure? to which I refer; be
cause at least two years will elapse
before nnotlver election in which fed
eral offices sre to be filled ; but it would
greatly relieve the public mind if this
Important matter were dealt with
while the circumstances and the dan
gers to the public morals of the pres
ent method of obtaining and spending
campaign funds stand clear under re
cent observation and the methods of
expenditure can be frankly studied In
the light of present experience ; and a
delay would have the further very, se
rious disadvantage of postponing ac
tion until another election was at hand
nnd some special object connected with
it might be thought to be in the mind
of those who urged it. Action can be
taken now with facts for guidance and
without suspicion c? partisan purpose.
I shall not argue at length the desir
ability of giving a freer hand in the
matter of combined and concerted ef
fort to those who shall undertake the
essential enterprise of building up our
export trade. That enterprise will
presently,- will immediately assume,
has indeed already assumed, a magni
tude unprecedented in our experience.
We have not the necessary instrumen
talities for its prosecution; it is
deemed to be doubtful whether they
could be created upon an adequate
scale under our present laws. We
should clear away all legal obstacles
and create a basis of undoubted law
for it which will give freedom without
permitting unregulated license. The
thing must be done now, because the
opportunity is here and may escape us
If we hesitate or delay.
Porto Rico's Needs.
The argument for the proposed
amendments of the organic law of Por
to Rico is brief and conclusive. The
present laws governing the island and
regulating the rights and privileges of
Its people are not just. We have cre
ated expectations of extended privi
lege which we have not satisfied.
There is uneasiness among the people
of the island and even a suspicious
doubt .with regard to our Intentions
concerning them which the adoption of
the pending measure would happily re
move. We do not doubt what we wish
to do in any essential particular. AVe
ought to do it at once.
There are other matters already ad
vanced to the stage of conference be
tween the two houses of which It Is
not necessary that I should speak.
Some practicable basis of agreement
concerning them will no doubt be found
and action taken upon them.
Inasmuch as this Is, gentlemen, prob
ably the last occasion I shall have to
address the Sixty-fourth congress, I
hope that you will permit me to say
with whnt genuine pleasure and satis
faction I have co-operated with you in
the many measures of constructive pot
Icy with which you have enriched the
legislative annals of the country. It
has been a privilege, to labor In such
company. I take the liberty of con
gratulating you upon the completion of
a record of rare sviceableness and
distinction.
Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite.
Instead of an ax nnd saw to remove
the tops of trees that atfe to be used
as masts in logging operations, dyna
mite is used to shoot oft the tops.
After the branches have been removed,
a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of
irons, to the point where it is neces
sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk
is usually about 12 inches in diame
ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna
mite cartridges, fastened end to end
like sausages, around the trunk at this
point, inserts a blasting cap with about
20 feet of fuse in one of these sticks,
lights the end of the fuse, and descends-
before the explosion takes
place. The tree top pumps Into the
air with the explosion and the trunk
is left ready for attaching the rigging
for dragging in and loading the logs.

The story of coats for this season
has reached its closing chapter with
the presentation of styles for midwin

of popular approval was too definite
early In the season to encourage any
radical new departures. Early models
showed a beautiful adaptation of de
sign to materials and were so excellent
that they could hardly be improved
upon, and there are no distinctly dif
ferent lines or details of construction
in the latest arrivals.

Where fur is used on cloth garments
it often appears in an nil-fur collar
with bands of fur to match bordering
cuffs of the material. Plain plush and
fur-fabrics make the warmest of
wraps, excepting those that are made
entirely of fur, and are of all things
most serviceable for midwinter wear.

cupful of sugar and add
two wc!I-beaten egg
yolks, add a cupful of
very strong coffee and half a teaspoon
ful of vanilla, then stir in two cupfuls
of flour, previously sifted with two

Good health is the natural heritage
of every individual. The wise person
will not be sick, for he persistently
heeds the laws of nature. Nature in
tends the human machinery to run
smoothly, without jolt or friction; and
when either from accident or ignor
ance, this delicate mechanism lacks
harmony, then pain, ill-health and con
sequent unhappiness result. Compen
sation is the law of life and once this
law is abused, the human body pays
high toll for the infringement. Why
not 6et the health habit?
WAYS WITH APPLES.
As apples are such common fruif
nnd Withal so wholesome it is well
to find a variety of
ways to serve them.
Here is another
kind of apple dum
pling: Make a rich
biscuit dough, roll
thin and cat Into
six-inch squares.
Into the center of
' each place three or
four thin slices of good cooking apples
and fold the dough around them form
ing a ball. Arrange these-balls In a
deep baking dish, cover with a cupful
of brown sugar, a cupful of boiling
water and two tablespoonfuls of but
ter; bake in a slow oven for an hour.
Apple Omelet. Stew six large ap
ples. Beat very smooth while hot,
adding one tablespoonful of butter,
six tablespoonfuls of sugar, a grating
of 'nutmeg and a half teaspoonful of
rose extract. When entirely cold add
four eggs, benten very light, first add
ing the yolks, then folding In the
whites, put into a deep dish which has
been warmed and buttered. Bake In
a moderate oven to a delicate brown.
Apples Cooked With Pork Roast.
Core and peel a half dozen medium
sized apples, stuff with bread crumbs
and raisins, finely chopped, and place
around the rost; basting the apples
when the meat is basted will give them
a fine brown color and good flavor.
Serve as a garnish to the, pork roast.

teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful
of melted butter and a teaspoonful or
two of lemon juice, unless the apples
are very tart. Stir well and add three
fourths of a cupful of crumbs, let
stand until they have absorbed all the
juice, then pour into a baked shell
and cover with a meringue or with
a sprinkling of brown sugar. Set In
the oven until the sugar is melted to a
brown caramel.
French Operas.
The earliest operas In France were
composed by Lulll at the end of the
seventeenth century and Rameau at
the beginning of the "eighteenth cen
tury, but they were little more than
imitations of the Italian style. The
basis of the French opera was laid by
Gluck in the latter half of the eight
eenth century. Meyerbeer, Rossini,
Gounod and Thomas represent the
most popular of the successors . of
Gluck, with the more modern Massenet
nnd Carnentier.

LESSON FOR DECEMBER 10
FAITH r'UL UNTO DEATH.
LESSON TEXT Rev. 2:1-17.
GOLDEN TEXT Be thou faithful unto
death, and I will give thee the crown of
life. Rev. 2:10.
This passage most wonderfully illus
trates that dominating purpose or
Paul's life. More than uiost lessons
a map will be necessary to locate dis
tinctly the places mentioned. There
are interesting stories in connection
with each of .the seven cities and
churches. It might be wise to give to
seven different people the task of bring
ing information to the class regard-
each one mentioned.
Epbesus, whose love is waning
(w. 1-7). The key word to these mes
sages is the word "overcorneth." In
each of the messages our Lord de
scribes himself in a different way ac
cording to the peculiar needs of that
l-articular church. Here he is repre
sented as holding the stars (messen- -
gers of the churches, Ch. 1:20) in his
right hand, and keeping them secure,
controlling them while he walks in the
midst of the seven golden lamp stands,
literally churches. The symbolism of
lamp stand" is used because the
churches were intended to be light
bearers as they held forth the light
given by the oil of the Spirit (Math. .
5 :iG ; Phil. 2 :16 ; Zech. 4 :2-6). Ephesus.
was the capital of a province said to
be one of the richest in the Roman em
pire. In it was the great temple or
Diana. Here Paul had labored and
had various experiences, and to Ephesus
he had written a letter (See lesson 8,
third quarter), but there were good
things to be found in this Ephesian.
church (vv. 2,3). Forty years after be
ing founded, John writes this message.
He knew their "works," their general
moral conduct, especially its active and
passive sides through its trials, its
dealing with impostors and its prac
tical energy and enterprise ; and its pa
tience (literally steadfast assurance)
in bearing witness for Christ. Jesus
knew of their never wearying endur
ance. Surely these things would indi-
Jesus says, "No, there Is something
seriously wrong," so seriously wrong
that unless repented of he would re
move them out of the.ir place.
1 1. Smyrna, the church with a crown
of life(vv. 8-11). Smyrna was 40 or 50
miles from Ephesus, and nt this time
a city of 250,000 inhabitants. To this
church the Son of Man (Ch. 1:11)
sends another message. It is interest
ing to note that this church and the
one at Philadelphia received from the
Master unqualified praise. It had
works, activities; it also had tribula
tions, riches and poverty (for thou art
rich) rich in good works, rich toward.
God, rich in treasures laid up In?
heaven ; however, it was in the midst
of persecution. It was here thai Polyj
carp labored, who afterward, as bishop
of Smyrna, was martyred (see v. 10).
o Polycarp it Is said, that rather, than
save his. life by renouncing Christ he
cried out, "Eighty and six years have I
served him, and he has done me no in ;
how then . can I blaspheme my king,
who hath saved me." The crown isr
eternal life, the crown of victory. The
second death is the final condemna
tion which sinners undergo at the judg
ment seat of God. The first death is,
on the other hand, the natural one.
There was great hardship just ahead
for this church. These hardships pa
tiently and loyally endured would bring
the crown mentioned.
There are doubtless great persecu
tions just ahead for believers of 'the
present day, but we should not judge
them but rather rejoice In them, since,,
patiently endured, they will bring to
us a crown and a throne (Math. 5:10
12; II Tim. 2:12).
III. Pergamos, the church in a strong
hold of faith (vv. 12-17). Our glorified
Lord knew that the church in Pergamos
was in a peculiarly difficult . situation,
that It was Satan's headquarters, his
"throne" (v. 13) ; hence, they were in
especial need of a defender and the
Lord is represented as "he that hath
a sharp, two-edged sword," the word
of God (Heb. 4 :12-13 ; John 5 :22). ' Per
gamos was almost fifty miles north ot
Smyrna, a city of about 17,000 inhabi
tants, and the capital of the province.
To it were brought many of the early
Christians who were compelled to suf
fer martyrdom. Again we have a
church whose works are commended,
whose steadfastness is mentioned in.
that they "held fast to my name, and
not denied the fnith" martyrs (w.
13). However, dangers threatened
them for there had been a compromise
with the world and with other sys
tems of faith, what we would call to
day liberality in doctrine and breadth
in view in teaching : (1) Some of their
number had accepted and practiced
the doctrine of Baalim (Jude 11; Num.
31-16). (2) These teachings cast a
stumbling block before the children of
Israel (v. 14). This was done by per
suading the Israelites to join in the
idolatrous feasts aid revelings of the
heathen, and also their impurity of
worship. (3) Some ot them had held
to the teaching of the Nicolaitans re-,
ferred to under the admonition at
Ephesus. These taught that the flesh
had no port in the divine life, and
might be regarded as something in
different; in other words ethical per
fection wns in the spirit ; the body
might indulge in whatever sins it saw
fit. . .
This kind of teaching the Lord Jesus
hates.
The one way of salvation was for
them to repent for the Lord would
raise up faithful and true prophets
who would wield his sword effectual
ly against such monstrous forms of er
ror, which were warring against the
truth.
In the remaining part of the chapter
we have some glimpses of the remain
ing four churches, the good that wis
to be cherished and the evil that was
to be overcome.
Perhaps the most suggestive of all is
that of Laodicea, the lukewarm
church. .
Lukewarmness is one of the most
deadlv evils to overcome, nml. humu
the highest and most glorious of all
the promises suggested ends with "I
will give him to sit down with me in,
my throna as I also overcame and sat
down with my father in his throne
(Am. II, V.).
