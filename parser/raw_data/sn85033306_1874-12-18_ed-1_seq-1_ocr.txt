PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
To the Senate ami Howe of Aepnaen'atires :
Since the convening of congress one
year ago, the nation has undergone a
prostration in business and industries
such as has not been witnessed with us
for many years. Speculation as to the
causes for this prostration might be in-
uuigea m, witnout protit, because as
many theories would be advanced aa
there would be independent writers,
those who expressed their own views
wunout a neanng upon the subject.
Without indulziner in theories as to th
cause of this prostration, I will only
call your attention to the fact, and to
one question as to which it would eeem
there" 6hould be no disagreement. Dur
ing this prostration
TWO ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
of prosperity have been most abundant
labor and capital. Both have been
largely unemployed.. "Where, the se
curity has been undonbted, capital has
Deen attainable at very moderate rates.
Where labor has been wanted, it has
been found in abundance at cheap rates
compared witu what of the necessities
and comforts of life should be pur
chased with the wages demanded. Two
great elements of prosperity, therefore,
have not been denied us. A third might
be added. Our soil and climate are
tmequaled within the limits of any
contiguous territory, under one nation
ality, for its varieties of products to
feed and clothe . a people, and in the
amount of surplus to spare to feed less
favored people. Therefore, with these
facts in view, it seems to me that wise
statesmanship at this session of con
gress would dictate ignoring the past,
and directing in proper channels these
great elements of prosperity to . any
people. Our debt abroad is the, only
element that can, with always a sound
currency, enter into our affairs to cause
any continued depression in the indus
tries and prosperity of our people. .
. OBIGIN OP GREENBACKS.
. A great conflict for national existence
made neoessary for temporary purposes
is the raising of a large sum of money
from whatever source attainable. It
may have been necessary in the wisdom
of congress, and I do not doubt their
wisdom in the premises regarding . the
necessity of the times, to devise a sys
tem of currency, which it proved to be
impossible to keep on a par with the
recognized currency of the civilized
world. This begat a spirit of specula
tion, involving an extravagance and lux
ury not required for the happinees or
prosperity of a people, and involving
both directly and indirectly foreign in
debtedness. This currency being of a
fluctuating value and, therefore, unsafe
to hold for legitimate transactions re
quiring money, became a tubject cf
speculation in itself.
These two causes, however, have in
volved us in a foreign indebtedness,
contracted in good faith by borrower
and lender, which should be paid in
coin, and according to the bond agreed
upon when the debt was contracted,
gold or its equivalent. The good faith
of the government cauriofc be violated
toward creditors without ' national dis
grace. Our commerce should be en
couraged, American f-hipbuilding and
carrying increased, and foreign jnarkts
sought for the products of the soil and
manufactures, to the end that we may
be able to pay these debts. Where a
market can be created for the sale of
our products, either of the soil, the
mine or the manufactory, a new means
is discovered of utilizing our idle capi
tal and labor, to the advantage of the
whole people.
GOLD SEEKS ITS LEVEL.
In my judgment the first step " to
ward this object is to secure a currency
good wherever civilization reipns, one
which, if it becomes superabundant
with one people, will find a market with
some other ; a currency which has as its
basis the labor necessary to produce it,
which win give it value. Gold and
silver are now the recognized medium
of exchange the world over, and to this
we should return with the least prac
ticable delay. In view of the pledges
of the American congress when our
present legal tender system was adopted
and debt contracted, there Rhould be
no delay, certainly no unnecessary de
lay, in fixing by legislation a method
by which we will return to specie. To
the accomplishment of this end I invite
your special attention. I believe firmly
that there can be no prosperous and
permanent revival of business and in
dustries until a policy is adopted, with
legislation to carry it out, looking to a
return to the specie basis.
THE DEBTOB CLASS.
It is easy to conceive that the debtor
and speculative classes may think it of
value to them to make so called money
abundant, until they can throw a por
tion of their burdens on others. Bat
even these, I believe, would b disap
pointed in the result, if a course 6hould
be pursued which will keep in doubt
the value of the legal tender medium of
exchange, and delay the revival of pro
ductive industries needed by all classes,
by none more than by the holders of
property, of whatever sort, with debts
to liquidate for realization upon its
sales. But admitting that these two
classes of citizens are to be benefitted
by expansion, would it be honest to
give it ? Would not the general loss be
too great to justify such relief ? Would
it not be as honest and prudent to au
thorize each debtor to issue his own
legal tenders to the extent of his liabili
ties ? Than to do this would it not be
safer, for fear of over-issues by unscru-
fmlous debtors, to fay that all debt ob
i gat ions are obliterated in the United
States, and now we commence ant w,
each possessing all he has at the time
free from incumbrance?
DELAY DISHONEST.
These propositions are too absurd to
be entertained for a moment by a think
ing people. Every delay in the pre
paration for final resumption partakes
of this dishonesty, and is only less in
degree aa the hpe is held out that a
convenient season will at last arrive for
the good work of redeeming our pledges
to commerce. It - will - never come,
in my opinion, except by positive action
by congress, or by national disasters,
which will det-troy for a time at least,
the credit of individuals and the state
at large, when a sound currency would
be reached by total bankruptcy of the
redit and integrity of the nation and
individuals. I believe it is in the pow
er of congress at this session, to
devise such legislation as will re
store confidence, revive all the indus
tries, start ua on the cireer of
prosperity, and to save the credit of the
nation and the people. Steps toward
the return to a specie bal are steps to
this end devoutly to be sought fur, and
there are others which I may touch on
hereafter.
" A BONrSTO FOREIGNERS.'
A nation dealing in a currency below
that of specia in value, labors under
two great advantages : First, . Laving
no use for the world's acknowledged
medium of exchange, gold and silver,
these are driven out of the country
because there is no demand for their
use. Secondly, the medium of exchange
being of a 11 a dating valne, for it is
only worta just what . it will purchase
pi gold ana . silver metals, having an
intrinsic value just in proportion to the
honest labor ie takes to produce them.
a large margin must be allowed for a
proht by the manufacturer and produ
cer. In the months from the date of
production to the date of realization,
interest upon capital must be charged.
and the risk of fluctation in the value
of that which is to be received in pay
ment added. Hence high prices act as
a protection to the foreign producer,
who receives nothinpr in exchange for
the product of his skill and labor, except
a currency good at a stable value the
world over. ,
THE POOR MAN BEARS THE BRUNT.
It Hpems to me that nothing is clearer
than that the greater part of the burden
of the existing prostration, for the want
of a sound financial system, falls upon
the workmgman, who must, after all,
produce the wealth, and the salaried
man who superintends and conducts the
business. The burden falls upon them
n two ways : By the deprivation of
employment, and by the decreased pur
chasing power of their salaries. It is
the csuty of congress to devise the
method of correcting the evils wnich
are acknowledged to. exist, and not
mine. But X will venture to suggest
two or"three things which seem to me
aa absolutely necessary to a return to
specie payments. -
REPEAL OF . THE LEGAL TENDER CLAUSE
URGED,
The first great requisite in a return to
prosperitv is, that the legal tender
clause to the law authorizing the issue
of currency by the national government.
should be repealed, to take effect, as to
all contracts entered into aftei a day
fixed in the repealing act, not to apply,
however, to the payments of salaries by
tho government, or other expenses now
provided by law to be paid in currency.
In the interval and pending between re
peal and final resumption, provision
should be made by which the secretary
of the treasury can obtain gold as it
may become necessary, from time to
time, from the date when specie resump
tion commenced. To this might and
should be added a revenue sufficiently
in excess of expenses to insure an accu
mulation of gold in the treasury to sus
tain redemption. I commend this sub
ject to your careful consideration, be
lieving that a favorable solution is at
tainable, and that if reached by this
congress, present and future generations
will ever gratefully remember it as their
deliverer from a thraldom of toil and
disgrace.
FREE BANKING ESSENTIAL.
With resumption free banking may be
authorized with safety, giving full pro
tection to bill-holders which they have
nnder exiting laws. Indeed, I would
regard free banking essential. It would
give proper elasticity to the currency.
As more currency should be required
for the transaction of legitimate busi
ness, new banks would be started and in
turn banks would wind up their busi
ness when it was found there was a su
perabundance of currency. The expe
rience and indc:ment of the people can
best decide just how much currency is
required fot the transaction of the busi
ness of the country. It is unsafe to
eave tho settlement of this question to
congress, the secretary of the treasury
or the executive. Congress should
make the regulation under which banks
may exist, bnt should not make banking
a monopoly by limiting the amount of
redeemable paper currency that shall be
authorized. Such importance do I at
tach to this subject and so earnestly do
I commend it to your attention, that I
give it prominence by introducing it at
the beginning of this message.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Daring the past year nothing has oc-
cuired to disturb the general, friendly
and cordial relations of the United
States with olher powers. The corres
pondence submitted herewith between
this government and its diplomatic rep
resentatives in other countries, snow a
satisfactory condition of all questions
between the United States and tne most
of those countries, and, with a few ex
ceptions, to which reference is hereafter
made, the absence of any points of dif
ference to be adjusted.
BELGIUM.
The notice directed bv the resolution
of congress of June 18, 1874, to be
given to terminate the convention of
July 17, 1858, between the United States
and Belgium, has been given, and the
treaty will accordingly terminate on the
first day of July, 1875. This conven
tion secured to certain Belgium vessels
entering the ports of the United States,
exceptional privileges which are not ac
corded to our own vessels. Other feat
ures of the convention have proved sat
isfactory, and have tended to the culti
vation of the mutually beneficial com
mercial intercourse and friendly relar
tions between the two countries. I hope
tbat the negotiations which have been
instituted will result in the celebrating
of another treaty which may tend to the
interests of both countries.
china.
Our relations with China continue to
be friendly. During the past year fear
of hostilities between China and Japan,
growing out of the landing of an armed
force upon the island of Formosa by
the latter, has occasioned uneasiness.
It is earnestly hoped, however, the dif
faculties arisiDg from this cause will be
adjosted, and that the advance of civili
zation in those empires may not be re
tarded by a state of war.
In consequence of the part taken by
certain citizens of the United States in
this expedition, our representatives in
those countries have been instructed to
impress upon the governments cf China
and Japan the firm intention of this
country to maintain strict neutrality in
the event of hostilities, and carefully
prevent any infraction of law on the
part of our citizens.
AH-srv.
In connection with this subject, I call
the attention of congress to a generally
known fact that the great proportion of
Chinese emigrants who come to our
shores do not come voluntarily to make
their homes with us and their labor
productive of the general prosperity,
bnt come under contract with head men,
who own them almost absolutely. In a
worse form does this apply to tha Chi
nese wemen. Hardly a perceptible
percentage of them perform any honor
able labor, but they are brought here
for shameful purposos, to the disgrace
o the communities where they settle,
and to the great demoralization of the
youth of thee local ties. If this bad
practice can be legislated against, it
will be my pleasure a well as my duty,
to en force any regulation to r-ecure eo
desirable an end.
J AT AW.
It is hoped that negotiatior between
the government cf Japan wad other
i
! nowers. looking to tb further nwninn
' ' c? i
of the empire ana the removal of vr
rioas restrictions upon trade and travel.
mav soon prod 'ica the results desired.
which ctsnnot fa 1 to enure to the bene
fit of all parties.
Having on previous occasions, sub
mitted to the con6id ration of congress.
the propriety of the release of the
Japanese government from further pay
ment of the indemnity and the conven
tion of Oct. 22, 1S64, under as no action
had been taken therein, it became my
duty to regard the obligation cf the
convention as m force, and as the other
powers interested have received their
portion of the indemnity in full, the
minister of the United Stated has beD
notified and this government received
the remainder due to the United States
under the convention of Simousky. I
submit the propriety of applying the
income of a part, if not the whole of
the fund, to the edncation, m the Jap
anese language, cf a number of youDg
men, to be under obligations to serve
the government for a specified time as
interpreters at the legation and the
consulates at Japan. A limited num
ber of Japanese youths might, at the
same time, be educated in our vernacu
lar, and would result in benefit to toth
governments. The importance of hav
ing our citizens competent and familiar
with the language of Japan, to act as
interpreters and in other capacities con
nected with the legation and consulate
in that conntry, cannot be readily over
estimated.
GREAT BRITAIN.
The amom t awarded to the govern
ment of Great Britain by the mixed
commission organized under the acts cf
the treatise of Washington, in settle
ment of the claims cf British subjects
arising from acts committed between
April 18. 1841, and April 9, 1865, be
came practicable under the terms of the
tieaty within the past year, and was
paid upon the 21st day of September,
1874.
OTHER CLAIMS AGAINST US.
In this connection I renew my recom
mendation made at the opening of the
last session of congress, that a special
court be created to hear and determine
all claims of aliens against the Untied
States arising from acts committed
against their persons or property dunug
the insurrection. It appears equitable
that an opportunity 6hould be offered
for the persons of other states to pre
sent their claims as well as to those
British subjects whose claims were not
admissably under tha late commission,
to the early decision of a competent
tribunal, and I recommend the necessa
ry legislation to organize a court to dis
pose of those claims oi aliens who are
referred to, in an equitable and satis
factory manner, and to relieve congress
and the departments from the consider
ation of these questinps.
TFH riSHJiRlES.
The legislation necessary to extend to
the fisheries of New Fonndland certain
articles of the treatv of Washington of
8th day of May, 1871, having been had,
a protocol to that effect was suggested
in behalf of the United States and
Great Britian on the 2Sth day of May
ast, and was dnly proclaimed on the
following day. A copy of the procla
mation is submitted Herewith.
OUR NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY.
A copy of the report of the commis
sion appointed under the act of March
19. 1872. for surveying and makmg the
boundary between the United States
and the ISritisn possessions, irom tne
Lake of the Woods to the sammit of
he B-ckv Mountains, ia herewith
transmitted. I am happy to announce
that the field woik of commission lias
been completed, and the entire line
from the northwest corner of the Liake
of the Woods to the summit of the
llocky Mountains has been run and
marked upon the surlace ol tne eartu.
It is believed that the amount remain
ing unexpended of the appropriation
made at the last session of congress
will be sufSoient to complete the work.
I recommend that the authority of con
eress be given for the use of the unex
pended balance of the appropriatioa in
the completion of the work or the com
mission and making a report and print
ing the necessary map.
AMERICAN CLAIMANTS OF DAMAGES BT THE
ALABAMA.
The court known as the court of oi m
missioners of Alabama claims, created
by an act of congress at the last sef-fiion,
has organized and commenced its work,
and it is to bo hoped that the claims ad
missable under the provisions of the cct
may be speedily administered.
TURKEY.
It has been deemed advisable to ex
ercise the discretion conferred upon the
executive, at last session, by accepting
the conditions required by the g vern
ment of Turkey for tho privilege of
allowing the citizens of the United
States to hold real estate in the former
country, and by assenting to a certain
change of the jurisdiction of the courts
in the latter. A copy of the proclama
tion upon these subjects is herewith
communicated. .
SPANISH AMERICA.
There has been no material change in
our relations with the independent
states on this hemisphere, which were
formerly under the dominance of Spain.
Marauding on the frontiers, between
Mexico aad Texas, still frequently take
place, despite the vigilance of the civil
and military authorities in that qnarU r.
The difficulty of checking such trepasses
alocg the course cf a river of such
length as the Rio Grande, and so often
fordable, is obvions. It is hoped that
the effort of this government will be
seconded by those of Mexico to the
effectual suppression of acts of wrong.
MEXICAN CLAIMS.
From a repoi t upon the condition of
the business before the American and
Mexican joint claims commifpion, made
by the agent of the United States, and
dated Oct. 28, 1874, it appears that of
the 1,107 claims filed on the part of the
citizens of the United States, 483 had
been finally decided, and 75 were in the
hands of the umpire, leaving 460 to be
disposed of ; and of the 8i8 claims
filed egaimt the United States, 723 had
been finally decided on, one was b fore
the empire, and 271 remain to be dis
posed of. Since the date of each re
port, other claim have been disposed
of, reducing somewhat the number still
pending, and others have been passed
upo:a by the arbitrators. It has become
apparent, in view of these figures and
of the fact that the work devolving on
the umpire is particnlarlyi laborious,
the commission would be unable to dis
pose of the entire number of claims
pending prior to the first day of Febru
a y, 1875. the date fixed for the expira
tion, negotiationa, are pending lookiog
to the stenring cf the results of the
decisions which have been received and
to a further extension of the commi'--sioD
for a limited time, which it is con
fidently hoped will euflioe to bring all
the business now before it to a final
clone, i ...
AKOI5TXNE. . ....
TLe Etrifa ia tha Argentine republic ia
to be deplored, both on account of the
parties thereto and from the probable
effects on the interests of thope1 in the
trade in that quarter, of whom the Uoi
ted States are among the principal. ""Af
yet, so far as I am aware, there has been
no violation of cur neutrality rights,
which, as well as our duties in that res
pect, it eh all be my endeavor to main
tain and observe.
VENEZUELA. - " .
It is with regret that I announce that
no further payment has been received
from the government of. "Venezuela on
account of awards in favor of the citi
zens of the United States. Hopes have
been entertained that, if the' republic
could escape both foreign and civil war
for a few years, its great natural re
sources would ei able it to honor its ob
ligations. Though it is now understood
to be at peace with other conntriea, a
serious insurrection is reported to be in
progress in an important region of tha"
republic. This may be taken advan
tage of as another reason to delay the
payment of the dn of our citizens.
CUBA.
The deplorable strife in . Cuba contin
ues without any marked change in the
relative advantages of the contending
forces. The insurrection continues, but
Spain has pained no superiority. Six
years of strife give the insurrection a
significance which cannot be denied.
Its duration and the tenacity of its ad
herents, together with tne absence of a-J
manifesto i power of puppression on the
part of Spain, -cannot be controverted,
and may make fome positive steps on
the part of the other powers a matter of
self -necessity. ' . .
SPAIN.
I had confidently hoped at this time
to be able to announce the arrangement
of some of the important questions be
tween this government and that of
Spain, but the negotiations have been
protracted. The unhappy internal dis
sensions of Spain command our pro
found sympathy and must be accepted
as perhaps a cause of some delay. An
early settlement, in part at least, of the
questions between the governments is
hoped. In the meantime awaiting the
results of immediately pending negoti
ations, I defer a further and full com
munication on the subject of the rela
tions of this country and Spam.
THE RIGHT OF EXPATRIATION.
I have again to call the attention of
congress to the unsatisfactory condition
of the existing laws in reference to expa
triation and the election of nationally.
Formerly, amid conflicting opinions and
decisions, it was difficlut to exactly de
termine how far the doctrine of perpet
ual allegiance was applicable to citizens
of the United States. Congress by the
act of the 29th of July, 1868, asserted
the abstract right of expatriation as a
fundamental principle of the govern
ment. .Notwithstanding tuch assertion
and the necessity of frequent applica
tion of the principle, no legislation has
been had defining what acts or formali
ties shall work expatriation, or when a
citizen shall be deemed to have renoun
ced or to have lost his citizenship. The
importance of such definition isobvions.
The representatives of the United States
a foreign countries are continually
called upon to lend their aid and the
protection of the United abates to per
sons concerning the good faith or the
reality of whose citizenship thre is at
least great question. In fome cases the
provisions of the treaties furnish some
guide. In others, it seems left to the
persons claiming the benefit of citizen,
ship while living in a f reign country,
contributing in no manrer to the per
formance of the obligations and duties
of a citizen of the United States, simply
na a shield from the performance of the
obligations of a citizen elsewhere. The
status of children born of Ameri
can parents residing in a for
eign country, of American women who
Lave married aliens, and of American
citizens resiiiidg abroad, where such
question is not regulated by treatv.
are all sources of frequent, difil"uH
discussion. Legislation on these and
smaller questions, and particularly de
fining when and under what circum
stances expatriation can be accomplish
ed or is to bo pre sumed, is eppecially
needed.

each of these clam-es of frand are diricovered
at onr legislations where the certificates of nat
