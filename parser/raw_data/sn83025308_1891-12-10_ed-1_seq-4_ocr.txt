WELLESLEY IN ARMS.
What are the legitimate functions of
the college annual? Tell me, says the
s3panish proverb, with whom thou gooest, i
and I will toll thee who thou art. Tell I
us, we might burlesque the adage, the
critic's years, and we will tell you his
idea of the annual's scope. Is the critic
young and a collegian? Write down the
annual as the humble repository of
genius that will some day startle and
illuminate a drowsy world. Is the critic
old and soured? His verdict is a fore
gone conclusion. Such productions are
a waste of paper and printer's Ink-- a
waste-pipe for the escape of a flood of
irresponsible chatter and hair brained
frivolity. The critic is a mother with
her boys and girls at college? Bless
her kindly heart, her smiles are suffuli
oiont answer to any query on the sub
ject. The censor is an old collegian
himself, with the ballast of years of ex
perience laid on the top of his youthful
enthusiasm? lie, be sure, will admit
that the success of the literary effort in
volved is generally in the inverse ratio
to its ambition. lie will be forced to
admit that the pathos limps in passages,
that the research is but skin deep, andu
excised, at that, from the cuticle of
some older and more experienced
pcholar. But he cannot be brought to
deny that the annual is occasionally the
seed time of future literary success,
While his eyes will twinkle and his
nmouth broaden with a smile, as he
peruses an account of the pranks that
are as old as pupils, and recognizes the
hoary jokes that have dune duty for
scholastic wit since the days when
schools first were.
All of which leads up to the sad an
mouncement that civil war reigns in the
iUne peaceful halls of Wellesley, and
.th thue bone of coantmion is 4he col
iege annual for the' present.ear of
grate. On the one hand are arrayed the
well organized and e*perieaoed forces
of the faculty, skilled to mept and rout
all manner of opposition. On the othes
side are ranged the light infantry of the
students, the guerillas in college War
fare. Corridors, that used to ring with
the praises of this or that "quite too
lovely" instructress, have blanched at
the spiteful ejaculations of "mean old
cat," and "I'm sure she paints." Sweet
voices, that used to wail a chorus of
Agamemnon or babble a bon mot from
Moliere, have waxed harsh and raucous
in their denunciations of a tyrannical
faculty. Legends is the war-cry, for so
the modest maids of Wellesley have
denominated the annual production
that gives to a waiting world the first
fruits of their genius. Legenda, things
requiring or deserving to be read, so far
as the musty remnants of our Latin
grammar that survive will enable us to
read. Requiring to be read sounds like
the faculty, and deserving to be read
seems an echo from the maidens.
Either construction, we suppose, will
do. The cause of the strife? Well,
that is a matter of History and throws a
dark stain on the memory of the class of
'91. It is a terrible thing to say of any
group of students, male or female, that
in spite of their advantages, in spite of
Greek choruses, in spite of problems in
trigonometry, in spite of their knowl
edge of the duplicity of the ratio of sim
ilar triangles to their homologous sides,
that, in spite of their acquaintance with
these sobering facts and experiences,
they can actually retain a desire for in
nocent mirth aaid honest fun. Yet this
is the astounding accusation that must
be made against the class of '91. They
published an annual, a Wellesley annual.
It is incredible, but the thing was act
ually facetious. Male persons, it has
been reported to the faculty, had been
heard to guffaw over it, and the jokes,
unlike thoso of Aristophaues, had not
even the merit of being expressed in
Greek. Never again must the fair es
outcheon of Wellesley be dishonored by
the presence of a witticism in its an
nual. The very walls might fall.
Our interest in Wellesley is as great
as it is deserved We have been proud
of a college that could produce such ed
ucational results, proud of its faculty,
proud of its scholars. In the present
momentous crisis we hasten to tender
our quota of advice. We would say to
the honorable faculty: Your work is
good, is excellent as far as it goes. We
know none better. But there is one lack
in your equipment, one breach which
renders the whole most vulnerable.
That repaired no assaults can touch a
noble institution. You have chairs of
Greek, Latin, mathematics and a dozen
other subjects. You need a chair of
humor-for the faculty.
SRCRF.TAIe Y FosTiti disposes of the
Chinese isumigation question in a sen
tence, when ho says: "Any legislation
looking to exclusion will fail of its full
purpose so long as the Canadian govern
ment admits Chinese laborers to Can
ada, whence, armed with Canadian per
mits to leave and return to Canada at
pleasure, they are at lihberty to invade
our territory along its entire northern
frontier." Mr. Foster might have added
that it was quite improbable thatso long
as Canada can get head money from the
Chinese it will bar them out.
THE youngest man in congress has

that he would pack the coinage commit

P'trlini.entary Wages.
In Germany both houses receive about

rope dangling from a limb above. The fig
urea are not yet forgotten. A few weeks
ago a party of surveyors were working over
in Jefferson county and as usual were num
bering the stakes in order. It so happened
that a certain stake near a small camp was I
'numbered 8777. A ranchman near by
reached the party just as the stake was
passed but caught the number.
"What in the devil do you mean by
that," he asked pointing to the figures.
"That's only the number," said one.
"Well, do you want to drive all the boys
out of the camp?"
The old man then was obliged to explain
to these newcomers that the figures 3777
would cause some excitement in rny camp
and might depopulate it. In the interest
of the local community they therefore
changed the figures to avoid the possibility
of a stampede.
Mr. James U. Sanders read all that was

Yesterday afternoon there was a small
crowd of street travelers before the plate
glass front of a big down town store.
Among them were a judge of the
supreme court, two well known gamblers,
a pastor of a leading church, several society
ladies and small children galore. What do
you think they were watching? Two
steam engines in active operation and a tin
railway train running on a circular track.
Probably the most independent trades
man in this city is a certain China
man who owns a store in the First
ward. Though admitting that busi

propose to lower his dignity to the point of
bantering with customers. A newspaper
man was looking over the stock of curios
and bric-a-braoc in this Chinaman's store
yesterday when the proprietor called out
from the end of the room:
"You buy?"
"No, just looking around. What is the
price of this cigar case?"
"One dollar, six bittee."
"that is too much."
"Too much? What you do?"
"I am in the newspaper business."
"How much sell papah?"
"Five cents."
"Too much," was the Celestial's logic.
"You no buy, you go to more place."
A serious problem is troubling our city ed

east, where the mercury jerks from the

the day, with intervals of snow, sleet, rain
and hail between, admirable opportunities
are offered for a complete course in this
important branch, but in Helena things
are different. With the exception of an
occasional off day, it is one round of sun
shine.

Main street corner chatting on local sub

was seen approaching from the corner
above. It was visible to all at the same
time.
"Well, boys, I must be going," said one,
turning down town.
"I have got a date," said another looking
at his watch and starting for an office

"And I promised to meet a man at The

The Speakership of the House.
The sneakership of the house is the seo
ond office of importance in the government.
Under the rules of the house, legislation is
determined by the committees, and the
speaker appoints the committees. The
power of his office, therefore, is very great.
He may determine easily the character of
legislation upon subjects of vital import
ance. Supported by a party majority, like
Mr. Reed in the last congress, he may exer
cise arbitrary powers. Mr. Reed's theory
was apparently that the country loves
pluck, and that a display of mastery in the
speaker's chair would be exceedingly im
pressive and popular. The country does
love pluck, but it loves fair play better, and
the despotism of the speaker and of the
majority in the last congress affected the
country as the old slave-holding congres
sional despotism affected it forty years ago.
At that time it strengthened the conviction
and the par'y which excluded the despotic
majority from power for more than a quar
ter of a century. It is by no means the Mo
Kinlev tariff only which has given the dem
ocratic party a dangerously large majority
in the new house. It was the gross abuse
of the power of the majority in the last
house.-Harper's Weekly.
