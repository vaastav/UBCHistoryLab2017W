: tary Bayard's Letter to the President, t '
: Washington, Dec 9. Yesierday after
noon President Cleveland sent to the Sen
ate a letter from the Secretary of State,
accompanied by the correspondence in re
lation td the rights of American fishermen
in the British North American waters. In
his letter of transmittal the President
3ays:
"I commend to your favorable considera
tion the suggestion that a commission be
authorized to take perpetuating proofs of
the losses sustained during the past year
by American fishermen owing to the un
friendly and unwarranted treatment by
the local . authorities of the maritime
provinces of the Dominion of Canada. I
may have occasion hereafter to make fur
ther recommendations during the present
session for such remedial legislation as
may become necessary for the protection
of the rights of our citizens engaged in
the North American Atlantic waters."
The following is the letter of the Secre
tary of State:
Department of State,
Washington. Dec. 8. 1886. f
. To the President: The Secretary of State
has the honor to submit to the President with
a view to its communication to Congress the
correspondence relative to the fisheries Id Mie
waters adjacent to British North Am-?ttia,
which has taken place during the present
year. It will disclose the action of thisDej'art
ment and of our Minister to Great Brita'n In
relation to the disputed construction of tbe
convention of 1818, and what has been don to
procure such an interpretation of its provisions
as will be acceptable to both parties to that in
strument and consistent with their mutual in
terest and honor.
From time to time since the conclusion of the
treaty of 1818, differences have arisen between
the two governments as to the extent of the
renunciation by the United States of their
former Ashing rights in common in the littoral
waters of British North America, and the true
definition of the rights and privileges retained
by and expressly guaranteed to the United
States in the first articles of that convention.
The history of this question during the period
from 1818 to the present time has been of un
successful attempts to adjust the respective
claims, and occasionally the difficulties have
been bridged over by temporary arrangements
notably by the treaty of Washington of June
5, 1854, and of the treaty of Washington of May
8, 1871 the fishery articles of the latter having
been abrogated by the United States on June
30. 1885.
It is deeply to be regretted that the efforts of
this department, as shown by the correspond
ence now submitted, to arrive at such an agree
ment as would permit instructions of like ten
or to be issued by the Governments of Gieat
Britain and the United States, to guide the cit
izens of the respective nationalities in the un
molested exercise of their rights of fishing in
the waters in question and defining the
limits of lawful action therein, have not as yet
reached a final and satisfactory result. Al
though those propositions are now pending lor
consideration which it is hoped may prove the
basis of a just and permanent settlement, yet
as supplementary to the published history
of this long standing subject, and as illus
trating the obvious necessity in
the interest of amity and good neighborhood, of
having a clear and well-defined understanding
of the relative rights of the two Governments
and their respective citizens, it is considered
expedient that Congress should have full
knowledge of the action of the executive in the
premises to assist them in their deliberations
upon this importa nt subject.
It will be observed in the course of this corre
spondence that notification has not failed to be
duly given to the Government of Great Britain,
that compensation is expected for the loss Mid
damage caused to American fisherman by
the unwarrantable action of the local
authorities of the Dominion of Canada,
not merely by the summary seizure
of their vessels and the exaction of heavy f Jies
in advance of hearing and judgment, but for
the curtailment of privileges, to which they
were justly entitled under commencial regula
tions, as well as treaty stipulation ; and the
consequent interference with their legitimate
voyages, whereby the natural profits of their
industry were seriously diminished and in
many cases wholly destroyed. It would seem
proper that steps in perpetuam rei tnemoriam
should be taken by congress to allow proofs
to be made and placed upon reco rd of these
losses and injuries to our citizens to enable
them to be properly presented to Her Majesty's
Government for settlement, and that for this
purpose a commission should be authorized by
Congress to take the necessary proofs of the
espective claimants.
Respectfully submitted,
fSignedl T. F. Bayard.
The accompanying correspondence is
very voluminous and consists of letters
from Secretary Bayard to Ministers West
and Phelps; those of Minister Phelps to
the Earl of Roseberry, and his replies
and the Earl of Roseberry's communica
tion to Minister-West. The letters of Sec
retary Bayard to Minister West are at
times diplomatically vigorous. The fol
lowing paragraph occurs in his letter oi
May 29, 1S85:
"I have telegraphed Mr. Phelps, our
Minister at London, to make earnest pro
test to Her Majesty's Government against
such arbitrary, unlawful, unwarranted
and unfriendly action on the part of the
Canadian Government and its officials,
and have instructed Mr. Phelps to give no
tice that the Government of Great Britain
would be held liable for all losses and in
juries to citizens of the United States and
their property, caused by the unauthoriz
ed and unfriendly action of the Canadian
officials to which I have referred."
In concluding a letter of October 19, he
says: "If, as 1 can not permit myself tc
believe, Great Britain should refuse tc
citizens of the United States the plainest
and most undeniable of these righs, (the
rights under ancient treaties), the conse
quence will be so serious that they can not
be contemplated by the Government but
with great concern."
The character of Earl Roseberry's com
muication is elaborately, explanatory and
placating. Assurances are given of the
British Goverhmbnts desire to do all that
may be necessary for the adjustment oj
the existing difficulties.
Short In His Cash Account.
Delphi, Ind., Dec. 9. An investigation
has been in progress here fo r some time,
anft the report has been current on the
streets all day that Samuel U. Heiland,
ex-Democratic treasurer of this county,
has a shortage in his returns of over
$14,000. Unpaid tax receipts and other
papers on hand, it is thought, will reduce
this deficit to $10,000. Mr. Hieland's hon
esty has never been questioned, and he in
sists there is something wrong, as he has
retained only his legal salary. A recount
was commenced last night, and the re

War yesterday transmitted to the House
of Representatives the report of the op
erations of the Mississippi River Commis
sion from July 1, 18S6, to November 30,
1886, with financial statements relating to
the appropriations.
No work was done in the first district
(Cairo to foot of Island No. 40200 miles)
except repairs of plant. The works al
ready constructed remain unchanged, and
a good navigable channel is maintained.
Examinations made at low water disclose
the fact that the revetments at Ashport
and Craighead Point, which were sup
posed to have been carried away, are still
in place entire.
In the second district (foot of Island
No. 40 to mouth of White river 180 miles)
in addition to repair of plant, the work
done has been in pursuance of an approved
project for "completing the work in the
river at Memphis," including the con
structing of a mattress revetment in front
of the city levee, beginning at the lower
! end and extending up stream as far as the
appropriation will admit, lour hundred
feet was completed at the end of October.
In the third district (mouth of White
river to Warrenton, Miss. 230 miles),
operations have been limited to repair of
plant and preparations for work at Delta
Point.
The principal work done in the fourth
district (Warrenton to head of the passes
484 miles), was upon the channel of Red
river between the Mississippi and the head
of the Atchafalaya.
Altogether the operations were confined
almost wholly to the preservation and re
pair of the plant. The amount available
for the Commission November 1 last was
$2,000,118.

The December returns of average farm
prices by counties show material reduc
tion as compared with values of crops of
1S85 in wheat, rye and barley. Corn has
made an average increase nearly equiva-,
lent to the per cent, of reduction in quan
tity, and oats, in sympathy with corn
rather than with the small grain used lor
food, averages a slightly higher value
than last year. The farm value
of corn was 33 cents per bushel
in December last year. It
now 37 cents, one cent higher than the
crop of 1885. The average for the previous
five years was 44.7 and for the ten years
prior to 1880 it was 42.6 cents. The price
in the surplus States are: Ohio 35.5, Indi
ana 32, Illinois 31, Iowa 30, Missouri 31,
Kansas 27, and Nebraska 20. This is an in
crease over last year of 1 eent
in Nebraska, 3 in Kan
sas, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and
6 in Iowa and Missouri. The average is 56
in New York, 47 in Pennsylvania and 45 in
Virginia, 2 cents lower in each than last
year. Prices in the cotton States south
and west of North Carolina are higher
than last year. South Carolina, 60;
Georgia, 60; Alabama, 58; Mississippi, 59;
Louisiana, 55; Arkansas, 49; Texas, 60
an increase of 11 cents, due to the disas
trous drought.
The average December price of wheat is
69 cents, a reduction of 8 cents from the
average value of the last crop, and 44
cents above the price in 1885. The average
in New York is 84 cents, 12 cents lower
than last year, and in Pennsylvania 83, 13
cents lower. The reduction is greater in
several Western States. The average of
Ohio is 74 cents; Michigan, 73; Indiana,
70; Illinois, 60; Wisconsin, 68; Minnesota,
61; Iowa, 60; Missouri, 63; Kansas, 58;
Nebraska, 47; Dakota, 52. There is little
decline in the Southern States, in some of
which prices are higher than last year.
The average in California is 73.
The average of oats is 29.9 cents against
28.5 last December. Rye averages 51.1
against 57.9 last year. Barley, 53 cents;
last year 56.3. Buckwheat, 54.4, a reduc
tion of 1.5 cents per bushel. Potatoes, 46
cents, one cent higher thaa in December of
last year. The value of hay averages f8
per ton.
SERIOUS FIRE.
An Entire Block In the Business Portion of
Attlcn, Ohio, in Ruins, involving a Loss
of 150,000.
Attica, O., Dec 11. At seven o'clock
yesterday morning fire broke out in the
business portion of the town in a grocery
owned by John Carpenter. The flames
spread rapidly, and the block was soon in
flames. There was no apparatus to fight
the fixe with, and a bucket line was of but
little avail. The whole block was swept
before the flames were checked in their
mad career. The principal losers are:
J. R. Strandler, hardware, 20,000; R. L
Hearson, druggist, $8,000; Armaltage &
Wurtz, hardware, 4,000; John Carpenter,
grocer, 4,000; Thomas Gray, barber, $500;
Jacob Englehart, carriage .. areroom,
$500; J. W. Walker, building, store and
residence, t500; Joseph Hasler, two build
ings, $5,000; Smalls & Cauffman, bakery,
$4,000; W. H. Van Horn, building, $2,000.
Isaac Lanner owned the building occupied
bv Armaltage & Wurtz. His loss is about
$2,000.
All the business blocks on the other side
of the street were badly scorched, and the
large window glasses were broken by the
intense heat.
The G. A. R. Hall was burned with all
its furniture and records. J. R. Strand
ler's building, a large three-story brick, on
the corner of the square, was blown to
atoms by an explosion of dynamite and
gasoline in the cellar. A number of other
losses occurred, of which it is impossible
to obtain particulars. The total loss
amounts to nearlv $150,000; ins ired for
about half that amount, divided about
equally between the German-American,
Cooper, Phoenix, Milwaukee, Mutual,
Home and Columbia insurance companies.
The entire block is in ruins, the brick
walls of the buildings lyizg in the streets.
THEY ARE OATH-BOUND,
And That Is the Reason the German Re
formed Church Strikes Knights of Labor
From Its Membership.
Cincinnati, Dec. 11. Concerning the
fourteen Knights of Labor stricken from
the German Reformed Church member
ship at Fond du Lac, Wis., Pastor
Broemer, of this city, said yesterday:
"This action is not an exceptional one by
any means. Our church, as a body, is op
posed to the Knights of Labor. The synod,
composed of German Lutheran churches in
Missouri, Ohio and other States, has declar
ed against Knights of Labor and similar as
sociations on the ground that it is an oath
bound organization. Even the solemn ob
ligations of the Church of Christ
are not assumed with an oath of
obedience. The majority decision is
obligatory upon members and may oblige
to a wrong act, and the aim and spirit of
the Bociety is discontent with present
earnings and circumstances, which our
church holds to be contrary to that
scriptural injunction to be content with
such things as ye have."
