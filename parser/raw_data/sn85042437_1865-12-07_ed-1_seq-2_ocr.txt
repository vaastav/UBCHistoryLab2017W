THANKSGIVING.
To-day the people of Ohio are called
upon by proclamation of their . Governor,
and the entire nation is called upon by
proclamation of its President, to lay aside
nrilinartr nroenfions find DUrPUltS. and
unite in givinr thanks and praise to God
It i noticeable that "Thanksgiving, by
tradition and precedent a State institu
tion, will be celebrated this year as i
national festival, in accordance with the
proclamation of tho Chief Magistrate of
the United States. "We are glad of this,
not only on general grounds, because
Thnhtr'ivin' should be a national ana
not a Stato or sectional holiday, but in
his year particularly, on account of the
especial grace of God to us as a nation
Great as have been the'enusos for thanks
giving among lnuiviauais, iwnuura
States during the year, our national bleps-
ing-i have been so Fignal and wonderful
tl.nt flier--nnll as thev should. OVersliadoVv
TI tlw.r tunics in the cublic services of
the dnv. It is therefore a national
ThankpHving which we unite in to-day,
n all its public ceremonies and duties;
though we hope, indeed, that in the fami
ly circle, around tho heavily-loaded
Thanksgiving table, and by the crackling
fire-place, the day will be kept in the
good, old, fashioned, ancestral way, with
all the old Sew England traditions and
customs remembered and observed.
In order that wa may appreciate what
God has wrought for us as a nation during
the lastyear, let us throw off 18C5, and re
call the surroundings and circumstances in
Which we celebrated the Thanksgiving of
IPC'4. A mighty rebellion, at the South,
organized into a so-called Government,
and defended by a powerful army, held
possossion of one-third of the national
territory and threatened the life of the
nation. Robert E. Leo lay entrenched
in impregnable positions around Peters
burg and Richmond; Ilood, at the
head of another rebel . army, was
moving northward inUt Tennessee,
and our forces wcro falling back before
him; a powerful army, under Kirby
Smith, threatened Arkansas and Missouri;
Sherman was struggling in the morasses
of Georgia, and half the world looked
on expecting to see nis destruction.
Tho chief seaports of the rebel'States were
strongly garrisoned , and fortified, while
Confederate pirates roamed the seas des
troying our commerce, Confederate robbers
and murderers wero organizing piratical
expeditions on our lakes, planning to burn
our cities, and plottirigmurder against the
President. In the Xoi th our debt was rapid
lv increasing, the war seemed interminable,
gold was up in the two hundreds, the Chi-
:igo Democracv had demonstrated their
cowardice and meanness by declaring the
war a failure, and the constitutional
amendmenthad not been proposed by Con
gress. - The contrast of those dav3 with
these is sufficiently significant. For war we
have peace; for slavery we have universal
liberty; for a nation imperilled we have
nation triumphant;, for extravagant
though necessary government expenses we
have a marvellous reduction and retrench
ment; for a people bathed, in blood and
fveat, anguished with grief, . and strug
gling desperately for very life, we have a
redeemed republic, spreading its unmo
lested sails to every wind, and rejoicing
in the merriment of happy harvest homes.
Jvext after national preservation, in the
causes of our thanksgiving, we should re
member' the triumph of liberty. By the
success of our arms the shackles were
trirken from tbe limbs of four millions
of slaves. The thought should bring with 1
warning as well as thanksgiving. !
Throughout the war God's favor has been
with us precisely in proportion as we have
done justice to the blacks ; and his provi
dence has made our national triumph de
pendent upon the tusistance of this despis-
id and oppressed class. A e should bear
hi mind to-day our obligations and duties
to them, for .as we Jo by them God. will
do by us. If we are true to Lilierty and
Justice our': future is secure. ; Our only
danger lis jn being, false," our safety in
beiniT faithful. t them. Let us have cour
age'' to 'dd ofiuitt justice without fear and
without prejudice, to all our people, white
and bl aok. Let us remember to-day that :

The Report of Lieutenant General
Grant.
We publish to-day an extended syn
opsis of the official Report of Lieutenant
General Grant, which will be found of
surpassing interest. The Lieutenant Gen
eral " is : not so' careful of the feelings of
others as Secretary Stanton seemed to be,
and many items of history hitherto only
vaguely intimated are now made clear.
The only object seems to have 1een the
chronicling of the truth, which has evi
dently been given regardless of whose rep
utation might suffer.
The Fort Fisher expedition under Gen.
Butler is thoroughly ventilated, and is
anything but creditable to that officer.
General Grant designated General
"Weitzel to command that expedition,
but, as the orderjwas as a matter of courtesy
sent through Butler as the superior in
rank of Weitzel, Butler suppressed it ani
assumed tbe command himself. General
Grant says he had no knowledge of Gen.
Butler's intention to accompany the expe
dition until the evening before its depart
ure, and then supposed he was merely
going along to witness the explosion of
the powder-ship, which was one of But
ler's pet projects, and which Gen. Grant
disposes of in a very humorous manner.
The subsequent expedition under Gen.
Terry differed from the first only in the
addition of fifteen hundred troops. The
Lieutenant General took occasion to say to
Gen. Terrv: "I have served with
Admiral Porter, and know that you
can rely ' on his judgment and
his nerve to ' undertake what he
proposes." This looks very much liks
placing the blame for previous difficulties
upon Butler. It will be observed that
Gen. Butler's management during the
Richmond campaign is at different times
condemned.
The management of Gen. Ilunter in his
expedition against Lynchburg is not ap
proved, but is excused on the ground that
Gen. Hunter evidently thought he was
obeying orders.
The most damaging blow is aimed at
Gen. Rosecrans. After recounting the
main points in the Missouri campaign at
the time of Price's last invasion, tho Re
port states that the impunity with Which
the enemy moved through the State "shows
to how little purpose a superior force may
be used, adding that there was "no reason
why Gen.Rosecrans should not have beaten
and driven Price " long before the latter
ceased to advance. This sentence is as
severe as that wherein the Lieutenant
General says of the rebel General Hood's
strategy in the Nashville campaign : "Had
I had the power to command both armies,
I should not have changed the orders un
der which he seemed to be acting."
Some light is thrown upon the vexed
question as to who originated the idea of
"Sherman's march to the sea." Gen. Sher
man, when Hood threatened his commu
nications at Atlanta, proposed to destroy
all in his rear, cut loose from his base, and
strike out across Georgia to the coast.
Grant gave him permission to do so, pro
vided he could leave a sufiiuient force behind
to " hold the line of the Tennessee river
firmly." But it must not be concluded
that this was an entirely new idea
with Sherman. Grant's original design
was that bherman s army should go
through Georgia to the coast, but he pro
posed to bold Atlanta and keep open com
munications while doing so. The latter
part of the plan was changed at Sherman's
solicitation. Thus it will be seen that
these two great minds worked together for
the success pf our arms.
In reviewing movements in the Shenan
doah Valley, Grant says : " Not regarding
the operations of General Siegel as satis
factory, I asked his removal from com
mand, and. JVIaior General Hunter was
appointed to supersede him."
The Trial of Traitors.
At length we have in an official form
the views of the Executive relative to the
trial of persons charged with treason. The
President states in his Annual Message
that the Federal Courts will not be conven
ed in the States lately in rebellion until the
question of reconstruction shall have been
acted upon by the National Congress, and,
as it is stated that persons charged with
treason should have "fair and impartial
trials in tlie highest ciril tribunals of the
country,", we have the reason for delay in
bringing Jefferson Davis and other State
prisoners to trial. Andrew Johnson de
clared in substance at various times during
his candidacy for the office Of Vice Presi
dent, that treason was the highest crime
known to our laws ; and President John
son began his administration ol
the Chief Magistracy with the declara
tion r " Treason is a crime to be punished,
not pardoned." At a later period, when
what seemed liko an excessive number of
pardons was being granted, and many pa
triotic persons were seized with a deep fear
for the welfare of the country, the Presi
dent declared, in response to tho appeal
of South Carolina for executive clemency
in favor of the late head of the rebellion,
"Treason must bo defined." PreciseH-
what would be necessary to define trea
son whether conviction, sentence and
subsequent pardon, would be sufficient
or whether the unobstructed execution of
the law was comprehended, the public
were not informed. We are glad that in
the present instance the. President uses
language which cannot be misunderstood.
He desires the trials heretofore mentioned to
occur " in order that the Constitution and
the laws may be fully vindicated ; the
truth clearly established and affirmed that
treason is a crime, that traitors should be
punished and the offense made infamous;
and at the same time, thnt the question
may be judicially settled, finally and for
ever, that no State of its own will has
the right o renotinee its place in
tho Union." Aside from the pur
pose of punishing traitors and making
treason "infamous," the President, it will
be observed, wants the question of the
rieht tf secession to be "judicially set
tled." We cannot see thnt there is any
cause for anxiety on this subject. Our
Southern fellow-citizens regard this ques
tion as "settled, finally and forever," by
the arbitrament of the sword. If they ac
quiesce in the decision, certainly we ought
to be satisfied. Suppose a Taney
should find a placeon the judicial bench and
decide that the right of secession was in
herent in the States. What then ? Could
the events of the past four years be un
done ? or would it. bo desirable that they
should be ? If the right of secession had
been regarded by the government as an
unsettled judicial qnestion, undoubtedly
V would have been brought before the
proper tribunal when the first attempt at
disintegration was made. Having waged
a four years war, and won by force of arms
all the government claimed as right and
legal, which claim was supported by the
entire loyal population of th. land, we can
see' no 'good 'reason why the "Executive
should be' so desirons'o'f'h judicial decision
now. But there is a Chase instead of a
Taney upon the Supreme bencbLand there
is no cause to fear the result should such a
question be raised. 'That traitors are to be
punished, and that tbe seal of judicial con
demnation is to be placed upon treasona
ble attempts to disrupt the country, will
be hailed by the loyal masses as joyful
Jidings. ' ' ' ' !" -
GEN. GRANT'S REPORT.
The Last Year of the Rebellion—Most
Important Chapter in American
History.
The Reportof Lieutenant General Grant
to tbe Secretary of War is a very full, terse
and accurate document. It forms a com
plete history of the movements of our ar
mies from the opening of the spring cam
paign of 18G4 to the close of the rebellion.
Tho Lieutenant General prefaces by say
ing that from an early period he was con
vinced of the necessity of active and con
tinuous operations in the field, regardlesi
of the season and weather. He aptly
savs
The armies of the East and West acted
independently, and without concert, like a
balky team, no two ever pulling together,
enabling the enemy to use this great ad
vantage on his interior lines of communi
cation for transporting troops from East
to West, reinforcing the army when most
vigorously pressed, and to furlough large
numbers during seasons of inactivity on
our part, to go to their homes and do the
work of producing for the support of their
armies.
HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE COMMANDERS
UNDER HIM.
The instructions to his subordinate com
manders for the spring campaign of 1864,
are next given. General Sherman was in
structed to move against Johnston's army:
to break it up, and go into the interior of
the enemy s country, as tar as be could, in
flicting all possible damage upon their war
resources. If the enemy in his front
showed siirns of ioinins Lee, to followhim
up to the full extent of his ability, while
the Lieutenant General himselt would
prevent the concentration of Lee upon
him, if it was in the power of the Army
ol the Potomac. General Meade was in
structed that Lee's army would be hia ob
jective point ; that wherever Lee went he
would go also.
ARMY OF THE JAMES.
A letter of instructions to General But
ler, bearing date April 2d, is given in full,
detailing the plans of tbe campaign, &c.
It was conceded to be impossible lor the
troops advancing on Richmond to act as
a unit, but the different organizations
were to move on converging lines and for
a common purpose. Whilst Meade was
to directly oppose Leo, Butlor was to ad
vance on Richmond. The Report states
On the 16th these instructions were sub
stantially reiterated. On the. 19th,
order to secure full co-oncration between
his army and that of Gen. Meade, he was
informed that I expected him to move from
fortress Jionroe toe same clay taai lien
Meade moved from Culpepper. The ex
act time I was to telegraph him as soon as
it was fixed, and that it would not be
earlier than the 27th of April ; but it was
my intention to tight Lee between Cul
pepper and Richmond, if he would stand.
bhould he, however, tarl back into men
mond, I would follow up and make a junc
tion with his (Gen. Betier's) army on the
James river, so tnat, could 1 be certain
that he would be able to invest Richmond
on the south side, so as to have his left
resting on the James river above the city,
I would form the junction there; that cir
cumstances might make this course ad
visable. Anyhow, that he should use
every exertion to secure a footing as far
up the soutl) side of the river as he could,
anil as soon as possible after tho receipt of
orders to move: that if he could not carry
the city, be should at least detain as large
a force as possible, uiv first object being to
break the military power of the rebellion,
and capture the enemy's important strong
holds. I bis made me desirous ttist Iren
Butler should succeed in his movement
against Richmond, as that wouid tend
moro than anything else, unless it were
the capture of Lee s army, to accomplish
the desired result in the east. If he failed,
it was my determination, by-hard fight
ing, either to compel Lee to retreat or so
cripple him that lie could not detach a
large force to go North and still retain
enoueh for the defence of Richmond. It
was well understood by both Generals
Butler and Meade, before starting on the
campaign, that it was my intention to put
both their armies south of the James river
in case of a failure to dastroy Lee without.
OPENING THE CAMPAIGN OF 1865 IN
VIRGINIA.
The report then narrates in' general
terms, the history of the mrvemerrts of the
armies ol tho rotoinae and ot the James
during the month of May, disclosing no
facts not already known to tbe public. In
regard to General Butler s operations it
says : On the evening of the l.ith and
morning of the 14th, he carried a portion
of the enemy's first line of defence at Hur
ry's Bluff, or Fort Darling, with a small
loss. The time thus consumed from the
6th lost to us tbe benefit of the surprise
and capture of Richmond and Petersburg,
enabling, as it did, Beauregard to collect
his loose forces in North and South Caro
lina, and bring them to the defence of
these places.
Un the lGih the enemy attacked uencral
Butler in his position ih front of Drury's
Bluff. He was forced back or drew back
into his intrenchments, between the forks
of the James and Appomattox rivers, the
enemy intrenching strongly in bis Iront,
thus covering his railroad, the city ana all
that was of value to him. His army,
therefore, though in a position of great
security, was as completely shut off from
further operations directly against Rich
mond as it it had been in a bottle strongly
corked. It required but a comparatively
small force of the enemy to hold it there.
The narrative having been brought to
the unsuccessful fighting at Cold Harbor,
Lite Ocnornl continues :
After the battle of tho Wilderness, it
was evident that the enemy deemed it of
the first importance to run no risks with
the armv he then had. He acted steadily
on the defensive behind breastworks, or
only on the offensive immediately iu front
of them, and where, in case of repulse, he
would easily retire behind them. ltb-
out a greater sacrifice of life than 1 was
willing to make, all could not be accom
plished that 1 had designed north of Rich
mond. 1 tlseretore determined to continue
to hold substantially the ground we then
occupied, taking advantage of any favor
able circumstances tnat might present
themselves, until the cavalry could be
sent to Charlottesville and Gordonsville
to effectually break up the railroad com
munication between Richmond and the
Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg ; and
when the cavalry got well off, to move
the army to the south side of the James
River, by tbe enemy s nnnic, wnere 1 leit
I could cut off all his sources of supply,
except by the canal.
Un the 10th ot June, uenerai isutier
sent a force of infantry under Generrl Gil-
more and cavalry under General iiautz
to capture Petersburg, if possible, and de
stroy the railroad and common bridges
across tho Appomattox. The cavalry
carried the woods on the south side, and
penetrated well in toward the town, but
were forced to retre.it General Gilmore,
finding the works he approached very
strong, and deeming an assault would be
mpracticable, returned to Bermuda Hun
dreds without attempting them.
Attaching eroat importance to the pos
session of Petersburg, I sent back to Ber
muda Hundreds and City Point General
Smith's command by water, ttt'a the White
House, to reach there in advance ot the
Army of tho Potomac. This was for the
express purpose pf securing Petersburg
belore the enemy, becoming aware ot our
ntention, could reintorce the place.
The movement from Cold Harbor com
menced on the 12th. One division of cav
alry under General Wilson, and the Fifth
Corps, ciosseo me vnicKanoimny at, xxing
Bridge and moved out to White Oak
Swamp to cover the crossing of the other
corps. The advanee corps reached Wil
cox's Landing and Charles City Court
House on tbe night ot the 1-im.
Dunne this time the armies ot the Poto
mac and Northern Virginia had been con
fronting ea. h other. In that time they
had fought more desperate battles than it
probably ever before fell to the lot of two
armies to fight, without materially chang
ing the ground'of either. ' " '"
The battles ot the Y ilderness, ripott-
sylvania, North Ann and Cold .Harbor,
bloody and terrible as tney were on our
side, were even more damaging to the
enemy, and so crippled him as to make
him wary ever after ot talcing the oaen-
sive. His losses in men were prowroiy not
so great, owing to the fact that we were,
save at tbe wilderness, toe attacking
party ; and when he did attack it was in
the open field. '
ihe details ol tbese battles, wbicn lor
endurance and bravery on fae part of tbe
soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are
given in the report. oi major ueucmi
Meade, and the subordinate reports accom
panying it. During the campaign of forty
three days, from the Rapidan to James
river, the army had to be supplied from an
ever-shifting base, by wagons over nar
row roads, through a densely wooded
country with a lack of wharves at each
base from which to conveniently discharge
vessels.
The report then turns to the operations
in the valley. In regard to Gen. Sigel, it
says that he was relieved at Gen. Grant's
request. Concerning Gen. Hunter it says:
"Had Gen. Hunter moved by way of
Charlottesville, instead of Lexington, as
his instructions contemplated, be would
have been in a position to have covered
the Shenandoah Valley against the enemy,
should the force he met have seemed to
endanger it. If it did not be would have
been within easy distance of the James
River Canal on the main line of communi
cation between Lynchburg and the force
sent for its defense. I have never taken
exception to the operations of General
Hunter, and I am not now disposed to
find fault with him, for I have no doubt
that he acted within what he conceived to
be the spirit of his instructions and the
interests of the service. The promptitude
of his movements and his gallantry should
entitle him to the commendation of his
country."
THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE PETERSBURG.
BURG. : :
Returning to the Army of the Potomac,
the report describes the movement across
the James, after the the battle of Cold
Harbor.. It then says: "After the cross
ing had commenced, 1 proceeded by
steamer to Bermuda Hundreds, to give
the necessary orders lor the immediate
capture of Petersburg. The instructions
to Gen. Butler were verbal, and were for
him to send Gen. Smith immediately, that
night, with all the troops he could give
him, without sacrificing the position he
then neld. 1 told him 1 would return at
once to the Army of the Potomac ; hasten
its crossing, and throw it forward to
Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it
could be done; that we could reinforce
our armies more rapidly there than the
enemy could bring troops against us.
Gen. Smith got off as directed, and con
fronted the enemy's pickets near Peters
burg belore daylight the next morning;
but for some reason that I have never been
able to satisfactorily understand, he did
not get ready to assault his main line
until near sun-down, incn, with a part
of his command, he led the assault and
carried the lines northeast of Petersburg
from the Appomattox river, for a distance
of over two miles, rapturing fifteen pieces
of artillery, and 300 prisoners, this was
about 7 p. m. Between the line thus
captured and Petersburg, there was no
evidence that the enemy had reinforced
retorsburg witn a single brigade trom any
source.
ine nignt w.ts clear, tne moon shining
origntiv, and favorable to turther opera
tions. Gen. Hancock with two divisions
of the 2d corps, reached Gen. Smith just
after dark, and offered the service of these
troops as be (Smith) might wish, waiving
rank to that commander, who he natur
ally supposed knew best the position of af
fairs, and what to do with the troops; but
insieaa oi uiKing mese troops and pushing
at once into Petersburg, he requested Gen.
Hancock to relieve a part of his lino in
the captured works, which was done be
fore midnight. By the time I arrived the
next morning the enemy was in force. An
attack was ordered to be nmdo at six
o'clock that evening by the troops under
Smith, und the 2d and 9th corps. It re
quired until that time for the 9th corps to
v. up mm inwj puKitHirt. i ne atiacK was
made as ordered, and the fighting contin
ued with but little intermission until six
o'clock the next morning, and resulted in
our carrying the advance and some of the
mam works ot the enemy to the right and
left of those previously captured by Gen.
Smith, several pieces of artillery and over
lour hundred prisoners. The 5th corps
having got up, the attacks were renewed
and persisted in with great vigor on the
17th and 18th, but only resulted in forcing
the enemy to an interior line, trom which
he could not be dislodged. The advantages
in position gained by us were very great
The army then proceeded to envelop
Petersburg, toward the Suuth Side Rail
road, as far as possible, without attacking
the fortification. On the 6th, the enemy,
to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from
a part of bis reinforcements, in front of
Bvrmuda Hundred, expecting, no doubt,
to get troops from the north of the James
to take the place of those witndrawn. Be
fore we could discover it, General Butler
taking advantage of this, at once moved
his force on the railroad between Peters
burg and Richmond.
As soon as I was apprised of the advan
tage thus gained, to retain it I ordered
two divisions of the sixth corps, Gen.
Wright commanding, that were embark
ing at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for
City Pmint, to report to Gen. Butler at
Bermuda Hundreds : of which Gen. But
ler was notified, and the importance of
holding a positiou in advance of his pres
ent lino urged upon him. About two
o'clock in the afternoon Gen. Butler was
forced back to the line the enemy had
withdrawn from in the morning. Gen.
Wright, with his division, joined Gen.
Butler in the forenoon of the 17th, the lat
ter still holding, with a strong picket line,
the enemy s works; but instead of putting
these divisions into the enemy's works to
hold tbem, he permitted tbem to tall back
some distance in the rear of his own line.
Between four and five o'clock in the after
noon, the enemy attacked, drove in the
pickets, and reoeeupied his old line.
EXPLOSION THE MINE IN FRONT OF
PETERSBURG.
Of the explosion It says :
"On the morning of the 30th July, be
tween four and live o clock, the mine was
sprung, blowing up a battery and most of
a regiment, and the advanceof the assault
ing column, tormed of the tuh corps, im
mediately took possession of the crater
made by the explosion and the line for
some distance to the right and left of it,
and a detached line for some distance to
the right and left of it, but for some cause
failed to advance promptly to the ridge
beyond.- Had they done this I have every
reason to believe that Petersburg would
have fallen Other troops were imme
diately pushed forward, but the time con
sumed in getting them up enabled the
enemy to rally from bis surprise, which
had been complete, and get lorces to this
point for its defence. The captured line
thus held being untenable, and of no ad
vantage to us, the trbopa. ware withdrawn.
but not without heavy loss. Thus ter
minated in a disaster what promised to be
the most successful assault of the campaign."
SHERIDAN IN THE VALLEY.
Sheridan having been assigned to com
mand in the valley, the Lieutenant Gen
eral, after somo hesitation, and an inter
view with Sheridan at his headquarters,
ordered an offensive movement. The Re
port continues :
I may here add that the result was such
that I have never since deemed it neces
sary to visit General Sherichtn before giv
ing" him orders.
The report then gives a brief account of
Sheridan s victories in the Shenandoah
Valley, highly complimentary to that
officer.
CAMPAIGN IN THE WEST.
Referrine; first to General Shorman's ar
my, the report gives a succinct narrative
of the movements against Atlanta up to
its capture, embodying only tacts already
familiar to the public. The account of
tbe Atlanta campaign winds up thus :
General Shermans movement from
Chattanooga to Atlanta was prompt, skil
ful and brilliant. The history of these
flank movements and battles during thnt
memorable campaign, will ever be read
with an interest unsurpassed by anything
in history."
The affair of Fort Pillow is referred to
as " an inhuman and merciless massacre."
About the last of Auirust, it being report
ed that the rebel General Price, with a
force of about 10,000 men, had reached
Jacksonport, on his way to invade Mis
souri, General A. J. .Smith's command,
then en rowfcrroin .Memphis to join Sher
man, was ordered to Missouri. A cavalry
force was also at the same time sent trom
Memphis, under command of Colonel
Winslow. This made General Rosecrans'
forces superior to those of Price, and no
doubt was entertained he would be able
to check Price and drive him back, while
the forces under General Steele in Arkan
sas, would cut off his retreat. On the 26th
day of September Price attacked Pilot
Knob, and forced the garrison to retreat,
and thence moved north to the Jlissouri
riyer, and centipued up that fiver toward
General Curtis, commanding the depart
ment of Kansas, who immediately collect
ed such forces as he could to repel the in
vasion of Kansas, while Gen. Rosecrans'
cavalry was operating in his rear.
' The enemy was brought to battle on
the Big Blue and defeated, with the loss
of nearly all his artillery and trains, and
s large number of prisoners. He made
a precipitate retreat to Northern Arkan
sas. The impunity with" which Price was
enabled to roam over the State, of Mis
souri for a long time, and tbe incalculable
mischief done by him, shows to how little
purpose a superior force may be used.
There is no reason why General Rose
crans" should not have concentrated his
forces and beaten and driven Price, be-J
fore the latter reached Pilot Knob.
SHERMAN'S MARCH FROM ATLANTA TO SAVANNAH.
- '
General Sherman immediately after the
fall of Atlanta, put his armies in camp in
and about the place, and made all prepar
ations for refitting and supplying them
for future service. The great length of
road from Atlanta to the Cumberland
river, however, which had to be guarded,
allowed the troops but little rest During
this time Jefferson Davis made a speech
in Macon, Georgia, which was reported in
the papers of the South, and soen became
known to the whole country, disclosing
the plans of the enemy and thus enabling
General Sherman to meet them. He ex
hibited tbe weakness of supposing that an
army that had been beaten and tearfully
decimated in a vain attempt at the defen
sive could successfully undertake the of
fensive against the army that had so often
defeated it- In execution of this plan,
Hood with his army was soon reported
to be southwest of Atlanta, moving far to
Sherman's right. He succeeded in reach
ing the railroad about Big Shanty, and
moved north on it. General Sherman,
having a force to hold Atlanta, with the
remainder of his army fell upon him and
drove him to Gadsden, Alabama. Soeing
the constant annoyance he would have
with the roads to his rear if he attempted
to hold Atlanta, General Sherman pro
posed the abandonment and destruction of
that place, with all the railroads leading
to it, and telegraphed me as follows : ,
Centrevillk, Ga., Out 18 Noon.
Despatch about Wilson jyst ; received.
Hood is now crossing Coosa River, twelve
miles below Rome, bound west. If he
passes over the Mobile and Ohio road, had
I not better execute the plan of my letter,
sent by Colonel Porter, and leave General
Thomas with the troops now In Tennessee
to defend tbe State. He will have an am
ple force when the reinforcements or
dered reach Nashville,
W. T. SHERMAN,
Major General.
For a full understanding of the plan re
ferred to in this despatch, I quote from
the letter sent by Colonel Porter :
"I will therefore give my opinion that
your army and General Canity's should
be reinforced to the .maximum; that af
ter you get Wilmington you strike for
Savannah and tho rivor: that Canby be
instructed to hold the Mississippi river,
and send a force to get Columbus, Geor
gia, either by the way of the Alabama or
the Apalachicola, and that keep Hood
employed and put my. army in fine order
for a march on Augusta, Columbia and
Charleston to be ready, as soon as Wil
mington is sealed as to. commerce, and
the -ity of Savannah is in our possession."
This was in reply to a letter of mine of
date September 12th, in answer to a de
spatch of his containing substantially the
same proposition, and in which I informed
him of a proposed movement against
Wilmington, and of the situation in Vir
ginia, &c.
CITY POINT. Va., Oct. 11, 1864—11 A. M.
Your despatch of October loth is re
ceived. Does it not look as "if Hood was
going to attempt the invasion of Middle
lennesse, using the Mobile tE Ohio, and
Memphis & Charleston Roads to supply
his base on the Tennessee river about
Florence or Decatur ? If he does this, he
ought to be met and prevented from get
ting north of the Tennessee river. It you
were to cut loose, I do not believe you
would meet Hood's army, but would be
bushwhacked by all the ' old . men
little boys and such railroad guards
as are still left at home; Hood
would probably strike for Nashville, think
ing that by going north he could inflict
greater damage upon us tnan we could
upon the rebels by going South. If there
is any way ot getting at Hoods army, 1
would prefer that; hut I must trust to
your own judgment. I find I shall notbe
able to send a torce trom here to act witb
you on Savannah. Your movements.
therefore, will be independent of mine, at
least until tbe tall of nicliniond takes place.
I am afraid Thomas, with such lines of
roads as he has to protect, could not pre
vent Hood from going North. With Wil
son turned loose with all your cavalry, you
will rind the rebels put much more on tbe
defensive than ' '
U. S. GRANT.
Lieutenant General.
Major General W. T. Sherman.
KINGSTON, GA., Oct. 11—11 A. M.
- Hood moved his army from Palmetto
Station across by Dallas and Cedartown,
and is now on the Coosa river, south of
Rome. He threw one corps on my road
at Ackworth, and I was forced to follow.
1 hold Atlanta with the 2uth corps, and
have strong detachment along my line.
This reduces my active force to a compar
atively small army. We cannpt remain
here on the defensive with 250,000 men,
and with the bold cavalry he has he can
constantly break my roads. I would pre
fer to make wreck of the road and coun
try from Chattanoga to Atlanta, includ
ing the latter city, send back all my wound
ed and worthless, and with my efficient
army move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea. Hood may turn into
Tennessee and Kentucky, but I believe he
will be forced to follow me. Instead of
my being on the defensive I would be on
the offensive. Instead of guessing at what
he mean's to do, he would have to guess at
my plans. The difference in war is full
twentv-tive per cent. . 1 can make Savan

City Point, Va, Oct. 11, '64 11:30 p. m.
'Your despatch of to-day has been re
ceived. If yuu are satisfied, the trip to
the sea coast can be made, holding the
line of the Tennessee river firmly, you may
make it, destroying all the railroads south
of llalton or Chatanooga, as you think
U. S. GRANT, Lt. Gen.
"W. T. SHERMAN, Maj. Gen."
Having concentrated his troops at At
lanta by the 14th of November, General
Sherman commenced his march. Threat
ening both Augusta and Macon, his coming-out
point could not be definitely fixed.
Having to gather his subsistence as he
marched through the country, it was not
impossible that a force nfenor to his own
might compel him to head; for such point
as he could reach, instead of such as he
might prefer - The blindness of the enemy,
however, in ignoring his moviamenU, and
sending Hood s army, the only consider
able force ho had west ot Richmond and
east of the Mississippi river, northward on
an offensive campaign, left the whole
country open, and Sherman's route to his
own choice.
How that campaign was conducted;
how little opposition was met with; the
condition ol the country through which
the armies passed ; the capture of Fort
McAllister, on the Savannah river, and
occupation of Savannah on the 21st of
December, are all clearly set forth in Gen.
Sherman's admirable report. ' ,
THE NASHVILLE CAMPAIGN.
The advance of Hood, his reinforce
ments ofForrest's cavalry, the destruction
of Johnsonville, the retroat of Schofield
from Pulaski under: orders, the battle of
Franklin, and the gathering together by
Thomas-of all his forces at Nashville, are
briefly stated. The battle of Nashville is
described as follows : . '.
' On the Triorning of the 15th of Decem-c
bpr, Gen: Thomas attacked Hood in posi
tion and iif a battle lasting-two days, de
feated and drove-him from the field in the:
utmost confusion; leaving 'in our "hands
mostbf his'fertillery and tnaay ! thousand i
prisoners, including four general officers.
Before the battle of Nashville I grew
very impatient over, as it appeared to me. :
the unnecsseray delay. Ibis impatience
increased upon learning that the enemy
had sent a force of cavalry across the
Cumberland into Kentucky. 1 I feared
Hood would cross his whole RTmy and
give us trouble there. ' After urglni'upori
Gen. Thomas the necessity of immediately'
assuming the offensive, I started
West to superintend matters there in per
son. '"Reaching: Washington City, I'rei
ceived Gen. Thomas' dispatch concerning
bis attack upon the enemy, and the result
as far as the battle had progressed. I was
delighted ; all fears and apprehensions
were dispelled. I am not jet satisfied but
Thomas, imm,edistely upon the appearance
of Hood before Nashville,andbefore be had
time W fortify, should haT moved out
witB-hts whole force and given him battla,
instead of waiting to remount his cavalry,
which delayed him until the inclemency
of the weather made it impracticable to
attack earliear than he did ; but his final
defeat of Hood was so complete that it
will be accepted as vindication of that
distinguished officers judgment, ' . j 1 J
FORT FISHER AND GEN. BUTLER.
The report then describes the two expe
ditions against Fort Fisher and Wilming
ton. Concerning the first one it sayr: JJ
Gen. Butler, commanding the army
fi om which the troops were taken for this
enterprise, and the territory within which
they were to operate, military courtesy
required that all orders and instructions
should go through him. They were so
sent, but Gen. Weitzel has since officially
informed me that he never received the
instructions, nor was he aware of their
existence until he read Gen. Butler's pub
lished omcial report ot tbe rort r usher
failure, with my indorsement and papers
accompanying it. 1 bad no idea of Gen.
Butler's accompanying theexpedition until
the evening before it got off from Bermuda
Hundreds and then did not dream but
that Gen. Weitzel had received all the in
structions' and would be in command.
rather formed the idea that Gen. 'Butler
was actuated by a desire to witness the
explosion of the powder boat. The expe
dition was detained several days at Hamp
ton Roads, awaiting tbe loading of the
powder boat - The importance of getting

boat, had been urged upon Gen Butler,
nuu uo wan nuvistftl tu 8U uumy AUmirai
Porter."- . .;!...:
. The powder boat was exploded on the
morning of the 24th, before the return of
General Uutler trom Beaufort, but it
would seem irom tne notice taken or it in
the Southern newspapers that the enemy
were never enlightened as to the object of
the explosion until they were informed by
the Northern press. ;
Concerning General Terry's expedition,
the report says : i
It consisted of the same troops who
went with General Butler, with the addi
tion ot one brigade of 1 500, and a small
sjoge train, which it was found not neces
sary to land. In his instructions to Gen
Terry, General Grant says : 1 have served
with Admiral Porter, and. know ycu can
rely on bis judgment and nerve to under
take what be proposes.
The report then mentions tho transfei
ring of General Schotleld's army to North
Carolina, General Sherman's march fn m
Savannah to Goldsboro, : and i General
Sheridan's raid against the James River
Canal. It appears that Gen. rdieridan s
instructions contemplated that he should
cross the James river, pass down to the
west of Richmond, and join Gen. Sher
man in North Carolina. This enterprise
was defeated by the enemy burniag all the
James River bridges, our pontoons beine
too short to reach across. Sheridan ac
cordingly, after demolishing the remnants
of Early's army, destroyed the oanal and
marched to White House, where be joined
the army of the Potomac for the first
movement on Kichmond. ;
THE FINAL ATTACK ON RICHMOND.
The report next gives the full instruc
tions, dated Marco .14, 186a, to Generals
Meade, UrJ and Sheridan for the opera-
nous wiucu teu ia lue capture ot Rich
mond, which were in substance that Gen.
Sheridan should move on the 29th, with
all tbe cavalry and one division of infan
try, against the South Side and Danville
Kailroads, the whole army following to
the left for the double purpose of turning
mo cuniij uio m U 13 uemilBCS 1J1, irunt Ot
fetershurg, and of supporting j General
Sheridan in his attack on the railroad.
Tbe instructions oonclude as follows: .
The enemy may, as an onlT chance.
strip his lines to a mere skeleton in the
hope of advantage rot being taken of it,
whilst thev hurl everything against the
moving column and return." It cannot be
impressed too strongly upon commanders
of troops left in the trenches not to allow
this to occur without taking advantage of
it. The very fact of the enemy coming
out to attack, if he does so, may be regard
ed as almost conclusive evidence pf such a
weakening of hjs lines. . I would! have it
particularly enjoined upon corps com
manders that in case of an attack from
the enemy, those not attacked ate not to
wait for orders from the commanding
officer of the army to which they belong,
but that they wiR move promptly, and in
form the commander of their action. I
would also enjoin the same action on the
part of division commanders when other
parts of their corps are engaged.! In like
manner, 1 would urge the importance of
following up a repulse of the enemy.
f Signed U.S. Grant, LjautOen.
The report continues : I had spent days
of anxiety lest each morning shonld bring
the report that the enemy had Tetreatea
the night before. , I was firmly convinced
that Sherman's crossing the Roanoke
would be the signal for Lee to leave.
With Johnston and'him combined, a long
tedious and expensive campaign, consum
ing most of the summer, might become
necessary. By moving out, I would put
the armv in better condition fn minnii
and would at least, by the destruction of tbe
Dnnyiile road, retard the concentration of
the two armies of Lee and Johnston, and
cause the enemy to abandon much mate
rial that he might otherwise save. I
thorefore determined not to delay the
movement ordorod. Further instructions
were issued to General Sheridan, on the
tftn, instructing bun, in case the enemy
should come out of his intrenchments, to
fall upon him with full cofifl,dance, that
the army would engage him as circum
stances should dictate; but if he did not
come out, then Sheridan should destroy
the railroads effectually, and return and
join Sherman in North Carolina, accord
ing to circumstances.
On the fallowing day, General Sheri
dan's instructions were changed. He was
directed to abandon the raid on the rail
roads, and get on the rear of tbe enemy's
right flank, General Grant saving : I now
feel like ending the matter, if possible,
THE BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS.
A detailed account of the action at Fiye
Forks and the breaking of the enemy's
lines in front of Petersburg follows.
Concerning the affair at Five ForV the
report says :
General Sheridan, when unexpectedly
attacked by the enemy s infantry, dis
played great generalship. Instead of re
treating with his whole command to toll
the-story of superior forces encountered,
he deployed bis cavalry an foot, leaving
only enough men mounted to take charge
of the horses.. By this means he delayed
the enemy's advance until our own in
fantry got up, when be drove him back to
Five Forks,, assaulted and carried his
strongly fortified position, capturing all
nis artillery ana between- auoo and oouu
prisoners. Generals Ord, Wright an,d
Parke, meanwhile, had mscbj exam
inations in - their fcuut 1 with a
view to a general assault. The two
latter reported favorably. A bombard
ment was accordingly commenced on the
night ef tlie 1st of April, and kept up un
til four o'clock in the morning of tun 2nd,
when an assault was begun on tbe whole
line." : The results of the attack are stated
as previously-known.
When the remnant of Lee's army had
reached Amelia Court House on the re
treat, General Grant addressed a despatch
to General Sherman, dated April 6th, di
recting him to push as rapidly as possible
to finish the job for both Lee and John
son, and adding : Rebel armies are now
the only strategic point to strike at. -
THE SURRENDER OF LEE.
The pursuit and surrender of Lee, with
the correspondence previously published.

SHERMAN AND JOE JOHNSTON.
The following paragraph is all that re
lates to the. negotiations between Generals
Sherman and Johnston r '. . ,!
On the receipt pf my fetter of the 5th.

ment was disapproved by the President

ing to tbe United States, which bad been
surrendered to ns by agreement among
them some of the leaders who had surren

PROSPECTUS F0R: 1866
Tka na-w year upon which w are skout
to enter wtu usher in an era of national
growth, prosperity and greatness unexam
pled in Wad history of th. world. After
four years of desperate conflict, th. prin
ciples which the Liaiiis, ia common with
the patriotic citizens and abldiers of th.
country, has always announced and de
Cended, havs triumphesl,! and th war for
the Union and Freedom has ended in vic
tory and peac,; .Secession and slaTsry
hav. both bwn crushed, and our Republic,
re-united, .and regenerated, enters upon a
new and glorious career. The future is
full of the promise 6t 'greatness to our
nation and of prosperity to its citizens.
And ret the crisis of our 'danger is not
passed. The contest has only been trans
ferred from the. military to the political
arena! The weapons are" : ballots instead
of bullets, the pen instead of1 the sword.
The spirit of secession is yet alire. Th.
great work of reconstructing the relations
of the Southern States to thr Union, so
that the aatioa may b. mad. secure, iu
faith and honor kept inviolate, -suid equal
rights to all its citirens guaranteed, ia yet
to be performed a work which for its
hrnneas. importance and ' igantic diffi
culties is only paralleled by that which w.
have just concluded. In this most cri
tical and important period im the midst
of these great events no man, rich or
poor,, can afford to b without news
paper.. It is an article of prime necessity
in every household. Without it a man ia
half a century behind the age.
The Cleveland Liadkr enters upon the)
twenty-second year of its existence with
thebnghteet of prospects, and with a mora
wid'elv-eatended and well-deserved popu
larity 'than at . any previous period in iu
history. . . Its principles and; objects hav.
alwavs been fearlessly avowed and boldly
advocated. . They are the perpetuity of
the Uaion ; the maintenance oft Freedom;
the establishment' of Sqaal RfehU to all
men ; and the advancement of the ma
terial, mental and moral. condition of th.
Improvements.
During the past year the unexampled
prosperity of the iJtADtt has enabled iu
proprietors to introduce unprovamenu
which render it still morr worthy th.
support of its large and increasing eircl.
of readers'. . 1
Within that period it has been twic
enlarged, the total increase in. size being
about seven columns, thus at one accom
modating the advertising " pressure upoa
its celumns, and giving- much mora space,
to news and miscellaneous reading matter.
It is now as large as any paper in th
State, and larger than? any outside of Cin
cinnati. , ...... , .
On the first of October It appeared in a
new and handsom4rrsa gttmtly increas
ing its legibility and improving its ap
pearance, ir-il J .
A new double-cylinder press has been
purchased and erected during th. year,
which enables us to accommodate our
greatly increased subscription list and at
thef same time to keep the paper open for
the reception of news up to the latest
