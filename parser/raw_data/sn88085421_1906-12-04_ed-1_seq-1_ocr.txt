Cuba's Impression.
HAVANA, Dec. 4.—The impression
created in Cuba over the president's
utterances on the situation, in the
message is that Washington is deter
mined to establish a protectorate.
As a nation we still continue to en
joy a literally unprecedented pros
perity; and it is probable that only
reckless speculation and disregard o£
legitimate business methods on the
part of the business world can ma
terially mar this prosperity.
No Congress in our time has done
more good work of importance than
the present Congress. There were
several matters left unfinished at your
last session, however, which I must
earnestly hope you will complete be
fore your adjournment.
I again recommend a law prohibit
ing all corporations from contributing
to the campaign expenses of any party.
Such a bill has already past one House
of Congress. Let individuals contri
bute as they desire; but let us prohibit
in effective fashion all corporations
from making contributions for any
political purpose, directly Or indirect

On Injunction.
In my last message I suggested th?
enactment of a law in connection with
the issuance of injunctions, attention
having been sharply drawn to the
matter by the demand that the right
of applying injunctions in labor cases
should be wholly abolished. It is at
least doubtful whether a law abolish
ing altogether the use of injunctions

WALLA WALLA, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1906.
in such cases would stand the test
of the courts; in which case of course
the legislation would be ineffective.
Moreover, I believe it would be wrong
to prohibit the use of injunctions. It
is criminal to permit sympathy for
criminals to weaken our hands in up
holding the law; and if men seek to
destroy life or property by mob vio
lence there should be no impairment
of the power of the courts to veal wn...
them in the most summary and effect
ive way possible. But so far as pos
sible the abuse of the power should
be provided against by some such law
as I advocated last year .
In this matter of injunctions there
is lodged in the hands of the judiciary
a necessary power which is neverthe
less subject to the possibility of grave
abuse. It is a power that should be
exercised with extreme care and should
be subject to the jealous scrutiny of
all men, and condemnation should be
meted out as much to the judge who
fails to use it boldly when necessary
as to the judge who uses it wantonly
or oppressively. Of course, a judge
strong enough to be fit for his office
will enjoin any resort to violence or
intimidation, especially by conspiracy,
no matter what his opinion may be
of the rights of the original quarrel.
There must be no legislation in deal
ing with disorder. But there must
likewise be no such abuse of the in
junctive power as is implied in forbid
ding laboring men to strive for their
own uetterment in peaceful and lawful
ways; nor must the injunction be
used merely to aid some big corpora
tion in carrying out schemes for its
own aggrandizement. It must be re
membered that a preliminary injunc
tion in a labor case, if granted with-

VAN CLEVE FOR FAIR PLAY
President of Manufacturers Associa
tion at Chicago Makes Import
ant Speech.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 4.—The nation
al industrial association was address
ed today by J. W. Van Cleye, presi
dent of the national association of
manufacturers. He pleaded for fair
play on the part of operator and op
erative. He denounced Hearst, Bryan,
Gompers, Schmitz and Reuf. and said:
"The causes for the creation of this
movement of business men rested in
the autocratic and unjust employers
who go as far as they can without
violating th statutes and hold a
hostile attitude toward labor.
"The union autocrats also exist and
the good employer, as well as the good
behaved laborer must work in har
mony. The oppressive employer is a
worse enemy to society than the dem
agogue he assails.
He advocated the increase in wages
and urged manufacturers to share lib-
erally of their prosperity with the em
ployes. He cited statistics to prove
they were able to do so.
Walter Drew, one of the commission
ers of the national erectors associa
tion, told the industrial association
"The open shop and industrial crime
in San Francisco have brought our
ESTABLISHED 1861
work to a standstill. The employe
is to be censured and blame is on all
who stood by and watched the result
of the closed shop."
URGES KODAK WAR ON VICE.
Woman Says Camera Squad Could
Clean "Red-Light" Districts.
CHICAGO, Dec. 4.—Mrs. Stillwell,
head of the Salvation Army rescue
work in Chicago, who has ben engaged
in slum work for twenty years, sug
gested at the Fourth Presbyterian
church last night that a "kodak squad"
be used to rid the city of its "red-light"
uistricts.
"I think one of the most expedient
ways of putting notorious places out
ot commission," she said, "would be
the free use of a kodak to take pictures
of people found frequenting such
places."

punished

"OUTRAGEOUS"
SAYS RAYNOR
Maryland Senator So Terms
President's Letter
WOULD DEFY THE JAPANESE
Thinks California Has Right to
Regulate Schools by
Herself
WASHINGTON*, D. C., Dec. 4.—Sen
ator Raynor, of Maryland regards the
president's attitude on the Japanese
question as absolutely indefensible and
such a threat as using force against a
state as "outrageous and startling to
the imagination."
This afternoon he offered in the sen
ate a resolution directing the pres
ident to notify all the world, Japan
that the states have exclu
sive rights over the schools. This res
olution as proposed declares its (min
ion to the senate that there is no pro
vision in the treaty with Japan that
relates to the subject or interferes
with the right of the state of Califor
nia to conduct a system of schools in
accordance with its own legislation.
Raynor will speak on the subject to
morrow. After the resolution was laid
upon the table the senate adjourned.
The adjournment of the house took
place as soon as the reading of the
mesage was finished.
