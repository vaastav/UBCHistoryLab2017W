proposition.
CONGRESS AND CHICAGO RIVER.
Btepe May Be Taken to Remove Ob
atructiont to Navigation.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Unless Chicago
takes prompt action with, view to
lowering the tunnels and removing the
'center pier bridges from the Chicago
riypr, steps may be! taken by congress
trhlch will force the removal of these
obstructions to navigation. Repre
sentaUve Mann and other members of
the Illinois delegation consider thai
p- there has been enough delay already
in removing the obstacles to the im
provement of the river and that the
navigation interests have waited as
long as should be required.
It is proposed to pass a resolution
or incorporate a provision in the river
and harbor bill declaring that any ob
struction above the depth of the river
fixed by congress shall be ordered re
moved by the person or corporation
who constructed it. It has been made
plain by the secretary of war and oth
ers that, unless the tunnels and bridges
are removed, congress will not appro
priate any money for the Improvement
of this river, and the sooner they are
removed the quicker the improvements
will be made.
This applies to the depth of the river,
but does not affect, it is said, the im
provement which will be brought about
by the construction of the turning ba
sins. A committee of Chicagoans, of
which J. B. Galloway is chairman, has
been appointed to collect data showing
the necessity for tfiese turning basins.
This, together with some additional ma
terial which will be furnished by Mr.
Mann, will be laid before the rivers and
harbors committee. He will, in a few
days, introduce a bill providing for an
appropriation of $500,000 for the con
struction of two or three turning basins,
to be located in the north and south
branches of the river. He will also pre
sent a resolution granting authority for
the use of an unexpended balance in im
proving the south fork of the west
branch of the river, which is one of the
connections between the river and the
drainage canal.
PHILIPPINE STEAMER LINE.
San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce
Wants to Encourage an American
Lint.
San Francisco, Dec. 7.—The chamber
of commerce In this city has appointed
a. committee to consider ways and
means for encouraging a direct Amerl
can lino of steamers to the Philippines.
Thetreasury department has ruled that
by the recent Philippine decision of the
supreme court, shipments may not be
*n%de to the islands In foreign bottoms,
as w^vould be In violation of the stat
ute providing that coastwise trade must
be carried on in vessels of the United
States register under penalty of forfeit
ure of shipment. The Toyo Klsen
Kalsha and Occidental and Oriental
eteampshlp lines are thus debarred from
handling Philippine shipments, even tho
transferred to them from American
ships at Asiatic ports.
/In. view of the supreme court decls
Ions it is authoritatively reported that
the Pacific Mail steampship company
•will start a new line of steamers to ply
'between the Philippines. Hawaii and
Sad Francisco.
DECIDES AGAINST MOLINEUX.
Decision of Newburger Adverse to In
terettt of the Condemned Man.
New York, Dec. 7.—Judge Newburger
gave a decision yesterday afternoon ad
verse to the Interests of Roland B.
Molineux. The attorneys for Molineux
filed a motion, for the inspection of the
minutes of the grand jury which re
turned the- Indictment and to quash the
Indictment for murder. The. briefs were
handed In on Nov. 26, and the decision
•was rendered yesterday, both motions
being denied.
On March 2, 1899, In indictment charg
ing Molineux with the murder of Kath
erlne J. Adams was found by the grand
Jury, and In July, 1899 a motion was
made by the defense before Justice
"Blanchard to be allowed to inspect the
minutes of the grand Jury, which was
denied. In November, 1899, he was
placed on trial, and on Feb. 14, 1900, he
was convicted and sentenced to death.
An appeal resulted in the reversion of
the judgment, and new trial was ord
ered. In the decision rendered yester
day Judge Newburger said:
"The court of appeals, having the
poweg to direct a final judgment and
order the discharge of the defendant or
grant a new trial, did, by its order of
reversal, direct that a new trial should
take place.
"A new trial is a re-examinatlon of
the issue in the same court before an
other judge. When a new trial is ordered
it shall proceed In all respects as if no
trial had been had.
"It claimed, however, on the part of
the defendant, that the opinions of the
several judges of the court of appeals
upoon the question of the admission of
certain testimony on the trial prevents
the prosecution from proceeding. If that
was the intention ofythe court under the
power it possessed it would have been
so declared, and directed judgment for
the defendant and for his discharge.".
Mr. P.'illbin said Molineux would again
be placed on trial, but not before the
expiration of his term of office as dis
trict attorney.
MUSS TOPPAN INDICTED.
Woman Who is Alleged to Have Pois
oned Employer Held for Trial.
Barns table, Mass., Dec. 7.—Miss Jane
Toppan was yesterday indicted by the
grand jury of the county on two more
charges of murder—those growing out
of the death of Mrs. Genevieve Gordon
of Chicago and Alden P. Davis. Miss
Tcppan had previously been charged
•with thu murder of Mrs. Mary D. Gibbs
of Cataumet. An indictment was re
turned on this charge also.
When Miss Toppan appeared in court
she showed signs of weakening as she
listened to the charges preferred
against her. For a time her eyes were
fixed on the clerk, her, face pale and im
passive. then as the reading of the In
dictment continued, describing how her
alleged victims "did languish, and, lan
guishing, did. die," her head dropped to
ward the prisoner's rail, and placing her
face on her hands, she moved nervously.
At length Miss Toppan'g counsel
spared her further agony by waiving the
reading, and' all that remained was for
her to plead. Three times she was
asked i:t she was guilty of the murder,
ond three times she replied in a low
voice, "Not guilty."
After the woman had entered her plea
ber counsel asked that the state appoint
counsel for her, and Chief Justice Ma
son, who presided, said that he would
take the matter under advisement. Miss
Toppan was then led away to her cell,
where i»he will remain until Some time
early next spring, when she will be giv
en a trial by jury.
The finding of the jury was a surprise
In that three deaths are charged against
Miss Toppan instead of one, and all the
mystery which has surrounded the case
in regard to the poison alleged to have
been used.
Morphine and atropine are the poi
sons discovered by Professor Wood of
Harvard, and it is charged that she ad
ministered them in large quantities, ten
grains of morphine being the amount
named in the case of Mrs. Gibbs.
In the indictment are four counts. The
first alleges the death was caused by
morphine (ten grains) the second that
d$ath resulted from ten grains of atro
pine the third that it was caused by
ten grains of morphine and atropine
combined, and In the fourth that it was
due to poisons not known to the jurors.
The poisons, all the indictments say,
was administered "in a manner not
known to the Jurors."
In each of the three indictments there
are four counts, making the same
chargeti as in the case of Mrs. Gibbs.
The only difference In them is the
names and the dates of death.

Troubles o! Royal Families Oc
cupying Attention of Citizens
and Statesmen.
Quarrels o! Wilhelmina and the
Prince Consort May Affect
European Peace.
Designs for King Edward's Coro
nation Robes Have Been
Decided Upon.
London, Dec. 7.—The domestic in
felicities of European royalties have
never come so prominently before the
public as they have today. The diffi
culties of Queen Wilhelmina and its
dramatic circumstances form one of
the chief topics of conversation. The
romantic halo surrounding the young
queen and the keen interest taken in
her marriage only help to accentuate
public curiosity and sympathy. More
over, It is realized, Holland's scandal
may have grave political consequence's
for Europe and ltB developments are
followed closely by statesmen and those
best fitted to judge incline to the be
lief that while it will all blow over for
the present, there are grave appre
hensions for the future. From a per
sonal point of view England is more
deeply concerned in the scandal going
on In Hesse, where one of Queen Vic
toria's granddaughters Is on the verge
of separation from her husband. This
was a youthful marriage. The Grand
Duchess of Hesse was only eighteen
when she exchanged her British for a
continental title. It has proved to be
one of the most unsatisfactory among
all the royal matches: and the climax
it is believed would have been reached
ere this had it not been for the late
Queen Victoria's imperious influence.
The Duke of Edinburgh's other daugh
ter, the Crown princess of, Romania,
according to common report, also leads
a none *^oo happy marital existence,
tho recent rumors of open rupture are
met with strenuous official denial. How
ever, no one in England would be sur
prised to hear that she is figuring In a
role similar to that of her sister, the
grand Duchess of Hesse. Then there
are scandals going on in the courts
at Belgrade, and Lisbon, but these
have been so long before the public eye
as to need no comment.
May Be Royal Victim.
London, Dec. 7.—Major Van Tets, who
is alleged to have been severely injured
1y a kick !n the abdomen during a
quarrel with Prince Henry, the consort
of Queen Wilhelmina of Holland, died
last night, according to a dispatch re
ceived from Amsterdam tonight.
Mystery continues to veil recent
events in the Dutch court. Repeated
official denials of royal estrangement are
followed by equally positive insistence
upon the truth of the sensational stor
ies. The death of Van Tets, if confirmed,
will probably lead to the lifting of the
curtain.
The brother of Van Tets, who is the
Dutch minister at Berlin, is the authori
ty for the statement that the major suf
fered from appendicitis, and his asser
tion has been confirmed by Professor
Narath, dean of the surgical faculty of
the University of Utrecht, who said he
operated upon him last Tuesday for
blood poisoning caused by Inflammation
of the appendix. He added that there
was absolutely no sign of external vio
lence.
In many quarters, tho, the veracity
of these statements is strongly doubted.
These skeptics credit the truth cf the
story of a violent quarrel and cite cor
robative conditions. They say the posi
tion of Van Tets as an- aid de camp at
the court renders decidedly probable his
reported clash with Queen Wllhelmlna's
consort as a result of the asserted
grievances of his royal mistress. These
grievances are common talk In Holland,
and Van Tets has been known as an ar
dent champion of the queen.
Nothing but an official ministerial
statment, sent out with express author
ity of the queen, will quiet the tongues
of these gossips. They wonder that this
has not been issued before now, and
many diplomats share In their surprise,
altho publicly discrediting all the sen
sational stories.
Especial surprises has been created
by the report that a.Dutch bodyguard
now continually watches over the safe
ty of the queen. Such a statement re
garding any royal personage has hith
erto always been promptly admitted or
officially denied. Hence the belief
grows that where there is so, much
smok there must be some fire.
KITCHENER AS RIP VAN WINKLE.
Letter From South African Tells of
Interesting Army Episode.
London. Dec. 7.—A letter just re
ceived from an officer in South Africa
says a subaltern drew a caricature of
Kitchener as Rip Van Winkle leading a
centenarian soldier up a kopje. A staff
officer showed it to Kitchener and the
chief gave one of his grim smiles and
said. "It's an ugly prophesy, but if nec
essary we will hang on here until we
are that age. Our duty is to win and we
will." The subaltern was paralyzed with
terror until assured that Kitchener had
not asked for the artist's name.
ROSTAND APPEALS IN VERSE.
Noted French Poet Asks for Gifts for
Suffering Boers.
Paris, Dec. 7.—The Temps today pub
lishes a'dispatch from Tunis saying se
rious disorders have occurred at Soukel
Djemans, near Tripoli. Martial law has
been proclaimed In the disturbed dis
tricts.
All the newspapers here today publish
verses entitled "Christmas Carol," writ
ten by Edmond Rostand, in the form of
an appeal to the children of all countries
to contribute a portion of their Christ
mas gifts to be sent to the Boer mothers
and children in the concentration camps
of South Africa. The poem contrasts
the happiness of the readers with mis
ery and decimation of Boer Infants, and
says: "Their fathers' Christmas is not
an old man with kind eyes, but a spec
tre: He brings not in his transparent
hands boys' toys and sweetmeats, but
little coffins of different sizes."
THE CORONATION ROBES.
Designs for King Edward's Corona
tion Robes Decided Upon.
London, Dec. 7.—The designs of the
coronation robes have finally been de
cided upon. King Edward will wear a
cloth of gold underjacket. embroidered
with palm branches and shamrock, rose
and thistle. On the king's stole the
cross of St. George, royal crown and a
rose, shamrock and thistle will be woven
in gold there. His cap will be a mag
nificent garment, decorated with a silver
eagle fleur de lis and national floral em
blems. The queen will wear robes al
most exactly similar to those of Queen
Adelaide, which will be brought to
Marlborough house from Brodle Castle,
where they are kept as heirlooms. In
spite of age they are in excellent condi
tion. They are of black velvet, manu
factured on hand looms, elaborately
embroidered and laced., having gold
trimmings and with huge hanging
sleeves. The coronation rites will last
four hours. After the sacrament has
been administered to the king he will
discard the church vestments and put
on state robes. Over 3,000 precious
stones, diamonds, pearls, rubles, saph
Ires and emeralds will be included in the
king's crown. There will be 1,360 pure
white diamonds and 1,270 rose diamonds.
The historic ruby which King Castile
gave the Black Prince In 1367. and wh'f
subsequently "was worn by Henry V. at
Agincourt Is In the center of the crown,
placed In the heart of a maltese cross.

MARSHALLTOW23, IOWA, SATURDAY,! DECEMBER 7, 1901
Board of Control's Suggestion
Being Discussed-Prisoners
Should Be Classified.
All Erring Men Should Not Be
Incarcerated With Hardened
Criminals.
Horticultural Society Meets in
Des Moines Next Week—Will
Discuss Peaches.
Special to Times-Republican.
Des Moines, Dec. 7.—"I am of the im
pression," said W. S. Richards, pardon
secretary in the executive office, "that
the working out of the details of the
proposed reformatory for men, as sug
gested in the report of the state board
of control, is likely to be a more difficult
matter than many suppose. That there
ought to be some change is evident to
all who are familiar "with our prisons
and prisoners. It is all wrong to send
a young man who has always borne a
good reputation and conducted himself
becomingly, but has fallen into error in
one thing, to a big prison and put him
In with .'hardened convicts and habitual
criminals. I believe that the state
should never (put more than one convict
In a cell—each and every one should
have a cell for himself. Association
makes convicts and makes criminals.
But when the new cell house is com
pleted at AnamOsa that prison is going
to be nearly large enough for all the
convicts in the state. It will be too big
for a reformatory and the penitentiary
at Fort Madison will not be large
enough for all the convicts who are left
outside the reformatory. And yet,
st.ncthing ought to be done. It may be
necessary for the state to build a re
formatory somewhere. I believe the
suggestion of the board of control that
all who are under 30 years of age might
be sent to the reformatory to be not ex
actly right. At 30 years you go Into the
class of men with families. I know
that at the reform school persons have
been accetped who were over age, and it
was because the judges preferred not
to send them to the prisons. There is a
need of filling in the gap between the
reform school and the prisons in some
way, and while the problem is a hard
one it must be met so^n. The sugges
tion of the board of control is all right
and it only needs some one to work out
the. details."
ryardnj
Hunter, of the penitentiary ai
Anttiuoea. however, has figured it out
that if the suggestion of the state board
of control is acted upon and that insti
tution be made reformatory for all un
der 30 years, he will have a larger num
ber of persons under his care than now,
and Fort Madison will lose. The new
cell house, or north wing of the prison,
is to be larger than the south wing now
in use, and as it will be fitted with steel
cells it "will hold a larger number of
convicts. At present a number of the
convicts are paired off for the cells.
When the new part is finished, which
will not be for several months, Iowa will
have cell room for rent.
There are only a few of the men who
founght under Col. Kinsman who are
now in the G. A. R. post which bears
his name In this city. These are of the
Twenty-third Iowa. They and others
interested In the proposed monument to
Col. Kinsman at Council Bluffs, are
anxious to secure the names of com
rades of the Twenty-third Iowa and the
Fourth Iowa, with which regiments
Kinsman was connected, and especially
to learn If there has been any regiment
al organization and who the officers are.
The movement' to popularize the con
tributions for a Kinsman monument
meets with hearty approval here among
the scores of old soldiers residing in the
city. .i
The program of the Iowa Horticultur
al Society which meets here next week
is an unusually good one and contains
many papers that ought to be 6t gen
eral interest. On the program are two
papers about peaches for Iowa, a sub
ject which has attracted a great deal of
attention from the fact that a larger
number of peaches •were grown In the
state than for many years. Another
subject is that of growing pecans in
Iowa. It is not generally known that
pecans are raised in this part of the
country, but the fact Is that there are a
large number of trees on an island in
the Mississippi not far from Clinton and
several good pecan orchards still fur
ther north. It Is also true that among
the crops of Iowa which might be enum
erated are peanuts, tobacco and sun
flower seed.
Des Moines labor unionists have noted
wl^h some pleasure that the Sioux City
labor unions have strongly indorsed A.
E. Holder, deputy labor commissioner,
for the position of chief of the bureau.
Holder Is the president of the Iowa
State Federation of Labor, and is very
popular with the labor union men here
as well as in Sioux City. He is a man
of courage and convictions, and he has
accomplished much good for the state
in his present positio-n, and could do
more as commissioner. But he has not
been pressing his claims very positively.
Inasmuch as the Des Moines labor
unionists are not agreed on anybody It
would not be hard for them to turn in
favor of Holder, especially if he is
strongly urged by the members of the
federation elsewhere in Iowa.
j'
It has been suggested that it is the
position of assistant adjutant general of
the G. A. R., department of Iowa, that
Col. L. M. Langstaff, of Dubuque, is af
ter, Instead of head of the state militia.
If so he would succeed George A. New
man, who will eventually become par
don secretary in the governor's office.

TOLLIVER IS CONVICTED.
Des Moines Man Found Guilty of Kill
ing Barney Rourke.
Des Moines, Dec. 7.—Charles A^
Tolliver, indicted on the charge ofi:
der in the first degree, was found ,ty
of manslaughter Friday afternoon, bl
liver struck and killed Barney 5" .*ke
several weeks and the grand "o In
dicted him a little later. His tV com
menced Monday and has ft .lnued
without interruption all of week.
Nearly two days were tak -P with
the arguments of the attoi... in- the
case. The Jury was sent out Friday
morning after County Attorney McLen
nan had made his argument and return
ed a verdict shortly before 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. In his instructions to the
jury Judge Prouty stated that the evi
dence would not justify them In return
ing a verdict of murder In the first de
gree, altho that was the charge in the
Indictment. A murder must be pre
meditated in order to be in the first de
gree. Seven forms of verdict were at
tached to the instructions, however, and
the jury had its choice between them.
They were as follows: Murder in the
second degree: manslaughter, wjiich the
jury finally agreed upon assault with

NEW NORTHWESTERN BRIDGE.
Double Track Bridge to Be Built Acrosa
the Mississippi at Clinton.
Clinton, Dec. 7.—The Chicago &
Northwestern has cleared the ground
in this side of the river preparatory to
beginning work on the new double track
bridge they are about to build across
the Mississippi river at this place. The
present bridge was built but four
years ago, but business has increased
so rapidly that the company is obliged
to dquble the bridge capacity. The total
length of the new bridge will be a little
less than a mile. The company owns
Little Rock Island, which lies just to
the east of the channel, which shortens
the bridge ar.d makes Its building eas
ier. All soundings have been made and
part of the material is already in place.
The building will take nearly-a year.
During the past year an average of a
train every twelve minutes, day and
night. Sundays andi all, is the record^for
the bridge.
A NEGLIGENT NURSE.
Poweahiek County's Smallpox Nurse
Allowa Patient to Eacape From Hos
pital and Neglects to Report to the
Authoritiea.
Grlnnell, Dec. 7.—About a week ago it
was discovered, when Mrs Thomas
Playle was taken to the detention hos
pital-, that her son who had been taken
there about ten days before, had' left the
hospital. George H. Bye was nurse in
charge of the hospital and altho Playle
had been gone two days and there Is di
rect telephonic communication with the
city Bye had not reported the occur
rence. He says Playle ran away and
has nothing to present in his own ex
tenuation. He Just failed to report it.
The moment It was discovered that
Playle had left a search was commenced
and within six hours Playe had been lo
cated. He had gone to the house of his
brother-in-law 'below Ewapt and there
he remained until arrested and brought
back.
Bye was immediately removed from
his position and George W. Davis en
gaged as nurse. Playle when he left the
hospital was past the worst run of
smallpox but by no means well. The
board of health Is seriously considering
the matter and action will probably be
taken against Bye. Should this be neg
lected a charge of carelessness on the
part of the board would rest in the
minds of Grlnnellltes. No one can- be
blamed for Bye's criminal negligence,
but he should be held to account for it
himself. When a community is out
raged In such a manner as it has been
in this case the offender should suffer.

PRAISE FOR COUSINS.
New Yorker Who Heard Speech on
Burns Compares Cousins to Inger
soil.
Washington, Dec. 7.—Congressman
Cousins of Iowa, is one of the most elo
quent men in congress the chief fault
»viih liim is thiu he Is sro seldom heard
from. In a set speech or oration, he has
few equals In the country, and probably
no superiors at least, that is the Judg
ment of men in public life In this city,
who are experts on this question. The
other day, over in New York, there was
a St. Andrew society banquet, on a
Burns anniversary. Mr. Cousins was
one of the speakers, but came on pretty
well down, the list. William C. Beer, of
New York, prominently connected with
one of the old line life insurance com^
panies there, was in Washington the
other day, and said a good many very
complimentary things about the Cousins
speech, and some of them are repro
duced below for the benefit of the gent
leman's many friends in Iowa:
"The bawiuet was one the greatest
ever given in Manhattan. The seating
capacity was taxed to Its limit of 400
and an annex was used for the over
flow, which was at least 300 more. An
drew Carnegie, in whose honor the af
fair was held, by reason of his gift of
$100,000 to the society as a fund for In
digent Scotchmen in this country, was
toastmaster, and a capital one he
proved.
"The young Iowan was called upon
at a time when there was much hub
bub and after several others had spok
en. He had uttered but a few sen
tences, not raising his voice, but with
mellow intonation that reached every
auditor, when suddenly that noisy and
crowded festive hall became still, like
the stillness of death. His theme was
the genius of Robert Burns, and he
spoke of the Ayrshire pqet in a fashion
of eloquence that can be likened only
to the speech of Robert Ingersoll at
his brother's grave. Every ear was
strained to catch the syllables that
came with such perfect coinage from
Cousins' lips. He used short, Anglo
Saxon words that fitted perfectly the
beauty of the statements. He carried
his hearers to Scotland and one coud
almost catch the smell of the heather,
and the notes of Bonnie Doon were
mixed with the perfume of the flowers.
It was, indeed, a masterpiece, and
when he had finished such a spontan
eous and overwhelming ovation as was
accorded him I never saw and never
expect to see again."
Mayor Rose Attacks Pattort.
Milwaukee. Dec. 7.—Mayor Rose at
tacked a committed of three ministers
who appeared before him at his own in
vitation to present their report on the
conditions of vice as found by them in
the city.
"The man that makes that state
ment," said the mayor to the committee,
referring to one of the allegations of the
report they carried, "is thf dirtiest and
most cowardly liar that ever stood in
shoe leather."
The mayor then told the ministers that
their report was an insult to him, called
one of the ministers a professional agi
tator, denied the existence of stall sa
loons and the thirty-two gambling
houses, impugned the ministers' motives
and ended the reception by bidding the
three to report to the ministers' asso
ciation that if they would take care of
their particular business he would take
care of that of the city.

Judge Dunne Discharges Chicago
America Editors in the
Contempt Case.
Holds They Had Bight to Libel
Court After Decision
Was Made.
Writ of Habeas Corpus Granted
in Case of Canfield and
Lawrence.
Chicago, Dec. 7.—Judge Dunne dis
charged Andrew M. Lawrence and H. T.
Canfield, editors of the Chicago Ameri
can, saying they were not guilty of con-*
tempt.
Lawrence is managing editor and
Canfield a reporter on the American,
and were sentenced" recently by Judge
Hanecy to forty and thirty days re
spectively in the county jail for con
tempt of court. In the contempt case
and the habeas corpus proceedings
which followed a great effort was made
by the American to secure an order for
quo warranto proceedings to compel the
People's Gas, Light and Coke Company
to show by what right they operated In
Chicago. Hanecy refused to allow the
quo warranto proceedings, and follow
ing the refusal the American printed ar
ticles and a cartoon strongly intimating
that the judge had been unduly Jnfly
enced and were he again to come up
for election he would discover the people
had no confidence in him. Judge Dnnne
granted the writ of habeas corpus today
on the grounds that the case which the
American commented upon had been
disposed of by Hanecy when he gave hia
decision from the. bench. Dunne, admit
ted the articles and cartoon were clear
ly calculated to Intimidate and coerce
the court, had the court already not ren
dered its decision. Proprietor Hearst
and\ Cartoonists Brlggs and Davenport
have not been within the jurisdiction ol
the court, and the contempt case is still
pending against them.
Judge Dunne admitted that the car
toon in evidence was probably libelous
and the articles uoaslbly so. Harsh
criticisms, Judge Dunne remained, is
one of the incidents and burdens ot
public life. "I see no reason," he said,
"why the judge should be offered a
different remedy for attacks in public
prints than the president, or governor,
or congressman. Criticisms of public
officials, if Just, will do good
if unjust will do no harm." In
concluding the court said: -1 ami
clearly of the opinion that the language!"
used in open court by Hanecy amounted
amounted! to a final order disposing oft
the case tinder consideration, and that
being a final order, under the doctrine
of 'Contempt' as laid down in this
state by our supreme court in Storey
vs. People, that the relators
had a
right to comment and criticize that de
cision, even to the extent of libelling
the honored and respected judge who
rendered the opinion, without exposing
themselves to prosecution for contempt
of court." Following is Hanecy's com-,
ment on Dunne's decision:
"Dunne had the power to so decide,
but'he did not have any right. Any
judge has the power to let every pris
oner out of the penitentiaries, but they
have not the right, nor does anybody,
expect they will."
