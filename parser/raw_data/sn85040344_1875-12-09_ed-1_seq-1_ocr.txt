SUPERIOR, DOUGLAS CO., WIS.. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1875.
Congress convened last Monday. Aside
Ironi the delivering of the President’s mes
sage and the election of a Speaker of the
House, nothing of importance, has transpired
in their session, thus far. Hon. Michael C.
Kerr, Democrat, of Indiana, was elected
Speaker of the House. The President’s
message is very lengthy, but able. Concern
ing it, The Pioneer-Press says;
ihe President's message wil be read with
universal interest. It lacks the grateful brev
ity of his previous messages, but this is due
to the prolix and tedious discussion of ques
tions ot international concern, which rnav be
•easonably ttinbuted to Mr. Pish, who stead
fusily and firmly upholds the traditional
hmg-windedness and verbosity of diplomatic
lingo for which his department is distinguish
ed. 'The President’s own portions of the
message, or what may be safely attributed to
him, a;e marked by a plain and unpolished
conciseness, directness, and force, which
attest their originality, and are devoted to
subjects ot tredier interest and of more
lively importance than Hie ordinary topics
of a President’s message. The first in the
order ot topics, and, perhaps, the most im
portant feature of tne message, is that in re
lation to the importance of preserving the
public school system of the United States,
in which he gives the country the final fruit
ot the meditations on this subject which
cropped out in his Des Moines speech.
Whether Blaine stole his thunder or Grant
lias stolen Blaine’s, it is difficult to say ; for
Grant’s ties Monies speech necessarily sug
gested and implied some constitutional safe
guard against the evils of ignorance and the
encroachment- of sectarian fanaticism; but
Blaine w.is sinewed enough to anticipate
the President’s message by proposing an
amendment to the constitution requiring
ail states to establish and support free
public sciio >ls, open to every sex, color, race
and religion, and prohibiting sectarian
teaching therein of any kind, or the use of
public moneys in the support ot sectarian
schools. 1 lie President adopts as his own
this specific proposition, and pernaps it was
so, ami lemls it the high sanction of the ex
ecutive recommend ition. On general prin
ciples it may always be regarded as an objec
tion l< ;.ny in.-si.- nrf .Lai it euiaiHort the
spheie of the Federal authority ; but this can
nardly be called a measure of that kind. It
impu.M/s unties of paramount importance on
Flute.-, which me inclined to neglect them,
ana u prohibits to me Ft aes that discrimi
nation in lavor of or against any religious
j-ect w hieii the national constitution now for
biUn within its own spiiere. We aie inclined
to tniiia that the President has taken effect
ual niea.'Uies to ludil his own prophesy, and
mat by pre.-enting this question in this foim, 1
no has made it the great question of the
lutuie.
Tue President’s views on the taxation of
church propeify are undoubtedly sound; bui
ias church pioperty consists mainly of real
i estate, it is not a subject of national but of
slate taxation, aim t lie question is obviously
one ol stale ami not ol national concern.
Passing to Mr. Kish’s part ot the message, it
i would not be candid to say that we are etiler
i laiued by his voluminous discussion of the
| Cuban question, though we quite concur in
his conclusions that the time has not come
for recognizing the independence of the Cu
! ban republic, or lor according it belligerent
I rights. .Nothing else of interest is devel
oped in his review of our foreign relations.
Ocean telegiuphy, naturalization and expa
triation, form the subjects of prolix argu-
I incuts and of some pertinent suggestions,
i The portion of the message which will be
j read with most interest, and which is of the
I most immediate practical concern, is that
which relates to the currency question. On
! this question the President speaks with no
I uncertian sound. His specific recommenda
| lions for expediting the resumption of spe
i cie payments and for the restoration of tue
| cunency to a sound and healthy basis are
| first, a repeal of so much of the legal tender
I act as makes these notes receivable for debts
j contracted after a certain date, say January
I Ist, IST7. Second, the redemption of the
; legal tender notes at the rate of $2,000,uu0
monthly by issuing in their stead a long 3.65
per cent, bond; and, third, an additional
accumulation of gold lor final redemption.
These recommendations, if carried out,
would certainly hasten the resumption ol
specie payments, but whether they are the \
best measures to that end, we are not now
prepared to express an opinion.
The intelligence of the country will grate-!
fully welcome the recommendation of the ,
President that the duty on tea and coffee be ■
restored. This suggestoin indicates a return
of the administration to sounder liseal views •
than those which i ave heretofore character-!
ized it, and the further suggestion that the?
£lB,oon,ouo*thus added to the revenue would I
enable Congress to remit the duties on manv
articles entering into manufactures is
another promising indication of the Presi
dent's progress ki the science at political
economy. Further comments on the message
must, however, be reserved for another time.

The Escape of Tweed
1 From the Pioneer-Press.
The escape of Tweed is a dis
grace to the whole country. It will
serve to confirm the growing popu
lar belief that in this country the
rich criminal?may safely defy, and
;in the end will always elude, jus
tice, that the ill-gotten wealth
which is accumulated by along ca
reer of fraud and public robbery,
is a resistless power which c/n gen
erally be employed with success to
defeat the ends of justice, either by
corrupting courts and legislatures
and even the popular suffrage itself,
or when these rosconrces fail by
bribing jailors, unlocking the doors
of the most cautiously guarded
prisons, and purchasing the means
and accomplices of concealment
! and flight. Tweed had succesfnlly
tried all these expedients in their
turn. For years he held his course
of public plunder with insolent im
punity. The legislature of New
\ orkjjl State, the city govern
ment and the judiciary were
filled with his venal tools; legisla
tion was controlled by systematic
bribery, the Courts were prostituted
to the service of this gigantic thief;
the elections were controlled by
fraud; and entrenched behind the
rampart ot money.bags which were
filled with the vast hoards of Jus
audacious robberies, he might safely
insult the indignation of the plun
dered people with the mocking defi
ance, ‘*\\ hat are yon going to do
about it
The tax-payers of New York
having at last emancipated them
selves by a unilid and desperate
ettort from the yoW<. of this, abomin
able tyrant and robber, undertook
to show him what they would do
about it. Such of his accomplices as
did not seek refuge in flight supplied
the needed evidence or his prodig
ious frauds and villainies, and in
the sniped jacket of a felon within
the cells of a prison, he has had
leisure to reflect on the unexpected
failure of the expedients on which
he had confidently relied lor defeat
ing the ends of justice, and with
the aid of the best legal talent
which his stolen wealth could pur
chase, to contrive new devices for
escaping the toils of the law. He
succeeded in having the cumulative
sentence against him set aside, in
baffling by a multitude of ingenious
devices the civil suit against him
for the restitution of his millions ol
stolen money, and pending anew
trial on the criminal issue, and in
being transferred to the pleasanter
abode and larger liberty of a prison
in New York where he could arrange
at his leisure lor his final triumph
over all the powers of the law and
of public justice by the simple ex
pedient of bribing his jailers.
That iiis flight was accomplished
with their aid and connivance there
can be no shadow of doubt. He
was taken by the deputy sheriff in
broad day to his own house and he
has never been seen since by any
body but his accomplices in his es
cape. It is safe to say that he is
ere this far beyond the reach of the
officers of the law who are hunting,
or pretending to hunt for him J n some
foreign country lie will revel in the
limits of his long career of public
robbery gmd mock ihe justice he
lias so long defied and finally baf
fled,, with his old jeer of insolent
defiance: What are you going to
do about it ?
Ix is said that Senator Sharon has
mortgaged over a half million 0 f

A Correspondent of The Cincin

paper, gives the following pictures
of the appearance m Washington
now : “The sights now seen here
daily and nightly, and all day and
all night are sickening and alarmin'* - .
I have seen drinkingni Washington
before, and hard drinking at that,
in saloons, at hotel bars, up in the
private rooms of boarders, down in
the basements of oyster shops, but
I never saw such gulping as I see
here now. The tiery flood is liter

sugar, without anythig to bate its

The Brooklyn Scandal Again.
Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, liav
* •/ /
big reconsidered its liasty action iu
dropping Deacon West, he testifies
his gratitude tor his restoration to
fellowship and fraternally invites
the congregation to join with him
m calling a mutual council to adju
dicate upon the questions now dis
turbing not only Plymouth Church,
but the denomination at large in
America, which he simplifies ami
condenses thus: “Is the Rev
Henry Ward Beecher guilty of adul
tery?” and “Is the Rev. H. W. B •
gu Ity of perjury ?” He says :
Such an investigation at the present time
is especially imperative, because our Church
is not unanimous in its belief in the inno
cence of the pastor, and this feeling of doubt
and addrehension is shared by thousands ol
Christian men and women throughout the
land. I make this proposition with the
hope that it may be the means of vindicating
the character of our pastor, and if this be
the result no one will rejoice thereat more
heartily than 1.
He hopes Plymouth Church will
meet him in the same spirit of frank
ness and affection that animates
him in making the proposition.

Secretary Chandler last week
Tuesday, removed fifteen clerks in
the Patent Office. The salaries ot
as many more will be reduced.
These reductions have been made
necessary from the fact that of SBO,-
000 of the contingent fund out of
which these clerks were paid, $50,-
000 have already been expended.
Tiie removals have no political sig
nificance.
