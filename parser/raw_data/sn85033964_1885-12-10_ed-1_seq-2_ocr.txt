"What fools we are," exclaims
Laps. McCord, at the outset of one
of his most sensible editorials in the
Pulaski Citizen, and there is noth
ing like a proper self-depreciatory
modesty as a fit accompaniment to

The "we" was intended to be un
derstood in its scatterative sense
and to include all others except the
writer.
Col. Robert Gates doesn't need to
explain. He has done and is doing
his work well and impartially. A
few fools show their temper and
lack of sense in criticizing him, but
the Dublic knows he is doing a
enlendid work for Tennessee. How
silly to scare up these little, bitter,
enitcful lealousies. i- ortunateiy our
visitors were sensible men and
know that there are but two of
these fools In Tennessee and they
are sorry.

Senator Harris Calls a Halt,
Senator Harris calls a halt on the
railroad wreckers in Tennessee, go
ing even further than most men in
the opposite direction. He is a
member of the senate committee on
inter-state commerce and they have
gone all over the country and sum
moned all classes of men to give
testimony before them, and now he
declares himself unable to solve the
question. What a difference! It
was held in Tennessee that three
ordinary men could be picked up
and placed over the railroads and
learn in a few weeks all the hidden
mysteries in the science of railway
management, and now comes the
tallest apostle of the tribe and says
he could not learn it in a search over
the whole country and in months of
patient study. The senator is sound
and wise in this. We suppose his
opinion now sounds the end of the
wrecking movement in Tennessee.
Hear him :
"When Ave first began our inqui
ry I made up my mind upon cer
tain points, and felt that I had the
correct solution of the whole mat
ter. Then I would meet some expe
rienced and practical railroad man
and in about ten minutes talk he
would take all the under pinning
out of my legislative structure, and
I'd feel all at sea again. Then I'd
start to build again, and about the
time I telt that I saw the proper
course to be adopted in settling the
question, the same thing would
happen again, until now I don't
feel as If I knew half so much about
the matter as when I first began
the investigation. The whole sub
ject is a bunch of complexities, and
as the railroad interest is such a
vast one as to aggregate one-fifth
of the whole wealth of the country,
any legislation affecting their in
terests must be very cautious.
Kates cannot be fixed by legisla
tion. What can be done is to say
that the roads shall publish their
rates and stick to them until they
are changed by due notice be
ing given. They will tend to break
up railroad wars, and will be bene
ficial to the companies as well as to
the patrons. Then the practice of
companies charging, in many cases,
more lor a short haul than for a
long haul must be prohibited, so
that in no case "the aggregate rate
for the long haul shall be less than
the rate to any intervening point on
the road. But, as I said before,
legislation must be very slow, so
that no mistakes be made. .
The President's Message.
It is an unusually long and
strong document that shows a
thorough acquaintance with ail the
details of government and a master
ly handling of them. The most
striking feature is his recommen
dation to suspend the coinage of sil
ver which will beget a Cght. He
urges a reduction of the tariff as the
platform indicated so as not to
criDDle the industries already in
operation and to protect the labor
er's wages. The following sentence
epitomizes his idea and is a powerful
declaration or right policy: "We
should deal with the subject in
such manner as to protect the in
terests of American labor which is
the capital of the workingmen : its
stability and proper remuneration
furnish the mort justifiable pretext
ior a protective policy?" He covers
every important question in all de
partments and is exhaustive in de
tail and suggestion. It was pub
lished only yesterday and we have
not bad time to condense it.
Wm. H. Vacderhilt Drops Dead.
The great millionaire Vander-
bilt dropped dead Tuesday wiii
paralysis due to the sudden burst
ing of a large blood vessel at the
base of brain, and death was instan
taneous and painless. It was about
2:30 o'clock and he was engaged in
an animated talk with Robert Gar
rett, tne railroad magnate, upon
business topics. The news spread
rapidly ana ot course occasioned
universal comment. A slight de

Mr. Tilden's Lector,
Mr. Tilden ha3 addressed a long
letter to Speaker Carlisle urging up
on congress the necessity Ior re
rebuilding our coast defenses. He
says they are totally inadequate to
withstand modern attack and that
as long as we remain thus weak for
eign countries will hear with dis
dain any demand we may have to
make and we thus put ourselves in
the way of being slighted or dam
aged; that we are practically una
ble to enforce the Monroe doctrine,
and that the present aggressive
grabbing of foreign countries and
sections by the powers of Europe
makes it necessary for us to pre
pare to defend that principle at any
moment. He says the spending of
this surplus in the treasury now
will throw tke money into trade
channels, will give work to thous
ands of men, and will boom the iron
interests which lie at the very bot
tom of the country's prosperity, and
thus trade revival ensues and the
country resumes at once normal
prosperity.
The Farmers Association
Met in the county court room
Saturday, the subject, Education of
farmers, was presented in an able
paper by Dr. Harwell in which he
showed that agricultural knowledge
should commence in the common
schools. T. O. Abernathy advocat
ed the estab'ishing of agricultural
colleges. Mr. S. P. White and oth
ers favored the dissemination of ag
ricultural knowledge to the masses
that could not bo reached by col
leges. The importance of better corn
culture and better commercial corn
was brought up. To encourage the
improvement and to find the best
varieties it was decided to have a
corn show at next meeting, the 3rd
Saturday in January, T. O. Aber
nathy offers a pure bred berkshire
pig worth MU for zo pest ears white
corn; the association $o in casa ior
second best. The corn shown to be
the property of the association after
shown. Tbe premiums are open
to every Giles county farmer. We
hope to see corn from every prt of
the county.

We fear that we will have a

foot to break the dull monotony of
the past season. We hope to hear
of otter preparations for Christmas

The good citizens of the 3d
and 4th districts have had the
pleasure of staying in your town for
the biggest part ot the last two
weeks that is, a large number of
them. Among them was your cor
reSTsoifdent and I think it will not
be amiss to tell something about
our stay with your kind people
The first thing we did after secur
ing a boarding house was to visit
the CitizN office and while there
we found that the Citizkn corps
was as nice and clever as their pa
er indicates them to be. There
were seven 6V f iaht of us all persis
tently inauisitive in asking what
everything was and what it was for
aad there was a definite answer to
every question (so far as we know).
The Etheopian who turns the press
asked one of our boys who was
standing near him to walk over and
raise a window that was opposite
from where he wm standing. The
visitor thought he would be polite
and walk over, but just as he got
within three or four feet of the
window there was something took
him about the middle of his abdo
men and knocked him back against
a candle and sinaed off all the hair
on one side of his head. He says
you arc very clever, but you keep a
negro and mule in y our office to
drive a fellow out when you get tir
ed of him. Then we retired to our
boarding house and went to bed
and were soon in a sound slumber.
We might have been sleeping until
now (as far as wc know) but there
was a heavy jar struck the house
and everybody thought there was
an earthquake: but we were reliev
ed when we heard some one hollow
out for a light so that he might fin
his way and found it to bo Bully
Hammonds. He had fallen down
the second flight of stairway of our
boarding house. It is not Dccessa-
ry for us to tell why we were in
town. But we wi'l answer the
question through the Citizen that
ha3 been asked several times. That
is, win the noted Jones leud cause

The Mutual Endowment Collapse.
Considerable unnecessary "boo"'
has been made over a very small
affair in Pulaski during the past
week. The reader remembers the
novice the Citizen made two weeks
ago of a peculiar plan of mutual
insurance being worked in Pulaski
by Col. J. T. Whitehead. He wrote
up some $150,000 here and collected
from about twenty persons about
$200. The day after he left a tele
gram in the daily papers announced
the collapse of the company at Ft.
Worth, Texas. Some of our peo
ple thought they had been swin
dled and Mr. Skillern followed Col.
Whitehead to Birmingham. lie
found that the news of the break
was a greater surprise to Col.
Whitehead than to us. He came
back on the aext train ard made
satisfactory settlement with the
parties here. He had sent the mon
ey to the campany but it had not
received it before the break and it
wiil be returned to him, and his
proposition to pay back halt the
mo'iey in five days and the balance
in fifteen days was accepted. At a
full meeting of the applicants Tues
day night, a resolution was passed
exonerating Col. Whitehead from
any motive to swindle, so far as
they know, and declaring that in
all his conduct and dealings here
he appeared to be a gentlemsn.
The company, it seems, was divide i
into sections that operate in differ
ent states. It was the Texas sec
tion that failed and it is claimed
that the others are sound. There
were many absurb, exaggerated and
amusing rumors afloat. It was in
ferred in Nashville aud elsewhere,
from the American's reports, that
it was a kind of marriage associa
tion affair and that our people were
taken in and severely done up by a
sharper that it was a kind of prov
idential visitation on Pulaski for
her marriage association sins. At
Murfreesboro it was thought he got
away with several thousand dollars
and the writer heard our people
made the butt of many cruel jibes
and derisive criticisms. Psow that
the affair has petered down :to
ordinary dimensions and a satisfac
tory settlement i3 promised, the sen
sational glamour with which it was
painted, fades into tallow-candle
tint. Columbia will not do so well.

V.Iiiu;jton Letter.

ly, because o: his uncalled for decision
during the last preeidcntial connt."
Senator Edmunds h Id that the presi

"Whether right or wrong," continued

There is a marked contra-t between

is on duty in' lar away Turkey. Mr.
Springer is enthusiastic over his plan
for revising the house rules, and tho
distinguished hud of the appropria

There is a gra iual removal of the re

IN MEMOKIAM.
It is with a Bid heart that we attempt
to offer a tribute to the memory of our
esteemed trietd, Miss Susan Exine
Barnes, who departed this life on
Wednesday m rning, Dec. 2nd, altera
protracted, ami very painful sickness
consumption at her home at Lester's
station, Tenn. Miss Susie had just
readied the ;ge of womanhood, and
twelve month' ago bid fair for a long
life. Anattaiicof measles last spring
was almost he first sickness, but it was
soon realized lhat she ''was never to
be well uuy more," and slowly but
surely the woi ic of death was done. On
Thursday her remains were deposited
in Maplewood cemetery in the presence
of a nur.iJier of sorrowing mends and

Broken Bones.
"I know a man whose bones are al

man," continued the speaker, "who
kicl.ed at a ui'g and broke his thigh.

A Forty Years Sall'orer Cured.
As a specific cure for transient or
chronic Piles, C. C. C. has worked
marvelous cures. Among them is Mr.
Shields, of Oak wood, Texas, who had
piles for forty years. He had utterly
despaired ot being helped by medical
aid, abandoned all labor, aud tfie past
year was subject to fearful spasms, by
which his body was drawn into contor
tions. On one occasion of his sufler
ings, Col. Manning, a Iriend and dis
tinguished citizen, happened to be pres
ent, sent lor the C. C. O. medicine, and
it was applied, giving instant relict.
Mr. Shields was before not able to walk
or ride, hut alter using the C. C. C.
medicine for one week he was out at
tending to business as usual. He is now
free from the effects ot the I'Mes, and
coiryiJcrs the C. C. C. the grandest med
icine of the age.
