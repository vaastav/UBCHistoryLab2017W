Secretary Harlan to Leave the Cabinet—
Smuggling on the Frontier
—Decisions in Regard to Bounties.
.: m
,.
Nkw York, Dec. 4. The Herald special
says: Mr. Harlan. Secretary of the Interior,
has commenced his preparations to secure
his election to the United States Senate.
This indicates that he intends to leave the
Cabinet at no distant day. It has been the
impression here for some time pustthat Mr.
Harlan is the only member of the present
Cabinet not In full accord with the Presi
dent. Collectors on the frontier report that
sin utters, who have been so active, aro
becoming alarmed at the preparations made
to Hpprehend them, and that the business is
falling off. Merchants along the linn, both
in the Suites and Canada, are shutting tip
their shops and suspending operations;
Hence the Revenue otllcers inaugurated the
system of closely examining theclnthlng of
females who cross the frontier. That clatta
of travel is falling oil; not one woman
crosses tho St. Lawrence now where
twenty did before. .
The 2d Comptroller has decided that In
the case of a soldier detailed as a clerk in'
the War Department, payment of bounty
maturing while on Buch service cannot be
maile, a extra pay is received for extra du
ty of this kind. ;. ' ,.
. It is also decided, under the same author-'
Ity, that soldiers who entered the Veteran '
Reserve Corps under provisions of Guneral
Order No. 191, of June 25, 18(14, is not en
tl led to any installment bounty maturing
when serving as clerk In any department,
hut if discharged with all the men of his
regiment, because Government no longer1
requires the service of their entire term of
enlistment, he maintains the same footings'
and rights in regard to bounty claims as
ertain to the balance of the members of
the same regiment. : -. . r.
Organization of Congress.
i New YouK,Dec.4.-TbeTrlbu:!e'8Special
says' The Senate will convene to-day at
12 o'clock, await the organization of the
House, and adjourn. A Senatorial caucus
jWill then bo held, to prepare lists of c'om
.mittees. . With what temper the resolution.
io f the House caucus, raising a joint stand
ingcommittee upon the admission ot South
fern members, will be received, Is not en
tirely known. Some Senators, approving,
the spirit and intent of the resolution, are'
jealous of any infringement of thd rights
ol the twe bodies, under the Constitution, to
regulate admissions to their respective or
ganizations. There is no doubt of com
bined action, but the passage of a resolution
by the House affixing conditions to mcm
bctviuip in the Senate, and vice verba, is so
suggestive of irregularity, If not inconsist
ency, that it is thought possible, by influ
ential persous . in both branches of the
National Legislature, that similar though
separate committees may be raised in lieu
of tbe joint committee.
The House will meet at the usual hour
and go through with the form of organiza
tion without delay.
The several caucus nominees, and espe
cially door-keepers, have had little time tor
their devotions to-day, so Incessantly and
Importunate have brn the place-seekers.
These candidates are from the heroes of
many battles to the widow's son, who wants
to be a page, and their name is legion.
Alter organizing, the House will adjourn
