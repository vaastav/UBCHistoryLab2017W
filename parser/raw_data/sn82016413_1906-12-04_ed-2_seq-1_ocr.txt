Charge Against Peacock
Dismissed Because
Of Error
IlliL OF 01HEIS
AWtSIED IS POSTPONEB
HEADS OF FIRM8 BROUGHT INTO
COURT ON WARRANTS IS
SUED AGAINST COR
PORATION8 An error In tho manncr of making
out and serving tho warrant against
V. C. Peacock & Co., charging that
firm with selling adulterated liquor re
sulted In tho dismissal of tho chargo
against tho head of tho firm, W. C.
Peacock, In Poltco Court this morning.
Attorneys Drcckons and Ashford rep
resented tho defenso In tho cases
against Peacock, Cho Hut Hln and
Sing I.oy.
- When Cho Hut Hln's case was call
ed Ashfo'rd Immediately moved that
the defendant bo discharged from cus
tody on tho ground thcro was no war
rantHacalnst. him. Tho warrant on
v.hlchho wss arrested was sworn out
against the wing Chung Lun Co., and
the attorneys for tho dofensa claimed
that tho arrest of one of the supposed
raombors of, 'tho .firm was, Illegal.
"Thora Is no charga'agalnst this man,"
said Asbfbrd, and ho Is not hero by
due ptricess of law. Wo demand that
he berclcSBCd.
Ahdnulb opposed tho motion on the
ground ;tbat Che nut Hln was not yet
charged before tho court. Judgo Whit
ney continued lho case until tomor
row. In tho caso against W. C. Peacock
tho same arguments wcro advanced,
but with better success for the de
fense. Brcckons argued that Peacock
was Illegally arrested slnco tho war
rant was directed against tho corpora
tion of which Peacock was supposed
to bo lho president. "Thcro 1b a way
In which tho corporation may be
brought Into court on such a chargo,"
he said, "but a singlo member of lho
firm cannot bo tried for an offciiso
committed by the firm."
Andrade did not strongly oppose tho'
motion for dismissal In this csbc, hav
ing apparently come to the conclusion
that nothing could bo gained by trying
the case In lis present form. It In
probable that new warrants, not opn
to tho same objections, will be Issued.
Harry Jucn and Joe Clark did not
have tho samo excuse, of being only
co-partners In a firm, and will prob
ably have to stand trial. Both asked
for a continuance In order to obtain
counsel, and their cases were contin
ued. Clark's caso was set for Decern
ler 18 aud Juen'a for tho 12th.
Sing I.oy, charged with tho samo of
fense, was also represented by Brcck
ons and Ashford, who entered a pica
of not guilty and demanded Immediate
trial. Andrade objected .on tho ground
tLat the prosecution was not ready,
and Judge Whitney set the case for

Several Business Men Are

Plan
YODNI DECLINED OFFEI
TO BUY BIS CONCEtN
WILL DO ONLY A REPAIR AND
AQENCY BUSINESS IN HORSE
LESS VEHICLES BUT NOT
LIVERY TRADE
A movement Is on foot to start a new
garage. The only business of this kind
now In operation Is that belonging to
Alexander Young, but It Is thought that
tho large number of automobiles In tho
city will Justify the cstAbllshlng of a
rival concern. It has not been quite
settled as yet, whothcr tho proposition
will bo carried through, but the matter
Is being looked up carefully, and It Is
expected that In tho near future, a
definite decision will bo made.
One of those who havo tho matter
in hand, stated this morning that no
dcflnllo arrangements had been made
nss yet, but admitted that the proposi
tion had been taken up.
"Wo will. It wo decide to enter Into
the business at all, merely take tip the
repair and agency business," he
said. "We will -noVdoWiy
livery work, as wo do Hot
think It pays. If you do livery busi
ness with cheap machines, you aro
continually having trouble-with thciu,
and If you use expensive cars, you tie
up too much capital.
"We proposed at first to buy out the
Alexander Young garage, but Young
would not sell. Ho would not even
Rive us a figure. Ho said that ho be
lieved that he must run the garago In
connection uith tlic Youn; Hotel.
"We will, If we go Into the ,mi;.nc;js.
begin with a rented building for our
garago. We have at present In view
tho Stock Yards building and another.
"The entire proposition Is still un
settled, and tho negotiations regarding
It are still pending. However, there
nre now over n hundred machines In
this city, and we bellovo that there
would bo sufficient business for a new
concern, If It wero started."
The Bulletin's Informant would
not give out the nltnes otv4tbobc
who arc associated with him In the
proposition. He stated that he did not
feel Justified In doing bo at the present
time.

Captain Shotton, however, denies mlsslonor expressed himself as satis
that the investigation was Into tl.e fled th;t thcro was no ground for corn-
matter of tho stowaways. Ho denies,
also, that he had any stowaways. Ev

Bevcraof the other officers of tho

which the Portuguese Government re
quires them- to have. Soma of the
men sailed surreptitiously to avoid
having to aervo their terms In the ar

climbed aboard the steamer at' night,
coming up tho chains. So many o(
tbcm wcro there who attempted to
board tho ship In this manner that at
Bt. Michaels It was necessary to sta
tion a gnat it all around the rail to
keep them uif. As It was, many of
them succeeded In getting aboard. Tha
women who had no passports managed
to get aboard by coming In with other
families, and In tho confusion they es
caped detection.
It was not to escape paying their
passage that any of them atowed away,
as that waa provided by tho Planters'
Association but because of Inability to
obtain leavo from their Government to
depart. As their passage was provid
ed for, Captain Shotton may be tech
nically correct in saying there were
no stowawaya aboard, and yet not b(
giving a correct Impression. Several
of the officers under hlmvempbstlcally
state that there were stowaways oa

Captain Shotton states that the In
quiry thla morning at which his pres
ence was required by Commissioner
Sargent waa partly Into tho treatment
of the Immigrants during the voyage.
