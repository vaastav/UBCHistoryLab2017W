Arbitration Treaties Indorsed
in Philadelphia Mass Meeting.
TAFT'S MESSAGE CHEERED
Senator Sutherland Answers Objections
to the Conventions.
HENRY WATTERSON HEARD
Resolutions Adopted by Pennsylvania
Conference on International
Arbitration.
Pfl 11..\ DKLPHIA, nefrniher 14. ?In a
great mass meeting: held in the interests
of universal peace and the arbitration of
all international difficulties many rhiladelphlans
and distinguished visitors from
all over the state and from many parts
of the United States voiced their sentiments
against the needless waste and
havoc of war last night in the Academy
it Music. United States Senator Theodore
R. Burton presided# and aroused the en- ?
thusiasm of the delegates by his short in- '
troductory speech. ,
A message from President Taft indors- >
ing the meeting and praising the work '
^f the Pennsylvania Conference on In- ,
lernational Arbitration, which is holding
ts convention here, was read by Senator 1
Burton and received with cheers by the j
iudience, who seemed to appreciate the
President's great work for International
trbitration, the most signllleant and com- '
>rehensive features of which are the new ,
English and French arbitration treaties
vith the United States.
Sutherland Indorses Treaties. i
Senator George Sutherland of Utah, *i
vho made the principal address of tiic j
vening. indorsed the peace treaties beween
the United States, Rngland and t
"Vance, and said that without hesitation "j
le would give them his entire support. ^
le said, in part.
"We are informed that the Senate is 'j
>eing nefariously inveigled into a dele- J
ration of its treaty-making power to a !
oint high commission and that we are J
n darfger of agreeing to arbitrate some ]
[uestions of which we alone should ad- t
udge ftnd some which are subject only
o the ancient and honorable remedy of *
vager by battle. I am not impressed by ^
ither contention, and I shall, without
he slightest hesitation, as a member of ;
he, committee on foreign relations and
is a member of the Senate, vote for the 'j
at Ideation of the treaties precisely as *<
hey are written. I venture to say, J
vith all proper deference to those who j
hink otherwise, that the delegation of j
he treaty-making power is not in any ^
espect involved. ^
"But we are told that unless we amend ^
he proposed treaties we may be com- <
tn n rhitra to tho Mnnrno nnotrinp -
ixty-flve years old. In this connection
dr. Donnelly's report says: 1
"There are employed in the government 1
minting office more than 1130 persons <
ihove the age of sixty-five, and it would

rhls could be equitably accomplished 1
hrough the adoption of a plan which
Mould in effect' amount to an annuity to
aeh employe upon arriving at the age of
etirement or upon becoming disabled.
"The basis of such annuities should be
ength of service and the saiary or wage ,
-eceived during their employment, which
in the case of those who have been in 1
the service for many years would meet '
their ordinary requirements during the '
remainder of their lives. Such a plan 1

Justiciable Questions.
"1 must not take the time to enter this
leld of discussion further than to say
hat there does not seem to me to he the
illghtest danger of any such contingency.
Jnder the terms of the treaties I do not
(ee how these questions can be said to be
usticiable. and as it will require the content
of at least two out of three of our
>wn citizens who will be members of the
ommission before any such question can
>e held justiciable and therefore subject
o arbitration, the chance of our being:
ailed upon to submit any matter of thl^
and is so remote as to be practically impossible.
Neither am I alarmed over the
laim that we may be compelled to subnit
questions affecting the national
tonor." v
Appeals to Beason.
"It would seem that a measure of pubic
benefit such as the arbitration trea:ies
negotiated by our government with
he governments respectively of England
md France would call for little urging
jpon intelligent Americans," said Col.
Henry Watterson. "In England and in
France there is no dissent whatever. But
here, owing to the perversity of some and
:'ne indifference or ignorance of many, or:anization
is required, a campaign of eduation
and an appeal to reason.
"I grew to manhood under the joekeyng
subterfuge for valor known in its
Jay as the <-ode of ' honor. it was the
>ff spring of unmanly vanity. When real
war came, not one of the professional
luelists made his mark as a good sol1i*?r
"
Representative Martin \V. T.lttleton also '
spoke in favor of the treaties. |

Everybody loved that old-fashioned
lady. Arid i tind almost every one past
forty has, at the oack of h s mind, viv.d
impressions regarding her and the social
life of which she was the center. One
I remembers the atmosphere of that day as
one remembers the blush roses and spicy
pinks of old gardens. Even yet there ar?
gardens where blush roses grow, and I
know some women not yet old, and a few
young girls, whose mere presence aerv- s
today to reproduce that atmosphere. She
was dauntless and sweet, that old-fashioned
lady; witty hut tender; as notable
a housewife as a hostess; full of gentle
concern for others, with a mind ever at
leisure for their affairs, and a heart
whose sympathy was instantaneous in
their service She stimulated and sit*
soothed. Fine, eomplicated and Interesting
as the old lace and finely wrought
gold she del'ghted to wear, she was a
very precious piece of porcelain. Th*
brilliant, soft daguerreotype that has pre

the intimate secret of her Influence
was the impression she save of one whose
heart is fixed. one whom the world can
no longer harm.
