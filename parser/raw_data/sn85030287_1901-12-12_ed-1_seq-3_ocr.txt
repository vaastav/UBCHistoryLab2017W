GHIFFEF8 MHDRL REPORT.
Excellent Foundation Laid Without
Undue Harshness.
HUMANITY OF THE TROOPS.
Washington, Dec 9. In his first an
nual report General Chaffee sums up
the situation in the Philippines from a
military point of view by stating that
the provinces of Batangas and Laguna,
in Luzon, and the islands of Samar,
Mindora, Cebu and Bohol constitute
the area now disturbed by any em
bodied force of insurgents. He says
that to the physical character of the
country, to the nature of the warfare
of the rebels, who are amigo and foe in
the self same hour; to the humanity of
the troops, which is taken advantage of
by rebels and the inhabitants who
sympathize with them, and to the fear
of assassination on the part of the
friendly disposed, if they give informa
tion to the American forces, is due the
prolongation of the guerilla warfare.
"The withdrawal of interference
with civil affairs does not contemplate
withdrawal of the troops from their
stations to any considerable extent; on
the contrary this should not be done
hastily, and when undertaken, should
be gradual and more in the nature of
concentration than reduction of force
or abandonment of any considerable
area of territory."
On the subject of the military gov
ernment of the city of Manila General
Chaffee says:
"In the government of Manila for
three years, if the military have done
nothing more, it is everywhere appar
ent that an excellent foundation has
been laid and a turbulent and hostile
community brought to observe the
laws and individually be orderly; this
has been done without any undue
harshness or severity of treatment of
the inhabitants."
lie recommends that a permanent
post be constructed at once in the vi
cinity of Manila for a garrison of two
squadrons of cavalry, two batteries of
artillery and two full regiments of in
fantry, together with a hospital and
store house, the whole to be under the
command of a Brigadier General.
German Labor Bureau.
Berlin, Dec. 3. The anti-Chamberlain
excitement is subsiding. The
students of Erlangen and Strassberg
declined to take action in a demonstra
tion against the British colonial secre
tary, taking the ground that his
utterances were not important enough
to injure the German army.
The government has decided to es
tablish a bureau of labor statistics,
apparently similar to the one at Wash
ington. Simpson Appointed
Washington, Dec. 7. The president
Bent to the senate the nomination of
James M. Simpson, to be collector of
internal revenue for the district of
Kansas.

was not surprised by the appointment
of Simpson to succeed him; that he had
resigned the position three months ago.
Sutton will go back to the practice of
law at Dodge City.

Washington, Dec 4. Representative
Long has introduced a bill for a public
building at Hutchinson to cost 8100,000,

Active Times In Philippine.
Manila, Dec 7. Advices from Catba
logan, capital of the island of Samar,
report that the insurgent, Gen. Lukban,

render with Gen. Smith. To this offi

passed.

gling supplies to the insurgents. All

Remedy For San Jose Scale.
Washington, D. C, Dec 9. The offi
cials of the agricultural department (in
cluding Secretary Wilson, are gratified
to know that they have discovered a
sure remedy for the ravages of the
troublesome little San Jose scale, an
insect which has done vast damage to
fruit trees in all parts of the country,
and that there will soon be under ac
climatization and propagation in the
United States a lady-bird beetle im
ported from China, which devours the
San Jose scale in great numbers.
Abridging Right to Tote.
Washington, Dec 5. Representative
Dick (Ohio) introduced a resolution for a
general investigation of- the denial or
abridgement of the right to vote in
certain states, with a view to reducing
the congressional representations from
Buch states. The resolution recites
that "it is a matter of common infor
mation and belief that the rights of
some male citizens, being 21 years of
age, to vote at elections is denied and
abridged in certain states." The reso
lution is short and to the point.
Will Give Required Bond.
Topeka, Dec 3. Governor Stanley
has received a letter from G. Whiting
Swayne, agent of the New York
Orphans' home, who lately took a
dozen orphans to Ellis county in viola
tion of the state law, stating that his
institution is ready to comply with the
statute and give bond that the children
will not become public charges.. His
letter has been referred to Henry Allen,
chairman of the State Board of Chari
ties, who - has been conducting an
investigation. .. -
SENATORS ON ANARCHY. -
McComu And Hoar Mention Plana to
Control It.
Washington, Dec 7. Senator Mix
Comas (Md.) made an extended and
carefully prepared speech in the senate
with Anarchy for his theme and was
followed by some brief remarks by Mr.
Hoar (Mass.) on the difficulties in the
way of dealing with Anarchist assasJ,
sins. Mr. McComas spoke of the dan
gerous spread of Anarchy. President
Carnot, Prime Minister Canovas, the
Empress of Austria, King Humbert and
President McKinley having been foully
assassinated by Anarchists within the
last seven years. It was humiliating
he said, to consider the impotency of
our Federal laws to punish this fearful
crime. He argued that international
comity called for action on our part to
suppress the origin of plots in this
country against foreign rulers. Mr.
McComas was accorded close attention
throughout his remarks.
Senator Hoar (Mass.) said the great
difficulty in all these cases of assassina
tion was that the assassin was willing
and anxious to give up his life. Fear
of consequences did not in any way
deter such an assassin. Every assassin
of a foreign ruler had expected early
and certain death. The Senator be
lieved that a much more effective
remedy could be secured if by common
consent of all civilized nations some
tract of land somewhere on the earth's
surface, hemmed in from the outer
world, could be set aside for the con
finement of those who counseled the
killing of rulers or the overthrow of
governments.
Train Rolled Down SOO Feet
Vancouver, B. C, Dec 9. As a
Canadian Pacific freight train was pro
ceeding east at a slow rate around a
dangerous curve 400 feet above the
Frazer river, Engineer Randall sud
denly came upon a rick slide, scarcely
fifty yards ahead of him. A signal was
given to the brakeman, and the engine
was reversed but it was too late. The
train was scarcely going five miles an
hour, but the heavy train behind piled
the engine on the rocks and before the
engineer and fireman could jump, the
engine rolled over and over 300 feet
down the sheer bluff toward the river.
Engineer Randall and Fireman 1'ortufT
were crushed to death beneath the en
gine. Three caas were wrecked, going
over the bank after the engine.

ciation also to be held at Denver July

Washington, D. C, Dec 9. Repre
sentative Crumpacker (Ind.) has intro
duced a bill for an amendment to the
apportionment act so that the member
seip of the house will be 372. The rep

mont Smith of Kinsley will introduce a
bill in the next legislature providing
for the creation of a fund by the state
to insure depositors from loss by bank
failures. The fund will be raised by a
tax on the banks. Speaking- of his pro
posed measure. Senator Smith said: A
tax of one-fifteenth of 1 per cent per
annum on the average deposits of the
national banks for the past 37 years
would have made good all the losses to
depositors from failures of those banks.

L TREATY RE
Two Senators Find Fault But
Voted For It.
ARTICLE 8 OF OLD TREATY.
Washington, Dec 9. The semate
committee on foreign relations voted to
report favorably the new Hay-Paunce-fote
treaty providing for the construc
tion of an Isthmian canal.
The committee went over in detail
the provisions of the convention. No
votes were cast against it, but it was
criticised very sharply by Senators
Money and Bacon, who found in it
many of the objections which they
urged against the old treaty. The con
tention was made that the effect of the
treaty as sent to the senate would be
to deprive the United States of control
of the canal in case of war. Especial
ttention was called to the provision
in the preamble of the pending treaty
reserving article 8 of the Clayton-Bul-wer
treaty from the repeal provision of
he new treaty. The portion of this
article of the old treaty to which
especial objection was made reads as
follows:
In granting, however, their joint
protection to any such canals or rail
ways as are by this article specified, it
is always understood by the United
States and Great Britain that the par
ties constructing or owning the same
shall impose no other charges or condi
tions of traffic thereupon than the
aforesaid governments shall approve of
as just and equitable; and that the
isame canals or railways, being open to
the citizens and subjects of the U. S.
and Great Britain on equal terms,
shall also be open on like terms to the
citizens and subjects of every other
state which is willing to grant thereto
such protection as the United States
and Great Britain engage to afford.
Not Authenticated.
New York, Dec 7. Unauthenticated
specials from Washington say that
Rear Admiral Schley has been found at
fault on five counts by the court of in
quiry. First For the delay of the flying
squadron off Cienfuegos.
Second For misrepresentation of the
reason for returning to Key West to
coal.
Third For disobedience to orders in
making the retrograde movement.
Fourth For failure to destroy the
Colon.
Fifth For conduct unbecoming an
officer in the Schley-Hodgson contro
versy. Trouble Over Universities.
Vienna, Dec 9. After a debate of
nine hours duration, the lower house of
the Reichsrath has rejected an urgency
motion for the establishment of a uni
versity for the sonthern Slavs.
The demands for national universi
ties" are a feature of the obstructive
tactics of the various political parties
of the house. The motion was opposed
by the minister of education, who prom
ised, however, to support any practi
cable proposals for the intellectual de
velopment of the various nationalities
of Austro-Hungary.
Gates Goes to California.
Topeka, Dec 5. Rev. George E.
Gates, of Wyoming, has notified the
trustees of Washburn college that he
cannot accept the presidency of that
institution. He will accept the presi
dency of Pomona college in California.

minister, will likely be elected presi
dent. He was recently elected field
secretary.
Ferry Boat Sunk.
San Francisco, Dec. 3. The ferry
boats San Rafael and Sauselito collided
in the bay off Alcatraz island in a dense
fog. Ths San Rafael had about 200
passengers on board. It is thought
that most of the passengers were saved,
and that the loss of life was not very
great. Many of the passengers escaped
in life preservers.
The San Rafael was struck amid
ships, sinking immediately. A large
number of passengers were rescued by
ropes from Alcatraz island.
The Great Cattle Show.
Chicago, Dec 4. The International
Livestock Exposition was formally
opened here before an appreciative
throng that crowded the Dexter Park
amphitheater. Mayor Harrison, Secre
tary of Agriculture Wilson and Gov
ernor Yates, spoke. A parade of prize
winning horses and a concert preceded
the speech making.
Mayor Harrison delivered the address
of welcome
Secretary Wilson was greeted with
loud applause.
To Dam the Underflow.
Denver, Dec 9. According to James
A. Davis, industrial agent of the Santa
Fe road, all that Kansas need do to get
the full current of the Arkansas river
is to build a dam reaching down to bed
rock to catch the underflow. His theory
is that the water, spread on the soil
by Colorado irrigators, flows along
under the soil through Kansas.
F. B. Keon is building an immense
dam at Great Bend to cost $200,000, for
the purpose of irrigating a large tract
of land.
' Owners of Buildings Liable.
Topeka, Dec 7. Assistant Attorney
General West has rendered an opinion
to the effect that owners of buildings
ean be held liable for fines imposed
against joints. Judge West says:
"It is my opinion that a lien on a
building for the fine of an occupant.
convicted of violating the prohibitory
law, will hold good, providing the own
er was aware of the violation of the
law, either actually or constructively.
or was in possession of sufficient facts to
suspect that the law was being violated.
Within a Million Dollars.
- Washington, Dec 5. The cabinet
discussed the insular decision of the
,snpreme court. Secretary Gage ex
pects that it will be within one million
dollars. He called attention to the
fact that the great bulk of the imports
from the Philippines were admitted
.free of duty under onr general tariff
laws, notably hemp, which is one of
the leading staples of the islands. The
present tariff now in operation in the
Philippines, Mr. Gage thinks, will need
little or no revision. '.

Muslo for Anarchy.
Goldwin Smith says the best way to
eliminate anarchy from the land Is to
give more time in the public schools
to the teaching of music. It appears
to be the theory of the professor that

instrument never commits murder, but
he ignores the frequency with which
singers and musicians tempt other
folks to shoot or throw a brick.

One on the Bishop.
Among the many good stories told ot
the new bishop of London is the fol
lowing: One day, in the East End, he
noticed a dirty little urchin playing
beside the gutter. "Hello, my little
man," said the bishop, who is very
fond of children, "what are you doing
here?" "Making a kerfreedral," was
the reply. "A cathedral," exclaimed
his lordship, "but where's the bishop?"
Dr. Ingram's sense of humor, always
keen, was quite overcome when the
small boy answered, "Please, sir, I
ain't got dirt enough to make a
bishop.'

Austrian poets who are fond of sing

for a whole year, giving to his studies
an hour every morning. The result ol
these observations was that he found
the water to be brown 11 times; yellow

green 25. greenish gray 69, other shades
of green 110, and that it never had

Physicians Much Interested.
Northport, Mich., Dec. 9. The medi
cal men are just now eagerly discuss
ing a most remarkable cure of a severe
case of Kidney Disease In this county.
Mr. Byron O. Leslie of Northport has
for years been a victim of kidney de
rangements, with all the consequent
pain and annoyance. He was gradual
ly growing worse and as the disease
advanced he became very despondent,
often wondering if he would have to
endure this suffering all his lifetime.
But at last he found a remedy that
cored him in Dodd's Kidney Pills. He
was much pleased, but did not say
much about it lest the good effect he
experienced would not last. Now,

The human body Is like a delicately adjusted machine.
Then a part is worn out, or through abuse becomes rusty, it
affects the whole system. The kidneys and liver are among the
most important of all the organs in the body. When they get
out of order the entire system suffers. Keep them running
smoothly and good health follows.
McLean' j Li-Ver
and EJdney' 'Balm
will regulate these organs and keep them in perfect health.
Years of use in thousands of families have proved Its value In all
troubles affecting the liver and kidneys.
If your back aches; If your head aches;
If you lack ambition; If you are easily tired and went sat;
It means your kidneys are out of order. Buy a bottle to-dty at
your druggist's. It may save you useless suffering.
