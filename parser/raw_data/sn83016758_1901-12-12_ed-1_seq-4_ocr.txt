JOHN CHINAMAN must pay an indi
vidual assessment of one dollar to
fipht the re-enactment of the Chinese
exclusion act. John might as well
keep his money.
PROM the way the war department
distributed that pri7e money for the
sinking of Cervera's fleet, one would
infer that there was considerable gross
favoritism in that department, which
is evidently controlled by a lot of con
temptible officials who lack American
spirit and fairness The rascals should
be fired. Sampson gets $25,797.44 and
Schley $149.53. Is that so? Well you
ean-'t buy the applause of the American
people for no $25,797.44, eh!
HE State superintendent of public
instruction has notified one of thethese
school officials of Pierz, in Morrison
county, that repeating the Lord's
prayer in the public schools is in viola
tion of Sec. 16, Article I, of the State
Constitution, which decision was made
by H. W. Childs, as attorney-general,
in 1895. Minnesota school children
must worship the text books and black
boards and let it go at that.
IN speaking of President Roosevelt's
message, the London Spectator says
there is the moral vigor of a Cromwell
in President Roosevelt, and adds: "We
are convinced that President Roosevelt
is going to play a great part and a good
part if he continues his work in
therather
spirit which inspires this remarkable
sermon. He will prove the most sweet
ening influence in the whole lump of
American civil life that has been
known for many years."
HE UNION closes its twenty-fifth
year of publication with this issue. It
has passed the quarter post of the cen
tury run and is now headed for the
half. As this edition passes out of the
UNION office into Uncle Sam's big
sacks, and a few papers are filed away
for future reference, the quarter cen
tury's work is finished, there is but a
moment's reflection, the types com
mence to click again and life's story of
io\e and hate, of woe and sadness and
loy and gladness is told again
MINNESTOA congressmen fared very
\ell in committee appointments at the
hands of Speaker Henderson. Fi\eof
the seven members get chairmanships,
i-ddy gets mines and mining, Fletcher
expenditure on public grounds and
ouildings, Heatwole printing, McCleary
library committee, and Tawney expo
sitions. Morris retains his place on
ri\ers and harbors and is the Minneso
ta member on the special committee
having in charge the memorial services
for President McKmley.
CONGRESS is discussing a Philippine
tariff, with a view to applying the
Dingley law as against Philippine ex
ports to this country and applying the
Philippine commission's tariff sched
ule to goods entering the Philippines
A further section grants a rebate of
customs tariffs on goods which have
paid an internal revenue tax in this
country There is no proviso in
theresentative
measure that it shall be temporary, so
that the rates, if imposed, would be
applicable until congress otherwise
acted. Some members are of the
opinion that it would be wise to dis
ci iminate in favor of American goods
in certain eases, as Germany and
Great Britain are doing a larger busi
ness in the Philippines than Uncle
Sam is, but President Roosevelt and
the cabinet are of the opinion that the
United States must tote fair with all
nations in our Pacific territory, and
maintain an "open door" there.
HE new canal bill has been intro
duced in congress by Representative
Hepburn of Iowa, who was the author
of the bill passed at the last session.
It differs from the Hepburn bill passed
last year, in making the total appro
priation $180,000,000 instead of $140,000,-
000. Of this total amount, $10,000,000
is made immediately available to be
gin work, In some respects |he bill
follows that of last year, authorizing
the president to acquire a right of
way from Costa Rica and Nicaragua
and theu to direct the secretary of war
to begin the construction from Grey
town on the Caribbean sea to Brito on
the Pacific ocean with suitable de
fenses, etc. It begins to look as if the
big ditch would become an assured
thing. The Nicaraguan government
has signed a treaty with the, United
States leasing a section of Nicaraguan
territory six miles wide which includes
the route of the proposed canal, to the
United States perpetually.

This will prove a fatal course, for Ger
many io essentially dependent upon
the cheapness of her manufactured
products, to secure and hold a position

Mr. Flint thinks that in the present
state of the world's development that
the enactment of any additional pro
tective or prohibitive tariff is distinc
tively a retroactive step.
"Nations of the first class that ex
pect to progress and grow must stead
ily enact laws looking to a free trade
than a more .restricted one,"
says Mr. Flint. "In our own case I am
not in favor of the enactment of anyof
provision that will inter/ere with
vested interests, but if we must have
tariff legislation at all, let us have it
in the direction of lower rates rather
than higher ones. I do not think the
time has come when we should mater
ially scale down our duties, such as
they are, but when we do have tariff
legislation it should be in the line of
such scaling down, so that we should
encourage freer intercourse with the
other nations of the earth."'
CONGRESSMAN LITTLEFIELD of Maine,
has started in to carry out President
Roosevelt's suggestions in regard to
controlling the "'community of inter-
est1'
enterprises that are making so
many radical changes in our industrial
and commercial life. According to the
terms of his bill on or before Septem
ber 3 of each year, the corporations in
question are to file a return, stating
date of organization and constituent
companies the amount of authorized
capital stock, with the amount issued,
outstanding and paid in: total indebt

statement of assets and liabilities, in

perjury and the offender punished
by the laws of the federal government.
An annual tax of one per cent, on
thecircuit
capital stock issued and outstanding is
to be imposed where corporations are
engaged in interstate commerce. Rep
Littlefield has also intro

product that will always have an out

oleomargarine every time. We have
tasted both, and the latter product is
in our estimation quite sweet as com
pared with the rank, ill-smelling and
vile stuff called butter that is some
times sold. For all our choice dairy
and creamery butter there is always a
good demand and at very fair prices we
believe to the manufacturers, and we
do not think that oleomargarine comes
into actual competition with much of
our best dairy and creamery product.
Merit is the judge and common de
nominator, and tells every time. There
is too much belief in the theory that
laws can regulate all the little details
trade and commerce.
It is said that the oleomargarine
manufacturer colors his product to
resemble butter, but if the butter
makers did not color their butter the
oleo manufacturer would not have to
resort to coloring matter so often.
While the dairy conventions resolve
and petition for stringent laws against
oleo, the stockmen of the west resolve
and petition that no such legislation be
enacted. The western cattleman
claims that ''to cripple the oleomar
garine industry means a loss of from
$2 to $3 on every head of cattle he
ships to market, and there you have
it. It is one industry against another.
But it will make little difference
what congress does in the matter, the
product of the dairy and creamery and
the product of the big provision and
packing houses will be sold for what
they are worth. The man or woman
who goes on the market for good but
ter can generally tell it from oleomar
garine, and if they can't they do not
know good butter when they see it.
HICliiO 21A DECISION.
The application of the Chicago
Union Traction company and the Con
solidated Traction company for an in
junction i*estraining the State board of
equalization from assessing the capital
stock of those companies for 1900 was
denied, recently, by Judges Grosscup
and Humphrey, in the United States
court. The temporary injunc
tion issued by Judge Grosscup in Chi
cago also was dissolved. This
is a great victory for the taxpayers
and places in the State board of equal
ization the power to assess the capital
stock of the Chicago Union Traction
