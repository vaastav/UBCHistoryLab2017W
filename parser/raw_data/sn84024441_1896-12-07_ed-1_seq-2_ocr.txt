us Its lntenuitlon.il duties, in view of its
pecull lr relations to theisland, do not call
for some decided change in the policy

Iletliles the cases growing out of the

the i-Miters. where the Spanish authorities
assert iioliucomllltary liowers. Numerous

ever) case where the facts siifriccel to Im
pute culpability or responsibility to the
agents oT the Spanish power redress has
liccn promptly and vlgorousl) sought."
Under the head ot Spain, Secretary
Oluey, in his report accompanying the
President's mcssige, which Is, or course,
indorsed by the President, sas in pirt:
"As. regards the character and se-oe or
the float tic operations which now alfect
the greater pan of Cuba, the n iiorts of our
consuls are prnpirl) confidential, and, while
precise ae to the several districts touching

w in re Their organization, coufimd to
the shilling exigencies or the military
operations of the hour, is nomadic, with
out definite centers and lacking the most
e'tinentary reatures or municipal govern
ment. There nowhere appears the nucleus
or statehood.
fcKILLOFTHE LKAIihK.-.
"Although statistics or their military
strength arc attainable with difficulty, and
are notal ways trustworthy when obtained,
enough is certniub known to show that
the reioluUnnlsts In lhe field gn-atly ex
ceed In numbers any organization hereto

the Island, a betier lnilitarj, di-cipllne is

ot mainly drawing, as here ofure, upon
the comparativil primitive lobulation or
eastern Cuba, the insurgent armies fairl
represent the iutilllci'tit aspirant ns ot a

to the tnd to make the prcsi lit struggle
a supreme le st of the capacity of the Cuban
people .0 win for Uieirfelvcs and their
children the lit ritage of stlf .o-tmiiient.
"A notable feature of the actual situa
tion is the tactical skill dbplajed by its
leaders When the dlspatlt of numbers
and the comparative! indtfensiljle char
acter of the central and western Vega
couiitr are considered, the passage of a
considerable force into Pinar del Rio,
followed bv Us successful maintenance there

"The onlv apparent aim on cither side is
to cripjile the adicrsary b indiscriminate
destruction of nil that by nil chance ma
benefit him Thepopulousand wealth dis
tricts of the center aud the West, which
have escaped harm In former contests,
are now imaged and laid waste by the
blind fury of the respective partisans
"The principles ot dxlllzed warfare, ac
cording to the exidetmade sacred by the
universal acqiiiescense of nations, arc only
too often violated with lmpunlt by ir
responsible subordinates, acting at a
distance from the central authorit, and
able to shield tbemstliis from Just cen
sure or punishment by false or falsified
vers'onc of the facts.
"The killing and summary execution of
nor-combatantslsfrecjucntl reported, aud,
while the circumstances or the strife ate
such as to preclude accurate or general
information In this regard, enough Is known
to show that the number eif suth cases is
considerable. In some instances, happily
Tew, American citizens have fallen vic
tims to these savage acts.
"A large part of the correspondence of
the State Department with Its agents in
Cuba has been devoted to these cases
of assault upon the rights of our citizens.
In no instance has earnest remonstrance
and energetic appeal been omitted. But
the representatives of the Spanish power
often find it casll practicable to postpone
explanations and reparation on the ground
of alleged Jgrorance ot facts or for other
plausible reasons.
THREATENBOURCITIZEN'S.
"Its effect uponithe personal security of
our citizens in Cuba is not the only alarm
ing feature of 'the reign ot arbitrary an
archy on that Island. Its Influence upon
the fortunes of, those who have Invested
their carital and enterprise there, on the
assumed assurance of respect for law and
treaty rights, isrio less In point."
The report goes on to say thatan approxi
mate statement shows that American In
terests of the ,value of ?GO,000,000 are
threatened. A targe proportion of thesein
v estments Isnow exposed to thcexceptional
vicissitudes of the war.
A WARNING NOTE.
"This government has been constrained
to enter earnest protest against a recent
decree of the governor general ot Cuba, or
dering the registration of all aliens in the
island, and pronouncing all those not regis
tered within a certain time as debarred
from appealing to the provisions of exlst
Inglaw. "The treaty rights of American citi
zens obviously depend on their actual alle
giance to their own government, not upon
any arbitrary inscriptions as aliens by the
state wherein they may be sojourning;
and while this government Is well dis
posed to admit theconvenience of the pro
posed registry as an additional evidence
of the right of such citizens In
Cuba to the protection of the
authorities, and has signified
its willingness ttj facilitate their registra

most peaceful years of his fevtris'a life.
It Is a simple affair, built more tl in sev

The sides, as well as the roof, are shin

and near by grows a vigorous cherry treo
planted by Poe In 1847, and which rare!
falls to bring out a full crdp of fruit. On
the lower rioor or tlie cottage there are two
large square rixims and a kitchtn. The
middle room was used by Poe as a dining
and sitting room, und litre 11 e received his
visitors, until 1 is wire became ill. She

second floor has three low-ccihnged rooms,

Here Poe spent the eiuietest and happiest
davs of his lite. His expenses were small,

were lightened by visits from friends and
