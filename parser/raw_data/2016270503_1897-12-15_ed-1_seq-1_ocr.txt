ANDERSON ALONE.
Will Be the Only One of the Ollva Pecker
Crew Charged With JIurder.
NORFOLK, Dec. 15 When the Olive
Pecker mutiny case comes up for trial,
there will be but one man of the crew
of six to confront the charge, John
Anderson, the cook, the confessed mur
derer of the captain and mate of the
schooner, and who is also charged with
burning the vessel. Several weeks ago
two of the crew, Andrew Marsh and
Martin Barstad, were acquitted of the
charges against them and held as wit
nesses. The other three, John Lind. William
Hersburgh and Manuel de Dios Borrial,
were indicted as accessories to both
murders and as principals in the de
struction of the schooner. Yesterday
the indictments against them were dis
missed upon a motion by District At
torney White.
In making the motion Mr. White
stated that "after conferring with sea
faring men and learning the important
position which the cook occupies on a
merchant vessel, I have determined to
accept the statement of these men that
they were forced by John Anderson to
throw the bodies of the captain and
mate overboard after he had shot them
and then to help burn the vessel, obey
ing his orders at the pistol point. In a
word, I have reached the conclusion
that the United States would not, un
der the circumstances, be justified in
prosecuting' these cases."

city and county officers attended in a
body.
It. rained almost incessantly. But, re
gardless of the weather, the streets
early began to fill with those who de
sired to attend the services, and It was
evident that the large church would
contain only a fraction of those who
would seek admission. All the morn
ing the express wagons continued to
unload magnificent floral tributes, and
nearly every train brought friends of
the president and of the family to at
tend the services.
The members of the cabinet came
here on a special train. The party was
composed of Secretary of War Alger
and Mrs. Alger, Secretary of the Inte
rior Bliss, Attorney General McKenna
and Mrs. McKenna, Postmaster Gen
eral Gary, Secretary of Agriculture
Wilson and Secretary to the President
Porter and Mrs. Porter.
A crowd numbering thousands stood
in the streets leading from the McKin
ley home to the First Methodist church
and held their places despite the rain.
The church was packed, and hundreds
stood outside while the ceremonies were
being conducted.
The casket containing the remains
was placed in front of the chancel rail,
the JEolian quartet of male voices
chanting, "Still, Still With Thee." The
Rev. E. P. Herbruck of Trinity Reform
ed church offered a fervent prayer. This
was followed by the reading of the
hymn, "Jesus, Lover of My Soul," by
the Rev. Milligan of the First Presby
terian church and the singing of the
same by the quartet. The Rev. Dr.
Hall of Trinity Lutheran church read a
scriptural lesson, after which former
Mayor R. A. Cassidy read the memorial
adopted by the board of officers of the
church of which Mother McKinley had
so long been a member and the quartet
sang "Lead, Kindly Light."
The Rev. Dr. Manchester, who was a
comrade in arms of the president dur
ing the war as a member of the Twen
ty-third Ohio Volunteer infantry and
who has been the pastor of the First
Methodist Episcopal church for several
years, delivered a short oration.
After the singing of "Nearer, My God,
to Thee" the benediction was pronounc
ed by the Rev. Dr. McAfee, pastor of
the Broad Street Methodist church of
Columbus, which the president attended
while he was governor of Ohio.
The lid of the casket was then lifted,
and the large congregation, as well as
many others who had been unable to
gain admission to the church, filed past
to take a last look at the dead.
The family and the friends entered
carriages and, followed by thousands,
proceeded to Wesleyan cemetery, where
the body was laid to rest in the family
lot.
The services at the church were pre
ceded by brief private services at the
house, attended by the immediate fami
ly and the Washington guests. The
house services consisted of a prayer by
Rev. Mr. Manchester and the reading o
the twenty-third Psalm by the Rev. Dr.
McAfee.

of constructing a telephone line from
Sheep Camp to Lake Bennett, and pos

MRS. LANGTRY BARRED.
The London Jockey Club Practi
cally Brands Her.
London, Dec. 15. The report that
Mrs. Dangtry will be again taken into
society is more than offset by a resolu
tion that has been passed by the Jockey
Club which is aimed directly at her and
at the Prince of Wales. It has created
no end of talk. '
The resolution says that "for the fu
ture ladies other than the wives, daugh
ters and sisters of the members of the
club will be admitted to the inclosures
and private stands of the club at New
i market and on other race courses only
! on presentation of a voucher, signed by
i a member of the club, together with the
I payment of 1"
There has been a general impression
I that Mrs. Langtry haa had the freedom
of the race track, but this is not true.
Until the death of her husband, two
months ago, she was kept out of the
Inclosures and private stands of the
Jockey Club.

LOUISIANA MOB HOLD ALL JflGIIT
CARNIVAL AND HANG THREE.
Victims Strang; TJp One by One as Fast
as Sentenced Three Others Whip
ped and Ordered to Leave the
Country Two Shot to Death.
New Orleans, Dec. 15. Iberville par
ish has seen many lynchings, but none
more sensational than that which oc-
;urred yesterday morning near the Ut
ile town of St. Gabriel. Three negroes
cvere hanged by a mob and three others
svere brutally whipped and ordered to
leave the country.
George Bubur kept a store on the
Brown plantation at St. Gabriel, and
was murdered on the night of Nov. 27.
The murderers robbed, the store and
?ot away with a considerable amount
Df money. A few days afterwards six
negroes accused of the murder were ar
rested at Plaquemine, the seat of Jus
tice of Iberville, and confined in the
fail thene. The murder had been most
brutal, and there was much talk of
'ynching the prisoners.
Thomas Jones and James Lovigne,
the latter a cripple, were among those
arrested. They were brought to this
:ity for safe keeping. They were re
moved to Bayou Goula, three miles
from the scene of the murder, last
week, and once more the people of the
:ountry parish declared their intention
to lynch them.
To prevent this, the negroesj with the
Dthers charged with the Bubur murder,
were placed aboard the train and
started for New Orleans Monday after
noon, it being the Intention to keep
them here until time for the trial.
When the train was three miles from
Bt. Gabriel an armed mob stopped the
train at the point of weapons, took the
negroes from the law officers and took
chem to the woods.
Judge Lynch's Court sat in the woods
deliberating by the light of pine
torches. A form of trial, hasty and
one-sided, was given to the terrified
prisoners. Each was tried separately,
and a verdict of guilty was quickly
reached.
Thomas Jones was the first victim.
He was strung up in the presence of
the other prisoners, giving them a good
idea of what their fate was to be. Then
Jim Lavigne was hanged to the same
tree, and half an hour later another
negro whose name is not reported
shared the same fate.
The mob's thirst for blood had ap
parently been quenched, for the other
three negroes were sentenced to be
whipped and banished from the par
ish. They were tied to trees and beaten
until nearly dead, and then warned
never to show their faces in the neigh
borhood again. They made off through
the swamp as fast as their wounds
would permit. The mob dispersed at
daybreak, leaving three dead negroea
nanging to a tree.
Two Shot to Death.
Birmingham, Ala., Dec. 15. Informa
tion comes from Kennedy, seventy-two
miles west of here, that Lewis and
John Bonner, negroes, were taken from
ilowe Monday night by bands of white
tappers and shot to death.
Lewis Bonner was a United States
witness and also a State's witness
igainst whitecappers who murdered
another negro three months ago. This
Is supposed to have been the cause of
the murders.
ANOTHER BOND ISSUE?
Comptroller Eckels Gives His Views
on Preaident McK-inley's Meisage,
St. Louis, Dec. 15. James H. Eokels,
Comptroller of the Currency, when
asked If he agreed with the recom
mendations as to the currency made
by President McKinley in his recent
message to Congress, said:
"I think they are good as far as they
go. He does not go far enough, in my
poinion, when he says certain things
ought to be done if possible. Things
that ought to be done should be done,
and especially when they so vitally
touch the country's life. The President
idmits that the $346,000,000 greenbacks
md $12,000,000 Sherman legal tenders
should be taken up, and would,
I dare say, like to see it done; but it is
i conditional problem with him. Those
notes are simply a debt, and the only
svay to get rid of a debt is to pay it."
"How would you pay such a vast
sum at one timer '
"I would issue long-term 2 per cent.
?old bonds, and call those tenders In.
Then these issues could be made gold
certificates."
"Will the Dingley law produce
enough revenue to pay current ex
penses?" "AH tariff laws are problematical.
So far the law has not been the success
predicted for it, but as times improve
the revenues will increase, and It may
produce better results.".. ..
Senator Hanna Very 111.
Washington, Dec. 15. The Times
says that Gen. Grosvenor, in a private
conversation, stated that Senator Han
na is in an exceedingly bad way and
subject to heart failure in a form that
demands absolute and imperative rest.
He is now taking things as easily as
possible, and will subject himself to no
more annoyance or exercise than pos
sible. He is naturally restive about
the Ohio siti'-Mon, but expects to be re
elected , ,t trouble. Whether he is
or ii" i'. i.o will go abroad at the com
mand of his physician, and if elected to
succeed himself, Mr. Hanna will have
a standing pair for the next year.
Delay for the Treaty.
Washington, Dec. 15. It is stated to
day that the Hawaiian treaty will not
be taken up until after the holidays.
The reason assigned for this further
delay is the necessity of having the
President here to bring the Influence of
the Administration to bear in favor of
annexation. The anti-annexationists
not only contend that the treaty can
not command the necessary two-thirds
vote, but they say that every day's de
lay is making converts o their, side.
EIGHT HOURS A DAY'S WORK.
Federation Army of 600,000 Will Be.
it i n a Crnsade.
Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 15. The real
work of the seventeenth annual con
vention of the American Federation of
Labor began yesterday when the com
mittees appointed to consider the vari
ous suggestions made by President
Gompers in his annual report began to
file their reports.
The eight-hour day question is far
and away the chief topic discussed by
the delegates. They represent an en
rolled army of 600,000 wage earners, and
lhe sentiment seems practically unani
mous that agitation in favor of the
general adoption of the eight-hour day
shall be at once begun and pushed vig
orously in every labor organization in
the land. The feeling, however, is that
May 1, 1898, is too soon to adopt it.
The only man mentioned so far as a
possible candidate against President
Gompers is Harry Lloyd, of Boston,
and even his candidacy has not proved
very strong, Gompers' friends claim.
There are a few delegates opposed to
Gompers, but he seems to have a ma
jority of friends.
Every indication la that Kansas City
has a cinch on the next place of meet
ing. Secretary Morrison's report made a
remarkable showing as to strikes that
165,407 people were benefited, while only
840 received no substantial advantage.
It was recommended that the per
