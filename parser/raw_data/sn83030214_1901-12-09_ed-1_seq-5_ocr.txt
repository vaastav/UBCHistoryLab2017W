STARTIXG CHILDREX EIGHT.
EXCELLENT WORK BEING DONE BT
KINDERGARTEN ASSOCIATION— HELP
ASKED TO EXTEND INFLUENCE.
.-.:>• increasing' work for The children of the
tenements is shown by the advance sheets of the
New- York Kindergarten Association's annual re
port, which is soon to be issued. With two new
schools opened in September, there are now twenty
kindergartens under the supervision of the society,
and many more are awaiting adoption. Two moth
ers' libraries, one in the Amity Street Kinder
garten and the other la the Daisy Memorial Kin
dergarten, are innovations. The books are for the
use of members of the mothers' classes. Indeed,
the mothers are coming in for a larger share of
attention than formerly. In some of the kinder
gartens during the last year it has been the cus
tom to take mothers and children on excursions to
the Natural History Museum and to the Aquarium.
■nd these trips have been preceded with talks on
nature topics. In crder to enlist the parents' In
terest in the work of their own children an ex
hibition of the pupils' work has been held in each
school this year. This took the place of the gen
eral display of other years. The plan developed
many interesting features.
One mother said, as she looked at the pretty
things constructed by her child: "Did Chrissy do
all dis york? I tought he vas lazy." Another.
when she learned for the first time that her son
had remarkable talent for drawing, said: "I am
glad. I did not know it. 1 am willing to make any
sacrifice to have Harold taught the right thing."
One mother has had a corner of her kitchen par
titioned off to afford a place where the children's
work may be kept safely.
An amusing incident occurred in one of the kin
dergartens last spring. An Italian father appeared
one morning' leading by the hand a little girl only
two and one-half years old. He could speak only a
little English, but he managed to say, "She wan'
go school." The baby had under her arm a book
and a slate. The book proved to be not a primer or
reader, but ■ Social Register for 1500.
THEIR GOOD TIMES.
During the summer most of the youngsters of the
kindergartens were sent to the country for one or
two weeks. Here are some of the letters which
they wrote home, and which speak louder of the
beneficial effects of the work than anything else
could do:
Dear Mamma; The- soup is good, th- bed is good.
the flowers are good, the porch is good. I play in
tne yard. I sleep in a bed with Rose. Miss S.
washed me. V. - have potatoes. Miss S. likes me.
We sit on a bench to get to eat. We sit on chairs.
I send znv love to my mother, father, sister, the
baby and brother. JETTA.
Ise good, and I ate bread with batter and milk
and eggs and plums. I'se clean and I wash myself.
'. thank my mamma and my brothers and my papa
and Sadie. Miss G. made me a bath last night. I
was eating cake and strawberries and oatmeal and
meat for dinner. We have flowers on the table
and napkins and table cloths.
I>ear Mamma: I send you my best love and hope
you art pretty well. I have been a good boy and
have minded. I sleep in a nice cute little bed,
with a piUow. nice covers and mattress, on the first
floor. I had for breakfast oatmeal, egg. bread
and butter, and lots of good milk. 1 had a good
dinner. I like my feed very well. LOUIS.
D^itr Mamma and Papa: It's nice here. The
country is nice, and we sleep in a nice little bed.
with a clean, white cover to cover myself We
play in. a big yard. Miss S. is a nurse. She gives
tie lunch and water and rocking chairs on the
porch. We eat on a long, white table on the porch.
The bench to sit OB is nice. I eat meat, potato,
• strawberries yesterday, and oatmeal and est for
breakfast. I drink milk. I only eat at the table.
I have a clean napkin for myself. I had a ball last
■ Eigfct I send love to mamma, papa and everybody.
SOPHIE.
I per a bath on the night. And I am get a good
tilce. Tbe birds are in the country, and there was
yesterday a real bird.
Is fifteen of the kindergartens of the association
there are loiig -waiting lists of children, for ■whom
there is no room, and a strong appeal is made for
aore kindergartens, a.- well as for such minor ac
cessories as an aquarium, several sand tables and
• cabinot for various schools.
J A young Parsee missionary, who was visiting this
iCmmtzy in order to Investigate methods of educa
, lion employed here, after a call at one of the kin
dergartens, said: "This is the great need of India—
; the reverence for and the uplifting of the individual
**»*=• The training in industrial ideals and pursuits
■asst get into the national consciousness through
education. A Brahmin would rather fteal than
work. It is less of a disgrace in his moral code."
HAMILTON W. MABIE'S REPORT.
In his annual report Hamilton W. Mabie, presi
dent of tat- association, says:
Every report of progress is an appeal. 1: the
work is worth doing, and is being done with intelli
gence and force, the scope of it ougnt to be ex
tended. This, in & paragraph, is the condition of
..ne association, and the basis of it= apptal for a
more adequate support. The superintendent's ac
count of the activity of the year is a report of defi
nite progress, of wider influence and of enlarged
laciiities for work. The number of kindergartens
«as risen to twenty; this means a considerable ex
tension of the field of operation, wider access to
the children in the tenement house districts and
Increased sen-ice to the city.
Never in the history of New-York has there been
a better hope for wise and disinterested manage
ment of the affairs of the metropolis than exists
at this moment— a hope which foreseen a govern
ment which shall foster all the higher interests of
the city and develop a new kind of community life,
fcuch a government will need the organized co
operation of ail men and women who care for Xew-
York, not only as the centre of a great commerce,
but as the home of a great civic family. To pene
trate the neglected parts of the city with civilizing
Influences, to start little children on the way to
health, knowledge and a free growth of their fac
ulties, to give mothers who have lacked the finer
opportunities of experience the ideas, the habits
and the skill out of which true homes are fash
ioned, are the prime n**>ds and the foremost duties
of BBC time.

repairing that which rests on rotten foundations,
of forming instead of reforming men and women,
the New-York Kindergarten Association has a
large, and ought to have a larger, share. It touches
life at its sources, creates the atmosphere of the
home while it does the work of the school, and
prevents the appalling moral waste of neglected
childhood. It appeals for those who are silent be
cause they, do not know their own needs; It ap
peals on "behalf of the great city -of the future
whose character is now being formed. Its work
ought to be doubled: it is ready to multiply its
facilities and extend its service indefinitely. It
asks for the support of all men and women wh->
are eager to make New-York as great in moral
force and Intellectual resource, order and righteous
ness as it has already become In commercial power
and position.
It asks for means to establish new kinder? :
for gifts of $1.4«) from generous men and women
who stand ready to be responsible for one kinder
garten for a year; for smaller amounts from those
who wish to aid in the work of sustaining existing
kindergartens: for increased membership of the
association at a coat of $" a year, and for the co
operation of those who are able to give time and
thought to the reflected children of the city.
DAIXTY PARTY FROCKS.
HOW TO MAKE THEM SIMPLE AXD AT
TRACTIVE FOR YOUNG GIRLS.
"vTith Christmas holidays the little ones" revels
begin, and wee maids are as anxious about their
array as their older sisters.
For a girl of ten or thereabout nothing Is pret
tier than a frock of pale blue china silk, encircled
from waist to hem with insertions of white lace,
and with vertical insertions crossing the other at
distances of perhaps four inches at the waistline,
but flaring In conformity with the outline of the
gores. On the skirt are two ruffles of lace, and
the baby waist has a V-shaped yoke of lace edged
by a ruffle, and the elbow sleeves are of silk and
insertion with lace frill.
Accordion pleated dancing gowns are popular, and
a charming example Is of bluish rose India silk
with two Varidyked insertions of ivory lace and a
little ruffle of rose pink chiffon. The yoke from
which the pleated skirt falls is of chiffon In tiny
tucks, and a ruffling of the same soft fabric fln
isn^s it at the edgt.
A narrow niching of the same surrounds the
neck, while over the shoulders a collar formed of
bands of white satin connected by openwork silken
Btitchings and edged with a plisse frill of chiffon
and wee loops of cold beads just reveals an under
collar of silk edged with a ruchir:? of lace and fas
tened at one side with a many looped bow of baby
ribbon velvet.
As to the girl of fifteen, who is as critical as her
mother in the choice of her clothes, she will most
certainly be charmed by such a delightful dress
as the one described herewith. It is girlish, and
withal exceedingly smart, for the Fkirt Is of soft
white satin mousseline. The three bordering
flounces, which curve upward at the back, are all
edired narrowly with lace, while at the waist is a
sash of white chiffon, caught in at the left Bide
in front by a shining paste buckle, and then falling
far down the skirt in loosely knotted en. ls. which
eventually open out into fulness to reveal insertions
and edgings of lace.
The bodice, too. is of chiffon. Its shirred fulness
divided by insertions of lace, showing beneath a
little scalloped bolero of white satin covered with
iace where the design is followed by lines of glit
tering crystal beads, and where a scarf of chiffon
is drawn in and out of the lace in front, and fin
ished off at one side by a .big chou with pleated
and lace edged ends. The effect gives a charmingly
rounded appearance to the slim girlish figure. High
ly becoming too. is the modest little decollete,
which just eaves a V-shaped opening at the throat,
and allows the softness of the scalloped ace to
come against the skin. The sleeves terminate in a
decorative end at the elbow, with scallops of lace
above a soft puff of chiffon, which in its turn is
drawn into a closely fitting band of transparent
lace.
A pretty evening cloak is made of pale blue ze
nana cloth, lined with quilted silk and edged with
swansdown. The hood may be either the pointed
Capuchin or the rounded Carmelite, lined with silk
to match the quilted lining.

Inch wide, four yards baby satin ribbon.
Begin by making rufiie seven stitches -wide: make
sixty-eight whole rows, then seventy chain stitches,
one stitch between.
Make side by skipping every other stitch for two
stitches and work the third. This will give thirty
one stitches, covering twenty-six chain stitches.
Make twelve and one-half rows, letting last haL
of twelfth row run down back, putting two stitches
in corner and next, then in every other stitch.
Take up four stitches and draw through on rutne;

The street was his confessional, he said, and the

He will ride a bicycle on the ice in Clermont Avenue

LIVELY TIME IX BARRETT HOUSE.
W. E. WTXDERLICH AND A CLERK HAVE
EACH OTHER ARRESTED.
Wliliam E. Wunderlich, formerly proprietor of
a choph'us-- in Broadway, appeared at the West
Thirtieth-st. station last night with blood flow-
Ing from a wound at the tup of his head, and
said he had been assaulted in the Barrett House,
in Sixth-are. Mr. Wunderlich talked English so
brokenly that it was some time before Sergeant
Norton could grasp what he waa trying to tell.
When he did he directed Detecttre Higgins to
accompany Wunderlich and make an arrest if
Mr. Wunderlich's alleged assailant could be
found. The burden of t-tie complainant's story
was that a clerk of the Barrett House had as
saulted him. beaten him on the head, knocked
v.n. and then thrown him outdoors.

.1 "FOl R PARTY" LINE.
KKW-TOBK TELEPHONE COMPANY MAKES AN
INNOVATION IN ITS SERVICE.
The New-York Telephone Company has made an
innovation, in the shape of a "four party line ser
vice." subscription to which for five hundred mes
sages a year costs MS. This rate is for the resident
telephone service of the Borough of Manhattan.
Contractors for a "one party." or direct, line re
ceive a rate of $86 a year. Instead of 575, the former
price.
"By a four party line." said F. H. Bethel, con
tract agent of the New-York Telephone Company,
yesterday, "is meant that there are four telephones
on one circuit. By reducing the number of wires
we are able to lower rates. There are many house
holders who - do not make over five hundred calls
In a year, -and to them this new rate will prove
attractive. Generally speaking. New-Yorkers do
not want many stations on one circuit. In other
cities as many as ten persons contract for the use
of one circuit" By doing that they obtain a rate of
about $24 a year for their telephone service. But
In New-York no one wants to run the risk of wait
ing* until nine others have had their turn at the
receiver. There are seventy thousand stations In
this borough. The greater part of these direct lines
rent for $5 50 a month, or J6B a year."

WERE NOT GUILTY OF PETIT
LARCENY.
Before Magistrate Meade hi the Waal Side court
yesterday three ushers of Carnegie Hall were ar
raigned on the charge of petit larceny. They were
arrested on Saturday night or. the complaint of
Daniel Frohman, who alleged that they gave seats
to patrons who had no seats, when these seats
rightfully belonged to Mr. Frohman. The charge
was added that the ushers accepted money for the
favor.

man. The prisoners were Maurice K. Jenks, twen
ty years old. of No. -- West One-h .--d-and
fif teenth-st., a student; Henry Flakier, fifteen years

Flagler and paid 60 cents for a good coupon for a
seat in a box. Flagler proved, that the coupon had.
been given to him by the Baa holder, ■ it was not
going to be used, in order that he might make a
little money on it. In the cases of Jeoks and
Wheeler it wad shown that neither asked for
money, but that they received "tipa." as they ex
pressed it, for tin favor of allowing the men to nix.
down.
Magistrate Meade said:
"This practice has been carried on or forty
years "
••Yes, we know it," said Mr. We-n handler, "and
Mr. Frohman says it baa got to stop." _ •"
"Yes. you can stop it. You must do it legally. I
believe that these two oases of Jenks ana Wheeler
are merely those of gratuity. They did not askfor
money, and it was giver, then not asked - ■"■ That
of Flagler. it is shown, was perfectly legal, as it
shows that the coupon was given M Mai to d.3-
P< Mr Weinhandler asked for a furthar examina
