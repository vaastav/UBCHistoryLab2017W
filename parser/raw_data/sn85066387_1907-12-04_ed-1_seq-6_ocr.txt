SOUND LAW AND SOUND SENSE
SUPERIOR JUDGE STURTEVAXT'S decision holding the
Geary street railroad appropriation to be illegal is generally
received by the tax payers of San Francisco as sound sense and
by the lawyers as sound law. It will be difficult for the
Examiner to make its nasty charges stick against" this judge. No
citizen with a spoonful of brains will believe that the court was
influenced, as Hearst declares, by the Southern Pacific and the
United Railroads, to decide in their favor, for it is plain, even to the
lay mind, tthatt t the challenged appropriation was both illegal and
\u25a0 foolish. £
San Francisco has too much need for every one of her dollars
to put 720.000 or any number of them into the experiment of making
a municipal railroa<fout of the ramshackle Geary street line. The
supervisors who made up the last budget were fully aware that they
could not call this experiment an' emergency such as would justify a
special tax above the dollar limit, so they put the appropriation for it
as an "ordinary expense"' among the regular items^of the budget
inside the charter limitation of $1 on the $100 and laid on a special tax
above the dollar Jimit of exactly the same amount, $720,000, for such
an "emergency expense" as taking care of the streets. It needs no
legal expertness to detect the juggling attempted in this appropria
tion. Manifestly, it was a subterfuge to cheat the letter and spirit of
the organic law, and that is precisely what Judge Sturtevant has
decided.
In the circumstances which San Francisco must reckon with,
the- attempt to spend three-quarters of a million on a theory was
something worse than foolish — it was almost criminal:' Even the
chuckleheaded Hearst will not try to make people believe that the
Geary street road could have been municipalized for this amount of
money. Even Hearst knows that, no matter what it cost, the
municipalized line could not have succeeded as an independent street
\u25a0 railway unit, lacking exchange relations with the United Railroads.
• Even Hearst knows that nobody beyond his little circle of dupes
wanted a municipal railway on any such terms and that everybody in
the town was suffering for lack of decent streets, decently swept and
This decision, relieving the tax payers of a burden that they
•could ill afford to shoulder, willbe commended by the vast majority
of those who would have had to bear the burden. Judge Sturtevant
may not only endure the condemnation of the Examiner but be
proud of it.
THE GOING AWAY OF AOKI
AOKI is going home. That does not sound very terrifying. It
might be a society note or some other' polite form of the
publicity affected by fashionable people. The politician,
again, might remark that the Japanese ambassador had "lost
his job" and let it go at that, but not so the Washington correspond
ent, who can smell blood 7.000 miles away. The journalist of
. national capitals makes his. living by the stuff that dreams. are made
of. In London he sees the war clouds forever hovering over the
Balkans. In" Washington the bogie man, for want of better, is
expected from Japan.
Viscount Aoki has been recalled by his government. In this the
Washington correspondents unanimously see visions and portends
of war. Aoki was a polite man and knew how to behave at dinner
Japanese opinion, it appears, did not approve Aoki's hobnobbing with
the whites. He is called in and Japan is either preparing to drive
us out of^the Pacific or at least to send us an ambassador who eats
with his knife.
Doubtless it' is not so bad as all that. One may suppose that
there is politics in Japan even as there is politics in American, and
a diplomatic berth in 'Washington should be counted "a soft snap"
for aspiring Japanese nobles. It would not be polite to say that Aoki
"got the ax,"' but, after all. the homely speech of the ward politician
appears to fit the crime. The ambassador, whether he goes from
America or from Japan or elsewhere, who becomes too friendly with
his host makes himself an object of suspicion and attack at home.
THE SECRETARY'S TOO CURIOUS RESEARCHES
AMONG. the multifarious activities of the department of agricul
ture is a searching inquiry into the nutritive value of foods. It
is a form of research that Secretary Wilson regards with af
fection, although it seems that an unscientific and bourgeois
congress regards it with suspicion. There is, however, in the annual
report of the secretary a sort. of halting confession of inadequacy of
results in the most important field* of this inquiry. Thus: *
{ At Middletown, Conn., the results; of respiration calorimeter experi
ments have been prepared. for publication on the subjects of muscular and
mental as related to energy income and outgo and the demands of the
body for food. From the elaborate experiments reported it does not* appear
that mental work exercises a positive influence on metabolic activity— that is
an the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxid and -.energy given off
fj-om the body— nor does it modify the body demands for and
energy. Muscular work, on the other hand, is absolutely dependent on- the
energy supplied by the food or/material'stored in the body from previous
food supply. 'The total energy output,' which may be readily determined
with. the respiration calorimeter, is a definite -measure of the totabv. ; ork per
formed by the body, and hence of the amount of energy v w;nich*the food must
supply, for .the performance of a given kind and amount of work. In other
words, it is possible to determine with the respiration calorimeter energy
requirements as expressed in dietary standards. " ; - '

In President RoQseydt's Latest Message
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S message to Con^
grcss restates his position as.to'trusts and .com
binations in restraint of competition with but
little change from his less formal; expressions .of
opinion. If there is successful dishonesty among
the wealthy all the power of the national govern
ment must be employed to punish and restraint; lf
injury or loss come from the exposure of fraud they
are. responsible who did the frauds, not he ; whd
turned on the light. v -•, •\u25a0•-;-.
' As for trusts and combinations.' they are 'gootl'
and bad, but theprcsident docs not scan quite^clea'r
in his mind about parting the sheep from ;4hc; goats.
He would have the Sherman law against trusts
amended so as to make some sort of, reservation for
the good trusts, but apparently he has not found
any rule of thumb much less a scientific measuring
stick by which to test the morality or public, policy
of any given combination, trust or union. As nearly
as may be gathered from his words, the 'matter
might "be left to the discretion or judgment of an
executive, board vested with semi-judicial functions'
in'this regard. It is a problem of-the utmost dif
ficulty and it is not clear that the president's:solu
tion is adequate or practicable. \u0084. . . '«' * .
Touching the regulation of interstate commerce
the president asks' an extension of federal authority
in the way of,supervision and regulation. To quote:
The; most vital need is in comicction' with the rail
roads. As to these, in my judgment, there, should now be
cither a national incorporation act or a law licensing rail
way companies to engage in interstate commerce .upon
certain conditions. The law should be so- framed^ as to
give to the interstate commerce commission power to pass
upon the future issue of securities, while ample means)
should be provided to enable the commission,^ whenever j
in its judgment it is necessary, to make V physical valua-i
tion of any railroad. As I stated in my message to the
congress a A'ear ago, railroads should be given power t6
enter into agreements, subject to the agreements being
made public in, minute detail and to the consent, of the
interstate commerce commission being first obtained. -Untifc
the national government assumes, proper control "of tih
terstate commerce in the- exercise of the authority it'al
ready possesses, it will be impossible either to give to ox
get from the railroads full justice. , The railroads i and all
other great corporations will do well to recognize that this
control must come; the only question is as to what gOA r ern-'
mental body can most wisely exercise it; : The courts -will
determine the limits within -which the federal authority
can exercise it, 'and there will still rcvnaln ample .'.work
within each state \u25a0 for the ' railway; 'commission of, that
state; and the national interstate xommerce commission
will work in harmony with the several state commissions,
each within Its own province, to achieve the desired* end.
The president sees that the .trusts Ira ve , come to
stay. Combination is the great fact of modern'in
dustrial conditions, whether ' they affect labor , or
capital. The president repeats : ' \u25a0-;\u25a0\u25a0< \u25a0
The aim of the national government' is quite a's,"rnujch l
to favor and protect honest corporations, honest business-..!
men of wealth, as to bring to justice those individuals and \
corporations representing dishonest methods. -Most cer
tainly there will be no" relaxation by' the governmentriauv
thorities in the effort to get "at /any great railroad wrecker
— any man who by clever swindling devices-robs investors,
oppresses wage workers and does injustice to the general
public. 'i "- '' \u25a0--'•"\u25a0• *0.-^
A\ r hat is a bad trust ?' Well, here..is I .an .a ttempt*
by the president to answer the question:: -<\u25a0:•- •?
A combination should not, be tolerated, if it abuse the,
power acquired by combination to the public-. detriment;- j
No corporation or association of any kind should be
permitted to engage in foreign or interstate commerce
that is formed for the; purpose of, or-whose operations
create a monopoly or general control of the ' production;
sale, or distribution of 'any one or more of the prime
necessities of life or articles of general use and necessity.
Such combinations are against public policy. .
That is very well and very obvious; "but. in the
last resort much is left to. the discretion or. judgment
of a court or commission passing on the. facts' o^ ]
each case. Moreover, competition itself
der suspicion. It appears, and it is -true.' that
there is good competition and bad competition as
well as good and bad trusts. As the president says:
Among the points to be aimed at should be the pro
hibition of unhealthy, competition, such as by rendering
service at an actual loss for the .purpose of crushing out i
competition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and the
prohibition of a corporation's making exclusive trade, with
itself a condition of having any trade with itself. -
It is a subject of extraordinary complication that '.
the president has done his; utmost to': unravel with ,
an honest purpose and partial success., He is almost ,
a pioneer in this. difficult field,, which. none of .his i
predecessors has pretended to cultivate.-: •;. -- \u25a0
The president makes no specific rccommeiida- i
tions . in regard to currency reform, but mentions <
with some favor the plan offered by former. Secre
tary Shaw to give elasticity to the circulation in this i
wise: " . \V- \
According to this plan national banks should be per- <
mitted to issue Va specified proportion of their capital >jn ;
notes of a given' kind, the issue to be taxed at so .high a
rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in legiti- (
mate trade. This plan vfvould not" permit .the. issue ?of ]
ample, may have failed of the. very : highest .standard- for jack; of a
quart of baked .beans: But how is this theory based? .
"Secretary Wilson announces that- there, is no-mea^uring'^stick
for the literary value of, let us say, a vincss- of ; pottage. You can

,, putes, he says: .
i ' \u25a0 * \u25a0\u25a0... '
.-.<"• Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in
Vabo.r disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in
;<\u25a0 the* maids f of those who feel that their rights are being
'. invaded and their liberty of action and of speech un
' jvarcaqtahly restrained continues likewise to grow. Much
of the -attack on the use of the process of injunction is
• wholly withont warrant, but I am constrained to express
>. the belrefthat for some of it there is warrant. This ques
• tion is becoming more and more one of prime importance,
and uiilcss the courts will themselves deal with it. in effec
tive manner it is; certain ultimately to demand some form
" of -legislative action. It would be most unfortunate for
our t social welfare if 'we should permit many, honest and
; law abidmg citizens to feel, that they had just cause for
, regarding our courts with hostility. '.. h earnestly commend
to the attention of the congress this matter, so that some
way \niay be devised -whicii. will limit tne abuse of in
junctipris. and protect those rights which from time to
, time it unwarrantably invades. Moreover, discontent is
often expressed with thejisc of the process of injunction
by. the courts, not oiily in labor; disputes, but where state
. laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this
question, as I am informed that it will so*on receive the ;
consideration of the supreme court.
The president ploads, for a discreet use of in
junction powers by the courts in labor cqntroversies
and actions to restrain the enforcement of state
; laws. -He points out that \u25a0 the temporary writ of
; injunction is .'sometimes "tyrannically used to ac
; complish a permanent decision."
I The message recommends that the .eight hour
I day he extended as far as practicable to all govern
; ment work. The president strongly insists on strin
gent legislation covering the work of women and
children and believes that the national, government
should supplement regulation by the states by ex
cluding from- interstate commerce the product of
child labor. With regard to the river systems the
. ;nessage says :
Our great river systems should be developed as na
tional water highways; the Mississippi, with its tributaries,
standing first in importance," and the 'Columbia second,
although there, are many others of importance on the
Pacific, the -Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national
government- should undertake this wqrk, and I hope a
beginning will be made in the present congress.
Irrigation, the revision of the land laws and the
conservation 'of forests and mineral deposits are
treated at some length. The progress of the Pan
ama canal is'noted and the need for wider locks is
suggested. With regard to shipping subsidies, the
' president say : \u25a0~ V
|.. ; 'The .unfortunate failure of the , shipping bill at the
] last session of the. last congress was followed by the
Staking off of certain Pacific steamships, which has greatly
hampered the movement of passengers between Hawaii
, arid/.the, mainland.. Uriless- the^^ congress is prepared by
positive encouragement to 'secure' proper facilities in the
way;of shipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then
..the coastwise, shipping; la\ys should' be. so far relaxed
as to prevent Hawaii suffering as it is now suffering. '
J-V:ConcerningJ -V: Concerning campaign contributions, the presi
dent believes that the expenses of candidates shoiild
be paid by the government. He proceeds : - y
- * The need- for collecting large campaign funds would
vanish if congress provided an appropriation for the
proper and legitimate expenses of each of the great na
tional parties, an appropriation ample enough t^o meet the
necessity for thorough organization and machinery, which
requires a large. expenditure of "money.- Then the stipula
tion should be made that no party receiving campaign
funds from' the treasury -should accept more than a fixed
amount from any individual subscriber or donor, and the
necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could
without difficulty be provided.
' \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0 The president, approves the practice of first class
powers to subsidize mail carrying lines thus:
It is the duty of.a first class power, so far a*s practicable,
to carry its «>cean mails under its own flag; the fast
ocean steamships and their crews required for such mail
service are valuable. auxiliaries to the sea power of a na
tion. Furthermore, the construction of such steamships
insures the maintenance- in an' efficient condition of "the
shipyards in which our battleships must be built.
,_ The expenditure of. public' money 'for the" performance
of, such necessary^ functions' of government is certainly
warranted, nor is it necessary todwell upon the incidental
benefits to our foreign commerce, to'the ship building in
dustry and to ship owning and navigation Avhich will ac
cdmpanyrthe discharge ; 6fthese N urgent public duties,
though they, too, should have weight.
The president advocates the building of four bat
tleships of the' largest size and explains the voyage
of the fleet as a practice cruise. -
The message on the whole contains little "more
than an amplification and reiteration of Roosevelt's
well known policies. He; has nothing to take back
of what he has said and "certain malefactors
df great wealth" will .find small consolation in the
docunient. The chief fault of the, message is its
unnecessary, length. • '.;.. \u0084 -

IN GOD TVE TRUST— H. K. D.. City.
The Introduction ot^p. religious motto
or device to be placed on the coinage
of the United States had been sug- .
gested more or less Indirectly several
times, but Jthe suggestion that was
finally adopfed came from a farmer in
Maryland. In 1861, when Salmon P.
Chase was secretary of the treasury,
he received a letter from tht3 farmer,
who suggested that, as we claimed to
be a Christian people, we should Indi
cate our profession on our coinage. The
letter was referred to James Pollock,
then director of. the mint, who. In hs3
report, for 1562," discussed' the recogni
tion of the sovereignty', of- God and our
trust In him on our coins. "The prop
osition to, Introduce a motto upon our
coins," he" said in his report, "has been
favorably considered by Mr. Chase, and
I have no doubt that it will meet
with approval by an Intelligent public
sentiment.** The motto that was sug
gested, "In God Is Our Trust." is from
the lasf* verse of the American hymn,
"The Star Spangled Banner."
Then conquer, we mu.«t when our can** It 'is Just.
And this be our. motto: -"In God Is Our Trust."
A two cent bronze'piece was author
ized to be coined by congress April 22,
1864, and upon this was -first stamped #
the motto "In God We Trust." By an
act of congress of March 3. 1865, the
director of the mint, with the approval
of the "secretary of the treasury, was
authorized to place upon all the gold
and sliver coins of the United States,
where it- could be used, the motto: "In
