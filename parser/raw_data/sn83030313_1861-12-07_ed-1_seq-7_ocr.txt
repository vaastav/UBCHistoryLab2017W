keeping up their personal quarrel, Mr. Opdyke,
with the support of six out of nine daily papers,
and nearly all the weeklies, would have come
out of the race twenty-four thousand behind his
opponent Where, then, is the boasted influ
ence of the Tribune and Times f Circumstances
elected Mr. Opdyke, or, in other words, he owes
his success to the division of his opponents, and
not to the newspapers supporting him.
The Rebel Army? Its Officers, Numbers,
Organization and Localities.
There is considerable disparity in the various
estimates made as to the aggregate strength of
the rebel army in the field. They range be
tween 250,000 ? the lowest figure ? and 500,000,
the highest. In Yancey's recent after dinner
speech to the Fishmongers' Society of London
he adopted the smaller figure. A letter that
has been published ? written by an English offi
cer serving with the rebels ? gives the same
estimate. Judge Ochiltree, of Texas, in a pub*
lio harangue recently delivered by him in the
South, puts the strength of the rebel army at
290,000. Other estimates have been made
which run up the aggregate strength to half a
million. But to set at rest all these varying and
conflicting speculations we publish to-day a de
tailed statement of the whole military organi
sation of the rebels, compiled from the highest
authorities and the most authentic records, with
the aid of additional private information. This
statement shows that the rebels have in the field
four hundred and fifty regiments, which, re"
ducing the average strength of a regiment to
eight hundred men ? which is probably about
the noarest approximation to the truth ? gives
an aggregate force of 360,000 men.
To raise this large army the South has had to
resort to compulsory rat ins ? to drafting, con
scription, impressment, and the lash of infuriat
ed public opinion ? even although there was
no resource but that of a military life left for
bor young men. On the other hand, our still
more immense army of 660,000 men has been
raised by voluntary enrolment alone, the only
influence acting upon the volunteer being the
sentiment of patriotism and love for the Union
of our fathers. That contrast is the best com
mentary that can be made upon the existing
war and the mode in which it is viewed in the
separate sections.
When we published, some couple of months
ago, the condition of the rebol army at that
time, its accuracy was so strikingly apparent
that it caused great commotion in Richmond
and throughout the South, and the subordinates
of the War Department in Richmond were ac
cused of having violated their trust and sup
plied us surreptitiously and traitorously with
'he information set forth in the Hbkald. Now,
we want to disclaim, in advance, any responsi
bility on the part of the subordinates of the
Tebel War Department for the full and correct
statement which we to-day publish. The facts
come to us, not from subordinate officials, but
from higher sources, and they may be regarded
and taken as the nearest approach to correct
ness that can be arrived at. They vary, in some
respects, from the official records on file at
Richmond; but that is owing to the fact that
those records are so loosely kept as to be en
tirely unreliable. For instance, there are
regimental and company organizations of vari
ous States enumerated on our list which
are not to be found on the official records
of the rebel War Office; but we have supplied
this deficiency from other sources, which it
would be manifestly imprudent for us to make
known at this time. It may be that, from the
general slovenliness and inattention manifested
on the part of the Richmond officials, there may
be various errors in the personnel of the regi
mental and other officers, many of whom may
have oeased, through death, promotion or re
signation, to occupy the positions assigned to
them; but we rather flatter ourselves that, on
the whole, our statement will commend itself in
rebel circles as astonishingly correct. And we
might here suggest to Mr. Jefferson Davis the
propriety of filing it away among his rebel
archives for future reference.
The aggregate strength of 360,000 men,
which our tables give to the rebel army, may
fairly be regarded as the maximum which they
are capable of attaining. They have been pre
paring this rebellion for many years past, and
have already put forth their full strength. In
this effort they have exhausted themselves, and
the disorganization of that force will probably
"be more rapid than its organization apparently
was. With only a moderate effort on the part
of the national government we have been able,
without any preconcert, without impressment,
conscription or resort to any measure of com
pulsion, to put in the field an army of nearly
double the number, thoroughly equipped, and
supplied with the most improved arms and mu
nitions of war. Our preparations are now com
plete, and the vast machine of our military
power has only to be once fairly started before
we shall see the rebel hordes melt away like
frostwork before the warm rays of the sun.
Progress ok Immorality. ? Poor old Greeley
is trying to induce us to join him in making a
gambling bet about our circulation. The
wretched creature is a sad specimen of the
effect of political trials and intrigues upon the
morals. The other day poor Greeley went into
the gift enterprise business, and offered to
gamble gold pens for subscriptions to the Weekly
Tribune ; but now he does worse. The spectacle
of this broken down abolitionist editor running
about the city and offering gambling bets to all
takers is very sad, and moves us almost to
tears. About Raymond we hardly feel so bad
ly; for the Times has always been a stock gam
bling concern, and now Raymond has gone to
Albany to lobby-gamble railroad bills through
the Legislature. But, unlike Raymond, Gree
ley was once an honest, anti-gambling man,
and has been attacking Ben. Wood's lottery
schemes for years. To see him now, haunting
street corners, fumbling a pack of greasy cards,
and endeavoring to delude innocent people into
a game of "BQvenup," or a bet upon "thimble
rig," is very touching, and marks the rapid pro
gress of immorality in these tipiea. Poor
Greeley ! he must be insane.
Fiqhtcno Parsons. ? Until very lately, with
their Bishop General Polk, and some other
Gospel preachers, the rebels have been ahead
of us in the article of regular gunpowder light
ing parsons. But, if we may crcdit the late
reported Union victory of Parson Brownlow in
Tennessee, we have in him a match for Bishop
General Polk himself. But wby do not ->ur
blood and thunder abolition parsons ? nucli as
Beecher, Cheever, Garrison and Greeley? il'.'is
trate their faith by their works, like Par on
Brownlow? They have been lor years lubori: g
and preaching to brihg on (his rebel Hou, aul
now they should shoulder arms n;vl a-.-ist iu
putting it down. Paraon Bro willow practises

to the Rev. Dr. Cheever, the Rev. Dr. Beeoher
and the Right Reverend Dr. Greeley, of the aboli
tion church.
Tub Post Office Advertising ? A Broken
Dose for Greeley and tu* Little Villain.?
Mr. Mephistopheles Greeley and that "Little
Villain" Raymond are greatly moved upon the
subject of the relative circulation of the
Herald and their own petty papers, and are
affected to tears about the matter. We are sor
ry for them; but their attempts to inveigle us
into a silly bet are absolutely in vain. The
practice of betting is immoral. We cannot ap
prove of it. It may suit Greeley and Raymond,
who have exhibited very little morality in the
conduct of their journals, but it will not do for
us. We never made but one bet in our life, and
upon that occasion ? thirty-five years ago ? we
wagered ten dollars that Jaokson would be
elected President, and we won the money. The
traasaction was so out of our usual line, how
ever, and weighed so heavily upon our con
science, that we were obliged to take the money
from our pocket and give it to the poor. May
this disposition of the funds atone for the man*
ner of their receipt.
No, Messrs. Greeley and Raymond, our busi
ness is to edit a nefttpaper, and we cannot
waste time in card and dice playing with such
idle and penniless vagabonds as yourselves. If>
however, you really believe that your papers
have any circulation to be compared with that
of the Herald, we will show you how to decide
the question without any betting. At the be
ginning of every year the Tost Office advertis
ing is given to the journal having the largest
daily circulation. We now have this advertis
ing, and shall apply for it again for next year,
and wish you to do so also. As the circulation
of each paper has to be stated in a sworn
affidavit, and as the Postmaster may examine
witnesses upon the subject, if he pleases, there
could be no fairer way of determining what the
relative circulation of the Herald, Tribune and
Times really is. Every day we print and dis
pose of over one hundred thousand daily
Heralds, and frequently our circulation rises
to one hundred and twenty and one hundred
and thirty-five thousand copies.
Now,Jf you can touch those figures, send in
your affidavits to the Post Office and take the
advertising ? worth $2,000 a year? and all the
prestige it brings with it. ,If not, hold your
tongues, acknowledge that the Herald has the
largest daily circulation of any paper in the
world, and apply your betting money ? if you
have any ? to the payment of your debts.
A Rkuep Fund for Ireland ? How to Apply
It. ? Now is the time for American philanthro
pists to exhibit their benevolence in a practical
form to Ireland and the Irish, who hare de
served bo well of the republic in its present
emergency. Until some measures of relief are
adopted, there is one charitable and sacred fund
1 upon which they hare a special olaim, and
which ought to be applied immediately. After
a period of fourteen or fifteen years Ireland has
been visited by another famine from the same
cause as before ? the potato rot. The terrible
distress of the people resulted then in an insur
rectionary movement. A committee, consisting
of Horace Greeley & Co., in 1848 collected
some $60,000 for the ostensible purpose of aiding
and assisting Ireland. The money was chiefly
subscribed by the Irish emigrants, on the faith
that it was to be appropriated to that object;
but we believe It will be found that not a dollar
of it ever reached Ireland. About twenty thou
sand dollars were expended on some foolish ex
peditions to Canada and elsewhere. A sum of
$40,000 would thus remain. Six per cent interest
for thirteen yeara upon thiB Bum would amount
to $36,400. The total amount now in the hands
of Greeley and the other members of the com
mittee, whose names wo do not now recollect,
ought therefore to be $76,400 ? a very hand
some sum for the* benefit of Ireland.
Now is the time for its appropriation
to the relief of the thousands of Irishmen suffer
ing from famine in their native land. The
subscribers to the fund, and all others interested
in the fate of the Irish race, ought to hold a
meeting immediately and call on Greeley to
fork over the $76,400, to be invested in bread
stuffs to be sent over immediately to the relief
of a people famine stricken ? not by any fault of
theirs, not by any general failure of the crops,
but of a single root ? and not by the providence
of God, but by British providence. The money,
not having been expended, is, of course, now on
hand, together with the interest, and a moment
ought not to be lost in applying it to arrest the
progress of gaunt famine in Ireland.
On the Wron& Scent? The British Army
and Navy Gazette, of the 16th of November last,
contains the following paragraph: ?
Tlio bc row steam frigate Phaeton, 61 guns, Captain E.
Tatbain, sailed on Tuesday from Splthead for Yarmouth
Roads (Isle of Wight), where Hhe anchored to await fur
ther orders. Sho returned to Splthead from Yarmouth
Roads od Thursday morning, and is ordered to fill up with
coal, and havo all derccts completed with every despatch
for foreign service. It ts reported that the Phaeton was
despatched from Spithead on tht special duty of looking out
for anil watching Die mooements of an American frigate,
sta'ed to ha\ ?e been seen cruising for the purpose of intercept
ing the West India mail packet, on board which three Mexi
can gentlemen were said to be passengers, the captain of the
American having instructions to arrest them as ppies.
This may be a canard, and we only give it as it has reach
ed us.
This " looking out for" and " watching the
movements of an American frigate" by a first
class British ship-of-war seems to indicate a
disposition to fight if the opportunity offered.
As it happens, the Gazette was slightly mistaken
as to the character and nationality of the pas
sengers supposed to have embarked on the mail
steamer. The report itself must have originated
out of the fact that the James Adger had arrived
in Europe in search of the steamer Nashville,
on which it was at first supposed that the rebel
Commissioners had embarked. We will, how
ever, say to our English friends that they may
have plenty of opportunity hereafter to show
their pluck If they have any.
V
The Tribune's Washington Correspon
dence.? It will be remembered that, when the
Bull run excitement frightened poor Greeley
out of his senses and his boots, he recalled and
dismissed Mr. Fitz Henry Warren, who was at
that time the Tribune's Washington correspon
dent, and who distinguished himself by his vio*
lent and abusive attacks upon the administra
tion and the army. In the place of Mr. Warren
the Tribune sent out a man named Wilkinson,
who used to be a protege of Thurlow Weed,
until Mr. Weed found him to be too obtrnsive
and showed him the door. Then Wilkinsou cur
rifd favor with Greeley by attacking Mr. Weed,
and wro.e for the Tribune a series of bitter and
a urrilous articles about Weed and las Journal, I
to the intenso disgust ol all sensible people, j
Thi3 Wilkin 'on is resuming, in Lis Washington |
correspondence, the attacks m^de by ilr. War. (
ren, and ia contorting very intimately with
Russell, of the London Times, with whose anti
American and anti-Union ideas he is being fully
inoculated. Wilkinson is a fanatical, imperti
nent, troublesome, revolutionary fellow, and
will bear watching.
Rather Loose in Assertion. ? The "Little Vil
lain" says he baa plenty of money in the bank,
but he omits to say what bank it 1b in. If he is
so flush would it not be a matter of conscience
for him to settle that little bill of damages due
the owner of tho vehicle which he broke down
in his flight from Bull run T We do not know
whether there is anything due on his Solferino
racing match. It id probable not; for abroad it
1b easier for a man to run away from a battle
field than to escape from a creditor.
The Speaker ok the Next State Assembly. ?
We understand that Mr. Coddington, the demo
cratic member elect from the Fifteenth Assem
bly district, is electioneering for Mr. Raymond
for Speaker of the Assembly. When we favored
Mr. Coddington's election we had no idea that
he would go off on that tangent; and if ho
should really be found laboring for that object
we shall look out for him when he comes up
for re-election in the future.

The case of the rebel steamer Nashville and the ship
Harvey Birch, burned by the Nashville, attracts groat
attention. The Nashville remaiued at Southampton for
repair*.
The captain of the Harvey Birch had gouo to London to
consult the American Minister. The crew of tbcHarvoy
Birch were vowing vonRoaiico against the ciew of the

proclamation has not been infracted by the lauding or

It is reported that tho Nashville has spare officers on
board for rebel ships preparing in England.
The London Timet, in alludhig to tho case, points to the
recent visit of tho United Stales steamer James Adger,
and says It would bo to the interest of England to keep
them both out of her harbors ; but if this cannot bo done,
thoy must both be let in alike.
The London Star, although wishing the commander of
the Nashville to be punished, says If be can
produce a commission from tho Confederate Statos
the government must let him go, as they have recog
nlzod those States as belligerents.
Commissioners Mason and Slldell were expected at
Southampton in the steamor La Plata, due the 29th. It
