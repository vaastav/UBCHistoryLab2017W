Tbe last annual message of the first ttrra *
of President Lincoln is before our readers. As
usual with all his State papers, it a plain, un
pretending document; and in this respect, aod
in tie matter of brevity, Lincolu is an immense
improvement upon Buchanan and poor fierce,
with their heavy and diaraal electionering
pamptilets. It is an encouraging report on the
state of the nation, and embodies various timely
and practical recommendations to the two
house*, although !n some things of great mo
ment it fails short of the mark.
For example, Mr. Lincoln, setting out with
the declaration that "the condition of our
foreign affairs is reasonably satisfactory," fol
lows directly after with the statement that
"we have strictly maintained neutrality be
tween the belligerents in Mexico," and there
stops. He has nothing to supgest upon that
subject Hss be forgotten that the Monroe
doctrine was a plank of the Baltimore platform,
and that it was expected he would face the music?
He intimates that the affair of the rebel buc
caneer Florida will require delicate handling; I
but be fails to tell us whether this case has
been left tn the hands of the Chevalier Webb
or has been taken up by the Secretary of 8tate; j
so that we cannot detcrm ne whether we are
to have a speedy rupture or an exhausting
diplomatic disoussioa with Brazil. His pre
cautions in reference to the public safety along
tbe Canadian border, Including certain hints to
the Canadian authorities, will meet tbe ap
proval of the country, and serve, we hope, as
a wholesome warning to our rebel sympathis
ing neighbors..
With regard to the Treasury, "it Is as well
as could be expected." Our national debt is
by do means so large as exhibited In tbe sta
tists of Tburlow Weed; but still It is accu
mulating. Consequently more taxes will be
necess ?ry, and more loans. In this connection
th<> President's suggestions in favor of exempt
ing United amounts of public securities held
by io'i viduals from taxation and seizure for
debt, bi'l his views touching tbe national bank
ing ST?'om are of tbe highest importance,
whether judicious or inexpedient, In view of
the general welfare.
Touching the operations of our armies during
the past year the two houses are referred to
the report of the Secretary of War, without any
j puffin*; of Mr. Stanton. Not so with tbe Sec
retary of the Navy; for, according to tbe Mes
sage, old Grandfather Welle* has accomplished
Hie most wondorfnl thing* in the way of "sfBclen
cy ami sucoess.'' We conclude that whatever
changes may be made in the Cabinet, Wellos is
a filters, and will go on squandering his mil
lions npoa experimental Monitors and steam
boilers and engines to the end of tbe war. The
blockade runners at Nassau will chuckle over
"Old Abe's" glorification of Welles.
Tbe rapid settlement of our new Territories,
and their development Into new States, and the
universal increase 'of the population, wealth*
resources, force* tad urospetitj of ?ll th? 1qt?1
State* and Territories, reoeive a liberal share
of the President's attention. H* array of
facta, too, and bia tig urea of th? Ute national
election, may well be presented to the world
as proving that, instead of being weakened,
tie loyal auction el' tbe Union is vastly stronger
now in men, meaus, material* aud resourcn
of every <lt*oription tLan at the beginning
of this gigantic war. Y7e have this extraor
dinary and most gratifying fact established on
the returns of the late Presidential election as
compared with those of 1800. We are posi
tively assured frem these returns that our
losses in men from the war have been much
exaggerated in the general estimates made
from time to time, and that our accessions of
able bodied refugees from the South and iunni
p routs from Europe have boeu much under
valued.
The message refers to General Sherman's
expedition as exhibiting our increased relative
military strength over that of tbe rebellion,
from the opinion of the General-iu-Chief of bis
ability to try this grand experim"tit. Next the
freeSUte movements in Missouri, Arkansas and
Louisiana are deemed worthy of congratulation,
while Maryland is exultingly held up as "an ex
ample of complete success." Shu nas cast out the
devil by which she waa torpented, and though
it "may seek tto tear her, it will woo her no
more." In brief, emancipation has fixed the
business for "Maryland, my Maryland."
In conclusion, being entirely satisfied that
Jeff. Davis will have nothing but independence
or subjugation, Mr. Lincoln declares that he
must and will be subdued. The door of am
neety to repenting rebels, however, still re
mains open, though there is no telling how
soon the dire necessities of war may clos* it.
When the rebels lay down their arms tbero
will be peare: bnt at the same time they are
admonished that Abraham Lincoln adheres to
his emancipation proclamations, lie advo
cates immediate action upon the proposed
constitutional amendment forever abolishing
and interdicting slavery within tbe limits of
the United States, but be holds, nevertheless,
that slavery is already abolished in the rebel
lious States by his proclamations. This recog
nition must come with tbe submission of those
States, whatever may bo sot down in the Bal
timore plat'orm.
Thus the slaveholders of Bebeldom are placed
between two consuming fires. If tboy still
adhere to Jeff. Davis they must give up slavery
in giving np their negroes, and a farm to boot
of fifty acres to each negro soldier; and if t'oey
abandon Davis tbey must subscribe to Old
Abe's emancipation proclamations. This, we
think, is one of tbe weak points of tbe message,
and ttfe other most prominent is Gideon
Welles. And so we turn it over to tbe diges
tion of the two houses of Congress and oar
readers.
Oar StTjr?Ita Creation, ArhUT???ltt |
?nd Preirat Cwnilltloa.
We defer the publication cf the annual re
port of the Secretary of the Navy till to-mor
row or next day. Th!s document gives us
a minute Tiew of this great division of
the national power, and lays before us tbe
present condition of lb? service. It go?*,
with some detail, into almost every point
that Las any interest in connection with our
navy, whether the interest be practical or his
torical. We are bow entirely our pre
at'st navy has beea produced oy tnis war. At
the commencement of the rebellion we were a
people with a good naval history, with proud
traditions of achievement* ou the sea, but sub
stantially without ships. Our navy was re
duced to tbe minimum peace establishment,
and tbe better part of it was on foreign service.
Small as aur navy was, only a small propor
tion of It was comprised of steam vessels, and
all others were useless. Thus apparently help
less, we were suddenly precipitated into a war
that required tbe enforcement of a mere exten
slve bloek ide than was over before attempted;
and that required also tbe presence or cruisers
on foreign seas to protect our commerce, and
the possession ot powerful vessels able to cope
at once with other arm*d vessels and with tbe
best built forts. Our national energy was
equal to the occasion, and wo created a
navy. No other national navy in tbo world
now equals in power the one what the United
Spates has thus put on the sea in four years.
Two hundred acd three ship-, with an aggre
gate of one thousand Bix hundred and thir|y
on? guns, have beeo boil* for our navy In that
time, or are now near completion; but unfor
tunately very few of those vessels are last
sailers. Sixty-two of thdie are iron clad, and of
these the Roanoke, New Ironsides, Dunderberg,
Puritan asd Dictator are Ot for soa service and
able to cope with the most powerful vessels of
tbe same class that England and Franco have
yet attempted to build. Men for this groat navy
are now had in abundance, though export sea
men are still scarce. And this immense power
has been, in the four years of tbe war, an ave
rage annnol expense of seventy millions repre
sented in currency. In this expense to to be
counted tbe construction of all tbo vessels.
Subtracting the amount properly chargeable to
that account and charging, as tbo roal expense
of tbo navy, only tbe remainder, it is found
that this immense navy costs as lees in a time
of war than the navies of England and France
cost those countries in time* of peace.
Among the achievements of our navy is the
alleged enforcement of the blockade of three
thousand miles of sea coast. Tbo Secretary
glances in this connection at the commercial
morality of English merchouts, and very justly
olssses their presort efforts in the blookade
business with tbeir efforts in tbe Chineae opium
trade, lie glances alao at the ports of Halifax, j
Bermuda and Nassau, as "porta that will al- j
ways be in sympathy with tbe eoeinies of this
country," aDd in that phrase gives tbo real
reason why tbey ought to bo ours. Bnl tbo
success of the blockade is shown in the fact
that there is now only one port that blockade
runners can get into, although, we seo
by the English papers, that tbo blockado
runners succeed In getting in and out
of Charleston, i'.ut the exceptional port
fo Wilmington. Tte blockade, says Mr.
Welles, Is not violsled with impunity even
there, since the aggregate of captures at that i
place Is thirteen millions of dollars. Half |
of this sum baa been divided priso money
and the remainder is a general benefit to the
service end the country, since it has established
a fned that, by investment, pays tbe entire pen-,
sion roll and relieves tbe national Treasury to
that oxtent. It is the conclusion of tho Secretary
that Wilmiagton, owing to the peculiarity of its
situation, cannot be absolutely closed without
tbe co-operation of the army to enable us to
carry farts that are in such shoal water that
the beavili armed ships oanuot eel al U???.
Fifty fast steamers have been unable to clow
tbia port.
iir, Welles re'ore to tba Alabama, Florida
and G> .r'gla, and pays Mb reaoects t?? Captain
Seruiuet as a >-?i?uouurod and beaten corsair,"
who "cannot relieve himself of Lis obligations
as a prisoner uat*! he shall be regularly ex
changed.'* In reelect te the Florida we are
given only a naked statement of the 'acta as
already known. It is giveu as probable that
"no valid transfer of ownership b?w ever taken
place" in the ca*e of the Tallahassee, and that
she is now, ae she was when a blockade run
ner, "registered in Liverpool a.? a British ship."
If this ahull prove to be true it will only make
a little more clear tbe faot that all the mari
time resistance our government ha? met with
has been English in every particular. Atten
tion is called to the fact that throughout their
aoveral careers these "Engllab built and Eng
lish manned rovers" hare never sent iu for ad
judication and condemnation a single ship or
cargo.
Very graceful recognition if made of the
varied brilliant services of our raval heroes, and
especially of the brilliant achievement of Lieu
tenant Cuahing in the dostruetiou of the Albe
marle. Tbe Secretary evidently appreciated
how inadequate would be any merely verbal
recognition of the services of Admiral
Farragut, and so, for the reward tff
the Old Salamander he recommends tbe
creation of the rank of vice admiral?a
rank analagous in the navy to that of lieu
tenant general in tbe army. Let this act of
simple justice be urged upon Congress.
In view of the present character of the navy,
another recommendation made by the Secre
tary is worthy of notice. This is the establish
ment of a navy yard for iron-clads, at which
such vessels car be repaired and built. Our
navy yards are shown to be at best quite un
equal to the demands of the navy; "while the
government has not an ^establishment where
a shaft can be made for our steamers
or plate for our iron-cl adH." It is re
commended that suoh an establishment be
located in the Delaware, near Philadelphia, as
thefe every requisite is found?fresb water, ex
tensive river front, proximity to a great citv,
and distance from the sea, and conseqnently
capability for defence in case of foreign war.
Tbe actual expenditure of tbe last fiscal year
was $?6,738,292. Tbe estimate (or the year
ending June 30, 1866, is $112,000,000.
the Annual Report of the Postmaster
Orntml-Ualoai nnd Rebel Reports
Compared.
Postmaster General Dennison hu presented
a very comprehensive report of tbe official
doings of his department for the past (focal
year. Considering tbe vast amount of informa
tion contained in it, it may be regarded as pos
sessing tbe virtue of brevity in a degree rarely
to be met with in a public document of the
kind. There seems to he scarcely a useless
word in it. Tbe recommendations are few, and
confined to tbe actual neceesUiee or obvious
advantage of tbe department, while tbe fiscal
statements are concise and easily understand
able to the most unfinancial comprehension.
Tbe report will be found ou tbe second
page of this morning's paper. The depart
ment, although not yet quite defraying its own
expenditures, Is in a truly favorable condition,
and gradually approaching the period when U
wHl not only p?y Its own way, but return a
handsome revenue to tbe public treasury.
When It Is considered that during tbe term
1859 to 1861 tbe expenditures over receipts
showed an average annual excess of nearly
lire and three-quarter millions, while the past
year the excess was much less than a quarter
of a million?barely rising two hundred thou
sand?there are certainly good grounds for con
gratulation to tbe country. The entire receipt*
for the year are twelve million four hundred
and thirty-eigbt thousand two hundred and
Orty-tbree dollars, showing an excess over the
receipts in 1861, tbe first year of tbe rebellion,
of eight hundred and twenty-three thousand
two hundred and fifty-four dollars. This fact
shows what an expensive affair It was to carty
on onr postal system in the Southern States.
It is a pleasant feature in this report to find
that while tbe expenditures the past year were
less than tbe estimate by over three bnndrad
and fifty-five thousand dollars, tbe receipts
were nearly three million! and three quarters
more than the estimate?or forty-two and flve
eightbs percent. This would indicate tbat
there wu something fauHy in the calculation;
bat it should be remembered that in times of
war, when new cities and Territories are occu
pied, and tbe Post Office follows wherever the
Union armies go and stay, it is a very difficult
t*?k to estimate tbe reoeipta and expenditures
in tbe matter of postage. Besides, tbe miscal
culation is on the right side, and the American
people have do cause te complain.
We refer to the report itself for information
which will be found important to nil who take
an interest in oar postal affairs. They will
And there accounts and statistics which will
atrike them with amazement at tbe vastnera of
the American postal system, and tbey will
wonder tbat so yonng a nation can have so
tboronghly perfected, upon so gigantic a scale,
an institution tbat baa done aa much for hu
manity and civilization as any of modem times.
Let them take this report of the Union Post
muter General and compare it with tbat of tbe
rebel Postmaster General, an abstract of which
we lately published. While tbe Union official
refers to arrangements with foreign govern
ments all over and around tbe world, for the
purpose of faoilitating tbe postal inter-commu
nication of our citizens wherever a Christian
or almost a pagan government exists; while it
will be seen tbat our system yields a revenuo
greater than when the rebellion commerced,
when fifteen States claimed to be out of tbe
Union, and established a post office department
of their own ; while it will be noticd that the
Union Postmaster-in-Chief refers to long linen
of oceanic, and coast, and river routes on the
Atlantic and the Pacific and in tbe Immense
interior of the United State*, to msgniflcmit
stenmships which are to bo placed on foreign
routes by government, to the princely items of
expenditure for the public good, and to tbe
recommendations and numberless details for
the benefit of tbe writing, reading, busy, pros
perous and loyal people of the Union- let
them, we say, look. at. this grand report ai d
then at the report of the official who runs the
rebel post office machine, and it will be found
tiiat there, with a rate of poataga three timea
that of tbe North, they have not reached tbrf e
millions of receipts, and that a ! .rge portion
of the countrj, which It was expected would
net eover the expenaea of keeping up postage
routes, bad net been beard from.
There ia probably no slagle department ef
ellfeer coveipment wbiob no sicaallt dewous
trav** the greatness and soundness of tbe ^ortjb
and CV? littleness and weakness of tbe Soulh
as the import# of their respective Postmaster
Generals.
Tuc Ltttfr or the Chmiirr Webb?Is It
l>o^n* or O-nuine >
When we cc.ue to closely explain* tie re
markable letter of tue Ohsralier Webb?pub
lished la our issue of yesterday?aud wlieu we
critically consider the peculiar circumstances
of its first appearauoe In prial. we feel strongly
inclined to eulertalu tie suspicion that it is
counterfeit. The arguments for au>l against
this suspicion are certainly very weighty; but
wheu the scales are erenly bold the arguments
for tbe suspicion appear tue heavier of tie two.
Let us plnee tlie facts, the theories and tbe
logic of the matter before an impartial, inte
rested and inquisitive public, and endeavor to
Sift the affair to the bottom aud discover the
truth.
Tbe two papers in which this letter first ap
peared have tbe unfortunate reputation of
being conducted by Bosnians, whose fine of
business, deliberately adapted, 1b to manu
'icturo great sensations from bogus materials.
We have not yet forgotten the Howard
hoax, called the bogus proclamation, with
which these Bohemian papers were connected.
The miscegenation pamphlet humbug has been
taeitly acknowledged as tbeir invention. The
counterfeit report of thn rebel Secretary Mal
lory, which attracted some attention in Europe,
has boon traced to the doers of these Bohe
mians of the press. Now, attor all this expe
rience in forgery, there is nothing improbable
in tbe theory that they havo forged this letter
purporting to be from the Chevalier Webb.
The manner of its publication, no loss than the
character of tbe journals in wLiich, it first ap
peared, t' rows doubts upon Its authenticity.
In one paper it is said to have been received
by ? bark which arrived at Hampton lioais.
In the other it is published without the usual
preface. W tiy should the bark story be given
in the one account and onitterl in the other?
Tbo Bohemians should he shrewder la their
next trick.
Ou the face of it the letter seem* genuine.
It is written in just the Chevalier Webb's pom
pous, egotistical, round-about style. But
this style is one easily imitated, just
a* President Lincoln's was; and as some
of the Bohemians were onoe employed upon
the Chevalier Webb's own paper it is quite
likely that they can write just as he does. The
matter of the letter is also in the Chevalier's
I vein, and it is precisely what we predicted he
would say. In the Hk&ild of November 30 we
| stated that "We have no doubt that the Che
valier Webb has written as long a correspond
ence on the subject as any that Mr. Seward has
yet written about the rebellion. We expect to
aee Lord Palmerston cot up In minoemsat, all
ready for a Yankee Christmas pie. Ws have
no doubt the Emperor Napoleon will be so
thoroughly excoriated that he will wish he had
never left Ham nor Palmo'a mint juleps. And
we expect to see Brazil eulogized to the skies
as the warmest and truest friend the Uuitod
States ever bad." Now the letter agreos with
these predictions la every particular, and what
is more probable than that the Bohemians,
knowing how thoroughly we understand th e
Chevalier Webb', should take our editorial and
concoct ? letter from tbe hints there published?
The trick was a shabby one, and rather stale;
bat It was just like Bohemian tricks la gen
eral.
In spite of the imitation of Webb's style and
manner, the letter, when attentively scanned,
aeems to be over done. Exaggeration Is the
peculiarity of all imitations. Louis tbe Four
teenth deolared "L'Etat e'est moi;" but this
letter makes the Chevalier Webb deolare "I
am the State Department." Tbe Chevalier's
personal and diplomatic regard for Secretary
Seward would prevent this positive assumption
of superiority. On tbe other hand, tbe whole
argument of the letter is sound for tbe Union,
aud terribly severe against all allies of the
rebels. This, of itself, would prove the letter
genuine; for tbe Bobemiaus are oopperheads,
and their forgeries are usually designed to
injure the Union cause. Still this Union teoe
of the letter may have been merely a cunning
device to make it pass current more readily;
for anybody would bave detected the decoit
bad the name of tbe Chevalier Webb, E . voy
Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of
the United States, been signed to a copperhead
epistle of tbe sort daily published in the organs
of tbe hotel burners of this city. Failing to
trace the letter to any authentic sonrce, there
fore, and rendered suspicious by all these evi
dences of Its bogus authorship, wo await more
reliable advices from the Chevalier Webb be
fore giving credence to its gennineness, and we
recommend our readors, including President
Lincoln and Secretary Seward, to follow eur
example.
What Does It Mean??In Coogress, on
Monday, Mr. Pendleton, of Ohio, offered a
resolution requesting the President to oom
municftte the report made by Colonel Thomas
M. Key of aa interview between himself and
General Howell Cobb, an the 14th day of June,
1862, oa tbe banks of the Chiokabominy, by
the authority of tbe War Department, on tbe
subject of tbe exchange of prisoners. Mr.
Washburne, of Illinois, promptly objected to
the resolution, and so it fell to the ground.
Some lime before tbe election it was stated
that an oflloer of McClellan's staff had an
Interriew at one time with Howell Cobb, and
it was insinuated that something Tory mys
terious, if not positively disloyal, took place at
that meeting. Now It appears that the Presi
dent has a full report of it in bis possession.
We hope be will Rive it to us. There may be
something useful in it. At all events, for some
reason or other, tbo republicans seem very
anxious to conceal it
A Ooon Ojikm.?It is said that when tbe
Congressmen met on the floor of tbe House on
Monday they were all In the test of humor.
Pleasant greetings, handshaking of political
opponents, and tnerry laughter all round wai
the order of the day. We hope this m;?y be
regarded as a good oo.en of tbe humor with
which they are going to enter on tbe business
of this very brief session. . We cxpect that they
will be as good uatured towards tbe public as
to eaeb otbor, and hurry up some good legis
lation, over which the country may rejoice,
between this and the 4th of March.
