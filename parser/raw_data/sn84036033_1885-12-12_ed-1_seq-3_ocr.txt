The police seem to have awakened to

The biggest bunco joint in the city is a

We understand that the members of the
Grand Army resident in Butte wi'l soon
organize a corps of the Sons of Veterans,

They have great statesmen in New Hamp
shire. Last winter they adopted a law
compelling, under heavy penalties, the
butterine and oleomargarine manufactur
ers to give their product a pink color. The
law is being enforced, the courts holding
that as the manufacturers of bogus butter
color 'their wares, they might as well
make it pink as yellow, and that the peo
ple are entitled to such protection against
the fraud. The sellers of oleomargarine in
Butte evidently do not buy in New Hamp
shire.
That was an amusing sight which pre
sented itself at the corner of Main and
Granite streets, last evening. A party of
street exhorters, working in the interest of
some local religious revival, by theirspeak
ing and singing, collected quite a number of
people. The crowd consisted of all classes
of our people, and here and there were vis
ible the sensational and glaring banners of
the Arion and the Comique. The carriers
of these banners took advantage of the re
ligious gathering to advertise the stellar at
tractions of the Vaudevilles. It was a sight
and a gathering that one can find only in a
live Western mining camp.

The Executive Committee called into be
ing by the action of the delegates to the
water ways convention at St. Paul, in
August last, have issued a call for a con
vention for Missouri River Improvement,
to be held at Kansas City on the 29th
inst. In their call the Committee makes
the following statement:
From the facts disclosed by the experimental
fleet of 1878, and from a knowledge of the Mis
souri and Mississippi rivers, P> derived from a long
experience with them, Captain Lowery, who had
charge of the Babbage Company's fleet in 1878,
arrived at the conclusion that with adequate im
provement of these rivers, grain can be
carried from Kansas City to New Orleans at a
freight charge of seven cents per bushel. It is
believed that a corresponding rate from all other
Missouri river points and three cents added for
the higher coat of ocean freightage to foreign
markets from New Orleans than from Atlantic
ports, would not exceed twelve cents per bushel,
making the grain available for export from
New Orleans at the same charge as from Atlantic
ports.
The current rail rates for years past from Mis
souri river points to Atlantic ports has not been
less than twenty-one cents on wheat and sixteen
cents on corn—a difference of four cents on corn
and nine cents on wheat in favor of the river
route. The price of grain in the Missouri Valley
is the price in foreign markets less the cost of
placing it there. The price in foreign markets is
fixed by the supply from countries other than our
own, hence this saving, if realized as it may be
by the improvement of our rivers, will inure to
the producers in the Missouri Valley, and will
apply to the entire product of our farms, as well
as to that part exported.
The product of the Missouri Valley in the cen
sus year 1879, the last for which we have accurate
statistics, was 61,116,877 bushels of wheat and
«4,849,526 bushels of corn. These crops at four
and nine cents, respectively, gives a total sum of
822,074,456, which river transportation would save
to the producers of the Missouri Valley, on each
crop like that of 1879.
We have to consider, however, not alone the
benefits that may be secured, but the dangers
that may be averted. The high cost of transpor
tation in this country, maintaining as it does the
high cost of American grain in foreign markets,
and the reduced cost of transportation from grain
producing countries in Asia incident to the open
ing of the Suez canal, reducing as it docs the cost
of grain from those countries delivered in the
same markets, has so stimulated their product
that they threaten soon to drive American grain
from all markets accessible to both, and so re
duce the profit of its production in the Missouri
Valley as to depress our agricultural industries
and compel the adoption o f other products. The
contrast between American grain and that of
other countries for primacy in the world's mar
kets is now reduced to a matter of transportation.
The advantages are now against us, but the im
provement of our water-ways will turn this
permanently in our favor. These facts now pre
sent a dangerous and threatening situation, and
the improvement of our river, as a means of
promoting cheaper transportation for our grain
than railroads can ever afford, is demnnded, not
merely as a means for securing great benefits,but
likewise as a means of averting great disasters.
And it is in the interest of securing benefits
and averting disasters that this appeal to you is
made.
The practicability of the improvement of our
river is no longer a matter of doubt. The suc
cess of the jetties and other improvements on the
Mississippi river is well and generally known. Ex
periments on the Missouri river, both by private
and corporate enterprise and by government ap
propriations, has demonstrated that this stream
also can be easily and cheaply improved.
After careful survey and adequate study of the
river, Major Charles R. 8uter, then engineer of
the United States army and member of the Mis
sissippi River Commission, now president of the
Missouri River Commission, reported to Congress
in 1881 that an expenditure of 810,000 per mile
would secure a permanent channel of twelve feet
depth at low water and of sufficient width for
purposes of navigation. This sum does not ex
ceed half the cost of a single track railroad, and
will present transportation facilities equal to all
the railroads in the valley combined.
With such advantages to gain and such threat
ened disasters to avert at so small a cost, this
committee believes that every resident of the
Missouri Valley should cordially unite in efforts
to secure the improvement of our river. A uni
ted sentiment among the people will secure a
united effort by our Senators and representatives
in Congress, and a united effort on their part,,
as has been demonstrated in other matters, will
secure success in obtaining all reasonable ap
propriations, and the early completion of this
great and beneficent work.
To further the object aimed at this
Convention has been called. Senators,
Governors of States and Territories, and
other distinguished citizens will be invited
to attend. In order that the Convention
may be a large and representative one, the
following basis of representation has been
agreed upon: Commercial bodies of 500
members or less, ten delegates; commercial
bodies, each additional 500 members or less,
five delegates; cities, towns, townships and
counties having no commercial organiza
tion, for 5,000 population or less, five del
egates, for each additional 5,000 popula
tion, two delegates. The call is signed,
on behalf of Montana, by T. Ç. Power, of
Helena.
It is rumored, (and it comes from a
pretty reliable source, that the Union Pa
cific and the Northern Pacific companies
are now perfecting an arrangement
whereby the Northern Pacific is to secure
control of that portion of the Utah &
Northern Railway between Silver Bow and
Garrison, including the Anaconda Branch.
It is believed that the Union Pacific is wil
ling to sell this part of its line outright, and
not make it contingent on traffic or pool
compacts. When the Northern Pacific se
cures control of it, so goes the rumor, they
will at once make a standard gauge
road of it, and the Union Pacific
will, in all probability, lay a third rail be
tween Silver Bow and Butte. This would
give the great camp an unbrokeu standard
gauge route to Portland and St. Paul. The
story is given here for what it is worth.
We have no doubt that the Union Pacific
is quite willing to part with this section of
its road, and that it would dispose of it
for a less sum than it would cost the
Northern Pacific to build a new line.
A sure road to long life, according to an
English saying, is to get an a pension list.
We may well believe this to 1» true, since
the report of the Pension Bureau shows
that there are 78,500 soldiers of the war of
1812 and their widows on the pension list,
a number that is believed to exceed by far
the numbers that saw cannon smoke on
land in that memorable war. At the same
rate of vitality seventy-live years from now
there should be at least 100,000 pensioners
surviving out of the nearly 600,000 persons
who have already received $744,000,000
from the Government since 1861. Every
year the pension report comes in for more
or less abuse on the part of certain persons
and papers; but, as time goes by, the wil
lingness to grant pensions ought to increase
rather than decrease, since there can be no
nobler way to spend the public money than
on the public defenders. May they live
long, too, in peace and plenty, surrounded
by their children and their grand-children,
with the grand and beautiful old flag gaily
flying o'er them, for many, many years
beyond the time allotted to man.
General Manager Kimball, of the
Union Pacific Railway Company, and
party, left for the East, yesterday. Mr.
Kimball has thoroughly investigated the
sail question and studied its bearings upon
the future posperity of the camp. He came
to no decision while here, but undoubtedly
will make a decision soon after his return
to Omaha. He can make ho change in the
rate without the assent of the Northern
Pacific Railroad, which has not yet been
given. _
The verdict of a Reading, Pennsylvania,

LESSONS OF THE ELECTION.
All elections, whether great or small
by their results teach lessons which
would be well for parties as well as indi
viduals to study and profit by. An elec
tion for members of Parliament in Great
Britain signifies the peoples' approbation
or disapproval of the policy laid down by
1 the Ministry which represents the English
Government, and so also at national con
! tests in America for President or members
J of Congress may be justly regarded, figur
atively speaking,as a barometrical reflex
the public sentiment of a majority of the
citizens. For this reason it may be safely
contended that the memorable campaign
of last year demonstrated an indubitable
disapprobation of the course pursued by
the Republican party in flagrantly disrc
garding the high and important trusts
which had been confided to its keeping for
almost a quarter of a century.
Municipal contests at the polls unmis
takeably manifest the opinion of taxpayers
in favor or against the management of city
affairs. Last Spring the Republicans elected
six members of the Council, the Police
Judge, Marshal and City Attorney, and the
Democrats two Aldermen, a Mayor and
City Treasurer. Wednesday last, at the
special election, the Democrats secured the
City Attorney and one member of the
Council, the only officers voted for, by
decided majority, considering the light vote
polled. This result cannot fairly be re
garded in any other light than that of ie
pudiating the action of the majority of the
Council, and the manner of enforcing the
police regulations of the city. Complaints
against the latter have been so frequent as
to convince the most disinterested that the
system is radically wrong, and that the
welfare and prosperity of the city, as well
ns the security and happiness of the people,
demanded immediate reform.
These police regulations, of which the
people complain, have gradually grown into
our municipal system, because no determ
ined effort was wade prior to the special
election to publicly condemn them. Ordi
nances have been prepared and approved
by council having no other object in view
than that of increasing the fees which would
naturally flow into the hands and pockets
of those officers, whose duty it was to en
force them. These ordinances include, with
but few exceptions, the catalogue of crimes
punishable under the Territorial laws.
Some members of the bar, after examining
them, have expressed their wonder that the
offenses contained in the Federal laws were
not enumerated among those attempted to
be made cognizable before the Police Judge.
The District Court has frequently decided
that these ordinances are null and void,
and in spite of those adjudica
tions by that tribunal, the inferior
court has persisted in enforcing
them, by daily impositions of fines, impris
onment and costs. The fines imposed un
der the ordinances are insignificant, hence
not. calculated to intimidate evil-doers,
but the costs are tremendous, running all
the way from $20 to $50, depending upon
the number of w'tnesses summoned to tes
tify on the part of the prosecution. I Aider
this unparalleled system of police justice(?)
defendants' witnesses, who, in obedience to
the court, are compelled to leave their busi
ness or work, must do so without any com
pensation, and so must those at.swct ing a
subpuma issued by the prosecution, unless
the defendant is adjudged guilty and has
money enough to pay the costs. Witness
fees assessed as costs, and paid, form a
very considerable item in the perquisites
pertaining to all inferior judicatures, be
cause they are very seldom called for by
those entitled to them.
The prosecution is not held responsible
in any court for the defendants' witness
fees, but it is so held in all other courts,
except our police tribunals, for those testi
fying in its behalf. The city is liable for its
witnesses' fees, and council ought to make
provision to pay them. Fines for violat
ing city ordinances ought to rule and not
fees. City Council should at once repeal all
ordinances which, under the charter and
laws, it lias no authority to enact, and
pay its officers salaries for their services,
or reasonable fees in all cases, whether
there are convictions or not. By this
means only can an officer faithfully and
impartially discharge his duties, for then
liis judgment will not lie biased by
the hope of pecuniary gain off or the mis
fortunes of culprits who are adjudged
guilty. Abolish all fees in the Police Court
and impose fines upon the guilty ones.
This will prove the better plan.
The Husbandman wants to know "What
has become of the twenty-one millions of
money estimated to have been taken from
the mines of Montana during the past
twelve months? Is it still a factor of our
wealth, or has it been shipped from our
Territory, to be returned no more?" This
is in the way of an argument by the farm
ers against mining. The Maiden Argus com
ments upon it as follows : "Some of it has
no doubt. Yet a considerable portion of it
has gone towards building up the magnifi
cent cities of Butte aud Helena. In the
former place over four thousand men arc
employed, whose wages amount to
$400,000 per month. If foreign capitalists
had not invested in our mines Montana
would not contain over ten thousand souls
to day. The indirect benefit resulting from
the expenditure of money in opening our
mines, and the cost of operation is a
thousand times greater than the dividends
carried away by non-residents. Helena and
Butte, with cheap transportation facilities,
may yet furnish a market for the ranch
products of the greater portion of Mon
tana. There are several districts just now
in need of the aid of foreign capital. God
hasten the day for it to come."
The Miner has it from a semi-official
source that the Union Pacific company has
everything in readiness to go on with the
construction of their line into Helena and
Bozeman, and probably into Benton.
No movement will, it is understood,
be made until the Northern Pa
cific makes an aggressive movement toward
Butte. It is said that this is no "bluff,"
but that the Union Pacific has actually
raised the money necessary for tbe con
struction of these routes. The Union Pa
cific is of opinion that the traffic of Mon
tana alone will make a line centering at
Butte profitable. If the new line is built
Butte will become the headquarters of a
divisiou, where a large number of men will
be employed. There cannot be too much
railroad building in Montana next year so
far as the people of Butte are concerned.
Says an exchange: "A member of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen wishes
to know if tbe Life Assurance scheme of
that order should not be amended so that
suicides shall not be entitled to the bene
fits of an insurance policy? He says: 'Does
the plan as it now stands, not offer a
reward for selfmurder?' " The Life Assur
ance scheme of this excellent ord~r has
worked so admirably in the past that
changes should not be lightly made. The
better class of old stock insurance com
panies are now changing their policies in
respect to suicides and where they do not,
and contest the payment of policies on
suicides, juries invariably decide against
them. The Ancient Order of United Work
men are careful in taking in members.
They throw about the initiate every safe
guard that medical skill and experience
dictate. Their losses from this source are
very small, and there should be no change.
The Miner will hereafter have a daily
news letter from Helena, having established
a regular agency in that city. All the news
will be given in these letters, without fear
or favor. There will be no suppression to
please any clique or class. People who
want all the news of tbe Territory should
subscribe for Tbe Mines.

THE PRESIDENTS' MESSAGE.
The first message of President Cleveland
to Congress was submitted to that body
yesterday, and is this morning laid before
our readers in full. It is just such a docu
ment as was to be expected from so care
ful, studious and conservative a man as
Mr. Cleveland. It is an able, diguitied and
statesmanlike paper, and bears the im
press of honest thought. While it is
some respects disappointing to the people
of the West, it will be closely read. It
the one great item of news of the day, and
we offer no apologies for the space given up
to it in this special edition.
The President pays a deserved and fei
ing tribute-to the late Thomas A. Hend
ricks, and then briefly adverts to the com
ity of relations that should exist between
Congress and the Executive and defines the
duties and powers of each.
Our foreign relations are spoken of
great length and prominence is given to the
South and Central American states. The
ship railway across the Isthmus, proposed
by Eads, receives a black-eye. The Ameri
can hog is defended and tbe Santos case re
ceives considerable prominence.
The subject of naturalization is treated
of at length, and in no uncertain manner.
There is a true American ring about this
portion of the message that will find
hearty response in the heart of every true
patriot.
and the course
defended. In th
ol
doctrine is held that "the United .
must hold in their intercourse
ileges allowed to them without regard to
creed." Austria's right to decline receiving
Mr. Keilley solely on religious grounds
denied.
The President speaks in no uncertain
tones upon the Mormon question. He
insists that polygamy must go, and that
the present laws are not ample to aceom
plish this, others more stringent should be
enacted.
Our relations with England are specialty
referred to, the question of a new extradi
tion treaty with that power is raised and
an International copyright bill, upon the
basis of the Berne conference, is recom
mended. Closer relations with Mexico are
suggested.
Much space is given to the public debt
and to the excessive revenues of the Gov
ernment. The tariff bugbear is cleverly
avoided. Protection of American indus
tries is advocated and a reduction of duties
on the necessaries of life recommended,
The Chinese question is not viewed from
a popular, but froma statesmanlike stand
point. The discharge of onr treaty obliga
tions and the maintenance of law and
order are insisted upon. He boldly takes
the position that we can, as a Nation, Oar

and more stringent one should be enacl ed
The one subject to which the greatest
amount of attention is given and with
which the people of the West will take issue
is the further coinage of silver. The Pros!
dent makes an elaborate and exhaustive
argument against silver, and this part of
his message will bring general disap
pointment to the people of the
Rocky Mountains. The message
very clear and explicit upon this point
and the reader is referred to it. The Pres
ident's mind upon this subject has been
biased by bad counsellors. We have, this
morning, neither the time nor the space to
review the message fully, but shall recur to
the subject at some future time.
While there are some things about the
message that are disappointing to us there
are many that are to be applauded and ad
mired. It is, as we have already said, an
able paper, characterized by a broad and
cultured statesmanship and reflects credit
upon the author and the Nation.
Touching the extortionate freight rate on
salt, in which we are so deeply interested
and which Messrs. Kimball and Shelby
come here to inquire into, the Walkerville
News of to-morrow will have the following
to say editorially:
It would seem that a reduction in the freight
of milling salt by the Utah & Northern is not yet
an accomplished fact. The railroad authorities
appear loth to reduce their revenue in this par
ticular, and the mining companies are equally
determined to submit to what they consider an
extortion no longer. It is threatened, and we
speak advisedly when we say that it is no idle
threat, to suspend mining and milling opera
tions after January 1st, unless a satisfactory
arrangement is made with the railroad company
in the matter of a salt tariff. Already the Lex
ington Company has reduced its working force
almost one-half; the Alice Company are prepar
ing to make a sweeping reduction in the list of
its employes, and so with the Moulton and all
other mines in this vicinity. The reason given is
the enormous expense of working the ore, prin
cipally entailed by the excessive cost of milling
salts. The mining people are satisfied that with
a competing railroad the rates must be lowered
materially, and knowing the ore they have in
sight will keep, intend to suspend operations
until they can work It to their advantage. This
stoppage of work in the mines will throw about
1,000 men out- of employment on this side of the
hill alone; it will cause a complete stagnation
in all kinds of business and will greatly retard
the growth of the camp. Three months of idle
ness in the mines means the ruination of many
now doing a prosperous business. This is the
outlook at present, and it is earnestly hoped that
Messrs. Kimball and Shelby will Indorse the
sentiments of Assistant-General Superintendent
Dickinson in this matter, and conclude to report
in fuvor of a reduction in the freight rates on
milling salts. It seems poor policy on the part of
the company, for a temporary gain, to effectually
force on absolute suspension of the very Indus
try from which they derive so much revenue.
This expresses the sentiment of the com
munity. The mill managers have definitely
determined no longer to exhaust the mines,
without some prospect of decent returns
We trust that Messrs. Kimball and Shelby
will stay long enough in the camp to thor
oughly familiarize themselves with the sub
ject to the end that they may be able to act
intelligently in the premises.

SOME FACTS 017 COINAGE.
The production of gold in the entire world
for the year 1884, says the Director of
United States mints, amounted to $95,
000,000, and in silver, at its coinage value,
$45,000,000. This shows' au increase in
gold over the preceding year of $1,000,000
and a decrease of silver during the same
time of about an equal amount.
*
* *
So far as advices have been received,
coinages were executed during the calendar
year 1884, in eighteen countries of the
world, amounting in round numbers to
$99,500,000 in gold and $90,000.000 in
silver. As heretofore the United States lias
been the largest coiner of both metals. The
coinage of gold by Australia was only
$1,800,000 less than that of the United
States. The gold coinage of Russia amount
ed to $19,840,540—within $4,000,000 of
that of the United States. Germany coined
nearly $14,000,000, and Great Britain
over $11,000,000. In thecoinageof silver,
Mexico is but little behind the United
States, having coined $25,000,000 at
against $28,000,000 by this Government
The silver coinage of India was $13,800,
000—a large decline from the coinage of
recent years of that country—and of Spain
nearly $7,000,000.
***
The value of the gold deposited at tbe
mints and assay offices during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1885, amounted to
$52,894,075.09, of which $31,584,436.64
consisted of domestic bullion; $325,210.97
of United States coin; $1,869,363.26 of
jewelers' bars, old plate, etc.; $11,221,
846.45 of foreign bullion, and $7,893,
217.77 of foreign coin.

amount deposited during the pwvious

$435,692.19 of jewelers' bars, old plate,
etc.; $2,104,396.35 of foreign bullion, and
$1.122,076.86 of foreign coin. In addition
to this amount, the coining value of the
fine and unparted bars manufactured at
the mints and assay offices and re depos
ited during the year amounted to $1 292,
447.95. Hence the total value of silverre
ceived at the mints and assay offices dur
ing the year was $38.082,222.87.

The coinage of gold executed at the
mints of the United States during the year
was $24,861,122.50; of silver, $28.848,

The profits of the Government from coin
ing silver are greater than most peoplehave
any idea of. The seignorage on the coinage
of silver dollars during the fiscal year was
$4,355,278.81, and on subsidiary silver
coined at Philadelphia $10,197.61—a to
tal for the year of $4.365.476.45. Of this
amount, the sum of $67,554.71 was paid
for expenses incurred in the distribution of
the coin, ($63,064.25 being paid the express
companies, and $4,354.56 for bags,
bagging, etc., and $135.90 for tele
graphing.

The Director of the Mint, after carefully
revising, from the most authentic sources,
estimates of the coin circulation in the
United States, it appears that the amount
of coin in the country on 1st July, 1885,
was some $820,000,000, of which $542,
000,000 consisted of gold coin, and $278,
000,000 ol silver coin.

The estimated value of silver and gold in
this Territory last year was $2,170,000
gold and $7,000,000 in silver, making a
total of $9,170,000.
The sudden and unexpected death of

It looks as though Congress intended to

plomatic relations with that power. We
would lose nothing by such a course and
would save a not inconsiderable sum of
money. _
The surplus revenues of the country
should be put into ships ol war and coast

TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
Play a Trick That They Will Long
Remember.
Last evening about supper time, while
the dining room was crowded, the guests at
the Centennial Hotel were thrown into a
state of consternation and excitement by
hearing cries and shrieks coming from ap
parently an unknown quarter. Some
thought the house was haunted, and others
were satisfied that the cries were human.
A speedy search was made and it was soon
discovered that the balcony was the point
whence the sounds emenated, aud the
voices belongfd to two little pets of the
household, Pearly Bateman and Rosa, the
daughter of the housekeeper, When the
crowd reached the spot the little ones were
found prisoners in a manner that is famil
iar to the older folks, but was something
new to them. Together they had walked
on the balcony, the rail of which is of iron,
and as the frost looked so tempting they
decided to lick it off. The result was, of
course, that both were glued to the iron
aDd luckily instead of attempting to re
lease themselves by force, they began a
series of shrieks. Doc. Beall, who was on
hand, promptly procured a pitcher of hot
water and soon, the iron absorbing the
heat, the youngsters were released. They
were very much frightened, but not hurt,
and considering the scare they visited upon
the older folks and the commotion they
created they made a lucky escape. One
thing is sure they can be permitted to visit
the balcony in future without any fear of
their repeating the experiment.

Still We Grow.
From the Cincinnati Spokesman.
Twenty-five years ago we were 30,000,000
of people now we are nearly 60,000 000
Then we had 141 cities and towns 0 f over
8.000 inhabitants, now we have 286 o(
such cities and towns. Then the total
population of our cities was 5,000.000
now it is about 12,000,000. ' '
Our coal mines then produced 14,000 000
tons, now 85,000,000 tons, or six times as
much.
The iron product amounted to 900,000
tons of ore, to-day it foots up over
8.000. 000 tons a year, almost a nine fold
increase.
In 1860 our metal industries ernoluved
about 53,000 hands, consuming$l00,000
000 worth of material and turning out
about $180,000,000 in annual products.
To-day these industries employ 300,000
hands, consume $380,000,000 of material
and their annual product amounts to
$660.000.000 a year.
In 1860 the woolen industries employed
130.000 persons; to-day they employ 340,
000, while the value ol their annual pro
duct has trebled.
The woolen industry emplo yed 600 per
sons then, and now employ 160,000, while
our home mills, which produced goods of
the value of $80,000 000 in 1860, now
turn out an annual product worth $270
000.000.
Finally, there is cotton. In 1860 we
imported 220,000,000 yards ol cotton
goods; in 1881 we only imported 70,000,
0J0 yards.
In the meantime the number of hands
employed in American cotton mills has in
creased to 200,000, and we export over
150.000. 000 yards of cotton goods a year,
instead of importing 227,000,000 yards,
as we used to do.
In the meantime we have nearly five
times as many miles of railways, and double
the number of farms, yielding more than
double the number of bushels of cereals.
In the production of sheep, we had 22,
000,000 of them in 1860, to-day we have
over 40,000,000 of them; and whereas we
then produced in this country 6o,U0Ü,0üÛ
pounds oî wool, now we produce 240,UOO,
000 pounds.
Finally, the total of our exports has
doubled. In 1860 it stood at $400.000,
000, and now it stands at about S900,
000.000.
