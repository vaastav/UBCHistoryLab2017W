IS TO TAKE UP PEACE TREATY AND R. R.
QUESTIONS LATER ON SAYS
CAUSES FOR UNREST ARE
NOT DEEP SEATED.
Washington, Pec. 2 General rf commendations on legis-
fall
tion to coinl'at the cost of liviiur, labor unrest, radicalism and;
a readjustment of the nation to peace time basis were the fea
tures of President Wilson's annual message to congress de
livered today.
The peace treaty, the President told congress, will be dis
cussed in a separate message later, as will the railroad ques
tion. For the second time only since the President established
the practice of addressing congress in person, his message was"!
read today by the clerks.
Th" President's principal recommendations were:
Kstabli.-dimerit ff a budget system tor the national fi
nances. Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification
of the income and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary to meet
(.-hanged world conditions and mako the system conform with
the fact that the United States. is "the greatest capitalist in the
world."
Recognition and relief for veteran
so:c!ir-rs 'f tho wr'rM war, particu
larly in the way of government farms
as proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the dye
s' tuffs industry built up during the
war to keep the L'r.ked States inde
pendent of foreign supply.
An enlarged program for rural de
velopment, m recognition of the
farmers' part in the war.
Measures vh ich '-will remove the
cau.-ft-s" of "political restlessness in
our body politic."
At this point the president made
his most exren.sive reference to th--:
peace treaty by saying the causes for
the u nrt st "are superficial rather
than dee seated" and that they
"arise from, or are connected with,
the failure on the pari, of our govern -liu-nt.
to arrive speedily at a .hist and
permanent pence permitting return to
ii'Tn:;: I a .n fi ilioris, from the trans
fusion of radical theories from seeth
ii: it bluropea n centers pending such
delay:1 from heartless profiteering, re
sulting in the increase of the cost of
1 ivin : and. last iy, from the machin
ations of pasinnate and malevolent
agitators. With the return to nor
mal renditions this unrest will rapidly
disappear."
The president renewed his recom
ni on da Hons for legislation to deal ef
fectively with "those persons who, by
violent methods, would abrogate our
t ime test :d institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
n f w a ! s of pre v i o us ones, were m p d e
by the p rr side nt to bring down the
cest of living. Among them were
extension of the food ontrol law to
peace times for the emergency: rela
tions for transportation of foods in
interstate commerce: a cold sorasre
law modeled after the law in New
J ersey : a law requiring man's ' o
hI'ow the length of time foods are
i ' e p t in 8 1 o r a :r e : and a law to s ec u r e
"competitive soiling and prevent un
O';nsejonablo. prof its" by federal 11-r-en.se
of corporations selling food in
interstate eommerce.
A long portion of the message was
(V'VOTil to a discussion of The condi
tion and rights of labor. "A definite
pro arm m to bring about an improve
ment, in the conditions of labor" and
bring about a democratization of in
flustry was recommended.
The only way to keep men from
fi irit atiner a ?:ai nst grievances is to re
move tine grievances, said the presi
'b nt's message. At another point it
in red "the seed of revolution is
repression."
"Th - e5ta-di.hmert of the. principles
regarding labor. aii down in the cov
enant, of the League of Nations," said
the message, "offers us the way to in
dustrial pea"e and conciliation. No
other road lies open to us. Gov
ernments mus : iTognize the right of
men to bargain col le.-tivrly for hu
man p oljc-c:s. Labor must no
longer be treated a,s a commodity.
The right of individuals to strike is
inviolate, continued the message, and
ought not to bo interfered with by
any process of government, but there
is a predominant right, and that is
the right of the government to pro
tect all of its people and to assert Us
powers majesty against the challenge
of any class.
The President was referring to the
government's recent injunction against
the coal strike.
The message closed with a pointed
referr nf. e to radicalism and "red"
Joctrines. and referred to "Russia to
rrfcy with its blood and terror" as a
"gainful object lesson of the power
ofminoritios."
"'CThere are those in this country."
faici the message, "who threaten di
rectaction to force their will upon
a majority. It makes little
difference what minority it is either
capita or labor, or any other class,
no sotft of privilege will ever be per
mitted to dominate this country."
Orderly processes, the message de
clared, were the only ones by which
relief and reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies
fif this country," the message said.
"let those beware who take the
shorter road of disorder and revolu
tion." CUBAN SUGAR
REGARDED AS
SOURCE OF RELIEF
Washington, Dee. 2. Steps to re
lievo the sugar famine existing in
many parts of the country were under
discussion today at .the conference be
tween refiners and producers and offi
cials of the department " of Justice.
Cuban sugar was looked upon as the
only, source for relief and the n,ew
scale of prices probably -will be made
permanent to insure large purchases

MILLIONAIRE
STEEL M
OSEO TODAY
Henry C. Frick, Worth
$200,000,000 Had Been III
Some Time.
X e v York, Pec. 2 Henry C ! a y
Frick, millionaire steel manufacturer,
died here this morning.
Mr. Frick suffered an attack of
ptomaine paisoning early in Xovem
ber. He had nearly recovered from
this when serious complications de
veloped, lie was 6 9 years old.
Although little known in the finan
cial district Mr. Frick became a prom
inent figure in Wall Street on the
organization of the United States Steel
Corporation in 1901.
He was a director and a member of
the executive committee of that or
ganization almost from Ho ino option.
According- to a general belief among
financial men, he winkle J a greater
influence than any other man in directing-
the policy of that corporation.
Financiers familiar with Mr. Frick's
interests estimated today that his for
tune was not less than ?200,000.000. It
was said he was one of the largest
individual holders of Liberty and Vic
tory bonds.
Change Due to Failure
Germans To Sign
' Protocol.
Paris, De-c. 2. The American dele
gation to the peace conference, which
was to have sailed from Brest for the
United States on December 6, hat.
postponed its departure for home, it
was learned this afternoon.
A considerable part of the personnel
of the peace mission, however, wHl
leave. Paris for Brest on the evening
of Dec-ember 5, as previously ar
ranged. It is learned from a high authority
that The change in the plans of the
delegation is due to the failure of the
Germans to sign the protocol ratify
ingthe peace treaty.
It is pointed out that if the treaty
is no ratified the situation between
Germany and the L'nited States, as
well as the other Allied and associat
ed powers, goes back to the status
created by the armistice.
Hence the United States is a til',
quite as much interested as its asso
ciates of the Allied powers, despite the
fact that the Senate has not ratified
tlie treaty.
DECISION Ovf FIUME.
Paris, Dec. 2 The supreme council
decided today that the question of
Fiume should not be settled in the
Hungarian peace treaty but be re
served for final decision by the allied
and associated powers. This elim
inated any objections on the part of
either the Italians or the Jugo Slavs
to signing the treaty on account of
Fiume.
TO SUCCEED RKDFIEI.D.
Washington, Dec. 2 Joshua Willis
AJxander of Gallatin, Mo., represen
tative in congress, has been selected
by President Wilson to be Secretary
of Commerce, succeeding William C.
Redfield. The nomination will go
to .he Senate late today or tomorrow,
it was said, at the White House.

TO CONFERENCE
NOTTO LEAVE
ofi
To the Se.nate and House of Repre
sentatives: I 6im?erely regret that I cannot be
present at the opening of this session
of the Congress. I-am thus prevented
from presenting in as direct a way as
I could -wish the many questions that
are pressing for solution at this- time.
Happily, I have the advantage of the
advice, of the heads of the several ex
ecutive departments who have kept In
close touch with affairs in ilie.r detaii
and whose thoughtful recommenda
tions I earnestly second.
In the matter of railroads' and the
readjustment of their affairs, growing
out of federal control, I shall take the
liberty at a later day of addressing
you.
I hope that Congress will bring to a
conclusion at this session legislation
looking to the establishment of a
budget system. That there should be
one single authority responsible for
the making of all appropriations and
that appropriations should not be
made independently of each other,
but with reference to one single com
prehensive plan of expenditure prop
erly related to the nation's income,
there can be no doubt. I believe the
burden of preparing the budget must,
in the nature of the case, if the work
is to be properly done and responsi
bility concentrated instead of divided,
rest upon the executive. The budget
so prepared should be submitted to
and approved or amended by a single
committee of each house of Congress
and no single appropriation should be
maue uy uie .uni except u-u .
may have been included in the budget j
prepared by the executive or added by
the particular comm: ttee of Congress
charged with the budget legislation.
Another and not 3e.-s important as
pect of the problem is the ascertain
ment of the economy and efficiency
with which the moneys appropriated.,,
are expended. Under existing law the j
only audit is for the purpose of as
certaining whether expenditures have
been lawfully made within the appro
priations. No one is authorized or
equipped to ascertain whether the
money has been spent wisely, eco
nomically and effectively. The audi
tors should be highly trained officials
with permanent tenure in the treas-
ury department, free of obligations to
or motives of consideration for this
or any subsequent administratrion
and authorized and empowered to ex
amine into and make report upon the
methods employed and the results ob
tained by the executive departments
of the government. Their reports
should be made to the Congress and
to the secretary of the treasury.
I trust that the congress will give
its immediate consideration to the
problem of future taxation. Simpli
fication of the income and profits
taxes has become an immediate ne
cessity. These taxes performed in
dispensable service during the war.
They must, however, be simplified, not
only to save the taxpayer incon- ; and dyestuffs industry in America:
venience and expense, but in order j "Among the industries to which

amendments necessary or desirable in j close relation between the manufac-
connection with the administration of
the law recommendations which
have my approval and support. It
is of the utmost importance that in
dealing with this matter the present
law should not be disturbed so far
as regards taxes for the calendar year
1 920, payable in the calendar year
1921. The congress might well con
sider whether the higher rates of in
come and profits taxes can in peace
times be effectively productive of rev
enue, and whether they may not, on
the contrary, be destructive of busi
ness activity and productive of waste
and inefficiency. There is a point
at which in peace times high rates of
income and profits taxes discourage
energy, remove the incentive to new
enterprise, encourage extravagant ex
penditures and produce industrial
stagnation, with consequent unem
ployment and other attendant evils.
The problem is not an easy one. A
fundamental change has taken place
with reference to the position of
America In the world's affairs. The
prejudice and passions engendered by
decades of controversy between two
schools of political and economic
thought the one believers in protec
tion of American industries, the other
believers In tariff for revenue only
must be subordinated to the single
consideration of the public interest in
the light of utterly changed condi
tions. Before the war America was
heavily the debtor of the rest of the
world and the payments she had to
make to foreign countries on Ameri
can securities held abroad the expen
ditures of American travelers abroad
and the ocean freight charges she had
to pay to others, about balanced the
value of her pre-war belance of
trade.
During the war America's exports
have been grcat'y stimulated and in
creased prices have increased their
value. On the other hand, she has ! funher action on the part of the
purchased a large proportion of the . statea ad the federal government to

By imports into this country of gold
or of goods, or by establishing new
credits, Europe is in no position at
nor could we contemplate large fur
ther imports of gold Into this country
without concern. The time has nearly
passed for international governmental
loans and it will take time to develop
in thi3 country a market for foreign
securities. Anything, therefore, which
would tend to prevent foreign coun-
.' tries from settling for our exports by
shipments of goods into this country
1 could only have the effect of prevent
ling them from paying lor our exports
and thereof preventing the experts
from being made.
The productivity of the country,
greatly stimulated by the war, must
find an outlet by exports to foreign
countries, and any measures taken to
prevent imports will inevitably curtail
exports, force curtailment of produc
tion, load the banking machinery of
the country witn crea:is to carry un
sold products and produce industrial
stagnation and unemployment. I we
want to sell, we must be prepared to
buv. Whatever, threfo'ra. ma-v have
been our views during the period of
growth of American business con
cerning tariff legislation, we must now
adjust our own economic life to a
changed condition growing out of the
fact that American business is full
grown and hat America is the great
est capitalist in the world.
No policy of isolation will satisfy
the growing needs and opportunities
of America. The provincial standards
and policies of the past, which have
held American business as if in a
strait jacket, must yield and give
way to Ahe needs and exigencies of
the new day in which -we live, a day
full of hope and promise for Ameri
can business, if we will but take ad
vantage of the opportunities that are
ours for the asking. The. recent war
has ended our isolation and thrown
uuon us a great duty and responsi
bility. The United States must share
the expanding world markets.
The United States desires for itself
only equal opportufirty with the other
nations of the world and that through
the process of friendly co-operation
and fair competition, the legitimate '
interests of the nations concerned
may be successfully and equitably ad- j
justed. j
There are other matters of impart- i
ance upon which I urged action at the 1
last session of Congress which are
still pressing solution.
I am sure it is not necessary for me
again to remind you that there is one
immediate and very practical ques
tion resulting from the war, which we
should meet in the meet liberal spirit.
It is a matter of recognition and re-
f t BOdipre, T Pfl n An no hottor
than to quote from my last message
uring- this very action:
"We must see to it that our return
ing soldiers are assisted in every
practical way to find the places for
which they are fitted in the daily
work of the country. This can be
. ,wirr,!nr m.int.m
upon equate scale the admirable
I organization created by the depart-
ment of labor for placing men seek
ing work; and it can also be done, in
at least one very great fieldi. by cre
ating new opportunities for individual
enterprise.

Pointed out the way by which return

which the federal government has al
ready prepared "Or can readily pre
pare for cultivation and also on many
of th'e cut-over or neglected areas
which lie within the limits of the old
er states; and I once more take the
liberty of recommending very urgent
ly that this plan shall receive the
immediate and substantial support of
the congress."
In the matter of tariff legislation.
I beg to call your attention to the
statements contained in my last mess
age urging legislation with reference
to the establishment of the chemical
tu?e of dyestuffs on the one hand
and of explosives and poisonous gases
on the other, moreover, has given th
industry an except ionab-v significance
and value . Although the United State?
will gladly and unhesitatingly join in
the program of international disarma
ment it will nevertheless, be a policy
of obvious prudence to make ce.ri.aiu
of the successful maintenance of many
strong and well equipped chemical
plants. The German chemical indus
try, with which we will be brought
into competition was, and may well
be again, a thoroughly knit monopoly
capable of exercising a competition of
a peculiarly Insidious and dangerous
kind."
During the war the farmer per
formed a vital and willing service to
the nation. By materially increasing
the production of his land, he sup
plied America and the allies with the
increased amounts of food necessary
to keep their immense armies in the
field. He indispensably helped to
win the war. But there is now
scarcely less need of increasing the
production in food and the necessaries
of life. I ask the congress to con
sider means of encouraging effort
along these lines.
The importance of doing every
thing possible to promote production
along economical lines, to improve
marketing, and to make rural life
more attractive and healthful, is obvious.-
I would urge approval of the
plans already proposed to the Con
gress by the Secretary of Agriculture
to secure the essential facts required
for the proper study of this question,
through the proposed enlarged pro
grams for farm management studies
and crop estimates.
I would urge also, the continuance
of federal participation in the build
ing of good roads, under these terms
of existing law and under the direc

j fresh comprehensive survey made of
rural conditions by a conference com
posed of representatives of the farm
ers and of the agricultural agencies
responsible for leadership.
I would call your attention to the
widespread condition of political rest
lessness in our body politic. The
causes of this unrest, while various
and complicated, are superficial rather
than deep seated. Broadly, they arise
,from or are connected with the failure
on the part of our government to ar
rive speedily at a just and permanent
peace permitting return . to normal
conditions, from the tranfusion of
radical theories from seething Eu
ropean centers pending such .delay
from heartless profiteering resul'.lng
in the increase of the cost of Wns.

this unrest will rapidly disappear. In
the meantime, it does much evil. .- .
It Tseems to me that In - dealing
with this situation congress should not

campaign is to be effective, it is neces
sary that the other steps suggested
should be acted on at once.
I renew and strongly urge the ne-
cessity of the extension of the present
food control act as to the neriod of
time in which it shall remain in op- j of affe-long antagonisms between cap
eration. The attorney-general has . Ual and labor and at will hopefully

war and becomes inoperative upon the I
formal proclamation of peace. It is
imperative that it should be extended
at once. The Department of Justice
has built up extensive machinery for
the purpose of enforcing its provi
sions; all of which must be abandon
ed upon the conclusion of peace un
less the provisions of this act are ex
tended. During this period the congress
will have an opportunity to make sim
ilar, permanent provisions and regu
lations with regard to all goods des
tined for interstate commerce and to
exclude them from interstate ship
ment, if the requirements of the law
are not complied with. Some such
regulation is imperatively necessary.
The abuses that have grown up in
the manipulation of prices by the
withholding of foodstuffs and rfther
necessaries of life cannot otherwise
be effectively prevented. There can
be no doubt of either the necessity or
the legitimacy of such measures.
As I pointed out in my last, mes
sage, publicity can accomplish a
great deal in this campaign. Tho
aims of the government must be
clearly brought to the attention of
the consuming public, civic organiza-
tions and state officials, who are in
a position to lend their assistance to
our efforts. You have made avail-
able funds with which to carry on
this campaign, but in ere is no provi-
sion in the luw authorizing their ex-
penditure for the purpose of mak-
ing the public fully informed about
the efforts of the government. Speci-
fic recommendation has been by the
attorney general in this regard. I
would strongly urge upon you its im
mediate adoption, as it constitutes one
of the preliminary steps to this cam
paign, j
I also renew my recommendation
that the congress pass a law regulat
ing cold storage as it is regulated, for
example, by the laws of the state of
New Jersey, which limit the time dur-
ing which goods may be kept in stor-
age, prescribe the method of dispos-
ing of them if kept beyond the per-
mitted period, and require that goods
released from storage shall in all
cases bear the date of their receipt.
It would materially add to the ser
viceability of the law, for the purpose
we now have in view, if it were also
prescribed that all good released from
storage for interstate shipment should
have plainly marked upon each pack
age the selling or market price at
which they went into storage. By this
means the purchaser would always be
able to learn what profits stood be
tween him and the producer or the
wholesale dealer.
-1 would also renew my recom
mendation that all goods destined for
interstate commerce should in every
ease, where their form or package
makes it possible, be plainly marked
with the price at which they left the
hands of the producer.
We should formulate a law re
quiring ,a federal license of all cor
porations nsa.ged in interstate com
merce and embodying in the license,
or in the conditions under which it is
to be issued, specific regulations de
signed to secure competitive selling
and prevent unconscionable profits in
the method of marketing.
Such a law would afford a welcome
opportunity to effect other much
needed reforms in the business of In
terstate shipment and in the methods
of corporations which' are engaged
in it; but for the moment I confine
my recommendations to the object
immediately in hand, which is to
lower the cost of living.
No one who has observed the march
of events in the last year can fail
to note the absolute need of a defi
nite program to bring about an im
provement in the conditions of labor.
There can be no settled conditions
leading to increased production and a
reduction in the cost of living if la
bor and capital are to be antagonists
instead of partners.
Sound thinking and an honest desire
to serve the interests of the whole
nations as distinguished from the in
terests of a class, must be applied to
the solution of this great and press
ing problem. The failure of other
nations to consider this matter in a
vigorous way has produced bitterness
and jealousies, the food of radicalism.
The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re
move the grievances. An unwilling
ness even to discuss these matters
produces only dissatisfaction and
gives comfort to the extreme elements
in our country which endeavor to stir
up disturbance and in order to pro
voke governments to embark upon a
course of retaliation and repression.
The seed of revolution is repression.
The remedy for these things must not
be negative In character. It must be
constructive. It must comprehend the
general interest. The real antidote
for tho unrest which manifests Itself
is not suppression, but deep considera
tion of the .wrongs that beset our
national life and the. application of
remedy. '
Congress has already chown its wll

wrongs by establishing the eight hour
day as the standard in every field of
uabor. It has sought to fiind a way to
prevent child labor. It has served the
whole country by leading the way in
developing the means of preserving
and safeguarding the lives and health
in dangerous industries. It must now
help In the difficult task of finding a
method that will bring about a gen
uine democratization of industry.
based on tho full recognition of the
world out of which has emerged a
demand for an immediate considera
tion of the difficulties between capi
tal and labor, bids us put our own
house in order. Frankly there can be
industrial standards and conditions
against which the average workman
of the world had revolted.
It is, therefore, tho task of the
statesmen of this new day of change
and readjustment to recognize, world
I conditions that will mean the ending
greater production and a greater pros-
perity to business itself.
To anaiize the particulars in the de
mands of labor is to admit the justice
of their complaint in many matters
that lie at their basis The workman
demands an adequate wage, sufficient
to permit him to live in comfort, un
hampered by the fear of poverty and
want in his old age. He demands
the right to live and the rierht to work
amidst sanitary surroundings, both in I
home and workshop, surroundings
that develop and do not retard his
own health and well being; and the
rigjit to provide for his children's
wants in the matter of health and
education. In other words, it is his
desire to make the conditions of his
life and the lives of those dear to him
tolerable and easy to bear.
The establishment of the principles
regarding labor laid dovn in the
covenant of the League of Nations
offers us the way to industrial peace
and conciliation. No other road lies
open to us. Not to pursue this one
is longer to invite enmities, bitter
ness and antagonisms which in the
end only lead to industrial and social ;
disaster. The nnwillinir workman is
not a profitable servant. An employe j
whose industrial life is hedged about'
by hard and unjust conditions, which!
he did not create and over which he
has no control", lacks that fine spirit
of enthusiasm and volunteer effort ;
which are the necessary ingredients of j
great producing entitv. ' I
Let us be frank about this solemn
matter. The evidences of world-wide
unrest which manifest themselves in
violence throughout the world bid us
pause and consider the means to be
found to stop the spread of this con
tagious thing before it saps the very
vitality of the nation itself. Do we
gain strength by withholding the
remedy or is it not the business of
statesmen to treat , these ' manifesta
tions of unrest which meet us on
every hand as evidences of an eco
nomic disorder and to apply con
structive remedies wherever neces
sary, being sure that in the applica-
tion of the remedy we touch not the
vital tissues of our industrial and
economic life? there can be no re
cession of the tide of unrest . until
constructive instrumentalities are set
up to stem that tide.
Governments must recognize the
right of men collectively to bargain
for humane objects that have at their
base the mutual protection and wel
fare of those engaged in all indus
tries. Labor must not be longer treat
ed as a commodity. It must be re
garded as the activity of human be
ings, possessed of deep yearnings and
desiree. The business man gives his
best thought to the repair and replen
ishment of his machinery, so that its
usefulness will not be impaired and
its power to produce may always be
at its height and kept in motion. No
less regard ought to be paid to the
human machine, which after all pro
pels the machinery of the world and
: the great dynamic force that lies
back of all industry and progress.
Return to the old standards of
wage and industry in employment are
unthinkable. The terrible tragedy of
war which has just ended and which
has brought the world to the verge
i of chaos and disaster would be in
vain If there should ensue a return
to the conditions of we past. Eu
rope, itself, whence has come the un
rest which now holds the world at
bay is an example of standpatism in
these vital human matteu which
America might well accept as an ex
ample not to be followed but studi
ously to be averted.
Europe made labor the differential,
and the price of it all is enmity and
antagonism and prostrated industry.
The right of labor to live in peace and
comfort must be recognized by gov
ernments and America should be the
first to lay the foundation s-nes up
on which industrial peace shall b
built.
Labor not only is entitled to an
adequate wage, but capital should re
ceive a reasonable return upon its in
vestment and is entitled to protec
tion at the hands of the government
in every emergency. No government
worthy of the name can "play" the
elements against each other, for there
is a mutuality of interests between
them which the government must seek
to express and to safeguard at all
cost.
The right of individuals to strike is
inviolate and ought not to be inter
fered with by any process of govern
ment, but there is a piedominant
right and that is the right of the gov
ernment to protect all of its people
and to assert its power and majesty
against the challenge or any class.
The government, when it asserts that
right, seeks not to antagonize a class
but simply to defend the right of the
whole people as against the irrepara
ble harm and injury that might be
done by the attempt by any class to
usurp a power that only govirnment
itself has a right to exercise as a
protection to .all.
In the matter of international dis
putes which have led to war, sates

which have followed cut of such di

with these matters by means v-t

in a council of peace and amity theso
two great interests, out of which will
come a happier day of peace and co
operation, a day that will make for
mere comfort and happiness in living
and p. more tolerable condition

this country.
America will not be daunted by
threats nor lose her composure or
calmness in these d "stressing times.
We can afford, in the midst of this
day of passion and unrest, to be self
contained and 'sure. The instrument
of all reform In America is the
s -r sight road of justice to all classes
end conditions of mep. Men have but
to follow this road to realize the full
fruition of their objects and purposes.
Let those beware who would take tho
shorter road of disorder and revolu

justice and orderly process.
EXTENSIVE
HALT IN ALL
INDUSTRIES
Pittsburgh.- Dec. 2 Reports

per cent, increase the miners of the

the presence of Dr. Garfield in Wash
ington last week that the offer was
an insult."
Chicago. Dec. 2 Restrictions of
the use of coal, already put into ef
fect by regional coal committees
where the pinch of necessity had been
felt, today were extended through

extensive shutdown of industry In
history was in prospect and domestic
consumers were preparing to endure
privation and discomfort as the strike
of bituminous coal miners entered Jta
second month.
Only in Kansas, where volunteers
worked in the strip pits under pro
tection of state and federal troops,
and in the New River fields of West
Virginia was there prospect today of
increased production. In the former
seven pits were worked and in West

duction was in sight by the end of the
week.
