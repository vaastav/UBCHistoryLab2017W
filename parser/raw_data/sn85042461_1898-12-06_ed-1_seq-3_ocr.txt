PRESIDENT M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE
Reads Rather Like a Volume of
Ancient History
NOT THE SHADOW Of AN INDICATION
As to Policy to Be Pursued Regarding the
Philippines
The President Takes a Stand in Favor of the Construction of
the Nicaragua Canal and Recommends Financial
Legislation to Protect the Gold Reserve
A brief summary of the salient features of the president's message is as
folllows:
The causes that led up to the war with Spain are explained and the steps
taken in consequence given in detail. The princeipal events of the war are
briefly related and a high tribute paid to the work of the Red Cross.
Congress is risked to assist the people of Cuba in building up a Just, be
nevolent and humane government.
Our intercourse with oUier nations— the rupture with Spain excepted—
has been marked by great cordiality. No serious international problems are
presented.
Greece asks for the removal of the r duty on Zante currants.
The people are congratulated upon the success of the American exhibit
at Hamburg.
The failure of the nttempt to consolidate the governments of Central
America is discussed.
The early construction by the government of the Nicaragua canal is
urged ln emphatic terms.
President McKinley considers the Chinese question in such a shape ns
to obviate the necessity of our country's taking a part in it.
The people are congatulated upon the ine:eased space secured at the
Paris exposition, and congress is urged to increase the appropriation there
for.
Tariff negotiations for reciprocal relations are now in progress with
Prance and Germany. Efforts are in progress to induce the Swiss and Ger
man governments to relax their prohibition of the importation of dried
fruits. Our favorable relations with Great Britain are briefly commented
upon.
An acute but not serious difference with Mexico has arisen through dif-
views of the extradition treaty. It will doubtless be settled amicably.
Mr. McKinley urges an international agreement to regard all private
property as exempt from capture or destruction in time of war.
A brief statement is made regarding the revenues and the condition of
the treasury. It is estimated that upon the basis of the present revenue
laws there will be n deficiency of 9118,000,000 at the close of the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1800.
The invitation of the czar of Russia looking to a partial disarmament of
the powers is cordially approved. The United States will take part in the
proposed convention.
The extension of the Red Cross agreement to hostilities by sea is sug
gested.
The sultan of Turkey has thus far refused to pay our just claims for in-
Semnity on account ofthe destruction of the property of American mission
aries stationed in Armenia. The new minister to Turkey has instructions
to press those claiVis.
The president recommends that when any of the United States notes
ire presented for redemption and are redeemed in gold, such notes shell be
kept and set apart, and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is in
tended to break the "endless chain" process of draining the treasury of its
gold. There is also n demand for currency legislation. A money standard
In harmonious relation to the money standard of our commercial rivals
Ihoultl be had.
A maritime policy that will promote American shipping is earnestly
desired.
An increase in the regular army to 100,000 men is approved.
The menner in which the government secured payment for the Pacific
railroad clr -i is recited. Settlement of the Central Pacific claim is still
pending.
The extraordinary growth of the postal system is commented upon.
T;he recommendations of Secretary Long regarding an increase in the
navy are cordially approved.
The pension statistics are quoted without comment.
The necessities of agriculture nnd the intelligent manner in which
they are being met are referred to in terms of approval.
THE MESSAGE IN FULL
As Submitted to the Lawmakers of the Nation in Congress
/ WASHINGTON. Dec. s.—The President
"swot to Congress the following message:
To the Senate and House Of Represents,
fives: Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered uecessury by the war, our people
rejoice iv a very satisfactory and steadily in
creasing degree of prosperity, evidenced by
the largest volume of business ever record
ed. Every manufacture has been productive,
agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant
returns, labor in the fields of industry is bet
ter rewarded, revenue legislation passed by
the present Congress has increased the treas
ury's receipts to the amoiinl estimated by
its authorities, the finances of the govern
ment have been successfully administered
nnd its credit advanced to the first rank,
while its currency has been at tho world's
highest standard.
Military service under a common flag and
for a righteous cause has strengthened the
national spirit and served to cement more
closoly than ever the fraternal bonds be
tween every section of the country. A re
view of the relations of the I'nited States
to other powers, always appropriate, is in
this year of primary importance, in view of
the momentous issues which have arisen, de
manding in one instance the ultimate de
termination by arms and involving far reach
ing consequences which require the ear
nest attention of the Congress.
WAR WITH SPAIN
A Brief Resume of Its Causes and
Effects
In my last annual message very full consid
eration was given to the question of the
duty of the government of the United States
towarel Spain and the Cuban insurrection,
as being by far the most important prob
lem with which we were culled upon to
deal. The considerations then advanced,
and the exposition of the views therein
expressed, disclosed my sense of the extreme
gravity of the situation. Setting aside, as
logically unfounded, or practically inadmis
sible, the recognition of the Cuban insur
gents as belligerents, the recognition of the
independence of Cuba, neutral intervention
to end the war by imposing a ratified com
promise between the conn-itii'its, tntervi n
tion in favor of one or the other party and
the forcible annexation ol the inland. I con
eluded it was honestly due to our friendly
relations with Spain that she should be

I pectatious of reform to which she had be-
I come irrevocably committed. Withiita few
weeks previously she had announced com
| prchensivc plans which, it was conlidcntlv
asserted. would be efficacious to remedy the
evil so deeply affecting our own country, so
injurious to the true interests of the mother
country, as well as to those of Cuba, und
so repugnant to the universal sentiment of
humanity.
The ensuing months brought little sign of
real progress toward the pacification of Cu
ba. Ihe autonomist administration set up
in the capital and sonic of the principal cit
ies appeared not to gain the favor of the in
habitants, nor. to be able to extend their in
llueiice to the large extent of territory held
by the insurgents, while the military arm
Obviously unable to cope with the still active
rebellion, continued many of the most ob
jectionable and offensive policies of the gov
ernment that had preceded it. No tangible
relief was afforded the vast numbers of un
happy reconoentrndos, despite the reiterated
professions maris in that regard, and the
amount appropriated by Spain to that end.
Ihe proffered expedient of zones of culti
vation proved illusory indeed. No less prac
tical nor mpre.delusive promises of succor
could well have been tendered to the ex
hausted and destitute people, stripped of all
that made life and home dear and herded in
a strange region among unsympathetic stran
gers hardly less necessitous than themselves.
By the end of December the mortality
among them had frightfully increased Con
servative estimates from Spanish sources
placed the deaths among these di-trosed
peop.c at over fo per cent from the time
of General \\ eyler s decree of reconcentra
tion was enforced. With the acquiescence
of the Spanish authorities a scheme was
adopted for relief by charitable contribu
tions raised in (his country and distributed
under direction of the Consul-General and
the several Consuls, by noble and earnest
individual effort through the organized
agencies of the lied Cross.
Thousands of lives were thus saved, but
many thousand more were inaccessible to
such forms of aid.
The war contir.iutd on the old footing
without comprehensive plan, developing
only the same spasmodic encounters, barren
of strategic result, that had marked the
courses of the earlier ten-years' rebellion
as well ns the present insurrection from its
istart. No alternative save physical ex

DESTRUCTION OE THE MAIN X
At this juncture, on the 15th of Febru
ary last, occurred the destructioß of the
battleship Maine, while rightfully lying in
the harbor ot Havana, on a mission of in
ternational courtesy and good will, a cata
strophe the suspicious nature and horror
| of which stirred the nation's heart profound
| ly. It is a striking evidence of the poise
| and sturdy good sense distinguishing our
! national character that this shocking blow
j falling upon a generous people, already deep
ly touched by preceding event.- in* Cuba,
| did not move them to a desperate resolve
Ito tolerate no longer the existence of a con
dition of danger and disorder at our doors
that made possible such a deed by whomso
ever wrought. Yet, the instinct of justice
prevailed, and the nation anxiously awaited
the result of the searching investigation at
once set on foot. The finding of the naval
board of inquiry established that the origin
Of the explosion was external, by a mb
roarine mine, and only halted through lack
of positive testimony to fix the responsibil
ity of its authorship.
All those things carried conviction to
the most thoughtful, even before the find
ing of the naval court, that a cri-i.. in our
affairs with Spain and toward Cuba was at
hand. So strong was the belief, that it
needed but a brief executive suggestion to
Congress for it, to give immediate answer
lo the duty of making in.-tant provision for
the possible and perhaps speedily probable
emergency of war, and the remarkable, al
most unique, spectacle was presented of a
unanimous vole of both Houses on the 9th
of March, appropriating fifty million dol
lars, "for the national defense and lor each
and every purpose connected therewith, to
be expended at the discretion of the Presi
llfiril "
That this act of provision came not too
soon was disclosed when the application of
the fund was undertaken. Our forts were
pinotically undefended. Our navy needed
large provision for increased ammunition
and supplies and even numbers, to cope
with any sudden attack from the navy of
Spain, which comprised modern vessels of
the highest type of continental perfection.
Our army also required enlargement of
men and munitions. The details of the hur
ried preparation for the dread contingency
is told in the reports of the secretaries of
war and of the navy and need not be re
peated here. Jt is sufficient to say that
the outbreak of war, when it did come,
found cur nation not unprepared to meet
the conflict.
Nor was the apprehension of coming strife
confined to our own country. It war. felt
by the continental powers, who, on April
6th, through their ambassadors and envoys,
addressed to the executive an expression of
hope that humanity and moderation might
mark the course of this government and
people, and that further negotiations would
lead to an attempt, which, while securing
the maintenance of peace, would affirm all
necessary guarantees for the re-establish
ment of order in Cuba. In responding to
that presentation, I also shared the hope
that the envoys had expressed, that peace
might be preserved in a manner to termi
nate the chronic condition of disturbance in
Cuba, so injurious and menacing to our in
terests and tranquillity, as well as shocking
to our sentiments of humanity; and, while
appreciating the humanitarian and disin
terested character of the communication
they had made on behalf of the bowers, I
stated ihe confidence of this government on
its part, that equal appreciation would be
shown for its earnest and unselfish endeav
ors to ftillfill a duty of humanity by ending a
situation the indefinite prolongation of
which had become insufferable.
NEGOTIATION FAIEB
Still animated by the hoi c of a peaceful
solution and obeying the dictates of duty,
no effort was relaxed to bring about a
speedy ending of the Cuban struggle. Ne
gotiations to this effect continued actively
with the government of Spain looking to
the immediate conclusion of a six months
armistice in Cuba with a view to effecting
the recognition of her people's right to in"
dependence. Besides this, the instant re
version of the order of reconsideration was
asked, so that the suffering returning to
their homes antf aided by united American
and Spanish effort, might be put iv a wav
to support themselves and, by orderly re
sumption of the well nigh destroyed' pro
ductive energies of the island, contribute to
the restoration of its tranquillity and well
being. Negotiations continued for some lit
tle time at Madrid, resulting in oilers by the
Spanish government which could not but l-e
regarded as inadequate, it was proposed to I
confide the preparation of peace to the in
sular parliament jet to be convened under
the autonomous decrees ol November, 1807
but without impairment in any wise of the
constitutional powers of the Madrid gov- 1
eminent, which to that end would grant an
armistice, if solicited by the insurgents, for '
such time as the general in chief might sec
fit to fix. How and with what scope of div
cretionary powers the insular parliament
was expected to set about the "preparation"
of peace, did not appear. If it was to be by ;
negotiations with insurgents, the issue
seemed to rest on the one side with a body
chosen by that faction Of tin electors m
the districts, under Spanish control, and
on the other with the insurgent population '
holding the interior country, until repre- j
Mined in the so-called parliament and de
fiant at tin 1 suggestion of sueing for peace.
Grieved aud disappointed at this barren '
outcome of my sine-ere endeavors to reach
a practicable solution ,1 felt it my duty to !
remit the whole question to tin- t'ongi'ess. ,
In the message of April 11,1898, I announced
that with this last overture in the direction
of immediate peace in Cuba and it- disap
pointing reception by Spain, the effort of !
the Executive was brought to an end. 1 again
reviewed the alternative pourse ot action '
which 1 had prepared, concluding that the i
only consonant with international policy a:.(|
computable with our firmest set historical I j
traditions was intervention as a neutraltol]
stop the war and check the hopeless saori-j!
lice of life, even though that resort involved j '
"hostile constraint upon both the parti-s to •
the contract, as well as to enforce a truce' '
as to guide the eventual settlement."
Tha grounds justifying thai step were the '
interest's of humanity; the duty to protect [
life and property of our < itizens in Cuba;the 11
right to protect our commerce, and, nn„;
important, the need of removing at once and '
forever the constant menace and tlie bur
dens entailed upon our government by the
PRESIDENT WILLIAM M'KINLEY
uncertainties and perils of the situation
caused by the unendurable disturbance in
Cuba. I said:
"The long trial has proved that the ob
ject for which Spain has waged the war
cannot be attained. The fire of insurrec
tion may flame or may smoulder with vary
ing seasons, but it has not been and it is plain
it cannot be extinguished by the present
methods. The only hope of relief and re
pose from a situation which can no longer
be endured is the enforced pacification of
Cuba. In the name of humanity, in the
name of civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests, which give us tlie right
and duly to speak and to act, the war in
Cuba must stop."
In view of all this, the Congress was asked
to authorize pad empower the President to
take measures to secure a full and final ter
mination of hostilities between Spain and
the people of Cuba, and to secure in the is
land the establishment of a stable govern
ment, capable of maintaining order and
observing its international obligations,"in
suring peace and tranquillity anil
proper treatment of its citizens as
well as our own, and for the
accomplishment of those ends to author
ize the military and naval forces of the Unit
ed States, as might be necessary, with added
authority to continue generous relief to the
starving people of Cuba.
ACTION OF CONGRESS
The response of the Congress, after nine
days of earnest deliberation, during which
the almost unanimous sentiment of your
body was developed on every point save as
to the expediency of coupling the prepared
action with a formal recognition of the re
public of Cuba as the true and lawful gov
ernment of that island—a proposition which
failed o, adoption—the Congress, after con
ference, on the 10th of April, by a votcof
42 to 35 in the Semite and .'lll to 6 in the
House of Representatives, passed the mem
orable joint resolution saying:
"First—That the people of the island of
Cuba, are, and by right, ought lo be free
and independent.
"Second—That it is the duty of the I'nited
States and the government of the United
States hereby demand that the government
of Spain at once relinquish its authority in
the island of Cuba and withdraw its land
and naval forces from Cuban and Cuban
waters.
"Third—That the President ofthe United
States be and is hereby directed and em
powered to use the entire land and naval,
forces of the United States, the miJitia of
the several States to such extent as may he
necessary to carry th».ie resolutions into
effect.
"Fourth—That the United States hereby
disclaims any disposition or intention to ex
ercise sovereignty, jurisdiction or control
over said island, except for the pacification
thereof and asserted its determination lhat
when that is accomplished, to leave the
government and control of the island to its
people."
This resolution was approved by the ex
ecutive on April 20. A copy was at once
communicated to the Spanish Minister at
this capital, who forthwith announced that
his continuance in Washington had thereby
becotnt impossible ami ashed lor hi» pass
ports, which were given him. He there
upon withdrew from Washington, leaving
toe protection of Spanish interests in the
United States to the French Ambassador
and the Austria-Hungarian Minister. Sim
ultaneously with its communication to the
Spanish Minister, General Woodford, the
American .Minister at Mailt id, was tele
graphed the confirmation of the text of the
joint resolution and directed to communi
cate it to the government of Spain with the
formal demand that it at once re;ini|ui-!i
it.- authority and government in the island
ol Cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom,
coupling this demand with anrouncemcnts
of the intentions of this government as lo
the future of the island, in conformity with
the fourth clause of the resolution and giv
ing Spain until noon of April 2.1 to reply.
The demand, although as above shown,
< fncially made known to the Spanish en
voy here, was not delivered at Madrid.
mt "j, ' instructions reached General
Woodford, or, the morning of April 21, but
before he could present it, the Spanish
Minister of State notified him th.:t upou
the President's approval Of the joint reeo'u
tion the Madrid government, regarding the
act as equivalent to an evident declaration
of war, had ordered its Minister in Wash
mgton to withdraw, threby breaking off
diplomatic relations between the two coun
tries, and ceasing all official communication
between their respective countries.
General Woodford thereupon demanded
his passports and quitted Madrid the mine
day.
THE CUBAN BLOCKADE
Spain, having thus denied the demand of
theUnitedStates,and initiated that complete
form of rupture of relations which attends
a stale of war, the executive power* author
ized by the resolution were used by me to
meet the enlarged contingency of actual war
between Spain and the United Spates. On
April 22, 1 proclaimed a blockade of the
northern coast of Cuba, including ports on
said coasts between Cardenas and Bahia
Honda and the port of Cienfuegos on the
south coast of Cuba; and on the 23d 1
called for volunteers to execute the pur
pose of the resolution. By my message of
April 25, the Congress was informed of
the situation and I recommended formal
declaration of the existence of a state of
war between the United States and Spain.
The Congress accordingly voted on the
same day the act approved April 85, 188S,
declaring the existence of such war from an.l
including the 21st of April and enacted the
approval of the resolution of April 21, di
recting the President to use all the armed
torce of the nation to carry that act into cf
feet. Due notification of the existence of
war as aioresaid was given April 25. by
telegraph to all the governments with whien
the United States maintained relations, in
order that their neutrality might be assured
during the war. The various governments
responded with proclamations of neutral
ity, each after its own methods. It is among
the least gratifying incidents of the strug
gle that the obligations of neutrality were
impartially discharged by all, often under
delicate and difficult circumstances.
In further fulfillment of international
duty, 1 issued on April 20 a proclamation
announcing the treatment proposed to be
accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to
blockade, contraband, the exercise of the
rights of subjects and the immunity of
neutral Hags and neutral goods under (he
euemy's flag. A similar proclamation was
made by the Spanish government. In the
conduct oi hostilities the rules, of tne decla
ration of Paris, including abstention from
resort to privateering, have accordingly been
observed by both belligerents, although
neither was a party to that declaration.
BEGINNING OF YVAK
Our country thus after an interval of half
a century of peace with all nations found
itself engaged in deadly conflict with a for
eign enemy. Every nerve was strained to
meet the emergency. The response to the
initial call for 125,000 volunteers wus in

tional volunteers. The ranks of the regu
' far army were increased to the limits pro
vided by the act of April 23. The enlisted
force of the navy, on the 15th of August,
when it reached its maximum, numbered
24,123 men and apprentices, One hundred
and three vessels were added lo the navy
by purchase, one was presented to the gov
ernment, one leased and the tour vessels oi
the International Navigation Company, the
St. Paul, St. Louis, New York and Paris were
chartered, in addition to these the revenue
cutters and lighthouse tenders were turned
over to the Navy Department and became
temporarily a part of the auxiliary navy.
The maximum effective fight ing force of the
navy during the war, separated into classes,
was as follows:
Four battleships of the first-class; one bat
tleship of the second class; two armored
cruisers; six coast defense monitors; one
armored ram; twelve protected cruisers;
three unprotected cruisers; eighteen gun

TILE COAST DEFEMBES
Much alarm wns iclt along the entire At
lantic seaconst lest an attack might be made
by the enemy, livery precaution was taken
to prevent possible injury to our great cit
ies lying along the coast. Temporary garri
sons were provided, drawn from the State
militia, infantry aud light batteries were
drawn from the volunteer force. About 12,
---000 troops were thus employed. The coast
signal service was established for observing
the approach of an enemy's ship to the coast
of the United States, and the lighthouse
service co-operated, which enabled tlie Navy
Department to have ail portions of the At
lantic coast, from Maine to Texas, under
observation.
The auxiliary navy was created under the
authority of Congress and was officered and
manned by the naval militia of the several
States. This organization patrolled the coast
and performed the duty of a second arm of
defense.
I'nder the direction of the Chief Engineer
submarine mines were placed al the most
exposed points. Before the war, permanent
mining casemates and stable galleries had
been constructed at all important harbors.
Most of the torpedo material was not to be
found in the market and had to be specially
manufactured. Under date of April 10, dis
trict officers were directed to take all pre
cautionary measures short of the actual at
taching of the loaded mines to the cable, and
on April 22 telegraphic orders were issued
to place the loaded mines iv position.
The aggregate number of mines placed was
1356 at the principal harbors from Maine
to California. Preparations were also made
for the planting of mines at certain other
harbors, but owing lo the early destruction
of the Spanish fleet these mines were not
placed. The Signal Corps was promptly or
ganized and performed service of the most
difficult and important character. Its oper
ations during the war covered the electrical
connection of all coast fortifications, the es
tablishment of telephonic and telegraphic
facilities for the camps at Manila, Santiago
and in Porto Rico. There were constructed
three hundred miles of line at ten great
camps, thus formulating military movements
from those points in a manner heretofore
unknown in military administration. Field
telegraphic lines were established and main
tained under the enemy's Im'nt Manila and
later the Manila-Hong Kong cable was re
opened.
In Porto Rico cable connection was open
ed over a discontinued route, and on laud
the headquarters of the commanding officers
kept up telegraphic and telephonic commun
ication with the divi.-ion commanders on
four different lines of operations*
There was placed in Cuban waters a com
pletely outfitted cable ship with nar cables
and cable gear suitable both for tbe de
struction of communication belonging to the
enemy and the establishment of our own.
Two ocean cables were desl I oyi fj under the
enemy's batteries ot Santiago. Ttte day pre
vious to the landing of General Shelter's
troops at Caimanera, wit inn twenty miles
of the lauding place, cable communication
was established and a cable station opened,
giving direct oonpnunication with the gov
ernment at Washington. This service was
invaluable to the Exeeutivi in directing the
operations of the army aud navy.
MILLIONS FOR DEFENSE
The $50,000,000 fund was i xj ended in large
part by; ti.i- army and navy, and the objects
for which it was used are fully shown in re
ports of the several secretaries. It was a
most timely appropriation, enabling the
government to strengthen its defense and
make preparations greatly needed in case
of war. This fund being inadequate to Ike
requirements of equipment and for the con
duct of the war, the patriotism of the Con
gress provided I he means in the war revenue
act of dune 111 th by authorizing a popular
loan not to exceed three hundred million
dollars, and by levying additional imports
and taxes. Of the authorized loan, two hun
dred millions were oftiered anel promptly
taken, the subscriptions so far exceed
ing the call a-sto cover it many times over,
while, preference being given to tlie smaller
bids, no single allotment exceeding five
thousand dollars. This was v most encour
aging and significant result, showing tlie
vast resources of the nation and the deter
mination of the people to uphold theircoun
try's honor.
It is not within the province of this mes
sage to narrate the history of the extraor
dinary war which followed the Spanish
declaration of April 21st, but a brief recital
of its more salient features is appropriate.
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
The first encounter of the war, in point of
date, took place April 27th, when a detach
meat of the blockading squadron made a
reconnoissance in force at Matanzas, shelled
tiie harbor forts and demolished several new
works iv construction.
The next engagement was destined to mark
a memorable epoch iv maritime warfare.
The Pacific fleet, under Commodore Geo.
Dewey, had lam lor some weeks at Hong
Kong. Upon the colonial proclamation of
neutrality being issued anil the customary
twenty-four hours' notice being given, it re
paired to Mirs Hay, near Hong Kong, when
it proceeded to the Philippine isianas under
telegraphic orders to capture or destroy tho
formidable Spanish fleet then assembled at
Manila. At daybreak on the first of May
the American force entered Manila Hay, anel,
after a few hours' engagement, effected the
total destruction oi the Spanish fleet, con
sisting of ten warships and a transport, be
sides capturing the naval station and torts
at Cavite, thus annihilating the Spanish
naval power in the Pacific ocean and com
pletely controlling the Bay of Manila, with
the ability lo take the city at will.
Not a life was lost on our ships,the wound
ed only numbering seven, while not a vessel
was materially injured. For this gallant
achievement tlie Congress, upon my recom
mendation, fitly bestowed upon the actors
preferment and substantial reward.
"The effect of this remarkable victory upon
the spirit of our people and upon the for
tunes of war was instant. A prestige of in
vincibility thereby attached to our arms,
which continued throughout the struggle.
Reinforcements wehe hurried to Manila,
under the command of Major-General Mer
ritt, and firmly established wifhin sight of
the capital, which lay helpless before our
guns. On the 7th day of May, the Govern
ment was advised officially of the victory at
Manila, and at once inquired of the com
mander of our fleet what troops were re
quired. The information vas received on
the loth day of May, and the lirst army ex
pedition sailed May 25, and arrived at Ma
nila June SO. Other expeditions soon fol
lowed, the total force consisting of U4l of
ficers and 15,058 men.
Only reluctance to cause needless loss of
life and property prevented the storming
and capture of the city, aud thort-with thi
absolute military occupancy of the whole
group. The insurgents meanwhile had re
sumed the active hostilities suspended by
the uncompleted truce of December, ISfff.
Their (orceeinvested Manila from the north
ern and eastern side, but were constrained
by Admiral Dewey' and General Merritt
from attempting an assault. It was fitting
that whatever was to be clone in tlie way of
decisive operations in thut quarter should
be accomplished by the strong arm of tho
United States alone. Obeying the stern
precept of war, which enjoins the overcom
ing of the adversary and the extinction of
his power wherever assailable, as the
speedy, and- sure means to win a peace, di
vided victory was not permissible, for no
partition of the rights anil responsibilities
attending the enforcement of a just and
advantgeous peace could be thought of.
THE ELECT OFF CUBA
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack, powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile,
naval demonstrations were made at several
exposed points. On May llih the cruiser
W ilmington and torpedo boat Winslow were
unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the
batteries at Cardenas, against Matanzas,
Worth P.agiey and four seamen falling,
i hesc grievous fatalities, were, strangely
enough, among the very few which occur
red during our naval operations in this ex
traordinary conflict.
Meanwhile, the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor. A
powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera
which I.ad assembled at the Cape Verde Is
lands before tin outbreak of hostilities, had
crossed the ocean and by its erratic move
ments iv the Caribbean Sea delayed our
military operations, while baffling the pur
suit of our llei ts. For a time fears were felt
'est the Oregon and Marietta, then Bearing
home, after their long voyage from San
Francisco, of over 1.3,000 miles-, might be
surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet, but
their fortunate arrival dispelled the appre
hensions and lent much needed reinforce
ments.. Not until Admiral Cervera took
refuge in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba,
about May Oth, was it practicable to plan a
systematic military attack upon the. Antil
lean possessions of Spain.
Several demonstrations were made on the
coast of Cuba and Porto Rico in pri paration
for the larger event. On May 13th, the
North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan
de Porto Rico. On .May 30th, Commodore
Sehcley s squadron bombarded the forts
guarding the mouth of Santiago Harbor.
Neither attach had any material result. It
was evident that well-ordered land opera
tions were indispensable to achieve a de
cided advantage.
Till-: MEHRIMAC INCIDENT
The next act in the war thrilled not alone
flic hearts ol our countrymen, but the world
by its exceptional heroism. On the lufcht
of June 3d, Lieutenant Hobson, backed by
seven volunteers, blocked the narrow out
let Irom Santiago Harbor by sinkinc the
collier Merriinac in the channel, under a
iev( re lire from the shore batteries, escaping
With their lives a* by a miracle, but failing
into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a
most gratifying incident ot the war that the
bravery of this little band of heroes was
cordially appreiuaed by the Spaniards, who
sent a.flag0) truce to notify Admiral Samp
son of their salety and to compliment them
upon their daring act. They were subse
quently exchanged July 7th.
By June 7th. the cutting of the last Cu
ban cable tsloated the island. Thereafter the
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
.June 10th under a heavy protecting fire,
a lanibng force oi tiHO marines from the
Oregon, Marble-head and Yankee was cf- |
tcctcd on Guantanamo Bay, where it had j
been determined to establish a naval sta- i
,tion. This important and essential port was
