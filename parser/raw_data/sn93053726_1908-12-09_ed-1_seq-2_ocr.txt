President Roosevelt must hava
known his message, although long
enough, was going to be a pretty
tame affair, soon the eve of its pub
lication the bitter attack on Editors
Smith and Laffan was brought to
light. The letter overtops the mes
sage by a long ways, and it looks as
though we have not heard the last
of the letter yet.
The demand that skins of animals
i or hides as they are called, shall be
j placed upon the free list has been so
! urgently pushed at recent tariff hear
ings that there is hope that the tariff
on them may at least be reduced.
With free hides, shoe and leather
manufacturers it is thought will con
cede the abolition of duties on all
leather products. It is not the far
mer or the cattle king who benefits
by a high tariff on hides. The beef
trust alone is the beneficiary.

The recently appointed new Becre
tnry of the nuvy has announced hif
method for reforming the bureau
system which naval crit'es hold re
sponsible for the Ineffectiveness and
clumsiness noted by them in the de
bigning of warships and the defects
alleged by them to exiHt in vessels ol
very recent construction. The way
in which the secretary is expecting
to provide himself with boar:l equiva
lent to a general staff or admiralty,
says a Washington writer, is by a
department order creatin,; .1 general
board, of which the admlra: of the
navy, the chief of the bureau of navi
gation and the president ti" the naval
war college by Hie appoi Uiueni cf
"such other officers" as the secretary
may designate. Secretary Newberry
will no doubt appoint a board of the
aggressive critics of t he bureau sys
tem; also young and progressive offi
cers of the line. It is proposed to
bring the departmental bureaus into
close relations with this board, by
designating as members a suitable
contingent of staff officers, including
members of the construction hoard.
The reorganization proposed, it io
thought, will tend to the promotion
of a unity of purpose that has been
lacking in the administration of that
branch of the service which has to
do with building and equipping war
ships. It is well known in naval cir
cles that Senator Hale of Maine, who
is the chairman of the committee on
naval affairs in the senate, is an in
surmountable obstacle to the im
provement of the navy. He has been
opposed to large ships and it is sig
nificant that a large number of the
small ships have been built at ship
yards in his state, where owing to
the shallowness of the water, only
small ships can be launched. His in
fluence is paramount in naval affairs
and has been paralyzing to the navy
and very expensive to the county.
PUBLIC RIDICULE.
The Time When It Served as Punish
ment For Lawbreakers.
It Is the problem of all ages to make
the punishment tit the crime, but they
seem to have come nearer its solution
in Plantagenct times than they ever
were after the introduction of flogging.
Yv'hon burglary meant the total ruin
of the man who kept his whole for
tune in his house the burglar was
hanged. Hut in the same period pub
lic ridicule served as a punishment for
most crimes, and the man who sold
bad meat was placed in the pillory and
his bad meat burned to windward of
him; the vintner who sold bad wine
was forced to drink some of it and the
rest was poured over his head; for
more serious offenses the criminal had
to walk along Cheapside bareheaded,
dressed only in a shirt and carrying a
wax taper, escorted by the mayor's
sergeants.
The result was that law and order
were maintained far better than when
men became brutalized by the horrible
floggings of Georgian times.
Punishments became worse with re
ligious persecutions, and after the ref
ormation the pillory, with its terrible
accompaniment of slit ears, whippings,
etc., became popular, to say nothing of
torturing, burning at the stake, and so
on. At St. Thomas' hospital one of
the sisters, "for a grave offense, cou
trarie to ye lawe of Oed and according
to the proffe of three wytnesses," was
ordered to "be punished and have xll
strypes well laid on."
But all this, bud as it was, was less
demoralizing than the terrible crimi
nal code of George IP's reign, when
there were forty-eight crimes punish
able by death and forty punishable
by -whipping, transportation or pil
lory. Flogging for mere vagrancy be
gan with Henry VIII., and as late
as 1S04 six women were publicly whip
ped at Gloucester for this unavoidable
offense. And never did public morali
ty sink so low.
In those good old days we flogged
our suilormen "to encourage the oth
ers," and there were many trussed at
the triangles who would now be sim
ply admonished. A pleasant form of
punishment was "flogging through the
fleet." It was given to the ignorant
sailorwan who struck a superior ofB
cer. And when he had been carried
from one ship to another and flogged
in each he ; iirvived If he w as unfor
tunatefor six months. The lucky
man died accidentally. London Chron

Dear Santa Clans, I thought I'd write
These few lines to you tonight
Just to tell you everything
We would like to have you bring.
For If they don't come from you
Goodness knows what we shall do!
Tommy wants a coaster sled
And a sweater (blue and red),
Football, too, anil skates and soma
Chocolate candy and a drum.
Johnny wants a phonograph
(Singing songs that make you laugh),
Choo-choo cars that really go
And a horn that he can blow;
Thon he wants a hobby horse
And porno candy, too. of course.
Katie wants a doll that cries
'Ta" and "Ma" and shuts Its eyes,
With some cowns and hats to fit
And such things that go with It.
(She would like some dishes, too,
,And a doll's house painted blue.
IMamma wants a dinner set,
:And she'd also like to get
Earrings and some bric-a-brao
And a lovely sealskin sack.
There, now; that's enough to bring
I don't want a blessed thing
For myself, for I'm so small
I don't really count at all.
Oh. I'm very small, I'm told.
Though I'm thirty-five years old!
Just supply this list 1 send
Ar.d I'll be your grateful friend.

Linonine
(
The Flax Seed
Emulsion )
Beware of Golds !
Most fatal sicknesses have their begin
nings in a simple "cold" or in a slight
cough. Consumption first shows in a
cough. Bronchitis is accompanied by a
cough. The first stage of La Grippe is a
"cold." Pneumonia is preceded by cough
and violent "cold." Croup that terrible
malady of childhood comes solely as a
condition of a "cold." Rheumatism gen
erally follows neglect after exposure and
the consequent "cold" or cough. Kidney
Troubles, including Bright's disease and
other fatal complications, are often due to
a ' 'cold" which settles in that region.
Linonine will cure you if there is any
cure for you.

who last Pall bought the number of yards of goods indicated
on the envelope of a well-known pattern as necessary for
that garment. When she came to cut it she spent half a
day trying to lay it out and then found it required at least
another yard of goods at one dollar a yard.
We have a message for that woman. With each
Pictorial Review Pattern there is given a Cutting and a
Construction Guide which will show her how to lay out
her pattern on the goods in three minutes with absolutely
no possibility of error or waste. And it will require only
the number of yards of material stated on the envelope
positively not an inch more. We want that woman to go
to oar agency in this city and find out all about these facts.
