THE CURRENCY.

for - sxistsiaca
neccaeary for teinKrary parpoeea the raiaing of
large aiinia of money from whatever aource at
tainable. It wiie m.dc neceeeary In the wiadoro
ol C'onc"!?., and I do not doubt tbeir wladont in
the premises, regarding the necessity of the times,
to daxl'o a aysti'm or aalional currency, which It
4 H proveH to bo-imposelblt to keep on a par with
I. the recognleed currency of the clvlllaed world.
wTms begot a apirit of speculation, Involving an
extravagance and luxury not reqnlred for the
happiness or .prosperity of a people, ana involv
ing, both directly and ludirectlv, foreign
indebtedness. The mrrnncr, being of a flnctn
ating value and unsafe to nold for legitimate
transactions requiring money, became a subject
of speculation In itself. . Theae twa causes,
however, hnve Involved na in a foreign
Indebtedness contracted In good faith by the
borrower and the lender, which should be paid In
train and accmirrng to the bond agreed upon when
fthe debt wax contracted gold or Its equivalent,

Mn mrktoiight for nrodncta of the toll and

pay these debts. Where a market can be created
for the enle- of our products, either of
the son, the mine or the manufactory,
a new means is discovered of utilizing
onr idia capital and labor ta the advantage of the
whole (Miopia; but In my Judgment the first
atep toward accomplishing this object Is
to secure a currency good wherever clv
, Ulzaiiuu xeigna one which, IX it bocomea

J ket With some other a currency which has as ita
basis the labor necessary to produce it, which
I will give it value. Gold and silver are now the
recognUea medium of exchange the civilized
' Jaorld over, and to ibis we should return with tha
raaat wraoHcable delay.- " - -
In view of the pledges of the American Congress
r t 1 luii nur iirqnevi. ivgiii-icnuur vyvitrm waf aiopi-
ant tlie rtyt sontiacted, there should be
no delnv. certuinlv no nnnecesssrv deluv. in fix.
Ing by legislation a method by which we will re
turn to specie. To the accomplishment or this
cud I invite your special attention. I believe
lirmly that tliiira can bo no prosperoua and per
manent revival of business and the lndutrie un
til a poMcaria adopted, with legislation to carrv II
out, looking to a return to a specie basia. It la
easy to conceive that the debtor and speculative
classes may think It of value to make a so
called money abundant until they can throw a
portion of their burdens upon others; but even
these, I belisve, would be disappointed by the
result if a course should be pursued which will
keep iu doubt the value of the legal-tender me
dium of exchange. A revival of the productive
Industries is needed by all classes, and by none
Biore than the holders of property, of whatever
sort, with debts to liquidate from the realization
7 lupon Us e.ilee.- But. admitting that the two
classes of cituena referred to are to be benefit
ed by expansion, would it be honest to give It!
W011LW not the general loss be too great to
Jnstir. Mich relief? Would it not be Just
as honest and prudent to authorize each
debtor to Issue his own Ugal-tendera to
the extent of his liabilities as to do this;
Would it not ita- safer, for fear of over-issues
by unscrupulous creditors, to say tbat all
diibls and obligations- are obliterated In the
Vnited State., and now we commence anew, each
.. pussuMlng all ho has at the time free from in
f. I'umbruncef Thee propositions are too absurd
,10 be. entertained for a moment by thinking poo-
pic: Kvery delay In the preparation for final re
sumption partakes of Luis . dishonesty, and
tOreily less t in' degree at the hope
fa-'nela ont that a convenient season will
at last arrive for the good work of
'"'"TefTeeihlng our pledges to commence. It will
.Pevur cuuie, in my opinion, except by the post

..Vhichs will destroy for a time at least the credit

is in the power of Congress at this session to
;. devise uch legislation aa will renew conn

re.. of proHpoiiit ta last for many years, and to
save the credit 01 the nation and of the people.

Onf relsflons with rhlnS enntlnus In ti. ivtna.
ly. Dnrlth past rear the fear of hostntttna
between China and Japan, growing ant r the
landing of an armed ioree upon the island of
Fomiosa by the latter, hat occasioned uneasi
ness. It la earnettly hoped, however, that the
dim. nliles arising from this causa will be ad
junct, and that (lie advance of civilisation In
thrse Knilrea may noi be retarded by a slate of
war.' In consequence of the part taken by cer
tain rltltens of the lulled Hlates In this
expedition onr representatives In those coun
tries aavo been Instructed to Impress stpon tbe
Government oU bin and Japan th firm Inten
tion of this eonntrv toeiaintaln a strict neutrality
In thewiit Ol kottllliii. and earerully prevent
any Infraction Of law on the, part of
onr citizens. In connection with this sub
ject I call the attention of Congresa to
a generally conceded fact that the great
poportkn pf Chlnena immigrant, who come to
onr shores do not come voluntarily to mako
their homes with u. and their labor pro
ductive of general prosperity, hut thev coma nn
dercsMMriwlth head men. who own them- al
most absolutely. In a worse form do, till,
apply to the Chinese women. Hardly a per
ceptible pare on togs of them perforin ,any honor
able labor. They aro brought for shameful pur
poses, to the disgrace of the communities where
Ihey have settled, and to the great demoralisa
tion of the youths of those localities. If this
evil practice can be legislated against it will be
my pleasure as well as duty to enforce aiiyeg
uiutlvn to seenre to desirable an end.; .
' It la hoped that negotiations between the Oov
vemoieiiror ,Iava and the treaty powers, looking
to the further opening nf tha empire and to the
removal of various restrictions upon trade and
travel, mar soon produce the result desired, which
cannot full to Inure to the benefit af ail the par
ties. Having on previous oecaslono submitted
to the consideration of Congress the propriety
of the release of the Japanese Government from
tha further payment or indemnity un
der the convention of October il, lHol. and
as no action bat been taken therein, It be
come, my duty to regard the obligations ol
the convention as In force, and. ss the other
powers interested have obtained their - por
tion of the Indemnity rn full, the Minister ol
the United States in Japan has. In behalf of
this Government, received the remainder of
tha amount doe to the United .Slates under
the Convention of Siraouseky. I submit the pro
priety of applying the Income of a part, if not
the whole, of this fund to the education in the
Japanese language of a number of youug meu, to
be under obligations to serve the Government for
a speaifted time aa Interpreters at the legation
and the consulates In Jupan. A limited number
of Japanese youths might at the same time be
educated in our own vernacular, and mutual ben
efit would result to both Governments. The Im
portance of having our own citlxens competent
and familiar with the langns'.'i ot Japan to act
as Interpreters and In other capacities connected
with the legation and consnlalea In that country
cannot readily be over-estlmnted.
The amount awarded to the Government of
Great Britain by the commission "orsamzed nn
dcr the provisions of the Treaty ot Washington,
in settlement of the claims of British subjects
arising from acta committed between April 18.
18t. and April , lfViJ, became payable under
term, of the treaty within the past year, and was
paid upon the Slat day of September. 1874.
ALIEN CLAIMS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES.
In this connection I renew my recommenda
tion, made at the opening of the last se.sion of
Congress, tbat a special court ba created to hear
and report all claims of alien, against the tutted
State arising from act. committed against their
persons or property during the insurrec
tion. It appears equitable '.list oppor
tunity should be offered to cltizena of other
States to present their claims, aa well as
those Tlrltlsh subjects whose claims were not
admissible under the late commission, to the
oarly decision of some competent tribunal. To
this end I recommend the necessary legislation
to organize a court to dispose of those claims of
liens of the nature referred to in an equitable
and satisfactory manner, and to relieve Congress
and the departments from the consideratiou of
theae question..
THE COLONY OF NEWFOUNDLAND.
The legislation necessary to extend to the col
ony of Newfoundland certain articles of the Treaty
of aahiugton of the 81 ti of Mar. leil. having
been had. a protocol to that effect woa signed In
behalf of the Uuited States and of Orcat Britain
on thexSlh day of Muv last, and was duly pro
claimed on the following dav. A copy of the
proclamation is submitted herewith.
THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY.
A copy of the report of the Commission ap
pointed under the act of March iw. I7i. for sur
veying and mnrkiai tho boundary between the
Vnited staces and ike Driiisb Posses.-dons. from
the Lake or the Woods to the summit uf ihe Kocky
Mountains, is herewith transmitted. I am happv
to announce that tha Held work of the Com
mission has been completed, and the entire Hue.
from the northwest comer of the Lake ol
the Woods to the summit of the Kockv
Mountains, has been ruu and marked upon the
surlsceof the earth, it is believed that the
amount remaining unexpended of the appropria
tion made at the last session of Congress will In
lUlHc.ient to complete Ihe ofrke work. 1 recom
mend that the autnority of Congress be given to
use the unexpended balance of the appropriation
iu the completion ol ihe work ol the Commis
sion Iu making the report and printing the neces
sary map.
THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.
The court known as the Court of Commission
ers of Alabama Claims, created by an act of
Congress the lust session, has. organized aud
commenced the work, and it is to be hoped that
the claims admissible under the provisions ol
the act may be speedily ascertained and iaid. ,
UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND REAL ESTATE IN

advisable to exercise the

bv the Government of Turkey for the privilege of

real estate in the former country by assenting to
a certain change lu the Jurisdiction of the courts
In the latter. A copy of the proclamation upon
these subjects is herewith cominuuicauid. . -
MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA.
There has been no material change lu our rela
tions with Ihe Independent States of this hemis
phere which we-e formerlr under the dominion
of Spain. Marauding on the frontiers between
Mexico and Texas still frequently takes place,
despite the vigiluucu of ihe civil and military au
thorities iu that quarter. .The diffleulty of
tiiecKiug such trespasses along the course of a
river of such length as the K10 Grande, and so
often fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that the
efforts of this Government will be seconded by
those of Mexico to the effectual suppression ur
acts of wrong
From a report upon the condition of the busi
ness before the American and Mexicau Joint
Claims Conimi. sinn. made hi- Ihe agent 011 the

remained to be dlspi-ejor. Since the date of
such report other e aims have been disposed
of. reducing somewhat the number still

in view of these figures and of tho fact mat the

that for the current fiscal year the utima'ed re

iu that stale. Tula call was made In

was elected Lieuteuant-lvovernnr in ,873 and call

JUDICIAL AFFAIRS.

valuable fccommendatlona relating to thi ad

1 respectfully suggest to Congress Ihe propriety
of Increasing the number ol' the judicial dis
tricts la tbe tniled Stairs to eleven, the pr-cnt
nnmber being nine, and liia creation of two addi
tional Judgeships. The territory to lie traversed
by the Circuit Judges Is so great and the business
of the conns to steadily increasing that ii is
growing more and more impossible fur them to
keep up with ihe business. requiring ibeir aituu
tion. Whether this wonld involve the necessity
of adding two mure Justices of the Supreme
court to the present nuuib-r 1 submit to ths
Judgment of Congress,
THE INTERIOR.
The attention of Congress is Invited to the re
port of the Secretary of the Interior and to tho
iegi.latiort asked for by hiin. The domestic in
fcrcis of the people are more Intimately con
nected with this department than Willi
either of lha other department, of tho Gov
ernment, lia duties have been added to
from lime to time nntil they have become
ao onerous that, without tha most - perfect
system and order. It will be impossible fur any
Secretary of the Interior to keep trace of all
official transactions having bit sanction and done
in ui. . rue. and for which he la held personally
responsible.
1 lie policy adopted for the management of In
dian ailairs known aa tbe "peace policy" has

THE CIVIL SERVICE.
The rules adopted 10 Improve the elvil service
of ihe woverument have been adhered 10 a.
closely as has becu practicable with the oppo
sition with which tuey meet. The effect of it
boa been beueiiciat on tha whole and baa
tended lo the elevation of the service; but it is
impracticable to maintain them without the di
rect and positive support of Congress. Gener
slly. the support which this reform receives is
from those who give it their etipiiort only to find
fault when the rules are appareuily departed
irom. Kcn-tovals from office without preferring
charges atraiiist parties removed are frequently
cited as departures from tbe rules adopted, and
the reteution of those against whom charges are
made by irresponsible person, and without good
f rounds is also oflen condemned as a vto
ition of them. Under thee) circumstances,
thereforo, 1 announce that, if Congress adjourn,
without positive legislation on the subject of
"civil service reform," I will regard-such ac
tion as a disapproval of the eysiem. aud will
abandon it. Kxcept so far as 10 require examina
liwtis ior certain appointees to determine their

doned. The gentlemen who have given their services
W ithout compensation as member, of the Board

ment of the country, civil service have shown
much seal and earnestness in their wurk, aud lo
them, as well as to luvself, it will be a source ol
mortincaiion if It is to ha thrown awav. But I
repeat that it is Impossible to carry this system
to a successful issue without general approval
and assistance, and positive law lo support it.

U. S. GRANT.
EXECUTIVE MANSION, Dec. 7, 1874.
The Report of Secratary of the
Treasury.
In his report the Secretary of the Tren'nry re
capitulates the transsctlons attptiriing the re
funding or the debt; that ssccessfiil Iddacrs have
taken up all former hids snd hold options for the
rest mini Feb. 1. The sinking fund is over f iO.
("10 not) behind. The Secretary not only takes
strong iTnuiid in favor or specie pavnient, bnt
sets lurth a definite pian for reaching the same.
He recommends the repeal of tbe Legal-Tender
act at a fixed day. As lo contract, thereafter
made, aud except at to official salaries and ordl
narv expenditure, of tbe Government under ex
isting appropriations, the Secrelarv recommends
thai authority be given for Ihe immediate issue
oi convertible bonds bearing a low rale of inter
est. He aks that a day may be axed for the re
sumption of specie pavment. not more remote
than three years, at the end of that time tbe Sec
retary to be authorized to raise gold by selling
bonds to tuch amounts as may become necessary,
from time to time, to keep the Treasury in condi
tion to redeem greenback, as preseuted. It i.
recommended that fractional currency bs re
placed by silver, and to accomplish this the Sec
retary desires to sei the mints all at wor- coin
ing silver, and that as rapidly as it
ls produced Ihe fractional currency lie recalled
and destroyed, beginning with the smallest de
nomination.. 7'ue Secretary also asks that the
coinage of gold he made fiee in the United Stales,
as it is in London, in order to prevent the ex
portation oi bullion for coinage. In regard to
printing all varieties gf Government notes, bonds
aud stamps, the Secretary recommends that the
w hole be docs exclusively at ths Treasury De
partment. Government has all tha necessary
machinery, obtaiued at great cost, and all the
needed facilities. It can perform tbe work
at the same or a less cost than private
firms, when the cost of transportation by ex
press ls considered. Aside from these minor
considerations, ibe Secretary regards Ihe ques
tion of ssfety aa one which should control. At
tbe end of the present contracts, or as soon as
they ran be legally terminated, hs recommends
that all tbe work of this nature We performed in
the printing division of the Treasury.
The Secretary recommends free banking as
part of the pian for the resumption of specie pay
ment, and this branch of the subject is not elabo
rated. Concerning Internal revenue the Secretary
recommends that the tax be taken off bank
checks, matches, coi-metics and drugs, aud lo
meet this los. an additional tax of ten cents per
rallun bs im posed ou whisky. This will raise the
revenue a little greater than is now received from
the articles enumerated. The practical workings
of putting tea and cott'ee on the free list have been
fullyexamtned hy tbe Treasury Department. Care-fmly-prepared
table, of prices tn foreign markets
and prices to consumers for a period subsequent
to the taking olf of the tax show tbat. while the
country lust from iS.(XM,uuO to li.t)00.uuo from
the decrease of revenue on this account, tha re
moval of the tax simply added to the price in
foreign markets and has nut benefited consumers
here in tbe least. The Secretary recommends
the restoration of this tax.
The attention of Conei ess Is called to the great
danger to the revenue uTteudiug all attempia to
modify the penalties which have heretofore ex
isted, and which the Treasury has sought to en
force. The Secretary is no believer in the system
of moieties, and does not desire iu restoration in
any shape; but he expresses seriou. doubt,
whether ny benefit has followed certain modifi
cation, of penalties for the violation of customs
regulations.
The Secretary does not regard the Treasury De
partmeut aa a proper place tor the adjudication
of cotton cases. These are for tbe most part of
a complicated character, require the taking of
nittcn evidence, ana a Judicial investigation, us
therefore recommends that all cotton cases be
withdrawn at once from the jurisdiction of the
Treasury and turned over to tbe courts.
L'uon the Question of tariff ths Secretary, with
out euteriug upon much discussion, says at pres
ent It is ouly necessary to treat it purely as a
question of revenue, aud not one cither of pro
lection or free trade, lu the interest of business
he does not think any changes sbuuld be hastily
made, and if Congress desires lo revise the pres
eut rate, he recommends that a commission be
appnluted to take the whole subject into consid
eration, with Lustruciiou. to report to tha next
cod ere...
Great economy I. recommended In the expendi
ture, for public building.. The secretary recom
mends tbat Congresa gu over the appropriations
snd estimates for these work, with great care,
with a view of reducing some aud wholly sus
pending others, lie expre.se. the belief that the
needa of lbs Government do not require such
elaborate and costly structures as have of late
been erected, but that plainer, and at Ihe same
lime substantial, building, will answer every
purpose, and save many millions. Hs thinks
there Is needless extravagance iu furnishing pub
lic buildings, and that much greater economy
should bs practiced in all direcnous in this mat
ter. He has transmitted the estimatea. which
have already been carefully revised, but ha ear
uastly requests Congress lu uuite with him In
scauulng them .till mora cloauly, with a view to
their ruriher reduction.
Tha force of lua departmeut has bsen reor
ganised and dimiuished exactly in accordance
with the laws aud appropriations of lust session,
but the Secretary thinks Ibe lowest hunt of
economy cousisteut with prompt and efficient
performance ot public business has nut yet been
reached.
'1 he Secretary due. not believe the present con
dition of the Goverumeul justifies the extending
of aid lu any form lo private enterpriaes of auy

Failure or Success in Life.
1If.se are useful suggestions from a
member of the British I'.n liauieu tv I.ord
Derby, who is a robu.it, manly man. lie
says: . , ,
"Take two men, if they could' be
fouud, exactly alike in mental aud bodily
aptitudes, and let one go on carelessly
and idly, indulging his appetites aud
generally leading a life of pleasure, and
ict the other train himself by early . hours,
by temperate habits, and by giving to
muscles aud brain each their tair share of
employment, and at the end of two. or
three years they will be as wide apart in
their capacity for exertion as if they bad
been born with wholly different constitu
tions. Without a normal heal ihy condi
tion there can, as a rule, be no good
work; and though that qualification can
not absolutely be secured 'or preserved
hy any rules, a little common sense and
care will go a long way both in securing
and preserving It. On tbat point I would
give you these hints: First, That it is not
mental labor that hurts anybody, unless
the excess be very great, but rather fret
ting and fidgeting over tho prospect, of
labor to be gone through j so that thd
man who can accustom hlnself to take
things coollv, which is quits aa much
matter or dUclpllne as of nature, nd
who, by keeping well beforehand with
what he lias to do, avoids undue hurry
aud nervous excitemout, has a great
vantage over one 4'hf follows sdiflorerf
practice. Kext I would, warn you, Unit
those students who think they have no
time for bodily exercise will sooner or
later have to find time for illness. Third,
when an opportunity of choice is given,
morning work is generally better than
night work; and lastly a matter which
I ahotild uot stop to allude to but that
know the dangers of an over-driven exists
enee in a crowded town -if a man cannot
get through hi day's labor, l wltl-vef
kind it mav be, without artificial aups
port, it should be a serious t oushiei 'U.-tt
for hltu whether that kind of
for him at all." Prom tin J'hrtmUvsicul
