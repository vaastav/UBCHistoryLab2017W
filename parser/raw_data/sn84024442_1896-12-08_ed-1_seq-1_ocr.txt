It Was a Very Dreary Task and
Every One "Was Glad When It Was
Completed Senators Whose Ab
sence Canned Reumrlt Gen. Curtis
; the Victim of I?ieltpoeUets.
" -All tlie flags at the Capitol -were float
ing yesterday, the first time since Inst June.
Both branches, of Congress convened and
the nctlve "Work or tlie bhorc session will
begin today. Tins, morning a caucus of
ltepublican Senators will an emptto decide
on a policy to be pursued this "winter.
Even the bolting Republican Senators have
been invited to attend and an interesting
time is anticipated.
Nothing was donein tlie r-enate yesterday
except to listen to the reading or tlie
President's message. Mr. Call tried to
Introduce a resolution, reported to be the
asking for an investigation into the alleged
Interference or corporate influences in the
Florida election, but Mr. Hale, who had the
floor, suavely insisted on his motion to
udjourn.
A DREARY TASK.
Tlie reading or the message commenced
nt 1:40 o'clock. Secretary Oox read the
lirst paragraph cr two and then it was
turned over to the reading clerk. It was
u wearisome job. that wading through 1S,
1)00 words, and every one was glad, an
liour and lilty minutes later, when it was
finished.
At lirst the various Senators settled
themselves down to listen with a great
show of interest to what was being read.
It was very noticeable from the start
that more Republican Senators were in
their seats than Democrats. This pro
portion was maintained all through the
reading. The representatives or the liarty
winch eiecteu Mr. Cleveland lour years ago
were the Iat to do him reverence at tlie
presentation of his last regular mestase
to Congress.
It lenuired only a few minutes before
the attention of Senators began to lag.
One after one they dropped out into the
cloak rooms, taking with them printed
copies of the message, which they in---.iii

time. In some instances they came back
again into the chamber to relieve some
colleague, but as a rule when they were
once out thev ta ved out.
l "When the reading of the message was
C-rtt
finished there were not more than a score
of Senators in their seats and twelve to
rirteen of these were Republicans. It
required only- a minute to pass the resolu
tion to lay tlie message on the table and
then the adjournment motion of Mr. Hale
was rushed through. Itis fair to imagine
that tlie document will remain on the table
and never be referred to except by some
n.- ii. u.ii.u - uu4 a Hill,; .u ide uiliulll
istration. DIPLOMATS OUT IN FORCE.
Tlie attendance in the diplomatic gal
lery was unusually large, but every one
left after the Cuban and Venezuelan ques
tions had been disposed of. Sir Julian
Pauncefote occupied one of the front
chairs. A large delegation from the Span
ish legation was present, and all the South
American diplomats were represented.
Their interest was confined, of course,
to the foreign pohcj outlined and they
too.k no further interest after that.
Tne galleries were very well filled up
to the time of adjournment. Tlie new
opera chain, have made a decided hit.
Everyone was immensely pleased with the
improvements made in the chamber In the
balls the temperature was kept at a most
pleasant height, but In the galleries it was
rather warm. This was the first day
though, for the testing of the new ventilat
ing and heating apparatus, and a large
crowd was present It is promised
that today its working will be more satis
factory. The absence of several Senators was
very marked yesterday. Mr. Allison Is
fcick at his home, and could not be here
Many inquiries concerning his condition
were made Senator Stewart was not in
his seat, and the great silver champion
was missed it was thought that he would
have enjoyed the shivers the blind chap
lain gave the Senate -hen he referred in
bis prayer to the last election.
Senator Teller was another whose sent
was empty He has been detained, and will
not reach here for a week vet. Senator
George, of Mississippi, s pick and his co'
league, Mr. Walthall, asked for bim, and
obtained, an Indefinite leave of absence.
Senator Hill was not present when tlie roll
was called, but dropped in later, and
listened to a part of the message. He look
ed as if the late election had removed a
burden from his shoulders.
SIXTEEN TO ONE.
Tia flowers presented to Senators yes
terday were numerous and costly. A queer
thing happened before noon. As the bou
quets and baskets come in they are placed
at once on the desks or the Senators for
whom they are intended. It so happened
that a number for Republican Senators
came In all at once, and at one time there

BATTLED WITH THE WAVES
French Line Steamer La Champagne
Had a Rough Voyage.
Unue Wave Hrolte Over ITer Decks,
Twisting Things About Generally.
Passengers Terror ScricRcn.
New York, Dec 7. Seldom has the
stanch steamship La Champagne had so
rough a voyage as she experienced the
past wet'k. The big vessel came to her
pier at : o'clock this ir. rnlng bearing
the marks or a decidedly rouglt and tumble
combat with old Father Neptune. Her
bridge rail was bent and twisted by the
force of the waves, and things on the
forward oeek were generally askew. She
had pitched and tossed in a veritable bea
cyclone for two days.
The passengers suffered a great fright
and there were many expressions of in
tense reher as each set fool on terra firma
once more,.
La Champagne bad a very smooth voy
age until December ", when she ran into
a hurricaee. It was the same storm Uiat
did so much damage to the coasters ofr
tlie Carolinas Tuesday and Wednesday.
The big ship tossed and rolled fearfully,
for the waves were running mountain high,
as Capt. Poicot said this morning. The
passengers took to their cabins, the decks
were cleared, and even" tlie ship's crew
had difficulty in keeping at work. Sea
after sea washed over her weather bows
The storm continued throughout Tues
day, and increased in violence. At 10
o'clock Wednesday morning a tremendous
sea washed down over the decks and left
the railing of the bridge twisted and bent
like a mil fence Some of the tackle of the
davits was broken, but the ship kept her
boats.
The greater part or the passengers were
very sick long before the storm started, and
the cabins and steerage were a scene of
misery, and though none of them doubted
the ability of the vessel to ride out the
storm, they were thoroughly dejected.
Capt I'oirotsaid that it was the harOest
storm he had encountered for years The
damage to the vessel, lie thought, was not
very serious, although her bridge was a
wreck. Capt. Poirot was lucky to come
into port with the vessel, as he had been
on the biidge but a short time liefore it
was reduced to a wreck. The whole deck
presented a decidedly battered appearance
Incoming vessels from the southward con
tinue to bring stories of heavy weather.
The British steamer Euclid, from Saltos,
Victoiia and St. Lucia, which arrived to
day, reports that on November 28 and 20,
off Guadalupe, she encountered an east
northeasthurricane. which lasted forty-eight
hours, the ves-el being compelled to heave
to for thirty-six hours.
The Liverpool ship Westgate, from Bar
badoes, while off Abccotnoii November 28
ran into a heavy gale and was blown to
sea to the southward of Hattcras.
The San Marcos, from New Orleans, had
strong northeast gales all the way up.

Congressmen Discuss Cleve
land's Cuban Policy.
PARTY DICTATES OPINION
Some Are Disappointed at His
Stand While Others Praise
His Caution.
Comments on the President's message
to Congress, which was published in full
in The Evening Times of jesterdaj, were
principally devoted to the treatment of the
Cuban question.
Expressions by members of Congress on
Mr. Cleveland's reference to finance and
other Issues were of course largely tinged
by part affiliations. On Cuba, however,
partisan lines were obliterated, and the
following expressions indicate the senti
ment in legislative circles.
GEN. GROSVENOR, Rep., Ohic "The
treatment of the Cuban and other foreign
matters will not be satisfactory to those
who have to earnestly hoped for tlie early
action of our country in the interests of an
early cessation of wholesale murder in the
unhappy Island of Cuba. The discussion of
the question Is rather an ai ology for delay
and non-act.on than the taking of a ttrong
and decisive position iq on the situation."
GEN WHEELER, Hem., Alabama "It
is conceded in the message that the power
exercised by Spain is limited to maintain
ing an imperfect government in the larger
towns and subuibs and that the rest of
oftheislandistontrolled by the Cubans, who
up to this time, have io skillfully conducted
their warfare Unit the Spanish army has
not been able to subdue or defeat tliem,
and It also admits that the Cubans have
gamed in numbers and resources.
"The condition of our &t niggling patriots
of the reolutiou could hardly be said to
bebetterthan thatdcscribed in the message.
It admits that the Spaniards have been un
able to advance from the coast while dur
ing our struggle fiom 1775 to 17S1 tlie
British army traveistd the colonies several
times from one end to the other.
"In tlie North American Review or No-i
vembcr 1 , 1&73, I insisted upon a firm
and bold stand by our country on the
Venezuelan question and I believe a
firm btand with regard to Cuba woull
reccive the approval of the civilized
world."
MR. M'CREARY, Dem. "I am pleasojl,
with the President's reference to the Cuban
and Venezuelan questions and the tar'ff.
Wiiile I sympathize with the Cuban patriots,
and hope some day to see Cuba a free aud
independent republic, I did not expect the
President, so near the close of his term,
to recommend any legislation which might
interrupt the friendly relations existing
between us and Spain or which might lead
to war."
MR. TAFT, Rep., Ohio "The President
lias stated the position of the United
States forcibly. He shows that we have
responded to all the duties demanded by
international law. What he says may be
considered as a notfee to Spain that the
present condition cannot continuelndelin
itely. The President leaves it an open
question whether or not he will interfere.
It looks as if he intended to turn the Cuban
question over to Mr. McKinley for settle
ment.' MR. LOUD, Republican, of California
"Tlie position of the President on Cuban
afrairs should receive the commendation,
of all Americans. It is dignified, yet It
is sufficiently aggressive to intimate to
Spain that this country is anxiously watch
ing events in Cuba, with the hope that fur
ther efrusion of, blood and needless loss of
property may be prevented in some honor
able manner without outside intervention."
MR. BARTLETT, Democrat, New York,
expressed the. opinion that "the time had
come when the United States should inter
fere in the struggle between Cuba aud
Spain. The United States had waited long
enough for Spain to put down the so-called
insurrection."
MR. PATTERSON, Democrat, Tennessee
'The President's treatment of the Cuban,
question is patriotic and statesmanlike
and r believe he has pointed out the way
for an honorable settlement of a vexed
problem."
MR. DOLLIVER, Republican, Iowa
WHILE THE MESSAGE WAS .BEING READ
ffil THE
EOPLE SI?-
"The message practically dodges the Cuban
problem." -
MR. BARRETT, Republican, Massachu
setts "The message sljoTvs Lhnt the. atf
ministration will do notli. regarding Cu
ba. An attempt will beinade to get Con
gress to force him into some radical meas
ures. I do not believe that it will suc
ceed. Time and the Hawaiian question
will go over to the new administration."
Mr. LIVINGSTON, Democrat, 'Georgia
"The President seems to think that the
Cuban frglit Is a 'dog-fall. I think that
he has made a full and unquestionable
showing Of the necessity for our inter
ference now. His osition on the Cuban
question will not meet with acceptance
by the administration people- It Is too
foreign and not enough American."
Mr. PAYNE, Republican, New York
"Whether the time has come for action
by'1 the United Suites in Cuba fs a diffi
cult question. I have no doubt that the
present contest will result fn a better
ment of conditions in Cuba." -
REPRESENTATIVE MORSE or Massa
chusetts "What; the President says or
the Turkish situation does credit to his
humanity. His denunciation or the treach
ery, weakness and imbecility of the Turk
ish government speaks the sentiment of the
country. What he say sabout the struggle
In Cuba and his intimations to Spain are
patriotic, humane and perhaps as far as
the country Is justified in going in the
present situation of affairs."
lilt DALZELL, Kcp., Pennsylvania -r
"The only two questions that the public
arc interested in are Cuba and the tariff.
I like best that reference to Cuba where
he shows a determination not to permit
any other power to interfere in the island's
affairs."
SENATOR VLLAS. of Wlsco:iUn-"It is
a conservative tjiessage. such.hK we had
a right to expect from Mr. Cleveland. On
the Cub.m question he went as fur as tlie
facts and existing conditions Justified him
iti going."
SPEAKER REED said: "It, seems hardly
necessary to comment upon the message.
It is calm in tone, and tJi the Cuban ques
tion will be much more satisfactory to
tlie community than it would have been
a year ago, as much sounder ideas pre
vail now than prevailed then,"
MR. M'MILLIN of Tennessee thinks we
can safely urge home rule or local self
government for Cuba. He is willing to go
even further.
MR. CANNON of Illinois: "I do not
know what the facts are touulunt: Cuba,
except as I gather them from the mes
sage. It seems to have nothing but guerilla
warfare in the island on the part of the
Cubans, and that there is no government
in fact to recognize. Prom a hasty reading
of'themessnge I do not? sec but that wis
dom dictates that Congress should await
executive action and recommendation as
to Cuba."
Senators were loth to discuss the mes
sage, and tliis reticence was especially
noticeableaniongniembersof the Committee
oii Foreign Relations. Of this committee,
Senators Sherman, Davis, Cameron, Lodge,
Gray, Turple, Daniel and Mills refused to
discussed the message in the most formal
way. Other Senators of prominence who
declined to talk were Aldrich, Vest, Faulk
"ner. Hill, Wolcott, Gorman and 3ones.
SENATOR .MORGAN of Alabama said
that in the recital of the facts and the
settlement or the moral duties or the
United States towards the belligerents
'there "was a response to the sentiment or
the people and of the Senate. The" asser
tion by the President that no other nation
Lsiimst interfere in Cuban affairs was, Sen
ator .Morgan said, the most decisive declar
ation of tlie Monroe doctrine that has yet
been made. Although the Spanish govern
ment wards off all other nations from
interfering, tlie message calls the great
civil war, now being fought with great
armies, an insurrection, and, on this false
dcclaiation it justifies active aid to Spain
in furnishing all kinds of military munitions
and refuses the right; to send anything to
tlie jnsurgents,. even bread or medicines.
SENATOR FRYE, of Maine "The mes
sage is commonplace. So far as the Cuban
question is concerned the President argues
on both gldeSJIif the subject."
SENAJIORJCULLOM, of Illinois, member
of the Committee on Foreign Relntions
"On the&uban.que&tion tlie President talks
all around the subject and takes no decided
stand. 'The -time has arrived when the
subject should be settled."
-"-SENATOR CHANDLER, of New Hamp
shire "Thfc message is strong on Cuba
and itself eatment; is adequate to a cer
tain point, but it "does not go as far as I
would wish. It. is' especially 'strong in
thafcpart where the declaration is made
that unless Spain "does "something shortly
theUnfted -States J will step in and help
Cuba.' -
OF THE MESSAGE
Treatment of Cuban Question
Pleases the Press.
MIGHT HAVE GONE FARTHER
London Papers Call Upon Spain to
Heed His Timely Warn-
in.
New York, Dec. 7. Commenting upon
President Cleveland's message to Congress
the principal metropolitan dailies will to
morrow say:
THE SUN ''The last annual message
which Mi. Cleveland will ever write as
President adds little to the public knowl
edge concerning any of the great questions
that affect this couniry in its exterior
relations or its domestic policy.
"The imminent and supremely important
question of our duty and responsibility to
Cuba is disposed of in a convenient man
ner. The Cuban chapter Is ably 'written
in a style differing conspicuously from the
opening and closing paragraphs or the mes
sage. Its statements and suggestions hold
tlie attention closely until ou come to the
disheartening conclusion. In well-balanced
periods sympathy for the struggling pat
riots' o i:d friendship and admiration for
Spain are equally dispensed.
"With thejiappy consciousness of having
unloaded everything, this wonderful states
man winds up his last message to Congress
with a beautirul tribute to himself, 'when
our differences are forgotten, and our
contests of political opinion are no longer
remembered, nothing in tlie retrospect of
our public service will he as fortunate
and comforting as the recollection of of
ficial duty well performed and the memory
or a constant devotion to the interests
or our con riding fellow-countrymen.
"His confiding fellow-countrymen will
not doubt that the final paragraph, at least,
is Mr. Cleveland's own. Only two men -who
ever lived could have written it, and Mr.
Pecksniff is dead."
THE T1MES--Hy far the most import
ant part of the President's message re
lates to the Cuban question, and the treat
ment of that is in ait respects worthy. Mr.
Cleveland makes a singularly clear state
ment of the present situation and of the
course of events that has produced it.
Boston, Dec. 7- The comments of Bos
ton papers upon the President's message
follow:
THE TRANSCRIPT, Republican "The
stiff dose administered to old Spain about
her bloody yet impotent rule in Cuba is
the great feature of Mr. Cleveland's last
message. Whatever other criticisms may
justly be passed on President Cleveland's
state papers, it cannot be said with truth
that he ever leave's his attitude toward
leading Issues in doubt.
" "The message which he sent to Congress
today Is no exception to the rule. It :.s a
remarkably plalnspoken document. Indeed,
without exactly iasslng- the limits of dip
lomatic courtesy In his treatment of the
Cuban question, he has certainly distin
guished it by an absence of that reserve
which has hithprto been deemed proper
in commenting on the affairs of other na
tions with which we are at peace."
THE GLOBEDemccrat "The last an
nual message in all probability which Grover
Cleveland will ever address to the Amer
ican Congress is thoroughly characteristic
of the man.
"On the whole the message Is in ac
cordance with general anticipation. It
docs nor go so far regarding Cuba as the
friends of the insurgents could wish, but
the warning to Spain will please and en
courage them."
Chicago, Dec. 7. The editors or the Chi
cago morning papers will comment on the
President's message as follows:
TIMES AND HERALD, Inu "Only the
most urgent friends of Cuba can complain
or the tone of that part of the President's
message devoted to the relations or the
United States with Spain. It lacks neither
boldness nor clearness, but It is apprecia
tive of the duty of this government to pre
serve its pledges and maintain the peace
and prosperity of its people."

Evening Times. Mr. Uefl Is the
president of the American Se

This act, or course, settles the question of
Mr. Woodward being chairman, the mere
announcement of which caused a revolt
among all theprominent Republicans of the
District, scores of whom gave voice totheir
disapproval on the morning following Col.
Parker's arrival in Washington from New
York and his giving his suggestion to
the press.
Col. Parker stated on the morning of his
arrival here that he had telegraphed- his
suggestion of Mr. Woodward to Mr. Oanna
at Cleveland, after he had seen persons
generally around town. He admitted that
there was a Kick. Hewiid that the answer
would go direct to Mr. Woodward-but when
Mr. Woodward was seen la the afternoon
he said that he had not received the ap
pointment, nor did hesay that he had pro
tested against being appointed.
Immediately upon the news of Mr. Wood
ward's suggestion as chairman, one of the
most prominent Republicansin Washington,
speaking Tor the old war horses, mailed a
letter to Mr. Uanna at Cleveland in which
he protested on his and their behnir against
the appointment or a Democrat to the
position.

The disappointment to Mr. WoMlward's
friends by reason of the delay or Mr.

keenly felt, and the Republicans aw tlie

when Mr. Hanna gave ous from Clevelnnd
