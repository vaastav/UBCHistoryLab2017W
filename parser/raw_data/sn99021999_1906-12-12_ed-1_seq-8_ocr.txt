NEW TORK. Dec. 11. The National
Leitgii of Bass Ball clubs tK-gan Ita annual
meeting at the Victoria hotel today. The
chief IntereM of the meeting centered In
the election of a president, although the
question waa not taken up today, rrssl
dent Harry C. Iulllam la a candidate for
re-election, but la being strongly opposed by
rival IntereMi, headed by John T. Brush
of the New York club and Oarry Hermann
of Cincinnati. James T. Hart, formerly
owner and president of the Chicago club,
waa also spoken of as a possible candidate.
The exchange of Rltchey, second base
man; Flaherty, pitcher, and one other
player of the I'lttaburg club for Ab
batlcchlo, second baseman of the Boston
club, was announced. . ...
Barney Dreyfus, president of the Pitts
burg club, anounced that Fred Clark would
again be manager of the Pittsburg club
next season. "He haa not yet signed a con
tract," said Dreyfus, "but I have hla as
aurance that he will."
President Fulllam read hla annual re
port and declared that financially the last
year waa the best that the National league
ever haa had.
The following resolution offered by
Charlea It. Ebhetta of Boston waa unani
mously adopted: "Resolved, that It Is the
unanimous vote of this league that Presi
dent Pulllam be most heartily commended
for his untiring efforts In enforcing proper
discipline upon the National league ball
field during 190ft."
WHTER DOPE OP A SIMMER GAME
Lively Doings I'nder the Snow la the
Bim I.engaes.
The New York Giants propose to tske
their spring practice In California, playing
with Intermediate cities on their way west.
Pa Rourke Is negotiating with Herr Me
Oraw for n game or two and probably will
be alii to give Omaha fans a rhance of
eolng the new Qlnnts, who, McQraw says,
will be the only real goods on the market.
Sneaking of the Olants bringa up the re
minder that this enterprising management
has recently offered Hio.000 for that ex
quisite pair of Uridegrooma, formerly
Paints (8t. Poul), Lumley and Jordan, but
Brooklyn la having trouble letting them
go not so much that It doesn't want the
money for the players, but that It wanta
the most It can get, and In view of cer
tain things which President Murphy 6f
Chicago has recently said, Brooklyn ap
pears to he playing the fast pony. Murphy
has offered to trade fiheckard and Ruel
back and $7,000 for Lumley, let alone Jor
dan. The other day Murphy told a magnate
well known In Omaha that he was going
to have two of the fastest and halrdest
hitting outfielders next year the diamond
affords, and the other day also Murphy
got on a train and started for New York.
On his departure he said:
"I am figuring on making the biggest
deal ever attempted In major league base
ball, but If I succeed It will be several
daya before I announce my achievement."
He was asked If he would land L,umley,
to which he replied:
"Manager Chance and I have determined
to exert every legitimate effort to
strengthen the Chicago Nationals. If 1
could land a couple of players I have In
m!nd. and could get them by exchanging
Chicago playera of almost equal strength,
with an additional bonus, $30,000 would not
be too much for me to give."
It la quite definitely understood that Chi
cago la anxious to supplant Sheckaxd. He
la a faat fielder and a timely hitter except
In world championship games but he la
sulky and hard to manage and then la not
the man at any stage of the game that
Lumley Is.
What disposition will be made of Hoff
man Is not certain. Many good judges of
ball players, notably your own Pa Rourke.
thinks Arthur Is fnr too valuable a man for
the outfield and not only may not be used
as a utility man, but possibly will be
brought from the out to the Infield. Hoff
man forever set at rest anv question of
, his prowess In those games with the White
Box. His rapidity Is excelled by few men
In the business, despite the fact he Is new
and but 22 years of age. Borne people
would not be greatly surprised to find
Huffman covering third Instead of Stein
fold t.
Pa Rourke. . recognised as one of the
ablest Judges of a ball player, ssys fur gv d
timber give him the lad (mm the farm or
country town In preference to him from
the big city.
"1 have found by experience," says Presi
dent Rourke, "thst the man from the
mall place has been a student of the game
from the time he began to play It. He
has more of Its fine points studied out than
the fellow from the big city, who spes a
food deal of his trickery from seeing the
Ig games play. And another thing, the
young follow from the country Is fnr more
conscientious In hla effort to make good
than his friend from the city. The city
fellow Is likely to be a hit swelled and
over-sure, while the lad from the brush
Is fearing he rslrht not make good and is
doing his best every minute. Comparisons
are Invidious; If they were not I could
rlnt out a few that would readily show
am right."
Eleven Reda are marked for the auction
block by the Cincinnati club. They are
Kelley, Corcornn, Wicker. Blegle, Dela.
hanty. Deal, Dyer, Livingston, Becker,
Fraser and Tlemeyer. The men will be
placed on the bargain counter by Presi
dent Herrlmann fn New York this week
and disposed off to the highest bidder.
"We have asked for waivers on these
Ing. "and I fee) quite sure that we will
men," said Preslden Herrmann this morn
dispose of them In some way or other
before the end ol next week."
FIFTY MILES BEMUD RECORD
Great Crowd Are Watching; Six-Day'
Bicycle Grind.
NEW YORK. Dec. 11. Thoumnds of per
sons were again drawn to Madison Square
Oarden todav and tonlirht to witness the
six-day blrvcle races, which began at mid
night Sunday. The most Interesting fea
tures of today's grind were the attempts
n the part of Walthour and his teammate,
Bod el of Long Island, to make up the deficit
of one lap, which they Incurred yesterday
when they doubled up as a reconstructed
team. They made frequent spurts ahead
of the bunch, but each time they failed to
make a gain. All the rldere are watching
this pair very closely and are on the con
stant alert lest Walthour or Bedel giln the
coveted lap. Walthour came very nearly
fooling the field late tonight, when he
gained almost a lap after a desperate
sprint, but there was a spill, and, although
he was not In It. under the rules he was
not allowed the advantage ho had gained.
Ten o'clock score: Eight hundred mid
seventy-four miles, one lap for all teams
except Walthour and Bedel, who are one
lan behind.
The record for forty-six hours Is Ktf miles,
four laps, made by Kike and MacFarland
In 1900. '
AMERICAN LKAGIE MEETS TODAY
Question of Shortening; Playing;
Benson Comes I p.
CHICAGO, Dec. 11. The question of
shortening the playing season from 154
gamea to 140 games will be the prlnclpul
subject that will come up for discussion at
the annual meeting of the American Base
Bell league, which will be held here to
morrow. Borne of the members of the
league are In favor .of shortening the play.
Ing season, but It was said tonight that
the majority of the owners oppose cjttlng
the schedule aa played last year.
The only other bustnese to be transacted,
so far as Is known tonight, will be the
election of a board of directors and a vice
president. President joiinSniv holda office
for a stipulated number of years, so the
question of the presidency will not come up.
When the meeting convenes In the morn
ing the first business to be considered will
be the awarding of last season's champion
ship pennant to the Chicago team.
The schedule question will then be con
sidered and it Is believed that by evening
all the business will be completed and
that a aecond session will not be necessary.
WITH THE BOWLERS.
The Btoni Blue Ribbons hung to their
lead In the league race by taking three
games from the Cudahys r.t the Associa
tion aJleys last night. The first two games
were easy, but the packers gave them a
scare In the last by getting a lead of slxtv
pins In the first half. They couldn't hold
the pace, however, and the Ptnn bovs are
still two gamea ahead of the Krugs. Fran
cisco pushed up his average with a total
of S0 and a single game of 265. Colonel
"Bill" Weber had one arm In a sling and

Bo Made Cltlsene of
lotted States,
WASHINGTON, Dec. ll.-The president's
message to congrees giving the result of
his recent observation In Porto Rico and
making recommendations concerning the
government of that Islund was read to the
senate today. The message wua as fol
lows: To the fVnate and House of Representa
tives: On November 21 1 visited the Island
of Porto Rico, landing at Pince, crossing
by the old B4inJMli road by l aycy to San
Juan, and returning next niiirnlna over the
new American ruud from Areclbo to ponce;
the scenery was wonderfully beautiful,
esjeclally among the mountains nf tin; in
terior, which constitute a veritable tropic
Switzerland. 1 could not embark at San
Juan because the harbor. hs nut been
dredged out and can not receive an Ameri
can battleship. 1 do not tl.inlt this tact
creditable to us as a nation, and 1 earnestly
ho;e that Immediate provision will be made
for dredKing S.m Juan harbor.
I doubt whether our peoole aa a whole
rcnllre the beauty and rer'tll'y of I'orto
Rico, and tho progress that has been made
under Its admirable government. We have
Just cause for pride In the character of
our representatives who have administered
the tropic Islands which came under our
flog as a result of the war with Bpain; and
of no one of them Is this more true than of
Porto Rico It would be Impossible to wish
a more faithful, a more eflicient and a more
disinterested public service than that now
being rendered In the Island of i'orio Rico
by those In control of the insular govern- 1
nicnt.
I stopped at a dor.en towns all told, and
ont of the notable features In every ton
was the gathering of the. school childien.
The work that hius been done In Porto Rico
for education has ben nnu-wm thy. The
main emphasis, as is eminently wise and
proper, has been put upon primary educa
tion; but In addition to this there Is a
normal school, an agricultural school, three
Industrial and three high schools. Every
effort Is belnK made to secure not only the
benefits of elementary education to all the
Porto Rlcans of the next generation, but
also as far as means will permit to train
them so that the InduwtrUI, agricultural
and commercial opportunities of the inland
can be utilized to the best possible advan
tage. It was evident at a glance that th"?
teachers, both Americans ai;d native Porto
Ricans. were devoted to their work, tcok
tho greatest pride In It and were endeavi r
Ing to train their pupPa, not only In m'nd,
hut In what counts for fnr more than mind
In citizenship, that Is, in character.
Native Troops Efficient.
I waa very much struck by the excellent
character both of the insular police and if
the 1'orto Rlcan regiment. They are both
of them bodies thrft rellcct credit upon tho
American administration of the Island. The
Insular police are under the local Porto
Rlcan government. The I'orio Rlcan regi
ment of troops must be appropriated for liy
the consress. 1 eartwstly hope that this
body will be kept permanent. There should
certainly be troops In the Island, and It is
wise that these troops should be themselves
native Porto Ricans. it would be from
every standpoint a mistake not to perpetu
ate this regiment.
In traversing the Island even the most
cursory survey leaves the Ix-holdcr sliuck
with the evident rapid growth In the cul
ture both of the suttar cane and tobacco.
The fruit Industry Is also growing. Last
year was the most prosperous year that the
Island has even known before or since the
American occupation. The total of exports
and Imports of the Island waa JIo.OOO.imi, aa
against S18,00o,Cuu in 1!1. This is the larg
est In the Island's history. Prior to the
American occupation the greatest trode for
any one year was that of 18, when It
reached nearly W.OfO.OOO. Last year, there
fore, there was double the trade that there
was In the most prosperous year under the
Spanish regime. There were 210.273 tons of
sugar exported last year, of the value of
Il4.l8ii.319; 3,565.1t)3 of tobacco and 2x,:9).:(.i
pounds of coffee of the value of $3.4K1,102.
L'nfortunately, what used to be Pcrto Rico s
prime crop coffee has not shared this
prosperity. It has never recovered from the
disaster of the hurricane, and moreover,
the benefit of throwing open our market It
It has not compensated for the loss lnlllcted
by the closing of the markets to It abroad.
I call your attention to the accompany'. .g
memorial on this subject of tho Board of
Trade of San Juan, and I earnestly hot
that some measure will be taken for the
benefit of the excellent and high grudj
Porto Rico cofTee.
In addition to delegations from the Board
of Trade and Chamber of Commerce of
San Juan, I also received delegations from
the Porto Rlcan Federation of Labor and
from the Coffee Growers' association.
Citizenship for Islanders.
There Is a matter to which I wish to call
your special attention, and that Is the de
sirability of conferring lull Ame:ic:tn c.ll
zenshlp upon the people of Porto Rico. 1
most earnestly hope that this will be done.
1 can not see how any harm can possluli
result from It, and It seems to me a mattii
of right and Justice to the peuple of Porto
Rico. They are loyal, they are glad to b
under our flag, they are making rapid prog
reus along the path of orderly liberty
Surely we should show our appreciation o
them, our pride In what they have done
and our pleasure In extending recugnitlo:
for what has thus been done, by grunting
them full American citizenship.
Under the wise admlnixtrnticn of the pre
ent governor and council, marked projres.
has been made In the difficult matter o!
granting to the people of the Island tin
largest measure of self-government that can
with safety be given at the present time. It
would have been a very serious mistake to
have gone any faster thun we have already
gone In this direction. The Porto Ricans
have complete and absc lute autonomy In
all their municipal governments, the only
power over them possessed by the Insuiar
government being that of removing corrupt
or Incompetent municipal officials. This
power has never be-n exereclsed s:;ve on
the clearest procf of corruption or of In
competency such as to jeoixtrdlze the Inter
ests of the people of the Island; and under
such circumstances It has been fearlessly
used to the Immense benefit of the ople.
It Is not a power with which It would be
sefe, for the sake of the Islund Itself, to
disiense at present. The lower hou.ie Is ab
solutely elective, while the upper houa; Is
appointive. Thla scheme is working well;
no Injustice of any kind results from it,
and great benefit to the Isl.ind, and It
should certainly not be changed at this
time.
Elections Are Fntr.
The machinery of the elections is admin
istered entirely by the Vorto Rlcan people
tlvemselves, the governor and council keep
ing only such supervision 11s Is neess.try in
order to Insure an oiderly elei tion- Any
prvlest as to electoral frauds is settled in
the courts. Here apaln It would not be
safe to make any change In the present sys
tem. The elections this year were abso
lutely orderly, iinacrompanli d by any dis
turbance; and no prousl has been made
against the management of the elections,
although three contests are threatened
where the niaJorltNs wete very small and
error was claimed; the contests, of c. un-e.
to be settled In the courts. In short, the
governor and council are co-operating with
all of the most enlightened and most patri
otic of the people of I'urto Rico In educat
ing the citizens of the Island In the pr.n
clples ot orderly liberty. They are pio
Vlding a government bused upon each cltl
sen's self-respect, and the mutual respect
of all citizens; that Is, based upon a ruid
observance of the principles of justice and
honesty.
Real Prowress Mnde.
It has not been easy to Instil Into the
minds of peoplo unaccustomed to the ex
ercise of freedom, the two batdc principles
of our Americun system; the principle that
the maturity mufct rule, and the pmneipl-'
that the minority has rights which- must
nut be disregarded or trampled up n. Vet
real prwgress has been made in having t!iec
principles accepred as elementary, as th
foundations of successful eelf-goveriinien! .
I transmit herewith the report of the
governor of Porto Rico, sent to the presi
dent through the secretary of state.
All the Insular governments should be
placed In one bureau, either In the Depart
ment of War or the Department of State.
It is a mistake not so to arrange our hand
ling of these Islands at Washington as to be
able to take advantage of the xprinc
gulred in one. when dealing with tiie prob
lems that from time to time arUe in
another.
In conclusion l"t me express my admira
tion for the work done by the congress
when It enacted the law under which the
Island Is now being administered. After
seeing the island personally, litul after five
years' experience in c nnectlon with Its sd
mlnlfttatlnn. It Is but fair to those who de
vised, this law to sav that It would be wel
nlKh lmposllle to have devised anv other
vhtrh In tli" actual woiklng would have
accomplished better rt suits.
