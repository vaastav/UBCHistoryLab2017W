These are the only measures that will
command the attention ol the senate the

orders being assigned to days of the
following week. The calendar Contains
290 bills and resolutions. There is a
proapeot of an early agreement by the
conieeres upon the inter-state ootnmeroe

tives daring the early part of tbe week.

Sv*Opposing an Assessment.
Cbiosgo, Deo. 6—Althoogb the speoial
assessment oalled for by Grand Master
Powderly in his reoent order is but
twenty-five oents per head, the oall has
not. been reoeived with very good grace
by the knights of labor io this oity and
vicinity. The »enent flasoo at tbe stock

many of tba leader*, as woll sn thf

wbioh wilt have to come iu greater part
from the looai assemblies, has re
sulted in the order being received with
some very vigorous kicking. In fact so
strong are tbe probabilities that many
members will deoline to pay up. that the
ruling spirits of several assemblies are
canvassing tbe idea of having a grand
ball at Battery D, the proceeds to be
devoted the assessment, Tbe total
amount Called tor from Chicago wilt
aggregate about $10,000, and it is
thought that if one-tbird or one-half of
this oan be realized from the ball, the
balance will be met with the assess
ments of the loyal members, while the
non-contents will be deprived of an
opportunity of preoipitating an open
rupture with the powers that be in the
order.
CONGRESS CONVENES.
Opening of the Closing Session—
J'oints in the 1'resldeni'a Message.
Washington, Deo, 0— Uongiess con
vened at noon to-day. After the open
ing oeremony the message of President
Cleveland was presented and read in
both booses. The message opens with
a usual surveyof forbign relations. Our
government, the president says, has con
sistently maintained its relations of
friendsbip towards all other powers, and
of neighborly interest towards those
whose possessions are contiguous to
our own. Few questions bave arisen
during the past year with other govern
ments, and none of these are beyou
tbe reaoh of a settlement in a friendly
oounoil. Tbe oruel treatment of inoffen
sive Chinese in the far west is
alluded to and in speaking
remedy he saya the paramount duty of
maintaining public order aud defend
ing the interests of our own people, may
require tbe adoption of a measure of
restriction, but they should not tolerate
oppression of individuals of a speoial
race. Discussing the fisheries question
whioh so long has been the subject of
auxioas differences between the United
States and Great Britain, the president
says the questions involved are of grave
'oonseqaence, and from time to time
for nearly three-quarters of a
oentury have given rise to
earnest international discussions.
Temporary arrangements by treaties
have served to allay the friation whioh,
however, has revived as eaoh treaty was
terminated. While the president de
sires that friendly relations should exist
between the people of the United States
end Canada, the action of the Canadian
officials during the past season toward
our fishermen has been snoh aa to
threaten their oontinoanoe and, al
though disappointed in his efforts to
seoure a satisfactory settlement of the
question, negotiations are still pending
with reasonable hope that before the
OIOBS of the present session of congress
the announcement may be made
that an aooeptable oonclusion
has been reaohed. The president
protests against the position assumed
by Mexioo in the Cutting oase and trusts
the Mexican statute under which the
claims of extra territorial oriminal
jurisdiction is made, will be soon modi
fied so as t,o eliminate tbe present
possibilities of daoger to the peaoe of
the countries. After tbe disoussion of
the treaties with Japan and other coun
tries, the consular service and extradi
tion mattors, the president disoassea the
tariff and to this he devotes a great deal
of spaoe, urging that the necessity for a
redaction of the tariff is more urgent
than ever.
A Murderess Convicted.
Des Moines, Deo. S—The local sensa
tion for the past week has been the trial
of May Foster for the murder of her
ohum, Jestie Carter, last spring. On the
18th of Maroh, the girl Jessie, was found
dying from the effects ot a bullet fired
some person unknown. When tbe
house was broken open shortly after
dinner the defendant, who was also the
companion in vioe, was discovered in an
exoited condition, looked in and utterly
unable or nnwitlipg to tell how tbe
shooting ooourred. Snspioiou rested up
on her, as it was known tbat she was jeal
ous of the other girl for having won
away a former paramour, who was about
to take the girl Carter to Sioux City.
She was arrested, charged with tbe mur
der, and has been in jail ever sinoe. At
this late hoar the defense raiBed the
theory tbat she had been chloroformed,
and was unoonsoions during the
This etrange eleotrio combination has
been operated in Paris, Vienna and
London, but has not been exhibited be
fore in this country. Mr. Juleene has
been many years in perfecting it. The
appearance of the theater with so many
instruments and contrivances bung in all
parts of It, is strongly suggestive of a
spiritual seance, and when the whole
scheme is in full operation, with birds
sibging, cannons booming, bells obimiog,
railway traius in motion, and balloons
anoending, it suggests visions ranging
from Forth of Julv to pandemonium.

ed that it had, and that the distillery
oould be closed by injunction the
same as any other institution that they
held was violating the law. Accordingly
a suit was brought by an agent of the
stute temperanoe alliance, asking that
the distiilery be enjojiietl iroin operat
ing. The arguments of counsel bave
been heard Judge Given, of the cir
cuit court, and a decision is autieipat.-d
this week. The muiu uiKnment of the
prosecution is to the t-tfeot that, the
state has supreme policu power and
acting under that power it can close a
distillery, even though manufacturing
for export, if it believes that snoh exer
cise of power is essential to the pnblio
good. The defense rely ohiefiy upon the
argument tbat the state has no power to
regulate interstate oommeroe, and that
the state oan no more prevent the ex
portation of aloobol to Illinois than it
oan tbe exportation of corn or hogs. It
is quietly whispered tbat tbe real movers
of this suit are the leading distillers in
the western pool. The International,
which is perhaps tbe seoond in size in
the United States, has refused to ent-r
the present pool and keeps on manufact
uring independently. The pool distill,
eries would be very glad to see it oloBed,
even if the result were brought about
throngh the agency of a temperance
alliance.
