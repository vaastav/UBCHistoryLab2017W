presented a resolution for tbe in vestiga
tion of the right of the Maeaaohneetts

Wnereae, The Constitution of tbe
State of Msssachuaette, in contraven?
tion of the provision of the Federal
Constitution, expresses special qualifica?
tions for suffrage by declaring tbat no
person shall have tbe rigbt to vote wbo
shall not be able to read tbe Constitu?
tion in tbe English language and write
bis name.
Resolv-d, Tbat wben the said select
committee shall be appointed it shall be
charged witb the further duty of in?
quiring and reporting, by bill or other?
wise, whether the representatives from
the State of Massachusetts are entitled
to membership in the House and
whether the number of representatives
from said State should not be reduoed.
Representative Crumpacker, of In?
diana, has introduced a bill for ao
amendment to tbe apportionment act,
so that the membership of the House ol
Repr?sentatives will be 872. The rep?
resentation is based on the vote cast in?
stead of population. It reduces the rep?
resentation in the southern States and
makes Increases in northern States.
But as stated in today's Gazette's Wash?
ington correspondence, it is probable
that tbe republicans will now go slow
in this matter as they may be handling
? boomerang.
The present Congress promises to
equal, if, indeed, it does not surpass, all
Its predecessors in tbe nnmber of
special pension bills. On tbe first day
of tbe session no less than 2,160 bills
granting pensions or increasing pen?
sions already granted were ottered in
the House. About one-third of the
bills proposed to "correo." the military
reoord of the person named. Tbat
means that tbe soldier named in tbe
bill was either a deserter or tbat there
is some other flaw in the man's record,
ae tbe result of which the Pension
Bureau bas refueed to issue a pension.
Tbe passage of the bill to wipe out tbis
stain is the preliminary step to placing
the man on tbe pension roll; it is in
elle.., therefore, a bill to give the man
a pension. Special bills to pension a
veteran are only passed by Congress
when tbe applloant has failed to meet
even tbe lax requirements of the Pen?
eion Bureau.

The reports of tbe isthmian canal
commission consist of four volumes, be?
?Idee a large number of platee, maps,
diagrams, etc. There la no minority
report, despite tbe publications to tbe
contrary. Tbe failure of the Panama
oanal company to make any definite
otter of the prioe at which it would sell
ita property to tbe United State?,
caused tbe members of the commission,
wbo had previously favored tbat route,
to abandon their position and sign tbe
majority report for the Nicaragua
canal. After the reports of tbe com?
missioners were completad President
Hutto, of tbe Panama Company filed
additional statements witb both tbe
State department and President Roose?
velt, arguing tbat It was unfair for tbe
commission to assume that tbe figures
named ($109,000,000) represented the
prioe at which be would sell bis oanal
to the United States and be merely in?
tended to indicate his belief that it was
worth that sum. Thia subeequent cor?
respondence has been sent by tbe
?Secretary of State to the Senate as
at separate document.
Chairman Payne of the Way? and
Means committee of the House today
tX=r.
submitted to the republican members
of tbe committee a draft of tbe pro?
posed Philippine tariff meaaure which,
In a general way, leaves the Dicgly tar?
iff ratee in force as againat goods com?
ing to thia country from the Philippines,
reenacta tbe Philippine Commission's
tariff act aa to goods entering tbe Phil?
ippines and allows a rebate on those
goods which bave paid a United States
internal revenue tax in the Philippines.
Tbe question upon which the re?
publican members are not yat agreed
is as to whether tbe proposed measure
?hall be considered as temporary or
permanent. The democrats will con?
fer tomorrow as to what stand
tbey shall take in the matter. There
was an evident determination at today's
meeting by some of the republican
members, to obtain reciprocal arrange?
ments between tbe United States and
tbe Philippines, by reducing the Ding
ley rates 15 or 20 per cent each way.
Business in the Senate this week will
be confined almost exclusively to the
consideration of the Hay-Pauncefote
treaty in executive session. The dis?
cussion on this subject will begin this
afternoon. It is expected that execu?
tive sessions will be held every day
until tbe treaty is disposed of. The
first speech on it will be delivered to?
morrow by Senator Lodge. Senators
Bacon, Money and Tillman will oppose
the treaty and will oiler amendments.
It is believed, however, that these will
be voted down and that eventually the
treaty will be ratified exactly aa it was
negotiated. Tbe House will not meet
until tomorrow and will probably ad?
journ over from tomorrow to Friday.
Society here is already on the qui
vive over tbe ball President Roosevelt
will give in honor of bis daughter, Miss
Alice, early in January. It will be tbe
most brilliant function that tbe White
House bas seen for many years and
tbere will be a great scramble for
card?. Tbe President's ball will be
really the opening of tbe social eeason
at tbe White House, though of course
a number of dances will be given by
Mrs. Roosevelt for the young people of
tbe official set. After Miss Alice is
formally presented to society a number
ol brilliant events will be given in her
honor. Among them should be men?
tioned that promised by Miss Keen,
slater of Benator Kean, wbo is a cousin
of tbe President by marriage; tbe
Bachelors' Cotillon, which will be led
by Miss Alice Roosevelt and Captain
McCauIey; a ball given by Mrs. Draper;
tbe German Ambassador's annual ball
which will have Miss Alice for its
central figure; and probably one given
by Senator Depew.
It is said here that efforts will be made
to get tbe democratic members of tbe
?ieiiate together in opposition to tbe
new canal treaty, and Benator Bailey,
of Texas, has announced bis opposition
to it, which he characterizes as a one?
sided bargain in favor of England.
Tbe Indiana judgeship fight was

Nominations were sent to tbe Senate
today by tbe President as follows; To

Maryland, to be commissioner of im?
migration at tbe port of Baltimore;
Washington Haveretick, of Wisconsin,
to be general inspector, Treasury de?
partment. Also a large number of post?
masters.
Nearly three hundred women witb
I bargain-bunting faces, also twenty five
or thirty men, gathered in an anotion
room near the Treasury department tbis
morning to bid for the miscellaneous
collection of lost articles tbat have ac?
cumulated in the Dead Letter Office
during tbe past year. There were 6249
articles to be disposed of. Tbe sale will
continue daily until the packages are
all disposed of.
The recent premature publication of
tbe Isthmian Canal Commission though
the treachery of an attaobe of the com?
mission, has been tbe means of Admiral
Dewey and his colleagues on tbe Schley
Court of Inquiry taking tbe most ex
tracrdinary precautions In the matter
of their verdict. Tbere will be no possi?
ble chance of the findings of the Court
becoming public before they are form?

Senator Galllnger, of New Hampshire,
has introduced a bill to prevent tbe
docking of horses' tails. If his measure
Becomes a law, all owners of docked
horses in tbe District most register

passage of tbe act. It sball be unlaw?
ful to bring a docked horse into the
District of Columbia after the measure

shall be liable for a fine ol from $100 to
1500 or a term of imprisonment of from
one month to three months, or both.
It l? now reportad that for the present no
action on tbe question of reducing Southern
representation will be taken by Oongreat.
Kepieseatativ? Crnmpacker. who ba? been
circulating a call for a republican canons to
consider tbe matter, has found many wbo
are opposed to taking np the question, and
who do not delire to be bound by caucut ac?
tion. It is certain that no caucus on tbis
question will be called until after the
holiday recee?. Many republican? believe,
with the late President McKinley, that
I' it would be unwise politically, to raise
tbe iaines which would be inevittbly
involved In the queetion of cutting

MARX IN BROOKLYN.
Herbert Marx, who shot and killed
William P. Taylor, jr., and William
Hetlin and seriously wounded Jsmas
Q. Btifi last Tuesday night at his farm
near Oak Orove, Westmoreland coun?
ty, reached his home in Brooklyo yes?
terday evening. He left Oak Grove
immediately after his exoneration by
tbe coroner's jury.
Abel Blackmar, ef the firm of Bald?
win A Blackmar, attorneys for Mr.
Marx, wbo went to Westmoreland
after the shooting, say that after bear?
lo? his story of tbe shooting it was
decided that it was best for him to go
to Washington and call on Repr?senta?
tive W. A. Jones, of bis home district,
aod give a full account of the case.
This be did, and put himself in the care
of Mr. Jones. Mr. Blackman further
says : "Ernest Marx and myself drove
to Oik Grove and called opon tbe
Commonwealth's Attorney, Col. Robert
J. Washington. After a conference
with Colonel Washington we decided
to inspect tbe premises wbere the
shooting occurred. We found that
Taylor evidently had fired two rifle
shots through the house. Oae of these
bad pierced tbe window of the back
room on the ground floor and the other
went through tbe second story.
"Wbeo tbe first shot was fired Her?
bert secured bis pistol, threw open the
door and confronted a man wearing a
ma-k. He called upon tbe man to
speak and say whether the affair waa a
Joke. Receiving no answer, he fired.
The man, who afterward proved to be
Btifi, fell on tbe porob. Stifi is said to
have stated that he was ehot by one of
bis own party, but Herbert says be
shot him.
. "Hetlin fell next. After his second
shot Herbert started across tbe front
yard toward a fence about 260 yards
away. After climbing the fence he
turned and saw another man carrying
a rifle. Herbert fired and this man al?
so fell. The third man afterward prov?
ed to be Taylor, wbo apparently bad
oroseed tbe yard and climbed the fence
on a parallel course with Marx.
'Herbert ran balf a mile tu tbe bouse
of Mr. ?iriffltb, the nearest neighbor.
Securing a lantern, a party hastened
back to tbe scene of tbe shooting and
found tbat Heflin and Still bad orawled
into the front room, where both lay on
tbe floor unconscious. One mysterious
feature of tbe affair was tbat tbe lamp,
wbicb had been burning io tbe back
room, bad been removed to the front
room. Taylor's body was not found un?
til an hour later.
"Upon searcning further about tbe
premises a bag of straw, a large bundle
of rags and a bottle of kerosene were
I mod, together with a large braided
whip. A quarter of a mile down tbe
road two buggies were found, in whhn
were a can of tar, a rope 2U feet long
and several rifle cartridges. A man
named Douglas was found in one of the
buggies. He ran away, and, together
with George Thompson, was caught
later. Both declared tbat they knew
nothing of tbe matter; both bad been
pressed into tbe affair upon tbe assur?
ance th it there was to be no shooting.
"An examination of Taylor's rifle
showed that the magazine coutained 18
undischarged cartridges. The ejector
of the rifle was down and a cartridge
was found jammed in the breech, pre?
venting further use of tbe weapon.
"Marx remained that night in tbe
bouse in the custody of Mr. Griffith,
who bad been deputized as special con?
stable. Next morning an inquest was
held over Taylor's body, Thompson
testified that he had understood the
party intended to chastise Marx. He
bad been picked up oo tbe road and be
knew nothing else about the oase.
Douglas told a similar story to tbe
jury, on whioh were two relatives of
one of the dead men. Colonel Wash
ioeton told Marx he could make a state?
ment to tbe jury if be desired, and Marx
did so. A verdict of justifiable shooting
was of once returned.
"Marx was advised to leave the
county. He wee taken to Leedstown,
on tbe Rappahannock, and boarded a
boat for Fredericksburg, where we met
him.
"On Monday night, the night preced?
ing the shooting, Marx believes, tbe
first attempt was made to enter the
bouse. He was awakened by an un?
known man rapping on one of tbe win?
dows. Marx opened the window and
the man asked for information as to tbe
road to Gak Grove, saying be was a
traveling salesman. When told how to
reach tbe place tbe man insisted on be?
ing shown. Marx refused to come out
of tbe bouse and a moment afterward
beard tbe man in conversation witb
another person. This put bim on bis
guard, and he is fully convinced tbat
tbe call on Tuesday night was made by
the same persons.
"Marx deeply deplores the publicity
given tbe young lady in tbe case, wbo
has since stated that he had never of?
fered ber an insult."
Still's condition is about the same,
although surgeoBs at tbe Emergency
Hospital in Washington say tbere Is a
obance for his life. Tne ball and pieces
of splintered bone, have been removed
but be is hopelessly paralyzed.
CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.
Tbe Constitutional Convention de?
voted its time oo Saturday to a discus?
sion of a resolution offered by Mr.
Queries providing tbat section 8 of tne
judiciary report, providing 24 court cir?
cuits, be recommitted.
Tbe feature of the day was a discus?
sion between Messrs. Queries and
Braxton over the question ?? retaining a
oity oourt in Staunton. Mr. Queries
said he did not think Staunton needed
a corporation court; tbat no busts???
man of Btaunton wnoted it, and tbe
c lurt was kept up to give the judge an
office. He declared that the committee
had forced a court oo Btaunton tbat tbe
people did not want. He tben
criticized the eighteenth circuit, com?
posed of Buckingham, Augusta and
Rockbridge counties, and contended
tbat no one judge could transact the
business of tbat circuit.
Mr. Quarles ineleted tbat what
Staunton and other cities of her sise
needed and wanted was a circuit court
which could transect all tbe business
ind would not require tbe cities to pay
the salaries. No vote was taken on the
Q'iarles resolution.
Mr. Thorn presented a petition from
tbe wholesale grocers and tobacco
dealers of Tidewater Virginia in favor
of the passage of tbe Wither? railroad
corporation commission.
Ibe convention adopted a resolution
providing for tbe appointment of a
committee to coniar with a committee
from the Legislature, touching the
early adjournmeot of the latter body
and its reassembling after the conven?
tion has finished its work. It ia under?
stood tbat tbe Legislature will take a
recess in about 10 days and tbat the
recess will extend to about Mirchio
order that tbe convention may bava
ample time within which to complete
its work.
TO-DAY'S TELEGRAPHIG NEWS
From Richmond.
Richmond, Deo. 9.?Th? Constitu?

ao'.ion was taken. Both branches of
tbe legislature will meet at 2:30 tbis
evening and tbe commltties will be

Tbe Ship Subsidy BUI.
Waabiogtoo, Dec. 9.?Senator Frye
today introduced tbe uew ship subsidy
bill. Io form it difiere radically from
tbe ship subsidy bill of tbe past two
sessions. It is mncb shorter aod
simpler, aod Is divided loto four title?,
15 sections, in all about 2,700 word?.
The Frye bill doe? not provide Ameri?
can registry for foreigo ships owoed by
Americans. It makes oo dlstiocliou
between fast and slow steamers, ex?
cept aa tbe former may obtain mail
contracts uoder Ibe act of 1891. It
contains oo specific requirements for
export cargo, on tbe grounds tbat it
would be a violation or attempted
evasion of our treaties, aod furtber it
is necessary because the subsidy is so
low tbat ample cargo must be carried
in order to escape loss. Under tbe bili
the postmaster general is reqaired to
consider the national defense aod tbe
maritime interests of tbe Uoited States,
as well aa postal interests, in provldiog
for tbe transportation of American
ocean mails. Tbe present limit of
ocean mail cootraota, ten years, is in?
creased to fifteen years. Tbe Frye
bill provides seven distioct classes ot
mail. The bill leaves mail by fast
vessels at the present rates and reduoes
mail pay for slower and smaller steam
era. The rates fixed by tbe bill are
maximum rate?. Mail contracta are
open to competition and will be award?
ed at rates as much below the maxi?
mum as will secure an American mall
? .rvice. Aoy vessel to receive tbe
general subsidy must carry mail?, it
required; mast train in sesmaosbtp or
engineering one American youth for
each 1,000 tons. Tbe owner must
agree to hold tbe vessel at tbe service
of tbe government, if required for de
feose. Aoy vessel to receive subsidy
must be class A-l, and at least ooe
fourth of the crew must be Americane.
Tne Boaine Trial.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 9.?The
question ot tbe defense put to Dr. Carr
which caused such a lengthy discussion
on Saturday was ruled upon by Justice
Anderson tbis morning before the jurv
came into court. Tbe question was:
"Wbat io your opinion, would be the
difference, If ar.y, in tbe height or di
rection of tbe wound, assuming thai
tbe body receiving tbe wound ie either
walking, standing or running."
Justice Anderson said tbat tbe ques
tion would only tend to baffle and em
barrase tbe jury and therefore ruled il
inadmissible Id tbat it did not contain all
of the elements essential to ao intelli?
gent reply. Counsel was permitted to
reframe tbe question aod tbe jury war
brought in. Dr. Carr resumed tbe
stand and Mr. Douglass asked bim: "Io
view of the iocatioo of tbe hip wound
will you state whether or not the loca?
tion of tbe wound could be influenced
in its beight or directed by the fact tbat
the deceased was eitber walking or
running?"
Tbe government made no objection
to tbis question aod tbe witoess replied
tbat it would not be materially inilu
eoced by the circumstances stated.
Tben followed an objection by tbe
government because tbe witness ad?
mitted that he based bis reply partly
on experiments, and tbe argument? for
and against were resumed. Dr. Carr
was allowed by tbe court to continue a
description of his experiments. Hie
evidence was a fiat contradiction of
every theory advanoed by the govern?
ment experts. Mrs. Booioe seemed to
take a great interest in the doctor'?
testimony.
From an authoritative source it was
learned this morning tbat, if tbe Bonioe
jury should disagree, the government
will quash the indiotment, thus pre?
cluding the possibility of another trial.

duced.
Benator MoLaurin io a speech pro?
tested against bis exclusion from tbe
councils of the democratic party and
proceeded to tell the history of his fight
?gainst tbe Tillman faotlon In his State.
He declared that it would not ooly re?
sult in depriving tbe State of South
Carolina of the services of one of its
Senators, but would deprive the party
of some advice that would be valuable
to it. He had been accused of having
bartered bis vote with President Mc?
Kinley for the federal patronage of his
State ami of having renewed his con?
tract with President Roosevelt. "Snob
a charge is infamous," he de?
clared. He also declared tbat be owed
? ? accounting to the people of his State,
Out he wished it understood that he
owed no accounting to the leader wbo
led the party to defeat more than once.
"I owe that man no accounting," be
shouted with an emphastlo gesture to?
ward Mr. Jones, of Aikansas, almost
directly behind whom Mr. McLaurin
was standing.
Mr. Jones said tbere bad been un?
warranted reflections upon bis attitude.
He bad not notified Mr. McLaurin tbat
be was no longer to be admitted to tbe
party caucus. Mr. Jones declared that
there had been no declaration of tbe
minority denying Mr. MoLaurin ad?
mission to tbe party caucus.
Mr, Tillman recounted tbe incidents
leading up to tbe resignations of him?
self and Mr. McLaurin with his
characteristic descriptive powers, and
? e held that as the trouble was a family
one, the people at home should be left
to adjust the differences as tbey deemed
fit.
Mr. Hoar, took the view tbat Inas?
much ss resignations bad been tender?
ed tbey could not be withdrawn.
Both Senators McLaurin and Tillman
announced their iotentioo tosend tbeir
r?signations to tbe presiding officer.
Beoator Hoar introduced a reeolution
directing the President to enter into
negotiations with foreign civilised
countries for the purpose of letting
