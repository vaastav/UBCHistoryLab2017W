A Glance Backward.
The btc elections li.ive called out
various opinions concerning the cause
of the Democratic success from politi
cal writers anil speakers, as well :.s
from various Liberal-Democratic-Republican-License
Law men, who
scarcely ever read or write, but arc
always speaking, and arc of late mo:e
than willing to charge corruption and
fraud on the Republican party, that
wo feel like giving them a ghnce nt
the other side of the picture, by call
ling their attention to the following
copied from an exchange :
We bear so much since the fall
elections of the return to power of the
old Democratic party that it may be
well to recall the fact that the last
heiid of the organization as a nation
al parly was during the administration
of IVesident Buchanan. On the lClh
of January, 18G1, Mr. Morris, a Dem
ocrat, spoke as follows of the last
Democratic Administration of which
we have any record :
'Tw years ago 1 propose i to
bring articles of impeachment against
the President; my own convictions
prompted me to do so, but I allowed
ityself to be persuadud to do other
wise. The fact, sir, is no
torious that corruption has been rank
in all the Executive Departments of
the Government, that they lay around
ns a mass of moral and political pu
trefaction, that from the highest to the
lowest they have plundered the public
coffers poisoned the channels of na
tional virtue, prostituted to unholy
purposes the highest obligations of
patriotism, tarnished the national
honor and destroyed the national
credit."
This is not a crayon sketch by r.n
opponent, but the honest utterance of
a Democrat who told the truth. W
are not aware that the Democratic
party has ever shown any signs ot re
form since the days of Buchanan.
The same old leaders arc now coming
to the front, and Fernando Wood will
be vindicated for all he has suffered
in the holy cause of Democracy.
Congress met on Monday, a goodly
number of members being present.
A few bills were introduced and
tabled to await the appointment of
committees. Very little has been
done, and it secins as though Con
gress is a little uncertain what is best
to do. The President's message oc
cupied the attention of Congress
awhile the first day. He advocates
an early return to specie payments,
and opposes inflation. The message
is rather more lengthy than usual,
treating on the various topics of the
day.
The New Hampshire Prohibitionists
met the 2d instant and nominated a
full State and Congressional ticket,
and instructed the State Central Com
mittee to call Councillor, Senatorial
and County Conventions. ISathunicl
White, of Concord, was nominated
for Governor, receiving 71 of the 90
votes cast, and David Ilcald of Mil
ford was nominated for Railroad Com
missioner. Rev. A. C. Hardy of
Portsmouth, Josiah M. Fletcher of
Nashua and Edward XI. Weston of
Whitcfiell were nominated for Con
gressmen in their respective districts.
William F. Ilavemycr, Mayor of
New York city, died very suddenly
of apoplexy while attending to the
duties of his office, on Monday last.
Mayor Iavcincycr was about 70 years
of age; was a straight forward,
honest man, and possessed the confi
dence of his people. He had been
thrice elected to the office of Mayor.
Notes from tlie Hub.
The following communication was
intended for last week's issue, but
failed to reach us in season. Ed.
Montpemer, Nov. 25, 1874.
The gavels of the presiding oflicrs
of the two Houses fell at precisely 8
this taioniing and thus ended tho
second biennial session of the Lcgis
lature of 1874. Its work is done
the future nlone can tell how well
the test will show how wisely, ami
what was left undone. The Hall
looks lonesome this forenoon although
the scrapers are busily engaged in
clearing up the "bits" and emptying
the desks of the departed, consisting
of large bundles of bills, cards, notic
es, in vitalions.tcports, advertisements,
etc., which the out goers considered
worthless. Many little round paper
balls, which wire quite forcibly pre
sented to the pates of some members,
especially those distitute of hair, dur
ing tho small hours of last night, for
Bomeof the members felt particularly
funny anil the more sedate would have
to "elongate" when I oholding some of
the antics of certain ones near the
lobby. The principal business of last
night's session was to clear the Speak
ers desk of bills reported adversely by
tlif various Committees, and also to
elect a Speaker to fill the vacancy oc
ensioned by the election of Mr. I'ow
cm lo no an Assistant Judge. At
eleven, P. M.,tho canvass commenced
oryutber tho voting. The leading
candidates were Mr. JommIi Grout, of
Newport, and Mr. Dana, of Cornwall,
j the contested ram, the luttor having
had a large field for observation at
Washington and o1im being strong in
body and voice, quick, u.l well
adapted to thg place, wasA trough;
ursied bv bis friends, but ihff way be
came killed him.
There were several olhcreandidates,
but on the fourth ballot Mr. Grout
was elected. Mr. Grout is not
strong but is clean and tlevcr, ami if
he had a stronger voice would servo
admirably. The Hall and the whole
Capitol was densely packed during
the evening, many members giving
their scats to the ladies. At midnight
a lunch was served in the General
Cwtntniltee room, to all the member?,
by the Scrgcant-at-Arms, after which
there wa3 a mock session of half an
hour. Wellls, of Granby, served as
Speaker, and filled the place most ad
mirably, as the frequent peals of
laughter would attest. Next was wit
nessed one of the most lovely acts of
of the session. The members had
thrown in tacit- mites and purchased
a silver service, which was brought in
while the speaker was at lunch. In a
shortjkiud'yjeiVijr speech, Mr. Mason,
of Manchester presented the service
to him in behalf of the members, Mr.
Powers in ti few loving and tsiidcr
words expressed his thanks for that
most tender rcgird and esteem that
was down deep in his heart for the
members of the Legislature of 1874.
And, now was the time to rush through
their little jobs, and although re
peated effors were made to reconsider
votes, and to work up some "partic
ularly necessary" cases, not one sue
cecded, for enough of ths stern good
sense of the House remained to snuff
out all jobbery at once. Very many
warm friendships were made here
which will continue through life.
There has been always good feeling
and good will among all the members
all most earnestly maintaining the
rights of each other, no malice in de
bate, no revenges, and very peculiarly
touching and kindly were all the good
byes and invitations to visit each
other. Observer.

Ministers' Wives.
Society is concrete intelligence, an
indefinite, aggregate humanity of
"large expectations." It expects the
"good time coining," progress in nil
that is good and great, and an unde
fined amount of servico from the
wives of the pastors of its churches ;
forgetting, meanwhile, that these
same ladies have a lively interest in
the good times coming and would like
to make a little progress on their own
hook. A pastor is hired lo preach to
a respectable church for from S300 to
$1,000 a year, depending on the
wealth of tho organization and the
expensiveness of living. This is
poor pay for well Iraiued and indus
trious brains, but it kccp3 body and
soul together, though the library
stands a poor chance for reinforce
ments, and the children for toggery.
This hires the pastor, but somehow
or other people have an idea that it
hires the pastoi's wife as well. From
the day she enters the parish she is a
marked woman. Her dress is expect
ed to be of tho most saintly pattern.
The color of a ribbon may endanger
the peace of a whole community and
the sporting of a feathar may call for
the sci vices of an Ecclesiastical
Council. She must bo 'the best wo
man in the world the head of all be
nevolent cnterprizes, Sunday schools,
ladies' fairs for procuring flannel
shirts for Hottentots, sewing circles,
Bible classes. She must be the polit
est person in the world, receiving calls
at all limo3 anil visiting from house
to house, and make herself generally
agreeable. She must be the most ex
emplary woman in the world, never
laughing above the prescribed key.
In short she must be tho paragon of
all excellence, and possess a constitu
tion like a horse, patience like an ox,
good nature like a puppy, to meet the
wishes of what Carlylc would prob
ably call the expectational epoch in
the Sublime Cosmos. And why?
Simply because her over-worked hus
band has consented to do a most im
portant, a most holy work, for under
pay. We appreciate fully the desir
ableness of having, in the w.fe of the
pastor, a pattern of feminine proprie
ties and Christian virtues, as much on
account of the pastor as tho people ;
but we protest against the too com
mon notion Mint the pastor's salary
makes tho wife a missionary, who is
to labor with equal assiduity nnd
earnestness for the good of the pn Ir
ish, nnd to "cotton" to tho caprices,
tastes and prejudices of the parish
without a farthing's consideration.
She has her household duties to per-
lorm, and we know not why more.
could be expected of heir than any
other Christian woman who has the
care of n family, nnd a toiling hus
band to look after, comfort and con
sole. Onservku.

Letter irca St Louie.
Sr. Loin, Mo., Nov. 30, 1874.
Dear IJeruLl:
This in the third Utter I have bi nn
to you. nnd l)o)e this time I shall:
finish it. IOng ago, to have sent you
on account of the city nnd its inter
resting points would have been far
easier than now not that there was
more to tell every day one sees more
to tell, but in time it grows common
place, and while a stranger sees
enough '.hit interests him and of
course would Interest friends he is
writing to; but the best worth
mentioning, soonest is an every day
matter, end he thinks it not worth
mentioning.
The approach of winter makes one
wish for the land of pleasant homes,
for such New England emphatically
is. It is true we have lo work harder,
longer days and more days' work for
a plainer living than do many in
warmer tlimer, and many luxuries
others have we do not get; but best
of all is the lovo of home, friendship
of neighbors and the long winter
evenings of comiort that we have.
This i3 not my opinion alone. It
was most strongly dwelt upon by a
native of the West who once spent a
winter m Essex county, that never
did she see so much solid comfort
taken by people anywhere as amid
our deep snow drifts. Whether it is
that man enjoys best what costs him
most, ami our home comforts cost us
more work, or that we find less to en
joy away from home, or from some
other cause, I cannot say. But in
New England and among New Eng
land pnople everywhere I have found
the happiest homes I have ever seen.
Thanksgiving day, especially our fes-
tivnl ia ohanrvpil hero T Uml ,w,
llai, IS OU8ClLU UCIC US 1 Hail HO
idea till I saw it. Stores and busi
ness places are almost uuiversally
closed, and everyone looks to the day
for enjoyment aid a big dinner. But
to many of tho residents of a great
city it is a far different day from that
at home where families and friends
arc reunited, A great pait of the
young men have no real home to go to.
Many board in a greater or smaller
sort of human stable, where lliey are
kept for the money and givpn so much
care and attention as that money will
command. Others a class perhaps
not smaller hire a room somewhere,
the rent including furniture and care
of the room. There they sleep ami
pei haps spend more or less of their
spare hours as they feel inclined.
Then for meals they go to some board-
uig-houvc, restaurant, or hotel, cat
what is set before them, or if at a
restaurant, what they call for, asking
no questions for conscience' sake.
When this is the way that a large por
tion of young men hcie live, by far
the larger portion, if we exclude those
brought up here and still at home, is
it any wonder that hoffle tastes, love
for a pleasant, quiet place to spend
their evenings, love for improving
and good society, in fact, in a home,
is it strange that nnrr'iRse is froin";
out of fashion and crime, or at least.
viciou3 ways, common ? More and
more I see why the city is the abode
of evil and those brought up in it so
often take their place in the lowest
classes it contains. Were all replen
ishment from the country cut off, our
cities, instead of growing at a rapid
rate, might even fail to maintain their
present size, and honor and honesty
would be even more strangers here
than now. I do not of course- mean
that no children grow up in cities, or
growing up never take honorable po
: sitions ; but that the place is not
favorable to their growth in numbers
propoitional to the people as in the
country, nor to cultivation of the best
traits of character; at least, so it
seems to one not accustomed to the
sights, scenes and roitow here.
