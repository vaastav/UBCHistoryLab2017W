Q. I. STAPLES, THOS. H. PROWSE
Business Manager. Editor.
All that is necessary, according to
a Minneapolis evening paper, to get
into the Roosevelt class is to go out
and kill a bear.
An exchange advises us to put our
savings into diamonds. That's just
where they go at this time of the year
into black diamonds.
The reformists in Minneapolis who
closed the saloons now insist that the
street cars shall be openedthat the
gates shall be removed therefrom.
Bull fights, bare-knuckle fights,
Lancashire wrestling, badger baiting
or sandbagging are harmless amuse
ments compared with the American
game of football.
The woman who spouts at the
mothers' meeting upon "The Prepar
ation of Nutritious Food for Baby"
ofttimes leaves a child at home to
lunch upon a rubber ring.
The colon bacillus (typhoid germ)
has again attacked the water drinkers
of Minneapolis. This is not nearly
so dangerous, however, as the hyphen
bacillus which attacks a man when he
runs for office as a mere American
citizen.
The Minneapolis city ordinance
prohibiting the sale of milk from un
inspected cows is being rigidly en
forced, and farmers shipping milk or
cream to that point must either have
their cattle tested by a competent vet
erinax'ian or discontinue such ship
ments.
The governor's Minneapolis organ
says that he will speak at a Swedish
memorial function in Philadelphia
next March. Ignorance of the tongue
which it will be necessary to use upon
that occasion will preclude the possi
bility of the governor substituting his
man FridaySamuel Van Sant.
For more than thirty years Mr. N.
E. Jesmer has justly been regarded
as one of Princeton's most public
spirited, progressive and successful
business men, and the announcement
that he contemplates retiring from
active mercantile pursuits in the near
future, with the intention of removing
to the Pacific slope, will be received
with feeLngs of general and sincere
regret
The supreme court $f the United
States has decided that vaccination
can be made compulsory by local or
state boards of health, contending that
the people have a right to insist that
they be protected from the ravages of
smallpox by the enforcement of this
preventive method. So, whether you
believe vaccination or not. vou
can be legally compelled to submit to
the operation.
S. G. Smith, who in the inter
est of the municipal reform movement,
opened a discussion of "The Model
City" the People's church, St.
Paul, on Sundaj evening, invited
Governor Johnson's boss to tell the
audience what he knew about St. Paul
and its relation to a city of the kind
at issue. Mr. O'Connor respectfully
declined the invitation. The reason
for such declination is obvious.
The annual message of President
Roosevelt was read to the senate and
house on Tuesday. The document is
too voluminous for a reproduction
and a review, to do it justice, could
scarcely be boiled down to less than
half a page. The message is emin
ently a masterpiece, covering all the
important issues which will come be
fore congress, and suggesting philoso
phic remedies for existing evils.
An exchange insinuates that the
gam?-protectio hirelings kept a
goodly supply of frozen deer and
moose carcasses on hand in the north
ern woods during the hunting season
for the accommodation of hunters who
could not shoot straight. We shall
not attempt to disprove this accu
sation, for we are personally ac
quainted with many a man who
brought home the legal quota of game
who could not hit a hippopotamus at
a five-yard range.
KEEP EVEUJLASTINGZY AT IT.
When contemplating advertising first
select a recognized result-producing
newspaper. A paperbf this jport must
necessarily be one with a wide circu
lation. An honest publisher will
readily produce for your inspection
his subscription list to prove the cir
culation of his paper whensoever you
desire. Your paperor papers
selected, ins'ert an attractive ad,
change it occasionally, increase or
decrease its space from time to time
according to ydur judgment and the
requirements of your business. But
keep it agoing. Don't insert an ad
one week and jerk it out the next be
cause the results do not seemingly
compensate you for the outlay. The
compensation will come presently, and
faster and faster the longer you ad
vertise. John Wanaker, who spends
hundreds of thousands of dollars an
nually in advertising, and whose vast
fortune has been made by a judicious
use of the newspapers and magazines,
says upon this subject of keeping
everlastingly at it:
"If there is one enterprise on earth
that a 'quitter' should leave entirely
alone it is advertising. To make a
success of advertising one must be
prepared to stick to it like a barnacle
on a boat's bottom. He should know
before he begins it that he must spend
money. Somebody must tell him,
also, that he cannot reap results com
mensurate with his expenditure early
in the game.
"Advertisipg doesn't jerk, it pulls.
It begins very^ gentle at first, but the
pull is" steady. It increases day by
day and year by year until it exerts
an irresistible power.''
Henry Rollette, who has recently
been fired from the humble position
of janitor at the state capitol, attrib
utes such discharge to animosity
nurtured by the crowd of St. Peter
papsuckers toward his father. Henry's
father was the man who once upon a
time made oft with a bill which would
have made possible the removal of
the state capital from St. Paul to St.
Peter. A more ignominious proceed
ing than the ousting of Mr. Rollette,
if for the purpose which he assigns,
can scarcely be conjectured.
Unless the Equitable insurance
company of the United States in
creases its premium reserves invested
in Germany, as required by the law
of 1901, the imperial government pro
poses to appropriate the buildings of
the association in Berlin and other
cities and sell them for the benefit of
the policyholders. The fellows who
are investigating and tinkering the
irregularities of this association in
America could probably learn a les
son in activity from our German
friends.
The brutality which has attended
the disgraceful exhibitions known as
football games during the season just
closed has decided the faculties of
many colleges to put forth an effort to
bring about the abolishment of the
game. Many lives have been sacri
ficed and scores of men permanently
crippled from participation in these
diabolical contests of toughness.
Either let the rules governing the
game be materially modified or the
game be abolished.
Capt. Frantz, who served in the
Rough Rider regiment with President
Roosevelt and who knocked him out
in a friendly boxing contest at the
White House gymnasium, has been
selected to succeed Mr. Ferguson as
governor of Oklahoma. The boxing
bout was probably a sort of civil ser
vice examination introduced by the
president to determine whether the
captain was capable of holding his
own in the land of cowpunchers and
bad men.
The first session of the fifty-ninth
congress convened at noon on Mon
day, and this congress promises to be
the most important of President
Roosevelt's administration. Among
the foremost questions which will be
presented for disposition are those of
railroad rates, insurance, statehood,
the federal deficit, the Reed Smoot
case, the Santo Domingo situation,
the Panama canal issue and the mat
ter of our trade with Germany.
Have you thought of getting your
congressional seed tested by the pure

,^^,r^TUE PRINCETON TJfflON: TfatJBSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1905.
Dr. Benjamin Andrews, whoever he
may be, advocates the turning over
of murderers condemned to death to
the medical fraternity for the pur
pose of experimenting upon them with
"new theories," and, should they sur
vive, to give them their liberty. We
object to this upon the grounds that
it would be extending to murderers
the same treatment as that accorded
to regular patients.
Over in Hesse-Darmstadt a judge
fined a lawyer $10 for looking at him

ranges with his honor to buy the toddy
after court adjourns.
It has been asked how a congress
man with no other income than his
$5,000 a year salary can pay $10,000
a year for the living expenses of his
family. Made easy by "the Greeks
bearing gifts," perhaps.
OPINIONS OF EDITORS 1
Inconsistency of Mankind.
One of the evangelists recently en
gaged in playing his line in Minne
apolis received $1,200 for two week's
work besides all his expenses, includ
ing board and lodging at the West
,hotel. Many a worthy country
preaeher labors for a whole year in
an humble, meek and Christ-like way
for a third of this sum. The way of
modern religionists is to give the
cream to the brass band, circus mak
ing, satanized fakir and to permit
the man who teaches and preaches
the word and works of God to live on
crumbs and water.Le Sueur News.
Doubling the Demand.
By advertising her public lands
Minnesota has secured $15 an acre for
ground appraised at $6 and $8. This
does not mean that buyers have paid
double the value of the land to foot
the advertising bills. It means a
doubling of the demand for farms and
a consequent increase of their actual
worth. There are other things than
public land the value of which may be
materially enhanced by stimulating
demand through adequate publicity.

An Explanation That Does IS ot E-vplaiu.
Private Secretary Day tries to ex
plain why the jobbers of St. Paul and
Minneapolis should have their assess
ments reduced some $2,000,000. He
does not however deny the fact that
though these cities have been un
usually prosperous and have grown
rapidly the past year that their as
sessments were so lowered. Day
says Governor Johnson had nothing
to do with this, but if that were true
his private secretary would hardly be
so lengthy in his excuses and explan
ations.Fairmont Independent.

CRAWFORD HANGS.
Cold-Blooded Murderer of Heine Landcen
Pays the Penalty
C. D. Crawford, the murderer of
Heine Lundeen, was hanged at Elk
River on Tuesday morning, and wasJ
pronounced dead by the physicians
thirteen and one-half minutes after the
drop.
Sheriff Ward proceeded in the exe
cution in strict accordance with law
notwithstanding reports published in
a certain daily paper to the contrary.
"Good-by boys I am sorry for this
action of mine."
These were the last words spoken by
C. D. Crawford, the murderer of Heine
Lundeen. A moment later the trap
was sprung and his motionless body
was dangling from the end of the rope
beneath the scaffold.
Calm to the last, Crawford walked
up the steps of the gallows without
assistance. He surveyed the persons
present without a sign of tremor, and
in the three minutes' work of adjust
ing the noose he stood before the
priest reciting prayers. When the last
moment had come he made his brief
farewell.
The trap was sprung at 1:48. Four
teen minutes later the dead body was
cut down and carried into the jail.
The last scenes at the jail were
marked by the first sign of a break
down by the prisoner. He was told
of the woman in Minneapolis who, the
officials firmly believe, is his mother.
Then Crawford cried. His long-re
strained feelings gave way to bitter
tears. Later he recovered his spirits
and talked with the sheriff.
The prisoner arrived at Elk River
with his guard about 6 o'clock on
Monday evening, driving to the jail
in a closed carriage. Father Goebel
of St. Cloud remained with Crawford
till 8 o'clock and returned again at
midnight. After his display of grief
Crawford became almost jovial, and
when the death march began, at 1:42
o'clock, he appeared to be glad.
Sheriff Ward and Father Goebel
walked beside him to the scaffold,
where the sheriff quickly performed
his task. Crawford appeared to be
the least affected of anyone.
By the request of the condemned
man, his attorney, E. S. Cary. did
not witness the execution. When
those persons authorized by the sheriff
were in the inelosure the entrance was
closed and a deputy sheriff remained
on guard. Quite a crowd collected
outside, and after the body had been
removed, many were admitted to see
the scaffold.
Father Goebel took charge of the
remains and the burial took place at
Elk River.
A Talented Pianist.
Miss Hazel Cathcart of Virginia
passed the Thanksgiving vacation
here with her parents, Rev. and Mrs.
E. M. Cathcart at the Methodist par
sonage.
During Miss Cathcart's stay two
parties were given in her honor, one
at the residence of A. W. Woodcock
and the other at the parsonage.
On Sunday this estimable young
lady presided at the piano in the
Methodist church and demonstrated
by her performance that she is a
musician of exceptional talent, both
execution and expression being par
ticularly fine. Her solo, "Jesus,
Lover of My Soul," was so impres
sively rendered at the morning service
that she was requested by many of
the congregation to favor them with a
reproduction of the same melody in
the evening. This request she re
sponded to. The variations in this
masterpiece were composed by Miss
Cathcart.
Miss Cathcart is a music instructor
in Virginia, Minn., where she has a
large class, but she would rather re
side in Princeton^ with her parents,
and could she secure a number of
pupils at this place would locate here.
Strait round Guilty.
A case which has attracted consid
erable attention is that of H. Burton
Strait of Shakopee, indicted for re
ceiving money, Oct. 31, 1903, in the
insolvent Scott County Bank. Strait
was found guilty at Glencoe as
charged by the jury which went out at
4 o'clock Saturday afternoon and
brought in the verdict on Sunday
morning. A stay of proceedings was
granted to Jan. 23.
The case was tried before Judge
Morrison and conducted by F. J.
Leonard, county attorney of Scott
county F. C. Irwin ^nel C. S. Jelley
of the attorney general's office for the
state, and Frank M. Nye and W. C.
O'Dell for the defense.
