PRESIDENT ASKS FOR 1
WAR ON AUSTRIA!
President Wilsonv in Ringing War!
Message to Congress, Asks Immediate
Declaration of War j
On Austria.
Washington, Dec. 4.?The text of 4
President Wilson's war message to
Congi ess, asking that body to immediately
declare war against Aus- 1
tria-Hungary, follows in full: | *
"ENnrhf months have elapsed since j
I last had the honor of addressing
you. They have been months crowd- ^
ed with events of immense and c
grave significance for us. I shall
not undertake to detail or even summarize
those events. The practical *
particulars of the part we have ?
played in them will be laid before
you in the reports of tha executive
T
departments.
"I shall discuss only our outlook .
tipon these vast affairs, our present 1
duties, and the immediate means of
accomplishing the objects we shall j
hold always in view. <
"I shall not go back to debate the
causes of the war. The intolerable J ^
wrongs done and planned against ^
us by the sinister masters of Ger-1
many have long since become too c
Ame>r- I _
grossly .uuviuua w uih, x
ican to need to be rehearsed. ' s
"But I shall ask you to consider j v
again with a very grave scrutiny (
our objectives and the measures by J
which we mean to attain them; for
the purpose of discussion here in'
this place is action, and our action
must move straight towards defin- JI
ite ends. Our object is, of course,1'
to win the war; and we shall not|t
slacken or suffer ourselves to be J ?
diverted until it is won. ' 5
When Shall We Consider War Won?! \
"But it is worth while asking and! 1
answering the question, when shall j 1
we consider the war won? ' i
"From one point of view, it is not i
necessary to broach this fundamen- 1
tal matter. I do not doubt that I
the American people know what the,
J ? 4. ??|4
war is about ana wnai sun. an i
outcome they will regard as a reali- r
zation of their purpose in it. .As a i
nation we are united in spirit and i
intention. I pay little heed to those t
who tell me otherwise. I hear the t
voices of dissent?who does not? I i
hear the criticism and the clamor of f
the noisily, thoughtless and trouble- i
some. I also see men here and there j
flying themselves in impotent dis- t
loyalty against the calm, indomit- j
able power of the nation. I hear a
men debate peace who understand j
neither its nature nor the way in ?
which we may attain it with up- f
lifted eyes and unbroken spirita. t
"Bat 1 Know tnat none 01 mese v
speak for the nation. They do not t
touch the heart of anything. They s
may safely be left to strut their un- ^
easy hour and be forgotten. j
"But from another point of view 1
I believe that it is necessary to say ?
plainly what we here at the seat of
action consider the war to be for ?
and what part we mean to play in I
the settlement of its searching is- e
sues. We are the spokesmen of the v
American people and they have a r
right to know whether their pur- ^
pose is ours. They desire peace by I
the overcoming of evil, by the de- I
feat once for all of the sinister b
forces that interrupt peace and ren- 1

know how closely our thought runs t
with theirs and what action we pro- c
pose. They are impatient with
those who desire peace by any sort t
of compromise?deeply and indig- c
nantly impatient?but they will be
equally impatient with us if we do 3

;o learn that he has been elected as

Society of Harvard University,

?appa Society was founded at Wiliam

s the oldest Greek letter society in
America. It has chapters in the
eading universities, the chapter at
harvard being Chapter Alpha.
The society endeavors to gather
he leaders in scholastic attain
nent from each class, and also to
aise the intellectual tone of the
mder-graduate body. Not more
han forty men may be chosen to
his society from each class. In the
'all of each year, the college ofice
sends to the active society, that
s, to the eight seniors elected the
rear previous, the names of the
;welve highest Juniors and of the
'orty-four highest Seniors, exclu(ive
of those already members,
"rom these names eight Juniors
ind twentv-two seniors are chosen

his number having the requisite

Abbeville, S. C., and Rudolph E.

The honor which young Mr.

While for the moment there are
no infantry operations of great
! magnitde in progress on any of the
numerous battle fronts, indications
are not wanting that shortly the
Cambrai sector in France and the
northern line in the Iitalian theatre (
' will again witness titanic struggles, .
' with the Germans and the Austro- .
! Hungarians the aggressors. .
1 Already the Germans in the Cambrai
region have brought up reinforcements
with the object of blotI
ting out the salient driven into their
II line bv Gen. Bvne's dash, a small
portion of which they have reconquered,
but at a fearful price. In

j all calibres have opened fire on the <

IN THE HOUSE FRIDAY
Jj
Congress Clears Deck for Immediate
Action Against Austrians?Joint
Resolution by Pres. and Stat*
Department Approved.
Washington, Dec. 6.?Congress
cleared the way today for prompt
respnose to President Wilson's call
for a declaration of war with Austria-Hungary.
A joint resolution approved by
the President and the State department
declaring existence of a state
of war between the United States
and the Imperial and Royal AustroHungarian
Government from today
at noon was introduced in the house
and unanimously approved by the
house foreign affairs committee. It
will be reported tomorrow for house
debate Friday, with final action in
the senate late this week or early . v 'J
[1CAI W ccn pvuu KTAJ
v
Conforming to the President's recommendations
the resolution which
authorizes and directs employment
of the Nation's armed forces against
Austria and pledges the country's
resources to victory, applies to Aasr
tria alone. Germany's other allies,
Turkey and Bulgaria, are not mentioned.
As perfected by the house committee
and ordered reported without
a dissenting vote, the resoln- . :j
tion reads as follows:
i
"Whereas, the Imperial and Royal
Austro-Hungarian Government * 7
has severed diplomatic relations
ft
with the government of the United y
States of America, and has commit 5#
ted acts of war against the government
and the people of the United
States of America, among which are . ;
its adherence to the policy of ruthless
submarine warfare adopted by
its ally, the Imeprial German Gov
ernment witti wnicn me umieu
States of America is at war and by
giving to its ally active support and
aid on both land and sea in the
prosecution of war against the government
and people of the United
States of America, Therefore: be it
"Resolved, By the senate and the
house of representatives of the
United States of America in Congress
assembled, That a state of war
be and is hereby declared to exist
and to have existed since noon of
the 5th day of December, 1917, between
the United States of America
>"<1 the Tmn?rial and Roval Aufitro
Hungarian government; And that
the President be, and he is hereby,
authorized and directed to employ
the entire naval and military forces
)f the United. States and the resources
of the government to carry
>n war against the Imperial and
Royal-Auetro- Hungarian governnent,
and'to bring the conflict to a
iuccessful determination all the reiources
of the country are. hereby
pledged by the Congress of the
Jnited States."
Although sentiment remain strong
n both branches to have the war
laniafa+inn cvffnHpH tn Turkev and
Bulgaria, approval of the resolution
is it stands is regarded as virtually
:ertain. Reasons given confidently
oday to Chairman Stone and Flood
ind which probably will be made
)ublic in debate, were regarded as
:onvincing. Senator Stone and Representative
Flood both conferred
vith Secretary Lansing and it was
inderstood to be the secretary's co*
fiction that no circumstance yet
vas warranting action against Turkey
and Bulgaria.
