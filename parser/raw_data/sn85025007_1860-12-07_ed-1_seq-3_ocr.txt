Union or Disunion *
Where now are the constitutional lawyers
which Virginia formerly produced in such
abundance, to decide the great question
rioted between the north and South; and
vherc the patriots, once her peculiar pride,
with willing hearts and ready hands t<> en
fores such decision by noble deeds ? Alas!
tbe wretched men whom party politics has
raised to power in Virginia, stand aghast tt
'the ruin they have wrought; and unless the
present convulsion shall throw to the sur
face, a different order of meu - capable of
rising above mere personal ur party inter
e5ts?wiietiier in or our of the Union?a
melancholy future lies before us.
If the tiiteen Southern States present a
iiisss Mifiicientiy homogenious in Interests
ami prejudices to form a solid confederacy,
the present seems to be a favorable time for j
trying the experiment. If the causes which \
|,:tve now brought us to the brink of disrup- !
tiuc, continue 10 operate, disunion becomes j
merely a question of time. When a lar^e
nation is already broken into two hostile
sections, by an irrecouciieahle diversity of
sentiment, in regard to an institution which
has n ? existence in the stronger, but is con
futed exclusively to the limits and jurisdic- i
tion of the weaker section: and when, not
withstanding this, the stronger continue to
urge their sentiment, in stich manner as ex
poses to incessant peril the lives and pro
perty of the weaker section?surely the
(so'uidest statesmanship, the coolest reason,
must agree that the time for separation has
come. it must be extremely hazardous to
intermingle under the same general gov
ernment, two sections thus morally separa
ted; for whenever there is a point of con
tact, there will be danger of a hostile colli
810X1.
Such is the meddling, obtrusive, patroniz
ing policy the Northern people towards
us?they have alucost entirely ignored their j
own affair?, and devoted themselves exclu- j
sivelv to ours. They import from the j
South the issues which control even their
State uud County elections. They are not
so much concerned to know whether a can
didate's views are sound on their own atlairs,
as whether he entertains what they, in their
assumed moral superiority, conceive to be
proper views upon ours, in regard to which j
neither candidates nor people are called j
tmon to entertain any opinion at all. Until
at last the demagogue?, after first manufac
turing, and then stimulating and pandering
to this gratuitous, meddling, morbid, senti
ment, have succeeded in raising to the Presi
dency, h man who owes his elevation entire
ly to the fact, that he entertains or pretends
to entertain this pernicious sentiment, which
has already proved, so destructive to our
lives and property, and which, under the
patronage of our government, (if we ac
knowledge it) will be much more so.
It is probable, that the more able and en
terprising Republicans have, without hon
estly entertaining it, merely availed them
selves of this sentiment, to defeat the Dem
ocrats and get into oflice; but it is d*tiicult to
see how" they are to hold their position,
without invoking the same humbug by
which they have won it. And although
they would" no doubt, seeing the danger of a
division of the Union, (which would also be
a division of the spoils,) make any verbal
concessions to the South, to avert such an
awkward event; when that danger had past
away, the}' would with equal probability,
falsify them by their acts. And we should
not forget, that this sentiment, though it is
entertained by a people, in regard to an in
stitution which has no existence in their
Yuiv.ts, is nevertheless the most inexorable
that ever stultified the mind, or petrified the
/isxtrt of man. Although i: has been de
monstrated. by actual examples, in the face
of the whole world, that assassination and
murder arc its real effects, still these people
refuse to relinquish this strange delusiou :
indeed, it has grown and strengthened,
widened, and deepened, in the face of ef
fects, that would have compromised the ho
liest sentiment for which a positive warrant
can be found in the very word of God him
self. This proves it to be "earthly, sensual,
and devilish," in its nature, origin, pro
gress, and probable results.
And 'now when we would escape from
these evil* so palpable and so imminent, we
are told by the Republicans on the one
hand, that "we will be met and driven back
hy the bayonets of our tormentors, and on
the other/by able and true men at the South;
that the necessary evils of revolution itself,
are greater than those we already enuure.
in reply to the first, 1 submit to Trumbull
& Co., for their consideration, the query:
"What earthly power ever prevented ten
millions of Anglo-Saxons from conquering
iheir freedom when they were united and
determined to do it V' And to the others,
I would sav?if we are not united, it would
be folly to attempt it: but whenever we are
united, '.he thing is done. Hence, the only
obstacles that prevent cur asserting our
rights, and vindicating our honor, are these
unfortunate gentlemen who seem to regard
a division of this Republic as a sort of final
consummation. Mv idea of it is a very
different one. Our government seems to
uie, iike a ship with water-tight compart
ments, to have.been constructed on the very
principles to insure its breaking up with the
greatest safety. Each State being in itself
a perfect organization, there could be no
inter-regoum, and the weakest division
would be far more powerful than the whole
at its first formation. It is against the
spirit of the age, for a people to remain
longer even under a monarchial government,
ilisri their rights are respected.
The greatest revolution?-the most bene
ficent in its results to mankind-?of which
have any account, was accomplished
without her ions disorder or bloodshed.-*
hon James ;he Second refused to respect
their religious scruples, the English people,
our forefathers, huried him from power and
placed a foreigner upon his-throne. Thereby
establishing the principle, that as the great
end of all government is protection, when
ever it ceases to answer, and becomes sub
versive of this end, the sacred right of revo
lution rests in the people. I do not believe
Oen. Washington himself ever contempla
ted the continuance of the Union one mo

The Philadelphia American of yesterday says:
"We hear of the suspension, to-day, of orte ot our

curing money on the deposit ot iron, the ditnc.i.ty
of negotiating Southern bills receivable, together
with the inability o? their Southern customers to

have caused this suspension.

and distracted condition of the country, and
the grievances between the slaveholding and
the nou-slaveholding States, be referred to a
spccial committee of fifteen members, aud that
said committee be instructed to inquire wheth
er ai\y additional legislation within federal
authority and duty be necessary for the pro
tection and security of property in the States,
and, if so, that they report by bill. And that
said committee be, aiso, instructed to consid
er and report upon the expediency of propo
sing such an amendment or amendments of
the Constitution of the United States as may
be necessary to give certain, prompt and full
protection to the rights of property ofciti/.ens
of every btate and Territory in the United
States, aud ensure tiio equality of t he States
and the equal rights of all the citizens afore
said under the Federal Constitution.
The resolution was laid over nuder the
rule.
On motion of Mr. lJigler, the Senate, at
minutes past noon, adjourned until Monday
next.
House of Representatives.
The House met at Uie usual hour.
Mr. Mayuard moved that the President's
message be printed in pamphlet form and
each member be supplied with a copy. But
the motion was finally withdrawn.
Mr. Phelps moved than when the House
adjourn, it adjourn to meet cu Monday morn
ing next: agreed to.
Mr. Morris, of Illinois, said it would be
remembered that on Tuesday he sought to
introduce a resolution concerning the perpe
tuity ol the American Union. Since then
lie had been called upon by various members
and requested again to present it. He there
fore gave notice that he would do so on Mon
day next.
Mr. Yallaudigham, from the special com
mittee appointed sit a former session on the
Seriate bill, abolishing the franking privil
ege, made a report thereon, and propose.)
certain amendments.
Mr. Cobb, from the committee on pnblic
lands, reported a bill to construe the mean
ing of the words "minimum price of the pub
lie lauds."
.vir. Branch said lie had hoped that sucli
bills would be withheld for the present, in
order that Congress might consider measures
of much more public importance.
Mr. Cobb replied that he would for that
purpose withdraw what he had oiFered, and
every thing he had left, in the shape ofliills.
liut until some conciliatory measures was of
fered. lie would in other respects perform his
duty.
Mr. Branch?I made no reflection upon the
gentleman.
Mr. Cobb?I did not so understand you.
Mr. Cobb wished to know from Mr. Branch
what was the meaning of minimum.
Mr. John Cochrane rose to a point of or
der.?Mmi/num is a Latin word, and the
business uf Congress is required tu be con
ducted 3n the English language. (Laughter.)
A motion was made that the biil be laid 011
the table.
The House refused to lay on the table, by
a vote of ayes i'O, noes 100.
Several unimportant amendments having
been agreed to, the bill wa* passed?ayes

Mr. Florence moved that the House ad
journ. Pending which,
1 he Speaker asked that the motion be
withdrawn, in order to enable him to name
the committee of thirty-three, appointed un
der the resolution introduced bv Mr. Bote
ler.
The motion was accordingly withdrawn,
i he Speaker said that the name of Mr.
Boteler had been omitted in the appoint
ment of the committee at his own request.
But for that, the Speaker would have obser
ved in his case the usual courtesy and cus
tom of the House. J10 had performed the
delicate.ta* k of appointing the committee to
the best of his ability, arid submitted to the
House the names of those who composed it,
as follow*:
Mr. Corwin. of Ohio; Mr. Millson, of Vir
ginia: Mr. Adams, of Massachusetts; Mr.
V? inslow, 01 North Carolina; Mr. Humphrey,
of New York; Mr. lioyce, of South Carolina;
Mr. Campbell, of Pennsylvania: Mr. Love,
of Georgia; Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut; M*

Hamilton, dl Texas; Mr. Washburne. of Wis
consin; Mr. Curtis, of Iowa; Mr. Durch of
California: Mr. Windon, of Minnesota; Mr.
Stout, of Oregon.
upon the announcement of the committee,
Mr. Hawkins, of Fla., said he hoped the
House would excuse him from serving on
the committee, fur the reasons which he had
stated in declining to vote upon the measure
on Tuesday iast. lie supposed that this
measure looked to unanimity, but if he were
appointed a member and acted on the com
mittee, he would, he believed, be necessari
ly constrained to make a minority report,
and thus destroy the very object for which
the committee was created. As he under
stood, the committee was a Union-saving
measure, he did not concur with it. He
thought that it came too late?the day for
com promises was past forever.
Mr. Cochrane of New York, regretting to
have heard the declaration of his friend from
Florida, appealed to him to withdraw it. in
iin eloquent speech. The gloom which the
sad condition of the country cast over the
House, rendered members careless of the
general business until the matter was dis
posed of. He felt sure that if the ;onstituen
cy of the gentleman among the Everglades
would, could they view the effort now before
the House, themselves urge him to take a
position upon the committee, lie did not bi
lieve that it was necessary that the commit
tee should be united. lie trusted, however,
that it would be. Clod grant that they could
bo unanimous. (Applause in the galle
ries.) (jod grant that all its proceedings be
in unity. If the country could not be saved,
it was due to the people that they should
know it: that there should be no excuse for
ignorance: that they should no longer follow
those who had led them to the verge of the
abyss. Let the people know what the issue
is. Let them know what arc the demands
of one section upon the other. Let them feel
the pulsations thai throb through the e >un
try, and be able to answer: Watchman, what
oi the night??Whether nmdness rule the
hour, or whether amid the storm which en
shrouds the country, there is a light dawn
ing in the east, through which may be seen
giving hope and promise, the flutter of the
stars and stripes as they float from this dome
over a re united people. (Loud applause in
the galleries.)
Mr. Garnett, of Va., said, he Loped as the
i discussion of an important subject was now
; about to begin, the decorum of debate
! would be observed, and no applause permit
: ed either on the H ;or, -i?r in the galleries.?
j (Ilisses.)
| Mr. Garnett said, if that was the way
i miserable blackguards in the galleries were
! allowed to insult the representatives of the
j, people, he would move that the galleries be
; cleared. (More hisses )
The chair appealed to the galleries to pre
| serve order.
i Mr. Cochrane was about to proceed, when
; Mr. Morris, of 111., appealed to him to desist
and not excite a discussion at this time.?
((jries of go on. go on.)
Mr. Cochrane, resuming, said that the
galleries might be excused for exhibiting
| feeling upon a subject of so much interest to
i every American, and said if his appeal to
his friend from Florida, proved to be in
vain, ho would ur<je the House not to excuse
the gentlemen. He thought it the great du
ty of the House to negative the motion thut
his friend be excused.
Mr. Crawford, of Ga., thought that the
House should not compel the gentleman to
serve against his inclination.
Mr. Florence moved to adjourn. Pending
which,
A communication was received from the
President, transmitting information on the Af
rican slave trade, called for by the House at
its last session?laid on the table and ordered
to be printed.
The motion of Mr. Florence, of Va., was
carried.
Mr. Boyco called for the yeas and nays,
some cyn fusion occurred.
Mr. Smith rose to the point of order, that
as the Chair had decided the motion to be
carried,..the call i'or yeas and nays cfimc too
late.'
Mr. Hawkins declared if it was supposed
that delay would inlluence him, it was a
mistake. lie had taken an unswerving posi
tion on the subject, after a consideration of
twenty years.
The questiou was taken and the House de
cided to adjourn by 104 to 92?and at 2b o'
clock adjourned.
Letter from Fairfax.
Correspondence of the Alexnndriu Gazette
Fairfax C. II., Dec. 0.?Tho adjourned
meeting of the citizens of this county, was
held on Saturday lust, relative to what course
I they might desire \ irginia to take in this
i momentous and gloomy period of our coun
| try's history. Tim attendance was unusually
i small, for a public meeting to consider grave
' and weighty matters. There is a spirit of
nationality and conservatism in our midst,
whioh regarded the meeting as uncalled for,
and forbade the delegates of this county be
ing instructed to vote for an immediate call
of a convention by the Legislature.
i The regular chairman being absent, A.
| Moss, esq., was called to the- chair. The
! committee appointed through the former
I chairman?having twice met and iailed to
agree upon resolutions?coinciding \\ith
views of all parties interested?
JT. V/. Thomas read a series of resolutions,
eminently wise, conservative and patriotic,
stating he did not offer them as chairman of
the committee, but simply as embodying his
individual opinions relative to what course
would best promote and strengthen the
bands of our beloved "l;niou," and that they
were concurred in by Capt. Win. II. Du
lauy. No vote was taken on the resolutions,
though they did credit to his patriotic heart
and the county lie so long and faithfully has
represented.
I enclose ?>. copy fur publication, furnish
ed by the request of many, knowing they
will inset a cordial response in the bosom ol
a decided majority of the law abiding and
Union-loving men in our midst, who would
regret to see the old Dominion "hitched" or
"dragged into" the dark abyss 'which now
threatens to engulph our great and gioriuus
Republic.
T. J. Murray next offered several resolu
tions?tho passage of which be potently ad
vocated?after various modifications and
amendments, they were adopted.
The meeting was addressed, relative to the
adoption of the latter resolutions, by (Japt.
!>.. who was decidedly opposed to instruct
ing our delegates to vote for an immediate
call bv the Legislature of a convention, stat
ing. whilst in favor of convention, he wish
ed it referred back to the people first, to say
whether they desired such a call. The del
egates being often elected upon local con
tingencies, and not to consider momentous j
questions like uuto the present?ably con-1
tending by logic and law, that he was un- [
willing to delegate this power to the Legis
lature, it being one fraught with danger in
the extreme, and one that he could not lend
his humble efforts in carrying out.
Speeches were made by Thos. Moore, Jno.
Powell. A. 13. Williams and others. Many re
garding the object of the meeting settled, re
tired. Afterwards, several resolutions were
offered, and attached to those of Mr. Murray.
A lew cockades have made their appear
ance in our midst, but the old staid portion
of the citizens not having kept posted with
the onward march of "Young America," of
ten ask what does that mean?
There was a young snow storm on Mon
day night, and "the weather continues quite
cool. The health of the county is generally
good.
The President's message was eagerly sought
after this morning, here as every ?where else;
some it pleases, aud some it d ies not, though
i sulficient time has not elapsed lor a general
' expression of sentiment. Will not the people
1 pause and deliberate, before they destroy
this, the grandest temple which has ever beeu
dedicated to human freedom since the world
begun? The Union has already made vs
the most prosperous, and ore long will, if
rRESKitvED, render us the most powerful na
tion on the face of the earth.
The following arc the resolutions, offered
by Maj. Thomas:
1. Itrsoh r-l, That we regard the Constitution o'
the United States as the best form of Government
ever devised : aud, properly administered, as all
sufficient lor the protection of ail parts of the
Confederacy, to insure its harmony and peace,
and t'ae blessings designed hy its framers.
2. That we hold the Union of the States, under
the Constitution, as absolutely necessary to the
adva"cin,f ii* it rests of our whole couiilr^ ? to In*
hopes of the world ; and that we look upon
Disunion as the greatest ealamity lhat can bof.il
our country, save dishonor.
3. That so long as the Constitution and Laws
shall bo failhfuilv executed, it is ihe duly ot^ al1
law abiding persons to ?ive obedience io lho Gov
ernment ; but we hold, in the language of Vir
ginia, ratifying the Constitution, "that tho pow
ers granted*under the Constitution, being uerivid
from the people of the Lnited Slates, may be re
sumed by them whensoever the same shall be per
verted t<? their injury or oppression, and tha'. every
puwer not granted* thereoy, remains wi h them,
and at their will."
4. That we resard tiie enactments against tne
Fugitive Slave Law in several of the Northern
Stales, and the open resistance to its execution in
others, as unwarrantable violations of the Con
stitution, a deliberate repudiation of sacred du
ties, and an unlawful withholding the guaranteed
rights of tho several States in which slavery ex
ists ; aud that wo hold that the obnoxious laws
must be repealed, as an indispensable condition to
rue preservation of our federal and fraternal rela
tions with these States.
a. That we regard the formation of a sectional
partv, aud the election of a President aud Vice
President by tho votes alone of that paity. us
directly calculated to disturb our Union, and to
render aUen to o.i< i> other (nose wh ? ought *o be
bound ugelher by fraternal affection.
fl. That we recommend a Convention o! all the
States, in or J or that such provisions may be
adopted as will forever stcuro the rights oi tho
South in tho Union, and adjust all cau.scs of dis
sension between the States, so that unity, peace
and concord, truth and justice may again prevail.
7. That wo earnestly appeal to tho Northern
! Stales to crush out the fanatical spirit that pre
vails in their miist, and which is fast sweeping
1 us into the dark abyss of dissolution and civil
; w:ir.
8. That wo alike appeal to our sister Southern
States to forbear, and unite with us in another
: attempt to preserve the Union; upon terms consis
; tent with the safety and houor of tho South.
! That if our appeal shall be unheeded, and it
shall appear that we cannot obtain such a rccog
: nitiou of our rights, that we "then recommend a
: Convention oI the Southern States, to consider
i tho most effective moans of securiug the rendition
of fugitive slaves and the rights to our property,
if the same can bo adopted in the" Union ; if not,
by such measures as will best promote the safety
and welfare of the Southern States.
10. That if, notwithstanding our earnest appeal,
ihe Southern State.", or any one of them, shall
withdraw from the Union before the meeting of
tho Legislature of Virginia, at its called session,
that in that ?'vcnt we recommend to the Legisla
ture to subini , at the earliest practical period, tho
question of |a Convention of the State to the
people, so tbey may determine what course it will
bo proper for Virginia to take in the present
crisis. If.
LOCAL ITEMS.
The Putnam Phalanx at Mount Ver
non.?The Putnam Phalanx, now on a visit
! to the Federal metropolis made a most in
| terestiug pilgrimage to Monnt Yernou yes
terday. The Phalanx left Washington, yes
terday morning about 10 o'clock, in the
steamer-Thomas Collyer, and after a pleasant
trip, 'arrived at Mount Vernon about 12
o'clock.
Upon landing, the two companies formed
into line and marched to "the grave ofWash- j
ington." around which they gathered, while
the Marine band played the solemn "'Mise
rere" from /'Trovetore." The band accom
panied the Phalanx by order of the Secreta
ry of War.
Rev. Mr. Moure then addressed the Throne
of (.5race in a fervent, patriotic and appro
priate prayer.
Mr. Stewart, Judge Advocate, then ad'
dressed the assemblage in an eloquent and
thrilling speech, which produced a marked
effect upon the crowd.
1). P. Tyler, esq., followed in an address
of considerable power and beauty, at the
conclusion of which he deposited upon the
Sarcophagus which coutains the remains of
the Father of his country, a boquet plucked
by a lady on the banks of the Delaware.
Mr. Stewart is the owner of the land on
which once stood the celebrated Charter Oak.
At the conclusion of the exercises, the
members of the corps visited the house and
grounds, and having spent some time in this
manner re-embarked on the steamer and re
turned to Washington.
New Military Company.?A meeting of
young men of this city, favorable to the for
mation of a new Military Company, was
held at the Armory of the Alexandria Rifle
men, last night, Col., M. D. Curse in the
Chair, and William Zimmerman, Secretary.
Committees were appointed to frame a Con
stitution and By-Laws for the Company;
to obtain recruits, and to procure arms.
The following officers were then unanimous
ly clected:
Captain?Col. M. D. Corse.
1st Lieutenant?Capt. Arthur Herbert-.
2nd " Delaware Kemper.
3rd " W. H. Fowle, Jr. >
The meeting then adjourned, to meet on
Monday night next, when the subject of a
proper-uniform and other business prelimi
nary to the organization of the Company
will be considered.
The Ma.vassas Gap Railroad. The
Woodstock Tenth Legion says:? The work
(?n this road is progressing very rapidly, am.
it. is confidently expected that through the un
tiring energy of President Marshall mid Chief
Engineer Goldsborough, the ears will reach
Harrisonburg by next fall, thus enabling the
farmers from that vicinity to ship their pre
sent crop of grain fro in that point, which
will be agreat convenience and saving of time
and expense to them. President Marshal
and Mr. Goldsborough are two of the best
railroad officers in the State, and are true old
Virginia gentlemen, and their kind and ami
able disposition has endeared them to all who
are interested in the success and welfare of
the road.
Washington' Items.?Three frame houses
on Capitol Hill, owned by Charles Miller,
and occupied by Mr. Cantwell, grocer, and
Mr. Rail, watch-guard at the eapitol, were
destroyed by tire on Wednesday. lusured.
At the Collector's oflioe of the Chesapeake
and Ohio Canal, in Georgetown,' the revenue
fur November amounted to $5,700. The
number of arrivals 145. Thus far this month
they have had twenty arrivals, several of
them being cargoes of flour.
Ljbrarv Lectures.?We are glad to an
nounce that Dr. Charles W. Chancellor, of
this city, has accepted an invitation to deliv
er the second lecture of the course before the
Alexandria Library Company, on the even
ing of Tuesday week. From the Doctor's
well known and acknowledged literary abil
ity, we are sure that those who attend will
listen to an entertaining and instructive lec
ture.
Partridges.?These delicious birds, the
sportsman's delight, the epicure's richest
treat, are now in great abundance, though
really one would not think so, judging from
die prices they command in market. Yester
day evening, one of our legal friends, who is
on a hunting expedition up the valley, sent
down by Railroad about twelve dozen as fine
conditioned birds as we ever a aw.
The Steamer Puwhatan'.?The steamer
Powhatan which has been on the ways, at
! he ship-yard of Messrs. Hunter &, Bro., for
the past three weeks, undergoing necessary
repairs, was launched yesterday morning,
and proceeded to Washington, where, after
being thoroughly refitted, she will resume
her regular trips upon the Richmond and
Washington river mail line.
Professor Anders ?n*.?Mr. J. II Ander
son, who is, we believe, the alpha and the
Oine?ia among the professional "wizards,"
will commence a short series of soirees and
matinees, in this city, on Monday next. Mr.
Anderson has been absent from Alexandria
eight years, and since that time has been
travelling all over the world, picking up,
here and there, new and clever "dodges" in
his peculiar line. The result of all this will
be a most agreeable entertainment?one that
never for a moment bores the audience. In
this sort of exhibition the pleasure of the
cheate 1 is certainly quite equal to that of
the cheat, provided the latter is clever: and
that is undeniably the case with Mr. Ander
son. As usual with experienced caterers for
the public amusement, he keeps the (mum
Ijour/ic, the "Mysterious Disappearance,''
and still more remaikahie discovery of hhr
chiidren, till the concluding item of the pro
gramme. The soiree, however, as an entire
ty, is an exceedingly pleasant one; and as the
Anderson exhibition is not only vastly en
tertaining, but entirely unobjectionable, even
to the most exi</eu/it member of the Sabbath
Committee there can be no doubt that the
"Professor" will find his srjour in our city
as profitable to himself as it will be agreea
ble to the public.

THE gazette's SPECIAL DISPATCH.
Washington, Dec. 0.?The belief that
four or five States will secede from the
Union before the next Anniversary of the
Birth Day of Washington, is entertained,
without an exception, in well informed cir
cles, hero. Public opinion among Southern
men is universally opposed to the coercion
of a seceding State; while among Northern
men of distinction, there is considerable
contrariety of opinion upon the subject.
The proposition on the part of some of
the Gulf States, squinting in the direction
of coercing the Border States into a South
ern Confederacy, by prohibiting the intro
duction of slaves from them, unless they
unite in ultra measures, is regarded by
moderate Virginians with feelings akin to
indignatiou. It combines' two of the vilest
of the schemes to compel emancipation in
the Border States, advocated long ago by
the Abolitionists, and the proposition is ut
terly unworthy the kindly feelings towards
the Old Dominion, which it is known are
entertained throughout the South.
It is reported here that Governor Letcher
is arranging a commission to proceed at once
to South Carolina, urging her to delay her
contemplated secession. Ex-President Ty
ler, Senator Hunter and Hon. W. C. Rives
are named in connection with the mission.
Mr. Pihett, denies the published statement
that in a recent speech he declared that Mr.
Buchanan was favorable to the secession
movement..
The committee named to-day upon the
Boteler resolutions are generally acceptable
to conservative men. Much regret is felt that
Mr. Boteler, of Va., requested his name to be
omitted"in" forming the committee. He has
however, given place to the clear headed
Gen. Milison.
The memorial presented in the Senate to
day by Mr. Latham asks Congress to pro
vided for carrying the entire letter mail by
Pony Express, and the residue of the mail
to be divided between Mr. Butterfield's and
the daily route to run through San Jose and
Placerville. The statistics exhibited show
the feasibility of the plau.
Senator Hunter's speech on the subject of
present difficulties and their remedy, which,
it is understood is now in the course of pre
paration, is anxiously looked for.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS DISPATCH.
"Washington, Dec. C.?The President, to
day, replied to the resoluticm passed at the
last session of Congress by the House of llep*
resentatives, calling for any information in
the possession uf the Executive, in relation to
the African slave trade, and the measures
taken for its suppression. It appears from
the report of the Secretary of State trans
mitted by the President in his message,
that the African squadron has been main
tained for the last tea years at an excess over
the ordinary-expenses of three hundred and
eighty thousand dollars per annum, and
that the excess of the present year, in con
sequence of the employment of steamers will
be ei^ht hundred thousand dollars. Not
withstanding the expenditure of this large
amount the British Government continued to
make complaints of the inefficiency of our
efforts to prevent the trafic, until the Presi
dent officially notified England that our gov
ernment does not desire any more sugges
tions on the subject, as we consider ourselves
abundantly able to regulate our own affairs.
To-day the speaker's warrants for the pay
of members of the House was refused at the
Treasury on account of the scarcity oi
funds. The warrants, it is said, will be
formally protested to-morrow. Only about
two hundred thousand dollars have been
paid to members since the commencement of
the session.
The proceedings of Congress show astern
resolve on the part of the South not to yield
to any proposed compromise, and that the
antagonism to the North is daily increasing.
ItTs not probable that any public business
of importance will be transacted by Con
gress until the all-absorbing question, whe
thef a compromise will be adopted on the
South seccde, be settled.
Later from California.
Death of Delazon Smith?Negro Riot at
Victoria.
Fort Kearney, Dec. 5.?The Pony Ex
press I'rom California passed here at half
past 10 o'clock, furnishing to the Associated
Press the following summary of news from
the Pacific coast-.
The death of Major J. B. Scott, of the army
at San Francisco, on the 22J, is reported.?
The mining reports from Oregon and Wash
ington Territory continue highly flattering.
The news received by this express and sent
by telegraph from Carson Valley, relating to
the secession demonstrations of Souih Caro
lina, Georgia, &c., had caused an unusual
sensation,?forming the universal topic of
conversation, generally in a regretful mood.
The brig U. S. Cabot, anchored at Men
docino during the gale of the loth, was cap
sized and the mate aud six of the crew lost.
A boat proceeding from the shore to relieve
the Cabot, artd manned by live men, was
also capsized aud all lost.
There was a serious riot at the Victoria
Theatre, November 3d, growing out of the
long existing prejudices of the negroes
against the whites. The negro population,
having emigrated to British Columbia from
California to improve their social position,
which they claim to be equal in all things to
any other race. The whites demur to this,
and ti e management of the theatre provided
'for its colored patrons in a separate part o:
the house. On the night in question, the
negroes concerted a plan to take possession
of the seats reserved for the whites. The
negroes first forced an admittance to the par
quette, and the whites attempted to expel
them. The actors on thesta.-e jumped into
the parquet c to assist in the i'g it.
The ladies took refuge behind the scenes.
The negroes, armed with clubs, came to the
rescue of their fellows. A number of the
whites were knocked down and kicked by the
negroes. Thecamphene lamps were thrown
about, bursting and actually setting the the
atre on fire. The negroes got possession and
drove out the whites and were in turn repuls
ed. Some of the negroes had tire-arms.?
The principal rioters were arrested and or
der was restored br the police. One hundred
negroes wero engaged in the riot.
Another attack on the theatre was planned
for November 10th, the day the steamer left.
A large poiice force was to be on hand.

from Yreka, announced the death of Delaxon

John Minor Botts on Secession.
Richmond, Dec. 6.?Last night, at the
banquet tendered to the State Electors, most
of the speeches made were strongly in favor
of the Union, and also in favor of a Conven
tion of the border Slave States, Hon. John
Minor Botta, however, opposed the right of
any State to secede from the Union, and ad
vocated a resort to force by the Federal Ad
ministration if the laws could not otherwise
be upheld.
This view was opposed by two of the prin
cipal speakers, and failed to meet with the
approval of the audience.
Fire at New York State Capitol.
