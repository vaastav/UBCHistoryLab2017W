Who Cominnntls the Armrt
The question of disputed Jurisdiction be
tween tho Senotary of War and staff do
paitmeut ofllceis on tho ono side, nucl gen
eral ofllceis coitimandlng troops on tho
other, Is taken up In tho annual reports, not
by Gen. Sheridan, us was expected, but by
Gi'ii, SciloPlELD. It Is truo that tho Lieu-tenitnt-Ueiioial
says that he heattlly coin
cides with the. latter officer's views, and
transfers them to his own report; but It Is
Gcu, ScuoFir.LD who furnishes the discus
sion, which Is In substnnco as follows:
"It Is sometimes of aupreme Importance that the ra
aponalbllittes of military administration and command
be ctearlv defined bylaw. And It it important at all
timet that the rules for the government of the military
service be establlaheil, like oilier laws, by competent all
thorltt.afler due consideration and under all the light
Mhleh experience enn bring to the all of the legisla
ture. Rignlallons tliua ealahllshed. and subject to
change only bv Congress, would have such degree of
slabllttvat lo become the bails of a tumid military syt
tern, nhkh, up to the present time, has not existed In
thlt country
" Althoiuh the regnlatloui have undergone changes
almost without number, the most Important questions
Involved in the command and government of the army,
which hate been the source of constunt embarrassment
and the cause of much enntrotersy for many years, re
main unsettled at the present time. No cninmanllng
tlenerat, from the highest to the lowest, can know the
extent or limits of hit authority, and no one can have
any staff responsible to hint for the faithful execution of
tils orders."
Such difficulty as exists In tho case scorns
to be created, to begin with, by tho phrase,
" commaud of tho army." For forty years,
at least, this phrase has boon officially used
to express the command to which tho rank
ing geueial officer Is assigned. Secretary
Lincoln once described It as " a convenient
and conventional phrase," whoso Interpreta
tion must bo "left to bu limited by thn nets
of Congross, regulations, and established
usage." OJTlccrs, however, who havo been
assigned to this high command are not dis
posed by any means to regard It as only a
conventional phrase, but to tako It literally
and strictly, as any other military order Is
taken. Secretary Lincoln hold that tho
word army as employed In this phrase,
"means in tlmo of poaco, tho aggre
gation of all tho commands of military di
vision commanders, whlcli iu their tuinaro
madn up of tho commands of military de
partment comnriuders." Of course this def
inition takes away all authority of thn com
manding Generul to issue orders to the chieTs
of staff departments, as they aro not Included
In tho military division commands. Lleut.
Gon. Sherida-n, on tho contrary, said of ono
such chief (if bureau, tho Corumlasary-Gen-eral:
"He Is a part of thearmy of tho United
States, and tho President placed mo In com
mand of thn army." In fact, section 1,031 of
the Itovlsi'dStatutos, which describes of what
elements the army shall consist, includes tho
staff departments among them.
Tho subject is further complicated by tho
fact that two of tho chiefs of htaff de
partments, tho Adjutant-General and tho Iu-spector-Gonoral,
aro undoubtedly subject to
tho oiders of tho commanding General as
well as to thoso of tho Secrotary of War.
Paragraph 1,329 of tho array refill itlons ex
pressly mentions this double liability of tho
Inspector-General. Tho Adjutant-General's
twofold responsibility comes from tho fact
that ho IsAdjutaut-Geucral of thn command
ing General, as well as the chief of a War
Department bureau. It certainly sooms
strange to llnd this officer making two en
tirely distinct annual reports each year, care
fully selecting certain subjects for tho com
manding Geuoral's cousideiation and cer
tain others for the Secretary's.
After all, however, thn real difficulty is
perhaps not that tho law is iin'etl'd as to
tho channels of command through which
ordors should proceed, but that it Is not yot
settled In tho way that some officers com
manding troops consider to bo tho right way.
They may feel vory strongly, for example,
that orders for the chauges of station of offi
cers may bo more properly made from army
lioadquarters than from tho War Depart
ment, even whero the Secretary originally
assigned them to duty; that modifications of
regulations for clothing and equipment may
also bo most wisely so made; that loaves
might he safely issued from tho commanding
General to olTlcers of tho general staff. Yor,
some of tho!-o changes would coutraveiio
army regulation whllo othors would bo
greatly affected by tho question of expense,
and tho Secretary is mado responsible for
all tho flscnl affairs of tho army.
Gen, Scuoi'lELD, tn short, might find It
less easy to point out matters relating to
command on which no authoritative decis
ions havo been rendered, than thoso in which
tho decisions are, in his viow, quostlonablo
on tho ground of tho Interest of the service,
and which sliould bo revised by Congross.
Uitllil Your Own Cttniil.
From ono of tho energetic gentlomun now
engaged in promoting tho Hennepin Canal
scneme, wo have received an Interesting let
tor. The lioadquarters of the nntorpriso are
at Davenport, Iowa, whlcli will ho tho west
em terminus of tho canal, If it is constructed.
The object, as overvbody may not remem
ber, is to secure for tho trade of Davenport, of
tht State behind Davenport, and of thn upper
Mississippi generally, a dliect waterway
across northern Illinois from the Mississippi
River to LakiOIichlgan, at Cnicago. A ca
nal already exists from Chicago west to
Hennepin, on the Illinois Kiver. Tito link
to be constructed Is sixty-llvo mlloa rong,
reaching from Hennepin to tho Mississippi
at Hock Island, just opposite to Davenport.
Tho estimate of Government euglaocrs for
tho cost of this canal Is $3,89J,72J.
Our friend, tho Secrotary of tho Daven
port Board of Trado, makes a personal ap
peal to The Sun to support, on public
grouuds, tlo claim of the Hennepin men that
thn Government ought to undertake tho
canal Job at Its own expenso:
" We are Iti earneat in this matter. We need the canal,
and mean sooner or later to have It, whoever opposes,
in the Interest of cheap transportation which we con
ceive to be the question of most vital interest to the
people that exists and not as a Job' or 'steal It
should not require argument to show that we have no
other thin legitimate interest In tbW evial when It Is
only asked Hint II be built under the direction of the
r-ccretar) of War, hv as safe a body of ineu at exist, the
army Engineer Corps "
Willi, if you need the canal, and if you
mean to havo it, why not go ahead and dig
It? Vim say that thn cost will bo trilling,
V'ou say that tho saving of six cents
a bushel in tho transportation of one
half of tho wheat crop of tho seven
Northwestern States wuiild not $T,000,000 iu
a single year, or enough to build ten
Mich canals. You say that Davenport is
a lively town chock full of enterpilse, Why
doesn't Davenport go ahead and dig tho
canil tint would so wouitei fully Increase her
slzn and prmp"rity, as well as tho market
value, of thn propel ty of her citizens? Why
ask tho taT,paycrsof Maehlasaiid Seattle and
Jiieksonvllln mid Sail Diego to pay thn cost
of stai ting a boom Iu Davenport real entntii ?
It seems to un to lie i at her a significant
fact that til" let'er in whlcli our correspond
ent urges The Sun to lend tfuclplng hand to
thn Hennepin job is written on the back of a
ort of immigration circular, lettirur forth
"Davinport's Advantages for tho Greatest
Manufacturing City of tho Northwest."
At tho top of tho page Is a map of the canal,
running across country from Chicago to
Davenport. Then we nro Informed that
Davenport possesses, among other advan
tages, bank deposits "equal thoso of any
tin eo other cities In Iowa," " gas all over tho
city," "coal Holds all around us," "a noted
Academy of Soloncos," a " Young Ladles'
8emlnary," "a grand chlmn of 12 bells," and
"Surroundings of Hertuty and Health. Come
and Sek Us!" Next wo hnvo a list of whole
salo dry goods, grocery, and boot nnd shoe
dealers, retail grocers, doctors, wltolesalo
and total! clothing establishments, iawyeis,
hatters, brewers,' bottlers, and dentists, all
belonging lo tho enterpilslng organization
of which our rorrospondent is the Secretary.
" Real estate," adtls tho circular, " is to-day
at extremely low prices, but is on the up
ward tendency, nnd tho llrst that como will
secure bargains."
Wo tlon't doub.t It, If tho Government digs
ami pays for the Hennepin Caunl.
An Illstoricnl Incident.
The following letter which reaches us
from Brooklyn, l elates to au lucidout of much
historical interest:
"Sis'. On the binding of the first volume of Otn.
Uramt's Memoirs, there Is diplavcd a shoulder alrap with
four stars, and I notice the same device In hla nlclurea
What Is the aulhorlti for II? Paragraphs 2,OM and
2,00.1. Regulations of the Armv, describe at follows the
Insignia of rank to be worn on the epaulet and shoul
der straps of tho General of the Armr: 'Two sliver em
broidered stars of neraya each, and gold embroidered
armaof the United Slates between them.'
"A Oraid Arxt Mar."
When Gen. Grant received tho appolnt
mentof General of tho Army, ho was In tho
Held conducting operations against tho
enomv. At that tlmo wo lind only two sorts
of Generals Major-Genernls and Brigadier
Generals and tho Insignia of their rank woro
prescribed by tho regulations. A Major-General
wore two stars upon his shoulder straps,
and a Brigadier-Genet nl ono star.
A few years before Gon. Scott had held thn
rank of Lloutenant-Goueral, and ho woro
thrco stars. But Vio rank of General had
been unknown In tho United States servico
slnco tho tlmo of Washinoton. It was neces
aarj however, that Gen. Grant should at
onco assumo bomo Insignia appropriate to
the now distinction which ho had received,
and, after consultation, it was determined
that ho should wear four stars, mid this ho
tlid as long as tho civil wnr lasted, and, iu
fact, until ho was elected President.
Tho emblems to which our correspondent
refers as pi escribed by tho present army reg
latlons wero adopted later. Tho four stars
which appear on tho binding of Grant's
Memoirs aro precisely what ho woro during
tho wholo time of Ills sorvicu as General.
Tho Depth of Isnornuce.
Here Is an averment which well illustrates
the depth of Ignorance which may exist even
in thn minds of cultured pet sous. Itlsfiom
the Iiiinlon J'ost that we quote:
"Every month J.0 i.ivmof gnt,l In the public Treasury
aro pntd out for fJ.tMl.OAJof siliirto lie Idle In the
public Treasury."
Isn't such Ignorance something wonderful,
especially In Bostou ?
Tlio Treasury buys its silver in the mar
ket, at the market pi ice, and basal ways dono
so. Whatever prollt thero is on its ooiuago
tho Government makes.
Accortllug to the report of tho Director of
the Miut, tho purcha-ios of silver in the Il-c il
year ending June 30, 1833, were a littlu less
than twenty-four millions and a quarter of
standard ounces, costing, in round nutnberb,
twenty-three millions nnd tlitee-quarters of
dollars; and from this quantity of sliver,
moro than twenty-night millions and a half
of stund.ird dollars wero coined. That is to
say, for two millions of gold paid out
monthly tho Treasury received two milllous
nnd three-eighths of sliver money.
It is truo the silver lies idle in the Treasury,
but that 1.5 no fault of the silver. Tho Tiens
ury refuses to pay it out; that is all.

onorolos from 1,100-foot tons to oyer 52.000
font tons." It may bo addod that tho weight
of the projectiles has Increased In this porlod
from C8 pounds to 2.000 pounds, and that tbo
enormous tnni:o of nlnomllos has boon reached
by modern guns. Our torts worn mostly con
structed at a tlmo when bombardments by 210.
320. nnd 420 pounders woro expected. A fort,
too. Is a fixed target for tho naval gunner, while,
with its powerful protected engines, thn ship of
war can constantly shllt Its oosltion, nnd thus
confuse thn aim of tho artillerists In thn fort.
In tho systems of Improved fortification al
ready under consideration, a prominent place
Is occupied by stool turrets. These mny bo
olthor llxed o'. revolving; nnd ono recent modi
llcatlon of the Urltlsh system proposed for our
harbors Is to maUo tho turrets floating, so Hint
with powerful tnaeliitmry thoy can bo Bhlftod
from ono point in a barber to another.
den Nuwton has estimated tho cost of forti
fying Now York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Bal
timore with turrets and heavy guns at alltllo
overtwenty-IHe millions. Tho cost of torpe
does nnd of Hanking defences would bring tho
aggregate ahove thirty millions. This, of
course, would Include every oxpno connected
with thn guns and their omplacomutits. In
New York there would bo four stool two-gun
turrets at tho Narrows, mounted with 100-ton
guns, nnd ilireo such turrots on tho Enst
lllver. Tho seven turrots would cost tCOO.ODO
each, or f4.2OU.O00 in nil, nnd thn fourteon
guns for thorn would cost $100,000 eidi, or
$1,400,000, tho aggregate of tho guns and em
placements being Ci.GOO.OOO. In addition there
would bo twenty iron casemates nt tho Nar
rows, and ten on tho Hast River, costing 1100,
000 each, or 13.000,000 15 all. nnd a fifty-ton gun
coming ViO.AiiO In each, or $1,SOO,000 for tlio
thirty. Till- would add J4.500.00ll to tho former
amount. Then ft the Narrows there would lie
twenty em placements for barbette disappearing
rllles, and nl the East Klver ton. The cost for the
thirty, nt t.lO.oOO each, would be 1900,000. ond
that of the thirty 20-ton barbette guns for
lliem. nt 120,001) each, would lie 1000.00(1. so that
born would bo a total or $1,500,000 to be milled.
Finally, to complete tho system there would bo
nlnoty-slv 12-Inch mnrtars and emplacements
nt tho Narrows, and forty-olglit at the I'.imt
Klver. costing $17,000 (inch, making t2.44S.000
more.
The aggregate for New York would thus bo
fI4.dlS.0UU. and with exactly similar tuns and
emplacements. In smaller quantities, thn har
bors of I'hilodelphla. Boston, nnd Baltimore
would bo defended. Tim expense to bo Incur
red seems great, but. as Mr.Tilden has pointed
out. it is nearly nil Involved In the original out
lay for construction, tho cost oT Bnnual main
tenance boing small. Besides, It will bo seoli
by the figures nlready clvon bow gront a num
ber of now ompl.icomnnts nnd guns nro siip
plleil lor the monoy. When. alno. a system Is
once decided upon. It can bocsrrled out bysue
csslva annual appropriation", and oaeh com
pleted emplacement with Its gun will bt) so
much ndded to the national security.
A Sitiuthern Oiilnlein wit tke Question.
From tht nmri.jemnrrut.
Few abler or more forcible letters havo
been written by public men than that of Hon.
S. J. Tililnn tn Mr. Carlls'e. calling attention to
thn neces-lty for the improvement of our eoaBt
defences, nnd urging Mr. Carlisle to exert his
influence, as Speaker, to secure soma nctlon of
Congress on this point.
The 7,)ne(r7imi)ii'af has gone over this sub
ject thoroughly, and has pointed out tho neces
sity of improving our coast defences, and It
lias called upon Congress to order the work
done. Wo, of cnuise, feel gratified to boo so
eminont a state-man ns Mr. Tilden lend this
subject tils attention, recognize the importance
nf this work, and devote himself to bringing It
about. Ho is personally uninterested, yet. ns a
p.itriotlo citizen, he sees tho necessity
of this country so putting Itsolf In de
fence like other powers, that in ease nf a differ
enceand one is liable to spring up at any min
ute It would not suffer the humiliation ot sen.
lng its clilei cities In the bands ot the enemy.
If the United Slates was threatened with war
to-morrotva panic would run through ovory
soaport. knowing the weakness of ourtiavyand
the lack of any elllcient coast defences, the
utter want ot preparation for war, oltlter offen
sive or defensive. In tho last foreign war wo
wero engnned In with a power of liny stiength,
wo had the humiliation of seeing our hnndinmo
capital in the hands of tho enemy. A new wnr
to-morrow would bring even worse results, for
Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington.
New Orleans, and San 1'iiincisen would fall easy
victims to any power possessing ecn nseeond
rate navy.
Tho only remedy.the only course tlintwlll
give us complete confidence, thnt will allow our
fiovet niiii'iil to adopt a vigorous policy. Is a
belter system of eoasl d fences. As Mr. Tilden
points nut, it is fur better to be dollelnnt In
mc,inso offence than In those of defence. It
will not seriously cripple tills country to bo un
able tn invade some other land, hut there must
be a fueling of security that no ate safe ntlioinii
ugalnst tho enemy.
As for those who talk nbout tlio Improbability
of foreign war, they are Indoed poor statesmen
who ilo not propurn for our dofenco now, In
stead of waiting for war to actually begin bn.
fore doing so. Then, of course. It would be too
Into. It will be tlio work of vonrs ns It Is, nnd
wo cannot begin a day too soon, for who knows
what complications and dlllloultles tho coming
years may bring with them ?
Our produnt coast defeness aro ludicrously
lUKUfllrlent for the changes and Improvements
that have been mado in naval warfare during
tho Inst few years. Ws havo unfortunately
been unable to donnyllilngfor themnn account
of our financial situation, anil they stum! now
just as they did twenty years nnd more ago;
Indeed, In ninny Instaneos limy have deterlo.
ated in that time. The now guns in lite fleets
of Kurnpe nre now of sufllclent range tn knock
our chief const cities tn pieces without coming
In range of our so-railed harbor defences, and
thus dtroylng f S.OOtl.liOO.inni of value.
"The liMK guarantee ugalnst nggresslon,"
says Mr. Tlidnn, "lliubest ns-iiraine that our
dipiotiinok will he suci-easliil. and Hint our
rights and honor will he lesiieeted by other na
tions, is In their knowledge Hint we nre lu n
situalinn to vlndlcato our rupuiation and our
Interests."
Mr. Tihlon thinks thnt tho present Is the

When Editor Reynolds of ForCriinnrfSrrnm
arrived at the office yosterdny morning ho
found a crowd pushing and dragging each
other to get a nearer view of a box mndeof
wood and tin, with openings to give fresh air
to anything inslds of It. Twollttloono-ronr-old
grizzly bears sniffed the cool air and shivered
ns though thoy did not like It, Mr. Reynolds
sent to Nah Crook's for a large supply of
broad, sonked In hot water. Tho cubs enjoyed
their bronkfnst, wbilo Mr. Reynolds posted this
notice on the box:
i DON'T MOTHEIl THE MUR. I
Then he went up stairs to ascertain, If he
could, how t'orefl anil ificniu came to bo pos
sessed ot two grlzrllcs. Ho lonriied, by lotlers
nwnltlng him. that Ihe bears were n present
from Col. Joseph Kip. a half breed trader
In Montana, who had received somo kind
ness trom a representative) ol Furrft nnd
Stream, nnd had taken this method of repaying
It. lie had obtained the cubs trom a l'legan
Indian In exehntign tnr stnres. Last May Ihe
Indian, while hunting In the Rocky Mountains,
saw a grizzly benr cub nnd Inssoood it. The
llttlo animal screamed so loudly that It soon
brought its mother to the rescue. Thn Indian
was a line rifleman, nnd ho killed tlp old griz
zly at th" llrt shot. The echoes of tho report
had hardly died away when two other llttlo
cubs catno, npparmitlv to mourn tbolr dead
mnthor. The skilful l'legan soon lind thorn In
captivity, too. The Indian dragged his threo
llttlo cnptlvos howling to his wigwam, nnd tied
them up will o bo went back to cut up their
mother. When he returned, laden with the
skin, clnws, and tcoth. the young bears had
broken away ond effscted their escnpe. He
tracked them nnd recaptured two o them.
Superintendent Conklln hns ngreod to pro

though they nre something lu tbo nature ot

mind what to do with them before) thoy grow
too big to ha fed on bread nnd hot water. A
crowd stnred at them yesterday until they wero

Tho Hov. W. Hay Altkon hold up before the

at noon yestorday a vivid picture of th death
ot the ricn man.
"Do ou never think you've got to die, you

you will not bo worth nn obituary notice?
Think of yourself In thnt hour whn you nro

"O most pour rich man, blown llko n loaf

"What are vou worth? That's the question

on the oilier side of tho Dark Vnlluy."
The congregation was aked to rise if the
