Mr. Blaine aanounces,for ths second

la robust health and has grown stent
since he waa last in New York. An
old biown Darby hat of a style several
years gone by, a dingy brown overcoat,
eheok trooserr, an old-fashioned linen

marked features of a is appearance.
Hon. William H. English's old bank
at Indianapolis, long the strongest in
the state, will present j be closed. It
is quite solvent, hut can no longer pay

Senator Logan's fortune now consists
of his Washington home, a tbtee-stoiy
house in Chicago, a farm somewhere in
the interior of Illinois, his salary aa
Senator, and a wife who loves him pas
sionately. Tae widow of General Hancock, who
has been the goes; of Colonel and Mrs.
Mitchell, of Washington, for the peat
week, will retarn to Yonkere, N. Y., in
a few days to pas the winter. In the
early coring ale will remove her effects
to the capital and take up a permanent
residence there. Her health ia said to
be somewhat improved.
The oleomargarine law which wet
snppeeed to be for the benefit of the
farmers is proving a curse to some of
them. As the officers begin to enforce
the law in all its strictness every pound
of butter offered for sale is subject to
inspection, and if the buttermilk is not
thoroughly worked out the butter is
condemned as bogus.
The socio ,j young men will surprise
ike girls with a new wrinkle this win

bnt they will powder their hair. Io be
prematurely gray is to be in the hsigbt
of fashion. If jot have a florid face so
much the better, but gray you mosi be
and still look young. A fashionable
hairdresser bas ben besieged with ap
plications for a lotion which will bring
about the desired result, but he has
failed to produce anything satisfactory
aa yet, although he bas sold quantities
of stuff which he claims will bring the
"silver threads." Those who are im
patient have given up its use, however,
and will powder their hair.

Henry Watterson, the brilliant and
versatile editor of tbe Louisville Cour
ierJoumal,vr ho hss just returned from
England, says, "we have nothing to say
of the English social system as far as it
relates to the Eaglish. Tbst every
Englishman after the Prince of Wales
is a snob does not concern us. That
the Prince of Wales is a debauched
blackguard, with a nose for American
girls, doeii concern us. That ths Amer
ican Minister is dreadful little cad
and toady does concern ua. That Amer
ica is represented in Eaglish society by
a riff-raff of vulgar American women,
who haye themselves or their daughter
te pot on the mirket, dees concern us.
Of all theee we have told the truth and
nothing but the truth, though not the
whole trt tb, which in decency we could
not tell is a newspaper which goes to
and is read
enneftsaa.
Congress met last Monday and, with
out any excitement, entered upon the
work of the session. The President's
message was read to the two housee
and joint convention. The document
is a very osndid, plain statement of
matters that interest Congress and the
people. JSenator Mitchell and Repre
sentative Hermann have presented res
olutions in their respective housee call
ing upon the Seoretary of War for the
reasons far the delay on the public
works at the mouth of the Colombia,
Cascades and Yaquina Bay. The usual

Aa shewn by the President in hie
message there has been a reduction in
the expense of the Government in all
departments, except in the pension
office, where there has been an increase
of nearly $8,000,1)00. We especially
invite the attention of old soldiers to
this faot. They were told when Mr.
Cleveland waa a candidate that if he

should be elected no more pensions
would be paid. But here is an acta

As we predicted in our laat Usue.the
Democrats of Salem did aone very good
work et the cty election in that city
last Monday. They elected J udge. W.
M. Rataeey, Mayor, by a majority of
32 over W. W. Skinner, Republican
The? also elected three Council men
The Republieane elected MarshalTreas
urer and two Council men. The Re
publican Council men were elected by
three majority each. We think it al
toewther lively that the Democrat
would have elected every eendidate had
they not been quarreling among them
selves over a' matter so trivial that even
children should have, nettled without
contention.
A private letter from Frank Nichols,
who lived in this city two years ago.but
who returned to his old heme ia Smith
land, Iowa, has been received at this
settee, in which we are informed that en
the 13th and 16th of November snow
fall to the depth of over two feet.
Think of that, now. Snow 3 feet deep
in Iowa and at the same time we were
bavins iust the ah -bleat frosts here
with nice warm weather, and even yet
the thermometer marks about 50 above
zero, r o wonder uregonian io ve tneir

In whatever light Mr. Blaine may
bo viewed or io whatever position bo
may be found, it will be seen that this
fate bang over him. In three presi
dential, campaigns he haa started out
with a buoyancy nod a dash which have
inspired much confidence in his follow
ers, bnt sooner or later the catastrophe
haa come. For a ebot t race he proba
bly would be unriyaled. A long ecu
test must bring cat the inherent weak
ness of the man's character. He is
now engaged in the meet trying strug
gle of his life. Grander figures than
bis and men with better balanced
minds have gone down before the trying
ordeal to which be ia subjecting him
self. The Presidency is yet two yeara
away, and time is James Q. Blaise's
worst enemy, next to himself.

Salem
While sojourning here I may give
you a word now and then. I will now
apeak of the election that came off here
Monday. When Democrats have an
opportunity, they are apt to disregard
it. They would rather have a little
spite work on band than a victory.
Just as was done in Linn when they
gave away their State Senator,knoaing
that be waa one who could elect a U.
a Senator in two years, There is ths
same foolishness in Salem. The Dem
ocratic tieket here was the best io ths
field from top to bottom, and it oould
have been all eleoted if Democrats had
voted (or it. Judge Ramsey waa eleot
ed Mayor, but O'Donnal, for Recorder,
and Bristow, for Marshal, were beaten
by Democrat io votes. It waa Demo
orate that opposed the committee of
eitisens from endorsing Bristow a few
Democratswho intended to support
Waller, a Republican, and did so and
were beaten by Bristow, ss they should
hive been. Had not Waller been nom
inated, Bristow would have been a'sct
ad. The Democrats who engineered
this defeat, I understend, ar not only
well known, bot that one of them at
ieaat wants an office from the National
administration. The Democratic can
didates reoeived a large Republican vote,
because the candidates were preferable,
and bad the Democratic vote been poll
ed for them every one would have been
ejected. Democrats who go orasy over
reform and unite with an independent
movement to accomplish their end have
always been left. The citi sen's move
ment here wanted to break down tb
"whisky ring," and inatead of support
tog the Democratic candidates, who are
juet in ail their dealings and tern iterate
in habit, preferred to throw the Demo-
orate overboard and allow the Republi
cans to sleet officers that will be no
improvement on those condemned. This
ts nothing new. Really the old Re
publican officers are considered in some
respects aa improvement on tbe new
Republican elected. Democratic re
venges are what shooid bo dropped.
Itis may serve to remedy this foolish
nose. The Democratic CvuncUmen ere
excellent men. They are A. B. Muir,
Judge Shaw, N. Bush, a young gentle
man of ex eel lee t busineee qualifications.
With Judge Rameey for Mayor, Salem
wilt have a good government. Judge
Kamsey bad 12 majority for Mayor
Tbe Bristow vote united with Wsilar
would have given Bristow 41 majority.
Bristow bad 7 majority over Walter.
Cone i daring that Bristow ran againat
two Republicans who were supported
by both Democrats aod RpuMicaes,he
is entitlr.d to tbe ooagratnlationa of hia
friends. Tbe Bristow vote, including
both Republican and Democratic, i re
garded aa the expression of the sound
est and most conservative vote in tbe

Official Expressions" Royal" found to be the
only absolutely pure baking powder.
Governor Hill, of Now York (says a reporter of tb) N. T.
Tribune), itji : " I havo boon astonished lately at the extent of the
adulteration of food. It would seem that every thing wo eat is adul
terated. This ad alteration of groceries is becoming a na
tional oril one that we shall havo to adopt severe means to check."
The machinery of the law cannot bo put at work toospocdily or
too rigorously against this wholesale adulteration of the things wo eat.
Both the health and the pockets of tho pooplo demand protection.
There is no articlo of food in general use mora wickedly adul
terated than baking powder, Tho New York State Board of Health
has analyzed 84 different brands purchased in tho State, and found
most of them to contain alum or lime, many to such an extent ss to
render them seriously objectionable for use In food.
aThe sale of adulterated baking powders has been prohibited by
statute in several States. It will be in the interests of the public
health when their sale is made a misdemeanor everywhere, and the
penalties of the law are rigidly enforced.
The only baking powder yet found by chemical analysis to be
entirely free from ltmo and absolutely pure is the "Royal." This
perfect purity results from tho cxclusivo use of cream of tartar
specially refined and prepared by patent processes, which totally
remove from it the tartrate of lime and other impurities. The cost
of this chemically pure cream of tartar is much greater than any
other. Tho high grade of tho Royal Baking Powder has been fully
etfabtiahed by official chemists. .
Prof. Low, who made tho analyses of baking powders for the
New York Stato Board of Health, as well as for tho Government,
certifies to the purity and wholesomeness of tho " Royal"
Prof. IL A. Mutt, Into Government chemist, says: "It is a
ieitntifio fact that tho Royal Baking Powder is absolutely pare."
Dr. E. IL Bakxlet, chemist of tho Brooklyn Department of
Health, says (April 24, 1885): "I havo recently analyzed samples
of the Royal Baking Powder, purchased by myself in the stores
of this city, and find it free from lime in any form."
Prof. McMi'KTRig, chief chemist U. S. Department of Agri
eulturo, Washington, D.O.,says: "The chemical tests to which I
have submitted the Royal Baking Powder prove it perfectly
healthful, jand free from every deleterious substance. "
Bread, cake, biscuits, etc., prepared with Royal Baking Powder
will be lighter, tweeter, and more wholesome than if made with
any other baking powder or leavening agent.
