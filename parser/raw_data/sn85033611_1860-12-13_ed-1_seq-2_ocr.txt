This ought' to 'be the -last desperate
remtdv of a despairing people, after
eyerv other constitutional means . of
conciliation had been exhausted.' We
hould reflect that.under this free gor
ernment there is an incessant ebb and
flow of public opinion. The slavery
question. like everything human,, will
have its day. I firmly believe that it
has already reached and passed the
culminating point j but if, in the midst
of the existing excitement, the Union
shall perish, the evil may then become
irreparable. Congress can contribute
much to arrest it, by proposing and
recommending to the Legislature of the
several States the remedy for existing
evils which the Constitution has itself
provided- for its own ' preservation.
This has been tried at different critical
periods of our history, and always with
-eminent success. It is to be fonnd in
ihe 5th article, providing for its own
amendment. Under this article,
amendments have been proposed : by
two-thirds of both Houses of Congress.
and have been ratified by the Legisla
tures of .tnree-fourths of the several
States, and have consequently become
parts of the Constitution.: To this pro
cess the country: is indebted for the
lause prohibiting Uongress from pas
sing any law respecting an establish
xnent of religion, or abridging the free
dom of speech or of the press, or the
Tight of petition.: To this we are also
indebted for the bill of rights which
secured the people against any abuse
ot. power by the b ederal Government
Such were the apprehensions lastly en
tertained by the friends of State rights
at that period, as to have rendered it
extremely doubtful whether the Consti
tution could have long survived these
amendments.

of Representatives, in February, 1803.
j.d9 amendment, was rendered neces
ary to prevent a recurrence of the
dangers which had seriously threatened
me existence ot the: Government dur
ing .the pendancy of that election.
The article for its own amendment was
intended to procure the amicable ad
justment of the conflicting : Constitu
tional questions, like the present, which
might arise between the Governments
of the States and of the United States
I his appears from contemporaneous
History, in this connection. J shall
merely call attention to a few instances
in Mr. Madison's justly celebrated re
port, in 1779, to the Legislature of Vir
ginia. In this, he ably and conclusive
If defended the resolutions of the pre
reeding Legislature against the stnc
tares- of several other. State Legisla
tures..: .These were mainly, founded
Bpon the protest , of the .Virginia Leg
islature, against the alien and sedition
acts as palpable, and alarming infrac
tions on the. Constitution. In pointing
out . the , peaceful - and constitutional
remedies and he referred to nono oth
er to which the States were author
ized to resort on such occasions, he con
eluded by saying that the Legislatures
of the States might have made a direct
representation to Congress with a view
to obtain a rescinding of the two of
fensive acts, or they might have repre
sented to their respective Senators in
Congress their wish that two-thirds
thereof would propose any explanatory
amendment to the Constitution ; or
two-thirds of themselves, if such had
been their option, might by an applica
tion to Uongress have obtained a con
mention for the very same object. This
is the very course wbioh I earnestly re
commended, in order, to obtain an ex
planatory amendment of the Constitu
tion on the . subject of slavery. This
might originate with Congress or the
State Legislatures, as may be deemed
most advisable to attain the object
I be explanatory amendment might be
confirmed to the final settlement of the
construction of the Constitotion-'on
three special points : Firet, an express
recognition oi the right of property in
siayes in the states where it now exists
er may hereafter exist Second, the
duty of protecting this right in all the
common territories ; throughout their
territorial existence, and until , they
shall be admitted as a State into the
Union, with or without slavery, as their
.Constitution may prescribe. Third, a
like recognition of the right of the
master of his slave, who has escaped
from one state to another, to be re
stored and delivered up to hina ;' and
the vilidity of the Fugitive Slave Law
enacted for this purpose, together with
ucciarauuu mat au oiaie laws lm
pairing or decreasing this right are vio
la tion s of the Constitution, and conse
mently null and void.
iltmay be objected, that this con
struction of the Constitution has al
.ready been settled by the Supreme
Court of the United States, and what
more ought to be required ? The an
swer is that a very large portion of the
people of the United States still con
trovert the correctness of this decision
ana never will cease from agitation
and admit its binding force until clearly
estaonsnea Dy tne people of the several
Mates in their sovereign character.
Such an explanation would, it is be
iieved, forever terminate the existing
dissensions, and restore peace and har
mony among the States. It ought not
to be doubted that such an appeal to
the arbitrament established by the Con
stitution itself, would be received with
favor by all the States of the Confed
" eracy. . la aov event it ought to be
tried in a spirit of ceaeiliation before
any of these States shall separate them
selves from the Union.
' ' When I entered upon the duties of the
Presidential ofnee, neither our foreign
nor domestic affairs were at all satisfac
toryv We were involved in dangerous
complications with several nations,and
two of pur territories were in a state

a restoration of the Aincan sjave iraae

whom we were at peace.
In addition to theso and other diffi
culties, we experienced a revulsion in
monetary affairs, soon after my advent,
proving of unexampled severity and
ruinous consequences to the country.
When we take a retrospect oi wnat
was then our condition, and contrast
this with the material prosperity at
the time of the late Presidential elec
tion, we have abundant reason to re
turn our gratetul thanks to that merci

' OCa FOREIGN RKLATIOXS .GKKAT BRITAIN.
Our relations with Great Britian are
of the most friendly character. Since
the commencement of ray administra
tion, the two dangerous questions aris
ing from the Clayton and Bulwer trea
ty, and from the right ot search claimed
by the British Government, have been
amicably and honorably adjusted. The
discordant constructions of the Clayton
and Bulwer treaty between the two
Governments, which, at different peri
ods of the discussion, bore it threaten
ing aspect, have resulted in a final set
tlement, entirely satisfactory to this
Government. In my last annual mes
sage, 1 informed' Congress that the
British Government had not then com
pleted arrangements' with the Kepub
lics of Honduras and Nicaragua in pur
suance of the understanding between
the two Governments. It was never
theless confidently expected that the
good work would ero long be accom
plished. 1 his confidence has since
been fulfilled. Her Britanio Majesty
concluded a treaty with Honduras on
the .28lh of November 1859, and with
Nicaragua on the 2Sth of August, 1800,
relinquishing the Mosquito Protecto
rate. Besides, by the former the Bay
Islands are recognized as a part of the
Kepublio of Honduras. -
It may be observed that the stipula
tions of these treaties confirm in every
important particular to the amendments
adopted at London, on the 17th Octo
ber, 1856, between the two govern
ments. It will be recollected that this
treaty was rejected by the British Gov
ernment because of its objection of the
just and important amendment of the
Senate to the article relating to the Kua-
tan and the other islands in the Bay of
Honduras. It is a source of sincere
satisfaction to all classes of our fellow-
citizens, and especially to those en
gaged in foreign commerce, that the
claim on the part of Great Baitain for
cibly to visit and search American
merchant .vessels on the high seas in
time of peace, has been abandoned.
This was, by far, the most dangerous
question to the peace of the two
countries, which has existed since the
war of 1812. Whilst it remained open,
they might at. any. moment have been
precipitated into a war. This was
rendered manifest by the exasperated
state of public feeling throughout our
entire country, produced by the forcible
search, of American merchant vessels
by British cruisers , on the 'eoast-of
Cuba,-, in the spring of 1858. The
American people hailed with general
acclaim the orders of the Secretary of
the Navy to our naval force in the Gulf
of Mexico, to protect all vessels of the
United States on .the hisrh seas from
search or detention by: the- vessels of
war of any other nation. These; or
ders might have produced an unfortu
natef collision between the naval forces
of the two countries.'- This was most
fortunately prevented by an appeal to
the justice of Great Britain, and to the
law of nations, as expounded by her
own most eminent jurists. ' The only
question of any importance which still
remains open is the disputed title be
tween the two governments .to the is
land of San Juan, in the ; vicinity of
Washington Territory. As this ques
tion is still under negotiation, it is not
deemed advisable at the present mo
ment to make any other allusion to the
8ubject t - . - .; . J '.
The; recent visit of the Prince of
Wales in appropriate character, to the
people of this country, has proved to
be a most auspicious event in its con
sequences. It cannot fail to increase
the kindred and kindly feelings of both
countries in their politioal and social in
tercourse with each other. v

J With France, our ancient and power
ful ally, our relations continue to be of
the most friendly character. A decis
ion hasrecently been made by a French
Judicial Tribunal, ' with the approba
tion of the Imperial Government,
which cannot fail to foster the senti
ments of mutual regard that has so
long existed between the two coun
tries. Under the French law, no per
son can serve in the armies of France
unless he be a French citizens.
The law of France recognizing the
natural right of expatriation, it follows
as a necessary consequence, that a
Frenchman, by the fact of having be
come a citizen of the United States,
has changed his allegiance and has lost
hi3 native character. He cannot,there
fore, be compelled to "serve in the
French armies, in case' he should re
turn to his native couutry. Theso
principles were announced in 1852 by
the' French Minister of War, and in
two late cases have been confirmed by
the French Judiciary. In these, two
natives of France have been discharged
from . the French army, because they
had become American citizens. To
employ the language of our present
Minister of France, who has rendered
eood service on this occasion. "I do
not think our French naturalized fellow-citizens
will here experience much
annoyanoe on this subject I venture
to-predict that the time is not far dis
tant when the other, continental pow
ers will adopt the same wise and just
peliey which has done so much honor
to the enlightened government of the
Emperor." In any event, our govern
ment is bouncf to protect the rights of
her naturalized citizens everywhere, to
'the same extent as- thouch they had
drawn their first breath in this country.
We can recognize no distinction be
tween our native and naturalized citi
zens. !

i , 1 SPADT. I f - ' S ; 5
Our relations with Spain are now of
a more complicated, though less dan
gerous character, than they have been
tor many years. Our citizens have
long held, and continue to hold, numer
ous claims against the Spanish govern
ment These have been ably urged for
a series of years by our successive di
plomatic representatives at Madrid,but
without obtaining redress. The Span
ish Government finally agreed to insti
tute a joint commission for the adjust
ment of these claims, and on the fifth
dayot Aiarcn, iou, concluded a
convention for that purpose, with our
present Minister at Madrid. Under
this Convention, what have been de
nominated the Cuban claims, amount
ing to $128,635 54, in which more than
one hundred of our fellow-citieens are
interested, were recognized,; and the
Spanish Government agreed to pay one
hundred thousand, dollars of this
amount within three months following
the exchange of ratifications. The
payment of the remaining '628,635 54
was to wan me aecision oi me com
missioners for or against the Amistad
claim, but in any event, the balance
was to be paid to the claimants, either
by Spain or the United States. Those
terras, I have every reason, to know,
are highly satisfactory to the holders of
the Cufyan Claims. Indeed, they have
made a formal offer, authorizing the
State Department to settle their claims,
and to deduct the amount of the Amis
tad claim from the sums which they
are entitled to receive from Spam. This
offer, of course, cannot -be- accepted
All other claims of citizens of the Uni
ted States against Spain, or of subjects
of the Queen of Spain against the
United States, including the Araisted
claim, were by this Convention referred
to a Board of Commissioners in the
usual form. Neither the validity of
the Amisted claim, nor any other
claim against either party, with a sin
gle exception of the Cuban claims,was
recognized by the Convention. Indeed,
the Spanish Government did not insist
that the validity of the Amisted claim
should be thus recognized; notwith
standing its payment has been recom
mended to Congress by two of my pre
decessors, as well as by myself, and an
appropriation for that purpose had
passed the Senate of the United Stales.
They were content that it should be sub
mitted to the Board for examination
and decision like the other claims
Both Governments were bound respec
tively to pay the amounts awarded to
the several claimants, at such times
and places as may be fixed by and. ac
cording to the tenor of said awards,and
transmitted by this Convention, to the
Senate for their constitutional action.
On the 3d of May, 1860, and on the
27th of the succeeding June, they de
termined that they would not advise and
consent to its ratification.' I heso pro
ceedings place our relations with Spain
in an awkward and embarrassing post
tion. it is more than prooabie that a
final adjustment of these claims will de
volve upon my succssor. I reiterate
the recommendation contained in my
annual message of .Deoemcer, 1858,and
repeated in that of December, 1859, in
favor of the acquisition of Cuba from
Spam by fair purchase. 1 firmly be
lieve that such an acquisition would
contribute essentially to the well-being
and prosperity of both countries, in all
future time, as well as prove the certain
means of immediately abolishing the
African, slave-trade, throughout the
world. I would not repeat this recom
mendation upon the present occasion,
if I believed that the transfer of Cuba
to the United States, upon conditions
highly favorable to Spain,' could justly
tarnish the national honor of the proud
and ancient Spanish monarchy. Surely
no person ever attributed to the first
Napoleon a disregard of the national
honor of France, for transferring Louis
iana to the United States for a fair
equiyalent, both in money and commer
cial advantages.
AUSTRIA, AC.
With the Empire of Austria and the
remaining continental powers . of En
rope, including that of the Sultan, our
relations continue to be of the most
friendly character.
' cniNA.
."The 1 friendly and' peaceful policy
pursued by ? the Government of the
United States towards the Empire of
Uhina, has produced the most satisfac
tory results. The treaty of Tien-tsin
of the 18th of June, 1858, has been
faithfully observed by the Chinese au
thorities. The Convention of the 8th
of November, 1858, supplementary to
this treaty for the adjustment and sat
isfaction of the claims of our citizens
in China referred to in my last annual
message, has already been carried into
effect, so far as this was practiced.
Under this convention, the sura of
500,000 taels, equal to about $700,000
was stipulated to be paid in satisfaction
of the claims of American citizens out
of the one-fiftieth of the receipts for
tonage, import and export duties on
American vessels, at the ports in Can
'ton, Shanghai and Fuchou ; and it was
agreed that this amount shall be in full
liquidation of all claims of American
citizens at the various ports to this
date. Debentures for this amount, to
wit : 300,000 taels for Canton, 100,
000 tor onangnai, and 100,000 for Fu
chon, were delivered according to the
terms of the convention, by the respec
tive Chinese collectors of the customs
of those ports, to the agent selected
by our Minister to receive the same,
Since that time the claims of our citi
zens have been adjusted by the Board
of Commissioners appointed for that
purpose, under the act of March 3d
1859 ; and their awards, which proved
satisfactory to the claimants, have been
approved by our Minister; in tho ag-
gregate, they amount to the sum of
$498,694.7,8. The claimants have al
ready received a large proportion of
tho suras awarded to thera, out of tho
fund providedj'and it is confidently et
pected that the remainder will, ere
ong, be entirely paid. After the
awards shall have been satisfied,. there
will remain a surplus of more than
$200,000 at the disposition of Congress.
As this' will in equity belong to the
Chinese Government would not justice
require its appropriation to some be
nevolent oojeci, in wuicu.. me imnese
may be specially interested? ? I :-
Our Minister to China, in obedience
to his instructions, has remained per
fectly neutral in the war between Great
Britain and France and the Chinese
Empire, although in conjunction with
the Russian' Minister, he was ever
ready and willing had the opportunity
offered, to employ his good offices in
restoring peace between the parties. It
is but an act of simple justice, both to
our present Minister and his predeces
sor, to state, they , nave both proved
fully equal to the delicate, trying and
responsible positions in which they
have on different occasions " been
placed. . . :
JAPAN.
The ratifications of the treaty with
Japan, concluded at Yeddo on the 29th
of July, 1858, were exchanged at
Washington on the 22d of May last,
and the treaty itself was proclaimed
on the succeeding day. -mere is a
good reason to expect that under its
protection and influence, our trade and
intercourse with that distant and inter
esting people, will rapidly increase.
The ratifications of the treaty were ex
changed with unusual solemnity. For
this purpose the Tycoon had accredited
three ot his most distinguished Minis
ters Plenipotentiary, who were received
and treated with marked distinction
and kindness, both by the Government
and people of the U. S. There is every
reason to believe that they have re
turned to their native land, entirely sat
isfied with their visit, and iuspired by
the most friendly feelincrs for our
country. Let us ardently hope, in the
language of the treaty itself, that there
shall henceforward be perpetual peace
and friendship between the United
States of America and his Majesty the
lycoon of Japan and his successors.

With this wise conservative and lib
eral government of the Empire of Bra

most amicable character.
XEW GRENADA.
The exchange of the ratifications of
the Convention with tho Republic of
iNew urenada, signed at Washington
on the 10th September, 1857, has been
long delayed from accidental cause, for
which neither party is censurable.
These ratifications were duly exchanged
m tins city on the 15th ot November
last. Ihus has a controversy been
amicably terminated, which had be
come so serious at the period of my in
auguration as to require me, on the
17th of April, 1857, to direct our Min
ister to demand his passports' and re
turn to the United States. Under this
condition, the Government of New
Grenada has specially acknowledged
itself to be responsible to our citizens
for damages which was caused by the
riot at Panama on the 15th April, 1856.
These claims, together with other
claims of onr citizens" which had been
long urged in vain, are referred for ad
justment to a board of Commissioners
I submit a copy of the Convention to
Congress and recommended the legis
lation necessary to carry it into effect,
. COSTA RICA AND NICARAGUA.
. Persevering efforts have been made
for the . adjustment of the claims of
American citizens against the Gov
ernment of Costa Rica, and I am hap
py to inform you that these have finally
prevailed ; a Convention was signed at
the city of San Jose, on the 2d of July
last, between, the Minister resident of
the United States in Costa Rica,- and
the Plenipotentiaries of that Republic,
referring these claims to a Board of
Commissioners, and providing for pay
ment of their awards. This Conven
tion will be submitted to the Senate for
their Constitutional action. The claims
of our citizens upon the Republics of
Nicaragua, have not yet been provided
for by treaty, although diligent efforts
for this purpose have been made by our
minister resident in that Republic
These are still continued : with a fair
prospect of success.
MEXICO.
Our relations with Mexico remain in
a most - unsatisfactory condition. In
my two last annual ; messages I dis
cussed extensively the subject of these
relations, and do. not, now propose to
repeat at length the facts aud argu
ments then pretended. They proved
conclusively that our citizens residing
in Mexico, and our merchants trading
thereto, had suffered a series of wrongs
and outrages such' as we have ever
patiently b6rne from any nation For
these,:our successive ministers, invok
ing' the faith of treaties, had, in the
name of their country, presistcntly de
manded redress and indentification, but
without the slightest effect Indeed,
so confident had the Mexican authori
ties, because of our patient endurance,-
that they universally believed
they might commit their outrages upon
American citizens with absolute impu
nity. -Thus wrote our Minister in 2S56,
and expressed the opinion that nothing
but the manifestation of the powers of
the Government' and of its purpose to
punish these wrongs would avail. Af
terwards,' in 1857, came the adoption
of a new Constitution for Mexico, the
union of a President and a Congress
under its provisions, and the inaugura
tion of a President within ' one short
month. ; However, the President was
expelled from the capital by a rebellion
in the army, and the supreme power
of the Republic was assigned to Gen.
Zuloaga. This usurper was in his turn
soon compelled to retire from the place
by General Miramon. Under the Con
stitution which had thus been adopted,
Gen. Juarez, as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, became the lawful
President of the Republic, and it was
for the maiutainauce of the Constitu-
tion, and his authority derived from it,
that the civil war commenced and still
continues to be prosecuted. Through
out the year 1858 the Constitutional
party grew stronger and stronger. In
the previous history of Mexico a suc
cessful military revolution at the cap
ital had most universally been the sig
nal for submission throughout the Re
publics. ,j
Not so on the present; a majority
of the citizens presistcntly - sustained
the Constitutional government -When
this was recommended in April, 1859,
by the I Government? of the United
States, its authority extended over a
large majority of the, Mexican States
and people, including Vera Cruz, and
all the important seaports ot the Ite-
public. ' From that period our com
merce with Mexico .began to revive,
and the constitutional government has
afforded it all the protection in their
power. ,' Meanwhile the government of
Miramon still held sway at the Capital,
and over tho surrounding country, and
continued its outrages against the few
American citizens who still had the
courage to remain within its power.
To cap : the climax, after the Battle of
Tacubaya, in April, 1859, lien. JMar-
qnes . ordered three citizens ' ot the
United States, two of thera physicians,
to be seized in the hospital at that place,
and shot without trial. This was done,
notwithstanding our tfnfortunate coun
trymen were at the moment engaged
in the holy . cause of offering relief to
the soldiers oi DOtn parties wno uau
been wounded in the battle, without
making any distinction between them,
The time had arrived jn my opinion,
when this Government was. bound to
exert its power to avenge and. redress
the wronsrs of our citizens, and to af
ford them orotection in Mexico. 1 he
interposing obstacle1 was, that the
country under the sway of Miramon,
could not be reached without passing
over territory under the jurisdiction of
Constitutional Government Under
these circumstances, I deemed it my
duty to recommend to Congress in my
last annual message, . the employment
of a sufhcient military force .to pene
trate into the interior where the gov
ernment of Miramon was to be found,
with, or if need be, without the consent
of the Juarez government, though it
was not doubted his consent could be
obtained. Never had I a clearer con
viction on any subject than I have of
the justice as well as wisdom, ol.such
a policy. ISo other alternative was
left, except the entire abandonment of
our fellow-citizens who had gone to
Mexico under the faith of treaties, to
the sympathetic injustice, cruelty and
onnression ' of the Miramon Govern
ment Besidesut is certain that a sim
pie authority to employ this force would
of itself have accomplished all our ob-
lects without striking a single blow.
The Constitutional Government would
then have been established at the city
of Mexico, and would have been ready
and willing, to the extent of its ability,
to do us justice. In addition, and J
deem this a most important considera
tion, Foreign Governments would have
been deprived of all pretext to inter
fere in the territorial and domestic con
cerns of Mexico. We should thus have
been relieved from the obligation of re
sisting even by force, should this be
come necessary, and attempt by these
- . T -i j i
liovernments to deprive our neignpor
ing Republic of. portions of her territo
ry, a-duty Irom which we. could not
shrink without abandoning- the tradi
tional and established policy of the
American people. ' " 1
I am happy to observe that, firmly
relying upon the justice and good faith
of these Governments, there is no pres
ent danger that such a contingency will
happen. Having discovered' that, my
recommendations would not be sus
tained by Congress, , the next alterna
tive was to accomplish in some degree,
if possible, the same objects, by treaty
stipulations with the constitutional gov
ernment. Such treaties were accord
ingly concluded by our late' able and
excellent Minister in Mexico, and on
the fourth of January last were, submit
ted to the Senate for ratification.' As
they have not received , the final action
of that body, it would be improper for
mc to present a detailed, statement of
their provisions; Still I may be per
mitted to express the opinion, in ad
vance, that they are calculated,to pro
mote agricultural, manufacturing and
commercial interests of the country,
and to secure onr just influence with an
adjoining Republic, as to whoso for
tunes and fate we can never feel indif
ferent ; whilst at the , same time they
provide tor the payment of a consider
able amount towards the satisfaction
of the claims of our injured, fellow-citi
zens. ' . '
. ' KAXSAS AXD UTAH.
At the period of my inauguration I was confront
ed in Kansas by a revolutionary Government, ex
isting under what was called the TopeVa Constitu
tion, i ne avowed object was to subdue the terri
torial Government by force, and to inaugurate
what was called the" Topeka Government in its
stead. To' accomplish this object, an extensive
military organization was formed and its command
entrusted to the most violent revolutionary leaders.
Under these circumstances it became my impera
tive duty to exert the whole Constitutional power
of the Executive, to prevent the flames of civil
war from raging in Kansas, which the excited state
of the public mind both JCorth and South micrht
have extended into the neighboring States. The
hostile parties in Kansas had been inflamed against
eacn otuer by emissaries both from the orth and
South, to a degree of malignity without parallel in
our history. To prevent eventual collision and to
resist the civil magistrates in enforcing the laws, a
strong detachment of the army was stationed in the
Territory, ready to aid the Marshal and his deputies
when officially called upon as a posse comitatus in
the execution of civil aud criminal processes. ' Still
the troubles in Kansas could not have been per
manently settled without an election by the people,
the ballot-boxes being the surest arbitrator of dis
putes among : freemen. Under this conviction,
every proper effort was employed to induce the
hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates
to frame the State Convention, and afterwards at
the election to decide whether Kansas should be a
Blave or free State. The insurgent party refused
to vote at either, lest this might be considered as
a recognition on their part of the Territorial gov
ernment established by Congress. A better spirit,
however, 6cemed soon after to prevail, and the two
parties met face to face in this election, held the
brst Monday of January, 1858, foV members of the
Legislature and State officers, under the Lecomp
ton Constitution.' The result was the triumph of
the anti Slarery party at the polls. ; This decision
of the ballot box proved clearly that this party
were in the majority, and removed the danger of
civil war. . From that time we have beard nothing
of the Topeka government, and all serious danger
of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then at an
end. The Lecompton Constitution, which had been
thus recognized at this State election, by the votes
of both political parties in Kansas, was transmitted
with the request that I should present it to Con
gress. Tuis I could not have refused to do, with
out violating my clearest and strongest convictions
of duty.
The laws, and all the proceedings which preceded
and followed its formation, wer fair, and regular
on their face, and what.l then believed and ex
pressed has proven- true ; the' interests of the
people of Kmnsat would have been best consulted
by us admission, as a-tate, into the Union, espe
cially as the majority within a brief period, could

will and pleasure. If fraud existed in any or all
of 'these proceedings, it was not for the President
but for Congress to investigate and determine the
question oi iraua, ana what ought to be tne con
sequences; If at the two first elections the majority
fused to TOtei it cannot be Dretpnded that this
refusal to exercise the electoral franchise could in
validate an election fairly held under lawful author-'
ity, even if they had not voted at the third election.
it is true mat iueuic vuiiuiuuon naa not been
submitted to the people, as I always desired, but
the precedents are numerous of the admission of
States into the Union without such admission. It
would iiot comport with my present purpose to re
view the proceedings of Congress npoa the Le
compton Constitution. It is sufficient to observe
that their final action has removed the last vestige
of serious revolutionary troubles. The desperate
band recently assembled under a notorious outlaw
in the southern portion of the Territory- to resist
the execution ot tne law ana to piunaerpeaceaoie
citizens, will, I doubt not, be speedily brought to
justice. Had I treated the Lecompton Constitution
as a nullity -ana rciusea to transmit it to uongress,
it is not difficult to imagine, ' whilst recalling the
position of the country at that moment, what
would have been the disastrous consequences both
in and out of the Territory, from such derilection
of duty on the part of the'Executive. -J : ' ! .
- Feace has also been restored within the Territory
of Utah, which, at the commencement of my ad
ministration, was in a state ot open rebellion.
This was the more dangerous, as the people, ani
mated by a tanatical spirit, ana entrencbed within
their mountain fastnesses, might have made along
and formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it
was necessary to bring them into subjection to the
Constitution and the laws. Sound policy, therefore,
as well as humanity, required tnat tnis object
should, if possible, be accomplished without the
effusion of blood. This jcould only be effected by
sen dinar a military force into the Territorv, suffici
ently strong to convince the people that resistance
would be hopeless, and at the same time to offer
them a pardon for. past offenses; on condition of
immediate submission to tne government, mis
policy was pursued with eminent success : and the
only cause for regret is the heavy expenditure re
quired to march a largo detachment of the army to
that remote region, and to furnish its subsistence.
Utah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet, and
the military force has been withdrawn, except that
portion oi it necessary to Keep me iiiuiaua iu cure,
and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to
ur i wuiu pusseaaiuun. . i .. r: - .

OFFICIAL PAPER OF TIIE COUNTY.
DOWAGIAC:
Thursday Morning, December 13, I SCO.
The President's message.
To the exclusion of our usual , mis
cellaneous matter, we lay this ponder
ous document before our readers entire
in this issue of the Mepublicani The
critical state of public affairs have
caused this message of Mr. Buchanan
to be anxiously looked for,and the same
reason . will, no doubt, ' secure for it a
very general perusal. - . .
It will be seen that more than'one
third of the. message is devoted to a
defence of-and apology, for Slavery.
After thanking Providence for the hap
piness and prosperity which this nation
has enjoyed during the past two years,
he begins with the utterly false and un
founded assertion that " the long con
tinued and intemperate interference of
the Northern people with the question
of Slavery in the Southern States," is the
cause of the crisis . that is no w fairly up
on us.'. ;IIow it is possible for Mr. Bu
chanan, with the eyes of the world full
upon him, to have given publicity to
this false, arid malicious libel Upon the
people of the xorth, is more thau we
can imagine. Does he not know.th'at
the North has never in any manner in
terfered with 'Slavery' in the: States
where it now exists; is he not 'aware
that the people of the North disclaim
any authority to interfere mtl it there.
It would' certainly seem; so; ;Mrj Bu
chanan knows full well that evcrv act
connected with' the Slavery question
for the past fifty years, have been di
rectly to benefit the South. In fact, he
himself says, that "it is a remarkable
fact that in all these years, no, single
act has ever passed Congress, ;, unless
we may. possibly! except the .Missouri
Compromise, impairing in the slightest
degree the. rights of the South to their
property; in slaves." Mr. 4 Buchanan
might well have left out the exception
of the Missouri Compromise, as. every
school boy knows that it was a southern
measure. ' ' ' '
' Yet with all these facts staring him
in the face, he gives publicity to the
above falsehood in his vain attempt to
fasten the blame of the present condi
tion of things upon the North.' How
true is it that falsehood is always ex
posing itself by absurdities. - . -
. Mr. Buchanan then asserts that "it
would 'be easy for. the people of the
United States, to forever settle the
slavery question, by simply letting the
Slave States alone, and permitting them
to manage their domestic institution in
their own way :"and in almost the next
breath, he proposes to force slavery
down the throats of, the Northern peo
pie, and compel them to protect and
extend it, by so amending the Consti
tution as to embody in it " an express
recognition of the right of property in
slaves in the States where it now exits,
or may hereafter exit ' and by "pro
lectins this ntrht in all the common
Territories throughout their territorial
existence," &c A very logical way of
settling the question no doubt, but we
fear the Northern people will fail to
iouuw ins auvice. . 4
Mr. Buchanan begins quite sensibly
about secession, employing able and
conclusive "reasoning1 to show that no
State has-a right to secede.1 'He 6hows
conclusively that secession is unconsti
tutional,' that it is nothing more nor less
than revolution, reminds himself of his
oath to support the Constitution, says
that he is bound to see that the laws
are faithfully executed, 'arid! froni this
obligation he cannot be absolved by
any human power ; and then very coolly
tells, the soceders that he cannot cocreo
themrand even points out to them how
they can keep him from doing so. This
is certainlv a stranere oversight in the
Constitution, to compel the President
to execute the laws, and still not give
him the. right tolo so. Our Union is
worti but little if the power nowhere
tejsides to fceep itjmited. It is pain
fully'evident that Mr. Buchanan is not
equal to the present emergency. He
. i I. ' It. J 2..
evidently desires j 10 sausiy ino ouu
that his mild objection to tne aocinne
of secession is only designed for pub
lic effect, and that be has no "personal
objecUoiftb'a praeScal application, of
it, when necessary to the interesti of
slavery,- ,(;.: " , ,At
But we' refrain from any further"
comments, at this time at least, on the
Messa2.i :;-Our readers, have it "before
them entire, and can judge of Us mer
its or demerits for themselves. , It is
to say the least, a long-drawn out and
tedious document, wherein Reason ; i
insulted, Humanity outraged, History
travestized and Common Sense defied,
to the interest of. Human Slavery and
for the gratification of its upholders,
and we have no doubt the whole coun
try will thank God, that, whatever evils
the future may have in store for this
nation, this is the last "annual message"
that Mr. Buchanan will inflict upon the
people of the United States.' '.
A Good Move.
"' On the first day of the present ses
sion of Congress, Mr. Grow called up
the Homestead Bill, introduced by hini
immediately after Mr. Buchanan vetoed
the Conference Bill, passed .by both
Ifpuses last session, and we are happy
to say that through the resolute conduct
of its author, it has already passed the
House. . Whether it will pass the Sen
ate or not, we have our doubts, and if
it does, it will probably encounter the
President's veto; . The passage of tho
Homestead Bill thus'early in .the ' ses
sion, proves'that the Republican Hep
resentatives do not intend that the dis
union furor shall interfere with, the peo
ple's business. . - . j . ' .
The Burch Divorce Case. This
case, which has occupied the public
mind in a great degree,' for " the past
five weeks, was given, to. the Jury on
Monday noon, After being out . only
about' an hour, the jury brought in a
verdict for the defendant, denying the
application of Mr. Buch for a divorce.
The counsel for (he defence gave notice
that they should apply for1 custody of
the two children and alimony. - '.
