area now disturbed by any embodied
forco ot Insurgents. Ho says that to
tho physical character of the country,
to tho naturo of tho warfaro of tho

sclt-samo hour, to the humanity of tho
tioops, which Is taken advantage ot
by tho rebels and tho Inhabitants who

tion to tho American forces, Is duo
tho prolongation of tho gucrrlla war
fare. Ho recommends that there bo no fur
ther material reduction of troops be

ments which aro being organized

ent that an excellent foundation has

has been dono without undue harsh
ness or severity of treatment of tho
inhabitants."
In anticipation of a partial concen
tration of the troops In the Philippines
next year Gen. Chaffee submits esti
mates of cost for tho construction of
quarters and barracks. He recom
mends that a permanent post be con
structed at once in the vicinity of Ma
nila for a garrison of two squadrons
of cavalry, two batteries of artillery
and two full regiments of infantry, to
gether with a hospital and store house,
tho whole to bo under tho command of
a brigadier general. He gives $500,
000 as n rough estimate of cost for this
project, and says that $200,000 should
bo available immediately in order to
tako full advantage of tho dry season.
For tho construction of permanent
quarters at other points which may be
determined upon during the fiscal year
ended Juno, 1903, bo estimates $2,000,
000 Is required.
American soldiers, he says, fall to
discriminate between real and assum
ed friendship on the part of the Fili
pinos. A table Is submitted showing
that slnco June 10 last, the date ot the
last tablo submitted by Gen. MacAr
