i
M-
Washington. Dec. G.The president's
.message was delivered to congress yes
terday, and is one of the most important
docun'ents coming from an executive in
recent ytars:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives. "Notwithstanding the added burdens
rendered necessary by the war, our people
rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily
increasing degree of prosperity, evidenced
by the larger volume of business ever
recorded. Manufacture has been pro
ductive, agricultural pursuits have yield
ed abundant returns, labor in all fields of
Industry is better rewarded revenue leg
islation passed by the present congress
has increased the treasury's receipts to
the amount estimated by its authors the
'finances of the government have been
successfully administered and its credit
advanced to the first rank while its cur
rency has been maintained at the world's
highest standard. Military service under
a common flag and for a righteous cause
has strengthened the national spirit and
served to cement more closely than ever
tho fraternal bonds between every section
of the country."
In reviewing the controversy which led
|\ip to the war with Spain, tiie president
itakes up the thread of narrative where it
.terminated in his last annual message.
He concluded: "It was honestly duo to
our friendly relations with Spain that she
|should be given a reasonable chance to
[realize her expectations of reform to
iwhich she had become irrevocably com
imitted." i It became evident, however, that the
iproposed plans were barren of good re
sults. No tangible relief was afforded the
'reconcentrados, among whom the rate of
.mortality frightfully increased the prof
|ferred .expedient of zones of cultivation
proved illusory and it was apparent that
nothing save the physical exhaustion of
ISpain or the Cubans and the practical
jruin of the island of Cuba could result
from the struggle then in progress.
At this critical juricture the destruction
jOf ihe battleship "Maine" occurred. Con
cerning it, the president says:
"It is a striking evidence of the poise
and sturdy good sense distinuguishing our
national character, that this unlooked-for
blow, falling upon a generous people, al
ready deeply touched by preceding events
in Cuba, did not move them to an in
stant, desperate resolve to tolerate no
longer the existence of a condition of dan
ger and disorder at our doors that made
possible such a deed, by whomsoever
wrought."
Resuming the war narrative, the prejri
.dent directs attention to the measures, in
cluding the $50,000,000 appropriation for
national defense, taken to place the coun
try on a war footing, and adds: "It is
sufficient to say that the outbreak of war,
Iwhen it did come, found our nation not
'unprepared to meet the conflict."
Reference is made to the apprehension
of coming strife by the Continental pow
ers, voiced in the address to the president
_Jthrough their ambassadors and envoys,
and to the president's reply thereto. Still
animated, however, by the hope of a
lpeacefu solution of the difficulty, and
[obeying the dictates of duty, the president
Irelaxed no eort to bring about a speedy
lending of the Cuban struggle. Negotia
tions with the Madrid government proved
[futile, so far as practical results were
l-concerned. and when the president pre
sented the question to congress, saying:
"In the name of humanity, in the name
of civilization, in behalf of endangered
American interests, which give us the
right and duty to speak, and to act, the
war in Cuba must stop."
The Declaration of War.
The result of this statement of the case
was the adoption of the memorable joint
resolution by congress, declaring the pur
pose of the United States to intervene be
tween the Spanish and Cubans. Follow
ing swiftly upon the enactment of the res
olution came the severance of diplomatic
relations between the two countries, the
proclamation of a blockade of Cuban
ports, the calling for volunteeirs and the
formal declaration of the existence of a
state of war. All other governments
were Immediately notified of the existence
of war, and each proclaimed neutrality.
"It is not among the least gratifying in
cidents of the struggle, that the obliga
tions of neutrality were impartially dis
charged by all, often under most delicate
and difficult circumstances."
The president reviews at length the
work of pieparation for war, referring
(particularly to the enlistment of the vol
unteers to the material increase of the
(navy in both men and ships and to the
precautionary measures taken for the
I protection of the seaboard coast and the
cities.
I "The aggregate number of mines placed
i was 1,535, in the principal harbors, from
Maine to California."
Reterring to "tiie fficult rnd important
character" of the work performed by the
fcignal corps, the president says:
"This service was invaluable to the ex
ecutive in directing the operations of the
army and navy. With a total force of
'over 1,300, the loss was by disease, in
camp and field, officers and men included,
only five."
I As to the authorized loan of $200,000,000,
.which was taken entirely by small bid
ders, the president says:
"This was a most encouraging and sig
nificant result, showing the vast resources
.of the nation and the determination of the
|people to uphold their country's honor."
It is not within the province of this
,tnessage to narrate the history of the ex
traordinary war that followed the Spanish
{declaration of April 21st, but a briefi re
cital of its more eaHent features is ap
propriate. The first encounter of the war
in point ol date took place April 27th,
when a detachment of the blockading
squadron made a reconnoissance in force
at Matanzas. shelled the harbor forts and
demolished several new works in con
struction.
The next engagement was destined to
mark a memorable epoch In maritime war
fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore
George Dowey had lain for some weeks at
Hong Kong. Upon the colonial prcclama
tion of neutrality being issued and the
customary twenty-four hours' notice be
ing giv? i repaired Mirs Bay, near
S?.nF

American forces entered Manila bay, and

the total destruction of the Spanish ffeet

port, besides capturing the naval station
and forts* at Cavite. thus annihilating the
^Spanish naval power in the Pacific ocean.
and completely controlling the Ray of
Manila, with the ability to take the city
at will. Not a life was lost on our ships
the wounded only numbering seven, while
not a vessel was materially injured. For
this gallant achievement congress upon
my recommendation fitly bestowed upon
the actors preferment and substantial
recognition.
The result of this remarkable victory
upon the spirit of our people and upon
the fortunes of the war was Instantan
eous. A prestige of invincibility therebv
I attached to our arms, which continued
throughout the struggle. Reinforcements

ed. The information was received on the
15th day of May and the first army ex
pedition sailed May 25 and arrived off
Manila June 30. Other expeditions soon
followed the total force, consisting of 641
officers and 25,058 men.
Only reluctance to cause needless loss
of life and property prevented the early
storming and capture of the city,- and
therewith the absolute military occupancy
of the whole group. The insurgents,
meanwhile, had resumed active hostilities
juspenaed by the uncompleted truce of
December, 1897. Their forces invested
Manila from the northern and eastern
sides, but were constrained by Admiral
Dewey and Gen. Merritt from attempt
ing an assault. It was fitting that what
ever was done in the way of decisive
operations in that quarter should be ac
complished by the strong arm of the
United States aRone. Obeying the stern
precept of war, which enjoins the over
coming or the adversary and the extinc
tion of his power wherever assailable as
the speedy and sure means to win a
peace, divided victory was not permissi
ble, for no partition of the rights and re
sponsibilities attending the enrorcement
of a just and advantageous peace could
be thought of.
Operations Offl Cuba.
Following the comprehensive scheme of
general attack, powerful forces were as
sembled at various points on our coast to
invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile
naval demonstrations were made at sev
eral exposed points. On May 11, the
cruiser "Wilmington and torpedo boat
"Winslow were unsuccessful in an attempt
to silence the batteries at Cardenas
against Matanzas, Worth Bagley and
four seamen falling. These grevious
fatalities were strangely enough among
the very few which occurred during our
-naval operations in this extraordinary
conflict.
Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara
tions had been pushed with great vigor.
A powerful squadron, under Admiral
Cervera, which hed assembled at Cape
Verde islands before the outbreak of
hostilities, crossed the ocean, and by its
erratic movements in the Caribbean sea,
delayed our military operations while
baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a
time, fears were felt lest the Oregon and
Marietta., then nearing home, after their
lor voyage from San Francisco of over
15,000 miles, might be surprised by Ad
miral Cervera's fleet, but their fortunate
arrival dispelled these apprehensions and
lent much needed reinforcement. Not un
til Admiral Cervera took refuge in the
harbor of Santiago de Cuba, about May
9, was it practicable to plan a systematic
military attack upon the Antillean posses
sions of Spain.
Several demonstrations occured on the
coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico, in
preparation for the larger event. On May
13 whe North Atlartic squadron shelled
San Juan de Porto Rico.
On May 30 Commodore Schley's squad
ron bombarded the forts guarding the
mouth of Santiago harbor. Neither at
tack had any material result. It was evi
dent that well-ordered land operations
were indispensable to achieve a decided
advantage.
Hobson's Heroic Act.
The next act in the war thrilled not
only the hearts of our countrymen, but
the world, by its exceptional heroism. On
the night of June 7 Lieut. Hobson, aided
by seven devoted volunteers, blockaded
the narrow outlet-
from Santiago harbor
by sinking the collier MeTrimac in the
channel, under a fierce fire from the shore
batteries, escaping with their lives, as by
a miracle, but falling into 'the hands of*
the Spaniards. It is a most igratifying in
cident of the war that the bravery of this
little band of heroes was cordially appre
ciated by the Spaniards, who sent a flag
of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of
their safety and to compliment them upon
their daring act. They were subsequently
exchanged. July 7.
By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban
cable isolated the island. Thereafter the
invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On
June 10, under a heavy protecting fire, a
landing of 600 marines from the Oregon.
Marble-head and -Yankee was' effected in
Guantanamo bay, where it had been de
termined to establish a naval station.
This important and essential port was
taken from the enemy after severe fight
ing by the marines, who were the first or
ganized force of the United States to
land in Cuba.
The Santiago Campaign.
The position so won was held despite at
tempts to dislodge our forces. By June lti
additional forces were landed and. strong
ly intrenched. On June 22 the advance
of the invading army, under Maj. Gen.
Shafter, landed at Daiquiri, about fifteen
miles east of Santiago. This' was accom
plished under great difficulties but with
marvelous dispatch. On June 23 the move
ment against Santiago was begun'. On
June 24 the first serious engagement took
place, in which the First and Tenth cav
alry and the First United States volunteer
cavalry, Gen. Young's brigade of Gen.
Wheeler's division, participated, losing
heavily. By nightfall, however, ground
within five miles of Santiago was won.
The advantage was steadily increased.
Gin July 1 a severe battle took place, our
forces gaining the outworks of Santiago
on July 2 El Caney and San Juan were
taken after a desperate enarge and tne
investment of the city was completed.
The navy co-op Brated by sheding the town
and tho coast forts.
On the day following this brilliant
achievement of our land forces, July 3,
occurred the decisive naval battle of the
war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to
leave the harbor, was met by the Ameri
can squadron under command of Commo
dore Sampson. In less than three hours
all the Spanish ships were destroyed, the
two torpedo boats being sunk and the
Marie Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Viz
caya and Cristobol Colon driven ashore.
The Spanish admiral and over 1,300 men
were taken prisoners, while the enemy's
loss of life was deplorably large, some six
hundred perishing. On our side but one
man was killed, on the Brooklyn, and one
man seriously wounded. Although our
ships were repeatedly struck not one was
seriously injured.
"Where all so conspicuously distin
guished themselves, from the commanders
to the gunners and the unnamed heroes
in the boiler rooms,-each and all contrib
uting toward the achievement of this as
tounding victory, for which neither an
cient nor modern history affords a par
allel in the completeness of the event and
the marvelous disproportion of casualties,
it would be invidious to single out any
one for special honor."
In this connection the presidenti says:
"Nor can we be unmindful of the achiev
ments of our builders, mechanics, and
artisans for their part in the construction
of our war ships."
As to the success gained by the arms
Of United States in Cuba, the jresi
denLi\esays that the earnest and lasting
gratitude of the nation is unsparingly au.
"Nor should we alone remember the gal
lantry of the living the dead claim our
tears, and our losses by battle and disease
must cloud any exultation at the result
and teach us the awful cost of war, how
ever righteous the cause or signal the
VT*torv."
With the fall of Santiago, the occupa
tion of Porto Rico became the next stra
tegic necessity. Gen. Miles had previous
ly been assigned to organize an expedi
tion for that purpos?. Fortuna* e'y he was
already at Santiago, where he had ar
rived on the 11th of July with reinforce
ments for Gen. Shafter's army.
With these troops, consisting of 6,415 in
fantry and artillery, two companies of
engineers and one company of the signal
corps. Gen. Miles left Guantanamo on
July 21, having nine transports convoyed
by the fleet under Capt. Hlgginson with
the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie
Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, the two
latter carrying troops. The exDedition
landed at Guanica on July 25, which port
was entered with little opposition. Here
the fleet wa3 joined by the Annapolis and
the Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphri
trite went to San Juan and joined the
New Orleans, which was engaged in
blockading that port. The major general
commanding was, subsequently reinforced
by Gen. Schwan's brigade of the third
army corps and by Gen. Wilson with a
part of his corps, numbering in all 10,973
officers and men. On July 27 he entered
Ponce, ono of the most important porta
in the island, from which he thereafter
directed operations for the capture of the
island.
With tho exception of encounters with
the enemy at Guayama, Hormigueres,
Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a
force landed at Cape San Juan there was
no serious resistance. The campaign was
prosecuted with great vigor, and by the
12th of August most of the island was in
our possession, and the acquisition of the
remainder was only a matter of a short
time.
At most of the points in the island our
troops were enthusiasticaly welcomed.
Protestations of .loyalty to .the flag .and
gratitude for delivery from Spanish .rule
met our commanders at every point. As
a potent influence toward peace, the out-,
come of the Porto Rican expedition was
of great consequence and generous com
mendation is due to those who partici
pated in it.
The last scene of the war was enacted
at Manila, its starting place. On August
15, after a brief assault upon the works
by the land forces, in which the
squadron assisted, the capital surrendered
unconditionally. Tihe casualties were
comparatively few. By this conquest ,of
the Philippine islands, virtually accom
plished, when, the Spanish capacity for re
sistance was destroyed- by Admiral
Dewey's victory of the first of May, the
fate of the Islands was formally sealed.
To Gen. Merritt, his officers and men, for
their uncomplaining an devoted services
and for their gallantry in action, the na
tion is sincerely grateful. Their long voy
age was made with singular success and
the soldierly conduct^of the men, most of
whom were without previous'- experience
in the military service, deserves unmeas
ured praise.
The total casualties in killed and wound
ed in the army during the war with
tfpain were: Officers killed, 23 enlisted
men killed, 257 total, 280. Officers wound
ed, 113 enlisted men wounded, 1,464 to
tal, 1,577. Of the navy: Killed, 17 wound
ed, 67 died as result of wounds, 1 inval
ided from service, (5 total, 91.
"It will be observed that while our navy
was engaged in two great battles and in
numerous perilous undertakings in block
ade and bombardment, and more than
50,000 of our troops were transported to
distant lands and were engaged in assault
and siege and battle and many skir
mishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in
both arms of the service a total of 1.668
killed and wounded, and in the entire
campaign, by land and sea, we did not
lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a
ship, and with the exception of the crew
of the Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor
was taken Drisoner."
The president bears testimony and pays
fitting tribute "to the patriotism and de
votion of that large portion of our army,
which, although eager to be ordered to
the post of greatest exposure, fortunately
was not required outside of the United
States." They did their whole duty and
earned the gratitude of the nation. The
president then says:
"In tracing those events we are con
stantly reminded of our obligations to
the Divine Master for his watchful care
oyer us, and his safe guidance, for which
the nation makes reverent acknowledg
ment and offers humble prayer for the
continuance of his favors."
The peace negotiations which followed
soon after the capitulation of Santiago,
and the preparation and signing of tho
protocol are discussed at length. Refer
ring to the work of the peace commission
ers in Paris the president says:
"These negotiations have made hopeful
progress, so that I trust soon to be able to
lay a definite treaty before the senate,
with a review of the steps leading to its
signature."
Our New Possessions, Vc
"I do not discuss at this time the gov
ernment or tenure of the new possessions
which will come to us ?s the result of
the war with Spain. Such discussion will
be appropriate after the treaty of peace
shall be ratified. In the meantime and un
til the congress has legislated otherwise,
it will be my duty to continue the mil
itary governments which have existed
since our occupation, and give to the peo
ple security in life and property, and en
couragement under a just and beneficient
rule.
"As soon as we-are in possession of
Cuba and have pacified the island it will,
be necessary to give aid and direction to
its people to form a government for
themselves. This should be undertaken
at the earliest moment consistent with
safety, and assured success. It is im
portant that our relations with this peo
ple, should be of the most friendly char
acter, and our commercial relations close
and reciprocal. It should be our duty to
assist in every proper way to build up the
waste places of the island, encourage the
industry of the people and assist them to
form a government which shall be free
and independent, thus realizing the best
aspirations of the Cuban people.
"Spanish rule must be replaced bv a
Dust, benevolent and humane government,
created by the people of Cuba, capable of
performing all international obligations
and which shall encourage thrift, industry
and prosperity, and promote Deace and
gocd will among all of the inhabitants,
whatever may have been their relations in
the past. Neither revenge nor passion
should have a place in the new govern
ment. Until there is complete tranquillity
in the island and a stable government
erected, military occupation will be con-
tinued.'.'
The president says that with the one
instance of the interruption of intercourse
with Spain, the relations of the United
States with the family of nations during
the past year has been characterized by
cordiality. Concerning negotiations with
the Argentina .government with a view
to removing differences in cable rate
charges imposed against messages passing
from and to fae United States, the presi
dent expresses his sincere hope of an
international agree.nent whereby inter
change of messages over connecting lines
may be regulated on\a fair basis of uni
formity, and adds:
"it would be strange were the nations
not in time brought to realize that mod
ern civilization, which owes so much of
its progress to the annihilation of time by
the electrical force demands that this all
important means of communication be a
heritage of peoples, to be administered and
regulated in their common behalf."
Referring to the killing and wounding
of striking miners in Luzerne county,
Pa., which aroused the solicitude of the
Austro-Hungarian government, many of
the miners being subjects of that govern
ment, the president expects. to reach a
harmonious understanding on the subject
with Austro-Hungary.
Tha hope is expressed that the restric
tions imposed by Belgium on the importa
tion of American cattle will at an early
day be relaxed, so as to admit live Amer
ican cattle under proper regulations.
Nicaragnan Canal.
The Niearaguan caraal connmission, un
der the championship of Rear Admiral
John G. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897,
under the authority of a prevision in the
sur.-dry civil service act of July 4 of that
year has nearly completed its labors, and
the results of its exhaustive- inquiry into
the proper route, the feasibility and the
cost of construction of an interoceaadc
canal by a Niearaguan route will be laid
before you. In the performance of its
task the commission received all possible
courtesy and assistance from the govern
ments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica,
which thus testified their appreciation of
the importance of giving a speedy and
practical outcome to the great project
that has for so many years engrossed'the
attention of the respective countries.
As the scope of recent inquiry embraced
the whole soibject, with the aim of mak
ing plans ard surveys- for a canal by the
ost convenient route, it necessarily in
cluded a review of the results of previous
surveys and plans, and particularly those
adopted by the Maritime Canal company,
under its existing concessions from Nic
aragua and Costa Rica, so that, to this
extent, these grants necessarily held an
essential part in the deliberations' and
conclusions of the canal commission, as
.they have held, and must neede hoSd, in
the discussion of the matter by congress.
Under these circumstances, and in view
of overtures mad by the governments of
Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other par
ties for a new canal concession, predicat
ed on the presumed anproacbir.t lapse of
contracts of the Maratime Canal cbm- the
pany with those states, I have not hesi
tated to express my conviction that con
siderations of expediency and internation
al policy as between the several aovern
ments interested in the construction and
control of an interoceanic canal by this
route, require the maintenance of the
statu quo until this cacal commission
shall have reported and the United States
congress shall have had the opportunity
to pass finally upon the whole matter
during the present session without preju
dice by reason of any change in the ex
isting conditions.
Nevertheless, it appears that the v
ernment of Nicaragua, as one of its last
sovereign acts before merging its powers
those of the newly formed United
States of Central America, has granted an
optional concession to another associa
tion, to become effective on the expiration
of the present grant. It does not appear
what surveys nave been made or what
route is proposed under this contingent
grant, so that an examination of the
ieasioility of its plans is necessarily not
embraced in the report of the canal com
mission. All those circumstances suggest
the urgency of some definite action by
the congress at this session, if the labors
of the past are to be utilized, and the
linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans
by a practical waterway is to be realized.
That the construction of such a mari
time highway is now more than ever, in
dispensable' to that intimate and ready
inter-communication between our eastern
and western seaboards, is demanded by
the annexation of the Hawaiian islands
and the prospective expansion of our in
fluences,and, commerce to the Pacific, and
that our national policy now more im
peratively than ever calls for its control
by this government are propositions
which, I doubt not, the congress will duly
appreciate and wisely act upon.
Concerning the extraordinary events
transpiring in the Chinese empire, the
president says that our position among
nations gives the equitable c.'aim to con
sideration and friendly treatment in this
rttaru, ana that it will be his aim to
subserve our large interests in the Orient
by all means appropriate to the constant
policy of our government.
Reference is made to several claims of
citizens of the United States pending
against other nations, and to the settle
ment of other claims during tne past
year.
After reviewing the work of the Paris
exposition commissioner, the preseident
recommends that an appropriation for the
exhibit of the United States at the Paris
exposition be increased to $1,000,000.
Relations -with Great Britain.
Our relations with Great Britain have
continued on the most friendly footing.
Assenting to our request the protection
of Americans and their interests in bijan
ish jurisdiction wats assumed uy the diplo
matic and consular t.pi ese.-taaves vf
ureat Britain, who fulnhea tneir delicate
and arduous trust \vita tact and zeal
eliciting high commendation. I may he
allowed to make iitdng aaus^on to the
instance of Mr. Ramsaen, her majesty's
consul at Santiago ae uuba, wnose un
timely deatn, arter distipguished service
and untiring effort during tne siege of
that city, vvas sincerely lamented.
In the early part of "April'last, pursuant
to the request made at tne instance of tne
secretary, of state by the isntish embas
sador at this capital, the Canadian gov
ernment granted tacilities for the passage
of four United States revenue cutters
from the great lakes to the Atlantic coast
by way or the Canadian canal and the Bt.
Lawrence river. The vessels had reached
Lak Onto.rio and were theie awaiting
the opening of navigation when war was
declared between tne United States and
Spaip. Her majesty's government, there
upon, by a communication of. the latter
part of April, stated that the permission
granted betorc the outbreak of hostilities
would not be withdrawn, provided the
United States gave assurance mat the
vessels in question would proceed direct
to a United States port witnout engaging
in any hostile operation. This government
promptly agreed to the stipulated con
dition, it being understood that the ves
sels would not be prohibited from resist
ing any nostile attack.
It will give me especial satisfaction if I
shall be authorized to communicate to
you a favorable conclusion of the pending
negotiations with Great Britain in respecc
to the Dominion of Canada. It is the ear
nest wisn of this government to remove
all sources of discord and irritation in our
relations with the neighboring ddminioii.
The trade between the two countries is
constantly increasing, and it is important
to both countries that all reasonable fa
cilities should be granted for its develop
ment.
Pending the consideration by the senate
of the treaty signed June 16, 1897, by the
plenipotentiaries of the United States and
of the Republic of Hawaii, providing for
the annexation of the islands, a joint reso
lution to accomplish the same purpose
by the accepting the offered cession and
incorporating the ceded territory into the
Union was adopted by the congress and
approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon direct*
ed the United States steamer Philadelphia
to convey Rear Admiral Miller to Hono
lulu, and entrusted to his hands this im
portant legislative act, to be delivered to
the president of the Republic of Hawaii,
with whom the admiral and the' United
States minister were authorised to make
appropriate arrangements for transfer
ring the sovereignty of the islands to the
United States. This was srimple, but im
pressively acocmplished on the 12th day
of August last, by the delivery of a cer
tified copy of the resolution to President
Dole, who thereupon yielded up to the
representative of the government of the
United States the sovereignty and public
property of the Hawaiian islands.
Pursuant to the term of the joint reso
lution, and in exercise of the authority
thereby conferred upon me, I directed
that the civil, judicial and militarv pow
ers theretofore exercised by the offi
ers of the government of the Republic of
Hawaii should continue to be exercised
by those officers until congress shall pro
vide a government for the incorporated
territory subject to my power to remove
such officers and to fill vacancies. The
president, officers and troops of the re
public thereupon took the oath of alle
giance to the United States, thus providing
for the uninterrupted continuance of all
the administrative and municipal func
tions of the annexted territory until con
gress shall otherwise act.
Following the further provision of the
joint resolution, I appointed the Honor
ables Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois John
T. Morgan of Alabama Robert R. Hitt,
of Illinois Sanford B. Dole, of Hawaii,
and Walter F. Grear, of Hawaii, as com
missioners to confer and recommend to
congress such legislation concerning the
Hawaiian islands as they should deem
proper. The commisslontirs haying ful
filled their mission confided to them,
their report will be laid before you
at an early day. It is believed that their
recommendations will have the earnest
consideration due to the magnitude of the
responsibility resting upon you to give
such shape to the relationship of those
mid-Pacific lands to our home Union as
Will benefit both in the highest degree,
realizing the aspirations of the communi
ty that has cast its lot with us, and elect
ed to share our political heritage while,
at the same time, justifying the foresight
of those who for three-quarters of a cen
tury have looked to the' assimilation of
Hawaii as a natural and inevitable con
summation, in harmony with our needs,
and in fulfillment of our cherished tradi
tions.
?vf'- Czar's Peace Proclamation.
His majesty the czar, having announced
his purpose to raise the imperial Russian
mission at this capital to the rank of an
embassy, I responded under the authority
conferred by the act of March 3,/1893, by
commissioning and accrediting the actual
rspresentecive at St. Petersburg h. the
capacity of ambassador extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary. The Russian
embassador to this country has since
presented his credentials.
The proposal of the czar for a. general
reduction of the vast military establish
ments tnr.t. weigh so heavily upoa many
people in time of ace was e:mmtia:eatei
to this government with an earnest invi
tation to be represented in the conference
which it is contemplated to assemble with
a view to discussing the means of accom
plishing so desirable a result. His maj
estj' was at once informed of the cordial
syrrpathy of this government with prin
ciple Involved in his exalted proposal and
of the readiness of the Un ted States to
take: part in the conference. The active
miltarv force of the United States as
measured by our population, territorial
area and taxable wealth is and under
prospective conditions must continue to
be, in time of peace, so conspicuously less
than that of. the armed powers to whom
the czar's appeal is especially addressed
that the Question can have for us no
practical importance save as marking an
auspicious step toward the betterment of
the condition of the modern peoples and
the cultivation of peace and ^rood will
among them but in this view it behooves
us as a nation to lend countenance and
aid to the beneficent project.
The claims of owners of American seal
ing vessels for seizure by Russian cruisers
In Bering sea are. being pressed to a set
tlement. The equities of the cases justify
the expectation that a measure of repara
tion will eventually be accorded in har
mony with percedent and in the light of
the proven facts.
The president says that the newly ac-
credited envoy of the TJ-BSIBS. Slates to
the Ottoman porte carries instructions
looking to the disposal of matters in con
troversy with Turkey for a number of
years.
I have the satisfaction of being able^to
state that the bureau of the American re
publics, created in 190, as the orfgan for
promoting commercial intercourse and
fraternal relations among the countries of
the Western hemisphere, has become a
most efficient instrument of the wise pur
pose of its founders, and is receiving tho
cordial support of the countries of the in
ternational union which are actually rep
resented in its board of management. A
commercial directory in two volumes, con
taining a mass of statistical matter de
scriptive of industrial and commercial ihi
terests of the various countries, has been
printed in English, Spanish, Portuguese
and French, and a monthly bulletin pub
Ijshed in these four languages and dis
tributed in the Latin-American coun
tries sa well as in the United States,
has proved to be a valuable medium for
disseminating information and furthering
the varied interests of the international
union.
Alluding to the financial affairs of the
country, the president says in part:
"The secretary of the treasury reports
that the receipts of the government from
all sources during the fiscal vea'r ended
June 30, 1888. including 564,751,223 re
ceived from sale of Pacific railroads,
anounted to S405.321.33y and its ex
penditures to 5443,368,582.
"It Is estimated upon the basis of pres
ent revenue laws, that the receipts of the
government for the year ending June 30.
1899, will be $577,874,647 and its expendi
tures $684,874,647, resulting in a deficiency
of $112,000,000.
^vS 4 Currency Legislation.
^'-i "In iny judgment, the present condition
of the treasury amply justifies the imme
diate enactment of the legislation recom
mended one year ago, under which a por
tion of th gold holdings should be place ruse
a
fund from which greenbackd
should redeemed upon presentation,
D2J whebeence redeemed should not there
after be paid out except for gold.
"It is not to be inferred that other legis
lation relating to our currency is not re
quired on the contrary, there is an obvi
ous demand for it."
The importance of adequate provision,
which will insure to our future a money
standard related as our money standard
now is to that of our commercial rivals, is
generally recognized.
The companion proposition that our do
mestic paper currency should be kept
safe, and yet be so related to the needs of
our industries and international com
merce as to. be adequate and responsive
to such needs, is a proposition scarcely
less important. The subject in all its
parts is recommended to the wise consid
eration of the congress-.
The president says that in view of the
recent acquisition of territory by the
United States, there should be established
regular and frequent steamship com
munication, under the American flag with
the newly acquired islands.
In view, also, of the increased impor
tancce of the proposea formation of a com
mission of sanitary experts to investigate
the yellow fever problem, owing to the
military occupation of Cuba, the presi
dent recommends that congress should
provide for such commission.
'":/The
Anaen^'..'-
Under ths act of congress approved!
April 26, 1898, and authorizing the presi
dent in his discretion, upon a declaration
of war by congress or a declaration by
congress that war exists, I directed the
increase of the regular army to the max
imum of 62,000 authorized to said act.
There are now in the regular army
57,862 officers and men. In said act it
was provided "that at the end of any
war in which the United States may be
come involved the army shall be reduced
to a peace basis by the transfer in the
same arm of the service or absorption by
promotion or honorable discharge under
such regulations as the secretary of war
may establish of supernumerary commis
sioned officers and the honorable dis
charge or transfer of supernumerary en
listed men, and nothing contained in this
act shall be construed as authorizing the
permanent increase of the commissioned
or enlisted force of the regular army be
yond that now provided by the law in
force prior to the passage of this act ex
cept as to the ir-crease of twenty-five
majors provided for in section 1 thereof."
The importance of legislation for the
permanent increase of the army is there
fore manifest and the recommendation of
the secretary of war for that purpose has
my unqualified approval. There' can be
no question that at this time and probably
for some time in the future, one hundred:
thousand men will be none too many to
meet the necessities of the situation. At
all events whether that number shall be
required permanently or not the power
should be given to the president to enlist
that force if in his discretion it shall be
necessary and the further discretion
should be given him to- recruit within the
i above limit from the inhabitants of the
islands with the government of which we
are charged.
It is my purpose to muster out tho en
tire volunteer army as soon as the con
gress shall provide for the increase of the
regular establishment. This will be ohlx
an act of justice and will be much ap
preciated by the brave iren who left their
homes and employments tolelp the coun
try in its emergency.
The following recommendations of the
secretary of the navy, relative to the in
crease of iihe navy, have my earnest ap
proval:
FirstThree sea-going sheathed and cop
pered battleships of about 13,500 tons
trial displacement, carrying the heaviest
armor and most powerful ordnance for
vessels of their class and to have the
highest practicable speed and greatest
radius of action. Estimated cost, exclu
sive of armor and: armament, $3,t500,OOU
each.
SecondThree sheathed and coppered
armored cruisers of" about 12,000 tons Trial
displacement, carrying the heaviest armor
and most powerful ordnance for vessel*
of their class, and to have the highest
practicable speed and greatest radius or
action. Estimated cost, exclusive of ar
mor and armament, $4,000,000 each.
ThirdThree sheathed and coppered pror
tected cruisers of about 6,000 tons trial
displacement^ to have the highest practic
able speed and great radius of action, and'
to carry the most powerful ordnance suit
able for vessels of their class. Estimated
cost, exclusive of armor and armament,
$2,150,000 each.
FourthSix sheathed and coppered
cruisers of about 2,500 tons trial displace
ment to have the highest speed compati
ble with good cruising qualities, great
radius of action and to carry the most
powerful ordnance suited to vessels ot
their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of
armament. 1,140,800 each.
I join with the secretary of the- navy
in recommending that the grades of ad-?
miral and vice admiral be temnorarily
revived to be filled with officers who have
especially distinguished' themselves in the
war with Spain.
The special attention of the congress is
called to that part ot the report of the
secretary of the interior in- relation to the
five civilized Indian tribes. It is note
worthy that the general condition of the
Indian shows marked progress. But one
outbreak of a serious- character occurred
during the year, and that among the Chip
pewa Indians of Minnesota, which happily
has been supressed.
While it has not yet been practicable to
enforce all the provisions of the act of
June 28, 1898, "for the protection of the
people of the Indian Territory and for
other purposes," it is having a salutary
effect upon the nations composing the five
tribes. The Dawes commiission reports
that the most gratifying results and great
er advance toward the attainment Of the
ejects of the government have been se
cured im the past year than in any previ
ous year.
I cannot too strongly indorse the ree
omm-end*ations of the commission and of
the secretary of the interior for the neces
sity of providing for the education of the
30,000.white children resldrt in the In
dian Territory. iPPiiplIP
',.Publte Lands..
The pvblie lands disposed of by tne gov
ernment du*ing the year reached 8,453^.-
896.92- acres, ah Increase of 614,780.96 acres
over the.previous year. The total receipts
amounted to $2,2T7i995.18, an Increase of
,$190,063.90 over the preceding year. The
lands embraced in the eleven forest res
ervations, which were suspended by the
act of June 4, 1897, again become subject
to the operations of the proclamations
of Feb. 22, 1887, creating them, which
added an estimated amount of 19,951,360
acres to the area embraced in the reserves
previously created. In. addition thereto
two new, reserves were created during the.
TUT, tho PmW HwmtaJa nfl Sfiwea lacks*
reserve, to California, embndbag VU*JSi
acres, and the Presoott reserve, 1a
Arizona, embracing 10,220 acres, while tho
Pecos River reserve In New Mexico has
been changed and enlarged to include 120,-
000 additional acres.
At the close of the year thirty .forest
reservations, not including those of the
Afogonac forests and the fish culture
reservation in Alaska, have been created
by proclamation under section 34 of the
act of March 3, 1891, embracing an esti
mated area of 40,719,474 acres.
The department of the interior has in*'
augurated a forest system, made possible
by the act of July, 1898, for a graded
force of officers in control of the reserves.
This system has only been In full opera
tion since August, but good results have
already been secured in many sections.
The reports received indicate that the
system of patrol has not only prevented
destructive fires from, gaining headway,
but has diminished the number of fires. ,-v
Promoting Agriculture. fjgk 'tx
The department of agriculture has been3^
active in the past year. Explorers have
bean sent to many of the countries of the
Eastern and Western hemispheres for
seeds and plants that may be useful to
the United States, amd with the further
view of opening up markets for our sur
plus products. The forestry division of
the department is giving special attention
to the treeless regions of our country, and
4s introducing species- especially adapted
to semi-arid regions. Forest fires, wuich
seriously interfere with production, es
pecially in irrigated, regions- are bems
studied that the losses from this cause
may be avoided. The department la in
quiring into the use and abuse,of-water in
many states of the West and collecting
information regarding the laws of th
bates, the decisions of the courts and the
customs' of the -people in this regard so
that uniformity may be secured.
Experimental stations are becoming
more valuable every year. The appropria
tion of $702,000 by congress is surpple
mented by $400,000 from the stations.
Nation wide experimente have been con
ducted to* ascertain the suitableness as to
soil and climate and states for growing
sugar beets. The number of beet sugar
factories- has been doubled in the past two
years, and the ability of the United
States to produce its own sugar from, this.
source has been clearly demonstrated. Is
The weather bureau forecast and ob- -?1
eervation stations have been extended
around the Caribbean sea to give early
warning of the approach of hurricanes
from tho south seas to our fleets and mer^
chant marine.
I earnestly urge upon congress- the im
portance of early legislation providing for
the taking of the twelfth census. JJhis
is necessary in view of the large amount
of work which must be performed in the
preparation of the schedules preparatory
to the enumeration of the population*
Pensions.
There were- on the pension rolls on June
30, 1898, 993,714 names, an increase of
nearly 18,000 over the number on the rolls
on the same day of the preceding year.
The amount of the appropriation by act
of Dec. 22. 1896, for the payment of pen
sions forth fiscal year 1898 was $140,000,-
000. Eight million seventy thousand eight
hundred and seventy-two dollars and
forty-six cents was appropriated by the
act of March 3, 1898, to cover deficiencies
In army pensions, and repayment in the
sum of $12,020.33, making a total of $148,-
082,892.79 available for the payment of
pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The
amount disbursed from that sum was
$144,651,879.80, leaving a balance of $3,431,-
012.99 unexpended on the 30th of June,
1898, which was covered into the treasury.
There were 389 names added to the rolls
during the year by special acts passed at
the second session of the fifty-fifth con
gress, making a total of 6,486 pensions by
congressional enactments since 1861.
TE*e several documentary reports will be
laid beforo you. They give in great detail
the conduct of the affairs of tn.e govern
ment during the past year and discuss
many questions upon which the congress
may be called upon to act.
BEARS AS SLY AS FOXES.
THey Tnrow Lumps Ice- a Wal
ruses to Stun and Capture- Them.
London Telegraph: I his native ho me
the polar bear dors not often meet with
small boys anxious to treat him to-buns
and other dainties. Th consequence is
that Bruin has to devise many curious
ways- of securing his food, and none are
more strange and interesting than that
related by two trustworthy travelers in
Greenland, that country of strange sights.
They have known the polar bear to take
a stone or a huge lump of ice in his
fore paws and from a favorable height,
as a Gliff or a precipitous ice hill, to
hurl the- missile down upon the head of
a walrusan enormouse brute, often
twice the size of a bearand so stun him
that Bruin, could rush in and complete
the destruction at his leisure, thus secur
ing a month's rations.
The most useful food of the- ice beaiy i
as- the Germans very appropriately call'
this beast, is the common seal of the
arctic regions. Th latter i the wariest
animal of the north, and both Eskimo
and polar bear need their besfc strategy
toi catch, it.
In. th summer time, when the snow is
off the ice of the ocean shore and Islets,
the seals can be plainly seen- as black:
dots on the ice, probably, asleep, but
always- near thair holes, which lead down
through the thick ice to the water below,
and into which they can throw them-^
selves by the least movement. Bryin,
seeing one afar, walks up as- near as he
deems safe, and then begins- crawling:
on his- -wary prey.
The seal, if the weather be- sunny and
pleasant, takes short naps- relieved by
shorter moments when*it is scanning the
vicinitiy .fon.signs r-f an enemy's-approach.
During these times the bear is- very quiet
and as still as death itself, with eyes ap
parently closed, though really a corner, of
each is- kept open, and in this way he
hopes the seal will take him for a heap
of snow,, an appearance which his coat
readily helps him to assume.
Duri ng the naps he creeps forward with
greater or less rapidity, acGonding to his
nearness to the seal and consequent fear
of being heard or seen. When butte
or twelve yards away, and the seal is in
the depths of a good nap, the bear rushes
upon him, and with a single blow of his
powerful paw knocks the--smaller brute
senseless and so far away from the hole
that he cannot escape by thai way, even
if the blow received is not immediately A
fatal.
In winter time the"ice is= cowered with""
snow,, and' this is hollowed1
out by the seal
into- a snow house, covering the hole in,,
the ice- and:
connecting at the top: of th
dome with air aperture about the siae of a
shilling, called the blow hoiie,. for it is
through this that the seal breathes when
he te in want of fresh air. r/(5
Here-the bear watches for-many a long?/
hour,, iif necessary, and when the snorts of
the seal axe heard he crushes* in the frag-.
ile dome-of the snow house- with his paw,
fenpaHns the seal on his curved claws,/^
and proceeds to practically demonstrate"
how polar bears can subsist in an arctic:*,
winter.-
