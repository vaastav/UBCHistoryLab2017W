A LAMENT FROM HARRISON.
The time and conditions have arrived
when Harrison county should have
at,least three delegates In the House
of Delegates. Marlon county has
three and the population of Harrison
county, to say'nothing of her activities
and wealth, Is at least equal to
that of Marlon county. This matter
should he attended to by the next legislature.
Clve Harrison -county her
Just dues. From the party standpoint,
as to the Republicans, Harrison
county soars far above Marion, as the
accredited list of delegates to the
various conventions shows. The Republican
party Is In the ascendency
in the legislature and it is the duty
of the lntler body to see to it thai
Harrison county is given proper and
just representation In the legislative
body. Incidentally, the State admin
Istratlon ought also to see that Harrison
county has her just quota In the
State government.?Clarksburg Telo- I
gram. t
Unfortunately for the position of the J
Telegram, the membership In the
House of Delegates Is not based on '
the Republican majority in a county I
but on its population. According to <
the census of 1!)0ft, upon which the 1
basis of representation rests, Marlon 1
county had 32,430 people while there 1
were only 27.080 In Harrison. Just 1
how the Legislature could give Harri- t
son any larger population than thC|l
United States census accredits It with|'
is not clear to us Just now, but If il '
can be done there is no county in,the '
Stale we would rather see pushed tip :
a little than our neighbor up the West I
Fork. But Marlon can outvote Harrison
as well as count more people. In
1004 the combined voto of Roosevelt
and Parker In Marion was 8,537, while
Harrison polled only 7,084. Carrying
the comparison to 1000 we find Marlon
still ahead, the combined vote for
Hubbard and Riley for Congress being
5,017 In Marlon as against 5,675 In
Harrison. But Harrison Is all right
and entitled to everything it can get
and there is no kick from Marlon.
We'll soon bo very close neighbors
and expect to be good friends.
That "orchard story" in the Times
tills morning was a "peach." It was
real pood as far as It went, being word
for word as the West Virginian published
it last Thursday. It was really
all good enough for reproduction, hut
that seemed n little loo much for our
neighbor, we suppose.
And now some of the Apaches also
want to go on the warpath. There is
beginning to be serious doubts, about,
the supply of warpaths being equal to
the demand.

The chances are, however, that

some of its members may not feel the

know this Is their last term of service,

fall down at the close of their congressional
career and will In all probability
be found at their post of duty

reaches Congress, the country
will be made aware of what these
things are. The people arc greatly interested

for the betterment of conditions along
many lines and they look to Congress
for relief. We are fortunate in having
strong leaders and to them we look
for great accomplishments. Those
who think there will not be much do.

guess coming, according to our
way of thinking.
"Mr. Hearst stands ready at all

the last say. however, and there may

There was only one arerst made In
