THOUSANDS of American citizens
where given the marble heart by
means of President McKinley's
message to congress this week and
will now realize how little was in
the ante-election glad hand.
Ex-GOVERNOR CHURCH died
Thanksgiving Cay at Juneau
Alaska. He was governor of Da
kota during the territorial days,
receiving his appointment during
Cleveland's first administration.
IT is quite generally .rumored
that the St. John branch of the
Gt. Northern will be extened next
summer to Brandon, Man. This
would undoubtly mean daily pas

business blocks of Langdon town
nicely. The C-D is giving the
Langdon people a fine paper.—

FARMERS in the south end of the
county are in many cases drop
ping grain for stock with encour
aging results. This is setting the
men of Milton thinking and it is
likely that J. B. Beauchamp's
cheese factory will be moved from
Olga to that town.
LIVE stoci statistics of North
Dakota shows au aggregate of
217,263 horses, 3S65 mules 270,
193 cattle, 297,271 sheep, and 88,
150 hogs. These figures compared
with last year show a wonderful
increase in cattle and hogs, but a
slight falling off in horses and
sheep.
JUDGE SAUTER was called to
Bismarck last week to try the
criminal libel suits brought
against Editor Moffat, of the
Settler. Change of venue was
taken to Morton county, it being
found impossible to secure an un
prejudiced jury in Burleigh
county' The cases will be called
at the April term.
No TROUBLE to get state office in
North Dakota under a republican
administration. Any old thing
goes. Look at Joe Devine, elected
lieutenant governor and for nearly
six months has pursued the un
disturbed even tenor of his way
studying law at Ann Arbor,
Michigan. "What a dog in the
manger outfit the whole gang is
anyway.
UNDOUBTEDLY the effort will be
made at the coming session of con
gress to enact currency legislation
that will be satisfactory to Wall
street. This will mean the calling
in of the treasury and Sherman
notes, leaving national bank notes
as our only currency and probably
placing the burden of their re
demption upon the government.
Of course it is their plan (the
goldbugs) to contract the volume
of currency with a consequent
further reduction of prices as a
result. Farmers do you think
this republican financial plan will
give give you even the present
prices of your products? The
gold crowd will attempt to face the
measure at the coming session, for
they, rightly, are afraid that the
complexion ot the next congress
will be too white and not yellow
enough to suit their purpose
'k They evidently believe that it is
good policy to "Make bay while

'ONLY SCORCHED.
THE personal organ of congress
man Dingley, whose name is
attached to the revenue deficit
tariff law, remarks, after surveying
the results of the last election, that
the silver question was "only
scorched, not settled, that the con
gressional campaigns of next year
will be fought out on the line of
1896.
This statement is the result of
the out come of the recent elec
tions, in which Kentucky and
Nebraska showed how they would
vote next year and the year after.
Mr. Dingley's personal organ
seems to think that Nebraska
should see in the rise in wheat a
"refutation of the Bryan theory
that wheat and silver are linked
together by the Almighty." Of
course Mr. Bryau has no such
theory as that, and the men have
uever advanced any such argument.
What they did and do say is that
owing to the fact that the silver
using nations compete with our
wheat growers in the world's
markets, the prices of wheat and
silver, under ordinary conditions,
rise or fall together. That has
been demonstrated by the statistics
of twenty-odd years, a ad is today
confirmed by the fact that wheat
rises in price when there is no
competition from silver-using
nations. These countries have
had no wheat for export this year,
and, consequently, the price has
risen.
Nebraska also sees what every
body else must see—that the in
crease in the price of wheat is
simply the depieciation of the
dollar with respect to that cereal.
So far as wheat is concerned., the
dollar has lost nearly half of its
purchasing power, so that all the
good that has been accomplished
by the rise is the result of a sinful
and an immoral 50-cent dollar.
With respect to "scorching" and
"burning," we think Mr. Dingley's
organ makes a full, though per
haps unintentional admission that
the republican party was some
what scorched in the recent elec
tions. Next year it will be still
more thoroughly scorned, and in
1900 it will b9 badly burned.
That seems to be the outlook
now. But we think Mr. Dingley's
organ would help its party some
what if it could convince the peo
ple that the Dingley law is pro
ducing revenue instead of creating
a deficit. The figures show that
the excess of expenditures over
receipts are $45,500,(00 this year
as compared with $20,090,000 in
1895. Is this the result that Mr.
Dingley intended to produce?
ONE of the members of McKin
ley's executive cabinet, Hon.
Lyman J. Gage, who is secretary
of the treasury and owns a big
national bank in Chicago, is at
loggerheads with the president on
the finance question. His latest
move, evidently mtde in accord
with expressed views of his brother
bankers of Wall and Lombard
streets is to retire the greenbacks
and issue gold bearing bonds for
them, turning the bonds over to
the national banks and have them
issue their promises to pay in
place of the government's promise
to pay. McKinley knows as well
as all other quiet thinking men
that the frantic clamoring of the.
gold-bugs is without avail. That
we are not doing business on a
gold-basis and furthermore are
unable to because we haven't the
gold to do it with. Both "Mac"
and the people are "onto" the
three card monte game that
retary Gage would like to
in.

Sec-
"ring
THERE is an experiment in
wheat growing that used to be
talked of more or less among the
early settlers, though we are not
aware that it was ever fairly put
to the test. It is the eowing of
spring wheat in the fall. Many of
the old settlers had a notion that
fall sowing, to a limited extent,
might work to advantage, in the
way of earlier maturity and heavier
yield. It is well known that the
climatic conditions offers no objec
tioii,» «rwrjr Jtabkfo field tasrs
evidence that the seed will with
stand the frosts of winter. The
idea is not to grow fall wheat, but
merely to have the seed in the
ground, ready to start with the
first breath of growing weather in
the spring: It may be that the
proposition would not work out
satisfactory but, on the other
hand it might. At any rate, it
would be a small matter to make a
few tests when the season comes
again.
OUR EXCHANGES.
The cigars are on "Cush" since
the date line of last week's Re
publican read "Thursday, Decem
ber 25th, 1897."
McCarthy is likely to follow in
the footsteps of Editor Buck, of
Park River, if the reports circu
lated by his Milton friends can be
considered reliable.
Fred Hendershott, one of the
first editors of the Commonwealth,
a relict of fusion journalism in
Fargo, has lately re-engaged in
newspaper work down in Illinois.
May success attend him.
Kent's paper, the Lakota Herald
promises to dish up another lot of
"red hots," the result of further in
vestigations lately made regarding
the situation of "things" at
Bismarck.

The time-worn county seat
question is already being poked
out of its corner by Frawley, the
Chronicle man, who is bound to
have the voters move the official
business of Pembina county over
to Cavalier next fall.
Our erratic friend, EditorS. F.
Mercer, of the Larimore Leader,
is after au anonymous letter
writer to the Grand Forks Herald,
who dubs Larimore as a second
Bismarck for lawlessness. His
defense is able and patriotic.
Twelve pages twice a week is
the handsome style in which Lee's
Mountaineer looms up during the
holiday season. All the pages are
adorned with neat advertisements
of the many thrifty business firms
of the mountain metropolis at
W alhalla.
With the completion of the le
gal publication of the Pembina
county tax list naturally follows
the suspension of the daily Pioneer
Express, as Editor Ward well says
"to protect our business interests."
Eight weeks and a day is the sum
total of its existence.
Tuttle, the fire-eater of the Man
dan Pioneer, has at last found out
that it is impossible for one lone
newspaper man to run the whole
universe—the supreme court in
cluded, and has taken a partner
into the firm. Tuttle promises to
keep the Pioneer as lively as
heretofore.
The all-wool and a-yard-wide
newspaper yarns that many of the
esteemed contemporaries of the
Grand Forks Hearld are giving
space to every week would fill a
good-sized scrapbook. Brother
Winship says he's a good republi
can. but we fear he needs to fur
nish an affidavit to back up his
statement.
The Lidgerwood Broadaxe is a
hot proposition and although not
a seeker after public office sbems
to court notoriety. Last week he
was sued for $5,000 for defama
tion of the character of a Richland
county blindpigger who had pre
viously taken a fall out of Editor
Andrews and blacked both of his
eyes. It looks as if the Bismarck
Settler is no longer "the only
pebble on the beach."
STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

yesterday making the round calls on
town folks. He waB accompanied by
his brother-in-law, W. H. Tomlinson,
who hails from Grenfell, in the North
west Territory.
Attorney I. E. Richardson returned
Saturday from a trip down the line as
far as Park River and judging from the
event that transpired an hour later at
the Presbyterian parsonage his mission
must have been a successful one and
will, for a time at least, put a stop to
those mysterious visits that have tor
some time past been looked upon with
suspicion by his Langdon friends. It
was half-past three Saturday afternoon
when Rev. Dougan performed the cere
mony uniting Attorney Richardson and
Miss C. M. Kirk, of Park River, as man
and wife. The bride ranks among the
most charming and accomplished of
Park River's society buds and has for
some time piast been engaged as steno
grapher and typewriter in the offices of
Judge Libby and the First National
bank. The happy event has brought a
big round of congratulations to the domi
cile of Mr. and Mrs. Richardson at their
suite of rooms over Mrs. Blakely's store.

weddings it has been our pleasure to
ohronicle this month is that of Mr. Geo.
W. Welsh and Miss Elora M. B. M.
Jennings, which took place yesterday
afternoon at the home of the bride's fa

note written by Rev. Jas. Austin at one
o'clock this morning,shortly before dawn,
"after the ball." He says: "Thought I
had better send you a few particulars
concerning the Beaton-Dobie wedding
that occurred at three o'clock yesterday
afternoon in the presence of some fifty
friends. The groom Mr. James Beaton
is the eldest son of Mr. Wm. Beaton, of
Hamilton, and numbers among the suc
cessful young farmers of this settlement
The bride, Miss Mary Dobie is the
second daughter of Senator Dobie and a
very accomplished young lady. They
were accompanied by Mr. John Beaton,
brother of the groom, and Misses Katie
and Belle Dobie, sisters of the bride.
The bride was dressed in cream cash
mere, trimmed with satin and silk lace
and the groom in conventional black.
Am not able to give you a list of their

beautiful. After the ceremony was over
an elegant supper was served and later
music and dancing were in order."
