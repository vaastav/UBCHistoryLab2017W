houses of congress
Text of the Message.
Gentlemen of the Congress:
The year that has elapsed since I
last stood before yon to fulfill my con
stitutional duty to give the congress,
from time to time, information on the
state of the Union has been so 6rowd
ed with great events, great processes
and great results that I cannot hope
to give you an adequate picture of its
transactions or of the far-reaching
changes which have been wrought in
the life of our nation and of the world.
You have yourselves witnessed these
things as I have. It Is too soon to as
sess them, and we who stand in the
midst of them and are part of them
are less qualified than men of another
generation will be to say what they
mean, or even what they have been.
But some great outstanding facts are
unmistakable and constitute in a sense
part of the public business with which
it is our duty to deal. To state them
is to set the stage for the legislative
and executive action which must grow
-out of them and which we have yet to
shape and determine.
A year ago we had sent 145,918 men
overseas. Since then we have sent
1,950.513, an average of 162,542 each
month, the number in fact rising in
May last to 245,951, in June to 278,760,
in July to 307,182 axd continuing to
reach similar figures in August and
Septemberin August 289,570 and in
September 257,438.
Movement Is Unique.
No such movement of troops ever
took place before, across 3,000 miles
of sea, followed by adequate equip
ment and supplies and carried safely
through extraordinaiy dangers of at
rtack dangers which were alike
Elrange and infinitely difficult to guard
avainst. In all this movement only
758 men were lost by enemy attacks
630 of whom were upon a single Eng
lish transport, which was sunk naar
the Orkney islands.
Fighters Are Praised.
But it is not the physical scale and
executive efficiency of preparation,
supply, equipment and dispatch that I
-would dwell upon, but the mettle and
quality of the officers and men we sent
-over and of the sailors who kept the
seas, and the spirit of the nation that
istood behind them. No soldiers or
sailors ever proved themselves more
quickly ready for the test of battle
or acquitted themselves with more
eplendld courage and achievement
when put to the test. Those of us who
played some part in directing the
great processes by which the war was
pushed irresistibly forward to the
final triumph may now forget all that
and delight our thoughts with the
story of what our men did.
I need not tell yew what lay back of
this great movement af men and ma
terial. It is not invidious to say that
back of it lay a supporting organiza
tion of the industries at the country
and all its productive activities more
complete, more thorough in method
-and effective results, more spirited
and unanimous la purpose and effort
than any other great belligerent had
ever been able to effect. We profited
greatly by the experience of the na
tions which had already been en
gaged for nearly three years in the
exigent and exacting business, their
every resource and every executive
proficiency taxed to the utmost. We
'were the pupils, but we learned quick
ly and acted with a promptness and a
readiness of co-operation that Justify
our great pride that we were able to
nerve the world with unparalleled
energy and quick accomplishment.
Their officers understood the grim
and exacting task they had undertaken
and performed with audacity, effi
ciency and unhesitating courage that
touch the story of oanvoy and battle
with imperishable distinction at every
turn, whether the enterprise were
great or small from their chiefs,
Pershing and Stms, dawn to the young
est lieutenant, and their men worthy
of themsuch men aa hardly need to
be commanded, and go to their ter
rible adventure Wlthely and with the
quick intelligence of thane who know
Just what it la they would accomplish.
I am proud to be the tallow country
man of men of anon staff and valor.
Those of us who stayed at homo did
our dutythe war cnuM not have been
won or the galhmt men who taught
given their opportunity to win it other
wme but for many long day wo
think ouiaetrea "accursed wo
not there and held our manhood
cheap while any speaks that fought"
with these at St HlhM or Thierry.
Tan memory of these days of trtumph
ant battle will ge wfth (hone fortu
nate man to their graves, and each will
are hla favorite memory. "Old men
forgot, yet an shall ho fergot, but hall
remember with advantages what fonts
he did that day."
What we an thank God for
gratitude Is that our men
^U^
A
In force into the line of battle Just at
the critical moment when the whole
fate of the world seemed to hang in
the balance, and threw their fresh
strength into the ranks of freedom in
time to turn the whole tide and sweep
of the fateful struggleturn it once
for all, so that henceforth it was back,
back, back for their enemies, always
back, never again forward. After that
it was only a scant four months before
the commanders of the Central Em
pires knew themselves beaten and
now their very empires are in liquida
tion.
And through it all how fine the
spirit of the nation was. What unity
of purpose, what untiring zeal what
elevation of purpose ran through all
its splendid display of strength, its un
tiring accomplishment. I have said
that those of us who stayed at home to
do the work of organization and sup
ply will always wish that we had been
with the men whom we sustained by
our labor but we can never be
ashamed.
"It has been an inspiring thing to be
here in the midst of fine men who had
turned aside from every private inter
est of their own and devoted the whole
of their trained capacity to the tasks
that supplied the sinews of the whole
great undertaking that patriotism,
the unselfishness, the thorough-going
devotion and distinguished capacity
that marked their toilsome labors, day
after day, month after month, have
made them fit mates and comrades of
the men in the trenches and on the
sea.
"Women Gain New Luster."
"And not the men here in Wash
ington onlythey have but directed the
vast achievement. Throughout innu
merable factories, upon innumerable
farms, in the depths of coal mines and
iron mines and copper mines, wher
ever the stuffs of industry were to be
obtained and prepared, in the ship
yards, on the railways, at the docks,
on the sea, in every labor that was
needed to sustain the battle lines, men
have vied with each other to do their
part and do it well. They can look
any man-at-arms In the face and say,
'We also strove to win and gave the
best that was in us to make our fleets
and armies sure of their triumph.'
"And what shall we say of the
womenof their instant intelligence,
quickening every task that they
touched their capacity for organiza
tion and co-operation, which gave their
action discipline and enhanced the ef
fectiveness of everything they at
tempted their aptitude to tasks to
which they had never before set their
hands their utter self-sacrifice alike
in what they did and In what they
gave? Their contribution to the great
result is beyond appraisal. They have
added a new luster to the annals of
American womanhood.
"New Foundation Laid."
"The least tribute we can pay them
is to make them the equals of men
in political rights as they have proved
themselves their equals in every field
of practical work they have entered,
whether for themselves or for their
country. These groat days of complet
ed achievement would be sadly marred
were we to omit that act of Justice.
Bosides the immense practical ser
vices they have rendered, the women
of the country have been the moving
spirfts in the systematic economies by
which our people have voluntarily as
sisted to supply the suffering peoples
of the world and the armies upon
every front with food and everything
else that we had that might serve the
common cause. Details of such a
story can never be fully written, but
we carry them at our hearts and thank
God that we can say we are thb kins
men of such.
"And now we are sure of the great
triumph for which every sacrifice was
made. It has comecome ia its com
pleteness and with the pride and in
spiration of these days of achieve
ment quick within us we turn to the
tasks of peace againa peace secure
agalast the violence of iresponsiblo
monarchs and ambitious military co
teriesand make ready for a new or
der, for new foundation of Justice and
fair dealing.
"We are abont to give order and or
ganisation to this peace not only for
ourselves but for the other peoples of
the world as well, so far as they will
suffer us to serve them. It is intorna
tional Justice that we seek, not domes
tic safety merely.
"Our thoughts have dwelt of late
upon Europe, upon Asia, upon the Near
and the Far East, very little upon the
acts of peace and accommodation that
wait to be performed At our own
doors. Whllo we are adjusting our re
lations with the rest of the world, is
it not of capital importance that we
should clear away all grounds of mis
understanding with our immediate
neighbors and give proof of the friend
ship we really feel?
"I hope that the member* of the
Senate will permit me to speak once
more of the unratified treaty of friend
ship and adjustment with the republic
of Colombia. I very urgently urge en
them aa early and favorable action
upon that vital matter. I believe that
they will feel with me that the stage
of stairs is new set for sueh action aa
will be net only Just but generous and
in the spirit ef the new ago upon
which we have se happily entered.
*9o far aa ear domestic affairs arc
concerned the problem of our return
to peace a problem of economic and
Industrial readjustment. That problem
la less serleua for us than it may tarn
out to be for the nations which have
suffered the disarrangements and the
tosses of war longer than we Our
people, moreover, do not wnit to he

"All that we can do as their legisla
tive and executive servants is he me
diate the process of change here, there
and elsewhere as we may. I have
heard much counsel as to the plans
that should be formed and personally
conducted to a happy oonsummatfen,
sound foundation for the financial
operations of the year.
I entirely concur with the secretary
of the treasury recommending that
the $2,OO,0tO,6OO needed in addition
to the $4,MM)00,00 provided by ex*
isting law be obtained from the profits
whidh have aocrued and shall accrue

emerge which I thought it likely we
could force our spirited buslnees men
and self-reliant laborers to accept with
due pliancy and obedience.
"The one conclusion that I am ready
to state with confidence, is that it
would be disservice alike to the coun
try and to the owners of the railroads
to return to the old conditions unmodi
fied. These are conditions of re
straint without development. There
is nothing affirmative or helpful about
them. What the country chiefly needs
is that all its means of transportation
should be developed, its railways, Its
waterways, its highways and its coun
tryside roads. Some now element of
policy, therefore, is absolutely neces
sarynecessary for the service ef the
public, necessary for the release ef
credit to those who arc admlaieteriag
the railways, necessary fer the protec
tion of their security holders. ,The eld
policy may be changed much or little,
but surely it cannot wisely be left as
it was.
"I hope that the Congress win have
a complete and impartial study ef the
whole problem instituted at once and
prosecuted as rapidly as passible. I
stand ready and anxious to release the
roads from the present control and I
must do so at a very early date if by
waiting until the statutory limit of
time is reached I shall bo merely pro
longing the period of doubt and uncer
tainty which is hurtful tc every inter
est concerned.
VI welcome this occasion to an
nounce to the Congress my purpose to
Join In Paris the representatives of the
governments with which wo have been
associated in the war against the Cen
tral empires for the purpose of dis
cussing with them the main features
of the treaty of. peace. I realiae the
great inconveniences that will attend
my leaving the country, particularly
at this time, but the conclusions that
it was my paramount duty to ge have
been forced upon me by considera
tions which I hope will scorn as con
clusive to you as they have seemed
to me.
"The Allied governments have ac
cepted the basis of peace which I cut
lined to the Congress en the eighth of
January last, as the Central empires
also have, and very reasonably desire
my personal counsel in their totorpre
tation and applicatiea, and It high
ly desirable that I should grvc it in
order that the sincere desire ef our
government to eeatribute without
selfish purpose of any kind to settle
ments that will be ef eccnmea benefit
to all the nations concerned may be
made fully manifest.
"The peace settlements wade* are
now to be agreed upon are ef tran
scendent importance both to as and te
the rest of the world, and I knew
of no business er mtereat which
should take precedence ef them. The
gallant men of our armed forces oa
land and sea have eeasciously fought
for the ideals which they knew te he
the ideals of their country. I have
sought to express those Ideals, they
have accepted my statements ef tbem
as substance of their ewn thought and
purpose, as the aeaociated govern
ments have accepted them. I owe It
to them to see to It, so far aa In me
lies, that no false or mistaken inter
pretation is put upon them, and no
possible effort omitted to realize them.
It is now my duty te play my full part
In making good what thoy offered
their life's blood te obtain. I can think
of no oall te service which oeuld
transcend this.
Must atocey Business.
Fer the steadying and facilitation ef
our owa domestic bustnsss readjust
ment nothing Is mere important than
the immediate determination of the
taxea that arc to he levied for 1918,
ltlt and 19X0. As mnoh of the burden
of taxation must he lifted from busi
ness as sound methods of financing the
government will permit, and those who
conduct the great essential industries
of the country must ho told as exactly
as possible what obligations to the
government they will ho expected to
meet in the years Immediately ahead
of them. It will he of serious conse
quence tc the country to delay all un
certainties in this matter a stnglo day
longer than the right processes of de
bate Justify. It is Idle to talk of suc
cessful and confident business recon
struction before theec uncertainties
arc resolved.
If the war had continued it would
have beea accessary te raise at least
tt.tet.tOt.Ott by taxation payable in
tho year 1919 hot the war has ended
and I agree with the secretary of the
treasury that will be safe to reduce
the aaneunt to td.tofi.cetjiw. An Im
mediate rapid docMnc In tho expenses
of the government la net te be looked
far. Contracts made tor war seeelies
will, iadocd. he rapidly eeaceied aad
liquidated, hat their immediate liqui
dation will make heavy drains on the
treasury for the months Just ahead of
us.
Expenses eOW High.
The maintenance of ear forces on
the ether side ef the ana Is still neces
sary. A osnurtdoruhlc arcportton of
these forces most remain In Europe
during the period ef oconnexion, aad
those which are brought homo will he

these desnande will of course fall much
below what a continuation ef military
oocrntwaa would ham entailed nnd
tt,too.Qoa.ooo should saface to snooty a

in 1918 cr in 1919 frem business orig
inating in war oontracts. I urge year
acceptance ef his recommendation
that provision be made now, not sub
sequently, that the taxes to be paid in
1929 should be redused from six to
four bllltous. Any arrangement lees
definite than these would add elements
of doubt aad confusion tc the eritieai
period of industrial readjustment
through which the eeuntry mast new
immediately pass, and which no tree
friend of the nation's essential busi
ness interests can afford to be respon
sible fer creating or prolonging. Clear
ly determined conditions, clearly aad
simply charted, are indispensable tc
the economic revival and rapid indus
trial development wbioh may confi
dently bo expected If we act new and
sweep Ml interrogation peintc away.
Pleads for Navy Program.
I take 1 for granted that the con
gress will oarry out the Naval pro
gram which was undertaken before we
entered the war. The secretary of the
navy has submitted to your oommiMee
for authorisation that part of the pro
gram which covers the huildiag
of the next three years. These
have been prepared along the
and accordance with die peney
whleh the congress established, hot
under the exceptional conditions ef
the war, but with the intention ef ad
hering to a definite method of develop
ment for the Navy. I earneotly rec
ommend the uninterrupted pursuit ef
that poliey. It would clearly be un
wise for us to attempt to adjust cur
programs to a future world policy as
yet undetermined.
The question which causes the great
est concern is the question of tha pol
icy to be adopted toward the railroads.
I frankly turn to you for counsel upon
It. I have no confident judgment ef say
own. I do not see how any thoughtful
man can have who knows anything ef
the complexity of the problem. It la
a problem which must be studied.
studied immediately and studied witth
eut bias or prejudice. Nothing can he
gained by becoming partisan ef amy
particular plan of settlement.
Railroads Up to Congress.
It wan necessary that the adndndo
tratien of the railways should he taken
over by the government so long as toe
war lasted. It would have beea hopes
siMe otherwise to establish and carry
through under a single direction the
necessary priorities of shipments, ft
would hare been impossible other nans

Peace Treaty In Spring.
"Bxoeptional oirouRmtances and ex
ceptional methods of administration
were not needed to eonvmoe as that
the railroads were net equal te the
immense tasks of teanspcrtatlea hnv
posed upon them by the rapid and

as possible the alternative courses
that lie open to our choice. We can
simply release the roads and go back
to the old conditions of private man
agement, unrestricted competition,
and multiform regulation by both
state and federal authorities, or we
can go to the opposite extreme and
establish complete government con
trol, accompanied, if necessary, by
actual government ownership, or we
can adept an intermediate course of
modified private control, under a more
untried and affirmative public regula
tion and under such alterations of
the law as will permit wasteful com
petition to be avoided and a consider
able degree of unification of adminis
tration to be effected, as, for example,
by regional corporations under which
the railways of definable area would
be In effect combined in single sys
tems.
"Harness Now Taken Off."
"While the war lasted we' set up
many agencies by which to direct the
hMhuortes ef the country in the serv
ices it was necessary for them to ren
der, by which to make sure of. an
abundant supply of the materials need
ed, by which to cheek undertakings
that oeuld for the time be dispensed
with and stimulate those that were
meet serviceable in war, by which to
gain tor the purchasing departments
ef the government a certain control
over the prices of essential articles
and materials by which to restrain
trade with alien enemies, make the
meet ef the available shipping, and
oyscematixe financial transactions,

wcutd be no unnecessary conflict or
oeatfttsfcmby which, in short, to put
every material energy of the country
in harness to draw the common load
and make of us one team in the ac
oempliehmsnt of a great task.
"Hut the moment we knew the
armistice to. have been signed we took
the harness off. Raw materials upon
wbioh the government had kept Its
hand fer fear there should not be
enough fer the industries that sup
plied the armies, have been released
and put into the general market again.
Groat Industrial plants, whose whole
output and machinery had been taken
over for the uses of the government,
have bean set free to return to the
uses, to which they were put before'
the war. It has not been possible to
remove se readily or so quickly the
cantos! ef foodstuffs and of shipping

from ear granaries, and the ships are
BOM seeded to send supplies to our

before have there been
existence in this oountry
which knew so much of the field ef

War Industries board, the War Trade

Food administration and tha Fuel ad

labore became thoroughly systema

agencies they have beea directed by
men wbioh represented the permanent

I has been the policy of tho execu

was assured (which is in effect a com
plete submission of the enemy) to
put the knowledge of these bodies at
the disposal of the business mea ef

will but enlarge the plans and the ap
propriations which it has entrusted to

cultural development which will af
ford the best sort of opportunity to

friendly attention.
Pleads for Belgian Aid.
"I have spoken of the control which
must yet for a while, perhaps for a
long while, be exercised over ship
ping because of the priority of service
to which our forces overseas are enti
tled and which should also be accord
ed the shipments which are to save
recently liberated peoples from star
vation and many devastated regions
from permanent ruin.
"May I not say a special word
about the needs of Belgium and North
ern France? No sums of money paid
by way of indemnity will serve of
themselves to save them from hope
less disadvantage for years to come.
Something more must be done than
merely find the money. If they had
money and raw materials In abund
ance tomorrow they could not resume
their place in the industry of the
world tomorrowthe very important
place they held before the name of
war swept across them. Many of their
factories are razed to the ground.
"Much of their machinery is de
stroyed or has been taken away. Their
people are scattered and many of thoir
best workmen are dead. Their mar
kets will be taken by others If they
are not in special way assisted to re
build their factories and replace their
lost instruments of manufacture. They
should not be left to the vicissitudes
of the sharp' competition for materials
and for industrial facilities which in
now to set in.
"I hope therefore that the Congress
will not be unwilling, if it should be
come necessary, te grant to some such
agency as the War Trade board the
right to establish priorities of export
and supply for the benefit of these
people whom we have been so happy
to assist in saving from the German
terror and whom we must not now
thoughtlessly leave tc shift for them*
selves in a pitiless competitive mar
ket.
Will Keep Close Touch.
"I shall be in close touch with yon
and with affairs on this side the wa
ter, and you will know all that I do.
At my request, the French and Eng
lish governments have absolutely re
moved the censorship of cabled ncwa
which until within a fortnight they
had maintained and there is now no
censorship whatever exercised at this
snd except upon attempted trade com
munications with enemy countries. It
has boon necessary to keep an open
wire constantly available between
Paris and the Department of State
