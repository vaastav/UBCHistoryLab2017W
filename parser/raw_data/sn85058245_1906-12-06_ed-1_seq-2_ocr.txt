CHAPTER XV
The Face That Looked Into Joans
Tho chamber to which tho Duchess
Joan was conducted by her hostess
had evidently been carefully prepar
I ed for her reception It was a large
I low room with a vaulted roof of carv
I en wood Tho work was of great
i merit and evidently old A table with
a little prleDlcu stood In the corner
Ecreened by a curtain which ran on
a brazen rod A Roman Breviary lay
on a velvetcovered table before tho
crucifix Joan lifted It up and her
eyes fell on the words By a woman
he overcame By a woman he was
his
overcome A woman was once
weapon A woman Is now become the
instrument of his defeat Ho flndeth
that the weak vessel cannot be
broken
Nor shall It said Joan looking
at the cross before her by the
strength of Mary the Mother the weak
vessel shall not bo broken
As she stooped to blow out the last
candle a motto on the stem caught
her eye Joan took the candle out of
Its socket and read the Inscription
word by word
Da pacem Domlne in dlebus nos
i trls
trlsIt was her own scroll the motto of
the reigning dukes of Hohensteln
trange one doubtless to bo that of
a fighting race but nevertheless her
fathers and her own
What did her fathers motto the
device of her house upon this Baltic
island far from tho highlands of
Kernsberg Had these wastes once I
belonged to men of her race And
this woman who so regally played the
mistress of this strange hermitage
who was she
And as Joan of Hohensteln blew out
the candle she mused In her heart
concerning these things
S e a e
I Tho Duchess Joan slept soundly her
dark boyish head pillowed on the
full rounded curves of an arm thrown
behind her On the little velvet
covered table beside the bed wero her
belt and Its dependent sword a faith
ful companion in Its sheath of plain
black leather Under her pillow and
within Instant reach of her right hand
was her fathers dagger
n
In their chamber In the wing which
looks toward the north the three cap
tains lay wrapped In their mantles
Jorlnn and Boris answering each other
nasally in alternate trumpet blasts
like Alp calling to Alp Werner von
Orseln alone could not sleep and
after ho had sworn and kicked his
noisy companions In the ribs till he
was weary of the task ho rose and
went to the window to cast open the
lattice The air within felt thick and
hot As Werner set his face to the
opening quick flashes of summer light
ning flamed alternately white and lilac
across the horizon and he felt the
spit of hailstones In his face driving
level like so many muslet balls when I
the infantry fires by platoons
t S i S I
Above In tho vaulted chamber
Joan turned over on her bed murmur j
Ing uneasily in her sleep A white I
I face which for a quarter of an hour I
had been bent down to her dark head
as it lay on the pillow was suddenly
retracted Into the darkness at the I
girls slight movement I
Again apparently reassured the
shadowy visage approached as the
young duchess lay without further
motion Suddenly and for no appar
ent reason Joans eyes opened and
she found herself looking with be
wilderment Into a face that bent
down upon her a white face which
somehow seemed to hane suspended
I
I r
I
A white face which somehow seemed
to hang suspended in the dark above
her
In the dark above her Time features
were lit up by the pulsing lightning
which shone In the wild eyes and gut
tered on a knlfeblndc about the han
dle ot which were clenched the tense
fingers of a hand equally detached
In n moment Joans right hand had
grasped the dagger under her pillow
Her left shooting upward closed on
tho arm which held the threatening
steel Almost without rising from her
bed she projected herself upon her
enemy and she felt her rangers sink
deep in the soft curves of a womans
throat
Then a shriek long and terrible
inhuman and threatening rang
through the house As Joan overbore
her assailant upon the floor the door
opened and glancing upward she saw
the Wordless Man stand on the
threshold a candle in one hand and
a naked sword In tho other
Tho terrible cry which had rung in
her ears had been his At sight of
him Joan unclasped her fingers from
the throat of the woman who had
been her hostess and rose slowly to
her feet The old man rushed for
ward and knell beside the prostrate
body of his mistress
At tho same moment there came
the sound of quick footsteps running
up tho stairway The door flew open
and Werner von Orseln burst in also
sword in hand
What Is the meaning of this he
shouted Who has dared to harm
my lady
Go down and bring a cup of wine
commanded Joan as soon as ho ap
peared And Werner von Orseln de
parted without a word to do her bid
ding Meanwhile tho Wordless Man had
raised his mistress up from the
ground Carry your mistress to that
couch said the young duchess point
Ing to tho tumbled bed from which a
few minutes before she had so hastily
launched herself
Whilst ho was thus engaged Wer
ner came In quickly with a silver cup
in his hand
Joan took It Instantly and going for
ward she put it to the lips of the wom
an on the bed
Putting out her hands the woman
took the cup and drank It slowly
pausing between the draughts to draw
long breaths
I must have strength she said
I have much to say Then Joan of 1
Hohensteln thou shalt Judgo between I
thee and me
The color came slowly back to the
womans pale face and after a little
she raised herself on tho pillows
Joan stood motionless and uncompro
mising by the great Iron dogs of the
chimney
You are waiting for me to speak I
and I will speak You have a double
right to know all Shall it be told to
yourself alone or in the presence of
this man
She looked at Von Orseln as she
spoke
I I have no secrets In my lltw said
Joan there Is nothing that I would
hide from him Save one thing She I
added the last words In her heart
There was an Interval of silence
in the room filled lip by the hoarse
persistent booming of the storm with
out and the shuddering Shocks of the
wind on the lonely house Then the
woman spoke again In a low distinct
voice
Since It Is your right to know my
name I am Theresa von Lynarwho
havo also a right to call myself of
Hohensteln and your dead fathers
widow
I
In an Instant the reserve of Joans I
sternly equal mind was broken up
She dropped her sword clattering on
the floor and started angrily toward I
the bed
It is a lie most foul she cried
my father lived unwed for many
years nay ever since my mothers
death who died in giving me life he
never so much as looked on woman
It is a thing well known in the
Duchy
Tho woman did not answer directly
Max Ulrich bring tho silver cas
ket she said taking from her neck
a little silver key
Tho Wordless Man seeing her
action came forward and took the key
Ho went out of the room and after
an Interval which seemed Interminable
I he returned with a peculiarly shaped
casket The woman touched a spring
I with well practiced hand and n roll
I of parchment fell upon the bed With
a strange smile she gave It to Joan
beckoning her with an upward nod to
approach
Joan took the crackling parchment
It had three seals attached to It and
the first part was in her fathers hand
writing
I declare by these presents that I
have married according to tho
cus
toms of Hohensteln and the laws of
the empire Theresa von Lynar
daughter of tho Count von Lynar of
Jutland Hut this marriage shall not
by any of its occasions or consequents
affect the succession of my daughter
Joanna to the Duchy of Hohensteln
and the Principalities of Kernsherg and
Marlenfeld To which wo subscribe
our names as conjointly agreeing
thereto In the presence of His High
Eminence the Cardinal Adrian Arch
bishop of Cologne and Elector of the I
Holy Roman Empire I
After her first shock
of surprise
was
over Joan noted carefully tho date It
was one year after her own birth and
therefore the llko period after the
death of her mother the openly ac
knowldged Duchess of Hohensteln
Joan folded this parchment and
handed It back Then she stood silent
waiting for an explanation
The woman took up her parable
calmly like who
one has long compre
hended h that such a crisis must one
day arrive and who knows her part
thoroughly
Ifl 1 who speak to you am Theresa
von Lynar
Your father saw me first
nt tho coronation Of our late sover
eign Christian King of Denmark
And we loved one another For many
years at Castle Lynnr and aho at
this place called the Hermitage of
the Dunes Henry of Kernsberg and 1
dwelt In such happiness as mortals
seldom know But there came a
spring when my brother being like
your father a hot and passionate
YW1l n
threatening man quarreled to go with before Duke time llen 1 E
the B et
Empire If I were not I of
acknowledged duchess nndmmsat n
Maurice von Lynnr made

true t

with

I sent my son to my brother to train daT
BS his own son in arms

being at

my husband made ready to
