After Electrocution Lawyer

Relative to the plan of County Physi

ply all Ilfe restoring tests known to
science on the body of John Mantesana
after he has been electrocuted In the
I new State prison John Bernhardt the
condemned mans lawyer has deter
mined on different courses of action
FIrst he will attempt to frustrate the
plan of the doctors by being In the ex
ecution chamber and claiming iho body
just as soon as the electric current has
been applied If that falls to prevent
the application of the tests Mr Bern
linrdt proposes to minutely watch the
progress of the tests and If Manlcsana
ehows the least Indication of returning
I to life the lawyer will Immediately de
mand his liberty on the lonstllutlonal
contention that a man may not a sec

iSnectal to The Ev nlnr World
WASHINGTON Dec SThe most
striking feature of the last mesrage ot
i President Hoot to the Sixtieth
I Congress read In the Senate and house
today Is a passage which makes good
a recent prophecy Uttered by E H
Harriman at a banquet in New York
Mr Hnrrlmon said at that time speak
I Ing of the forthcoming message
I I told the President of the Inltec
States three years ago thai In passing
i the presrnl Interstate Commerce act
i without changing the Sherman act he
was Inviting a great deal of trouble
I
Now he will probably recommend the
very thing which I suggested
And President Roosevelt In his mes
sage today makes the recommendation
that the Sherman AntiTrust law be
1
I replaced by ft law which shall cxr > resslj
permit combinations of capital but will
place the Interstate railways of th <
I country absolutely under the control
of the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion The enforcement of the Sherman
I act the President says works almost
as much hardship as good
I Not a Word About the Tariff
The President studiously refrains
from making any reference however
I fleeting to the tariff question This
omission Is the more noticeable from
the fact that he has something to say
about nearly everything else APpar
ently President Hoosevell Is leaving the
tariff matter to be handled exclusively
by his successor Mr Tuft
A little matter of 20000 words was Ibis
I message It was a typical Iloosevelllan
production touching upon nearly every
living question and a lot of dead ones
and abounding In Roosevelt words and
phrases such as empiricism fair
dealing anarchist reactionary
wrongdoer of great wealth honest
business men corruptlonlt bribe
giver preacher of class hatred well
meaning but wrongheaded men abuse
of wealth reign of an unrestricted In

wealthiest and most formidable crim
inals the common people blind and
Ignorant resistance corrupt crea
tures odious vice of class selfish
ness twentieth century economic phi
losophy traitors to the people or
derly elfresiralnt and tainted with
vindictiveness
The President devotes the bulk of his
message to a discussion of the corpora
tions the courts and labor He sheds
about 2000 words with some quotations
from Marco Polo on the condition of
eectlons of northern China where forest
have been destroyed Ihls to Illustrate

SHOCKING ONE SAYS i

I
Knows Gould Merely as a

Few Trifles Perhaps
i
I Justice Seabury of the Supreme
i Court denied today the motion oi
Nlcoll Anabe Lindsay Fuller coun
II sel for Frank Jay Gnuld to strike out
about half the paragraphs In the thin
amended complaint of Ills wife Helen
I Kelly Gould In her suit for absolute
I divorce In which she names Rose Win
ter Marjorie Stevens and others
I The motion was based on Urn conten
tion that the allegations sought to h <
eliminated were Irrelevant to the statu
tory charge and redundant And that
I
contention was based on the fact that
i Instead of coins from the beginning to
i the end of an accusation In a III le
i paragraph Herbert C Smyth made
separate paragraphs of the introduction
I
The complaint said for Instance that
Mr Gould had his agent engage a rooir
I at the Hotel Grand In Paris In the au
tumn of 190C adjoining and connected
with the apartment occupied by Mar
1 Jorle Stevens
Says She Got 3000
i Then In a preceding paragraph it I s al
leged that Mr Gould availed hlmielf at
the connecting doors between the apart
ments and virile Miss Stevens In hnr
apartment during the fall and winter of
11loj and IM
I Still another paragraph alleged that on
their return to New York Mr Gould con
tinued his attentions to Marjorie Ste
vens at No UiO Vet Fiftieth street
It was aliened In one paragraph that
Frank J Gould lint met Hose Winter
at Martins In April or May ISM
In another paragraph that he had
given n diamond ring a gold purse and
various sums of money at dlffeicni
I
i times one of the gifts being JSuoo to
Hose Winter
Then In a paragraph which was the
only one according to the contention of
Mr Goulds lawyers which should re
main Gould Is charged with visiting
Rose Winter at No 50S West Fifty
eighth street No 30S West Fiftyeighth
street Is the Hotel Phoieham
Justice Sosbury mules that the whole
complaint should stand that time de
scriptive paragraphs are merely Intln
duetoiy and sustaining Mr Smyths
contention that these gifts to Hose
Winter were not Platonic gifts but the
motive for her acceptance of Mr
Goulds attentions
Perfectly Shocking
Its perfectly shocking How dare
she exclaimed Miss Ilosu Winter the
tall and beautiful actress In her apart
j ment In the Sonoma today when a re
porter for The Evening World told her
Mrs Frank Gould had named her as one
of the corespondents In the suit for
divorce
Miss Winter Is an English woman of
a fine family living near Birmingham
and some years ago married Percy
Winter a writer of London Since slm
has been In America and on the stage
I she has been known as Miss Winter
She Is blond and slender with i ep
