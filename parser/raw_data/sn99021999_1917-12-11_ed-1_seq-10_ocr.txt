It was cold Monday moyiing, but
not as cold assome people would
make their friends believe. The thread
Sare interrogation, "how cold is it,"
got a response something like this
. from the average shivering Omahan:
"oh, about 25 below, though I guess
it was colder than that early in the
morning."
As a matter of fact it was colder
at 8 o'clock than it was at 5 o'clock.
But it was only 12 degrees below at
8 o'clock, and then the mercury be
gan to climb, reaching 2 degrees be
low zero at noon. The official read-
ing atop the postoffice at 5 o'clock
Monday morning was 10 degrees be
low zero.
When the sun came out, a crisp,
snappy winter day broke over Omaha.
With a light wind and sunshine, the
temperature is scheduled for a further
drop during the day.
The storm which raged over the
Dakotas and the northwest generally
expended itself during Sunday, strik
ing this region with moderate force.

Want to Close Minnesota
Saloons at 7 O'clock
W. F. Nelson, membeV-at-large of
the Minnesota public safety commis
sion, is in Omaha in connection with
the proposed closing of saloons at 7
o'clock p. m. in the Gopher state.

an executive committee of five mem
bers and seven members-at-large with

last week recommended that Raloons
of our county should be closed at 7
o'clock p. m. There are 380 saloons
in Minneapolis and the present clos
ing hour is 10 o clock p. m. We feel
that 7 o'clock would be a good con
servation measure," stated Mr. Nel
son. i
He added that recommendations
will be made to the state commission
to make the 7 o clock closing of state
wide scope.
Mr. Nelson believes his state has

of socialists and with the Nonpartisan

YOUTH OF OMAHA
HASTENS TO BEAT
THE NEXT DRAFT
Enlistments Heavy Under the
Drive of 250 "Soldiers
From Fort Crook This
Week.
The young men of Omaha are
"issers" and not "wassers." The "En
listment day" propaganda promul
gated by army officials to encourage
enlistments is being carried out to
successful fruition. " .
Omaha men are responding in great
numbers to the appeals of soldiers
from Fort Crook to enlist in the
army this week and not wait to be
drafted later. They must enlist be
fore Friday.
All fortnoon the clerks at the army
recruiting office were busy explaining
various phases of army life to pospec-
tive applicants and up until 11 clock
more than 100 men had signified their
willingn:sr to undergo the prelimi
nary examination. Recru ting offi
cers are confident that fully 300 men
will enlist today.
Many Waiting Turns.
Throughout the day the corriders
of the army building were filled with
a seething mass of humanity, from
the beardless youth of 17 to the gray
haired man of 40, each patiently await
ing his turn to enter the recruiting
room to undergo the preliminary ex
amination. Recruiting was given a great stimu
lus through the efforts of 250 regular
soldiers from rort Crook who are
posted at downtgwn street intersec
tions importuning men of all ages to
make this week one of the largest in
history, so far as enlistments are con
cerned. - ,
After taking the preliminary exami
nation in Omaha the applicants are
sent to Fort Logan, Colo., where they
undergo the real test, and if they pass
they will then be assigned to differ
ent regiments for duty.
Many young men ot draft age are
taking advantage of the opportunity
to enlist now and select the branch of
the service they desire, preferring to
go now rather than waiting until they
are called and assigned to that branch
of the service where the government
sees fit to send them.'
The soldiers were entertained at
luncheon at the Commercial club.
Uo to noon 125 men had been
brought to the recruiting station by
fthe soldiers stationed about the
downtown streets. '

BREAD IS BAKED
HERE NOW UNDER
THE NEW RULES
Bakeries Start to Turn Out
' Loaves as Prescribed by
the Food Adminis-
tration.
Bakeries began baking bread
Monday under the regulations pre
scribed by the baker'j license which
went into effect this morning. The
licenses are issued to all bakers using
10 or more barrels of flour per month.
Under these regulations bread is
baked in 16, or 24-ounce loaves or
multiples of these units. In other
words, bakers may bake bread only
in 16-ounce, 24ounce, 32-ouiice, 48
ounce loaves, and so on.
Pound for Nine Cents.
- The 16-ounce loaf is to cost 9 cents;
the 24-iunce loaf, 13 cents; the 32
ounce loaf, 17 cents, and4lfe 48-ounce
loaf,' 25 cents. These are the prices
recommended for Douglas county by
the state food administrator. These
prices are for cash over the counter.
The ingredients entering into the
making of the bread are aso now
government regulated. They are in
the following ratio;
Floor 196
Skimmed or buttermilk .' 6
Fats, not to exceed....,,.' 2
Not more than 15 per cent 'of the
fats are permitted to be animal fats.
" Must Keep Weight.

braska who sought to get the govern
ment regulation changed so as to al
low a greater proportionate use of
buttermilk productsn the baking of

federal food administration has re
fused to allow the recommendation.
The committee here had recom
mended that as much as 72 pounds f
buttermilk meal be .allowed in the 196
pounds of flour, bfit the federal food
administration held that six pounds is
enough, and that in this small quan
tity buttermilk, may be substituted for
skimmed milk at the option of the
baker.

RECORD YEAR FOR
PACKING COMPANY
cbdahy Earnings Run Into Mil
lions of Dollars, Accord
ing to the Annual
Report.
The annual rep-rt of the Cudahy
Packing company for the vear ending
October 31 and given out by the
president, Edward, A. Cudahy, indi
cates that for , the 12 months under
consideration, the volume of business
was far in excess of that of any pre
vious corresponding period. '
During the 12 months under re-
view, Mr. Cudahy says that the com
pany earnings, in round numbers,
were $4,430,000. This enormous busi
ness that brought about these earn
ings, was handled without any fric
tion, due to the loyalty of employes
and the friendly relations existing. be
tween all parlies connected with the
several plants. , ' .
Gross Gale of Products.
The gross sale "of allproduc'ts dur
ing the year covered bv the report
approximated $184,000,000, as against
$133,000,000 during the previous year,
and the volume of meat'' in pounds,
handled, was something like 10 per
cent greater than during any previous
year.
For live stock for slaughter in the
several plants, last year the Cudahy
company 'pa:d out $129,000,000, as
against $87,500,000 the previous year,
or an increase of nearly 40 per cent.
There was a large increase in the
number of company shareholders and
at the time of making the report, the
individual holders of shares numbered
something like 600.
The gross proceeds from the sales
of all products derived from animals
purchased and slaughtered, amounted
to $160,000,000 and the balance of the
$184,000,000 from the sale of edible
products and such articles as glycer
ine, soaps, cleansers," etc.
After dedutting all expenses, in
cluding the war tax, tliere was a net
profit, of $2,500,000 left to be divided
among the holdert of the shares of
stock. '
. Helps Win the War.
During the last year the Cudahy
company . supplied " the - government
with vast quantities of food supplies
for the armies at homf and abroad.
In addition, vast stores of meats and
food supplies have been sold to the
allies, besides millions of pounds that
have gone to the Belgian and other
relief commissions.
In all particulars the officers of
the company have complied with the
regulations exacted by the govern
ment and the food administration
agents. They have co-operated at all
times, and are f the opinion that the
best results will be attained by a
study of economics, stabiliAtionand
stimulating the production .of live
stock by liberal prices, rather than
by .reducing cr unduly restricting the
profit of the packer, which it is as
serted is so smalt that it is practically
negligible as affecting the, prices paid
the consumer for his products.
