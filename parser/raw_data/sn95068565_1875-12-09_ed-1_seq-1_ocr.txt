VALM.vsr.lu'n latest order presents an

prohibts people fnim traveling at night
because they are liable to he shot by the
numerous patrols through the. country.
As the unfortunate Cubans are afraid to
travel around during the daytime for the
same reason, the will probably have to

I.v a review of London pauperism re
rcutly published, a striking contrast is
drawn between the present state of
things and that existing sixty years ago.
Then the number of persons relieved by
the poor rates was eight per cent, of the
population. Now it is only three per
rent. The population has more than
trebled in thai time, yet the number of
persons wanting relief remains nearly
he same.
Tun treasury officials now estimate
that the government will recover more
than $2,00(1,01)0 from the crooked whisky
rases. They at first estimated that only
one million five hundred thousand dollars
would be recovered. They attribute this
success to the evidence directly obtained
by the means of the new system of com
paring accounts, which was inaugurated
by solicitor Wilson, and which led to the
detection of the frauds.
Ciiikh JirsTK'E Width, of Utah
formerly known in Alabama us"llonnic
lilue White" has rendered a decision
releasing lirigham Young, and demolish
ing former decisions of an adverse char
acter. White's decision unravels one of
the Mormon (iordian knots, and will al
low attorney general l'ierrepont to
breathe easier. In the meantime, Ann
Eliza's chances for alimony are growing
smaller and beautifully less.
(iliX. Jit HAL K. Kakly, president of
the southern historical society, says that
this association possesses nearly a com
plete set of all the reports printed by the
confederate departments, including the
president's messages, reports of battles,
acts of the confederate congress and
state governments, etc. It has also a
full set of manuscript reports of (ien.
Longstreet's corps, the paors of ( ien. J.
K II. Stuart, all of (Ien. Kwell'e reports,
a full set of papers of (ien. S. 1). Lee's
corps, and many other valuable rctnrts
of confederate officers, besides a number
of federal official reports.
A (HfiASTIc hotel is about to be built
in London, with American capital, by an
Amcriciin architect, with American
speed, after an American plan, and to be
managed on the American system. A
site not far from tho house of commons.
and close to St. James' park, lias been
purchased, and it is said that n year
hence the first visitor may take up his
abode in the new establishment. This
hotel will make up 1,000 beds; the dining-room
will accommodate 700 persons
at the same time, and a stalf of 100 ser
vants will be required to carry on the
duties of the house.
lti'd'NT events in the history of San
Francisco more than ever prove the mer
curial character not only of its institu
tions, but of its people. Sail Francisco
lives upon the Nevada mines. The con
dition of the mines, therefore, has a great
deal of influence upon the business and
tcmncr of the people of Sail Francisco.
The recent fire in the bonan.as has de-
nrnuul Sue. Vrancisco trade. At tlx
i - - . .,
same time the agricultural enterprises ol
the stale are temiering the sensational
spirit of tho San Francisco people.
There is an undergrowth of business in
tho city which does not depend upon the
mines, nnl it will supplant tho sensationalism.
cuco with the authorities at Washington,
iiijuiry has been especially made in
relation to 'The Philadelphia University
of Medicine and Surgery,' and 'The
Livingston University of America' in
stitutions, so called of which there are
professed agencies in Ismdnn and other
English cities. The latter institution
never existed, and the charter of the
former was revoked in 1872, on account
of the issue and sale of sp'-rious diplomas,
Tun famous submarine tunnel of the
iCnglish channel will soon be begun. The
members of the French commission, com
posed for the most part of practical men
and engineers, declare that an uni.er-
groiind communication between France
and England is only a iucstioii of ex
pense, and their report leads to Hi
belief that the project can be carried out
will, less exnense. than was at first
imagined, and that the danger of leakage

TllliliH were important disclosures last
week in the trial in St. Louis of McDon
ald for defrauding the revenue. The
,.,,, ...I,,, r.,illcctcd the enormous sums of
blackmail from the distillers was on the
stand. He swore that something like

venrs. that the, "emoluments" were more
than S,000 a week, and that one of the
ring who believed in "the, policy of si
lence" received !?."i0,000. A bad lot all
around, but the worst of them is this
Mcgram, wiio willingly made himself a
confederate of theirs for five years, and
now lictravs all the rest in order to retain
his own share of the plunder and keep
out of iail. The St. Louis ring seems to
have been conducted by shrewd and cun
ning men, and it is to be hoped that
their punishment may serve as a warn

1'KttTiNENT to tho question of a
war with Spain, tlie New York Herald
publishes a statement of tlie navies of
all nations. This shows that Spain has
eight "line of battle ships of the first
class," while tiic United States have not
one. Tlie tonnage of tho navies of tlie
two are aliout equal, but that of the
United States is largely in amphibious
craft for coast defense. Counting our
inshore craft and all, Spain lias a quarter
more guns than we. As wo have clung
to tho cast-iron smooth liores, in which
no material improvement lias been made
in a century, we can not boast of the su
perior power of our guns. I'ut there is
one source of consolation: the monitors
can not leave our shores, so our defenders
can not desert us.
