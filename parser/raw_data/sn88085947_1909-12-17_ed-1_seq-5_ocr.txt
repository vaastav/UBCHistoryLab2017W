N6VELIST CONNOLLY
GOES INTO POLITICS
James B. Connolly, writer of sea
novels, protege of Theodore Roose
velt, and advocate of the strenuous,
Is running for congress in Boston.
JAMES B. CONNOLLY.
In seeking the nomination on the
Tenth district democratic ticket he
declares he will fight graft.
"If Connolly goes to congress—"
the Boston politicians say, and then
tremble,
Two things endeared him to the
sturdy ex-president. He liked the
sea and wrote gcx>d stories of salt
water, and he wasn't afraid to say
what he felt in political affairs. He
lines up to the T. R. standard of
perfection In public office.
Consequently, they do a lot of
thinking in Roston about Connolly
these days.

White House Rectangle
WASHINGTON 1 , D. C, Dec. 17.—
President T-'ft has a new tennis
court, His friends say that he will
soon have a 'tennis cabinet.'
Back some distance from the
south front of. the White House and
well screened by trees from the
public, ga;:e and highly adorned
about the edges with shrubbery,
has been laid out a tennis court
that puts in the shade the Roose
velt court, which passed when the
new»addil ion to the executive of
fices \v< re built.
This afternoon the first game
was played, and by members of the
Roosevell "tenuis cambinet"—some
of the wicked men who have been
accused of a Roosevelt "baek-frotn-
Blba" propaganda. Glfford Pinchot
was there, with .1. J. Jusserand, the
French ambassador; Beekman
Wlnthrop, assistant secretary of
the navy, and Herbert Knox Smith.
It is whispered that the presi
dent feels lie has executed a
strategic nunc of great importance
in flanking the Roosevelt hosts. He
is contemplating taking a request

TRUTH
A true statement that is good as the Declaration
of Independence. We have agreed to pay $10,000.00
in cash to our landlord if we fail to vacate our build
ing before January first. When we started this great
Bale we had over 1,500 Pianos in stock. At the rate
they are being sold, we will not have a single Piano
left within a very few days. Our selling record has
never been equaled; prices were never heard of, and
terms never so low. Imagine the expense of putting
these Pianos in I.os Angeles. You naturally know
we are not going to ship any one of them that can
possibly be sold. $125,00 will buy a Piano now, after
all discounts have been taken off, you would pay in
a regular way not less than $27. r >,o<»o to $300,000 or
$326.00, will buy the $600.00 and $550.00 Pianos, old
reliable makes, instruments lliat have been tried and
found true, Pianos that your neighbors have owned
for years, and the price that you pay for a new
Player-Piano now is less than you would pay for the
same instrument at any other time without the in
terior Player. Grand Pianos are being sold for the
regular juice of an upright.
