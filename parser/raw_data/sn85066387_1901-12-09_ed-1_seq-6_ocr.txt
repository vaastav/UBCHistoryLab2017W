Pace for Dogs at
Union Park.
Oharta Beats Ireland for the
Honors in Special
Stake.
"As good a day's sport as has been seen
on a coursing Held," > was the unanimous
verdict of the crowd of enthusiasts that
filled the stands yesterday at Union
Coursing Park. Leashmen who have
patronized the game season after season
and who are classed as veterans admitted
that the hard-fought and interesting
trials were far and above any they ha a
■witnessed on the local field since the in
auguration of the sport on the coast.
Lively hares were responsible lor the
big scores, and the speediest dogs at the
park were lorced to go tne time limit. In
many instances they were beaten out by
the hares.
fcileety Mist won the open stake by de
fault, Leola, which had workea her way
to the linal, bting withdrawn because of
previous hara running. Sleety, too, had
some severe going, ner bye with May
Hempstead in the semi-tinai reaching tne
limit. * reeze out looked a good chance
for the stake, but in a ciose course in the
sixth round fell a victim to L*ola.'s clev
erness.
Charta won the special stake, beating
Ireland 7 to a in the deciding course. Palo
Alto, the even money stake favorite,
seemed to have a strong cnance for the
final. The champion had the speed, but in
the second round Warsnip, his opponent,
was favored by the nare, and wnen ttiti
course enaed .falo Alto was on the short
end of the score. The defeat of Geary's
courser hurt the feelings ot tfie talent
somewhat, the wise ones having backed
him at 1 to tt.
Silver Cloud and his kennel mate, Hap
hazard, as the •'bye" dog were slipped to
a. demon hare, that took them all over the
tieid and kept them going- the full limit.
Two relief oogs joined in the chase, and
they, too, were given a hard run. 'lhe
hare beat the quartet handily and es
caped.

Crowell and Collier Win
the Davis Cups
Again. »
Place Third Victory to Their
Credit for the Tro
phies.
The handicap doubles tournament for
the Davis cups held yesterday on the Cal
ifornia Tennis Club courts was won in a
clever fashion by H. W. Crowell and W.
B. Collier. This is the third time the team
has won a tournament of this kind. By
winning the cups twice more they will
gain permanent possession of them. The
opposing team in the finals was Chet
Smith and James Code, the holders.
Twelve teams contested and in the pre
liminary round four matches were played.
The first was between R. B. Cornell and
R. N. Whitney and the Wood brothers.
The latter received odds of "thirty" and
lost after a close struggle, the score being
5—7, 7—5, &— 1.
Frank Stringham and Will Allen al
lowed John Gibson and Herbert Schmidt
odds of "fifteen" and won in straight sets,
6—1, 6—4. C. Smith and Code received odds
of "fifteen" from Merle Johnson and Gus
Taylor and won. 2—6, 6—3, 6—4. Page Col
lier and Harry Gorham received "half fif
teen" from Homer Parker and Carl Gard
ner and 'won in straight sets, 6 — 3, 6 — 3.
In the first round Dick Adams and
James McKenzie received odds of "fifteen
and owe half fifteen" from Collier and
Crowell. With the score standing 6—3,
2—45. 3—3, Adams and McKenzie withdrew
and the match went to their opponents by
default. In the next match, when the
score stood 6—3, 2—6, 3—2, Cornell and
Whitney defaulted to Stringham and Al
len. The latter received odds of •'fifteen."
Smith and Code allowed P. Collier and
Gorham odds of "half fifteen" and won in
straight sets, 7 — 5, 6 — 3. In the last match
of this round Paul Jones and Herman
Powers allowed Clyde Beal and Al Ken
yon odds of "fifteen and owe half fifteen."
The latter won in straight sets, 8—6, 6—2.
In the semi-finals both matches were ex
ceedingly close, and in each the winning
team were victors after losing the first
set. Collier and Crowell allowed String
ham and Allen "fifteen" and won, 3—6,
6—2, 6—2. The scratch men were slow to
start, but when once fairly under way
they won handily. The match between
Hunt and Code and Beal apd Kenyon was
a repetition of the preceding match. Beal
and Kenyon were allowed odds of "half
thirty" and won the first set. The next
two sets were taken easily by Smith and
Code. The score in their favor was 4—6,
6-2, 6-L
The final match between Collier and
Crowell and Smith and Code was the best
of the day. The former allowed the latter
odds of "fifteen" and won, 6—4, 2—6, 6—0.
Young Smith played a fine game in this
match, especially in the first and second
sets. His efforts left him tired in the last
set. His smashing was swift and his
drives well placed.
In a practice match A. W. Worthington
beat Joe Daily, 6—0. 6—0, 6—0. The winner
has been improving rapidly of late, and
although his style is peculiar it is effec
tive. Worthington allowed Mr. Hendry
odds of "thirty" and was beaten, 2 — 6, 6—4,
7—5.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1901.
STRIKES OUT HEAVY HITTERS
OF THE HOflE TEAM CLEVERLY
&^yv3 EN thousand spectators ; saw
I Waddell, the' wizard
1 1 pitcher, make a spectacle of the
II heavy batsmen of the San Fran-
cisco baseball team yesterday at
Recreation Park. He struck out twelve
men, showing wonderful control over the
ball, together with astonishing speed. The
game was won by the visitors by a
score of 4 to 2. .
V The fielding of the home team could
hardly have been worse, some of the
errors being at once costly and inex
cusable. For a moment in the last inning
it seemed the Wasps might tie the score,
Schwartz and Krug lining out two-bag
gers. Tne net resuu was one run ana tne
game was over.
The crowd iormed a fringe around the
entire field. Berore piay commenced it
was agreed tnat a hit into tne crowd
would mean a two-Dagger ana a wild
tnrow wouiu entitle a runner to one base.
The spectators overflowed the grounds
in every direction. Long before the game
commenced tne management ceased sell
ing uckets.as iheavaiiaoie stanuing room
was occupied. It is estimated nearly
three thousand people were turned away
irom the Kates.
Wadaell outshone all the other Eastern
stars. In the sixth inning "Jfoungey"
Johnson was sent out to coach in an en
deavor to rattle "Kube." The two base
ball comedians tried to outdo one another
in amusing the spectators and succeeded
admirably. When "Rube" found the new
man on tne coachers' line he gravely bow
ed and took off his cap. Later in the
inning he walked over and shook hands
with Johnson. •
After the game some spectator threw
a cushion onto the field from the stand.
Another and then another was thrown
until the air was filled with the harmless
missiles. They were thrown back into
the grand stand and returned again; In'
the metee a policeman's helmet was
knocked off. i Its owner added to the
hilarity of the occasion by chasing a
small boy In and out among the thou
sands of spectators who had ma'de their
way. to the field. No arrests.
The All-Americas scored their first run
in the fourth. Barrett, the first man up
hit past Iburg, the ball bounding off his
glove and out toward Krug. Barrett was
safe before it could be fielded to first.
Mercer was safe on Shay's fumble. La
joie hit to Shay and forced Barrett at
third. Davis flew to deep left field and
Mercer scored on the throw in. Bradley
hit to shortstop and was out, retiring the
side. \
Waddell rang up a tally in the fifth
through Parke Wilson's dropping the ball
when he had the eccentric Easterner safe
ly out. Irwin was the first batter up and
sent the ball straight into Nordyke's
hands at first. Sullivan was safe on
Shay's juggling of his hit. Waddell sin
gled. Pickering hit to pitcher, who threw
Sullivan out at third. Barrett singled
and Waddell came home on the play.
Wilson had the ball in ample time to put
him out. and the spectators Thought he
had done so until it was seen he had
dropped the ball. Pickering moved up to
third on Reilly's fumble. Mercer ended
the trouble by going out on a fly.
Two runs were scored in the sixth
Krug's error being a factor in the play.
Lajoie, the great, started proceedings
by flying cut. Davis singled, being safe
on Nordyke dropping the ball at first
base. Bradley singled, sending Davis to
third. Irwin was hit by the pitcher, fill
ing the bases. Sullivan singled to short
stop and Shay tossed the ball easily to
Krug. The latter dropped the ball and
did not see where it rolled. Before it

Southern Reservation In
dians in a Sad Pre
dicament.
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 8.— In about three
weeks the Department of . Indian Affairs
at Washington will have laid before it a
report from Major James •• McLaughlin
and Indian Agent Wright, on which will
be based a decision as to what Is to be
done With the Indians at present in the
reservation on Warner's ra.nch.
These Indians In five reservations—
Puerta La Cruz, Mataguay, Puerta Chi
clta, San Jose and Agua Caliente— must
be moved soon, for the decision of the
Supreme Federal Court is that the, land
belongs to J. Downey Harvey of Los An
geles, and that the Government never had
a right to locate the reservations on the
ranch.
The case of the Indians on the San Fe
lipe ranch is practically the same, though
the decision of the court has not yet been
written. Major McLaughlin states that
the Government has given up the Idea
that there is any Government land In this
section of the country which Is. suitable
for a reservation, for every piece of land
that is tillable has long since been taken
by white settlers and even some of the
reservations, as they are now located, are
on the sides of mountains where the In
dians have a hard time to exist. .
The two officials have been making a
"ten days' trip through the valleys of San
Diego County looking at certain lands
which had been considered - suitable for
reservations, and which had been offered
to the Government. At least 2000 acres. of
areable land is wanted with a water sup
ply that can be used for Irrigation. Two
or three suitable locations have * been
found on the trip and the two agents have

could be recovered Davis' and Bradley
had made good use of their time and had
scored. Waddell struck out and Irwin
was caught out at the home plate In an
attempt at a double steal. The ball was
sent down to second to head off a runner
and was. returned in time to catch Irwin.
The home team scored their first run in
the sixth. Reilly flew to shortstop and
Iburg struck out. Nordyke, the hero nf
Saturday's game, was next at bat. He
hit the ball in the same direction as that
taken by it on Saturday when he sent It
over the fence. This time it struck the
wrong side of the fence and fell among
the spectators. Under the ground rules
in force he was allowed only two bases
on the hit.
Wilson followed with a* single to Ir
win. The latter fell and rolled "over sev
eral times In his efforts to catch and field
the ball. Nordyke scored before Irwin
recovered. Hildebrand hit to the pitcher
and was out.
Schwartz scored the second and last
run for the Wasps in the ninth. Hilde
brand was the first man up and was
thrown out at first by Bradley. Schwartz
lined ' out a two-bagger. Pabst flew to
center and Krug singled, scoring
Schwartz. Shay flew out, ending the
game.
On Wednesday afternoc.i the same
teams will t>lay. the only change being in
the pitcher's department. Bernhard will
be in the box for the visitors and Whalen
for the home team. On Thursday and
Friday the visitors will play the Oaklands
and on Saturday and Sunday the Sacra
mento team will cross bats with them.

ANGELS WIN DOWN SOUTH.
Heavy Hitting Defeats the National
League Team.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 8.— Five thousand
people saw ,Morley's heavv hitters take
the second baseball game from the Na
tionals by a score of -9 to 2. It was. a
game, full of batting, clever fielding and
constant kicking. ' Both teams took turns
objecting against Decker's decisions.
Some of the objections were not without
cause. Decker appeared erratic on balls
and strikes. "Buck" Francks took Steln
feld's place at short and played a bril
liant game. His fielding of a liner from
HamphilFs bat In the seventh was a
clever piece of work. Hulen played third
for the visitors, McHale going to left
field. Van Haltren appeared off in his
fielding, two errors being marked up
against him. - •
The Angels commenced scoring in the
first inning. Hemphill singled, House
holder walked, and Kihm's hit to left
went past McHale, scoring Hemphill and
Householder. Hall lined out a high one
to center, which Van Haltren fumbled.
Hall stole second, and Chance's wild
throw allowed Kihm to score. Reilly fol
lowed' with a safe hit to left field, scor
ing Hall. Again in the sixth and sev
enth Innings the Los Angeles batters fell
on Doyle's curves, and five men made
their bases. In the seventh Klhm sent
the ball soaring far above the left field
fence for a home run. Hall also dropped
a three-bagger in center field.
Hartwell's nervousness allowed the Na
tionals to make three runs in the fourth.
He became rattled and threw wild to
first instead of catching Hulen at the
plate. He steadied down, however, and,
with good support, held the visitors
down until' the seventh, vhen Dougher
ty's error in letting McHale's single go
under the fence cost three runs. Bat
teries—Hartwell and Spies, Doyle and
Chance.
NEW DYNAMITE
GUN IS TESTED
Board of Army Officers
Will Make Report to
Government.
SAVANNAH. Ga.,' Dec. 8.-The test" of
the. new pneumatic dynamite gun at Hil
ton Head, S. C, yesterday under the
auspices of a board of army officers is be
lieved to have been satisfactory. Major
Ira'McNutt of the ordnance department
was chief officer of the board. The gun
is at the entrance to Port Royal harbor,
which it commands. It shows that the
gun has a range of 6000 yards. Eight
projectiles loaded with explosive gelatin
were fired. Six of them exploded upon
impact and threw columns of water into
the air. Two were fired with time fuses.
If they were exploded it was at such a
depth under water that there was no dis
turbance discernible. The explosive
charges ranged from 50 to 200 pounds of
nltro-gelatln. Five dummies were fired to
test the speed. The Government required
that they should be discharged in twenty
minutes.. The time taken, to fire them was
ten and one-half minutes." Forty dum
mies of 1180 pounds each were then fired.
There was no hitch. .
Train Crushes His Leg.
REDDING, Dec. 8.— Frank E. Whipple.
a resident of Eureka and employed at the
Tellurium mine, at Middle Creek, lost the
lower part of his right leg this morning
in a train accident. He was walking
along. the track as a fast freight train
approached from behind. He thought it
was on the main track and sprang upon
the siding. The wheels passed over his
right leg at the calf. He will recover.
Boarding house fare isn't a board of
health.
