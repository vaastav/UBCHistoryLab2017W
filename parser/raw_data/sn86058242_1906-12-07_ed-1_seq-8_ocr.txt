Washington, Dec. 7. The senate
adopted the Penrose resolution request
ing the president to send it informa
tion regarding the discharge of the
negro troops of the Twenty-fifth In
fantry, and also the Foraker resolution
directing the secretary of war to trans
mit all information in the possession
of his department on the same sub
ject. Doth resolutions carried an iden
tical amendment by Cnllerson asking
specifically for the order to Major
Penrose commanding the troops which
directed him not to turn over to the
Texas authorities certain of the troops
demanded.
President Has a Fixed Opinion.
There was a discussion as to wheth
er the request should be made to the
president or to the secretary of war,
and a report was current in the cham
ber that the president felt so strongly
about the matter that if the request
was not made to him there would bo
no response at all. To lay the founda
tion for a discussion of this point Car
ter observed that "It had been alleged,
and not denied" that the troops In
question had committed murder In
Texas. This brought Foraker to his
feet with an emphatic disclaimer. This
allegation had been denied, he said,
and much evidence adduced, to sup
port the denial.
Foraker Produces the Record.
"Wei!," continued Carter, "it has
been alleged and not denied that there
wis a disturbance participated in by
troops."
"That, too, has been denied," as
serted Foraker.
"Wei!," again begun Carter, "it has
been alleged mid not denied that there
was a disturbance." Foraker produced
a printed copy of testimony in the
ease which he had obtained at the
war department, extracts of which he
read to show, as he said, that It was
"unsausiactory, incomplete and or a
flimsy character ana that no Jury In
Christendom" would convict under it.
night of Trial Ignored ?
Foraker rend at length the testi
mony supplied by the war department.
ITe said it appeared that murder, mis
prison of felony and perjury had been
committed by some one three crimes
for the punishment of any one of
which the constitution secured to every
in an the right of trial before punish
ment. Nothing of particular interest
took place during the remainder of the
debate, and at its conclusion both reso
lutions were adopted, as stated above.

BRYAN REBUKES ROOSEVELT
"Shame Upon Him," Ho Says, for Be
ing So Warlike Navy Not the
Best Peace Preserver.
Lincoln, Neb., Dec 7. Commenting
on President Itoosevelt's message Wil
liam J. Bryan says there Is much that
is good and much that fs bad in it.
but It may bo regarded as the presi
dent's most important state paper.
"The message contains much that is
Democratic and for which the gener
al public may well thank him. It
contains some things that ought to
arouse severe criticism."
Among these latter is the president's
"warlike attitude." "He speaks of the
navy," t aid Bryan, "as the surest guar
antor of peace which this cxmntry pos
sesses. Shame upon the chief execu
tive that be should place an instru
ment of brute force above the nation's
sense of justice as a guarantor of
peace. The best guarantor of peace
is our nation's principle to deal justly
with other nations. War ought to be
a last resort, not a first consideration."
