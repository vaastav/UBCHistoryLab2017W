The case of Vietti vs. Nesbitt Bros, v
nnnnluded and submitted to the court at
four o'clock in the afternoon of Friday last,
Judge Talbot announced that he would take
the case under advisement and render

The case of C. Lytle and others vs. Jos.

Friday was pay for the DeLamar Co. for
the month of November, consequently the
town has been somewhat lively the past
week.
Nesbitt & Bro., have a small force of men
at work on the Cedar Springs ditching from
one spring to another and concentrating the
water all at one point with a view to piping
it to town shortly.
District Attorney Culverwell was brought
over from Meadow Valley Wash on Tuesday
quite ill, having Buffered a relapse since his
sickness of two weeks ago. He is regarded
as in a dangerous condition.
The weather this week has been uniformly
bad. This is the first good day of the week,
wind, snow, hail and rain predominating up
to this time. No trace of snow remains
however, except on the mountaiu sides.
The strangers to this climate from the far
north must hegiu to have a good opinion of
it as compared with the eections from
whence they came. The bad weather of
this week it the worst we have and it isn't
a ciruumstanne to what they have been ac
customed to.
When the cold and storm struck us, the
water pipe of the DeLamar Company was
about ready to be tested, none of the pipe
being covered over. The cold has been in
tense enough to freeze the water in many
places and it is believed considerable of the
pipe will be injured beyond repair.
The leasers on the Gold Cup report a fine
body of ore in the north drift from the
bottom of the fifty-foot shuft. This drift is
seventy -five feet in length and all in ore
averaging nearly $40 in gold. No ore is
being taken out except which is actually
neceasary. All the work now being done is
to thoroughly develop the property. There
is about fifteen tons of this grade of ore on
the dump. Lode.
The Strikers Acquitted.
J. C. March, Thos Clcary, Chas. Kappler,
Sam Howard aud James Cummings, the
strikers who have been on trial at Carson
for several days were acquitted by the U. S.
jury, says toe lteno Journal, lhe case was
submitted during the latter part of the day,
and the jury, after twenty minutes ilelibcra
tion, brought in a unanimous verdict of not
guilty. The citizens of Carson were so
jubilant over the result of the trial that
they rang the fire bells, fired anvils and
otherwise celebrated. This ends the
matter and notwithstanding that every
effort has been made to convict the defen
danta it has proved a failure after two
tedious trials.

In the case of J. M. Zion vs. the Southern
Pacific, at Reno recently, a verdiot was
rendered yesterday awarding the defendant
$1,700. Mr. Zion was put off a S. P. train
oy a conductor who had suspicions that he
was riding on a scalpers ticket. The ticket
was genuine however, and Zion brought
suit to recover $0,000 damages. The jury
brought in a verdict of $1,700 damages for
the plaintiff. Virginia Enterprise.
It is quite evident that there are still
some men in Nevada who don't exactly
understand how to vote the Australian
ballot. In the recount in Humboldt county
twenty-eight votes were cast at Rebel Creek,
and not one of them had the narrow per
forated strip with the number on torn off.
This is in direct violation of the law, as a
simple reference to the poll book would show
how every man voted. The Commiasioners
decided that the Rebel Creek ballots were
legal and connted them.
If President Cleveland and Secretary
Carlisle were in earnest ia suggesting a plan
of currency reform for adoption during the
present session of Congress they should un
questionably borrow the charter of the bank
of England as a model. Under the English
system new notes can only be issued in ex
change for an equal value of gold deposited
in the bauk of England. This being the
case it follows, as a matter of course, that
President and Mr. Carlisle are only trying
to distract Congress from the consideration
of the importance to reopening our mints to
the free coinage of Bilver by advocating a
banking plan which they would be the first
to condemn if Congress showed any disposi
tion to accept it. Reno Gazette.

The Hartley Case.
The case of the State vs. Alice M.
Hartley came up on the 7th inst. W. E. F.
Deal and District Attorney Curler appear
ing for the State and Judge Goodwin, E. R.
Dodge and R. M. Clarke for the defendant.
Mrs. Hartley was not present. The ques
tion arose regarding the rendering of a de
cision on the motion for a new trial in the
absence of the defendant from court.
Physicians' certificates were offered, show
ing that Mrs. Hartley was physically unable
to be in oourt, the matter was then post
poned until 9 o'clock Saturday morning.
A large orowd was present in the court-room
at the time set. The arguments on the
motion for a new trial and also on a motion
in arrest of judgment were continued all
the forenoon. In the afternoon Judge
Cheney took the case under advisement
until the 12th. when bis decision will be
rendered. Reno Journal.
The Kingman (Ariz.) Miner says that the
White Hills Company have a batter showing
in the lower level of the Occident mine than
ever. The mill ia turning out bullion and
shipping about $25,000 to Denver every
mouth.
The San Francisco Call says the Wellman
Peck & Co. firm propose to run mule teams
between their stores in San Francisco and
their branch store in Fresno until such times
as the Southern Pacific Company may
establish fair rates. One of the firm is re
ported as saying: "We paid them (the
Southern Pacific) thousands of dollars for
carrying our canned goods to Fresno at the
75-cent rate when the rate on the same class
of goods from New York to this place was
only 50 cents." This is a condition of things
that Mr. Irving M. Scott might study to ad.
vantage. Some days ago Mr. Scott was
commenting upon the absurdity of a fruit-
producing state like California importing its
canned fruit. We see now the reason, or at
least one of the reasons, A railroad com
pany which pretends to be working in the
interest of California brings canned fruit
from New York at a less charge than it
makes from San Francisco to Fresno.
Senator Stewart, when called upon for
his opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury's
scheme to give the banks complete control
of the currency, which the President rec
commmended in his message to Congress,
said: "The financial plan in Cleveland's
message, stripped of verbiage, means that
the United States shall give bankers $75 for
$22.50. Any bank that will deposit $22.50
of legal tender, whether greenbacks or
treasury notes, will receive $75 of our Gov
ernment money a cunning way of retiring
greenbacks." Reno Journal.
Before his last election to the Presidency,
Mr. Cleveland was constant, in season and
out of season, in telling the country how the
rich were getting richer and the poor poorer
under the Republican protective policy.
What a pity it is that he found no space in
his voluminous and platitudinous message
to tell his fellow oitizens how both the rich
and the poor hare been getting poorer ever
since his party obtained absolute control of
the legislative and executive branches of the
Government.
Edison says there is practically no limit
to the speed that can be attained on a rail
road. He thinks the greatest speed will
come when electricity is obtained direct
from coal.
