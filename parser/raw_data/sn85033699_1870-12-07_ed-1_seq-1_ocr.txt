"The plans of Congress seem to
been this: The Government issued
its bonds to a company which was to
a company which was
build a road through a wilderness, which
would need to exhaust every available
means to complete the work, which
would have little income until it was com
pleted. Confidence was felt in tho ulti
mate value of the whole work when onca
brought into perfect and full operation.
A mortgage was taken upon the whole
property to secure the payment of the
bonds, principal and interest, at their
mat&ity, which' would be thirty
years after their date. In the meantime
the compensation for services rendered
tho Government from the beginning, and
the annual percentage of the net receipts
of the road after its completion, were to
be applied toward the discharge of the
interest as far as it would go, and to the
principal as the bonds successively ma
tured if there should be accidentally any
surplus, but no other provision for cur
rent interest was stipulated or designed to
be made, because none could be made
without hampering the feeble and strug
gling enterprise. The United States agreed
to pay interest on the bonds
semi-annually, because such payment
was important to their market value;
but this implies nothing to tho terms
on which the credit of tho government,
or rather its pecuniary aid, was furnished
to the railroad company. These terms
were promised, with such security as the
company could give to repay the loan of
bonds, and in the meantime to appropri
ate certain specific funds toward the pay
ment so far as they would go."
The decision of the present Attorney
General will not be forthcoming for some

SENATE.
Washington, Dec 6. Several bills,
were introduced, when the Senate ad
joumedjin order to complete an informal
revision of standing committees.
Bills were introduced as follows: By

delegate to Congress from the Indian Ter-
By Mr. Scott, to repeal so much of tho
act of July 14, 1870, as continues the in
aime tax after Dec. 81, 1869.
By Mr. Fenton, authorizing the Post

HOUSE.
Messrs. Frank Morni, of Louisiana,
Chas. II. Holmes, of New Trork, and
Wm. P. Wolf, of Iowa, appeared and
jtook the oath.
Mr. nill introduced a bill to repeal the
income tax. Referred to the Committee
on Ways and Means.
Similar bills were introduced by Messrs.
KeUogg and Myers.
First Grab of tho Land Sharks.
A bill passed by the Senate at the last
session extending the time for the con
ttruction of a Railroad from St Croix
River or Lake to the west end of Lake
Superior and to Bayfield, came up as the
regular order of business in the' morning
hour. It extends the terms of the grant
for seven years, from the 1st of May,
1869; provided, that thirty miles be com
pleted within eighteen months, and
thirty miles every year thereafter. The
bill was explained by Messrs. Wilson, of
Minn., and Washburn, of Wis., who
stated that the length of road was ori
ginally 350 miles and nearly 200 miles
hive already been completed and in run
ning order, the remainder under contract,
and that the quantity of land required
will be about 1,000,000 acres.
Mr. wood opposed the but denouncing
the swindling system by which the public
lands had been given away to private
corporations.
Mr. Julian desired to have tho bill
amended so as to exfjudc timbered land
from the grant
Mr. Lawrence desired to have coal and
iron lands excluded, and to require the
railroad to sell the land to actual settlers
only, and in quantities not exceeding a
quarter section, at not exceeding $2.50
an acre.
Mr. Wilson argued that it was now ad
mitted that the public lands should go to
actual settlers. Congress should adopt
that policy which would prove most ad
vantageous to settlers and that was the
opening up ot communications by rau
road. After further discussion the bill was
laid on the table.
Mr. Logan gave notice that he would,
tin Wednesday, move to suspend the rules
and pass a bill abolishing the offices of
admiral and vice admiial of the navy, the
former at once and the latter when a vn-

the church. Seats for the family were
reserved in front, and it was arranged that
afkr the family should follow the bride
and groom, and tho knot should at once
be tied.
At the appointed time the four youuger
daughters arrived m a carnage, and said
to the sexton : "Give us the seats reserved
for the family." This he did, and by
some cruel mistaKe the next carnage con
tained the pair about to be married, when,
according to previous arrangement, the
mother and a friend should have next ar
rived. Tho young lady, feeling that
should any mistake occur whereby her
mother would be deprived of witnessing
tho ceremony, said to the sexton : "Have
the family arrived ?"
, Being answered in the affirmative, the
happy couple walked up the aisle to
where the minister wa3 in waiting, and
the knot was quietly tied. As the newly
married pair were leaving thb church
they met the mother of the bride in the
vestibule. The old lady threw up her
arms and cried aloud, "Oh, Sarah, what
have you been doing?" Tho daughter
then discovered the mistake, burst into
tears, and throwing herself on her moth
er's breast, exclaimed: "Mother, mother,
I have been getting married," and the two
wept as if their hearts would break.
The guests atirst feared that the young
wife was tnken suddenly ill, but when
they learned tho cauf e of the ridiculous
exhibition, they laughed as heartily as tho
otners nau cnea.

SKILLET DEAD.
Skillet Htys, a negro long and well
known in our community, was buried on
last Saturday. He came to his death by
being thrown from a riding thing called a
"Flying Jenny' which broke one of the
cords in his neck. Skillet was a great
cook and hunter, and has served up many
a winter night's supper for the young
men of otir place Wo partook of his
last on to-night one week ago. "lie vfas
formerly the slave of Dr. John B. Hays.
His correct name was Osyorne, and nick
named "Skillet" from the following inci
dent: John M. Cook, commonly called
OThus," was for sixteen years our
$wn constable, and during the days of
slavery was a diligent officer in the dis
charge of his duties, consequently a ter
$r to the negro who transgressed the
laws. On one occasion he heard of Skil
let being out from home (at the ringing of
the 9 o'clock p. m. bell the law required
all negroes to be in their quarters.) Cook
went to the house where he was at, but
on entering Skillet made his exit through
a window unseen by Cook. Some one
suggested that he might be under a skil
let sitting in the room, and old man Cook
actually lifted the skillet to see whether
he was or nor. 'From that time Os.
Hays was known tis Skillet.
On Saturday we had several
BUNAWAY8,
one of which was the cause of a very
serious accident. It appears that a num
ber of young ladies at one of our public
schools decided on a iamble in tho woods.
For this purpose two cars were provided
to convey them to the woods. While
out we learn that one of the cars was
backed over a bluff, throwing the young
ladies out, some of whom were consider
ably bruised. On their return to the
school, as soon ashe young ladies had all
gotton out of the car, the horses became
frightened, broke and run, passing out of
the school yard to the Mt. Pleasant Pike,
which they took down in wild flight to
the fcquare, across the square and down
South Main street to the alley upon
which Mr A. Barrresides, to whom the
team belonged Hero it was thought
they would stop, but not so, they con
tinue in their mad flight down the alley to
Embargo street, then down Embargo
to Mechanic, dewn it to Glade, from
Glade to the fence on the river, down to
the river, thence up the river some hun
dred yards io fin island, and yet not a
thing about the car to which they wero
attached or the harness upon them,
strange to say, wa3 in the least damaged.:
As they came down West Market, a
gendeman whose name we did not leani
ran in front of and endeavored to stop
them; they ran over and hurt him very
seriously. They also ran over a negro on
South Main street, but did him no harm.
BAPTISING.
The colored Missionary Baptht3 had
till another baptising on last Sunday,
ten persons being immersed. One of the
largest crowds were present on the banks
of old Duck that wo ever witnessed,
composed mainly of the whites, and that
solemnity which should exist on such
occasions seemed manifest in this one.
A warm religious feeling is evidently pre
vailing in our community, not with blacks
only, but also with the whites.

We wore informed yesterday, by a gen

day, from a trip over the Nashville and
Northwestern Railroad, that on Monday
.'evening, about five o'clock, a very exten
sive fire was in progress along the line of
that railroad, about eight mites ont irom
this city, and that about one hundred acres
of forest had been bumed. It is supposed
that the fire caught from the sparks of a
locomotive, as it seemed to have started
from the railroad track, and was advancing
away from it up the side of a steep hilt.
The trains were not, at the time we refer
to, incommoded in any manner, as tho fire
had died out near the track.

by Aid. Carter, favoring some allowance
by way of compromise to the 10th ward,
bnt Btatmrr that he was not willing to
make a full surrender of all points to the
loth ward. The minority report was re
ceived but not acted upon, as the majority
report was not presented. Jlr. Carter
stated that the majority were in favor of
releasing the 10th ward from the payment
of all taxes, and of alio wing that ward to
enter the city as one of the wards on the
1st ot next January, and commence pay
log taxes then, thus releasing the Win
ward from the payment 01 aliaaxes previ
ous to Jan. 1, 1871.
Alderman Smith, Chairman of the Street
Committee, reported in regard to the
recommendation of the Mayor concerning
plank sidewalks, that he had instructed the
Street Ore.seer to repair the sidewalks in
the city, and that the material.? which had
been contracted for would be delivered
within the present week. The report of
said committee was concurred in.
The Street Committee further reported
that Franklin Street would be metaled as
soon as the necessary material could be
obtained, and that the grade at the junc
tion of South Union and High streets
would be modified, as prayed in a petition
referred to them.
HNFINISED BUSINESS.

rETxnons.
Several petitions to erect frame houses
and reduce assessments were presented and
appropriately referred or disposed of.
A petition from about forty business
firms of Nashville was presented, pray
ing the Board to repeal or revoke the
law allowing city dramming, as this law
allowed drummers to deceive strangers and
annoy other merchants, besides being a
nuisance to old and upright business men
Becorder Haile remarked that these
drummers caused him considerable annoy -J
auce, and that they gave nse to numerous
complaints.
On motion of Alderman Smith, a com
mittee of three was appointed to draft a
bill to cover tho case, and the following
Aldermen were named as such committee :
Messrs. Carter, Smith and Wilkinson.
A petition was received from Mrs. C. T.
Ames, relict of CoL Ames who was lately
killed in Georgia, praying the Board to
allow her the privilege of exhibiting the
animals belonging to the circus, until such
time as the said animals could be sold,
such exhibition being for the purpose of
paying expenses. The petition'etated that
Mrs. Ames, who is staying at lanes s Mo
tel, did not feel like incurring the heavy
expense of obtaining a regular license, and
merely wished to exhibit tho animals until
Buch time es they could be sold.
Kocorder llano said that he understood
from the fisent of the circus that said cir
cus would probably remain hero all win-
tor.
The prayer of the petitioner was grant
ed, and Mrs. Ames was allowed to exhibit
her circus until otherwise ordered by the
Board ol Aldermen or the Mayor,
A bill to erect five gas .posts on South

A petition from about ten merchants

firmer fire crackers and squibs on holidays,
as to allow torpedoes and fire crackers to
be fired off id' back yards and alleys.
Alderman Simmons presented a bill in
accordance with the request of the above.
named petitions, on which considerable
debate ensued. Some members were in
favor of allowing the juveniles to fire off
crackers on tho holidays, while others op
Dosedit. Jt was urged by one or two
members that firing these squibs and fire
crackers in the back yards and alloys would
be more dangerous than to lire them
publio streets, as they weuld be liable to
fire barns and other property. The bill
passed its first reading, and on suspension
of the rules, after a vain attempt to kill the
bill by referring it to the Committee on
Tire Department, and by moving to ad
ionrn. the bill was read a third and last
time and passed.
The bill allows the sale of fire-cracker

Aside from the regular stealings and

Several cases have just come to light in
which Postmaster Embry was atiomoted to
be made tho medium, and sundry mer
chants the victims of these sharp practices.
On last Friday night a well dressed, and
apparently genteel young man, stepped
into the store of Mr. Thompson, hatter,
No. 14 Cherry street, and with a perfect
degree of nonchalance, asked if an order
on Postmaster Embry was good for a hat.
The reply was yes. The young man, who
gave his name as George Everson,
and represented himself as connected
with the pos' office, said he wanted
the hat for his brother, and called
another young man in who was
represented as boaring that relationship.
The hat was furnished, when the first
party said he believed he would take one
himself. The second hat was also given,
the order furnished, cfind tho two yonng
men.relirod. After they had gone out sus
picion became excited by the salesman
that they bad probably been duped. Search
for the young men was at once instituted
and they wore found festively engaged in
a game of billiards at the Maxwell House.
One of the salesmen told the party
calling himself Everson ot his suspicions.
"Oh, it is my brother who stays at the
postoffice," he said. The salesman took
them back into the stoie, and had them
tae off the new hats and put on their
old ones, and accompany him to the post
office, when, if all right, they could re
turn and get their new ones. When
they got near the postoffis one
of the young msn suddenly turned
around saying, "This thing has gone
far enough, we don't stay at the post
office; you can keep your hats." With this
the parties made off and havo not since
been identified.
A suit of clothes was obtained from Mr.
Powers on the Stjuare, through the medium
of similar representations and forged
orders, and on Monday night Mr. Bassett
was duped out of supper in a like manner.
We hear of a number of other cases, of
parties representing themselves as connec
ted with the postoffice, in order to obtain
various articles and valuables. These
parties are still atdarge and the public is
thus put on their guard against them. It
ia due to the postoffice to say that no one
connected with that institution ia suspected
of complicity in these nefarious transac
tions. .

CatamoBBti, etc.
We have noticed for a day or two past a
young man from the rural districts carry
ing about in a box a four-months old catai
mount, which he "showed" for & dollar
per crowd. His account of the struggle he
experienced in its capture was nothing
short of chilling blood- curdling. Speak
ing of this animal so ferocious and un
compromising in its character "reminds
us of a little story," wherein the writer
figured, unfortunately, as one of the star
actors. About a year .agone, while pre
ambulaling in the virgin forests of another
land, we came suddenly upon one of this
precise breed of cats. The catamount wo
thus surprised, however, was quite large
enough to have been the patriarch of ih'"
one in the box, and as selfish a' looking
creature as one could possibly imagine.
As bad luck would have it, we were un
armed, excepting our jack-km'fe, which
possessed but one broken blade. The in
tervening space between ourself and the
other catamount, too, was not to exceed
three rods, and the greeting was likely to
be as prompt as it would be affectionate.
For once in our life wa considered before
acting, and for a moment or two stood
fixed and thoughtful. The animal seemed
similarly affected, and also seemed to be
trying to. conclude whether to run away
and lire to fight another day, or fight it
ont on that line, and on that date.
He stood, immovably eyeing us with his
large round eyes, his great shaggy head
puffed up and revealing teeth that seemed
set for business, and but little shorter than
his villainous finger nails. As for ourself
we could scarcely settle upon a lino of pol
icy, and sort of unvojuntarlly commenced
to enumerate the sins we had committed,
from the cradle up to the time '.we met
that catamount, and found the debt aide
quite too much the longest to render com
fort possible under the existing circum
stances, and ,'as the only resort to bring a
balance we thought over "Now I lay me
down to sloep" with unusual fervour. Af
ter weighing matters over as philosophi
cally as possible, we found the chances de
cidedly in favor of the opposite party, and
the only proper question then, before this
meeting, was to get cut of the pendiog re
sponsibility of a war in the easiest way
possible. As to the catamount's opinion
of the situation we have never been ad
vised, but subsequent developments seem
ed to prove that he also was inclined to
"draw it mild." Onr body felt; fully in
clined to concur in this joint resolution,
bnt doubted the policy. Finally, however,
the legs carried , and as a body we resolv
ed to run away from that catamount or die
in the attempt; the resolution was "put,"
and there probably was never such a re
markable case of tall stepping since Put
nam's feat as wo exhibited in that retreat,
and wo never did sea that genus cat any

into hubs and spokes. The boys will please
remember this, and stay out of places where
they have no business in.

Pierce. The ceremony was performed
according to the impressive ritual of the
Catholic Church, by the iiight iwv. rsisn-
opFeeharj. of this Diocese, which is as

ous entertainment which followed, a su

happiest of the kind that has ever occur

Something- Elegant.
Among recent arrivals at the literar
emoorium of Messrs. W. T. Berry & Co.
we notice some beautiful Madonna", after
the old masters, wrought on porcelain, in
colors, and encased in elegant gut upright
frames. Uae, in particular an immacu
late Conception of Murillo arrested our
admiration. For a parlor ornament we
could imagine nothing so chaste and f c-
chanting. A visit to the Messrs. Berry is
always a positivo pleasure, for they are
constantly adding to their rich literary
treasures and rare articles of vertu.
Personating an Officer.
John Davis, colored, was arraigned be
fore Justice Baskette yesterday, on the
chaige of personating an officer in serving
a warrant without sufficient authority It
seems that he was deputized by Justice
Sumner, but failed to show the proper pa
tiers. He was bound over to the Criminal
Court alter a full investigation. It seems
to us that there are a sufficient number of
lawful constables in the city to do all the
work without deputizing so many out
riders.
