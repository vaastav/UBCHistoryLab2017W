The President's Message.
the 47th
The last session of
congress met at eleven o'clock on
the 4th inst. The presidential
message was immediately read.
It is a mediocre document, feeble
in tone and negative in effect,
being chiefly icmarkable for what
it leaves unsaid. It opens with a
view of our foreign relations,
gives a brief resume of the
financial status of the country, and
in reference to the present exorbi
tant taxation, and resulting sur
plus makes the following excel
lent observatiens:
"For the fiscal year ended June
30, 1S82, the surplus revenue
amounted to $100,000,000. For
the fiscal year ending on the 30th
of June last the surplus was more
than $145,000,000. The report of
the secretary shows wiiat disposi
tion has been made of these moneys.
They have not only answered the
requirements of the sinking fund,
but have afforded a large balance
applicable to other reductions of
the public debt. I renew the ex
pression of my conviction that
such rapid extinguishment of the
national indebtedness as now
taking place is in no measure a
cause of congratulation. It is a
cause rather for serious apprehen
sion. If it continues it must speedily
be followed by one of the civil
issues so clearly set forth in the re
port of the secretary. Either the
surplus must be idle in the treasury
or the government will be forced
to buy at market rates bonds not
redeemable and which, under such
circumstances, cannot fail to com
mand an enormous premium, or
the swollen revenues will be de
voted to extravagant expendi
ture, which, as experience has
taught, is ever the bane of an over
flowing treasury."
In reference to to future bills
for domestic improvement, now
generally lumped together under
the title of "River and Haibor
bill," President Arthur suggests:
"Is it not advisable that grants
of considerable sums of money for
divers independent schemes of
international improvement should
be made the subject of separate
and distinct legislative enactment?
It will scarcely be gainsaid, even
by those who favor the most liberal
expenditures, for such purposes as
are sought to be accomplished by
what is commonly called the river
and harbor bill, that the practice
of grouping in such a bill appro
priations for a great diversity of
objects widely separated, either in
their natures or localities, or in
both, is one which is- much to be
deprecated, unless it is necessary
to secure the success of the bill as
a whole, though many of the
items, if scparateby considered,
could scarcely fail of rejection."
Talking of cheap postage, he
says:
"At the last session of congress
several bills were introduced in
the house of representatives for
the reduction of letter postage to
two cents per half ounce. I have
given much study and reflection
to this subject, and am thoroughly
persuaded that such reduction
would be for the best interests of
the public. It has been the policy
of the government from its foun
dation to defiay as far as possible
the expenses of carrying the mails
by a direct tax in the form of post
age. It has never been claimed,
however, that this service ought
to be productive as a net revenue.
As has been stated already, the
report of the postmaster-general
shows that there is now a very con
siderable surplus in this depatt
ment, and that henceforth the re
ceipts are likely to increase at a
mucb greater rate than the neces
sary expenditure unless some
change is made in the existing
laws, and the profits of the postal
service will in a very few years
swell the revenue of the govern
ment many millions of dollars.
The time seems auspicious for
some reduction in the rates of
postage."
The message is below the aver
age of state papers and is the
poorest production of the kind
since Grant's message in 1875.

Tin: Portland Standard, in a
discussion of the admission of cer
tain territories, makes the singular
assertion that in the case of Utah,
"It would be much easier to deal
with the institutions of Utah as a
state than as a territory." This
statement is in direct opposition
to the facts. If the Standard is
anything at all politically, it is in i
favor oi state sovereignty, .inl
would bo the first to fall in ihe
wake of the 2s cw York World,
which has been praising polygamy
and excusing its adherents for the
last six months. Any community
cursed by such a practice as
polygamy should never be admit
ted to the Union. It is not a
question of congressional icpre
sentation, but of public morality.
A Caiuo despatch of the -JUi
says: Arabi Pasha this morning
pleaded guilty to the charge of re
bellion. In the afternoon the
court martial reassembled and
pionounccd sentence of death.
The khedive commuted the sent
ence to exile for life. It is be
lieved that Arabi will retire to
some part of the British domin
ions. His demeanor before the
court was very dignified. Other
chiefs of the rebellion will be
similarly disposed of. It is now
reported Arabi will be sent to the
Cape of Good Hope.

Ax attempt was made 'to pre
vent any unnecessary labor on the
Sabbath" in New York last Sun
day. Bootblacks, barbers, news
boys and milkmen were arrested.
Saloon-keepers, who did not have
sufficient political influence to dely
the code,were also gathered in. The
result was confusion. A spasmodic
attempt of that kind is made in large
cities every few years. In Cincin
nati the Mayor was once instruct
ed to enforce the Sunday law. The
ordinance was that "no one shall
work on Sunday." The honest
man was not acquainted with the
English language and started to
do what he was told. He arrest
