THE IRESIDExT'S MESSAGE.
FrXT.OW-ClTTZFNg OF THE Sf.SATE AND
House or IIepuesentatives:
I congratulate you on tl:e continued
end inrreivung prosjierity of our coun

we have been hle.-sed, during tho past
year, with wealth, wkh abundant har
vests, with pn fi able employment tor
all our prople, and with contentment at
hotufl, nnd with peace and friendship
with olhrr nations.
The oceurnnee of the twenty-fourth
election of chief nin.rsisirn'e has afl'-inU'd
another opportunity to the people of the
United States to exhibit to the world a
significant exi.mple of the peneetnl nnd
Bate transmission of the power and au
thority ol Roverrm.'Dt from the public
servants whose terms of nflico are about
to expire, to their newly chosen sue.
cessors. Th'S example cannot fail to
impress profoundly thoughtful people
ol other countries with the advantages
which reiubliean institutions nffml.
Tho imnndiat", eeneral and cheerful
acquiescence ot all pood citizens In the
result of the election, trives gratifying
assurance to our country, nnd to its
friends throughout the world, thai a
government b:tstd on the free consent of
an intetliirent nnd patriot" people"oop
sesais citnitnts ot strenitti), stability
end permanenry r.rit kuad iu any other
form of government.
Continued oi vosition to the full and
free n jovnu'iit of tho righ's of cit.zen
ehip, e.m'err. d upon the colored people
bv the recent amendments to the Con
s'.itutt' n, still prevails in several of iho
late Bi.-ivehuld inn States. Ith:i3, perhaps,
not been m iuliestej in tue recent elec
tion to any kmc extent in acts of vio
lence or i;:timidi:liii. It h is, however,
by i"r:ni'ii;it nt praelieca in connection
with tho biillots, wiiii the regulations
as to the places nnd manner of voting,
and with counting, returning and can
vassing the votes cast, been successful
in deiealing ihe cs"rir-e of the right
preservative of all riahts, the right of
suffrage, which the Constitution ex
pressly confers upon our enfranchised
citizens.
It is tin desire of the good people of
the who'c country th'it sectionalism as
a factor in our politics should disnppear.
They p-ofer that no section of t lie coun
try should ba united in solid opposition
to any other section Ti e iiirosit, on to
refuse a promt t and lnr.riy obedience to
the equal rights iinieiid.i.ent.i to the
Constitution, is nil til it now st tnds in
the way of a complete ohii. (ration of
sectional linrs in our political contests.
As long as ri J;er of these amendments
13 lligruntly viol .ted or disreerriid, it
is safe to assume that the people who
imced tin iu ui tin' U i stiliition, as CM
lodvinir th" Witiuuile resuiis of tne
war for tl.cUnio'i.and who huiievethem
to be wise n-. ces-nry will co itinue
to act toteUier nnd to insist thai they
shall be obeyed. The paramount ques
tion still i-t, as to the enjoyment oi the
right by every American citizen win has
tho requisite qualifications to freely cast
his voteaud to have it honestly counted.
With this question rightly settlid the
country will be relieved of the conten
tions ot the pad; bygones will indeed
bo bygones; and political and party is

Buppoitnll v, hoiiiaiiit ain i n auihovity of
thegoveruuieiitund uie iierpeiuity of the
Union, and who adequately appiciate
the value of the victory achieved. This
determination proceeds irom no hostile
Ecntitnent or feelina to ary part of the
people of our country, or to any of their
interests. The in rio. ability of the
I'.rucndments rests uwn the fundamental
principle of our government. They are
tho solemn expression ot the will of the
oeoplo of the Uiiited Saves.
The sentiment that the constitutional
rights ot all our citiz 'lis must be main
tained, does not grow weaker. It will
continue. 1.0 control tho govtrnment of
the country. Happily, the history of
the lato election shows that in many
parts of the country where opposition to
the lilieenih nru' iidmeiit has hentofore
prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely
to cease altogether, it firm and we;i. con
sidered action is t:ik -n by Convivss. 1
trust the House of K -preservatives and
the Senate, which have the riht to
judge of tho elections, returns, and
qualifications of their own members,
will Bee to it that e.cry case of vio
lation of the letter or spirit of the fif
teenth uuier.u mrnt is Uiorouhl in
vestigated, and that no benefit from
sucu violaii in sh-il: acruo to any person
or pany. I; wili on the duty of the
Et cutive, wiiii s.ffluent appropria
tions tor tho purpo.-e, to prosecute un
sparingly all v." no have been engaged in
depriving citizens ot the rights guaran
teed to them by tin. Constitution.
Ic is not, however, to be forgotten
that the best and surest giif-nutee of
the primary rights of citizenship is to
be found in th it capacity for seif-pro-tection
which can b slong only to a peo-'
pie whose right to universal suffrage is
supported by universal educatioa. The
means at the command of the local and
Stale authorities nr..', in many cases,
wholly inadequate t lurnish freo in
struction to ail whii need it. This is
especially true where, before emancipa
tion, the education ot the people was
neglected or prevented, in the interest
of slavery. Firmly convinced that tue
subject of popular education deserves
the earnest attention of the people of
the whole country, with a view to wise
and comprehensive action by the gov
ernment of the United Stales, I respect
fully recommend that Cjsgress, by
suitable legislation and with proper
safeguards, supplement the local educa
tional lunds in the several States where
the grave duties and responsibilities of
citizenship have been devolved on un
educated people, by devoting to the pur
pose grants of the public lands, and, if
necessary, by appropriations from the
treasury of the United Slates. 'Whatever
government can tuirly cto to promote free
popular education ought to be done.
Where vi r general education is found,
peace, virtue, and social order prevail,
and civil nnd religious liberty are se
cure. In my former annual messages, I have
asked the attention of Congress to the
urgent necessity of a reformation of the
eivil system of the governme.it. My
views concerning the dangers of patron
age, or appointments lor pprsonal or
partisan considerations, Lave been
strengthened by my observation and
experience in the Executive office, and I
believe these dangers threaten the sta
bility of the government. Abuses so
serious in their nature cannot be perma-'
qenlly tolerated. They tend to become
more alarming with the enlargement of
administrative service, as the growth of
the country in population increases the
number of officers and placemen em
ployed. The reasons nre imperative for the
adoption of tixed rules for the regulation
of appointments, promotions and re
movals, establishing a uniform method
Laving x -lasively in view, in every in
stance, the attainment of the best quali
fications for the position in question.
Such a method alone is consistent with
the equal rights of all citizens, and the
most economical and eflicient adminis
tration oi the publi i business.
Competitive examinations in aid of
impartial appointments and promotions
have been conducted for some years
past in several ot the executive depart
ments, and by my direction this system
hna been adopted in the custom houses
nnd postoflices of the larger cities of the
country. In the city of New York over
two thousand Dositions in the civil ser
vice have been subject, in theirappoint
ments and tenure of placo, to the opera
tions of published rules for this purpose
during the past two years. The results
of these practical trials Lave been very
satisfactory, and have confirmed my
opinion in favor of this system of
selection. All arc subjected to the
same tests, and the result is free
from prejudice by personal favor or
partisan influence. It secures for the
position applied for the best qualifi
cations attainable among thcconipeting
applicants. It is an effectual protection
from the pressure of importunity which,
uuder any other course pursued, largely
exacts the time and attention of ap
pointing c.fiicers, to thiir groat detri
ment in the discharge of oilier official
duties, preventing the abuse of the
service tor the mere furtherance of pri
vate or party purposes, and leaving the
employee of the government, freed from
the obligations imposed by patronage, to
depend solely upon merit for retention
and advancement, and with this con
stant iucentive to exertion and im
provement. These invaluable results li?.ve been
attained in a high degree iu the offices
wheie tho rules for appointment by
competitive examination have been ap
plied. A method which has so appioved it
Eell by experimental tests at points
where such tests may be fairly con
sidered conclusive, should be extended
to all subordinate positions under the
government. I believe that a strong
and growing public sentiment demands
immediate measures for se:uting and
enforcing the highest possible efficiency
in the civil serv e", nnd its protection
from recognized abuses, nni that the
experience relerred to has demonstrated
th feasibility of such measures.
The ex ruinations in the custom
Iiourcs nnd postoflices bave been held
under many embarrassments and with
out provision for compensation for the
extra labor performed by tlie officers
who have conducted them, and whose
commendable interest in tho improve
ment of the public service has induced
tiiis devotisn of tiino and labor without
pecuniary reward. A continuance
ot these labors gratuitously ought
not to bo expected, and without
an appropriation by Congress for com
pensation, it is not practicable to ex
tend the systems of examinations gener
ally throughout the civil service. It is
also hii'hly important that all such ex
aminations should be conducted upon a
uniform srstem and under uenr-r.U tuper
vision. S ction 1.753 of the revised
statutes authorizes the President to pre
scribe the regulations tor admission to
the civil service of the United States,
and for this purpose to employ suitable
persona to conduct the requisite in
quiries with reference to "the funess of
each candidate, in respect to age, health,
character, knowlednc and ability for the
branch of service into which he se -ks to
enter;" but the law is practically in
operative tor want of the requisite ap
propriation. I therfore recommend an appropria
tion of S25.O00 per annum to meet; the
expenses or' a commission, to be ap
pointed by the President in accordance
with the terms of this section, whose
duty it shall be to devise a just, unilorm,
and efficient system of competitive ex
aminations, and to superviso the appli
cation of the same throughout tho en
tire civil service of the government. I
am persuaded that the facilities which
such a commission will afford for test
ing tho fitness of those who apply for
omVe will not only be as welcome a
re:ief to members of Congress as it wili
be to the President and heads of depart
ments, but that it will also greatly tend
to remove the causes of embarrarsment
which now inevitably and constantly
attend the conflicting claims ot patron
age between the legislative and execu
tive departments. The most effectual
check upon the pernicious competition
of influence and rfflcial favoritism, in
the bestowal of office, wi 1 be the sub
stitution of an open competition of merit
between the applicants, in which every
one can make his own record with the
assurance that his success will depend
upon this alone.
I also recummend such legislation as,
while leaving every officer as free as any
oth-r citizen to express his political
opinions and to use his means tor their
advancement, shall also enable him to
feel as sale as any private citizen in re
fusing all demands upon nts salary lor
political purposes. A law which should
thus guarantee true liberty and justice
to all who are engaged in the publio
service, and likewise contain contingent
provisions against the use of ofli ial au
thority to coerce the political action of
private cit z-us or of official subordi
nates, is greaily to be desired.
The most serious obstacle, however,
to an improvement ot the civil service,
and especially to a reform in the method
ot appointment and removal, has been
found to be the practice under what is
known as the spoils system, by which
tue appointing power has been so largely
encroached upon by members of Con
gress. The first step in tho reform of
the crrril service must be a complete di
vorce between Congress and the Execu
tive in the matter of appointments.
The corrupting doctrine that "to the
viotors belong the spoils," is insepar
able from Congressional patronage as the
established rule and practice of parties
in power. It comes to be underst ood by
applicants for ffi 'e, nnd by the people
geugraliy, that It 'preventatives and Sena'
tors are entitled to disburse tho patron
age of their respective districts and
Sta es. It is not necessary to recite at
length the evils resulting from this
invasion of the Executive functions.
The true principles of government on
the subject of appointments tocfll;e, ai
stated in the national conventions of
the leading parties ot the country, have
again and again been approved by the
American people, and have not been
cuHod in question in any quarter. These
ithentio expressions ol publio opinion
upon this all-important subject, are tne
statement of principles that belong to
the constitutional strueture of the gov
ernment. ' Uuuer the Constitution the Presi
dent and heads of ciepHrtmen's are to
make nominations for oiuoe. lue sen
ate is to adviso and consent to appoint
ments, and the lljue ot Rjpresentatives
is to accuse and prosecute faithless offi
cers. The best interest of the public
service demands that these distinctions
be respected ; that Senators and Repre
sentatives, who may bo j iriges and ac
cusers, should not diclato appointments
to office." To this enJ the co-operation
of the legislative department of the gov
ernment is r quired alike by the necessi
ties of the case and by pub is opinion.
Members ot Congress will not be relieved
from the demands nmdaupon them with
reference to nppoin ments to office until,
by legislative enactment, the pernicious
practice is condemned and forbidden.
It is therefore recommended that an
net be passed defining the relations ot
members of Coneress with respect to
appointment to office by the President,
and I also recommend that the pro
visions of section 1.7C7. nnd of the sec
tions following, of the revised statutes,
coniprisins the tenure-of-oflice act, of
March 2, 1867, be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system
and methods of the civil service in our
country is one of the highest and most
imrerative duties of statesmanship, and
that it can be permanently done only by
the co-operation of tho legislative and
execu ive departments of the govern
ment, I asrfiin cemmend the whole sub
ject, to your considerate attention.
It is the recognizsd duty and purpose
of the people of the United Slates to sup
press polygamy where it now exists In
our Territories, and to prevent its ex
tension. Faithful and jseilous efforts
have been made by the United S.ates
authorities in Utah to eufoice tho laws
against it. Experience has shown that
tlie legislation upon this subj.-ct, to be
effective, requires exfr' nsive modification
and amendment. The longer action
is delayed, the more difficult it
will bo to a omplish what is do
sired. Prompt and decided meas
ures are necessary. The Mormon
sectarian organization which upholds
polygamy has the whole power of mak
ing and executing the local legislation
ot the Territory. Bv its control of the
grand and petit juries it possesses largo
intluence over the administration of jus
tice. Exercising, as ttie heads of this
sect do, the locai political power of the
Territory, they are able to m ke effect
ive their ho3'.ility to the law of Congress
on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact,
do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will not be abolished it the enforcement
of the law depends on those who prac
tice and uphold the crime. It can only
oe suppressed by taking away the po
litical power of tho sect which encour
aces aud sustains it. The power of
Congress to enuct suitable laws to
protect tho Territories is ample.
It is not a caso for hallway
measures. The political power of
the Mormon sect is inorensing; it con
trols one of our wealthiest and most
populous Territories. It is extend
ing steadily into other Territories.
Wherever it goes it establishes
polygamy and sectarian political
power. The sanclty of marriage
and the family relation are the
coiT.cr stone of our American socie'.y
and civilization. KeSigious liberty aad
tho separation of church and State nre
among the elementary ideas of free in
stitutions. To re-establish the interests
and principles which polygamy and
Mormonism have imperiled, and to
luily reopen to intelligent and virtuous
emigrants of all creeds that part ot our
domain which has been, in a great do
giee, closed to general emigration by i l
tolerant and immoral institutions, it is
re?ommendnd that the go verntnent)of the
Territory of Utah be reorganiz d. '
I recommend that Cimgress provide
for the government ot Utah by a gov
ernor and judges, or commissioners, ap
pointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate a government analogous
to the provisional government estab
lished for the Territory northwest, ot the
Ohio, by the otdina"co of 1787. If,
ho -ever, it is deemed best to continue
the existing form of local government, 1
reo mmend thnt the rivbt to vote, hold
olli 'e and sit on juries in the Territory
of Utah, be confined to those who
neither practice nor uphold polygamy.
If thorough measures are adopted, it is
believed that within a few years the
evilt which now afflict Utah will be
eradicated, and that this Territory will
in good time become one of the most
prosperous and attractive of the ne
States of the Union.
Our relations with all foreign coun
tries have been those of undisturbed
peace, and have presented no occasion
for cone rn as to their continued main
tenance. Mv anticipation of an early reply from
the British government to the demand
ofinaenity to our fishermen for the
injuries suffered by that industry at
Fortune bay, in January, 1&78, which I
expressed in my last annual message,
was disappointed. This answer was
received only in the latter part of April
in tho present year, and, when received,
exhibited a failure of accord between
the two governments, as to the measure
of the inshore fishine privilege secured
to our fishermen by the treaty of
Washington, of so serious a character
that I made it the subject of a communi
cation to Congress, in which I recom
mended the adopt on of the measures
which seemed to me proper to be taken
by this government in maintenance of
the rights accorded to our fishermen un
der the treaty, and toward securing an
indemnity for the injury these interests
had suffered. A bill to carry out these
recommendations was under consider
ation by the ifouse of Representatives
?.t the time of the adjournment of Con
gress in June last.
Within a few weeks I have received
a communication from her majesty's
government, renewing the consideration
of the subject, both of the indeoiity of
the injuries at Fortune bay, and of the
interpretation of the treaty in which
the previous correspondence had shown
the two governments to be at vai iance.
Upon both these topics the disposition
toward a friendly agreement is mani
fested by a recognition of our right to
an indemnity for the transaction at For
tuuo bay, leaving the measure ot such
indemnity to further conference, and by
an assent to the view of this govern
ment, presented in the previous corre
spondence, that the regulation of con
flicting in'ereits of the shore-fishery of
tue provincial sea coas'S, ana tne vessel
fishery of our fishermen, should be
made the subject of conference and oon
current arrangement between the two
governments.
I sincerely hope that the basis may be
found for a speedy adjustment oi the
very serious divergence of views la the
interpretation of the fishery clauses of
the treaty of Washington, which, as the
correspondence between the two gov
ernments stood at the close of the last
session of Congress, seemed to be irre
concilable. In tho important exhibition of arts
and industries, which wns held last year
at Sydney, New South Wul?s. as weil as
in that now in progress at Melb urne,
the United States have been tfliuently
and honorably represented. The exhib
itors from this country at the former
place received a largo number of awards
in some of the most, considerable de-
Bartments, and the participation of tho
Inited States was recognized by a
special mark of distinction. In the
exhibition at Melbourne, the share
taken by our couu'ry is no less notable,
and an equal degree of success is confi
dently expected.
The state ot peace and tranquillity
now enjoyed by all tho nations of the
continent of Europe has its iavorable
influence upon our diplomatic and com
mercial relations with them. We have
concluded and ratified a convention with
the French republic for the settlement
of claims of the citizens of either count' y
againstj the other. Under this conven
tion a commission, presided over by a
distinguished publicist, appointed, in
pursuance of the request of both nations.
by his majesty the emperor of Brar.il,
has been organized and has begun its
sessions in this city, A congress to
consider means for the prot cvion of in
dustrial property has recently been in
session in Paris, to which I have ap
pointed tho ministers of the United
States in France and Belgium ns dele
gates. Tho international commission
upon weights and measures also con
tinues its work in Paris. I invite your
attention to the necessity of an appro
priation to bo maae in ime to enable
this government to comply with its obli
gations under the metrical convention.
Our friendly relations with the Ger
mauempir contiuue without interrup
tion. At the recent international exhi
bition of fish and fisheries at Betlin, the
participation of the U.ited States, not
withstanding tho haste wi- li which the
commission was forced to make its
preparations, was extremely successful
and meritorious, winning for piivate ex
hibitors numerous awards of a high
class, and for the country at large the
priuci pal prize of honor offered by his
majesty the emperor. The results of
this great success cannot but be advan
tageous to this important and growing
industry. There have been some ques
tions raised between the two govern
ments as to the proper effect and inter
pretation of our tresties of naturaliza
tion, but recent dispatches from our
minister at Berlin show that favorable
progress is making toward iu under
standing, in accordanco with the views
ot this government, which makes nnd
admits no distinction whatever between
the rights of a native and a naturalized
citizen of the United States. In practice,
the complaints of molestation suffered
by naturalized citizens abroad have
never been fewer than at present.
There is nothing of importance to note
in our unbroken u-teniiy relations witu
the governments of Austria-Hungary,
Russia, Portugal, Sweden and Norway,
Sw tz rland, Turkey and Greece.
1 Hiring the last summer several vessels
beloneing to the merchant marine of this
our try, sailing in neutral waters of tho
VY'est Indies, were lined at, boarded,
and searched by an armed cruiser of the
Spanish government. The circumstan
ces a i reported, involve not oul a pri
vaie in jury to t he persons concerned, but
i s seemed too little observant of he
'Vhndly relations existing for a century
between this country and Spain. Toe
wrong was brought to the attention cf
the Spanish government in a serious
jrotest and remonstrance, aud tue mat
ler i3 undergoing lavcstigatioa by tho
royal authorities, with a view to such
cxpUuauoa or reparation us may be
e:iil:d for by tho facts.
The comoiission sitting iu tins city lor
the adjudication of claims of our citi
zens against the government ot Spain,
is, I hope, approaching tue termination
of ii 3 labors.
The claiiu3 against the United States
under the Florida treaty with Spain
were submitted to Congress for its ac
tion at the late session, and I again in
vito your attention to this long standing
question, with a view to a final disposi
tion ot the matter.
At the invitation of the Spanish gov
ernment, a conference has recently been
held at the city of Madrid to consider
tho subject of protection by foreign
powers of native Moors in the empire of
Morocco. The minister of the United
States, in Spain, wat directed to take
part in the deliberations of this confer
ence, the result of which is a convention
Bigned on behalf of all the powers rep
resented. The ins'.tument will bo laid
before the Senate tori's consideration.
The government ot the Uaited States hs
also lost no opportunity to urgo upon
that of the emperor of Morocco the
necessity, in accordance with the hu
mane and enlightened spirit of the age,
of putting an end to th persecutions,
which have been so pievaleut in that
country, of persons of a faith other than
the Moslem, ami especially ol tlie lie
brew residents of Morocco.
The consular treaty concluded with
Belgium has not yet been officially pro
mulgated, owing to tho alteration of a
word in the text by the Senate of tho
United Spates, which occasioned a delav,
during which the tiiU3 allowed for ratifi
cation expired. The Senate will ba
asked to extend the period for ratifi
cation. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of
extradition with Denmark failed on ac
count of the objection ot tho Danish
government to the usual clause provi '.
ing that each nation should pay the ex
pense of the arrest of the persons whose
extradition it asks.
The provision made by Congress, at
it3 last sfssion, for the expense of the
commission which had been appointed
to enter upon negotiations with the im
perial government of China, on subjects
of great interests to the relations of the
two countries, enabled the cowmiss on
ers to proceed ut once upon their mis
sion. The imperial government was
prepared to give prompt and respectful
attention to the matters brought under
negotiation, and the conferences pros
cecded with such rapidity and success
that, on November 17 last, two treaties
were signed at Pekin. one relating to
the introduction of Cuiuese into this
country, and one relating to conmerce.
Mr. Trescot, one of the commissioners,
is now on his way homo bringing the
treaties, and it is expected tht they
will bi received in season to be laid
before tin Senate early in January.
Our minister in Japan has negot ated
a convention for the reciprocal relief of
shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion
to urge once more npon Congress the
propriety cf making provision for the
ciection of suitable fire-proof buildings
at the Japanese capital for the use of
the American legation, and the court
house and jail connected with it. The
Japanese government, with great gen
erosity and courtesy, has offered for this
purpose nn eligible pieco of land.
In my last annual message I invited
the attention of Congress to tho subject
of tho indemnitv funds received time
years ag from China nnd Japan . I re
new tlie recommendation then made,
that whntever portions of these funds
are dut to American citizens should be
promptly paid, and the residue re
turned to the nations, respectively, to
which they justly and equitably belong.
The extradition treaty with the king
dom of tlie Netherlands, which has been
for some time in course of negotiation,
has, during the past year, been con
cltricd and duly ratified.
U.'Jaticnsof friendship and amity have
been established between the govern
ment of the United States and that of
Roumania. Wo have sent a diplomatic
representative to Bucharest, and have
received at this capital the special envoy,
who has been charged by his royal high
ness Prince Charles, to announce the
independent sovereianty of Rmniania.
Wo hope for a speedy development of
commercial relations between tho two
countries.
In my last annual message I expressed
the hope that the prevalence of quiet
on the border between this coun
try and Mexico would soon become
so assured as to justify the modifi
cation of the orders, then in force,
to our military rommanders, in re
gard to crossing the frontier, without
encouraging eucii disturbances as would
endanger the peace of the two coun
tries. Events moved in accoroance with
these expectations, and the orders were
accordingly withdrawn, to the entire
e-visfaetion ot our own citizens and the
Mexican government. Subsequently the
peace ol tho border was again disturbed
bv a savnge foray, under the command
of the Chief Victorio, but, by the com
bined and harmonious action of the
military fo ces of both countries his
band has b?en broken up nnd substan
tially destroyed.
There is reason to believe that the
obMtael's which have so long prevented
vapid and convenient communication
lift veen the United States and Mexico
by railways, nre on the piint of dis
appearing, and that several important
enterprises of this character will soon
b.' set on font which cannot fail to con
tribute largely to tho prosperity of both
couriii i s.
The condition of the financial affairs
of the government, as shown by the re
port of the secretary of the treasury, is
very satisfactory. It ia believed that
the present financial situation of the
United States, whether considered with
respect to trade, currency, credit, grow
ing wealth, or the extent and vari. ty of
duv resources, is more favorable than
that ot any other country of our time,
and has never been surpassed oy that
of any country nt any period of its his
tory. All our industries are thriving;
the rate of interest is low; new railroads
arc being constructed ; a vast emigra
tion is increasing our population, capi

It is fortunate that this large surplus
revenue occurs at a period when it may
be directly applied to the payment of t he
publio debt soon to be redeeuvible. No
pub io duty has been more constantly
cherished in the United States than the
poiicy of paying the nation's debt, as
rapidly as possible.
The debt of the United States, less
cash in the treasury and exclusive
of accruing interest, ntt lined its
maximum of $3 751 431 571 43 in
August, 1865, and has since that
time ben reiuced to $1,88(5,019,
6n4 f 5 O the priin'pil of tlio debt,
$1ih '5i 100 hai be n paid since March
1, 1S77. t-ft'. 'd in n nnnunl saving of in
terest of B li7 .V)3 The burden of in
terest has uUo b n diminished by the
sale ot bon s bearing a lo rate of in
terest, and the application of the pro
ceeds to the red mptionot bonds bearing
a higher ra'e. Tin an 't'l iavinr thus
senii od sinco March 1, 1677, is $11 230,
433.5:. Within a short period over $000,0(10,-
000 of five nnd six per cent, bonds will
becojjercdeem ibic. This presents a very
favorable opportunity notonlv to fur
ther reduce the principal of the debt,
but nlso to reduce the rate of interest on
that which will remain unpaid. I call
the attention of Congress to tho views
expressed on this su'lject by tho secre
tary o' the treasury In his annual report,
and recommend prorant legislation, to
enable the treasury department to com
plete tl.o refundiug of tho debt which is
about to mature.
The continuance of specie payments
has not been interrupted or endangered
since the date of resumption. It has
contributed greatly to the revival of
business and lo our remarkable pros
perity. The feurs that preceded and ac
companied resumption have proven
groundless. No considerable amount of
United States notes have been presented
for redemption, while very lar.o sums
ot gold bullion, both donvstic and im
ported, are taken to the mints and ex
changed for coin or nolcs. The increase
of coin and bullion in the United States
since J-mnavy 1, lt)7!l, is estimated r.'
$2;7.if:),4a8.
Tliure nru siill in exis'pnee, uncan
celed, $:4G,fisl,01G of United States
legal-tend r notes. These notes were
authorized as a wnr measure made
necessary by the exi.T'ncies of tho con
flict in which the United States was
then engaged. The preservation of tho
cation's existence required in the
judgment of Congress an issue of leeal
tendor paper money. That it eerved
well the purpose for which it was cre
ated is not questioned, but the employ
ment of the notes as paper money in
dcfii.iiely, after the accomplishment
of tho object for which they were
provided, was not contemplated
Dy tho franiers of the law
under which they are issued. These
notes long sinco became like any other
pecuniary obligation of the government
a debt to be paid, and, when paid, to
be canceled as mere evidence of an in
debtedness no longr existing. I there
fore r-'ppat what was said in the annual
messiige of l ist yen'-, tuit tho retirement
from circulation o; UaiSeS Ststes nutes,
with the capacity ot legui-under in
private contracts, is a step to be taken
in our progress toward a safe and stable
currency, which should be accepted as
the poiicy and duty of the government
aud the interest and security of the
people.
At the time of the passage of the act
now in force requiring the coinage of
silver dollars, fixing their valuo and
giving them legal-tender character, it
was believed by many of the supporters
of tlie meiisure that the silver dollar,
which it :iuthriz ;d, would speedily bo
come, under the operations of tlie law,
of equivalent value lo ibo gold dollar.
There were other supporters of the bill,
who, while they douided as to the prob
ability of this result, nevertheless were
willing to give the proposed experiment
1 fair trial, with a view to stop the
coinage, if experience should prove that
the ailvi r dollar authorized by the bill
continued to be of less commercial value
than the standard gold dollar.
The coinage of biiver dollars, under
the act referred to, began in M trch, 1878.
and has been continued as required by
the act. The aveiage rate per mmth to
tho present time has been 2 270 4:)2
The total 'amount coined tn ini- to Ibst
of November la was i; 72 8 17.75X Of
this n mount $47 031 45 i-iuain in the
treasury, and oniv 25 7ti3 2JI are in the
hands of the people. A eoustant ilf.irt
uas ueen made to keep tins currency in
circulation, and consider .bio expense
bus been necessarily incurred tor thi
purpose, but its return to tho treasury
is piompt and sure. Contrary to the
confident anticipation of tho friends ot
tho measure at the time of its adoption.
the value of the silver dollar, containing
4lv4 grains of silver, has not increased.
During the year prior to the passage of
the bill authorizing its coinage, the
market value of tho biiver which it con
tained was from ninety to ninety-two
cenis, as couipnred with the standard
gold dollar. Daring the Inst year the
average market vaiuo of tho silver dol
lar has bco l eighty-eight and a hali
cents.
It is obviou3 that tho legislation of
tho last Con gres3 in regard tosilvtr, so
far as it wai ba-ed on an untici.vated rise
in the value of (diver a a result of that
lesislation, has failed to produco the
ell'ect then predicted. The longer the.
law remains in force, requiring, as it
does, the coinage of a nominal dollar
which, in reality, is not a dollar, the
greater becomes the danger that this
couu ry will bo forncd to accept a
single metal as the sole legal standard
of vake in circulation, and this a
standard of less valu than it purports
to be worth in the recognized money
of the orld.
The Constitution of the United States
sound financial prine'pl ?s, and our best
interests, all require that tho country
should have as its legal-tender money,
both gold and silver coin, of an intiimio
value, a3 bullion, equivalent to that
which, upon iu face, it purports to
posses3. The Constitution, in exp.ess
terms, recogn.z 's both gild and silver as
the oniy true legal-tender money. To
banish either of theso metals from our
currency is to narrow and limit the cir
culating medium of exchange to the dis
paragement of important interests. The
Unite' Slates produces more silver than
any otber country, and is directly
interested in maintaining it as one
of the two precious metals which
furnish the coinage cf the world. It
will in my judgment .contribute to this
result if Congress will repeal S3 much
of existing legislation as requires tue
coinaxe ot silver dollars containing only
4121 grains of silver, and in its stead
will authorize the secretary of tho
treasury to coin silver dollars of equiv
alent value as bullion, with gold dollars.
This will defraud no man, and will be
in accordance with familiar precedents.
Congress on several occasions, has al
tered the ratio of value ho' ween gold
and silver, in order to establish it more
nearly in accordanco with tue actual
ratio of value between the two metals.
In financial legislation every measure
in the direction of greater fidelity in the
discharge of pecuniary obligations has
been found by experience to diminish
the rates of interest which debtorj are
required to payL and to increase the
facility with wntca money can be ob
tains! for every legititnato purpose.
Oir own recent Unancinl history shows
how sureiy money becomes abundant
whenever confidence in the exact per
formance of moneyed obligations is es
tablished. The secretary of war reports that tbs
expenditure! of tlie war denartment for
the fisee.l vear ended June 30. 1890, were
Stf i,,Ji,4.773.03. Tho appropriations for
this department, for tlie current hscal
year, amount to $41,993 6J0.40.
With repect to tje urray, the secre
tary invites attention to the fact that its
strensth is limited by statute (section
1,115. revised statutes) to not more than
3 1,000 enlisted men, but that provisos
contained in appropriation bills have
limited expenditures to the enlistment
of but E5 000. It is believed the full
leal rtrcngth. is the least possible foroe
at which the pre.-ent organization can
bo maintained, having in view effi
ciency, discipline and ccouomy. While
the enlistment of this force would add
somewhat to the appropriation for pay
of tho nr:iiy. tho saving made in o.her
respects would be more than an equiv
alent for ' his additional outl'iy, and the
elll dency of the army would bo largely
Increased.
1 commend to tlie attention of Con
gress tho great services of the com
mander in-chief of our armies during
the war for tlie Union, whose wiso, firm
and patriotic conduct did so much to
bring that momentous conflict to a close.
The legislation of the Uaited St ites con
tains many precedents for tho rccog-'
nition of distinguished military merit,
authorizing rank and emoluments to be
conferred for cminpnt services to the
country. An net of Congress authoriz
ing tlie appointment of a captain-general
of the army, with suitable provisions
relating to compensation, retirement and
other details, would, iu my judgment,
bo altogether fitting and proper, and
would oo warmly approved by the
country.
Tue report of the secretary of tlie navy
exhibits ihe successful and satisfactory
management of that department during
ttie last fiscal year. The total expendi
tures for the year were $12,910 039 45,
leaving unexpended at tiie close of the
year $j. 111,082 23 of tho amount of
available impropriations. The appro
priations t"r the rtrcsent nscnl veiir end
iEir Juno 30, 1881, are $15 095 06145:
nnd the total estimates for t;,e next, fiscal
year ending June 3), 1-82, are $15 953,
751.01. The nmouu drawu by warrant
fi:-.i July 1. 1-80, to November 1, 1880,
is $5.1,41.570.45.
