AYaewsotw. Dec. 5. The annual re
port of the secretary of tho navy just
made public Is a document of unusual
Interest, dealing not only with tho
work of the navy during the past year,
and important recommendations for
future, hut also discussing important
questions relating to the navy, includ
ing tho authorization of 18 new war
ships, the imperative need of
special legislation in the early
days of congress for armor of the
best quality that can be obtained, and
the proposition that the thanks of
congress bo given to the commander-in-chief
of the North Atlantic squad
ron and to the oOlcera and men under
his command for the part they took In
tho naval operations at Santiago.
These larger Items of the report
receive extended attention at tho
hands of Secretary Long. As to the
ilnorease of the navy he says:
"Tho number of large, swift and
powerful armored cruisers of great
coal endurance in our navy is largely
disproportionate to the rest of the
naval establishment The experience
of the last year has also shown the
need of several smaller vessels, usually
classed as gunboats. It is therefore,
recommended that . congress bo re
quired to authorize the construction
of tho following vessels:
"First Three armored cruisers of '
about 18,000 tons trial displacement, j
of a maximum draft at deep load not
to exceed 20 feet, carrying the heaviest
armor-arid most powerful ordnance for
vessels of their class, to be so sheathed
-,-nnQ to hava the highest practicable
1 Vspeod. and.grcat radius of action.
"Second Twelve gunboats of about
flOt) tons trial displacement, to be
sheathed and coppered,
"And third, as recommended a yeni
ago, three protected cruisers of about
8,000 tons trial displacement, carrying
tho njost powerful ordnance for ves
sels of this clnbs, to be sheathed and
coppered and to have the highest
practical speed nml great radius oi
action."
, The secretary adds in this cominunl-j
cation that the 8,00p ton protected
cruisers are considered better adapted
to the present needs of tho navy.than'
tho 10,000 ton ships required last year, j
lie also asks that if sattsfnctqry bids
can no', be obtained for the new ships':
authority bo given to build them at
tho United States 'navy yards.

Dr. V. M. George,
Concerning more wr ships, the sec
retary says:
'The most Important question por
talrilng to naval construction at the
present time, and one that demands
prompt attention, Is that of tho armor
for vessels now building and for others
authorized but not yet contracted for,
on ascount of the provision in tho act
of March 3, 1609, prohibiting the
department from contracting for
the vessels therein authorized until
contract has been made for the armor
therefore within 000 a ton. The price
fixed is one for which even inferior
armor can not be obtained and the de
partment therefore has been unable to
invite proposals for tho three battle
ships and tho three armored cruisers
author zed by the act of March 3, 16S9.
"It Is urgently recommended thatln
the early days of its next session con
gress enact such spcc'al legislation, by
joint resolution., or otherwise, as may
bo necessary to enable the department
to make contracts early in ilio coming
year for 7,253 tons of armor of tho best
quality that can bo obtained in this
country for tho Elaine, Ohio and Mis
souri, and that the provls'on of the act
of March 3, 1800, limiting the price ol
armor to S300 per ton, and the restric
tion preventing the armored vessels
therein authorized from being con
tracted for until the armor therefor Is
contracted for, bo removed.
"Whatever may be the future action
of congress regarding the establish
ment of a government armor factory,
it can hardly affect the supply of armoi
for the Maine. Ohio and Missouri, as it
will under any circumstances bo im
practicable to obtain It from such a
source in reasonable time to complete
the vessels above referred to."

Detail or the Dottle of Modder niter
Have Not llenn Transmitted News
U Hx Days In Arreart
London, Dec 8. South African news
is now six days In arrears. The cen
sorship does not yet permit details of
!the Modder river battle to be trans
mitted. Somo vngue statements have
been published in the Cape Town pa
pers, and according to those the Boers
numbered 8,000 men and wero en
trenched on both banks of tho
stream, although mostly on the north
ern bank. Tho British, according to
those accounts, drove the enemy across
the river, compelling them to retreat
and establishing themselves on both
banks. These details, however, aro
too meagre to allow an accurate idea of
tho engagement to bo formed.
A dispatch has reached London an
nouncing that Lord Mcthucn Is again
in the field, and it is also said that
Count Glelchcn, who was wounded in
tho fighting at Modder river, was
struck by a bullet in the neck.
Serious nows comes from the north
ern sections of Cape Colony. The
wholo border district botween Coles
berg and Burghersdarp has declared
for the Boers. In Ventcrstad alone
more than 3,000 have joined the rebel
lion. The farmers have formed a

confidently of a triumphant march on
Capo Town. Qen. Butler's proclama
tion has been torn down and trampled
upon and tho loyalists are bidden to
hurry to Cape Town to prepare coffee

Utah, Was 'Postponed.
Qen. Henderson, of Iowa, Elected Speaker
of the Ilou.e Appropriate Itrsolu-
tlons raised on the Death of
Vise 1'roiUlent llobart.
WAsntNOTOX, Dec. G. Tho opening
of tho Fifty-sixth congress at noon
Monday attracted" that.wldesprcad at
tention which always attaches to the
annual assembling of tho national law
makers. There was added interest in
the event this year, for tho many far
reaching questions, awaiting consider
ation gave unusual importance to tho
return of congress. Aside from this,
the Roberts case introduced a phase
which promised something outsldo of
the ordinary developments of an open
ing day. , i
In the-shadow of the recent death,
the senate convened in its first session.
The death of Vieo President llobart
cast & pall over'the preliminary pro
ceedings at tho'nort'.i end of the great
marble capitol. Attention was called
to the fact that no' emblem of mourn
ing appeared on the vice president's
desk. This apparent omission was ex
CAN HE GET
plained by the statement that the sen
ate had not been Informed officially of
Mr. Hobart's death.
As usual on tho opening day of a ses
sion of congress, the chamber was a
veritable conservatory. Tho odor of
the rarest and lovltcst of blooming
plants was heavy on the air. Scarcely
a single senator'was forgotten In tho
lavish floral display.
Tho senate which la a continuous
body, was called to order by its presi
dent pro' tempore, Senator' William P.
Frye, of Maine. The proceedings were
brief. Thexredentiats of new mom-'
bers wero presented and those presenting-
themselves to .be sworn in
and against whom no objection
Is made, had the oath administered to
them. There was notice of contest
from West Virginia and Montana
against Senator Scott, of the formor
state, and Senator Clark, of the latter
state
Mr. Sewell, of New Jersey, then an
nounced tho death of Vice President;
llobart, and appropriate resolutions'
were passed.
At 12:35 the senate adjourned.
In tho house, as the mlnuto hand of
the clock over tho speaker's rostrum
overtook the other hand at noon, the
gavel of the clerk of the last house,
Maj. McDowell, descended with a
bang. The indescribablo buzz ceased,
Tho members arose and the spectators
In the galleries bowed their heads. In
this stillness the voice of tho blind
chaplain, Rev, Henry Couden, of
Michigan, was elevated and his prayer
made the occasion reverent.
After the invocation tho reading
clerk began calling the roll, and a
mlnuto later tho buzz had recom
menced, making a noisy background
for tho staccato notes of the cleric as
lie called out tho names.
After the roll was called it was
announced that a quorum was present.
Then the motion to proceed to the
election of a speaker was adopted and
Gen. Grosvenor nominated David
Bremner Henderson, of I?wa. This was
greeted with great applause and Mr.
Hay, of Virginia, nominated Mr, Rich
ardson, of Tennessee, and again there
was applause Mr, Bell, of Colorado,
was nominated by the populists, and
Miller, of Idaho, nominated Mr. New
lauds, of Nevada, for tho stlvcrltcs.
Then followed a long and tedious roll
call, tho members voting on party
linos, and Gen. Henderson was de
clared elected, whereupon tho house
burst Into applause.
When the name of Brlgham II. Rob
erts was reached in the house roll call,
the Utah member-elect proceeded alone
to the area In front of tho speaker's
desk and awaited the administration
of the oath. At the Bame time Repre
sentative Taylor, of Ohio, secured
recognition, and amidst breathless
stillness protested against the swear
ing of Roberts,- on the grounds
of his being a polygamlst
and not n properly naturalized Amer
ican citizen. Mr. Taylor spoko calmly
and dispassionately. Mr. Roberts
stood gazing Intently at him and not
even moving a muscle throughout the
protest Representative MeRao, of
Arkansas, followed with a' protost
from the democratic side, saying this
Issue was ono Involving the sacredness
of the American home, a sentiment
that brought an outburst of applause.
Speaker Henderson addressed Rob
erts, snying: "Will the gentleman
stand aside until the roll call is com
pleted?" Mr. Roberts assented, with the state
ment that in so doing he waived none
of his rights.
'I can assure tho gentleman," an
swered the speaker, "that he waives
none Of his rights by this course."
Mr. Roberts then resumed his seat
and the roll call proceeded.
It was agreed by unanimous consent
that the consideration of the resolu
tion should go over until Tuesday after
the reading of the president's message.
The swearing in of tho remaining
members was then concluded.
At 3:50 p. m. the house adjourned.

missioners of election met at 11:15
Monday. Judge Pryor, chairman of

of proceeding would be to take up tho
counties in order, those in which there
was any contest to be laid aside for
future consideration. As soon as the
board was ready Secretary of State
Finley turned over tho returns of
Adair county. Commissioner Ellis
asked at once If the counties wero
not to be turned over in a bunch.
Mr. Finley replied that ho conceived
it to be his duty to keep the
records In order, and ho preferred to
keep the proper check upon tho returns
by handing them out one by one, Tho
statues were called for and read by
Mr. Ellis, who insisted that all tho re
turns be turned over to tho board In a
bunch. After a short consultation
with his counsel, Mr. Flqley announced
that he would waive the point, and
handed over the entire state returns.
Adair county waB then taken up.
Tho commissioners established a pre
cedent in canvassing the vote of Brack
