The President in his message effectually
disposes of many charges made by Republi
can organs during the recent political
campaign.
There is not a journalist in the country
who does not agree with Henry George say
ing: "Among all the workers there are none
who work harder than the working news
paper man."
The largest day's work ever done in the
Pension Bureau was accomplished the 2d
inst. Forty lady clerks were employed
until midnight of that day in granting cer
tificates, and were sent home in carriages,
being too much exhausted to walk.
The Republicans generally claim that by
far the greatest part of the Labor party's
vote will be drawn from the Democratic
party. Such a claim is at least a confes
sion that the Republicans regard the Dem
ocratic party as at present much more of
a workingman's party than the Republi
can.
Late telegrams from Mexico give a some
what indefinite account of the capture of
the man who swindled the people of the
City of Mexico out of $30,000 by repre
senting himself as the agent of Mr, Abbey
of the Patti combination. It is thought a
large portion, if not all the money, wil be
recovered.
In speaking of the President's message,
the Helena Herald says: "The style is
clear and unambitious. The views are gen
erally sound and conservative. On the
whole we find more to commend than to
condemn." All of which is in striking con
trast with some other Republican journals
which can never see anything to commend
that comes from Mr. Cleveland.
At the solicitation of his many friends
Capt. Shepherd will be a candidate for
door-keeper of the lower House of the
Legislative Assembly which will convene
at Helena next month. The Captain is a
veteran in the ranks of the Democratic
party and he certainly deserves this slight
recognition at the hands of his party for
his life-long services within the ranks. The
House will doubtless favorably consider
the claims of the Captain, especially in
view of the fact that Silver Bow County,
the most populous county in the Terri
tory, asks so little from that body.
Mr, Bergh bas set an example of indiffer
ence to lucre that astonishes all the people
in the departments at Washington. It is
found that the Government owes him $131
which he declines to draw because he can
not remember that the Government
owes it. This sum is not one that may be
supposed to test to the utmost the passion
of cupidity, but yet it is enough to point
the moral that a man with a purpose is
nota money-worshipper. But there is a
precedent that we are afraid the course
taken by Mr. Bergh is likely to establish.
This is that to have forgotten a money ac
count is equivalent to a settlement. A rule
of this sort would completely ruin the mem
ory of many debtors.
The effort to organize the National Union
Labor party through a convention to be
held in Cincinnati on Washington's birth
day seeks to combine with the Knights of
Labor and trades unions the Greenback
Granger, soldier, Anti-Monopoly and
nearly all other industrial and minor po
litical organizations in one grand political
ollapodrida. If the union could be effect
ively made it would certainly possess ele
ments of great power. Whether the organ
ization as such can embark in so obviously
a political movement, and whether the ele
ments are not too incoherent, are doubts
that remain to be solved.
In the division of the labor in preparing
the President's message for publication in
this office, that portion of it containing his
remarks concerning silver coinage was
placed in the hands of an assistant to edit,
and upon his assurance that the question
of silver was not referred to, it was over
looked by the editor of this journal, and
the article to which our eveniug contempo
rary refers was written. When President
Arthur made the same recommendations
concerning the suspension of silver coinage
which appears in Mr. Cleveland's message,
the Inter Mountain heartily endorsed it
and cried lustily against the "dishonest
dollar," "the short-weight dollar" and the
"fraudulent dollar" of 412% grains. The
Miner made no such mistake. Its error
was an unimportant one. That of the In
ter Mountain consisted of a premeditated,
cold-blooded attack upon the prime inter
ests of Butte, for which there was no justi
fication. _

THE SIGNAL SERVICE.
Gen. Hazen, chief signal officer, has learned
something since he was first out in West
ern Dakota and reported the country west
of the Missouri river an arid desert unfit
for the habitation of man. He now pro
poses to reorganize the signal service in
which it is provided that a more extensive
system of the service shall cover the great
Northwest. He has submitted to the Sec
retary of War a plan in the shape of a care
fully prepared bill in which he proposes to
establish the signal service as a bureau of
the War Department, having charge of
weather predictions, army signal duty
and military telegraph lines. The officers
of the bureau, under Gen. Hazen's plan,
will be, as at present, a chief signal officer
with the rank of Brigadier Geueral, and
such commissioned officers, sergeants and
privates as are now provided by law. In
a communication to the Secretary of War
accompanying the proposed reorganization
Gen. Hazen Btates that the scheme is
prompted by experience and careful obser
vation. Whatever the signal service has
done and is now doing, he says, has been
the result of disconnected legislation, while
there is no doubt that the scope of its
work is thoroughly defined, it would seem
proper and of the highest importance that
its organization should be fixed and its
word defined by consecutive clauses under
one act of organization and establishment
without which the service will continue to,
be the subject of great embarrassment and
criticism.
Gen. Hazen thinks that some such plan
is necessary, as on several occasions the
legal status of the service has been called
into question, and an office charged with
carrying out important matters under
special acts of Congress should have' a
fixed and definite organization and a
proper (egal status.
8ILYER COEIAGE.
Tu Miner erred in stating that Mr.
Cleveland did not refer to silver coinage.
Unfortunately for himself he did, and for
tunately for the interests of the metal he
advanced no argument againet its contin
ued coinage which will bear dissection and
stand. Mr. Cleveland says that at the
close of the fiscal year there have been
coined under the Bland law 203,882,554
silver dollars. This is about $4 per capita
of the population of the country. The
continued coinageof silver would add nearly
50 cents per head. The President sees dan
ger in this fact and in the further tact that
our gold exportations have increased dur
ing the year. He also contends that we
now have an abundance of silver coin for
all our needs.
There are many matters upon which the
President is better informed than he is
upon the silver question. He has much
to learn in regard to it, if his remarks may
be regarded as the measure of his know!
edge of the subject. He employs the argu
ments of his Republican predecessors,
while facts disprove their soundness.
Mr. Cleveland, like all other gold mono
metallists, charges that the continued
coinage of silver will drive out gold from
the country. That was the favoritp argu
ment of the late ex-President Arthur
against the continued coinage ofjthe metal.
Yet we have all the gold we want in circu
lation, while there remains somewhere
in the neighborhood of $185,000,000 lying
idle in the United States Treasury, as
against $80,000,000 of silver beside it.
To sum it up in a few words, the whole
question presents itself in this wise: ' The
United States has a population of over
60,000,000. It has coined about 250,
000,000 standard silver dollars, or about
$4 per head of its population. It has less
than 80,000,000 of these standard silver
dollars in the Treasury unrepresented by
certificates, but at the rate certificates are
now being issued every idle Bilver dollar
will be circulating in the form of a paper
currency representing its value within the
next twelve months.
Now, if there be danger in this condition
of things, if gold is being driven from the
country by it, we would ask how has it
come to pass that during the last six or
eight months France, which is a bi-me* allie
country, has gained $36,000,000 of gold
by importation, while losing $430,000 in
silver? And why is it that France, with
$550,000,000 of silver legal tender money,
or $14 per bead, has been able to hold fast
to $850,000,000 of gold, or $22.50 per
head ? These are questions which are quite
pertinent in the discussion of this subject,
and in the answering of which gold mono
metallists are compelled to abandon their
theory that silver drives gold out of the
country.
Mr. Cleveland must advance more cogent
reasons for the suspension of silver coinage
to convince Congress of its necessity. In
his message touching this question he over
looked the fact that the calling in and pay
ing of the remaing outstanding 3 per cent,
bonds, the most of which are held by Na
tional banks as the basis of their circula
tion, will open a wider field for the circula
tion of silver and silver certificates by rea
son of many of these banks throwing up
their charters. They cannot afford to pur
case 4 or 4% per cents at the present pre
mium to secure their circulation, hence
many of them will pass in their charters
and their circulation be withdrawn, thus
affording room for a corresponding amount
of silver certificates. We still adhere to the
opinion that the coinagejof silverwill not be
disturbed during this session of Congress.
Before the gold bugs make any move to
ward this end they must first devise some
plan to keep National banks on their feet.
Already two bills have been introduced in
the House looking to the relief of these
banks. The silver men in that body are
masters of the situation and will so direct
legislation upon that and kindred subjects
as that the silver interests of the country
shall not be imperilled.

CHARLES A. V. CONYBEARE.
Speaking of this young Cornish Home
Rule member of Parliament, who will visit
Butte in the near future, the Centerville
Mining Journal has the following:
Hon. Charles A. V. Conybeare, who has
been twice elected by the workingmen of
Camborne division, Cornwall, England, to
represent them in the British House of
Commons, is one of the most promising
men in that body. Mr. Conybeare
is 32 years of age, and, although he
is very wealthy, he has taken the side
of the workingmen of Cornwall in every
question that has been brought before the
country*- He is an ardent supporter of
Mr. Gladstone's home rule policy. He is
an admirer of labor organizations, and has
materially assisted Cornishmen in the re
cent organization of a miners' union in
that county. During the last session of the
English Parliament Mr. Conybeare intro
duced a bill providing for the better pro
tection of miners working in the Cornish
mines.
A few days ago a gentleman of this place
received a letter from Mr. Conybeare stat
ing that it was his intention to visit Amer
ica shortly and see for himself the relations
that exist between capital and labor in
this country. He wants [to study the la
bor question in all its phases. It is his in
tention to visit Butte city, and while here
he will speak on the home rule policy and
the question of miners' unions. There is
probably no man that would receive such
cordial reception in Butte as would
Mr. Conybeare. He is a personal friend of
Mr. Parnell, in matters of business is closely
connected with Mr. Gladstone, and we be
lieve that if he visits us, Americans, Eng
lishmen and Irishmen would vie with each
other in doing him honor. His visit would
do much to cement in a firmer tie of friend
ship the people of two nationalities who
are now not working together with that
harmony that common interests demand
them to do. Let Mr. Conybeare come by
all means.
TOOLE AT WORK.
Delegate Toole appeared before the
House Committee on Territories, Wednes
day, and made an argument in favor of
the admission of Montana as a State.
The gentleman, doubtless, stated that the
last election developed the fact that the
Territory has the requisite population to
entitle it to a representation in the lower
House; that it is abundantly able to meet
the expenses and assume the responsibili
ties of statehood; that it is out of debt,
and that its great resources justify the
presumption it can maintain a State gov
ernment without imposing onerous taxes
upon its citizens. These are facts suscept
ible of proof, and nothing more is required
by any rule or precedent established for
the admission of Territories as States.
While the House would unquestionably
admit Montana upon Mr. Toole's showing
the Republican Senate would require the
assurance that two Republican United
States Senators would be sent from Mon
tana to Washington to maintain the su
premacy of that party in the upper branch
of Congress. Of course this assurance
cannot be given and a bill for its admis
sion would fail to pass that body during
thiss sesion unless the same bill provide
for the admission of a pronounced Repub- 1
lican Territory. The only one which can I
now be relied upon as . safe for that party,
having sufficient population to entitle it to
statehood, is Dakota, Washington Terri
tory, in view of the Democratic majority
of 2,000 and over given for Voorhess, being
considered doubtful notwithstanding its
Republican Legislature.
Montana is a Democratic Terri
tory. A Democratic Legislature and
majority of 3,718 for Mr. Toole
over the most popular man
in the Republican party in the Territory
establishes this fast. Hence there is rea
son to believe that if a bill were introduced
in the House providing for the admission
of Montana and Dakota ft would paw
that body and be favorably considered in
the Senate, as their joint admission would
proserre the present political status of the
Republican party in the latter branch of
Congres s .
However, should it fail there are grounds
upon which to predicate the hope that the
bill would go through at the next session of
Congress. With a Democratic Senator
from Indiana, another from California and
the third from New Jersey to replace Re
publican senators from those states and
with the aid of Riddleberger—Independent
—who seems disposed to act with the Dem
ocrats and the help of Van Wyck, who
wields a free lance at times, Montana and
Dakota may be enrolled among the sister
hood of states within the next eighteen
months.
THE HEALTH OF BUTTE.
There are those living in and out of
Butte who labor undèr the impression that
a great deal of sickness prevails in the city
aud that from causes which we will men
tion the health of the place does not com
pare favorably with that of others in the
Territory. 8ome of our exchanges have
taken their cue from remarks made, based
upon this presumption, and commented
in no flattering terms upon the city's
health. This is all wrong, and does an in
justice to Butte which we feel assured
would not intentionally be done by our
contemporaries or by residents of the place.
Whatever mischief may have been wrought
from the sources noted is the'result of a
misapprehension of facts
To arrive at a clear understanding as to
the health of a city like Butte there are
several things to be taken into considera
tion, among which may be mentioned its
population, the character and vocation of
ts people, and its mortality report; the
latter, as will be shown, not cutting such a
figure in determining its health as the un
informed may suppose. Biftte, or what is
generally known as Butte—that is, the city
proper with contiguous towns all included
within a radius of one and one-half miles
from the center of the place—has a popula
tion of nearly 25.000 souls, more than
double that of Helena, with its area of
nine square miles. The city and its sub
urbs have an average altitude of 5,800 feet
above the sea level, fully exposed to the
prevailing westerly winds which sweep over
a broad expanse of mountainous country,
uncontaminated by malaria or any im
purities arising from the decay of organic
matter. The air is pure, dry, bracing and
invigorating. The altitude and exposure
of the city precludes the possibility of its
being otherwise. Hence we must look for
the reason of whatever, of sickness there
may be in Butte in artificial not in natural
causes.
As has been stated Butte 'and vicinity
contain nearly 25,000 people. Many of
these are families who came here with little
or no means, and are compelled by force of
circumstances to crowd into small ill-ven
tilated dwellings, and to deprive them
selves of many of the necessaries of
life, which, in the aggregate, constitute a
serious violation of every sanitary condi
tion. The same class of people living in
low malarious districts as they live here
would die off daily by the dozen. Again
a large percentage of the city's population
is engaged in mining, which avocation, at
the best, is attended with more or less
danger to life and limb, and when fatal ac
cidents occur, as they occasionally do, the
death is charged up by unthinking, un
informed outsiders to the ''unhealthiness
of Butte." To this cause, and to the
manner in which many of the laboring
poor live may be ascribed four-fifths of the
deaths which occur here.
Even with these disadvantages, wlmt is
really the sanitary Condition oi B tte? In
a conversation yesterday with Dr. U. P,
Hough, Chairman of the Board of Health
a Miner reporter learned that, with the
exception of about half a dozen cases of a
mild form of scarlatina, there is no conta
gious diseases existing in the city or vi
cinity—in fact, that the health of the place
is good. The Doctor contends that a mor
tality report of the city and vicinity for
the present year would show as small a
percentage of deaths from natural causes,
in proportion to its population, as any
other place in Montana. The figures will
bear the Doctor out in this assertion.
Much has been said in regard to the fogs
and smoke which sometimes settle upon
the city and which many ignorantly sup
pose are unhealthy and breed disease.
Those « ho have lived in London and many
other cities where fogs are the rule and not
the exception will not be deceived by th is
cry. They know better. As to the smoke
the very slight percentage of the fumes of
sulphur which it contains holds no germs
of disease. On the contrary it is an excel
lent disinfectant. This is shows by the en
tire absence of cholera and many other
epidemics at Swansea and in the neighbor
hood of other large smelting and refining
works elsewhere. No danger need be appre
hended from the occasional smoke and fog
which occasionally hover over and envelop
the city.
Taken altogether Butte is one of the
healthiest cities in the West. Its location,
its altitude, its surroundings, and the pure,
cool mountain water which is conveyed in
mains and pipes within the reach of nearly
every door in the city, constitute a com
bination of natural elements of health with
which but few places are favored. The
charge that it is otherwise than healthy is
as unjust as it iB unfounded. We hope the
City Council will call upon the sexton to
make a monthly mortality report, stating
age, sex and cause of death to the end that
these charges concerning the city's health
may be satisfactorily and forever silenced.
Justice to Butte demands that such a re
port be made.
In commenting upon that portion of
President Cleveland's message in which he
refers to the request of the Secretary of the
Treasury for more vault room in which to
store silver, the Salt Lake Tribune grows
indignant, and exclaims :
"Rather, he prefers to add his sneer to
the injustice which is being heaped upon
silver, and to bewail the cost of sroriDg
money. Was ever the head of a great na
tion engaged in work like that before?"
Yes, the head of a great nation has been
engaged in just such work—not once, but
several times. Ex-President Arthur was
engaged in it, and it was his Secretary of
the Treasury who first raised the whine
about "more vault room" for silver. Grant
signed the bill which demonetized silver,
and before and since then every Republican
Secretary of the Treasury has fought the
metal with teeth and toe nail. The Repub
lican party is an anti-silver party, and
even in this Territory it is only recently
the Republican press has looked with favor
upon the coinage of the metal.
In an article in the latest number of the
North American Review, Mr. Pierre Loril
lard, the millionaire tobacco manufacturer
of New York, calls capital "condensed la
bor" and maintains that wealth is only
1 held in trust for the benefit of the masses,
I He ridicules the notion that the ad
vocates of a reform that will give the work
ers a larger share of the product of their
toil are anarchists or communists, and
makes the original suggestion for a labor
congress, composed of one workingman,
chosen by the workingmen of each Congres
sional district, and a Senate, the members
to be chosen by States, should meet for ono
month in each year to discuss and settle
disputed questions affecting employers and
employes. Mr. Lorillard's views may not
lead to any practical reforms, but it is a
hopeful sign of the times when men like him
who have become millionaires on manu
factures have the courage tQ speak up for
tbe workingmen.

THOMPSON FALLS.
Its Location, Scenery, the Falls, Pop«
lation, Business Houses, Ete.
Thompson Falls, M. T., Dec. 6,1886.
This place is not so widely known as
some others in the Territory and may not
have the advantages of which many of
them boast, but it is not without its at
tractions. It is beautifully located «»n
Clark's Fork of theColumbia river, and, at
present, is a place of considerable import
ance, being the shipping point for a large
amount of the freight sent into the Cœur
d'Alene country. From every point of
view the scenery is pleasing to the eye and
is grand and sublime at many places. The
forests on the mouutain sides are filled
with game, large and small. They are, in
deed, the hunter's paradise.
The falls below the town, while notas
grand as those of Niagara, are really fine,
and will probably in time be utilized in
moving vast machineries. If they were at
Butte with the fine volume of water flowiug
over them they would furnish power enough
to run all the stamps that could be used
upon the mountains of ore which abound
in that great raining center.
There are about 200 people at Thomp
son, a large portion of them being engaged
in freighting and teaming. The town is
orderly and about as lively as any place of
its size in the Territory. There are two
hotels, the usual number of stores, other
business houses and several saloons, all of
which seem to be doing weiland prospering.
A well-attended school, under the efficient
supervision of Miss Curtiss, is one of the
commendable features of Thompson.
To sum up, Thompson is a lively, busy
little burg, with possibilities of future great
ness—if the magnificent water power shall
be utilized. There is a tradition connected
with these falls known only to a few, which
I will write up in a future letter. It is all
about an Indian maiden and her dusky
lover, that in the hands of a novelist
would form the basis upon which a very
pretty and interesting tale could be woven.
But in a matter of fact letter like this one,
it would be decidedly out of place, so I
will save it for the future and subscribe

Desperate Assault.

Yesterday forenoon, for a cause un
known, John Fenn, of this place, assaulted
Jefferson Harrington with an axe, from be
hind. Harrington threw up his hands just
in time to catch the blow, the axe severing
three fingers from one hand and almost
cutting the other off, Fenn made his es
cape on a Northern Pacific tnin west, and
at this writing is still at large. County offi
cere have been notified, and the probabili
ties are he will be arrested to-day. Har

A NIGHTS LESSON.
Kitty Jiad been to the charity ball, and the
charity ball was very fashionable; there was
no dbubt about that. Kitty had eaten a late
«muer, returned home, gone to bed and to
*1 p--l , there was no more doubt about that. She
-ecrilected distinctly throwing one shoe under
the bed and the other tote a comer, saying
"good night" to her own figure in the looting
glass, twisting the figure of a butterfly till
her fingers ached, before she discovered that
it was not in the gee stopper, and then laugh
ing sleepily at all her mistakes. She even re
membered the first dream of her sleep, which
was flqrent.hing about charity diamonds,
chicken salad lanciers, and ice cream waltzes.
No; there was no doubt that she bad gone
all through this; yet there she was, staring m
at the window of the great ballroom, and the
ball was just commencing. Could she have
gone to sleep on tbe window sill in some mys
terious manner? No; she was outside, and
standin g in the air with somebody holding
her hand. . „ ,. T
"Ob dearl" thought Kitty, mournfully; "I
must have drunk some wine, somehow. How
strange it is! I wonder how I came here?
But what a cold hand holds mine; it s not
papa's, for it makes me shiver. He must be
horrid. I won't look at him. So?"
There did not seem to be much need of the
resolve, however, for the person who held
her hand did not move nor seem to care
whether she saw him or not, but quietly
looked in with her. So at last, like most
girls, Kitty's curiosity got the better of her,
and she glffnced out of the comers of her
^Beside her she saw an old man. His beard
and hair were long and white, and drooped
about his neck and shoulders like falling
snow. Upon bis head was lightly placed a
crown, as of frost work, so delicate was its
texture. Robes long and dark, and cold to
look at, fell in broad folds from his shoulders
and were held to his waist by a girdle of
twinkling stars. He was gazing in at the
brilliant assemblage with a sad, melancholy
look upon his face.
Kitty looked at his robes. "How very old
fashioned!" she thought; "and aged, very
aged!"
"Yes," murmured the old man, "old, very
old."
Kitty started. He read her thoughts evi
dently. She was sorry now she had thought
It, he looked so sad.
"Who ore you?" asked Kitty, timidly, "and
why Lave you brought me here?"
"I am the Cold Night," said the old man,
slowly turning liis eyes toward her. His eyes
. were sharp and piercing, yet full of kindness,
"And I have brought you here that yrii
might see how great your charity is, for 1
heard this was a charity ball."
"Yes," said Kitty, nervously.
"I am a friend to tbe poor," continued the
Cold Night; "and I love to see charity." He
looked back into the ballroom as he spoke.
"You see all your friends here?"
"Yes," said Kitty, brightening up and
gazing inside with something of a proud look.
"There's Florry Hall right before the win
dow now. She has those beautiful solitaire
diamonds in her ears. Oh, dear, how bright
they look ! I wish I had them. "
"But you have the handsomest dress," said
the Cold Night, sadly.
"Oh, yes," exclaimed Kitty, quickly. "It
was of the richest silk, and cost several
hundred dollars. Papa was so kind. "
"And it was bought for charity?" asked the
Cold Night.
"Why no," answered Kitty in surprise, "for
me, of course."
"But the ball is for charity?"
Kitty began to be bewildered by so much
criticising; and she was much relieved when
he led her away.
They descended to the grand entrance,
where he pointed out two little beggars, a boy
and a girl, who fiddled and sang, and asked
a penny of the rich people descending from
the carriages.
"You passed them by to-night."
"Yes," said Kitty; "but they were horrid
beggars." The Cold Night was silent, and
Kitty thought she might have said something
wrong; so she added: "and common street
fiddlers." But the Cold Night said nothing.
They both watched the little duo, "Tosey
and Tibby," the Cold Night said, and drew
nearer to hear what they would say. People,
rich with money and great in charity, care
fully passed them by, for they were ragged
beggars and fiddled and sang. It was cold,
Very cold; and Tosey played very, very
rtowly, while the breath of Tibby 's quivering
plaint disappeared despairingly in the frosty
air. The wheels of the carriages seemed to
creak in sympathy, ns they crushed down the
snow. Yes; it was cold indeed, yet they
fiddled and sang untiringly, while the rick
people alighted and passed up tbe grand en
trance, after glancing < ontemptuously at the
poor little duo, who fiddled and sang as the
brilliant dresses disappeared in the distant
doorway, but finally stopped as the last car
riage drove away.
"I suppose we looks too awful," said Tosey,
wetting his lips, and feeling vacantly in the
small pocket, which, God knows, had not
seen so much as a dime for many a day.
"Yes," said Tibby, "but I does feel so hungry,
and I sang so loud, and I tried so bard, and
—" Tibby slightly sobbed, and silently used
a small piece of her shawl to wipe a larg>
tear.
"Don't cry," said Tosey, tremulously; "let's
move on, and perhaps we'll find a little some
thin'. Oh, if we only had a few pennies!"
Tosey took Tibby's hand, and they started to
move away.
"Oh, Mr. Cold Night," exclaimed Kitty,
sorrowfully; "let me give them something,
poor little things."
"But they are beggars," answered the Cold
Night.
Kitty looked ashamed. She could feel
herself blush, oven though she was cold and
shivering. Tbe Cold Night banded her a
silver piece.
"Yes," said he; "drop it, even if it is
wasted. See what they will do."
Kitty took it quickly, and dropped it be
fore them. Right at Tibby's foot fell the
money, which she would have passed un
noticed if Tosey bad not exclaimed:
"Oh Tibby, there's a dime!" and picked
it up.
Tibby clapped her hands in delight, danced
up and down, and then looked into bis hand
to see if it was really there. It was surely.
"Won't we have a hot potato though!" said
Tosey.
"And a big roll and butter, and soma
meat; and just a very little piece of pie."
Tibby named each one on the ends of her fin
gers, but stopped when she got to her thumb,
for the money was all gone by that time, and
the thumb was quite large.
"But how did it come there?" asked Tosey.
"Could it bave growed?" suggested Tibby.
"No," said Tosey.
"Or fell from the skies?"
"Guess not," said Tosey, dubiously.
"Or been flunged?"
"Oh, no!" Tosey answered emphatically.
They both looked hungrily at the piece of
money, and began to count together what
lots of things they could buy; andtl«eir faces
grew bright indeed as they thought of it.
From the shade of the opposite side of the
entrance; a shin bundle of rags slowly crept
and unsteadily shuffled up to them. Out of
the dirt and rags peered a thin face and glis
tening eyes, and the hands of the small bun
dle wearily nibbed themselves together, to
try and stir up the blood which was not
there.
"This is a charity ball," said the thin bun
dle. "Those folks dance for the poor. " The
glistening eyes looked eagerly at Tosey and
Tibby, and frequhntly glanced at the money
in their hands. "We is poor, and, they
dances for us, and for my mother who is sick
abed; they dances to give us the bread which
we seldom has."
Tosey looked in surprise at the thin bundle,
rubbing and nibbing its bands.
"And does they dress in fine clothes for us,
and ride in carriages, and give lots of money,
and all for us?"
The thin bundle rubbed faster and faster.
"Yes, if there's any more then as pays for
the dancin' and dressin' ; sind the dancin' costs
$10 apiece, an' the dressin'—oh, I duuno! It's
all for us—if there's any left."
"But they didn't give us any when I sang,"
said Tibby.
-^ j0rs » no!" said the thin bundle; "they
teuik beggars don't need nothin'. They has
folks as bunts up poor folks when they bas
tane, an' sews flannels when they hasn't.
♦k L they 847 they does aU this for us, but"—
the bundle shook its head as if it were doubt
ful, and continued:
I stood over yonder thinkin' somebody
would give me somethin'; but they looked
maa at me, and I went back inter the shadder
and watched'em. It was a big sight, but I'm
"hungry." The hands stopped rubbing,
-ad U» mw looked wet op th« bundle added:
-ay motner is very, very kc».
poor—so poor!" '
Tosey looked at his little sister as th« -
began to shuffle away. ra 8*
Tibby hesitated. She looked at the silv
and then at the slowly retreating fig^ ;
then she looked up into Tosey's loving f^T a
"No, Tosey, I dunno as I does."
Tosey turned around, and running «**
the departing figure, handed her the pie™ Jr
money. 01
"There 1" said he, "take it; you need it m npa
than we does." "
The bundle looked in surprise as she took th
piece, and tears fell down the cheeks of th
thin, pale face. But she only said- «k?
very, very grateful," and walked off. m
The two little musicians watch«*! the
as it disappeared in the darkness, while th
happy shuffle of the feet grew fainter and
fainter. Ah, here was charity, godlife«
charity, in the hearts of the beings that th"
rich despised and thrust from their door > 3
As the Cold Night turned toward Kitty he
found her silently wiping her eyes. '
"Do you see what true charity is?" h
asked, iD a sweet, sympathetic voice.
"Yes, yes," murmured Kitty; "i see, Is*»
While they were talking they had slowk
risen up, up to the brilliant windows again 3
"Now look at the mockery," said the Cold
Night, somewhat harshly.
It was the most brilliant hour of the ball
Lights from myriads of jets, imbedded in
crystal chandeliers, sparkled with jewels, and
silks and laces were gathered in merrv
groups, or joining in pleasurable dance to the
strains of sweet and lively music. It was »
beautiful sight indeed; but somehow the
people looked heartless to Kitty, and the
jewels glittered spitefully, while tho rich silks
seemed to hiss and hiss as they rustled along
as if all were rebelling against their fahj
use.
"But one more act," said the Cold Night
gently leading her down, down, to the opp£
site side of the street.
From a dark corner, with their arms twined
around each other's necks, the two little beg
gars watched the windows of the brilliantly
lighted hall—away up in the sky, it seemed—
watched the gay figures that frequently ap
peared in rich dainty dresses, and smiled to
think it was all for the poor and needy.
"They dances for us and for others," mur
mured Tibby; "for those as is iu want
Maybe th® beautiful ladies will find us here
to-morrow, and gives us some bread."
"Yes," said Tosey; "and the poor little girl
as has the sick mother. P'raps they'll find
them, and help them, too."
The Cold Night waved his hand above
them, and they both shivered, and how cold
it was. Tosey tried to play a note on the
violin, but the strings creaked so dismally
that he laid it aside. Then they sang to
gether the sweet little song of charity Tibby
had sung to the rich people; and as they san
the Cold Night spread his mantle slowly
around them until they were fast asleep.
"Oh sir!" cried Kitty, "spare them and let
them live!"
■'No," said the Cold Night; "they are too
poor to live. They must die."
Kitty fell on her knees before him. "Oh
sir!" she pleaded, beseechingly; "I am rich
and will take care of them, and will relieve
them from suffering."
But tbe Cold Night raised his hand and
pointed upward, saying:
"Too late, too late!"
As he spoke, he took tbo beggars in his
arms and slowly rose up toward the stars,
leaving Kitty sobbing upon the ground.
And, as she knelt there, she heard, high in
tbe skies, the song that the beggars sang, the
song of sweet charity, swelling to a mighty
chorus, as one would think to celebrate a
mighty deed—mighty in the -.g-. of heaven.
Sho tried to raise her head, but could not;
«be seemed bound to the earth by a great
weight, as of gold; while above the song
.grew fainter and fainter till at last it ceased,
and she fell in a deep swoon.
******
It was broad daylight when Kitty awoke,
and the sun was shining brightly into her
window. In the hall the maid was humming
a subdued song as she went blithely about
her work ; while without , the white smoke of
morning fires—signs of stirring life—curled
upward from the chimney tops into the cool
air, as if glad to meet the light of day.

name, so dear to us, is a name of love among
tho poor. Ah, happy was the day, when tu
her eyes a dream revealed true charity."
