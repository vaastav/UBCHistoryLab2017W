Thursday, - - - December 9, 1909.
THE insurgents, if all reports are true,
are going to do a lot.of insurging this
winter. Good tuck to them.
CANNON and Aldrich convened in
regular session in Washington on Monday.
Some trusting folks refer to them as
Congress.
e
IF the Democrats and Republican insurgents
should act together they could
make things very interesting for Cannon
and Aldrich.
THE Equitable Life Assurance Society
of New York has been bought by J. Pierpont
Morgan, who announces he takes
control for the protection of the people.
Look for his halo.
+
THESE are booming good times for
the corporations of every sort, but we
notice that when the employees want a
share of the prosperity they have to fight
mighty hard to get it.
THE Sugar Trust on Monday reduced
the price of refined sugar ten cents a hundred
pounds.
It will take more than this to square the
Sugar Trust with the people.
AS a friendly note to Messrs. Aldrich
and Cannon, President Taft's message is
all that could be expected. But as a
communication to Congress and a document
for the consideration of the people
it is very weak.
IT is said that the insurgent Senators
and Representatives are to have no favors
' from the Taft administration unless they
surrender to Aldrich and Cannon. We
don't think that the President can starve
out men like LaFollette and Doliver.
IT is announced that Senator Aldrich
will permit certain sort of railroad legislation
to get through Congress at this session?not
the sort that really regulates,
however, only the sham that will fool the
people.
And they are easily fooled.
IT is now apparent that President Taft
is for Aldrich and Cannon and the insurgents
and progressives and Democrats
ane Republicans and North ana oouin
and East and West and the corporations
and the dear people and everybody else.
He is spread over so much ground that he
cannot but be mighty thin in spots.
THE State Corporation Commission of
Oklahoma has forced the Pullman Company
to reduce its rates in that commonwealth.
The berth rate is reduced from
$2 to $1.30 and the seat rate is cut 40 per
cent.
Oklahoma takes care of her citizens?
which is more than can be said of some
older States.
IN a speech in New York a few days
ago Andrew Carnegie made the assertion
that the lowgst type of colored people in
the South are farther advanced than his
ancestors were in Scotland 200 years ago.
We are willing to take Mr. Carnegie's
estimate of his ancestors at his own valuation,
but we wish to remark that his personal
knowledge of them is just about
w hat his acquaintance is with the Southern
negro.
HERE is what President Taft has to
say in his message in reference to the
great trusts and corporations in whose
affairs the people of this country are so
deeply concerned:
?
JUST as soon as Congress assembled
on Monday a resolution was introduced
in the House, calline for an investigation
of the frauds perpetrated by the Sugar
Trust. It did not take Speaker Cannon
two minutes to bury it deeply in the committee
on rules, where it cannot be considered
or revived until he gives permission.
Roosevelt's big stick is but a feather
when compared to the rod of iron with
which Cannon rules the cowards who
compose the House of Representatives.
THE State Tax Commissioner of West
Virginia has done this State very valuable
service in exposing the graft among officials
in Mingo county. It is not only
that he has shown up the frauds against
the taxpayers and will force the restitution
of some $22,000 illegally paid to office-holders
and politicians, but of much
more importance is the fact that every
county in the State gets fair warning that
extravagance and graft will not be tolerated.
The Tax Commissioner, having begun
a good work, should now examine every
county in the State, and there will doubtless
be even more astonishing revelations.
We are reasonably sure that one county,
at least, has nothing to fear from an investigation,
and that is Jefferson.
THE message of President Taft to Congress,
made public on Tuesday, is a lame
document. While it gives much space to
unimportant matters and affairs that but
slightly affect the people, it is silent on
the great issues of the present hour and
announces no policies of the administration.
The President has practically
nothing to say on questions of vital importance,
and his message indicates his
opinion that the people can very easily be
ignored. It is as if he has made up his
mind to refrain from even suggesting subjects
that may be distasteful to Cannon
and Aldrich.
For a longtime now many persons have
felt that President Taft lacks both courage
and decision. His latest message will go
far towards confirming this belief.
All Physicians
Must prescribe some of the Ingredients
that are contained In
Hood's Sarsaparilla-for all troubles
of the blood, stomach, kidneys
and liver.
They include sarsaparilla, stillingia,
yellow dock, gentian, wild cherry bark,
mandrake, dandelion, juniper berries,
pipsissewa, etc.
The combination and proportions arc
our own formula and give power to cure
beyond the reach of any other prescription
or substitute. That's why it is
wise to get Hood's and only Hood's.

NOTES FROM NEARBY.
Former Sheriff J. Nicholas Brumbaugh
of Washington county died last Mondays
aged 70 years.
Jasper Emerson has purchased the G.
A. Kershner farm of 130 acres in the Falling
Waters district of Berkeley county
for $3,500.
Charles Town is trying to keep up with
Shepherdstown in the matter of depot
improvement. They have just set out
five new shade trees around their station
over there.
Trinity Lutheran church and parsonage
in Hagerstown were offered at public sale
on Tuesday. Both were withdrawn,
the church property at a bid of $23,900
and the parsonage at $11,450.
The highest price yet paid for apple
land in Frederick county, Va., was recorded
last week, when Samuel M. Chiles
bought from J. H. Savage 40 acres at
$212.50 per acre. Ten acres is in apple
trees six years old.
John Windowmaker and his lady companion,
Mrs. John Dayton, were arrested
at Mondell, Md., on Tuesday, charged
with stealing a horse and buggy from
Williams Grove, Pa. They had the team
and admitted the theft.
The large barn on H. P. Thorn's place
in Martinsburg was destroyed by fire last
Friday night, causing a loss of $2,000.
Two horses were burned to death. Mr.
Thorn's lumber plant and other valuable
property was in great uanger.
Wm. M. Hoover, a saloon-keeper of
Hagerstown,committed suicide lastThursday
by inhaling gas. He was formerly
an engineer on the N. & W. Railroad,
but retired in 1890 because of serious injuries
that he sustained in an accident.
A. W. Richardson, a freight brakeman
on the Norfolk & Western Railway, was
killed near Riverton Monday afternoon.
He fell from a car and was run over by
the engine, his life being crushed out instantly.
He was a native of Troutville,
Va., and was 30 years old.
The leading officials of the B. & O. and
Cumberland Valley railroad companies
last Friday visited Cumbo, in Berkeleycounty,
where these two roads meet, and
agreed upon plans for the construction
of great yards and facilities for handling
the business there, including repair shops,
etc. The improvements willl cost halt a
million dollars.
The Charles Town Spirit ot Tuesday
says: Chicken stealing has been going
on pretty lively in this locality, but last
night a halt was suddenly called bytwo
youths of Charles Town. About
midnight Bob Lewis, son of G. K. Lewis,
residing on the new addition, discovered
a thief in his father's poultry house, and
proceeded at once to tackle the intruder,
a burly negro giving the name of Dick Kidwell.
The thief broke away, but young
Lewis caught him again, and calling to his
aid another boy, George Conrad, they
brought him to jail, secured a warrant from
Justice Gallaher (one of them holding him
while the other went after the warrant),
and had him committed to jail. A pretty
courageous act for two young lads, and
one for which they deserve much credit.
Catarrh Cannot Be Cured
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease. Catarrh
is a blood or constitutional disease,
and in order to cure it you must take internal
remedies. Hall's Catarrh Cure is
taken internally, and acts directly on the
blood and mucous surfaces. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is not a quack medicine. It
was prescribed by one of the best physicians
in this country for years and is a
regular prescription. It is composed of
the best tonics known, combined with
the best blood purifiers, acting directly on
the mucous surfaces. The perfect combination
of the two ingredients is what
produces such wonderful results in curing
Catarrh. Send for testimonials free.

Alleging discrepancies of over $11,000
in the public accounts of Mingo county,
\V. Va., a second report of the accountants
who have been engaged in the work
of auditing the books of that county was
made public on Monday by Tax Commissioner
Townsend, Supervisor of Public
Accounts. The financial transactions of
nearly all the county officials from 1905 to
1909 are called to question in the report
and they are ordered to reimburse the
county tor money received improperly.
Large sums were paid the county officials
by the county court, contrary to law, and
legal steps will be taken to have the
money paid back. Among those alleged
to have been overpaid are Circuit Clerk
James Damron, Sheriff W.A. Hurst,former
Prosecuting Attorney John A. Sheppard,
former Circuit Clerk C. H. Bronson, exAssessor
E. L. Ferrell, ex-Sheriff E. E.
Musick and Presidenf M. Z. White of the
county court. As the result of a former
partial audit Musick recently paid the
county over $10,000. It is likely that
criminal action will follow the report of
the audit.

In spite of the fact that the word dyspepsia means
literally bad cook, it will not be fair for many to lay
the blame on the cook if they beein the Christmas
Dinner with little appetite and end it with distress
or nausea, ft may not be fair for any to do that?let
us hope so for the sake of the cook ! The disease
dyspepsia indicates a bad stomach, that is a weak
stomach, rather than a bad cook, and for a weak
stomach there is nothing else equal to Hood's Sarsaparilla.
It gives the stomach vigor and tone,
cures dyspepsia, creates appetite, and makes eating
the pleasure it should be.

ARE MICROBES IN YOLR SCALP?
It Has Been Proved that Microbes
Cause Baldness.
Professor Unna of Hamburg, Germany,
and Dr. Sabourand, the leading French
dermatologist, discovered that a microbe
causes baldness. Their theory has time
and again been amply verified through
research experiments carried on under
the observation of eminent scientists.
This microbe lodges in the Scbur, which
is the natural hair oH, and when permitted
to flourish it destroys the hair follicles
and the scalp gradually takes on a
shiny appearance. When this happens
there is no hope of the growth of hair
being revived.
Dandruff is a contagious disease, which
is largely due to a destructive microbe,
which when left to pursue its course
causes itching scalp, falling hair and baldness.
Dandruff is caused by the microbe
affecting the glands which produce the
sebaceous matter, which latter then unnaturally
dries up and scales off.
We have a remedy which will, we honestly
believe,remove dandruff,exterminate
the microbe, promote good circulation in
the scalp and around the hair roots, tighten
and revitalize the hair roots and ov
ercome baldness, so long as there is any
life left in the hair roots.
We back up the statement with -our
own personal guarantee that this remedy
called Rexall "93" Hair Tonic will be
furnished free of all cost to the user if it
fails to do as we state.
It will frequently restore gray and faded
hair to its original chlor. pro viding loss of
color has been caused by disease; yet it
is in no sense a dye. Rexall "93" Hair
Tonic accomplishes these results by making
every hair root, follicle and pigment
gland strong and active, and by stimulating
a natural flow of coloring pigment
throughout the hair cells.
Rexall "93" Hair Tonic is entirely free
from grease or sediment, is exceedingly
pleasant to use and will not gum the hair
or permanently soil the clothing or pillows.
We exact no obligations or promises?
we simply ask you to give it a thorough
trial and if not satisfied tell us and we will
refund the money you paid us for it. Two
sizes, prices 50 cents and $1.00. Remember
you can obtain it in Shepherdstown
only at our store,? The Rexall Store,
Reinhart's Pharmacy.
It is reported that the Savage Distilling
Company, for many years located at
Kernstown, Va., will shortly move its

We notice the above item going the

has recently been fined heavily for
violating the State laws. He is going to
the right place when he locates in Hagerstown,
where there is "such a strong
sentiment to place business before decency.
Or he might go to Sharpsburg,
where everything is wide open on Sundays
as well as week days.

Jacob Schrall, 432 South St., Danville

what Foley's Kidney Pills did for me."
