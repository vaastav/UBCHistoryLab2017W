IIUKNED BEYOND RECOGNITION.
Shocking Story Told by it Series of Fires at
Louisville Yesterday.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
Louisville, Dec. 9. Two disastrous con
flagrations occurred in this city this morn
ins, by which fifteen people, seven of whom
were young women, lost their lives. Four
of the victims were brave liremen. While
they were iisbtin the flames a four-story
wall that had been twiatcd nnd cracked by
an all-night lire was seen to totter and fall
with a terrible crash, burying the men be
neath tons of debris. Only seven bodies,
six girls, have teen recovered and those aro
roasted into an almost nnrecognizable
mass and bear little resemblance to hu
man beings. The unfortunate girls were
caught in a candy factory, where nearly
forty were at work. Escape by the stair
way was cut oil before half could descend.
All bat seven remaining threw themselves
from the window, falling three stories to a
shed below and suffering excruciating in
juries, many of which it is believed will
prove fatal.
Those known to bo dead are:
LULU KERN, 1302 Went Main street,
UAKIUK LOCK MA It I T, lO'JOCano street
BAKBAKA BLLu 1223 Rogers street.

accompanied tho chief, and received a broken

. Eillie Grexewaid, slightly limised.
1'atuick tiiiKEHKT. ladderwan of truck No. 1,
badly cut about wrist and arms.
Allen grimes, candy-maker, internal injuries.
The firemen had been fighting the tire in
the Boone Paper Company's Building all
night long, and were not aware that the
walls wero dangerous. At 4 o'clock this
morning fire suddenly burst forth from all
four floors of Bamberger, Streng & Co.'s
in the building adjoining Boone's.
Many claim that an explosion oconrred
in the basement. Almost instantly the
partition wall collapsed, and the
the lour truckmen were crushed beneath.
It was while driving at break-neck speed
to this fire that Chief Hughes met with his
probably fatal accident His buggy was
on the wrong aide of the street, and was
run down by tho Salvage Corps wagon.
The fire at Eaniberarer's spread rapidly, and
before the lire could be extinguished tho
wholesale boot and shoe houso of Bam
berger, Streng & Co.; Bliss, Wilson & Co.,
men's furnishing and notions; Weller.
Woolfolk & Tayne, boots and shoes, nnd
Johanbocke & Sons, hats, bad been con
sumed. It was with great diiliculty that
the liremen preiented the flames from
spreading further.
ROASTED IN THE FLAMES.
At 8 o'clock another fatal lire started in
the wholesale candy and fancy grocery
house of F. A. Meuno At Co.. at No. 517
West Main street, just a block distant
from the first, where forty eirls were em
ployed. . This was the most shocking
disaster of the two. Tho lire caught
in one of the huge kitchens,
but was communicated to the large
store-room where was kept thousands of
dollars' worth of fire-works. With the ex
plosion of these a perfect panic ensued
among the employes on the fourth floor
above the rapidly iirinir explosives. Be
fore half of the girls had descended the
stairways were a mass of roaring
flames from the floors below, and
no exit save the windows was
left. At the front it was four stories to the
street, and at the rear a low one-story
building stcod. The lire department was
so crippled by its all-night labors and the
calamity that already had befallen it as to
make it nnahle to do anything like its
usual brilliant work. In addition to that
the shooting sky-rockets, bursting Koman
candles nnd exploding lire-crackers ef
fectively prevented entrance to the
building for tho purpose of rescu
ing the doomed girls. There was noth
ing to do but leap from the . rear
windows, and this many of them did until
the snllocating smoke from the tire-works
rendered them unconscious. Those who
remained fell and wero consumed in the
flames, boon the skylight fell in, allowing
the smoko to escape at the top. Then the
fire-works ceased, and the department pro
ceeded to titfbt tb.e flames to such a purpose
as to get them under control by 10;o0 o'clock.
Tho rest of the day was taken up in the
search for the dead bodies. To-night but
eight bodies had been recovored. As fast
as they were identified they wero taken to
their respective homes. Details of citizens
turned out to assist in the work of carting
out the debris, but many tons must
be removed before the rest can
bo reached. There is littlo hope
that any will be found alive. At Boone's
Block a line of hose running in under the
fallen wall is being followed up in the hopo
that by daylight the remains of the four
truckmen will be reached.
According to a conservative estimate the
losses on the ruined buildings will foot up
t total of $575,000, amply protected by insurance.

THE DEAD BOMB-THROWER.
His Identity Not let Established John Her
bert Phillips Not the Man.
Ererial to tbe Indianapolis Journal.
New York, Dec 9. The head of the dead
bomb-thrower is still at tho morgue. It
was viewed by hundreds again to-day, but
most of those who viewed the gastly object
were impelled by curiosity. With each
day that passes the features become more
and more indistinct Another examina
tion of the brain will be made to-morrow.
A plaster case of the head was made at
noon to-day.
Colonel Slocum. Mr. Sage's private secre
tary, was seen by a reporter to-day and
asked as to the condition of that gentle
man. He said that Mr. Sago was steadily
improving. His deafness was gradually dis
appearing. Mr. fclocuru thought that he
would be able to resumo business in a few
days. Mr. age had not positively identi
fied the alleged photograph of John Her
bert Phillips, formerly an assistant book
keeper of the Hanover National Bank, at
had been stated in a morning paper, as the
likeness of the man who threw the bomb
last Friday. The likeness, however, CoL
blocuin said, bears a remarkable resem
blance.
A cousin of Mr. Phillips accompanied a
reporter to the morgue this morning for the
purpose of satisfvinu himself as to the al
leged resemblance between him and the
head of the dynamiter. He declared that
be could see no resemblance, and he asserts
that the statement that the head was that
of John Herbert Phillips was absurd. At
the Hanover National Hank It was said
that Phillips's hair was licht. while the
hair of the dynamiter was dark. A mem
ber of the Phillips family said that a letter
had been received from Herbert from Chi
cago, dated Nov. EO. It was perfectly
rational, and spoke only of family topics.
Another piece of the body of the oonib
thrower was found this morning by work
men engaged in clearing away the debris
at No. 71 Broadway. It was sent to the
morgue.
Another Crank.
New York, Dec. 9. The Brooklyn poh?e
have arrested a man named Landik. on a
charge of conspiring to blowup the build
ing. No. 212 Broadway, in which are the
ofiices of the Associated Press. Landik
said a banker in No. 212 Broadway had
overreached him in a bond transaction.
The impression prevails that Landik is de
mented.
TEOTTLNG-HORSE BREEDERS.
The National Association Elects Officers
The Dispute Over the Wallace Register.
New York. Dec. 9. The annual meeting
of tho National Trotting-horse Breeders'
Association was held hero to-day. H. W.
T. Mali presided. The treasurer's report
showed a balance of $7,241.22. The execu
tive committee made a report regarding its
dealings with John H. Wallace, compiler of
the Trotting-horse Register. The incorpo
ration of the American Trotting Register
Association had absorbed the Wallace
Trotting Register Company, and accom
plished the end which the National Breed
ers' Association bad sought so long, and al
though the latter association has nothing
in common with the new organization, a
committee had also beon appointed to con
fer with the National and American Trot
ting Association with reference to securing
unity of method in accepting new records.
The National Association of Trotting-horse
Breeders practically organized the new
body in Chicago last Apnlr with tho under
standing that it was to have charge' of the
compiling of records, etc. but this right
has since been denied to it. The report of
the committee was adopted.
Hon. Leland Stanford, Hon. Benjamin F.
Tracy, L. D. Packer and C. H. Pratt were
re-elected members of tho executive com
mittee and K. (I. Doolittle. of Connecticut,
in place of Charles Backman, resigned.
The sum of $250 was voted toward the fund
for erecting a monument to the noted sire
Hambletonian. Senator Stanford sent a
check. Tho total is now 1.500. The elec
tion of officers for tho following year re
sulted as follows: President, H. W. T.
Mali, of New York: first vice-president.
Senator Leland Stanford, of California;
second vice-president, Hon. I. V. Baker, of
New York: A. J. Caton, of Chicago, third
vice-president: L. D. Packer. f New York,
secretary; W. F. Redmond, of Morristown,
N. J., treasurer. Messrs. Mali, Baker.
Packer, Redmond and B. F. Tracy were
appointed as a committee to revise
the constitution and report at the
next monthly meeting of the ex
ecutive committee, which will be
held at the Fifth-avenne Hotel, Thursday.
Jan. 14. Measures have been takentowards
securing the rights which the committee
thinks has been monopolized by the syndi
cate of wealthy breeders composing
the American Trotting Register Associa
tion. The committee declares that at the
meeting of representative breeders in Chi
cago last April, when the project to relieve
John H. Wallace of- the contract of the
Register assumed material shape, it was in
ferentially nndecided that the National As
sociation of Trotting-horso Breeders would

hands of Mr. Wallace. The national breed
era have been ignored instead by the syndi
cate. It is claimed that the latter have
adopted a rule allowing pacers with a
record of 2:25 or better to be registered as
trotters. The national breeders say they
have had an honorable existence for fifteen
years and are entitled to fair treatment.
No More Winter Racing at Chicago,
Chicaqo, Dec. 9. A war of extermina
tion by the public authorities has at last
been inaugurated against the institution
known as the "Garfield Park Track''. The
place, though ostensibly a jockey club's
course, is, according to a general belief,
largely owned by George Hankins. who un
til the advent here of a cif" administration
opposed to gambling conducted onu of the
largest houses in the West. Soon after the
forced shut down of the faro dens, control
of the old West Side race-track was pur
chased. It was at ouce refitted for business.
and when cold weather began the grand
stand and book-makers quarters were closed
in with glass and steam pipes put in. From
that time the horses have Jeen going
round iu the rain and snow. The West
Side park commissioners, whose authority
is derived direct from the State officials,
decided to close up the place, and lastniaht,
in order to settle their jurisdiction, adopted
a resolution instructing the park police to
"prohibit, forbid and abate all horse-racing
and gambling" within specified limits,
which includes the site of the alleged race
track. Obituary.

HAS THE TRUE AMERICAN RING
President Harrison's Message Applaud
ed bj Legislators at Washington.
His Treatment of the Chilian Incident Com
mended as Evidence That All Foreigners
Mast Respect the Stars and Stripes.
Those Who Expected Dim to Ignore the
Silver Question Sorely Disappointed.
Recommendations of Inspectors Looking to an
Improvement of Service at the Post
offices Throughout the Country.
THE MESSAGK TVF.IX RECEIVED.
President Harrison Commended for the
Stand Taken on Public Questions,
f peclAl to the Indianapolis Journal.
Washington, Dec. 9. Men cf atfairs
and those in private life who keep the
closest run of current events first turned to
President Harrison's treatment of the
Chilian incident when the message was
laid before Congress this afternoon and
copies of it wero distributed at the Capitol.
The greatest interest was taken in this, the
first official statement of the status of the
case. The firm manner in which the case
throughout was stated in the message was
very gratifying to every one who has the
welfare of American citizens upper
most in their hearts, and in the
estimation of almost all men in Congress
the President has added another wreath to
his crown in the eilort to 6levato the rights
of American, citizens abroad and demand
respect everywhere for the stars and
stripes. It was especially gratifying to
Congress to. learn that the President in
tends to depart from the old custom of
secrecy and send to Congress tbeollicial
correspondence and thereby dive to the
entire country all of the facts relating to
the killing of American sailors in the streets
of Valparaiso, because they wore tho uni
form of the United States; also, that he
believes the present status of the case war
rants some sort of action on the part of
Congress. In the entiro treatment of the
Chilian affair tho President gave evidence
of his old-time determination to maintain
the rights of Americans in foreign lands.
War or any hostile step can only be taken
by direction of Congress and the reference
to Chili's attitude is regarded as signifi
cant. Next in importance in tho mind of the
pnblio here, ana that which it was Quickly
tnrnea to, was the President's reference to
the financial condition of the country, and
tho operation of the McKinley tariff law.
Many supposed the question, so energetic
ally evaded by the Democratic leaders at
present, that of free coinage, would be
"straddled'' or ignored. fpt so in this in
stance President Harrison, while not
evincing a dogmatio disposition, earnestly
points out the disastrous effect absolute
free coinage would have upon the country
if undertaken before an international
standard was adopted. Thin there were
those who expected to see the President
"fight shy" of a fair and squuro indorse
ment of the tariff law as it stands, and
hoped to see him point out objections and
make suggestions of amendments. On the
contrary, the indorsement of the law is full
and direct, and the President expressed the
belief that it is the best that could have
been invented, taken in connection with
its reciprocity provisions.
Presidential messages have heretofore
been largely reviews of executive depart
ment work, dealing in figures and stero
typed facts. This evenine's Star voices tho
comment of hundreds of statesmen at tho
capital to-day when it says that "while it
is long, it is packed so full of meaty, inter
esting matter, edited with nice discrimina
tion, that it is hard to snecest where the
cut would be properly made," that "it is
not a formal rehash of the department re
ports," and that "the President has im
pressed hts individuality upon every sen
tence of it, and the art of putting things
effectively, of which he has shown him
mastery in the admirable, condensed
speeches which he has made from time to
time during his administration, has evi
dently not deserted him."
The messago is complimented by men in
both branches of Congress, not alone for
its originalitr of ideas and new matter,
but for its business qualities. It is on
every hand taken as an appeal to the Amer
icanism of citizens, and their better sense
of judgment rather than their political
rejudices. Tho message was attentive
y listened to by men in all parties when
read before Congress, and will have an un
usual impression upon future legislation,
for it bears npon its own face evideuce
that it was nrcoared bv one who. above
all, desires the best for the American peo
ple. The nicseatte was delivered to both
the Senate aud House At noon by Mr.
Pruden, one of the President's secretaries.
It required an hour and a quarter to read
it in the Senate, and when it was finished
that body adjourned. Iu the House the
men who showed most interest in the doc
ument were Messrs. Herbert of Alabama,
Miller of Wisconsin, and Otis aud Simp
son of Kansas.
How Chilians View the Message.
Valpakaiso, Dec o. The substance of
President Harrison's statement of the Val
paraiso affair was received to-day. and is
the subject of universal comment It is re
garded by tho Chilians as decidedly menac
ing a rupture between the two coon
tries, as it is not believed that the
Chilian government will consent to any
J apologies or to pay indemnity. It is
now no secret that the government is
proceeding actively with warlike prepara
tions and that artillery of the latest manu
facture has been ordered from Germany in
anticipation of hostilities, possibly with
other powers and probably with the United
States. The situation is complicated by
Spain's demand for a large indemnity. The
Chilians have always detested the Span
iards and the hatred is quickened by this
demand, which tho Chilians say is pre
sented now in order to take advantage of
existing difficulties. The general senti
ment indicates that they would challenge
Spain if they had not the Unitt d States to
deal with, and an American otlicial ex
pressed tho opinion to-day that the Chil
ians might conclude to settle with America
in order to defy the Spaniards.
A dispatch from London says: The Times
to-day publishes a dispatch from its cor
respondent at Santiago De Chili stating
that "the insulting notes written to the
government by Mr. Kgan.tho United States
minister to Chili, and his own telegrams to
his own government caused a proposition
to be made to Chili to abolish the
legation at Washington. This prono
sition was discussed at a meeting
of the finance committee of the House of
Representatives last night and a heated de
bate was had on the question. Tho gov
ernment declined to support the proposal,
and when the matter was nut to a vote
those who were in favor of recalling the
Chilian minister to the United States aud
abolishing the legation at Washington
were defeated. Thh government made a
strong fight against the adoption of the
proposal."
Comment of thn English Pres..
London, Dec 10. In commenting upon
President Harrison's message, the Post
notices with satisfaction the absenco of
signs of bluster toward foreign nations,
and says thai if 4he message meets tho
ideas of the President's party. Mr. Blalne'i
chances have seriously diminished.
The Daily News says: "The President's
message leaves nothing to be desired either
in tone or In temper. 3Ir. Harrison is lesi
exasperating than Mr. Blaine, and conse
quently more statesmanlike. He would
not speak so tenderly or reciprocity if his
protection policy was a success."
The Standard says: "President Harrison'
message is noticeable for its larce devotion
to foreign affairs. This showing is dua
to Mr. Blame's fidgety activity.
Tto President glides with cus
tomary bland optimism over several
matters, hardly doing credit toAmericaa
diplomacy. It must bo admitted that tho
figures he quotes, although they do not
justify the sancuino hopes of the authors
of the McKinley tantl law. are PufbcienC
to cause some surprise nnd adverse crit
icism both at home and abroad."

Changes Intended to lleneflt the Public Sag
gested at a Conference of Inspectors.
Washington, Dec 9. The third annual
conference of the chief postotfico inspector
and inspectors in chargeof divisions, whicti
has been in session in this city for the past
two weeks, has adjourned. A larger number
of topics relating to the postal service than
were considered at any previous meeting
were taken up, discussed and acted upon
In regard to free-delivery service, the in
spectors recommended that the delivery of
mail by carrier be extended to include
towns of 5,000 people and $5,000 postal
revenue per annum. In the matter of sal
aries and the clerk-hire allowances of post
offices, it was recommended that in all
cases where additional clerk-hire allow
ance could be granted by the department
for the purpose of promoting employes thd
salaries of the lower-grade clerks should ho
first increased, so as to recognize in s,
substantial way the merits of.tho most de
serving class of hard-working employes
In regard to tho registry system it was
recommended that postoflices bo kept open
more hours than at present o as to enable)
tho general public to transact business witlt
this department of the postofiice outside of
their regular working hours. In relation
to the money-order system the same recom
mendation touching the extension of hours!
for business for the general publio was
made as in the case of tho registry system,
and for the samo reason. The postal-note
system is recommended to be modified by
the issuance of money orders in lieu there
of for the samo price charged for postal
notes of equal amount under the present
plan, provided that the maximum amount!
at what are now postal-note offices is fixed
at $10. It was suggested that all postmas
ters and all custodians of postofiice build
iryza should be charged with tho duty o
keeping tho American Hag suitably dis'
played.
MINOR MATTERS.
Carpet-Layers at Work in the White Homey
Over 500 Yards far the East Room.
hrcclxl to tbe Indianapolis Journal.
Washington. Dec 0. Carpet-layers are
busy up stairs in the White House, putting
down the new carpet in the corridor. ThO)
new carpet, of which about four hundred
yards were required, is in keeping with tho
general artistio treatment of the house. It
has a ground of moss-green, with a email
figure of a deep cream or buft color. This
carpet and the new one for the Kast Room
were selected personally by Mrs. Harrison
from an immense number of samples
shown her early in the fall. Tho
East Room carpet had to bo espe
cially woven, as tbe ordinary rolls
come jnst onco and a half the length of the
room, aud if used would entail piecing
every other width, or wasting just that
much, consequently each roll was woven
twice the length of the room. It requires
615 yards to cover it. The color of the car
pet harmonizes with tho gold n browns and
cream in the furniture coverings and win
dow draperies, and in quality is one of the
best ever laid in the room. The work of
laying this carpet could not commence un
til late this afternoon, as the President held
his usual reception. As soon as that was
over the East Room was iu the bands of tho
workmen, who first pulled up the old car
pet and brushed the matting all off before?
the new one was stretched in place. ThO
impression is general that tho bite House?
was never so attractive as at present.
Cooper Will Again Pursue Itaum.
Washington, Dec. 9. Mr. Cooper, of
Indiana, stated to-day, in answer to au in
quiry, that he proposed early in January to
oiler a resolution in the House providing
for a thorough and rigid examination of
the management of tho Pension Office
under Commissioner Kaum. His reason
for delaying the matter is that he is going
to Indiana on business andeannot return
to Washington until after the holidays,
lie said also that he would not press the
inquiry uhould General Raum be removed,
and yet ho did not like to appear in the at
titude of threatening the administration:
but in view of what has already trans
pirod he would not consider himself true to
his constituents and the country if he dil
not do his utmost to have Katun's adminis
tration of Pension Olfico affairs thoroughly
investigated.
House Adjourned Till Saturday.
Washington, Dec 9. After the Presi
dent's message had been read in the House
day, Mr. Miller of Wisconsin oliered a res
olution requesting the Speaker, in appoint
ing the committees, to apportion the same
among the several States and Territories
according to population, and to appoint at
least a chairman from each State and Ter
ritory. Mr. Milllken of Maine, sarcastical
ly expressed tho hope that the speaker
would not be embarrassed by any new
rules. On motion of Mr. Holman the rea-.
olution was referred to the committee on)
rules, when appointed. On motion of Mr.
Holman the House then adjourned until
Saturday, with the understanding that a
further adjournment should be then taken
until Wednesday.
