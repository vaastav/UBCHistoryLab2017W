Sergt. James Allen, Fifth Cavalry, Tells Jury His Story
Of the Killing of His Young Mexican Wife; Says She
Tried to Get Him to Desert His Eegiment and Cross
Eio Grande at Ysleta; Admits Was Intoxicated.
SERGT. JAMES ALLBN. of the Fifth
cavalry, told a Jury Monday in the
14th district court, where he Is being
tried on a charge of murder, that he
did not know whether or not he or
his wife fired the shots that killed
her.
The soldier Is charged with willing
his wife, a IT year old Mexican girl.
September IS at the home in Orchard
Park. He testified that he was ex
pecting his resriment tn lun Mil
before the shooting occurred, tnd that
be had been absent wtthoat Imt. fnr
five days prior to the shooting.
TOuring these five days I drank
two quart bottles of tequila, except,

45 years.

morning I drank all but one drink,
then went to sleep and slept until 2
or 3 oclock.
WHe Inalated on Leaving.
"I got up and sent Grace to the
more tor aome agarecs. sue came
go 10 r sieia witn ner that night." j
The soldier went on to say that for
weeks his wife bad been begging him
to go Into Mexico with her. where
her uncle owned a big store. He tes-
uihm mat ne nao repeateoiy told ner
he would not desert the army.
"She kept begging me to leave. I
knew my regiment was soon going to
move and she knew It also. My enlist
ment will be up in April. I always
lived in Maryland op to the time I
joined the army.
I kept telling her I would not go
into Mexico, and that I would not de
sert. She insisted that I go. She
begged me to go to Ysleta with her
that night and cross the river."
The soldier testified every time he
was asked about it. that his wife shot
the first two shots, and after he was
shot he did not know what happened.
Wife Took Out Gun.
"I rot up off the bed after she had
brought me mv rlarareta." he said. "I
stretched myself. Grace walked over
to the dresser and took my gun out
of the drawer where I always keep it.
"She turned and fired at me. I
reached for the gun. leaning over to

regional coal committees aet up
by the railroad administration.
Railroad administration . officials
conceded that the application of the
order would mean an industrial abut
down of considerable magnitude but
declined to undertake a definite esti
mate. Industrial establishments op
erating from their own power plants,
it was said, probably would have to
stop when their present coal supply
became exhausted.
Left to Localities.
Industries operating on power sup
plied by public utility companies may
continue operation unless the man
agement of the DUblic utility compa
nies supplying them and the local
authorities rule that they are non
essential. For the present the rail
road administration will not attempt
to lay down a rule as to what is an
essential industry.

and should only consume suffi

light, power and heat to meet
the actual urgent needs of the
people.
"Advertising signs and displays of
various kinds necessitating the use
of coal should be curtailed and no
coal should be distributed for such
purpose.
"Pursuant to this do 1 icy I have re
quested the railroad administration
in the distribution of coal now or

distribution to these essential and
urgent uses.

Message to Congress
WASHINGTON. D. 0. DC t
.The text of president WH
son's annual message to congress,
delivered today. foHowst
To the Senate and lions e of Rep
resentatlves:
I sincerely regret that I can
not be present at the opening of
this session of the congress. Z
ant thus prevented from preaent
lag fn as direct a way as I could
wtafc the many fU est tons that are
pressing for aelntloa atUIha time.
Happily. 1 have had the advan
tage of the advice of the heads of
the several executive departments
who have kept In close touch with
affairs In their detail and whose
thong at ftil reconunendatfoas I
earnestly second.
In the matter of the railroads
aad the readjustment of their
affairs growing out of federal
control. X shall take the liberty
at m Utter day of addressing you.
IHGES BUDGET SYSTEM.
I hope that congress wHl bring
to a conclusion at this session
learfaiatfea looking to the estab
lishment of a budget system.
That there should be one slanie
authority responsible for the mak
ing of all appropriations and that
appropriations should be made
act independently of each other,
bet with reference to one alnsle
comprehensive plan of expendi
ture prsyerly related to the na
tion's lBrrsjte there can be n
donht. I beHeve the burden of
irefa rina: the badget must In the
nature of the ease. If the work la
to be properly done and rrsponst
MHty concentrated Instead of dl
vlsd, rest upon the executive.
The TsfSda-et so prepared should
be submitted to and approved or
amended by a single committee of
each house of cwngrexa and no
sbacSe approprljrtfea should be
made- by the coagresa. except such
as may have been included In the
budget prepared by the eeuire
or added by Hher a ft Ionia if eeia
salttee of coage sctargfed with
the budget feglstatfen.
PROBLEM OF KCONOMT.
Another aad not less Important
aspect of the problem Is the as
certainment of the economy aad
efficiency with which the moneys
appropriated are expended. Under
rvistltts; law the only audit Is for
the purpose of ascertaining
whether expenditures have been
.lawfully made within the appro
prtatte. No one Is authorized
or eefpped to ascertain whether
the money has been spent wisely,
economically and effectively. The
and! tors should be hlchly trained
officials with permanent tenure
In the treasury department free

that In dealing with this matter
the present law should not be

The congress mlcht well consider

JffOT AN EASY PROBLEM.
The problem Is not an easy one.
A fundamental change has taken
place with reference to the po
sition of Vineries In the world's
affairs. The prejudice aad paa
nlena engendered by deeadca of
controversy between two schools
of political and economic thought

WASHINGTON". D. O. Dec X.
There Is no exaggerating the
seriousness of the picture that pre
sents itself as congress comes back
into session.
Heelpless in some respects, hopeless
In others, the government is divided
by party strife and political ambition
while the economic factors that are
keeping the cost of living high and
may send it even higher are uncon
trolled. President Wilson has written his
message though greatly improved in
health, he is still unable to leave the
white house. He still believes that
at the bottom of America's Ills Is that
unratified peace treaty.
