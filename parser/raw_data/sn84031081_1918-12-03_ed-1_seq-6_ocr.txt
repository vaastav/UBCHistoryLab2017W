(he full toxl of the president's address
to ( (nsif'sf. Ti is in no partisan sense
. that wo say the address was the only
disappointing one I'rrsitlent Wilson
has ever delivered in the national leg
islnture.' It was expected that he would speak
explii illy regarding any matter which
could conic before the peace confer
ence.. Ili.s Kenenilitiea regarding the
Kiillamry of flic American soldiers
were coucht-d in his usual beautiful
hiiiKuaKC The sentiment expressed ly
him may well be tnki-n as the senti
ments of every loyal American.
Hiii mo.,l disappointing was his
declaration lliai iho administration
has no program and really sees no ne
cessity for reconstruction work after
peace, except such as may l-o tinder-
taken on Ihc initiative of private capi
tal. " Xntuing is said rcRardinpf employ
ment of ihnse who will soon he out of
employment. Of course, he commends
the hazy scheme of Secretary Lane to
reclaim swamp lands and open irri
gation projects. Tint Secretary I,ane
himself admits in the current issue of
everybody's Magazine th.it not even
the location of stuh lands have been
determined. None of the preliminary
work has been done, and probably five
years would be required before any
considerable project could be opened
to settlement. That would be a Ioiir
time for a returned soldier to wait to
find some means of earning a. liveli
hood. Pealing with tho railroad situation,.
tho president confesses that he has no
solution for the problem and pnsses it
on to cnp.srors. Put he does state that
he expects socn to return the roads to
private ownership, unless there Is!
some legislative action. In order that
the private companies may not he
longer restrained from making im
"provements and extensions. ,
This is notice that the government
will initiate nothing for the employ
ment of labor and for the stimulation
of enterprise.
The president takes occasion to tell
the public that the taxes for 1919 must
he not less than six billion dollars, and
that the country should be notified
that four billions must he raised by
taxation In 1920; which, of .course,
means that the present congress is ex
pected to levy the taxes for that year,
if the republicans will permit.
The explanation of the seizure, after
th? armistice was signed, of the American-owned
cables, was disappointing.
He repeats what Burleson said regard
ing the seizure, and says it is only tem
porary. -
Hut we know that such a continu
ous circuit, which he says is the. ob
ject, has been in actual operation ever
since the war began, and that there
has not been the slightest danger of
its impairment while the peace con
ference was In session or while troops
were being moved from Europe.
The country will still believe the
taking over of the cables was for the
pimposa of promoting Burleson's
scheme pf annexing the telegraph and
cable service to that of tho postof
fic department.
Taken all in all, the president's ad
dress was lacking in everything which
demanded its delivery, t.nd was about
on a level with his appeal to the
voters to return democrats to congress
as a war measure.
go through without voicing a protest
against it.
We regret to say that the facts con
demn the framers of the revenue bills,
as will be seen by the following state
ment from the Xew Yorw World
based on government reports of the
wealth of the states and of the war
taxes collected from them:
"In the list of states of the solid
south running down the Atlantic sea
board from Virginia to Florida inclu
sive, the poorest, by the census re
ports, is Florida, with a wealth of
$1,049,138,228. By the same census
reports the state of Maine Is credited
with a wealth about the sumo as Flor
ida's, $1,069,594,027. Hut the income
and excess profits taxes paid by Flor
ida for the last fiscal vear were $4,
639,716. The state of Maine UHid
$12,016,085. ,
"Look nt the table and you will see
that South Carolina has a wealth of
$1.351,400,75.1, and that South Caroli
na's taxes were $7,884,000. Then look
at Rhode Island and you will see that
the wealth of that state is on!v S97i-l
802,690, hut Rhode l:il.ir. I s taxes
were J16,385,54S.
"Vermont ivnd Nov.' Hampshire
mountainous, largely htrnn. have
not, both put together, anything Wie
the wealth of Misshs'ppi. Hut the
tatde shows that while Vermont and
Xew Hampshire together have less
than $1,200,000,000 o wraith, and
while Mississippi has about 4 1 , n 4 r, . -noo.OOO
of wealth. Vermont and New
Hampshire paid nearly .win; the tux
es $9,900,000 paid 'by MiiMvslr.ii.
$4,964,000.
"Oeorsia is one of the great states
of the old south. Georgia has a larger
weaitn 2. 3X2.600. 866 than Con
necticut, with $2,285,454,659. Geor
gia paid some $16,230,000 of taxes.
Connecticut paid some $62,190,000.
"Texas, the largest state in the
solid south, is the richest state in the
solid south. Texas has more wealth
than Massachusetts by half a billion
dollars, but Texas paid in taxes some
$30,313,000, while Massachusetts
paid $160,598,000.
"To preserve our own neutrality in
this review of sectional taxation, let
us merely mention New York with its
twenty-five billions of wealth, but its
$t!)9,26o,600 taxes of the last fiscal
year. Let us go on to others. Wis-
consin.wlth $4,487,725,258, has less
wealth than Oklahoma with $4,581,
091,918. Oklahoma paid in taxes $18,
261.000: Wlneonsin paid $.19,192,000.
Michigan, with only, 20 per cent more
wealth $5,427,022,651 than Okla
homa, paid 290 ?er cent more taxes
than Oklahoma.
"Take, all these states of the solid
south in a string: Virglna, North
Carolina, South . Carolina, Ooorgla,
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louis
iana, Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas.
Their combined wealth is billions on
billions more than Ohio's; indeed, it
nearly three times Ohio's. Yet

Do you still jump ovcrr time u tire

Well. Hint's "wnr nerves" the
civilian for shell-shock!
."Do you have "war-nerves?"
Do you still jumn every time an
automobile tire explodes or a small
boy shoots off a pop-gun or bursts a
milk bottle or a paper bag?
Do you still thrill and quiver at tho
sound of an airplane humming over
your roof or the ominous scream of
a siren on a passing fire engine?
Do you wake 'up in the middle of
the nbjht and lie there.
Tossing and tossing for hours and
hours, '
And trying to decide what ought to
be done with the kaiser.
And just how to do it
Without making a "martyr" and a
"hero" of him.
''And whether or not wo ought to
feed the German people,
And how long it will be before we
get all "the darling boys" back home?
And, after awhile, you doze off
And dream that you are trimming
the kaiser's mustaches,
And telling him to "Sit STILL?"
Or that you are quarreling with the
Tlolsheviki and calling them "NO
gentlemen," and names like that?
Or that the ex-crown prince has
gotten in by the dumb waiter and is
looting your jewel-box and trylnsr to
kiss the maid?
Or that von Tirpitz is fitting on top
of an Alp building a Swiss navy out of
cheese boxes and nobody'H stop
him?
And then.
Do you wake up suddenly with a
wim start
At the sound of a vicious bang on
your front door.
And realize that it's nothing but the
arrival of your morning newspaper.
And spring out of bed and rush
down the hall and snatch it in
And devour the headlines (to see
who's abdicated this morning).
Justas vou did in the most excitina
,dayn
Before PEACE was declared,
And have n violent argument with
the family at the breakfast table
Over what the final peace terms
OUGHT to be and why.
And all that?
And do you go to bed at night
And start it all over again.
And wake tip feeling as tired and
worn out, and utterly fagged.
As though vofl had fought the
WHOLE WAR single-handed,
tVith nobody to help you
Except President Wilson?
Well, THAT is "WAR-nerves"
Which is the civilian for shell
shock! And, if you still have them (as so
many of us have).
The only thing to do is to "forget
it," and put on your hat and go out
for a long walk and drop the whole
matter,
And leavo the presidents and kings
and nations and thinus to take care
of themselves.
No matter what the CONSEQUENCES!
Anyway, they can't blame YOU!

THR TOOK -MAX'S MEJHCIXF.
The revenue bill now being framed
In congress places a trade tax on the
manufacturers of proprietary medi
cines, in addition to all the other tax
es common to business.
The rule has been to tax incomes
and excess profits, except where to
tax would be absorbed by the public,
as in increased railroad fares and
freight rates.
There is much difference of opinion
as to the value .of patent medicines,
just as there is much difference In
the value of such medicines. But of
one thing we must not lose sight:
Tho patent medicine is the common
medicine of .the poor and of the peo
ple who live in remote country dis
tricts. The mother usually comes to know
fairly well what la the best remedy
for her children when they need a
corrective, and she can send to any
store and for a few cents get what
the child needs.
Really we see no occasion for the
revenue bill to single out tho medi
cine of the poor as a worthy object
of special tax. It sounds a good deal
like the work of tho American Medi
cal society.

ANOTJIF.lt GKItMAX MISTAKE.
Admiral von Reuter, commander of
the German fleet which surrendered
to the allies, has protested against the
order of ' Admiral Beatty directing
that tho German flag bo hauled down.
The German admiral says:
"I esteem it unjustifiable and con
trary to International custom. More
over, 'in my opinion, the prder to
strike the flas was not In keeping
with the Idea of chivalry between the
)wo honorable opponents."
The German admiral makes the
mistake of assuming there are two
honorable opponents. The opponent
that resorted to such atrocities as
sinking the Lusitania and of torpedo
ing hospital ships can lay no claim to
honor.'ihjcness in any particular.
roads and for the public in the fu
ture. Exceptional circumstances and ex
ceptional methods of administration
were not needed to convince us that
the railroads were not equal to the
immense tasks of transportation im
posed upon them by the rapid and
continuous development of the indus
tries of the country.
We knew that already. And we
knew that they were unequal to it
partly because their full, cooperation
was rendered impossible by law and
their competition made obligatory, so
that It has been Impossible- to assign
to them severally the traffic which
best could bo. carried by their respec
tive lines in the interest nt expedi
tion and national-economy.
Hopes for I'eaco by Spring.
We may hope, I believe, for tho
formal conclusion of. tho war bv
treaty by the time spring has come.
The twenty-one months to which the
present control of the railways is
limited after formal proclamation of
peace shall have been made will run
nt the farthest, T take it for granted,
only to the January of 1921. The full
equipment of the railways which the
federal administration had planned
could not be completed within any
such period. The present law does
not permit the use of the revenues
of the several roads for the execu
tion of such plans except by formal
contract with their directors, some of
whom will consent, while some will
not. and therefore does not afford
sufficient authority to undertake im
provements upon the Hcale ' upon
which it would be necessary to un
dertake them.
Every approach to this difficult
subject-matter of decision brings 11s
face to face, therefore, with this un
answered question: wjint is right that
we should do with the railroads. In
the interest of the public and In fair
ness to their owners?
Let me say at once that I have 110
answer ready. The only thing Unit is
perfectly clear to me is that it is not
fair eitherto the public or to the own
ers or the railroads to leave the ques
tion unanswered and that It will pre
sently become my duty to relinquish
control of the roads, even beforo the
expiration of the stautory period, un
less there should appear some clear
prospect in the meantime of a. legis
lative solution. Their release would
at least produce one element of a so
lution, namely certainty and a quick
stimulation of private initiative,
I believe that it will be serviceable
for me to set forth as explicitly as
possible the alternative courses that
lie open to our choice. We can sim
ply release the roads and go back to
the old conditions of private manage
ment, unrestricted competition, and
multiform regulation by both state
and federal authorities; or we can go
to the opposite extreme and establish
complete government control, accom
panied, if necessary, by actual gov
ernment ownership; or wo can adopt
an intermedite course of modified pri
vate control, under a more unified
and affirmative public regulation and
under such alterations of the law as
will permit wasteful competition to be
avoided and a considerable degree of
unification of administration to be ef
fected, as, for example, by regional
corporations under which the rail
ways of definable area would be in
effect combined in single systems.
The one conclusion that I am ready
to state with confidence is that it
would be a disservice alike to the
country and to the owners of the mil
roads to return to tho old conditions
unmodified. Those are conditions of
restraint without development. There
Is nothing affirmative or helpful about
them. What the country chiefly needs
is mat an or its means of transporta
tion should be developed, its railways.
its waterways, its highways, and ts
country' side roads. Some now element
of policy therefore Is absolutely nec
essary nessary for the service of the
public necessary for the release of
credit to those who aro administering
the railways, necessary for the protec
tion oi tneir security holders. The old
policy may be changed much or little.
nut surely It cannot wisely be left as it
was. I hope that the congress will
have a complete and Impartial study
of the whole problem instituted at
once and as rapidly ag possible.
Anoinires (j to Paris.
T stand ready and anxious to re
lease the roads from the present con
trol, and I must do so at a very early
(late If by. waiting until the statutory
limit of time Is reached I shall be
merely prolonging the period of doubt
and uncertainty which Is hurtful to
every Interest concerned.
I welcome this occasi6n to announce
to the congress my purpose to join in
Paris tho representatives of the gov
ernments with which we have been
associated in the war against the cen
tral empires for the purpose of dis
cussing witii them the main features
of the treaty of peace. I realize the
great, inconveniences that will attend
my lenvinff the country, particularly
nt lis time, hut the conclusion that it
was my paramount dutv to go has
been forced upon me by consideration.
which I hope will seem os conclusive
to you as they have seemed to me.
The ailie dgovcrnments have accept
ed me bases or peace which I outlined
to the congress on tho 8th of Janu
ary last, as the central empires also
nave, ana very reasonably desire my
counsel in their interpretation und ap
plication, and it is highly desirable
that 1 should give it in order that the
sincere desire of our government to
.contribute without selfish purposes
of any kind to settlements that will
be of common benefit to all the na
tions concerned niay be mado fully
niantrest. The peace settlotnents which
are .now to be agreed upon are of
transcendent importance both to ua
and to the rest of the world, and I
know of ho business or interest which
should take precedence of them. The
gallant men of our American forces
on land and sea have consciously
fought for the ideals which they knew
to be the ideals of their country; 1
have sought to express those Ideals:
they have accepted my statements of
them as the substance of their own
thought and purpose, as the associated
governments have accepted them; I
owe it to the mto see to It, so far as
in me lies, that no false or mistaken
interpretation is put upon them, and
no possible effort omitted to realize
tnem. it is now my duty to play my
full part in making good what they
orrored their life's blood to obtain. I
can think of no call to service which
could transcend, this.
"I shall be in close touch with you
and with afiairs on this side of the
water, and you, will know nil that I
do. At my request the French and
English governments have absolutely
removed the censorship of cable news
which until within a fortnight they
had maintained, and there is now no
censorship whatever exercised at this
and except upon attempted trade com--municatioBs
with enemy countries. It
nas been necessary to keep an open
wire constantly available between
Paris and the department of state and
another between France' and the de
partment of war. In order that this
might be done with the least possible
interference with the other uses of
tlie cables, I have temporarily taken
over both cables in order that they
may be used as a single system. I did
so at the advice of tho most experi
enced cable officials and I hope that
the results will justify my hope that
wie news ot tne next tew months may
pass with the utmost freedom and
with the least posslhle delay from each
side of the sea to thetither.
May I not hope, gentlemen of tho
congress, that In the delicate tasks
I shall have to perform on the other
siae or the sea, In my efforts truly
and faithfully to interpret the princi
ples and purposes of the country we
love, I may have the encouragement
and the added strength of your united
support? I realize the magnitude and
difficulty of the duty I am undertak
ing; I am poignantly aware of the
grave responsibilities. I am the serv
ant of tho nation. I have no private
thought or purpose of my own in per
forming such an errand. I go to give
the best that is in me to the common
settlements which I must now assist
ift arriving at in conference with the
other working heads of the associated
governments. I shall count upon your
friendly countenance and encourage
ment. I shall not be Inaccessible.
The cables and the wireless will ren
der me available for any counsel or
service you may desire of me, and I
shall be happy in the thought that I
am constantly In touch with the weigh
ty matters of domestlce policy with
which we shall have to deal. 1 shall
make my absence as brief as possible
and shall hope to return with the hap
py assurance that It has been possi
ble to translate Into action tho great
Ideals for which America has striven.

Weirlngen. Holland. Two hundred
loose-breeched, wooden-shoed Dutch
fishermen, two local policemen, a bur
gomaster and ,half a dozen newspaper
men, the only American among them
being the World and Journal corre
spondent, silently watched the crest
fallen crown prince of Germany land
at 1:30 on this recent bitter cold and
cheerless afternoon on this dismal is
land In the Zuyder Zee, where he has
peen rormaily interned.
the "has-been crown prince, as
the Dutch call him. was accompanied
by a small personal suite. He landed
from a white 50-foot Dutch govern
ment yacht, the Noord Holland, and
he cut a pathetic comedy figure as he
posed conspicuously in the stern, try
ing to keep up appearances as he gazed
on the unpromising shore and its
deadly dullness.
Forced, a Grin.'
His sheepish grimaces were plainly
forced. He wore a green Alpine hat
wiui a reatner, an old winter sheep
skin front coat with n, beaver collar.
He twirled a pair of gray suede gloves
In lieu of a cane. ' '
With cries of "Bcggnr!" by the
Dutch " populace at Enkhulsen. his
port of debarkation, still ringing In his
ears, he looked pitifully self-conscious
and nervous, as if really dreading the
jeers of a hostile reception on the Is
land, although he feigned an air of
nonchalance while puffing' a cigarette
and even forced .himself to be jocose
with his equally nervous entourage.
As the yacht warped into tho pier
he saluted stiffly and seemed greatly
relieved when the stoic fisherfolk
hurled no Invective at him.
A Silent Reception. 1
It was a perfectly silent reception. 1
He was not permitted to lund until the
Dutch lieutenant, his chaperon for
the internment, surveyed the scene and
caller out loudly in German phrase
which meant: "All right, you can get;
busy now." Then the crown prince j
leaped ashore,' dashing across a nar-r
row roadway like a frightened jack-;
rabbit Into a waiting ramshackle, two-:
horse, seagoing cab, the best the town .
could boast.
He looked shyly from the windows!
and began to salute and bow to the
fisherfolk. When, far from cheering,
the stoic natives failed to respond to
courtesies of their unwelcome guest,
he checked himself.
Leaving his suite to look after the
ex-roval baggage, the ex-crown
prince directed the cabman to go full
speed to the parsonage .which had
been selected for his use. Arriving
there after 11 drive of nearly an hour,
a fresh shock awaited him, which
probably brought home to him more
vividly than had anything else the
depth of his fall.
He saw there that his house of de
tention is a mean two-story brick
structure which would pass for an ex
tremely modest tenement in furthest
Bronx.- The impression it made on the
new arrivals was tersely expressed by
the German orderly who showed the
World correspondent the bedroom of
his chief, saying, with a sob in his
voice: "Es ist tranrlp, damn it." (In
plain English, "This is tough," &c).
A hallvoom In a Harlem flat is quite
sumptuous in compparison with this
chamber, which is done in dingy, dark
green paper. There is a single bed
stead with an iron frame, a small
dresser in one corner, an oil stove in
the other, and in the center of the
room a tiny table, adorned with a
photograph of the ex-Crown Princess
in an old gold frame, two photo
graphs of the ex-kaiserin in wooden
frames, an atomizer and other bottles
and some shabby writing material.

Vain is the chiming of forgotten bells
That the wind sways above a ruined
shrine,
Vainer his voice, in whom no longer

Hunger that eraves immortal Bread

Light songs we breathe, that perish
with our breath,
Out of lips that have not kissed the
rod,
They shall not live who have not

They only sing who are struck dumb

HEALTH TALK
SPANISH INFIitJENZA OR GRIP
' BY DR. LEE H. SMITH.
An old enemy Is with us again, and
whether we fight a German or a gorm,
we must but up a good fight, and not
be afraid. Tho Influenza runs a very 1
brief course-when-the patient is care
ful, and if we keep the system In good
condition and throw off the poisons
which tend to accumulate within our
bodies, we can escape the disease.
Remember these three C's a clean
mouth, a clean skin, and clean bowels.
To carry off poisons from the system
and koep the bowels loose, daily doses
of a pleasant laxative should be taken.
Such a one is made or jviay-appie,
leaves of aloe, root of Jalap,' and call
ed Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets. Hot
lemonade should be used freely ir at
tacked by a cold, and the - patient
should be put to bed after a hot mus
tard foot-bath. -
To prevent the attack of bronchitis
or pneumonia, and to control the pain.
Anuric tablets should be obtained atJ
the drug store, and one given every
two hours, with -lemonade. The Ane
uric tablets were first discovered by
Dr. Pierce.' and.- as they flush the
bladder and cleanse the kidneys, they
carry away much of the poisons and
the uric acid. . '
It Is Important that broths, milk,
huttermllk, leo-cream and simple diet
be given regularly to strengthen the
system and. Increase the vital resist
ance. The fever is diminished by the
use of the Anuiio tablets, but In ad
dition, tho forehead, atms and hands
may be bathed with water (tepid) in
which a tablospoonful Of salaratus
has been dissolved In ft quart. After
an attack ot'gripi or pneumonia to
build up and strengthen the system,
obtain at the drug store a good iron
tonic, called "Irontic" Tablets, or
that well known herbsl tonic. Dr.
Pierce's Qolden Medical Plscpvery.
