The second annual address of President
McKlnlej to congress is one of cxtraordi
7i.iry length, but It is likewise one of ex
traordinary Interest. Like the other state
papers of tho president It. is written in
plain, direct and forcible language, and; for
this reason, as well as for the importance
of the subjects treated, the message is ab
sorblnglj" Interesting in spite of its for
midable volumlnousness.
The president Is somewhat handicapped
Jn making recommendations at this timo
upon some of the leading questions before
tne nation. The fact that a treaty with
Spain has not jet been concluded makes it
impossible for the executive to outline his
policy as to permanent colonial govern
ment. He goes 'far enough, however, to
show that he lb In hearty sjmpathy and
accord with tho popular sentiment for ex
pansion, both In the Atlantic and the Pa
cific Inasmuch as tho report of the Nicara
guan commission will soon be laid before
congress, the president has deferred de
tailed suggestions on the canal scheme un
til a more appropriate time, presumably in
the near future, but he takes the present
opjioriuntty to urge upon congress the'
great, expediency o such action as will
lead to the earliest possible construction of
tho canal, and there Is no intimation thatj
any governments other than those from
which concessions must be secured will be
taken into consideration.
ThcHnwalran wyramisslon's report' not
having been, submitted to congress, cour
tesy demands that Uie government of the
annexed islands be not discussed in detail
by the president until congress has heard
from the men appointed by" the executive
to investigate and make recommendations.
The message contains enough to make it
plain that President McKinley believes tho
United States should not hesitate to as
sume the responsibilities imposed and en
joy the advantages offered as a. result of
the war with Spain. If anj thing were
lacking on other points to make this mean
ing clear, conclusive evldenco may be-found
In the president's recommendation that the
regular army be Increased to 100,000 men,
that the navy be substantially strength
ened, and that the merchant marine be
generously fostered. ,
In reviewing the causes, the declaration,
the progress and the conclusion of the
war, the president has elaborately covered
very familiar ground, jet it Is entirely
wilhin his official province and in accord
ance with distinguished precedent thus to
summarize and estimate facts that must
necessarily mark an epoch In the nation's
history. It Is characteristic of the presi
dent that while he pays the highest trib
ute, personal and general, to those who
won the victories in the late war. he does
not forget the dark side of the subject and
takes occasion once more to deplore all
contingencies that make war necessary.
In connection with this, the part of the
message referring to the proposed armistice
is especially lnterestlngand Instructive. The
efforts of the president to prevent war,
the almost altruistic attitude assumed for
a time In order to achieve that end. and
the final disappointment over the failure of
his efforts, denote the greatness of the
man and the determination of the execu
tive. The president Is unequivocal in his recom
mendation that ample provision be made
for the assistance of Cuba toward the free
dom and independence vouched for in
United States Intervention.
The recommendations of the last annual
message touching currency reform are re
newed, with special emphasis upon the
point that United States notes, taken by
the treasury in exchange for gold, should
be paid out again In exchange for gold
only, thus protecting the treasury gold re
serve. Among the wise suggestions made are
one for the Inauguration of proceedings
designed to bring about an International
agreement for the protection of all private
property at sea during war; one for the es
tablishment of an international cable sjs
tern similar In service to that of the pres
ent potal system: one to facilitate foreign
trade: one to make thoroughly satisfactory
to both parties, as far as practicable, the
relations between the United States and
Canada; and one to appoint a sanitary
commission to investigate the causes of
and remedies for jellow fever.
The message Is deferential to the people
and to congress. It Is characterized by
broad statesmanship and executive thor
oughness. Necessarily Indefinite upon
problems now in the hands of various com
missions. It is strong and decisive upon
questions ripe for congressional action. It
lone; messages are ever pardonable, the
length of this ono is justifiable
Mill IN OV TIIR a.
Captain Alfred T. Mahan, the great naval
expert who stood close at the right hand of
Sccretarj Long during our war with Spain,
has an article In McCIure's which throws
considerable Hglil on tho plans under which
our navy operated. It was tne determina
tion of the government to keep so strong
In our own waters that any possible offen
she operations by the Spaniards could be
met with the certainty of Spanish defeat,
and for this reason Watson's fleet was not
drawn off to go in pursuit of Camara when
be started from Cadiz to the Philippines.
"The chances of-ahe race to Manila, be
tween Camara and the two monitors from
San Francisco," sajs tho captain, "were
deliberately taken, in order to insure the
retention of Ccrvtrais fleet In Santiago; or
Its destruction, in case of attempted es
cape. Not till that was sufficiently pro
vided for would Watson's division be al
lowed to depart. Such exclusive tenacity of
purpose, under suspense. Is more difficult
of maintenance than can be readily rec
ognized bj thoe who have not undergone
it. To avoid misconception. It should be
added here that our division at the Phil
ippines was not itself endangered, although
It was quite possible that Manila bay
might have to be temporarily abandoned.
If Camara kept on. The movement of the
monitors was well In hand, and their junc
tion assured, even tinder the control of a
commander of le-s conspicuous ability than
that already shown bj Admiral Dewev.
The return of the united forces would
speedily have insured Camara's destruction
and the restoration of previous conditions.
It is evident, however, that a certain,
amount of national mortification, and pos
siblv of political complication, might have
occurred in the interim."
The captain speaks cautioii'-lv but what
he evidntlj means to --av is that it was
arranged bv tho navv derailment that if
the monitors could not arrive at the Phil
ippines before the Spjnish fleet, Dencj was
to abandon Manila baj, come out and meet
the monitors and then the united forces
were to turn back and give Camara battle.
While the American people then had and
still have every confidence in the skill of the
navj department they are trulj glad that it
did not happen this waj and that the
American forces were not forced to vicld a
single inch of ground or water gained anj
w here.
From an explanation of the naval cam
paigns Captain Mahan turns to a discus
sion of his favorite topic, the kind and
class of vessels best calculated to compose
an effective navy. First and foremost, he
objects to tho monitors, saving: "If jou
wish permanent defenses for jour coasts,
rely exclusively upon stationary works, not
upon floating batteries which have the
weakness of ships. If vou wish offensive
war carried on vigorously on the seas,
rely exclusively upon ships that have the
quality of ships and not of floating bat
teries. We had in the recent hostilities 26,-
000 tons of shipping sealed up in monitors.
There was not an hour, from first to last.
1 will venture to saj, that we would not
gladly have exchanged the whole six mon
itors for two battleships of less aggregate
displacement."
The monitor Is the product of a m'staken
notion about war. It was conceived out of
the Idea that a war of defense meant hug
ging our own shores and harbors, waiting
for an enemy to put in an appearance,
whereas the best defensive war is the one
where our ships go out in search of the en
emy and render him powerless to approach
our shores. Many naval notions have un
dergone a change during the past few
years. The Ideal battleship of a generation
ago was the big frigate which was able to
roam the seas and whip all single-handed
adversaries. Now the problem is not how
to make the most effective ship, but how to
make the most effective fleet of ships, for
fleet lighting is almost certain to be the
characteristic of future naval wars. Cap
tain Mahan would not build a battleship of
more than 12,000 tons displacement. He de
clares that the gun-fire of such a ship is
almost equal to that of the largest light
ing vessel ever floated. Along this line he
says: "A country can, or will, pay only
so much for its war fleet. That amount of
money means so much aggregate tonnage.
How shall that tonnage be allotted? And,
especially, how shall the total tonnage in
vested in armored ships be divided? Will
you have a few very big ships, or more nu
merous medium ships? Where will you
strike jour mean between numbers and in
dividual size? You cannot have both, un
less jour purse is unlimited. The Santiago
Incident, alike in the battle. In the preced
ing blockade, and in the concurrent ne
cessity of sending battleships to Dewey,
illustrates various phases of the argument
In favor of numbers, as against extremes
of Individual size. Heavier ships were not
needed: fewer ships might have allowed
some enemy to escape; the Massachu
setts and the New York both being
necessarily, though temporarily, absent,
would, had the ships been bigger and
fewer, have taken much more, proportion
ately, from the entire squadron1. Above all,
had that aggregate, 63.934 of tonnage, in
seven ships, been divided among five only,
of 13,000 each, I know- not how the two
ships that were designated to go with Wat
son to the Philippines could possible have
sailed."
KIHTOHIM, NOTES.
As wo suspected, the president does not
tako that dark hrov. n Pettigrew view cf
the country's futuie.
The message is long enough to afford
Democratic critics considerable choice of
grounds for unhapplness.
The house gnllerles are warned that this
is positively tho last engagement of the
popular comedian, Hon. Jerry Simpson.
The Hon. J. Hamilton Lewis may pull
himself together for a last ditch fight on
czarism. In spile of the Ingratitude of re
publics. Owing to the fact that a number of
commissions had not jet reported, the
president was compelled to cut his mes
.uge short.
The. office of speaker of the national
house is not covered bj- the civil service
rules, but the merit sjstem is having quite
a run th,ere.
Spain ma j have weak defenses, weak
credit and weak principles, but while the
garlic crop holds out she will hive a,
strong breath.
It might be well to inform the people of
Porto Rico and Hawaii that they will not
bo expected to read everj line of presi
dential messages.
The fact that the peace treatj- is not
jet signed maj- account for the president's
failure to mention Miss Jessie Scblej and
her clinching work.
The vacant lot owner might be induced
to compromise. He would probablj agree
to cut the weeds in winter and shovel oft
the snow in summer.
If It Is all the same to the weather de
partment, Kansas Citj- would prefer to
take the remainder of her season's snow on
the installment plan.
Every man has his limitations. Presl
flent McKlnlej' is a success as president,
but he would hnrdlj give satisfaction as
an editorial paragrapher.
Democratic contemporaries arc now busily
bringing out editorials written last week
,o the effect that the message Is a "re
markably weak: document."
A correspondent writes to Inquire how
much a daj our commissioners at Paris
get for ; killing time." If wo are correctly
informed, thej- are doing peace work. (
There seems to be a disposition to
charge up all the mistakes of the San
tiago campaign to General Shatter and
give the credit of the victory to somebody
else.
"Is Carl Schurz right?" asks a Chicago
writer. If he !, the countrj- has been
grosslj misinformed. It has been under the
impression all along that he was Carl
Schurz.
There is doubtless need of currencj" re
form, but this is one of the needs the
country takes little Interest in when
times are good and monej" plentiful. Cur-lentv-
reform maj have to wait.
"It is unreasonable to expect a train rob
berj" at Kansas City every dav." sajs the
Chicago Tribune. Certainlj it is. The best
we can offer as a regular performance Is
a nlghtlj holdup or two. Train robberies
aie gala events.
Mr. Bankhiad, or Alabama, wants to Ik
the Democratic leader in the house. Bank
head, however, is unpleasantlj suggestive
of mudhcad. and there has alreadj" been
too much of that sort of leadership on the
Democratic side.
Complaint is made of the qu ilitv of gum
ucd on the 2-cent postage stamp. When
an uncanceled stamp is peeled off an en
velope it is almost Impossible to make it
stick again without regummliig. Will tho
postmaster general kindly look after this?
Citizens would clean their sidewalks of
snow much more promptly ard cheerfully
if it were not that they know the walks
in front of two or three vacant lots they
hive to pass in reaching a car line will
not be cleaned. The vacant lot in this
city seems to be independent of all police
regulations!.
NOTES AND NOTIONS.
Did jou know that there are twentj-two
constructions possible for the participles?
If not. jou should wake up, for Superin
tendent Strjker knows it, and insists that
this know lodge Is necessary for a competent
teacher. Here are some of them: Subject
of a Unite verb, object of a transitive verb,
complement of a copulative verb, subject
of an infinitive, subject of a participle, ab
solute by exclamation, absolute bj pleo
nasm, ab-olute bj inscription, absolute bj
response, absolute by interrogation, abso
lute with a participle, absolute without a
participle, and so on. Isn't it wonderful!
And what do jou think of this as a model
sentence: "The boj had hope of his hav ing
lost the monej being forgiven."
There arc more wonderful tilings In a
set of questions for a teachers examina
tion than are dreamed of in the realm of
common life. Here. Tor instance, is a set
of questions prepared by President Will, of
the agricultural college, "which are to be
answered in less than two hours, of which
the following are two samples: Compare
and contrast the eastern and western
hemispheres as to size, shape, areas of
mountainous and flat countrj", deserts, for
est", seas, gulfs, bajs, lakes, and river
sj stems: Give a political review of the
ten chief nations of tho world, showing tha
relations of each to the others In forms of
government, friendliness, hostilltj-, or
armed- neutralitj-. And the victim is asked
to answer eight such questions in less
than two hours), and spend his daj" over
five or six sets of similar questions in
other lines. -
After setting his mines in the grammar
questions alreadj- referred to, Mr. Strjker
spit on his hands and, for the boats that
might get past the mines, mounted a bat-terj-
In the shape of a set of questions on
United States history. Here are a couple
of them: Give the authors of the follow

GIvo principal features of the treatj" of
Paris, made September 3. 17S.1
The theorj- of these questions in general
seems to be, not to find out whether the
candidate knows the chief things thit he
ought to know, but to catch him in some
thing or other that he doesn't know.
It is one of the wajs that the Lord has
for chastening the Fpirits of proud and
sensitive men, to subject them to the dic
tation and control of men who know little
about the work they are sent to supervise.
This is the mlserj" of the public board s s
tem. The late Principal Thring, who built
up the great Uppingham school in the face
of sucli ignorant clogs, thus expresses his
torment: "You cannot concelvo how gall
ing It Is to the flesh to have to meet a set
of irresponsible, clever. Ignorant men,
armed with absolute power, and see them
dissect jour own heartstrings in a clumsy,
omniscient waj", and issuo their flat on trte
one great work of jour life and a ubje-t
jou understand, thej" don't." Tho situa
tion Is Improved bj having onlj trained
specialists appointed on such boards, but
the evil not alwajs obviated.
Here is John Henrj Bairows, for in
stance, who has just accepted the presi
dencj of Oberlin college. He is himself a
broad though not profound scholar. He
has had experience in education from the
district school up to the university. He
knows the spirit ot the modern world, and
is filled with its best aspirations as few
are. But when he takes charge of Oberlin.
unless he has obtained a capitulation from
those haughtj" lords, he will be subject In
all his acts and plans to the approval of a
m ljorit j- of a board of trustees, not one of
whom is his peer in the matters which ne
is especiallv called to administer, however
excellent gentlemen thej maj- be. Evcry
one of these good men will feel called
upon to judge of proposed measures as
though he were president. Whj- can thev
not saj : "We hav e found the most romp
tent man in sight to do this work; we are
his assistants, not his rulers."
Concentration of responslbllitj is the
watchword of successful executive work.
With this concentration should go, of
course, full public consciousness of the
place where the responsibilltj Is located.
A measure which went verj foollshlj in
tho face ot this wisdom is an act of the
list Kansas legislature, making the offices
of marshal and attorney in second class
cities elective. These offices are elective
in first class cities, but thej" should not be
so everj where. The major is supposed to
be the responsible officer in the govern
ment of a citj". The marshal and the at
tornej should be his assistants. What
would lie the situation of a chief engineer
or a building contractor whose assistants
and workmen were all selected bj" some one
else? The act should be repealed.
This same Principal Thring, referred to
above, was a man of Intense earnestness.
who by his devotion to the Interests of
his pupils won the honorable distinction of
"pre-emlnentlj- the schoolmaster for dull
bojs." To become such might not seem to
some joung teachers a laudable ambition.
Thej- do not realize to what on extent tho
"dull boy" of the primary and secondary
school Is capable of becoming, and does
become, the strong man of the world.
Quickness, alertness and docility are un-doubtedlj-
tho qualities which make the
most agreeable pupil: but steadiness, re
serve force and stubbornness or firmness,
the seeming opposltes of those qualities,
make much of the success of life. It does
Indeed require an Inspired and consecrated
teacher to have patience with dullness for
tho sake of what maj- lie beneath and
maj- not.
"Work till the end of my life, and lito
till the end of mj- work." That seems
to be a Spartan aspiration, but It was the
carlj- prujer of an English schoolmaster.
After nil, it is not bitter medicine. It is
an aspiration controlled bj- the wis"st of
common sense. How- refreshing it sounds
leside the prajers that aie put up from
all about (he countrj- for leisure; for a
shorter daj's work; for easy loads to
wealth! The happiest individual as well
a.s the happiest people in the world are
those that have work to do. and health
and sense to keep at it. To be suie, there
is a reasonable limit. That limit is whero
labor infringes seriously and distinctly on
health. Bat here, even, emplojmcnt is to
be given the benefit of the doubt. Not only
tho devil, but also disease, finds its easiest
victims among the idle. "Work till the end
of my life, and life till the end of my
work" is a fine prajer.
Talking about constitutional amendments
rnd constitutional conventions, which aro
just now common subjects of discussion
for Kansans. it Is common to urge In fa
vor of a convention that it is impossible
to get through any measuies submitted
singly to popular vote. Up in Minnesota
this fall thej- made a constitutional amend
ment of the verj- small question of giving
women the suffrage in the matter of I?
Lrary boards. The amendment carried,
strange to saj-, for it is a wonder that
any number of people knew anj thing about
it. But let our statesmen submit amend
ments on questions which interest the peo
ple and see whether there will bo no vote.
Let them tij for instance, the question
of capital punishment, and other reforms
of thejienal code, or anj- serious attempt
to remedj- the assessment and taxation
evil. Better twentj- amendments than one
convention.

W. H. T. Wakefield has given the Mound
Citj Republic a copj of the first daily
newspaper published in Kansas, the Kan
sas Freeman, Issued at Topoka, and bear
ing the date of November G, l&S. In pre
senting this ancient relic, Mr. Wakefield
tells the Republic an extraordinary story.
He worked on the paper ard sajs the
printers had to set tjpe with gloves on
because of the cold winds which swept
through the cottonwood log cabin in which
the office did business. A printer setting
tjpe with gloves on would be something
like a dog trjing to cat through his muz
zle. A woman at Mound City his brought
suit for divorce, alleging that when she
is in the preserce of her husband she fears
for her life The husband has been in the
state insane asjlum for nine J ears, and
the woman testifies that she lived with
him eight jears before that, all of which
time he was crazv. No one can blame
the poor woman for wanting a divorce,
but just how she is going to establish
that fear of her life is a curious ques
tion. It is dreadful the waj some of those
people down in Southern Kansas do carry
on. A few months ago a miner bj the
name of Cox came from Illinois to Weir
Citj and got a Job in one of the mines
near bj. He boarded with the Widow"
Davis, and stopping at the Widow Davis'
house was another widow bj the name of
Mrs. Dutcher. Cox represented himself to
be a single man and laid siege to the
heart ot AVidow Dutcher, taking her to
church, where he made loud and long
prajers, and making her the depository- of
all his savings. Bj- and bj- some joker
wrote to Mrs. Cox in Illinois and told her
that if she wished to see her husband alive
she must come at once. With visions of
a deathbed Mrs. Cox took tile first, train
and arrived In good season at Weir Citj"
and then proceeded to the Widow Davis"
boarding house, where a scene naturally
followed. Finding that she had been de
ceived bj a gay deceiver, the Widow
Dutcher took a pistol and also tried to
take her life, but some of the boarders
disarmed her and she then drank a whole
bottle of corn medicine and laid down on
the sofa to' die, or perhaps td aw alt the
one-night cure on some of her irterna!
corns. We cannot speak confidently either
waj about this, for the local paper, from
which we are condensing this account,
seerrs strangeij- evasive on the subject,
but, anj waj- the corn medicine made no
visible efforts in the direction of wafting
the Widow Dutcher toward the golden
shore and she is still alive and happj. ex
cept for a sorrowful consciousness of the
perlldv of man. In the meantime Mrs. Cox
was doing business with Mr. Cox. The
local paper leaves us to surmise the nature
of this transaction also, but it docs relate
that about an hour later a meek and hum
ble man was being led to the depot bj a
robust and portly woman, where tne pair
took a train for far off Illinois.
But when we come to think of it. can
dor comnels us to admit that all of the
scandalous doings are not confined to
Southern Kantis. Once in a while even
the sedate and restful region known its
Western Kansas indulges in something cal
culated to disturb cur moral equipoise. In
evidence of tliN, we subjoin the following
item from the Clntlin Banner: "Something
unusual occurred in town the other daj,

W. A. Maddux is a Kingman county boy
who went on a passenger ship from San
Trancisco to Hong Kong for the purpose
of joining Dewej's fleet as a sailor. He
writes to his mother than on the way
across a Chinese and two Japanese pas
sengers died. The Japanese were tumbled
over into the sea, while the Chinaman
was put on lee and carried to Hong Kong,
and Maddux explains that the captain
saved the bodj- ot the dead Mongol in or
der to receive the $30 reward which tho
Chinese government pajs for the return
of every Chinaman who dies abroad. It
Is the Chinese belief that none can enter
paradise unless ho is buried in the Flowsrj
kingdom, and the spirit of one whose bones
are left abroad must wander the caverns
of darkness until they are brought to the
land of his lathers. We were not aware
that the Chinese government paid for this
service, though it is well known that no
Chinaman ever comes to America without
first arranging to have his body taken
back. AVhen the Chinese Six Companies

In California to resurrect a Chinese grave

MISSOURI POINTS.
"Stubblefield, the Sedalia train robber,
ought to plead self-defense," the Springs
field Republican suggests, "and prov'e that
the engine made a hip pocket piaj- as It
approached. That's the waj It Is done in
Greene countj-."
Senator Cockrell's opposition to an in
crease In the army is nothing to be won
dered at, the Sedalia Capital thinks. Even
during the civil war he thought there were
too mnnv bojs in blue.
Miss Clara, daughter of Postmaster Tre

Champ Clark for congress in '34. but didn't
in '9fi, is to be married next week to Mr.

Retributive justice maj- be on the trail
of one of them. An alleged lieutenant who
delivered a lecture In a Northwest Mis

A. report that the pupils of the Kansas
City public schools are to study art from
living models calls forth the followirg
snarl from Cjnic Ed Howe, of the Atchi
son Globe:
"We presume that in a few months they
will be demanding naked women as sub
jects, it Is ridiculous for school children
to studj- art from living models, and they
do not need naked women to inspect. Pco
plo have come to dislike artists because of
the hjpocrlsy and nonsense connected with
them. Ot the great paintings, very few
are nude. At the world's fair, we remem
ber, the people gathered around such sim
ple pictures as 'Breaking Home Ties,'
"Alone In the World.' etc. there are no
naked women in either picture. The naked
woman fad originated with diipated and
immoral students in Paris, as aid to im
moral meetings. Nnkednes-s i- not an aid
to art; naked women are not necessary to
art. The greatest artists In the world made
their reputations without such nastj- aids."
Rev. Mr. M. B. Epps. one of Mi-souri's

Colonel Corbj-. who Is at his home m St.
Josepn on a Hurt j -daj- sick leave, sajs the
bojs of the Fourth Missouri are much
pleased with their new- camp at Greenville.
S. C. The weather, which was rainj and
disagreeable for a timo after their arrival.
is now delightful, and the health of the
legiment is uncommonlj- good. The efforts
of the women of Northwest MI--ourl to
hive the Fourth mustered out were klndly
reeelved bj- the authorities, the colonel
sajs, but the department saw- in this regi
ment one that could be depended upon in
anj- time of need. The retention of the
regiment in the service is reallj- a compli
ment to it. It is expected that the regiment
will move to the Southern coast, for trans
portation to a foreign shore, during the
middle of Jinuarj. Up to that time there
is no rigorous weather in South Carolina
and life m camp will be agreeable unlil the
bojs are called to move farther South.
Although it is Indisputably true that
manj- of thoM who were more or less
prominent in the deliberations of the re
cent good roads convention at St. Louis
were mere time-serving politicians, present
onlj- through selfish motives, there Is rea
son to believe, as Colonel Martin, of the
Brookficld Gazette, views, its outcome,
that considerable good is likely to result
from tho gathering. "If," as he suggests,
"the movement was not a popular one the
professional politician would steer clear of
it. and while the average American citi
zen would prefer to steer clear of such
horned cattle and accomplish his honest
and deserving object without their help,
thej- can help some, and it Is not the part of
discretion to refuse it. State aid for the
Improvement of roads can be obtained onlj
by organized effort on the part ot the peo
ple. They must show to the powers that
be to the lawmakers, to the governors
and to the other state functionaries that
they are going to have It or that thej"
are going to break something; that thej
demand It. and lr the powers that be re
fuse to grant their demand thero will bo
a new- deal in 'powers that be' in tima
to come. That is the only argument that
will be effective: thit is the impelling
force that must be used if anything is
to be done. When all the people of this
state, or a verj- large majoritj- ot them,
saj- as with one voice measures must bo
taken to Improve Missouri roads, the Im
provement will come, and not before: and
conventions like the one held at St. Louis
are a stepping stone toward the end of the
journej-. They help, for they would not

No Monopolj In Turkeju.
Trom the Chicago Record.
The reported failure ot the enterprising
individual who attempted to run a corner
in turkej-s should be a warning to all finan
ciers who may be tempted to plan similar
enterprises. Theoreticallj- the speculator's
scheme was excellent. He had but to get
control of the sources of turkej- supplj- and
then trust to the tide of holidav sentiment
and the natural state of the public appe
tite to give him his own prices. He failed
because there were too manj" turkej s ard
too manj- turkev- dealers to permit anj- one
man to get a monopolj-. There was noth
ing the matter with the public appetite.
If for any reason he had succeeded there
is no telling what might have happ-ned to
tho Thanksgiving and holidaj- celebrations
of the future. No doubt a turkej- trust
would have been established and this
would have been supplemented by a cran-berrj-
sauce trust and a sjndlcate for the
control of plum puddings and mince meats.
Everj- holidaj- dinner would have been but
a tribute to the appalling power of monop
olj" and oppression would have weighed
upon the people even as thj" ate. Everj'
plump and smoking bird brought to the ta
ble, allunnglj" varnished with its own
basting sauce, would have been an em
blem of the tjrannj- of monopolistic enter
prise. Naturallj- the failure of the turkej- monopolj-
cannot be regarded w Ithnut s itis
factlor. Turkejs will continue to grow and
fatten unwiselj- well, to be sent to market
at competition prices and eaten in the glad
consciousness that there Is one Industrj"
which canno' be monopolized. The turkej
has vindicated himself as the true bird of
freedom.
A Snmple Arirumcnt,
From the Philadelphia Fress.
The following from tho Springfield Re
publican is a sample of the arguments used
bj- the opponents of the annexation of
the Philippine Islands:
"Analjze this question down to the naked
bottom fact, and this republic proposes to
buy lOOCO.noO of people at U a head, to take
them like cattle, and to honor In the
transaction Spain's bad title to their pos
session. Have we not abindoned the trado
of bujlng human beings'' The monstrous)
proposition is not too badlj- stated."
The Republican is one ot the most hys
terical of the little group of newspapers
which are orposing the policy which has
come to be known as expansion. It has
worked everj- argument in the categorj
against that pollcj-, but without avail, and
at last it has to come down to the brutal
one stated.
There Is no profit in a discussion with
such an opponent. His arguments answer
themselves. Thej- repel by their brutalltj".
Finding that the American people cannot
be bullied or bribed from the path thej"
have decided upon the Republican evident
ly thinks thej can be influenced to a change
bj- insult.

From the New v.crk Sun
In inviting President McKlnlej- to be
come the guest of the state on the occa
sion of hit forthcoming visit to the South,
the Alabama house of representatives
passed j-esterday the senate resolution. In
which It was declared that "The Hon. Will
iam McKlnlej", president of the United
States, by his wise, patriotic adminlstra
t'on. has contributed largelj- to the oblit
eration of sectional lines and to the bind
ing together as never before ail territorial
divisions ot the nntlon In the strongest
bonds of union, lojaltj", fraternal lovo and
civil libertj, so that the people of the
United States, irrespective of political creed
and partj- affiliation, bow to-day before
the altar of a common countrj- and kneel
at the shrine ot a reconstructed faith."
If the war had only resulted in that, it
would have been cheap at the price.
