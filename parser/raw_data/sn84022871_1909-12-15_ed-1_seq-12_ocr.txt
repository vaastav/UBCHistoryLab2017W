IELAYA FUYEO IH MESSAGE
May Have Something Further to Say
On Nicaragua In Special -Communication
Big Saving In Government
Expenses Sugar Thieves to Be
Punished Modification of Issue of
Labor Injunctions Urged
Washington, Dec. 8 President
Taft's message to congress, reviewing
his administration, which began on
March 4 last, is a long message and
lacks the spirited English that char
acterized the similar documents of his
predecessor, Mr. Roosevelt.
The most sensational portion of the
message describes "unspeakable bar
barities" of President Zelaya in Nica
ragua. The president says that the
two Americans in Nicaragua were put J
to death unjustly; that the govern
ment is after the sugar thieves of New
York criminally; that his second year
In office will cost $94,000,000 less than
this one; that he favors old age pen
sions for government employes; that
his tariff board is looking into the new
tariff to see if it works properly; he
suggests the text of a law to hurry de
layed cases in court, favors a higher
postage on magazines and periodicals
(not newspapers) , says the tariff is
not the reason for the high cost of liv
ing and asserts that the country is on
the eve of great business expansion.
Referring to the "unspeakable bar
barities and oppression" reported .in
connection with the Zelaya govern
ment, President Taft says that the
two Americans killed there "were en
titled to be dealt with as prisoners of
war." He eays that the government
has taken proper steps to secure jus
tice, and that he may have a special
message on this later.
Three officials have been appointed
to get information necessary to a wise
administration of the new tariff, the
president points out. If it is found
that the present rates are excessive
under the principles of protection set
forth in the national Republican plat
form he will ask congress to fix the
matter up. But he says tariff agita
tion hurts business.
We lack just $73,075,(320 of making
both ends meet at the end of the pres
ent year, next June 30. This includes
$38,000,000 which we have to pay on
the Panama canal construction and
$1,000,000 on the public debt. In
this connection the president says
lhat the canal is going to cost $375,
201,000 instead of $139,705,200, as it
was first figured. The canal is half
done and will be finished June 1, 1913.
The needs of the government "were
cut to the quick" for the next year
that is, the year ending June 30, 1911.
The estimates for that year, Presi
dent Taft says, are $94,000,0)0 less
than the estimates of the cost cf gov
ernment for this year. There has
been a big cut in the army and in the
navy. There are to be built two first
class battleships next year and one re
pair ship. The cut in the army
'estimates next year, under this, is
$45,000,000 , while the curtailment in
the navy Is $38,000,000.
On the question of lessening the ex
penses of the government the presi
dent thinks that to eliminate old and
inefficient employes on a pension
would be a good thing. There can be
no cut in the salaries because of the
high prices; if any change, salaries
should be raised, but there might be a
saving by getting along with fewer
people.
The government got back from the
American Sugar company all the
money which it stole at New York,
and the department of justice is after
the officers and the employes crim
inally. The president does not want
a congressional investigation of this
matter now because he thinks it might
spell immunity for some of the guilty
persons.
Many of the lynchings are due to
the delays of the courts, the presi
dent believes, and he intends to have
a commission suggest a remedy for
'this.
The president askss for the enact
ment of a law forbidding Injunctions
without previous, notice, and an op
portunity to be heard on the other
Blue, unless a delay would entail
great injury. If an injunction is is
'sued without previous notice it shall
expire in seven days or lessK accord
ing to the discretion of the" court, un
less it is renewed after previous no
tice is given and an opportunity for
the other side to be heard.
The president warmly favors an
amalgamation of the various health
bureaus of the government -outside
the army and navy, under one head,
to be called the bureau of public
Jiealth. While the president would
not lift the health bureau to the dig
nity of a department, no doubt the
work which will be carried on by the
new bureau will equal in importance
that of some departments.
A ship subsidy to encourage Ameri
can shipping, publicity of political
- contributions In elections of members
of congress and a fund of . $50, 000 to
aid ' in suppressing the "White Slave"
trade are recommended.
GETS LIFE SENTENCE
Harmon Admits He Is Guilty of Mur
der In Second Degree
Cambridge, Mass.,- Dec. 13.
James M. Harmon, Jr., the youth
charged with murdering Maude M.
Hartley by shooting her at the corner
of Cherry street and Highland ave
nue, Somerville, on Dec - 18, 1908,
Bnd who for two weeks had been on
trial In the Middlesex superior court,
changed his plea of not guilty of mur
der in the first degree to guilty of
ciurder In the second degree. He was
at once sentenced to life imprison
ment in the state prison.
The sensational and unannounced
termination of the case just as it was
about to go to the jury came as a sur
prise. Never before in the history
of Middlesex county has a lesser plea
been accepted so late in the proceed
ings. '
At the .conclusion of the reading of
the sentence, Harmon sat back in
his chair, thrust his hands into his'
trousers pockets and leaned his head
against the cage, the least concerned
apparently of all in the courtroom.
WITNESSES ARE MISSING
lnquirylnto Mine Disscter Halts Un.
til They Can Be Produced
Cherry, Ills., Dec. 12. Inquiry by
the coroner's jury into the causes of
the St. Paul mine disaster came to an
abrupt close without a verdict being
reached or any steps being made to
fix responsibility for the attending loss
of life.
The jury announced that it would
not return a verdict until Alexander
Rosen jack and Robert Dean, the miss
ing witnesses, have either "been found
or the county officials show evidences
of a genuine desire to find them.
It was agreed to adjourn until Dec.
20, to give the county officials an op
portunity to search further for the
missing witnesses.
NEGROES BEATEN
IN BOSTON STREETS
Fifteen Roughly Trealed fcy
Band ot White Raldsrs
Boston, Dec. 13. Some fifteen
negroes were knocked down, brutally j
beaten and kicked, many of them into ;
Insensibility, shortly after midnight j
by a band of white men who raided ;
that section of the city near Castle j
square, shouting "Death to negroes," j
and attacking every negro who put in
an appearance.
-The negro baiting band met stub
born resistance from some of the vic
tims, who pulled razors and pistols
in attempts to defend themselves, but
in no instance was the resistance suc
cessful. The attackers were inflamed
by the reports of outrages in Savan
nah, Ga., the previous day.
Not until no more negroes could be
found in the South End streets did the
band desist in its outrages. The
raiders met no opposition on the part
of the police, who appeared on the
scene only after the fighting was over
and the band had disappeared, having
.nged the streets unmolested for half
an hour.
During this period the residents of
the negro quarter were thoroughly
terrorized, fearing attacks upon their
homes, and large crowds of white
people gathered in the South End
streets to watch the fight.

UND OVER
WITHOUT BAIL
Hattie Le Bianc Must Explain
Murder Case to Grand Jury
Mrs. gloverIe? guardian
Fact Made Public For First Time
When Wife of Murdered 'Man Ap
pears at Hearing as a Witness Ac-;
cused Girl Now Declares That Glov
er Was Shot as He Was Helping
Her Out of Laundry Window
Waltham, .Mass. ..Dec. 9. Hattie
Le Blanc is held for the grand jury.
All the government tried to show at
the hearing before Judge Luce was
that Clarence F. Glover was shot in
the Waltham laundry on the night of
Nov. 20, and in his dying statement
said that Hattie Le Blanc killed him.
Judge. Luce deemed the evidence
sufficient to hold the young woman,
and she was bound over without bail
for the session of the grand jury be
ginning cn the first Monday in Jan
uary in East Cambridge.
As Miss Le Blanc is only 16 years
old the hearing cf her case was pri
vate, as the law says all juvenile
cases shall be. For three hours the
girlish Icoing prisoner sat in the small
library of the district court and lis
tened to the testimony of witnesses
without understanding hardly any
thing of what was said. She speaks
only a few words of English.
Perhaps the most interesting wit-
i ness at the hearing was Mrs. Lillian
M. Glover, widow of the murdered
man. She had been subpoenaed- by
the counsel for the defense and her
testimony occupied about thirty-five
minutes, it is said.
That Mrs. Glover is the legal guard
ian cf Hattie Le BUinc became known
yesterday for the first time. ,
It is optional with the guardian or
parent whether they appear or not. In
addition to the notice sent Mrs.
Glover , as guardian of the irl , she
was also served with a regular sum
mons by the counsel for the defense,
which made her attendance com
pulsory. Hattie Le Blanc's story which her
lawyers expect will free her caused
decided comment when it became
known that she declares Glover was
shot as he helped her from the laun
dry window.
She has changed In many ways her
original story to the police. She now
declares that while in the main room
of the laundry both she and Glover
heard someone coming . in the outer
door cf the laundry opening into the
office.
As he heard the sound Glover called
out: "Get out of here; "run quick, Hat
tie." Hattie Le Blanc then says she start
ed to run toward the rear of the laun
dry, knowing she could escape by the
door down stairs. Glover followed
close behind, urging her to hurry.
She does not know that anyone
was pursuing, but believes there was.
Glover rushed after her in her head
long rush down the stairs.
She made for the window, and as
she gained the sill Glover pushed her
outside. She dropped to the ground
and started to run. Just at this in
stant she heard the shots. - This she
claims is all she knows of the shoot
ing. Hattie also declared that on the
night before Glover was shot Mrs.
Glover asked her to go to the theatre,
and they both visited the Scenic
theatre in Waltham.

THE POULTKY IND-USTKY.
It Is a fact not generally known that
f all farm products poultry stand
fi5th in value. It is estimated that
the cash cte; ived from tiie sale of poul
try and eggs amounts to tealf a billion,
dollar annually. It is believed that )
this amount is being rapidly increased
each year, dne to the fact that farmers
are beginning to realize the profits
there are in a well cared for flock of
hens. When all poultry keepers fully
appreciate how easy it is to increase
the productiveness of tjieir fowls, it
is fair to assume that this, branch of
farm products will advance well toward
first place In' relative value. The fol
lowing letter from C. D. Chatterton of
West Brookfieid, Vt, Indicates the way
In which some are increasing their
egg production. He says : "I have used
'Page's Perfected Poultry Food' for the
last two years, and I got one-third more
eggs thau before. I can't get along
without it."

food and the best ways of usiug tt.
