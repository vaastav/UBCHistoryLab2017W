London, Dee 5. Although the re
pairing of the cable between Aden and
Zanzibar has restored the route via
Aden to South Africa, and thereby re
lieved quite a budget of belated dis
patches there is nothing at hand throw
ing light on General Bulier's prepara
tions for the relief of Ladysmith or
the movements of other British col
umns. News from Ladysmith has been re
ceived up to the night of Wednesday,
November 29, when all was well,- pro
visions were plentiful and the bom
bardment was ineffecvvfc. Dispatches
of the same date from the Boer head
quarters refer to the renewal of a
heavy bombardment with a fourth
siege gun, christened "Franchise,"
which had just arrived from Pretoria,
and a lifeless response from the garri
son. A special dispatch from Durban says
the Boers lost 1,8'JO men at wuat has
been popularly known as the battle of
Gloncoe. It is also said that scurvy
and dysentery are rampant among the
burghers who are beleaguering Lady
smith. A dispatch from Pretoria meuiions
an unimportant sortie from Kimberley
November 27. and says:
'The British prisoners are well. The
government has permitted them to
subscribe to the state library aud also
allows them to purchase beer and
newspapers."
The reports of the abandonment of
the siege of Mafeking. although com
ing from various quarters, are not con
firmed. Apparently Geueral Cronje
left there a force sufficient to hold the
garrison in check.
Lourenzo Marque. Delagoa Bay.
Wednesday. Nov 20. The following
dispatch has been received here:
"Head Laager (undated). General
-Toi'bert has retired fn.m E.tcourt and
is now blowing up Cohmso bridge. He
brings a large herd of cattle and iu-ti'iiri--
concentrating around Lady
smith." LONDON, Dc&. 5. There is little fur-'
ther news from the seat of war. Even
' the latest acco-ants of the battle of Mod
der River fail to give au intelligent idea
J what happened. There is a fueling of
disappointment and a continuing anxiety
respecting Lord Methuen. The Times
says editoria"y:
"The battle affords splendid proof of
the unsurpassed qualities of the British
soldier, but while victories won solely by
the exercise of those qualities are indeed
magnificent they are not war. They fill
us. with pride, but with pride not unmin
gled with regret at the persistent perver
sity of circumstances which apparently
prevents us obtaining equal or greater
results by processes savoring a little of
that military science of which we hear so
much."
Mafeking is safe, or was' so on Nov. 24.
The British had captured 25 burghers of
Commandant Dutoit's force.
A dispatch from Durban says that-per-1
sons arriving there from Pretoria assert j
that the Boers are full of confidence and
are well prepared for a six months' siege
of Pretoria.
Patriotic demonstrations in the thea
ters and music balls of London continue
unabated. There -was a remarkable
scene at the Empire last evening w hen
Mrs. Brown-Potter recited a poem called
"Ordered to the Front," with soldiers
and sailors grouped around her on the
stage. On each side of Mrs. Potter stood
a sailor, one carrying the American and
the other the British flag. When the
curtain fell and rose again to an encore,
she tied the two flags together amid loud
cheering, the audience rising and singing
"G,od Save the Queen." Lord Rothschild
and a nttmber of other prominent men
were in the house.
i The Times has the following from
Frere camp, dated Wednesday, Nov. 29:
"The Boer camp at Colenso is visible
from a point near Chieveley. It is a
strong position and difficult for a direct
front attack."
rThe Cape Town correspondent of The
. Standard says:
"The Cape government intends at an
early date to send one of the ministers to
England to urge upon the imperial au
thorities the acceptance of the Cape cab
inet's view regarding the final settlement
after the war."
The special correspondent of The Daily
News with General Methuen, telegraph
ing from llodder River on the day after
the battle, says, "I hear the Boers are iu
' fuii retreat to Bloemfontein."
, - Mr. Julian Ralph, describing in The
Daily Mail this morning the battle at
Modder River, says:
"I can testify that the British never
'- once taw the enemy, yet they were not
able to raise hand or foot without being
riddled.
"Despite all this, however, the day be
- longed to the artillery. The infantry
never advanced two paces during this
day of hell.. The shells of our 20 guns
were accurately planted in the enemy's
trenches and broke the heart of the
Boers, for after dark they all retreated."
? A : correspondent with General Mc
; tfcuen's column, telegraphing from Mod
' 4trr River last Thursday, says:
- . "The Waterloo of the campaign has
' been -focght and won. The battle was
conducted with unprecedented stubborn-
ness on both sides. There was one con--J
tbtaona roar, like the explosion of connt
less firecrackers. There was no flinching
' - m either side and not a moment's pause.

were mostly served Dy i? rencn ana uer
man artillerists.
"It is believed that the Boers had oc
cupied the position seven weeks before
and had spent the interval in -fortifying
and rendering it, as they considered, im
pregnable. They did not seem to fear to
expend their ammunition, and their guns
were well and smartly bandied.
'"Owing to the bend in the river on the
right the Boers had an opportunity of
cross . firing on the British attack. A
Boer Hotchkiss was directed with mar
velous accuracy against a British Maxim,
killing the sergeant in charge, wounding
an officer and disabling the gun. This oc
curred quite at the beginning of the en
gagement. - Whenever the Boer fire was
silenced in one direction it was immedi
ately reopened in another."
"Owing to the terrific fire nobody on
the plain was out of range. Stretchei
bearers found it impossible to go forward
in the few cases they were called upon to
attend, and the wounded were compelled,
if possible, to crawl out of the lines.
"No quarter seems to have been given
on either side. The British assert that,
amid the bullets, the ambulance wagont
displayed their flags prominently to no
advantage. These were repeatedly driv
en back and compelled to take refuge out
of sight."
The latest advices from Ladysmith.
dated Saturday, Xov. 25. say the shelling
of that place was continued.
It also appears that General Schalk
Burgher, commanding the Boers, sent a
message suggesting that all the wounded
be sent to a neutral camp and that Gen
eral White peremptorily refused, when
it is added, the Boers deliberately shelled
the hospital.
All accounts agree that the Boer shells
were much more damaging than hereto
fore. Many civilians and police were
killed or wounded, while the Liverpool
and Gloucester battalions lost 11 men on
Nov. 24. The siege of Ladysmith was
then growing stronger. The Boers were
estimated to numbi r from 10.000 to 15,
000 men. The health of the British gar
rison was good.
The Boer force at Colpnso is estimated
to be 15,00Q men. with 3 5 guns.
GERMAN FINANCES.
The Bill For Incrpaie of Silver Coins

BERLIN, Dec. 5. The reichstag yes
terday discussed the government's cur
rency bill providing for an increase of

standard, and the stoppage -of the gold
output of South Africa, he asked what
would be the result if the war lasted
longer than a year.
Heir Weltzien (Conservative) remark
ed that the Boers were not only gallant
defenders of their liberty, but also held
the keys of their gold deposits and might
cut off much of Germany's small gold
supply.
Herr Moch. director of the reichsbank,
pointed out that all the great states hed
now adopted the gold standard, which
he regarded settled the question of bi
metallism. The bill was referred to a special com
mittee. Mnny Injured In a Crossing: Collision

ROBERTS M PRESENT.
At the Session of Congress
To-day.
He Wandered Aimles- 'y About the
House President's Message Read
To-day Bill Introduced Yesterday
for Waterbury Public Building.
Washington, Dec 5. The galleries of
the house to-day were almost as
crowded as on yesterday, ihe debate
on the Roberts case being the attrac
tion. 'The reading of the president's
message was completely overshadowed
oy tne universal interest iu the case
of the Mormon reoresentative. Mr
Roberts entered the hall about 11:20
and moved around tho hirl! in a rather
aimless manner.
At 12 o'clock the speaker called tne
Members to order and all arose in their
places (Mr Roberts include I) aud stood
vitn bowed heads wnile the Invocanon
was read. The president's message
w.io then read, the members listening
with great attention to the rending.
y.u abstract of the message will be
found on page G).
The reading of the president's mes
sage will not be finished before 3
o'clock. The Roberts case will come
up immediately afterwards. An agree
ment has been reached by which both
sides shall have one hour each and a
half hour shall be allowed to Mr Rob
erts, who will make a personal defense
against the charge. He has his orig
inal certificate of naturalization which
eminent lawyers in the house who
have' examined it pronounce as genu
ine and regular. It is believed that
the charge that Mr Roberts was not
legally naturalized cannot be held.
Outside of the umrcrous petitions
received yesterday against tbe seating
of Roberts only two bills for Connecti
cut were introduced. Mr Sperry put
in the bill for the public building at
Waterbury, which carries with it an
appropriation of $150,000. Tie also in
troduced the bill for a public building
at Meridpn at a cost of $100,000.
The Connecticut members are still
besieged for positions in the census
bureau, although the cmota from Con
necticut is full. Each senator was al
lowed to name ten enudidates for ex
amination and each member five. Out
of this number six w'll be appointed
for each senator, and three for each
member. Thus far three have been
appointed from Connecticut, one on the
recommendation of each of the sena
tors 'and one from Mr Russell's dis
trict. There: are at present only about
120 clerks -employed r the census of
fice, and very few will be added until
the bureau is removed to the new
building. ' This will be about January
1. It is expected that all the clerks to
be appointed from Connecticut will re
ceive their appointmonts before June
of next year, when the work will be
well under way.
The secretary of the treasury sub
mitted his estimates of the appropria
tions required for the service of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1901. The
Connecticut items are as follows:
For a government building at Nor
wich, $25,000; for a light and fog sig
nal station at New Londnn. $45,000;
same on Peck's Ledge. $10 000: for the
imrpovement of the naval station at
New London, $50,000, increase $25,000.

the woman said to be the original of
Mrs Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward's
famous story, "A Madonna of the
Hubs." Mrs Phelps Ward's summer
home, be it known, is in East Glouces

for taking care of herself.
"So you are the Madonna of the
Tubs?" said the visitors.
"1 am," said the New Englander.
" "And Mrs Phelps Ward wrote a
beautiful story about you?"
"She did."
"Did you ever meet Mrs Ward?"
"I have. After she'd wrote that
Btory she come round here one day
and hunted me up. She said as how
she wanted to -see tne for herself."
. "How interesting!" murmured the
visitors, "and what did yon do?" !
"Oh," repeated the Madonna of the

ANOTHER RAILROAD DEAL.
The Hnntlngton-Speyer Syndicate Has
Purchased More Southern Pacific. .
San Francisco, Dec 5. The Call
prints the following:
"The Huntlngton-Speyer syndicate
which purchased the Crocker and Stan
ford holdings of Southern Pacific
stock, has closed auother immense
deal.
"It comes to light that General
Thomas II. Hubbard, representing the
original Mark Hopkins interest which
passed into the possession of. Edward
F. Searles, has sold to the syndicate
140.000 shares of Southern Pacific
stocks at a price approximating $40
per share. The negotiations were begun
at the time Mrs Stanford sold her
stock, but the transaction was con
ducted with the utmost secrecy. Geu
eral Hubbard still represents as many
shares of stock as he sold to the syn
dicate and will not relinquish his posi
tion as first vice-president of the
Southern Pacific. George Crocker will
leave New York in a few days. He
will travel to San Francisco via New
Orleans and on the journey Inspect the
property of the Facilic Improvement
company."
The Call adds: "The surprise of the
year in the railway world may bo in
reserve. Operations of the syndicate
do not. point to actual buyers other
than Huntington and John W. Mack-
fay, but there are others, because, from
the beginning-, the syndicate nas ueeu
under writing. Despite denials many
railroad men cling to the belief that
the Vanderbilts are in some way con
cerned iu this vast deal in Sotithorn
Pacific compauy securities."

Men's Wages Down About Half.
Bloomsburg, Pa. Doc 5. The adop
tion of a new system of work by the
American Car and Foundry Co, whose
plant is situated at Berwick, near
here, has resulted in a strike involving
250 car builders. WhHe the works
were owned by the Jackson & Woodin
Co several gangs were employed in the
car-building department, and it was
the rule for each gang toAomplete the
car on which it was engaged before
proceeding with another.
The company was recently absorbed
by the combine and under the new
management the different gangs follow
each other over all the cars iu course
of construction, each Laving some part
to build, a plan by which, the men can
make but little more than half then-
former wages. The men appealed to
the district superintendent, but were
told that there was no help for them,
and. the strike resulted. Thus far there
are but 250 men -out.- but-should the
strike continue the -nth, plant will

2,300 men out of employment. '

Reel, general superintendent of Indian
schools, in her annual report makes a
strong plea for compulsory education

New York. Dec 5. At quarantine to
day the Red Star line steamer Fries
land, from Antwerp; fouled with the
British steamer Lassell. coffee laden,
from Santos, which was lying at an
chorage. The Friesland carried away
her bowsprit and may have suffered
other damage. The Lassell had a good
sized hole iu her port through which
the water poured, and she was iu
danger of sinking. Two tugs went
alongside of her and after raising h&r
anchor the Lassell was benched about
a quarter of a mile above the quaran
tine station. '
. .The only damage sustained by the
Friesland so far as could be. seen was
the breaking of a sm:.l! flagstaff on the
jibboora. The flag and staff were re
covered. The Lasell was beached at
the top (if high water on a soft mud
bottom close to Clifton, S. I. When
the Lasell grounded the water was
over the furnace doors and still pour
ing into the vessel," which continued to
settle. The Lasell hf.s 23.538 sack of
coffee on board and was being held
for examination on account of the
plague fears.
