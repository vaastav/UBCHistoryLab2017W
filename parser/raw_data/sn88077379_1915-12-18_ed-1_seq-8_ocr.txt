Labor Forward Movements
Are Practical and Develop Enthusiasm. They
Not Abandon Sentiment and Idealism.
Trade unionists should at .ill times
encourage labor forward movements,
declares the last . I of I., conven
tion, on recommendation of the execu
tive council.
These activities develop enthusiasm in
the workers' cause, thej unfold Rre.it
opportunities for aggressive anion, the)
equip men to defend the philosoph of
trade uiuoiiNiii, the) solidif) the ranks
of those who toil, and the) invariahl)
result m an increased trade union inun
licrslup "The labor forward movement has be
come an established agenc) in the ex
tension of the trade union movement,
.mil has grown increasmgl) in favor,"
s,'i)s the executive eouncil, m its annual
report.
"Perhaps one of the most valuable
' haraeteristies of man) of these move
ments is that the plans for earr)ing out
activities begun hj labor forw.ml move
ments have become a permanent pirt
of the work 'I his indicates the real
ization of the fait that some outlet must
be provided for the enthusiasm and spir
it aroused by the labor forward move
ment. I his special kind of work affords
an opportunit) for aetivit) on the part
of all members of the labor movement
Since it has the effect of developing the
ability and the desire for work on the
part of individual members, it adds pel
inanent strength and aggressiveness to
the organizations
"I he eilucatiou.il value can not be
overlooked ill estimating the labor foi
ward movement
"As the ineiubeis of the laboi move
ment become speakers and orators for
laboi, they, also, becinne defenders of
the cause of tiade unionism, and they
(eel a more intimate concern foi the
success of the cause The success equips
them for larger and widei activities and
greater usefulness m earning on the
worlf-of the movement

President Mow man of the state confir

"It costs 1 r.( a week per child for

President Mow man pointed out that a
child reared 111 a state home gets what
he termed the "institution" viewpoint He
gets the eonimuiiit) idea, but fiom tin
wrong angle 'I he institution child is
used to be waited on and provided for.
When he does have the institution he is
lost, as a rule, and waits 011I) a chance

"The powers of the Governor's office
