MATTERS OF INTEREST TO ALLJ
CITIZENS.
- I
REESE AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE
This is, the Title He Will Bear Until
a Successor is Chosen in the
Year 1914-
The Chief Justiceship.
Judge M. B. Reese will bear the
title of chief justice of the supreme
court from now until a successor is
chosen, who will take his place in.
1914. This was announced the past
week, after a meeting of the new aug-:
mented court. Judge Barnes has held
the title aa ranking member of the
court.
The change was made in accordance
with the interpretation which the
judges placed upon the amendment
providing for the enlarged court. This
provides for the election of three
judges in 1909. They will fill the":
places made vacant by expiration of,
the terms of Judges Barnes, Sullivan:
and Fawcett In 1911 three will be
elected to fill the places at the expira
tion of the terms of Judge Letton..
Root and Rose. In 1913 one judge is,'
to be, elected to fill the place of Judge;
Reese. The constitution in providing"
for the elections makes the judge to'
be elected in 1913 and each six years:
thereafter chief justice. It also pro-'
vldes that the judge whose term ex
pires at that time shall be chief
justice until then.
That the four remaining members;
of the old commission will continue
to serve the state am draw salaries
for a time yet is indicated from the
fact that at the first sitting of the
court seven cases were assigned to
the commission for argument. The
court assigned thirteen cases for ar
gument before itself.
Judge Sullivan was not present
when the court met and. assigned
cases. He arrived later and qualified
immediately, sitting with the court
later to hear argument. Rose, Root-
and Fawcett were already in Lincoln.
Judge Sullivan has since, tendered his
resignation and the same has been ac
cepted. The commissioners whose places
will cease to exist sometime between
now and the first of April are E. R.
Duffie, E. C. Calkins, A. C. Epperson,
and E. E. Good. The commission will;
probably be continued until after the
cases which are in the hands of these
four members have been decided. It'
is not likely, however, that they will'
hear any further cases after the'
present sitting. t
Sullivan's Withdrawal Regretted.
Genuine and general regret has
been expressed on all sides at the de-
termination of Judge Sullivan to re-,
linquish the place on the supreme
bench offered him by Governor Shel-'
rinn. At. the same timA it is freelv iiil.i
mittcd. that Judge Sullivan could not!
Jn justice to himself, have done other
than he did.
There seems to have been a pretty
general feeling, however, that Judge
Sullivan's re-election to the bench
next year, had he cared to enter the
race, would have been without ques
tion. A dozen prominent republicans,
including several state officers, have
said that they believed no man in the
state better qualified for the place
than Judge Sullivan and that they
would be glad of the opportunity to
vote for him.
There is some criticism of Gov.
Sheldon for not making Judge Sulli
van one of the three-year appointees.
It Is possible that, had this been done,
the resignation would not have been
tendered.
More Room Needed.
State Land Commissioner H. M.
Eaton will recommend in his annual
report that, owing to the crowded con
dition of the state capitol building,
the legislature must either abolish
seme of the new departments it has
created or fit up the basement for
office rooms, or move the state library
and the department of justice to the
proposed historical building across the
street from tne capitol grounds. The
latter can be done if the legislature
makes an appropriation for a histori
cal building large enbugh to accommo
date both the society and the depart
ment which it is proposed to house
In the building.
Insurance Company Withdraws.
The Mutual Surety company of New
York has notified Insurance Deputy
Pierce that it has withdrawn from
the state and has so informed its
agents. The company was admitted -o
do business in Nebraska in 190fi and
has been doing business here since.
While no explanation of its withdraw
al was given, it is supposed by the
insurance department that its Nebras
ka business did not justify it taking
out a license for the coming j'ear.
Maupin to Change Tactics.
Will M. Maupin. who has been chos
en labor commissioner by Governor
Elect Shallenberger, will adopt a few
different ideas about the management
of tne bureau. "Mr.' Ryder has done
a great work in gathering agricultural
statistics and calling attention to the
resources of the state." said Mr.
Maupin. "and I shall endeavor to keep
up that record. However, while try
ing to keep that work up to its pres
ent standard. I shall devote consider
able time to industrial statistics and
endeavor to get more information."
Gubernatorial Inauguration.
The democrats not only intend to
make the inauguration of Governor
elect Fhal'ertbcrger an event notable
in 'die history of such afi'airs, but it is
now their intention to follow up 'he
inaugural caremonles with a banq-:et

If a farmer sells hogs at ten dollars
and buys them back in the shape of
ham, bacon and pork at $18, whv
should it not pay him to butcher and
pack meat for bis own use? And if
the handsome profit of eight dollars
per hog over the live selling price
can be realized for himself why would
it not be profitable to pack twice or
three times as much as he needs for
himself and sell it? Perhaps it would
pay him to.igure on butchering 30 or

In tying wool do not use sisal twine,
use hemp. The former will hurt the
sale of your product and for this rea
son: Small bits of the sisal fiber get
into the wool and not taking dyes,
must be picked out by hand. This oc
casions a loss of sometimes as much
as five cents per pound, which must
sventually come from the producer
since manufacturers learn what sort
of stuff is to be expected from a re-
gion and bid for it accordingly. The
twines recommended for use are: No.
1 hemp, or small linen.

A farmer who has tried it says that

We are sorry to say it. but with
most farmers it is purely guess work
as to whether his cows are paying
their way or not. They are strangers,
to the milk scales and the Babcock

of silage, etc., and the result is that
they barely grub out a Ihring. But
thank goodness such termers are
growing less every year.
