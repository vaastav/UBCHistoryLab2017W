yesterday morning. Barely making
headway against the high seas ,the
staunch little craft bucked her way
up the canal about 11 miles when
darkness fell at 7 o'clock last night. |
It was out of the question to run in
the (lurkness, so Capt. Madsen put
the Hegg into Manson'a cove, where
two anchors held her off the shore.
All night long the boat pitched and
tossed, while Capt. Madsen, Louis Lar
sen and Harry Staser clung to the
seats In the cabin. Sleep was out of
.the question.

a native who was chopping wood at

days.
