SENATE COMMITTEE DECIDES
IN FAVOR OF CANAL TREATY
Two of the flemfoers flake Objection to Certain Sec=
tions, but Do Not Vote Adversely.
WASHINGTON, Die. «5.-The
Senate Committee on
elgri Relations to-day "voted
to report favorably the new
Hay-Paunccfote treaty . pro
viding for the construction df an isthmian
canal.
The committee was In session nearly
two hours, and went over in detail the
previsions of the convention. No votea
were cast against It, but it was criticized
very sharply by Senators Money and Ba
con, who found In it many of the objec
tions which they urged against the old
COMMANDING OFFICER OF THE BATTLESHIP IOWA, WHO TOOK SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART IN MAIN
TAINING FREE TRANSIT ACROSS THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA DURING THE RECENT REVOLUTION IN
COLOMBIA, AND A SCENE ALONG THE PROPOSED ROUTE OF THE ISTHMIAN CANAL.
treaty. They took especial exception to
the provision continuing in force the neu
trality provision of the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, and also made exception to the
clause specially authorizing the United
States to police the canal, as placing a
limitation upon the power of this country
to absolutely control it. The contention
was made that the effect of the treaty
»s sent to the Senate would be to deprive
the 'United States of control of the canal
in case of war. **
One of the Objections.
Especial attention was called to the
provision in the preamble of the pending
treaty reserving article VIII of the
Clayton-Bulwer treaty from the repeal
provision of the new treaty. The por
tion of this article of the old treaty to
which objection was made reads as fol
lows:
In granting, however, their joint protection
to any such canals or railways as are by this
article gpecified it is always understood by-

the United States and Great Britain that the
parties constructing or owning the same shall
impose no ether charges or conditions of traffic
thereupon than the aforesaid governments
shall approve of as just" "and equitable; and
that the same canals or railways, being open
to the citizens and subjects . of the United
States and Great Britain on equal terms, shall
also be open on like terms to the citizens and
subjects of every other state which Is willing
to grant thereto such protection as the United
States and Great Britain. engage to afford.
Senators Money and Bacon did not go
to the extent of voting against the re
port of the treaty, and they acknowledge
they are anxious to see It ratified because
of their great desire to have the canal
built. Still they Insisted that the treaty
as it now stands Is very .objectionable in
case of the contingency, of. war.
Rapid Action Is Desired.
Senator Frye presided over the meet
ing, and he authorized Senator Lodge to
report the treaty to the> Senate on Mon
day next in case there should be an ex
ecutive session on that day. It was also
the sense of the committee that the con
sideration of the treaty should be pressed
as speedily as possible, in /the Senate,
some Senators expressing the hope that
action might be secured before the ad
jourriment for the holidays. The com
mittee also voted to recommend that the
Injunction of secrecy be removed from
the treaty.
Senator Bacon moved the revival of the
amendment to the original Hay-Paunce
fote treaty, which' was suggested by Sen
ator Davis, then chairman of the com
mittee, and adopted by the Senate. The
amendment provided, that nothing in
the treaty "should apply to measures
which the United States may find it nec
essary to take for securing, by its own
forces ihe defense of. the United States
and the maintenance ■ of public order."
The amendment was voted down viva
voce. ■ .,
Representative Hepburn of Iowa to-day
introduced his isthmian canal bill, which
Ly reason of his being the author of the
bill passed last year and hia probable con
tinuance at the head of the House Com
merce Committee, is considered as the
measure which will serve as a t-.sis lor
action by the House. It differs from the
Hepburn bill passed last year, in making
the total appropriation 51SO.000.000 instead
of $140,000,000. Of the -total amount $10,

Wounded Insurgent ' : Leader s Tells
How Fighting Will Continue.
COLON, Dec. 6.— Colonel Barrera, the
wounded Insurgent leader, who surren
dered and wa» brought to Colon, believes
that the revolutionists , will confine fight
ing in the interior of ,the idepartment;-oC
Panama and will certainly not attack'
along the line of the Panama railroad be
fore nest March. Me declares that Gen
eral Porras, the revolutionary leader, has
about 500 men and a good supply of am
munition. Colonel Barrera considers that
practically all of the best insurgent offi
cers on the isthmus have surrendered.
No news has been received from Agua
dulce, where, it is believed, some of Gen
eral Alban's troops have attacked the in
surgent forces under General Victoriano
Lorenzo.
Captain Galloway of the British cruiser
Tribune, with General Alban, left last
evening for Bocas del Toro to settle the
trouble arising from 'the ill' treatment of
two members of the Tribune's crew by
the Colombian Government soldiers.
The Washington Club, composed of em
ployes of the Panama Railroad Company,
entertained on Tuesday evening the offi
cers and crews of all the warships In the

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-Secretary Long

down the Chilean coast to Talcahuano,
where the ship -is to be docked and over
hauled. He has also ordered Commander
McCree of the gunboat Machlas, at Colon;
to bring his vessel north, stopping at San
Juan, Porto Rico, on her way home, for
coal. The gunboats Marietta at Colon and
Concord at Panama will remain at their
respective stations for a time and then
they, too, will leave the Isthmus if affairs

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The Navy De

to-day, dated November 29,- stating , that
the gunboat J Vicksburg went into dock
for the winter at Nieuchwang, China; on
that date. This information relieved' the
naval , officials of quite a ; little anxiety
felt in regard to the welfare of this' ves
sel. It Is explained that the' cable facili
ties near Nieuchwang. are very poor and
accounted for the absence of information
here as to the .Vicksburg's ". whereabouts.

Military Governor Gives the
Reasons for Guerrilla
Warfare.
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.— The War De
partment has made public the first an
nual report of Major General Adna K.
Chaffee, military governor of the Philip
pine .-Islands. ..General -Chaffee sums up
the situation inVthe Philippines f rom= a
.military i point 'of view by., stating -.that
the provinces of'Batangas 'and .Laguna,
in Luzon, and the iislands of ; Samar. Man-;
.dora.^Cebu and Bohol, constitute the. area
ndw disturbed; by any, embodied force ot
Insurgents. says that tb v the physical
character of the country, : to the nature
of the warfare of the rebels, who are
amigo and foe in the same hour, to the
humanity of the troops, which is taken
advantage -of.. by the rebels, and to the
fear ;6f. assassination on the part of
friendiy- disposed if they give information
to the American forces is due the pro
- N lqugatioV of the guerrilla warfare.
• ", Commenting on the plan of gradually
replacing military with civil administra
tion Ueneral Chaitee says:
* "The withdrawal of interference with
'^ivil affairs does not contemplate wlth
draw^i;of the troops from their stations
to any considerable extent; on the con
trary, this should' not be done hastily and
when undertaken -should be gradual and
moro in the nature of concentration than
reduction of force or abandonment of any
considerable area of territory."
He therefore recommends mat there be
no further material reduction of troops
before January, 1W3. The governments
which are being organized— provincial and
municipal— General Chaffee says, are both
new and untried, and there Is but one
certain and reliable method of ascertain
ing the- progress of the Filipinos' in self
government,, namely, observation by. the
army*.*' On the subject of the military gov
ernment ;"of the J city of -Manila General
Chaffee 'saj's:. ;
Order Reigns in Manila.
"In the government of Manila for three
years if the military have done nothing
more it is everywhere apparent that an
excellent foundation has been laid and a
turbulent and hostile community brought
to observe the laws and individually be
orderly. This has been done without un
due harshness or severity of treatment of
the inhabitants."./- -..,,
—In anticipation of a partial concentra
tion of the troops in the Philippines next
year General Chaffee submits estimates
of cost for the construction of barracks.
He recommends that a permanent, post
be* constructed at once in the vicinity of
Manila 'for a garrison of two squadrons
of cavalry, two batteries of artillery and
two full regiments of infantry, together
with a hospital and storehouse, the whole
to be under the command 'of a brigadier
general. V He gives '$500,000 as a rough es
timate fit cost for this project and says
that $20O;0OO should be available immedi
ately in order to take full advantage of
the dry season for the construction of
permanent quarters at other points .which
may be determined upon. During 1 the
fiscal ydar ending June, .1903. he estimates
that $2,pOQ,000 .will be required: , ;
Slaughter in the Ninth.
General Chaffee devotes a good part of
his report to the terrible disaster which
befell Company, C, .Ninth Infantry, at
Balarigfga, Samarkand which,, he says,
was largely due to overconfidence in as
sumed pacific conditions and in a people
"who to a great extent as yet are strang
ers and unappreciatlve of our humane
policy j>t liberty of beliefs and actions."
*-A tabljfe is submitted, showing that since
June 10 last, the 'date of the last table
submitted .by General MacArthur, yr* to
September 15," 361 Pilipino officers and 3838
men surrendered to the American military
and twenty-six officers and 489. men were
captured. ■
In an appended report General J. P.
Sanger. inspector general of the Division
of the Philippines, in speaking of the dis
cipline of the troops in the aslnnds, notes
a commendable absence of excesses and
serious Infractions of the regulations, but
says that there is great room for im
provement in the matters of dress, ' de
meanor and show of respect in saluting
superior officers, the criticism applying to
officers as well as soldiers. ' -
Judge Advocate General Groesback says
that the suppression of brigandage in
the Philippines most probably will be one
of the trying problems of the future. If
the military arm was left free to deal
with the marauders, he says, there would
be no doubt of their final suppression, but
the Incoming of civil authority compli
cates the military situation.
Great attention is paid in appended re
ports to the subject of the prevalence of
venereal diseases in the army of the Phil
ippines and the vjgorous measures taken
to- segregate dissolute women and by rigid
physical inspection, guard against the
spread of such diseases.
With his own report General Chaffee
submits, those of the commanders of the
military departments in the Philippines
and of the heads of tlie several -staff- de-'
partments.. • •: v ■»*•?*■• ?-• '•-•'-' ■'•■ " ; ■ •• ■ :

Property Worth Million
Dollars.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Dec. 6.— Mrs. Cathe
rine O'Keefe>0f. this .city received to-day
a letter ■ from Joseph Michaels of Yap,
Caroline Islands, a'dvising her of the
probable loss at sea' of her husband, Cap
tain'David B. O'Keefe,.and the fact that
he had left" property - worth probably
91,000,000.'< Michaels has ■> applied to the
American Consul at Hongkong to protect
OKeefe's property. Mrs..O'Keefe has en
gaged a law tirm here to look out for her
interests. ..-■<•
David O'Keefe was known.in the Orien
tal trade as "King" O'Keefe of Yap,
which island he virtually owned. When
O'Keefe landed at Yap, thirty years ago,
the cannibal natives thought him a demi
god on account of his white skin, and
made him their king. He built up a
profitable trade to Hongkong and owned
two barks that traded between the Caro
lines and Chinese ports.
Last June he went with copra and
other native products to Hongkong, from
which point he sent his wife in this city
a check for 51500. After leaving Hong
kong, the vessel disappeared and Is sup
posed to have teen lost in a storm.
King O'Keefe was 56 years of age and a
native of this city.

Mr. Powell is to-day considered by
those best competent to judge as one of
the most skillful planners and writers of
advertising in .America. Some of his
achievements are notable.
Entering the field in 1891, he quickly
revolutionized bicycle advertising and set
a pace that was never equaled. Later he
astonished patent medicine men by dem-
onstrating- his ability to float a new arti-
cle and make it highly profitable the first
month.
Next came Mr. Powell's work in build-
ing up the advertising department of on©
of the largest woman's publications in
America, and in a year his methods added
nearly $50,000 worth of extra business, be-
