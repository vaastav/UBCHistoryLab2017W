basis of settlement will be fixed In Washington

the Southern people will never consent to impar

society to allow the blacks to vote. The Gov

negroes who could read and write and had pro

THE HEW TAX MM.
In our legislative report published yes
terday morning, it was stated that the
House of Jtepresenmtivea had adopted a
revenue bill, reported from the Committee
- on Ways and Means, in lieu of the bill
originating in the Senate. It -will "be
found in full in another column of this
morning's paper, and deserves the atten
tion of several important classes of the
community It is a measure whieh has
received the carefej consideration of &
committee composod of some of tho best
material in the House, and is entitled to
& candid hearing upon its merits. It
involves the most difficult subject in the
scopo of legislation tho providing of
revenue and the adjustment of taxes.
Perhaps no legislative body ever yet en
aoted & law of this oharaster which met
with universal approval Some members
of some ekweswill always construe seme
features as unequal and unjust It should
to remembered, however, that those who
are commissioned to frame laws are sworn
against partial legislation, and it is (o be
presumed they take in Tiew a wider
field than those who regard such laws
from an individual stand point "We
have not examined this measure criti
cally, but ore satisfied that it has been
preparedon just principles and after ma
ture deliberation. It was drafted by Mr.
Lellyett, the junior Representative from
this county, and received the unanimous
sanction of the Ways and Means Com.
mittee.
Upon its presentation in the House as
a substitute on its third reading, it was
thoroughly explained by Mr. Elliott, of
.Rutherford, the chairman of that commit
tee, and ably advocated. At the conclu
sion of his remarks, a motion was made
to postpone its consideration until Tues-
day-next Mr. Lellyett insisted earnestly
that the House should continue its dis
cussion until it was disposed of, and urged
that it was necessary that the revenue
question should be determined promptly.
The previous question was then called,
and the bill passed by a vote of 50 to 12.
lithe Senate should concur in the action
of the Home, it will become the law, and
go into operation on the first of January
ensuing.

odious principle which sanctioned
them, heywerej cjireful to exclude
it from tho Constitution, and never
intended ,that fair interpretation should
find it there. Not until within the
last five years in this country did any
man pretending to statesmanship think
to seek for it, and no man who had
even dared to speak was thought to wish
to use it The frightful thing that has
been throttled by the Supreme Court was
an outgrowth of the civil war an appli

the contest, prolonged the .struggle, and
now prevents the return of peace. It is
antagonistic to free institutions. If it
prevails they cannot stand. If we are to
have liberty it must be expunged from

the 6th instant:' iS
"The only theme of interest in Congress

Touching the snmedsubject, the.'fcorres-

says;
'The absence of any reference to the
question of impeachment in the caucus,
last night,-is the subject of general remark

arrival ia this city a few days before the open

bustle incident to that loccasion. OSleiabi, ex-
-ecutive, ministerial and legislative, both civil
and military, are the central figures at thlssea
son. I knew Washington at a time- when the
military feature was not so prominent, but alas!
the' golden days when the civil victories of peace
were more esteemed Jduxt these of war; have
passed. The "rude alnrums" of war do not ob
trude now as they did a year or two since, but
there is yet left about the city a military impress
which ono could well wish removed. The lead
ers in social circles are preparing forjhe season
also, and despite4, the- tempestuous Apolitical
weather whieh thointcr at the Capital is to
wiiness, the rounds of pleasure and gaycty will
temper It with amenity. Would, that I could
hope that the fair spirit of social -and genuine
friendly intercourse could exorcise the foul
demon of political and sectional rancor.
But sueh is not to beHhe- ease; I have not yet
been able to make sufficient obscrvctions to give
you positive information, but have seen enough
to .satisfy me that good men are- despondent ' T
have attended many sessions of Congress in
times sf great political excitement but have
witnessed nothing to Compare with the state of
'feeling exhibited by tho leaders of the Radical
party in Congress. Their hate for the President
aid for every conservative man. or- thing.lforth
or South, Is perfectly ferocious. It is difficult to
tell whether they most abominate a Northern
conservative, or wliat they call a Southern
'rebel." They are in a temper to believe noth
ing-good of the -Southern people. A miracle
could not convlnca them that the South Is not'
to-day as fiercely rebellious as when its legions
were thundering at the gates of the Capital. To
ono like myself able to bear witness td the sin
cerity and submission to defeat by our people
and ihelr perfectly pacific temper, sueh infatua
tion is Incredible. Iamamaxed that meo. pro
fessing patriotism and constituting themselves
the especial guardians of the country's Safety,
can be so willful and unreasonable. Rut so it is.
ana tne consequences will be seen m the legisla
tion of this winter.
The impeachment will riot be brought forward
as a party measure. It will be discussed in Con
gress, however, and find Individual supporters,
but the more sagacious among tho Radicals
know that the President has been "so clear in
his great office" that they fear to risk it. In
stead of a bold attempt to depose him, they pro
pose to deprive him of power by piocemeal. and
by railing accusations and formal Investigations
to utterly destroy his official Influence with the
mass of the Northern people. This game has
been already commenced, and you may expect
to hear that he has used the appointing power
corruptly; that he has abased the pardoning
power and nullified the confiscation laws m ttho
interest of rich rebels; that he has used favorit
ism in the new appointments in the reglararmy,
with fell designs upon the nation ; that he has
connived at Surratt's evasion of arrest with hor
rible hints th&t he had great reason for so doing

onerous and humiliating conditions from the
Southern people. Already the proposition has
been made to overturn their State governments
and place the whole area of ten States in terri

The Radicals will not withdraw the constitu
tlonal amendment and tender universal suffrage
and universal amnesty as a basis of reconstruc
tion. The more unscrupulous of them de not
hesitate to avow that this would produce imme
diate reparation, and that they are not prepared
for that if the whole political power of the
South in the Government is to follow as a result
They intend to make tho rejection of the amend
ment a eaiut Mix to exclude the Southern
States, at least until after the Presidential elec
tion of 18G3. They Intend that no cletftoralvoto
shall bo polled in that election, that endangers
the sacceaa of their candidate. If the South wero

Amid all this clamor and rage of 'faction
President Johnson, I can assure you, Is calm and
self-poised, and not in the least cast down. Th
message is regarded as an admirable psper In
itself, and most judicious under the circum
stances. His friends in Congress are few but
undismayed. They are perfectly satisfied with
hir course, and Intend to sustain iim as best
they can against the assaults which are pre
paring against him. They have not strength to
succor him as he deserves to be, and the veto
power which the Constitution gives him is
complete nullity, for nothing hecould say, no
matter .how just In Itself, could withstand the
.predetermined animosity of tho Radical leaders
towards him.

amidst "shouts of laughter," in this flip

(Extract from tho speech.)
To my Democratic friends"! would quote
a passage of Scripture (laughter) ; but of
course the Senators are so familiar with
Scripture (renewed laughter), and; this
crowu so verseu in ocripiuru luujjuigi;,
that I need not quote it here, and I there

you to the second and twelfth Thessaloni

Speaker Colfax and others "Quote it"
Senator Yatea Oh, don't press me,
please ; fori am afraid I shodld fall short
if I attempted it (Laughter.)
A Voice ''Give him a Bible, we want to
hear it"
Senator Yates Well, if you insist upon

Me. Bright, the British Liberal, is' a
great toast among the Radicals of this

misconceived him. Certainly, they can
no longer think well of a statesman who
at the head of a party which may have
revolutionary elements ia itj cquldstend
before a large audience of advocates of
franchise to tax pavers, and ureo.this
noble testimony to ihe' inviolability of

WAsniKOTON, Dec. 8. There are doubts
whether Kelly's House bill to create a De
partment of Internal Eevenue, which aims
to take the control of the revenue from the
Treasury, can become a law. It is at pre
sent in the hands of the Ways and Means
Committee. Even if reported upon favor
ably, andpassed by Congress, it is certain to
receive the Executive veto. It is the im
pression that it will be smothered by the
committee. t

New Yore. Dec. 8. The Herald West
ern Georria correspondent says, that since
the elections in the North, the people of
,that portion of the btate are malting up
their minds to submit to the- will of the
majority. Their conduct towards Union
men has chaneed decidedly for the better,
and they now cheerfully acquiesce in the
plans for educating the negroes. There
energies are now bent on retrieving their
rained fortunes, and they are now coope
rating heartily in the ert-ction of manufac
tories and railroads. The cotton and corn
crobs have been a failure', and the planters
universally complain of the laziness of the
negroes.
The Herald's Richmond correspondent
says, there are a number of members of the
Legislature who won't favor ratification of
thecpnstituuonalam'endraent. Iftheycould
be(peraua'ded,io show their hands, it would
bo seen that the Governor's influence in
that direction amotints to, nothing.
