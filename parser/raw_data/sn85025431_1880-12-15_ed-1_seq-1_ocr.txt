STATE OF THE COUNTRY.
Tine President's Annual Message*
4s Delivered to Congrew on mondny,
December 0.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Rep­
resentatives
congratulate von on the continued and in­
creasing prosperity of our country. By the
favor of Divine Providence we have been blessed,
during the past year, with health, with abund­
ant, harvests, with profitable employment for all
our people, and with contentment at home, and
with peace and friendship with cither nations.
The occurrence of the twenty-fourth election
of Chief Magistrate has afforded another op­
portunity to the people of the United States
to exhibit to the world a significant example
of the peaceful and safe transmission of the
power and authority of Government from the
public servants •whose terms of office are
about to expire, to their newly-chosen success­
ors. This example cannot fail to impress pro­
foundly thoughtful people of other countries
with the advantages which republican institu­
tions afford. The immediate, general and
cheerful acquiescence of ail good citizens in the
result of the election gives gratifying assurance
to our country and to its friends throughout
the world that a Government based on the free
consent of an intelligent and patriotic people
possesses elements of strength, stability and
permanency not found in any other fonu of
Government
Continued opposition to the full and free en­
joyment of the rights of citizenship, conferred
upon the colored people by the recent amend­
ments to the constitution, still prevails in sev­
eral of the late slave-holding States. It haB,
perhaps, not been manifested in the recent
election to any large extent in acts of violence
or intimidation. It has, however, by fraudu­
lent practices in connection with the ballots,
with the regulations as to the place aud manner
of voting, and with counting, returning, and
canvassing the votes cast, been successful in de­
feating the exercise of the light preservative of
all rights, tho right of suffrage, which the con­
stitution expressly confers upon our enfran­
chised citizens.
It is the desire of the good people of the
whole country that sectionalism as a factor in
our politics "should disappear. They prefer
that no sec: ion of the country should be united
in solid opposition to any other section. The
disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obe­
dience to the equal-rights amendments to the
constitution is all that now stands in the way
of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in
our political contests. As long as either of
these amendments iB flagrantly vio­
lated or disregarded, it is safe to assume
that the people who placed them in
the constitution, as embodying the le­
gitimate results of the war for the
Union, and who believe them to
be wise and necessary, will continue to act to­
gether, and to insist that they shall be obeyed.
The paramount question still is as to the en­
joyment of the right by every American citizen
who has the requisite qualification to freely cast
his vote and to have it honestly counted. With
this question rightly settled, the country will
be relieved of the contentions of the past by­
gones will indeed be bygones, and political and
party issues with respect to economy and effi­
ciency of administration, internal improve­
ments, the tariff, domestic taxation, educa­
tion, finance and other important subjects
will then receive their full share of atten­
tion but resistance to and nullification of
the results of the war will unite together in res­
olute purpose for their support all who main­
tain the authority of the Government and the
perpetuity of the Union, and who adequately
appreciate the value of the victory achieved.
This determination proceeds from no hostile
sentiment or feeling to any part of the people
of our country, or to any of their interests.
The inviolability of the amendments rests upon
the fundamental principles of our Government.
They are the solemn expression of the will of
the people of the United States.
The sentiment that the constitutional rights
of all our citizens must be maintained does not
grow weaker. It will continue to control the
Government of the countrv. Happily, the his­
tory of the late election shows that in many
farts
of the country where opposition to the
Ifteenth amendment has heretofore prevailed
it is diminishing, and is likely to cease al­
together, if firm and well-considered ac­
tion is taken by Congress. I trust the House
of Representatives and the Senate, which
have the right to judge of the elections, re­
turns and qualifications of their own members,
will see to it that every case of violation of the
letter or spirit of the Fifteenth amendment ia
thoroughly investigated, and that no Venefit
from such violation shall accrue to any person
or party. It will be the duty of the Executive,
with sufficient appropriations for the purpose,
to prosecute unsparingly all who have been en­
gaged in depriving citizens of the rights guar­
anteed them by the constitution.
It is not, however, to bo forgotten that the
best and surest guarantees of the primary
rights of citizenship is to be found in that ca­
pacity for self-protcction which can belong only
to a people whose right to universal suffrage is
supported by universal education. The means
at the command of the local and State authori­
ties are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to
furnish free instruction to all who need it.
This is especially true where, before emancipa­
tion, the education of the people was neglect­
ed or prevented, in the interest of slavery.
Firmly convinced that the subject of
popular education deserves the earnest
attention of the people of the whole
country, with a view to wise and
comprehensive action by the Government of
the United States, I respectfully recommend
that Congress, by suitable legislation and with
proper safe-guards,
SHIT
foment the local edu­
cational funds in the several States where the
crave duties and responsibilities of citizenship
nave been devolved on uneducated people, by
devoting to the purpose grants of the publio
lands, and, if necessary, by appropriations
from the treasury of the United States. What­
ever Government can fairly do to promote free
popular education ought to be done. Wherever
general education is found, peace, virtue and
social order prevail, and civil and religious
liberty are secure.
In my former annual messages, I have asked
the attention of Congress to the urgent neces­
sity of a reformation of tho civil service sys­
tem ef tho Government. My views concerning
the dangers of patronage, or appointments for
personal or partisan considerations, have been
strengthened by my observation and experi­
ence in the Executive office, and I believe these
dangers threaten the stability of the Govern­
ment. Abuses so serious in their nature can­
not be permanently tolerated. They tend to
become more alarming with the enlargement of
administrative service, as the growth of the
couniry in population increases the number of
officers and placemen employed.
The reasons are imperative for the adoption
of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint­
ments, promotions and removals, establishing
a uniform method, having exclusively in view,
in every instance, the attainment of the best
qualifications for the position in question.
Such a method alone is consistent with the
equal rights of all citizens, and the most eco­
nomical and efficient administration of the pub­
lic bnsiness.
Competitive examinations, in aid of impartial
appointments and promotions, have been con­
ducted for some years past in several of the
Executive Departments, and bv my direction
this system has been adopted the Onstom
Houses and Postoffices of the larger cities of
the country. In the city of New York over
two thousand positions in the civil service have
been subject, in their appointments and
tenure of plaice, to the operation of pub­
lished rules for this purpose, during the
past two years. The results of these practical
trials have been very satisfactory, and have
confirmed my opinion in favor of system
of selection. All are subjected to the same
tests, and the result is free from prejudice by
personal favor or partisan influence. It se­
cures for the position applied for the best
qualifications attainable among the competing
applicants. It is an effectual protection from
the pressure of importunity, which, under
any other course pursued, hugely exacts
the time and attention of appointing
officers, to their great detriment in
the dischuge of other official duties, prevent­
ing the abuse of the service for the mere fur­
therance of private or party purposes, and leav­
ing the employe of the Government, freed from
the obligations imposed by patronage, to de­
pend solely upon merit for retention and ad­
vancement, and with this constant incentive to
exertion and improvement.
These invaluable results have been aMmlwM
in a high degree in the offices where the rules
for appointment by competitive
have been applied.
Amcthod which has so approved itself by
experimental tests at points where such testa
may be fairly considered conclusive should be
csMoaed to all subordinate tfrf
.-X
I I
Government. I believe that a strong and grow­
ing public sentiment demands immediate meas­
ures for securing and enforcing the highest
possible efficient in the civil service, ana Its
protection from recognized abuse*, and that
the experience referred to has demonstrated
the feasibility of such measures.
The examinations in the Custom Houses and
Postoffices have been held under many embar­
rassments, and without provision for compen­
sation for the extra laboi: perforated by the of­
ficers trho hate conducted them, and whose
commendable interest in the improvement of
the public service has induced (hit devetibn oi
time and labor whithotit pecuniary reward. A
continuance of these labors gratuitously ought
not to be expected, and without an appropria­
tion by Congress for compensation it is not
practicable to extend the system of
examinations generally throughout, thfc
civil service. It Is also highly
important that all sdeh examinations
should be conducted upon a uniform system
and under general supervision. Section 1,753
of the Revised Statutes authorizes the Presi­
dent to prescribe the regulations for admission
to the civil service of the United States, and for
this purpose to employ suitable persons to con­
duct the requisite inquiries with reference to
"the fitness of eaoh candidate, in respect to
age, health, character, knowledge, and ability,
for the branch of service into which he seeks
to enter but the law is practically inoper­
ative for the want of the requisite appropria­
tion.
I therefore recommend an appropriation of
$25,000'per annum to meet the expenses of a
commission, to be appointed by the President
in acccordance with the terms of this section,
whose duty it shall be to devise a just, uniform
and efficient system of competitive examina­
tions, and to supervise the application of the
same throughout the entire civil service of the
Government. I am pursuaded that the facili­
ties which such a commission will afford
for testing the fitness of those who apply
for office will not only be as welcome
a relief to members of Congress as
it will be to the President and heads of depart­
ments, but that it will also greatly tend to re­
move the causes of embarrassment which now
inevitably ana constantly attend the conflicting
claims of patronage between the Legislative
and Executive departments. The most effect­
ual check upon the pernicious competition of
influence and official favoritism in the bostowal
of office will be the substitution of an open
competition o' merit between the applicants,
in which even- one can make his own record,
with the assurance that his success will depend
upon this alone.
I also recommend such legislation as, while
leaving every officer as free as any other citizen
to express his political opinions and to use his
means for their advancement, shall also enable
him to feel as safe as any private citizen
in refusing all demands upon ins eautry loi
political purposes. A law which should tliui
guarantee true liberty and justice to all who
are engaged in the public service, and likewise
contain stringent provisions agaiust the use of
official authority to coerce the political action of
private citizens or of official subordinates, id
greatly to be desired.
The most serious obstacle, however, to an
improvement of the civil service, and especial­
ly to a reform in the method of appointment
and removal, has been found to be the prac­
tice, under what is known as the spoils system,
by which the appointing power has been so
largely encroached upon by members of Con­
gress. The first step in the reform of the
civil service must bo a complete divorce
between Congress and the Executive in
the matter of appointments. The cor­
rupting doctrine that "to the victors belong
the spoils" is inseparable from Congres­
sional patronage as the established rule and
practice of parties in power. It comes to be
understood by applicants for office, and by
the people generally, that Representatives
and Senators are entitled to disburse the
patronage of their respective districts and
States. It is not necessary to recite at length
the evils resulting from* this invasion of the
Executive functions. The true pnnciples of
government on the subject of appointments to
office, as stated in the National Conventions of
the leading parties of the country, have again
and again been approved by the American peo­
ple, and have not been called in question in
any quarter. These authentio expressions of
public opinion upon this all-important subject
are the statement of principles that belong
to the constitutional structure of the Govern­
ment.
"Under the constitution the- President and
heads of departments are to make nominations
for office. The Senate is to advise and consent
to appointments, and the House of Represen­
tatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless offi­
cers. The best interest of the public service
demands that these distinctions be respected
that Senators and Representatives, who
may be judges and accusers, should
not dictate appointments to of
fiee." To this end the co-operation of the
Legislative Department of the Government is
required, alike by the necessities of the case
and by public opinion. Members of Congress
will not be relieved from the demands made
upon them with reference to appointments to
office until, by legislative enactment, the per­
nicious practice is condemned and forbidden
It is therefore recommended that an act be
passed defining the relations of members of
Congress with reference to appointments to of­
fice by the President, and I also recommend
that the provisions of section 1,767, and of the
sections following, of the Revised Statutes,
comprising the Tenure-of-Office act, of March
2, 1867, be repealed.
Believing that to reform the system and
methods of the civil service in our countro is
ono of the highest and most imperative duties
of statesmanship, and that it can be per­
manently done only by the co-operation of the
Legislative and Executive Departments of the
Government, I again commend the whole sub­
ject to your considerate attention.
It is the recognized dujjy and purpose of the
people of the United 'States to suppress
polygamy where it now- exists in ourTerri
ipi ics, and to prevent its extension. Faith­
ful and zealous efforts have been made by
the United States authorities in Utah to en­
force the laws against it. Experience has
ihown that the legislation upon this subject,
to be effective, requires extensive modifica­
tion and amendment The longer action
is delayed, the more difficult it will be to ac­
complish what is desired. Prompt and de
cided measures are necessary. The Mormon
sectarian organization which upholds polygamy
has the whole power of making and
executing the local legislation of ihe Territory.
By its control of the grand and petit juries, it
possesses large influence over tne administra­
tion of justice. Exercising, as the heads of
this sect do, the local political power of the
Territory, they are able to make effec­
tive their hostility to the law of Con­
gress on the subject of polygamy, and,
in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy
will not be abolished If the enforcement of the
law.
depends on those who practice and uphold
the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking
away the political power of the sect which en­
courages and sustains it. The power of Con­
gress to enact suitable laws-to protect the Ter­
ritories is ample. It is not a case of half-way
measures. The politioal power of the Mormon
sect is increasing it controls now one of our
wealthiest and most populous Territories.
It is extending steadily into other Terri­
tories. Wherever it goes it establishes po­
lygamy and sectarian political power. The
sanctity of marriage and the family relation are
the corner-stone of our American society and
ciyilization. Religious liberty and the separa­
tion of church and state are among the ele­
mentary ideas of free institutions. To re-es­
tablish the interests and principles which po­
lygamy and Mormonism have imperilled, and to
fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immi­
grants of all creeds that part of our domain
which has been, in a great degree, closed to
general immigration by intolerant and immoral
institutions, it is reoommended that the Gov­
ernment of the Territory of Utah be reorganized.
I recommend that Congress provide for the
government of Utah by a Governor and Judges
or Commissioners, appointed by the President
and confirmed by the Senate—a government
analogous to the provisional government estab­
lished for the territory northwest of the Ohio,
by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, It is
deemed best to continue the existing form of
local government, I recommend that the right
to vote, hold office, and sit on juries in the Terri
tory of Utah be confined to those who neither
practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough
measures are adopted, it is believed that within
a few years the evils whioh now a£9ict Utah will
be eradicated, and that this Territory will in
good time become one of the most prosper­
ous and attractive of the new States of the
Union.
Our relations with all foreign countries have
been those of undisturbed peace, and have
presented no occasion for concern as to their
continued maintenance.
My anticipation of an early reply from the
British Government to the demand of in­
demnity to our fishermen for. the injuries
suffered by thtt industry at Fortune bay, in
January, 1878, which I expressed in my last
annual Message, was disappointed. This
answer was received, only in- the latter part
of April in the present year, and, hen ro
ceivea, exhibited a failure of accord' betweei
the two Governments, as to the measure ol
the inshore-fishing privilege securred 'to oar
fishermen by the treaty of Washington, of
so serious a ohar^cter that I made it the
subjeofc of a conmmriwttyo to Congress, in
which I recommended the adoption of the
measures which seemed to me proper to be
taken by this Government in maintenance of
the rights accorded to our fishermen under the
treaty, and toward securing an indemnity foi
the injury these interests had suffered. A bi|
to carry out these recommendations was tinder
consideration by the House of Representatives
at the time of the adjournment of Congress in
June last.
Within a few weeks I have received a com­
munication -from her Majesty's Government,
renewing the consideration of the subject, both
of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune
bay, and df the interpretation ot the treaty in
winch the previous correspondence had shown
the two Governments to be at variance. Upon
both these topics the disposition toward a
friendly agreement is manifested by a recogni­
tion of our right to an indemnity for the trans­
action at Fortune bay, leaving the measure of
such indemnity to further conference, and by an
assent to the view of this Government, presented
in the previous correspondence, that tne regula­
tion of conflicting interests of the shore fishery
of the provincial seacoasts, and the vessel fish­
ery of our fishermen, should be made the sub­
ject of conference and concurrent arrangement
between the two Governments.
I sincerely hope that the basis may be found
for a speedy adjustment of the very serious di­
vergence of views in the interpretation of the
fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington,
which, as the correspondence between the two
Governments stood at the last session of Con­
gress, seemed to be irreconcilable.
In the important exhibition of arts and in­
dustries, which was held last year at Sydney,
New South Wales, as well as in that how in
progress at Melbourne, the United States have
been efficiently and honorably represented.
The exhibitors from this country at the former
place received a large number of awards in
some of the most considerable departments,
and the participation of the United States was
recognized by a special mark of distinction. In
the exhibition at Melbourne, the share taken by
our country is no less notable, and an equal de­
gree of success is confidently expected.
The state of peace anp 6 anquillity now en­
joyed by all tne nations tf the continent of
Europe has its favorable influenco upon our
diplomatic and commercial relations with them.
We have concluded and ratified a convention
with the French republic for the settlement of
claims of the citizens of either country against
the other. Under this convention a commis­
sion, presided over by a distinguished publicist,
appointed, in pursuance of the request of both
nations, by His Majesty, the Emperor
of Brazil, has been organized and has begun
its sessions in this city. A congress to consid­
er means for the protection of industrial prop­
erty has recently be^n in session in Paris, to
which I have appointed the Ministers of the
United States in France and in Belgium as del­
egates. The International Commission upon
Weights and Measures also continues its work
in Paris. I invite your attention to the neces­
sity of an appropriation to be made in time to
enable this Government to comply with its ob­
ligations under the Metrical Convention.
Our friendly relations with the Gorman em­
pire continue without interruption. At tho
recent International Exhibition of Fish and
Fisheries, at Berlin, the participation of the
United States, notwithstanding the haste with
which the commission was forced to make its
preparations, was extremely successful and
meritorious, winning for private exhibitors
numerous awards of a high class, and for the
country at large the principal prize of honor
offered by His Majesty, the Emperor.
The results of this great success can­
not but be advantageous to this important
and growing industry. There have been
some questions raised between the two Govern­
ments as to the proper effect and interpretation
ol our treaties of naturalization, out recent
dispatches from our Minister at Berlin show
that favorable progress is making toward an
understanding, accordance with the views of
this Government, which makes and admits no
distinction between the rights of a native and
naturalized citizen of the United States. In
practice, the complaints of molestation suffered
by naturalized citizens abroad have nev.gr been
fewer than at present.
There is nothing of importance to note in
our unbroken friendly relations with the Gov­
ernments of Austria-Hungary, Russia, Portu­
gal. Sweden and Norway, Switzerland, Turkey
and Greece.
During the last summer several vessels be­
longing to the merchant marine of this coun­
try, sailing in neutral Waters of the West In­
dies, were fired at, boarded, and searched by
an armed cruiser of the Spanish Government,
/be circumstances, as reported, involve
not only a private injury to the per­
sons concerned, but also seemed too little
observant of the friendly relations existing for
a century between this country and Spain.
The wrong was brought to the attention of the
Spanish Government in a serious protest and
remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing
investigation by the royal authorities, with a
view to such explanation or reparation as may
be called for by the facts.
The commission sitting in this city for the
adjudication of claims of our citizens against
the Government of Spain is, I hope, approach­
ing the termination of its labors.
The claims against the United States under
the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted
to Congress for its action at the late session,
and again invite your attention to the long­
standing question, with a view to the final dis­
position of the mrtter.
At the invitation of the Spanish Government,
a conference has recently been held at the city
of Madrid to consider the subject of protec­
tion by foreign powers of native moors in
the empire of Morocco. The Minister of
the United States, in Spam was directed
to take part in the deliberations of
this conference, the result of which is a conven­
tion signed on behalf of all the powers repre­
sented. The instrument will be laid before the
Senate for its consideration. The Government
of the United States has lost no opportunity to
urge upon that of the Emperor of Morocco the
necessity, in accordance with the humane and
enlightened spirit of the age, of putting an end
to the persecutions, which have been so preva­
lent in that country, of persons of a faith other
than the Moslem, and especially of the He­
brew residents of Morocco.
The Consular treaty concluded with Belgium
has not yet been officially promulgated, owing
to the alteration of. a word in the text by tho
Senate of the United States, which occasioned
a delay, during which the time allowed for rati­
fication expired. The Senate will be asked to
extend the period for ratification.
The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra­
dition with Denmark failed on account of the
objection of tho Danish Government to the
usual clause providing that each nation should
pay the expense of the arrest of the persons
whose extradition it asks.
The provision made by Congress, at its
last session, for the expense of the commission
which had been appointed to enter upon
negotiations with the Imperial Government
of China, on subjects of great interest to the
relations of the two countries, enabled the
Commissioners to proceed at once upon their
mission. The Imperial Government waB pre­
pared to give prompt and respectful atten­
tion to the matters brought under negotia­
tion, and the conferences proceeded with
such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of
November last, two treaties were signed at
Pekin, one relating to the introduction of Chi­
nese into this country, and one relating to com­
merce. Mr. Trescot, one of the Commissioners,
is now on his way home bringing the treaties,
and it is expected that they will be received in
season to he laid before the Senate early in
January.
Our Minister in-Japan has negotiated a con­
vention for the reciprocal relief of shipwrecked
seamen. I take occasion to urge once more
upon Congress, the propriety of making provis­
ion for the erection of suitable fire-proof build­
ings at the Japanese capital for the use of the
American jegaticn, and the Court House and
jail connected with it The Japanese Govern­
ment, with groat generosity and courtesy, has
offered for this purpose an eligible piece of
land.
In my last annual message I invited the at­
tention of Congress to the subject of the in­
demnity funds received some years ago from
China and Japan. 1 renew the recommenda­
tion then made, that whatever portions of these
funds are due to American citizens should be
promptly paid, and the residue returned to the
nations, respectively, to which they justly and
equitably belong.
The extradition treaty with the Mngflmri of
the Netherlands, which has been for some time
in course of negotiation, has, during the past
year, been concluded and duly ratified.
Relations of friendship and amity have been
established between the Government of the
United States and that of Roumania. We have
sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest,
and have received at this capital the special
Envoy who has been charged by his Roval
Highness Prince Charles to announce the inde­
pendent sovereignty of Roumania. We hope
for a speedy development of conmercial rela­
tions between the two countries.
In my last annual message I expressed the
hope that the prevalence'of quietude on the
border between this country and Mexico would
soon become so secured as to justify the modi­
fication of the orders, then in force, to our
military commanders, in regard to cross­
ing the frontier, without encouraging
such disturbances as would endanger the
peace of the two countries. Events moved
in accordance with these expectations, and
^he qrders were accordingly withdraw^ to
the entire satisfaction of our citizens and the
Mexican Government. Subsequently the peace
of the border was again disturbed by a savage
foray, under the command of the Chief Victorio,
but, by the combined and harmonious action of
the military forces of both countries, his band
has been broken up and substantially de­
stroyed.
There is reason to believe that the obstacles
which have so long prevented rapid and con­
venient commnnication between the United
States and Mexico by railways are on the point
of disappearing, and that several important
enterprises of this character wiil soon be set on
foot which cannot fail to contribute largely to
the prosperity of both countries.
New Envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bo­
livia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have recently
arrived at this capital, whose distinction and
enlightenment afford the best guarantee of the
continuance of friendly relations between our­
selves and these sister republics.
The relations between this Government and
that of the United States of Colombia have en­
gaged public attention during the past year,
mainly by reason of the project of an inter
oceanic canal across tho Isthmus of Panama,
to be built by private capital under a con­
cession from the Colombian Government for
that purpose. The treaty obligations sub­
sisting between the United States and Col­
ombia, by which we guarantee the neutral­
ity of the transit aild the sovereignty
and property of Colombia in the isthmus,
make it necessary that the conditions under
which so stupendous a change in the region
embraced in this guarantee should be effected—
transforming, as it would, this Isthmus, from a
barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Into a gateway and thoroughfare between
them, for the navies and merchant ships of the
world—should receive the approval of this
Government, as being compatible wife
the discharge of these obligations on
our part, and consistent with our
interests as the principal com­
mercial power of the Western
hemisphere. The views which I expressed in
a special message to Cotgress in March last, in
relation to this project, I deem it my duty
again to press upon your attention. Subse­
quent consideration has but confirmed the
opinion that it is the right and duty of the
United States to assert and maintain such
supervision and authority over any inter
oceanic canal across the istnmus that connects
North and South America aB will protect our
national interest"
The war'between the republic of Chili on the
one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and
PoIIvia on the other, still continues. This Gov­
ernment has not felt called r^*on to interfere in
contest that is within tb^ belligerent rights of
he parties as independent states. We have,
however, always held ourselves in readiness to
lid in accommodating their difference, and have
bt different times ieminded both belligerents of
»ur willingness to render such service.
Our good offices in this direction were re­
cently accepted by all the belligerents, and it
was hoped they would prove efficacious but
regret to announoe that the measures which
the Ministers of the United States at Santiago
and Lima were authorized to take, with the
view to bring about a peace, were not success­
ful. In the course of the war some qrestions
have arisen affecting neutral rights in all of
these the Ministers of the United States have,
under their instructions, acted with promptness
and energy in protection of American inteiest
The relations of the United States with the
empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial,
and their commercial intercourse steadily in­
creases, to their mutual advantage.
The internal disorders with which the Argen­
tine Republic has for some time past been
afflicted, and which have more or less influ­
enced its external trade, are understood to have
been brought to a close. This happy result
may be expected to redound to tne benefit
of the foreign commerce of that republic as
well as to the development of its vast interior
resources.
In Samoa, the Government of King Mali
etoa, under the support and recognition of
the Consular representatives of the United
States, Great Britain ancL Germany, seems
to have given peace and tranquillity to the
islands. While it does not appear desirable
to adept as a whole the sche&e df tripartite
local government, which has been proposed,
the common interests of the three great
treaty powers require harmony in their rela­
tions to the native frame of government, and
this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic
agreement between them. It would be well if
the Consular jurisdiction of our representative
at Apia were increased in extent and import­
ance so as to guard American interests in the
surrounding and outlying islands of Oceanica.
The obelisk, generously presented by the
Khedive of Egypt to the city of New York, has
arrived safely this country, and will soon be
erected in that metropolis. A corbmission for
the liquidation of the Egyptian debt
has lately conoluded its work, and this
Government at the earnest solicitation of
the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions
adopted it, which will be laid before Con­
gress for its information. A commission for
the revision of the judicial code of the reform
tribunal of Egypt is now in session at Cairo.
Mr. Farman, Consul General, and J. M. Batch
elder, Esq., have been appointed as Commis­
sioners to participate in this work. The organ­
ization of the reform tribunals will probably be
continued for another period of five years.
In pursuance of the act passed at the last
session of Congress, invitations have been ex­
tended to foreign maritime states to join in a
sanitary conference in Washington, beginning
the 1st of January. The acceptance of this
invitation by many prominent powers gives
promise of success in this important measure,
designed to establish a system of international
notification by which the spread of infectious
or epidemic diseases may be more effectively
checked or prevented. The attention of Con­
gress is invited to the necessary appropriations
for carrying into effect the provisions of the act
The efforts of the Department of State to
enlarge the trade and commerce of the United
States, through the active agency of Consular
officers and through the dissemination of in­
formation obtained from them, have been un
relaxed. The interest in these efforts, as de­
veloped in our commercial communities, and
the value of the information secured by this
means to the trade and manufactures of the
country, were recognized by Congress at
its last session, and provision was
made for the more frequent publica­
tion of Consular and other reports
by tho D"i'i vtment of State. The first issue of
this publication has now been prepared, and
subsequent issues may regularly be expected.
The importance and interest attached to the re­
ports of -Consular officers are witnessed by the
general demand for them by all classes of mer
chants and manufacturers engaged in our for­
eign trade. It is believed that the system of
such publications is deserving of the approval
of Congress, and that the nacessary appropria­
tions-for its continuance and enlargement will
commend itself to your consideration.
Tho prosperous energies of our doigestio In­
dustries, and their immence production of the
subjects of foreign commerce, invite, and even
require, an active development of the wishea
and interests of our people in that direction.
Especially important is it that our commercial
relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of
South America, with the West Indies and
the Gulf of Mexico should be direct and not
through the circuit of European systems,
and should be carried on in our own bottoms.
Tho full appreciation of the opportunities
which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to
commerce with Japan, China and the East Indies,
with Australia and the island groups which lie
along tho routes of navigation, should inspire
equal efforts to appropriate to our own ship-
Sno
ing, and to administer by our own capital, a
proportion of this trade. Whatever modifi­
cations of our regulations of trade and .navigsr
tion may be necessary or useful to meet
and direct these impulses to the enlarge­
ment of our exohanges and of our ear­
ning trade, I am sore the wisdom of
Congress will be ready to supply. One initial
measure, however, seems to be so clearly use­
ful and efficient that I venture to press it upon
yonr earnest attention. It seems to be very
evident that the provision of regular steam
postal communication, by aid from Govern­
ment has been tne forerunner of the commer­
cial predominan *e of Great Britain on all these
coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade
is now the desire and intent of our people. It
is also manifest that the efforts of other Eu­
ropean nations to contend with Great Britain
for a share of this commerce have
been successful in proportion with their
adoption of regular steam-postal commnnica­
tion with the markets whose trade they sought
Mexico and the states of South America are
anxious to receive such postal communications
with this country, and to aid in their develop­
ment Similar cooperation may be looked
for, in due time, from the Eastern*nations
and from Australia. It is difficult to seie how
the lead in this movement can be expected
from, private interests. In re-peet of foreign
commerce, quite as muoh as in internal trade,
postal communication seems necessarily a mat­
ter of common and public administraaon, and
thus pertaining to government I respectfully
recommend to your prompt attention such just
and .efficient measures as may conduce to the
development of our foreign commercial ex­
changes and the building up of oar carrying
trade.
In this connection I desire also to suggest the
very service which might be «xpect«d to

enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the
Pacific ooean were a transmarine cable laid
from San Francisco to the Sandwich islands,
and thence to Japan at the north and Austra­
lia at the south. The great influence of such
means of communication on these routes
of navigation, in developing and
securing the due share of our Pa­
cific coast in the commerce of the world needs
no illustration or enforcement. It may be that
such an enterprise, useful and in the end
profitable as it would prove to private invest­
ment may need to be accelerated by prudent
legislation by Congress in its aid, and 1 submit
the matter to your careful consideration.
An additional, and not unimportant although
secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging
the navy may be found in the unquestionable
service to the expansion to our commerce,
which
would be rendered by the frequent circulation
of naval ships in the seas and ports of all qu r
ters of the globe. Ships of the proper
construction and equipment, to be of
the greatest efficiency in case of mari­
time war, might be made cons ant
and active agents time of peace in the ad­
vancement and protection of our foreign trade,
and in the nurture and discipline of young sea­
men, who would, naturally, in some numbers,
mix with and improve the crews of our mer­
chant-ships. Our merchants at home and
abroad recognize the value to foreign com­
merce of an active movement of our naval ves­
sels, and tho intelligence and patriotic zeal of
our naval officers in promoting every interest
of their countrymen is a just subject of nation­
al pride.
The condition of the financial affairs of the
Government, as shown by the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory.
It is believed that the present financial situa­
tion of the United States, whether considered
with respect to trade, currency, credit, growing
wealth, or the extent and variety of our re­
sources, is more favorable than that of
any other country of our time, and has
never been sui passed by that of any
country at any period of its history. All our
industries are thriving the rate of interest is
low new railroads are being constructed: a
vast immigration is increasing our popula­
tion, capital, and labor new enterprises in
great number are in progress and our com­
merce with other countries is improving.

for the year.
The aggregate of the revenues from ali
sources during the fiscal year ended June 30,
1880, was 9333,526.610.98, an increase over the
oreoeding year of $59,699,426.52. The receipts
thus far, of the current year, together with the
estimated receipts for the remainder of the
year, amount to $350,000,000, which will be
sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures
of the year, and leave a surplus of $90,000,000.
It is fortunate that this large surplus revenue
occurs at a period when it may be direetlv ap­
plied to the payment of the public debt soon to
t»e redeemable. No public duty has been more
constantly cherished in the United States than
the policy of paying the nation's debt as rap­
idly as possible.
The continuance of specie payments has not
been interrupted or endangered since the date
of resumption. It has contributed greatly to
the revival of business and to our remarkable
prosperity. The fears that preceded and ac­
companied resumption have proved ground­
less. No considerable amount of United States
notes have been presented for redemption,
while very large sums of gold bullion, both
domestic and imported, are taken to the mints
and exchanged for coin or notes. The in­
crease of coin and bullion in the United States
since Jan. 1,1879, is estimated at $227,399 428.
There are still in existence, uncanceiied.
$346,681,016 of United States legal-tender
notes. These notes were authorized as a war
measure, made necessary by the exigencies
of the conflict in which the United States was
then engaged. The preservation of the
nation's existence required, in the judgment
of Congress, an issue of legal-tender paper
money. That it served well the purpose for
which it was created is not questioned, but
the employment of the notes as papt money
indefinitely, after the accomplishment of tho
object for which they were provided, was not
contemplated by the framers of the law
under which they were issued. These notes
long since became like any other pecuniary ob­
ligation of the Government—a debt to be paid,
and, when paid, to be cancelled as mere evi­
dence of an indebtedness no longer existing.
I, therefore, repeat what was said in the annual
Message of last year, that the retirement from
circulation of United States notes, with the
capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is
a step to be taken in our progress toward a
safe and stable currency, which should be
accepted as the policy and duty of the Gov­
ernment and the interest and security of the
people.
At 'the time of the passage of the act now in
force requiring the coinage of silver dollars,
fivwg their value and giving them legal-tender
character, it was believed by many of the sup­
porters of the measure that the silver dollar,
whioh it authorized, would speedily become,
under the operations of the law, of equivalent
value to the gold dollar. There were other
supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted
as to the probability of this result nevertheless
were willing to give the proposed experiment a
fair trial, with a view to stop the coinage, if
experience should Drove that the silver dollar
authorized by the till continued to be of
less commercial value than the standard gold
dollar.
The coinage of silver dollars, under the act
referred to, began in March, 1878, and has
been continued as required by the act. The
average rate per month to the present time has
been $2,276,492. The total amount coined
prior to the 1st of November last was $72,847,
750. Of this amount $47,084,450 remain in
the treasury, and only $25,967,291 are in the
of tine people. A constant effort has
been made to keep this currency in circu­
lation, and considerable expense has been
Necessarily incurred for this purpose, but
return to the treasury is prompt and
Itre. Contrary to the confident anticipation
the friends of the measure at the time of
adoption, the value of tho silver dollar,
containing 412% grains of silver, has not in­
creased. During the year prior to the passage
of the bill authorizing its coinage, the market
value of the silver wmch it contained was from
90 to 92 cents, as compared with the standard
gold dollar. During the last year the- average
market value of the silver dollar has bten 88%
cents.
The necessity for additional provision, to aid
in the transaction of the business of the Fed
Mai courts, becomes each year more apparent.
The dockets of the Supreme Court and of the
Circuit Courts, in the greater number of the
are incumbered with the constant ac­
cession of cases. In the former court, and in
many instances in the Circuit Courts, years in­
tervene before it is practicable to bring cases to
hearing.
