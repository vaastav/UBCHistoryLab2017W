VIRTUAL STATE0F WAR.
Holland and Venezuela Nearing
Clashing Point.
UNCLE SAM IS WATCHFUL
Dutch Battleship Arrives In Harbor of
Willemsted Having In Tow the Coast
Guard Vessel Captured, With The
Netherlands Flag Flying.
Washington, Dec. 15. The existence
of what amounts practically to a atate
of war between Holland and Vene
tuela, the absence for the first time In
many years Id an acute crisis of this
kind of American warships from their
proper sphere influence, and the pro
fession by the state department offi
cials of their Ignorance of (he Inten
tions of Holland, constitute a most
serious and interesting international
situation. So long as the Dutch ships
act strictly within the lines of the Mon
roe doctrine as construed in the an
nual message to congress of President
Roosevelt last year, so long as no at
tempt hi made to Bel?.e Venezuelan
territory for permanent occupation; so
long as Dutch warship captains con
fine their activities to the seizure of
Venezuelan ships and blockade ports
and thus attempt to redress the af
front to Holland's honor, there will
probably be no Interference on the
part of the I'nited States government.
This telegram was received from
Wlllemstad: 'The Dutch battleship
Jacob von Heemskerk arrived in the
harbor towing as a price the Venezue
lan cout- Hardship. "23 de Mayo."
f the capture had already been
elved here and a great throng of
people lined the quays to witness the
entrance of the Dutch battleship con
ducting her capture within the harbor.
The flag of The Netherlands had been
Hoisted to the peak of the captured
Venezuelan coast gunrdship anil astern
the Dutch flag tloated the Venezuelan
colors. Altlmugh the enexuelnn flag
Is still shown, it Is In minor contrast

strength are Insignificant. She Is of
