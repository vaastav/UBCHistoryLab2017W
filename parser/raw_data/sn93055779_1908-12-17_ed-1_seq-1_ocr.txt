Dr. Jacob Mould Schiirinan, presi

The great majority of ' problems
which today Interest American voters
are economic problems. It is economic
problems which are transforming, re
casting, and recreating our political
parlies. Ami herein our history Is
but following the course of Kuronean
history. "If we look over Ku rope,"
says Mrsllryce In his American Com

grounds on which part leg have been
built, and contests waged since tht
beglnlng of free governments have

hostility of rich and poor, or of cap)

I laves and tlie desires of the Havo
iiols, we perceive the tnftst fretpiont
ground, though It is often disguised.
In the I'lilted Stales the situation
i. Inlensllled by the existence of
gredt. and increasing Ineipialltleij of
economic conditions. It is this phe

Wliile I sympathize witli the social

of our unpropertled classes, I have no

leclared that tile president's words
should he resented by the senate ai

Gross and Wanton Words.
During the discussion Hatley ob
jected to the resolution because it did
not direct tlie committee to Impilm
Into the "very gross and wanton '
words of thi' president's message. "Si
far as ! tun concerned," he said, "no
action should be taken on that reso
lution until that point Is covered.
Kit her congress is the most infamous
body that ever assembled In any
country of the world or It will take
some notice of this most wanton and
gross-Insult over given any body In
the world."
A M rich insisted that the resolution
provided for Just what Halley advo
cated, but the Texan retorted that If
that was Included In the resolution, 't
was iu mild terms, and declared him
self as lu favor of "talking plainly to
people who talk plainly to us, and
that if the president Is tml justified in
making th" statements he did the
message should be sent back to him."
Strong Enough, Says Hale.

was sufficiently strongly wordd t:i
