WASHINGTON, December 11. Pre-
sldent Roosevelt, in conference yester-
day with members of the Deep Water-
ways Conimiite'e. threatened to bring
acUons for criminal Hbel against some
critics of the committee. j
"Some Americans have been guilty
of Infamous falsehoods," he said, "ln

CONGRESS RESENTS SARCAS.M.
WASHINGTON December ll The
House and Senate have expressed re-j
sentment against that portion of the
President's Message relating to the
Secret Service Bill as amended last ses
sion by Congress.
That portion of the message dealing
witn me secret service, m pan, was;
Last year "an amendment was Incor
porated ln the measure providing for
the Secret Service, which provided
that there should be no detail from
the Secret Service and no transfer
therefrom. It Is not too much to say
that this amendment has been of bene
fit only, and could be of benefit only,
to the criminal classes. If deliberately
Introduced for the purpose of dimin
ishing the effectiveness of war against
crime, it could not have been better
devised to this end. In its
present form the restriction operates
only to the advantage of the criminal,
of the wrongdoer. The chief argu
ment In favor of the provision was
that the Congressmen did not them
Eelves wish to be investigated ,by Se
cret Service men. Very little of such
Investigation has been partly respon
sible for tho Indictment and convic
tion of a Senator and a Congressman
for land frauds in Oregon. I do not
believe that it is in the public Interest
to protect criminals ln any branch of
tho public service, and exactly as wo
have again and again during the past
seven years prosecuted and convicted
such criminals who were ln the exe
cutlve branch of the government, so,
in my belief, wo should be given ample
means to prosecute them if found 1n
the legislative branch. But 1f this Is
not considered desirable a special ex
ception could be made in the law pro
hibiting the use of the Secret Service
force in investigating members of the
Congress. It would be far better to do
this than to do what actually was done,
and strive to prevent, or at least to
hamper, effective action against crlm
lnals by the executive branch of tho
government."
RUEF'S SENTENCE TOMORROW.
SAN FRANCISCO, December 11.
Abo Ruef, who was declared guilty of

o'clock Wednesday afternoon until 4:10

were taken before an agreement of
guilty was reached.

OF
Considered either as one of tho most
important of America's Industrial nnd
agricultural interests, or as a necessity
Jot modern existence, the question of
tne dutJ' 011 8lBar which has been
raiseu in mo tariir neanngs at wasn-
jlngtbn nnd in tho propaganda lnstltu-
led by some of tho Independent refln-
ers against tho American Sugar Refln-
lug Company and Its allies, Is one of
vital interest to the whole American
people. It is also ono of the most In-
tricate, for not only are the interests
affected by the duties on raw nnd re-
fined sugars directly antagonistic to
one another but the International ob-
ligations of tho country are closely
Involved. To such an extent are these
complications developed thnt tho whole
question Is inextricably involved In
politics, the expression "the Senators
from Havemeyer" being a sinister
souvenir of the struggles over the
making of the Wilson tariff act In
1893.
What sugar means to the American
homo is sufficiently Indicated by the
fact that "the per capita consumption
at the present time Is no less than 77.4
pounds, tho aggregate consumption
last year having been something like
six billion pounds. The country pro-
duces less tnan nalt ot tnls enormous
aggregate-about 42 per cent., to be
exact uie uomesiiu suppiy ueme
made up ot the product of upward
of 265,000 tons of cane sugar grown
.in the southern United States; 375,000
tons of beet sugar, grown chiefly In
Colorado, Michigan aiyl other Western
Rtnts. 418 nno tons brollEht ln from
tlntirnll nrtA 0 1 ') fiflf rna f.nm Vit- n
Rico. Cuba supplies an amount about
equal to the present domestic product,
and the remaining 1C per cent, comes
from the rest of the world. Inclden-
20 per cent, lower than the'Dlngley
rate, and the total customs revenue
from sugar last year amounted to
about $00,000,000.
Sugar considered merely as a source
of revenue ls an important factor in
the national finance. If the tariffs on
raw and refined shall be reduced the
problem of finding other sources of
Income will have to be met, but this
is only the beginning of the trouble.
The domestic cane sugar lnterests'aro
forever on the alert lest tho present
protection which they enjoy should be
relaxed In favor of tho Cuban grower,
more favorably situated as to climate
and able to produce cane sugar at a
lower cost than the Louslana planter.
They already have to meet the corn-

PROBLEM
petition of the Porto Rico growerw, but
economic conditions and the cost of
transit practically equalize matters In
this respect. Then strenuous efforts
have been made to dovelop the beet
sugar industry in tno west, it uas
grown enormously In tho last few
years, has proved to be a keen com
petltor for tho Hawaiian cane sugar,
but has not 'increased at anything like
the samo proportion as tho consump-
tlon. Cuba has a very special claim
on the consideration of the United
States, and the menace of revolution
and consequent compulsory anncxa-
tlon, with free entry of Cuban sugar
into the United States, Is the dread of
the American growers, as well as the
chief argument of those who Insist up-
on the maintenance of the present dlt-
ferentlal.
AU these 5nterests nr& directly an-
tae0ni8tlCi but ft n6w complication Is
introduced. by tho supposed close alii-
nnce between the Sugar Trust and tho,
beet sugar factories. The consumer
has long had a shrewd suspicion that
whatever may be the legitimate claims
0f the cane and beet sugar growers,
the American Sugar Refining Company
js the chief beneficiary of tho existing
tariff duties on both raw and refined.
iphls suspicion Is now stregthened by
the Independent refiners,' who are
favoring a reduction ot uie uuiy oi
i,c85 cents per pound on raw sugar on
the ground that recent price develop
ments show that the trust and not the
growers are getting the benefit of the
protective margin.
Although the revenue aspect ot the
1.ues n ls a vltally mn ,on?' "
should bo remembered that a reduction
In the duty would not only bring tho
wholesald price Into something like
reasonable relation to the cost of pro
duc"n- b"1 ? 0 ?.
profit for the retailer, and Immensely
stimulate the various manufactures
into which sugar enters. Perhaps tho
consumer would not get much of tho
benefit, but ho would be Indirectly a
gainer through tho stimulation of gen
eral Industry and tho opening of the
way to something like competition in
a product so essential to his dally
life. Philadelphia Ledger.
