The cure for man, fur woman, or

JDoan's Kidney Pills cure sick
kidneys—
Cure all the varied forms of kidney
suffering.
Worthington testimony guarantees
every box.
John Dunn, of Miller St., Wor­
thington, Minn., says: "I had
symptoms of kidney complaint,
mostly a dull aching pain in my
back and worn out languid feeling.
Being satisfied-that it came from
the kidneys and happening to learn
of Doans Kidney Pills I got a box
at F. M. Hickman's drugs store,
and found quick relief. That was
in the fall of 1902, and I made a
statement for publication telling
the above facta. Now, Nov. 18th
1905, 1 can not only confirm the
above but add that the cure was
permanent."

When T. M. Roberts, the supply
man at Minneapolis, failed some
years ago, people were astonished
to learn that he owed manufac­
turers large amounts for goods.
Roberts always sold for cash and it
was supposed that he bought his
"goods for cash. Now comes the
Commercial Bulletin with a state­
ment that Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
of Chicago owe something over
eleven millions of dollars to trades­
men, customers, employees and in
open accounts. Tne firm has beeu
trying to sell $9,000,000 of preferred
stock for some months and has not
met with very good success. The
•firm has been offering to take de­
posits from customers all over the
country and pay interest on same
and has probably secured a large
amount of money, as the Bulletin
shows they owe customers and em­
ployees $2,934,673.47. It seems
like a risky proposition for farmers
to loan moneys to aconcern hundreds
of miles away, and about which
they know so little, but it seems
some do it.—Todd County Argus.
TO REBUILD BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
Doubledeck Arrangement Proposed to
Allow Greater Traffic.
New York, Nov. 27.—.The daily
crush on the Brooklyn bridge is re­
ceiving the earnest attention of Mayor
McClellan. At a conference of officials
important plans for temporary and
permanent relief were discussed.
Longer trains and increased headway,
It is expected, will bring temporary
relief.
Flans for permanent relief include
an almost entire rebuilding of the
bridge, poubledecking will probably
be resorted to in order to make room
for additional lines of railroad tracks.

CONGRESS AT WORK
LAST 8ES8ION OF THE PRESENT
BODY OPENS IN PRESENCE
OF MANY VISITORS.
President Send* Long List of Ap­
pointments to the Senate and Sev­
eral Resolutions of Inquiry Are In­
troduced Regarding the Discharge of
Colored Soldiers of the Twenty-
fifth Infantry.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The Fifty
ninth congress began its last session
at noon. It took the senate fifteen
minutes to arrange its preliminaries
and the house an hour. The senate
received from President -Roosevelt a
long list of appointments for its con­
firmation, and in an executive session
of nineteen minutes decided that as
the nominations had been received be­
fore the body had bean organised for
mally to make no confirmations until
the president's annual message had
been received and the session fairly
started.
Senators Penrose of Pennsylvania
and Foraker of Ohio came forward
with resolutions of inquiry regarding
the discharge of the negro troops of
the Twenty-fifth infantry. One was
addressed to the president and the oth­
er to the secretary of war. After the
ripple of surprise had passed and Vice
President Fairbanks had suggested
that it was unusual to transact any
business until the president's message
had been received, the resolutions
"went over" by unanimous consent.
Senator Dupont of Delaware took the
oath of office.
The opening of the two houses was
witnessed by an animated throng,
.which filled the galleries to their ca­
pacity. Hundreds went away disap­
pointed in hot gaining admission to
witness the session of either senate or
house.
Speaker Cannon appointed Repre­
sentative James R. Mann of Illinois as
a member of the board of regents of
the Smithsonian Institute, vice Robert
R. Hitt of Illinois, deceased.
After the appointment of the usual
committee to wait upon the president
and inform him that the house was
organized and ready to receive any
communication he might desire to
make of interest to the public service,
the house adjourned out of respect to
the memory of the deceased members.
No bills were introduced in the sen­
ate. In the house there was 38 public
measures and 350 of a private charac­
ter.
PLEASES THE DEMOCRATS.
President's Views on Inheritance and
Income Taxes.
Washington, Dec. 4.—The presi­
dent's message was read in both
houses of congress today and was
given close attention, notwithstanding
the long time occupied in its. reading.
Democrats declare themselves partic­
ularly well pleased with his recom­
mendation for inheritance and Income
taxeB
and assert that the president
has "stolen another plank of the Dem­
ocratic platform." Serious considera­
tion was given to that portion of the
message relating to the exclusion of
Japanese from the public schools of
San Francisco attended by white chil­
dren.

LIA»ILITI|ES OF $700,OWL
TH*ee McDonough County (111.) Bank*
Close Their Doors. "v
Peoria 111., Dec. 1.—Three banking
Institutions in McDonough county,
conducted by C. V. Chandler of Ma­
comb, have been closed. The banks
are:
'"V
The Bank of Macomb, conducted by
C. V. Chandler & Co., having deposits
of 1450,000 and capitalised at $50,000
the Chandler & Imes bank at Colches­
ter, capitalized at $25,000, having de­
posits of $200,000, and the Chandler &
Smith bank of Bardolph, Capitalised
at $25,000, with $60,000 in deposits.
The money has been invested In
McDonough county real estate. The
immediate cause of the suspension Is
given as a lack of ready cash. The
Macomb bank was responsible for the
payment of the bonds of the Macomb
and Western Illinois Electric railway
and when the bondholders demanded
their money they badly embarrassed
the -three banks.
The liabilities are upwards of $700,
000.
ELEVEN PULAJANES KILLED.
Chief of Band Escapes, but His Cap­
ture Is Certain.
Manila, Dec. 1.—A force of con­
stabulary under command of Major
Murphy surprised the camp of Pablo,
chief of the Pulajanes on the island cf

the Pulajanes were killed, the chief's
son and nine of the band were wound­
ed. Chief Pablo himself escaped, but
his wife and daughter were captured.
Slothing, arms and papers found were
destroyed, together with the camp.
The capture of Chief Pablo is consid­
ered the question of only a few days.
There is now only one other chief at
large and plans have been arranged
to capture or kill him. Governor Curry
of Samar wires that the breaking up
of Chief Pablo's band signalizes the
death knell of Pulajanism in the isl­
and.

St- Petersburg, Dec. 3.—Princes*
Lvoff and OrbelianC the representa­
tives of the Moscow zemstvo famine
relief organisation, who have just re­
turned from the stricken districts,:
haye furnished the Associated Press
with the following facts regarding the.,
conditions in the famine provinces:
The crops in the seven provinces'
of Samara, Saratov, Sembirsk, Kazan,
Penza, Tambov and Ufa were practi­
cally total failures. In twenty prov­
inces the harvests* were very poor.
About 20,000,000 people will need as­
sistance for from four to ten months
to stave off starvation until the new
ferops are available. Though affecting
18,000,000 persons the destitution is
far less intense than it was in 1891.
In some regions the inhabitants have
been suffering from starvation for ten
years, passible crops having been gath­
ered in only two of the ten years.
Prince Lvoff believes the government
estimate of $50,000,000 for famine re­
lief is inadequate. The Moscow zemst­
vo relief organization calculates that
$75,000,000 and possibly more will be
necessary.
Though the conditions in the famine
regions are now distressing far worse
may be
1
exP**6**
in
January. The
zemstvo organization funds will then
be exhausted and the relief commit­
tees will be compelled to cease their
efforts for the starving peasants. Prince
Lvoff complained that the local offi­
cials, for political reasons, are inter­
fering with the establishment of soup
kitchens and the rendering of medical
assistance.
He reported cases where petty func­
tionaries prohibited assistance being
given to famine sufferers. Epidemics
of hunger, typhus and scurvy, which
usually began in February, already
have appeared in three provinces—
Tulla, Kazan and Samara.
