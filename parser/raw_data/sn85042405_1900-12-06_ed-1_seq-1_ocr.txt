When tile sixth congress assembled
in November. 1M10. trie- population of
the United States was 5.S0S.-5S3. It is
now 76,304.TV- Then we had sixteen
states. Now we have forty-five. Then
our territory consisted of ildO.CoO sqeare
miles. It is now 3.S46.iifiD square miles.
Education, religion and morality have
kept price with our advancement in oth­
er directions, and while extending its
power the government has adhered to
its foundation principles and abated
none of them in dealing with our new
peoples and possessions. nation so
preserved and blessed gives reverent
thanks to God and invoked® His guid­
ance and the continuation of Ilis care
and favor.
In our foreign intercourse the domi­
nant question has b'-en the treatment
of the Chinese problem. Apart from
this our relations with the foreign pow­
ers have been happy.
The recent troubles in China sj ring
from the anti-foreign agitation, which
for the past three years has gained
strength in the northern provinces.
Their origin lies deep in the character
of the Chinese races and in th" tradi­
tions of their government. The- Taip
ing rebellion and the opening: of Chi­
nese ports to foreign trade and settle­
ment disturbed alike the hornog' neity
and the seclusion of China.
Meanwhile foreign activity made it­
self felt in ail quarters, not alone on
the coast, but along the great river ar­
teries and in the remoter districts, car­
rying new ideas and introducing new
associations among a primitive people
which had pursued for centuries a na­
tional policy of isolation.
I'KOPOSAI.S O Til I'OWKIIS.
Scrioii.snc** ol tin- Si (tot I ion in China Ap
prei-iiitiMl.
The increasing gravity of the condi­
tions in China and the imminence of
peril to our own divorsitied interests
in the empire as well as to those of all
the other treaty governments, were
soon appreciated by this governni' nt,
causing it profound solicitude. The
United States from the earliest (lays of
foreign intercourse with China had fol­
lowed a policy of peace, omitting 110 oc­
casions to testify good will, to further
the extension of iawt'ul trade, to respect
the sovereignty of its government, and
to insure by all legitimate and kindly
but earnest means the fullest measure
of protection for the lives and property
of our law-...riding citizens and for the
exercise of tlu-ir beneficent tailings
among the Chinese people.
Mindful of tills, it was felt to be ap­
propriate that our purposes should be
pronounced in favor of such course as
would hasten united action of the pow­
ers at Pekin to promote the administra­
tive reforms so greatly needed for
strengthening the imperial government
and maintaining the integrity of China,
in which we believe the whole western
world to be alike concerned. To these
ends I caused to be addressed to the sev­
eral powers occupying territory and
maintaining spheres of influence in
China the circular proposals of 1SD0,
Inviting from them declarations of their
intentions and views as to the desira­
bility of the adoption of measures in­
juring the benefits of equality of treat­
ment of all foreign trade throughout
China.
With gratifying unanimity the re­
sponses coincided in this common pol­
icy, enabling me to see in the successful
termination of these negotiations proot
of the friendly spirit which animates
"the various powers interested In the
untrammeled development of commerce
and industry in the Chinese empire as
a source of vast benefit to the whole
commercial world.
In this conclusion, which had the
gratification to announce as a complet­
ed engagement to the interested pow ers
on March :!0. lOnri, hopefully discerned
a potential factor for the abatement of
the distrust of foreign purposes which
for a year past had appeared to in­
spire th" policy of the imperial gov­
ernment in he northern provinces
moat immediately Influenced by the
Manchu sentiment.
Reeking to testify confidence in the
willingness rind stability of the impe­
rial administration to redress the wrongs
and prevent the evils we suffered ami
feared, the marine guard, which had
been sent to tvkin in the summer of
1899 for the protection of the legation,
was withdrawn at the earliest practica­
ble moment, and all pending questions
were remitf as far as re
cerned. to the ordinary reports of dip­
lomatic intercourse

to be fL prey to iiirernal diVse'i?.-ions.
In the unequal contest the anti-l'oreign
influences soon gained the ascendancy
under the leadership of Prince Tuan.
Organized armies of Boxers. with
which (lie Imperial forces affiliated,
held the country between Pekin and
the coast, penetrated into Manchuria
up to the Russian border, and through
t.heir emissaries threatened a like rising
throughout northern China.
Attacks upon foreigners, destruction
of their property, and slaughter of na­
tive converts were reported from all
Bides. The tsung-li-yamen, already
permeated with hostile sympathies,
could make no effective response to the
appeals o£ the legations. At this crit­
ical junc'tire, in the early spring of
this year, a proposal was made by the
other powers that a combined fleet
should be assembled in Chinese waters
as a moral demonstration, under cover
of which to exact of the Chinese gov­
ernment respect for foreign tr(aty
rights and the suppression of the Box­
ers.
The United States, while not partici­
pating in the joint demonstration,
promptly sent from the Phillippiiies all
ships that could be spared for rvice
on the Chinese coast. A small force
of marines were landed at Taku and
sent to Pekin for the protection of the
American legation. Other powers took
similar action, until some 400 men were
assiembled in the capital as legation
guards.
[The president here tells of the siege
of the legations at Pekin, the landing
of troops and the rescue of the foreign
ministers.)
Taliing, as a point of departure, the
imperial edict appointing Karl la Hung
Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiar­
ies to arrange a setttoir.ent, and the
edict of Sept. 25, whereby certain high
officials were designated for punish­
ment, this government lias moved, in
concert with the other powers, toward
the opening of negotiations, which Mr.
Conger, assisted by Mr. Jlockliill. has
been authorized to conduct on behalf
of the United Stat.-s.
General bases of negotiation formu­
lated by the government the Kivm-h
republic have been accepted with cer­
tain reservations as to deiails, made
necessary by our own circutest an es,
but, like similar reservations by other
powers, open to discussion in the prog­
ress of the negotiations. Tin- disposi­
tion of the emperor's government to
admit liability for wrongs (lme to for­
eign governments and their nationals,
ar.d to act upon such additional desig­
nation of the guilty persons as the for­
eign ministers at Pekin may be in a po­
sition to make, gives hope of a complete
settlement of all finest ions involved, as­
suring foreign rights of residence and
intercourse on terms of equality for all
the world.
1 regard as one of the essential fac­
tors of a durable adjustment the se
eurement of adequate guarantees for
liberty of faith, since inseem ity of
those natives who may embrace alien
creeds is a scarcely less effectual as­
sault upon the rights of foreign wor­
ship and teaching th."n would be the di­
rect invasion thereof.
The matter of indemnity for our
wronged ci'izens is a question of grave
concern. Mc-asured in minify alone, a
sufficient reparation may prove to be
beyond the ability of China to meet.
AH the power? concur in emphatic dis­
claimers of any purpose of ro^.grandize
ment through dismemberment of the
empire. am disposed to think that
due compensation may he made in part
by increased guarantees of security for
foreign rights and imnnir.ities. and.
most important of all. by the opening
of China to the equal commerce of a'l
the world. Th. se views nave been and
will be earnestly advocated by our rep­
resentatives
The government of "Russia has put

regard to indemnities the matter may
be relegated to the court of arbitration
at The T-Jaeti". favorably mel'ne to
this, believing that high tribunal could
not fail to reach a solution no less
conducive to the stability and enlarged
prosperity of China itself than immedi
at"iv beneficial to th" power's.
TThe president here tells of our rela­
tions with other fop'ign countries,
which are very friendly. He d- votes
considerable space to our i-xhibit at the
Paris exposition, the S'ainoan settle­
ment. boundary nues"i"ns and other
matters in which the United States is

T1IK MCAltAOlA CANAL.
Overture-* for Convention to l-IH'oct Its
Iti.iUling by tlie I nit.-d Stnts.
The all-important matter of an inter
oceanic caiiut has assumed a new phase.
Adhering to its refusal to reopt the
question of the forfeiture of the con­
tract of the Maritime Canal company,
which was terminated for alleged non
exeeution in October, 18!t"J. the govern­
ment of Nicaragua has since supple­
mented that action by declaring the so
styled Kyie-Cramin option void for
non-payment of the stipulated advance.
Protests in relations to these acts have
been filed In the state department and
are under consideration. Deeming it­
self relieved from existing engage­
ments. the Nicaraguan government
shows a dispositon to deal freely with
the canal question either in lie way of
negotiations with the United States or
by taking measures to promote the wa­
terway.
Overtures for a convention to effect
the building of a canal under tile aus­
pices of the United States are under
consideration. In the meantime the
views of the congress upon the general
subject, in the light of the report of
the commission appointed to examine
the comparative merits of the various
trans-isthmian ship canal projects may
be awaited.
I commend to the early attintion of
the senate the convention with Great
Britain to facilitate the construction of
such, a canal and to remove any objec­
tion whhih might arise out of the con­
vention commonly called the Chiyton
Bnlwer treaty.
The long standing eontenti. with
Portugal, growing oot of the seizure of
the Delagoii Bay railway, lias 1 een at
last tfrniired by a favorable award
of the tribunal of arbitration at Kerne,
to which it was submitted. The amount
of the uward which was dep. si'.d in
T.ondon awaiting arrangements by the
governments of the I'n.ited Plates and
Gr-at Mritnin for its disp sal, has re­
cently h( en paid over to the two gov­

CONGRESS MEETS

WASHINGTON-, DOC. 4.—Tho opening
of congress drew great crowds to the
Capitol, intent on witnessing those in­
teresting SCOIIOH marking the inaugura­
tion of the legislative work of tho gov­
ernment. On June 7 last the first ses­
sion of the Fifty-sixth congress ad­
journed and tho second session began
during tho day with many momentous
questions waiting tho attention of the
national lawmakers.
Early in tlie day the tido of humanity
turned down Pennsylvania avenue
toward the Capitol, filling the broad
walks leading to the marble terrace,
•which by 11 o'clock presented a scene
of busy activity. On the eastern plaza
front there was the same scene of ac­
tivity, long liues of carriages swinging
up to tho wings, bringing senators,
members of the house, public officials
and' interested observers, while the
in any lines of cars contributed their
quota of tho interested public. Inside
tho building but little restriction hud
been placed on the free moving of the
throng and the crowd moved at will
1 roin One Wing to the Oilier.
All of the 1 ublic galleries were open,
bo that every one in the good nutured
crowd had an equal chance. By 11
o'clock tho elevators began to be be­
sieged and there wero signs of an over­
flow at tho doors leading to the gal­
leries. It was evident that the ladies
took great iuterest in the procedure,
for they were present in full force, one
delegation of girl students numbering
over 00.
There were conferences among senfc
ators as to the programmo of the week
and unusual activity was displayed by
members ou both sides of the Capitol.
Speaker Henderson arrived at his
private office about 11:15 and was soon
surrounded by members discussing the
programme of business. On the senate
6ide there was less evidence of activity
and the crowds were rather slow in in­
vading tho galleries. The president
pro tem, Mr. Fryo, was at his office
early, conferring with senators, and
by 11:30 the floor of the senate began
to show signs of activity preceding
actual bnsiness.

Fifteen .Meet Almost Instant
Death and Most of the Oth­
ers Are Injured.
SAN FI:AXC!SCO, Dec. 1. —A revised
list of the dead in the horrible accident
to a crowd ot men end hoys witnessing
the Stnuford-Califoiniu football game
from the roof of a glass mauufactorv
shows 15 names. More than 1U0 per­
sons fell into the furnace of the fac­
tory when the roof collapsed. The in­
jured now being cared for in hospitals
or at their homes number 88, and oi
these several cannot survive.
Charles Yost, foreman of the gfass
works, was raking the fire when the
crash came and narrowly escaped be­
ing struck by the falling bodies, lie
says that those killed either struck tin
heavy bands surrounding the glass oven
or wero crushed by those who fell on
top of them. Many succeeded in stay­
ing their descent for a moment by
holding on to t-he broken beams, but
before they could be reached tiiev were
Obliged to Let Go Their Mold
and drop to the floor, a uiMance* of '.'0
feet. Clarence Jeter, a furnace tender,
pulled eight people off the top of the
retorts, where the heat was about 500
degrees. Some of the men and boy
were terribly burned. They were drawn
away from the retorts with long iron
pokers, used in testing the glass.
The managers of the glass works
state that it was impossible for them
to keep the people off their buildings.
They disclaim all responsibility for the
accident. It is estimated that over tfou
people were 011 the centilator when it
collapsed for its entire length of 100
feet. Some were thrown to the 111 tun
roof of the building and escaped un­
hurt. but of those who fell into the
structure, nearly all were either killed
or seriously maimed.
Cnriiitf lr tlie Injured.
The police and hospital authorities
were soou notified and every patrol
wagon and hospital ambulance 111 the
city were summoned. There were not
enough of them and express wagons
and private carriages were pressed into
service to curry off the dead and
wounded. Many of the injured were
unconscious,while others were liurrie 1,
shrieking with pain, to the hospitals.
At the hospitals there were soon a
shortage of surgeons and some of the
wounded hud to wait until help ctune.
The roof of tiie glass works was 110:
200 feet away from the football Held,
but the iO.uOO people watching the
game were too interested to uotici
what had occurred. It was only when
tho ushers went through the vast crowd
calling for doctors that it became known
there had been an accident.
