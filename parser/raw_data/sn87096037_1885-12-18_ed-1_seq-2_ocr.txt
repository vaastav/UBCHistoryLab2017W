The Crusader is the name of a large
brig which has been equipped for car
rying oil from Philadelphia to Liver
pool in a new way. She has 46 tanks,
which hold 177,000 gallons of oil each.
These will be pumped full in America
and empty on the other side by a
large pump run by a 20-horse power
engine with which the ship is equipped.
Mrs. J. Wilkes Booth (widow of the
assassin of Lincoln) has resided with
her two children—a daughter and a
son, now grown to maturity—under
an assumed name for twenty years
past. The widow says they know that
his last act, ending a good man's life,
was wrong, but, in her opinion, those
who live long enough will learn that
some, high in authority, were at the
head of a diabolical conspiracy and
were Lincoln's real assassins.
A mad dog having bit six little chil.
dren in the streets of Newark, the citi

which will be enough to send them to
Paris and support them while under
the care of Pasteur, the eminent sur

discoveries in the nature and cure of
hydrophobia. The result of the ex
periment will be followed with keen in
terest by all physicians, and if the
children are rescued from death by
Pasteur's treatment, his process will
be widely introduced in practice.
The Supreme Court of Illinois decid
ed a case the other day that is of
general interest. The city of Ottowa
issued bonds undar an ordinance sub
mitted to a vote of the people and
adopted thereby, which authorized
the mayor to borrow in the name of the
city the sum of $60,000 "for the use of
said city, to be expended in develop
ing the natural advantages of the city
for manufacturing purposes,"and pro
vided for the issue of bonds therefor.
The court held that the bonds so is
sued were void, for want of power in
the corporate authorities to issue the
same.

He recalls the boast the late James
Gordon Bennett made that when he
died it would not be necessary to
change'the name of the proprietor at
the head of the editorial page of he
Herald, as his son and successor bore
the same name. Years before, while
still in the old Nassau and Fulton
street' building, he had given orders
that the
doors of the office should nev

.paper suspended for any cause. It
might be as well to give Bennett the
credit of perfecting a scheme that sur
vives him.
Land Commissioner Sparks' recent
decision to the effect that homestead
claimants who have previously had
the benefit of the pre-emption law, can
not "commute" their homestead
claims, is not retroactive, and will not
affect claims which have passed by
purchase into the hands by third
parties. Gen. Sparks says that the
decision will, unless reversed by higher
authority, be a guide for the future
action of land officers but that the
commissioner is not inclined to so in
to the actions of his predecessor, nor
interfere with claims which have al
ready been secured under former rul
ings of the land office in this respect,
unless fraud is shown to have been
perpetrated in securing such claims.

Winnipeg Special:—RlePs remains Were
brought to ..Winnipeg from Reginta in
private car in charge ol two CatfcoltopriestB.
Great difficulty was experienced with Go*.
Dewdney in procuring the body. It was
not known here that the body was
coming and there was no one at the
station tc) meet it, consequently no
demonstration. A soparate engine was
hitched'to the car at the station here and
it was run across the river to St. Boniface,
where ^Riel's brother, Alexander, and a
number of half-breeds were in waiting with
sleighs to receive the body. They placed it
onone sleigh and drove it to his .mother's
home at St. Vital, where all the family
and relatives were in waiting to re

knew no bounds when the body was
carried in. The box was opened, disclosing
the face, somewhat blackened and slightly
disfigured. The body was washed and
dressed before being exposed. The old
home was heavily draped in black. The
body will be brought to St. Boniface cathe
dral and grand requiem mass celebrated.
The body will be then interred by the side
of his lather in the St. Boniface Catholic

The Washington Evening Star says: The
ruling of Commissioner Sparks, of the gen
eral land office, suspending the issue of
land patents in certain sections of the
west, which embraces Dakota, has created
no little excitement in that region. Com
plaining letters from settlers affected by
the ruling are coming to senators. The
comp.aint is that the commissioner's ac
tion makes the innocent suffer with the
guilty, and that it imposes the same hard
ships and inconveniences upon those who
purchased their homesteads honestly as
those who resorted to dishonest methods.
A strong effort will probably be made to
have the ruling changed so as to apply only
to persons known to have entered their
ands in an irregular manner.

The Burial of Vanderbilt.
The Vanderbilt family desired the re
mains of the husband and father to be
conveyed to the tomb with as little dis
play as possible, and their wishes were re
spected. Fifth avenne is not much given
to display, even when a million
aire is carried to his tomb, and
when the hour for the funeral of Will
iam H. Vanderbilt arrived Friday morning
the 10th, there were but few indications,
even in the neighborhood of the Vanderbilt
home that anything unusual was going on.
Just three flags fluttered athalf mast among
a plenty of bare poles. No badge of crape
was seen anywhere except on the little
electric bell at the Vanderbilt mansion.
The ceremonies in the church were simple
Episcopal burial services. They were con
ducted by Rev. Dr. Cooke, the pas
tor, and Mr. Clapp. Bishop Potter
was present in his robes, but did
not participate. The priests met the pall
bearers at the door of the church and pre
ceded them down the center aisle, chanting
as they walked along. Preceding tho collin
walked the pall bearers, wearing white
sashes. They were:
Channcey M. Depew, J. Pierrepont Mor
gan,. Charles Rapallo, William Turnbull,
William Bliss, George J. Magee, C. M. Berger,
Charles C. Clark, Judge John R. Brady, W.
L. Scott, D. O. Mills and S. W. Caldwell.
The remains were taken to a ferry boat
and thence to New York, Staten Island
where islocatcd the Vanderbilt mausoleum'

Winnepeg Special: Riel's remains were
laid'to rest beneath the Catholic cathedral
at St. Boniface, the
authorities being afraid,
to bury them in a grave as they might be
stolen. To show the esteem in which the de
ceased rebel was held, his people bore his re
mainsupontheirshouldersallthe way from
St. Vital, almostsix miles. To seethestal
wart, rugged forms of eight ha
li-breeds with
beards covered with frost struggling under
their load was a sight never to be forgotten.
Two paces in front of the coffin walked
Riel's two brothers, Joseph and Alexandre,
both stalwart specimens of their race.
The first sleigh in the procession contained
Riel's mother, his two sisters and his wifo.
The poor old woman on leaving the house in:
sisted on walking in the procession', and did
so as long as her failing strength would bear
her up. She was at last obliged to ride in
a sleigh. The ordinary roquim mass was
celebrated by the clergy at the cathedral.
The poor mother was weeping piteously,
as were also other members ol the family
and relatives, a large number of whom
were present.
The Sea Moines Valley Lands.
Senator Wilson, of Iowa, has renewed his
proposition to settle the old and vexed
question of title in the Des Moines valley.
These lands are along the Des Moines above
liacoon fork. Under a grant in aid of a
canal in 1846, they were improperly certi
fied by thy department of the interior to the
state of Iowa, therefrom located lands
sold by the United States, the state re
ceived indemnity lands for them, and the
Iowa legislature, in 1856, ratified the ac
ceptance. -By this act the state was stop
ped from all claims to the grant in the Des
Moines valley. Settlers went on those
granted lands supposing they were part ol
the public domain, the state treated them
as trespassers, and sued them.

Usually the spot where he died. Hence,
in order to keep him at least from the
house, the Kaffirs carry a sick man
out into the open air to die and the
Maoris used to remove the sick into
sheds. If a Kaffir or a Maori died be
fore he could be carried out the house
was tabooed and deserted. There are
traces in Greece, Rome and China of
this custom of carrying dying persons
into the open air.
But in case the ghost should, des
pite of all precautions, make his way
back from the grave, steps were taken
to barricade the house against lihn.
Thus, in some parts of Russia and
East Prussia an axe or a lock is laid
on the threshold or a knife is hung
over the door, and in Germany as
so.on as the coffin is carried out
of the house all the doors and
.windows are shut, whereas, as long as
the body is still in the house, the win
dows (and sometimes the doors) are
left constantly open to allow the soul
to escape. In some parts of England
every bolt and lock in the house is un
fastened so that the ghost of tha dying
man may fly freely away.
But if primitive man knew how to
bully, he also knew how to outwit the
{»host. For example, aghost can only
find his way back to the house by the
way by which he left it. This little
weakness did not escape the vigilance of
our ancestors and they took their
measures accordingly. The coffin was
carried out of the house, not by the
door, but by a hole made for the pur
pose in the wall, and this hole was care
fully stopped up as soon as the body
had been through it, so that when
the ghost strolled quietly back from
the grave, he found to his
surprise that there was no
throughfare. The credit of this inge
nious device is shared equally by
Greenlanders, Hottentots.Bechuanas,
Samoieds, Ojibways, Algonkins,
Laosians, Hindoos,Tibetans,Siamese,
Chinese and Fijians. These special
opening, or "doors of the dead, are
still to be seen in a village near Amster
dam and they were common in some
towns of Central Italy, as Perugia and
Assisi. A trace of the same custom
survives in Tliuringen, where it is
thought that the ghost of a man who
has been hanged will return to a house
if the body be not taken out by a win
dow instead of the door.
The Siamese, not content with carry
ing the dead man out by a special
opening, endeavor to make assurance
doubly sure by hurrying him three
times round the house at full speed—a
proceeding well calculated to bewilder
the poor soul in the
coffin. TheArau
canians adopt the plan of strewing
ashes behind the coffin as it is being
borne to the grave, in order that the
ghost may not oe able to find his way
back.
New York Hotels.
Without doubt New York has the
best hotels in America, one reason
being that the metropolis is the great
est labor market in the country. As
the chief port for arriving immigrants,
as the most populous and wealthy city
of the republic, it naturally attracts
the best servants. At the Windsor,
even when the house is full, there are
more servants than guests, yet the
great staff of employes is controlled
with ease. New York has trade
societies of hotel cooks, bakers, butch
ers and waiters, which can readily re
place undesirable servants. Asarule,
maintaining^ high standard of char
acter and efficiency among their mem
bers, they are held in much esteem.
Hotel keepers compared with house
holders have little, trouble with
servants, chiefly for two reasons. The
hotel servant has a definite duty, or
small round of duties, which once
mastered, can be efficiently performed.
No combination of cook, laundress,
chambermaid, waitress, and scrubber
is required. Again, the servants have
definite hours for duty, after which
they are free and freedom is a boon
dealt out very sparingly to the ordi
nary domestic drudge. Besides, too, a
large regiment of servants working
and living together, provides each
with company of his or her own class
a privilege of value, and one which
solves the vexatious question of fol
lows. Contrast this with the ceaseless
toil and almost complete isolation of
the ordinary domestic, and cease to
wonder at the calm manner of a man
who may have under his charge three
to five hundred servants. The very
extent of the staff lends aid to its
management,as applicants for employ
ment are constantly enrolling their
addresses in a little book on the pro
prietor's desk. That little book is
usually labeled "Next." Whisperings
as to its contents have their effect in
checking vicious tendencies and car
prices and in controlling impulsive
resentment. The elaborateness of
modern furniture and appointments,
the refined nicety which demands con
stant painting, scouring and washing,
the increased detail of service and
attention, have all combined within
recent years to augment the number
of servants required for a hotel of
eiven size. In thirteen years, business
for business, the pay-roll of the most
lucrative house in New York has
lengthened out one-third.—George lies,
in the Century for August.
The Stingiest Man in Massachu
setts.
Probably the most economical man
in Essex County resides in West Lynn.
He is a hard worker, and three crackers
and a half pint of milk and water are
a banquet for him. He occupies his
leisure time in quartering matches,
and a quarter gross goes a long way
in his house. For the benefit of those
who cannot understand how a man
can divide a match in four parts, the
following plan is riven: "Have a thin
bladed penknife lay the match on a
smooth surface, red end pointed to
ward you split the match by pressing
down upon it with the knife, being
careful not to cut across the grain."
Long practice has made this fellow so
skillful-that he rarely fails to make
one match do the work of four. Once
in a while his wife used to muster up
courage to appropriate a chicken
from their flock and bake it for dinner.
Upon his return home this man, who
is so "minking," as some of his neigh
bors put it, used to open the oven
door, take a good long smell of the
fumes arising from the roasting
chicken, drink a glass of milk, and go
back to work, declaring that he had
hajjl "a feast fit for a king." This
man had a son and one daughter.
The son died, leaving about $1,000 to
the girl, who was but a child. It is
slid by the neighbors that heactually
charged his own daughter for board
until the $1,000 had found its way to
his bask account.—Boston Post.

A BRAVE GIRL'S HABD LUCK.
While Working for Hone at Independence,
the Prairie Fires Sweep
Away
Some of herfriends finally discovered
that the girl had a history, as many
such heroic adventurers in this country
have. She had lived in comfortable
circumstances in a rural Illinois town
until the death of her father revealed
the fact that he had lost not only his
own property but a trust fund belong
ing to a relative, not yet of age, by his
fatal propensity for speculating in the
Chicago gpain market. The girl felt
her position keenly, and, though she
had expected soon to be married, she
resolutely turned from her lover and
sought the far West. She had read of
the success achieved by young women
as farmers in this vicinity, and per
suading her morher that this was
their only hope of regaining their in
dependence, and at the same time
making good the deficit of their hus
band and father, the two converted
what little property they had into
cash and came here. Before their de
parture the girl absolved the young
man from his pledges, but in answer
to his repeated requests gave him
some slight hope that at a distant
day, if he still remained of the same
mind, she might consider a proposi
tion from him. Under these circum
stances the work of breaking and
working a farm in a new country was
begun.
The first year Fannie and her moth
er had no help, and they did not suc
ceed in raising much. Not more than
a quarter of their land was under
cultivation, and the crops were poor
indeed. This year, with the assistance
of a boy, they did better. They got
more than half of the farm in wheat,
and the crop was an exceptionally
good one. Besides this, they had a
fruitful garden from which they sup
plied their own wants and derived a
small revenue. Their wheat, on which
they had already borrowed money,
was to have been thrashed a few
weeks ago, but the machine did not ar
rive, and it remained in great stacks
near their barn. Figuring on the re
sults of their two years' work, moth
er and daughter found that there was
a chance that this years' crop would
clear them of debt, and that with one
or two more favorable seasons they
would be able to see the results of
their toil in hard cash.
The prairie fire was a danger which
they had not taken into consideration.
When Fannie heard that fires were re
ported at a distance she ran furrows
around her buildings and wheat stacks,
and in other ways. prepared for the
visitation. Her neighbors did the
same, and when the fires appeared
near at hand nearly everybody went
out to fight them. Fannie's moth
er remained at home when the girl
was gone on these errands. On re
turning to her place one evening,
the young woman found fires in
her way, and being forced to make a
long detour, it was dark before she
came to a point where she could see
her farm. The fires were raging fiercely,
arid'she made up her mind that her
farm was threatened of not already
burned over. Somebody had set back
fires, with the intention of stopping
the conflagration, and this was the
result. As fast as her weaiy and
trembling limbs "could carry her the
girl dashed on, and a few steps more
sufficed to convince her that her
home and everything that it contained
was lost. When she arrived at
the place the house was in ruins,
the barn was ready to fall, and the
great wheat stacks were glowing heaps
of embers. The earth was hot under
her feet, and the air almost stifling.
She called for her mother, and called
again. No one answered. She became
sick with fear and foreboding, and
thought of flight, but there was no
place to which she could go for help.
The fires were all around her, making
the heavens lurid and the air heavy,
and so, in the presence of her crushing
disaster, the gitl sat down and wept.
All night long she sat by the rums
of her home, and when tne morning
light appeared she made a careful
search for her mother. She was not in
the ruins of the house, and the girl
breathed easier, but in the ashes of
the barn the old lady's charred re
mains were found. She had evidently
gone there after doiug all in her power
to save the place for the purpose of
taking the horse and making her es
cape, but overcome with the heat, or
Eoth
ossibly unable to manage the beast,
had perished together.
Fannie's mother was buried on Sun
day by the neighbors, most of whom,
like the girl, had lost nearly every
thing. What was to be done nobody
knew. Where all were penniless and
wretched there was no advice that
could be followed, and all seemed
stunned by the calamity which had
come upon them. On Tuesday Fan
nie visited her farm for the last time,
intending to leave that day for the
railroad and seek assistance,she knew
not what or of whom. Her poverty
was absolute. Her debts were greater
than her equity in the land. Every
thing that she had on earth was de
stroyed except the clothing that she
wore. She stood by the ruined home
and looked out for miles on blackened
prairie. The sky was overcast. with
leaden clouds, and the wind blew crisp
and cold from the north. Above ana
below everything was dark, but the
sombre view was not blacker than her
own future. She buried her face
in her
hands and turned from the desolate
•cene just in time to here the clatter of

Bight Time.
A letter from Frederick, Dakota, to
the New York Sun, tells the following
story, which contains some elements
of romance:
The prairie fires, which have brought
desolation and poverty to hundreds
in this section, brought a husband to
one young woman. A year ago last
spring Fannie Jordan took up a farm
of 160 acres about nine miles north of
here, and struck out for herself. She
came to Dakota from Illinois,
though she was born in the East. Not
much was known about her for sev
eral months, as she was shy and re
tiring, but when she finally became
acquainted with her neighbors they
discovered that the girl had the real
mettle in her, and predicted that she
would be rich before she was 30.
Though far from muscular, Fannie
was the picture of health, and she
easily carried off the palm as the best
lookmg girl farmer in the county.
Like the majority of her sisters she
had no time to devote to the gallants
of the neighborhood, and for a year
and a half she led a hard, grinding ex
istence, practicing the closest economy,
and working from early morning un
til late at night.

Old Time British Press Gang's.
Mother, about to visit her family in
South Wales, has taken her passage in
a sailing vessel from Falmouth bo
Swansea. She is arranging her multi
farious luggage on board, when a
handsome young sailor, of singularly
agreeable appearance, rushes into her
cabin. The press gang is comiug, he
says, "and is sure to seize him, the
only young and likely man on board.
He has just returned from a long voy
age. Will the lady save him from the
cruel fate? Will she let him secrete
himself among her luggage?" Motner
abhors the tyrannical custom of seiz
ing men by force for service on the
ships of war, and full of com
passion, consented to his con
cealment. The King's officer with
his men seareh the vessel. He next
opens the door of mother's cabin,and
apparently much out of humor, ad
vances cutlass in hand. Mother,look
ing up from her book or work, begs
him to respect the privacy of her
cabin. The Captain of the press gang
makes a sign to his men to stand back,
but sajrs, "He is bound to do his duty
a man is missing, whom hehas reason
to suppose is on board, therefore—"
Mother, outwardly calm, but inwardly
terribly alarmed, interrupts him with
the words, "I am a lady traveling
alone, you are a gentleman." These
words seem to disarm him He offers
a polite apology, and, retiring, quits
the vessel with his men. The moment
they are gone the Captain gives order
to sail. The rescued sailor creeps from
his hiding place, but is not allowed to
show himself till they are out at sea.
He becomes mother's constant at
tendant during the long and stormy
passage which ensues while she, the
only female on board, receives ex
treme'consideration from the Captain
and the entire crew, who regard her as
a general benefactress.—Mary Howitt.
