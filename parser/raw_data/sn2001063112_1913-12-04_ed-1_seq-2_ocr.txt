•For the democrats will hold only one

•LET THE MAJORITY ITtJLH.
A number of citizens have request
ed ,Tlie Republican to enlighten them
as to what the majority and minority
iqass meetings should do, who should
:attend, how the meeting should be
cohducted) how their procedure cftn
be safeguarded, etc. V£he Republi
can is willing to undertake many a
'"dlftlcult task, but it intist politely de-
Cllhe to attempt to guide the voters
through the maizes required by the
Richards primary system, and more
particularly through these mass meet
ings, As the law 'virtually makes
them free-for-all .affairs.
The Republican has too candidates
for-honors at the hand of these mass
meetings. The contest in tho major
ity republican meeting apparently
will center on the selection of a
•state committeeman, Lewis Shuet.er
and'Ray Branson are candidates. As
between them the voters of the
county must choose. Both by allow
ing the use ot their names are to
be
classified as supporters of Byrne and
Crawford* and The. Republican has
been unable to find in the Richards
primary any kihd of test to npply to
such professions. They can only be
accepted'as sincere. Mr. Sh'uster lias
been consistent progressive republi
can for many years and while his op
ponent has taken little part in poli
tics, his father was one of the origin
al -progressive republicans in the
•county and in this campaign has been
one of the most pronounced support
er* of Senator Crawford. Either will
be a candidate representative of the
party and the contest between them
.roust necessarily be largely a person
al one.
If either pt them is not in good
faith a member of the majority fac
tion, his name should not be consld
©red. Their own Statements must be
accepted aa to that, because there
can t« no appeal from them.
At all events, lit is hoped and be
lieved that the utmost fairness tnd
orderliness wlU pervade the meet
ing and the contest. By such a spirit
the deficiency of the law in not defin
ing a method of procedure will be
supplied. Any other course must
prove damaging to either side in the
remainder c.f the) campaign and it
certainly la right that each side
should say, as has been said, that no
old-tlnifr caucus methods will be
tolerated.
^WILSON'S MESSAGE.
S
lent Wilson continues his
writlng pioaBages in tab­
loid form. Today he read to con­
gress his first, general message and
It was the briefest of its kind in
Many years.^Consequently the pub­
lic will know a great deal more
about what he lias said than it has
In the past about tin contents of
presidential messages. As a rule they
have been so intermlnablyy long that
very many have not even attempted
to wade int them.
President Wilson's message today
Is notable chieliy in two particulars.
First, and by far the most, important
of his recommendations is .one de­
claring the necessity of legislation to
provide for primary elections for the
selection of national party candi­
dates. Hi' advocates iln• use of tlu
convention solely for the purpose of
formulating platforms and ratifying
the work of the primaries. Under
that plan delegates would lie chosen
to national conventions by the direct,
vote of tlio people. There would be
no opportunities for contests, or for
Jobbery in tho handling of delegates.
The primary elections would settle
all question as to what, candidate
would receive the support, of any dis
trict or state. This certainly is as
it should be, and if the national
party organizations had been alive to
their own interests, they would have
made their own provisions for such
primary elections. It. is rather ironi­
cal that a democratic president
should be recommending a euro for
the very evil that all but wrecked
the republican party in the last cam
paign.
The other noteworthy feature of
Wilson's message in Ills declaration
for tho conservation of resources by
tlio national government. Against
this democrats in congress and out
have thundered ll\eir protests on be
half of that ancient and sacred tra­
dition of states' rights. President
Wilson shows how much regard lie
has for this doctrine by dismissing
the question in a single sentence. He
declares there should be no conflict
between state and federal authori­
ties in carrying out a policy of con-
I
servatlon, for the reason that there
should bo IIO difference In purpose
Here the president, lias put his fin
ger on the sore spot that is caus­
ing all the clamor for states' rights.
Wilson says there should be no diffi­
culty between states and nation be
cause both- should be actuated by
the same purpose. But the fact is
that those who are lighting for con­
servation by state authorities, are
not actuated by the same purpose
is are those who have cham­
pioned national conservation. In
nearly every case, they have attempt­
ed to make out of states' rights a
shield behind which to carry on ex-
oxploltation of the country's re
sources. Wilson, has virtually chal
lenged tliem by raising the question
of purpose. Thus onco again does
he demonstrate that ho Is indeed a
disciple of the "new nationalism"
preached BO earnestly by President
Rooseevlt.

ART CM'ti (JIVES RECEPTION.
The Mitchell Art ('lub on Monday
afternoon was hostess to the Round
Tabic club at. ihe home of Mrs. 11. H.
Edwards in a reception given in hon
or of Mrs. Zella K. Wilson, teacher of
English in the Aberdeen Normal
school. The two clubs are Die only
ones in the city which belong to the
State Federation, and Mrs. Wilson
came in her official capacity as presid
ent of the South Dakota Federation
of Women's clubs to deliver then? her
message in person. The reception was
a well-appointed affair and after a
half-hour ot social intercourse Mrs.
Wilson proceeded to give to the club
ladles her ideas on the ways anil
means of making their woi'K more
efficacious. She appealed to them ear
nestly to do their part in the vast
civic, economic and domestic prob
lems that are confronting this coun
try and which must lie solved. She
said In part: "The foundation rocks
on which we should build our super
structure are love, courage, charity,
prudence, and truth. If we have these
fundamental virtues well inbedded in
our foundation, our building will not
crumble. The influence of women's
clubs is being felt in every walk of
life. Men'of large affairs of slate and
nation are beginning to realize that
the women's clubs of the United Stat
es wield a powerful influence for
good and that their backing and re
commendation of any cause will help
to bring it to a successful Issue. A
large per cent of the moral
intellec-
1
lual and civic advance In the com
munity Is due to the influence of the
woman's club. Women have learned
lo think clearly, differ amicably, and
act wisely. For the most part, club
women are progressive. Our debt to
the National Endowment Fund is now
liquidated and we are now starting
out with our State Endowment fund,
with a nucleus of seventy dollars. We the subject
thought best lo make the outer rim of Days." Mrs.
SOPHOMORE OCCASN'O.W
uean and Mrs. van Bentiiuysen
were at home last Tuesday evening to
the fifty members of the sophomore
class of the university. The decora
tions for the occasion were elaborate
quantities of red roses being used for
this purpose. Other decorations were
in harmony with the spirit, of Thanks
giving time. The entertainment pro
vided afforded the maximum of eu
joyment for the guests. Not the least
enjoyable was the turkey hunt. The
favors given were unique and sugges
tive of Thanksgiving features. The
singing of familiar songs assisted in
making the hours pass only too speed
ily. Refreshments of a dainty cliarac
ter were served toward the close of
the evening.
A PLEASURABLE EVENING.
Mrs. William M. Smith and Mrs.
Virginia Doyle entertained the Elks'

On Thanksgiving evening the mem
bers of Mitchell lodge, No. 800, Broth

to be the biggest social -dancing event
of the season.
The hall was beautifully decorated,
with the colors used in railway train

The stage was decorated with the
model of a head-end vie\v of a full
sized standard .locomotive from the
sides of which colored bunting was
extended to the sides of the stage
and to Ihe height of the engine stack.
The engine carried a headlight,
green flags and green side lights
which signified that this was the
"fourth section" and that they were
to carry "signals" for another to
follow. Hie number plate bore "800"
the number of their lodge. Hanging
from the balcony were lanterns at
short intervals, alternately,red, white
and green colors, together with clus
ters of flags of the same color. From
the center chandelier suspended a
cluster of red and green lanterns. The
ceiling was decorated with bunting
suspended from each chandelier
around the hall and draped from
each of them to the center one.

PlankitUon, S. D.—For many years
this city has had a men's organization
known as the Aurora club, the pur
pose of which was to provide suit
able social life for its members. As
a result of a widespread demand for
an organization that should exercise
the functions of an up-to-date com
mercial club the members of tlio
Aurora club have decided to extend
to the business men of the city and
to all interested in the matter an in
vitation to join them in forming a
Commercial club. Already a goodly
number have entered into the move
ment, and it is expected to have fifty
to seventy-five members soon. A
meeting has been called for Dec. 5th.
when new officers are to be elected
and plans laid for boosting the city's
Interests. The rooms of the Auro.»
club, among the best in this part of
the state, are to be used as head
quarters for the new commercial club.
A special secretary is to be employed,
who together with a booster commit
tee, will seek to do for Plankinton
what is being done by such organiza
tions everywhere.

Pierre, S. D. —-General attendance
of both factions of the republican and
democratic parties at the state pro
posal meetings in January is indicat
ed by the published calls in the dilt
ferent counties of the state for meet
ings of both factions. In many cases
the democrats have issued but one
call, which is presumed to include
both the majority and minority fac
tions, while the republicans are issu
ing two calls, one for each faction.
The socialists and prohibitionists are
calling majority meetings in a few of
the counties of the state, and their
representation in the stale meetings
will probably be merely sufficient to
hold their party organization and I
party places on tile ballot, as that is
the only method by which iliey can
secure a party place.

Woman Who Lost Legacy Under Ab

y- *.:v' -*f-
Boston, Mass.—Miss Mabel F. Allen
of Brooklyn, N. Y., who has proven
herself alive after the Suffolk county
probate court, the state supreme court
and the United States Supreme court
had declared her dead, received $2,GOO
as her share of the property left by
her grandfather, Jonathan Merry.
When the will of Mr. Merry was
liled several years ago. Judge Grant
of the probate court was informed
that Miss Allen had been missing
for fourteen years, and, under the ab
sentee statute, he declared her dead.
The question of Miss Allen's being
declared legally dead was taken to the
state supreme court and the United
States Supreme court on the constitu
tionality of the absentee clause.
In 1911 Miss Allen received the first
information that a legacy awaited her
while reading in a newspaper that
the United States Supreme court had
decided that she was dead. She ap
peared in the probate court and estab
