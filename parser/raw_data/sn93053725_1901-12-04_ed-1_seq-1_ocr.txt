Bill Against Anarchists Presen
ted By Senator Eoroughs.
ANARCHISTS CANNOT LAND.
Bill Calls for Committee of Twelve to
Make Investigations "When "Neces
saryPresident Sent Hay-Fauuee-rote
Treaty to the Senate Istbuiiai
Canal Commission's Report Also
Presented.
Washington, Dec 4. The senate was
the only branch iu session to-day and'
only formal business was transacted.
The president sent to the senate the
II ay-Pa uneefote treaty tor the canal
and a number of recent appointments.
Senator Borroughs introduced a bill
to provide for the exclusion of and the
deportation of alien anarchists. Section
1 is as follows: No " alien anarchist
fchail hereafter be allowed to land in
the United States or be admitted into
the Siates. Section 2 directs that a
special board of inquiry be authorized
to make dillsent Investigation concern
ing the antecedents of aliens seeking
admission or suspected of being an
archists. Provision is made for the ap
pointment of twelve agents to uiake
investigation In forelng countries con
cerning Intended emigrants.
The report of the isthmian canal
commission was sent to congress to
day. The commission, as anticipated
several weeks ago, favors the Nicar
agua route and makes an estimate of
lS9tSG4,0G2 as the total cost of con
struction of the canal through Nicar
agua. The estimated cost of the Pana
ma route is S144.233.3-jS. but, tlm re
port say3, it would cost $109,141,000 to
obtain the Panama concession. The
commission value the work done at
S10,000,000. The report says the Pana
ma route is feasible as a sea level
. canal, while the Nicaragua route must
be by locks, but Lake Nicaragua will
furnish " an inexhaustible supply of
water for the canal. The Nicaragua
route has no natural harbors at either
e'Jd, but satisfactory harbors may be
constructed. Harbors already exist at
each end of the Panama route, but con
siderable work must be done at the en
trance of the harbor on- the Atlantic
side. "With adequate force and p!-'nt
the commission estimate that the Nicar
agua canal can be completed in six
years, exclusive of two years - for
preparation. Ten years Isestimatod to
complete the Panama canal. The tr.tai
length of the Nicaragua route Is 183.;0
miles and the Panama route 49.09
miles. '
The estimated eost of operating and
maintaining the Nicaragua canal an
Eually is S1.S50.000 greater than that
of the Panama canal. The' estimated
time for a deep draught vessel to pass
- through the Panama canal is tweivtv
hours and through the Nicaragua canal
thirty-three hours. The Nicaragua
.route, the report says, Is more advan
tageous for commerce save that orig
inating on the west coast of South
America. For the gulf ports the ad
vantage Is two days, and for most oi
the ports on the Atlantic and Paci?
one day. .The Nicaragua route is said
to be better for sailing vessels on ac
count of favoring, winds. Hygienic
conditions also favor Nicaragua. The
commission says the United states
should acquire control of a strip of
territory ten miles wide from sea to
sea- through which to build the cnnal.
The consent of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica must be obtained to construct the
canal, but the report says this i;ia:i
easily be secured. The concession"?
granted by the Colombian government
to the Panama Canal Co have many
years, to run and new concession can
not be granted the United States.
The report concludes as follows:
"After considering all the facts de
veloped by the investigations made by
the commission, the actual situation ns
it now stands, and having in view the
terms offered by the new, Panama
Canal Co. this commission is of the
opinion that the most practicable" and
feasible route for an Isthmian canal, to
be under the control, management and
ownership of the United States, is that
known as the Nicaragua. Toute."

that Fresiueni Kooseveic eviaenuy win
not allow himself to be carried away
by seusidess Chauvinists.
The Neus "Wiener Tageblatt dwells
on its "imperialistic character," add
ing: "There lives in America a spirit, as
aii 'appendant' to the Monroe doctrine
formula, of Europe for the Americans,
and this formula, although clad in the
most peaceful phrases, pervades the
message."
TheDeustche Volksblatt- declares
that the policy enuunciated must' ex
pand American production and there
fore "measures for the protection of
Austrian production are required by
the dictates of serf -preservation."
The Austrian Volks Zeltung believes
that the strength of the message lies
in the moderation of Its tone, adding:
"It speaks in the language of a strong
man who knows he requires no sonor
ous words to be heard."
The Neue Weiner Journal, also deal
ing with the power of ' the message,
recommends its close study, so as to
"find means, at the proper time, of
spoiling his game."
The Weiner Mergen Zeituhg, follow
ing similar lines, declares that the gov
ernments of all civilized states will
only too soon recognize the tremendous
danger that these measures constitute
for the' commercial policy of foreign
communities.

In the Midst of the Fight When Liber
als' Captured the City.
New York, Dee 4. The steamer
Fhunire arrived to-day from Colon,
! which port she left on November 20.
The Finance was at her clock at c-oiou
when the libefals captured that city,
and, according to her passengers, was
right in the path of the? fight. Said
one of them: "Many of the rifle bails
whistled over the ship, and while the
firing lasted we kept under cover. The
liberals, about 200 in number, came
down from the interior by train, hav
ing paid their fare as individuals, and
when they arrived In town began to
fire their rifles until they intimidated
the government authorities and soon
had control. They appointed civil on
cers to run the city. The United States
cruisers Machias and Marietta, which
were in the harbor, landed marines to
protect the property. Great excite
ment prevailed among the people on
Sunday morning, November 24, when
the government gunboat Pinzon ar
rived. Shortly after the gunboat ar
rived the foreign warships assembled
and boats passed between them.
Lengthy signals were also exchanged
between the Machias and the Ameri
can marines ashore. Later . it was
learned that the city would be bom
barded and the A-arious consuls wore
oilieially informed. People began to
leave the city and the war vessels and
other craft offered a refuge to families,
but it was learned later that the bom
bardment would not take place until
ithe foreign consuls could have oppor
tunity to get their people out. Just
before the Finance left'a train arrived
from Panama with 200 marines. Ahead
of the locomotive was an armored car
with two machine guns mounted and
flying the Stars and Stripes."
SUPERIOR COURT
COTTON EXCHANGE NEWS.
Liverpool, Dee 4 There was a large
attendance on the cotton exchange to
day and considerable excitement pre
vailed In consequence of the news
from New York regarding the govern
ment estimate of the "probable produc
tion of the cotton crop. Prices opened
twelve points above yesterdaj-'s clos
ing figures. During the morning the
excitement decreased and prices fluc
tuated,' "touching, one or two points
higher than the opening quotations.
Then they settled down, leaving the
market very steady. The official
prices issued at 12:30 p. m. showed val
ues to be from lOVz to 14 points above
yesterday's close. .
London, Dee 4. President Roose
velt's message to congress holds the
first place In the afternoon newspa
pers here to-day. The comment on it,
iiowever, differs little from that of the
morning papers. Strong, general ap-
- proval of the pronounement, which,
:is the St James Gazette says, "strikes
notea of conscious strength and assur
ed success," Is the pervading tone of
" the editorials.
"The spirited declaration for Mon
roeism will cause a flutter in Eu
rope!" say3 the Westminster Gazette,
which continues:
"If the kaiser is really of the opin
ion, as alleged, that 'the . American'
peril 13 the question of the future for
juurope.he will find confirmation in the
message. He will envy Secretary
Gage's sun!us of fifteen million
pound.? available for bulldin:? iron
clads or other purposes, for the Amer
ican rtoetriue backed bv the American
surplus means that many Europeans
ambitions in South America are lore
doomed to failure. We do not doubt
that it is the policy of this country if
- called uixtn to make a choice, to stand
by the United States In defense of the
doctrine. We are also an American
power and It was we who first sug
gested the idea."
After ndting that South America,
the only outlet for the surplus popula
tion of Europe, is largely in the pos
session of the corrnpt Spanish over
whom the United States throws its
aegis without guaranteeing good gov
ernment, the Westminster Gazette con
cludes: "It-la not easy to affirm this In the
interests of mankind, and when the
United States, after warning Europe
not to enter America, proceeds itself
to step out from the American conti
nent, even a theoretical defense Is dif
ficult. The situation has the germs
of an Immense controversy in the future."

Property at Corner of Bank and Porter
Streets in Litigation.
Judge Wheeler opened superior court
for business this forenoon at 10 o'clock.
The case of Clement Verzier et al-vs
Augustine Verzier Cohvard was taken
up. Attorney Cole appeared for the
defendant and the O'Neills and Durant
for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs ciaim
damages of 20,000, and the property
in dispute is -situated on the co;er of
Bank and Porter streets. The circum
stances of the ease appear to be these:
The defendant is sister of the Jilaln
tlffs. She was formerly Mrs Lecomte.
Her mother left her her property, which
amounted to about $4,000. It appeared
to have been agreed, at least so the
witnesses for the; plaintiffs testified,
that their uncle, Nicholas Verzior,
would leave his property to them and
also to the defendant. He went so far
in carrying out this alleged intention
as to go to D. H. Tierney's real estate
office one day to have the deeds draAvn
up and the property apportioned out as
he wished it to be after his death. But
he changed his mind and instead cf
leaving it to the plaintiffs, left it to the
defendant. Thereupon they set up that
it was left with the understanding that
she was to divide it among them, and
this, they say. she has not done. The
property is. said to be valued at $1G,U00.
The" defendant sets up that no such un
derstanding as the. plaintiffs' claim was
ever thought of, at least she had never
heard of it before this case was instituted.
LIVESTOCK ASSOCIATION.
WITHDRAWN TONNAGE DUES.
American Steamers May be Tlaeed on
Same Footing as Japan's.
Tacome, Wash, Dec 4. Oriental ad
vices state that the Russian authori
ties at Via divostock have .withdrawn
the new tonnage dues recently imposed
there on foreign vessels. Heretofore
all vessels have paid harbor charges
amounting to 30 copecks per last. In
October the Japanese steamship Y"am
ashiro Maru was compelled to pay
1,500 roubles as additional tonnage
dues before she was allowed to enter.
The amount was paid , under protest,
the Japanese consul being informed
that these charges were authorized by
the new Russian tariff.
The consul then demanded the Jap
anese vessels be declared exempt un
der a clause of the tariff exempting
vessels of all nations entitled to the
most favored nation treatment. The
Russian customs officers decided the
case in-Japans favor and the next
Japanese steamship to enter paid only
the usual charges.
According to dispatches received at
Yokohama a number of American ves
sels wei-e required to pa v the new
tonnage dues at the same time. It was
expected that the money would be re
turned and American steamers placed
on the same footing as those of Japan.

the delegates were enjoying the enter
tainment offered by the stock show

F. J. llagenbarth of Idaho read a
paper on 'The Adulteration of Wool."
He presented facts to show that wool
is adulterated and said that such adul
teration deprived the wool grower of
a much enlarged market, and was,
therefore, a material injury to his in
terests and called for prompt regula
tion. It was also to the interests of the
wool manufacturer that adulteration
should be curtailed. The public, he
said, did not demand the adulterated
stuff, but it was the clothier and the
cheap retailer and the bogus manufac
turer who beguiled the public into the
belief that it was buying all wool when
iu reality it .was buying shoddy and
cotton and paying all wool prices there
for, lie urged the passage of a bill ly
congress providing for the inspection
of woolen goods and shoddy and the
proper stamping of the same, a fine -)f
from $50 to $500 to be imposed for each
violation of the law by the manufac
turer, and-from $100 to $1,000 for a
dea'er who buys unstamped adulterated
cloth or sells It, in the piece or as cloth

When the elaborate plans that have
been formulated by the Company G
committee of arrangements have beeu
carried out, the friends of the com
pany will witness one of the biggest
events in the history of this popular
military body. These plans, while not
yet in complete working order, have

what may be expected on NeAV Year's
eve when the big ball takes place at
City hall. Charters, the decorator,
has been given carte blanche in the
matter of beautifying the old city hall
and he has mapped out some of . the
most novel decorations that have ever
been seen in this city. The Auditor
ium for the Elks' bazaar was his work
and it was pronounced excellent, but
he will go this one better, for he will
cover the interior of city hall from the
roof to the floor with the best decora
tions to be procured. . There will be
many novel features introduced at the

A. Gibson Cowell Gives His Opin
ion of Official Ballots and Other
Things Attorney Kellogg Says Re
publicans Have No Moral Right to
the Offices. - -
Judge Cowell's movement to over
throw the recent election may now be
said to be in full swing. Last evening
a copy of his petition to the superior
court to be installed as mayor of this
city, despite the voice of the people
in the late election declaring itself for
Edward G. Kilduff, was served upon
the latter. The next step in the mat
ter will take place next Monday, un
less counsel in the case decide other
wise, when those directly interested
will appear before Judge Wheeler in
the superior court in Bridgeport, one
party to ask for a hearing on the peti
tion and the other to oppose it. It will
also be asked at that hearing that the
ballot boxes that were used in the
third and fourth wards will be opened
and the ballots counted. Following is
a copy of Judge Cowell's petition:
To the Honoi'able George W. Wheeler,
a Judge of the superior court for
the State of Connecticut:
The petition of George H. Cowell of
the town of Waterbury, in the county
of New Haven, respectfully represents:
1. That at the last meeting of the
city of Waterbury for the election of
city officers, held in said city of Wa
terbury on the first Monday of Octo
ber, 1901, he was a candidate for may
or of said city, and at said election, -ay-
he verily believes, he received a suffi
cient number of votes legally cast in
said city for said office to elect him
mayor of said -city, for the term of
two years, commencing: the first Mon
day of January, 1902.
2. At the conclusion of said meet
ing, your. petitioner was not declared
elected to said office of mayor, but Ed
ward G. Kilduff of said city, whom
your petitioner verily believes did not
receive a sufficient number of the votes
legally cast for said office, Was de
clared elected mayor of said city of
Waterbury, for the term of two years
commencing the first Monday of Jan
uary, 1902.
3. The facts upon .which the claim
of the petitioner is founded are as fol
lows: -
(a) Your petitioner is informed and
believes, and therefore avers, that at
said meeting there were returned as
having been legally cast for the office
of mayor of said city:
Edward G. Kilduff, 4.111 votes,
George II. Cowell, 3.099 votes.
(b) Under the provisions of the
charter of the city of Waterbury, one
person and only one can be legally
elected and declared to be elected
mayor of the city of Waterbury for
any one term.
(c) At said meeting of the city of
Waterbury, there were more than 900
democratic ballots cast in the Third
and Fourth voting districts of said
city and counted for said Edward G.
Kilduff, which were illegal and Void
and which should not have been
counted. If said 00Q and more ballots
had not been counted and declared for
said Edward G. Kilduff, your petition
er would have been declared and elect
ed mayor of said city for the term of
two years commencing on the first
Monday of January, 1902.
(dj Over 700 of. said 900 and more
ballots which were cast in the Third
and Fourth volin districts of said
city, and counted for said Edward G.
Kilduff, were illegal and void, be
cause after the name of the party, to
wit,' after the name "Democratic,"
the word "for" was printed upon each
of said, 700. and more ballots contrary
to the provisions of Chapter 2G7 of the
Public Acts of 1S93.
Said 700 and more ballots were cast
in-violation of said act and do not con
form to its requirements because they
contained said word "for" after the
name of said party.
(c) Over 200 of said 900 aud more
ballots which were cast in said Third
and Fourth voting districts for sai.d
Edward G. Kilduff. were illegal and
void, because upon each of said bal
lots the names of the candidates for
aldermen were printed- in a different
order than the names of the same
candidates on the regular democratic
tickets and were so printed in order
that the same might be identified and
used to indicate who might have cast
the same.
Your petitioner therefore prays your
honor to inquire into, the facts herein
alleged, to hear the evidence which he
will present, and examine the ballots
deposited in the ballot boxes used in
said Third and Foruth voting districts
in said election as aforesaid at said
meeting, and on finding his represen
tations to be true, to grant him a cer
tificate under the seal of the court en
titling your petitioner to hold and ex
ercise the duties and powers of the
mayor of the. city of. Waterbury for
the term commencing on the first Mon
day of January, 1902, and to grant
such other and further relief as he
may be entitled to by the -statute in
such cases made and provided.
Aud your petitioner will ever pray.
Dated at Waterbury this 3rd day of
December, 1901.
GEORGE IT. COWELL.
By LUCIEN F. BURPEE,
His Attorney.
The following excerpt from the pub
lic acts of 1897 was shown Colonel
Burpee this forenoon. It refers to
matters like that in question and . is
section 24 chapter 194 page S94:
"And a copy of the finding and de
cision so certified by the judge of the
superior court, together with the de
cision of the supreme court of errors
on questons of. law so contained there
in, shall .be duly attested by the clerk
of the supreme court of errors and by
him transmitted to the secretary of
this state on or before the third Mon
day next succeeding such election."
From tnis it would appear that this
matter shall be decided on or before
a week troru next Monday, tho .lGth,
which will be the third Monday in
this month; that therefore all further
conjecture and bother will be disposed
of. But Colonel -Burpee does not think
so. He says this law refers to appeals
of another political nature, and that
hi all probability this controversy may
not be decided before next February.
He stated there would be no injunc
tions nor any interference. with Mayor
Kilduff taking office on the first Mon
day in January, as the law prescribes,
nor with any act of his administration
in case the courts find for Judge
Cowell, except possibly in the case of
appointments. These, naturally, would
undergo a change.
It seems to bo impossible to get a
republican of aiiy standing to say that
he approves of the action taken by
Judge Cowell with reference to the re
sult of the city election. Up to yes
terday prominent republicans laughed
at it and democrats who had; great
faith in Cowell's alleged rugged hon
esty and respect for the will of, his
fellow townsmen, when honestly ex
pressed, as it is admitted to have been
in this' case, ne-er looked at the ques
tion in a serious light. The strange
thing about it now is that an effort is
being made to have the public believe
that the big hearted judge, the soul of
honor, a man whom many made a
practice of pointing out as the embodi
ment of every thing that is noble in
man, didn't want the nomination for
the office of mayor and that he doesn't
care to take it anyway. It is said
that the bankers and . manufactur
ers behind him represent Interests that
Cowell could not afford to oppose and
that he was actually forced to take
action against Kilduff. This is, all
bosh. Judge Cowell is no baby aud
any attempt to hoodwink the people
by such a ghost story will fall far
short of the .mark. Whether they
mean what they say or not, it is cer
tain that republicans who have been
prominently identified with the party
for years and have always labored
zealously for the success of their tick
et, appear to be very much dissatis
fied at the course the head of the ticket
has taken and positively affirm that
the step was taken against the ex
pressed wish of all who had been con
sulted about the matter. Various
other reasons are being assigned for
the unexpected move, prominent
among them being Mayor KildufTs al
leged friendship towards the laboring
element and his stand oif the question
of taxation which looks towards 'the
listing of all property at its full value.
The mayor is beintr criticized because
he attended the plumbers' convention
held here some time ago and offered
the visiting delegates the freedom of
the city, but it should be remembered
that Mayor Kilduff went there on iuT
vitation of a committee, representing
that body and in so doing it does hot
seem that he did anything , but. what
any other man who might have , been
in his position would have been ex
pected to do under similar .circum
stances. '
But it is a question if there be any
truth in these statements. Most peo
ple lean to the belief that the .fight
has been started by the itch for office
on the part of Judge Cowell and a few
of his colleagues, and while it cannot
be charged that they are exceeding
their rights, still most people claim
that they are resorting to a rather
strange method to defeat the will of
the people.- The people! Oh, the
people be d d ! . . . Who's this said
that ? Oh, never mind; whoever he
was he voiced the sentiments of many
mortals when emolument or fancied
glory is in sight.
The people whom Judge Cowell
talked with about the "For" ballot on
and off since election were somewhat
surprised last night to learn that he
had taken the case into the courts.1 No
later than Monday Judge Cowell said
to a Democrat reporter that he did not
think the court Avould order the "F.r"
ballots thrown out, and added: "It
doesn't seem to rue that it would be
right to disfranchise a large .number
of citizens oii account of an accident
of that kind. For my own part, I
never was much lii favor of an official
ballot. Any system of voting. which
would give a citizen an opportunity to
cast his ballot in secret would satisfy
me. I shouldn't hinge on the size of
the ballot or the style of the type used.
So long as the voter hadn't been Inter
fered with his ballot should count, even
though it .were written on a piece of
brown paper."

Paradoxical Position of tha
Well Known Attorney.
MUST DEFEND THE DEMOCRATS
By Virtue of His Position as City At
torney As Chairman of the liepub
lican Town Committee Cowell Will
Expect His Support Attorney KeS
logg Has Already Taken: the Demo
eratic Side of the Question. i
John P. Kellogg is home after et
short visit to parts unknown. It H
said that Mr Kellogg got out, of town
some time ago in order to avoid hay
Ing anything to do with the electlou
muddle. The action taken by Judga
Cowell puts Mr Kellogg in a rather
delicate position. As city attorney it
will be his duty to defend Mayor Kil
duff, whom the people and board of al
dermen have-chosen to act as .mayor
for two years from and after January
1; 1902. but. how he can do this and at
the same time do full justice to h;
position as chairman of the repubJV
can town committee is something no
one seems to understand. . From tna
beginning Mr Kellogg showed a d!fcp.u
sition to be fair about the question,
and for this reason it is thought ihzt
he will not appear in the case at all. ,
Chairman Kellogg, when approached
on the "For" ballot question, said:
"They Ub! democrats) received
the necessary number of voten
to iusure their election, so
that their moral right to the position
has been established, and Judge Cow-,
ell nor any other candidate on our s di
could afford to force himself Into &u
office which the people gave to some
one else. For my part, I should strong
ly oppose any movement looking to
wards the contesting the right of thej
men to hold the positions which tVy
have beeu chosen to fill. If there were
a question as to the number of vote
or a hint that there had not been : a.
fair eouur, it would be different. But
there is not, and so long a UiU cannot
be shown I think it safe to state :linc
there Is no disposition on our part to
hold offices which the people hare
made' plain they did not intend, wo
should have at this time. The officers
declared elected have a moral right to.
the offices they ran for, and I. don't
wish to see them disturbed in them."
The republican Hartford Post ha1
the following to say about the, ballot
question:
"The 'For' ballots were cast in good
faith, aud there's no doubt about tha
intention of the voters. The illegally ,
represents no fraud either in the cast
ing or titer counting of the ballots. -am I
It Involves uothinar more than' a Wun

intelligence of the party leaders; T
throw out the ballots, however 1ech-
nically illegal they may le, would -l.s
to thwart the will of the people, to do
feat the purpose of the electors and tot
do a moral wrong to the man -behind!

and emoluments of office, wouldn't!
seriosuly think of elinibing Into powep
