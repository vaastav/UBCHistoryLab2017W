More About Star Route Trials.
Washington, December 5. The
preliminary examination of William
Dickson, foreman of the last Star
Route jury, began today. There
are two charges one of attempting
to improperly influence the Star
Route jury, and one of conspiracy
to illegal y obtain money Irom the
United States. The government
was repiesented by H. H. Wells.
Nearly all of the members of the
last Sur Route jury were present.
Several of the jurors testified to
Dick-on reading in the jury room
his now famous statement, in which
he asserted that he had been &y
proached by agents of tuo govern
ment A copy of this paper was put
in evidence. The defense interposed
stienuous objection to the aimiubion
of the copy and demanded the pro
duction of the original, but aittr
Judge Snell admitted the copy, the
defendant's attorney held up a paper
"wcich they said was the original
document and which they meant to
make use of themselves. Assistant
District Attorney Moore, who identi
fied and attested the copy of this
paper, stated that he had sealed up
the riginal and sent it with other
decuments in the case to the office
of Attorney General Brewster, and
haa not heard of it since until the
assertion of defendant's counsel to
day The jurors who testified to
Dickson's reading his paper, stated
that it hadno influence in shaping the
verJict, meaning thereby that those
wno voted against the conviction
had their minds already made up in
dependently of the evidence, and no
weight was attached to DickBon's
suuenient by the other jurors. One
ox these discredited Dickson's asser
tions at the time he first heard them,
whereupon Dicksoa "hoped Al--ghty
God might strike him dead
u the story was not true."
The counsel for the defense made
no effort to controvert the charge
that Dickson had read the paper as
charged, nor dispute that the effect
of Dickson's action was to vitiate
any verdict which might have been
arrived at, but held that the charge
at issue in the present trial was
a corrupt purpose on the part of
Dickson.

SENATE.
Wasington, December 5. The
President, pro tern., submitted a
communication from the Secretary of
the Treasury, transmitting the re
port of the National Board of Health.
Referred to the cdmmittee on epi
demic diseases.
Senator Sherman presented a pe
tition of the citizens of Ohio for the
passage of a bill to increase the
pensions to those who had lost an
arm or leg in the service.
Senator Ingalls presented several
similar petitions from citizens of
Kansas.
Bills were introduced as fols
lows:
By Senator Anthony : To prohibit
the use of the capitol for other than
the legitimate purposes. Referred to
the committee on public buildings
and grounds.
Senator Edmonds offered a resoi
lution instructing the committee on
judiciary to inquire and report by
bill, or otherwise, whether any
furthet legislation is necessary to
secure the title of the United States
to the National Soldier's Cemctry at
Arlington. He explained that this
was made necessary by the recent
decision of the Supreme Court in re
lation to the rights of General Lee,
The resolution was unanimously
agreed to.
At the close of the morning hour,
Senator Piatt called up his resolu
tion offered yesterday, askings the
Commissioner of Pensions to furn
ish certain information in reference
to the pension roll and the probable
effect upon it of the passage of the
pending bill to increase the pensions
uf persons who have lost an arm or
leg in the service or are suffering
from equivolent disabilities.
Senator Beck moved to amend by
further instructing the commissioner
without delaying, the information
culled for in the resolution to trans
mit, and also as soon as practicable
comp.ete the list of all persons borne
on the pension roll and claimants
for pensions, with their addresses
and the amounts of their pensions,
respectively, adopted.
The resolution as amended by
Senator Beck was then adopted.
At one o'clock the special order
bill to establish a nniform system of
bankruptcy throughout the United
States was taken up.
Senator Ingalls proceeded, at
great length; to explain and advo-.
cate the bill. He reviewed briefly
the three general bankruptcy laws
heretofore enacted in this country,
which, he said, were, in the foremost
part, slavish copies of preceding
English legislation, and costly and
unsatisfactory in practice, ine main
point to be considered in framing a
bankrupt law was whether the court
or creditors should control the dis
tribution of the estate. At the con
elusion of his remarks Senator In
galls submitted certain minor amend
ments agreed upon by the sub-corns
mittee, which were ordered printed.
The bill was debated by Senators
Edmunds, Hoar and Garland, and
then went over as unfinished busi
ness, and the Senate then took up
the calendar and passed several
bids.
The Senate held an executive ses
sion, which lasted only a few min
utes, and in which nothing was done
except to refer to the appropriate
committees the nominations received
to-day.
At 4 p. m. tue Senate adjourned.
HOUSE.
Washington, December 6. Mr.
Willis, of Kentucky, offered a reso
lution directing the committee on
civil service reform to inquire
whether, at the recent Congressional
election money was raised by as
sessment, or otherwise, from Federal
officeholders or employes for eleo
tion purposes; and, if so, by whom
and what amount was raised, and
how the same was collected and ex
pended; and whether such assess
ment was not in violation of the law;
also whether any Federal officeholder
or employe has been dismissed or
threatened with dismissal or de
privation of any right or privilege
oy reason of his refusal to pay any
assessment made upon .him, or was
otherwise interferred with.
Mr. Kasson objected to the pres
ent consideration of the resolution,
and it was referred to the committee
on civil service reform.
Mr. : Cress well, cf Wisconsin,
offered a resolution authorizing the
committee on appropriations to em
body in the postofiice appropriation
KNOXVILLE,
bill a clause reducing letter postage
to two cents. Adopted.
Mr. Kellogg, chairman of the com
mittee on ways and means, offered a
resolution for the distribution of the
President's message, and the House
proceeded, in. committee of the
whole, to the consideration.
A resolution was amended so that
the question of the Hawaiian treaty
was referred to the committee on
foreign affairs, instead of to that on
ways and meanp. The res lution'
was then reported back to the House
and adopted as amended.
The House then at 1:15 went into
committee of the whole, Mr. Waite,
of Connecticut, in the chair, on the
state of the Union.
The first bill to be considered was
one refunding to the State of Geor
gia the sum of $35,000 expended by
that State for the common defense
in 1777.
Mr. Holman opposed the bill, and
its passage was advocated by . Mr.
Turner and Mr. Blount, of Georgia,
who contended that the claim was a
just and equitable one.
Mr. Hiscock, of New York, moved
to strike out the enacting clause,
stating that he was opposed to any
bill 100 years old. -
Mr. Speer, of Georgia, conceded
that the claim was an old one, but
none the less a just claim, and re
peated actions of committees of the
House and Senate had attested its
justice. This great government, he
said, could not afford to plead statue
of limitations.
Mr. Singleton, of Illinois, in
quired whether, as a legal proposi
tion, the Federal treasury had not
been discharged from any obligation
to that of Georgia by reason of that
State going into the rebellion.
Mr. Speer replied that he did not
think so.
Mr. Turner, of Georgia, gave a
detailed history of the claim, which
he argued was of such a character
that it Bhould have been paid upon
presentation.
After some discussion upon a
point of order, the committee de
cided that the motion to strike out
the enacting clause was debatable.
Mr. Terner, of Georgia, was Bur
prised that within a few" years from
the celebration, of the centennial
anniversary of pie Declaration of
Independence, Congress should be
asked to refuse to pay to any State a
just claim for expenditures made in
securing that independence.
Mr. Singleton, of Illinois, said
that he was opposed, on general
principles, to bringing the exhumed
claims of a century, before Congress.
It seemed to him that there was
something in the idea that though
Georgia had aided in creating the
Union, she had also attempted to
destroy it, and that though she' had
expended money in securing the
Union, she had relinquished all
claim upon the treasury by with
drawing from the Union.
Mr. Ray, of New York, member of
the committee on claims, which re
ported the measure, stated that the
committee had been unanimous in
favor of the claim. , For one, he
would never vote to reject the claim
of any State which he believed to be
just and honest, notwithstanding
that the statute of limitations ought
to run against it.
Mr. Hiscock, of New York, read
an act of Congress providing
that the revolutionary claims of
the States must be prtsented
and settled prior to 1788. If Con
gress proposed to take any action in
this case it should open the doors
and allow all of the accounts be
tween the States and the general
government to be reopened. -
Mr. Blount, of Georgia, contended
that there were precedents for the
payment of revolutionary claims of
States. He said that the reason for
Georgia eing tardy in asking for
payment was that sue was careful
that no unjust claim should be pre
sented. Mr. Hewitt, of New York, said
that the claim of Georgia would
probably have been audited and al
lowed pryor to 1788, had 6he not
been careful to see that no unjust
claim should be brought forward.
The question was whether Georgia
should be punished for exercising
that care. He failed to find, after a
good deal of research, the prece
dents referred to by the gentleman
from Georgia, Mr. Blount, But he
had found that the government had
settled Revolutionary claims of in
dividuals. He contended that Con
gress should do as much justice to
a State as to an individual.
Mr. Hammond, of Georgia, thought
that it did not comport with the
dignity of the great United States
to plead the statute of limitation
against a claim which was indis
putably just and honest.
Mr. Holman, of Indiana, argued
that the debt of the people of Geor
gia to the United States for direct
taxation should be made a set-off
against the present claim of that
State.
Mr. Blount regretted that the
gentleman from Indiana (Holman)
alone should see fit to revive this
old tax question, when the people of
the North had provided that the tax
should not be collected.
Mr. McLlain, of Matyland thought
that when the gentleman from Indi
ana had been addressing himself to
the equites of the case, it might have
occurred to him that if the State of
Georgia were compelled to pay any
portion of the direct tax and other
Southern States were not, it would
be bad equity. Southern had not
been called on to pay war tax and
never would be. -
Another objection to the bill was
that presented by the gentleman
from Illinois, Mr. Singleton, and was
to the effect that having gone out of
the Union, Georgia had forfeited her
claim to the money paid to the Union
during the Revolutionary War If
there was any one point well settled
in law and American itatemanship, it
TENK: THURSDAY
was that no State ever did go out of
the Union. .
After further discussion the com
mittee . refused, 51 to 76, to strike
out the enacting clause.
The bill was then reported to the
House and it was passed ; yeas 96,
nays 80.
Mr. Steele, of Indiana, offered a
resolution directing the committee
on civil service reform to inquire
how much money was collected by
the campaign managers of Demo
cratic party from the Cobden Club
and from the Free Trade Club for
use in the election of 1882.
"Let it be adopted," cried several
Democrats, but Mr. Kasson objected
to its present consideration for the
same reason which prompted him to
object to Mr. Willis' resolution this
morning, that the committee had at
present as much work before it as it4
could accomplish.
Mr, Townsend, of Illinois, called
attention to the fact that objec
tion came from the Republican side,
and then the resolution was re
ferred. Mr. Kasson presented the vi ws of
the minority of the committee on
ways and means on the internal rev
enue bill. They were ordered
printed.
The minority report is signed by
Messrs. Kasson, DunnelL McKintry,
Haskell, Morrison and Russell. They
are of the opinion that so long
as it remains necessary to
collect any . portion of the
revenue of the government from in
ternal taxation. The two sources
which can best support imposition
of tax are distilled spirits and to
bacco. Messrs. Dunnell and Haskell also
filed a supplemental minority re
port in which they favor the aboli
tion of all internal revenue taxes
except those on malt and spirituous
liquors, tobacco, snuff and cigars.

Is Alum Poisonous I
Dr. Hall's Journal of Health, in a
recent issue, saj s.
"This question has caused a good
deal of discussion. Alum is used by
many bakers to whiten their bread,
enabling them to use an inferior
flour. It is more extensively em
ployed as a cheap substitute for
cream of tartar in . the manufacture
of baking powders. It has not been
considered immediately wangerous;
although if continued it induces dys
pepsia and obstinate constipation.
But the fact that many cases of pois
oning have occurred from baking
powders which contained alum, puts
the question in a more serious
aspect, and prudent people will exer
cise caution in the selection of
baking powders.
"Under what conditions, then,
doeB this, substance formerly used
only for mechanical or medical pur
poses become poisonous f They
are certainly obscure, and at present
we can only surmise what they may
be. We suspect that the cause ex
ists in the individual poisoned; some
peculiarity of the constitution pro
ducing a morbid change in the secre
tions of the stomach, with which the
alum combines and forms an active
poison; or the secretions may be
healthy but in unusual proportions,
and that these less or greater pro
portions, in combination with the
alum, constitute a poison.
"For example, two parts of mer
cury aad two parts of chlorine form
calomel, which is not poisonous; but
change the proportions to one part
of mercury and two parts of chlo
rine, and we get corrosive subline,
which is a deadly poison.
"Then, again, we know nothing of
the causes of constitutional peculi
arities. Why is it that one person
can eat ad kinds of green fruits and
vegetables with impunity, while the
same course might cost another in
dividual his life f One person can
handle poison ivy and sumac without
being in the least affected; another
is poisoned if he approaches to with
in ten feet of them. Out of a family
residing in a malarial district, some
of the members will suffer half the
year with fever and ague, while the
others will enjoy excellent health
during the entire year. Foods that
are wholesome to some pers
sons are actually poisonous
to others. This is especially
true of some kinds of fish. There is
no safety in taking alum into the
stomach, as it is shown to be always
injurious, and of ten dangerous. Bak
ing powders properly, compounded,
and containing pure cream of tartar
instead of alum, are more convenient
than yeast; and bread and pastry
made with them are just as whole
some, and far more palatable. We
are in entire sympathy with the
manufacturers of the Royal Baking
Powder who commenced and are
vigorously conducting the war
against the use of alum in baking
powders.
"Before committing ourselves,
however, we made tests of a suffi
cient numb r of baking powders to
satisfy ourselves that the substitu
tion of alum for cream of tartar in
their composition has not been over
estimated, while a careful examination
of the Royal Baking Powders con
firms our belief that Dr. Mott, the
Government Chemist, when he sin
gled out and commended this pow
der for its wholesomeness, did it
wholly in the interests of the public.
"We do not hesitate to say that
the Royal Baking Powder people de
serve the gratitude of the communi
ty whom they are endeavoring to
protect. ' , ; ,
"Will not some prominent manu
facturer of pure Candies followtheir
example, and expose the secrets of a
business that is doing untold mis
chief to little children!"

of the above symptoms attenjl the disease, but cases
have occurred wfien but few of them existed, yet
examination after death has shown the Liver to
have been extensively deranged.
Is should be oaed by aU persons, old and
young, whenever any oe the above
symptoms appear.
. Persons Traveling or Living in TJn
bealthy Localities, or taking a dose occasion
ally to keep the Liver in healthy action, will avoid
all Malaria, Bilious attacks, Dizziness, Nau
sea, Drowsiness, Depression of Spirits, etc. It
will invigorate tike a glass of wine, but is no in
toxicating beverage.
If Tou have eaten anything hard of
digestion, or feel heavy after meals, or sleep
less at night, take a dose and you wul be relieved.
Time and Doctors' Bills will be saved
by always keeping the Regulator
in the House!
For, whatever the ailment may be, a thoroughly
safe purgative, alterative and tonic can
never be out of place. The remedy is harmless
and does not Interfere with business or
pleasure.
IT 19 PURELY VEGETABLE,
And has all the power and efficacy of Calomel or
Quinine, without any of the injurious after effects.
A Governor's Testimony.
Simmons Liver Regulator has been in use in my
family for some time, and I am satisfied it is a
valuable addition to the medical science.
J. Giti Shobtkr, Governor of Ala.
Hon. Alexander H. Stephens, of Gsw,
says : Have derived some benefit from the use of
Simmons Liver Regulator, and wish to give it a
further trial.
"The only Thing that never fails to
Relieve." I have used many remedies for Dys-
Epsia, Liver Affection and Debility, but never
ve found anything to benefit me to the extent
Simmons Liver Regulator has. I sent from Min
nesota to Georgia for it, and would send further for
such a medicine, and would advise all who are sim
ilarly, affected to give it a trial as it seems the only
thing that never fails to relieve.
P. M. Janmsy, Minneapolis, Minn.
Dr. T. W. Mason says: From actual ex
yasrience in the use of Simmons Liver Regulator in
say practice I have been and am satisfied ts use
tad prescribe it as a purgative medicine.
