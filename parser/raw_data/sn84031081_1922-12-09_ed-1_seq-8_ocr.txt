THE GOVERNMENT
FALLACY
Speaking before the Illinois Bar Asso
ciation recently, U. W. Hooper, Chairman
of the United States Kailroad Labor
Board, said that many railway union
leaders are waging warfare against the
roads for the purpose of destroying in
dustry and promoting a political cam
paign for government ownership.
If the purpose of the agitators whose
chief occupation it is to foment discord
nmontr the workers were nothing more
than this, the question of government;
ownership could be determined upon its
merits. The country has had a sufficient
dose of government control of public;
uHIilies to enable it to pass intelligently;
upon the question and there can be no;uon for the feiiow who could blow his nose in
,lm.hr that an almost unanimous opinion i church loud enough to Urown out the minister's
would defeat such a project. What lends sermon
sn sinister an asnect to these activities is ;
not their avowed, but their hidden pur-;
pose, and that is to destroy industry. It j
is not the end but the method which is,
obnoxious t6 right thinking people. Force j
and sabotage are substituted for reason, f
And the deplorable part of it all is that j
there is no general discontent or unrest'
among the rank and file

comnlains when it has cause
It flere foolhardy not to recognize in
the present tendency a clear purpose on
the part of a group of malcontents to sub
stitute for the orderly processes of law
and order a form of government under
which they may enforce their own de
structive rule. The plan is simply in
keeping with a confiscatory tendency
which has been taking place for years.
It ignores every fundamental economic
law by demanding an equal, though not
equitable, distribution of wealth among
employees. It ignores the fact that with
out capital and its genius for organiza
tion and management labor flould be
without a market, it does not take into
account that one capitalist creates em
ployment for thousands of laborers, thus
giving the laborer a market for his
manual skill and labor.
Under the gradual development of our
industrial system a hundred times as
many people are today actively interested
in the management of industries as
there -were twenty-five years ago. This is
the result of the incentive offered by pri
vate capital and private enterprise. Ex
perience has shown that under govern
ment ownership both incentive and enter
prise are destroyed.
While there has been an endless chain
of propaganda on the part of those who
would tear down the present system, there
is a noticeable lack of education almg
constructive economic lines on the other
hand; and if workers who are now mis

A successful man is one who has tried, not

under tho burden, not merely stood off, looking on
giving advice and philosophizing on the situation.
The result of a man's work Is not the measure of
success. To go down with Uie ship In storm and

Summaries of the message failed

the market closed firm, little no

Heavier receipts had a bearish
