The President of the United
States will soon issue a procla

the election in Utah. The date
of the rjroclamatioa will be the
birthday of the new State, which
will then be declared admitted
by Congress into the Union. The
Utah commission has yet to cer
tify to the President an official
report of the balloting, and be
fore declaring the result the
President must ascertain that all
the provisions of the act for the

him. When thev arose McGer-

Protection for Christians.
New York, Dec. 2. The Duke
of Westminister, according to a
letter just received by the Ar

star to the flag for the new State persecuted Christians in Turkey
of Utah will be placed in . "Old
Glory" on July 4, 1896, The
law provides that such additions
shall take effect on the 4th day
of July next succeeding the ad
mission of a State. Orders have
been issued by the Secretary of
War to the contractors who
make flags for the army to put
forty-five stars in all bunting
hereafter. They are not to be
used, however, until the celebra
tion of the anniversary of Amer
ican Independence. According
to the general understanding,
Utah will send a Gentile and a
Mormon to the United States
Senate as Republican represen
tatives. This would have been
the case had the result been fa
vorable to the Democrats. The
leaders of both parties determ
ined upon the sectarian division
before the election.
This can best be done by ade
quate and effective European
control."
The Duke has written to the
Russian, French, Austrian, Ger
man and Italian Ambassadors in
London, begging them to ask
their respective governments to
co-operate with England.
The Duke of Westminister ex
presses the hope that the Arn.e
nian Association will not fail to
represent to President Cleveland
the ardent desire of all wbo are
working for the Armenians, that
the Uniced States Government
will not only seek to protect its
own subjects, but also those who
have been educated and trained
for useful occupations in the
schools and colleges of American
missions in Turkey,
The first day's session of the
new House of Representatives
was chiefly devoted to organiza
tion and the drawing of the seats.
The nominees of the Republican
caucus were elected by the large
party majority, and with Thos.
B. Reed -for Speaker and the
Reed rules of the Fifty-first
Congress to govern the House it
will be the fault of the Republi
cans themselves if they do not
run things as they please.
Speaker Reed's speech upon as
sum in g the chair had the merit of
brevity, but outlined in advance
no policy for himself or his
party. Beyond the usual proms
ise of an impartial discharge of
his duties, and the usual request
for the cordial co-operation of
the members of the House, it
contained no sentence or word at
which political opponents could
take offense or over which parti
san friends could grow enthu
siastic. The organi7ation of yes
terday included only the princi
Cramps Want the Contract.
Henry W. Cramp, of the great
ship building firm,, returned
from New York last night and
confirmed the statement from
Wasnington that the William
Cramp and Sons Company had
submitted a bid to the Navy De -
partment agreeing to furnish
three battleships of the type of
the Indiana for the sum of $8,-
000.000. Mr. Cramp said that
the battleships were to be con
structed according to plans and
specifications, and the Philadel
phia firm agrees to furnish the
armor for two of the war vessels
giving the third without armor
to the government.
"Yes." he continued, "the
bids were opened at the Navy
Department at noon Saturday
Tee other bidders were the New
port News Company and the
Union Iron W orks of San Fran
cisco. We propose that the boats
shall be of 10,000 tons displace
ments, which is materially larger
than the battleship Indiana. In
fact, the published reports of our
bids submitted to the Navy De
partment are true."
