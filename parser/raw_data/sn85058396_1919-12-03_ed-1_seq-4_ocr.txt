Why content yourself with trying to patch up that in
tricate system? Why not go straight to the root of
the trouble find the tundamcntal cause of your dis
order and remedy it?
That's what Chiropractic adjustments are aimed at
the root of the trouble. Relieve, the nerve pressure
with its attendant ills. Chiropractic puts that delicate
mechanism in running order.
The X-Ray makes sure. Complete apparatus is in con

EVEN JAPAN IS DISTURBED.
When a country ns firmly anchored

Bolshevism, the statesmen of other
countries may well take alarm,
! Viscount Ishii, in a rceon- address,
j urged America to join with J;pan in
lighting back the forces uf the Bol-
! The spread of the doctrines of the
BolfhtMkl Is due to the upsetting er
iect of the war. There is not a part
of the world where uncertainly does
not prevail.
Prices of all commodities have crone
upward so rapidly that wages, in many
instances, have not kept pace, and. as
; a result, the wage earners express
their grievances in strikes, am' not a
few throw themselves into the arms
of the radicals who would break down
all industry and on the ru.nn . tteiupt
to build communes.
THE KAISER RESPONSIBLE.
Digging down Into the diplomatic
correspondence in the government ar
chives at Berlin, thoe at piesent in
power bave proved to ihe reicttstttfl
that the former kaiser not only want
ed war in ihe early days of July, 1914,
but rebuked those about him who
showed any disposition to avoid ihe
mighty clash at arms.
"What has happened lb the resolve
I to bring William Hohenzollern before
the bar of justice? With the signing
of the armistice, there was inuoh tolk
of a spetdy trial, but since then the
kaiser has- been undisturbed in his cas

A month ago, Rev An bur W. Moul

pleased that Rev. Moulton was not

conceal our satisfaction over the

ihe bishop-elect, in lighting his Hrs1

did In Lawrence, there Is no doubt as

CARLISLE'S CAPTURE.
After being at liberty -hreo weeks.
William Carlisle, the (Jhlon Pacific
train bandit, is back in custody.
It la well that no man of the bra

cause one success of that Kind might
have a bad effect on an army of youxfe
men to whom daring adventure would
have a strong appeal.
Carlisle displayed an egotism which
indicated a form of insanity. All he
lacked was a publicity agent to be con

When he bad reaped his pursuers
and had reached the desolate Laramie

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
In his message to congress yester
day. President Wilson made no rfrmn
mendations over which there could be
any great divergence of opinion based
jpurely on political lines. The recom
mendations included
Establishment of a budget system
for the national finances.
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem with simplification of the ncome
and excess profits.
I Readjustment of the tariff system; If
'necessary to meet changed world con
ditions and make the system conform-
with the fact that the United States
lis "the greatest capitalist m the
world."
Recognition and relief for veteran
soldiers of the world war particularly
m the way of governmen' f irms as
proposed by Secretary Lane.
Proper measures to foster the de
stuffs industry built up during the
war, to keep the United States lr.de-Ii-;id'-nl
nf foreign supph
An enlarged program for rural de
elopment, in recognition of Ihe farm

Measures which "will remove the
causes" of "political restlessness in
our body politic'
One paragraph in the president -message
runs parallel to the editor ial
tAtMnnnls nf Tlii. Slniiflaril r.n ffirr.ion
trade.and is as follows-
During the war America's ex
ports have been greatly stimulat
ed, and increased prices have in
creased their value. On the other
hand, she has purchased a large
proportion of the American secur
ities previously held abroad, has
loaned some $9,000,000,000 to for
eign governments, and has bulk
her own ships. Our favorable bal
ance of trade has thus been great
ly increased and Europe has
been deprived of the means of
meeting it heretofore exifting.
Europe can have only three ways
of meeting the favorable balance
of trade in peace times: By Im
ports into this country of gold or
of goods, or by establishing new
credits. Europe is in no po. ition
at the present time to ship goid to
us, nor could we contemplate large
further shipments of gold into
this country without concern The
time has nearly passed for inter
national governmental loans, and
it will take time to develop In
this country a market for foreign
securities. Anything, therefore,
which would tend to prevent for
eign countries from settling for
our exports by shipments of goods
Into this country could onlV have
the effect of preventing Ihem
from pajlng for our exports, and
. therefore of preventing the ex
ports from being made. The pro
ductivity of the country, greatly
stimulated by the war, must find
an outlet by exports to foreign
countries and any measures
taken to prevent imports will In
evitably curtail exports force cur
tailment of production, load the
banking machinery of the coun
try with credits to carry unsold
products and produce industrial
stagnation and unemployment. If
we want to sell, we must be pre
pared to buy Whatevei , therefore,
may have been our views uring
the period of growth of American
business concerning tariff legisla
tion, we must now adjust our owu
economic life to a changed condi
tion growing out of the fact that
American business is full grow n.
and that America is the greatest
capitalist in the world.

JAPANESE PICTURE BRIDES.
Dispatches of the early part of the
week told of a controversy in Califor
nia over the picture brides of the Jap
anese. What are picture brides''
The question Is answered .iy the
San Francisco Chronicle, which is rot
unfriendly to the brides. The Thron
icle says:
Since that holiday in Rome
When Romulus' young men solved
lh'' domestic problem by seizing
the Sabine maidens the cry of ev
ery' people living in a new land
has been for wives. Since th'- day
when the children of Benjamin
lay in wait in the vineya.ds by
tho highways from Bethel to
Shechem and every mqn caught
his wife from the daughters of
Shiloh, every womanless tribe has
been determined to repair the de
ficient by the best means that
offers.
Then why should not the Japan
ese In California want wives1
Thej are not, we see, attempting
either Roman wiles, or the meth
ods of Benjamin. They sen,l a pho
tograph back to Nippon, where a
Japanese maiden, duly selected by
ih'' family matebmaket s, weds 'he
portrait and thereupon Jou-neys
I'ross the sea to find at Angel is
land, with the help of the identi
fying picture, the mate of her soul.
She is a lawful wife, says tl e Jap
anese government, and our- ac
quiesces, recognizes as it does 'ha
marriage Institutions of other
countries so long as no harem is
involved.
We recall that early European
settlers in this and other land.,
suffered from the samo dearth of
lovely woman and made good the
lack by means not so different
after all. Shiploads of Priscillas
were freighted over to New Enrr
land to join John Aldenn they had
never seen. If anything, that
scheme was worse than the Jan
anese picture plan, it was 'he
.sheerest of matrimonial lotteries,
either party was buying an abso
lute pig in a poke. Can we doubt
that if photography had been in
vented then the Pilgrims would
not have used it?
The early settlers of Louisiana
received with cheers cargoes of
French girls, to whom they had
never been Introduced. California
pioneers can recall the time when
most any man here would have
been willing to marry a crayou
portrait of a woman of his race.
We find among a proportion of
the California Japanese a credit
itable spirit in relation to the pi. -ture
bride question If it jj cou
irary to American law, they say,
or even if it offends the American
idea of propriety and fitness, the
practice should be stopped This
is sound doctrine, and one that
goes far toward friendliness.
The problem, from the Ameri
can point of view, is wholly one of
the increase of Japanese popula
tion in this country. It is eco
nomic, not moral. We can hardly
dictate to the Japanese govern
ment that its picture marriage
institution is Illegal any more
than we can tell the French go
ernment that its requirement of a
clil marriage is unlawful. But
Americans are alarmed at the in
crease of Japanese as domestic
competitors. Japanese families are
prolific and a fear is abroad that
the result of the gentlemen's
agreement curtailing immigration
may he undone by swarming fami
lies reared on our soil. From
many points of view the ple'urc
bridr question is difficult. We do
not believe it is to be settled bj
brickbats or shouting, the move
ment among the Japanese them
selves seems to point an easlor
and better way. If they settle It
themselves it will be a proof of
friendliness that we cannot deny.
