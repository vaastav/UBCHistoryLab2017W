Dont Worry I
Not long before his death Genera
Neal Dow who wa nearly 07 year
old was asked the secret of hla long
I
life He eald It woa that he bad never
worried I
Similar remarks hare been made b
r other men who reached an advance
and happy old age
In this explanation there Is the es
sence of philosophy There Is no doubt
that worry drives many men and per
haps more women to premature
4 r i graves It is Impossible however for
some persons not to worry They are
r so constituted that the slightest trou
l t blet or even Inconvenience make
them miserable They fret over tmag
nary Ills as well as real ones Tin
t habit grows and its wearing effect
becomes worse constantly until th
physical frame weakens and breaks
I
under It
But the habit of worrying like an
other habit can be resisted with more I
or less success The battle against It
should begin early In life It should
be part of tile selfeducation of every
individual Natural tendencies can
often be checked and in many cases
entirely overcome
Wo have all seen persons who have
exceptional reasons for worrying ant I
I
yet were the gentlest and sweetest tem
pered of our acquaintances These
ji illustrations of selfconquest should be
e inspiring to us all Most of us are apt II
to look for trouble When things an
going reasonably well with us we wor I I
ry because they are no better When
there is no real trouble In sight we im
agine that there is plenty of It just be
yond the reach of our vision and make
ourselves unhappy without cause
It has been said that we suffer more
from dread of troubles that never
come than from any actual experience
Old General Dow has given us a
valuable hint and if we use it rightly
it will conduce to our comfort and hap
piness and to our prospects of long
life Atlanta Journal

had been lulled to sleep by the decla
ration of Spain that she would give
Cuba a semipolitical existence He
expressed the belief that the presi
dents neglect to take such action all

rank hypocrisy and a flagrant neg
lect of public duty which would be
corrected by the allruling power in
His own good time

marks Mr Hoar of Massachusetts

UGLY CHARGES MADE
Against Officials of Progress Loan Com
pany of Macon Ja
A very sensational amendment to
the original bill asking for a receiver
for the Progress Loan and Improve
ment company was filed at Macon Ga
Monday afternoon in the United States
court and was allowed by Judge
Emory Speer
This amendment charges that last
June a number of minority stockhold
ers not being satisfied with the appa
rent condition of their securities in
the company asked to be allowed to
make an inspection of the books but
that their request was peremptorily
refused but that after persuation
Messrs Gordon and Burke agreed to
tho naming an expert for the pur
pose of valuing the assets The mi
nority stockholders employed Mr T
Chestney to make tho examination
But the amendment says that the
only data submitted to Mr Ohestnej
were a ledger and memorandum cash
book commencing under date of May
11807 that he valued from the bal
ance on the ledger and cash book and
from their schedule of notes and deeds
exhibited
I It is charged that these books were
not the regular books of the company

I purpose of misleading Mr Chestney
as to the true condition of the business

and Burke were at that time conceal
ing the books showing the true condi

that she had no foreign policy Judging

now world is no more
burdens of diplomatic negotiations
than the old
In a document of pretentious
length mostly intended for Spanish
devised
consumption President McKinley
vised n spacious pretext for gaming

The Daily Mail says it is very sat
isfactory that President McKinley
comes out so strong against the Jin
goes the
The Daily Chronicle describes
message as weak and colorless It
The presidents comments on
says child
the currency issue ore positively
like in their simplicity It is safe to
prophesy that his treatment of the
Cuban question will be received with
a storm Tho annexation of Cuba
would be a deplorable mistake but
the reasons for refraining from that
course are not the milk and water ones
Mr McKinley advances
The Times says Its tone of pat
ronizing tolerance will make the mes
sage not wholly agreeable to Spain
Probably the president calculates that
if he can satisfy the jingoes for a time
with eloquent denunciations and warn
ings he will find it easier to pursue a
moderate policy
The Standard says UIf Mr McKin
ley represents anything so far it is the
new tariff which is confessedly a pal
pable failure The whole currency
plan hangs upon the condition of an
exchequer surplus but when will that
happy day arrive
The Daily News says the message is
characterized by a desire to displease
nobody

SLEEP AFTER EATING

upon experiments upon two
series of

analyzed
The normal stomach acts upon Its

Contents In this manner subjecting every parti

cle to the action of the
The above mentioned Investigator
found as the result of his experiment
that the constant effect of sleep Is to
weaken the churning movements of
the stomach while the acid quality of
the digestive Juices Is at the same time
Increased
On the other band he foundwhat
Is quite as Interesting that simple re
pose In a horizontal position stimu
lated the motions of the stomach with
out increasing the acidity of Its Juices
The conclusion reached by this ex
perimenter was that while a recumbent
position after eating Is not to be re
garded as harmful one should be cau
tious about sleeping directly after a
meal Especially should this caution
be observed In cases where there Is an
overacldlty ot the digestive fluids
When all Is said however the above
experiment proves little more than
that In such matters each person Is a
law unto himself that the after dinner
nap differs In no respect from other
habits which can be Indulged in with
Impunity by some while they work
I havoc with the health and happiness
of others Rest after eating Is cer
tainly beneficial both from a rational
and a physiological standpoint
Whether sleep can be advantageously
Indulged In Is a question that must be
determined by the Individual himself
by careful experiment
