Posmon or thb Hon. John U. Breckinridge.
There appears to be considerable interest manifested
by a portion of the press to know the views of Mr.
Breckinridge in relation to the present crisis.. The
Lexington (Ky.,1 Statesman, a democratic journal
published at the home of Mr Breckinridge, and his
enthusiastic supporter during the late Presidential
contest, has defined his position in the following
editorial remarks :
There is as yet no just cause for revolution or dis
solution. The Union commands our cordial allegi
ance : to it we shall be loyal until its basis, the con
stitution, has been actually destroyed. Kentucky
will not surrender the Union. Our people are as
gallant and spirited defenders of their rights, and as
little disposed to submit to. wrong and dishonor as
any men who tread the soil of America. They will
not permit themselves to be degraded nor their rights
invaded ,' but they do not believe the time has come
for revolution, and will yet cling to tne union wun
the devotion of the true sons of 76. To our South
ern friends we would earnestly appeal to await the
full development of Lincoln's policy before striking
the fatal blow to the Union. Kentucky is a border
State, and. as such, the first and greatest sufferer
by abolition ascendancy. Our State is a barrier of
protection to the cotton States against anti-slavery
aggressions. Our mends in the bourn can certainly
bear the administration of . Lincoln as long as we
can. Then let them heed the voice of Kentucky,
stand true to the Union and not exhaust all hope of
yet maintaining the constitution. ' The democracy
of Kentucky those men who, in the support of Mr.
Breckinridge have given earnest of their fidelity fo
the rights of the South will appeal to the boutn
to give up whatever movements are bow-in con
templation, and, like patriots, uphold the consti
tution and the Union. Do this, and all may yet be
wall: -

. The President's Message. '
We lay before our readers to-day that portion of
the President's Message -which relates to slavery and
the Union. . ;
The message was looked for with deep interest
The extremists of bolhjsections' appear to be dis
pleased with it,wbile in the main it receives the
cordial approval of conservative men in all portions
of the country. Wo consider it one of the ablest
and noblest dor uruents of tho kind ever penned.
Mr. Buchanar. has discharged hi duty. Let the
conservative 'and patriotic in all sections perform'
theirs, and the Union may yet be saved. r
Debate in the Senate.
A higl dy interesting discussion took place in the
Senate on Thursday last, between Hon. Bedford
Brown and W. W. Avery, Esq., on the presentation
by tb.e latter of some resolutions adopted by a por
tion of his constituents, on the state of the country.
CoL Brown took high and strong Constitutional
Union ground, and enforced his views with great
ability and eloquence. Mr. Avery in bis reply took
ground for immediate dUtolution. He said that
the time for dissolving the Union had arrived, and
that he was for it to-day I
Both gentlemen sustained themselves well in the
discussion; but without intending to refer to tho
personal portions of the discussion, we must say
that Col. Brown achieved a signal victory. The old
Jdtkson fire burned through all his remarks. It
was indeed a proud triumph for the Constitution
and the Union over secession and disunion. We
trust Col. Brown will prepare his speech on the oc
casion for publication.
Mr. Avery spoke very confidently of the senti
ments of his constituents on the subject of disunion.
He said they were for it by a largo majority. Now,
we have before us a letter from one of the most re
liable and intelligent Democrats in McDowell, who
says : " The people are not prepared for disunion ;
and if the question should be submitted to the peo
ple of McDowell, they vouldrollyp at least Jour to
one againtt it."
We shall allude to this debate again hereafter.
Mr. Ctlngman's Speech.
We have carefully read the speech of Mr. Cling
man, delivered in the Senate immediately after the
President's message had been read ; and we regret
to say there is much in the tone and sentiments of
the speech which we cannot approve.
Mr. Clingman has evidently despaired of the Re
public. He evidently tpproves of the course which
South-Carolina is pursuing. His speech is rather a
disunion than a Constitutional Union speech. We
do not believe he has spoken the sentiments of the
people of this State. A large majority of them are
opposed to dissolution for existing causes. They
have not yet despaired of the Union, nor will they
abandon it because South-Carolina has thought pro
per to do so.
We stand by President Buchanan and the senti
ments he has uttered in his message.
Mr. Clingman's speech shall appear in the Stand
ard as 6 con as we can find room for it.
52f The indications at the North are much more
cheering than they have heretofore been. Many of
the leading Repub'ican papers are lowering their
tone, and appea jo be willing to do justice to the
South. The John Brownites in Boston attempted a
few evenings since to hold a meeting, whereupon
the Union men assembled, drove them from the hall,
and passed with great enthusiam a series of strong
Union resolutions. Fred Douglas and his associates
who were present were "hustled out" and severely
handled.
Let the Constitutional Union men of the South
stand firm. There is hope yet Let us save the
Union, if we can. In the name of the most precious
interests for the sake of posterity in the name o
God, let us not despair of the Republic 1
Threats or the Dictators. Mr. lverson, of
Georgia, in a speech in the Senate on the 5th, refer
ring to the action of the Southern States, said that
Texas was clogged by her Governor, Gen. Houston,
who refused to call a Convention ; and, said he, " if
he will not yield to the public sentiment some Texan
Brutus may arise to rid his country of this old
hoary -headed traitor." For shame I The friend of
Jackson and the founder cf Texan independence is
to be assassinated if he refuses to yield to the mad
designs of the disunionists 1 These are the men,
people of North Carolina, whom you are asked to
follow into the darkness of revolution and disunion.
State Stocks. North-Carolina State bonds were
6old in New York on the 5th at 82 cents in the dol
lar. Virginia bonds at 79.
We are requested to state that Mr. Gaither, of
Iredell, has been suddenly called home, in conse
quence of the illness of some member of his family.
' t3f Prof. Phillips, of Chapel Hill, will deliver
a lecture before the Young Men's Christian As
sociation of this City, Monday evening, the 10th
inst, at 7 o'clock in the Commons Hall.
Mr. Miller's Lectche. In compliance with a
pledge made to our citizens some months ago, Hen
ry W. Miller, Esq., of Raleigh, being in town on
professional business delivered his celebrated lecture
on the " Eighteenth Century " to a crowded and de
lighted audience in the Courthouse, on Wednesday
evening last Our citizens have seldom, if ever, en
joyed such a treat The interest of his subject, the
exceeding richness and beauty of his style, his fine
elocution and almost perfect manner, entranced his
audience during its entire delivery. When he came
to that portion in which he delineated the struggles
of our patriotic fathers for independence and placed
our Washington highest on the roll of fame, among
the heroes and sages o! the ' Eighteenth Century,"
the applause was deafening. - All eyes and hearts
seemed to be kindled with fresh lire at the mention
of his name, and we could not help contrasting the
patriotism of tbe audience, with the impetuous, reck
less ambition of those in the Republic, who would
tear down with ruthless hands the pillars of that
fabric, which Washington and his co-patriots erected
with bo much toil, sacrifice and blood. O! shall
it be that our noble country, our unparalleled Con
stitution, our glorious Union, shall be dissevered and
broken? Shall the glorious stars-and stripes no
longer float over us as a brave and united people?
God forbid it Washington (AT. C.) Dispatch.

' " . ;-!' WASBrsoToit,' Dec, 6, 186CX, :
Senate. A-lfr. "Slidell took "hia seat ' The Depart-
ruenC reports were presented by the Vce President"
Mr. Powell gave notice that he should introduce a
resolution, referring the President's Message to a
special committee. ' '.' - - ' '
Mr. Green offered a resolution yesterday, for the
committee on the Judiciary . to enquire into the ex
pediency of establishing an armed police force be
tween th free and slave States, for the better pro
tection of property, and the more efficient execution
of the fugitive-slave law. , Mr. Lane then took the
floor. He said he did not intend to make a speech,
but to consider the questions now. threatening the
Union, ' He would not discuss the mere election of
Lincoln, but by that election a platform has been
upheld In direct conflict with the Constitution, .
which denied the equality of the States. If his
election was according to the Constitution, it was a
violation of its spirit, and u tbe.'question could be
brought before the Supreme Court, he had no doubt
but the election of Lincoln would be deemed uncon
stitutional. ..- ;
Mr. Hale and others made some sneering remarks.
Mr. Lane proceeded to show that the nullification
laws must be repealed: new guarantees must be
given to preserve the Union.
Mr. Hale said it was his hope that the President s
message would have been one thing or another j but
one carefully reading that document could not findT
what the President did mean. The first portion
maintained that South-Carolina bad iust cause to
secede ; the second, she had no right to secede ; the
third, that the tinted btates had no right to prevent
secession. The President would not look thines in
the face. ' We must look to the ballot-box" 'or no
where, for the termination of difficulties : and If
South-Carolina rejected the ballot-lox, and was arm
ing herself, we must look the danger straight in the
face and prepare for maintaining the peace and put-
ling down slavery.
Messrs. lverson of Georgia, and Brown of Missis
sippi, indicated that their respective States would
leave the Union before the 4th of March. The
former gentleman said that the Republicans intended
to use their power to put down slavery, and the
bo nth intended to get out of the Union and nothing
under Heaven . would prevent her from doing so
peaceably if she could, forcibly if she must They
were preparing to tight for liberty and their rights
and honor. The enmity between the North and
the South was deeper than Hell. Separation was
the only means by which they could live peaceably.
When the time comes we will be prepared to meet
tho myriads of abolitionists of tho North.
Mr. Wigfall followed, in behalf of the South, in
an energetic strain. He believed the President's
message would precipitate the country into war, if
the measures recommended were carried out
Mr. Saulsbury followed. Ue said his State was
the first to adopt the Constitution, and would be
the last to do anything-tending to the sepa
ration of the States. When the Union is destroyed
by the madness of the extremists, it will be timo
enough for her to declare tho course she intends to
pursue.
The foregoing debate was of a very exciting
character, and transpired under a motion to print
the usual number of copies (10,000) of the Presi
dent's message. The Senate adjourned at half-past
2 o'clock.

message to a special committee of 13 was carried.
The Speaker of the House appointed the commit
tee of one from each State on the secession portion of

Four despatches from Washington in regard to

Warlile Proceedings in the South Carolina Legis-
lature.
Columbia, Dec. 5. During the debate in the Legis
lature, yesterday, establishing an Ordinance bureau,
Mr. Rhett said that there had been eight largest
sized Paixhan guns for several years in Charleston,
which may perhaps bo used in taking the forts in
the harbor.
Mr. Marshall said that the State had three hundred
and eighty-two companies of infantry ; fifty com
panies of cavalry ; eighteen companies of artillery,
and sixty-two of rifles, making 121 battalions, 66
regiments, 14 brigades and 5 divisions.
Mr. McGowan said that the total military force of
the State was 05,000 men.
. Business Stopped at Washington.
Washington, Dec. 6. The proceedings of Con
gress hare stopped all business. The stern resolu
tion on the part of the South to yield on any pro
posed compromise, and antagonism to the .North
daily increases. '
It is improbable that any public business of im
portance will be transacted until the all-absorbing
topic is settled cither for compromise of secession.
