tttorney tells the jury that it is better that
9 guilty men escape than one innocent man be
mjustly punished. Too many of the 99
ruilty ones escape. The 'reasonable doubt
is used too much as a pretext
clear those guilty of crime.
Every term of court there are guilty men turned
loose, who prey upon society, because of tha
moral cowardice of jurors. It "is no trouble to
secure an indictment, but the difficulty lies in
securing a verdict of guilty. Our modernized
sourts have becomes refugees for criminals.
This was not so under the early common-law
sourts of this country and of Great Britain. I

Vntll Attempt at Train Robbery on th
Southern Pacific The Sunset Limited
Was Held Vp The Uuards in the Ex
press Car Took a Hand in the Melee,
Killed the Leader of the Robbers and
Wounded Another as He Fled.
Desveb, Col., Dec 11. A special
from El Paso, Tex., says: Meager par
ticulars were received in this city late
Thursday night from San Simon, a
station just east of Willcox, Ariz., on
the Southern Pacific, of a train hold
up. Train No. 20, the Sunset limited, had
just left Stein's Pass, N. M near the
Arizona line, when the engineer noticed
a danger signal in front and immediate
ly applied the air brakes. No sooner was
the train brought to a stop than five
men stepped out from their hiding
place near the tracks, all heavily
armed. One covered the engineer and
fireman with his Winchester, while the
others gave their attention to the train
proper, more especially to the express
car, firing their guns in the air and
otherwise frightening the passengers.
At this point the guards in the ex
press car took a hand in the fusillade.
Thirty or forty shots are said to have
been fired by both sides. One Wells
Fargo guard, Jennings by name, suc
ceeded in killing Bobber Cullen, who
was nearest to the car, was who was
evidently the leader, for as soon as
the other robbers noticed his
body lying on the ground, they
lost courage and made a break for
their horses, but another bullet from
Jennings' Winchester evidently struck
one of the fleeing robbers, as he was
seen to fall, and was assisted out of
range by his comrades.
No express money was stolen, and
none of the passengers were hurt.
A NARROW ESCAPE.

Washington, Dec 11. Prof. Philip
R. Alger, one of the foremost ordnance
experts in the government service,
sustained an accident yesterday after
noon, while examining one of the new

fatal. A cartridge was accidentally
exploded while the gun was in the
hands of Prof. Alger. The bullet,
propelled by the big charge of
smokeless powder, struck the heavy
iron casing of a window and
smashed the half-inch iron, which
flew back in small fragments. Prof.
Alger was struck by several of the
pieces and received cuts, but the most
serious injury was caused by a piece of
metal which severed the temporal
artery. Only the presence of mind ol
Constructor Dashiell, who was him
self hit by some pieces of the iron, but
without injury, prevented what might
have been a fatal result, as he sprang
to the assistance of the professor and
held the wound tightly closed until
the surgeons arrived and stopped the
flow. Prof. Alger is now in no dan
ger. GREAT POST OFFICE ROBBERY.

DUN'S COMMERCIAL REVIEW.
The Opening of Congress Did Not Distort
Business Speculative Markets Stroager,
with Definite Improvement in All Pro
ductive Industries In the Usually Dull,
est Seasou or the Year as to New Or
dersFailures. New York, Dec 11. R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade says in its
issue of to-day:
The opening of congress, with the
annual message and reports, has not
disturbed business, as some predicted,
but all speculative markets are stronger
than a week ago. The productive in
dustries, even in the season usually
about the dullest of the year as to new
orders, met a definite improvement in
demand for important products, pre
sumably the fruit of a prevailing con
viction that new business will begin to
crowd the works after the new yeai
starts. '
The outward movement of wheal
and other products continues so heavy
that foreign exchange has fallen three
quarters of a cent, and instead of ex
ports of gold, which have marked De
cember in recent years, imports would
come if gold were wanted.
Securities are advancing with rea
son in the increased earnings of rail
ways, $47,085,801 for November on re
porting roads in the United States,
16.8 per cent, larger than last year and
5.9 larger than in 1893. A striking
comparison for five years shows that
in each of the last three months earn
ings have been greater than in any
previous year, with a larger increase
in November than in October or Sep
tember. The sudden rise in December wheat
at Chicago to 81.09 would do harm
were it not based on avowed contracts
to ship some millions of bushels tc
Europe. That fact and the continued
foreign demand in spite of such con
tracts, has helped a rise of 1 cents
here. Western receipts for the week
were 5,798,771 bushels against.3,691,374
last year: and Atlantic exports, includ
ing flour, 4,612,137, against 2,975,651
last year, and so great is the
foreign shortage that the outgo
of corn last year, far greater
than ever before, is again exceeded
3,313,086 for the week, against 3,055,780
a year ago, with the price nearly one
cent higher for the week. The reports
that the western supplies are running
low are discredited by receipts from
farms.
Cotton is a sixteenth stronger, in
spite of estimates running from 10,
100,000 to 11,000,000 bales by well
known authorities. A strike in En
glish mills is no longer threatened,
and the possibility of one at Fall. River
has little weight.
The demand for woolen goods has
clearly improved and more wool has
just been purchased abroad and is be
ing imported, the sales in domestic
markets having been for the past week
only 2,660,000 pounds at Boston, and in
two weeks, 11,050,400 pounds at the
three markets.
There is more demand for iron and
steel products in preparation for rail
way worlc, bridges and buildings next
year and on contracts for export,
including one for a government
bridge in Holland, others for bridges in
Japan, with large shipments of various
products to England and other coun
tries. Foreign contracts for 40,000
tons of rails are pending. In and
about New York bridge and building
contracts call for 25,000 tons, and Chi
cago works are figuring on numerous
contracts for 5,000 railway cars. The
formation of the American Steel and
Wire Co. is expected to strengthen
prices and causes some buying.
A sale of lake copper, said to be 10,
000,000 pounds, at 11 cents, so
strengthens the demand that 10.87 is
bid; but tin and lead are dull and
Epelter a shade lower, while future
contracts for tin plates have been
made at $2.90 per hundred pounds.
Connellsville coke production is 151,
100 tons weekly against 149,000 in
November, and no advance is now ex
pected above $1.50 for furnace coke
early next year.
Failures in the first week of Decem
ber were but $2,617,240 manufactur
ing $739,420, and trading $1,791,570.
Failures throughout the United
States for the week have been 81 S
against 380 last year and 29 in Canada
against 43 last year.
THE PACIFIC COAL TRUST.
Cnlted States Attorney Foot Directed U
Proceed Against the Coal Dealers' As
sociation of California.
Washington, Dec 11. The attorney
general yesterday directed United
States Attorney H. S. Foote at San
Francisco to file a bill in equity
against the Coal Dealers' association of
California for violation of the anti
trust law of July 2, 1890.
It is stated that the association is
composed of retail dealers of San
Francisco and has for its object the
control of the retail trade. The con
stitution and by-laws of the associa
tion, which have been under consid
eration in the department of justice
for some time, are said to disclose the
fact that the members are bound under
severe penalties not to sell coal at a
less price than is fixed by the associa
tion and otherwise to observe all of its
rules.
There are said to be other considera
tions imposed upon members which it
is alleged clearly bring the association
within the provisions of the law
against associations or combinations
formed with a view to the restraint of
trade or commerce.

Arrest and Confession of a OuUty Couple.
Paris, Dec. 11. The mystery of the
disappearance of a bank collector
named Lamare, a week ago, has been
explained by the arrest and confession
of a couple named Carrara, enga ged in
the business of growing mushrooms.
Lamare, on November K0, called on
the Carraras to collect some money,
when the latter hit him on the head
with a piece of iron, killed him and
hid the body until evening, when they
threw it into the furnace used for pre
paring mushrooms.
Lamare had 26,000 francs on his per
son at the time he was killed
THE STRUGGLE ENDED.
Mother McKinley Has Gone ta
Her Longr Homo.
Died Surrounded by Her Children She
Goes to Her Grave Honored and Mourned
by All the People of the Cnlted
States Sketch of Her Life.
Canton. O., Dec IS. Mrs. McKinley
passed from life at a few minutes past
two o'clock yesterday morning, with
all her children and other immediate
relatives at her bedside. She did not
suffer any in her last hours but grad
ually passed from the deep, palsied
sleep in which she has rested almost
constantly for the past ten days into
the sleep of death.
No word could be secured from the
house for some hours before the disso
lution. Knocks of reporters as well as -those
of telegraph messengers were
unanswered.
At 2:H5 an undertaker was sum
moned and the first publicity given to
the death.
The end was most beautiful in its
quiet and peacefulness. She seemed
to sleep so soundly that it was difficult
to tell whether she had yet breathed
her last. This condition lasted for-
a
THE LATE NANCY ALLISON M KINLEY
half an hour. There was no struggle.
She seemed to sleep her life away.
The president and all of her family
were by her side. There were no rec
ognitions, however. Her last con
eciousness was hours before her final
taking away.
At 3:30 a. m. the family, worn out,
with long watching, retired for the
first rest in the McKinley house for
te n long days and nights. The presi
dent's wife stood the strain better than
it was feared she might. The family
in their long vigils have all seemed to
have the great strength of the mother,
whose vitality at nearly 80 surpassed
the expectations of the doctors and de
layed the end for ten days that was.
expected in a few hours.
Sketch of the Life of Mother McKinley.
Mrs. McKinley was distinctively a home-loving
woman, and the two-story frame cottage
on West Tuscan was street in this t-lty, where
Bhe died and where she had lived for many
years, was dearer to her than any other spot
on earth. There she spent her declining days
with her daughter Helen and her grandchil
dren Grace and James McKinley, receiving oc
casional visits from her other children, seldom.
(joinK out except to church, where she could
be found every Sunday morning unless pre
vented by illness.
vv hile showing deep affection for her other
children she had followed the career of Wil

motherly admiration she watched him rise
from the position of prosecuting attorney of
his own county, by successive slaves to con
gressman, governor and finally to the presi
dency. During the memorable campaign of last
year for the nomination and afterwards for the
election, Mrs. McKinley was one of the
most interested observers. Sha was
always given the place of honor at the
home of her illustrious son, and on the day of
his nomination by the St. Louis convention she
heard the news as soon as he did. It was then
that William McKinley showed the deep love
he bore for his mother by kissing her as Suoa
as he bad received the announcment of the re
sult at St. Louis. All through the trying cam
paign that followed, she watched after her son
with deep Interest. She was a frequent caller at
his house and was greeted by mauy visiting
delegations of republicans.
Mother McKinley accompanied the president
to the inauguration, riding In a special train,
and remained la Washington until Mr. aad
Mrs. McKinley had bscoma nettled In their new
home. Then she returned to the Canton cot
tage with expressions of gratitude at getting
home once more.
