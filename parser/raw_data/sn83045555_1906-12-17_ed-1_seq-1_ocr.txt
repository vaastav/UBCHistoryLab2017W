DESERT LAND LAWS
The desert land act results so fro
caently In fraud and comparatively
leldom In making homes on the land
tilt It demands radical amendment
cat provision which permits assign

Cr Iso tho desert land law will con

lutt holders to got control of land and
wter on tho public domain by inde
fcnslblo means
The commutation clause of the home
Head act ervs In a majority ot cnses
ac
to defeat the purpose of the homestead
at Itself which Is to facilitate nettle
went and create homes In theory the
commutation clauso should assist tho
honest settler and doubtless In some
j cases It docs so Far moro often It sup
plks the means by which speculators

i am gravely concerned nt tho ex

raud under their present provisions
fir much nf this fraud the present
KM aro cnvily responsible there is
la ono way by which the fraudulent
kiulsltlon of theso land can bo defl
l Iy stopped and therefore I have
erected the secretary of the Interior to
LQI no patent to be Issued to public
bids under any law until by an ex
ijimtlov on tho ground actually In
appliance with that law hU been
bund to exist For
Forlhls purpose an

ihsuld be enabled to employ enough
Kitting experts to examine the validity

krtake the supervision and control ot

wiglng to tho United States The pres
lot coal law limiting the Individual
Istry to 100 acres puts a premium on
Ihud by making It Impoaalblu to de

WORKING CAPITAL FOR NATION

The money value of the national for

The stumpano value of the standing

together with tho tango and timber

TRANSFER OF THE NATIONAL

Tho national parks of the west arc
forested and they lie without exception
within or adjacent to national forest
reserves ivo yearn ago the latter
were transferred to tho car of tlio

INDIAN LANDS
Within or adjoining national forests
are considerable areas of Indian lands
of moro value under forest than for
any purpose I would aid greatly m
putting these lands to their best use
It the power to create national forests
by proclamation was extended to cover
them The Indian should bo paid tho
full nvlue of any land thus taken nor
such purposes from tho proceeds of the

Tho situation on tho open govern

Is still falling Range controversies In
many places are active And bitter anti

Is Indefensible from any point ot view
and It should ho ended
I recommend that a bill bo enacted
which will provide for government con

department of agriculture which alone
Is equipped for that work Such I bill
should Insure to each locality rules for
grazing specially adapted to Its needs
and should authorize the collection of
a reasonable grazing fee Abovo nil
tho rights of tho settler and home
maker should be absolutnly guaranteed
Much of the public land cnn only u
used to advantage for grazing when

done for thnt reason nnd also to pre

In tho month of November I visited
the Ithmus of Panama going over the
canal zone with consldjrabjf cajc i and
also visited the cltlei of Pannma nnd
Colon which aro not in tho zone or
under the United States Hag bu na
to which tho United States govern

Thc U S S Louisiana on which I
was anchored off Colon about half past
2 on Wednesday afternoon Nov 14
I camo aboard her after my stay on
shore at about half past t on Satur
day evening Nov 17 On Wednesday
afternoon und evening I received the
president of Panama and his suite anti
saw members ot the canal commission
and various other gentlemen perfecting
the arrangement for my visit so that
every hour that I Ins ashore could be
employed to advantage I was three
days ashore not 1 suillclent length of
time to allow of un exhaustive Investi
gation of the mlnutlai of the work of
any single department still less to pass
Judgment on the engineering problems
but enough to enable mo to get a clear
Idea of the salient features of the great
work and of tho progress that has been
made as lezards the sanitation of the
zone Colon anti Panama the caring
for the housing of tho employees and
the actual digging of the canal The
zone Is a narrow strip of land and It
can bo Inspected much ns one can In
spect 50 or 00 miles of a great ralroad
at the point whero It runs through
mountains or overcomes other natural
obstacles
I chose tho month of November for
my visit partly because I Is the raini
est month of the year the month In
which the work goes forward at tho
greatest disadvantage and one of th
two months which the medical depart
ment ot the French canal company
found most unhealthy
FIRST DAY ASHORE
h Thursday morning we landed at
aboutihalfpast 7 and went slowly over
Ithf llneTpt the Panima railway end
lag lttnn expedition In I tug at tho
Paclflqientravice ot the cnnal out to the

canal will cease Wo took our dinner
at one of tho eating houses furnished
by the commission for the use nf the
governmciit employes no warning of
our coming being given I Inspected
the Aneon hospital going through vari
ous wards both for white patients and
for colored patients I Inspected por
tions of the constabulary zone police
examining the men Individually I nl
ro examined certain of tho schools nnd
saw the school children both white
and colored speaking with certain of
the teachers In the afternoon of this
day I was formally received In Pana
ma by President Matador who together
with the government ani 1 the people
of Panama treated mo with tho most
considerate courtesy for which I here
by extend my most earnest thanks I
was driven through Panama and In a
public square was formally received
and welcomed by the president and
other member of the government and
In the evening I attended I dinner
given by the president and a reception
which was also a government func
tion I also drove through the streets
of Pannma fir tho purpose of objcrv
Ing what had been done AVe slept
at the Hotel Tlvoll at Ancon which Is
on 1 hill directly outside of the city of
Panama but in tho zone
SECOND DAY
On Friday morning wo left the hotel
at 7 oclock and spent the entire day
going tluough the Culebrn cutthe spot
In which the most work will have to
bo done In any evenl We wrttchcd the
different steam shovels working we
saw tho drilling and blasting we saw
many of the dirt trains of tho two
different types used both carrying the
earth away from the steam shovels anal
dopoBltlngr It on the dumps nome of
the dumps being rim out In the Jungle
merely to get rid of tIne earth while In
other cnses they are being used for dou
ble tracking th runway and in pre
paring to build the great dams I vis
lied many of tho different villages In
specting thoroughly many different
buildings tho local receiving hospitals

white workmen live those In which the
unmarried colored workmen live also I
thi quarters of the white married em I

THIRD DAY I
On Saturday morning we started at
S oclock from the hotel Wo went
through the Cluebra cut stopping off
It s < e the marines and also to Inves
tigate c rtnln towns one of white
employes ns to which In certain re
spects compliilnt had been made to
me and another town whom I want
ed to sec certain haute of the colored
employes Wo went over the cite of
tho proposed Qdtun dam having on
the ilrst day inspected the Mtofo of
the proposed La Boca and Sosa dam
Wo went out on n little toy railway
to the reservoir which had been built
to supply tho people of Colon with
wnter for their houses There V took
lunch nt the engineers mess We then
went Jhrounh tho stores nnd ships of
Cristobal Inspecting carefully Iht
houfes of both the white and colored
employes married nnd unmarried to
gether with the other building
THE FRENCH COMPANY
At thu outlet I wish to pay n tri
bute to the amount of work done by
tho French Canal company und very
difficult circumstances Many of the
buildings they put Up were excellent
anal are Mill in u though naturally
the houses are now getting out n re
pair and aro being used as dwellings
1 r
1
only until other houses can bo built
anal much of tho work they did In tn j
Culobra cut and somo of the work they
did In digging has been of direct and
itnl betel This country has never
made ft bcttir Investment than th
IJelrlnvoflment
J40000000 which It paid to the
French company for work and better
ments Including especially tho Pana
ma railroad
rllroad
An Inspection on tho ground at the
height of the rainy season served to
convince 11 of the wisdom of Con
grew In refusing to adopt either 1
highlevel or 1 wcale canal There
seems to bo n universal agreement
among all people competent to judge
that the Panama route the ono actual
ly chosen IK much superior to both
the Nicaragua nnd Darlen routes
PRELIMINARY WORK BEING
DONE
Thc wisdom of the cnnnl manage
ment ho been shown In nothing moro
clearly than In the way In which tho
foundations of tho work havo been
laid To havo yielded to tie natural
Impatience of Illinformed outrider

SUCCESSFUL SANITATION
line Ilrst great problem to be solver
upon the solution of which the succesrt
v
uf the rest of the work depended was
the pioblem ot sanitation This was
from the outsut under the direction of
Dr W C OoreiW AVho la to be made
n full member of the commission If the
law aim to that comfdsltlOrr of his com
mission remains unchanged It must be
remembered that his work was not
mere sanitation as tho term Is under
stood In our ordinary municipal work
Throughout the zone and In tho two
cities of Panama und Colon In addi
tion to the sanitation work proper ho
has had to do all that work that tim
marina hospital service does as regards
the nation that the health department
officers do aivl
ncers In thu various states Inl
Cities and that Col Waring did In
Now York when ho cleaned Its streets
Tho results have been astounding The
isthmus had been a byword for deadly
unhealthfulncss Now niter two years
of our occupation the conditions OK re
gards sickness and the death rate com
pare favorably with jeasonably healthy
localities In the United States
HOSPITALS AND THEIR TREAT
MENT
I Inspected < ho largo hospitals at
Ancon and Colon which are excellent
examples of what troplcnl hospitals
should be I also Inspected the re
ceiving hospitals In various settle
ments I went through a number of the
wards In which the colored men ap
treated I number of those In which
the white men arc treated Americans
and Spaniards Both white men and
black men are treated exactly alike
and their treatment Is as rod as that
which could be obtained In our first
class hospitals at home
HEALTH SHOWING
Just at present the health showlng
on the Isthmus Is remarkably good
BO much better than In most sections of
the United States that I do not believe
that It can possibly continue nt quite
Its present average Thus early In that
present year I band of several hundred
Spaniards were brought to the Isthmus
as laborers nnd additions to their num
ber have been mado from time tl time
yet since their arrival In February last
but one ot tlioso Spaniards thus brought
over to work on the canal has died ot
disease and ho typhoid fever Two
others wore killed ono la I railroad
accident nnd one by 1 dynamite ex
plosion There has been for the lost
nix months n wel nigh steady decline
In the death rate for thg population ot
the zone this being largely due to tho
decrease In deaths from pneumonia
which has been the most fatal disease
on tho Isthmus In October there were
D9 deaths of every kind among the em
ployes of the Isthmus There wcro
then on the rolls CEOO whites seven
eighths ot them being Americans Of
these whites but two died a disease
and OB It happened neither man was
nn American Ot the 6000 whlto Amer
IcanA Including Home 1200 women and
chllldrcn not 1 single death has oc
cur led In the past three monthswhere
as In an average city In the United
States the number of deaths Cora sim
ilar number of people In that Into
would have been about 30 from disease
DIMINUTION OF MOSQUITOES
In Panama and Colon the death rate
has also been greatly reduced this be
ing directly due to the vigorous work of
tho special brlgado ot employes who
have been Inspecting houses wher the
Btegomyla mosulto IH to bo found and
destroying Its larvae and breeding
places and doing similar work In ex
terminating the malarial mosquitoes
In short In performing all kinds of
hygienic labor A little over a year
ago nil kinds ot mosquitoes Including
the two fatal species were numerous
about tho Culcbra cut In this cut
during last October every room of every
house was carefully examined mil on
ly two mosquitoes neither of them of
the two fatal species were found
PANAMA AND COLON
The sanitation work In tho cities of
Panama and Colon has been Just as
Important us In tho sonic Itself and In
many respects much more dlfllcultj be
cause It was necessary to deal with I
tho already existing population which
naturally had scant sympathy with
revolutionary changes tho value of
which they wero for n long time not
ohIo to perceive In Colon tho popu
lation consists largely of colored labor
ers who having come over from the
West Indies to work on tho canal
abandon tho work and either take to
the brush or lie Idlo In Colon Itself
thus peopling Colon with lie least de
slrablo among the Imported laborers
for the good nnd steady men of course
continue nt the work Yet astonishing
progress has been made In both cities
In Panama 50 per cent of the streets
that are to be paved at all are already
pnved with an excellent brick pave
ment laid In heavy concrete a few of
the streets being still In process of
paving Tho sewer and water B
In the city mare ot the most modern
hygienic type somo of the service hay
ing Just been completed
COLON WATER SUPPLY
I was not practicable with the force
at the commissions disposal and In
view of the need that the fore should
bo used In the larger town of Panama
to begin this work before early last
winter Water mains were then laid In
the town and water was furnished to
the people early In March trom a tem
porary reservoir This reservoir proved
poved
to bo ot Incufllclcnt capacity before the
end of titan dry season and the shortage
was made up by hauling water over
the Panama railroad no that there was
at all times an ample supply of the
very best water Since that time tho
new reservoir back of Mount Hope has
been practically completed I visited
this reservoir I Is a lao over a
mile long and half a mile broad I
now carries soma 500000000 gallons of
flrut class water
One of the most amusing a wellas
dishonest attacks made upon the com
minion wax In connection with this
reservoir Th writer In question usual
Iy confined himself to queSon general
mendacity but In this case he sped
fically stated that there was no water
In the vicinity fit for I reservoir I
drank I and It was excellent anal
that thin particular reservoir would
never hold water anyway Accompany
tag this message as I have said above

myself saw It and as I baa been in

COLON PAVEMENTS
I rode through the streets of Colon
s elng them at the height of than rain1
season after two days of almost un
exampled pourdown when they wero
at their very worst Taken as 1 whole
they wcto undoubtedly very had an bad
a Pennsylvania avenue in Washington
before Grants administration Front
streH Is already In thoroughly satlsfac
tory shape however Some of tht side
streets are also In good condition In
others the change In the strata Is rapid
ly going on
Complaint was made to me by an en
tirely reputable man as to tho character
of some of tho material used for
S0l0 mnterlli UIII re
pairing certain streets On Investigation
gation the complaint proved well found
cd but It also wcl
appeared thai the lisa
of the material In question had been
abandoned the commission after hav
lag trlW I In ono or two streets finding
It not appropriate nnlnl
The rctult of the Investigation of this
honest complaint was typical of what
occurred when I Investigated most of
the other honest comphlnts
hOltt made to
me That Is where the complaints were
not made wantonly or maliciously
they almost always proved due to fail
ure to appreciate tho fact that time wn
necessary In the creation anal rumple

UNJUST CRITICISM
Care nnd forethought have been ex
ercised by the commission and nothing
has reflected more credit upon them
than their refusal either to go ahead
too fast or to bj deterred by the fear
of criticism from not going ahead fast
enough It lx curious to note the fact
that many o the most severe critics of
soyer
the commission criticise them for pro
clely opposite reasons somo complain
lag bitterly that the wok Is not In a
more advanced condition while others
complain that It has been rushed with
such haste that there hal been insufll
dent preparation for InluC
preparntn the hygiene and
comfort of the employes As a matter
of would fact have neither been criticism Impossible In to mller go
quicker than the commission hu gone
for such quickness would have meant
insumclent preparation lnt
