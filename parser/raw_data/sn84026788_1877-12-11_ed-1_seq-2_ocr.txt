TVKSDAT HORSIXG, DECEMBER 11,1817.
THE PEESIDENT'S MESSAGE,
The message begins, naturally enough,
with a reference to tho policy adopted by the
President in reference to affairs in the South
ern States, and particularly to tho excellent
effects which have followed from tho policy
of non-interference and from the withdrawal
of the troops. In theso practical fruits of
his policy tho President finds his complete
vindication. Tho discontinuance of (he uso
of the army, he says, for ihe purposo of up
holding local government in two States of
the Union was no less a constitutional duty,
under the eirsumstancss, than it was necessary
for the restoration of local self-government
and the promotion of national harmony. The
result has been that tho fatal collisions be
tween the races which for several years had
bean of frequent occurrence, have almost en
tirely ecased, political turmoil and turbulaneo
have disappeared, useful industries have been
resumed, public crcdit in the South has been
{.really strengthened, and the benefits of a
revival of commerce between the sections are
more fully enjoyed.
Passing next to financial topics, the Presi
dent declares himself emphatically in favor
of the resumption of specie payments. '"Any
wavering in purposo or unsteadiness in meth
ods," he declares, "so far from avoiding or
reducing tho inconvenience inseparable from
tho transition from an irredeemable to re
deemable paper currency, would only fend to
increased and prolonged disturbance in val
ues, and unless retrieved must end in serious
disorder, dishonor and disaster in the finan
cial affairs of the government and the people."
Closely allied with the question of specie
resumption is that of the readjustment of our
coinage system by the rcmonetizit'.on of the
silver dollar, clothed by legislation with the
quality of a legal-tender to a greater or less
extent. This, the President reasons, would
properly be a matter of legislative discretion
and expediency solely, if it were not compli
cated by considerations growing out of the
existence or ihe public debt and tho obliga
tions of national honor. "The obligation of
the public faith," says the President, "trans
cends all questions of profit or public advan
tage otherwise." He therefore recommends
that in any legislation providing for a silver
coinage and imparting to it the quality of
legal-tender an exception bo made in favor
of tho public debt heretofore issued and now
outstanding, and which shall cot be paid,
principal or interest, in any coin of less
commercial value than the present goM coin
of tho conntry.
Apart from theso considerations of public
faith, as affecting the public creditor, the
President expresses his utter di>tiu:>t and
disbelief in any commercial ca=c or relief to
be obtained from the issue of a silver coiii
B20 as unlimited legal-tender. 1 nless tl.e
two conditions are realized ?first, of a near
approach to equality or commercial value be
tween the gold and silver coinage of tho
same denominations ; and sccond, of a limi
tation of the amounts for which silver is to
be a legal-tender, the President docs r.ot be.
lieve that both can long be kept in circula
tion. but that the cheaper currency wiil in
evitably drive out of circulation the dearer.
Without these conditions he "fears that oiiiy
mischief and misfortune would fljw from a
coinage of silver dollars with the quality of
unlimited legal-tender, even in private trans
actions."
The message next takes up tiio subject of
civil service reform. The President repeats
somewhat vaguely anil at length, the senti
ments expressed in his letter of acceptance
upon this subject, and concludes by recom
mending a revival of the commission ap
pointed hy his predecessor to digest ruies
for the regulation of the civil service of the
country.
The foreign relations of tl'.o United Slates
present nothing of special interest at this
time, not even in the caso of Mexico. The
President anticipates nn trouble growing out
of disturbances on the llio Grande, with nn
adequate military force on our side of the
river to prevent raids and punish outlaws.
A brief summary is given of the report of
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the sec
retary's recommendation that a lax cf ten
cents a pound on tea and two cents a pound
on coffoe should be imposed, in lieu of a
number of petty and annoying internal
revenue taxes which yield a less amount of
revenue, is concurred in.
The services rendered by the army last
summer, upon the application of the authori
ties of several Statas, in aid of the suppres
sion of domestic riots and disturbances, are
briefly alluded to.
The necessity for a change in the poiicy
of the government in the treatment of tho
Indians is forcibly presented. The acknowl
edgment is frankly made that many, if not
most of our Indian wars, have bad their
origin in broken pledges and acts of injus
tice on the part of our own people and gov
ernment, and the slow advanca made by tho
Indians in civilizatii n is largely, therefore,
our own fault. The passages of a law ad
mitting to the benefits of the homestead act
and the privilege of citizenship Indians who
may bo willing to sever their tribal rela
tions is recommended, as well as a more just
and humane policy generally in regard to
tbe Indians.
Tho closing recommendation of the mcssagOj
says the I3altimoro Sun, from which we con
denso the above, is cno which many persons
who may approve of almost everything clso
the message contains will find most difficulty
in approving. The President urges upon
Congress tho policy and tho duty of legisla
ting in aid of the States for the education of
tho whole people of the country. There arc
many persons who will not agreo with the
President in thinking that the wisdom and
necessity of such legislation is no longer a
question, but who will, on the contrary, in
sist that it is a matter much better left to ?
the States. j
VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE.
Tito Virginia Legislature met on Wednes
day last. Judgo Allen, ofShancndoah, re-ad
juster, was elccted Speaker of the IIousc, ho
being nominated in Conservative eaucas over
J. Marshall Hanger, by a veto of 52 to 40
Jno. Bell Bigger was elected Clerk, and
Mnj. IIill, of Albemarle, Sergant-at-arms.?
The message of Gov. Kemper is an able state
paper. Although he deplores tho passage of
iho funding bill, he says it is tho bounden
du'y of all to stand to the decision of tho
highest Stato court affirming its validity, and
iliat any futher agitation for tho purpose of
invalidating it is a wrong to the good name
of Virginia and an injury to every iutercstof
tho people ; and that if thoso who seek to
overthrow it fall short in any rcasonablo ef
fort to meet the just demands of creditors ; if
they fail to provide all tho means properly
available for that purpose ; if they refuse to
remedy the acknowledged defects of the pres
ent revenue system, then their inaction will
bo taken for repudiation, and all the jvorso be
cause it will bo negative, indirect, and insid
uous. In tho same connecton ho continues:
To say that a State may thus retract its
plighted fa'th and revoke its contract is to de
stroy tho sanctity of all contract-*, to put an
end to all confidence between man and man,
to overturn the foundations of public and
private credit, and to render the Government
powerless to raise loans and maintain its ex
istence in any time of emergency. Tho es
tablishment of a doctrine so monstrous would
bo the virtual dissolution of civilized society.
He recommends a curtailment of expenses
in every department of the State government,
and says the accounting business has run into
needless enlargement and complication,
and tho Capitol is overcrowed with unneces
sary officials and employees. IIo recom
mends the abolishment of tho present County
Court system of justices, originally appoint
ed and commissioned by tho Executive,
themselves filling vacancies in their own bodyi
and serving without pay.
congressionmTnews.
Both houses of Congress met at 10 o'clock
on tho 3d instant, and continued in session
until 11 50, A. M , when the presiding cfii
cers of each body formally announced the
final adjournment of the first < r extra session
of the Forty-fifth Congress. At noon both
houses were again called to order, and the
new session opened. Committees were ap
pointed to wait upon tho President, and
shortly afterwards liis annual message was
presented ami read.
On Friday a concurrent resolution was
adopted in both houses of Congress for the
adjournment of Congress front Saturday. De

The S. 0,. Tax Injunction Case. J
The books in the Auditor's office sliow that
j the county and di.-trict t*xes due from the
i 1? &? O. u It. Company lor the years from
! 1S72 to 1S7G inclusive are unpaid. The
; Auditor was about to certify these taxes to the
| Sheriffs for collcctiuu when the company ob
j taincd an injunction from the United States
Di.-trict Court enjoining; the Auditor and
prohibiting him from certifying these taxes.
A portion of these t-?ses for some of these
years have no doubt been paid and the com
pany is entitled to some credit.
The IJaitimore and Ohio Hiilroad Cora
pan}' allege, in their bill of injunction, that
1 they arc exempt from all taxation ? that, al
1 though they have paid taxes and have always
: paid the State tax, they have dune so under
protest.
j The ease presents several interest in c qnes
; tion.1, and the first which arises is?has the
United Stares Court jurisdiction ? It is
claimed by the State that the 15. & O. com
pany is not a foreign, but a domestic, home,
corporation ; that it received its charier from
the State of Virginia before the creation of
West Virginia, and that this State now sus
tains the same relation to the co^fcnny which
was heretofore sustained by Virgi^a. Should
this question be determined in favor of West
Virginia, the company must then suo in the
State courts. Should the decision be in fa
vor of the company and the injunction be
perpetuated the case will no doubt po to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
