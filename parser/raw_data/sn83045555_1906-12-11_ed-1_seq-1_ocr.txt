Bclilsmutlc organizations tomorrow

The scenes In some of tho churches
were extremely touching Not In years
had there been such an attendance at

especially lame and was noteworthy
as Indicating the religious Indifference
of tho male population Although
devenclghths the Inhabitant uf this
city are nominally Catholics In no
parts of the city weiu the churches
crowded Kvcn nt Notro Dame cath
edral where a Nolcmn high mass was
celebrated the cdllleo was only half

regular offices for tho week as Usual
without referring to their Illegal status
tomorrow Nevertheless tho depres

Many women emerged from the cath

trap of closing the churches and Car

strongly censured the placarding of ap
peals to tho clericals to make violent
resistance to the olllccrs
No violence he says but passive
resistance to thin unjust law after ex
hausting all protests at every step
This Is the disposition s far U the
higher ecclesiastics arc concerned but
their followers evidently have no In
tention to submit and aro preparing to
assume tho roll of martyrs noamlon

Cardinal Richard and many of the
bishops have already begun the re

episcopal mansions and tho clergy nro
preparing to leave their rectories and

nounced that time parish priests hat
received many offers of places In which
to hold religious services but there IR I
not tho slightest indication thafthoy

Tim tone of time Republican press

been done In Porto Rico for educa

proper has been put upon primary

thcro is a normal school an agricul

PORTO RICAN TROOPS

They are both of them bodies that re

Word Fm Boston Rimeivcd Today
A private dispatch from Boston to
day contained the Information that
tho directors of the Utah Consolidated
Mining company had decided to aban
don the emoltor now In operation tear
Murray nnd that when Manager
Channlng let for tho west n few days
ago ho carried with him Instructions
to look around for a new site and pur
chase It I was also stated In tho
message that tho company already
has no hess tlmn four locutions In vlow
but that the matter of selection has
been left entirely to Mr Channlng
Tho removal of lisa Utah Consol
dated plant from tho Salt Laka valley
Is tho direct result o tho mncltcr
smoko agitation started several years

junction of Judge John Marnlml of
tho federal court which If allowed
to become effective will Imposo auch
condition upon the smelting com
HUIIos that they will bo given tIme al
ternative of chasIng their
co8ln plants down
entirely or doing as tIme directors of
tho Ituh Consolidated Imvo chosen to
togo out of tho valley altogether
Manager Channlinr who returned
from tho east lust night was seen by
a representative of the News during
the day and asked If tho story from
Boston was correct and while he de
clared I was too early to discuss the
companys phns for the future yet
tho inference went out that thuro will
If an abandonment of tho Murray
plant during the present year nnd
that of court means tho building of
an rolnt entirely new one at coma other
Time Utah Consolidated or Highland
Boy smelter n It Is commonly called
went Into commission In the early
nineties and was thu ilrit plant built In
the Salt IUko valley for the exclusive

Krom time to time additions were built
and facllltlm provided until now from
sot to 1000 tons of mire from the com
panys Illngham mine are treated mid
the mutate extracted therefrom put Gum
In the tom of bullion That the mint
could supply a plant twice tho sIze of
the prosrnt one thfTo Is not the slight I
oat doubt and In all probability the new
nmeltcr will he built with thC view of
