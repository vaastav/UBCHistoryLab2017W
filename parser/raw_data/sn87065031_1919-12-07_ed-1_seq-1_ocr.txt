RADICALS SCORED
Peace Treaty To E Treated In
Separate Message; Also
Railroad Situa
tion. WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. General,
recommendations on legislation to
combat the cost of living, labor unrest,
nation to peace-time basis were the
features of President Wilson's annual
message to ccugress, delivered today.
The peace treaty, the president told
Congress, will be discussed in a separ
ate message later, as will the rail
road question.
For the second time only since the
president established the practice f
addressing Congress in person, his
message was read today by the clerks.
The president's principal recom
mendations were:
Establishment of a budget system j
for the natic.ial finances:
Reorganization of the taxation sys
tem with simplification of the in
come and excess profits.
Readjustment of the tariff system,
if necessary, to .meet changed World
conditions and make the system con
form with the fact that the United
States is the "greatest capitalist in j leerSi which convenes in Des Moines,
the world." ' J Iowa, from Dec. 31st to Jan. 4th.

An enlarged progra.a for rural de
velopment it .-txfrrritfca of the farm
ers' part in tho war.'
Measures "which will remove the
causes" of "political restlessness in
our body politic."
At this point the president made his
most extensive reference to the peace
treaty by saying the causes for the
unrest "are superficial, rather than
'deep-seated," and that they "arise
from or are connected with the fail
ure on the part of our government to
arrive speedily at a just and perman
ent peace, permitting returrt to nor
mal conditions from the transfusion
of radical theories from seething Eu
ropean centers, pending "such delay
from heartless profiteering result'ng
from the increase of the cost of living,
md, lastly, from the machinations of
passionate and malevolent agitators.
With the return to normal conditions
this unrest will rapidly disappear."
Radicals Are Scored.
The president renewed his recom
mendations for legislation to deal ef
fectively "with those persons who by
violent methods would abrogata our
time-tested institutions."
Several recommendations, some re
newals of previous ones, were made
by the president to bring down the!
cost of living.
Among them were extension of the
food control law to peace times for
the emergency; regulations for trans
portation of foods in interest of com
merce; a cold storage law, modeled
after the law iu New Jersey; a' law
requiring marks to show the length
of time foods are kept in storage, and
a law to "secure competitive selling
and prevent unconscionable profits"
by federal license of corporations
selling food in interstate commerce.
A large portion of the message was
devoted to a discussion of the condi
tion and' rights of labor.
Regarding Labor Unrest.
"A definite program to bring about
an improvement in the conditions of
labor," and bring about "a gemuine
democratization of industry," was rec
ommended. "The only way to keep men from
agitating against grievances is to re-; a majority. ... It makes little dif

Our Christmas Edition Next Sunday.
Taper supply, fuel supply and a few other elements entering into
the making of a newspaper permitting, our Christmas edition will
be issued on next Sunday. We had hoped to make it the biggest,
edition of a Columbus paper ever issued, but the short paper supply
renders it necessary to hold the number of pages to the minimum.
Therefore, nothing but live reading matter and live advertising will
be run. It will not be a padded page edition but every item in it
will be legitimate news or paid-for advertisbg. The usual plate
matter will be lacking and every item will be worth while.
Therefore only a limited amount of display advertising will bo ac
cepted. Already heavy contracts have been placed and if you
are going to make an effective appeal for your share of the holiday
trade it will be well to contract early and get your advertising ready
so that we may have the copy at the earliest moment.
The edition will cover this city and our entire trade territory
thoroughly. It will be all over this country twelve days before
Christmas. It will be the most effective bid for trade ever issued
in Columbus and no firm which expects to reap a holiday trade can
afford to be without it.
Money is plentiful. Business this Christmas will surpass anything
in volume ever witnessed here. Merchants will sell out that is if
they let the people know what they have and The Dispatch will en
able them to do this. Phone our advertising solicitors and they
will call and help you in preparing your copy.
