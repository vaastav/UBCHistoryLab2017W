WASHINGTON. Dec. .-Th war
department made public the first an
nual report of Major General Adna Ft.
Chaffee, military governor of the
Philippine Islands. Governor Chaffee
sums up the situation In the Philip
pines from a military point of view by
stating that the provinces of Batan,
s and Laguna, In Luzon, and the
Islands of Ha mar. Mlndora, Cebu and
Itohol, constitute the area now dis
turbed by any embodied force of In
urgents. He says that to the physical
character of the country, to the na
ture of the warfare or the rebels, who
are amlgo and foe In the selfsame
hour, to tbe humanity of the troops,
which Is taken advantage of by the
reln-ls .and the Inhabitants who sym
pathise with them, and to fear assas
sination on the part of the friendly
disposed if they give information to
jthe American forces. Is due the pro-
loiiation of the guerilla warfare.
Commenting upon the plan of gradu
ally replacing the military with the
civil administration. General Chaffee
says:
"With the withdrawal of Interference
with civil affairs does not contemplate
the withdrawal of troops from their
stations to anv considerable extent;
on the contrary, this should not be
done hastily, and when undertaken
should be gradual and more In the na
ture of concentration than reduction of
the force or abandonment of any con
siderable area of 'he territory. He,
therefore, recommends that there be
no further muterlal reduction of troops
before Janunry. 1!'3.
