Freedom of Speech Violated in Boston.
The leltf raph broutfbt new ol tb breaking
up of a meeting of John Brown spmpatlilsers,
who Ld gathered in Boston to calibrate the
anniversary of hi death. Y.'o are told tliat
tboie who were foremust in breuiiug up tbe
meeting were of "tbe highest respectability,'
men of wealth tad standing. And many north
ern journals coon te nance their acts, and stigma
tile the meeting as one of "dangerous fanat
ic." But what of thai? What if tbe movers
in the meeting were Abolitionists and Garri
tonitest ' Hova't they a right to freedom of
speech? And -who is to be the arbiter, who is
to decide whether or not a man t too fanati
cal to be allowed to hold to his own
views, and promulgate them too, if he cue
'taCueaee o'.hers - to become his follow
ers T These things are done in the South,
and we ail cry out against it as a wrong and
a tyranny , in hewmaeh does tne motive and
tbe principle aurer wnen put into prmcutw ia
the North T Suppose a meeting was called in
Cleveland, of ell whose sympathies were with
the secessionists of the South ; is there a de
cent Republican journal that would advise or
countenance any body of men, however "re
spectable" In breaking op that meeting by
force? And If freedom of speech is to be al
lowed to one, why not to all. "Whether the
meeting is uawise or not, affects not the prin
ciple of free speech. We care not whether
thi intruding party upon the meeting at Bos
ton was composed of millionaire or beggars;
it was a mob, and as such, deserving the ex
ecration of the whole Korth.
No Speech from Mr. Seward.
The Washington correspondent of
York Tribune writes that Mr. Seward will
make no speech immediately, and will submit
no proposition. All rumors to the contrary
an tntirely cnfounded. lie is in no manner
or form responsible for the various sugges
tions reccaily put forward in liferent news
papers, wtfci have been, suppo'eii reflect
his views, and was not consulted coLcerning,
or any way privy to, their publication. His
policy is to. watch the development of events,
and to direct them wisely ji the proper time
for peace and the preservation of the Union
Report the Secretary of the Interior.
The Secretary of the Interior has made a
full and interesting report Of the Public
Lands 12,000,033 acres have been disposed
of, 3,977,619 being sold for cash, yielding l2r
021,425; 2,065,023 have been absorbed un
der the railroad grants, and the rest in bounty
land warrants and the swamp grants. ' Over
a million of dollars has been expended in the
payments of pensions during the last year.
The income of tbe Patent Office has been
about $8,000 above its expenses j a, 6 96 pat
ents have been issued and 3,612 applications
rejected. T-e Census is so far advanced that
its aggregates can be prepared, for tbe present
Congress. ' The necessity of revising the laws
prohibiting the Slave-trade, especially in pro
Tiding for tbe disposal of rescued negroes, is
urged. . -
The Homestead Bill.
i At ths last session of Congress a Homes) ead
Bill, which did not directly donate tbe pub
lic lands, but required a payment of $10 for
160 acres, was reported by the Committee on
Agriculture and referred to the Committee
of the Whole. The motion was made to re
consider the vote, which motion was not dis
posed of before adjournment. ,
' On llonday last, at the opening of the ses
sion, Sir. Grow, of Pa, called np this motion.
On Wednesday, a motion to lay Mr. Grow's
motion o the the table was lost, 63 against
125, and the vote was reconsidered. After
slight discussion the bill pa3sed 133 to 76.
Whether the President will veto it remains to
be seen. Doubtless he will, if be can find a
possible excuse for so doing.

Southern Trade.
A prominent Cleveland bouse, engaged
largely In the produce commission trade with
Southern cities, and especially Savannah,
has, under the present state of afl'airs, de
clined to fill any further orders from that
city, unle ss accompanied by cash. We no
tice a Chicago firm has declined to fill an or
der from Simpbis for one thousand barrels
of flour and lour or five hundred barrels Of
provisions. The Southerners will, possibly,
find a difficulty in living without provisions,
if they continue in their present suicidal
course. ' .
A Young Mail Robber.
A transaction, or rather a series ef trans
actions, have come to light in Chicago, which
show that a young man named John Camp
bell, "a train boy on the Chicago, Burlingtoxi'
and Qalncy lUilroad, has carried eu a sys
tematic robbery of the mails in transporta
tion over Vuat road,nntil the amount of his
depredations reaches the sum of twelve thcnu
anddoUan.' Campbell is the son of Alexan
der Campbell, a retired clergyman of New
port, Mich. He , is "about twenty years of
age, and raa away from home some three
years since. He had been train boy for
about three months. ' He frequently lay up
on the pile of mail bags in the mail car, and
thus had too frequent opportunity of practic
ing his thefU. .
His manner of robbing tbe mails was to
select always one of the canvass sacks, in tni
common use, and as he lay upon the pile,
break up and crush apart the packages ltr
the bag, then slowly work tbem down to tb
mouth, where, by introducing a finger or
tvrc the letters would be drawn out. He
never opened a mail bag, and yet once ac
tually abstracted the entire contents of a bag
sent from Chicago to Quincy, leaving noth
but the wrapping paper and twine of the
package, within, to the great Mystificut ion
of the Post Office officials. . . .'.,
Campbell has been committed to jail ia
default of 55,000 bail. , ,

A Big Pile ot Money.
Near Rockport, Ind., is a coal mountain
which is now being worked by three firms,
whe produce coal of a very superior quality.
The Rock port Democrat thus estimates the
wealth of the mountain: '' .
Allowing the "knob" where ths mines are
worked to cover two sections of thirteen hun
dred acres of land, we have but a small part
of the area of the " knob.locality." A single
acre gives an area of over three thousand
square feet, and thirteen hundred acres of
over thirty-six millions. The average depth
of the vein exceeds five feet Mr. Stevenson's
vein being five feet and a half and at five
feet average we have a cubical quantity of
more (ban two hundred and eighty millions
of feet. One foot of coal makes one and a
fourth bushels in quantity, and the thirteen
hundred acres gives three hundred and thirty
millions of bushels. Allowing duly for coal
slack and waste, three hundred and thirty
millions of bushels, at eight cents per bushel,
amounts to over $26,000,000. .The county
of Spencer is now valued nt about $30,000,
000. '''
John G. Whittier on the Crisis.
John G. Whittier has written a letter to a
Republican meeting at Haverhill, Mass., in
which the following passages occur : .
"A great responsibility is laid upon us.
We must prove that we deserve our succes
by asking nothing of any class of our lellov
countryman, North or South, but what L
morally and legally right, and yielding to
nothing which is morally and legally wrong.
We must be firm, but not defiant ; we are too
strong in the right a d in our majorities to
answer railing with railing. We can afford
to be moderate and generous. With slavery
in tbe States we have no right to interfere,
and no desire to do so beyond the mild per
suasion of the successful example of freedom ;
but outside of state sovereignty, slavery has
no more legal right or constiiutional guaran
ty than polygamy out of Utah. Its home is
only in tbe States ; everywhere else it is an
outlaw.
"I cannot but regard the menace of disun
ion from the South as more l:kely to prove
mischievous than really dangerous. It may
do injury to the industrial and financial in
terests of tbe country, but the evil will work
its own cure. Business men at the South w ill
not long indulge in the childish folly of set
ting fire to the clothes on their backs, in the
expectation that their neighbor's fingers will
be scorched in putting it out. The clamor
that tbe Union should be dissolved, because
extensionists are out-voted, for the first time
in twenty years, is simply ludicrous. Jt is a
quarrel with the census tables and Greenleal 's
arithmetic; figure three complaining that it is
not equal to figure five."

A Pakthkh ik Nsw Yoax. Last Tuesday,
as a man was walkiog in the woods, about
eighteen miles northeast from Boonville, N.
Y., he suddenly came across on unwelcome
visitor, in the form of a large and savage
looking panther, which, as be approached a
pile of lumber, was discovered sitting upon
the further end of it. The man immediately
took off bis coat, flourished it violently, and
hallooed with all his uiixht. At this the
panther took bight, and disappeared in tbe
woods. The man then hurried on, but had
not proceeded a great dkt&nce before he again
saw his four-footed enemy, not many yards
in advance of him.. .Again b took off his
coat,- and shook it defiantly at the beast,
which again made tracks for the woods. The
man by this time become thoroughly alarmed,
and pursued his journey with all the haste
possible. . Knowing that ft house was not far
away, be made towards it swiftly. When
within sight of it, he turned and looked be
hind him, when lol the panther was stealths
ily following him, and at a distance of only
fifteen feet. His coat was agnin brought in
to requisition, and was shaken, as before, 1 ac
companied with loud cries. . This time, the
animal left with precipitation, and the man
hurried to the bouse.and upon reaching it, fell
to the floor with exhaustion. Union Tele-

TUNIS, Africa, Oct. 14, 1860.
His Highness, the Bey, went to Algiers to
meet the Emperor Napoleon on the occasion
of His Majesty's late visit to the French col
onies in Africa. The Emperor received Bis
Highness with great courtesy and respect,
and conferred upon him the grand cross of
the Legion of ilonor. Several thousand
mounted Arabs, in their costumes and equip
ments, went over to the Algerine territories
to assist at the military review which took
place during the Emperor's visit. About
50,000 Algerine Arab horsemen were also
present, and it is said that nerer before was
witnessed a more gorgeous display of Ara
bian magnificence, as regards costumes, hor
ses and horsemanship. The Bey's wife sent
the Bmperor rosary coaaposed of pearls and
diamonds of immense size, and worth over
$20,000. eTbis rosary has been fer nearly a
century a much valaed heir loom in the reign
ing family of this regency. It was once the
sacred relic of a Catholic convent on the coast
of Sicily, and was carried off from thence by
a renowned Barbary corsair at the pillnge of
tbe convent durisg the time of Hamuda Basha,
whose reign is looked back upon by the na
tives as the golden age of the country. The
symbol of Christianity came into tbe posses
sion of Hamuda Basha, and has ever, nntil
Litely, been the property of his royal descend
ants. It is now again restored to Christian
keeping, in tbe person of the Empress Euge
nie. The Bey's wife wrote a letter to the Em
press, and entreated the latter to remember
in her prayers her Mussulman sister. , .
First Babies.
somewhat extended observation, and a
solitary experience have convicted us ihat
first babies have a hard time. Parents must
have two or three children before ibey know
what a baby is, know bow to treat it and ac
quire patience to treat it properly. The poor
little fellows that' have the misfortune to
come along first, have to educate parents to
their task, and in the process they get spank
ed and abused. After a man has three or
four children, he learns that whipping a child
less than two:yeari of age is barbarism. We
know one "parental head , who struck his
first child when only six weeks old, the ass
actually believing that tbe child knew better
than to cry, and that he stopped crying at
that particular tin,e because he struck him.
We carry certain notions of children and fam
ily government into married life, and the first
child isthe victim, ot these notions. And not
alone of these, for the parents have not learn
ed Belf-control and a baby is whipped quite
as often because tbe parent is impatient or
angry, as because it is vicious or intractible.
We inflict on our first children the flogging
we ought to have for our impatience or fret
fulness." This pounding children before they
become, in God's eye, morally responsible be
ings, is very strange business. Patience, good
people unwearying patience I Don't, wait
to learn it until one of your little ones shall
be hidden under tbe daisies. Springfield Re

History of Telegraphs.
A writer in the New York Every Saturday
gives the following interesting facts:
Ths first telegraphic line of any importance
was established between the cities of Washing
ton and Baltimore, in 1841, having two insul
ated copper wires (covered with thread soaked
in resin, which answered simply the purpose
that one wire does now. The fact that one
wire, with each end connected to the earth,
was all that was nessessary to complete what
was termed electric current, was not at that
time established, it being considered that a
continuous metallic conductor was required
for practical purposes. .
It was soon discovered that iron wire, from
is strength, though not so good an electrical
conductor as copper, woUd be more service
able; consequently continuation of the line
from Baltimore to Philadelphia in 1846-7 was
constructed by running a three-ply iron wire,
and from that time every subsequent line has
been built of the same material, mostly galv
anized to prevent oxidation. In the year 1849
Alexander Bain, brought out to this country
from England a chemical telegraph, an ord
inary needle resting on a chemically prepared
piece of paper, which when the electric cur
rent passed through, decomposed and left a
dark blue stain, which by a simulor mechanic
cal arrangement to the Morse manipulator,
could be divided is to dots and dashes, a com
bination of which formed the characters rep
resenting the Roman alphabet. Some enter
prising gentleman (among whom was Henry
J. Rogers, Esq., of Baltimore, and with whom
tbe writer was) at once took hold of this new
system, secured a patent, and constructed a
line from Washington to New York; from the
latter place other parties continued east and
west It was on the line from Washington to
New Tork that the first under-waater wires
of any importance were successfully worked;
they wero covere d with gutta-percha, and
laid at tbe bottom of the Hudson Kiver from
Bull's ferry te the opposite shore, thence over
land into Wall street, the only obstacle at
that place being the anchorage of vessels, in
connection with which a very amusing inci
dent occured, which ended in a lawsuit.
No Pbateb rot Rsbklliom. Alluding to
the prayer offered by Rev. C. P. Gadston,at
Charleston, on raising ths Palmetto flng, a
correspondent of the New York Courier and
Enquirer relates the following:
" When young 1 lived in Hartford at the
time of tbe Hartford Convention and the
prayer of Mr. Gadston reminded me of the
Rev. Philander Chase, who was Presbyter of
Christ Church at that lime. Tbe first act of
tbe convention was the appointment of a
committee to wait on the rlerey ot tbe city,
inviting them to pray with the convention
alternately. They called on Drs. Strong and
lint, and the baptist clergyman, who an
swered afHrmatively. And then they called
on Mr. Chase. To appreciate bis answer you
should have seen the man rising, with his gi
gantic form, with a head like Gabriel's. He
said;
" Be pleased to bear my resects to the
President of ths convention, and any to him
the Church has furuisbed me with no form of
prayer countenancing rebellion."
This man bcaine Bishop of Ohio and Illi
nois, and founded two colleges.
Lola Montxz, A New York letter writer
says:
Another distinguished individual, Lola
Montez, has gone and made an ancboritess of
herself. Last summer she suffered very
much from a paralytic stroke, caused by
smoking cigarettes day and night. She
lived fora while with Buchanan, (not tbe old
public functionary at Washington,) Buchan
an the florist, at Astoria, and disappeared
from thence about a month ago, refusing to
give her next address to her most intimate
friends. She is now living on Seventeenth
street, spends her time in meditatioj and
prayer, and goes by the name of Fanny Gib
bons. Fact, I assure you.
MistaII or a Bishop. The Paris corres
pondent of the Boston Traveller writes
that:
Tbe Bishop of Pointers preached last week
the sermon of Mons. Guicquel, one of tie
Pope's volunteers; three days afterwards,
Mons. Guicquel called upon tha Bishop and
thanked him for the flattering manner in
whicu be had praised him ; it is unwise to be
in haste to bury even dead men.
