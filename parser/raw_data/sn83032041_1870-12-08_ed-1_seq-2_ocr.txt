Association of Pennsylvania, are requested to

A Constitutional Convention.
Ox Satardaj week last a epecial election
was held io the Raleigh. (North Carolina)
district, to supply a vacancy caused by the
death of JohnT.Pawces, Radical. Mannlog,
the Democratic candidate, was elected over
Ilolden, Radical, by about 600 rnajuity.
Holden is a sod of the present Radical Gov
ernor of the State. The election of Manning
is another Democratic gaio.
"Tij Tats.'' The first Dumber of a
new Democratic daily newspaper called The
Paper was issued In Pittsburgh on the 1st
inst. We have a copy of it before u. It
is a nir.e column sheet and is therefore of
the largest size. Its mechanical execution
is of the very highet-t order, and the whole
paper presents a decidedly winning and ele
gant appearance. Its editorial department
displays first class ability and will secure
for it a front rank among the leading Dem
ocratic papers of the country. We welcome
Hit Paper to our exchange list as an able
and influential auxiliary in tbe good cause.
Os Tuesday, the 29th of last month, the
Legislature of North Carolina elected Ex
Governor Zebulon B. Yence, Democrat, Uni
ted States Senator, as the successor of J. C.
Abbott, the present carpet-bag incumbent.
Mr. Vance is a native of his State and was
at one time a prominent representative in
Congress. This is the beginning of the dis
appearance from the Senate of a class of un
known and incompetent men who reached
high public station immediately after the
collapse of the rebellion. When the politi
cal cauldron boiled, the scum was sure to
rise to the surface. A more auspicious day
has now arrived.
Okk Mo&b. To the list of the surviving
members of the Reform Convention cf 1838,
which appeared in this paper two weeks
ago, the editor of the Indiana Democrat
adds the name of Walter Craig, of Washing
ton county, and Samuel A. Gilmore, now
President Judge of the Fayette and Greene
district. If Mr. Craig is living the Editor's
addition to our list is so far correct. Samuel
A. Gilmore, however, was not a member of
that convention, as the Editor will readily
ditcover by glancing over the signatures of
the delegates, which are appended to the
Constitution. At that time Judge Gilmore
resided in Butler, where he was born, but
the delegate from that county was Samuel
A. Pu'viance, who is now a member of the
Pittsburg Bar, and whore name appeared on
the list as published by us.
The Nkw York Would. We call the
attention of our readers to the prospectus of
this great, leading and influential Demo
cratic organ, which will be found in another
column. It is entirely unnecessary for us
to enlarge upon the great merits of the
World as a newspaper. It has a world wide
reputation and is confessed on all hands to
display more enterprise, energy and ability
in its management than any other journal
of either party in the United Stales. It is.
established on a firm and permanent basis
and bids fair id the future to surpass all its
great achievements in the past. The induce
ments which it holds out for the formation
of clubs are of the roost liberal character
and ought to commend themselves to the
favorable consideration of the Democracy in
very section of the country.
Mr. Morrell Declines to Contest.
The letter which we publish below was
addressed to a gentleman in Huntingdon
and appeared in last week's Journal of that
place. It will be seen that Mr. Morrell de
clines contesting Mr. Speer's seat in Con
gress. The letter is written in very good
taste, and reflects credit on its author. His
allusion to "scattered fraudulent votes, over
one hundred of which have been reported to
me," (Morrell,) is merely the usual plea
urged by almost every defeated Radical can
didate for Congress, whether the majority
against him is five, or Jive hundred. Mr.
Morrell, however, perfectly understands the
cause of his defeat, and frankly acknowledges
it when he says that he is "fully satisfied
that my (his) drfeat is due to the base treach
ery and debauchery of professed Republi
cans." Although this plain language is not
at all complircetitary to the party of "great
moral ideas,' it is nevertheless true, and is
specially intended for the benefit of Senator
John Scott's own county. Although Mr.
Morrell's political friends will doubtless re
gret to part with him, we cannot refrain
frcjn congratulating him, that the people of
the district seem to cave anticipated his
cherished desire, and have kindly afforded
him an e xcellsnt opportunity "to get out of
public life" r
JonjfSTOw., Pa., Nov. 18,1870.
JJt Deai Sib : Yours of the l?tb is re
ceived. I am sorry to disappoint mv iracy
good and true friends in and out of the district,
by declining to contest the seat with Mr. Speer,
bnt justice to isysell requires it-
Uy Laming op the scattered fraudulent votes,
rer one hundred of which have been reported
to me. I could doubtless xoska a successful
contest, bet being fully satisfied that my de
feat indeed anjibiDg abort of 1200 majority
iu the district is due to the base treachery
and debanchery of yrof cased Republicans. I
bould spurn to bold the seat at tbe cost of

get out of rublie life, and haw mo eh bt own

D. J. MORRELL.
Since the October election the newspaper
press of both pol ilical parties has been en
gaged in discussing the question of holding
a Convention for the purpose of altering and
amending the Constitution of the State. As
waa to be expected, a project of such vital
importance to the future welfare of the
people has many warm and enthusiastic ad
vocates, and not a few bitter and determined
opponents. The friends, however, of the
proposed convention, so far as we can gather
from our exchanges, seem Jo be greatly in
the preponderance. It is now thirty-two
years since the present Constitution was
adopted by a popular vote, and although it
was a vast improvement on the Constitution
of 1790. a strong impression has been made
on tbe public mind, that still further changes
in the organic law are imperatively demanded
for the certain and absolute preservation of
the threatened rights of the people. We
have long been impressed with the propriety
of holding such a convention, and the shame
less results of every session of the Legislature
have more and more coufirmed our convic
tions of its necessity. Unless some strong
and defensive barriers are interposed between
tbe people and the assumed omnipotence of
the Legislature, the rights of person and of
property in our State will all be gradually
absorbed by the legislative branch of the
government, and will exist ouly iu name.
The great and growing evil of the present
day is a surfeit of legislation, but particu
larly of special legislation, aad it is of this
feature in our legislation, more than any
thing else, that the people so loudly com
plain, and which has caused them to look
to a Constitutional Convention as their only
source of relief. Our annual ponderous vol
ume of tbe Acts of Assembly is an eloquent
commentary on tbe wisdom of the man who
said that "tbe world is governed too much."
There are many other subjects of great im
portance that would naturally present them
selves to the convention for its delibetate
action, one of which would be the mannei
of electing a State Treasurer. We cannot.
however, go into details on that or any of
the other questions, which would necessarily
force themselves cn the convention for its
ultimate decision.
Assuming, then, that popular sentiment
is in favor of holding a convention, the did.
cult question presents itself, how shall its
membeis be elected 1 On tbis subject there
exists a great conflict of cpiniou. It is per
fectly self-evident that a Constitutional Con
vention should not be a partisan body, but
an assembly or convocation of men repre
senting and acting for the entire body of the
people, and not merely for the interests and
advantage of anj-one political party. This
narrow and contracted view of the high
functions of such a convention would sink
the project into deserved contempt, and
ought therefoie to meet with no countenance.
If the party in power will insist that the
members of tbe convention shall be elected
under tho Senatorial and Representative ap
portionment bill of 1864, we are unalterably
opposed to the whole scheme. That was
the most unjust and infamous apportionment
that ever disgraced the Legislature of tbe
State. It is difficult to see how the majority
that voted for it can escape the charge of
moral perjury. Under its gerrymandering
provisions, several certain and reliable Dem
ocratic counties were unnaturally attached
to adjoining Radical counties giving larger
majorities, and their political influence was
thus neutralized and destroyed. In Phila
delphia, entitled to eighteen members of the
House, and where parties are nearly equally
divided, the districts were so formed as to
prevent the Democratic party from electing
more than five, or, at the most, six of the
whole number. No honest man would ad
vocate that bill as the basis on which to elect
delegates to a Constitutional Convention.
Both the political parties ought to be as
nearly equally represented in the convention
as possible, ihis was tbe complexion ot
tho convention that framed the present Con
stitution of New Jersey in 1843, and the
result was that it was almost unanimously
ratified by the people of that State. A sim
ilar arrangement could be easily effected in
Pennsylvania and with the Fame harmonious
result. We arc therefore in favor of a con.
vention constituted on such a basis, or one
similar to it, that will have a due regard to
the numerical strength of parties. This is a
question purely for the Legislature. If it is
approached in a proper spirit, free from the
low and scurvy tricks of the political dema
gogue, and if a fair and equitable arrange
ment of the districts is made, the labors of
the convention will receive tbe endorsement
of the people. On the other hand, if it Bhould
degenerate into a purely party movement
and with ulterior party purposes in view, its
work will meet with certain and deserved
popular condemnation.
one of their best men. All personal aspira
tions and factional divisions have been sunk by
that party, and Colonel Robert P. Dechert,
has been made their standard bearer. He is a
gallant soldier, and a gentleman of ability and
culture, and of blameless private character.
He entered the army as Sergeant Major of the
Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Kegiment, under
Col. John K. Murphy, on tbe first of July,
1861, and shared the fortunes -of our gallant
army until July i 7, lb65, when the regiment
was mustered out of the service. He partici
pated in the campaign of General Banks in the
Reus and Political Items.

in the memorable march to Atlanta, and thence

lul discharge of his duties, he has wou the re

Such is the nomination made by the Demo
crats in the elope Senatorial district, whoe de
cision on the 20th instant is to dechie the po
litical power of the Senate, nud it is an admo
nition to the Republicans that they must "do
likewise" if they would win. A Democratic
candidate with a brilliant record as a soldier,
and unobjectionable either as to qualification
or charncter, will demand the best candidate
in the Republican purty to defeat him.
A Strong domination.
The Democratic delegates to tho First Phil
adelphia Senatorial district met in convention
on Thursday, tbe 1st instant, and on the
first ballot nominated Col. Robert ?. Dech
ert to fill the vacancy caused by the death of
W. W. Wratt. Mr. Dechert served four
yeara in the army during tbe late civil war,
was a gallant soldier and left an honorable
record behind him. He is a lawyer by pro
fession, and at present occupies tbe respon
sible position of Assistant District Attorney
for the city of Philadelphia an office which
he fills with admitted ability and integrity.
At the fast October election he was the Dem
ocratic candidate for Judge of the Court of
Common Pleas, and in the wards comprising
the Senatorial district in which be is now a
candidate, he received a majority of the votes
then polled. The Philadelphia Evening Tel
egraph, a Radical paper, thus refers to the
high staodisg and character of Col. Dechert

candidate :

Sisters of Charity of the Hospital Cochin
have distributed every day, to all poor per
sons who called on them, milk fur infants
and the sick. A woman who lives in the
neighborhood did not coma for her usual
supply the other day until a very late hour.
She was informed by the Sisters that by
this time very little milk was left, but that
they would give her all they could spare.
Her vessel was taken from her, and after
wards returned three quarters full. Tbe
woman became angry and insolent and up
brafded the nuns for not keeping for her a
proper allowance, as she came regularly
every day. She west off. threatening with
lively menaces the Sister whose duty it was
to distribute the milk among the poor.
Next day she came back at the ordinary
time, and seemed angrier even than before,
shouting, "I must pay off that r.uu !" On
the third day she contrived to insinuate her
self perhaps not too gently into tbe pas
sage that leads into the kitchen of the Sis
ters, and then, snatching a flesh knife from
a table, she waylaid her charitable foe.
When tbe Sister had finished her distribu
tion of food and returned to the kitchen, the
woman plunged the kuife into her breast,
the effect being to injure fatally one of her
lungs. For three or four days the poor nuu
lingered ; on the fifth she died.

Akotheu Negro Outrage. On Wednes

while returning to her residence in Uuion
Ptreet, west cf Darlington, West Chester,
from Mr. Kifts. in High street, where she
had spent the day. was beset by a negro
near tbe corner of Union and Chestnut sts.;

effort she broke away from him and ran, he
following her for near two t-quares to her

being a negro, though she would Dot be able
to recognize him. Neighbors heard her

We do not believe these outrages are per

better disposition ; and to keep themselves
clear of suspicion they ove it to themselves
to aid in ferreting out the miscreants, that
they may be justly dealt with.

Last Week's Figuting. We can now
form a clearer view of the desperate fighting
of last week. Briefly told, Ducrot, having
crossed the river Marne and indicted heavy
losses upon the Wurtembergers and Saxons
in his front, was compelled by the arrival of
heavy Gorman reinforcements, to retreat to
the west bank of the river and take shelter
nnder Forts Vincennes aod Charentou. His
men fought with great courage and were
ably handled, but the movement was a
bloody failure. At the same time the effort
of Paladines to effect a junction with the
French armies at Paris, was baffled and
Paladines has fallen back on his entrench
ments. M. Gambetta has a right to praise
the bravery of the French troops, but he
was premature in his announcements of sig
nal victories, and in all probability ere this
week closes will take his departure from
Tours and issue his proclamations from some
other city. Tbe failure of these two great
movements for raising the siege of Paris,
stamps the '.French cause with the seal of
final doom. There is no other conclusion.

respectively. One of the occupants escaped
by jumping out one of the upper windows,
but he was so severely stunned that he was

consciousness he endeavored to render assis
tance to the suffering inmates but it was
too late, the devouring element forbidding

could do was to look on the horrible sight
as it presented itself in the four bodies envel

Mrs. Luell.i Gross has died in Maine

-A young lady was recently left waiting

The Wiuterset, Iowa, Sun sayp that in
the old times the Treasurer of Madison
County kept the public funds in his wife's
stocking-leg. Some one suggests that that
was an insecure place for so much money,
the Treasurer replied that no vaualt in the
world was safer than his wife's stocking.
A physician in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin,
was arrested for whipping his wifo, and was
requested to enter into bonds to keep the
peace. On his return home, he tore down
his sign, and swore ' he would not practice
in any d -d town where tne authorities
knew better than he what was good for his
wife."
The Japanese carpenters are ingenious
wo'kmtn, and their work is done with mar
velous neatness. A curiosity of their houes
is that they do not contain a single nail, all
their joists and timbers being dovetailed to
gether by many ingenious devices ; and the
whole work, even to the rafters, is as smooth
as if it had been polished down with sand
paper.
A fire, early on Sunday morning, in
Lawrenceburg, above Parker's Landing,
destroyed the Bevere House, tho Butler
House, Florence Hotel, Now York Hotel,
Adams & Foster's dry good store, Christ

about thirty private dwellings, and tbe Lo

$100,000. Tho fire was the work of an in
cendiary. The census-takers in some portions of
the West have as funny experiences as tbore
in the large cities in this section. Owe has
discovered a lady in Indiana who is happy

Ohio a family has been found where the firet

A man about fort v-five years old has
been living a berrcit's life in a rude hut near
Rolon Point, near Bridgeport. Conn., for
the past four years. Ho is said to be pos
sessed of a great literary culture and is deep

name of Robinson Crusoe, by which title he
prefers to be known, and obtains his living
by fishing and clamming, seeming perfectly
contented with his lot.
Thousands of our Catholic fellow-citizens,
says the Philadelphia Age of Monday,
assembled at tbe Cathedral yesterday, to
protest against the absorption of tbe Roman
States by Victor Emanuel, as King of United
Italy. Speeches were made by-IIon, James
Campbell. Hon. Joseph R. Chandler, Daniel
Dougherty, Esq., William A. Stokes, Esq.,
and others, and a formal enunciation of dis
sent to the late action of the Italian authori
ties adopted by the unanimous vote of the
multitude which filled the vast building.
trial interest iu the country, to wbich the
above reforms can be so easily applied, or.
with such salutary results, as to that of
coal mining. With a system of cooperation
and arbitration, such as has beeu adopted
in the majority of tbe mining aud manufac
turing regions of England, the protracted
and dis3ron:s strikes, w hich have been so
frequent in Pennsylvania, could not occur.
We hava beeu informed by a reliable
citizen of Berkeley county. West Virginia,
of a starting revelation of crime ia that
couuty. It seems that sometime during the
year 1861 a oung man by the name of
Robert Dauiels, living near Gerardstown.
left home and was never heard of afterwards
until 'a t week, when a man by the name
of Light, living at the foot of the Round
Top, on his deathbed, not only confessed to
the murder of youog Daniels, and t-tated
where his remains might be found, but also
confessed to robbing of Dr. Coe, of Gerards
town, about the same time, and a list of
other crimes which death cat him short in
relating.
The advantage of having plenty of
money, even when one has no social position,
is well shown by the fact that Laura Fair,
the murderess of Chittenden, was daintily
carried to jiil, attended by nurse and doctor,
and is treated with all possible consideration.
A San Francisco correspondent grows pa
thetic about the matter, and talks of how,
iu the cell next that occupied by the harlot
and murderess, there lies on a pallet cf
straw a womau who stole to keep her child
ren from starvation, while her neighbor is
as comfortable as possible. However, at
each made her choice of the sort of crime it
would he well to commit, each takes the
legitimate consequences of her act, and if
money will not help one in adversity, what
iu the world is tho use of money ?

LocriT OaTBOM, a venerable female miser
faded, sour, hate,d and friendless, died in
Poughkeepie the other day, leaving $15,000.
whicL "she clutched to the verge of the
churchyard mould." She had uo known
relativeo and no friends. But when it be
came known that she bad left behind her
the $15,000, a most numerous relationary
of all degree of consanguinity, and with eyes
red aud swollen from weeping over their be
reavement, put in an appearance. Tbey
crowd and jistle aud decry each other, and
preanut a spectacle of selfish rapacity that hu
man nature ought to he a.-hamed of. And yet,
we are told that in her youoger days, Locby
Ostrom was a sweet faced child, with a light
heart and cheery laugh, that 6he grew into
comely maidenhood, and had that "nearer
and dearer one." whom she eat by the win
dow to wait for, with a rose in her hair and
a throb in her heart. But. as many another
man has done, he ceased to come he mar
ried another, and Lochy Ostrom petrified
into the most disagreeable old body, whose
estate is now the subject of grasping conten
tion. What a realistic picture of the every
day world we have in this little story.
Funny Story or a Carpet Baogbb.
Here is a little story from Leavenworth
concerning a carpet-bagger : He entered
the hotel, walked slowly to the register, his
carpet-bag in hand and commenced to
scrawl his namewith painful accuracy upon
the book. Suddenly he paused, and looked
in tbe face of the landlord, who was curi
ously observing him. Then he dropped his
eyes upon the book again, in which proceed
ing he was imitated by tho landlord. Upon
the fair white page of the regisier a bed bug
was slowly, but majestically, meandering,
until finally it paused, as if waiting, at the
unfinished legend. John . Sir," he
remaked to the excited Boniface", "I've been
bled by St. Jo fleas, bitten by Kansas City
spiders, and dug into by Nicaraguan 'jig
gers.' but it's, the first time. sir. that I ever
struck a tavern where the bed-bugs looked
over the register to find out where your
room is !" and thereupon departed. Very
good and very new and all the way from
Leavenworth, too !
Served Him I'icht A very sad case is
