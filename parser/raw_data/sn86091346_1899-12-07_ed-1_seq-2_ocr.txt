Washington, Dec. 3. At a confer
ence of leading Republican members
held last night it was decided
to object to the swearing in of Congressman-elect
Roberta of Utah, pend
ing an investigation of the charge
against him that be is living in polyg
amy. Mr. Taylor of Ohio, who will
have charge of the matter in the bouse,
says the precedents for objecting to
the swearing in of a member duly
elected and bearing proper credentials
are numerous and In point. Among
others are the well-known casea of
Proctor Knott, Boyd Winchester and
John M. Rice of Kentucky, who were
elected to congress shortly after the
war and also were charged with in
eligibility on the ground of disloyalty.
All these precedents were cited at the
conference.
Tnese precedent lead to the conclu
sion that objection can be properly
made to the swearing in of a member
where there are apparently well
grounded reasons for believing him in
eligible, i he resolutions will pro
vide for the- appointment of a special
committee of either seven or nine, to
be appointed by the speaker.

ACQUITTED OF MURDER.
Military Training of
Captain Urldley's Non.
Washington, D. C, Dec. 3. J. P. V.
Gridley, a son of the late Charles V.
Grldley, who commanded Admiral
Dewey's flngship at the battle of Man
ila, was today designated for appoint
ment as a lieutenant in the marine
corps by the president.
i oung lirklley is too old to enter
Annapolis, and the only opening for
him in the navy lay in an appointment
to the marine corps, but he lacked the
necessary education, and worse than
all the money for study. The boy was
too modest to tell any one of his situa
tion, but Admiral Dewey, who loved
his iather, suspected it, and decided
to act. He determined to pay the boy's
expenses while studying for the lieu
tenancy.
He met young (iridley at the White
House and presented him to the presi
dent. Admiral Dewey started to ex
plain the situation when the presi
dent Interrupted and said: "You and
1, Admiral, will pay his expenses in
preparation for examination. If he
fails in the Urst examination I will
give him another chance; but I am
sure he will be ready when the time
British-Hoer Battle at Mudder River so
' haracterlxed.
London, Dec. 2 The expected great
battle of Moddt-r river has been fought
and General Methuen hasadded anoth
er victory to his achievements of the
past week. There appears to be no
doubt that General Methuen has gained
real advantage though the details
must be awaited before the full effect
of his ten hours' desperate fighting
;an be gauged.
Presumably the burghers' army was
on the south bank of the r'.'.er, but
whether when the Boers retreated
they crossed the river northward, or
retired in an easterly direction into
the Orange Free State, is unknown.
Possibly the Itocrs had repaired the
bridge previously reported destroyed,
and managed to withstand the British
attack with their rear guard while
their main body escaped over the
bridge, the rear guard destroying the
bridge behind it. The British, how
ever, appear to have surmounted the
difficulties of crossing the river, and
to have seized for themselves a posi
tion on the north side of the stream.
This success of the British clears an
other stage of the road to Kimberley,
the siege of which General Cronje
must have partially raised in order to
give battle to General Methuen.
The Burgher ate understood to
have a strong laager at Syptfontein,
fourteen miles north of the Modder
river, so another engagement possibly
awaits the British before they can
commence the last stage of the eleven
miles from Spytfonteiu to Kimberley,
though it is pointed out that General
Cronje will thereby run a great risk of
being caught between General Methuen
and Colonel Kekewich, the British
commander at Kimberley.
A belated dispatch from Orange
river says General Jlemuen s troops
are advancing under tue greatest,
difficulties, fighting an omnipresent
but almost invisible foe. A special
dispatch from Wiudsor says General
Methuen's dispatch to the queen, after
the-battleof Modder river, says:
The battle was the bloodiest of the
century. The British shelled the ene
my out of the trenches and then
charged. The result was terrible,

Dnenment -Heady for Congress, Conta!
80,000 Word.
Washington, Dec. 2. President Mc
Kinley 's third annual message to con
gress is now practically complete. It
is the longest message ever sent to con
gress by Presideut McKinley, compris
ing more than 20,000 words.
The most important features of the
message relate to the new dependen
deueies. I lie essential features on
these topics were thus outlined today
by a member of the cabinet:
Sovereignty is to be established
throughout the Philippine islands and
to be permanently maintained. Civil
government is to be extended through
out the islands as rapidly as possible on
lines somewhat similar to the arrange
ment effected for the government of
the island of Negros. Attention is in
vited to the report of the Philipioe
commission as to why it is impossible
for the United States to part with the
islands and as to the great commercial
advantages In holding them.
Civil government lu Cuba under mili
tary control is recommended until
some substantial progress has been
made through the medium of suffering
toward the establishment of an inde-
dependeut form of government.
Attention is called to the fact that
the census has not been completed, and
as the Spaniards have, under the trea
ty, until April next to decide whether
they will become citizens of the island,
it will not be possible until that time
to hold general elections to determine
upon the future government of the
island. The question of the annexa
tion is, therefore, left open. Great
stress is laid upon the improvement in
the island during the year, not only
commercially and agriculturally, but
also in the sanitary condition of the
cities and towns.
Manila, Nov. 30. The transport Man
nuer.se, with Lieut. -Col. Webb Hayes
and three companies of the Thirty
first infantry on board, ha arrived
here. She narrowly escaped disaster.
The officers and soldier were for
twelve days bailing with bucket.
The steamer was nnsea worthy, under
manned, and short of provision. Her
engine broke down and she rolled
three day in a typhoon.
When the Manauense anchored in
Manila bay, thirty-three day from
San Francisco, there were several fet
of water in her hold, and four hun
dred grimy, greasy, hungry exhausted
officers, soldiers and sailors had
been passing buckets of water sine
November 17th. night and day.
First Assistant Engineer Dunleavy
was under arrest, and, according to
Colonel Webb Hayes official report.
the chief engineer would have been
uuder arrest a!-o if there had been
any one to replace him.
The colonel's report also declare
that the captain of the vessel told him
that the only thing which brought
them through was the fact that the
men were greeulioins and failed to
realize their danger, while experi
enced seamen would have deserted the
ship and taken to the boat in mid-ocean.
The captain of the transport on No
vember 17 told I'oiencl Haye that th
vessel had sprung a leak and an Inves
tigation resulted in finding several
feet of water in her hold. The steam
pumps were tried, but failed to work
and there were no hand pumps on
board.
However, forty-six buckets were
found, other were Improvised and the

windlass.
The longest time a shift could stand
was two hours, and often the period
was not longer than half an hour. The
bailing continued until the ship an
chored here. The same day the leak
was discovered, the machinery col
lapsed, and th electric lighting plant
and distilling, evaporating and refrig
erating plant failed to work. There
were no lamps and the few candle
found were exhausted after a few days.

The United States now imports about
$30,000,000 worth of rubber annually
and it is thought that a large portion
of this supply can be raised in our new
possessions. The same is true of
Egyptian cotton, of which we import

In the meantime the men below, ig
norant of their extreme rceril, were

the Hell do We Care?" while the ship
rolled helpless ou the ocean with
hatches closed.
The oflicers and soldiers were entire
ly exhausted when they reached Ma

were grossly incompetent. The ofli
cers sav that the behaviorof the troop
was beyond praise. For day they

officers took the lead in bailing and en
couraging the men.
It i asserted that during the last
week of the vovag th men lived
almost entirely on whisky, beer and
hardtack.
The captain of the ship promised the
men 25 cents a day for bailing, but he
now proposes to pay them a dollar and
a half. The soldiers talk of attaching
the ship. The regiment will proceed
to Zamboanga on the Pekin to garri
son several ports on th island of Min-dano.

Marine Wanted at Guam.
Washington, Dec. 3. Captain Leary,
the naval governor of the island of

no signs of trouble now, it is regarded
as the part of prudence to have a suf

BILLS A CENTURY OLD.
There Is a bill for groceries, te,
furnished for an undergraduate at
Cambridge In the year 1788. The bill
contains one or two Items of furni
ture. Apparently the undergraduate
took over room already furnished at
a valuation and certain articles had to
be bought new.such as a hearth brush,
a pall, a mop and a ''Holland Cotch"
one knows not what this means, but
It cost 2 shillings 9 pence (43 cents).
The undergraduate would seem at
first sight to have consumed tea In a
most reckless manner. On Oct. 24 he
is charged 2 shillings for Hyson and 1
shilling 6 pence for Congo. On Nov.
2 he 1 charged 2 shillings for tea,
and on the same day, which looks odd,
6 shillings 6 pence for tea. On the 9th
of the month he buys a new teapot,
the old one, one supposes, worn out
with hard service. However, this tea
lasts him until the end of the term,
so that his tea costs him for the two
months no more than 11 shillings, or
2.75, and as the price of tea at this
time varied from 8 shillings to about
25 shillings, we may conclude that ha
got through no more than a pound
during the term.
In other words, this young man took
for breakfast a slight repast of weak
tea and bread and butter. Dinner was
then served at 12, so that breakfast
was only what the Indians called a
"chota hazrl." On sugar he spent 4
shillings, which means six pounds at
8 pence a pound. On candles he spent
24 shillings at 8V4 pence, or about 3
shillings a week. He burned wax
candles, mold candles and "wax
twist." Salt was a shilling a packet.
On two occasions he bought sand.
Was, then, the floor of his room sand
ed? It would eeem so.
Faith and Works One Thing.
"Faith" and "wotk3" are not two
separate things, but two phases or as
pects of the same thing. Faith Is the
inner spirit that links a soul with
Christ, and thus secures to the soul
power to do for God and man. Works
are the manifestation of that linking.
