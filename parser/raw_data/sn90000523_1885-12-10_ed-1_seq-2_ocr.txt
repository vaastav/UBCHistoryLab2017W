A number of colored ministers in

black man is considered prima facie in
the wrong, while the white criminal is
Allowed to go free of punishment. The
preachers declared that there is no poo
pls on the face of the earth who would
have born this injustice as long and so
patiently as the colored people have
done, and that the purpose of these
sermons was to arouse the black man
to a just sense of the wrong done him.
. The Charlestown Xews regards the ac
tion of the colored minister as an effort
to stir up strife, but it confesses, in lay-

The recent published order of Secre

to be furnished periodically by railroad
companies, which have received Gov

could be made applicable to all the

tlie lawyer had intimated, on giving this
disagreeable intelligence. Unit if Mrs.
Morris would consent to marry him ho
would lolieve her oi all further trouble,
not only in regard to this but all future
liimncial enil ami-sinents.
Tlie mortgage itself was trouble enough'
for one- poor woman to bear; but siio
would rather have had all the mortgages
in ilio world to fight than endure the
thought of life with a man with tlie menu
traits of this lawyer. .Sho gave biin to
understand this fact us clearly as a good
use of plain, matter-of-fact Knglish could

too smooth, in fact ns he went away, but
there was tlie sort of smile on his face
und its sinister counterpart in his soul
that boded no good to the object of bis
thoughts. It was as evident to hor as
though be had said so in so many words
that the time mentioned would be the lust
day of grace.
April first came but not the pultry bul
ance needed tocleuroif tlie mortgage And
no sum of money is pultry when one must
have it to avert disaster and cannot get
it. Mrs. Morris could see no earthly way
out of her troubles that morning. Every
thing looked dark. It was hard to havo
worked so long, to have struggled for
weeks and months and years, as she had
done, only to lose all at last. Ko, not all I
For she had tieorge and liess left. Think
ing of them made it still harder to bear,
for it was for their dear sakes she had
toiled and economized und saved. There
was a suspicious suggestion of what her
eyes had been doing when (ieorgecame
cheerily in to his breakfast.
"What, my little mammie's eyc3 are
half drowned!" he exclaimed in his
hearty, boyish way, with part fun and
more tenderness in his tone, ns be hugged
her like a young bear, and dabbed kisses
into each damp eye.
"Tisn't me" he continued, searching
for a cause for the rather unusual display
of discomfort. "No I'm glad of that,
for I don't think I've done anything down
right awful lately, and it can't bo Ucss ?
She's all right, i know no measles, or
whooping cough, or anything for I just
saw her sleeping like a a " hero he
paused for satisfactory simile, dubbing
more warm kisses from rosy lips into
redeyes the while "like a Huppv little
kitten."
" Ucorgie. do eat your breakfast. It's
as bad to have one's eyes kissed out us
drowned out."
"Oh, I know!" ho confined, pursuing
the subject with no intention of being put
otr. " Thnt old Harding is coining again,
I'll bet anything."
" Yes, dear, he, is coming ; " but the lit
tle woman had not the heart to tell all
that dreaded coining implied.
"Pshaw, niammie! Don't worry so
about it. That blamed mortgnge is almost
paid oil and you won't have to see the
mean sneak many time3 more."
" I don't like to hear yon speuk that way.
It doesn't help me and it hurts you."
More kisses that said as plainly as words
could, "It was because 1 love you and
can't bear to see you so unhappy, but if
it miris you i won i no it. any more."
Then he pitched into his breakfast with
as savage earnestness us though he
thought he was a half-starved cannibal
and iiis food was the luckless, but well
cooked Harding.
IL
"I'll bet it's an 'April fool!'" said
George, at the sound of an unusually loud
ring at the front door. It was in reality
a boy with a large ollicial envelope, ad
dressed to Mrs. Martin, who simply said
he was told there was no answer to wait
for.
Nervously Mrs. Morris tore it open, as
some people havo a way of doing with
their telegrams.
"It is the mortgage !" she cried, us she
undid the formidable document, it was
not her familiarity with law papers that
enabled her to so promptly identify it;
every fold nnd crease of this mortgnge she
knew by long und sad acquaintanc e.
"Are you sure 'tisn't an 'April fool,'
mammie?" asked (jeorge suspiciously.
Neither she nor his mother had, from past
experience, any reason to expect any fa
vors from Harding or the rich property
owner he represented. Here was the
mortgage in her hands there could be no
doubt of that a small piece of paper,
litter all, to have been such a dead weight
on the tiny home and the three that were
in it. Careful examination fuiled to dis
cover any scrap of a letter or word of ex
planation accompanying it.
" It is too good to be true," sighed the
widow, still (lazed by the event, " but peo
ple are sonietlnios better than we give
them credit for. I've already more than
paid the original amount of money which
your poor fnther was obliged to raise,
when the interest is counted in, and they
may have been moved to do a kindly, gen
erous act, although," she added, " I would
as soon look for sunshine in a coal hole.
If anyone has really been good it is not
Mr. Harding, lam sure of that much: it
must have been the man to whom tho
money really belonged and for whom he
works."
"If it ain't some kind of a mean 'April
fool 'I'll cut my hat," said George, with
greater force than elegance, who would
not believe the evidence of his own eyes,
when that evidence was iu Harding'
favor.
Presently that person himself made his
appearance. He nad the air of one who
had earned a warm welcome nnd ex
pected to receive it. Between gratitude
und doubt the widow smiled and tier man
r.er was so much more friendly than ever
before that. Harding flattered h)mself that
ho bad done n very clever thing indeed.
" Yes, my dear Mrs. Morris. I sent or
the mortgage ahead -of nie because
thought you would like to get It into your
own hands at last"
"Indeed, f am very glad If all my
trouble with (6 is finally at an end."

When the record is written on high,

As we sat under tho huge canvas last
Sunday aud cast an eye over tho thous
ands who filled tho entire space it cov
ered, tho thought occurred to us,
"What brings this crowd here?" The
question was as pertinent as when John
ate locusts and wild honey iu tho wilds
of Judca.
We watched tho oaser, restless
thronsr, and wo began to investisate
our own mental inquiry. The Rev. Sam
Jones was a poor boy, raised right
hero anioug us, a wild, rattling chap
that nearly everybody had ten hard
words for to every good ono spoken in
his behalf. He was the very synonym
of mischief and audacity, with a modi
cum of sharp; native "wit, that has
grown with Lis growth in succeeding
years. He cared precious littlo about
his books, as our experience will testi
fy in a short term of pupilago in our
school directly after tho surrender. To
Ins credit we will say no never lorgot
his respect or obedience to us, and an
earnest request or a calm statement of
tho caso would causo him to desist from
victimizing the smaller boys with his
tobacco jtiico or from playing clown in
tho pantomime on the siy.during school
hours.wliich was a never-ceasing temp
tation to his keen sense of tho ridic
ulous. His good nature always cropped
out when sullering or trouble were
present.
Tho writer will uever forget a visit
ho made to our house in tho most rat
tling period of his boyhood, to tell us
he was thankful and comforted to know
wo were convalescing from a serious
illness, in which our life had been des
paired of, and even at tho time men
tioned we were not fairly out of danger
of an early aud untimely grave. The
weather was severe, bitter, extremely
cold, but the young man brought his
frank, bright, face into tho sick-room
like a veritabio ray of sunshine, to tell
us that our sehool-boys were all so
glad we were still alive. There was in
him the germ of something noble and
elevated, aud when he joined the church,
within a half mile from our own door,
at a littlo country chapel, we felt that
tho germ would expaud into something
that would bo peculiarly his own ho
would either "mako a spoon or spoil a
horn," How much "spoon" last bun
day's crowd can toli.
Eight years ago, when he was peg
ging away on a littlo poor circuit, ho
cams again to see us, to pay his re
spects to the late Gov. Stephens. Wo
watched the two, as Mr. Stephens
rolled to and fro on the back veranda
in his invalid chair, und listened to
Sam's description of a dog-tight that
had fallen under his observation. Thero
was a magnetism iu both that quickly
found play, aud uter tho yisitopa le.-
tired Mr. Stephens was very eulogistic
Ho inquired minutely into his history,
and predicted a fuuiru from that rough,
native wit, which had evoked hearty
laughter, to tho veteran statesman's
great enjoyment.
Tho crowd on Sunday camo partly
to laugh, but many tears came also
with the laughter, and it was both tun
ny and uH'cciing to seo laughter and
tears mixed up so rapidly and indis
criminately. If wo had to diagnose
the attraction carefully, we would say
tho secret of his success lies in the fact
that he makes a clean breast of it, "a
sinner saved by grace." if ho onco
convinces you' that ho is entirely ear?
nest and honest and true in fitting ' liis
religion to his own life and character
the citadel of your unbelief will fall.
His wit goes far toward attracting tho
handy f " No t I thought not. Then,
innilum, I shall foreclose without any fur
ther delay, and"
"Count that, will you, and see If there
Isn't 37.au there."
It was George who had heard enough of
the conversation to II ml out that the mort
gage was not paid oil after all, and slip
ping out of the room hud returned a min
ute later with a small box full ot sliver
and copper, which he slapiml down rather
unceremoniously on the labia In f rout of
Harding, Which was the more surprised,
the mothor or the lawyer, It would be
quite impossible to tell.
"What's all this mean?" demanded
Harding with a scowl.
"Never von mind what all this means.
Just count that money and sign your
name, and then If you ever bother my
mother again just look out for yourself,
thut's all !"
"Oh, tieorge 1" was all Mrs. Morris could
say.
There was nothing for Harding to do
but count tho money, which was correct
toa cent, and allix his signature, which
he did with a face that looked like a
thunder cloud, and not without mutter
lugs that faintly suggested the disagroe
able commotion Inside. When he was at
last ont of the house, viciously bung
ing tho door behind him as a tort ot
harmless malediction as ho went, tieorge
caught his mother In his arms and hugged
and kissed her till both were fairly out of
brenth.
" I earned and saved It all myself, inam
mle," he finally was able to explain, " do
ing odd jobs nnd things all but. the last
tio and that I got for my stamp collec
tion yesterday. I knew you hadn't the
money to make this last payment and 1
meant to surprise you all tho time. I
knew thnt was an 'April fool' when that
mortgage came, but if there is a bigger
April fool in this town than that blamed
old Harding, I don's want to see him."
" Yon blessed boy !" was all "mammie"
could say between laughing and crying,
while it would have been hard to find
three happier people on tho face of the
earth that day than tho brave, patient
mothor, her manly, helpful son, and
SSweet Baby Hess, who got her share of
the sunshine of joy.
- And it will not make you the least hit
sorry. I am sure, to Know that the reason
Harding was so anxious to mnrry Mrs.
Morris was that he knew of some prop
erty that was soon coming to her, ot
which she had never a hint. But when
this new and unexpected blessing did
come to them they did not desert the
brown little wren-like Inane nest under
tho cherry trees only it made possible

gently. It is an exquisite and touching
tale.
Jacques had met Madeleine at the feto
of St. Cloud. He loved her because sho
was sad and ill. He wished to give the
poor child two sweet seasons of love, bo
fore ha laid her away forever in the earth,
and ha took her thero to hido with him in
the little dale of Clamart, whero the roses
bloom as if they had gone wild.
'You know the house. It was modest
and white, lost like a nest among tho
green leaves. On its very threshold one
could breathe the fragrance of a quiet
love. Jacques, littlo by littlo, became
absorbed by an infinite affection for his
dying wife. He watched her growing
paler every day with saddened tenderness,
Madeleine, like a taper In a church, which
casts one brilliant glow before it dies,
smiled, and cheered the little house with
her blue eyes.
During two summers the child scarcely
over went out. She filled the tiny garden
with her charming presence, her fresh
lobes, and her light step. It was sho who
had planted the large yellow gillillowers of
which site made bouquets for us. And the
geraniums, rhododendrons, aud hell tropes,
all those lovely flowers lived only tor her.
She was the soul of that little nook of na
ture. Then, In tho Autumn, j-ou remember,
Jacques came one evening and told with
his reluctont voice : " She is dead." She
had died beneath that littlo vine covered
bower, as an infant falls asleep, in the
dim hour when the sun sets. She had
passed awny among the green branches in
the forgotten retreat where love had
comforted her.

I kuew that he was still embowered at
Clamart, living in the memory of Made
leine. Since the opening of the Beige I
had been so wearied that I had thought
no more of him until the morning of the
13th, when, learning that there was fight
ing near Mendon, the little whito houe,
hidden among green leaves, was suddenly
pictured to my memory. And I saw again
Madeleine, Jacques, all of i:s, taking tea
in the garden, in the midst of the deep
peace of evening, whi!e Paris rumbled
faintly on the horizon.
Immediately I we- t forth by the "Gate
of Vanves." and took a straight course.
The roads were incumbered with tlie
wounded. At Moulineaux I learned of
our success, but when I turned past the
forest and stood on the hilltop terrible
emotion seized lny heart. Ik-fore me on
the ravaged plain where the little whito
house bad once stood, I saw only a hollow
darkened by flame and grape shot, My
tears (lowed ns 1 descended the lull.
Oh. my friends, what sorrow I The

tall, yellow gillillowers, the geraniums

broken, so monrniui to see mat l pitied
them as if I had seen before me the bleed
ing members of old friends.
The house is all torn away on one side.
It reveals, through itsgapingwouudiad
eleine's room, that modest, rose-hni a
chamber, whose curtains were always
seen closed from the highway. That
chamber, brutally torn open by the Prus
sian cannons, that amorous alcove now
visible from t::e entire vallev. made u:v

In the burial place of our youth. The
ground, coveted with debris, furrowed
with shell, resembled earth freshly stirred
by the spades ot diggers, in which one ecu
discern the shapes oi newly-made graves.
Jacques must nave abandoned the house
so ruined by shot. I still went forward
