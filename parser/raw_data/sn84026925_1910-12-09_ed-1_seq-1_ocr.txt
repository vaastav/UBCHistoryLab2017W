that, trying to set things to rights in

dropped him a line saying that the
goods would arrive on the third day,
and there was much to do to make way
for them.
Between spasms of work Duncan
had his hands full attending to the soda
fountain. Soda water being practically
the only salable thing in the store,
It had to serve as an excuse for the
inquisitiveness of many of my fellow
citizens, to say nothing of?I should
put it, but especially?their wives and
daughters. The consumption of vanllly
sody in those two days broke all known
Radville records and stands a singular
tribute to the Spartan fortitude of
Radville womanhood, particularly the
young stratum thereof.
From my window in the Citizen of
fice I was able to keep a tolerably close
L account of events and obtain a consen- |
I sus of public opinion. So far as the
! latter bore upon Duncan, it was di- j
^ vided into two rather distinct parties,
W one, of course, favoring him, and this
was feminine almost exclusively. Tra

cey Tanner, to be sure, confessed with- j
in my hearing to predilection for the
Noo York dood, but was inclined to
hedge and climb the fence when assailed
by Roland's strictures. Roland,
I suspect, was a wee mite jealous. He I
had been paying attention to?I mean,
going with Josie Lockwood for several
months. Instinctively he must have
divined his danger, and it's not in reason
to exact admiration of the usurper
from the usurped even when the act
of usurpation has not yet been defi|i
nitely consummated. Roland went to
^ the length of labeling Duncan "sissy"
r and professed to believe that Hiram
f Nutt was justified in calling him a
"s'picious character." Roland hinted
darkly that Duncan knew New York
no better than Will Bigelow.
"And if he did come from there," he
asseverated, "I betchtfr he didn't leave
for no good purpose."
His temper inspired me with the
sapient reflection that it's a terrible
thing to be in love even if only with
an oia man s minions.
"There's goln' 1o be a real Xoo Yorker
here before long," Roland boasted.
"He's comln' to see me on some special
private bus'ness of ourn."
"Huh," commented Tracey, the skeptical.
"what kind of a Noo Yorker 'd
come all the way here to see you?"
"That's all right. You'll see when he
gets here. He's a pro-motor."
"A what?"
"A pro-motor, a financier." Roland
pronounced it "finnan seer." thus betraying
symptoms of culture and bewildering
Tracey beyond expression.
"What's that?" he demanded aggressively.
"That's a feller 't can take nothing
A at all and incorporate it and make
V money out of it," Roland defined with
some hesitancy.
"And that's why he's coming down
here to take a look at you?" inquired
Tracey, skipping nimbly round the corner.
Curiously enough in my understanding
(for I own to no great faith in
Roland's statements, taking them by
and large) his friend of New York
put in an unheralded appearance in
Radville that same night on the evening
train. The Bigelow House received
him to its figurative bosom under the
name of W. H. Burnham. He sent for
Roland promptly and treated him to a
dinner at the hotel, something which
I have always regarded as a punishment
several sizes too large for the
crime. Later, having displayed him
on the streets in witness to his good
faith. Roland spent the evening with

lating behind closed doors in the hotel.
Duncan was at the station a few
days later superintending the transportation
of the new stock, which had
come by the early local. Betty was
f busy with her housework upstairs, and
only old Sam kept the shop.
Sam wasn't in the best of spirits.

Sam was worried. He had been over
to the hank once even at that early
hour, but Blinky Lockwood had driven ]
out of town to see abuot foreclosing
one of his numerous mortgages in the 1
neighborhood, and his note, which fell
due at the bank that day, was still a '
weight upon Sam's mind.
Roland and Burnham found him 1
wandering nervously round the store,
alternately taking his hat down from
the peg, as if minded to make a second 1
trip to the bank and replacing it as he 1
realized that patience was his part.
"Why, hello. Roland!" he cried cheer- *
fully, hanging up his hat for perhaps
the twentieth time. And, "How de ^
doo. sir?" he greeted the stranger.
"Good morning, sir," said Burnham c
pleasantly. c
"Say, Sam." Roland blundered with
his usuall adroitness, "this gentle- (
man"? '
Burnham s nana leu neavwy on nis

"What's that, Roland?" Sam turned 1
curiously to them.
"Oh, nothin'; I was?er?just goin' 1
to say that this gentleman's my
friend from Noo York, Mr. Burnham, *
and we just happened to look in."
"The friend you were going to write
to about my burner?" inquired Sam. c
It was here that Roland got a look
from Mr. Burnham that withered him *
completely.
"Why, no. Mr. Graham," Burnham ?
interposed deftly. "Mr. Barnette must
have been talking of some one else '
he knew in New York. I"?
"Didn't know he knew more'n one '
there," Sam observed mildly.
Burnham's glance jumped warily to
Sam's face, but withdrew reassured,
having detected therein nothing but J
the old man's kindly and simple na- "
ture. "At all events." he continued.
"I don't remember hearing anything
about the matter (what did you call it? '
A burner, eh?) from Mr. Barnette."
"I s'pose 'Roland forgot," Sam al- J
lowed. "He's so busy courtin" our
pretty girls, Mr. Burnham"?
"Yes, that was It," Roland put in t
hastily, seeing his chance to mend ?
matters. "I did intend to write you
about it, Mr. Burnham, but it kind of
slipped my mind. We've had a lot of
important business over to the bank
recently." 1

"WHAT WAS THIS?BURNEB?'
"By the way. Roland, did you just
come from the hank? Is Mr. I?ckwood
back yei?"
"No; I got off this morning. I don't
think he is. Sam. Did you want to
see him?"
"Well, yes." Sam admitted. "I guess
you know about that. Roland."
"Mean business, sometimes, asking
favors of those hankers, eh. Mr. Graham?"
Burnham remarked.
Graham nodded dolefully. "Yes. it
is unpleasant," he admitted confiding
ly. "You see, there's a note of mir

take care of it or pay the interest ju:

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
It It a Document of Unusual Length
and Dealt With Important Matters.
Washington, December 6.?Congress
gave respectful attention to
President Taft's message today, but
there were comparatively few members
who were willing to concede the
probability of favorable action at the
present session on many of the recommendations
contained therein. The
general opinion was that time would
not permit of action In view of the
fact that the session will close March
4th.
The message was delivered to both
houses by Serectary Latta soon after
they convened at noon.
The reading of the document which
was of unusual length, was begun at
12.19 p. m. in the senate. At first
most of the senators listened attentively
to the reading, but gradually
this attention ceased on the part of
most of them and those who remained
In the chamber devoted themselves to
printed copies before them.
In the house close attention at first
was paid to the reading clerk. The
interest soon lagged, however, and
those who remained In their seats did
so to study the printed copies that
had been placed on every desk.
The features of President Taft's
message, sent to congress today are
these:
He declares It is time to stop legislation
with reference to regulation
of corporations and to witness the effect
of a vigorous execution of the
laws already on the statute books.
The exact limitation upon business
methods Imposed by law will doubtless
be made clearer by pending decisions
of the supreme c urt.
Just at this time the president says
he believes the activities of the government,
in addition to enforcement
of the laws should be directed toward
economy of administration, the enlargement
of opportunities for foreign
trade, the building up of home industry
and the strengthening of confidence
of capital in domestic investment.
Mr. Taft recommends strongly
some form of ship subsidy to increase
American shipping, especially to South
America.
The tariff board is not ready to submit
a report on any of the schedules
of the Payne law and Mr. Taft says
he will not recommend any tariff legislation
until the new congress convenes
in December, 1911.
He urges that the tariff board be
made permanent and that all future
revisions be made schedule by schedule.
He vigorously opposes another
general revision.
The Panama canal should by all
means be fortified. An appropriation
of $19,000,000 is recommended for
this purpose.
There must be no more "pork barrel"
methods In river and harbor and
pubHc building bills. The latter
should be based upon the report of a
commission of experts. The past congress
has appropriated too much for
buildings not needed and not enough
for buildings badly needed.
Recommendation for anti-injunction
and Federal incorporation laws are
renewed.
It la proposed that second class
mall rates should be re-adjusted so as
to charge magazines a much higher
rate on their advertising sections.
Strong recommendations are made
for the establishment of a new banking
and currency system.
Two new battleships and several
auxiliary vessels are urged for the
navy.
The president recommends that
coal, phosphate and oil lands and
water power sites be disposed of in
the future by leasing.
Estimates for government expenditures
during the next fiscal year have
been cut to $630,494,013.12, which Is
$52,964,887.36 less than the actual
appropriations for the current year.
The estimated receipts for the next
fiscal year were $680,000,000.
The president urges the extension
of the civil service principle to all
classes of postmasters and to the diplomatic
and consular corps and the
acquisition by the government of residences
and offices for its diplomatic
officers.
Some criticisms of the Payne tariff
act are just, says the president, but
more are unfounded.
There should be more officers for
the army. The engineer corps should
be Increased by sixty.
Regarding the Panama canal the
president says:
"The progress of the work is most
eotlwfontnm' T 111 V*nnm nlofoH tl'Pl I
within the time set, January 1, 1915,
and with the estimated cost of $37 5.
000.000. The slides in Culebra cut
offer no great reason for delay."
Failure to fortify the canal would
leave the United States powerless to (
enforce the universal and equal use
of the waterway against a desperate
and irresponsible enemy and would
defeat the object of the canal in in- ,
creasing the military effectiveness of
the American navy.
The tolls should not exceed $1 per
net ton. The president should be
authorized to adjust the rates as necessity
arises. The government should
include in its management of the
canal the furnishing not only to the ,
navy but to the public as well, dry
dock and repair facilities and the sale
of coal, oil and other ship supplies.
Interstate railroads should be prevented
from owning or controlling
ships trading through the canal.
Regarding the courts the president
declares the crying need of the United
States is cheapening the cost of litigation
by simplifying judicial procedure
and expediting final judgment.
The supreme court should be relieved t
from unnecessary appeals. The sala- 1
ries of Federal judges should be in- I
creased. 1
Postal savings banks will be estab- <
lished in a number of cities January I
1. A parcels post on rural delivery <
routes is recommended. Postmaster
General Hitchcock is given high <
praise for putting the postolfice de- <
partment on a self-sustaining basis.
The president recommends that i
congress give some fitting recogni- t
tion to the Polar discoveries of Com- 1
mander Robert K. Peary. The sec- <
retary of the navy suggests that Peary !
be made a rear admiral and placed ?
on_the retired list.
ine stupendous vaiuo or tne a^ri- <
cultural products amounting to $8.826,000.000
this year, indicates a
good prospect for business throughout
the country.
The present census promises to be
the best ever taken, but Is not perfect.
The census pad tiers are to be
vigorously prosecuted.
A bureau of health should be established.
The Southern Pacific railroad
should be reimbursed for its expenditures
in lighting the floods in the imperial
valley of California several
years ago.
Heavier tines should be imposed
against steamship companies for violating
the Immigration laws. The facilities
at Kills Island. N. Y., should
not be so Increased as to offer an inlucement
to the steamship companies
o concentrate their immigrant business
at one port.
Immigrants are needed in the rural
llstricts.
Some provision should be made for
retiring superannuated government
clerks.
The only amendments suggested In c
the Interstate commerce law are an
appropriation to enable the interstate
commerce commission to ascertain
the valuation of railroads and fixing
the responsibilities of public carriers f
in the issuance of bills of lading. t

HAYNE'S "DREAM" REALIZED. t
e
Alfred Thom of Southern's Counsel, I
Relates Railway History.
The dream of Robert Y. Hayne, the c
ereat fharlestonian. was to build in S
South Carolina a commercial spirit
and to bring Into closer relationship
the south and the west to fight the
encroachments of the New England
states. Presiding over the con%'ention
held In Knoxvllle, In July, 1836,
Hayne, at that time mayor of Charleston
and a short while before United
States senator from South Carolina,
told the delegates of four states that
by establishing a line of railway from
Charleston to Cincinnati, through the
rich intervening territory, his hopes
of a commercial empire might be realized.
It was of this dream, now a reality,
the part played In It by the Southern
railway and the Importance of that
little connecting link known as the
South Carolina and Georgia railway,
that Alfred Thorn, chief counsel for
the Southern, told last Monday as he
paused, in concluding his argument
before Judge Shlpp, to turn back the
pages of commercial history of great
railway lines in the south and middle
west.
Railway History.
In 1827, the South Carolina Canal
and Hallway company started the
plans for the building of the longest
railway then known to the world.
This line was built from Charleston
to Hamburg, a distance of 137 miles,
and was completed in 1833.
"This," said Mr. Thorn today, "was
the inspiration of the commercial
spirit of Charleston and was to be the
substitute for the pack mule route."
In 1830 Robt. Hayne made his historic
speech in the senate, told of the
possibilities of a union of the west
ana tne soutn. uecemoer zu, is.jz, *
$1,000 was appropriated for a survey 1
of a railway to extend from the At- !
lantic waters to the western shore of [
this country. In 1835 Hayne began
the agitation for a line connecting J
Louisville, Cincinnati and other west- 1
ern points with Charleston. In 1836 c
he presided over the convention at c
Knoxvllle, where were gatherd dele- f
gates from South Carolina, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. ?
The proposed line of railway would !
run from Charleston, through South :
Carolina, into the mountains of North [
Carolina, through Tennessee into _
Kentucky, thence to Cincinnati and r
connecting points. ,
Legislation was had in all four _
states to carry out this plan. Then
came the panic of 1837 and the work
was halted. c
The Links Commenced. k
The result was the building of the 0
line from Branchville, through 1
Orangeburg, to Columbia, the first e
connecting link with other lines that 8
were to come through to middle western
territory. Here was the beginning e
of the realization of the dream of e
Hayne. 9
In succession came the link between J
Columbia and Spartanburg. Then
from Spartanburg to Asheville.
Thence connecting lines to Knoxvllle,
and from there on into the coal fields
and into Ohio. To Cincinnati went j
connecting lines and to Louisville;
from Louisville branching to Memphis
and St. Louis by another route. .
It is in railroad history?the ac- .
quiring of these lines by the Southern
railway. The Southern took over c
the line from St. Louis to the junction
of the Cincinnati Southern to c
Harriman Junction; and the line to ?
Knoxvllle, also to Memphis; the line i
from Knoxvllle to Asheville and down
to Spartanburg and thence to Colum- S
bia. A
"Here," said Mr. Thorn, "was had A
all the roads dreamed of by Robt.
Hayne. What was the offense of the
Southern?" F
All Save the S. C. and G.
The Southern at this point in railway
history had all save the connect- p
ing link known as the South Carolina tl
and Georgia, which the state of South b
Carolina now says was a competing b
line. A natural link, it was, according
to course, opening the way to h
Charleston, the seaport of South a
Carolina. F
"What would have been the attitude tl
of the people of South Carolina had o
the Southern IstoDDed there?" elo- E
quently asked counsel. c
"Would there not have been dis- e
approbation, condemnation? There k
was a line opening up the west to ri
Columbia and one gap between Co- ii
lumbia and Charleston. There was ti
the historical plan to fall In with, a
Yet that Is here made our sin."
Result of Lease. (l
In the event the lease Is declared ?
Invalid. Mr. Thorn pointed out the con- ^
dltlon that that would leave only the lJ
Seaboard and Atlantic Coast Line as %v
competing lines for business into "
Charleston and eastern Carolina and ^
the one small line, formerly the South
Carolina and Georgia. That no other Z!
line could take over the South Caro- ?
lina and Georgia, because of the nature
of operations now, was Mr. C)
Thorn's statement, which he fully explained
by pointing out the eonnec- "
tions of the several lines.
"The whole of eastern South Caro- ?
Una given over to one line of 135
miles of railway that has never In the Q

the United States will be called up- ai
on to decide during the present week, fc
when the case of Dr. John Hopkins, te
of Oconee county, against Clemson d
college, comes up for argument. le
In September, 1905, action was com- 01
menced in the court of common pleas hi
against the college, in which he al- H
leged that because the institution had hi
constructed a dike on its land on the
Seneca river it had caused him seri- ol
jus damages at times, especially to
when freshets were prevalent. He c|
alleged that he was damaged in the y(
ium of $8,000. tU
The case came on trial before Judge
James Aldrich. The board of trus- |y
:ees set up first a general denial and p]
ilso exemption because the college w
was a corporation and an agent for ni
:he state of South Carolina in the ?
rection of the dike, hence it could not (n
t?e sued. When the case came up be'ore
Judge Aldrich, he filed a decree
lolding that the suit was against the
state and could not be maintained, er
Therefore, he ordered it dismissed. c<
\n appeal was then taken to the su- m
>reme court of South Carolina and is
'rom that court brought to the su- ta
ireme court of the United States. bf
The Clemson devise and the acts of b(
ncorporation, upon which the college
was created, will come squarely be- of
ore the court when the case is taken vl

HISTORY OF THE TARIFF.
luccinct Review of the Cause of Legislation
Beginning With the War.
The Morrill tariff of 1861 was conessedly
an imposition upon the parlotlsm
of the people. It was a war
neasure pure and simple. The sacrllce
demanded of the country by the
xegencles of the time was not to outast
those exegencles.
Since the Walker act of 1847 the
:ountry had experienced wondrous
rrowth and prosperity under a revenue
arlff. Protection had never been,
iven by Its friends, advocated and advanced,
as other than an expedient to
leveiop our inrant inuusiries. x\o>ody
argued that It was not a tax on
he consumer. Nobody pretended that
t was a fixed policy. The country had
ifter 18*0 adjusted Itself to a revenue
ystem, and everybody, the manufacurers
included, was satisfied. So
nuch so. indeed, that In 1857 New
England willingly assented to a still
urther reduction of the revenue duies.
After the war of secession It began
0 be whispered in Republican circles,
'We have freed the negro, now let us
ree the trade." William B. Allison of
owa, ami James A. Garfield of Ohio,
vith James G. Blaine in close sympahy,
led and instructed by David A.
Veils?all Republicans?were preparng
to redeem the Republican promise
>f 1861, that the protective duties
ihould not outlast the needs of the
var, Allison and Garfield and Wells
foing the length of becoming members
>f the Free Trade Cobden club, of
London.
The Greely campaign of 1872 diverted
Garfield and Allison and Blaine
ind ultimately drove them back into
he protectionist camp. By 1876 the
Republican managers had discovered
hat the protective tariff was a gold
nine of campaign money, and the
novement toward lower duties, and
he fulfillment of the promise made
vhen the Morrill war tariff was enicted
fell to the Democrats, reinforc(d
by a number of so-called free trade
Republicans. In that year the demand
hat "all custom house taxation shall
>e only for revenue" first appeared in
1 national Democratic platform.
Thenceforward the policy, "a tariff
or revenue only," became Democratic
jospel law. It was so absolute and
tnlversal that the party rose en masse
0 what was called Mr. Cleveland's
ree trade message of 1887. It was so
ibsolute and universal that in the naional
Democratic convention of 1892
t was carried by an overwhelming
mte and made mandatory. Had Mr.
Cleveland only lived up to it?the
lountry having been prepared by a
ampaign of progressive education
lovering two decades?wc would have
lad as a result of the victory of 1892
1 tariff for revenue only, and in all
ikeiihood have escaped the free silver
ipheaval, which came to the front
>artly as a reaction against Mr. Cleveand's
tactless handling of a great op>ortunity.
This is now ancient history. Durng
fifteen years the tariff has occupied
i subordinate place in Democratic
ouncils. The protectionists have had
verything their own way. A politlal
generation has grown up which
mows scarcely the rudiments of the
luestion as we discussed it between
870 and 1885. Of the group of revnue
reformers who stood by their
ains shoulder to shoulder in every nalonal
Democratic convention and evry
congress for twenty-flve years, the
dltor of the Courier-Journal is the
ole survivor.?Louisville Courierournal.

Although revolution has been intending
in the Mexican republic for
he last five years, the present outreaks
are the only ones worthy of
eing considered serious.
The two central figures in the latest
isurrectlon against the Diaz regime
re Generals Bernardo Reyes and
'rancisco I. Madero. The active paricipation
of the latter, who was one
f the unsuccessful candidates against
>iaz in the last election, led to the
onfiscation of all his Mexican proprty.
Although these interests were
irge, it did not leave him a bankupt,
as he has been a heavy investor
1 American and European securies,
possibly foreseeing such trouble
s has arisen.
Diaz, Corral, Creel and Llmantour,
ie "big four" of the distrlto federal,
rofess not to fear the activities of
ladero, regarding him as a noisy agiitor
pure and simple. The one man
horn Diaz does fear is General Berardo
Reyes, now said to be in resience
abroad, where supposedly he is
lvestigating French military organiition.
He is accompanied by a pair 1
f aids, trusted Diaz followers, who 1
eport every one of his actions to the
astle on Chapultepec.
Eight years ago Reyes was slated 1
) succeed Diaz in the presidency of '
iexico. He was then minister of war,
nd as such at the head of the army. 1
[e was a fiery tempered soldier, who |
ad been governor of the state of
ueva Leon, with headquarters at
ionterey. He had conducted himself '
i well there that he had been brought 1
) the national capital for closer as- 1
iciation with Diaz himself. 1
Don Porfirio had planned to retire
om the presidency after the close of '
le second pan-American conference,
hich was held in Mexico in the win- ]
tr of 1901-2. Jose Yves de Llman- '
>ur, minister of finance, was then '
nosen to succeed Diaz and fill out the
nexpired term, after which General
eyes was to come to the head of the
avernment for another period of "reections."
I
Reyes was suspicious that Liman>ur
would not relinquish the presi?ncy
at the end of the short term
rid began to scheme to get the place 1
>r himself at once without the in- '
rvention of the finance minister. ^
iaz learned of Reyes' plans, as he 1
arned of everything else that went <
i in Mexico. He gave a banquet at I
is city residence in Mexico City, and
lere was a dramatic scene between 5
im and Reyes.
Then Reyes ceased to be minister t
' war. For a time he was sent back '
i Monterey as governor, always '
osely watched, and finally, about a I
?ar ago, was sent abroad on a "con
iential military mission." '
Now as General Reyes has sudden- <
made himself known in Paris, i
raised Diaz as a patriot and said he ^
as abroad to prevent the use of his ?
ime as a revolutionary slogan it <
ouicl appear as ir me ouruen 01 me
surrection falls on Madero. 1
Geographically the dispatches from i
exlco Indicate that insurrection I
iread through practically the whole 1
>untry. That the uprising has been I
incident with the termination of
exlco's first centennial celebration \
not hard to understand. The agi- t
tors caught the natives on the re- t
>und when cash enthusiasm had r
;en overdrawn. c
It was freely predicted in the City c
' Mexico last September that ine- t
tably hard times must come when r
le last of the flags and incandescent a
ectric festoons had been taken i
)wn. 1
Anti-American demonstrations af- s
r the Texas lynching simply crys- f
tallzed a movement against Diaz
that has been visibly growing?one
that the occupants of the Palaclo
Nacional in the Zocaio have been preparing
to quell speedily. The rank
and file of Mexicans hate Don Porflrio
because he has licked them into
approximate law and order with a
grasp that never relaxes.
WHAT ONE GIRL DID.
Paid Her Way to Winthrop With Proceeds
of an Acre.
The following exceedingly interesting
account of how she earned money
to pay her expenses at college is told
by a "freshman" student at Wlntrop.
It was not written for publication,
but Is given publicity with the consent
of the college authorities:
"I have always had a desire to get
a college education, but I wanted to
earn the money to meet my expenses.
I thought over the subject and decided
to plant one acre of cotton. I asked
papa what he thought about It, and
when he said, 'Good for you,' I felt
very much encouraged. I had a
horse of my own. I hired the plowing
done and gave papa the seed each
year for the fertilizer and rent.
"In April, 1908. I planted my first
acre of cotton. It is needless to say
I watched It very carefully when It
began to come up. I chopped It out
myself, two feet In the drill. It looked
very small for a long time and I began
to lose hope, although I did not
say anything about It. One day papa
came in and said, 'Minnie, do you
know you are going to make more on
your acre of cotton than I will on the
one next to It?* This was very encouraging.
By and by It began to
grow fast and bloom. Imagine my
delight when I found I had the first
cotton blossoms on the farm. By the
last of August my cotton was as high
as my head and lapped in rows four
feet wide. I knew I was going to get
'rich at once.'
"In September and October I had It
picked and found to my delight I had
made one and one-half bales. I
thought I was the wealthiest girl In
Lexington county, tc have a bale and
a half of my very own cotton. Cotton
was low that fall. I decided to hold
it until I got 15 cents, which I did
next July. I deposited my money in
the bank at 4 per cent Interest. Each
year since I have planted Just one
acre of cotton and have always made
a bale each year. This year father
savs I shall almost eet two bales. I
think I am a real farmer.
"I have paid my expenses two sessions
in the high school and had
money left over each year. When I
left home I went to check my money
out of the bank to make my first payment
of college dues, and found I had
$75.98. This necessitated my borrowing
2 cents from papa. I feel sure I
shall make enough on my cotton
patch this year to meet my second
term payment, and pay part, if not
all, of my dues for another session.
Estimating that the cotton this year
will bring me $140 dollars, I will have
made $293 in three years, clear of
expenses. This is only one instance
of what may be done on one acre of
land."?Columbia State.
A FAMOUS EDITORIAL.
What Mr. Churoh Told Liitla Virginia
About 8anta Claus.
Dear Editor: I am eight years old.
Some of my little friends say thera la
no Santa Claus. Papa says: "If you
see it in the Sun, it's so." 'Please tell '
me the truth. Is there a Santa Claus?
Virginia O'Hanlon,
No. 115 West 96th street.
Virginia, your little friends are
wrong! They have been affected by
the scepticism of a sceptical age. They
do not believe except they see. They
think that nothing can be which is
not comprehensible by their little
minds. All minds, Virginia, whether
they be men's or children's* are little.
In this great universe of ours
man is a mere insect, an ant, in his
Intellect, as compared with the
boundless world about him, as measured
by the intelligence capable of
grasping the whole of truth and
knowledge.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus. He exists as certainly as love
and generosity and devotion exists,
and you know that they abound and
give to our life Its highest beauty and
Joy. Alas! how dreary would be the
world if there were no Santa Claus.
It would be very dreary as If there
were no Virginia. There would be no
childlike faith then, no poetry, no
romance, to make tolerable this existence.
We should have no enjoyment,
except In sense and sight. The eternal
light with which childhood Alls
the world would be extinguished.
Not believe In Santa Claus. You
might as well not believe in fairies!
You might get your papa to hire men
to watch in all the chimneys on
Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus
coming down, what would that prove?
Nobody sees Santa Claus. but that is
no sign that there Is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are
those that neither children nor men
can see. Did you ever see fairies
dancing on the lawn? Of course not,
but that's no proof that they are not
there. Nobody can conceive or imagine
all the wonders there are unseen
and unseeable in the world.
You may tear apart the baby's rattle
and see what makes the noise in
side, but there is a veil covering the
unseen world which not the strongest
man, nor even the united strength of
all the strongest men that ever lived,
could tear apart. Only faith, fancy,
poetry, love, romance can push aside
that curtain and view and picture the
supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is
It all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this
ft'orld there is nothing else real and
abiding.
No Santa Claus! Thank God! he
lives, and lives forever. A thousand
pears from now, Virginia, nay, ten
times ten thousand years from now.
