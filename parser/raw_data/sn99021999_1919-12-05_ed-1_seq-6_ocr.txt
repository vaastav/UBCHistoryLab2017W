f The comity existing between governors in
Nebraska takes on a fearful and wonderful form
at times. . . . u .
WHY HAVE A PENITENTIARY?
Mystery surrounding the easy release from
the state penitentiary of a long-term prisoner
convicted of a serious offense may 'or may not
be impenetrable. Investigation ' properly di
rected will determine that. What the public is
most concerned in is the modus operandi by
which the liberation was effected.
A rather elaborate system for, considering
applications for paroles and pardons has been
built up in Nebraska, ostensibly for the purpose
of dividing responsibility between the executive
and members of a pardons board. Back of this
is a desire to relieve the governor of undue em
barrassment in the exercise of the pardoning
power, as well as to provide adequate' means
for determining the merits of individual cases.
An important criminal, to whom parole had
formally been refused is able to secure release
on an informal order. Some of the facts
brought out by hasty inquiry give the case an
unusual look. The .order for a "furlough" was
signed on September 8, a day on which neither
the governor nor lieutenant governor was
within the state, and when the president pro
tempore of the senate was acting' as executive.
It may not have occurred to him that anything
out of the routine course was going on, but
the outsider will be struck with the singularity
of the coincidence. Another point of moment
is the secrecy that' was observed almost for two
months befdre the order was presented, while
even more astonishing is the fact that the war
den .complacently accepted without question a
document that ordinarily must have called for
verification.
Finally, the point raised simultaneously by
the' lieutenant governor and the mayor, that
such proceedings tend to discredit the usual
process of obtaining justice and punishing j
criminals, can not be avoided. The fullest pos
sible inquiry should be made into the details
of this case. Inquiry may develope a state of
facts differing materially from the surface
showing, and clear away what now seems a
queer, situation. v

, Fighting the White Plague.
While effort more or less sporadic, directed
sometimes with and sometiriies without high
intelligence, is being made to ri.d. the earth' of
various of its ills, the national organization for
combatting tuberculosis steadily pursues its
campaign. This was carefully marked out long
ago, when-it had been fairly determined that the
disease is preventable and, even curable. Ex
perience has brought about various modifica
tions in detail, as better ways of doing the work
have been discovered or developed, but the main
purpose is unchanged. ,
One of the most deplorable sequels of the
war is the increase of tuberculosis , in . Eu
ropean countries, j This was inevitable, because
of the condition ef undernourishment and con
sequent lessing of the disease-resistive quality
of the inhabitants of the waj-stricken lands.
Danger to America is recognized in the fact
that the diseas is increasing in Europe. A more
immediate and insidious danger is the apathy
of our own people. A few years ago the coun
try was thoroughly aroused by a campaign of
intensive education, and much of good came
from the agitation, but now that the populace
has in a sense become familiar with the disease,
its presence noj longer excites the dread that
once accompanied it, Out of this has come a
sense, not of security but of indifference, and
not a little of the benefit of public education
has thus been lost, i
The Society for the Study and Prevention of
Tuberculosis is active, however, i energetically
and persistently combatting the disease to
which is ascribed 150,000 useless deaths an
nually jn the United States. Its work does not.
interfere with nor duplicate that of any of the
other moves for relieving mankind of affliction,
and so deserves the hearty support of those
who really are concerned for the welfare of hu
Santa Fe trainmen, who threaten to quit
rather than haul coal dug by volunteers, olight
. to keep in mind that they are working for Uncle
Sam and a strike of the sort they propose would
dome mighty near to being treason. ,

An Old' Standby
' An. average good Missouri " mule "sells for
' J00. This, sturdy animal keeps on itssure
" tooted way. regardless of. multiplying automo
biles and tractors. The steady demand, for
mules is mainly from the farms, a good sign of
Speeding up production where most needed. In
1 horse breeding also the situation is favorable,
but choice animals are wanted. Predictions of
a horseless era are no longer heard. The men-
ace seemed most serious nearly 30 years ago
when prices generally were at the lowest ebb.
Ilk some places in the northwest horses, were
turned adrift as not worth feeding through the
winter. At farm sales a sheep might bring but
23 cents. An alleged remedy widely supported,
and defeated several times politically, was silver
inflation. Prices have certainly advanced with
out regard to nostrums of that kind. Twenty-
1 five years ago it was charged that gold had been
1 cornered in Europe. We have now the largest
stock of gold on record.
There is clearly a .sound business-expansion
vhen the demand grows for mules and horses
as well, as a'l kinds of motor vehicles and im
, proved farm machinery. More production is
the cry, and it is heeded. Breeders of all farm
jf'n'mals have accented a, new atid higher stand-d-d.

How to Spend the Long Evenings. ,
One of our contemporaries undertakes to
express the quandary in which its readers find
themselves these days, between solitaire and
sleep, for filling in the long evenings. As an
alternative," The Bee would suggest that some
thing sweet may be snatched from adversity, if
only the individual will accept the opportunity.
Instead of dividing the evenings between sleep
and solitaire, either of which may be reckoned
among the necessaries, give a portion of it to
solid reading, sober reflection and intelligent
discussion in the family circle of the situation.
This does not mean that one must set about
a thorough course in political economy, al
though that would do nobody harm, but it does
mean a time for cleansing the mind of a lot of
false notions that have been fostered by a
course of moral and mental, treacle applied
through various agencies. It is not for the mo
ment possible to devote the evenings to watch
ing miracles performed before the camera, to
see the(bedraggled heroine brought up from the
depths of physical degradation and suddenly
mounted on a pinnacle of immaculate prosper
ity, or the honest train robber or bank burglar
given a clean-bill of health because "he paid
for it all in France." Folks now have a chance
td get away from inverted morals, diverted
principles and distorted economics, and acquire
something of a comprehending grasp on the
fundamentals of life. It is not our purpose to
prescribe a course of reading, but we may be
pardoned for making a suggestion. A good
place to start would be the editorial by George
Horace Lorimer in the last Saturday 'Evening
Post, headed "Joyriding and Jaywalking."
Ending War by Resolution.
A difference of opinion has arisen in congress
as to which of two ways to go about ending the
war with Germany and Austria by resolution.
The course suggested as an alternative to ratifi
cation of the peace treaty. Democrats express
the opinion that Mr. Wilson will give his assent
to neither, and that a resolution can not be
passed over his veto. This is equivalent to no
tice that the president's party will support him
in his present attitude. . One thing that should
not be forgotten is that' the end of the war will
bring to a termination the extraordinary powers
exercised by the president. This, would not be
a public calamity. Return to peace conditions
is earnestly desired by all. In his message to
congress the president ascribes no little part of
social unrest to the fact that peace was not
speedily restored. He is well advised that it
can not be on the basis of accepting his League
of Nations covenant. With the attitude of con
gress further disclosed, the matter now be
comes more and more one- of personal dis
position of the president. ,When he is willing
to meet the' senate half way on the treaty, the
jest will be speedily accomplisher 1
- From the New York Timet.
v Allied today in dealing with the German
Baltic army of Von Der Goltx and Avaloff
Bermondt was due largely to the fear of bol
shevism either spreading from Russia through
the Baltic states or springing up spontaneously
in them. -Now that the army which was to save
the Baltic for Germany is thoroughly beaten we
may expect to hear more talk of this. The outcry-will
probably be great, and most of it will
come, directly or otherwise, from. Gecmany.
The actual danger is very much less.
Mr. Duranty's dispatch published In yester
day's Time's indicates something of the difficul
ties, which the Letts will have, as the Esths
have had, with the "Baits" the descendants of
the mediaeval military conquerors of the coun
try. , In Latvia these are mainly German in
blood, with some Swedish and Danish elements;
in Esthonia the Swedish racial'element is much
stronger, but racial origin is not the decisive
characteristic. The Baits include a considerable
percentage of the town population and prac
tically all of the landlio'ding nobility; and,
whether German or Svve"';s'i by descent, prac
tically all of them are ("ennan in conscious
ness. Numerically they are from 4 to 8 per
cent of the population in different parts of the
Baltic territories.
In Esthonia 80 per cent of the arable land
and 84 per cent of the forests belonged to 7SS
nobles. In consequence, when the Esths got
control of their own country they passed sc.
vere measures of expropriation which split up
most of" the estates. No doubt in some cases
this worked hardship; but the" land barons had
had some centuries to make themselves loved,
and had succeeded, with a few exceptions, in
winning the bitter hatred of the populace. The
same thing is true in Latvia, where the expro
priation is still to come, and the fears of the
Baits are consequently heightened by the un
certainty of the situation. The unsuccessful
Russian revolution in 190S provoked some peas
ant risings in the Baltic states, with the burning
of manor houses and massacres of nobles, which
naturally were followed by still more, severe
reprisals when imperial authority was re-established.
It is apparent that the Baits 'are afraid
of something of the sort today, now that the
German filibustering expedition, which received
at least moral support from the land-owning
classes has collapsed. There is, however, rea
son to hope that the responsible: governments
now in control on the Baltic will prevent popu
lar outbursts such as occurred in 190S.
All this, however, is not bolshevism, nor
anything like it. It is a solution of the agrarian
problem such as is going on in Czechoslovakia
and Roumania and is about to occur in Jugo
slavia somewhat mpre extreme and attended
by harsher feeling, since local conditions were
more oppressive; but it is not bolshevism. Latvia
and Esthonia have both fought off bolshevism;
there is a good deal of socialism in both coun
tries, but very little of it has any sympathy with
the state of Lenin and Trotzky. In the winter
of 1918-19 the bolsheviki invaded the Baltic
states, with the frank declaration, published in
one of their official newspapers, that "Lith
uania, Latvia and Esthonia lie across the route
to western Europe, and constrict our revolution.
This wall between the revolutionists of Russia
and Germany must be torn down The
control of the Baltic will also give soviet Rus
sia the opportunity to act upon the Scandina
vian states."
But much has changed in a year. Spartacus
is no longer an imminent danger in Germany,
and the bolshevist drive toward the Baltic has
been stopped., The . Baltic states need peace,
even such a temporary half-peace as can be
made with soviet Russia. They tiope to regain
their feet economically by acting as commer
cial intermediaries between soyiet Russia and
western Europe, but the blockade is likely to
hinder this. But they have the strongest possi
ble interest in avoiding military alliance and in
preyenrinp infiltration; for bolshevist rule on the
Baltic will mean the end of nationalism, the
swallowing up of the newly liberated states in a
Russian mass whose rulers are no more sym
pathetic to the Letts a"d Esths than were the
Romanoffs. The new states have won their
liberty hy fighting, and national sentiment
seems strong enough to keep bolshevism out;
nor will the manners of Mr. Litvinoff,' who be
haves to 'the Baltic negotiators as Hoffmann
behaved at , Brcst-Litovsk, be likely to make
friends for his government. ,.

When Adam was the only man, the first and
foremost chief, sartorial simplicity was great
beyond belief. He grabbed a suit of hand-me-down
from off the nearest tree and said, "It's
very cheap and plenty good enough for me."
He didn't sing of Shannon or some other Irish
scene, but he's the lad who set the styles in
wearin' of the 'green. . '
' But , since that gay and happy time the
ruthless hand of fate has gone and changed the
simple styles and brought them up to date, The
noise upon the street would be uproarious and
big if any one appeared in clothes he gathered
from the fig. We want to be resplendent beaus
and charm the giddy belles, wherefore we buy
the garnishments that Tcthn A. Swanson sells.
He always has the kind of clothes that never
lose their grip and never queer their owner with
a disconcerting rip; that never cast their buttons
as the forest casts the leaf and bring the wearer
face to face, with deep and sudden grief. He
keeps the kind of pants in which a person climbs
the fence in perfect nonchalance and with
serenest confidence.
' His big Nebraska Clothing house is widely
known to fame, but it is only one with which
he's played the clothing game. He started here
when Omaha was young and full of grass and
proved himself a business man of quality and
class. He's built successive businesses in
clothing for the gents, and gathered as ,the
years rolled by a stately recompense. .

A. E. F. Men on Coal Strike.
' .Genoa, Neb., Dec. S. To the Edi
tor of The Bee: The telegram sent
to President Wilson relative to the
coal situation by F. H. Stevens, trav?
ellnsr salesman stopping at the Fon
tenelle, should be considered aa an
insult to all American soldiers and
personally la by me, and I will be
frank to tell thia gentleman so face
to face.
As to the manner In which this
strike situation has been handled, I
think it was all wrong. The situa
tion should have been taken In tow
before it reached the point of a nation-wide
walkout, and mines oper
ated by the government until opera
tors and miners threshed out their
differences. Any fair-minded per
son will concede to that argument.
But Mr " Stevens' statement
(which Is I. W. W.-ism) that the
2,600,000 A.'E. F. men were sent to
P'rance as bill collectors for Wall
street is absurd and without any
foundation, and an Insult to the
Stars and Stripes, and to the quarter-million
"buddies" who lie today
In far-away France. We did not go
to France to benefit any one, but to
protect the Integrity of this nation
and save our sister allies from
slaughter by a, band of savages
known to the woild as "Huns" and
"Boches," and the same fate our
allies received would have befallen
our nation as soon as the German
imperialism could strike at the por
tal of our country.
Revelations brought to light after
we entered the conflict makes it ob
vious to the American people that
we had In our land, a nest of Ger
man sympathizers who would have
takeh up arms to crush America at
the command of old Kaiser Bill and
his aides. And, to conclude. I will
say I will have to be In a very good
humor for any one to sincerely re
mark to my face or in my hearing
that the khaki uniform went to
France as Bill collectors for Wall
street, arid. Mr. Stevens in using this
terms is plain and pure I. W. W.
ism in all Its forms and no one but
an I. W, W. would make a like as

"Bobby, what under the sun are
you doing down in the cellar all the
time?" asked Bob's mother about a
week before Christmas. "It seems
to me there hasn't been an evening
or a Saturday for about a month
that I haven't heard you sawing and
hammering down there." '
"There hasn't been, mother. I've
been there all the time. I'm making
things to sell for Christmas pres
ents. Come down and I'll show
you."
So Bob's mother went with him
down to his Christmas, workshop.
"This bobsled," said he, "I figure
on selling tosMr. Collins. Jimmy
told me some time ago that he
thought his father was going to give
him a bob for Christmas, so I saw
Mr. Collins about it and he said that,
if I could make a good one, he would
DECEMBER
buy it. This one is better than any
he can find downtown. Got the idea
from Mr. Hyde's article on 'How to
Make a Bobsled.'
"Then here is an indoor flower box
that Chuck Moore is going to buy
for a present to his mother. She
has been wanting one for a long
time. Got that idea out of one of Mr.
Hyde's articles, too. Here is a
plant stand I intend to sell to An
nabelle Brown to give to her mother.
I- got thte idea for it from Mr. Hall's
book on 'Handicraft for Handy

"These picture frames I haven't
sold yet. Cousin Dick is going to
give this umbrella stand to Aunt
Kate. It's a pippin if I do say it
myself. And this cedar chest I'm
going to try to make dad buy to give
to someone."
"Myl I've been wanting one like
that for a long time," said mother.
"Next year," Bob went on "I'll
start earlier, I'm going to' try a fire
less cookeiv. Tt doesn't look so ter
ribly hard. Then there are a lot of
other things I can make such as
clock shelves, necktie racks, towel
racks, book racks, towel rollers,
magazine racks and a dozen other
things."
, "You will certainly make some

"Sure.'and you ought to see the
