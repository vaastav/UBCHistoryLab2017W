The President's Message*
It is safe to predict for this remarkably able
and comprehensive state paper, embracing
subjects of very great variety and delicacy,
upon which there have been much division
of opinion and not a little difference of feeling,
a more hearty and general approval by the
press and people of the United States than
usually falls to the lot of such messages. The
President has shown himself not less courageous
as a statesman than he is known to be
brave as a warrior. He treats the San Domingo
question with an eloquence and an earnestness
which will surprise some who have
_ 9 _ ? 1 il . l I 4 1? V
considered nis posuion on mat suDjeci me weat
side of his policy ; and we are much mistaken
if his arguments do not convince as well as
surprise. lie has dealt with unflinching firm,
ness with the Canadian fishery and Alabama
questions, as well as with our right to a free
navigation of the St. Lawrence to the sea. In
all that is said on these subjects, perhaps the
most delicate of any that enter into its composition,
the message will be sustained by the country,
and this not less for its boldness than for
^ its justness. There is in it a determination to
bring these knotty questions with Great Britain
to a certain and speedy settlement, and thus to
put an end to the irritation they inevitably
cause between the two countries. Neither
.. England nor America can well afford to be
loager involved in wrangling diplomacy about
Alabama claims and fishery questions; and
the firmness of President Grant, as evinced in
this great state paper, must have the good
effect to bring matters between the two countries,
without delay, to an issue.
In England,[of course, the message will sound
somewhat insolent, if not defiant; bnt this,
however mnch to be deplored, could not have
been avoided without failing of the wise purpose
of bringing to an end questions sure to
breed mischief at no distant future if permitted
to remain the subjects of contention between
the two countries. There is always something
harsh in any announcement, however smoothly
worded, of the purpose of a nation to protect
ita own right* and redress its own wrongs; yet
this is the best way often to prevent the necessity
of executing that purpose. by violence.
General Grant has earned for himself the reputation
of meaning just what he says abont every i
subject npon which he takes occasion to speak,
and this will give weight and importance to
what he says in his message on this subject,
both at home and abroad.
The friends of equal rights of all colors have
especial reason to congratulate themselves upon
having in General Grant a sound and consistent
Republican President. The high claims
of justice, liberty, and humanity seem to have
been present and deeply felt by kirn, both at
the beginning and at the end of his message.
At the beginning be alludes to the obstructions
thrown in the way of equal sofTrage in certain
States lately in rebellion, and at the end of bis
address, it will be seen, that he returns to the
same subject, thtis^makiiig it first and last of
his policy:
"In conclusion, I would sum up the policy
of the administration to be a thorough enforcement
of every law; a faithful collection of
every tax provided for-, economy in the disbursement
of the same; a prompt payment of
every debt of the nation ; a reduction of taxes
as rapidly as the requirements of the country
will admit; reduction of taxation and tariff, to
be so arranged as to afford the greatest relief
to the greatest number ; honest and fair dealings
with all other peoples, to the end that war,
with all its blighting consequences, may be
avoided, but without surrendering any right or
obligation due to us ; a reform in the treatment
of Indians and iu the whole civil service of the
country ; and, finally, in securing a pure, untrammeled
ballot where every man entitled to
cast a vote may do so just once at each election
without fear of molestation or proscription on
account of his political faith, nutivity, or color."
We commend this message to the careful and
cordial perusal of all our readers. There is
much in it upon which we would be glad, did
our space permit, to make further remarks.
The matters of " revenue reform " and " civil
service reform " are disposed of in a manner
well calculated to silence the unjust and mischievous
criticisms which have been, either
openly or insidiously, made upon the present
administration of late. Of coo roc the message i
will be assailed in certain quarters. No paper, i
whether from earth or sky, man or angei, can t
^ escape this criticism in our free country, with 1
its free press and its free platform ; but it will 1
as well support itself with the American peo- i
pie as any paper that was ever submitted to
their candid judgment. i

Th* VoHl-Arrt t'OiiprrSf* ' J
Lnusual interest is generally felt in I his (tlio
hird) session of the Forty-first Congress,
(t assembles at a critical period in the history
>f oar political experience, and amid a perfect
tumult of conflicting interests. The representatives
of contradictory opinions are bold and
fierce in the assertion of them, and some doubt
prevails as to whether the flexibility and toughness
of party organizations can withstand the
force of the abundant explosive materials
known to be "bottled up'' within them. It is,
however, the condition of the paities, rather
than the inherent difficulties of the situation,
which is just now the chief ground of solicitude.
Men are locking ahead w ith something
of the anxiety of a sea captain who, after a
perilous voyage, is approaching a more perilous
coast. This session of Congress, meeting
half way between '08 and 72, occupies
a pivotal position, and is expected to indicate
the policy fated to triumph in the succeeding
Presidential canvass. It may be worth
while for us, though pretending to no great
skill in such matters, to throw out such thoughts
as we have in respect to the present juncture
of our politics, more especially as we, in some
measure, speak for, and to, a peculiar people, a
class more vitally interested in the complexion
of the immediate political future than any other
in the country. With others dollars and cents
arc involved, with us the dearest interests
known to the heart of man are involved. The
scale has but to turn even a hair's breadth, and,
as a people newly raised to the enjoyment of life
and liberty, we may be hurled as in the twinkling
of an eve into the regions of doubt and
O -J 0 - ?
danger, if not positive ruin.
If we look to our ancient enemy, the Democratic
party, we shall find it remarkably active
and vigilant, and withal (as it well may be)
much encouraged. Its appetite for office has
been whetted by nearly a dozen years of starvation,
till it has become, Cassius like, lean and
desperate. It cannot be denied that this old
party has some reason to be cheered by the
political prospect. The efforts it is now making
to secure the confidence of the American people,
and destroy their confidence in the Republican
party, have thus far met with downright
success.
All the late rebel States, and some of the
Northern States, attest the rising power of the
Democratic party. It is neither honest nor
prudent to underestimate the power of an enemy,
and we do not assent to any such folly in
respect to this superlative enemy, which, indeed,
combines the malice of a whole nation
against our race. It embraces and hurls
against us all the Irish animosity of the North,
and all the malice of disappointed ambition and
au overthrown rebellion in every rebel State.
The triumphs of that party are marked by increased
contempt for our rights and our manhood
everywhere, and in most of the Southern
States with bloody Ku-Klux persecution.
Could that party have been iu the ascendant
during the late elections but few, if any, colored
voters, notwithstanding the law, would have
been permitted to have cast a ballot. Yet this
party does not despair of ultimately so shaping
political events as to obtain a large share of
colored voters, and by means of these obtain
the Presidency in 1872. Cajolery and intimidation
are its means in the South, and ignoring
the old issues is its policy at the North.
With a craftiness which would be admirable
in a good cause, the leaders of the Democratic
party have been endeavoring by various expedients
to split, divide, and distract the Republican
party. Estimable Republicans have
been drawn into schemes with taking names by
the wiles of these leaders, with a view to a rupture
of the Republican party. "Civil service
reform/' "revenue reform," "labor reform,"
"temperance reform," have all been made to
serve the ends of a party that never did, never
will, and never can reform anything, but which,
from the nature of its elements, made up, as it
is, mainly of the malign and reckless portion
of the people, must be the bulwark of every
social and political abuse, and the stronghold
of every ancient wrong in the community.
While there are many bad men in the Republican
party, there is no question that it contains
a vastly larger percentage of the better qualities
of the American people than the Democratic
party; that, in fact, it drew into it, by
its loyalty and patriotism in the nation's trialhour,
the best men the country has to give to
any party. But we need not stay to speak of
this at this point.
The Republican leaders in the present Congress
have an occasion on which, and a cause
for which, to exercise all their wisdom, firmness,
and statesmanship. The country needs
this, and the efficiency and permanence of the
party itself require it. The trouble would be
less serious if the Republican party bad to contend
with open and undisguised enemies, or with
the natural antagonisms of rival interests?such
as free trade and tariff". The trouble is deeper
down than this. There are, unhappily, rival
ambitions and pretensions to be dealt with and
disposed of, wisely and firmly ; and it remains
to be seen whether the Republican party in
Congress has the courage to apply unflinching
ly the obvious and necessary principles to the
case in hand.
The worst of all foes are those of one's household.
Often the very men who have been most
petted and exalted are the first to plunge the
dagger of treachery and ingratitude into the
heart of the party which has lifted them from
the depths of obscurity to the height of public
honor and distinction. There is but one proper
way of dealing with all such, and that is to
unmask them and cast them out, send them
where they belong, and have done with them.
While parties are not absolute, and may at
proper times be disbanded, there are honorable
ways of asserting individual independence as
igainst parties, and honorable ways for disbanding
them. We should tolerate no dallying,
ao playing fast and loose. An offense against
the Republican party committed, no matter
how far from the capital of the nation, is an
affense against the party in every part of the
nation, and should be so regarded and treated.
Hie body is more important than any one or
,wo of its members. *' If thy right hand offend
-hee cut it off," is as good in politics as in
norals; and what is done should be done
jromptly. There should bo no hesitation in
lealing with traitors who remain with us only
;he better to injure us and to serve tbe enemy.
Hesitation only encourages audacity and
ncreases the mischief to bo avoided or remedied.
IVben a man is not for us he is against us, and
.he wisest course is to make short work with
lim, and send him to his own place. The Cowins,
the Dixons, tho Doolitti.ks, and the
Johnsons did the Republican party iucompara1_

)f the enemy and drew his sword for the rebelion.
Their example should not be lost upon
is, nor upon their imitators. There is but one
vay to maintain the integrity and efficiency of
tny political party; aud that is, while allowing
die widest range of freedom to its individual
nemberg in discussion, to demand unanimity
ind conformity in party action.

as iudced would also the wondrcusly-gifted
Wendell Phillips, who led astray twenty
thousand votes in Massachusetts. Rut these j
gentlemen arc open and honorable in their opposition
to the Republican party; and the
effect of their political action is in nowise so
damaging as is that of Messrs. Sciiurz, Brown.
Cox, and others, who, in the name of fidelity to
the Republican cause, give victory to its enemies.
It may be said that something is due these gen
tlemen for past services ; that they were faithful
; in the hour of the nation's greatest need ; that
they are able and eloquent men, distinguished
for rectitude of character and purity of intention,
and much else of the same sort. In
answer wo can only point to our cause belt
rayed in Missouri; to North Carolina in the
hands of the Ku-Klux ; to Tennessee, unsafe in
many parts ofit for a Union man outside of his
door after nightfall; to Virginia, given over to
the Democratic party, and only decent because
i within reach of federal power; to Florida,
scarcely saved ; to Alabama, so far gone from
' j the Union and loyalty that there is no shadow
: of hope that she will return in a generation ;
1 , to Georgia, in much the same condition, and the
1 , list might be increased. What has done this?
j Unquestionably one agent in this mischief has
been the absence of that wholesome discipline
in the Republican party that makes every man
1 feel his personal responsibility to the party,
and that he cannot play fast and loose in it with
impunity. The Republican party is either
worth preserving or it is tit only to be destroyed.
' ! If the former, we cannot guard it too eare|
fully or support it too stringently, if the latter,
let us have a manly call for its disbandment or
its reconstruction, and have its remains honorably
disposed of. Rut while it exists, while we
are connected with it, let us at least be true to
its claims upon us, and not wear our relation
to it only as a cloak to conceal the dagger with

who mean to maintain the Republican party,
not only for the good it has done, but for the

and earnest support of the national organization,
of which he is the able and true, as well

Casting Its Shadow Before.
The Legislature elected by the Ku-Klux
rebels of North Carolina assembled at Raleigh
on Monday, the 21st ultimo. Its organization
illustrates its character and purpose. One W.
L. Saunders, chief of the " Invisible Empire,"
the name the Ku-Klux assassins have
assumed, was elected Secretary of the Senate, :
and T. J. Davis, a member of the same treasonable
organization, was elected Speaker of
the House. Roth branches of the Legislature
of North Carolina are, therefore, under the
control of, and their course will be dictated by,
that treasonable band of conspirators. Having
commenced its work by thus casting its shadow
before it, no one will be surprised at any
treasonable work the Legislature may do.
One of its acts was to adjourn for the
purpose of attending the Lee memorial service,
and ordering the American flag on the State
1 Capital raised at half-mast in honor of the archj
traitor. Every public building was draped in
! mourning during the ceremonies, and the Odd|
Fellows, Masons, fire companies, Sabbath
schools, and members of the Legislature formed
| the procession. Ex Governor Vance, one of
the rankest traitors daring the rebellion, and
still unrcpeutant and malignant, delivered the
panegyric upon the dead traitor.
For his treasonable services against the Government
Yancf. has sinoe been elected to the
United States Senate, though ineligible, as he
and those who elected him know. His animosity
to the Government has been so bitter
' that he has steadily refused to ask for the removal
of his disabilities; and he and his
rebel party have now resolved to defy the laws
of Congress designed to keep such " pestilent
fellows out of its halls."
This is what the Ku-Iviux Legislature of the
i State has already done, and it very clearly fore- j
shadows what it is still resolved to do. It gives
the country fair warning that the rebels of North
Carolina are still in arms against the Government
and still fighting for the "lost cause."
i Their next step in this direction will he the
impeachment and removal of the loyal Uovj
ernor and Supreme Judges of the State. They
threatened this revolutionary movement immediately
after the election. Their organization of
the Legislature in the interest and by the KuIvlux
assassins, their deification of tlie traitor
Lee, and the election of even a worse traitor,
if that were possible, to the Senate of the Uni- j
ted States, leave not the slightest room to I
doubt that they will carry out the threat to the
very letter. This measure is necessary to give
them absolute, uncontrolled power to carry out j
their other wicked plans ; aud the}' ar .> not the 1
men, as they have proved, to scruple at any crime
which will promote their conspiracy against
the Government.
The State of North Carolina has been lost to i
! the Republican party by the votes of loyal men.
The les3on which the Legislature, thus brought .
| into power, is teaching the country?if not that
taught by Tennessee, Georgia, and Virginia? !
should well warn nil intelligent and honest Re,
publicans again3t being caught in this rebel
' trap hereafter. There is not an instance in
which either individual Republicans or the
country have gained anything by such a change
of rulers. On the contrary, they have always ;
been cheated, and lost the ground they posi
sessed.
The only safety of the people, therefore, is j
i in faithfully adhering to the Republican party, |
and looking to it for the protection of their
rights. If abases have crept into it, insist on
their correction. To aid their opponents into
power for some personal reason would be us
, foolish and wicked as for soldiers in the field to
desert their flag aud go over to the enemy be- i
I ti : _ i -L ?* . . - I
cause mcy imagiucu uieir omeers might not always

That would be treason as well as stupidity.

St. ENuil's Racbelor Views. 11
tfY F. U. FI.KTCHKK.
i I
In the E a a of November 24th is an extract
frcia the Independent, to be found under the
above caption. We peruaed^it attentively, being
among thoae who not only greatly esteem the
ordination and work of th<* great Apostle, but,
confess, to ability as well as caruestnoss. But
though the article is from the pen of one who,
besides planning his campaign, lights it out, we i
realized our worst fears that the views would
be entirely misinterpreted. Indeed, they not
only misrepresent, but make the Apostle to talk
foolishness. Does this greatest of Apostles
talk foolishness, or is it that Mr. Tilton, like
the Turks at the battle of the Pyramids, has ;
fixed his guns in the wrong direction 7 urdinarily
we would not attack the views of one so
powerful as he without better information and
more experience in abstract matters ; but he
has gone from his castle, not upon the open
plain, but into the castle of another, even into
the castle of the consistency of God's Word,
lie swings a trenchant blade, but it cuts the air
only. He gallantly strikes where he thinks '
the enemy is, but it is random work, and shows I
he docs not know how to discern him.
In short, we agree that the proposition to (
settle social questions by Scriptural quotations
will fail : 1st. As all Scriptural precepts enjoining
rules of conduct are especially to the '
peculiar people of God. I2d. That t hese Scriptures
distinctly define the difference between I
the people of God and the people of this world.
3d. That these divisions represent natures diametrically
opposed,us good and evil. 4th. The
application can only liinitedly apply, and that
because af the greater truth of Christianity.
5th. St. Paul's letter is to the peculiar people
of God, and not to the world.
At the outset the Independent misses the
mark, inasmuch as Paul did not write to settle
social questions at large, and is therefore free
from the imputed inconsistency which men
take of the Scriptures to make them prove
anything. Paul did not write to the whole city
of Corinth, but to the class designated in Chap- j
ter I, verses 1 and 2. In the tenth verse the
object of the letter is stated, and in the whole
chapter he distinguishes between the people of
God and the people of the world. (See 21st to
30th verses, especially to this point.) Is this
hard to understand, or does lie fail to designate
this peculiar people in the closing verses of the ;
chapter? IIow, then, can his teaching apply
to the world at large unless by gross misap- j
prehension of this distinction? This, indeed,
brings primitive and true Christianity into
direct antagonism with the views held by Mr.
Tilton. But this distinction is easily pointed
out in all the sacred works, and the evidence of
its truth committed only to hearts regenerated
by the spirit of God. These teachings do not
apply to the world, and cannot but liniitedlv
apply, if at all, because the spirit of the world
is in antagonism to the spirit of Grace. Ilead
the 2d chapter, 12th verse, also the 13th, and
finish the chapter if yet any doubt remains of
the character of the poople addressed, if yet
there remains doubt, read Titus, 2d chapter,
11th to 15th verses, and Romans, 12th chapter,
2d verse, all among his writings, and proving
rather conclusively that he knew what he was
about.
Paul wrote to settle social difficulties in the ,
church, and by the first verse of the 7th chapter
we find it in answer to a letter upon tho subject
of marriage and divorce?a delicate subject
even in the church. Question : Roes he rec- j
ommend unconditional celibacy ? We answer
emphatically, Xo ! and cite the ninth verse in
proof, having previously said in substance that
the tendency to marriage is a gift to men, and
lays down the principle that ditl'erent gifts tend
to different actions. lie advocates celibacy,
not for the world, bat for the church, on only i
one reason?a great reason indeed to the church,
but doubtless to many of the world a foolish
one. See the i>2d verse, in which he shows j
how celibacy may be improved by greater sanctification
and less worldly care in the apprecia- '
tion of that privilege. In the spirit of Christian
teaching, then, his asseveration, 44 It is
good for them if they abide eren as I," was
correct, in that it was good, because marriage
to a degree hindered complete sanctification, i
and celibacy promoted it. In no other place
does he say celibacy is good ; and here it is
abstinence, commended for greater good only.
Is this against Lis experience? (See the 7th
and 9tli verses.) Is it against common experience?
Nay, nay ! Though it is not given to
the guardians of common experience, but, the !
truth, it could not be contrary to rightful experience,
because it results from the only spirit j
which discerns the things of the heart, and
shows man as he is and how he is situated.
We could elaborate here with profit to prove
that Paul had the true wisdom of tha motfo.
- IUUVIU.
Paul not only advocated celibacy for a re ison
unknown to the world and for a greater good,
but he was an unconditional advocate of marriage,
and a firm opponent of marital separation.
lie does not consider that the faithful
should go to law?vide the sixth or preceding
chapter?and so we rule out the term divorce.
Indeed, always consistent in his teaching, we
think he would have denied ami reprimanded
an attempt to seek separation of the law. lu
considering his views of marital separation, we
find Paul dividing married believers into two
classes?to whom the Lord speaks and to whom
he speaks?being, respectively, first and second, j
The first class are instructed in the 10th and I 1
11th verses; the second class in the 12th to loth
verses, inclusive. The first class are those
where both couples are believers ; the second
class are those where one of the couple is an
unbeliever. Now, we notice that from the 10th
to 18th verses in only one place he allows marital
separation. It is in the 15th verse, but
as unlike the rendition of the extract from the 1
Independent as to be entirely unlike it. This
is plain that all believers arc enjoined not to 1
bieak the marriage condition?in the language !
of the 17th verse, to remain in the calling I
wherewith they are called?and the responsibility
of the separation is entirely thrown upon '
the unbelieving partners, who are to be permit- 1
ted to depart if they desire to, and not to be '
hindered; for the Lord hath called us to '
peace, and the brother or sister is not in such 1
_ _ /r.r. . '
cases ^? nat cases"/ UI marriage or Bepara- 1
tion? Of separation, wo answer) in bondage.
Mr. Tilton renders this 15th verso: 44 If," he '
says, 44 the unbelieving husband or wife seeks
for a divorce, let it not be hindered ; for in such
cases the unbelieving husband or wife is not
bound to remain under the yoke," and excuses
the unbeliever. If he strike out unbelieving, and
substitute the words of the text, 44 brother and 1
sister," Paul will be made to talk consistently, t
us he dues. For, if because of difference of i
religion he permitted separation, he would en- t
snare theui, as witness the 35th verse. But i
the unalterable tenor of his instructions is for c
the believer to stand firm by the marriage rela- ^
tion; for them to marry, rather than burn, to i
i -
>(' rnuctci!. Moreover, l'aul teatht a nut < nly
hat the believer should give no o.Ten< > to the
inbeliever, but points to the very quieseene of
the believer to keep pcaee, a3an <?pp Ttunity for
[iod's mysterious providence in that the unbelieving
husband Or wife might be converted. and
at least get good fiom the believing partner.
Consequently it is gratuitous to speak oi
Paul's intolerance, or of the spirit of this reli
gion, which teaches sublime morality to be attained
by obedience to the commando ui God.
I know the able editor of the Independent to
be a tirui champion of morality. I have listened
to his precepts in our Lyceum, and always,
when I can. 1 goto get refreshed at the fountain
of his wisdom. Vet here I see him losing
one of the grand, endearing lessons of Christianity?patience
and meekness to do good by faith
in God's providence. This is above ordinary
moral precept; and this vein, by which the
spirit gives its soft color and gennine strength !
to virtually build up man's nature in righteous
ness, run* through the whole Scriptures, and
enters into their interpretation as of a language
and a people f ?reign to the inhabitants of this
world.
Of course we argue this case as of experience,
believing, among evidence, that the Christian
religion emanating from God must be perfect
in its adaptation to the Church in all time, j
under like circumstances, and take to witness !
the address of Paul, which, we rejoice, includes ;
us. un tiio contrary, tiie editor argue.* from
observation, anil does not understand that opinion
to-day is governed by opinion nearly nineteen
hundred years old. In the world it is not
so ; but in the Church, as kuown by Scripture !
teaching, there is r.o change, the institution j
being perfect, and comprehending and suiting
the cases of alH-rod's people. And though we
confess there is little externally of the Church
to show the rigid observance required by the
rigid early teaching, 1 cannot agree that Paul
to-day would annul his instructions relative to
marriage. The Church may have changed, the
peculiar people may be swallowed in the bodypolitic,
but the truth of God must stand, and
the evidence of conversion and Christian walk
not differ from that laid out in the New Testament.
This is the masonry of Christianity to 1
detect the work of the Spirit. These are the
same, and certainly must be the instructions.
And, however we rescue Paul from inconsistent
advocation, we could desire that histpfipliirtfr

well subsoiled by the spirit of righteousness,
to bring fortli fruit. But, ere we arrive at bis
memorable chapter on marriage, he shows why
this cannot be, because of an essential and individual
work preliminary. If, also, the jerfeetion
of the Gospel shows the statesmanship
of the head of the Church, it must also witness
for its teachers, and there be consistency in all
that appertains to it. It is so with the evidence?not
in observation, hut in spirit. We
conclude, then, our defence of the precious !
Scriptures and their teaching, because they to
us are more than all we know by the senses,
and contain salvation ; because by them is real
vital good to men, and of them is known our
true relation to the Creator.

LKTTIilfiS FROM TIIE PEOPLE.
** The New Village."
Potomac City, P. C., Dee. -r>, 1S70.
To the Editor of the New National Era :
On Thursday evening, December 12, a larce
concourse of people met at the Howard School
llouse of " Potomac City," to witness the presentation
of an organ to the children of the
Pioneer Sunday School.
The room was thronged. Kverv available spot
where a human being could find lodgment was
appropriated, and numbers were obliged to remain
outside.
The audience embraced at once the greatest
and the least of America's citizens. It numbered
one whose name is known wherever the
English language is spoken. It embraced as
well the untaught freedrnan, the knowledge
of whose existence is limited to his own hearthstone.
The presentation address, by Mr. Lewis
Douglass, was truly characteristic?brief, comprehensive,
and to the point.
The reply, by the superintendent, S. G.
Brown, was in harmony with the address;
the " hushed household, the desert-like stillness"
pervading amid the packed assemblage,
was testimony that all who listened were interested
and well entertained.
The organ, under the manipulations of Mrs.
Lewis Douglass, discoursed sweet music, while
the trained voices of the Sunday School choir
were in striet accord with its melody.
One ot the pleasing and long-to be-remeinbered
features of the evening's entertainment
was the music, vocal and instrumental, by the
choir of the Asbury Sunday Seliool, of Washington
city.

lifluous strains of the human voice, could not
have been indifferent; his heart would have
melted while listening to the concord of .sweet
sounds.
The evening was one of the brightest, everything
seemed to combine to enkindle joy in the
veins of all present.
The lion. Frederick Douglass, the Representative
man of his race, the intellectual embodiment
of his people, was unanimously called
upon for a "speech."
While he was speaking these words came to
mind : ''llis Minerva is born in panoply. * *
You never catch his mind in an undress, lie
brings his total wealth into company, and
gravely unpacks it. His riches are ulway9
about him. * * lie always keeps the path.
You cannot make excursions with him, for he !
gets you right. * * His morality never abates. !
He cannot compromise, or ut derstand middle
actions. There can be but a right and a wrong.
His conversation is a book.
The speeches on the part of the Reverend
gentlemen, Messrs. Draper and Arnold, together
with those of Mr. S. L. Sleigh, Mr. 1?. T. Hell,
and Mr. Joseph Ambush, wi re loudly applauded.
This enter tain me lit over, the emwd was invi- '
ted to another f ast, tastefully and temptingly
spread out, in an adjacent room. The utmost
good feeling prevailed.

Sir : lleing highly pleased with the New
National Pka, and the manner in which it is
conducted, 1 thought 1 would write you a letter,
expressing my pleasure that we have once more ;
1 newspaper that we can point to with pride
is a sample of what the colored people are
:apable of doing as freemen and citizens. The
*ant of mch a paper has been long felt, and 1
ts appearance at this time, with the 44Old i 1
ent, of course a part would have to he Demo- ; j
crats and a part Republicans. Well, this j,
may (?) he all very good in its place, hut such e
14 advice" comes with a very had grace from a a
man who has endeavored all his life to keep ^
this same class of persons under foot, hut who ~
have (in spite of all his efforts to keep them r
down) been raised to the dignity of citizens; s
and I think the best tiling in consistency that ^
Mr. Vallundigham can do in this matter will .
he to keep silent, so far as giving advice to ! v
colored voters is concerned. We have got our r
privileges without his assistance, (and in spite a
of his opposition,) and, with tJod's help, we j |
will exercise them without his advice. More a

We have elected three members of Congress out 1
of live, and a majority of twelve on joint ballot, j
nine in the House and three in the Senate:
thus insuring us a Republican United States
Senator for seven years from the 4th of March
next. We lost our candidate in the Second
Congressional District through the disaffection
of the party in one of the counties, who would
not vote the straight ticket because one of their
own men, who was a candidate, did not get the
nomination. The county, hitherto Republican
by a majority of six or seven hundred, gave him
barely a majority. Burlington county is its
name, and the nominee is Hon. Win. A. Newell,
ex-Governor of the State, and one of the ablest
and most influential men in the State.
The colored troops fought bravely, and voted
al .iost a solid ticket. By the colored vote the :
victory was achieved. The party is entirely j '
too conservative in this State. They still ignore (
the propriety and necessity of colored men hold- I
ing office. This policy they will have to inaug- <
urate if thev would in the future consolidate ;
I
and secure the colored vote. Some of the
emoluments we are entitled to and must have. t
They arc doubtless knowing to the fact that we t
hold the balance of power, and that we have *
some men among us qualified to fill some of the '
positious sought after, and that we are entitled t
to consideration according to our quota of repre- i
saltation. j 1
Let us have fair play, and we will be found | J
firm and reliable. The fidelity of the colored j <
man cannot be depended on any longer than i
they deal justly and honestly with him. I hope
they will see this, and act accordingly, by hoist- ;
ing the Radical flag until Conservatism is driven
out of the ranks. Then will we have a ,
strong, united, and victorious party, who will j ]
have learned in time the good old maxim that ; 1

by justin m oarthy. j
Close to Avignon, the old city of the Popes, c
there is a white marble tomb, raised by a Kng- .
lishman to the memory of an Kngliswoman who ^
lies beneath, and whom he loved with a love
romantic as that of a medimval chevalier, rev
erential and sacred as the homage of a votary |
at a shrine. I know of no words, in any litera- j t
ture, more pathetic than those in which the :
bereaved husband has recorded his deep love L
for the lost wife. 1 know of no panegyric ever
lavished by poet on his mistress more exulted j
than that he has devoted to her virtues and her t
genius. Nothing half so full of genuine love
and homage is contained in the mellifluous lines {
of the great poet whose fantastic passion is ul-!
ways associated with that famed Vuncluse t
which he is to wear. To me the the love and , i
sorrow of Petrarch are nothing like so touch- j
ing as the love and the sorrow of John Stuart ,{
Mill for a wife who is buried at Avignon.

0 Mr. Mill. Of late he has accepted all the
opposed duties of Parliamentary life cordially

J ni 1 ...
iu luuceu uoes uiausroue; but Mr. Mill's ap
jearance is at first rather a trial to the enthu
liast. It 811 ? pests 110 idea to the mind but that
if elderly and commonplace respectability,
[laid, clean-shaven, neat and prim of uttire.
dr. Mill looks a model old bachelor of a c ram
formal ami nearly obsolete kind. JUis face
9 thin, aquiline, blooeless, without remjrkable
fxprcssion of any kind ; he has a perpetual and
lervcus movement of the lips and eyes; he is
lomewhat diiiii.cot and constrained in manner
it is, in short, anything but what oue miglit
>xpeet the daring thinker, the profound scholar,
he fearless politician, the passionate lover of
iberty and light to be. Indeed, the contraiiction
is more than one of outward appearmce,
How came such a man to be, above all
hings, a political economist?
Carl vie calls political economy "a science
vithout bowels"?an absurd phrase enough,
vhich might just as well be applied to geomery
or chemistry; hut there is certainly a
lepth of emotion, of sensitiveness, of sentiment,
f ywill, in the character of Stuart Mill,
vhicn always makes one wonder how it was
ic became a votary of any science of life which
efuses to accept leeling as one of its conditions,
t is quite true that the peculiarity of his nature
ias done much to reconcile the somewhat reuctant
minds of his countrymen to the great,
a test-born science of which he is the highest
xponeot. We hear very little about tho dry
tul selfish character of political economy since
ilill became its spokesman. But where Mill
^oes wrong in science or politics he goes
rrong because of his heart, not because of his
aind. One noble error, one magnificent defect,
eems to show itself almost everywhere in
dill's writing and speiking. lie sees men not
,s they are, but as he himself is. Not only is
to a profound believer in the supremacy everyvheie
of man's self control and moral jndgonent
; but he does n ?t seem to understand huw
inybu iy can think otherwise. Doctrines and
heo: s of his which make many people in
lngia..d smile, and cause many more to feel
ingry, spring directly out of this peculiarity of
dill's mind. He is himself a man of singularly
mre and transparent character; his nature
leems always to obey at once the touch of tho
udder of conscience and duty ; whenever he
hiitks that he ought to do a thing, he does it
vithout reluctance or shrinking?it is nothing
or him t.? stand alone against the world, if
leed be ; and he cannot see why all men should
iot be th} same. Thus it happens that the
nan cf penetrating, conquering inind, the inas;er
of irresistible logic, sometimes becomes a
Ireamer, an optimist, a visionary, when he has
deal with the ways and possibilities of men.
Mr. Mill's influence in the practical lite of
politics is indeed a singular illustration of the
riumpn or inieuect and moral character over
ihysieal defects, and over the disadvantages of
surly training and long settled habits, lie has
10 physical quality which a speaker ought to
lave, llis voice is very weak and thin ; his
irticuiation is defective ; his bearing is angular
md awkward ; he is shy, and he speaks too fast;
it is often a considerable effort with hiin to
nuke himself audible at all. More than once
le has come to a dead pause when addressing
ir trying to address the House of Commons,
ind has seemed as if he positively could not go
iu. Moreover, the matter of his speeches is too
jlose and compressed, the reasoning is too compactly
welded together, fur the attention of any
ludience. There must be some surplusage in
the eloquence of the mcst concise and nervous
[>f orators if he would carry his hearers with
lim at all. Mill's speeches are masterpieces
if reasoning?to read ; but they are a terrible
'train on the intellect of the listener who does
his best to keep up with their argument. Need
it be said that the House of Commons in
iral does not give itself much trouble to fouow
ihcir meaning? Of late, since the novelty of
Mr. Mill's appearance in the House has worn
)!!', he has had but little attention paid to his
mecches at the time nf their nttnr..?/>A t? ...

they produce their etfeet, nevertheless. They *"
ire read ; they set people thinking ; they find
their way into the mind and the heart of the
country ; not one of them has failed to wake an
jcho. Some of them only wanted voice, and
manner, and energy?elocution, in fact?to be
magnificent orations.
I think the few sentences spoken by Mr. Mill
it the public breakfast given in London to William
Lloyd Garrison were, in their way, as fine
x specimen of eloquence (lacking elocution) ns
ever I heard. It is not too much to say that
tie has sometimes strayed, or overturned, the
whole current of public feeling in Kngland by
x speech, lie has, indeed, 44 gone wrong" more
than once, and much displeased some of his political
associates ; by his opposition to the ballot,
for example; his advocacy of what we call
in England the '4 three cornered constituents
and his vindication of the punishment of
leath. But Mill's niind is far too energetic,
ndependent and original to run always in the
groove of any party; and 1 own that, while 1
think him wrong on each of these questions, I
ilso think rather too much complaint has been
made on the subject by souie of our leading
Liberals. Remembering what Mill lias done
or reform, for the cause of freedom and uuion
n America, for the cause of Ireland, merely
since his entering into public life, I tbink it rather
a pity that any of his friends should lay
nueh stress on his heresy with regard to the
)allot or his toleration of capital punishment.
Observe that he has gone wrong (as we say) ou
hese two questions just because of that gener>us
weakness I spoke of. A tiiau ought to vote
ipenly and honestly, and scorn all consciences.
Therefore, Mill, mentally dealing
it ith ideal creatures, will hare no secret voting.

u shame and wickedness ; therefore, Miil.pityag
tlie criminal, will have him mercifully put

loubt; but very character, at. e of certain moods
?f the mind of Stuart Mill.
Mr. Mill is one of the very few Englishmen I
lave ever heard of or known who are at once
uasters of science ar.d of literature, of Greek
md ot German. Usually with us, the seientiIc
scholar knows little of literature and the
irts; the literary man cure* little about science;
lie profound student of Hotn^r, Sophocles and
iirgil knows little of Goethe, Lessing, and
ihchte. Mr. Mid loves all, and studies all,
aid comprehends all. He has written of i'lato
is lew otiier men could; and I have never read
ubtler, finer, truer expositions than he .has
;iven of some of the deepest thoughts in Goethe.
le has written of flfturpra an.l Af ot-.M ~ -

>s of economies aud politics. 1 know of notkng
finer than his analysis of the poetic nature
f Alfred tie Vigny, Except perhaps his analyis
of the political character and influence of
krmaud Carrel. Let me add that, with all his
tudy of the great minds, he finds time to know
omething of the small. I can tell of writers
fbo, young to their work, and only beginning
o try hard to get the public ear, have been unxpectedly
cheered uud gladdened by hearing
hat the eye of John Mill had rested kindly on
that tluy had written, never dreaming of such
reader ; and that his voice hud spoken words
f approval aud encouragement. A great Engishinan
once said to me : 411 don't know how it
s; but, while other leading men have admirers,
Till has devotees.'' The explanation, I think,
s to he found in the moral nature of the man
s much as in his noble intellect. So much
weetness and puritv*, so much chivalrous and
oiuautic emotion, joined with so commanding
power of thought and so fearless a will, deervo
and naturally attract something that may
rell be called reverence.?Boston CommoJilealth.

A daughter of Mr. Colville, of the Olympic

tudyiog to develop on the opaiatic stage.
uuu iu mo ouo sacreu lonio. livery one wbo j
reads at all has read or heard of the tribute of
lofty and pathetic eloquence which Mill paid to v
the goodness and the genius of his wife, and (
which serves as an introduction to the Kssay g
on Liberty." Was Mrs. Mill all that her husband
describes her? llad she an intellect iui- *
measurably superior to his own ? Was hers, s
as in another passage he declares, a mind equal v
to that of Shakespeare or 1'iato ? Surely not. t
Such minds cannot die and make no sign. e
t here never were any mute, inglorious Miltous. ,
Hut it is certain that Stuart Mill believes every w
word he has written of his lost wife to be the
exaggerated truth. And it is certain that in ^
the heart of the great political economist burned j
a love passing that ot Abelard; that in his feeble,
attenuated frame lives a spirit as chivalric ^
and fearless as ever slowed under the t
plate of a Bayard. t
1 believe John Stuart Mill to be, on the ^
whole, the most remarkable Englishman now
liviug. 1 do not venture to say he is the greatest,
although he probably is. But L am con- yi
vinced that he is the most remarkable?taking
mind, and character, and heart?the most inde u
pendent, original, unconventional man of his
day ; the one who goes nearest to possessing
that ideal combination of the masculine and
the feminine qualities which I suppose would .
make the perfect man. Of his intellect i need v
hardly speak. Mill is quite as much read and ^
admired in America as ho is in his own coun- j *
try; and his influence is perhaps even more '
directly and generally acknowledged hero than
there. I rather wish to say something of the
man personally, us he is one whom America is '[
never likely to see ; and who, until lately, was t,
almost absolutely unknown to his own country-1 3,

knowing th.it y??u would ok'* to hear from
youi correspondents the opinh ns of the people j t
in their respective communities upon the po- 1
litical questions of the day, I will proceed to I
*4 jot" dovrn a few " items" in regard to some *
of the subjects that are mostly talked of just p
now. I will commence by referring to the t
"Cox imbroglio,'" out of which some of the t
Republican and all of the Democratic papers
arc trying to make so much political capital at
the expense of the President. I iiud that, ;
while a few of the Republicans lier< have been |
blinded into taking sides with the Secretary. ! '
(through his loud protestations of " reform" in *
bis Department,) yet the largest portion of;,
tliem sec through the flimsy guise, and mean p
to stand by the Executive until they see some 1
better reasons for deserting him than Mr. Cox
and his friends would imply. The fact is, Mr. j
Cox's present attitude corresponds with his j 1
actions in the past. His political record, never ; J
very bright, grows darker with each inove he 1
makes in politics : ar.d those of us who remom- r
ber bis cowardly attempt to smother the ne- ?
gro suffrage agitation (in his reply to the 1
"Oberlin" letter) can well understand why he *
is now, as ever, 44 in the right church, but iu j
the wrong pew?i. e., a Democrat in Hepubli I (

Apropos of politics, I notice that Mr. Val- 1
landigham, in a speeeh delivered at Dayton, ^
Ohio, October 12,1870, felt called upon to give v
the colored voters some " good advice" as to t
how they should conduct themselves as voters c
and citizens! lie advised them 4' not to vote
X
as a distinct body," but 44 divide up among the j j
different political parties." Now, as there are r
but two political parties in this country at pres- 1
