nitrate of silver and other remedies, without any op
parentefTect. For fifteen day. we guarded bis linurui,
lest with them he should tear open the festering and
corrupt wound which covered his whole face. Hav
ing tried every thing else we had any hope from, we
begun giving your oarsapakilla, and applying
the iodide of potash lotion, as you direct. The sore
began to heal when we had given the first bottle,
and was well when we had finished the second. The

"Dk. Aykr My dear Sir: I have found your
Sausaparilla an excellent remedy for Syphilis,

Tbe President requires me peopie oi me ro

determine wbiob of tbe two pUcs is the lest
arbitrary and uooonit tut'onal , if indeed degrees
of comparison may be allowed to pertain to so
absolute a pitch of lawlettoeet. For oat owa

Nieio SoLDir.ii in Wooitib. Oa Saturday
last, our town wat honored for a few moment!
by tbe presenoe of a regiment ot oolored sol
di) rd, who were on tbeir wty from Ctmp Dela
ware to rortreit iVUnroe. They wereotujired
partly by white men, and we presume nude a
flue and- toldierly appearance, though lodging
from a Democratic point of. view we "couldn't
tee.it." io. our nnappteoiaxive tyei, tbey
pretty generally bore a strong retemb'.anee to
niact uiii, wnen he has on bit "trgsr clothes."
While the oari waited, tbe niggets snouted
loudly for Brough, and In the Intervals, ques
tioned tbe little boyt around Ibe depot if they
"bad any pretty white titttrt at home." aBd
begged tbe glrli to "kill them." These ire
tome of tbe first lenont the Abolitionists are
teaching tbem. It it a pity tome of tbe leading
men of that persuasion bad not bten at tbt
depot on Saturday, to satisfy the inquiries of
meooiorea brethren.
Befort tbe departure of tbe cars, a fight oo-
ourred between tome or tbe toldlert and one
cr two Irishmen. McGowan, a well known
irishman of Wooiter, attempting to make
petoa between them, one of tbe valiant tons of
Htm thnsta bayonet Into blm, tearing bit
coat, and giving him a toratoh under tbe arm.
Tbe nigger wat justified In tbe action by Re
publican, about tawo, ai he was a nigger, tnd
the man be a-saul ted "only an Irishman." at the
Abolitionists expressed it. VYayat Coarnfy
