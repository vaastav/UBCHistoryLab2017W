Perhaps Carnegie's offer to give the
government $10,000,000 for the purpose of j
establishing a university at Washing
ton is brought about by a feeling that
he owes something to a country which
helped him to amass a great fortune by
shielding from competition through the
medium of a protective tariff. If this
be the case, his will be about the largest
contribution the conscience fund has
ever received.
That kind of currency known as Sher
man notes will soon be wiped out by the
retirement process, and the country will
have one less kind of money. We are
told by the director of the mint in his
cnnual report that the Sherman notes
are in process of rapid extinction. Dur
ing the year th amount of bullion pur
chased under the Sherman law has de
creased from 83,268,054 ouuces to 52,562,-
623, the difference representing the
amount that has been coined into silver
dollars. As the director says, the coin
age of this bullion has been accelerated
in order that the treasury might be
able to retire the treasury notes issued
in its purchase. So the silver dollars
have taken the place of the notes. And
the process of redemption is still going
n. There la enough bullion on hand to
retire them all. with a margin suffi
cient to allow the coining of about $20,-
C'iO.000 of subsidiary coin. The director
of the mint suggests that when the
notes are redeemed it would be well
to give over coining silver dollars alto
gether, to raise the limit of subsidiary
currency from $100,000,000 to $120,000,000,
end to use the balance of the bullion
purchased under the Sherman act for
subsidiary purposes.

Commissioner Bockhill Submits
Report to Congress
Showing the Gofernnient's Part
in Chinese Negotiations.
STOOD BETWEEN THEM
Prevented Other CountriesFrom
Imposing Hard Lines.
Pushed the Chinese Into Ac
ceptance of Terms Offered.'
Washington, D. C. Deo. 12. The
long - expected report of Special
Commissioner Rockhill to the secretary
of state on the results of his work in
connection with the Chinese 'negotia
tions in Pekin has been submitted to
congress, along with the full text of the
protocol, whicn has been already pub
lished, and a mass, of detailed state
ments. It was upon this report that the
president based his commendatory ref
erence to Mr. Rockhill's work in his
recently published message to congress.
Beginning by detailing the conditions
under which he came to be appointed in
July, 1900, United Slates commissioner
to China, Mr. Rockhill tells of visits he
made to the viceroys of Shanghai and
Wu Chang, which he said did not a lit
tle to further the interests of peace. Mr.
Rockhill says he fully concurred in all
the measures that Minister Conger had
been and was advocating. These nego
tiations extended over a period of four
teen months, and Mr. Rockhill thus
summarizes the results in addressing
Secretary Hay:
"The circular note which you tele
graphed on July 3, 1900, to our embas
sies in Europe and to our missions in
Vienna, Brussels, Madrid, Tokio, ine
Haerue. and Lisbon, defined the policy
already then adopted by the United
States in the settlement of aftalrs in
China, and from which thev never de
parted. Bearing these instructions al
ways in mind, the task of the agents of
our government in Pekin was a com
paratively easy one. Throughout the
negotiations our obiect was to use the
influence of our government in the in
terest of Justice and moderation and in
a spirit of equal friendship to the powers
negotiating Jointly with us and the cm
nese nation.
"The twelve demands made by the
powers on China, the accomplishment
of which was deemed necessary for the
restoration of normal relations with
that country, and which were embodied
in the iolnt note of December zz. 1900,
may be classified under four principal
heads:
"1. Adeauate punishment for the au
thors of and those guilty of actual par
ticipation in the anti-foreign massa
cres and riots.
'2. The adoption of measures neces
sary to prevent their recurrence.
3. The indemnification for losses sua
tained by states and foreigners through
these riots.
'4. The improvement of our relations
both official and commercial with the
Chinese government and with China
generally.
As regards the punishment or tne
responsible authors and actual perpe
trators of the antl-forelgn outrages, tne
government of the United States while
insisting that all such should be held
to the utmost accountability, declined
to determine in any case the nature of
the punishment to be inflicted, and
maintained that the Chinese govern
merit itself should in all cases carry
then out.
'As soon as the chief culprits had
been punished considering the terrible
losses in life and property sustained by
China, not only through the boxers and
their adherents, but by the destruction
of Tien Tsin, Pekin and the military
occupation of a large portion of the
province of Chi Li, the United States
threw the weight of its Influence on the
side of moderation and the prevention
of further bloodshed. To this it was
mainly due that the long lists of pro
scription which had been prepared by
the representatives of the powers, of
Chinese in the provinces charged with
participation in the massacres, or riots
were repeatedly revised before the
presentation to the Chinese govern
mnt. The demands for capital punish
ment were finally reduced from ten to
four, and many names, erroneously, or
on insufficient evidence placed on the
lists were removed, or lighter forms of
punishment asked for numbers of those
left on them.
"While seeking with the other powers
the best means to prevent the recur
rence of such troubles and to guard in
the future American residents in Pekin
from such dangers as they had passed
through, the United States did not lend
Its support to any plan which contem
plated either the prolonged occupation
by foreign troops of any portions or
points in China, or the erection of an
international fort in the city of Pekin
from which to carry on friendly rela
tions with the Chinese government. Our
policy has always been in favor of a
strong, independent and responsible
Chinese government which can and will
be held accountable for the maintenance
of order and the protection of our citi
zens and their tights under the treaties.
Throughout the negotiations we strictly
adhered to this just principle, with re
sults which have proved beneficial to
all.
"As regards the third point of the ne
gotiations, the equitable indemnification
of the various states for the losses and
expenses incurred by them in China and
in sending expeditionary forces to re
lieve the legations and foreign residents
at Pekin and restore order and also
the securing of indemnities to societies,
companies and individuals for their pri
vate losses through the anti-foreign
riots, the government of the United
States advocated that the sum total of
these indemnities should not exceed a
reasonable amount well within the pow
er of China to pay. After careful in
quiry you reached the conclusion that
with her present resources and liabili
ties, China could not pay as Indemnities
to the powers more than 200 millions of
dollars and that the exaction of any
larger amount would not only entail
permanent financial embarrassment on
the country but might possibly result
in either international financial control
or even the loss of territory. The rep
resentative of the United States was in
structed accordingly and he was further
told that in the opinion of our govern
ment the amount should be asked of
China by the powers jointly without de
tail, or explanation and afterwards di
vided among them according to their
losses and disbursements. You also sta
ted that every facility of payment
should be accorded China and that the
debt should be paid by bonds issued at
par and bearing 3 per cent interest and
running for 30 or 40 years.
"Though it became necessary after
protracted discussion in the conference
to accept the proposition of the other
powers to demand of China the sum to
tal of their losses and disbursements.
reaching the enormous sum of $333,000,
wo over insistence in pressing for a
much lower sum, and the weight of the
arguments adduced in favor of such a
policy, resulted in closing the indemni
ties at the above lump sum, when they
bid fair to go on swelling indefinitely.
This and the acceptance of your sug
gestion that the indemnities be paid in
bonds, issued at par and bearing a low
rate of interest (A per cent was finally
agreed upon) and running for AO years,
resulted In saving a vast sum to China,
hastened the evacuation of the country
by the expeditionary force and the re
storation of order and of normal rela
tions with the Chinese government.
ROAST BY COBURN.
Walden Onght to Be Good
After This.
Secretary Coburn, of the state board
of agriculture, has no patience with
people who make their living oft of
Kansas and then say mean things
about the state away from home. His
latest is to call down G. M. Walden,
president df the Kansas City Live Stock
Exchange, for an address made by
Walden at the recent national live stock
convention in Chicago, in which Wal
den drew a picture of Kansas which
would tend to . the injury of the state.
The address was published in the
Drovers' Telegram of Kansas City, and
in a letter addressed to that publication
Mr. Coburn says:
I note in your issue of December 6
what purports to be an address made
the day previous at the national live
stock convention In Chicago by one
O. M. Walden, president of the Kan
sas -ity Live Stock Exchange," upon
the subject of "Xhe Late Drouth."
As is customary with cheap would
be wits, and men of small minds con
gested with misinformation, who wish
to paint a calamity picture which by
its vivid coloring shall rivet attention
upon the supposed coruscating bril
liancy of the artist, he of course uses
Kansas as the background upon which
to depict his ideas of the ghastly horri
ble. This is their (no unusual) idea of
"making a hit," and tickling the ears
of the groundlings. As a preliminary
they usually spread upon their canvas
a more or less thik coating of glucose,
which gives the atter-coloring a sharp
ness and distinctness it would not oth
erwise possess. In Mr. Walden's pic
ture he deftly puts in his "drouth"
touches like this:
"The balmy Kansas zephyr no longer
greets us perfume-laden, but is now a
hot, withering wind. Mark the sickly
white yellow of the corn, the stunted,
dwarfed wheat and oats; grass sere
and withered, white with dust; gaunt
and starving cattle walking the trail
along the fence. Only a scum of green
ish yellow over the bosom of muddy
water in pondsnanks and creeks, late
ly so proud in their strength, but
would not now float Johnny's tiny play
boat. Look at the abject, despairing
farmer, perched dejectedly on the barn
yard fence, smoking an old clay pipe.
Look at the housewife moving listlessly
about the house, with unkempt chil
dren playing about her. Even nature
seems to wear a look of despair and
woe."
Now my guess is that this Mr. Wal
den iives in Missouri; that if he ia in the
live stock trade about three-fourths of
the business he does and of the living
he gets are furnished by the state of
Kansas his caricature of which he so
lovingly drew, and, neglecting his busi
ness, journeyed to Chicago to put on ex
hibition, with himself as Its easel. But
why should he have gone out of his
way to label his picture "Kansas"?
Why not Missouri, or Texas, or Okla
homa? Would he have the world sup
pose they were immune while Kansas
was enduring such grievous afflictions?
We had a spell of dry weather, as
would naturally be the case when ad
jacent to Missouri, where a burning
drouth, the worst in fifty years, held
sway for months, and where, any time
since July, except in the Missouri river,
below the Kaw's mouth, water enough
to yield the "scum of greenish yellow"
he describes would have furnished occa
sion for a week of thanksgiving and
prayer. This was well understood by
most people, and twice I went to cen
tral and eastern Missouri to buy cattle
because, to prevent their starving, Mis
sourians needed to sell them on almost
any terms, while Kansas could and
does graze them knee deep in succu
lence. In the matter of drouth in the
summer of 1901, compared with Mis
souri, Kansas, too wet to plow, was
spending large sums for drain tile.
(n the other hand lr Mr. walaen wisnea
to put agricultural Kansas on exhibition
aright he could, speaking by the card,
have shown that the year 1901 was, agri
culturally, the sreatest in all her history.
That she was never before so productive
in agricultural values as tnis year; tnai
the "stunted, dwarfed wheat" he thought
his jaundiced eyes saw, produced the
largest and at the same time the most
valuable crop ever grown in any state in
the world's history; that no other state
ever had such an acreage of wheat sown
or of such a great promise as Kansas had
at the hour when he was exploiting his
picture of "abject despairing:" that the
state had more horses, more mules, more
milk cows and more other cattle, and
worth more money than ever before, and
that her hay, sorghum, wool, dairy, poul
try, garden and horticultural products
never before brought so much, and that
her people never before so generally wore
silk underwear, nor had so much money
in banks an amount per capita such as
has seldom if ever been equaled by the
people of an agricultural community any
where. Of course he couldn't have said these
pleasanter things about his own state be
cause there wasn't much in that line to
sav; there doeen't seem to be much of
record showing that she produced any
thing unless it was his "abject, despair
ing farmer, perched dejectedly on the
barn yard fence, smoking an old clay
niDe." where "even nature seems to wear
a look of despair and woe."
What a plight such outside humorists
and artists as the sprightly Mr. Walden,
who lives off her. would be in if Kansas
should really conclude to put up the shut
ters and let herself dry out for a year
or two! Thev would indeed be wearing
n. "sioklv white vellow" that Kansans
would make automobile journeys of many
leagues to see-

WANT JOHN MACDONALD
His Friends Would Make II I m
State Superintendent.
There is a auiet movement on foot
among the friends of John MacDonald
to secure for him the nomination on the
Republican ticket next year for state
superintendent of public instruction.
Mr. MacDonald is one of the foremost
educators in the west, and although he
is not considered a politician, he seems
to be "in the hands of his friends." The
friends have a neat scheme by which
they expect to secure for Mr. MacDon
ald the nomination and also a represen
tation of the First district on the state
ticket. It is figured by Mr. MacDonald'a
friends that Superintendent of Public
instruction Frank Nelson can not se
cure the renomination for a third term
for two reasons. One that the third
term idea will not be popular, and also
because he lives in the Seventh dis
trict, and the Seventh has more than
its share of candidates in the field, and
will undoubtedly receive at least its
share of places on the ticket without the
renomination yt Mr. Nelson.
The nomination of a superintendent
of public instruction is far down on the
list, and the state convention will have
settled most of the hotly contested nom
inations by the time that office ia
reached. The supporters of Mr. Mac
Donald figure that none of the avowed
candidates from Shawnee county and
the First district will be successful, and
that when the office of superintendent
is reached it can be secured for Mr.
MacDonald by his being: nominated.
With reference to his retorted candi
dacy Mr. Aiacuonaia said tnis aiter-
noorn
"I do not want it understood that I am
a candidate in the sense that I would
will not. Every year f receive more or
lees letters rrom people over the state
urging me to become a candidate, but I
made this same answer to them all T
will not scrajnble for the nlace If it
could come to me spontaneously I would,
of course, appreciate it, to round out my
woric or 6 years in tne puDiic scnoois or
Kansas, but things do not go that way
in politics. The politicians come in and
make slates and they figure on locality
and other things. For that reason I am
not a candidate and do not want to be
so considered."
ONE-THIRD IS TAKEN.
Space For Midwinter Exposi
tion Being Snapped Up.
Two manufacturing concerns at En
terprise, Kan., have taken booth space
at the Kansas Midwinter exposition. In
addressing Manager R. S. Brigham for
space, C. Hoffman & Sons, flour millers
say: "If all the towns do as well in
taking space as our little burg, it will
be taken in a jiffy."
"I wish to congratulate you," said
Mr. Brigham in answer, "upon the sub
stantial evidence that we are receiving
that Enterprise Is true to its name. If
other towns in proportion to the popu
lation did as well, we would have to put
in an exposition building that would
pome very near covering the site of To

Halstead, Kan.; the Hygienic Optical

a letter this morning asking him to

reply he stated that he would agree to

dent of the club, to come ud from Law
rence this afternoon to talk the matter
over. The banquet Idea had been almost
agreed upon, but Secretary Valentine has
not vet round a caterer who will put up
the Kind of a banquet the club would
want far the price it has been accustomed
to paying. The fact that the gathering
will be held in Representative hall in
stead of in some hotel makes the giving
of an elaborate banquet much more diffi
cult than heretofore, and the caterers
who have thus- far been consulted want
from $1.50 to $3 a plate net for serving
such a banquet, and it takes a fee of
about 50 cents per plate to pay the inci
dental expenses of the club aside from
the banquet.
The officers are now considering the
idea of making it a "smoker" and putting
as much informality as possible Into it.
The chairs would be placed irregularly in
Representative hall and the speakers al
lowed to sit wherever they please. Oood
music could be made one of the features,
and coffee and sandwiches could be served
in the chief clerk's room to all who de
sired them.
It is ail a question as to what will be
most popular with the rank and file of
the club. Some of the members have
been in favor of doing away with the
elaborate banquet idea for several years,
but there are a lot of others who always
like to eat when they go to an affair of
that character.
RIDDLE WINS FIGHT.
lie Won't Be Remored as Adju
tant of G. A. B.
F. M. Riddle, adjutant general of the
G. A. R, seems to be ahead in the con
test with Gilbert Biedell over retaining
possession of his office. He received a
telegram today from Department Com
mander Norton, rescinding the order re
moving him from office.
Some time ago Norton removed Riddle
and appointed Biedell to succeed him.
For the past two or three days Biedell
has been trying to get possession of
the office, but Riddle has held on and
defied the authority of anybody except
the council of administration to remove
him. The telegram he received this
morning seems to settle the fight in his
favor.
