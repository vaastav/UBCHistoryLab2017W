BY HIV.H IU ILL IK
(Vnited Press Stuff Correspondent)
. WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 4.—The attitude of the
■jdm frustration today with regard to the peace treaty is
Jtfiat of "watchful waiting."
Believing that a great popular demand for ratification
will come from the country within a few weeks, President
Wilson is keeping "hands off" the present situation, wait
ing for this urge to materialize, according to numerous
indications.
The president refrained from directly mentioning
treaty in his message to congress, it is believed, with the
idea that further argument was useless.
The nwtl for It. friend* of ihtt.l -
ministration predict. will steadily be
come nior.- apparent They arc
look In c for events to convince the
paoplc that the treaty la desirable
an.! that no other mean* of hrlnnlni
about offK-tal peace will do. The
president'* alienee, they aaaert. does
Bo; mean he haa given up the fight
or that he la any le«a Interested In
ratification than when he toured the
country appealing for It That he
