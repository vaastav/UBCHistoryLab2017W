A larger medicine company and
' a-four story, skyscraper are two of
. the new things In the plans of the
A. B. Seelye Medical Co. The first
became a fact today wben the busi
tiess of the Weaver-Hlxson Medicine
'. Co., of Salina, was purchased. This
company was one of the largest In
the state and for twelve years has
been manufacturing X-Ray oil and
Cocomint, two well known prepara
Hons, With the purchase Mr. P. E
Wearer, president and manager of
the Weaver-Hlxson company comes
to Abilene as general sales manager
of the Seelye Medical Co. He took
charge of bis new position today
and later will bring bis family here.
He is an expert salesman and knows-
the medicine business thoroughly.
. ,He will be a strong force in the bus
iness of the Seelye company. Mr.
Weaver will later move to Abilene.
. 'sThe Weaver-Hlxson company was
erranized In 1911 by Mr. Weaver
where he purchased the X-Ray Oil
company of Salina, of which be bad
"been general manager. This latter
company began the manufacture of
X-Ray oil and cocomint in Salina In
1900. These prescriptions have en-
Joyed a splendid sale. It is the pur
pose of the Seelye company to con
tinue the present business of the
-Weaver-Hlxson company under the
-name of the A. B. Seelye Medical
-company. '
- The consolidation of these two
companies adds about 150 salesmen
tn the Seelve comnanr. brought to
them by the" Weaver-Hlxson com;
pany, making this Abilene company
one of the strongest institutions in
the west with Increased facilities
for handling the products of both
companies to the best advantage.
The A. B. Seelye Medical company
Is one of Abilene's big Institutions
' Its business has grown to large
nrrniArtlnna and the products are
marketed through special salesmen
In more states than the average
man will travel through in a life
time.- It is the purpose of the com
pany to double its sales force the
coming year. The demand for the
preparations made by this company
78 different articles Is constant
ly increasing and the popularity of
the preparations is attested by their
growing use.
In a few months Dr. Seelye ex
N pects to begin work on the first
"skyscraper" for Abilene It will
"be located on the lota owned by him
just east of the new postofflce site
on East Third street. The building
lor which the plans are practically
complete will be of reinforced con
crete four stories high, 60 by 150
feet on the ground with abundance
of lighting area. Dr. Seelye ham
looked at many locations and de
cided that Abilene is the best town
on earth for him.
His growing business promises to
be one of the largest in the country.
Its preparations have merit and its
methods are such as have stood the
test of time. It is now the largest
medicine company in the state1 and
the purchase of the Weaver-Hlxson
eompany puts it yet farther to the
front. Starting with nothing but a
hand satchel filled with home-made
medicine a little more than a dozen
years ago Dr. Seelye's success has
been one of the marvels of Kansas
business progress and Abilene ex
pects to see him reach yet greater
prominence.
' With the meeting at the Metho
dist church Sunday evening the
three Weeks of special meetings
came to a close. In the closing meet
ing Dr. Balch announced some of
the statistic of the three weeks'
meeting. There wers 10 conver
sions and reclamations a part of
them were already members of the
church. Up to the present , time
there have been 41 additions to tho
Methodist church here as a result of
the meetings, 19 preferred to Join
other churches, and-' their names
have been given to the other pastors
of Abilene and five of the converts
lived' in other towns and will Join
there. A number of the converts
who expected to become members of
the church yesterday were ! kept
away by tie bad weather and will
Join later. The meeting , has been
much greater and of wider influence
than the figures can show. Dr. Cal-
fee has preached almost every night
to a crowded bouse. The chorus ac
cording to Bernard Vessey Is the
best that be ever, had In a like meet
ing and it will be kept together for
further use in the church under the
direction of Prof. TUlotson , who
trained it for the meetings. Dr. Cah
fee has preached good common
sense straight from the shoulder and
the whole church has been strength
ened. Dr. Balch will follow the
meetings with a aeries of sermons
on "The Best Things In Life" ,for
his Sunday evening services and the
chorus with' the .-orchestra will fur
nish the music for the services. The
first meeting of the chdrus will be
held next Thursday evening.

Predicts 15 'Degree Temperature in
State This Week.
LOTS OP FUN FOR:
THE POLICE FORCE,
Yesterday, the warmest December
1 in eight years, probably was the
end .of the warm weather for this
year. The government yesterday
sent out cold wave warnings for the
Dakotas, Nebraska and west central
Iowa. Kansas is scheduled to get a
"near-cold wave" out of the atmos
pheric disturbances. By tonight the
temperature is expected to be down
to 1 5 degrees.
The maximum yesterday was 67
degrees, the highest since 1904j,
when the thermometer registered
65 degrees on December 1. The
record for this date is 66 degrees
in 1889.
"The rain yesterday, though it
didn't last long, was of great bene
fit to the wheat crop. It was gener
al through the state, and even
through the precipitation was small
it will help considerably. The wind
changed to the northwest yesterday
afternoon and was blowing 25 miles
an hour at 7 o'clock last night. The
average temperature yesterday was
12 degrees above normal.
Another disturbance now off the
north Pacific coast, will move in
land about Tuesday, attended by
rains in the Pacific states and rain
and snow in the northwest. This
disturbance will prevail over the
middle west Wednesday' Or Thurs
day and the eastern states near the
end of the week. Rain in southern
and snow In northern districts, east
of the Rocky mountains and a gen
eral reaction to higher temperatures,
will precede and attend this disturbance.

QUAIL SEASON IS OVER NOW.
Hunters Cannot Shoot Birds Until
November 13 of Next Year.
The quail season for 1912 is over
and it .will be a year, lacking 15
days, before the birds can lawfully
be bunted again. A number of hunt
ers were out Saturday to take ad
vantage of the last day, but the
quail were scarce. The extremely
cold weather and heavy snows of
last winter killed many of the quail,
which accounts for their scarcity at
the present time. If this proves to
be an open winter, say the hunters,
quail will be more numerous next
fan, but If it Is a repetition of last
winter, quail next year . will be
career thaa ever before.

CHARTING NEW MAP

Allies Will Agree to Division of the
Spoils.
London, Dec. : 8. Charting j the
new map of European Turkey will
begin immediately after the sign

day. If the allies agree among
themselves as to the spoils there
seems to be no probability of the
resumption of hostilities. No ad
justment of the ' Servian-Austrian
dispute is visible, although the re
lations between St. Petersburg and
Vienna bare been somewhat mend
