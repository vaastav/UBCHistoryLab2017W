Tea reEsiDENT's Mkssaoe. We
RUirc'Tiiler a largo portion o our space
to-day to an altract' of this dcctl
mcut. Its lei.glU jireveute.l us from
giving it entire, but ve h.iTe enileaT

prominent mutter rnintainci iu if.
General Grant adheres to hi former

tLo lessons of the past year.
Tbeictro.lnctiou of uiusictl iustril
inonto, S1 orgracizatiou of choirs, in
tlioprotenUnt cLurche-1, in the large
lowrti and cities, within the post few
years, h notably destroyed the once
popalir and Tery attractive system ot
congregational singing'. Have the
churches bcea benefitted by this
chango, either in their growth or In
the interest of the member-) of the
congregations iu their attendance?
We think not.
We are decided' iu favor of tue
um of organs or other suitable instru
saenU of music, and of choirs iu the
ehuiche, but we think they have
baeu changed .roin their original pur
port wLi.li was simply that of iead-
ra of ill music, aud that they have
nsarped the entire conduct of this
part of the service in moat of the
churches, uud that this chaiigehas cot
oly not boii beneficial to the char.
hes in any way; but has actually
worked an injury. Since the mem-
- bf r-of -4Le . various coujxregatiooa
liar ceased to join ia the singing,
they havo yielded almost the only par-
tieipatipn .they iuiva4a th-ihurch eer
vices. Tills i certainly so iu all l
th protest urxt churches which Lave
uPliluals, (and we know of but oue
Lich hat). This objection does not
apply 60 aptly to the Roman Catholic
church, because except in the mn-io,
which in that church is usually con
ducted by choirs, the congregation
participate with the priost in the ser
vices of the mass. Not so, however,
with a majority of tho protestaut chur
ches. The largo majority of the con
gregatious there arc mere listeners to
. the music, to the prayenand the fcer
mon, aud bavc no part in the conduct
of the services.
From a secular point of view we
think this matter is on of such im
portance as to require a change, aud
that the choirs should hi used mere
ly to laud the congregation Ja the con
duct of the musical services of the
church, wliioh we presume will not
be questioned was the original object
ot their organization.
Ka.vk ItoBBKBX. At Corinth, Mis
tirgippi, oa aTonJay lost, at 1 o'clock,
r. m., a bold and heavy bank robbery
was elleetcd by a party of four armed
taen, who had been in the vicinity of
the plaos for several days previous.
They seemed to be careless, dissipated
and reckless men, bat their object was
not supposed to be robbery or vio
lence. Oa the day named, however,
they rode np to the houso cccupied
by Mr. A. H. Taylor as a bauk, which
is an out of the way place, and two of
them entered the building, leaving
the other two to hold tha horses at the
door. On entering they found no
one inside except a negro named A n
thouy Williamson, who was making a
deposit with the bank, and tho pro
prietor llr. A. U. Taylor. One ot the
robbers askud the latter the price of
gold. The banker told him that he
could have it for ten o uts. The rob
ber told him that ho must let him
hava it for les. Thereupon Mr. Tay
lor wns told to open the safe, and the
kio wna ordered to stand still.
Taylor hesitated, when he was cat
across the forehead with a bowie
knife. He then opened the safe,
which was speedily cleared of its con
tents. It is said that the loss , to the
bank insludcs $'-5,000 ia money, about
sixty gold and Bilver watches, dia
monds, jewelry and other articles on
special deposit, thai would usual
ly bo gathered together in a half
banking, balt-pawnbrokiug establish

pravc-tad interference from without,
and iu a few moments the robbers had
dona thair work, and were fiyiug from
the setrne. They were followed for a
" day or two, but tip to the time we
write they are at large.

The Presidents Message,

Presidents message:

Sinco tho convening of Congress one
year ago, the nation his undergone a
PROSTBATIOS IS UCSINE.SS A NO INDUS
TRIE.'
sr.eh as has not been witnes-od with
us for many years. Speculation as to
the causes for this prostration might
be indulged in withont prolit, because,
as many tbeorios would be advanced
as there would bo independent wri
ters those who expressed their own
views without bearing upon the snb
ject. Wittiout indulging in theories
as to the cause of this prostration, I
will only ctll your attention to the
fact, and one question as to which it
would seem thero should be no disa
greement during this prostration,
Two essential elements of prosperity
havf been most abundant labor and
capital. Both have been largely un
employed. W here security has fcc'it,
miJonbteil. eatiral ha been a1 tama
ble at very modcr.it" rutea. Where
labor Las been wanted, it ha3 been
found in abundance at cheap rates
compared with what necessaries and
comtorts of life could bo purchased
with tho waces demanded. Two
great elements of prosperity, there
fore, have not bceu denied us. A
third might be added our soil and
climate are unequale.d within the lim
its of any contiguous territory under
onc nationality, for its variety of pro
ducts to feed and clothe a people, and
in the amount ot surplus to opare to
feed less favored people; therefore.
with these facts, it seems to me that
wise statesmanship at this session of
Congress would dictate ignoring the
post and directing iu proper channels
these great elements of prosperity
to any people. A
great conflict for national existence
made necessary for temporary pur
puses, the raising of a large sum. of
moncv from whatever source attaina
ble. It Income necessary in the wis
dom of Congress, and I do not doubt
their wisdom in the premise, regard
ing the necessity of the times, to de
vise a system of national currency,
which it proved to be impossible to
keep on a par with the recognized
eurrency of the civilized world. This
begot a spirit of speculation, involv
ing an extravagance and luxury not
required for the happiness or prosper
ity of a people, ond involving, both
directly and indirectly, foreicm in
debtedness. The currency being of
fluctuating value, and therefore uu
safe to hold for legitimate transac
tions, requiring money, became a sub
ject of speculation in itself. These
two causes, however, have involved
us In a foreign indobtodness, contract
ed in good faith by borrowers and
lenders, which should be paid in coin
and according to the bond agreed up
on wheu the debt was contracted
gold or its equivalent. The good
faith of tho government can not be
violated toward creditors at the na
tional disgrace. Our commerce should
be encouraged, American ship build
ing and carrying partly increased, for
eign markets sought lor products of
the soil and manufacturers to the end
that we may be able to pay these
debts. Where market can be created
for the sale of onr products, either
of the soil, tho mine or manufactory,
a new means is discovered of utiliz
ing our idle capital and labor to tho
advantage of the whole people. Bat
in my judgment the first xtr-p toward
this obecl is to secure
A Cl BHENCY GOOD WUE&EVEB CIVILI
ZATION lLEIG.NS;
one which, if it becomes superabun
dant with one people, will And a mar
ket with other. A currency which
has as its basis tho labor necersary to
produce it which will give its value.
Gold and silver are now the recogniz
ed mediums ot exchange tue world
over, and to this we should return
with the least practicable delay, in
view of the pledges cf the American
Congress, when our present legal teu
der system was adopted and the debt
contracted.
A RETURN TO SFECIE TAIMKNTS.
inenrst grand requisite to a re
turn to rro8eritv is: tho lecal ten
der clause to the law authorizing the
issue of currency bv the National
Government should be repealed, to
take euect as to ail contracts entered
into after a day lixed in the repealing
act; not to apply, however, to the pay
ment of salaries by the Government.
or other expenses now provided by
law to paid in currency. In the inter
val pending between the repeal and
the tinal resumption, provision should
be made by which the .Secretary of the
.treasury can obtain gold as it moy
become necessary, from timo to time,
from the date when specie resumption
commenced. To this might and
should be added 4 revenue sutlicient-

JSVAB DrPABTJIE.ST.
All the recommendations of the
Secretary of War I regard as judi
cious, aud I specially commend to
your attention th? followiug: "Con
solidation of Government arsenals,
mileage to officer traveling under or
ders, the exemption of money receiv
ed troni the sale ef subsistence stores
from being converted into the Treas
ury, the use of appropriations for the
purpose of subsistence stores, with
out wuitin for the beginning of the
fiscal year for which the appropria
tions is made, fur additional a;qri
pnatione, for the collection ol torpe
do material, for increased appropri
ations for the manufacture of arms,
for relieving 1 he various States from
indebtedness for arms charged to them
during the rebellion, for dropping of
Sicers Irom the rolls of the army with
out trial for the oll'ense of drawing
pay more than once lor the same pe
riod, for the discouragement of the
plan to pay soldiers by checks, an i
for the establishment of a lrofeBsor
ship of lihetoric and Engli-.li Lit-ra-tai
e at Wet Point.
TUB NAVY.
The efficiency of the navy has been
largely increased during the last year
undr the impulse of the foreign com
plications which threatened us at the
Cfimmn of tho 1 1-1 Fc-.-iori i-l
Courvess. Mostof our efficient wood
en siiips were put in condition for im
mediate service, aud repairs of ou:
iron-clad fleet were pushed with the
utmost vigor.
l'OSTAL, AFFAIRS.
Next to our public schools, 1 lie
postuificc is tho great agent of edu
cation over our vast territory.
The rapidity with which new kcc
tions arc being settled up, thus in
creasing the carrying of mails in a
more rapid ratio than the incrca.-e
of receipts, is alarmin?. Tliu re
port of the Postmaster Gcner-I,
herewith attached, shows that there
was an increase of revenue in his
department in 1873, over thotprevi
ous year, of $l,G74,-ill, and u: in
crease of the cost of carrying the
mails or paying employees of $3,011,
407 91. The report of" the, Postmas
ter General gives somo interesting
statistics .of his Department, aud
compared with corresponding sta
tistics of a year ago show a growth
in every branch ot the Department.
-
LOUISIANA AFFAIRS.
On the 11th of September last the
Governor of Louisiana called upon
me, as provided by the Constitutiou
and laws of the United .States, to
aid in the suppression of domestic
violence in that State. Tho call
was made in view of a proclama
tion issued on that day by D. B.
Penn, stating that ho was elected
Lieutenant Governor in 1872, and
calling upon the militia of the Stato
to arm, assemble and drive from
power the usurpers, as he designat
ed the officers of the Slate Govern
ment. On tho next day I issued
my proclamation, commanded the
insurgents to disperse within live
days from the date thereof, and sub
sequently learned that on that day
they had taken forcible possession
of the State-house. Troops were
taken by mo to support the existing
anil recognized State Government,
but betoro tho expiration of the
live days tho insurrectionary move
ment was practically abandoned,
and the officers of the State govern
ment, with some minor exceptions,
resumed their powers and duties.
Confiderinjj that the present State
administraiiou ot Louisiana, had
been, tho only government iu that
State for nearly two years, that it
has been tneltlv acknowledged and
acquiesced i.l as such by congress, J
and more than once expressly re
cognized by me, 1 regard it as my
clear duty, wnen legally called upon
tor that purpose, to prevent Us over
throw by an armed mob under pre
tense ot fraud and Irregularities in
the elect iou or 1872- I have hereto
lore called tho attention ot cougress
to the subject, stating that ou ac
count ot the Hands and lorgeries
committed at said election, aud be
cause it appears that the returns
thereof were never legally canvass
ed, it was impossible to tell thereby
who were chosen; but Irom tho best
sources of information at my com
mand, I have always believed the
present Stale officer received a ma
jority of tho legal votes actually
cast at the election. 1 repeat what
I said in my special message of Feb
ruary 13, 1873, that in tho event ol
no action by congress I must contin
ue to recognize the government
heretofore recognized by me.
I regret to say that with prepara
tions lor tho late election, decided
indications appeared iu some locali
ties in the Southern States cf a de
termination, by acts of violence aud
intimidation, to deprive citizens of
the freedom ol the ballot because of
their political opinions.
Hie whole number or troops 111
the States of Louisiana, Alabama,
(ieorgia, Florida, South Carolina,
North Carolina, Kentucky. Teunes-

braces the garrisous of all tho forts
from tho Delaware to the Gulf ot
Mexico.
AHKA.VSAS.
Another trouble has arisen in Ar
kansas. Articio 13, of the constitu
tion of the State which was adopt
ed m lst3, upon the approval of
wuicn oy congress tne State was re
stored to leprescntation as oue of
the States of the Union, provides
in effect that, before any amend
ments proposed to this constitution
snail be made part thereof, they
Biian 00 passed oy two successive
assemblies and then submitted to
and ratified by a majority of the c-
icctors oi tue oiato voting therein.
On tho 11th of May, 1874, tho Gov
ernor convened an extra session of
the itencrai Assembly of the State,
which, ou 1110 loin 01 the same
month, iaeu an act providing lor
a voii ciuma iu irame a new con

those qualified to vote thereon; and
at tha same election persons were

have been adhered to as closely as
has been practicable Willi 1 he oppo

impracticable to uiaiuiain them
without tho direct Mid positive sup
port of Congress.
GOVERNMENT MANIPULATION.
1 would not sug
gest as a remedy, direct subsidy to
American steamship lines, but I
would suggest the direct offer of
ample compensation for carrying
the mails between Atlantic and sea
board cities uud the Continent, on
American owned uud American
built steamers, and would extend
this liberality to vessels carrying
the mails to the South American
Slates and to Central America and
Mexico, and would pursue the same
policy irom our Pacific seaports to
tho foreign seaports on the Pacific.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
In rny opinion tho District of
Columbia should be regarded as the
grounds of the Natiouul Capital, in
which tho entiro peoplo aro inter
ested. I do not allude to this to
urge appropriations to the District,
but to draw tho attention of Con
gress, in framing a law for tho gov
ernment of tho District, to the mag
nificent scale on which the city wa
planned by the founders of the Gov
ernment: tho manner in which, for
ornamental purposes, the reserva
tions, streets and avenues ware laid
out, and the proportion of the prop
city actually posse. ;ed by the Gen
eral Covemment. I think the pro
portion of the expenses of tho Gov
ernment aud improvements to be
borno by the General Government,
the cities of Washington and George
town and the country, should be
carefudy and equitably defined.

As manager of tbo gift concert
given in aid of tbe Public Library
of Kentucky my position creates an
importtit trust in behalf of tho
Publio Library and the tickethold
crs of tho fifth gilt concert. The
Public Library of Kentucky and
the ticket-holders are jointly interes
ted in the amount ot tho drawing.
Tho larger tho fund to be distribu
ted in gitta tho greater will be tho
gift awarded to each lucky ticket
holder and tho moro the amount
realized by tho Library. To have
a full drawing is so manifestly to
tho intcfC-st Cl lh"so interested
that, rather than having a fractional
drawing on the 2'Jth insL, I deem it
due to the trust con tided to me by
tho ticket-holders and the Public j
Library of Kentucky, that a short
postponement bo made to enable mo
to dispose of tbe uns ,!d tickets and
havo 11 fall drawiug. Though
the very largo amount now in bank
would enable us to distribute hand
some gifts, yet we should fool disap
pointed in this our last concert,
should wo bo compelled to make a
fractional drawiDg.h jwever large.
e have received very large
a number Ct letters Irom all parts
of the country from thoje most large
ly, interested, urging a postpone
ment if all the tickets be not sold bv
the 30th, that wo fee! strengthened
in our sense of duty t the ticket-
holders and tho Pubi ; Librajy, to
make tbe postponement. Under the
circumstances, we havo determined,
in tho interest of all .- irties, to post

Mo, S. Y.: Dear Sir It is with a
happy heart that I peu these lines to
acknowledge that your Golden
Medical Dicoverv and Purgative Pel
lets are blessings to the World. These
medicines cannot be too highly prais
ed, for they have almost brought me
out of the grave. Three months ago
I was broken ou t with large ulcers and
sores ca my body, limbs and face.
I procured vour Golden Medical Dis
covery and Pargative Pellets, and
have taken six bottles, and to-day I
am in good health, all those ugly nl
cers having healed and left my skin in
a natural healthy condition. I
thought at oi-e tune I could let 1
cured. Although I can but p.orly
is a drop of oy in every word 1 wriuT.
Gcxl'8 blessing re.-t on you aud your
woadcrful medicines is the hncib'e
prayer of
You rs trulv,
JAMES O.ELLIS.
When a medicine will promptly
care such terrible eating ulcers and
free the blood of the virulent prison
causing them, who can lunger doubt
its wonderful virtues? Dr. Pierce,
however, does not w ish 10 place his
Golden Medical Discovery in the cata
logue of quack r atent nostrums by re
commending it to cure every disca-e,
nor docs he so recommend it- but w,hat
he does chum is this, that there is but
one form of tlood disease that it will
1 not cure, and that disease is cancer.
He docs not recommend his Discovery
for that disease, yet ho knows it to be
the most searching blood cleanse r yet
Cisco vered, and tnat will free tne blood
j and system of all other known blood
i poisons, bo tliey animal, vegetable or
mineral. Tho Golden Discovery is
warreuted by him to cure the worst
I forms of Skin Disease, as all forms of
I Blotches, Pimples and Eruptions, also
1 all Glandular Swellings, and tbe worst
( lorm of Scrofulous and Ulcerated
Sores of Neck, Legs or any other
parts, and all Scrofulous Diseases of
Bones, as White Swellings, Fever
Sores, Hip Joint and Spinal Diseases,
all of which belong 10 Scrofulous
Diseases.

cf ill cease to do so, so soou as the

this road will leel the weight ot her

The same gentlemau recently had

tors (on tho Louisville end ol the

granted him the privilege of
stopping olt at such places as he re
quested. The next two (on the
Memphis end) refused him the priv
ilege, the first one informed him
that he must give up Lis through
ticket or pay agia which he ret us
ed to do; the . enductor thea forci
bly ejected him from the train in
the presence of ladies aa-J gcntla-'
men. He then took the next train,
and would have suffered the same
fate at t he hends of the other con
ductor had he not again paid his

I am also informed that au ei
Governor traveling on ono of these
trains with a through ticket, re
quested the privilege of stopping

remonstrated asralnst a rulo so un

A No. 1 Siijm rinteu.lrnt chanced

I make these statements that the

would recommend them, in order
to avoid these annoyances, to seek
