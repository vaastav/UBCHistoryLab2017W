senator Angus Cameron made his
. ij.ieii fir.it in the Senate in an
tn some of Mr. Menimon’s ro
upon the South Carolina ease
’ Washington correspondent of
- ,e Chicago 7V///A. says “Mr Came
. „ spoke at great disadvantage, as
juiii to sit out this continuous scs
. ,n without nst. but in spite of the
> ..dug load of weariness, and the
i atmos'i-here of the Senate
, .iinh.-r, Mr. Cameron made a no
jink* impression, both by his clear,

id rios, which had groaned with
.viridity over the dull routine of
lingering of the day, were waked
.'.i interest by Senator Cameron s
tails.
Tin-: President's annual message
to Congress is an interesting docu
ro eiit and is unusually vtlnable in
paling with the Southern policy’and
\ it* reforms which have formed so
!u i ( ‘ h part of Republican p atforras
•uni so small a part of Republican
practice. On the money question
tli-. President is firm. He is decid
edly favorable to resumption—and
; ,,ivo utes the payment of the bonds
issued prior to 1*7;! in gold. Evi
dently he does not favor the remon
r'iz'idon of silver, but will sign a
. ; ,v i bill which exempts the pay
ment of the bonds in that coin.
Tii-se portions of the document will
1 .. pad with interest. We expect to
publish the message entire next
week.
II mi Dana C. Lamb, railroad com
; li'-icmer of Wisconsin, and a resi
,i ii of Fend du Luc, was very
ijctlv arrested at that city last
Timrs i iy, upon a warrant issued at
Rfjmiii, and charging him, upon com
-1 sint of o.l* Reed, with the lar
rrtiv of SSUO, belonging to Thomas
t., Ih undage. Mr. Lamb appeared
before the justice at Ripon, and at
vnee waived an examination, four
prominent citizens of that place fur
id'liing bail for his appearance at
the circuit court. Mr. Lamb states
(hat the proceeding is an attempt to
I tree him to pay at once a debt
which lie owes iirundage, and has
■ •aused a warrant for perjury to he
i"ijed against O. P. Reed, the per
-mi making this complaint against
Lim.
Tin: progress of the war between
1! issia and Turkey during thejpast
week has apparently been verv slow
luit what little advance lias been
made lias resulted to the advantage
of Russia. In Antonia, the Russian
army before Frteromn lias gone in
to Winter quarters, and no offen
sive movement has taken place ex
cept at Ratom, an important port
on the southeastern coast of the
black Sea, the heights in the rear
"! which have been occupied by the
Russians. The Winter lias set in
i : i that region, and it is probable
’•at the campaign is ended for the
season.
Operations in I’nlgariajpresenf a
more active appearance, and skirrn
■’-lies and important engagements
ce frequently reported. The ob
•t of the Russians seems to be to
'trictly maintain the seige of Plev
(ia. while at the same time preven

Lorn and the Turkish forces in
the vicinity of Sofia from affording I
any aid to the besieged army <>t
