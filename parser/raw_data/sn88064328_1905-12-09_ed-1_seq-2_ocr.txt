59TH CONGRESS
NO UNUSUAL INCIDENS
ER PERFECT.
-WEATH
CANNON RE-ELECTED SPEAKER.
Formality of Draw.ng Seats Gone
Through—Minority Leader Wil
liams Made a Speech.
j
Washington. Dec. 5.—The assem
j blage yesterday of tihe members of
j the Fifty-Ninth Congress for their first
session was marked by no unusual in
cidents, but it attracted to the capitoi
crowds of spectators who took a live
ly interest in the proceedings.
The day was perfect. The sun
shone brightly and the air was keen.
Society was out in force and reserve
galleries were fil'ed, while visitors,
unable to find seats, roamed the cor
ridors to catch good glimpses of pub
lic men.
One noticeable feature was the ab
sence of flowers, which had been com
mon to the chambers. The absence of
floral tributes was due to a resolution
adopted unanimously by the Senate
and by the order of the Speaker of
the House, and robbed the occasion
of much of its picturesqueness.
The only coloring given to the cham
bers yesterday was that of tne gal
leries. where 'hundreds of handsomely
gowned women gave a splendor to
the event that made it the beginning
of the Congressional social season.
Senators Allison and Morgan were
appointed by Vice President Fairbanks
to notify the President that Congress
was ready for an communication he
desired to make.
The Senate was in session only
twenty minutes. Senators Aldrich,
Knox, Warner and Frazier took the
oath or office and an adjournment
was taken as a mark of respect to the
late Senator Piatt of Connecticut.
The preliminary steps to organize
were taken by the House. Joseph
Cannon of Illinois was re-elected as
Speaker, the members of the House
took oath of office and the floor em
ployes of both were re-elected; the
rules of the last Congress were adopt
ed and members went through the
formality of drawing for seats, all of
which was enlivened by the presenca
of the crowds In tihe galleries, the an
imation of thé reunion of veteran
members and the interest of new
ones.
In a brief speech against the adop
tion of the ruleä, the minority lead
er, Mr. Williams of Mississippi, touch
ed upon the interest of tariff legisla
tion aud told of the new Republican
"ideas" which were being wafted to
Washington on breezes from every
part of the country. These, tie said,
might be properly legislated for should
the "minority of the majority stand
with the Democratic members in op
posing the adoption of the old rules
and forming new ones, which permit
consideration of such legislation as
popular opinion might dictate."
Mr. Williams was asked by the
youngest member of tihe House, Mr.
Wharton of Illinois, for an explana
tion of what he had meant by the word
"kids" in asking for support In op
position to the rule from the new Rci
publican members. The retort wa«
instantaneous and caused a burst of
laughter at the young member's ex
pense. "With that degree of reverence
which tihe personal appearance of my
interrogator. excites in my mind, 1
Should say he would be the last mem
ber of this House to ask that ques
tion," said Mr. Williams.
A committee waB appointed to act
with the Senate committee on. notify
ing President Roosevelt that Con
gress was ready to transact business.
The rules committee and the commit
tee of mileage were appointed, and the
House adjourned after a session that
lasted three and a thalf hours, in com
pliance with resolutions on the death
of Senator Piatt of Connecticut and
Representative Marshall of Illinois.

Nature Teaches Inventors.
"We get our hints from nature,**
the inventor said. "Take, for instance,
the hollow pillar, which is stronger
than the solid one. The wheat straw
showed us the superior strength of
the hollow pillar. Solid, the wheat
straw would be unable to support its
head of grain.
"Where did man get Iiis idea of car
riage springs? From ?He hoofs of the
horse, which, like the springs derived
from them are made of parallel plates.
"Scissors we got from the jaws of
the tortoise, which are natural scis
! sors: chisels from the squirrel, who
j carries them in his mouth, adzes from
I the hippopotamus, whose ivories are
j adzes of the best design: the plane
i from the bee's jaws, the trip-hammer
I from the woodpecker."

Natural Bridge of Agate.
There is unending variety of marv
elous sights to be seen in the petri
fied forest covering thousands of acres
in the eastern part of Arizona, but
what is regarded as the greatest of all
is the bridge of petrified wood.
It Is a huge petrified tree-trunk span
ning a canyon like ravine fifty feet
wide—a bridge of agate and jasper
overhanging the only clump of living
trees within the forest's borders. Each
end of the log is embedded In shale
and sandstone, leaving 100 feet of It
either wholly or partly exposed.
So far. time has graciously spared
the Integrity of this natural curiosity^
int In the last few years the log has"
•egun to show signs of yielding to the
Matural Inclination of petrified trees,
I nd in several places transverse
cracks appear. Fearing that the bridge
would tumble to destruction the gov
ernment has recently had two stone
abutments erected under It, making
of It a bridge of three Bpans.

THE "COFFEE HEART."
It la as Dangerous as the Tobacco ar
Whisky Heart.
"Coffee heart" is common to many
c offee users and is liable to Bend the
owner to his or her long home If the
drug is persisted in. Yon can run 30
or 40 yards and find out if your heart
is troubled. A lady wbo was once a
victim of the "coffee heart" write#
from Oregon:
"I have been a habitual user of cof
fee all my life and have suffered very
much in recent years from ailments
which I became satisfied were directly
due to the poison in the beverage, such
as torpid liver and indigestion, which
In turn made my complexion blotchy
and muddy.
"Then my heart became affected. It
would beat most rapidly Just after 1
drank my coffee, and go below norma)
j *8 the coffee effect wore off. Some
times my poise would go as high as
137 beats to the minute. My family
were greatly alarmed at my condition
and at last mother persuaded me to
begin the use of Postum Food Coffee.
I gave up the old coffee entirely
»nd absolutely, and made Postum my
sole table beverage. ThlB was si*
months ago, and all my ills, the indi
gestion, inactive liver and rickety
heart action, have passed away, and
my complexion has become clear an®
natural. The improvement set 1®
very soon after I made the change,
just as soon as the coffee poison had
to work out of my system.
My husband has also been greatly,
benefited by the use of Postum, and
we find that a simple breakfast with
Postum is as satisfying and mora
strengthening than the old heavier
meal we used to have with the othee
kind of coffee." Name given by Postuia
