The President's Message.
EMANCIPATION.
most interesting and important part
f the President's Message is that por
, ', tioa relating to the conduct of the waraud
the execution of the proposed emancipation
plant. Upon this point, Mr. Lincoln forci
bly and truthfully says that 11 the dogmas
of a quiet past are inadequate to the stormy
present" The legislation which was ap
' propriate for a time of peace is not availa
ble in lime of war. Hence we must pro
ceed, in a measure without precedent, ,.
- disposing of the Tast interests Cir Sded to
the authorities durinstv Umof war
.., The occasion is pi'- difficully
' ne with tte ooca8ion In
"W Q ue relationship of slavery ti the
ar, the President proposes and urges
posals to be submitted to the Governments
of the States, to become parts of the Con
stitution , if ratified by three-fourth 9 of the
Legislatures. The first provides that all
' States abolishing slavery by their own act
before January 1st, 1900, shall receive com
pensation from the United States. This is
the gradual emancipation plan, first pro
posed to the Border States and now extend
ed to all the slave States. It gives the people
of those Btates nearly forty years' time in
which to accommodate themselves to the
new labor system, if they choose to take that
time. 8urely there is nothing in such
gradual emancipation as this, that the most
settled " Conservative " could object to. It
leaves the matter entirely with the States
and gives them abundant time in'which to
earry out the plan.
The second provides that all slaves set
free by the chances of war shall be forever
free, the loyal owners, if any, to be com
' pensated for their loss. This is but carry
ing out the articles of war adopted by Con
A gress at the last session, and is humane
and just. These slaves have been, willing
ly or unwillingly, the tools of the rebellion j
they escape from that service, or are torn
... from it, and are confiscated like anything
else of service to the enemy. They are and
have boen loyal, but have been forced to
do duty in the cause of the rebellion.
Considered as loyal men, our duty is clear
ly to set them free from their forced dis
loyalty ; as things, it is as clearly our duty
to deprive their masters of their servicos,
as we would confiscate males or guns.
The third amendment is that Congress
may appropriate money and otherwise pro
vide for, colonizing free colored persons
outside of the United States. It is notice-
- able that the expression used is " may pro
Tide." There is no compulsion in the
matter, and justly so, for events may, and
probably will demonstrate that the most
practical and useful disposition of the free
blacks is to keep them at work in this
country. The fields and plantations .of
the South will need them, and there
they will be the most at home
la their labors. When tho decree
of emancipation shall have taken
'. effect, the cotton, sugar and tobacco lands
will still remain in want of just the labor
that thenegroes can beBt furnish. General
Sailer is showing how this work of culti
., Taxing the South can be done. He has Stv
' questered immense estates in Louisiana
- to be held by the Government until the
-; loyalty of the owners is proved, if it can be.
. Meanwhile he has set the negroes at work
mnder proper supervision, paying them
' lair daily wages, and keeping regular ao-
- counts with them, at he would do with
aertherm laborers. If the plan should be
' : saceesiful, (and there it no apparent rea-
b- aaa why it should not,) then this may be
1 ' tht beginning of a policy that will obvi
ate any necessity or desire for coloniza-
ltioa.' " " j
These proposals of the President are ex-
" Urior to all other regularly adopted plant
for the restoration of the Union. Their
adoption is not necessary to the return of
( r the rebellions districts, nor yet trill they Hay
(Is war or tht proclamation of September 22d.
The prophecies of the conservatives, in
which the wish was father to the thought
that tht message would indicate an aban-
, doament of the emancipation scheme, are
shown to be false. The President will
stand by the proclamation as the wisest
and most efficacious plan for subduing the
rebellion. The President will not wait for
mew his suggestions to be adopted ; if they
are adopted at once, then restoration will
. ' essue and tht necessity for both the war
' and the Proclamation be removed'. ' He
evidently does not expect his plans to be
' acted upon during the month only that en
sues before the time for the issuing of the
-.' second Proclamation.
Upon the whole, the progressive aye,
the radical party, if you will, may feel
satisfied with the position of the Presi-
c dent upon this point. As usual, he sug-
gests more than he directly affirms, but
he leaves no doubt of the tact, express
ed in his reply to Horace Greeley, that it
it his desired wish " that all men every
where shall be free," and no advocate of
- emancipation could better express his sen
timents than in quoting the words of the
7 Message ittelf : '.. "i ' '.'.1 ' f
.-- il
"We say that we are for tie Union. "The
world will not forget that while we say
this, we do know now to save the t nion.
In giving freedom to the slaves, we ensure
freedom to the free and are honorable alike
in what we give and what we preserve. We
shall nobly save, or meanly lose the .last
best hope of the earth. Other means may
succeed ; this could not fail. The way is
plain, peaceful, generous -aad just. - -A
way which, if followed, the world will
forever applaud and the good must forever
oiess.
OTHER MATTERS.
Concerning our Foreign relations the
President says that some of the maritime
powers "unwisely and unsuccessfully" rec-
eognized the insurgents as beligeranls,
but this action proved only less injurious
to them than to our own country. The
treaty with Great Britain has been put
into operation with a good prospect of
complete success. Proposals for, conven
tions to settle private grievances of indi
viduals of our own and other lands have
been made to Great Britain, France, Spain
ind Prusdia, none of which have yet
adopted the suggestion. Our general re
lations with Foreign countries has been
undisturbed. -
The President hat favored the Atlantio
Telegraph and the construction of a tele
graph from San Francisco to Asia, by a
line across the Russian Empire.
It is suggested that the mineral re-
sou roes of the territories be explored and
reported upon, to show in comprehensive
form their commercial value.' The admis
sion of new States from the territories it
favored.
The finances of the country receive care
ful attention. The publio credit has been
fully maintained, but careful legislation
is necesBaiy to provide the increased rev
enue required to continue the war and
meet the increased disbursements. A
tpeedy return to specie payment ehould be
kept in view. Prompt convertibility into
coin is the best and surest safe-guard
against fluctuations in currency, and it is
extremely doubtful if a circulation of
United States notes can be made perma
nently useful and safely maintained. No
plan, in the opinion of tne President,
promises so certain and unobjectionable
results as the organisation of banking in
stitutions under act of Congress, to which
the Government would furnish circulating
notes on the security of U. S. Bonds.
The reports from the Departments are
but briefly referred to. A convention with
foreign countries is favored, for the pur
pose of simplifying the rates of postage.
A change in the Indian system is suggest
ed. The Department of Agriculture has
been organised, which promises to be pro
ductive of beneficial results. It will soon
be ready to distribute seeds, cuttings, 4-c.
Of Emancipation, -we have spoken at
length above. In respect to disunion, the
President quotes from his Inaugural to
show the impossibility of separation.
Transportation for our Army.
But little idea can be had by the general
reader of the labor attending the transpor
tation of supplies for an army. A corres
pondent makes an estimate that allowing
four pounds per day per man, it will re
quire 2,850 net tons for one week's sub
sistence for 200,000 men. To supply the
aarmt demand of an army of 150,000 men
at five pounds each, and accumulate a ten
day's supply, will necessitate the trans
portation of 7,500 tons. .This estimate does
not include the most bulky portion of sup
pliesforage for the animals. A large
part of this, in the present bare condition
of the country, must also be hauled in
wagons over the same roads by which the
food is transported. This would furnish a
full cargo for four first-class Liverpool
ships each ten days. The forage will keep
in constant employment a fleet of 200
schooners of 150 tons each. To all this let
it be remembered there should be added
the cumbrous pontoon trains, and trans
portation for thousands of horses and mules
required for keeping up the working force
of the army. No estimate is here made for
ammunition and miscellaneous sapplies.
Unparalleled Meanness.
There hat never been a meaner
more utterly despicable act performed,
than was perpetrated at the residence of
Bev. Henry Ward Beecher on Thanksgiv
ing night. Mr. Beecher was at his church,
aiding in making comfortable a regiment
from Maine, who had no other place in
which to pass the night. He spent the
evening in administering to their wants,
and on returning to his home on Brooklyn
Heights, found that some dastardly mis
eroants bad Uken advantage of his absence
to besmear his house with a mixture of
vile substances, which rendered a horribly
offensive odor. The house being construct
ed of brown stone, readily absorbed tbo
application, so that it will be impossible to
renovate it. ' The perpetrators of such a
cowardly and fiendish act deserve to be fed
upon their own preparation until a speedy
day shall arrive for their execntion.-
- ;
Election in Tennessee.
General Andrew Johnson hat issued a
proclamation calling for an election of
Members of Congress from Tennessee. A
letter from President Lincoln strongly ap
proves of and urges this course to that
State, as follows :
ExxccTivi Maxsiox, Washington, V
October 21, ltaa. .
"Major General Grant, Governor John"
son, and all having military, naval and
civil authorities under the United States,
within the Slate of Tennessee : The bearer
of this, Thomas R. Smith, a citizen of Ten
nessee, goes to that State, seeking to have
such of the people thereof as desire to.
avoid the unsatisfactory prospect before
them, and to have peace again upon the
old terms under the Constitution of the
United States, te manifest such desire by
election of members to the Congress of the
United States particularly, and perhaps a
legislature, State officers, and a United
States Senator, friendly to their object. ; I
shall be glad for you and each of you to
aid him, and all others acting for this -object,
as much as possible. In all available
ways give the people a chance to express
their wishes at these elections. Fellow
law andformsof law as far as convenient;
but, at all events, get the expression of the
largest number of the people possible.
All see how such action will connect with
and affect the proclamation of September
22. Of course the men elected should be
gentlemen of character, willing to swear
to support the Constitution at of old, and
known to be above reasonable suspicion of
A. LINCOLN.
Petroleum.
Petroleum, or mineral oil, says the Ca
nadian Journal of Art, is not derived from
coal. It says: "Petroleum was formed
long before the coal, and is the result of
the decomposition, nnder pressure, of an
infinite number of oil-yielding animals,
which swarmed the seat of the Devonian
period long anterior to the ooaL"
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fdlov OUtirn of tht Senate and House of fiep
reeetitative :
Since your last assembling, another
year of health and bountiful harvests has
passed, and while it has not pleased the
Almighty to bless us with a return of
peaev we cannot but press on, guarded by
the best light he gives us, trusting that in
his own time and wise way all will be
well.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
correspondence touching foreign af.
fairs which has taken place during the
last year is herewith submitted in virtual
compliance with a request to that enect,
made by the Hjuse of Representatives near
the close of the past session of Congress.
If the conditions of our relations with
other nations is less gratifying than it has
usually been at former periods, it is cer
tainly more satisfactory than a nation so
unhappily distracted as we are, might rea
sonably havo apprehended.
In the month of June last there were
some grounds to-cxpect that the maritime
powers which, at the beginning of our do
mestic difficulties, so unwisely and so un
successfully as we think, recognized the
inturgentt as a belligerent power would
soon recede from that position which has
proved only less injurious to themselves
than to our oountry.
But the temporary reverses which after
wards befel the national arms, and which
were exaggerated by our own disloyal cit
isont abroad, have hitherto delayed that
act of simple justice. The civil war, which
bis to radically changed for the moment
the occupations and habits of the American-
"people, aat necessarily disturbed the
social conditions and affected very deeply
the prosperity of the nations with which
we have carried on a commerce that has
been steadily increasing throughout a pe
riod of half a century. Ithat, at the same
time, excited political ambitions and ap
prehensions, which have produced a pro
found agitation throughout the civilized
world, in this nnnsual agitation we have
foi borne taking part in any controversy
between parties and factions in any such
States. " We have attempted no propagand
ist and acknowledged no revolution, but
we have left to every nation the exclusive
conduct and management of its own af
fairs. Our strueele has been of course
contemplated by foreign nations with ref
erence, less to its own merits, than to its
Supposed and often exaggerated effects,
and the consequences resulting to those
nations themselves.
Nevertheless, complaint on the part of
this Government, even if it were just, would
certainly be unwise.
SLAVE TRADE TREATY.
The treaty with Great Britain for the
suppression of the slave trade has been put
into operation with a good prospect of com
plete success. It is an occasion of special
pleasure to acknowledge that the execu
tion of it on the part of Her Majesty's gov
ernment has been marked with a jealous
respect for the authority of the United
States and the rights of their moral and
loyal citizens.
The convention with Hanover lor tne
abolition of the State dues has been car
ried into full effect, under the act of Con
gress for that purpose.
INDIVIDUAL GRIEVANCES.
A blockade of 8,000 miles of sea-coast
could not be established and rigorously en
forced in a season of great commercial ac
tivity like the present, without committing
occasional mistakes and inflicting unin
tentional injuries upon foreign nations
and their subjects. A civil war occurring
in a country where foreigners Tcside and
oarry on a trade under treaty stipula
tions is necessarily fruitful of complaints
of the violations of neutrel rights. All
such collisions tend to excite misappre
hensions and, possibly, to produce nation
al reclamations between nations which
have a common interest in preserving
peace and friendship.
. In clear c&aes of these kinds, I have, so
far as possible, heard and redressed com
plaints which have been referred by friend
ly powers. There is, however, a large and
augumenting number of doubtful cases
upon which the government is unable to
agree with the governments whose protec
tion is demanded by the claimants. There
are, moreover, many cases in which the
United States, or their citizens, sutler
wronzs from naval or military authorities
of foreign nations, which the government
of these States are not at once prepared to
redress. I have proposed to some of the
foreign States, thus interested, mutuol con
ventions, to examine and adjust such com
plaints. This proposition has been made
especially to Great Gritain, to France, to
Spain and to Prussia, in each case it has
been kindly received, but has not yet
been formally adopted.
I deem it my duty to recommend an ap
propriation in behalf of the owners of the
Norwegian barque Admiral P. Torciens
Riola, which vessel was in May, 1861, pre
vented by the Commander of the blockad
ing force off Charleston, from leaving that
port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar
privilege had shortly before been granted
to an English vessel.
I have directed the (Secretary ot oiate to
cause the papers in the case to be commu
nicated to the proper committees.
COLONIZATION.
uiauy free Americans of African descent
lo fvor their emigration with a view to
mi.:li colonization as was contemplated in
recent acts of Congress. Other parlies, at
borne aud abroad, some from interested
and other nations, have suggested similar
measures, whilo on the other hand several
of the Spanish American P.cpublics have
protested against the sending of such col
onics to their respective territories.
Under these circumstances, 1 nave de
clined to move any such- colony to any
State without first obtaining the consent
of its Government, with an aggrementon
Us part to receive and protect such emi
grants in all their rights as freemen, and I
have at the same time offered to the sever
al States, situated in the tropics or having
colonies there, to negotiate with them on
the subject, with the advice and consent of
the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigra
tion of persons of that class to their respec
tive territories upon conditions which
shall be equal, just and humane.
Liberia and Hayti are, as yet, tne oniy
countries to which colonists of African de
scent from here could go with certainty of
being received and adopted as citizens;
and I regret to lay that such persons con
templating colonization do not seem as
willing to emigrate to these countries as
to some others, nor as willing as I think
their interest demands. I believe, howev
er, that the opinion is improving, and that
ere long there will be an augmented and
considerable emigration to ootn tnest
countries from the United States.
COMMERCIAL RELATIONS.
The aew commercial treaty
United States and the Sultan of Turkey
has been carried into execution. A com
mercial and consular treaty has been ne
gotiated, subject to the Senate's consent,
with Libaria, and a similar negotiation it
now pending with the Republic of Hayti.
A considerable improvement of the na
tional commerce is expected to result from
these measures. '
Our relations with Great Britain, Franoe,
Spain, and Portugal, ; Russia, Prussia,
Denmark, Sweden, and Austria, the Neth
erlands, Italy, Rome, and the other Europe
an States remain undisturbed. Very fa
vorable relations also continue to be main
tained with Turkey, Morocco, China, and
Japan.
During the last year there has not only
been no change of our previous relations
with the independent States of our conti
nent, but more friendly sentiments than
have been hertofore existing are believed to
be entertained by these neighbors whose
safety and progress are to intimately con
nected with our own. This statement es
pecially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica, Ni-
earauga, Honduras, Pern and Chili. T.
commission under the convention with the
Republic of New Grenada, closed its ses
sion without having audited and passed
upon all the claims which were submitted
to it
A proposition is pending to revive the
convention that it may be able to do more
complete justice.
' The commission between the United
States and the Republic of Costa Rica lias
completed its labors and submitted its re
OCEANIC TELEGRAPH.
I have favored the project of connecting
the United States with Europe by an At
lanta telegraph, and a similar project to
extend the telegraph from San Francisco
to connect, by a Pacific telegraph wire,
with the wire that is being extended across
the Russian Empire.
THE TERRITORIES.
The territories of the United States, with
unimportant exceptions, have remained un
disturbed by the civil war, and they are
exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as
justifies an expectation that some of them
will soon be in a condition to be organized
as States, and be constitutionally admitted
into the Federal Union. ' The immense
mineral resources of some of these terri
tories ought to be developed as rapidly as
possible.
Every step in that direction would have
a tendency to improve the revenues of the
government, and diminish the burdens of
the people.
It is worthy of your serious considera
tion whether some extraordinary measures
to promote that end cannot be adopted.
The measure which suggests itself as most
likely to be effective is a scientific explora
tion of the mineral regions in these terri
tories with a view to the publication of its
results at home and in foreign countries;
results which cannot fail to be auspicious.
THE FINANCES.
The condition of the finances will
claim your most diligent consideration.
The vast expenditures, incident to the
military and naval operations required for
the suppression of the rebellion, have hith
erto been met with a promptitude and cer
tainty unusual in similar circumstances,
and the publio credit has been fully main
tained. The continuance of the war, how
ever, and the increased disbursements
made necessary, demand your best reflec
tions as to the best modes of providing the
necessary revenue, without injury to
business, and with the least possible
burdens npon labor. The snspension.of
specie payment by the banks made large
issues of United states notes unavoidable.
In no othe way could the payment of the
troops and the satisfaction of other just
demands be so economically or as well
provided for. The judicious legislation
of Congress, securing the receivability of
these notes for loans and internal duties,
and making them a legal tender for other
debts, has made them a universal curren
cy, and has satisfied partially, at least,
and for the time the long felt want of a
uniform circulating medium, saving there
by to the people immense sums in discount
and exchange.
A return to specie payments, however,
at the earliest period compatible with a
due regard to all interests should ever be
kept in view. Fluctuations in the value
of currency are always injurious, and to
reduce these fluctuations to the lowest pos
sible point, will always be a leading pur
pose in wise legislation. Prompt and
certain convertibility into coin is
generally acknowledged to be the
best and surest against them, and it
is extremely doubtful whether a cir
culation of United States notes, payable in
coin and sufficiently large for the wants of
the people, can be permanently useful and
safely maintained. Is there any other
mode in which the necessary provision for
the public wants can be made, and the
great advantages of a safe and uniform
currency secured? I know ofnono which
promises so certain results, and at the
same time so unobjectionable, as the or
ganization of banking associations under
a general act of Congress, well guarded in
its provisions.
To such associations the Government
might furnish circulating notes on the se
curity of United States bonds, deposited in
the treasury. These notes, prepared under
the supervision of proper officers, being
uniform in appearance and security, and
convertible always into coin, would at
once protect labor against the evils of a
vicious currency, and facilitate commerce
by cheap and safe exchange. A moderate
reservation from the interest on the bonds
would compensate the United States for the
preparation and distribution of the notes
and a general supervision of the system,
and would lighten the burden of that por
tion of the public debt employed as secu
rity. The public credit, moreover, would be
greatly improved, and the negotiation of
new loans greatly facilitated by the steady
market demand for bovernment bonds
which the adoption of the proposed system
ould create. It is sn additional recom
mendation of the measure of considerable
weight in my judgment, that it would re
concile, as far as possible, all existing in
terests by the opportunity offered to ex
isting institutions to reorganize, under the
act, substituting only the uniform nation
al circulation for the local and various cir
culations, secured and unsecured, now is
sued by tliem.
CONDITION OF THE TREASURY.
The receipts into tho Treasury from all
sources, including loans and balances from
the proceeding year, for the fiscal year end
ing on the 30th of June, 1302, were $583,
885,247 66, of which sum $-19,058,397 62
were derived from customs; l,7HS,8Jl 73
from the direct tax; from publio lands
$162,203 77; from miscellaneous sources
$931,789 64; from loans in all forms $529,-
092,360 60. The renainder, $257,065 50,
was the balance from last year.
The disbursements, during the same pe
riod were: For Congressional, Executive
and Judicial purposes, $5,939,01 29; for
foreign intercourse, $1,239,710 35; for
miscellaneous expenses including the
mints, loans, post office deficiencies, col
lection of revenue and other like charges,
$14,129,771 50.
For expenses under the Interior Depart
ment, $3,102,985 62: andcr the War De
partment, $394,308,407 38 ; under the Na
vy Department, -42,674,589 69; for inter
est on the publio debt, $13,100,824 45 ; and
for the payment of the public debt, inclu
ding reimbursement of temporary loan and
redemption, $96,096,923 09, making an ag
gregate of $570,841,700 25, and leaving a
balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of
July, 1802, of $13,043,440 81. It Bhould
be observed that the turn of $96,096,92369,
expended for reimbursements and redemp
tion of the public debt, being included also
in the loans made, may be properly de
ducted both from the receipts and expen
ditures, leaving the actual receipts for the
year $487,788,824 97, and the expendi,
tures, $474,744,788 16.
Other information on the subject of fi
nance! will be given in the report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, to whose state
ments and views I invite your candid and
considerate attention.
NAVY AND THE ARMY.
The reports of the Secretary of the Navy
and War are herewith transmitted. These
reports, though lengthy, are scarcely mort
than brief extract! of the very numerous
and extensive transactions and operations
conducted through these Departments. Nor
could I give a summary of them here npon
any principle which would admit of its
being much shorter than the reports them
selves. I therefore content myself with
laying the reports before you, and asking
yout attention to them.
POST OFFICE.
It gives me pleasure to report a decided
improvement in the finanoial condition of
the Pott Office Department, at compared
with the teveral preceding years.
The receipts for the fiscal year 1881,
amounted to $8,349,290 40,-whioi am.
- J the revenue from all States of the
J u.or for three- qnnnra of thnt year.
Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue
from tiie sovoalled Confederate States dur
ing tht last fiscal year, the increase of the
correspondence of the loyal States has been
sufficient to produce a revenue the same
year of $8,299,820 90, being only $50,000
less than was derived from all the States
of the Union the previous year.
, The expenditures show a- still more fa
vorable result.' The amount expended in
1861 was $13,606,789 IL For the last
year the amount has been reduced to $11,
125,364 13, showing a difference of about
$2,487,000 in the expenditures as com
pare with the preceding year, and about $3,
750,000 as compared with the fiscal year
of 1800. The deficiency in the department
for the previous year was $4,551,96698.
For the last fiscal year it was reduced to
$2,112,814 67. These favorable results are
in part owing to the cessation of mail con
veyances in the insurrectionary States,
and in part to a casual review of all ex
penditures in that department in the inter
est of economy.
The efficiency of the postal service, it is
believed has also been much improved.
The Postmaster General also opened a cor
respondence through the Department of
State with foreign governments, proposing
a Convention of postal representatives for
the purpose of simplifying the rates of for
eign postage, and to expedite the foreign
mails, the proposition is equally important
to our adopted citizens and to the commer
cial interests of this country has been fav
orably entertained, and agreed to by all
the governments from whom replies have
been received. I ask the attention of Con
gress to the suggestion of the Postmaster
General in his report respecting the fur
ther legislation required in his opinion
for the benefit of the postal service.
THE INTERIOR.
The Secretary of the Interior reports as
follows in regard to publio lands : The
public lands have ceased to be a source of
revenue. From the 1st of July, 1861, to
the 30th of September, 1862, the entire
cash receipts from the sales of public lands
were $137,477,26, a sum much less than
the expenses of our land system during
the same period.
The homestead law which will take effect
on the 1st of January next, offers such in
ducements to settlers that sales for cash
cannot be expected to an extent sufficient
to meet the expenses of the general land
office, and cost of surveying and bringing
the land into market.
The discrepancy between the sums here
stated at arising from the tales of publio
lands and the sum derived from the same
source, as reported from the Treasury de
partment, arises, as I understand, from the
fact that the periods of time, though ap
parently, were not really coincident at the
beginning point. The Treasury report in
cludes a considerable sum now which had
previously been reported fromthe Interior,
sufficiently large to greatly overreach the
sum deprived from the three months now
reported upon by the Interior, and not by
the
THE INDIAN WAR.
The Indian tribes upon our frontiers
have, during the past year, manifested a
spirit of insubordination, and at several
points engaged in open hostilities against
the white settlers in their vicinity. The
tribes occupying the Indian country south
of Kansas renounced their allegiance with
the United States and entered into a trea
ty -with the insurgents. Those who re
mained loyal to the United States were
dtiven from the country. The Chief of the
Cherokees has visited this city for the pur
pose of restoring the former relations of
the tribe with the United Btates. tie al
leges that they were constrained by supe
rior force to enter into treaties with the in
surgents, and that the United States neg
lected to furnish the protection which their
treaty stipulation required. In the month
of August last, the Sioux Indians, in Min
nesota, attacked the settlers in their vi
cinity, with extreme ferocity, killing in
discriminately men, women and children.
The attack was wholly unexpected, and,
therefore, no defense had been provided.
It is estimated that not less than 300 per
sons were killed by the Indians,and a large
amount of property was destroyed. How
this outbreak was induced is not definitely
known, and suspioions, which may be un
just, need not be stated. Information was
received by the Indian Bureau from differ
ent sources about the time hostilities were
commenced, that a simultaneous attack
was to be made upon the white settlements
by all the tribes between the Mississippi
river and the Rocky Mountains.
The State of Minnesota has suffered great
injury from the Indian war. A large por
tion of her territory has been depopulat
ed, and a severe loss has been sustained by
the destruction or property, the people ot
that State manifest much anxiety for the
removal of the tribes beyond the limits of
the State, as a guarantee against future
hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian
affairs will furnish full details.
INTER-COMMUNICATION.
I submit for your especial consideration
whether our Indian system shall not be
remodeled. Many wise and good men
have been impressed with the belief that
this can be profitably done.
1 submit a statement of the proceedings
of the Commissioners, which shows the
progress that has been made in the enter
prise of constructing the Pacific Railroad,
and this suggests the earnest completion
of the road, and also the favorable action
of Congress upon the projects now pending
before them, for enlarging the capacities of
the great canals in few lork and Illinois,
as beingof vital and rapidly inoreastng
importance to the whole nation, and es
pecially to the vast interior regions here
inafter to be noticed at some greater
length. I propose having prepared and
hud before you, at an earlj day, some in
teresting and valuable statistical informa
tion npon this subject. The military and
commercial importance of enlarging the
lllintos and Michigan Canal, and improv
ing the Illinois River, it presented in the
report of CoL Webster to the Secretary of
War, and now transmitted to uongress. i
respctfully ask your attention to it
AGRICULTURE.
earry
Congress of the 15th of May last, I have
caused the Department cf Agriculture of
the United States to be organized. The
Commissioner informs me that within the
period of a few months, this department
hat established an extensive system of
correspondence and exchanges, both at
home and abroad, which promises to effect
highly beneficial results in the develop
ment of a correct knowledge of recent im
provements in agriculture, in the intro
duction of new products, and in the col
lection of the agricultural statistics of the
different States; also, that it will soon be
prepared to distribute largely, seeds, cere
als, plants and cuttings, and has already
published and liberally diffused much val
uable information in anticipation of a
more elaborate report which will in due
time be furnished, embracing some valua
ble tests in chemical science now in pro
gress in tht labaratory. The creation of
this Department was for the more immedi
ate benefit of a large class of our most val
uable citizens, and I trust that the liberal
basis npon which it has been organized,
will not only meet your approbation, but
that it will realize at no distant day all the
fondest anticipations of its most sanguine
friends, and become the fruitful source of
advantage to all our people.
EMANCIPATION AND DISUNION.
day a pro
clamation was issued by the Executive, a
copy of which it herewith submitted. In
accordance with the purposes expressed in
the second paragraph ef that paper, I now
respectfully recall your attention to what
may be called 'compensated emancipa
tion." -A nation may be said to consist of
its territory, its people, its laws. The ter
ritory it the only part which It of certain
durability. "One generation paaaeth
wy and acotiior genmtioa wmeta, but
the earth abideth forever." It' ji the first
importance to duly consi lo" -ti 1 estimate
this niver ending part. TUnt portion of
the earth's surface which- is owned and
inhabited by the p'tp'r af the United
Slates, is well adapted to the home of one
national family, anditis not well adapted
for two or more. Its vast extent and its
variety of climate and productions, are of
advantage in the age of one people, what
ever they might have been in former ages.
Steam, and telegraphs, and intelligence,
have brought these to be an advantageous
combination for one united people.
In the Inaugural Address I briefly point
ed out the total inadequacy of disunion as
a remedy for differences between the peo
ple of the two sections. I did so in lan
guage which I cannot improve, and which,
therefore, I beg to repeat
One section of our country believes
slavery is right and ought to be extended,
while the other believes it is wrong and
ought not to be extended. This is the only
substantial dispute.
The fugitive slave clause of the Consti
tution and the law for the suppression of
the African Blave trade, are each as well
enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be
in a community where the moral sense of
the people imperfectly supports the law it
self. The great body of the people abide
by the legal obligations in both cases, and
a few break over each. This, I think, can
not be perfectly cured, aud it would be
worse in both instances after separation of
the sections than before.
The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly
suppressed, would be ultimately revived
without restriction in one section, while
fugitives, now only partially surrendered,
would not be surrendered at all by the
other. Physically speaking, we cannot
separate. We cannot remove our respec
tive sections from each other, nor build an
impassible wall between them. A hus
band and wife may be divorced and go out
of the presence and beyond the reach of
each other, but the different parts of our
country cannot do this.' -
They cannot but remain face to face, and
intercourse, either amicable or hostile,
must eontinue between them. Is it possi
ble then to make that intercourse more ad
vantageous or more satisfactory after sep
aration than before ? Can aliens make
treaties easier than friends can make
laws? Can treaties be more faithfully
enforced between aliens than laws can
among friends ? Suppose you go to war,
you cannot fight always, and when after
much loss on both sides, and no gain on
either, you cease fighting, the identical old
questions as to terms of intercourse are
again upon you.
There is no line, straight or crooked,
suitable for a national boundary, upon
which to divide. Trace through from east
to west, upon the line between the free
and slave country, and we shall find a lit
tle more than one-third of its length are
rivers easy to be crossed, and populated,
or soon to be populated, thickly upon both
sides, while in nearly all its remaining
length are merely surveyor's lines, over
which people may walk back and forth
without any consciousness of their pres
ence. No part of this line can be made
any more difficult to pass by writing it
down on paper or parchment as a National
boundary.
The fact of separation, if it comes, gives
upon the part of the Beceeding section the
fugitive slave clause, along with all other
constitutional obligations upon the section
seceded from, while I should expect no
treaty stipulation would ever be made to
take its place.
But there is another difficulty: The
great interior region, bounded east by the
Alleghanies, north by the British domin
ions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and
south by the line along which the cultiva
tion of corn and cotton mets, and which
includes part of Virginia, part of Tennes
ee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Wis
consin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa
and Minnesota, and the Territories of Da
eotah, Nebraska, and a part of Colorado,
have above ten millions of people, and will
have fifty millions within fifty years, if not
prevented by any political folly or mistake.
It contains more than one-third of the
country owned by the revolted States, cer
tainly more than one million of surface
miles; one-half as populous as Massachu
setts already is, it would have more than
seventy-five millions of people. A glance
at the map Bhows that, territorially speak
ing, it is the great body of the
Republic. The other parts - are . but
marginal borders to it, the magnificent re
gion sloping west from the Rocky Moun
tains to the Pacific, being the deepest and
also the richest in undeveloped resources in
the production of provisions, grains,
grasses, and all which proceeds from them.
This great interior region is naturally one
of the most important in the world. As
certain from the statistics the small pro
portion of the region which has not as yet
been brought into cultivation, and also the
large and rapidly increasing amount of its
products, and we shall be overwhelmed
with the magnitude of the prospect pre
sented, and yet this region has no sea
coast, touches no ocean anywhere. As
part of one nation its people now may find,
and may forever find their way to Europe
by New York, to South America andAfrioa
by New Orleans, and to Asia by San
Francisco.
But separate our common country into two
nations, as designed by the present rebel
lion, and every man in this great interior
region is thereby cut off from some one or
more of these outlets, not perhaps by a
physical barrier, but by embarrassing and
onerous trade regulations, and this is true
wherever a dividing or boundary line may
be fiied. Place it between the now free
and slave country, or place it south of Ken
tucky, or north of Ohio, and still the
truth remains that nono south of it can
trade to any port or place north of it, and
none north of it can trade to any port or
place south of it, except upon terms dic
tated by a government foreign to them.
These outlets, east, west and south, are in
dispensable to the well being of the peo
ple inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast in
terior region. Which of the three may be
the best is no proper question ; all are bet
ter than either, and all of right belong to
th'it jirople and to their successors forever.
True to themselves, they will not ask
where a line of separation shall be, but
will vow rather that that there shall be no
such line. Nor are the marginal regions
less interested in these communications to
and through them to the great outside
world. They do, and each one of them
must have accees to their Egypt of the
west, without paying toll at the crossing
of any national boundary. Our national
strife springs not from our permanent
part, not from the lands we inhabit, not
from our national homestead. There
is no possible swerving of this but
would multiply and not mitigate evils
among us. In all its adaptations and
attitudes, it demands Union and abhors
separation. In fact, it would, ere long,
force reunion, however much of blood and
treasure the separation might have cost
Our strife pertains to ourselves, to the
passing generations of men, and it cannot
without convulsion be hushed for ever,
with the passing of rne generation. With
this view I recommend the following reso
lution and articles amendatory to the Con
stitution of the United States.
Eetolved, By the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America, in Congress assembled, two
thirds of both Houses concurring, that the
following Articles be proposed to tho Leg
islatures or Conventions of the several
States, as amendments to the Constitution
of the United States, all or any of which
articles, when ratified by three-fourths of
the said Legislatures or Conventions, to be
valid as part or parts of the said Constitu
tion, namely: - - - -
Article. Every State wherein slavery
now exists, which shall abolish the tame
therein, at any time or timet before the
first day of January, in the year of our
Lord 1900, than receive compensation
from the United State at follows, to wit :
The President of the United States shall
deliver to every such Statt bonds of the
United States, bearing interest at the rate
of , for each slave shown to have been
therein by the eighth census of the United
States, said bends to be delivered to said
States by installments, or in one parcel at
the completion of the abolishment, accord
ingly as the same shall have been gradual
or at one time, within such State; and in
terest shall begin to run upon any such
bonds only from the proper time of its de
livery and afterwards. Any Suite having
received bonds aa aforesaid, and after
wards introducing or tolerating slavery
therein, shall refund to the United 'Slates.
the bonds so received, or the value thereof,
and all interest paid thereon.
Article. All slaves who shall have en
joyed actual freedom by the chances of the
war, at any time before the end of the re
bellion, shall be forever free, but all
owners of such, who shall not have been
disloyal, shall be compensated for them at
the same rates as is provided for States
adopting abolishment of slavery, but in
such a way that no slave shall be twice
accounted for.
Article. Congress may appropriate
money, or otherwise provide or colonising
free colored persons with their own eon
sent, at any place or places within the
United States.
I beg indulgence to discuss these pro
posed articles at some length. Without
slavery the rebellion should never have ex
isted. Without Blavery it eouH not con
tinue. Among the friends of the Union
there is great diversity of sentiment and
policy in regard tc Blavery and the African
race amongst ns. Some would abolish it
suddenly and without compensation. Some
would abolish it gradually and with com
pensaticn. Some would remove the free
people fro 3i us, and some would retain
them with us, and there are yet other mi
nor diversities. Because of these diversi
ties we waste much strength in struggles
amongst ourselves. By mutual concession
we should harmonize and act together.
This would be a compromise among the
friends and not with the enemies of the
Union.
These articles are intended to embody a
plan of such mutual concession. If the
plan shall be adopted it is assumed that
emancipation will follow, at least, in sev
eral of the states.
In the first article the main points are
first, the emancipation; second, the length
of time for consummating 37 years; and
third, the compensation. The emancipa
tion will be unsatisfactory to the advocates
of perpetual slavery; but the length of
time should greatly mitigate their dissat
isfaction. The time saves both races from
the evils of sudden derangement, in fact,
from the necessity of any derangement ;
while most of those whose habitual course
of thought will be disturbed by the meas
ure, will have passed away before
its consummation they will, never see
it Another class will hail the prospect
of emancipation, but will deprecate
the length of time. They will feel that it
gives too little to the now living slaves;
but it really gives them much. It saves
them from the vagrant destitution
which must largely attend immediate
emancipation, in localities where their
numbers are very great, and it gives the
inspiring assurance that their posterity
shall be free forever. The plan leaves to
each State choosing to act under it, to
abolish slavery now or at the end of the
century or at any intermediate time, or by
degrees extending ever the whole or any
part of that period, and it obliges no two
States to proceed alike. It also provides
for compensation, and generally the mode
of making it This, it would seem, must
further mitigate the dissatisfaction of
those who favor perpetual slavery,
especially those who are to receive
compensation. Doubtless some of those
who are to pay and not to receive will
object Yet that the measure is both just
and economical is certain. The liberation
of the slaves is the destruction of property
acquired by descent and by purchase, the
same as any other property. It is no less
true for having been often said, that the
people of the South are no more responsi
ble for the introduction of this property
than are the people of the North, and when
it is remembered how unhesitatingly we
all use cotton and sugar, and share the
profits of dealing in them, it may not be
quite safe to say that the South has been
more responsible than the North for its
eontinuanee. If then, for a common ob
ject, this property is to be sacrificed, is it
not just that it be done at a common
charge? And if with less money, or
money more easily paid, we can preserve
the benehts of the Union by tnis means
than we can by the war alone, is it
not economical to do it? Let us consider
it then. Let us ascertain the sum
we have expended in the war, since com
pensated emancipation was proposed last
March, and consider whether if that meas
ure had been promptly accepted by even
some of the slave States, the same sum
would not have done more to close the war
than has been otherwise done. If so, the
measure would save money, and in that
view, would be a prudent and economical
measure certainly. It is not so easy to
pay something as it is to pay nothing, but
it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to
pay a larger one, and it is easier to pay
any sum when we are able, than it is to
pay it before we are able. The war re
quires them at once. The aggregate sum
necessary for ' compensated emancipation
of course would be large, but it would re
quire no ready cash nor bondsman, any
faster than the emancipation progresses.
This might not, and probably would not
olose before the end of the thirty-seven
years. At that time we shall probably
have 100,000,000 people to share tho bar
den instead of 81,000,000 as now ; and not
only so, but the increase of ourpopulstiot
may be expected to continue for a long
time after the period as rapidly as before,
because our territories will not have be
come fulL ' ;
POPULATION.
the same ratio of increase which we have
maintained on an average from our first
national census in 1790 uutil that of I860,
we should, in 1900, have a population of
103,208,415, and why may we not continue
that ratio far beyond that period ? Our
abundant room, our broad national home
stead is an ample resource. Were our ter
ritory as limited as are the British Isles,
certainly our population could not expand
as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign
born as now, we should be compelled to
send part of the native born away ; but
such is not our condition. We have 2,
963,000 square miles. Europe has 3.800,
000, with a population averaging 73 1-3
persons to the square mile.
Why may not our country, at tome time,
average as many? Is it less fertile ? Has
it more waste surface by mountains, riv
ers, lakes, deserts and other causes ? Is it
inferior to Europe in any natural advan
tage ? If, then, we are at some time to be
as populous as Europe, how soon? As to
when this may be, we may judge from the
past and the present As to whether it
will ever be, depends much on whether we
maintain the Union. Several of our States
are above the average of European popula
tion af 73 to the square mile. Massachu
setts has 157; Rhode Island, 133; New
York and Jiew Jersey, each, 80; also two
other great States Pennsylvania and Ohio
are not far below, the former having 63
and the latter 09. The States already
above the European average, except New
York, have increased in as rapid a ratio
since passing that point as ever before,
while no one of them is equal to tome oth
er parts of our country in natural capacity
for sustaining a dense population.
Taking thernation in the aggregate, we
find its population and ratio of increase
for the several decimal periods to be as
follows: 1790, 3,929,827; 1800,6,805,937.
Ratio of increase, 35 62-100 percent 1810,
7,239,814. Ratio 36 45-100. 1320,9,688,181.
Ratio 83 13-100. 1830, 10,886,020. Ratio
3S 49-100. 1840, 17,089,453. Ratio 82
67-100. 1850, 23,193,876. Ratio 35 87-100.
18C0t 81,433, TOO. Ratio 85 68-100. . This
shows an average decimal Increase ef 84
60-100 per cent in population through the
seventy years from our first to our last
census taken. Il U seen that the ratio of
increasa at no one of these seven periods
is either two per cent below or two per
cent above the average; thus showing
now lnnexiote, ana consequently now re
liable, the law of increase in our case is.
Assuming that it will continue it gives the
following results: 1870, 42,323,372; 1880,
66.966,216; 1990, 76,677,872; 1900, 103,
208,415; 1910, 133,918,526; 1920. 186,984
335; 1930, 251,680,914.
These figures show that our conn try may
be as populous as Europe, at some point
between 1920 and 1930 say about 1925,
our territory, at 73J to the square mile, be
ingof the capacity to contain 217,136,000;
and we will reach this, too, if we do not
ourselves relinquish the chances by thefol
ly and evils of disunion, or by long, ex
hausting war, springing from the only
great element of discord among us. While
it cannot be foreseen exactly how much
one huge example of secession, breeding
lesser ones indefinitely, wonld retard the
population, civilization and property, no
one can doubt that the extent of it would
be very great and injurious.
The proposed emancipation would shorten
this war ; perpetuate peace ; insure this in
crease in population, and proportionably
the increase in the wealth of the country.
Wilh this we should pay all that emanci
pation wsuld cost, without ourother debts,
easier than we should pay our other debts
without it If we had allowed our old na
tional debt to run at 6 per cent per an
num, simple interest, from the end of our
revolutionary struggle till to-day without
paying anything on either principal or in
terest, each man of us would owe less on
that debt now than each man owed 'upon
it then, and this because our increase of
men through the whole period has been
greater than six per cent, and has Tun
faster than the interest upon the debt,
Thus time alone relieves a debtor nation, so
long as its population increases faster than
unpaid interest accumulates on its debt
This fact would be no exouse for delaying
the payment of what is justly due ; but it
shows the great importance of time in this
connection, the great advantage of s poli
cy by which we shall not have to pay until
we number 100,000,000, what by a differ
ent policy we would have to pay now,
when the number is 31,000,000. In a word,
it shows that a dollar will te much harder
to pay for the war, than a dollar for eman
cipation on the proposed plan ; and then
the latter will cost no blood no precious
life. It will be a saving of both.
As to the second article, I think it would
be impracticable to return to bondage the
class of persons therein contemplated.
Some of them doubtless, in the property
sense, belong to loyal owners, and hence
provision is mode in this article for com
pensating such.
The third article relates to the future of
the freed people. It does not oblige, but
morely authorizes Congress to aid in colo
nizing such as may consent This ought
not to be regarded as objectionable on the
one hand or on the other, inasmuch as it
eomet to nought unless by mutual consent
of the people to be deported and the Amer
ican voters through their representatives
in Congress. I cannot make it better
known than it already is that I strongly
favor colonization, and yet I wish to say
that there is an objection against the col
ored persons remaining in the country
which is largely imaginary, if not some
times malicious. It is insisted that their
presence wonld injure and displace white
labor and white laborers. If there ever
could be a proper time for mere arguments,
that time surely is not now.
In tinKS like the present men should ut
ter nothing for which they would not
willingly be responsible, through time and
eternity. Is it true, then, that colored
people van displace any more white labor
by being free than remaining slaves? If
they stay in their own places, they jostle
no white laborers. - If they leave their
old places, they leave them open to white
laborers. Logically, there is neither more
nor less of it.
Emancipation, even without deportation,
wonld probably enhanoe the wages of
white labor, and very surely would Rot
reduoe them. Thus, the customary amount
of labor would still have to be performed.
The freed people would surely not do more
than their old proportion of it, and very
probably for a time would do less, leaving
an increased part to white laborers, bring
ing their labor into greater demand, and
consequently enhancing the wages of it
With deportation, even to a limited ex
tent, enhancing wages to white labor it
mathematically certain. Labor is like any
other commodity in the market increase
the demand for it, and you increase the
price of it Reduce the supply of black
labor by colonizing the black laborer out
of the country, and by precisely so much
you will increase the demand for, and
wages for white labor. But it is dreaded
that the freed people will swarm forth and
cover the whole land. Will liberation
make them any more numerous? Equally
distributed among the whites of the whole
country, and there would be but one col
ored to seven whites. Could the one in
any way greatly disturb the seven? There
are many communities now, having more
than one free colored person to seven
whites, and this without any apparent
coasoieusness of evil from it The Dis
trict of Columbia and the States of Mary
land and Delaware are all in this condi
tion. The District has more than one free
colored to six whites, and yet in its fre
quent petitions to Congress, I believe it
has never presented the presence of free
colored persons as one of its grievances.
But why should emancipation south send
free people north ? People of any color
seldom run unless there is something to
mn from. Heretofore colored people have
fled north to some extent from bondage,
and now, perhaps, from both bondage and
destitution, but if gradual emancipation
and deportation be adopted they will have
neither to flee from. Their own masters
will give them wages, at least till new la
borers can be procured, and the freed men
in turn will gladly give their labor for
wages till new homes can be found for
them in congenial climes, and with people
of their own blood and race.
This proposition can be trusted on the
mutual interests involved, and ia any
event cannot the North decide for itself
whether to receive them ? A gain, as pract
ice proves more than theory in any case,
has there been any irruption northward,
because of the abolishment of slavery In
the District of Columbia last spring. What
I have said of the proportion of free color
ed persons to the white in the District of
Columbia is from the census of 1330, hav
ing no reference to persons called contra
bands, nor by those made free by the act
of Congress abolishing slavery here.
The plan consisting of these articles la
recommended, not but that a restoration of
the national authority would be accepted
without its adoption, nor will the war or
proceedings under the proclamation of
September 22d, 1362, be stayed because of
the recommendation of this plan. . Its
timely adoption I doubt not would bring
restoration and thereby stay both. And
notwithstanding this plan, therecommend-
ation that Congress provide by law for
compensating any btate which may
adopt the emancipation before tint
plan shall have been actedjupon, is here
by earnestly renewed. Such would only
be an advance part of the plan, and the
same arguments apply to both. This plan
is recommended as a means not in conclu
sion of, but additional to all other for re-
storingjand preserving the national author
ity throughout the Union. The subject Is
presented exclusively is its economical as
