JUDGES AT ISSUE.
Suit in an Assignment Case Brings Up the
Question of Jurisdiction in Chicago Courts.
Chicago, Dec. 3. There was a very sensa
tional tarn taken in the Lindaner Bros. & Co.
failure matter, shortly after noon to-day, when
Judge Tuley, chief-justice of the Circuit Court,
issued a rule against Judge rrendergast, of the
county court, directing him to appear in the
Circuit Court to-morrow morning, at 10 o'clock, to
show cause why a writ of prohibition should sot
issue against him to atop farther proceeding in
the county court in the Lindaner case. This or
der, which ia said to be the first ono of the kind
ever issued by a court in the State of Illinois,
was cranted upon a petition filed in the
Circuit Court by Mayer E. Benjamin, Selig
znan Lindaner and Aaron Rosenblatt, and the
principal ground for asking the order was that
Judge Prenderjast had usurped, or assumed, a
power to which he was not legally entitled. The
petitioners stated that on Nov. 19 the New York
firm of Tiro. Wallerstein & Co., filed a petition
in the county court, asking that certain acta of
Liudauer Bros. & Co., be declared aa assign
ment, as under the statutes of the State for tho
benefit of all their creditors; that Judge Pren
dergast caused an order to be issued citing the
Lindaner' and others to appear in court for ex
amination as insolvents; that they filed special
appearances, to deny tho jurisdiction of the
county court, and moved t dismiss tbe petition
filed by Tim, Wallentein Sc Co.. and others.
After bearing arguments on the motion Judge
Prendergsst denied them and assumed juris
diction. II la now proceeding to adjndieate
upon the matters and r verments of the petitions,
and Lindaner Brothers Ac Co. fear ho will pro
ceed to render judgrue at to tbe effect that they
have, In fact, made an assignment of all their
state for the benefit ef their creditors, and will
compel and coerce them to appear in court fss
Insolvent debtors, to abide by the orders of tUe
court.
When told of Judge Tuley 'a aetion, Ju'Xge

Tracheotomy and the Removal of the Larjnx
Successfully Performed in New York.
New York, Dec 3. Both the operation of tra
cheotomy and that for the removal of the larynx
hate been performed in this city and on the
same man. The man ia now at the New York
Hospital, where he has been since his larynx
was taken cut extirpated, aa the surgeons
would say over seven months ago, and he is
one of the liveliest patienta in the institution.
His name is Joseph. Liebrich, and he is only a
humble German laborer. Ho was living in ob
scurity in his native town of Strasbourg, when
all Europe, and, ia fact, the civilized world,
was talking about the affliction that had befall
en hia sovereign. He came to America in Octo
ber, 18S7. Early in December, 1837, he began
to experience a difSculty In breathing and
swallowing, which gradually increased in inten
sity nntil it became almost unbearable. He
was sent to the Ward's Island Emi
grant Hospital, here. on Feb. 10. 18S3,
tracheotomy wfl3 successfully performed by Dr.
Allen J. Thomas. After this operation his diffi
culty in. breathing disappeared. The tracheal
tubei gate no inconvenience, and he had a good
appetite and did not lose strength. But the can
cerous growth, entirely filling the larynx, had
been observed by Dr. Thomas at the time of in
serting the tracheal tube, and he advised
Liebrich to enter the New York Hospital under
the care of Dr. T. W. Bull, io order that the
larynx might be removed. Liebrich finally con
sented to this, and on April 20. 1883, two and
one-half months from the time tracheotomy
was performed, the complete extirpation of the
larynx was accomplished. At this time there
were enlarged cervical glands. Tho larynx felt
larger and fuller than normal, but its outline
was not disturbed, though its whole interior was
filled with a growth apparently starting from
tho right sido. Tho epiglottis was not involved,
nor the wall of the pharynx. Tho anesthetic
used was chlorform, aided by two hypodermie
injections of morphine. Then a vertical incis
ion was made in the middle line of the neck,
crossed opposite the level of tbe hyoid bone by
a transverse cut through the skin only. The
prominent thyroid cartilage, or "Adam's apple,"
was first split in two in order to ascertain the
extent of the growth. After opening the in
terior of the larynx the trachea about the tube
was stuffed tightly with small sponees attached
to strings. This device, togother with keeping
the head lightly depended, effectually excluded
all blood from the trachea or wind-pipe. The
two halves of the larynx were removed separ
ately, the separation being made first from the
lower end. There was trifling bleeding, it be
ing necessary to tie only two or three arteries.
For forty-eight hours after the operation, no
food passed Liebrich's lips. He was conscious,
but did not appear to suffer much. The mouth,
pharynx and wound were tightly plugged with
gauze, saturated with iodoform. Thirst was re-
lioved by wetting the lips and tongue, and nour
ishment was injected into the lower bowel,
while tho patient breathed easily through the
tracheal tube, which passed through the packing
of cause into tho trachea. On the third dav
tha packing wa removed, and a smaller amount m
ineerieu, ana Hi xne earns time a nexioie rnuotr
tube was left ia the cscphsjuj, its end project
ing beside the tracheal tube. Through this,
nourishment, beef-broth, milk, and even lager
beer and whisky, wa9 introduced into tbe
stomach. A week later the rubber tube was
withdrawn, and afterward inserted, for a few
moments only, three or four times each day at
the time of dressing the wound. This treatment
was continued for about four weeks,
the patient gradually learning to introduce the
tube himself. All the time the wound in the
neck was gradually growing smaller, and the
quantity of gause required to fill it was daily
less and less. The tracheal tube was worn con
stantly, and will have to bo worn. The fifth
week Liebrich was allowed to swallow some
bread and milk, but the muscles of the throat
were unable to prevent a portion from entering
tho trachea, and a fit of coughing ensued.
Further efforts were deferred for a day or two,
but since then Liebrich bas been able to swal
low with ease. He is also able to speak, but so
far only in a hoarse whisper. He is robust and
happy. Seven months have elapsed sfnee tbe
operation, and there are no signs of any retnrn
of the disease. At least a year must elapse be
fore one can be sure that it will not reappear.
An Anarchist Who Needs Curbing.
Chicago, Dec. 3. "We aro going to teach
socialism anarchy, the papers call It openly if
we can; if not, then auy way," said William
Holmes, a local agitator, at a meeting, last
evening. Several hundred Socialists of the
English-speaking section were present. Holmes
went on to t-ay that the press has made more
Anarchists in this city in six months than he
and Lis co-laborers had succeeded in doing in
five pears. They aro condemning our Sunday
schools, and already threaten to provide laws
for their suppression. "I havo no doubt," he
ea'.d, "this will be done before long. But let
them remember this: The more they follow this
liiso of policy the harder they make it for
tliis movement to have a peaceable solution.
Chicago papers point to the fact that the
churches last week gave soud and turkey to the
poor, and asks what the Anarchists have done.
We have done nothing to degrade the poor by
making them recipients of charity. The man
who receives sonp and tnrkey as charity, is not
oniy lowered in his own estimation, but in those
who bestow the charity as well We give the
man Ideas so be may get sonp and turkey of his
own, and not as things of charity to keep him
from starving. What are we doing for tho poor
We are routing that spirit of discontent that is
bound to bring it? fruitage; above all, ffe are
arousing that feeling of independence character
istic or our forefathers." The speech was warm
ly applauded.
Heavy Damages Awarded.
New Yobk, Dec. a Justice Beach, in tbe
Supreme Court to-day. directed a verdict
of J1S,7J0 for the plamiiil in the suit of W. H.
M. Sanger against Seymour. Baker & Co., stock
brokers. Sanger sued for $50,000 damages for
breach of contract, claiming, that the defend
ants had failed to fulfill an agreement to em
ploy him as their manager at the Albemarle
Hotel for four yours at a salary of $1,000 per
month. Tbe defense was that Sanger threat
ened to prefer charges against the firm cu the
New York Stock Exchange, and that the agree
ment was signed by them under duress.
Investigating tho Calumet Mine Fire.
Isiipeminu, Mich., Dec. 3. Detectives are
working on the incendiary ease of the Calumet
and Uccla copper mine. As a bell rope was cut
and tho water pipe disconnected there is no
doubt that the mine was fired. A short time be
fore the fire the company had adopted the plan
of giving a number to every miner and other
persons entering the mine, and requiring the
surrender of them on reappsarinc a: the sur
face. It is therefore quite certain that the
mine was fired by some employe of the com
pany. The fire is still burning fiercely.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE

A Cumbrous State Document in Which Con

jecting the President's f et Theories.
Ho Teers Gloomily Into the Future and

Ha Stands by His Recommendations of La3t
Year Concerning Tariff and Silver Coinage,
and Wants foe Tension Laws Changed.
Washington, Dec. 3. The second session of
the Fiftieth Congress began at 12 oelock to-day,
and the subjoined message from President
Cleveland was read in both houses:
To the Congress tf the United States:
As you assemble for the discharge of tbe
duties you have assumed as the representatives j
ot a free and generous people, your meeting is
marked by an interesting and impressive inci
dent. "With the expiration of the present ses
sion of the Congress the first century of our
constitutional existence as a nation will be com
pleted. Our survival for one hundred years is
not sufficient to assure that we no longer havo
dangers to fear in the maintenance, with ail its
promised ble?sisgs, of a government founded
on the freedom of the people. The time rather
admonishes us to soberly inquire whether, in
the past, we have always closely kept in tbe
course of eafetyrand whether we have before
us a way plain and clear which leads
to happiness and parpetuity. When
the experiment of our government
was undertaken the chart adopted for our guid
ance was the Constitution. Departure from the
lines there laid down is failure; it is only by a
strict adherence to the direction they indicate,
and by restraint within tbe limitation they fix,
that we can furnish proof to the world of tbe
fitness of the American people for self-government.
The equal and exact justice of which we
boast as tbe underlying principle of our institu
tions should not be confined to the relations of
onr citizens to each other. The government it
self is under bond to the American people that
in tbe exercise of its functions and powers it
will deal with the body of onr citizens in a man
ner scrupulously honest and fair, and absolutely
just. It has agreed that American citizenship
shall be the only credential necessary to justify
the claim of equality before tbe law, and that
no condition in life shall give rise to dissriniina
tion in the treatment of the people by their gov
ernment The citizen of our Republic in its early days
rigidly insisted upon full compliance with the
letter of this bond, and saw stretching out be
fore him a elear field for individual endeavor.
His tribute to the support of his government
was measured by the cost ot its economical
maintenance, and he was s ecure in the enjoy
ment of the remaining recompense of his toil
and contented with it In these days the fru
gality of tho people was stamped upon their
government and was enforced by the free, full
and intelligent suffrage of tho citizen. Com
binations, monopolies nnl aggregations of capi
tal were either avoided or 6ternly regulated and
restrained. The pomp and glitter of govern
ments lees free offered no temotatioa and
presented no delusion to the plain people, who,
side by side in friendly competition,
wrought for the ennoblement and
dignity of man, for tho solution
of the problem of tree government, and for the
achievement of the grand destiny awaiting the
land which God had given them. " ,
A PESSIMISTIC VIEW.
A century has passed. Cur cities are abiding
places of wealth and luxury; cur manufacturos
yield fortunes never dreamed cf by the fathers
of the Republic; our business men are madly
striving in the race for riches, and immense ag
gregations of capital outrun the imagination in
the magnitude of their undertakings. We
view with pride and satisfaction this bright pict
ure of our country's growth and prosperity,
while only a closer scrutiny develops a sombre
shading. Upon more careful inspection we nod
the wealth and luxury of our cities mingled
with poverty, and wretchedness, and unremuner
ative toil. A crowded and constantly increasing
urban population suggests the impoverishment
of rural sections and discontent with
agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not
satisfied with hi3 father's simple and laborious
life, joins the eager chase for easily acquired
wealtn. Wo diecorer tbat the fortunes realized
by our manufacturers are no longer solely the
reward of sturdy industry and enlightened
foresight, but that tbey rrsult from tbe Cis-
crimiuating favor of the government, and aro
largely built upon undue exactions from the
masses of our people. The gulf between the
employers and the employed is constantly
widening and classes are rapidly forming, one
comprising the very rich and powerful, while in
anothsr are found the toiling poor. As we view
tbe achievement of aggregated capital, we dis
cover the existence of trusts, combinations and
monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far
in the rear or is trampled tj death
beneath an iron heel: Corporations,
which should be the carefully re
strained creatures of tbe law and the
servants of the people, are fast becoming
the people's masters. Still, congratulating our
selves upon tbe wealth and prosperity of onr
country, and complacently contemplating every
incident of change inseparable from the condi
tion, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to in
quire, at tho present stage ot our progress, how
tho bond of the government made with the peo
ple has been kept and performed. Instead of
limiting. the tribute drawn from onr citizens to
tha necessities of its economical administration,
the government persists in exacting from the
substance of the people millions whicb, nnap-
?lied and useless, lie dorment in the treasury,
'his flagrant injustice and this breach of faith
and obligation, add to extortion the danger at
tending tbe diversion ot the currency of tbe
country from the legitimate channels of
business. Under 'the same laws by
which these resalts are produced,
the government permits mny millions
more to be added to tho cost of the living of our
people, and to be taken from our consumer,
which unreasonably swell the profits of a small
but powerful minority. The people must still
be t-nxed for the support of the government
undo. the operation of tariff laws, but to an
extent that the mas3 ot onr citizens are
inordinately bnrdened beyond any useful
public purpose and for the benefit of a favored
few. The government, under pretext of
an exercise of Its taxing power, enters
gratuitously into partnership with these favor
ites, to their advantage and to the injury of a
vaet majority of onr people. This is uot equal
ity before the law. The existing situation is in
jurious to the health of our entire body-politic.
It stifles in those for whose benefit it is permit
ted all patriotic love of country, and substitutes
in its place selfish greed and grssping avarice.
Devotion to American citizenship for its own
sake, and for what it should accomplish as a
motire to oar Nation's advancement and
the happiness of all our people is
displaced by the assumption that
th goTernmect. instead of being tbe
embodiment of equality, is but an instrumental
ity tcrongh which especial and individual ad
ventages are to be gained. The arrogance of
this assumption is unconcealed. It appears in
the sordid disregard of all bat personal inter
ests; in the refusal to abate for the benefit of
others one iota of selfish advantage, and in com
binations to perpetuate such advantages through
efforts to control legislation and improperly in
fluence the suffrages of the people. The griev
ances of thoe not included within the circle of
theie beneficiaries, when felly realized, will
surely arouse irritation and discontent. Our
farmers, long-suffering and patient, struggling
in the race of life with the hardest and most un
remitting toil, will not fail to see, in spite of
misrepresentations and misleading fallacies, tbat
they are obliged to accept snch prices for their
prodacts as are now fixed in foreign
markets, where they compete with
the farmers of the world: that their
lands are declining in value, while
their debts increase, and that without com
pensating favor they are forced by the action of
the government to pay for the benefit of others
such enhanced prices "for the thiDps they need
that the scanty returns of their labor fail to
furnish their support or leave no margin for
accumulation. Our workingmen, enfranchised
from all delusions and no longer frightened by
the cry tbat their wages are endangered by &
just revision or our tariff laws, will
reasonably demand, through such revision,
steadier employment, cheaper means of living
? r homPS-'ffeed'oio for themselves and their
ehiMren from the doom of perpetual servitudo
and an open door to their advancement beyond
the limit of a laboring class. Others of our
citizens whose comforts and expenditures are
measnred by moderate salaries and fixed in
comes, will insist upon the fairness and justice of
cheapening the cost of necessaries for themselves
and their families.
A VISION OP COMMUNION.
When to the selfishness cf the beneficiaries
cf unjust discrimination under our laws there
shall be added the discontent of those who suf
fer from such discrimination, we will realize the
fact that the beneficient purposes of our govern
ment, dependent upon the patriotism and con
tentment of our people, are endangered. Com
tnunisnysa hateful thing and a menace to
peace and organized government. But thecom
mnnism of combined wealth and capital, the
outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfish
cess, which insidiously undermines the justice
and integrity of free institutions, is not less dan
gerous than tbe communism of oppressed pov
erty and toil, which, exasperated by injustice
and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the
citadel of rule. He mocks tbe people who pro
pokos that the government shall protect the
rich, and tbat tbey, in turn, will eare
for the laboring poor. Any intermediary
between tbe people and their government, or
the least delegation of the care and protection
the government owes to the humblest citizen in
the land, makes the boast of free institutions a
glittering delusion and the pretended boon of
American citizenship n shameless imposition.
A just and sensible revision of onr tariff laws
should bo made for the relief of those of our
countrymen who suffer under present condi
tions. Such a revisiou should receive the sup
port of all who love that justice and equality
due to American citizenship; of all who realize
that in this justice and equality our government
finds its strength and its power to protect the
citizsn and his property; of all who believe tbat
the contented competence and comfort of the
many accord better with the spirit of our insti
tutions than colossal fortunes, unfairly gathered,
in the hands of a few; of ail who appreciate
that the forbearanee and fraternity among our
people, which recognize the value of every
American interest, are the surest guaranty of
our national progress, and of ail who desire to
see the products of American skill and ingenui
ty in overy market of the world, with a result
ing restoration of American commerce.
The necessity of tbe reduction of our revenue
is so apparent as to be generally conceded. But
the means by which this end shall be eccom
pllshed and the sum of direct benefit which
shall result to our citizens present a controversy
of the utmost importance. There should be no
scheme accepted as satisfactory by which the
burdens of. the people are only appsrently re
moved. Extravagant appropriations of publio
money, with all their demoralizing conse
quences, should cot be tolerated, either as a
means of relieving the treasury of its present
surplus or as furnishing pretexts for resisting a
proper reduction in tariff rates. Existing evils
and injustice should be honestly recognized,
boldly met and effectively remedied. There
should be co cessation of the struggle until a
plan is perfected which is fair and conservative
toward existing industries, but which will re
duce the cost to consumers of the necessaries
of life, while it provides for onr manufacturers
the advantage of freer raw materials and
permits no injury to the interests of
American labor. The cause for which the battle
is wared is comprised within lines clearly and
distinctly defined. It should never be compro
mised. It is the people's cause.
It cannot be denied that the selfish and pri-
vato interests which Are so persistently heard
when efforts are made to deal In a just and
comprehensive manner with our tariff laws, r.re
related to, if they are not responsible for, the
sentiment largely prevailing among the people
that the general government is tbe fountain of
individual and private aid; that it may be ex
pected to relieve with paternal care the distress
of citizens and communities, and that from the
fullness of its treasury it should, upon the
slightest possible pretext of promoting the gen
eral good, apply publio funds to the benefit of
localities and individuals; nor can is be denied
that there is a growing assumption that, as
against the government and in favor of private
claims and interests, the usual rules and limi
tation of bnsiness principles and just dealing
,;bo"ld bd waived. These ideas have been, un-
bapuily, moch eneouragsd by legislative ac
quiescence. Relief from contracts made with
the government is too easily accorded in favor
of tbe citizen. The failure to support claims
acainst the government by proof is often sup
plied by no better consideration than the wcslth
of tho government and thn poverty of the claim
ant; gratuities in the form of pensions are
granted upon no other real ground than the
needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons
less valid; and large sums are expended foa pub
lic buildings and other improvements upon repre
sentations scarcely claimed to be related to pub
lio needs and necessities. Tbe extent to which
the consideration of such matters subordinates
and postpones action upon subjects of great pub
lie importance, but involving no special private
or partisan interest, should arrest attention and
lead to reformation.
HIS ADVICE HAS BEEN NEGLECTED.
A few of the numerous illustrations of this
condition raay ba stated. Ths crowded
condition of the calendar of the Supreme Court,
and tho delay to suitors and denial of
justice resulting therefrom hae been strongly
urged upon the attention ot the Congress with a
plan for the relief of the situation approved by
those well able to judge of its merits. While
this subject remains without effective considera
tion many laws have been passed providing for
the holding of terms of inferior courts at places
to suit the convenience of localities, or to lay the
foundation of an application for the erection of
a new public building. Repeated recommenda
tions have been submitted for the amendment
and chenge of the laws relating to our publio
lands, so that their spoliation and diversion to
other uses thau as homes for honest settlers
might be prevented. While a measure to meet
this conceded necessity of reform remains await
ing the action of the Congress, many claims to
the public lands and applications for their dona
tion in favor of States and individuals have
been allowed. A plan in dd of
Indian management, recommended by those
well informed as containing valuable features
in furtherance of the solution ot the Indian
problem, has thus far failed of lecislative sanc
tion, while grants of doubtful expediency to
railroad corporations, permitting them to pasa
through Indian reservations have greatly multi
plied. The propriety and necessity of the erec
tion of one or more prisons for tbe confinement
of United States convicts and a postoffice build
ing in tho national capital are not disputed.
But these needs yet remain unanswered while
scores of public buildings have been erected
where their necessity for public purposes is not
apparent, A revision of onr pension laws could
easily be made which would rest upon just prin
ciples and provide for every worthy applicant,
but while our general pension laws remain con
fused and imperfet, hundreds of our private pen
sion laws are annually passed which are the
sources of unjust discrimination and popular
demoralization. Appropriation bill3 for the sup
port of the government are defaced by items
ana provisions to meet privete ends,
and it is freely asserted by re.pon-
sioie and experienced parties that a
bill appropriating money for pnbUo
internal improvement would fail to meet with
favor unless it contained more for local and pri
vate advantage than for public benefit. These
statements can be much emphasized by an ascer
taiuinent of tbe proportion of federal legislation,
which either bears upon its face its private char
acter or which, upon examination, develops such
a motive power. And yet the people wait and
expect irora their chosen representatives such
patriotic aetion as will advance the welfare of
the entire country, and this expectation can only
oe answered by the performsnce of public duty
with unselfish purpose. Our mission among the
nations of tbe earth and our success iu accom
plishing the work Ood has given the American
people to do. require of those Intrusted with the
making and execution of our laws perfect devo
tion, above all other things, to the public good.
This devotion will lead us to strongly resist all
impatience yf constitutional limitations of federal
power and to persistently check tbe increasing
tendency to extend the scope of federal legisla
tion into the domsin ot State and local jurisdic
tion, upon the plea of subserving the publio
welfare. The preservation of the partitions be
tween proper subjects of federal and local care
and regnlation is of snch importance under tbe
Constitution, which is ths law of our very ex
istenee. that co consideration of expediency or
sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubt
ful ground. We have undertaken to discover
and proclaim the richest blessings of a free gov
ernment, with the Constitution as our guide.
Let us follow the way it points out. It will cot
.mislead us; and surely co one who hss taken
upon himself tbe solemn obligation to support
and preserve the Constitution can find justifica
tion or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that
he wandered and disobeyed in search of a better
way to reaeh the public welfare than the Con
stitution oner!.
What has been said is deemed cot inappropri
ate at a time when, from a century's height, we
view the way already trod by the American
people, and attempt to discover their future
path. The seventh Tresident of the United
States the soldier and statesman, and at all
times the firm and brave friend of the poople-
in vindication of his course as the protector of
popular rights, and the cnampion of true Amer
ican citizenship, declared:
The ambition which leads me on is an anxious de
sire and a fixed determination to restore to the reople.
unimpaired, the sacred trust they have confided to
my charge; to heal the wounds of the Constitution,
and to preserve it from further violation; to persuade
mr countrymen, so far as I may. that it is not in a splen
did government supported by powerful monopolies end
aristocratical establishments, that they will find hap
piness, or their Llertie3 protection, but in a plain
system, void of pnr protecting all, and granting
favors to none dispensing its blessings, like the dew
of heaven, unseen and unfelt, save in the freshness
and beautv thev contribute to produce. It is such a
government that the cenius of our ieople requires
such a one oniy under which our States may remain,
for ajes to come, united, prosperous and free.
Relations with Foreign Governments.
In pursuance of a constitutional provision re
quiring the President, from time to time, to
give the Congress information of the state of
the Union, I have the satisfaction to announce
that the close of tbe year finds the United
States io the enjoyment of domestic tranquility
and at peace with all the nations. Since my
last annual message our foreign relations have
been strengthened and improved by perform
ance of international good offices and by new
and renewed treaties of amity, commerce, and
reciprocal extradition of criminals. Those in
ternational questions which still await settle
ment are all reasonably within the domain of
amicable negotiation, and there is co existing
subject of dispute between the United States
and any foriegn power that is not susceptible of
satisfactory adjustment by frank diplomatic
treatment. The questions between Or eat
Britain and the United States, relating to the
rights of American fisherman under treaty and
international comity, in the territorial waters of
Canada and Newfoundland, I regret to say, aro
not yet satisfactorily adjusted. These matters
were folly treated in my message to the Senate
of Feb. E0, 1SSS, together with which a conven
tion concluded, under my authority, with her
Majesty's government, on the 15th of February
last, for the removal of all causes of misunder
standing, was submitted by me for the approval
of tho Senate. This treaty having been rejected
by the Senate, I transmitted a message to the
Congress on the 23d of August lsst, reviewing
the transactions aud submitting for considera
tion certain recommendations for legislation
concerning the important questions involved.
Afterwards, on the 12th of September, in re
sponse to a resolution of the Senate, I again
communicated fully all the information in my
possession as to the aetion of tbe government
of Canada affecting the commercial relations
between tbe Dominion and the United States,
including the treatment of American fishing
vessels In the ports and waters of British Amer
ica. The communications nave all been pub
lished, aud therefore opened to the knowledge
of both houses of Congress, although two were
addressed to tbe Senate alone. Comment upon or
repetition of their csntent3 would be superfluous,
and I am not aware that anything has since oc
curred which should be added to the facts there
in stated. Therefore I merely repeat, as appli
cable to the present time, the statement which
will be found in my message to the benate ot
September 12th last:
That since Starch 3. 1897. no ease bas been re
ported to the Department of State wherein complaint
has been made of unfriendly or unlawful treatment
of American fiahingj vessels on the part of the Can
adian authorities, in winch reparation was not
promptly and satisfactorilv obtained by the United
States consul-general at llalifax.
Having essayed, in the discharge of my duty,
to procure by negotiation the settlement of a
long-standing cause of dispute and to remove a
constant menace . to the good relations cf tho
two countries, and continuing to be of the opin
ion that the treaty of February last, whieh
failed to receive tbe approval ot the Senate, did
supply "a satisfactory, practical and final ad
justment upon a basis honorable and just to
. i . . a 1 t. J - 3 - Li
ootn parties to xue uimcuu anu vexeu uuesuuu
to which it related," andVbaving subsequently
and unavailing recommeeded other legislation
to Congress which I hoped would suffice.
To meet tbe exigency created by the
rejection of the treaty, I now again invoke be
earnest and immediate attontion of the Con
gress to the condition of this important ques-.
tion, as it now stands before them and the coun
try, and for the settlement of which X am deep
ly solicitous.
THE SACK VI LLC INCIDENT.
Near the close of the month of October, last,
occurrences of a deeply regrettable nature were
brought to my knowledge, which made it my
painful but imperative duty to obtain, with as
little delay as possible, a new personal channel
of diplomatie intercourse in this country with
the government of Great Britain. The corre
spondence in relation to this incident will, in
due course, be laid before you, and will disclose
the unpardonable conduct of tbe official referred
to in his interference, by advice and counsel,
with the suffrages of American citizens in the
very crisis of the presidential election then near
at hand, and also in his subsequent public dec-
laratious to justify his action, superadding im
pugnment of the executive and Senate of the
United States, in connection with
important questions now pending in
controversy between the two governments.
Tbe offense thus committed was most grave, in
volving dis&Rtroas possibilities to the good rela
tions of the United States and Great Dritain,
constituting a gross breach of diplomatic privi
lezo, and an invasion of the purely domestic
affairs and essentisl sovereignty of the govern
ment to which the envoy was accredited. Hav
ing first fulfilled the just demands of interna
tional comity by affording full opportunity for
her Majesty's government to act in relief of tbe
situation, I considered prolongation of discus
sion to be unwarranted, and thereupon declined
to further recognize the diplomatie character of
ths person whose continuance in such fenction
would destroy that mutual confidence which is
essential to the good understanding of the two
goveiaraents, And was inconsistent with the
welfare and self-respect of the government of
the United States. The usual interchange of
communication has since continued through
her .Majesty legation in this citv.
My endeavors to establish, by international
co-operation, measures for the" prevention of
the extermination of fur-seals in Behring sea
have not been relaxed, and I have hopes of be
ing enabled shortly to submit an effective and
satisfactory conventional project with tbe mari
time powers for the approval of the Senate.
The coastal boundary between our Alaskan
possessions and British Columbia, I regret to
say, has not received tbe attention demanded
by its importance, and which, on several occa
sions heretofore. I hav had the honor to recom
mend to the Congress. The admitted im
practicability, if not impossib.dty, of making
an accurate and precise survey and demarka
tion of tbe boundary line, as it is recited in the
treaty with Russia under which Alaska was
ceded to the United States, renders it absolute
ly requisite, for tbe prevention of international
jurisdictional complications, that adequate ap
propriation for a reconooissance and survey to
obtain proper knowledge of the locality and the
geographical features of the boundary should
be authorized by Congress with as little delay
as possible. Knowledge to be only thus ob
tained is an essential prerequisite for negotia
tion for ascertaining a common boundary, or as
preliminary to any other mode of settlement
It is mucn to be desired that some agreement
should be reached with her Majesty's govern
ment by whieh the damage to life and property
ou the great lakes may be alleviated by remov
ing or - humanely regulating tbe obstacles to re
ciprocal assistance to wrecked or stranded ves
sels. The act of June 19, 1S78, which offers to
Canadian vessels free aceess to our inland waters
in aid of wrecked or disabled vessels, bas not
yet become effective through concurrent action
by Canada.
The due protection of our citizens of French
origin or descent, from claim of military service
in the event of their returning or visiting
France, has called forth correspondence which
was laid before you at the last session. In tbe
abfcenee of conventional agreement as to natu
ralization, which is greatly to be desired, this
government sees no occasion to recede from the
sound position it has maintained not only with
regard to France but as to all countries with
whieh tbe United States have cot concluded
special treaties.
Twice within the last year has the imperial
household of Germany been visited by deatn.
and I have hastened to express tbe sorrow of
this people and their appreciation of the lofty
character of the late Emperor Yilllam, and
their eympathy with the heroism and suffering
of his son. the late Emperor Frederick.
I renew my recommendation of two years ago
for tbe passage of a bill for the refunding to
to certain German steamship lines ot the inter
est upon tonnage dues illegally exaeted.
On tbe 12th of April last I laid before the
IIou?e of IteDresentatives fell information re
specting our interests in Samoa, and in tbe sub
sequent correspondence on tbe same Subject,
which will be laid oefore you iu doe eourse. the
history of events in those islands will bo found.
In a message accompanying my approval, on
the 1st day of October last, of a bill for the ex
clusion of Chinese laborers, I laid before Con
gress full information: and ail correspondence
touching the negotiation of the treaty with
China, concluded at this capital on the
12ih day of Msrch, 1SSS, and whieb,
having been confirmed by the Senate with
certain amendments, was rejected by tbe Chi
nese government. This message contained
recommendation that a sum of money be appro
priated as compensation to Chinese subjects
who have suffered injuries at the hands of law
less men within our jurisdiction. ' Such appro
priation having been duly made, the fund awaits
reception by the Chinese government It ii
sincerely hoped that by tbe cessation of the in
flux of this class of Chinese subjects, in accord
ance with tbe expressed wish of both govern
ments, a cause cf unkind feeling bas been per
manently removed.
On the 9th of August, 1S87. notification was
given by tbe Japanese minister, at this capital,
of the adjournment of the conference for the re
vision of tbe treaties of Japan with foreign
powers, owing to objection of bis government to
the provision in the draft of the jurisdictional
convention whieh required the submission of tbe
criminal code of the empire to the powers in ad
vance of its becoming operative. This notifica
tion was. however, accompanied wlVi an aseur
ance of Japsn's intention to continue the work
of revision. Notwithstanding this temporary
interruption of negotiations, it is hoped that im
provement may soon be secured in the jurisdic
tional iystem as respects foreigners in Japan,
and relief afforded to that country from the
present undue and oppressive foreign control
in matters of commerce. I earnestly recommend
tbat relief be provided for the injuriea accident
ally caused to Japanese subjects in the island of
Skisima by the target practice of ono of our
vessels.
A diplomatie mission from Corea has been re
ceived, and the formal intercourse between the
two countries contemplated by the treaty of
1SS2, is now established. Lesiglative provision
is hereby recommended to organize and equip
consular courts in Cores.
Persia has established diplomatic representa
tion at this capital, and has evinced very great
interest in the enterprise aud achievements of
our citizens. I am therefore hopeful tbat bene
ficial commercial relations between the two
countries may bo brought about.
THE TROUBLES IX 1IAVTX.
I announce with sincere regret that Hayti hat
again become the theatre of insurrection, dis
order and bloodshed. The titular government
of President Saloman has besn forcibly over
thrown and he driven out of tbe country to
France, where he bas since died. Tbe tenure of
power has been so unstable amid ths war of
factions that has endued since tbe expulsion of
President Saloman. tbat no government con
stituted by the will of the Hsytian people Las
been recognized as administering responsibly
tbe affairs of the country. Onr representative
has been instructed to abstain from interference
between the warring factions, and a vescel of
our navy has been sent to liaytisn waters to
sustain our minister, and for the protection of
the persons and property of American citizens.
Due precautions have been taken to enforce our
neutrality laws and prevent our territory from
becoming tha base of military supplies for either
of the warring factions. Under color of a block
ade, of which co reasonable notice had
been given, and which does cot ap
pear to have been efficiently maintained,
a seizure of vessels under the American flag
has been reported, and, in consequence, meas
ures to prevent and redress any molestation of
our innocent merchantmen cave been adopted.
Proclamation was duly made on the 9th day
of November. 1SS7, of the conventional exten
sions of the treaty of June 3, 1875, with Hawaii.
under which relations of special and beneficient
intercourse have been created. In tbe vast
field of oriental commerce cow unfolded from
our Pacific borders no feature presents stronger
recommendations for congressional action than
the establishment ot communication by sub
marine telegraph with Honolulu. The geograph
ical position of the Hawaiian group in relation
to our Pacific States creates a natural inter
dependency and mutuality of interest which our
present treaties were intended to foster, and
which make close communication & logical ana
commercial necessity.
The wisdom of concluding a treaty of commer
cial reciprocity with Mexico bas been heretofore
stated in my messages to Congress, and tbe
lapse of time and growth of commerce with
that close neighbor and sister republic confirm
the judgment so expressed. The precise relo
cation of our boundary line is needful, and an
adequate appropriation is now recommeeded.
It is with sincere satisfaction that I am enabled
to advert to the spirit of good neighborhood and
friendly co-operation aud conciliation tbat has
marked tbe correspondence and action of tbe
Mexican authorities in their share of tbe task
of maintaining law and order about the line of
our common boundary.
The long-pending boundary dispute between
Costa Rica and N'icaraeua was referred to my
arbitration, and by an award, made on the 22d
of March last, tbe question bas been finally
settled to the expressed satisfaction of both of
the parties in interest.
The empire of Brazil, in abolishing the last
veitace of slavery among Christian cations,
called forth the earnest congratulations of thil
government in expression of tno cordial sym
pathies of onr people.
Tbe claims of nearly all other countries
aeainst Chili, growing out of her lite wsr with
Boliva and Peru, have been disposed ot either
by arbitration or by a lumpsettlement. Similat
claims of our citizens will continue to be nrged
upon the Chilian government, and it ia hoped
will not be subject to further delays.
A comprehensive treaty of emity and com
mere with Peru was proclaimed on Nov. 7,
last, and it is expected tbat under its operation,
mutual prosperity and good understanding will
be promoted.
In pursuance of the policy of arbitration, a
treaty to settle the claim of Santos, an Arneri
can citizen, against Ecuador, has been conclud
ed under my authority and will be duly submit
ted for the approval of the Senate.
Like disposition of tbe claim of Carlos Butter
field against Denmark, and of Vaubokelen
against Hayti will probably be made, aud I trust
tbe principle of such settlements may be ex
ended in practtice under the approval of the
Senate.
Through unforseefl causes, foreign to the will
of both governments, tbe ratification ot the con
vention of Dec. 5, 18S5, with Venezula, for the
rehearing of claims of citizens of the United
States under the treaty of lcCG, failed to ex
change within tho term provided, and a supple
mentary convention further extending tbe time
for exchange of ratification and explanatory cf
an arnbigous provision of the prior convention,
now awaits tbe advice and content of the Senate.'
Although this matter, in tho stage referred to,
concerns only the concurrent treaty-making
power of one branch of Congress, 1 advert to it in
viewof the interest repeatedly and conspicuouily
shown by yoo, in your legislative capacity, in
favor of a speedy aud equitable adjust
ment of tbe questions growing out
of the discredited judgments of the
previous mixed commission of Caraccas. With,
everv desire to do justice to the representations
of Venezuela in this regard, the time seems to
have come to end this matter, and I trust tho
prompt confirmation by both psrties of the sup
plementary action referred to, will avert the
need ot legislative or other action to prevent the
longer withholding of such rights of actual
claimants as may be shown to exist.
An authorized by the Congress, preliminary
steps have been takn for the assemblage, at
this capitol, doricg the coming year, of the rep
resentatives of South and ' Central American
states, together with those of Mexico, Iliytl
and San Domingo, to discuss sundry, important,
monetary and commercial topics, exsepting, in
those cases where, from reasons of contiguity
of territory and existence of a border line in
capable of being guarded, reciprocal commercial
treaties may be found inexpedient. It is be
lieved that commercial policies inducing freer
mutual exchange of proauets can Le most ad
vantageously arranged by independent, but co
operative legislation. In the mode lsst men
tioned, the control of our taxation for revenue
will be always retained in our own hands unre
stricted by conventional agreements with other
governments.
In conformity, also, with ccogres sional author
ity, the msritine powers have been invited to
confer in Washington, in April next, upon tbe
practicability of devising uniform rules and
measures for the greater security of life and
property at sea. A disposition to accept, on the
part ot a cumber of the powers, has already
been manifested, aud if the co-operation of the
cations chiefly interested shall be secured, im
portant results may be confidently anticipated.
Tne act of Jane 2G, 18S4, and the acts amend
atory thereof, in relation to tonnsge duties,
have given rise to extended correspondence with
foreign nations with whom we have existing
treaties of navigation and commerce, and have
caused wid and regretable divergence of opin
ion in relation to tbe imposition of the duties re
ferred to. The questions era important, and I
shall make them the subject ot a special end
more detailed communication at the present ses
sion. THE NATURALIZATION LAWS.
With the rapid increase of immigration to onr
shoies, and the facilities of modern travel,
abuses of the generous privileges afforded by
our naturalization laws call for their careful
revision. The easy, unguarded manner in which
