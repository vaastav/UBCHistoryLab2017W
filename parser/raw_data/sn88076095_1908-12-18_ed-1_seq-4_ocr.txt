LESS TALK, MORE WORK.
Whatever may be the feelings
of the members of Congress con
cerning the strictures passed up
on their action in curtailing the
use of Secret Service men, the
fact remains that the people's
representatives are met for the
business of the nation. The time
of session is short, and it is nec
essary for the representatives of
the people to give their attention
to legislation, rather than to dis
cussions of the respective rights
and functions of their branch of
the government and the execu
tive.
Much valuable time may be
wasted in deepening an unfortu
uate breach. The first duty of
the members of Congress is to
the country, and not to them
selves. The time-honored divis
ions of the government will re
main as the Constitution pre
scribed long after Mr. Roosevelt
liaa relinquished the reins, and
the activities of Congress will
not s u ff er serious detriment
through his opinions or measures.
The necessity of the present is
not work for vindication of dig
nity, but work to assure the peo
ple that their representatives are
superior to the aspersion, too
often made, that Congress spends
too much time in talk. This has
become the bane of the age.
Talk, talk, talk. Congress should
turn itself to work—and keep at
it
The market reports a break in
eggs. But, then, it ought not, in
the natural course of things, be
hard to. break an egg corner.
A Gift for the Family
Get a Packard for your .home and you give to all again
and again. You give pleasure' to the whole family circle
every day, year after year, every time its wonderful tone is
brought forth.
Come hear this.marvelous instrument and you will realize
why it has proven itself the piano for the home. You will
find its sweetness remarkable, its touch a delight. You can
depend absolutely on its wear.
Know its superiorities and, like thousands of owners, you
will consider the Packard the piano of pianos, the gift of gifts.
E. W. EATON
Bowbells, N. D.
The attendance -at the tuber
culosis exhibit in New, York
shows the great general interest
in the movement. So much of
co-operation is needed on the
part of the general public that
this evidence of intelligent inter
est in the big fight against one
of the greatest scourges of hu
manity is highly encouraging.
When the mass of the people are
eager to learn what to do in daily
life to help stamp out the White
Plague they will put in practice
the preventive means, the know
ledge of which these public ex
hibits will do much to spread.
One of the political prophets
says that war is inevitable be
tween Germany and England.
No friend of humanity wants a
war between these two powers
to come, and it is consolation to
the peaceful-minded that the
language is not always equal to
emergencies, so that "impossible"
things sometimes do happen and
"inevitable" catastrophies are
sometimes averted.
The "boss" mayor of San Fran
cisco has been found guilty of
bribery, and the ring of grafters
who dominated that city is being
broken up, with the chief graft
ers either in prison or facing
terms. Among the other mills
which have resumed active op
eration are evidently the mills of
the gods, which, according to
a i i o n w i e e y i n
slowly, grind exceedingly small.''
Carrie Nation is now in Dublin,
pursuing her work of reform.
She is in the right place for a
fight, and while the sons of the
Emerald Isle are too gallant to
be rough with a lady, she will
probably find her visit quite as
lively as she could desire.
According to a press dispatch
a woman of sixty-five in a trial
in St. Louis swore on the witness
stand that she had never told a
lie in her life. At last the im
mortal George Washington as a
miracle of veracity is outclassed.
A French admiral has been re
lieved of his command for talking
too much. The general revolu
tionary tendencies of the times
seem to be working havoc with
the talking habit in high places.
Mr. Bryan may be nominated
a university president. With
William Jennings Bryan e i
nomination habit seems hard to
overcome.
The Powder Truar^Vidently
had the other trusts beaten to a
frazzle, for, according to facts
just developed, it had cornered
the earth, and was only stopped
in its operations by the uncer
tainty yet existing as to whether
the rest of the solar system is
inhabited.
The "hazardous" oil business,
as Mr. Rockefeller is pteased to
term it, in six years made a profit
of $24,000,000 on a capital of
$1,000,000. Even a man conserv
ative to the point of timidity
might be induced to take risk
like that.
Congress fiercely resents the
idea advanced in the President's
message that it might need
watching. And yet there have
been times when the country
dimly suspected it, even though
everybody was too polite to say
so.
John D. Rockefeller is reported
as having given a New Bruns
wick waiter a five-cept tip the
other day. It was long ago pre
dicted that John would sooner or
later develop spendthrift pro
clivities.
The funerals of the late Em
peror and Dowager Empress of
China will cost that nation over
$4,000,000. But, still, there are
many who think that even at
that figure the occasion is worth
the price.
A fifty million dollar spinster
has just died in New York in her
nineties. There must be some
heartaches over this news in
noble European families who
missed such a prize.
Boni says Helie is a scoundrel,
and Helie says Boni is a dishonest
fool. From which it would ap
pear to the ordinary human that
each seems to bear the other
great Anna-mosity.
And now charges are matie in
Chicago of a funeral trust. This
is running the thing Into the
ground and an exchange remarks
that the charge forms a grave is
sue.
Pat Crowe is now an evangel-,
ist, but it's a cinch, however,
that he'll never convert any of
the Cudahy family.
