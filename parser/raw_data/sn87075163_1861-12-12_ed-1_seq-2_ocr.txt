Agriculture, confessedly the largest
interest in tho nation, has uot a de
partment or a bureau, but only a
clerkship assigned to it in the Gov
ernment. Whilo it to fortunate that
this great interest is so independent
io its nature as not to have demanded
and extorted more from tho Govern
ment, I respectfully B6k Congress to
consider whether something more can
not be given voluntarily, with gener
al advactago. Annual reports, ex
hibiting the condition of our agricul
ture, commerce aud manufactures,
would present a fund ot information i
of great practical value to the country.
While I make vo suggestion as to de
tails, I venturo tho opinion that an
agricultural and statistical burean
wight pofitably be organized.
The executions of the laws for the
eappression of the African slave trade
has Leon connnea to tno uepunmuui
of the Interior. It is a subject of con
gratulation that the efforts which Lavo
boon made for the suppression of this
inhuman traffic have recently been
attended with unusual success. Fivo
vessels, being fitted out for the slave
trade, have boon seized and condemn
ed. Two masters, engaged in the
trale.and one person equipping tho
vessel as a slaver, have been convict
ed and subjected to tho penalty of
lino and imprisonment, and one cap
tain, taking up a cargo of Africans on
board his vessel, has been convicted
of tho highest grade of offenso under
our laws, tho' punishment of which is
death. " ,
. Tho Territories of Colorado, and
Dacotah, and Nevada, creatod by the
last Congress, have been organized,
and civil administration has been in
augurated therein, under auspices es
pecially gratifying when it is consid
ered that tho leaven ot treason was
found existing in somo of these new
countries when tho Federal officers ar
rived there. Tbo abundant material

I recommend to tho favorable con
sideration of Congress tho interests of
tho District of "Columbia. The in
surrection has been thecauso of much
suffering and sacrifice to tho inhabit
ants; and as they have no representa
tive io Congress, that body should not
overlook their just claims upon the
Government.
At your late session, a joint reso
lution was adopted authorizing tho
President to take measures for facili
tating a proper representation of the
. industrial interests of the United
States, at the Exhibition of tho In
dustry of all Nations, to bo holden at
London, in the year 18C2. I regret
to have been unablo to give personal
attention to this subject a subject at
Once so interesting in itself and as ex
tensively and intricately connected
with the mutorial prosperity of tho
world. Through the Secretary of
State and Interior, a plan or system
lias been devised aud partly matured,
which will bo laid before you.
Under, and by virtuo of the act of
Congress, entitled "An act to conns
cate property used for insurrectionary
fmrposes," approved August 6, 1861,
egal claims of certain persons to the
labor and service of certain other per
sons havo become forfeited, and num
bers of the latter thus liberated are
already dependent on the United
States, and must be provided for in
some way besides this. It is not im
possible that some ol tho States will
Eass similar enactments for their own
enefit respectively, and by tho oper
ation of which persons of the same
class will be thrown upon them lor
disposal. In such case I recommend
that Congress provide for accepting
such persons from Biich States accord
ing to some modeot valuation iu lien
pro tanto of direct taxes, or upon
. some other plan to be agreed on with
such States respectively, that such
persons, on such acceptance by the
Government, bo at once deemed free;
and that in any event 6teps be taken
for colonizing, with classes, or the one
first mentioned, if the other shall' not
be brought into expedience, in some
place or places in a climate congenial
with them. It might be well to con
aider, too. whether the tree colored
people already iu tbo United States
could not, so lar as individuals mxy
desire, be included in such coloniza
tion. To carry out the plan of colo
nisation may involve the acquiring of
territory, and also the appropriation
of money beycud that to be expended
. I t - 1 ? ? a, f TTam
iu tue territorial ucquibiuun. uw
ids practiced the acquisition of terri-
toty for nearly fifty years, tho Ques
tion of ComtitutiDiial power to do so
ia no loneer an onen one with ns. The
power was first questioned by Mr
Jeffurgon, who, however, in the pur
chase of Louisiana, vielded his Ecru
plea ou the plea of great expediency.
If it be said that the only legiti
mate object of acquiring territory is
to fnrDisb homes lor white men, this
measure effects that object, for the
emigration of colored men leaves ad
ditional room for whito men remain
ing or coming here. Mr. Jefferson,
however, placed tho importance of
purchasing Louisiana more ou politi
cal aud commercial grounds, than on
nrovir m7 room for uoDiilatlon. Un
this whoTo proposition, including the
appropriation of money with tho ac
quisitiou of territory, docs not the
expediency amount to absolute neces
sity that without which tlio Govern
ment cannot be perpetuated?
In considering the policy to be
A.lm.taJ for sunurtssini' the insurrec
tion I havo been anxious and careful
that the inevitable conflict tor this
purpose shall not degenerate into a
violent and remorseless revolutionary
striigglo. I havo, therefore, in every
case, thought it proper to keep tho
integrity of the Union prominent aa
the primary object ot tue contest ou
our part, leaving all questions which
are not of vital military importance
to tho inoro doliberato action of the
Legislature.
In the exercise of ray best discre
tion I havo adhered to the blockade
of tho ports held by the insurgents,
instead of putting in force by procla
mation tho law of Congress ouacted
at the late session for closing those
ports; also, obeying tho dictates of
nrudence. as well as the obligations
of law, instead if transcending, I
havo adhered to the act of Couess
to confiscate property used for -insurrectionary
purposes. If a new. law
upon tue same subject snail De pro
posed, its propriety will do U'liy con
sidered. The Union must bo preserved
and hence all dispensable means must
bo employed.
We should not bo in Haste to de
termine what radical and extremo
measures which may reach tho. loyal
au weU as the disloyal are indispensa
ble.
The inaugural address at the begin
ning of the Administration, and the
message to Congress at the late spec
ial session, wera both mainly devoted
to tho domestic controversy out 01
which the insurrection and conse
quent war have sprung. Nothing now
occurs to add or subtract to or from
the principles or goueral purposes
stated aud expressed in those docu
ments.
The last ray of hope for preserving
the Union peaceably expired at the
assault upon Jbort oumter, and a gen
cral review of what has occurred since
mav not be unprofitable. What was
painfully uncertain thon is much bet
ter defined and more distinct now
and tho progress of events is plainly
in the right direction
Tho lusargonts confidently claimed
a strong support trom JNortu ot Ma
son and Dixon's line, and the friends
of the Union wore not free from ap
prehension ou this point. This, Low
ever, was soon settled definitely and
on the right side. South of the line
noble little Delaware led off right
from the first. Maryland was made
to seem against the Union. Our sol
diers were assaulted, bridges were
burned, and railroads torn up within
her limits, and we were many days at
one time without the ability to bring
a single regiment over her soil to the
(Japittil. JNow her bridges and ral-
roads are repaired and opened to the
Government, alio already gives Bev
cu regiments to the cause of the Union
and none to tue enemy, and her pco
pie, at a regular election, have sus
tained the Union by a large majority,
and a larger aggregate vote than they
ever before gave to any candidate or
any question.
Kentucky, too, for some time in
doubt, is now decidedly, and, I think,
uncuangeably ranged on the side of
the Dniou. Missouri is comparative
ly quiet, and, I believe, can not again
be overrun by tba insurgents. These
threo States, of Maryland, Kentucky
and Missouri, neither of which prom
ised a single soldier at first, have now
an aggregate of not less than 40,000
in the field lor the Union, while ol
their citizens, not more than a third
in number are among the insurgents,
and they ot doubtful whereabout and
existence.
After a Bomewhat bloody struggle
of months, winter closes ou the Union
people ot Western Virginia, leaving
them masters of their own country.
An insurgent force ot aboat 1,500, lor
months dominating the narrow penin
sular region constituting the counties
ot Accomac and JNort Hampton, and
known as the Eastern bhore ot Vir
ginia, together with somo contiguous
parts of Maryland, havo laid down
their arms, and the people there have
renewed their allegiance to and ac
cepted the protection of the old flag
This leaves no armed insurrection
north of the Potomac or east of the
Chesapeake.
Also, we have obtained a footing
at each ot the isolated points on the
Southern coast, of Ilatteras, Fort Roy
al, Tybee Island, near Savanah, and
ShiD Island, and wo likowise have
some general accounts of popular
movements in behalf of the Union in
North Carolina and Tennessee. These
things demonstrate that the cause of
the Union is advancing steaauy
Southward.
Siuce your last adjournment Lieu
tenant General Scott has letired from
the head of the Army. During his
long life, the nation has not been un
mindful ot his merit; yet, on calling
to mind how faithfully, ably : and
brilliantly he ha9 served the country

I when few of the now living had been

I can not but think that we are still

your consideration, what further mark
of re ignition is due to him and our
selves as a grateful people.
With the retirement of Gen. Scott
came the Executive duty of appoint-

the Army. It is a fortunate circum
stance that neither in council nor
country was there, so tar as I
kuow, any difference of opinion as to
the proper person to bo koluctca.
The retiring Chief repeatedly express
led his judgment in favor of Geueral
McCleliau for the position, and in this
the natiou seemed to give an unani
mous concurrenfo. The designation
of General McClellan is therefore, in
a considerable degree, the selection of
tho country as well as of the Execu
tive, aud hence there is hotter reason
to hope there will be'givea him the
confidence and cordial support thus
by fair implication promised, and
without which ho can not with so full
efficiency serve the country. It has
been said that one bad Geuoial is bet
ter than two good ones, and the say
ing is true it taken to mean no uioro
than that an army, is better directed
by a single mind, though inferior.than
by two superior ones at variance and
cross purposes, and tho same is true
10 all joiut operations wherein those
ugaged can haveaouoluta command
end in view, and can differ only as to
the choice ol means. In a storm at
so a no one on board can wish the ship
to sink, and yet not unfrequontly all
go down together, because too many
will dtrectand no single mind can be
allowed to control.
It continues to develop that the in-.
surroction is largely, if uot exclusive
ly, a war upon the first principles ot
popular government; the rights ol the
people. Conclusive eviueuco 01 mis
is found in the mo3t grave and ma
turely considered public documents as
well as iu the general tone ot the in
surgents. In these documents we find
the abridgement of the existing right
of suffrage, and tho deui&l t the peo
ple ot all right to participate id the
election of public officers, except the
legislative body, advocated with la
bored arguments to prove that large
control ot the Government in tho peo
plo is the sourco ot an political evil.
Monarchy, itself, is sometimes hinted
at as a possible refuge from the pow
er of the people. In my present po
a. I II 1 . . 1
sition 1 could scarcely be justihcd
were 1 to omit raising a warning voice
against this approach of returning des
potism. It is not needed northing
here that a general argument should
bo made in favor of popular institu
tions, but thero is one poiut with its
connections not so hackneyed as most
others, to which I ask a brief atten
tion: It is the effort to place capital
on an equal footing with, ifnot above
labor in tho structure of government.
It is assumed that labor is available
only in connection with capital; that
nobody labors, unless somebody elso
owing capital, somehow by the use of
it, induces him to labor, llus aasum
ed, it is next considorod whether it is
best that capital shall lure laborers,
and induce them to work by their own
consent, or buy them and drive them
to it without their consent. Having
proceeded so far, it is naturally con
eluded that all laborers are either hir
ed laborers or what wo call slaves,
and, further, it is assumed, that who
ever is once a hired laborer is fixed io
that condition for life. Now, there is
no such relation between capital and
labor, as assumed, nor is there any
such thing as a free man being fixed
tor life in tho condition ot a hired la
borer. Poll) of these assumptions are false.
and all interence. from them are
groundless. Labor is prior to and in
dependent of capital. Capital is only
the iruit 01 labor, and could never
existed if labor had not flret existed.
Labor is superior to capital, and do-
serves much the higher consideration.
Capital has its riguts, whnli areas
worthy ot protection as any other
rights. Nor is it denied that there
is, and probably always will bo, a re-
ation between labor and capital, pro
ducing mutual benefits. TLe error U
iu assuming that the whole labor of a
community exists within that relation.
A tew men own capital, and that
few avoid labor, and with their capi
tal hire or buv a few to labor tor them.
A large majority belong to neither
class neither work for others uor
have others working for them, Id
most of the Southern States a major
ity of the whole people ot all colors
are neither slaves nor masters; while
in the Northern a large majority, who
are neither hirers nor hired men,with
their families, wives, sons and daugh
ters work for themselves on their
farms, in their houses and in their
shops, taking the whole product to
thomselves and asking no lavors of
capital, on the one hand, nor of hired
laborers or slavus on the other. It is
not forgotten that a considerable num
ber of persons mingle their own labor
with capital, that is, they labor with
their own hands and also bay or hire

only a mixed aud not a distinct class.
No principle stated is disturbed by
the existence of this mixed class.-"-
Again, as has already been said.there
is not ot necessity any such thing as
the free hired laborer being fixed for
that condition for life. Mauy indo
pendent men every-where in these
States, a few years tack in their lives
I

the just aud generous aud prosperous
system which opens the way to all,
gives hope to all, and consequent en
ergy, progress and improvement of
tho'coudition to all. No men living
ara more worthy to be trusted than
those who toil up or on from poverty,
nono less inclined to take or touch
aught which they have not honestly

Let them beware of surrendering a
political power which they already
possess, and which, if surrendered,
will b9 surely usod to closo the door
of advancement against such as they,
and to fix new disabilities and bur
dens upoa them till all of liberty shall

From the first takingof our nation

and we find our population, at the eud
of the period, eight times as great as
it was at the boginuing. The in

of the States and the Union, has pro
duced in a given time, and also what,
if firmly maintained, it promises for

Wood and Coal Wanted!
Cannot some one who owes ns on

Wood? We have been without wood
for two weeks. Each one expects
some other one to bring in wood. So
we get none. Some man can do us a
favor by starting a load. .
The President's Message.
We endorse the message so far as
the President goes, with a few excep
tions. that xre consider most absurd
aud ridiculcus.
First. We aro opposed to the ac
knowledgment of the independence
of Hayti and Liberia two Negro
Governments, and the establishment
of diplomatic agents at these two ne
gro courts, or the permission of the
darkey diplomatists at Washington.
Second. We are opposed to bein
taxed to feed and clothe slaves, who,
the President says, "must be provid
ed for in some way." We, for one,
have enough to feed and clothe of our
own; and, next to our own household,
we will be taxed for the subsistence of
our own poor. We believe, with the
Divine Law. "that he who will not
urovide for his own houso, is a fool
and worso than an infidel."
TiIird. We aro opposed to receive
slaves in lien of money for taxes due
from Slave States, which the Presi
dent says we "should receive, accord
ing to some mode of valuation, in
lien pro tanto of direct taxee;" and
"that Buch persons, (slaves,) on such
acceptauce by the General Govern
ment, be at once deemed freey' "and
that steps bo taken to colonize snch
persons, at some place or places, in
climate congenial to them."
Citizens of Ohio aro to be taxed,
aud made pay in money, while citizens
of Slave States are to be taxed
likewise, and pay in Slaves, and the
Government is at once to set said
taxes (ilaves) tree 1 Great God

. .Fodbtb. We are opposed to the
further acquisition of Territory for the
purpose of colonizing free blacks
slaves, and the expenditure of money
fof each purpose, as recommtnded by

tions hereafter.
