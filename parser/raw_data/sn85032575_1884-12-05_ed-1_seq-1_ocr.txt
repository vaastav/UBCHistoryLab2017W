President's Message.
To tbe Congress of tl e United States:
Since the close of your last session, tbe
American people, in the exercises of their
highest right of suffrago have chosen their
chief magistrate for tho four years ensuing.
When it is remembered that at no period
in tho country's history has tho long politi
cal contest which customarily precedes the
day of the national election waged with
greater fever and intensity, it is n subject of
congratulation that after tho controversy
at the polls was over and while the slightest
preponderance by which tho issue had been
determined was as yet uncertain, the public
peace suffered no disturbance, but tho peo
ple everywhere patiently and quietly await
ed the result. Nothing could more striking
ly illustrate the temper of the American cit
izen, his lot o of order and his loyalty to the
law, and nothing could more signally dem
onstrate tho strength of widom of our po
litical institution'. Eight y ears have passed
since a controversy concerning tho result
of a national election sharply called the at
tention of tho congress to the necessity
of providing more definite regulations
for the counting of the electoral vote.
It is of tho greatest .importance that this
question should be sohed before conflicting
claims to tho presidency shall again dUtract
the country, and I am persuaded that by the
people at large any of the measures of relief
thus far proposed would be preferred to con
tinued inaction.
Our relations with all foreign powen. con
tinue to bo amicable. With Belgium a cou-
cntion has been signed u hereby tho seopo
of tho present has been so enlarged as to se
cure to the citizens of cither country within
the jurisdiction equal richts and prhileges.
In the acquisition and alienation of property
a trade mark treaty has also been concluded.
The war between Chili and Peru is at an
end. For tho arbitration of tho claims of
American citizens who during its continu
ance suffered through the acts of the Chilian
authorities a convention will soon be nego
tiated.
The state of hostilities between France and
China continue to be an embarrassing feature
of our eastern relations. The Chinese gov
ernment has promptly adjusted and paid the
claims of American citizens whoe property
was destroyed in the recent riots at Canton.
I renew the recommendations of my last an
nual message that the Canton indemnity
fund bo returned to China; the true interpre
tation of the treaty with that country per
mitting the restoration of Chinese
immigration is likely to be again
tho subjects of your deliberations. It may
be seriously questioned whether the statutes
passed at the last session docs not violate tho
treaty rights of certain Chincso who left this
country with return certificates valid under
tho eld law but now seem to be debared
from landing from lack of certificates re
quired by the new law. Tho recent purchase
by tbo united States of a large trading fleet
heretofore under tho Chinese flag has con
siderably enhanced our commercial import
ance in the cast In iew of the largo number of
vessel built or purchased by American citi
zens in other countries and exclusively em
ployed in legitimate traffic between foreign
ports under the recognized protection of our
flag it might be well to provide a uniform
rate of their registration and documentation,
so that the bona fide property rights of our
citizens therein, shall be duly evinced and
property guarded. Pursuant to the advice
of the senate at the last session, I recognized
the flag of the international association of the
congress that of a friendly government
avoiding in so doing any prejudgment of
conflict. In territorial claims in regions
subsequent to the execution of the expressed
wish of congress, I appointed a commercial
agent for the Congo basin. The import
ance of tbe rich, prospective trade of Congo
valley has led to the general conviction that
it should be opened to all nations upon equal
terms. An international conference for tho
consideration of this congress has been called
by the emperor of Germany and u now in ses
sion at Berlin. Delegates are in attendance
on behalf of the Unite States. Of the results
of this conference you will be duly advised.
Tho government of Corea has generously
aided tho efforts of tho United States minister
to secure suitable premises for the use of the
legation. As the condition of the diplomat
ic intercourse with eastern nations demand
the legation premises be owned by the rep
resented power, I advise that an appropria'
tion be made for the acquisition of this prop
erty by the government. Tho United
States already possesses valuable premises
at Tongier, as a gift from the sultan of Mo
rocco. As stated hereafter, they have lately
received a similar gift from the Si
amese government. Tho govern
ment of Japan stands ready to rent
to us extcnive grounds at Tokio where
in to erect a suitable building for the lega
tion, court house and jail, and similar privil
eges can probably bo secured in China and
Persia. The owning of such premises would
not only effect a large saving of per cent in
rentals, but would permit of the due asser
tion of extra territorial rights in those coun
tries, and would be better to maintain tho
dignity of the United States.
Tbe failure of congress to make an ap
propriation for our representation at the Ot
toman court of tho khedh c has proved a
serious embarrassment to tho intercourse
with Egypt and in iew of tbe necessary
intimacy of diplomatic relationship due to
the participation of this government. As
one of the trade powers in all matters of ad
ministration effecting the rights of foreign
ers, I advise tho restoration of the accnev
and consulate-general at Cairo on its for
mer basis. I do not conceive it to bo the
wish of congress that the United States
should withdraw altogether from the honor
able position they have hitherto held with
respect to tho khedive, or that citizens of
this republic residing or sojourning in Egypt
should hereafter bo without the aid and'pro
tection of a competent representative.
With Franco tho traditional cordial rela
tionship continues. Tho Bartholdi statue of
liberty enlightening tho world. Tho gener
ous gift of the people of Franco is expected
to reach New York in .May next.
I suggest that congressional action
bo taken in relation to tho spirit
which has prompted this gift and in aid of
tho timely completion of the pedestal upon
which it is to bo placed.
Our relations with Germany, a country
which contributes to our own some of the
best elements of citizenship, continue to be
cordial. The United States liavo extradition
treaties with several of the German states,
but by reason of the confederation of these
states under the imperial rule the applica
tion of such treaties Is not as uniform and
comprehensive as the interests of
the two countries require. I propose
therefore to open negotiations for a single
convention of extradition, to embrace all the
treaties of the empire. It affords mo pleasure
to say that our intercourse with Great Ilrit
ian continues to be of tho most friendly
character. The government of Hawii has
indicated its willingness to continue forseven
years the provisions of the reciprocal treaty.
Of such continuance, in view of tho rela
tions of that country to the American system
oi states snouia in my judgment be luvored.
The revolution against the established gov
ernment has terminated. While it was in
progress it became necessary to enforce our
neutrality iiri vy instituting proceedings
against individuals and vessels with tbeir in
fringements. These prosecutions were in
all cases successful.
Much anxiety has lately been displayed
by tho various 'European governmens, and
sired, and such a treaty I have reason to be
lieve, that the Mexican government standi
readv tO rnnrlllrie. Knmn Mntiaivcimunt
has been occasioned by the failure of con
gress at its last session, to provido means
for due execution of the treaty of July 29th,
1882, for the rcsurvey of the Mexican boun
dary and tho relocation of boundary monu
ments.
With tho republic of Nicaragua, a treatv
has been concluded, which authorizes tbe
construction bv the United States of a canal
railway and telegraph lino across tho Nica
ragua territory. JJy the terms of this treaty,
sixty miles oftho fiver of San Juan as well
as lako Nicaragua, an inland sea forty miles
in width are to constitute a part of the pro
jected enterprise, This covers for actual
canai construction seventeen miles on tne
Pacific side and thirtv-six miles on tho At
lantic. To the United States, whose rich
territory on tho Pacific is, for the ordinary
purposes of commerce, practically cut off
Irom communication by water with the At
lantic ports, tho political and commercial
advantages of 6Uch a project can scarcely be
overestimated. It is believed that when the
treaty is laid before you the justico and lib
erality of its provisions will command uni
versal approval at homo and abroad.
Tho death of our representative to Kussia
whilo at his post in St. Petersburg, afforded
to tho imperial government a renewed op
portunity to testily it-, sympathy
in a manner bculting tho intimate
friendliness which has .ever marked
tho intercourse of the two countries.
The course of tho government in raising
its representation at Bangkok to tbe diplo
matic rank, as et oked from Siam evidences
of warm friendship, augurs for our enlarged
intercourse with the Siamese government,
has presented to us commodious, mansion
grounds foi .no u-gion and suggest that
by joint resolution congress will at
test its appreciation of this generous gift.
This government mora than once hns been
called upon too lato to take action in fulfill
ment of its international obligation towards
Spain. The agitation in the island of Cuba
is hostilo to tho Spanish crown, having been
fermented by persons abuing tho sacred
rights of hospitality w hich our tcrritorv af
fords. Tho officers of tho government lute
been instructed to proteht infractions of our
ncutralit- laws at Key West andat tho other
points near the Cuban coast. I am happy
to say that in the only instance
whero these precautionary measures
were successfully eluded, the offenders when
tound in our territory wcresubeaucntlv
apprehended and convicted. The growing
need of close relationship of intercourse and
iiauiu uanwu iiiu paiia nijiuus, anu 4UC
natural market in tho United States led to
the adoption in January last of a commercial
agreement looking to that end. This agree
ment has since been supercecded by a more
carefullv framed and comprehensive conven
tion, which shall be submitted to the
senate for approval. It has
been the aim of this negotiation
open such a favorite reciprocal exchange of
production, carncu unucr tne nag ot either
country, so as to make tho intercourse be
tween China, Porto Juco and ourselves
scarcely less intimate than tho commercial
movement between our domestic ports, and
to insure a removal of the burdens on ship
ping in the Spanish Indies which in the past
our ship owners and ship masters
have so often had cause to comnlain of.
The negotiations of this convention Las for a
time postponed tho prosecution of certain
claims of our citizens which were declared
to bo without the jurisdiction of late Spanish-American
claims commission and which
w c therefore remitted to diplomatic chan
nels for adjustment. Tho speedy settlement
of their claims will not bo urged by tho gov
ernment. Negotiations for a treaty Tor commercial re
ciprocity with the Dominican republic hate
been a success, fully concluded, and tho re
sult will shortly bo laid before tbe senate.
Certain questions between the United
States and tho Ottoman empire still remain
unsolved. Complaints in behalf of our citi
zens are not satisfactorily adjusted. The
porto has sought to withhold from our com
merce the right of favorable treatment to
which we are entitled bv existing conven
tional stipulations and the revision
of the tariff is unaccomplished.
The final disposition of tho pending question
with Venezuela has not as yet been reached,
out i nave good reason to expect an cany
b" define the statues of persons bom
tion of congress to become effective.
Tho legislation will, I doubt, be among within tho United States subject to a foreign
the first measures to claim your at- power. Section 1092 and o't minor children
lemiuu. .i iuii treaty oi commerce, naviga
tion and consular rights, is much to be de-
of fathers who havn ilnelnreit ttieie intent inn
of becoming citizens, but failed to per-
tneir naturalization, it might
feet
bo wise to provida ft eentrnl nnrpfltt nf rm..
istry wherein should bo- filed authenticated
i transcripts of every record of naturalization
ui luosetcrailcaeral and state courts, and
to make provision also for the vacation or
cancellation of such record in cases where
fraud ha! bcen'practiccd upon the court by
the applicant himself or where he had re
moved or forfeited his npnuinvl ritfypmnln.
A just and uniform law in this respect would
sircugiiien tno nanus oi mo government in
protecting its citizens abroad and would
pave tho way for tho conclusion of treaties
oi naturalization with foreign countries.
Tho legislation of the last session affected
in diplomatic and consular service contain
changes which have been productivo of em
uarassment. Tho population and intermed-
iiuo activity ot our country are steadily on
tho increase and are civinir rise to new tar
ing and often delicate relationship with oth
er countries. Our foreign establishment
now embraces nearly double the area ot op
erations that it did tw enty years ago. The
confirment of such a service within the lim
its of expenditure then estab
lished is not it seems to mo in
accordance with true cconcmy. Acommunity
of sixty mih'ons of people should be ade
quately represented in its intercourse with
foreign nations. A nroiect fur the rcormni-
zation of consular service of forecasting the
scheme of extra territorial jurisdiction, is
now before you and if the limits of a short
Trtsion will not allow- its full consideration.
1 trust you will not fail to make suitable pro-
isions for the present needs of tho service.
It has been customary to define in the ap
propriation acts the rank ot each diplomatic
office tow hich a salary is attached. I sug
gest this course bo abandoned and it be left
to the president with the advice and consent
of tho senate, to fix from time to timo the
diplomatic grade of the representatives of
this cot eminent abroad as may seem ad
visable, provision bavin" been definitely
made, howet er, as now, for tho amount of
salary attached to tho respective station.
The condition of our finances and of our
operations of tho various branches
ot tho public service which
are connected with the treasury
department are very fully discussed in the
report of the secretary, and it appears that
the ordinary rctenues for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1884, were:
From customs- 195,007,489 76
" internal revenue 12180,072 21
' all other sources 31,860,307 55
The three per cent bonds of tho govern- restoring our navy as rapidly as possible to
ment to thea amount of more than $100,000,- tho high state of efficiency which formerly
000 have, since my last annual message, characterized it, as the long peace that has
been redeemed by the treasury. The bonds lulled us into a sense or fancied security
of that issue still outstanding amount to a 'may at any timo be disturbed. It is
little over $200,000,000, about one-fourth of plain that ' the policy of strengthening
which will bo retired through the operations ' this arm of the service U dictated by consid-
of tho sinking fund durimrthe cominc- year.
As the bonds still continue tho chie? basis
for the circulation of national banks, the
question how to avert tho contraction of the
crations of use and economy of iust record
for our future tranquility and of apprecia
tion of the dignity and honor of the repub
lic. The report of the postmaster irencral

at $330,000,000, and the total expenditures
at $290,620,201.16 in w hich are included inter

I ending .iune ou, ii, was as lollows:
settlement, which will provide tho means of i Domestic merchandise
especially by the government of Italy, for
tbe abolition of our import duties upon
works of art. It is well to consider whether
the present discrimination in favor of tho
American artists abroad is not likely to re
sult u they themselves seem very generally
to believe. It may result in the practical
exclusion of our painters and sculptors from
the rich fields for their occupation of study,
which they have hitherto enjoyed. There
is a prospect that the long pending revision
of theforcign treaties of Japan may be con
cluded at a new conference to be held at
Takio. While this government fully
recognizes the equal and independent
station of Japan in the community of na
tions would no oppose the general adoption
of such terms of compromise as Japan may
be disposed to offer in furtherance of the
uniform policy ot intercourse with the west
ern nation. During the past year the in
creasing good trill oetween our government
and that of Mexico has been variously man

their responsible task by holding conferences
in the principal cities with merchants and
others interested in tho Central and South
American trade.
The international meridian conference
lately held in Washington, upon the invita
tion of the government of the United States,
was composed of representatives from
twenty-five nations. Tho conference
concluded its labors on the first of Novem
ber, having with substantial unanimity
agreed upon the meridian of Greenwich of
starting point whence longitude is to be com
puted through one hundred and eighty de
grees eastward and westward, and on tho
adoption for all purposes for which it may
be tound convenient of a universal ujy
which will begin at midnight on the initial
meridian, and whose hours shall be counted
from zero up to twenty-four. Tho formal
report of the transactions ot this conference
will be hereafter transmitted to congress.
This government in frequent receipt of
invitation from foreign states to participate
in international exhibitions often of great
interest and importance. Occupying as we
do an advanced position in the worliFs pro
duction and aiming to secure a profitable
share for our industries in the general com
petitive market. It is a matter of serious
concern that the want of means for partici
pation in these exhibits should so often ex
clude our products from advantages enjoyed
by those other countries. During tho past
year the attention of congress was drawn to
to tho formal invitations in this regard ten.
dered by the governments of of "England,
Holland, Belgium, Germany and Austria.
The executivo havo in some instances ap
pointed honorary commissioners. This is,
however, a most unsatisfactory expedient for
without some provision to meet necosary
working expenses of a commission, it can
effect little or nothing in behalf of exhibit
ors. An international inventors exhibition
is to be held in London, next May.
This will cover a. field of special im
portant in which our country holds
a foremost rank, but tho executive is at pres
ent powerless to organize a projior rcpreen
tation of our vast national interests in this
direction. I havo in several previous mes
sages referred to this subject. It seem to
me thatastatutogiviiig to the executive a
general discretionary authority to accept
such invitations and appoint ho'norary com
missioners, without salary, and placing at
tho dipoal of the secretary of state a small
fund for defraying the reasonable expenses,
would be of great public utility.
This government has received official no
tice that tho revised international regula
tions for preventing collisions at sea have
been adopted by all tho leading marine
powers except tho united fctates, and came
into force on the first of September last. For
the duo protection of our shipping interests
tho provisions of our statutes should at
once be brotightinto conformity with these
regulations.
The question of securing to authors, com
posers and artists' copyright privileges was
one that may justly challenge vour
attention. It is truo that convention
will be necessary for to fully accomplish
this result. But until cone:res shall, by
statute, fix the extent to which foreign hold
ers of copv right shall be privileged, it has
been deemed inadvisable to negotiate such
conventions. For this reason the United
States were not represented at the recent
conference at Berne. I recommend that the
6cope of the neutrality laws of tho United
States be so enlarged as to coverall patent
acts of hostility committed in our territory
and aimed against the peace of a friendly
nation. Existing statutes prohibit the fitting
out oi an armeu expedition and restrict
the shipment of explosives through the en
actments in the latter respect were not
framed with regard to international obliga
tions but simply for tho protection of pas
senger travel. All these statutes were in
tended to meet special emergencies that had
already arisen. Other emergencies have
arisen since, and modem ingenuity supplies
means for organization of hostili
ties without open resort to
armed vessels to filibustering parties.
I seeno reason why overt preparations in
in this country for the commission of crimi
nal acts such as are here tinder consideration
should not be alike punishable, whether
such acts are intended to be committed in
our own country or in a foreign country,
with which we are at peace. The prompt
and thorough"treatment of this question is
ono which intimately concerns the national
honor. Our existing naturalization laws
also need revision, those sections relating to
persons residing within the limits of the
United States in 1795 and 1798 have now
only a historical interest. Section 2,712 rec
ognizing the citizenship of the children
of naturalized parents is ambiguous
in its terms and partly obsolete. There are
special provisions of laws favoring the natur
alization of those who serve in the army or
on merchant vessels, while no similar privi
leges at are granted those who serve in the
navy or marine corps. An uniform rule of
naturalization, such as tbe constitution con
templates, should among other things, clear-

I concur with tho secretary of the treasury
in recommending tho immediate suspension
of the coinage of silver dollars, and the is
suance of silver certificates. This is a matter
to which in former communications I have
more than once invited the attention of the
national legislature. It appears that annual
ly for the post six years there have been
coined, in compliance with tho act of Feb
ruary 28, 1878, more than twenty millions of
silver dollars. The number now outstanding
is reported bv tho secretary to be nearly one
hundred and cighty-flvo millions, wliereof
but little morethon forty millions, or lcs
than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation.
The mere existence of this fact seems to me
to furnish of itself a cognant argument for
the repeal of the stututo which has made
such facts possible. But there arc other and
graver considerations that tend in the same
direction. Tho secretary avows bis convic
tion that unless this coinage and tho issuance
of silver certificates bo suspended, silver is
likely at no distant day to become our o!e
mctalic standard. The commercial standard
and the impairment of national credit that
would bo thus occasioned can scarcely be
overestimated. I hope that tho secretary's
suggestion respecting tho withdrawal from
circulation of tho one dollar and two dollar
notes will reccivo your approval. It is likely
that a coniderahlo portion of the silver now
in tho vaulU of the treasury might find its
way into currency whilu trade dollars have
ceased, for tho pre-ent at least, to bo an ele
ment of aclivcTlisturbancc in our currency
system. Somo provision should be made for
their surrender to tho government. In view
of the circumstances under which they were
coined and of the fact that they havo never
had a legal tender quality, there should be
offered for them only a slight advance over
their bullion value. The secretary in the
course of his report considers the propriety
of beautifying the designs of our subsidiary
silver coins and of so Increasing their weight.
that they may bear their due ratio ot value
of standard dollars, llis conclusions in this
regard are cordially approved. In my an
nual messatro of 1882 I recommended! the
abolition of all exciso tax except those re
lating to di-tllled spirits. - i he recommenda
tion is now renewed. In caso these taxes
shall be abolished the revenues that will still
remain to the government will in my opinion
not only surfirnto pet its reasonable evnenil-
itures, but will afford a surplus large enough
to permit such tariff reduction as may seem
to be advisable when the results of recent
revenue laws and commercial treaties shall
have shown in what quarters these reduc-
nuns can ue. most luuiciousiy euecieu. une
oi the gravest of the problems which ap
peal to tne wisdom ot congress lor solution
is the ascertainment of the most effective
means of increasing our foreign trade and
thus relieving tho depression under whicn
our industries are now languishing. The
secretary of tho treasury advises that the
duty of investigation of this subject be en
trusted in the first instanco to a competent
commission which fully recognizes the con
siderations which may'be urged against this
course. I am. nevertheless, of tho opinion
that on the whole no other would be likely
to effect speedier or better results. That
portion of tho secretary's report which con
cerns the condition of our interest cannot
fail to command your attention. He em
phatically recommends that as an incentive
to investment of American capital in Amer
ican steamships the government shall by
liberal payments for mail transpor
tation or otherwise lends its
active assistance to individual en
terprise and declares his belief that unless
that course be pursued our foreign carrying
trade must remain as it is to-day, almost ex
clusively in tho hands of foreigners. One
phase ot this subject is now especially prom
inent in view of tbe repeal by the " act of
June 26, 1884, of all salutary provisions ar
bitrarily compelling American Vessels to
carry the mails to and from tbe United
States, as it is neeessary to make provisions
to compensate the owners of such vessels
for performing that service after April 16,
1885. It is hoped that the whole subject
will receive the early consideration that will
lead to the enactment of such measures for
the revival of our merchant marine as the
wisdom of congress may devise
constantly increasing importance.
It seems to be generally conceded that the
law governing that matter exacts from the
banks excessive ecuritv,and that upon their
I-ii-ii, uu;iua ucjwsiu u larger circulation
than is now allowed may be granted with
safety. I hope that the bill which passed
tho senate at the last session permitting the
issue of notes equal to the face value of de
posited bonds will commend itself to the ap-
iiu ai ui tue uoiue oi representatives.
In the expenses of the war department the
secretary reports a decrease of more of more
than $9,000,000, of which a reduction of
5j,&Ov,000 was affected in the expenditures
for rivers and harbor and $2,700,000 in the
expenditures for the quartermaster depart
ment. Outside of that department the an
nual expenses of the army bureau properly
(except possibly the ordnance bureau) are
substantially charges which cannot be mate
rially diminished without a change in tho
numerical strength of the army. The ex
penditures of tho quartermaster's depart
ment cannot bo readily subjected to admin
istrative discretion, and it is reported by tho
secretary of war that as a result of exercising
such discretion on reducing the number of
draught animals in the army the annual costs
of supplying and caring for such animals is
now $100,085.90 less them it was in 1882.
The reports of the military commanders
show that the last year has been notable for
ia cmuo iri-vuuui iruiu inuian outurcaies.
In defiance of tho president's proclamation
of July 1, 1884, certain intruders sought to
make settlements in the Indian Territory.
They were promptly removed bv a detach
ment of troops. During tho past session of
congress a diu to provide lor a suitaDlo nrc
proof building for tho army medical musi-
uui aim tne iiDrary oi tne surgeon generals
cflice, received the approval of the senate.
A similar bill, reported to tho house of rep
icscmuuies u one oi its committees, is still
pending before that body. It is hoped that
during the coming session the measure may
become a law, and thereafter immediate steps
may be taken to secure a place of safe de
posit for these valuable collections, now in a
state of insecurity. The funds with which
these works for the improvements of rivers
and harbors were prosecuted during the past
year were derived from the appropriations
of August 2, 1882, together with such few
balances as were on hand from previous ap
propriations. Balance, in treasury subject to

The secretary of war submits tbe report of
tno cmei ot engineers as to the practicability
of protecting our important cities on the
seaooards Dy lortitication and other defences
able to repel modem methods of attack.
The time has now como when such defences
can be prepared with confidence that they
will not prove abortivo, and when the pos
sible result oi delay in making such prepa
ration is seriously considered, tho delay
seems inexcusuable, for the most important
cities, those whoso destruction or capture
would be a national humiliation, adequate
defences, inclusive of guns, may bo made
by tho gradual expenditure of "$60,000,000,
a stun inucii less man a victorious enemy
could levy as a contribution. An appropri
ation of about one-tenth of that amount is
asked to begin the work and I concur with
tho secretary of war in urging that they be
granted. The w ar department is proceeding
with the conversion of 10-inch smooth bore
funs into 8-inch rifles by linir.g the former.
he tubes are of forged or of coiled wrought
iron. Fifty guns will be thus converted
within the year. This, however, does not
obv into tbe necessity of providing means for
the construction of guns of the highest pow
er, both for tho purpose of coast
defense and for the war vessels.
The report of the gun foundry board ap
pointed April 2, 1883, in pursuance of the
act oi Jlarch -', IbBJ, was transmitted to
congress in a special message of February
8, 1884, in my message of March ?C. 1884, I
called attention to tho recommendation of
the board that the government should en
courage, the production, of private steel
works of the required material for heavy
cannon and tnat the government lactones,
ono for the army and one for the navy.
should be established for the fabrication of
guns from such material. No action having
been taken, the board was subsequent
ly reconvened to determine more
fully tbe plans and estimates for
carrying out its recommendations.
It has received information which indicates
that there are responsible steel manufactur
ers in this country who, although not pro
vided at present "with the necessary plant,
are w illmg to construct the same and to
make bids for contracts with the govern
ment for the supply of the requisite materials
for the heaviest guns adapted for medern
warfare, if a guaranteed order of sufficient
magnitude, accompanied by a positive ap-
prupnauun cxienuing over a series oi years
shall bo made by conrress. All doubts as
to the feasibility of the plan being thus re
moved, I renew my recommendation that
such action be taken by congress as will en
able the government to construct its own
ordnance upon its own territory and to pro
vide the armament demanded by considera
tions oi national saiety and honor.
The report of tho secretary of the navy
exhibits the progress which has been made
on the new steel cruisers authorized by the
acts of August 5. 1882. and March 3, 188:).
of the four vessels under contract; the Chi
cago, of 4,500 tons, is more than half fin
ished; the Atlanta, 3,000 tons, has been suc
cessfully launched and her machinery is now
fitting; the Boston, also of 3,000 tons, is
ready for launching, and the Dolphin, a dis-
fiatcn steamer of 1,500 tons, is ready for de
ivcry. Certain adyerse criticisms upon the designs
of thesa cruisers are discussed by the secre
tary, who insists that the correctness of the
conclusions reached by the advisory board
and bv- tho department has been "demon
strated by the recent development on ship
building" abroad. The machinery ot the
donble-turrcted monitors Puritan, Terror
and Amphitrite, contracted for under the act
of March 3rd, 1883, is in process of con
struction. No work has been dono during
tbe pat year on their armor for lack of the
necessary appropriation. A fourth monitor,
the Mondonock, still remains unfinished at
tho navy yard in California. It
is recommended that early steps
bo taken to complete these vessels,
and to provide also an armament for tbe
monitor Mantonomoh. The recommendation
of tho naval advisory board, approved by
tho department, comprise tho construction
of ono steel cruiser of 4,500 tons, one cruiser
of 3,000 tons, two heavily armed gnnboats,
ono long cruising gunboat, one dispatch
vessel, armed with liotchkiss cannon, ono
armored ram and three torpedo boats. The
general designs, all of which are calculated
to meet tho existing wants oi the service, are
now well advanced, and the construction of
the vessels can bo undertaken as soon as you
shall grant tho necessary authority.
1 ho act or congress approved August i,
1882, authorized tbe removal to the United
States of the bodies of Lieut. Commander
Geo. W. DeLong and his companions of the
Jeanette expedition. This removal has been
successfully accomplished by Lieuts. Har
ber and Scnultz. The remains were taken
from their graves in the Lena Delta in
March, 1883, and were retained at Yakutsk
until the following winter, the season being
too far advanced to admit of their immediate
transportation. They arrived at New York
February 20, 1884." They were received
with suitable honors in pursuance of the
joint resolution of congress approved Feb
ruary 19, iooi. A naval expeauion
was fitted out for the relief of Lieut- A.
W. Greelv. United States army, and of the
party who had been engaged under his com-
manu in scienuuu ouservauuus ui -ljiu
Franklin bay. Tho fleet consisted of the
steam scaler Thetl, purchased in England,
the Bear purchased at St. Johns, Newfound
land, and the Alert which was generously
provided by the British government. Prep
arations for the expedition were promptly
made by tho secretary of the navy with the
active co-opertion of the secreta'ry'of war.
Commander George W. Coffin was placed
in command of the Alert, and Lieut. V. IL
Emery in command of tbe Bear. The The
tis was entrusted to Commander Winfield S.
Copely, to whom also was assigned the su
perintendency of the entire expedition.
Immediately "upon Its arrival at Uppernar
ick the fleet began the dangerous navigation
of Melville Bay, and in spite ot every obsta
cle, reached Littleton Island on June 22nd,
a fortnight earlier than any vessel had be
fore attained that point. On the sameday
it crossed over to Cape Sabine, where Lieut.
Greeley and the other survivors of his party
were discovered. After taking on board
the living and the bodies of the dead, the
relief ships sailed for St. Johns; where they
arrived on Jul- 17th. They were appro
priately received at Portsmouth, N. It, on
August 1st, and at New York Au
gust Sth. One of the bodies
was landed at the former
place, and the others were
put on shore at Governor's
island, with the exception of one which was
intcred in the Victoria cemetary, where it
was forwarded thence to the destination in
dicated by friends. The organization and
ronduct of this relief expedition reflects
great credit upon all who contributed to its'
success.
In this, the last of the stated messages that
I shall have the honor to transmit to the
congress of the United States, I cannot too
strongly urge on its attention the duty of

One of the First Settlers of this Valley
gratifying fact that the loss of revenue from Treaties in the Vine of this policy which have '
the reduction in rate of letter postals as
recommended in December, 1882, and ef
fected by the act of March 3, 1883, has been
much less than was generally anticipated.
My recommendation of this reduction was
based upon the beherthat the actual railing
off in receipts from letter postage for tho
year immediately succeeding the change of
rates could do JkJ,uw,UUUl It has proved to
bo only 2!75,000. This is a trustworthy
indication that the revenue will soon bo re
stored to iU formor volume by the natural
increase of sealed correspondence. I confi
dently repeat, therefore, the recommenda
tion of my last annual message that einglo
rate postage upon drop letters be reduced to
one cent; a heavier payment of two cents is
now required by law. The double rate is
only exacted at offices where tbo carrier
system is in operation, and it appears that at
the office where tbe carrier system is in
operation, and it appears that at the offices
that tbo increase in tax upon local letters de
frays the cost not only of its own collection
and delivery of all other
mail matter. This is an equality
that ought no longer to exist. I approve
the commendation of tbe postmaster-general,
that tbe unity ot weight in the rating of
nmt-ciass matter should be one ounce, in
stead of one-half, as it is now. In view of
the statistics furnished by the department,
it may be well to be doubted whether the
result in any loss of the revenue, that it
would irreatly promote the convenience of
tho public is beyond dispute. The free de
livery system has been lately applied to
five cities, and the total number of
offices it is now in operation is 159.
Experience shows that it is an accommoda
tion to the public and an advantage to th
postal service. It is more than half sustain
ing and for tho reasons urged by the post
master general may be properly extended.
It is the opinion of that officer that it is
proper to provide means whereby exception
al despatch in dealing with letters in free de
livery offices may be secured by paying ex
traordinary postage. This schema might be
made effective by the employment of a spec
ial stamp whose cost should be commensur
ate with the expense of extra service. In
some of the large cities private express com
panies have undertaken to outstrip the gov
ernment mail carrier by a forwarding for
the prompt transmission of letters better la-
ciiuies tnan nave nunertn oeen at tne com
mand of the postofficc. It has always been
tho policy of the government to discourage
such enterprises and in no way can that pol-
fij ue luuiuLuiueu man in supplying tne
public with tbo most efficient mail service
that with dun regard to its own best interest
can be lumished for its own accom
modation. Tho attorney general renews the recom
mendation contained in his report of last
year touching the fees of witnesses and
jurors. He favors radical chances in
tbe fee bill, the adoption of a system by
which attorneys and marshals of the United
States should be compensated solely bv sal
aries, and tho erection by the government of
a penitentiary tor the confinement of otlen
dcrs against its laws.
Of the varied governmental concerns in
charge of tbe interior department, tbe re
ports of its secretary present an interesting
summary. Among the topics deserving par
ticular aucntiun, i mer to ois ooservauons
respecting our Indian affairs,! he pre-emption
and timber culture acts, the failure of rail
road companies to take title lands granted
by the government and the operations of the
pension ouice, the patent omce, the census
bureau and the bureau of education.
Allusion has been made to the circumstance
that, both as between. independent Indian
tribes, as between Indians and the whites.
The past year has been one of unbroken
peace. Under this circumstance the presi
dent is glad to find justification for the policy
oi tne government in ueaung witntne Indian
question and confirmation of viewa which
were fully expressed in his first communica
tion to the 47th congress. The secretary
asked for a new re-enactment of the statute
for punishment of crimes of committed on
Indian reservations, and recommends the
passage of a bill now pending in the house
of representatives for tbe purchase of a tract
of 18,000 square miles from the Sioux reser
vations. Both measures are worthy approval.
I concur with him in advising the repeal of
the pre-emption lew and tbe enactment of
statutes resolving the present legal complica
tion touching lapsed grants to railroad com
panies, and the funding of the debts of the
Pacific railroads under such guaranty as
shall effectually insure its ultimate payment.
The. report of the Utah commission will be
read n ith interest. It discloses the results of
recent legislation looking to tbe prevention
and punishment of polygamy in that terri
tory. 1 still believe that abominable prac
tice can be suppressed ny law. at can only
be by tbe most radical legislation
and consistont restrains of the constitution.
I can again recommend, therefore, that
conirress assume the entire political control
of the territory of Utah; provide for the ap
pointment of a commission with such gov
ernmental power as in its judgment may
iustifv nud wisely nut into their hands.
In the course of this communication ref
erence has more than once been made to the
policy of this government as regards the
extension of our foreign trade. It seems
proper to declare the general principle that
should in my opinion underlie our national
efforts in this direction. The main condi
ditions of this problem may be thus stated:
We are a people in mercantile pursuits, and
fertilo in invention. We cover a vast extent
of territory, rich in agricultural products, and
nearly all'the raw materials necessary "for
successful manufacture. We have a system
of productive establishments more than suf
ficient to supply our own demands. The
wages of labor are nowhere else so great.
The scalo of living of our artisian class is
such as tends to secure their personal com
fort and the developments of thoe higher
morals and intellectual qualities that go to
the making of good citizens. Our system of
tax and tariff legislation is yielding a reven
uo which is in excess of the present needs of
the government. Those are elements from
which it is sought to devise a scheme by
which without unfavorably chang
ing the condition of the working men,
our merchant marine shall be raised from its
enfeebled condition and new markets pro
vided for the sales beyond our borders of the
manifold fruits of our industrial enterprises.
Tho problem is complex and can be solved
by no single measure of innovation or re
form. Tbo countries of the American con
tinent and the adjacent islands are for the
United States the natural market of supply
and demand. It is from them we should
obtain what wo do not produce or do not
produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that
tho surplus productions of our fields, our
mills and our workshops should flow, under
conditions tbat will equalize or favor them
in comparison with foreign competition.
Four paths'of policy seems to point to this
end. FirsCa series of reciprocal commer
cial treaties- with the countries of America
which shall foster between us and them an
increase of trade, tho conditions of these
treaties should bo the free admissions ot such
merchandise as this country does not pro
duce in return for admission free, or unaer a
favorable scheme of duties, of our products,
tho benefits of such exchange to apply on
these goods carried, under flag on both
sides from vessels to so privileged of all
tonage, dues and national imports, see that
their vessels may ply unhindered between our
ports and those of the other contracting par
ties throueh without infringing on the de
served home coasting trade, tho removal or
reduction of burdens on the exported pro
ducts of those countries coming within the
benefits of the treaties, and the avoidance of
the technical restrution and penalties by
which our intercourse with more countries
is at present hampered. Secondly, tho es
tablishment of a consular servico of the
United States on a salaried footing pcrmit-
tingthe relinquishment ot consular tees, not
only as respects vessels under the national
flag, but also as respects vessels of tbe treaty
of nations carrying goods entitled
to tbe benefit" of tho treaties.
Thirdly, the enactment of measures to favor
the construction and maintenance of steam
carrying marine under the flag of the United
States. Fourthly, the establishment of a
uniform currency basis for tbe countries of
America, so that the coined products of our
mints may circulate on equal terms through
out the whole system of commonwealth.
This would require a monetary union of
America whereby the output of" the bullion
producing countries, and tbe circulation of
those which yield neither gold nor silver
could be adjusted in conformity with the
populatiou, wealth and commercial needs of
each, as many of the countries furnish no bul
lion to the common stock.Thc surplus produc
tion of our mines and mints might thus be
utilized and a step taken toward tbe general
remonitization of silver. To the accomplish
ment of these ends, so far as they can be
obtained by separate treaties.the negotiations
already concluded and now in progress, have
been directed, and the favor with which this
enlarged policy has thus far been received,
warrants its belief that its operations will
ere long embrace all, or nearly all, the coun
tries ofthia hemisphere. It is by no means
desirable, however, that the policy under
consideration should be applied to these
countries at once. The healthful enlarge
ment of our trade with Europe,
Asia and Africa should be sought
by reducing the tarilTburdens on such, of

friends in securing competent and faithful
public servants and in protecting the ap

presiure of personal importunity and from
tho labor of examining the claims and pre
tensions of rival candidate for public em

fied support of the president and
of the heads of tbe several depart
ments and the members oi tne commission
have performed their duties with zeal and
fidelity. Their report will shortly be sub

recommendations for enlarging tbe scope
of the existing statutes as shall commend
themselves to the executive and the commis

the differences of sentiment which have
hitherto prevented its enactment may not
outlast the present session.
The pestilence which for tbe past two
years has been raging in tbe countries of the
cast, has recently made its appearance
in European ports with which
we are in constant communication.
The then secretary of tho treasury, in pur
suance ot a proclamation ot the president,
issued certain regulations restricting, and lor
a time prohibiting, tho importation of rags
and tbe admission of baggage of immigrants
and of travelers arriving from infected quar
ters, .uest tuis course uiuy uave oecn witii
out the strict warrant of law, I approve the
recommendation of the present secretary,
tbat congress take action In the premises,
and I also recommend the immediate adop
tion ot tucn measures as win be likely to
ward on the dreaded epidemic and to miti
gate its severity in case it shall unhappily
extend to our shores.
The annual report of the commissioners
of the District of Columbia reviews the op
erations ot tne several ueparunems oi i
municipal government- I ask your careful
consideration of its suggestions in respect to
legislation, and commend such as relate to a
revision of the civil and criminal code, the
performance of labor by persons sentenced
to imprisonment, tho jail, the construction
and occupation of wharves along the river
front and the erection of a suitable building
for district offices.
I recommend tbat in recognition of tbe
services of Ulysses Grant. late general of the
armies of the United States and twice presi
dent of this nstion, congress confer upon
him a suitable pension. I am certain that
the measure seems to me necessary and ex
pedient. I have now in obedience to the consti

as respects others of no less importance.
I shall content myself with reviewing the
without re-stating tbe grounds upon
which such recommendations were based,
tho preservation of the forests on the public
domain, the granting of government aid for
public education, the amendment of the fed
eral comtitution so as to make effective the
disapproval by the president of particular
items in the appropriation bills, the enact
ment of statutes in regard to the filling ot
vacancies in the presidential office, and the
determining of vexed questions respecting
presidential inability, are measures which
may justly reccivo your serious considera
tion. A$ the time draws nigh whenl am to retire
from public service, I cannot refrain from
expressing to the members of the na
tional legislature, with whom I have
been brought into personal and official inter
course, my sincere appreciation of their un
failing cnurteousnesf, of tbeir harmonious
co-operation with the executive in so many
measures calculated to promote the best in
terest of the nation, and to my fellow citi
zens generally, I acknowledge a deep sense
of obligation for the support which tbey
h'ive accorded me in my administration of
the executivo department of the government.

the court house, his speech beingpronounced
one of the best that he ever delivered. He
stopped at the De Barnard hotel, and hid Li
tended leaving for Ft. Smith, Ark., to-day.
After last night's meeting he returned to the
hotel, where he engaged in conversation
with friends until about 11 o'clock, when he
retired to his room, remarking before going
tbat he was not feeling first-rate. This
morning he arose in apparent usual health,
entered the hotel dining room, where ha or
dered breakfast, and was eating rather heart
ily. While waiting for an order to be filled
he suddenly settled back Li his chair,
straightened out his legs, his eyes rolling
back, and expired without a movement of the
muscles sf the face or a long breath. Not a
word escaped his lips. Miss Alma Haynes,
who was seated next to him, sprang to his
relief, and began chaffing his hands and face,
but life had departed almost immediately.
The remains were removed to a house in the
rear of the hot-1, by his friends John Koel-
ler and others, where they have been viewed
by hnndreds of people, both friends and
strangers. The doctors are in some doubt
as to his ailment- Some entertain tLo opin
ion that it was heart disease, others say it
was from blood poison, by u means of a
slow and deadly drug. It is quite probable
an inquest snd post-mortem examination
will be had to day, when other facts may be
brought to light.
There are few men in Kansas or tbe
United States that do not know or have not
heard of Capt. D. L. Payne, of Oklahoma
fame. He served in the Kansas house in 1865,
from Doniphan county. Forycars he has been
the chief of the Oklahoma boomers. He
served in the union army during tho rebel
lion, and has four discharges. lie was also a
member of the Garfield Post.G. A. IU of
Wichita. His funeral will take place Sun
day afternoon at two o'clock from tbe M. E.
church here, the pastor of that organization
officiating.
A worn as to Payne's domestic rela
tions. Years ago be and a Miss Anna
Uavnes formed a mutual attachment for
each other; swore eternal fidelity, and though
without tbe sanction of the' law, have since
then lived as man and wife, and as a fruit of
sucn alliance a son was bora who is now
about fourteen years old. This course was
due to a desire of Pavne, that as soon as the
Oklahoma country should be open, he and
Miss Haynes could each tike a claim,
and as soon as their titlo was secure,
it was their purpose to marry,
but time dragged on and they became car
ried of this half married life, "and determined
to take immediate action in tho matter, in
fact. Miss Haynes accompanied biintu this
city, and was "going with him to Ft- Smith,
where the marriage would be comumated.
But unfortunately this was not to be. Miss
Haynes is a lady, about forty-five, about the
same age of Payne, and is a Very intelligent
and rather motherly appearing woman, and
is nearly heart broken over tbe sudden death
of Payne, to whom she was greatly attached
She has been a great friend to the colonists,
and by tbem u greatly esteemed. The
statement of her and Payne's domestic rela
tions is msde at her suggestion fur the
Eagle's readers. M. Stout.

Loman-Brand Contast.
Chicago, Dec. 1. The United States
grand jury to-day continued its investigation
into the alleged frauds in the second pre
cinct, eighteenth ward, which allegations are
tbat the tally sheet was changed tbe day
after election, taking 200 votes from Lemsn
and giving the same number to Brand. It
is also charged that in order to cover up this
fraud the sealed ballots were takes out of
the county clerk's office, tbat over 200 lie
publican ballots with Leman's name on
tbem, and an equal number of ballots sub
stituted, which contained all Republican
names except Leman's, for which that of
Brand was substituted, and that these
ballots were printed on the night
of November 1st, or nineteen days
after election. Concerning to-day's pro
ceedings of tbe grand jury, tbe Times-Dem
ocrat will to-morrow publish what professes
to be an abstract of testimony given before
the grand iury. The more important fut
ures are here given in substance by Byron
r lsb, a discharged foreman for jr. L. ilans-
com & Co who testified he asked J. C.
Hess, of the press room of the same estab
lishment, about printing the bogus Kepubli
can ticket, and that Hess replied that tbe
Republican tickets with Brand's name on
them were wanted to be put in the
ballot box to elect Brand. J. C.
Thompson, employee of Hanscom Jc Co.,
says that on the afternoon of November 21.
at the request of S. B. Wright, member of
the nrro, be bad an engraver make a fac sim
ile of tbe engraved head of the Republican
ticket- 3. W. Fall, of Baker & Co, en
gravers, tesified as to the execution of an
order which was wanted in a hurry. J. C.
Hess, pressman for Hanscom 4 Co., said the
press work was done by one of tbe boys
who ran presses, and denied the Fisher
statement that he, Hess, said ten tickets were
wanted to elect Brand Papers here have
Jmblished many hints implicating more or
ess prominent citizens and city and county
officials as concerned in or having knowl
edge in actual work of changing ballots and
forging the name of one of the judges to
the bogus tally sheet

Click Interviewed.
St. Locis, Nov. 29. Gov. Glick, who is
a short-horn rattle breeder, as well as chief
executive of Kansas, in an interview with a
repo-ter of the Globe-Democrat on the ac
tion of the cattlemen's convention recently
held in this city, stated tbat the scheme for
the great attle trail from tho Red river to
the north boundry of the country, as marked
out by tbe convention was entirely imprac
ticable, he siid, to be of value. The trail
must be one hundred miles wide instead of
six miles as asked for. Besides, he alleged
that they have no right to a trail through
Kansas or any other state. They now have
a trail through the western part of Kansas,
but tho law establishing it will be repealed
by the legislature this winter, and be also
states that Kansas lost half a million
dollars the past year from Texas fever, but
hereafter there will be a strict quarantine
against Texas cattle established and regula
ted by law, instead of simply by proclama
tion. He disclaimed there 'was any illfeel
ing in Kansas against Texas, but assorted
self-preservation demanded they should pro
tect themselves. He opposed feasing public
lands to ranchmen and favored this as being
to the best interests of the country. lie
thought the veterinary service of the "United
States as now organized is a hnmbug. and
it should be improved by the employment
of the best veterinsries in the country, snd
expressed the belief that the diseae in Kan
sas last spring pronounced by Dr. Salmon
to oe ergotism, was tne ventaoie lool

Otsen Letter.
Chicago, Dec. L An open letter will be
published here to-morrow from Rudolph
Brand, Democratic candidate for state sena
tor from the Sixth district, to nenry W. Le
man, his Republican opponent. Brand says
that while he ran ahead of his ticket else
where and had reason to believe he would
do tbo same in the Second precinct of the
Eighteenth ward, where it is alleged tbo
fraud was committed which" added 200 votes
to Brand's count, yet if Leman's claim
to this effect was true it would
show that he. Brand, ran behind
his ticket in that precinct, still from tho fact
that tbe ballots in the box indicate that Le
man's father-in-law, brother-in-law, and oth
er intimate friends voted for Brand, ha
(Brand) is inclined to the opinion these bal
lots are fraudulent. He therefore proposes
to Lemnn that they jointly canvass tbe rotes
in the entire district and if it is found tbat
ballots of similar character have been de
posited in other, precincts the matter will be
testimony of the voter throughout the dis
trict on the question for whom they voted.
