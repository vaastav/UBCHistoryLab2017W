as follows : -..JOne

slavery Is right and ought to be extended,
while the other believes It wrong and ought
not to be extended. -il
This is the only t-abstantial dispute. Shall

-I From questions of this class spring all our
constitutional controversies, while - decide
them by majorities or minorities. '
. It the minority, will not .acquiesce the ma
jority must, or the , government must cease.
A majority changing . under the clnt views
of popular sentiment is. the : oaly true sov
ereign of a free people. Plainly thg prime
Idea of secession is the 'essence of aaarchy.
There is no alternative for continuing the
government but by acquiescence on the one
side or the other.
I do not forget that, soma assume, consti
tutional questions arc to be decided by the
Supreme Court; nor do I deny their decisions
are binding between the parties in any spe
cific case;' and. while it may be evidently
erroneous in the special case, it can be over
ruled and never become a precedent lor other
cases. ." If decisions in personal' cases should
direct the policy of , government on genearal
vital questions afiec ting : the publie ; rights,
the people would be surrendered to that tribunal
and must cease being rulers ol their own
highest interests. ' Nor Is there .in tiie view
any assault upon the" Court or the Judges. It
is their duty to decide case?, rightly brought
before them, and it is not : ibei r fault, if oth
ers seek to turn their dTWooA f o p clitlcal
uses.' . ; '., ' ", '
'. Physically speaking the. NoitU:aadl South
cannot seperate . their sections from' each
othtr; nor build : an impassable (tariff) wall
between them. Suppose that you, my dis
satisfied countrymen, go to war, yon cannot

the Inaugural, are avowed in his message to
Congress of December 4th, saying, .''My for
mer address to thelcallcd .sesssiou'and my
Inaugural wero both devoted to the insurrec
tion and the consequent, tear, audi nothing has
occurred to add, or subtract from the prin
ciples or general purposes s'ated in those decu
mtnts. - The, Union must be preserved by
every practical means, and we must not hesif
tate, because some measures may reach the
loyal a well as the didoyal. After the cap
ture of Fort Sumter it was 'apprehended that
the rebels wotild derive ', aid from tbeir par
tizans in the North, but noble little Delaware
led off on the right side. - Maryland was made
to assume opposition, but now she has given
6evfn regiments to the Union. ..Kentucky is
uncbangably tight, and Missouri is quieted.
Western Virginia is safe for the. winter, and
so is the section east of the Chesapeake, with
promising ' movements in Tennessee and
western North Carolina. I am desirous that
the inevitable conflict, for closing this eivil
War, should not degenerate into a:remorse
less struggle. P Therefore; I have made the
iKttgrity of the Union proTWient, as the prim--
ary; object of the contest, on cur part, leaving

Besides it is probable 1 that some of the
States (Kentucky, Kanawha and Frankland!)
will pass similar enactments, for their own
benefit, by which . certain' persons will be
thrown cn them for disposal.' I recommend
Congress. to receive all such persons at valu
ation, payable'out of. the direct taxation dej
volving 'on such States respectively; also,
that provision be made for colonizing such
persons, as well as others now in the' North"
ern States, in climates congenial to them;
(viz: Cuba, Jamaica,' Florida and Texas?)
The carrying out the plan of colonization
may involve acquisition of territory as well
as funds. "The power to do so was ques

Louisiana, but commercial expedience settled
the question. ,r r .' J
The removal ef blacks opens homes for

OfGwrsand SoUiei-s of tb Missoui State Guard, anJ
rlkw-Ctizens: , . ' . '
- In the month of June last,' after having
exhausted every honorable means of avert
ing the calamities of civil war, I called upon
the State for 50,000 volunteers to drive the
ruthless bands of hired invaders from our
soil. ' Before making that call, I had asked
that you might have the peivilege of deter
mining at the polls, in a peaceable manner,
your future political relations with the Unit
ed States determined oa my part to abide
that decision, whatever it might be. That
privilege, a right which belong to every
freeman, was denied you. Our enemies
chose to submit to The arbitrament of the
sword, and we accept the issue so boasting
ly tendered us.
There was no alternative left. We had
.either to draw the sword and defend our
rights, or like slaves submit to the worst
despotism on earth. Between these I could
not, and did not hessitate. : I cho?e the form
er, and hence, from that time to the present
grim-visaged war has stalked through the
State, from the Nishneboteno to the St. Fran
cis from the Des Moines to the Necsho, and
in his trail have followed charred walls,
blood stained fields, and desolated homes.
When the circumstances by which we
were surrounded, are considered, it mcst ba
acknowledged that the State responded no
bly to my call ; and to you who left all the
comforts of home, and for six long months
have been enduring all tho hardships, dan.
gars and sufferings of a soldier's life, too
much praise and credit cannot be given.
Patiently have you borne the burning rays
of tho summer's sun, the beating storm,
chilling blasts, aDd sickening hunger pains ;
end nobly have you stood upon the battle
field, mid showering balls, bursting bombs,
and charging horse : yea, more than this,
you have dared the burniag fever, the fever
ed pulse, and risked the solitary grave, with
all of a patriot's faith and.hope. ' "
' These things have you done, lay brave
soldiers, but our work is not complete yet ;
for war, with its horrors aad train of suffer
ings 6till hovers over our beloved State.
We are fighting for liberty, equality and in
dependence, and can never leave the field
while the foot of an enemy shall be left to
pollute our soil. Everything on earth that
renders'lite valuable and dear to a free man
is at stake, and none but the ba?esljs!ave and
craven coward can yield in such a contest.
- Our enemies in the State, though impu
dently and arrogantly asserting that a major
ity of the people are on their side, have, by
their own conduct, given the most indubita
ble evidence that all their claims are fal?e,
or that they themselves 3re too cowardly to
fight their own battles.
..Why, if thy have the majority, did they
import regiment after regiment, brigade af
ter brigade, general after general, from the
ranks of Lincoln's hired hordes in the North
to "fight, their battles in Missouri! Our
friends from the South were never invited
into Missouri until the Lincoln Government
had quartered their Hessian troops all over
the State. These troops thus quartered ia
our midst have been met upon every field,
with few exceptions, by MissourFs sons alone,
and with almost unvaried success. Now,
when we have the assistance of the rich and
powerfal Southern Confederacy, with all her
vast resources, and her gallant sons to stand
by our side, what must be the result? If any
among us have hitherto entertained the idea
that Missouri can be conquered, let them at
once and forever banish the delusion from
their minds. By your own strong arms and
willing hearts and dauntless courage, you
have paesed successfully through the darkest
hour and greatest pet il which can possibly
attend the unholy crusade now being waged
against you. Our enemies must 1 have been
brought to know that a bloody revenge must
and will follow a continuance of our perse
cution. It cannot be supposed that a large
majority of our people are to be driven from
their homes and firesides, and forced to sur
render up the graves of their fathers and their
children to "Northern Invaders.- This can
never be as long as a man can be found or an
arm shall be left . to strike : a blow. Over
whelming numbers may sometimes force . us
to retreat ; circumstances may occasionally
cause us to fall back, but as certain - as God
reigns in Heaven, we will - return "again and
again, until the-last man shall have periFhed
or we sball have' reclaimed our homes.
1 have said, and now repeat1" it, that our
enemies can,-at any moment,-) leave the field
in safety and retire to their homes j whereas
we can never lay down oar "arms without dis
honor, while an enemy shall pollute onr soil
with his unhallowed tread. Honor and pa
triotism alike - forbid . it. - The question for
Missouri to determine Is now resolved into
this single proposition -shall she be the Em
pire State of the. glorious Southern Confede
racy, the bright Btar and peer of Virginia in
the Southern constellation, or shall she igno
miniously submit to the abolition yoke of
Northern -lanaticism, conquered, humbled
and disgraced, forced to remain under a Gov
ernment made tyrannical by fanaticism, dis
graced by its rulers, and contemptible in the
eyes of the world T -. T t
.ivAre there any. o .blind among them as
not to see that the predominant feeling in the
State is with the South? Do they not know
that an overwhelming majority of tho people
will never submit to the rule of an abolition
despotism I Are they-not-aware1 that the
'usurpations of their defunct convention are
almost universally condemned by the people!
If all these things are not well known to
them, wby did the convention at its recent
sitting rescind their ordinance of a former
session, submitting- their high handed usur
pations to a vote of the people for ratifica
tion? 'They ! know, 'and everybody . knows
that the: people would have put their seal
ot condemnation, in thunder tones, upon all
their unholy deeds bad the opportunity been
afforded them. j -
- Bat it is useless now to argue the inter
est or policy of the State; onr enemies, have
chosen to submit them both to the arbitra
ment of the sword .and by the sword tfapy mcst
be settled. There is no reason why we
should shriek from the contest. The Mis
souri State Guard, almost single handed
have fought the armies cf 311 tb? Western
States for more thas six months with unpar
alleled success. Their victories at Cole
Camp, at Carthage, at Oak Hill, Fort Scott,
Lexington, Fredericksburg and Bdnjoat,
cannot fall to inspire the country with re
newed zeal, energy and courage. These
noble and heroic deeds have passed into his
tory, ard will form the brightest page of the
crisis through which onr country is passing.
My brave soldiers now in the field : The
six months for which you were called is now
expiring, and many may desire to return to
their homes. It is natural you should dc?ire
to do eo, but let me beg you not now to tarn
back from the work you have eo nobly be
gun; do not new fail when the eyes of the
whole country- are upon you; do not loose
your glorious reputation for want of a little
more patience; do not let the princely heri
tage of Missouri be lost to you and your
children, when a few more weeks or -days of
perseverance may win it for you. Le't me
therefore entreat you lo embrace the oppor
tunity which is now offered ycu to volunteer
in the service of that great younp: govern
ment the Southern Confederacy, cne tl the
brilliant stars of which is our own lovt.-d
Missouri, and fight under, that bright iljg
which has as yet known no defeat.
. That the bond of Union between Missouri
and her southern sisters may be perlect, and
that encouragement be given our men. aud
that system and unity of purpose txict,
which ensures success, it has been determin
ed that the present members of the Missouri
State Guard shall hive the liberty to it-organize
under the laws of the Southern Con
federacy that our southern brothers may
have the privilege of supplying our vrants
and paying our troops, while we fight our
battles which are also theira. Do not let
the frosts of winter deter you from embrac

to remain as quiet tpectators, tilling your

not know that abseenee from the field but
prolongs the war, and that you are at all

that '"he who is not for us is against us !"
You know as well as I that the people of
Missouri are southern people that their
sympathies, their hopes and their interests
are with the South. Then I call upon yoa,
in the name of our noble State, now strug
gling for independence, to come out and help
your brothers who ara ia the field. You
cannot ask or expect them to do all the fight
ing, to endure all the hardships, and divide
with you their glory and successes, you
should not expect to enjoy the reward unless
you participate in their struggles and priva
tions for victory and independence.

' You have read our Governor's appeal. How
do you respond ! Will not the brave men
who have done so much work, and gained m
much credit during the past six months, rally
around the flag he so beautifully describes,
and maintain the reputation which our friends
so kindly award to us? Come, all speak at
once! and let your thundering voices strike
terror to the hearts of those who think wo
can be conquered, or who think the hardship
we have passed through have chilled our pa
triotism, or changed our principles,
v .1 will bs with you, through .weal or woe,
and the authorities will give me such position
as you. desire ; whether it be among yon with
my musket on my shoulder, or at your head,
leading you as I have done, will be ..as you
may wish, so do not hold back on my ac
count. . J. ,
Our commanding generals hate promised
me that I may keep th e field, all winter, and
not be peuned up behind embankments. I
will.be allowed to roam through onr district,
wherever I may be needed, and I-have per
mission, that "whenever I see. a head, I may
hit it." . ' . - . .:. -' :
I have told them that your r brave hearts
shall be my breastwork?, and. a fair Geld and
clear sky my fork v ', ' 1 i
" I have ample preparations' to clothe and
equip all who may; enlist, and on the day
mentioned in my general order No 62, I will
expect you. Citizens from other States, who
desire to serve with us, will be welcomed.
