Looking Under the Ped.
It is the habit of ninny persons to taVe
a look under tho bed Itcfor retirin tor
the night. Mrs. Evergreen, niy l4'uved
wife, indulges, if indulgence it can be call
ed, in this peculiar practice. I do not ob
ject to it in the least, ho long an he does
not entcrce the performance upon myself,
but when, as in sometimes ' the case, she
fureta it until ho has put out the light
and ensconsed herself under the comfort
er, then it is hard that I, who am not
troubled with nervous apprehensiveness,
should have to get out in the cold and do
U for her. I have often remarked to Mrs.
Evergreen, when I have seen her prying
under the bed, that U was a silly habit,
and that the sooner she gave it up the
better. To this gentle admonition my
better half invariably rejoins:
"La, Evergreen ! what harm does It do ?
It's a kind of satisfaction to know that
nobody's under there, nnd then I don,t
think of such a horrible thing after I'm in
bed,"
'I think, toy tlear? yon might just as
well pursue your investigation further
and look into the bureau drawers and
the clothes basket 1'
'.Evergreen' she will rejoin, 'don't men
tion tho idea, or I shall certainly do so.
Come to think of it, a man could very
easily get into the clothes-basket I'
'Certiiiuly he could, mv dear, quite as
easily as FalstafK You should certainly
include the clothes-basket, and, by-the-by,
there's the chimney ; why not look up
that as well V
Now, Evergreen, you're laughing at
me. But I can't leave off the habit, aud
I never will, It' a comfort for mo to
know that there's nothing wrong about
it, and I dou't see why you should deprive
me of it.
So under the bed goes the candle, and
no signs of humanity being discovered,
Mrs. Evergreen is able to repose in
peace. But, as already observed, this
precautionary act is sometimes forgotten;
and 1 am myself obliged to rise, light the
lamp, and report. I've done it rather
more frequently of late than is agreeable,
and have intimated its much to Mrs. E.
She says:
'Very well, Evergreen, I'll do it nv I.f
But this proceedure is almost equally
as bad,- for she invariably lets the cold in
on me both in getting out and getting in.
If it were not for increasing this mental
idiosyncrasy on the part of Mrs. Ever
green, by giving her some good reason to
apprehend danger, I should relate to her
what I am about to lay before the reader.
In this narration, therefore, I ask the pul
)io most particularly to bear in mind that
Mrs. Evergreen i of a sensitive nature,
rather apprehensive aud slightly stiper
stitious, and that what I have to say,
must, under no circumstances, be told
again. If for two-and-twenty years(that
is tho period of our wedded fife, and hap
py years have thoy been) it I sY, I have
for this long period refrained from im
parting the matter to tho beloved sharer
of my joys and partaker of my sorrows,
surely the public (wlticlt, as wo know,
always does keep a secret) will keep mine.
All young men, I suppose, liave love
affairs Defore they eventually fix their af
fections on the oue w ho is to bless their
lot in life, '. I know that I hud, and I don't
regret it. Ilcgret it ? far from it. Mrs.
Evergreen is not present, aud therefore I
have no hesitation in saying that if I had
my life to live over ngaiu I'd like to go
through with the same sentimental ex
perience, particularly it it was to b suc
ceeded again by leading to the hy menial
alter the present Mrs. Evergreen.
I was not bad-looking when I was in
my twenties, I think I may go further,
and confidentially say that M-Jus Ever
green' was a decided favorite among the
girls of Oakvillc, and I really believe that
I could have had any of them 'for the ask
ing.' Aa I bofore remarked, Mrs, Ever
green is not present, and I indulge my
thoughts somewhat more freely than
would otherwise be tho case. I don't
think that I cared particularly fbr any of
the Oakville girls, however, and t might
have kept wy heart whole to this day if
it had not teen for the oircumstauces
which I am about to relate.
Fred Evans, who had been my chum
at school, came to make me a visit at Oak
ville for 'a day or two,' as he said, when
he came, but he made it a week or two
easily enough after I had taken, him about
a littla among the "young ladies.' When
that timo had expired Fred said he really
must go, as ho didn't know what his fa
ther and mother would think of his long
ahacnce; but it ended in his relieving
their anxiety by a letter and sending for
his trunks. I knew how the matter was,
perfectly well, and that Belle Uronson
had bewitched him out ofhja five senses.
Fred used to put it on to the 'country air
and the quiet which was benefitting his
health,' Ac,, but it was no use trviug to
deceive me, and ItoJd him so. ' Then he
owned up frankly, and I promised to help
him all 1 could, if he required any help
in the prosecution of hit suit I never
thought Belle a flirt, or thai ta would
wilXngly (tistrees ay human, tamer, ; Lh4
6he kid ft war c( looking n. ftp s f y w
.'' '!. ' 1!-. ; .
as if to captivate them for her mcrf pe-
sonal amusement.
At any rate sho lind a larger . share of
beaux than the other girls, but all their
attentions camo to nothing. I feared it
might bo so with b red Evans and warned
him accordingly; but Fred said he'd
have her if he tried all his llfo ; that 'with
out her life was naught to him ; that 'she
was the only living tieiiifj who hud ever
awakened a real emotion tu his breast, tte.,
bc.' After that I said no more,but close
ly observed the lovers, and soon came to
the conclusion that Fred was by no means
disagreeablo to her. Things went on in
tins way without any definite results un
til Fred received a sudden summons home
on account of his mother's illness,. 'When
lie came back to renew his visit he insist
ed upon staying at tho Oakville Hotel
rather than wear out his welcome at our
house, and finding remonstrances unavail
ing, there he went. The (landlord honest
old Dowosbury I wonder if he yet lives)
gave Fred, at my suggestion, his best
iteurooni, vo 2U' I am particular in
mentioning the number, 'lie shall have
No, Q' said Hownsbury. Any friend of
yours, master Augustus, shall have the
best that I can give as long's I'm land
lord.' It was a pleasant room, lookins
out on the distant hills and the beautiful
winding branch of the Black water ; but
M'hat cared Fred for scenery? lie wns in
the hands of the blind god, and could not
see evcu as far as his nose, except in the
direction of Belle's cottage. I used to
go over to Fred's room aud smoke my
cigar, while he, poor wretch, expatiated
on his suflferiiigs, doubts an 1 solicitudes.
Did she love hun ? that was the question
which disturbed everv moment of his ex-
pitence, nnd to which, with tho closest
easoning, he could not bring himself a
satisfactory reply. Sometimes he thought
a word or a sitru settled the point be-
i'ond a doubt in his favor, and at others
te fancied ho saw a coolness and indiffer
ence in her eyes. In this condition of un
certainty he dared not press the question
lest a hasty step might bring him to grief.
At Fred s earnest solicitation I prom
ised to sound Belle as to her sentiments,
if a favorable opportunity presented itself,
or at anvrate to let her know, in an indi
rect way, that Fred was languishing in
distress on her account, and thus give her
no excuse for unnecessarily prolonging
his misery, t so happened, however,
that my services were not called into re
quisition. Belle Bronson, because of the
sudden arrival at her house of some coun
try cousins, was obliged to give np her
room and to occupy for a single night a
room at the hotel. Wo would cheerful
ly have offered her guests accommoda
tions at our house, but Ave were in the
same predicament. An, aggricultural fair
in the village had brought many stran
gers to the place, and Our guests were so
numerous that I had given up my room
to two of them, and had intended asking
Fred Evans to let mo pass the night with
him.
For this purpose I went to the hotel at
a late hour, and proceeded at once to
Fred's room but to my surprise found no
one there. I did not even notice that the
trunk was gone, or suspect the fact,
which afterwards became apparent, that
'to oblige some lady friend for this night
only,' as the landlord expressed it, Fred
had consented to give up Ao. 20, and oc
cupy a small room in the rear of the
building, 7 lie gas being turned up, I
took a book to await his return, and hear
ing at last what appeared to be steps aj)
proaching the room, and sujiposing it to
be Fred, in a momentary impulse to play
a joke on him, I slipped under tho bed, a
lnnre and high one, intending to imitate
a cat (of which animal I knew he had a
detestation) as soon as he entered the
room, I he door, opened, and I was on
the point of indulging in my ventriloquial
faculty by giving a long drawn mieoirt
when' from my hiding-place I beheld
Belle Bronson take quiet posscssiou of
the apartment !
flly nstonisumcnt was so great, ana
the sentie of mortification so intense, that
I did not, as 1 should have done, make
myself immediately known to her. Thus
the opportunity for discovery and explan
ation was lost. I dared not move a hair,
but hoped sincerely that some excuse
might take her out of the room for a mo
ment, and so facilitate my escape. She,
howerer, locked the door, removed the
key, nnd, as I knew by the sound, pre
pared to retire. Finally she kneeled
down beside the bed, and clasping her
hands and bowing her head (so tearfully
near to mine that I could hear tho soft
words in my very ear), she offered up her
evening prayer in a manner so full of feel-
1 '.1 1. L 4 . ..!
ing, anil wtui such sweet accents oi wo
manly tenderness and devotion; that I
felt as if she woe an angel bending over
the vilest of mortals.. That prayer went
to my h art; but oue portion went through
it and held it captiyo. Never shall I for
get my feelings of surprise and deep emo
tion, when I heard her utter these words:
'Bless my dear mother, sisters ami friends;
bless all around mc, anil, O God, bless
him I love, Augustus Evergreen, and
shower down thy mercies over him. A
men.' 'Ah, Augustus,' said my divinity
to herself, as she rose from her devotion
al attitude, if you but knew that I named
your very namo in my prayers, you
would be less indifferent to me,' .
If I breathed short before, after this
my breath seemed to desert me entirely,
and I verily thought that tho beating of
my heart would betray me. Belle, pure
as an angel to me then, and white as a
snow-flake, proceeded to turn off the gas
and get into bod, I felt her soft pressure
over my head, and shrunk closer and
closer to the hard floor upon which I was
extended. What thoughts rushed through
my brain! ahovo me lay a young unso
phisticated girl wholly unconscious that
the ne she loved lay so closely to her,
and who had for the first time been made
awaro of her interest in. him, by hearing
words which sho supposed went only to
Heaven! I knew then that the night
must pass away, and the morning come,
and that Belle muM first leave the apart
ment before I uld venture to change
even my position. , '
Belle had laia jserfectly motionless for
sevwai minutes and was, I flattered my
self, losing therself in sleep, when sudden

Safe! safe I whispered my soul to nie,
nnd I thanked God in silence for mv de
liverance. Belle groped back to bed. but
ditl not immediately get in; she atooui
and lifted the Curtains which hung around
the bottom and cautiously passed her
arm under and around as far as it could
reach. I almost felt her finirera crrazo mv
face aa I hold myself fearfully and silent
ly mien against the wall, too far, just too
far for her reach. Apparently satisfied
that no danger was near her, she lav
down in the bed again, and I counted her
respiration till she was lost in slumber.
As for myself, sleep was utterly out of
the question. I never was so wide awake
in my lifo. How I layed upon that hard
carpet and thought the uivjlit out 1
thought of myself and my love fur her.
Yes, I was convinced front that moment
that the hand of destiny was i it, and
that a benign anil all-wise- Providence
had seen tit iu this e.trao.nlin-rv w;vy to,
open my eyes to the path, of uappincss
and peace.
With tho morning light ftesh fears
came upon me lest my unconscious room
mate might yet peer beneath the bed for
robbers before bIic left the room, but my
fears were groundless. She rose and
dressed expeditiously, for she was to join
her cousins at an early breakfast, and she
had overslept herself. AVhen at last she
took the key, unlocked the door and de
parted, I lost no time in slipping out of
my concealment and escaping from the ho
tel. On the stairs I met Fred coming out
of his room, who exclaimed:
' YY hy what s the matter with von. old
fellow ? You look like the last days of
an ill-spent life. And your cuat, too
why it s all aver feathers and dust.

'Why, I slept slept out last night.

make up your mind to hear something
excessively disagreeable. It must be

' Good heavens, Gus ! how earnest you
look at me; you don't mean to say that
that anything has happened to Belle

'Don't mention her namo again, Fred,
or think of her any more, tor site If never

But i red Evans was absent from the
country, and I did not sec hint again for
several years, when, meeting him iu
town one day, I insisted pji bringing him
homo with me and presenting him to his
old flame, Bollo Broiison the present
Mrs. Evergreen.
1 Ah, Gus r said he, after dinner, when
my wife aud the little Evergreeus jiad
left us to ourselves 'Ah, Gus, you served
mc a shabby trick when you allowed me
to lose my heart to the girl you were
all along intending to marry yourself a
very sliabby trick, one of which I never
suspected you!'
So I had to tell him (in stric t confi

alout the bed-room affair at the Oakville

Meeting of the Thirty-ninth Congress.
THINGS AT WASHINGTON.
Not having had timo or space lust week for
uliuniou to lliu opening of Congress, that duty
is now attended to, though the day is rut her
lute. To those depending on their weekly lo
cal paper for a synopsis of these proceedings,
a little tardiness will not, ucrlmp, be fuUl to
appetite.
The second session of the thirtv-niuth
Congress commenced at ashmgtou
Monday, at noon, a large proportion of
the members of both Houses being pres
ent. The president's message was prompt
ly presented and read, the motion of fluid
Steveus to postpote the reading in the
House to the next dav being voted down.
fter the reading of the message tho wel
come to Congress had tu bo attended to
and the House proceeded to the cast bal
cony to see the procession, aud to listen
10 me speecn oi weicouw vy uttge ar
ter and tho reply by Speaker Colfax,
which m us in his best vein. Iu the eve
ning thero was a banquet generally attend
ed by the radical republicans, and more
speeches of welcome were made and an
swered. The House - also found time on
the first day of tho session to pass a bi!l
repealing the section of the act of July
1802, authorizing the president to gift.it
pardon and amnesty, which was put
through on motion of Mr. Eliot of Mass.
The Senate refuses to pass the bill till it
ha9 been the regnlar rouud of the com
mittee. Its passage will effect but little,
as the opiuion is entertained that the
president has power under the constitu
tion alone to pardon offenders before as
well as after convic tion. Both branches
resolve to keep the joint reconstruction
committee of last session, and the J louse
has determined to have a standing com
mittee ou freedmen' affairs. The lower
branch has also passed a resolution iutdbt-
ing on the adoption of the coustituuonal
amendment, before the admission of south
ern members to congress, and another in
structing ihQ ctuwnu ca twiUorks to
inquire info the expediency of providing
territorial governments for the rebel
states, Tlte hou has likewise passed a
hill reported by Mr. Lawrence of Ohio,
providing that when a loyal ritiaer of the
U. S. brings an action to recover dama
ges for injury to person or property, no
such action shall be defended, or any de
terve allowed by virtue of the authority
of the late so called confederat e states, or
any state declared in rebellion. A good
deal of work has been laid out for the f'u
ture. The house began under high pres.
sure, and bills have already been introdu
ced to regulate the executive appoint
ments; to establish a new bureau in the
treasury department, to be called the in
ternal revenue bureau, the head of it to
be appointed by Ihe chief justice to have
a salary of 5,000, and to have the nit
pointing of his own subordinates ; direct
ing the sale of 2,000,OQQ of gold every
week by the secretary of the treasury, tit
N. Y., due notice to be given, ami the
compensation to the broker selling it not
to exceed l-50th of one per cent ; to e
qualie tho.bouiity of soldiery sudors and
marines; nnd Mr. Lawrence has tlv, ear
ly tried to get the house to repudiate the
action of last session increasing pay of
members," & to get a bill before thu house
red.uci'Ag mileage. Iu the Senate Mr.
Sumner made an ineffectual attempt the
first d:ty to pass the bill that went thro'
the hoivje last session, establishing im;tar
tial 8u11'rtu;e in the District. J hit this is
oue of the things that cannot be put
down. Mr. Sumner has also introduced
a scries of resolutions asserting the right
of congress over reconstruction, denying
tho right of the lately rebellious states to
pass upon constitutional amendments,
and declaring that the interference of the
president, iu the work of reconstruction
partakes of the nature of usurpation.
Mr Wade urged to take up the joint resolution
rendering I lie president ineligible tor a rc-elec-ti'in,
ana spoke of the growing danger of giving
one man n lung lease oi power; hut the resolu
tion wus refetrud lo ;i eoniaittee without aetion.
The t;per brunch has adopted a rc-oiuiion call
