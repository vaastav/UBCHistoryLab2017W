Senator Cullom of Illinois who Is to be
the successor of the late Senator Dals
of -Minnesota as chairman of the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations created n prece
dent In the executive session of the Sen
ate yesterday by reading a prepared type
written speech in support of the pending
Ilay rauncrfote canal treaty Cxccuthc
Bastion speeches have always heretofore
been extemporaneous for the one very
good reason If for no other they are not
recorded Senator Culloms effort there
fore will never sec the light of day unless
the Senate should remove the Injunction
of secrecy on It and as this would be cre
ating another precedent the Senate being
a body which much rrefers to break
rather than make precedents Is not likely
to do It
Approved Hi- air Cullom
Mr Cullom endorsed the trcatythrough
ont It Is Just exactly the treaty that
the Senate had been clamoring for he
said and places the ownership and con
trol of the canal entirely In the hands of
the United States Government
England is not a party to the bargain
so far as the control of the canal Is con
cerned Mr Cullom said nnd he added
that he v culd be for the treaty even If It
were lcs open to criticism than It is
of the overpowering Importance of
pa og the way for the construction of
the canal He said there was no force
in the criticisms of the new pro
vision Article IV that no change of
territorial sovereignty ehall affect tho
general principle of neutralization or tho
obligation of tho contracting parties to
the treaty because tbo United States
Avould stand good for Its bargain under
whatever changed conditions might de
velop In the future
Sir Tlnconfi Objections
Senator Bacon one of the two Demo
cratic members of the Forelcn Relations
Committee who voted against reporting I with
the treaty made a long speech express- j
lng general dissatisfaction with the terms I
of the treaty which he said were no
better and should bo no more acceptable
to the Senate than those of the rejected
convention Mr Bacon has made some
talk of offering the so called Davis
amendment with regard to the specific
powers of the United States to fortify tho
canal but has finally decided not to do
this and will not make any further effort
to amend or defeat the treaty
Take tlie Vole Todnj
Senator Lodge in charge of the treaty
was told yesterday by Senator Jones the
leader -of tho Democratic minority that
ho saw no reason why a vote should not
be taken today and It is possible that
this may bo done This is not certain
however for there are a few Senators In
cluding Mr Tillman of South Carolina
who are not entirely satisfied with the
treaty and rather think It Is their duty
to stir up a tow about It Senator Money
of Mississippi a member of the Foreign
Relations Committee will make a speech
today In opposition So far as Is known
no other Senator desires to speak so that
a vote may possibly be taken Immediately
thereafter
The Democrats who are most out
spoken In their opposition to tho treaty
are Baron Money Culberson and Till
man The first two however will prob
ably not vote at all as they are so anx
ious they say to have a canal built that
they dislike to go on record as putting
even the slightest obstacle In Its way
Host tbe Senate Mnmla
The Republican Senators will probably
all vote for ratification and It Is likely
that their votes added to those of tho
Democrats who will follow the lead r
Senator Morgan of Alabama and support I
the treaty will bring tho total affirmative
vote to upward ot sixty which Is of
course more than a iuf3clnt two thirds
ot eighty eight the total membership of
the Senate at precnt The opposition
Tote Is not likely to number moro than
tw cnty
Mr- Culberson in voicing his opposi
tion raises the point that the new treaty
retains In spirit at least section 8 ot the
Clayton Bulwcr Treaty which makes
Great Britain a partner of the United
States In the control of the canaL
The reply of Senator Lodge In charge
of the treaty Is that Mr Culberson Is en
tirely mistaken and that If he Is right he
Mr Lodge would vote against the treaty
himself as he Is Just as much opposed to
taking England into partnership with the
United States as Mr Culberson or any
of her f mater poEslbly can be

she went leaving the dead or dying be

Mr Taggart In commenting on her sub
sequent actions told the Jury ho consid
ered Mrs Boalne the most extraordinary
woman he had ever heard of In view of
the Indifference she had manifested to
ward the tragedy Never at any time
has she manifested In manner shape or
form regret at the death of this unfor
tunate man I tell ou she Is without
heart or eonsclence
She was n vcr In a struggle with him
It Is a misnomer to term what happened
in that room a struggle She stood off
pointing the pistol at him Call It by Its
proper name assassination Thats what
it was and nothing less Mr Taggart
whirled bis arms around defiantly in tbe
direction of tho defendant as ho con
cluded
Mr IrtlfiinN rKnmcnt
Mr 1iiHon then commenced his address
to the Jury He gained their good will at
the Jump in- telling them he would not
drtitii them long All of them -bad been
casting furtive glances at the clock dur
ing -the latter part of Mr Taggarts
speech
We lavc here a frail creature ar
raigned on the eharre of murder I want
you to consider Iu this respect that the
regard for human life has ever grown
stronger slnco God said Thou shalt not
kill Men dont so wantonly play with
human life as to blot it out forever
unless they hao somo reason that ani
mates and controls
According to the Governments theory
Mrs Bonine who Is now on trial for her
life commiltecd ruurdcr after living a
stainless life for thirty four years Dur
ing that time she has so conducted her
self that she has Impressed every one
who ever met her by her sweetness and
sympathy And -ct we see this kind
hearted woman suddenly charged with
taking human life It is so far from hu
man nature and what wo expect to find
In a woman like her
We will now turn to the night In ques
tion Ayres returned to his room from
his baccahanallan rot els The next we
hear of him Is from the lips of the ac
cused
Ayres Xot the ABcressnr
Mr Fulton depicted the dead man as a
blackguard who endeavored to take ad
vantage ot a married womans platonic
Interest In him
He had noticed her maternal Interest
In him when she persuaded him not to
drink He was going to leave the Ken
more and thought she cared more for him
than her actions really meant Therefore
he determined to get her to his room and
find out He was In his room between 15
and 1 oclock revolving this project In
his mind
In a measure he was under the Influ
ence of liquor We all know that such
stimulation arouses the baser passions of
men i bis young mans brain was stained
impure thoughts
much she cared for tho sick he went to
her room wl a that for an excuse Wo
all know that sho had retired for the
night W had it from the lips of her
coy Does that looK as if sho was plan
ning murder
When Ayres was makir g his plans
against her honor what was she doing
asked Mr Fulton Dreaming porsibly
of her boy in tbo next room or cf her
half blind husband and the da she
pledged blm her heart and hand And so
the destroyer came Ho played the role
of being sick knowing how quick she was
to respond In such an emergency
Xlie Proiiecntlon Defied
Counsel denied the Governments con
tention that she permitted Ayres to take
liberties or that sho made any especial
preparations In her dress when sho went
to his room defying the prosecution to
produce such evidence
Gentlemen It was a very Indiscreet
thing for her to do admitted Mr Ful
ton He added impressively We are
not trying her for indiscretion for doing
something your wife or mine might do
Innocently You are here to determine
whethor she killed Ayres with mallco
aforethought You are not to take any
bodys theory You must take the evi
dence
The Governments theory Is that alia
went up the fire escape through the win
dow and shot Ayres in cold blood If
that theory Is so It was murder dia
bolical What was tho motive Murder Is
done for robbery revengo Jealousy or
tho concealment of crime
Mr Fulton said the Government bad
failed to show her cither Jealous or re
vengeful and had not submitted the
slightest clement of proof to show that
she had ever yielded to cither of those
passions
But they ask you he protested to
not only convict her of murder but ot
everything that smacks of Infidelity It
Is Just as reasonable to ask you to con
vict her on tbo theory of robbery as
Jealousy or revenge
Can you unon your oaths as Jurors
sworn to return a verdict based upon the
evidence reader a verdict of guilty
The lawyers sonorous voice rang out In
warning as lie in the next few words de
fined the position of tho lefence
Sbe Is cither guilty of murder or noth
ing If she be guilty of murder you must
convict her But she 1b not Thero was
a note of triumph in his volco here
And you must turn her loose from the
clutches of the law Give her back once
more to the bosom of her family nfter
six months In a prison under a most ter
rible suspicion
Mr Fulton announced here that It was
getting late and he would defer the rest
of bis argument until today Court was
then adjourned

well that others besides newspaper men

the up-to-date New York Croker article
On Monday evening a well dressed

to Interview him on national politics but
he declined to discuss questions of that
character and waved them all aside with
the statement that ho had come to In

He condescended to say though that
tho Democrats will win next ear and
this was regarded as the statement of an
oracle and was accepted without question
Tho man answered blandly to the name of
