So Ions as the American people do their
own work they miy expect a fair degree of
prosperity.
Many will fail to sec any merit la the tax

vided he can ray $3.
It ßlay bo remarked to those Democrats
who are denouncing the Kansas City plat
form that it la the latest and therefore
the binding expression of Democratic prin
ciples, and will continue to be such until
the next Democratic national convention.
The House rules, concerning which eo
many Democrats arc making themselves
unhappy, are practically the same which
were In force during the two Congresses
of lSül and 1S93, when the House waa Dem
ocratic. They are, however, of Republican
origin.
It may not be In conflict with the Con
stitution for the Senate to originate a
Philippine tariff act, but if such an act
touches the revenues of the United States
'it seems a violation of that clause of tha
Constitution which declares that all reve
nue bills shall originate in the House.
When it Is recalled that the area of In
diana Is about Ct,(M) square miles, the pos-
iblilty of the reclamation of th 1,000,000
square hOs of arid lands is a bewildering
contemplation. Liven If half of the arid
lands can be redeemed they would make
twenty-two States of the area of Indiana.
The New York Chamber of Commerce
seem to be in favor of reciprocity without
any mental reservations to make it inop
erative. The trouble with the recent na
tional reciprocity convention was that it
wanted the reciprocity all on one side.
Its members were "in favor of the law, but
ag'ln Its enforcement."
Those Illinois Republicans who are re
ported by Chicago papers to have gone to
"Washington to Interest tho President in
their schemes to elect a senator and con
trol the party in that State are too stupid
for practical politics If they have not yet
learned from the President that there will
bo no administration candidates.
Some members of Congress express them
selves as willing to help Cuba in every
way possible, but they do not see how
there; can be any legislation by Congress
until tho Cuban government is organized
and ready to negotiate a reciprocity treaty.
There Is force in that view. At present
there Is no government with which to ne
gotlate.
One of the arguments used In favor of
the enactment of a special tariff law for
the Philippines Is that Congress ought not
to delegate its authority in such matters
to the President, who Is now acting
through the Taft commission. The Presi
dent only acts by virtue of military law
and on general principles. Congress should
bring military rule In the Islands to an end
as soon as possible.
The last attempt of tho enemies of the
fchemc to build the Southern Railroad is
to circulate a report that the managers
would ask Center township to vote a sub
eldy. The projectors of the enterprise cm
phatically deny any such intention, and
this denial should put an end to the story.
It may be added that the men interested
in the work assured the Journal, months
ago, that they would not ask for a subsidy.
The suggestion of Senator Hoar that all
who profess belief in anarchism throughout
tho Trorld be banished to an Island from
which they could not escape may not be
practicable, but if an Island can be found
It might be tried, to the end that the ex
periment of a people living without gov
ernment night bo witnessed. Tho prob
ability- la that tho efforts of the banished
would bo directed to finding methods of
escaping from a spot where there was no
protection for life and property.
The Atlanta Constitution dally dilates up
on the marvelous prosperity of Georgia,
but now and then It raises a cry against
the combinations which are robbing tho
people and demands a second Andrew
Jackson to suppress them. The two state
ments are conflicting, since if Georgia is
prosperous beyond measure the oppression
of the trusts is r.ot effective. The incon
sistency is explained by the fact that in
the midst of prosperity something must be
done to keep a little 'courage In the Demo
cratic party.
General Lew Wallace contributes the
first article to the- current issue of the
North American Reiew, which Is devoted
to consideration cf rn;thV.s necessary to
eliminate the Anarchist, or to prevent the
ssasrlnatloii oj' Prsuints. Ilo dees not
ttiiik Ü4 Constitution confer sufficient
authority to extirpate anarchy. Conse
quently, ho would extend the provision of
the Constitution denning treason against
the United States by adding the felonious
ly taking or attempting to take the life of
a President. Agitation, conspiracy or or
ganization to subvert the government of
the United States or to hinder or obstruct
Its operation shall be treasonable, and for
the suppression of such acts Congress
shall have power to do whatever it may
Judge requisite. These extensions of the
Constitution General Wallace believes
necessary, even If this government should
unite with other powers for the oblitera
tion of anarchy. That Is, General Wal
lace does not agree with the President,
ex-Minlster Harris and others that the
United States has not authority, under
the Constitution as it now stands, to unite
with other powers' to treat anarchy as
they have treated the slave trade and pira
cy on the high seas.
Till! xcw HAV-PAL'NCEFOTE
TUB AT Y.
Tho new Hay-Pauncefote treaty, which
has Just been tent to the Senate, marks
a new triumph for American diplomacy.
and this regardless of whether it shall
be ratified or not. By its terms it does away
with the CJayton-Bulwer treaty, which has
been the cause of so much friction during
the last forty years, and concedes all that
the United States has contended for under
that treaty, and which Great Britain has
courteously but stubbornly refused to ad
mit. By that treaty tho United States and
Great Britain both declared "that neither
the one nor the other will ever obtain or
maintain for itself any exclusive control
over tho said ship canal," meaning the Nic
aragua canal. At different times and in
various ways during ttie last forty years
the United States has tried to escape the
binding force of this provision without suc
cess. Now Great Britain yields it. The
new treaty provides for the abrogation of
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, and says:
It Is agreed that the canal may be con
structed under the auspices of the gov
ernment of the United States, either di
rectly at its own cost, or by the gift or
loan of money to individuals or cori-ora-tions,
through subscription to or purchase
of stock or shares, and that under the
provisions of said treaty tha said govern
ment shall have and enjoy all the rights
Incident to such construction, as well as
the exclusive rls'ht of providing for the
regulation and management of the canal.
This gives the United States a free hand
to construct and the exclusive right to
regulate and manage the canal as this gov
ernment may see fit. The exclusive right
to regulate and manage the canal covers
everything relating to rates, tolls, operat
ing, etc. The only condition is that in
time of war as in peace the canal shall be
free and open to the vessels of all nations
on terms of entire equality, and that the
United States shall maintain this condition
of neutrality. The Clayton-Bulwer treaty
declared that "neither the United States
nor Great Britain will ever erect or main
tain any fortifications commanding the
said canal, or in the vicinity thereof." The
new treaty says: "The United States shall
be at liberty to maintain such military po
lice along the canal as may be necessary to
protect it against lawlessness and dis
order." The United States Is made the sole
judge as to the amount or kind of military
police necessary to protect the canal against
lawlessness and disorder, as well as to
maintain its neutrality. The Hay-Faunce-fote
treaty of last year, which provoked
considerable discussion and which was not
ratified by the Senate, contained a provi
sion that "no fortifications shall be erect
ed commanding the canal, or the waters
adjacent." In the present treaty that pro
vision is omitted. With that exception the
presont treaty is practically identical with
the ono of last year, except that it places
the guarantee of the canal's neutrality in
the hands of the United States alone, in
stead of giving Great Britain equal power
and authority in the matter. The conspicu
ous omission of the provision regarding for
tifications would seem intended to leave
the United States to adopt any measure
deemed necessary to protect or operate
the canal and to maintain Its neutrality.
As Great Britain doubtless insisted on the
insertion of the anti-fortification provision
in the original Hay-Pauncefote treaty, its
omission in the new one is a triumph for
American diplomacy, as Is also the change
In the article providing for maintaining the
neutrality of the canal. These changes are
material, and they concede all that the
United States can reasonably ask. If the
present treaty is not ratified by the Senate
the Clayton-Bulwer treaty will still be
in force and hard to get rid of.
TAMMAXVS BID FOR LEADERSHIP.
The resolutions which so nearly threw
tho members of the House Democratic
caucus into convulsions a week ago turn
out to bo tho platform upon which the
leaders of Tammany propose to go before
the country with Mr. Edward M. Shepard,
their defeated candidate for mayor, as
leader. It was not known that the resolu
tions were written by Mr. Shepard and
cordially indorsed by the Tammany lead
ers, Including Richard Croker. Even Mr
McClellan, who presented them, did not
seem to think it necessary to assert that
Tammany spoke in the resolutions which
terrified the caucus. A week has disclosed
the fact that Tammany Hall proposes to
takfc a hand in directing the Democratic
party in the country, and that Mr. Shepard
Is its leader and lawgiver. The resolu
tions are official notice to the Democratic
party that Tammany Hall, which the
Sentinel so severely denounced the morn
ing after Mr. Shepard's defeat in New
York city, has arisen from its defeat to
take the position of leadership. Edward
M. Shepard will be Tammany's leader In
New York, and Tammany's war upon
David B. Hill will be kept up.
Mr. Shepard, the author of the resolu
tions, seems to realize that the trouble
with the Democratic party in recent years
has been that it has had too many conflict
ing principles. Mr. Bryan and ex-Senator
Turpie Insisted that the Chicago platform
of lsC'6 was tho genuine article, while ex
President Cleveland and the late Senator
Palmer, of Illinois, declared that that plat
form was a bundle of heresies. Mr
Shepard seems to be aiming at getting rid
of the two kinds of Democratic principles
advocated by Mr. Bryan and ex-President
Cleveland and getting together upon issues
concerning which Democrats can have no
fundamental dispute. This may seem an
easy thing to do, but the consternation
into which the reading of the resolutions
embracing the Shepard remedy for party
cohesion threw the caucus a week ago can
not be regarded as encouraging for the
Tammany leaders. There is fresh reason
to believe that the number of Democrats
who adhere to thlKansas City platform Is
larro and potentl.&J Besides, a larsre Dart
of the Democracy in the West and South Is
hostile to Tammany and will not accept
its leadership. If Mr. Shepard and the
Tammany leaders were in earnest to brins
the party together on the Shepard platform
they would" have tried to secure the serv
ices of a Democrat from the South or West
to present It. The reorganization of the
Democratic party by a Tammany leader
with a Tammany platform is doubly re
pugnant now that Democratic papers In the
West and South have rejoiced In the de
feat of Tammany and Mr. Shepard.
As for the Tammany resolutions, there Is
nothing in them regarding Porto Rico,
Cuba and the Philippines that Republicans
cannot subscribe to. Even the opposition
to ship subsidies is a position assumed by
Republicans of the West generally. Mr.
Shepard Is an original free-trader, yet In
what he says in his resolutions about the
tariff he falls short of Mr. Cleveland's
platform of "a tariff for revenue only" by
demanding simply a reduction of duties
without assailing the principle of protec
tion. Mr. Bryan may accept the Tam
many platform, since Tammany gave him
loyal support in 10, but because Mr.
Bryan has condoned the crimes of Tam
many Is no sign that the mass of tho Dem
ocratic party will accept Mr. Shepard and
Tammany as leaders and party lawmak
ers. It Is quite remarkable that the papers
which are demanding that tariff duties
which are well-nigh, if not quite, prohib
itory be cut down. so as to get rid of the
surplus do not see that reducing a duty
which shuts out foreign goods so that they
can bo Imported will Increase, rather than
decrease, the amount of duties which would
be collected. Take tho duties on an article
like window glass. The duties are now so
high that very little Is imported. If the
duties were reduced W per cent, the
amount imported would bo very large and
the duties collected would probably be In
creased 100 per cent. If no window glass
is Imported now because of the high duty
there Is every reason to believe that a
large quantity would be Imported for a year
or two until the market should be glut
ted; consequently whatever revenues were
collected under the lower rate of duty
would go to increase the surplus. If all
the duties now Imposed upon foreign goods
were reduced DO per cent, there Is not tho
least doubt that the surplus would be In
creased for a few years. If there are ar
ticles which can be put on the free list
It would bo different, since whatever rev
enue 13 collectible under the present duties
would be eliminated. To reduce the duties
on woolens, the higher grade of cottons
and scores of articles made of steel so that
European competitors could sell their goods
here would curtail production and labor
in this country and increase the revenues
until the country's capacity to purchase
liberally should cease.
Representative Alexander, of, EuffaloTls
authority for the statement that the man
agers of the late Pan-American Exposition
will ask Congress to make good their
losses to the amount of about 1 1,290,000, at
tributable, as they claim, to the assassina
tion of President McKinley. It is doubt
less true that this event did for a time
cause a great falling off In the receipts
of the exposition, but there Is no justice
in asking Congress to make good the def
icit. Tho Buffalo exposition was a private
enterprise, commendable in every respect,
but Congress should not establish the prec
edent of making good the losses of such
undertakings. It has spent too much
money on expositions already.
In his bill to create a McKinley national
paik and forest reserve of several million
acres of limber land in tho great moun
tain ranges of the South Representative
Brownlow, of Tennessee, has probably
struck a popular chord. The government
is committed to the policy of park and for
est reservations, but it has none in the
portion of the country above indicated.
The mountain scenery there is unsurpassed
for beauty, land is cheap and the preserva
tion of the forests which now cover it is a
deserving subject of legislation. As a na
tional memorial to the late President there
could be nothing finer, or, it is believed,
more In consonance with his feelings.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-The War De
partment to-day made public the first an
nual report of Major General Adna 11.
Chaffee, military Governor of the Philip
pine islands. General Chaffee sums up the
situation from a military point of view by
stating that tho provinces of Batangas and
Laguna, in Luzon, and the islands of Sa
mar, Mindoro, Ce-bu and Bohol constitute
the area now disturbed by any embodied
force of insurgents. He says that to the
physical character of the country, to the
nature of the warfare of the rebels, who
are amigo and foe in the self-same hour,
to the humanity of the troops, which is
taken advantage of by the rebels and the
inhabitants who sympathize with them,
and to the fear of assassination on the
part of the friendly disposed If they give
information to the American forces, is
due the prolongation of the guerrilla war
fare. Commenting on the plan of gradually
replacing military with civil administra
tion, General Chaffee says: "The with
drawal of interference with civil affairs
does not contemplate withdrawal of the
troops from their station to any consid
erable extent; on the contrary, this should
not be done hastily, and when undertaken
should be gradual and more in the nature
of concentration than reduction of force or
abandonment of any considerable area of
territory." He therefore recommends that
there be no further material reduction of
troops before January, 1303. The civil gov
enments which are being organized pro
vincial and municipal General Chaffee
says are both new and untried, and there
Is but one certain and reliable method of
ascertaining the progress of the Filipinos
in self-government, namely, observation by
the army.
On the subject of tho military govern
ment of the city of Manila, General Chaf
fee says: "In the government of Manila
for three years, if . the military have done
nothing more, it Is everywhere apparent
that an excellent foundation has been laid
and a turbulent and hostile community
brought to observe the laws and individual
ly be orderly. This has been done without
undue harshness or severity of treatment
of the inhabitants."
In anticipation of a partial concentration
of the troops in the Philippines next year
General Chaffee submits estimates of cost
for the construction of quarters and bar
racks. He recommends that a permanent
post be constructed at once in the vicinity
of Manila for a garrison of two squadrons
of cavalry, two batteries of artillery and
two full regiments of infantry, together
with a hospital and storehouse, the whole
to be under the command of a brigadier
general. He gives $0U0,ou0 as a rough "esti
mate of cost for this project, and Fays that
$20,ow should be available immediately in
order to take full advantage Of the dry
season. For the construction of perma
nent quarters at other points which may
be determined upon during the fiscal year
ended June, ho estimates $2,0u0,000 is
required.
General Chaffee devotes a good part of
his report to the terrible disaster which be
fell Company C, Ninth Infantry, at Balan
giga, Samar, and which, he say, was
"largely due to overconildence in assumed
pacified conditions and in a people who, to
a great extent, as yet are strangers to and
unappretiative of tmr humane and personal
liberty, beliefs and actions." American sol
diers, he says, fail to discriminate between
real and assumed friendship on the part of
the Filipinos.
A table is submitted showing that since
June 10 last, the date of the last table sub
mitted by General MacArthur, up to Sept.
13, Z'jl Filipino olficers and 3.GCS men surren
dered to the American military and 2G offi
cers and 4:4 men were captured.
In an appended report Gen. J. P. Sanger,
inspector general of the division of the
Philippines, in speaking of the discipline of
the troops in the islands, notes a commend
able absence of excesses and serious In
fractions of the regulations, but says there
is great room for improvement in the mat
ters of dress, demeanor and show of re
spect in saluting superior officers, the criti
cism applying to officers as well as soldiers.
Judge Advocate General Grosebeck says
that the suppression of brigandage in the
Philippines nm.i probably will be one of
the trying problems of the future. If the
military arm was left free to deal with the
marauders he says there would be no doubt
of their final suppression, but the Incoming
of civil government complicates the situa
tion very considerably.
Groat attention is paid In appended re
ports to the subject of the prevalence of
venereal iliseases in the army of the Phil
ippines and the vigorous measures taken
to segregate dissolute women, and, by rigid
physical inspection, guard against a spread
of such disease.

LONDOiN WEEKLY SCOLDS
ACRID COM3IENT ON PRESIDENT
ROOSEVELT'S 3IESSAGE.
Trust Conditions ns'Descrlhed by The
Speaker Saturday Review on
the Canal Treaty.
LONDON, Dec. 6. The comment of the
weeklies on President Roosevelt's message
to Congress is not generally so friendly as
that of the dailies. The Speaker devotes
the entire space to acrid comment on the
trust references. The. paper declares the
President's treatment of a grave economic
situation is trivial in form and unsatisfac
tory in substance, adding: "Did we not en
tertain a genuine belief in the goodness of
the President's intentions we should regard
his diagnosis of the Industrial situation as
insincere."
The Speaker's word picture of tho wide
spread ruin, corruption, economic tyranny
and domestic affliction brewing in America
as the result of trust domination would be
a revelation to the most ardent anti-trust
advocate in the United States. The article
concludes as follows: "For such a student
of industrial politcs as Mr. Roosevelt pro
fesses to be, to Ignore these conditions is an
act of intellectual daring that does him lit
tle credit. The upshot of the message is to
minimize and misrepresent the dangers of
trusts and to postpone any serlbus attempt
to grapple with them.'
The Saturday Review, on the other hand,
remarks: "All Industrial undertakings In
the United States are more scientifically or
ganized than In any other country, as we
have learned to our cost. The trust is the
last word of this system of scientific or
ganization, and the President is right when
he declines to hamper the captains of in
dustry." t
Turing: to the canal treaty, however, the
Saturday Review declares Great Britain
has sacrificed everything to gain the prob
lematical friendship of the United States,
"which will last Just as long as It takes
America to build a fleet, and not a day be
yond." The Outlook Is mildlv commendatory of
the message. It says: "The Anarchist pro
gramme is splendid in theory, but in prac
tice it Is impossible." As regards reciprocity
the Outlook remarks: "Frankly selfish,
America will accept freely whatever bene
fits herself, but will be careful that no in
fant industry is squeezes out of the peram
bulator." Trihnte to President Roosevelt.
LONDON, Dec. C An article on Presi
dent Roosevelt will occupy considerable
epace in to-morrow's issue of the Specta
tor. His message to Congress Is highly
commended. "Here, at any rate," the Spec
tator will say, "is a man who knows what
he means and who means that the world
shall know it also." Briefly the Spectator
will appprove of President Roosevelt's at
titude both in regard to trusts and to
foreign policy, but th?i paper will admit
that European powers will never accept
Monroeism in theory, and only in prac
tice as long as the American navy is
strong enough to support it. The Specta
tor is especially glad that President Roose
velt is inclined to face the possibility of
the need to amend the Constitution, which
American statesmen alvays regard as too
sacred to be touched.
The Spectator will also contain a highly
eulogistic article on President Roosevelt's
essay, "The Citizen and the Public Man,"
and will say that in this essay one sees
a man with the inflexible moral vigor of
Cromwell. "We are convinced that Pres
ident Roosevelt," the parser says, "is go
ing to play a great part and h good part
if he continues his work in the spirit
which inspires this remarkable sermon. He
will prove the most sweetening influence in
the whole lump of American civil life that
has been known for m-iny years."

from their injuries. Two white men, names
unknown, who had been riding on the front

miles east of The Dalles this afternoon.

Engineer Maurice Cavanaugh was badly
scalded and perhaps internally injured.
Fireman Frank Crase was seriously in
jured. None of the passengers was. hurt.

SECRET CONTRIBUTIONS.
How School Children Will Swell the
McKinley Memorial Fund.
CLEVELAND, O., Dec 6. L. II. Jones,
superintendent of the Cleveland public
schools, has devised a plan for receiving
contributions from pupils to the McKinley
national memorial fund that has received
the hearty approval of the officials of the
national association. It is pointed out that
in the schools, attended alike by the chil
dren of rich and poor, public offerings
often cause suffering to sensitive pupils.
Mr. Jones's plan is for a secret contribu
tion. Each pupil will be supplied with an
envelope on which will be written the name
and home address. Whether a contribution
is made or not this envelope will be sealed
ami handed to the teacher, who will send
it to the designated treasurer. In this way
no one knows the amount of the contribu
tion, or whether one has given at all. Con
tributions from a penny up are received.
Every contributor is given a souvenir cer
tificate, no matter how small his offering.
This souvenir certificate further serves a
contributor's pride by simply stating that
he is a contributor, without giving the
amount. In this way the children who have
given a penny and the millionaire who
contributed his thousands are on equal
footings. The McKinley National Memorial
Association thinks so well of the idea that
it will probably indorse its ure for the en
tire country.
TO PREVENT THE MERGER.
MInncsotnns Will Confer with the
Interstate-Commerce Commission.
ST. FAUL, Minn., Dec. 6. The members
of the Minnesota state railroad and ware
house commission, the Pioneer Press says,

way merger as contemplated by the North
ern Securities Company. The commission
has invited Governor Van Sant and Attor
ney General Douslass to accompany it,
and it is expected that both wlil accept,
as transportation has been arranged for
five persons. The party will leave St. Paul
Sunday night, and the conference with the
Interstate Commission Is set for Tuesday.-
The conference was planned by Commis
sioner Mills and has been under considera
tion for some time, but the final arrange
ments were not completed until last night.
Mr. Mills declines to discuss the matter.
He Is the author of the resolution provid
ing for the conference. In a general way
the purpose of the conference is to arrive
at a definite plan of action, and, if possible,
f-ecure the co-operation of the national
commission. The Interstate Commission has
signified its willingness to extend any help
it may be able to under the interstate-commerce
laws.

terian committee on the revision of the
creed occupied most of their scsicn to

pose which will W Incorporated as one
of the articles of th brief doctrinal state
ment. There was considerable difference
of opinion as to the expression of this

FLOOD OF RESOLUTIONS
EIGHTY-EIGHT PRESENTED TO TIIC
FEDERATION OF LABOR.
One Denounces Minister NVu TinRfnnff
and Another Thanked Pres
Ident Roosevelt.
SCRANTON, Fix.. Dec. C The convention
of the American Federation of Labor dis
posed of considerable routine business to
day. Two sessions were held. The aft
ernoon meeting was adjourned an hour
earlier in order that the committees which
were announced by President Gompers
could organize and take up the work that
has been laid out for them. There was a
full attendance of delegates, and business
v. as transacted without a hitch or much
eliscussion, except in the matter of a con
tested scat of a St. Louis delegate. This,
however, did not amount to much, al
though the discussion was quite lengthy.
The overshadowing feature of the day
was an addrtts of Edward F. McSchween
ey, deputy commissioner of immigration
at the port of New York, on the tabject
of immigration. He spoke for more than
an hour, and was generously applauded for
the great amount of information that h
gave the delegates.
During the course of the two Session
eighty-eight resolutions were presented
and referred to committees. They cover
nearly every variety of subjects that af
fect workmen. One of them contained a
denunciation of Wu Tingfang, the Chinese
minister, for an alleged derogatory re
mark against the American people, and
another conveyed the "sincere and hearty
thanks of the Federation of Labor to Pres
ident Roosevelt for the position he took
in his message to Congress on the ques
tion of Chinese exclusion.
The report of the committed on creden
tials promised to develop into a lively de
bate, but tho call for t lie jtn-vioiis question
suddenly cut off lurther discussion. An
objection was entered against tiiui part of
the report which referred to the St. Louis
stationary engineers and brewery work
men's controversy. The committee recom
mended that Delegate William M. llranut.
of the Trades and Labor Union, be seated
against the pfotest of the stationary engine-era
and that the Trade and Labor
Union be instructed to have the brewery
engineers join the International Union of
Steam Engineers. The convention seated
Bradt without a word, but the matter of
instructing the labor union to take in the
brewery engineers caused an extended dis
cussion. It was finally referred to the ex
ecutive council for disposal, and thus the
important question of trade autonomy
was not settled as was expected.
After President Gompers had announced
the committees the convention adJcuTnei
until U o'clock to-morrow morning.
MISSION WORK DISCUSSED.
The Rev. Dr. Nelson on the Southern
Negro's Condition.
ROCHESTER, N. Y., Dec. 6. At this
afternoon's session of the Protestant Epis
copalian convention the subject, "What
Are We Doing for tho Negro?" was treated
by Right Rev. C. Kinlock Nelson. D. D.,
bishop of Georgia; "The Philippines," by
the Rev. Charles H. Beck, bishop-elect to
the Philippines; "Brazil," by the Right
Rev. Luden L. Kinsolving, D. D., bishop
of Brazil.
Dr. Nelson made a strong appeal for the
education of the colored race along indus
trial lines. In spite of the many colleges
of the South, said the speaker, which are
devoted to higher education of the negro,
few are found who stand high in the in
stitutions, adding that the real demand is
for a training that will fit the colored man
for elemental and useful vocations.
Dr. Nelson declared emphatically that
there is no detent, capable negro in the
South to-day who m-ee! be without work
for twelve hours. Continuing, he -aid:
"The Southern popl as a class have r.ej
sympathy with the outrages that are per
petrated. The best of them are opposed
to the disregard for law and order that is
sometimes manifesteei, and I wish to warn
you against liieving all you re-ad about
the enormities that are chronicled. Too
often these are the jsroducts of the imagi
nation of sensational newspapers and haves
no foundation in fact." In closing Dr. Nel
son said that the contributions that have
been made for the prei.-jeeution of work
among the negines in the South have bven
deplorably inadequate.
Tho Rev. Charles H. Breht spoke of the
Philippine Islands and his electisn to that
field.
Dr. Kinsolving said when he went to
Rrazil he found himself in a land of hplr
ltual death among lyos J jeople, four
fifths of whom wre utterly illiterate-, and
that practlcallv the same conditions pre
vail to-day. "The growth e.f e.ur work in
Brazil, however." said Dr. Kinsolving,
"antl the growth of our church and tha
liberality of the native Christuns have no
parallel in history."
