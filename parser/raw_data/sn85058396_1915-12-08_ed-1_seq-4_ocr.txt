H TWO PICTURES
H BEFORE US.
H J Two pictures are before us, and
MM ; I each brings sad thoughts. One
H shows a mother and two little chil-
MM I dren on the .site of Ihetr former
MM home in the Artois district of France,
H which lately was recaptured by the
H French. There is nothing left of
H I the home except the foundation
H IT stones, and all around is desolation.
H The father of the children has fallen
H in the war. What a terrible thing
H war is when seen in the horrible
H I aspect of a despoiler of homes and
R J a cruel monster robbing women and
H I children of their sustenance, their
H 1 comfort, their homo? Could the war
be visualized that we might see but
Hj a very small fraction of its horrors,
H sot one of us would sanction armed
conflict except as a last resort in
self-defense.
The other picture is that of an
old man on a public street holding
the attention of a shabbily dressed
little boy and girl by exhibiting a
mechanical toy. It is a Christmas
suggestion. How many little- boys
and girls are peering into the show
windows with feelings of uncertainty
as to what Santa Claus will bring
them, no one can estimate. But thoy
arc far too numerous. Christmas
brings to many a child extromo dis
appointment and fixes on memory a
dread of a world as chilly as the
bleak winds of winter.

COMMENTS ON THE
MESSAGE.
President Wilson's message Is- crit
icised by the Republican leaders 4 In
congress, among them Congressman
Mann, who says:
"I am of a practical turn of mind
and the feature of the president's
message that to me was of the most
interest was tho admission that with
out additional burdens of taxation the
treasury of the United States faces
a deficiency of $297,000,000. That
shows clearly that the Democratic
party is incapable of administering
the government."
Former Speaker "Uncle Joe" Can
non said:
"My opinion of the President's mes
sage? Urn, well, place In bold type
all of the president's message beside
se.e 'if you don't have my opinion.
Besides, tho whole program is up to
congress, and I couldn't guess what
Its action will be on the various meas
ures proposed." I might just as well
speculate, if a child is being born,
whether its mother is going to board
or keep house."
Senator A. B. Cummins of Iowa said
he believed that a stronger income
tax should be made the main source
of revenue. He' said:
"The rate of the surtax on larger
incomes particularly should be in
creased. T also am inclined to fa
vor the lowering of the exemptions
so as to take In smaller inomes. The
tax on smaller incomes should be
light, however, and should increase
rapidly with the size of the Income.
Though the president's message was
excellent in many respects, I do not
think he emphasized sufficiently tho
55B- I III II gBBBaatBBSEai
need of auxiliary supply ships 1
have heard it said that our fleet could
not cruise out more than 300 miles
with safety in an attack because of
the pitiful lack of supply ships that
.we have In our service. I am strong
ly in favor of a ship purchase bill
for this reason. But I would bo op
posed to having partial private own
ership, involving the status of these
vessels. If they are bought, they
should bo owned outright by our gov
ernment Thoy should be used es
' sentially for public good and not for
private profit."
The message does not bring a very
hearty response of approval from
even tho Democratic side.
Representative Hay, chairman of
the house committee on military af
fairs, said:
"I agree with the president In prin
ciple, but not in details. A conti
nental army seems to me to be un
wise. We can get the same results
by a development of the militia. In
this country it is very hard to get
young men to enter the standing
army."
Senator George R. Chamberlain,
chairman of the senate military com
mittee, said:
"I believe the president should have
called the attention of congress a lit-
vehemently to the unwarranted at
titude of England In sweeping our
commerce from the seas In the
main, T agree with the president's
defenso proposals. In some of the
details of a continental army I may
differ. Personally. I am inclined to
favor a standing armyk of, say, 140,000
men and drawing on a reserve for the
rest of our military strength."
Representative Flood, chairman of
the house committeo on foreign af
fairs, said
"The message was a little more se
vere on foreign-born Americans than
I had expected to hear If foreign
born Americans aro conspiring against
our country, however, everyone of us
would like to see the passage of strict
laws dealing with such offense I
don't believe that congress will ever
be persuaded to pass a tax on auto
mobile engine horsepower or gasoline.
It would impose too severe a burden
on farming interests Tho best
manner of raising revenue appears
to be an Increase of the surtaxes in
the Income tax schedule."

WHAT WAR MEANS TO
THE MEDICAL MEN.
Not tho least of the war prepara
tions of the countries now in the -great
European conflict is that of providing
'for the care of the wounded and
guarding the health of all the troops
in camp and In the field. How ex
tensive is this work no one can
faintly understand without reading
the reports of the multitudinous du
ties of the medical men in laboratory
and in the field. An English report
of the Medical Research committee
is just at hand, which tells of im
portant researches made into cerebro
spinal fever, acute nephritis, gunshot
wounds of the chest, measles in mili
tary camps, the technique of skin
grafting, and physiological fatigue in
I munition factories, and a scheme of
1 study for the investigation of dlsor
l dors of the soldier's heart.
t. No subject for research has seemed
- of more urgent importance than that
1 of the pathology of Infected wounds
I considered with a view to their ef-
fective treatment. The recent experi
' ence of septic wounds inflicted in the
" field has revealed previously unsus
'. pectcd difficulties, which the re
sources of modern surgery have not
Leon able to overcome.
Meanwhile the treatment of wounds
by a hypertonic salt solution, without
. antiseptics, is boiug extensively used
in practice, and is giving results
which are regarded by many as su
perior, to those obtained by the ordi
nary use of antiseptics.
Other Investigations have been un
dertaken in London and Edinburgh,
upon hypochlorous acid as an anti
septic and the committeo has sent a
doctor to the Moditerranoan, where
he will have exceptional opportunities
for applying and reporting upon the
methods which have- already given
good results in France and in Eng
land. Special investigations have beeu
made by the committee into the meth
ods of diagnosing typhoid infections
in previously inoculated men.
Standard cultures and sera, with
apparatus, have been supplied to more
than a hundred military hospitals, and
there Is ovory reason to believe that
their use will not only aid the diag
nosis and study of the typhoid and
paratyphoid infections, but will also
nllow accurate comparisons to be
drawn between the records of obser
vation made by various observers in c
different places at different times. J
An expedition to Egypt, has had 1
the important result of demonstrating
that Egyptian Bilharziosis cannot be
directly communicated from man to
man, but is only transmitted through
a fresh-water snail, in which its alter
nate form is parasitic. The expedi
tion was also able to decide upon spe
cial precautionary measures in tho
treatmont of water which are suffi
cient to safeguard tho military forces
for Immediate purposes.
The committeo has assisted the war
office in arranging for the better co
ordination of the study and descrip
tion by trained observers of the neu
rological cases at military hospitals.
In conjunction with workers abroad
nearly fifty neurologists in London
and at tho various provincial centers
are now working upon a common
plan, the committee providing certain
printed forms, diagrams and appara
tus. A card index is being compiled
with reference to the full clinical rec
ords in individual hands, notes upon
the experience obtained by Tarlous ob
servers have been circulated, and
grants have been 'made for part-time
work by several uncommissioned phy
sicians for special assistance In the
study of cases both of structural ner-

MOTORCYCLE AS A
NOISE MAKER.
"My wife had been ill," said tho
business man, "and had just begun
to doze early this morning, when a
motorcycle came down our street
with a roar and a blast that ban
ished sleep in our house. Say, Mr.
Editor, why don't you call attention
to this nuisance while you are cam
paigning in behalf of a. better city?"
The motorcycle driver who creates
a general disturbance not unlike a bat
tery of rapid-fire guns, should remem
ber that tho right to the use of tho
streets does not include tho privilege
of Inflicting a shock on overy nerv
ous person within four squares of his
machine.
These cold mornings the owner of
a motor is forced to resort to sprae
method of wanning up, but he should
proceed with as little explosive force
as possible and never get bo loud
as to be worse than a volley of mus
ketry. s. i-n-i t
