Tbe Ball Opens—Grover Not In It
The first session of the Fifty-Second
Congress opened on Monday, three
hundred and twenty-six members
answering the roll call in the lower
house, of which two hundred and
thirty-eight are Democrats, and only
eighty-seven Republicans, with a con
tingent of seven members credited to
the Farmers Alliance organization, the
membeship of the House being
three hundred and thirty-two.
Where so large a majority is of the
Bourbon persuasion, and in turn so
many ot them are of the Southern
Confederacy type, it is not surprising
that the advent of the session was
‘pened by a factional contest in the
'emocratic caucus, unparalleled in

ters of the
ig more in-
te'Hgenl. They have learned the
habit ol meditating upon the con- \
dition ol agriculture, its resources
and its needs, and they are prompt
to respond to any intelligent effort
for their benefit. The idea ol recip
rocity is no longer new, and the
policy has passed out ol the experi
mental stage, thanks to the Harrison
administration and especially to
James G. Blaine, its Secretary of
State. Even the Democratic leaders
and organs, seeing its success, are
gradually ceasing to denounce it,
and they are beginning to perceive
that it is destined to play an
important part in future political
contests.
Every barrel of flour or beef or
pork that is sent abroad benefits the
farmer, whose energies are devoted
to the production of these articles.
Whatever enhances the demand for
the products of one section is an
advantage, directly or indirectly, to
everyone who is engaged in the
tillage of the soil. The time is ap
proaching when the entire product
of the country will be consumed at
home, but meantime it is a matter ot
great moment that a market shall
be provided for the surplus.
The Republican party attracts the
support ol business men by its
sound economic and financial prin
ciples. It is the workingmen’s party,
as it has always been, because it
champions the interests of Ameri
can labor and stands by the policy
of Protection to home industries.
Its advocacy of Reciprocity com
mends it to all classes, but especially
to the farmers of the land, than
whom there are no more patriotic
or intelligent citizens. It has only
to go forward in the line ot progress
which it has hitherto followed to
realize the success which it deserves,
and retain control of the govern
ment, which it has proved that it
c.m administer so as to secure the
welfare and prosperity of all its
citizens.
The Presidents Message.
In obedience to constitutional re
quirement President Harrison sent*
to Congress on Wednesday his an
nual message on the state of the
Union. Every impartial reader of
it will concede, that it is an able,
exhaustive, and business-like pres
entation of the work of the adminis
tration for the past year. The
Presidents treatment of our foreign
relations has the true American
ring, and the country at large may
rest confident that the final settle
ment of the Chilian botheration will
be in keeping with our national
dignity and honor. In reviewing
tne work ol his administration in the
removal of restrictions on the im
portation of American meals, the
President indulges a tone ol gratifi
cation in being able to state that
Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria,
and France have removed such re
strictions, and that looking to
equitable trade relations with Ger
many, an agreement is pending by
which srgars from that country will
be admitted Iree.
The President vindicates the
wisdom ot recent tariff legislation,
by the statement that “a brief exami
nation of the statistics ol the Treas
ury, and a general glance at the
state of business throughout the
country will,” he thinks, ‘‘satisfy
any impartial inquirer that its results
have disappointed the evil prophe
cies ol its opponents, and in a large
measure realized the hopeful pre
dictions of its friends. Rarely, if
ever, before in the history of the
country has there been a time when
the proceeds ol one day’s labor, or
the product of one farmed acre,
would purchase as large an amount
of those things that enter into the
living ol the masses of the people.”
“I believe,” the President continues,
“that a lull test will develope the
fact that the Tariff act ol the Fifty
first Congress is very favorable in
its average effect upon the prices ol
articles entering into common use.”
During the year from October x,
1890, to September 30, 1891, the
total value ol our foreign commerce,
exports and imports, was $1,747,-
806,406 —the largest in anv ,<r in
the history of the United States. Of
that vast sum the imports amounted
to $824,715,270. The revenue of
the Government for the year end ;d
June 30 was $458,544.23303. and
the expenditures for the same period
were $421,304,470 46, leaving a sur
plus of $37,239,762 57.
Upon the question of the free
coinage ol silver the President re
iterates his opinion that its free
and unlimited coinage would under
existing conditions “disasterously
affect our business interests at home
and abroad” and recommends that
existing laws be given a full trial
Between February and July of this
year the peculiar financial conditions
then prevailing in Europe caused a
drain of gold from our country
amounting to $68,000,000. The
fact that no serious monetary dis
turbance resulted to us was a fresh
evidence to Europe of the strength
and stability of our financial insti
tutions. Up to December Ist $27,
854,000 of that gold had come back,
and a largely increased return is
expected during the winter and
coming spring. Since March, 1889,
no less than $259,079,350 of our
interest bearing securities have been
redeemed. There has been an in
crease of the volume of money in
circulation, which on the first day
of December, 1891, amounted to
5i.577. 262 .°70, or $34 38 per head
of the whole population, men,
women and children.
In a partizan political sense, pos
sibly the closing recommendations
of the Presidents message with
reference to the delects in our
Federal election system, and the
evils of gerrymandering will excite
the most sensation. After alluding to
the gerrymander in Michigan affect
ing the method ol selecting electors
of president by congressional dis
tricts, and to the attempt made in
the last Congress to bring to bear
the constitutional powers of the
TZELE CECIL WHIG, 2, DECEMBER 12, 1891.
general G n erninent for ih ; cor- I
lection < ( fr.'iuls against [>opular !
suflrage, the President expresses the i
belief that it “would be possible to '
constitute a commission, non-parti- 1
san in its membership, and com
posed of patriotic, wise and im
partial men, to whom a consideration
of the question of the evils con
nected with our election system and
methods might be committed with a
good prospect of securing unani
mity in some plan for removing or
mitigating those evils. The Con
stitution would permit the selection
of the commission to be vested in
the Supreme Court, if that method
would give the est guarantee of
impartiality.
This commission should be char
ged with the duty of inquiring into
the whole subject of the law of ekc
tions as related to the choice of offi
cers of the national government,
with a view to securing to every
elector a free and unmolested exer
cise of the suffrage, and as near an
aaproach to an equality of value in
each ballot cast as is att inable."
A dispatch from Washington
says that, while it is impossible to
obtain an official acknowledgment
to that effect, it is known that a
commercial convention under the
reciprocity clause of the McKinley
act has been practically arranged
between Germany and the United
States, and that the President will
soon issue a proclamation announc
ing the fact.
SPEAKER CRISP.
Comments of the I’ress on his Selection.
DOOMED ANYHOW.
“So tbe Democrats, according to their
own testimony, were between tbe devil
and tbe deep sea. The party was doomed
if it did, and equally doomed if it did
not. It had further cause tor passionate
feeling on account ol the belief that the
nomination for tbe Presidency would
probably depend upon the choice o! its
national policy. With the Presidency
would go the selection of officers in all
parts ol tbe country, the distribution of
patronage and fat contracts, and all tbe
rewards of victory. If the. Western and
Southern policy should be adopted Mr.
Cleveland would have to stand aside for
somebody else. No wonder there was
intense feeling, and the result of tbe
decision which the caucus dually reached
cannot yet be definitely anticipated.’ 1 —
New York Tribune (.Rep.).
“TAMMANY HAS WON.”
■‘Tammany has won the Speakership,
and now dominates the National Democ
racy as well as that of the Empire State.
The long and bitter struggle against the
mastery of the worst element in Demo
oratio politics leaves wounds that will
not be quickly healed. The star of Hill
is. for the time being, in the ascendant,
and Cleveland’s is on the wane. None
can fail to recognize this central feature
in yesterday’s results.”— New York
RecoMed (Rep.).
IT WILT, “GIVE PAUSE.”
“The elation of Mr. Crisp by the
coalition of the demagogy of Hill, the
spoilsmongering of Tammany, the pro
tectionisra of Gorman and Brice, the
half corrupt, half fanatical free silver
movement, and the old South, must
inevitably ‘give pause’ to the men who
have believed that the Democratic party
would he a lit instrumentality for the
accomplishment of tariff reform and for
the clean and honest administration of
the Government.”— New York Times
(hid. Pem ).
A MATTER OK EXPEDIENCY.
“While there will be no halt in the
work of tariff reform because of the sue
cess of Mr. Crisp, it w ill be generally,
and we believe gratefully, accepted by
the country as a triumph of the more
oouservalive element of the Democracy.
The one unerring index of the wisdom of
Crisp’s election to the Speakership is in
the fact that the Republican leaders
were practically an acinous in the desire
for the success of Mills, and hoped to
gain great political advantage from it.
This does not prove Mill’s unfitness, but
it was uumistakeable as the expediency
of his selection.” — Philadelphia Times
(Dim ).
RIVAL CLAIMS.
“There will be explanations and ex
cuses and all that, and tbe Cleveland
people will contend that there is no sig
uificauce politically in the result, but
nevertheless tbe followers of David B.
Hill claim the victory as theirs and will
preceed to relegate Cleveland to the rear
as a Presidential candidate.” — Philadel
phi'i Inquirer (Rep.).
A SQUARE TOED, MANLY STRUGGLE
“The Washington stiuggle was a
square toed, manly struggle for the
honors of leadership. The party will be
well led with Crisp in the chair. The
only rook upou which the party may
possibly split is in the passage of the two
great p sitious to the men ol the Sout i. ’
—Philadelphia North American (Rep.).
FOR TARIFF REFORM. HUT DISCREET.
“The selection of Mr. Crisp was a keen
disappointment to the friends ol Mr.
Mills and to those prominent Cleveland
managers wiio were advocating the elec
tion of tbe Texan Mr. Crisp holds
about the same views of free trade, or
tariff reform, as it is called, but, unlike
tile Texan, he will fight behind masked
batteries, in the hope that the people will
not see their danger until his party is
entrenched in power Th) election of
Crisp is really due principally to the
efforts of three men—Senator Gorman,
of Maryland; Governor Hill, of New
York, and Amos J. Cummings, tbe rep
reseutativeof Tammany. How the Demo
crats throughout the country will feci
over their new rules remain to be seen.”
—Philadelphia Call (hid. Rip.).
ANTI CLEVELAND.
“The election of Mr. Crisp Speaker of
of the House of Representatives is a dis
tinctive anti-Cleveland triumph. It will
fill the Cleveland forces with anger and
dismay, and correspondingly elate Gov
ernor Hill and his supporters. It also
gives a set back to the free traders and
to the opponents of a debauched cui
rency ” — Trenton Slate Gazette (Rep )
GORMAN, HILL AND TAMMANY.
“The significance of Crisp’s success
lies chiefly in the immense prestige
which it gives to the anti Cleveland
Democrats. We believe it will have no
effect in staying the purpose of the
majority to reopen the tariff agitation
and to pass a free coinage bill or that it
is intended by any considerable number
of those who have brought it about to
produce such effect. But it will have a
marked tendency to throw the control of
the Democratic party at the next Na
tional Convention into new hands and to
give to Senator Gorman, Governor Hill
and Tammany Hall the power not only
of shaping the tariff and silver issues,
but of naming the next Democratic can
didate for the Presidency.”— Philadel
phia Evening Bulletin (Rep.).
WHAT CRISP TYPIFIES.
“Mr. Crisp typifies the doctrine of his
party in advocating a financial policy
that would debase the working men’s
dollar, drive American gold abroad and
make our mints the dumping ground
for the silver of the world. Like his'
Hipnest of all in Leavening Power.— l r . S. Gov’l Report, Aug. 17,

currency. His election as Speaker fixes
the issues of 1892 beyond possibility of
change.” —New York Press (Rep.).
PKOBABLT CONSERVATIVE POLICY.
“The policy of the Democratic mpj i ily
in the House under the rule of Speaker
Crisp will probably be conservative, so
far as the factional spirit engendered by
the recent contest will permit The
difficulties of the Speaker will be within
rather than without the lines of his own
party, and there will he. in all likelihood,
some exceedingly lively and dramatic
incidents to recoiri before the session is
over. The Republicans have only to
observe a policy ol armed neutrality and
let the Democrats settle their quanels
Kilkenny cat fashion among themselves,
assured that sufficient blunders will be
perpetrated to give the Republican party
an easy victory in I>-S2.” —Baltimore
American (Rep ).
“WHAT IT MEANS.”
“Alter a hard contest the Democrats
have decided that Mr. Crisp shall be the
next Speaker of the House ol R’-prcseu
tatives It is the triumph of policy over
principle. It moans that the Democrats
are afraid of the tariff' issue, afraid to
champion the free trade principles they
believe in, afraid to commit themselves
in advance to Cleveland as their oandi
date and tariff smashing as their pro
gramme in tbe campaign of 1892.
“Crisp’s election means that the ’Solid
South’ is in tbe saddle, and that tbe
Tammany tiger is lord ol the Demo
cratic jungle. The votes he received
from this state were cast at the dictation
of B iss Croker and Governor Hill. The
votes he received from the South were in
recognition of bis candidacy as a repre
sautalive of the methods and policies
that have disfranchised Republicans,
stifled discussion, kept alike the race
issue and made the Democratic party a
party of ring men ot oligarchs, of
•bosses’—a party whose leaders are aris
toorats and whose followers are a mob.
” ‘On the other hand, Judge Crisp is
an able man, a good ptrlhmentalian,
cool headed and full of ’nerve ’ He will
work hand and glove with ‘Boss’ Gor
man and ‘Boss’ Hill. He will not. lose
bis temper, nor put bis party at a disad
vantage by tactical blunders, as Mills
might have done.” —New York Mail and

Philadelphia, December 7, 1891.
The Advertiser prowling
about recently came suddenly
upon dazzling things that
■ started his eyes with wonder.
5 To him—news. Perhaps the
same to you.
The surprise was in and
about the little Turkish Room
in the Upholstery section,
second floor, Thirteenth street.
In times past we have made a
panic in adjectives when writ
ing about our Oriental Em
broideries. Sincere always
and truthful in all that we have
ever stated on the subject, we
drop the adjectives now per
force. Drop them in the pres
ence ol an array of Turkish
Embroideries that makes all
past collections seem pale.
Drop them—they are unequal
to the occasion.
This is one ol the out-of-the
way places that the crowds do
not seek. It points the truth ot
our advice—“explore.’’ The
brilliant things in Hmbioidery
of gold and silk on various
ground textiles are all about.
Gay, not gaud}’. You could
not think of a Saracen as gay
and frivolous. Alert, active,
terrible, mysterious—never
frolicsome. So a touch of
seriousness comes into the
merchandise, makes the bril
liant rich and gives the restful
touch to the highest color.
The Embroidery takes caba
listic form and Arab letters
perhaps Moslem players are
stitched in.
But the solemn merchandise
and the serious manner doesn't
make Turk or Aiab a model
ot honest trading. All the Far
away-Moses business in stuff
and—and —very extraordinary
prices. To flank it and get to
bed-rock values is no easy
thing. Been at it tor long,
and at last have succeeded.
Therefore this strange semi
barbaric elegance comes to
you to-day at cost far below
the past. The cheapness will
surprise you—that is if you
have any faculty of surprise
lor cheapness after your long
knowledge of the economic
triumphs of our Modern Meth
ods in Merchandising.

are here in great
course there is
not such a great
variety of colors, as the pre
vailing ones run to Browns,
Blacks and Blues; but what
there is you will find on our
counters.
An inspection of our stock
is cordially requested and will
be worth the trouble. Prices
have been cut almost in half
and our choicest goods placed
within the reach of the most
moderate purse. In cheviots,
Diagonals and Scotch goods
we can suit your fancy in
goods, workmanship and price.
Let us cite one instance of
price cutting.
A fine cheyiot suit made of
good material, honest work
manship and, as a necessary’
result, good wearing qualities
—for the remarkably low
price of sl2. This is not a
ready-made suit but one made
to your order.
In a few weeks we will have
a talk with you about over
coats.
