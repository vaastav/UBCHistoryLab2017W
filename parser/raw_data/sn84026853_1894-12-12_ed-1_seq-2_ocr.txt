against the acceptance of the

that the trust having the only buyer

the price of that grade of tobacco

ADDRESS TO DEMOCRATS.
Non-Partisan Constitutional Convention
Advocated It* Importance Set Forth.
To the Democratic Voters of South
Carolina:
In the progress of the eform movement
we have reached a critical period
in the historv of the State. All of
maintained on account of deposits.
Another very important feature of
this plan is the exemption of State
banks from taxations by the United
States in cases where it is shown to the
satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury and Comptroller of the Currency,
by banks claiming such exemption,that
they havenothad outstanding
their circulating notes exceeding 75
per cent, of their paid up and unimpaired
capital; that their stockholders
are individually liable for the redemption
of their circulating notes to the
full extent of their ownership of stock;
that the liability of said banks upon
their circulating notes constitutes under
their State law a first lien upon
their assets; that such banks have
kept and maintained a guarantee fund
in United States legal tender notes,
including Treasury notes of 1890,
equal to 30 per cent, of their outstanding
circulating notes when presented
of tViAii* nrin^?inQl r%r* nac
from the immediately available cash
assets of said bank and if these should
be insufficient such impairment to be
made good by pro rata assessment
among the otner banks, their contributions
constituting a first lieu upon
the assets of the failed bank in favor
of the contributing banks. As a further
security it is contemplated that
the existing provision fixing the individual
liability of stockholders is to be
retained and the bank's indebtedness
on account of its circulating notes is
to be made a first lieu on all its assets.
For the purpose of meeting the expense
of printing notes, official supervison,
cancellation and other like
charges, there shall be imposed a tax
of say one-half of 1 per cent, per annum
upon the average amount of
notes in circulation. It is further
provided that there shall be national
bank notes issued of a less denomination
than ten dollars; that each national
bank except in case of a failed bank
shank shall redeem or retire its notes
in the first instance at its own office
or at agencies to be designated by it,

circulation?thus permitting such increase
or reduce or reduction within
the limit of 75 per cent, of capital to be
quickly made as emergencies arise.
In additional to the guantee fund re?uied
it is proposed to provide a safety
und for the immediate redemption of
the circulating notes of failed banks
by imposing a small annual tax, say
one-half of 1 per cent, upon the average
circulation of each bank until the
fuud amounts to 5 per cent, of the
total circulation outstanding. When
a bank fails its guarantee fund is to
be paid into this safety fund and its
notes are to be redeemed in the first j
instance from such safety funds thus
authorized; any impairment of such
fund caused thereby to be made good

in his report a scheme modifying present
banking laws and providing for
the issue or circulating notes by State
banks free from taxation under certain
limitations. The Secretary explains
his plan so planinlvand its advantages
are developed by him with such remarkable
clearness that any effort 011
my part to present arguments in its
support would be superfluous. I shall
therefore content myself with an unqualified
endorsement of tlieSecretary's
proposed changes in the law and a brief
and imperfect statement of their
prominent features:
It is proposed to repeal all laws
providing for the deposit of United
States bonds as security for
circulation, to permit national banks
to issue circulating notes not exceeding
in amount 75 per cent, of their paid
up and unimpaired'capital, provided

fore, as no provision is made for the
final redemption or the putting aside
of the currancy obligation now used
to repeatedly and constantly draw
from the government its gold and as
long as no better authority for bond
issues is allowed than at present exists,
such authority will be utilized whenever
and as often as it becomes necesary
to maintain a sufficient gold reserve
and in abundant time to save the credit
of our country and make good the financial
declarations of our government.
THE PRESSING QUESTION.
Questions', relating to our banks and
currency are closely connected with
the subject just referred to and they
also present some unsatisfactory features.
Prominent among them are
the lack of elasticity in our currency
circulation and its frequent concentration
in financial centers when it is
most needed in other parts of the
country. The absolute divorcement
of the government to the currency of
the country is advisable. This condition
cannot be immediately reached;
but as a step in that direction and as a
means of securing a more elastic and
cvcrv aiuc. iiic uuuiauut} tuav mvivuov
our danger also inrease our danger
also inorease the necessity of protecting
this reserve against depletion, and
it is most unsatisfactory to know that
the protection afforded is only a temporary
palliative.
It is perfectly and palpably plain
that the only way under present conditions
by which this reserve, when
dangerously depleted, can be replenish
ed is through the issue and sale of the
bonds of the government for gold and
yet Congress has not only thus far declined
to authorize the issue of bonds
best suited to such a purpose, but there
seems a disposition in some quarters
to deny botn the necessity ana power
for the issue of bonds at all. I can
not for a moment believe that any of
our citizens are deliberately willing
that their government should default
in its pecuniary obligations or that its
financial operations snould be reduced
to a silver basis. At any rate I should
not feel that my duty was done if I
omitted any effort I could make to
i V* n A O 1 A? r+ f linm.
gold neid tor its redemption ana me
means which must be resorted to for
the purpose of replenishing such redemption
fund when impaired. Even
if the claims upon this fund were confined
to the obligations originally intended
and if the redemption of these
obligations meant their cancellation,
the fund would be very small. But
these obligations when received and
redeemed in gold are not cancelled butare
re-issued and may do duty many
times, by drawing gold from the
Treasury. Thus we have an endless
chain in operation, constantly depleting
the Treasury's gold and never near
a final rest. As if this was not bad
enough, we have by a statutory declaration
tnat it is the policy of the government
to maintain the parity between
gold and silver, aided the force
and momentum of this exhausting
process, and added largely to the currency
obligations claiming this peculiar
gold redemption. Our small gold
reserve is thus subject to drain from
rrur\ /lAminnnoQCD
served in the Treasury for the purpose
of redeeming the notes of the government
circulating as money in the
hands of the people became so reduced,
and its further depletion in the
near future seemed so certain, that in
the exercise of proper care for the
public welfare it became necessary to
replenish this reserve and thus maintain
popular faith in the ability and
determination of the government to
meet, as agreed, its pecuniary obligations.
It would have been well if in
this emergeacy authority had existed
to issue the bonds of the government
I bearing a low rate of interest and maturing
within a short period. But the
Congress having failed to confer such
authority, resort was neceesarily had
to the Resumption Act of 1875 and
pursuant to its provisions bonds were
issued drawing interest at the rate of
5 per cent, per annum and maturing
ten years after their issue, that being
the shortest time authorized by the
act. I am glad to say, however, that
on the sale of these bonds, the premium
received operated to reduce the rate of
interest to be paid by the government
to less than 3 per cent.
Nothing could be worse or further
removed from sensible finance than
the relations existing between the currency
the government has issued^ the
all sensible human calculation see the
highest limit of the pension roll, and
that after that year it must begin to
decline. The claims oendin? in the
bureau have decreased more tnan $90,000
during the year. A large proportion
of the new claims filed are for increase
of pension by those now on the
rolls. The number of certificates issued
was 80,213. The numbers of
names dropped frem the roll was
80,213. The names dropped from the
rolls for all causes during the year
numbered 37,951. Among our pensioners
are ninewidows and three
daughters of soldiers of the Revolution
and forty-five survivors of the war of
1812.
THE BOND ISSUE.
During the last month the gold re
under tin; authority of the act of June
27, 1890, sometimes called the dependent
pension law.
The total amount expended for pensions
during the year was $139,804,4(51,
leaving an unexpended balance from
the sum appropriated of $25,205,712.
The sum necessary to meet pension
expenditure for the year ending June
30, 1890, is estimated at $140,000,000.
The Commissioner of Pensions is of
the opinion that the year 1895, being
the thirtieth after the close of the War
of the Rebellion, must according to]
act providing for the same in 1819
amount to nearly or quite 80,000,000
acres, of which 58,000,000 have been
patented to States. Abut 138,000 acres
were patented 'during the last year.
Neraly S20,000 acres of school and educational
grants were approved during
the year and at its close 1,250,363.81
acres returned unadjusted.
At the close of last fiscal year on
the 30th of June, 1894, there were 969, 541
persons on our pension rolls being
a net increase of 3,532 over the number
of reported at the end of the previous
year. These pensioners may be
classified as follows: Soldiers and
sailors, survivors of all wars, 753,968,
widows and relatives of deceased soldiers
215,162,army nurses in the war of
the rebellion li4. Of these pensioners
32,039 are surviving soldiers of
Indian and other wars prior to the late
civil war, and the widows or relatives
of such soldiers. The remainder, numbering
937,505, are receiving pensions
on account of the war of the rebellion
and of these, 469,341 are on the rolls
acres in Alaska, as well as military
reservations and railroad and other
selections of land yet unadjudicated.
The total cash receipts from the sale
of lands amounted to $2,674,285.79, including
$91,981.03 received for Indian
lands. Thirty-five thousand patents
were issued to Indians on allotments
of their holdings in severalty. The
land so allotted being inalienable by
the Indian allottee and for a period of
twenty-live years after patent, there
were certified and patented on account
of railroad and wagon road grants
during the year 8(55,55(5.45 acres of
land, and at the closs of the
year 29,000,000 acres were embraced
in the lists of selections by railroad
and wagon road companies and
awaited settlement. The selection of
swamp lands and that taken as indemnity
therefor since the passage of the
U1C5C iCLicra anu pav/Aagco auivuuvcu
to $343,697. The messengers' fees paid
for their delivery amounted to $261,209.70,
leaving a balance in favor of
the government of 182,487,30. The report
shows most gratifying results in
the way of economies worked out without
affecting the efficiency of the postal
service.
There are now connected with the
postoffice establishent 32,661 emplovees
who are in the classified service. This
includes many who have been classified
upon the suggestion of the Postmaster
General. He states that another year's
experience at the head of the department
serves only to strengthen the
conviction as to the excellent working
of the cilvil service law in this branch
of the public service.
PUBLIC LANDS AND PENSIONS.
. The public land disposed of during
the year amounted to 10,406,100.77
acres, including 28,876.05 of Indian
lands. It is estimated that the public
domain still remaining amounts to a
little more than 600,000,000 acres, exrtiii/ii-iKT

ai uomesuc money oraer omces were
established. The total number of
these offices at the close of the year
was 19,204. There were 14,304,041
money orders issued during the year,
being an increase over the preceding
year of 994,306. The value of these
orders amounted to'$138,793,579.49, an
increase of $11,217,145.84. There
were also issued during the year postal
notes amounting to $12,649,094.55.
During the year 218 international
money' order offices were added to
to those already established, making a
total of 2,625, of such offices in operation
June 30, 1891. The number of
international money orders issued during
the year was 917,823, a decrease in
number of 138,176, and their value
was $13,792,455.31, a decrease in
amount of $2,549,382.55. The number
of orders paid was 361,180, an increase
over the preceding year of 60,203, and
their value was S6,568,493.78, an increase
of $1,285,118.08. From the foregoing
statements it appears that the
total issue of money orders and postal
notes for the year amounted to $165,235.129.35.
The number of letters and
packages mailed during the year for
special deliveiy was 3,436,970. The
special delivery stamps used upon
it?
The transactions ot tne postal service
indicate with baroraetic certainty the
fluctuations in the business of the
country. Inasmuch, therefore, as
business complications continued to
exist throughout the last year to an
unforeseen extent, it is not surprising
that the deficiency of revenue to meet
the expenditures of the Postoffice Department,
which was estimated in advance
at about $8,000,000, should be
exceeded by nearly $1,250,000.
The total number of postoffices in
the United States on the 30th day of
June 1894, was 69,805, an increase of
1,403 over the preceding year. Of
these, 3,428 were Presidential, an increase
in that class of sixty-eight
over the preceding year. Six hundred
and ten cities and towns are provided
with free delivery. Ninety-three other
cities and towns entitled to this service
under the law have not been accorded
it on account of insufficient funds.
The expense of free delivery for the
current fiscal year will be more than
$12,300,000, ana under existing legislation
this item of expenditure is suDject
to constant increase. The estimated
cost of rural free delivery generally is
so very large that it ought not to be
considered in the present condition of
affairs. During the year 830 addition1

The total expenditures for the War
Department for the year ended June
30, 1S94, amounted to ?56,039,009.34.
Of this sum $2,000,614.99 was for salaries
and contingent expenses, $23,665,156.16
for the support of the military
establishment, $5,001,682.23 for miscellaneous

POSTAL OPERATIONS.
The report of the Postmaster General
presents a comprehensive statement
of the operations of the Postoffice
Department for the last fiscal year.
The receipts of the department during
the year amounted to $75,080,479.04

THE ARMY.
From the report of the Secretary of
War it appears that the strength of
the army on September 30, 1894. was
2,135 enlisted men. Although tliis is
apparently a very slight decrease compared
with the previous year, the actual
effective force has been increased
to the equivalent of nearly two regiments
through the reorganization of
the system of recruiting, and the consequent
release to regimental duty of
the large force of men hitherto serving
at the recruiting deposits. The
abolition of these deposits, it is predicted,
will further more effect an annual
reduction approximating $250,000
in the direct expenditures, besides
promoting generally the health, mor
1894, with a capital of ?5,285,000, and
seventy-nine with a capital of $10,475,000,
went into voluntary liquidation.
Twenty-one banks, with a capital of
$2,770,000, were placed in the hands
of receivers. The total number of national
banks in existence on the 31st
day of October last was 3,756, being
forty less than on the 31st day of October,
1893. The capital stock paid in
was $672,671,305, being $9,678,491 less
than at the same time in the previous
year, and the surplus fund aiul undivided
profits, less expenses and taxes
paid, amounted to $334,121,082.10,
which was $16,089,7S0 less than on
October 31, 1893. The circulation was
decreased $1,741,563. The obligations
of the banks to each other were increased
$117,268,334 and the individual
deposits were $277,294,489 less
than at the corresponding date in the
previous year. Loans and discounts

providing for the coinage of trade bullion.
The total coinage of all metals
at our mints during the last fiscal
year, consisted of 63,485,220 pieces,)

and 60,000,000 fine ounces of
silver of the bullion or market value
of $46,800,000, and of the coinage value
of $77,576,000. It is estimated that
on the fit-' day of July, 1894, the
stock of inetaliic money m the United
States consisting of coin and bullion,
amounted to $1,250,640,958, of which
$627,923,201 was gold, and $624,347,757

the payments made during the preceding

ceased by operation of law, was $966,185.84.
The total expense incurred in
the payment of the bounty upon sugar
during the fiscal year was $130,140.85.
It is estimated that upon the basis of
the present revenue laws, the receipts
of the government during the current
fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, will
be $424,427,748.44, and its expenditures
$444,427,748.44, resulting in a
deficit of $20,000,000.

to the tariff President Cleveland
expresses a mild interest in free coal
and iron, and declares in favor of
striking out the sugar differential duty
which enriches the trust, and embarrasses
our foreign commerce. He
is strongly in favor of free ships.
RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS.
The Secretary of the Treasury reports
that the receipts of the government
from all sources of revenue during
the fiscal year ending June 30,
1894, amounted to ?372,802,498.29,and
its expenditures to $442,605,758.87,
leaving a deficit of $69,S03,260.58.
There was a decrease of $15,952,674.66
in the ordinary enpenses of the government
as compared with the fiscal
year 1893. There was collected from
customs $131,818,530.62 and from internal
revenue $147,168,449.70. The
balance of the income for the year,
after an apportionment, until it snail
have developed by experiment that
the Indians were ready forallottment.
He commends the exposure of pension
frauds, and it is believed by the
commissioner of pensions that the year
of 1895 will see high water mark in
the number of pensioners. After the
thirtieth year it is estimated that the
number must begin to decrease. The
eleventh census entailed an expense
of over ten millions last year. It will
comprise when completed 25 volumes
of 22,270 pages. The Agricultural
Department seems to have made substantial
savings from its appropriation
without detriment to the service. The
President concurs in the Secretary's
recommendation that the free distribution
of seeds cease, except to experiment
stations, and that the agricultural
reports be greatly limited in number.
The President stands warmly to the
support of the Civil Service. He recommends
the appointment of a na
tion of tons of garden seeds, so that
the Postmaster General declares that
if these abuses were corrected there
would not only cease to be a deficit
in the Postollice Department, but that
legitimate newspapers could be distributed
through the mails free.
President Cleveland favors additional
ships and torpedo boats for the
navy, ana the continuing of work on
our coast defence. He urges a revision
of the line of the navy, and the passage
of laws that will make it possible for
faithful members to receive promotions
that will create a corps d'esprit
that is now badly needed. The President
does not believe in pushing the
Question of allottments of land to Indians
too fast, and thinks if old farmers
are crying hard times, it is not to
be expected that Indians can begin
farming and makea living. He agrees
with the Secretary of the Interior
against the sale of lands remaining

ment prisons for government prisoners,
and everybody will endorse his
approval of the Secretary of War's recommendation
that the present military
prison at Eort Leavenworth be
turned over to the government for the
imprisonment of Federal convicts.
There is no demand for a special penitentiary
for members of the army,
and Mr. Lamont declares that it can be
turned over to the government for
other purposes with an actual saving
of money to the War Department.
The President cordially endorses the
recommendation of Postmaster General
Bissell with reference to restricting
or remodelling the law with reference
to second class matter in the
mails. This privilege properly allowed
by the government for the distribution
' of newspapers to the people, is taken
advantage of by advertising sheets and
by trashy novels, and for the distribu
? regular army officers show a marked
increase in interest and efficiency
amoof the State organizations, and 1
strongly recommend a continuance of
the policy of affording every practical
encouragement possible to tins important
auxiliary of our military establishment."
The President warmly commends
the work of the Circuit Courts of Appeal,
and favors the addition of another
judge in each district. He also favors
a United States Court for the Indian
Territory. He urges the settlement
of the Union Pacific Railroad
matter by this congress in some way
that will take the road out of the
hands of the receiver as speedily as
possible. . *
The President repeats his former reonmmanilafinns

aid would be acceptable in terminating
hostilities. He calls attention to
trade differences -with Germany growing
out of our tariff on sugar, and recommends
the repeal of the one-tenth
of one per cpnt. tax. He recommends
the acceptance by this country of the
award of the Paris tribunal in the
Behring Sea controversy, and the
prompt payment by this country of the
<425,000 in full payment of all claims
of Great Britain. He reviews the
Bluefields incident at some length and
sets forth in familiar manner our relations
with the various foreign powers.
The President shows a great appreciation
of the citizen soldiery of the
several States, and after commending
Secretary Lamont's plan for reorganizing
the regular army, he says: "The
reports of the militia inspections by
sincerity, inuring nit past jcui pmsuant
to a law of Congress, commissioners
wereoppointed to the Antwerp
Industrial Expedition. Though the
participation of American exhibitors
fell far short of completely illustrating
our national ingenuity and industrial
achievements, yet it was quite creditable
in view of the brief time allowed
for preparation.
The message treats first of our foreign
relatiohs, and disapproves of the
situation at Samoa, declaring the present
peace to be unstable, and recommending
our withdrawal as soon as
possible from our connection with
the affair. He calls attention to the
good service of our ships at Rio de Janeiro,
and to the termination of certain
treaty arrangements between this
country and Brazil under the new tariff
; also to the signing of a new treaty
with China. He comments upon the
danger to our people resident in China
during the Japan-China war, and
would heed any intimation that our
Washington, Dec. 5.?The following
is a synopsis of President Cleveland's
Message which was sent to Congress
on last Monday :
To the Congress of the United States:

by the Congress of the United
States, and in the discharge of an executive

the condition of our national affairs

The history of our recent dealings

of consistently adhering to a firm but

or ambitious national schemes and
characterized by entire honesty and
