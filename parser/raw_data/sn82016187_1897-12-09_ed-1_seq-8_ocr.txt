fl FIGHT 8ETWEEH IilOtfS.
BY DR. J. H. PORTER.
"Doctor," said Convers of the Artillery,
then hunting in eastern Soudan, "did you,
who have seen so much of wild beasts,
ever witness a fight between lions?"
"Once," his companion replied, "only
once, and I am not likely to forget it."
"Ah! Bebri," shouted Convers, "bring
beer. Tara! Tara! hasten, be quick, O
m-mi W. Doctor, fill ui) your pipe and
tell me the story." .
"W11 ronlied that scientific tramp,
composing himself more comfortably on a
praving-carpet which he employed to sit
upon, "vou know, of course, that a Hon
wins and keeps his mate only by fighting
successfully with every pretender to her
favor. Such encounters constantly occur
during certain seasons, but very few have
been recorded, because they take place
chieflvat night, and in remote wildernesses.
"The lioness before her whelps are born
is alwavs ready to forsake any consort for
a more nowcrful or fiercer rival: in fact, will
provoke combats on all occasions, evidently I
delighting in them. Naturally this is bene- J
ficial to their race, since it goes tar towards
securing what Darwin calls a "survival of
the fittest!"
"Yes," rejoined Convers; "I knew in gen
eral way that this was the case, but is it
not also true of tigers?"
"No," said his comrade, and speaking in
that vague and misleading manner we are
compelled to employ when using ordinary
modes of speech with reference to inferior
animals, "lions arc gallant and chivalrous
gentlemen compared with those deadly and
infamous wretches. Two tigers cannot in
habit thesame neighborhood. Oneof these
ferocious and solitary monsters always
kills or drives away the other; whereas
lions live, under ordinary circumstances, in
comparative amity, and frequently com
bine to secure prey something which
tigers never do, being apparently incapable
of even a temporary association. The tigress
is forced to conceal her male cubs, or their
sire would destroy them; and if a mother
occasionallv found in company with half-
grown offspring, or two or more wandering J
iigers stop awniie in ine buuiu juii&iu, mm,
is as far as mutual toleration will extend."
"But the story, Doctor, the story," ex
claimed Convers.
"Yes," his friend answered; "what you
want to hear about happened while I was
following up traces of that Egyptian emi
tration into western Soudan, brought about
by Amru's invasion. My course extended
from the Nile, through Agades and various
oases, to Timbuctoo and .lenne, where this
Hamitic colonization came to an end. I
had only two Arabs with me, and five
camels. There was no danger to be appre
hended beyond those risks which desert
journeys always involve, and up to that
time nothing in the way of adventure had
occurred.
"One .morning we reached a place where
grass, water and trees were all at hand, so
as the previous marches had been hard
ones, and our camels were tired, I deter
mined to remain there until next day.
This j
oasis must at one time have expanded to a
considerable size, but now drifting Nubian
sands began to overwhelm it, and already
the fertile land was cut up into a number
ef green islets separated by broad bands of
encroaching desert.
"None of these spots looked very flourish
ing, still that at which we stopped seemed
to be pretty well stocked with palms and
mimosas, while on its eastern edge a
spring of good water welled out into a basin
at the base of one solitary pyramidal
granite tor so regularly formed as to seem
artificial.
"There was a drawback, however; our situ
ation was not all that wc could have de
sired; the margin of this pool had been
literally tramped by lions. Where were
they? Not far off, certainly; and, inde
pendently of our own possibly more sud

"An abundance of 'wait-a-bit' thorn

"This struck me as being good advice,

appeals directly to the popular heart to all

of the lion's power of fascination, sworo

it soon became evident that both were ab

"The lion's mien was wild and disordered.
He advanced openly and defiantly with
out any of those precaution;; which would
have been taken if he had been stalking
prey. With head up and glaring eye, as if
at gaze; lashing his Hanks, uttering sup

thunder on the distant wind, this lordly
creature' came on, and no being save him

"As for the lioness, I did not wonder
that my awestruck companions muttered
curses upon her for a devil. She twined
around that grim consort with an infernal
grace repelling and alluring him. There
was a hideous likeness to familiar human
feelings and motives expressed in her de

sounded from the desert, and bounding
forward the lioness crouched with flattened
ears and gleaming fangs, sending one long,
responsive call down the wind. This chal

completely maddened the lion. Springing
forward he stood before her roaring so tre

became almost overwhelming, and the
rock on which we lay seemed to shake.
"No answer followed, and the lioness
stretched herself beneath a solitary tree,
while her champion paced U) .and fro in
splendid ire. The enemy was evidently
approaching warily; screening himself until
the passion of his fierce heart should over

peculiarly opportune at this time, because this volume
brings the story about up to the point reached by the
work now running as a serial in Tjie National, Triuuxe.
New subscribers, therefore, who receive this volume may
lead it and continue the story in the paper.
It is impossible, briefly, to give an adequate descrip
tion of the scope and character of this immortal chapter
in the history of the civil war. It deals with a great
subject, and one little understood, because it was a tragedy
enacted b.-hind the scenes, obscured by the smoke of
battle in fn nt. "While the public was kept daily informed
of march and .siege and. desperate attack and repulse,
fixing the attention upon the ever-changing panorama of
active warfare, the voice of heroes dying in prison-pens
was lost. No news came from the men herded like cattle
beyond the mountains of the South. The Nation knew
little of the horrors behind the Stockade.

PUZZhES AND QUEUES.
Some Problems Which are Really
Worth While Working Out.
The National Tribune presents some puz
zling problems in science and natural his
tory, which involve valuable and practical
knowledge, and which, when worked out,
will add to the worker's store of informa
tion on the working of Nature's great laws.
Answers to these should bo designated
by number, as they are numbered con
secutively; tho answers given in future
issues, and also the names of the most
successful solvers.
Answer.
30. Cream is lighter than milk, and tends
in senarate from it. as everybody knows.
By substituting an intense centrifugal
force for the comparatively weak force of
gravitation this separation is much facili
tated. When whole milk is fed into a ves
sel rotating 6.CC0 to 7,000 revolutions a
m.nute cream and milk at onco separate,
the heavy milk forming a layer next the
wall, while the lighter cream forms a dis
tinct layer inside the milk layer. By ap
propriate mechanical devices each can be
drawn off separately, and if the feed of
milk is continued the process is rendered
continuous.
31. A 12-gagc shotgun is one the bore of
which is fitted by a round leaden bullet
weighing one-twelfth of a pound. Bullets
weighing ten to the pound fit a 10-gage.
32. The temperature which Fahrenheit
selected as zero was that of the- coldest
clay of a very cold Winter. It happened to
be also the temperature of a mixture of ice
and salt. This coincidence led Fahren
heit to believe his "zero" was really a zero;
i. e., a point at which heat ceased.
As a mathematician Fahrenheit had a
predilection for the circular scale (of 300
degrees), so he made the distance between
boiling and freezing points of water 180
degrees. Degrees of this size made his
new "zero" 32 degrees below freezing point.
Starting now from zero, freezing point be
came 32 and boiling point 212.
33. Dynamite is made by sopping up
nitroglycerin in an absorbent, dry powder.
Sometimes this powder is itself explosive
(nitrated sawdust), sometimes not (Hiescl
guhr or tripoli, which is a highly porous
infusorial earth).
31. E is the most frequently occurring
letter in English words.
35. The old form of Leclanche cell is
made by placing a carbon stick in the
center of a porous cup. Round this stick
are packed fragments of carbon and of
manganese peroxide. The porous cup it
self is plunged into a solution of sal am
moniac contained in a glass jar. In this
jar is also placed a stick of amalgamated
zinc. Zinc and carbon sticks form the
two poles.
3(5. A vacuum or strike pan is the ap
paratus in which sirup is boiled down to
crystallize out sugar. It is usually a large
(10 or 12 feet tall) cylindrical copper pan,
provided with steam-heating coils, and
placed in connection with a vacuum pump.
37. Litmus is a dycstufl extracted from
Roccella tinctora, a lichen growing in Hol
land. It occurs in commerce in small blue
cubes consisting of a little coloring matter
and a good deal of clay. Litmus turns
red when treated with acid. The blue is
restored by alkali.
38. Hematite is red oxid of iron, and is
chemically similar to iron rust. It is the
sesquioxid of iron, consisting of two atoms
of iron united to three of oxygen, and there
fore, when pure, contains 70 per cent, of iron.
30. "Torque" is the amount of force with
which the armatures of electric motors at
rest tend to rotate when current is sup
plied. ...
-10. Water in a suction pump will rise 28
to 31 feet (sea level), the hight depending
on the barometric pressure.

the life of a spy is one of the never-fading
charms of the stories of war. Stories of
such adventures have the same fascination
which attend the exploits of freebooters,
the daring of navigators in unknown seas
and the doings of hunters in untrodden
wild?.
The author began hi3 work with the
biith of the Southern Confederacy at
Montgomery. There and at Richmond he
saw Jell' Davis and other rebel leaders
almost daily, and equally almost daily
was in sight of his own scaffold, in the
event of a betrayal of his identity. Ho
was with Bragg at Pensacola, Beauregard
at Manassas, secured information of the
greatest value, and had a thousaud start
ling adventures.
Having escaped all these desperate
chances and saved his neck, the "Boy
Sp, " now, a generation after the scenes have past, gives to us a thrilling story
fiuh with detail, wherein he tells what he saw and how he escaped the fate which
lioidared day after drty.

It was a process full of the most terrible earn

CONGflESS JHEETS.
National Legislator Acnin In Their Scats
at the Capitol.
Washington awoke as if from a lethargy
whon Congress met on Monday, Dec. (J.
There was a perceptibly larger number of
people in the city and a consequent livelier
appearance of the public ways and abiding
places. The atmosphere became heavily
charged with politics.
The center of attraction was the Capitol,
where, viewed by the spectators who
crowded the galleries. Congress went
through the annual form of preparing for
work. Popular Senators ant' Representa
tives found jtheir desks banked high with
floral tributes, and tho chambers of both
Houses looked like a conservatory. The
handshaking was general; all animosities
seemed to have been laid aside. There
was an undercurrent of expectation, owing
to the importance of President McKinley's
message, soon to be read.
In the Senate, after the gavel'fell, Rev.
Mr. Milburn had offered prayer, remember
ing "Mother" McKinlcy in his petition,
and the roll called, Senators Allison and
Gorman were named to wait upon the
President. As they returned with thecom
plimcnts of the President to Congress, the
mpssanc m.-ide its appearance, and as
printed copies were presented to 77 Sena

that previous to the Atlanta campaign Gen.
C. K. "Woods was made Major-General, and
Col. W. B. "Woods, of the 7Gth Ohio, Brigadier-General.
Gen. "Woods only commanded a brigade,
and Col. "Woods the 7(Jth Ohio until in Sep

that Gen. Osterhans was absent), when Gen.
Woods took command of the First Division,

the army was disbanded, Gen. Woods was
brevetted Major-General, and Col. Wood3
brevetted Brigadier-General.

they were given the honor of leading tho
corps.

one of the most daring spirits engaged upon the
perilous raid which has been described in another
book, entitled " Capturing a Locomotive." "Wilson's
story, however, does not cover the same field as that
written by his comrade, Pitteuger. The charm and
principal part of his narrative consists in his account
of his escape from prison in company with a com

dreds of miles to the Gulf ojt Mexico.
The picture lie gives of life within the rebel lines,
his adventures in his voyage down the river in an old
boat, has all that wonderful charm which invests tales
of daring and trying circumstance in all ages.
The Southern rivers were teeming with water-moccasins
and alligators, the woods were alive with blood
