W. F. WALTON.
Thk democratic caucus on the ."Oth
ballot' nominated Charles F. Crisp, of
Georgia, for Speaker of the House, the
vote stauding, Crisp 11!, Mills 10.,
Springer!, Stevens 1, McMillan having
withdrawn on the previous ballot. While
we weio for Mills because of his long
ervico in the party and his close identification
with the policy of tariff reform,
it is more than probable that the election
of Crisp is better for the democratic
party. Mr. Mills is a very high strum:
man, excitawe to a naui;""'" "w"
and liable to go oil' half cocked anytime.
-Crisp, while spirited enough, is muh
more eyeuly poised,. md not half so easily
rattled, l'.eeil said if Mills were- chosen
Speaker he would have him so mad in a
week that he would he throwing the
gavel at him. It would not have been
quite so bad ns that, but those who
know Mr. Mills best say his high temper
is his besetting sin. Mr. Crisp is a
Gov. McCreary kind of a man and well
equipped for the position with a good
voice, cool head and line presence. He
Is the best suited of any of the candidates
for the pluce and the predictions
that he will make a presiding officer
worthy to be clawed with Carlisle, aro
sure of fulfillment. The talk about his
protective preelections is the merest
poppy cock. He is as strong a tariff reformer
as the best of us, as his record
in and out of Congress will prove. Head
what lie says about it himself in another
column and banish the thought that
tarifl reform has received a black eye in
his election. On the question of silver
he is said to be as conservative as Mills
and his lovalty to every principle of
democracy is beyond question. On the
whole the democrats of the House have
done exceedingly well ami made a beginning
which augurs well for the futuie
of the; party.
Thk failure of tho House to organize
Monday recalls the fact that tho Congress
of 1S:M0 took 12 days to elect a
Speaker, when It. M. T. Hunter, of Virginia,
was chosen. John
Quiney Adams was chosen temporary
chairman of the House during the time.
In 1:5411 three weeks were retruired to
choose a Speaker, Howell Cobb, democrat,
being finally chosen over H. C.
AVinMirnn. Ids whitf competitor. InlSooi
it took from the first Monday in December
to tho same time in February, ISM,
to organiie the Houhc, which was finally
accomplished by electing Gen. N. P.
Banks Speaker. The last failure before
the one this week to organize on the
liret day of the session was in lSo, when
it took "eight weeks, Win. Pennington,
of New Jersey, being llnally chosen to
preside.
Tut: Todd County Progress is evidently
not for its home candidate for State
librarian, Miss Maud Kirkhain, or it
would never have printed that picture,
which must be a miserable carricature
on her. A woman with tho kind of a
face the Progress prints would stand no
more chance of being elected librarian
than a horrid man in a field of ladies, and
Loving Gaines owes it to the lady and to
to the public to get a better cut or kill
his artist. We are sure no lady with the
pretty name of.Maud has a face anything
like tho cut, which was evidently made
with a rip saw and a cold chisel.
Thk of Sing Sing killed M. I).
Loppy, the wife murderer, by electricity
Monday in a very artistic and satisfactory
manner. There was no adc made and
not many people knew of the execution
till it was all over. The 1.4S5 volts,
which were shot through his system for
50 seconds, killed Loppy before he was
aware of what was going on. It must be
mighty trying on a murderer's nerves to
be killed like a dog, with no chance to
pardon them in advance of the anticipated
jail sentence and fines. It is to be
hoped that the executive will not interfere,
but will let these "ladies" learn by
experience that there are two ways of
doing a thing, the right and the wrong
wav.
The President's Message.
Tiik President did not send his message
to Congress till Wednesday, when
he had dumped a pile of printed pages
nearly a fot high on the desks of the
two presiding officers. It contains 17,-000
words or nearly 12 columns, ?i inch
es long of solid noupatoil. We thought
at first to send it to our readers, but
wouldn't one in 100 wade through it so
we epitomize for tho benefit of those
who feel that life is too Bhort to devote
so much of it to what one man, and not
a very great man at that, has to say.
The message begins by calling atten
tion to the comprehensive reports of the
heads of the departments, especially
that of the State, "which has been char
acterized by an unusual number of important
negotiations and by diplomatic
results of a notable and highly beneficial
character," including the Hehring
Sea matter, reciprocal trado arrangements,
the Brazilian revolt, the Italian
row and the Chillian revolution.
All the blessings, past, present, future
and imaginary of tho McKinley hill are
expaciated upon and the president almost
convinces himself that the iniquitous
thingis a blessing in disgust-.
On the silver question, as on the tarifl",
it is recommended that existing laws be
given a chance hetore any mange is
made. The free coinage of silver, under
existing con litions wnuld disastrously
affect our business interests at home
and abroad. The silver producers are
entitled to just consideration, but they
should bear in mind that the government
is buying and putting out of the
market more than the entire product of
our silver mines.
I In war ami navv departments are
commended and laud and coast defenses
recommended. The adoption of smokeless
powder and the enlistment of Indians
as soldiers are also commended,
while the president grows absolutely enthusiastic
over the fact that the pension
bureau luis passed on and closed during
the vear all the claims presented,
nAttitill.ctiin.tiii.i ;t ifnu II AA1 Iw.lii.i.l n, '

the beginning of the year.
The president also has a good word
for the judiciary and he concurs with
the attorney general tiiut tho right in
felony cases to it review by the supreme
court should he limited. Attention is
called to the fact that Canada is doing a
thriving business in smuggling
to this country and he wants the
law amended so as to cover this infraction.
P. M. G. Wananuker also comes
in for fine words of praise in his management
of the department,
which the president thinks was never in
so gratilying a condition.
A long dessertation on the Indian
inestion is made, hut nothing new or
especially interesting is presented and
the pension bureau again comes in for
praise. He thinks that the call for$l II,-i)"0,000
to pay pensions the ne.it fiscal
year is not extravagant and those who
say to the contrary are mistaken. Recommendations
for further appropriations
for the worthless census bureau
aro made and provisions for government
of towns in Alaska suggested.
